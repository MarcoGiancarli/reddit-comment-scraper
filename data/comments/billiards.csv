billiards,3e5tcz,auchim,2,Wed Jul 22 04:31:37 2015 UTC,http://youtu.be/IYrJm9Aq2e8  This happens sometimes on a few pockets where I play. This is a video I made.
billiards,3e2kr1,southpawunited,3,Tue Jul 21 13:51:43 2015 UTC,"When you use a LD shaft you must adjust placement of the bridge hand to aim, rather than pivot the shaft on the bridge hand."
billiards,3e2kr1,NeverWasNorWillBe,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:18:16 2015 UTC,"Actually... that doesn't have anything to do with LD or HD... for a hard stroke, you use back hand english.  For a soft or medium, use front-hand english (which is what you described).  Also, keep the cue as level as possible, especially for the softer shots."
billiards,3e2kr1,mkglass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:07:07 2015 UTC,"It does, when using side english, according to Dr Dave. The way you compensate for spin induced throw is different between LD and regular shafts. I'll link the colostate.edu page I learned this from when I'm out of work. I play with both types of shafts and the difference is pretty apparent. In case you missed it, OP is talking about inside and outside English."
billiards,3e2kr1,NeverWasNorWillBe,0,Tue Jul 21 18:55:30 2015 UTC,Looking forward to the link...I hope it helps me out. I'm still relatively new to the game and cut induced throw definitely throws me off.
billiards,3e2kr1,NeverWasNorWillBe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:14:47 2015 UTC,With cut induced throw you just want to slightly over cut the tangent on tight angles until your intuition takes over with the HAMB method. The article I'll post on spin induced throw will help your English game a lot.
billiards,3e2kr1,rocksauce,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:28:25 2015 UTC,"What you are doing works, but it will be more difficult to maintain a consistent stroke because you are moving your back hand side to side. I prefer to move my bridge hand left to right and stroke the ball in the exact same way as if I were putting no English at all eg. My cue stick is moving in a straight line. This will add some deflection or squirt, but not more than you already are compensating for subconsciously for other things like bad rails, coin opp cue ball weights/sizes, throw effect and so on. The deflection becomes more pronounced the further you get away from the center of the cue ball."
billiards,3e2kr1,mkglass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:24:05 2015 UTC,"You are using what's called back hand english.  This is a good method for most shots where you need to apply english, but it requires that you know your cue stick well.  For any new stick, even if it's the same brand and model, you'll need to test it.  I usually do this by shooting from the spot, down the length of the table, using varying bridge lengths.  If you are not opposed to marking your cue, I'd recommend placing a small sharpie-dot on the cue at the right spot.  Do this test for every cue... each one will vary slightly.  I have even found that some cues offer different deflection amounts if you rotate the cue to a different orientation.  If you are anal enough, take this into account, find your spot, and always shoot with that spot in the same orientation when you're applying english."
billiards,3e2kr1,corellianspiceaddict,0,Tue Jul 21 18:03:16 2015 UTC,"I don't line up like that at all. I find my aim line then get on the ball. Ready to shoot. If the line looks funky, get up and reset. Works for me."
billiards,3e2kr1,corellianspiceaddict,0,Tue Jul 21 15:15:03 2015 UTC,I got this method from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5T3ai0SM1aw the segment starts at 0:40.
billiards,3e2kr1,mkglass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:22:12 2015 UTC,That only works on hard long shots. You never need to hit a ball that hard. You should watch the tor Lowry videos instead. Much better information there.
billiards,3e2kr1,parlarry,0,Tue Jul 21 15:44:32 2015 UTC,"It works for hard shots, true.  But the distance doesn't matter.  The idea is to correct the angle for deflection, and that angle is the same if the shot is 6 inches or 6 feet."
billiards,3e2kr1,mkglass,0,Tue Jul 21 18:08:47 2015 UTC,"I found this method on my own recently. I've also found that to use it successfully, you have to adjust the distance between your bridge hand and cue ball proportionally to the distance of the cue ball and the object ball."
billiards,3e2xny,petermgates,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:33:08 2015 UTC,I really hope that this stops being the norm for pool. It's tough to grow as a sport when everything is PPV. Recently there has been a bunch of poker making its way onto Twitch. I would love to see that model instead and just grow the numbers of viewers.
billiards,3e2xny,williedills,0,Tue Jul 21 17:05:11 2015 UTC,"PPV doesn't seem to have hurt boxing or UFC.  My opinion is that the sport won't grow because on the whole, not that many people really like to watch pool. Even committed pool players that I know just aren't that interested in watching tournaments. Don't get me wrong -- being a Brit who grew up watching snooker on TV, I find this attitude incomprehensible.  Anyway, I see your point that making streams free could potentially draw in new viewers and there are a lot of free pool streams out there, not to mention the big Matchroom Sport events usually being picked up by ESPN. I just think that with the dearth of major advertising revenue for the sport, promoters need to use every option to put together a prize purse that will attract the top players.  When I buy a PPV stream, I tend to think of it as supporting the tournament. I don't really watch other sports and I don't have cable, espn etc. so I'm happy to put my hand in my pocket occasionally. Look at the recent 14.1 World Tournament -- they have the ""141 Club"" which encourages people to sponsor the event. Half of those listed are not businesses, just people who love the sport and want to see it played at a high level.  Apologies for the long ramble."
billiards,3e2xny,williedills,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:59:12 2015 UTC,"I agree that purchasing these is supporting the tourney and I personally have no issue doing that. My point is that pool is going to have a tougher time because of exactly what you said, ""not that many people really like to watch pool.""  Pool shouldn't be compared to boxing or UFC as those just have broader appeal to begin with. If pool doesn't find a way to let people watch it who aren't already pool fans then it will always be a niche sport and the best players in the world will continue to make peanuts.  I am just hopeful that something will come along to change that and I don't think it's a PPV model."
billiards,3e2xny,redditis4queers,0,Tue Jul 21 19:09:15 2015 UTC,Me too. I find it strange that there are lots of snooker fans who have no desire to pick up a cue and yet will be glued to their TV for the majority of a ten-hour final.

billiards,3e1pk7,dalgeek,5,Tue Jul 21 07:36:13 2015 UTC,"When my friends and I play together, and one of us taps the cue ball on accident, we just laugh and forget about it, but that's 'cause we're just goofing off. I can't imagine playing a serious game and letting it slide. Sucks you had to deal with that; I'd be upset as hell, too."
billiards,3e1pk7,boopityboopbop,5,Tue Jul 21 09:55:38 2015 UTC,"We joking call these ""courtesy fouls"" and let them slide when playing for fun. There's this 92+ year old guy that plays in some tourneys and we extend them to him just because his hands shake so bad. He repays the kindness by telling us stories about when he used to be a rack boy for some of the great players."
billiards,3e1pk7,fadedcheese,3,Tue Jul 21 12:58:48 2015 UTC,"If it was a practice game or a fun game I'd just tell him to put it back and shoot it again. The player handled it well, it was his teammate who acted like a dick."
billiards,3e1pk7,nsfyn55,4,Tue Jul 21 14:28:46 2015 UTC,"I ended up winning, but I've never felt so shitty about beating someone.    Imagine this scenario you let your opponent slide on this minor infraction and the match continues. Your opponent hits a bit of lucky streak and the match becomes 4-1. In this final game the table plays poorly for you and you end up behind on the 8-ball. Now to further exacerbate things the other team needs this game to win the match.   If in this tense situation you committed the same exact foul do you believe the other player/captain would let you slide? I can tell you from experience its unlikely. I have literally had this happen to me and the other player with a big shit eating grin looked me and said ""Sorry man we need this"". He did this without a speck of remorse, but I couldn't fault him for it. He did what he needed to win.  These rules exist for a reason and its to take the ""What ifs"" out of the equation. Especially when there are high stakes. Play your game man and don't give anything away for free because nobody is going to give it back."
billiards,3e1pk7,nsfyn55,3,Tue Jul 21 14:28:55 2015 UTC,"You're right, I can almost guarantee that they wouldn't let it slide, and I've heard of similar situations happening in my area. I could imagine them saying something like ""You're a 6, you know better"" or ""It was different"". Their argument was that since he hit it with the SIDE of his cue it was OK .. someone didn't read the rule book, especially the part about ""the cue ball is always live.""  Later when I was talking to the captain he made a comment about how there are too many rules. The rules in APA are actually simplified and that particular foul would be a foul in ANY league."
billiards,3e1pk7,nsfyn55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:39:40 2015 UTC,he hit it with the SIDE of his cue it was OK   You should check with your LO on this. Our by-laws allow a player to adjust the cue ball with the stick even though by a strict interpretation this is a foul. This may actually be a thing.
billiards,3e1pk7,I_am_the_LION,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:54:49 2015 UTC,"If he had ball in hand previously then he would be allowed to adjust the position of the cue ball with his cue stick. I really hate it because of the vagueness of the rule .. if you're ""in stroke"" then it's a foul, but if you're just adjusting the position it's not. I tell my players to not risk it and keep the cue stick away from the ball until they're ready to shoot."
billiards,3e1pk7,jlbartle,2,Tue Jul 21 15:04:20 2015 UTC,Yeah never mind. For some reason I thought you said it was Ball in hand. Yeah on a standard shot this is a foul all day long. If any part of your stick moves the cue ball.
billiards,3e1pk7,nsfyn55,3,Tue Jul 21 15:11:18 2015 UTC,"Jesus, what a baby. I'm sorry you had to deal with that. I don't understand how people don't take pride in their game. If I win, I want it to be because I'm the better player. Not because I made a stupid mistake and my opponent let it slide."
billiards,3e1pk7,MrV2121,3,Tue Jul 21 08:52:10 2015 UTC,"Handicaps are there to make the match equal. I'm a 7 and have been beat 2-1 by a 3. The handicap is hard to fight some nights.  I would let an unmarked pocket slide but not a cue ball foul. That's obnoxious. Feel free to write the captain up for sportsmanship. I might buy the player a beer after and tell him we can play again right now and I won't call it,  no hard feelings."
billiards,3e1pk7,nsfyn55,3,Tue Jul 21 10:10:15 2015 UTC,Agree completely. I'm a 6 and lost 2-1 to a 3 just last night. Your first instinct is to be enraged(mostly at yourself) then you remember that is the point of the handicap.    I would let an unmarked pocket slide   Kudos super stand up. This gets really petty way too often.
billiards,3e1pk7,Lukex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:11:39 2015 UTC,"Most games, if it's a pretty straight forward 8-ball shot, my opponent and I don't even bother calling the pocket.  It's usually just assumed.  Only requires a call if it's not an obvious 8-ball shot."
billiards,3e1pk7,mattdebrown,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:03:53 2015 UTC,9 out of 10 I let slide unless my opponent isn't playing like a sportsperson then all bets are off.
billiards,3e1pk7,TheGardenShark,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:23:09 2015 UTC,"A local player got a sportsmanship award for doing this in City. It was the last game of the match and with all the excitement the other player forgot to mark his/her pocket. It was an obvious shot, not some crazy bank, so the player let it go. He could have easily said ""Hey, you didn't mark it, loss of game"" and by the letter of the rules any referee or league rep would have given him the game.  Sometimes I'll let someone get away with just calling the pocket. If it's someone I know or another high level player then it's not a big deal. With strangers or new players I always mark the pocket."
billiards,3e1pk7,too_lazy_2_punctuate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:02:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the handicaps are designed so that either player has a 50/50 chance of winning (unless you're playing a certain 7). There were a couple games where it could have gone either way, so it's not like I was running racks on the guy. I talked to the captain and told him I wouldn't talk to the LO if he handled it. While we were finalizing the score sheet I saw that someone on the other team had marked us down for sportsmanship (lol), which I pointed out to the other captain and he fixed it. I might drop the LO an unofficial note anyway .."

billiards,3e1pk7,MrV2121,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:27:46 2015 UTC,Rules are rules. If everyone isn't playing by the same rules then it's not really fair. The handicap is there to level the playing field so there is no need to make further concessions because one player is less skilled than the other.
billiards,3e1pk7,sacris5,4,Tue Jul 21 21:13:12 2015 UTC,"I tapped the cue ball last night, and just called it myself. The other team said they didn't see it and they laughed at me. But the men with brooms are my moral guides. Call your own fouls, especially subtle pushes that aren't visibly obvious, but you can feel. Otherwise kill yourself for the good of the world. Or at least know in your heart you are weak minded human. Sandbaggers too. And if you don't want to kill yourself it's never too late to be better. Now bring on the down votes for how pompous this reads. I accept that, but still stand by my words"
billiards,3e1pk7,CheddaCharles,2,Tue Jul 21 16:38:09 2015 UTC,"I call my own fouls, and my opponent was a stand up guy as well. The first time he tapped the cue ball I wasn't even looking and he gave me ball in hand. It just doesn't pay to be dishonest because it doesn't improve your game and eventually you're going to get caught. Not sure about killing yourself, but it definitely means one has room for improvement ;)"

billiards,3dyaue,RoadHustler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:55:46 2015 UTC,"I'd call the guy back out.  Any mechanic I've dealt with guaranteed their work so if the table came out of level or the cloth had issues outside of normal wear and tear, they'd come back and fix it."
billiards,3dyaue,AyyTeeEll,-3,Mon Jul 20 15:40:27 2015 UTC,"It sounds as if the adhesive was not ideal for the application.  Simonis cloth being a worsted material is actually easier to keep down with adhesive than standard felt that is woolen with fabric that sheds.  On the other hand depending on the depth of the pocket, Simonis can be a very unforgiving material even when using staples.  I would not try to resolve the situation with the rails, pockets on, you could make a very large mess.  Best to have someone who knows the material and has worked with it before.  This is not too uncommon when dealing with Simonis on deep cut pockets in the slate. You see it alot in bars because they are 1 piece slates.  Hope this helps.  Jeff Black."

I have one similar to the g206(different color) and my buddy has the either the g224 or one of a different color, but it looks like that one.  They shoot the same.  It really just depends on how you want the cue to look.  They both have the g-core shaft, and that's what really sets how they shoot."
billiards,3dxbfr,yel02,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:53:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!  I really like the look of both, so to me it was just down to which is a better cue. Will save my $50 I think :)"

I was so excited to buy my first cue that I didn't even consider buying used. I would definitely recommend browsing the second hand markets.   That level of Mcdermott cue comes with a lifetime warranty for the original buyer though. Which is worth considering If you don't plan on getting rid of it."
billiards,3dwkdc,excessivelyobscure,4,Mon Jul 20 03:16:29 2015 UTC,"You're going to have to remove the cloth, reset the slates, and put the cloth back on. I feel your pain, I went with a bargain basement table mechanic and got what I paid for."
billiards,3dwkdc,squid06,2,Mon Jul 20 05:18:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry but not really. There is now wax under the felt and it needs to be removed. You've knocked the slate out of alignment and this caused the seem to pop. To really fix it the felt needs to come off, reset the slates, reseem it, and then restretch the felt. I've seen people think they are smart and use a rolling pin to try and flatted it down. All this does is push the wax into the felt and ruin it too.  Never pickup a table by the rails or skirts because this generally pulls on the slate. If you ever do need to move a table, like you did, it's best to get under it and lift it from the cabinet very gently. Be careful if there could be shims under the legs.  Also if it's on carpet it will resettle and possibly need some adjustments. Normally a mechanic will do an adjustment like this for cheap enough that it's worth it to save you this hassle. I'm sure you've learned your lesson.  This is why I love my Diamond ProAm. A single 9 ft piece of slate with the whole leveling system that just requires a ratchet turn. Never have a seam to pop. But moving it to a new location is a bit more tricky without the Diamond cart."
billiards,3dwkdc,fadedcheese,2,Mon Jul 20 13:04:41 2015 UTC,A single piece? That's got to be incredibly heavy. It was a hard enough time carrying the three pieces in one by one.
billiards,3dwkdc,fadedcheese,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:03:21 2015 UTC,"Diamond made a special cart to move them. They can move one and set it up in minutes. Roll cart to the side of the table, lock it, flip the table in to it, close the jaws then wheel wherever you'd like it. It works on their 10ft tables too. At DCC they will swap the 10ft for the 9ft and have it leveled in roughly an hour for the arena table. It's a pretty neat system."
billiards,3dwkdc,FreeThinker76,2,Tue Jul 21 12:50:40 2015 UTC,"Contrary to what some may say, I have worked with a few table mechanics that take their work very seriously, most if not all of them use Bondo over Beeswax.   Now, the question is, why did it bulge up?  It should not have. You may need to pull the cloth and have it redone including tightening the screws.  It is possible whoever set it up was too afraid to tighten them knowing that you can overdo it and crack the slate.  It is also possible to have warped slate on a minut scale but enough where the seems do not match up.  There is a process where you use bottle jacks and tie-down straps and you put the 2 warped seems into place and then you use superglue (yes, superglue) with an accelerator to bond it and it holds very well.  Was this table new?  Maybe this was the case and you are actually seeing the seems being uneven."
billiards,3dwkdc,FreeThinker76,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:42:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was a new table. I watched the guy melting done substance onto the slate, I can only assume it was wax. I can only hope that the slate it's not warped."

billiards,3dvz9y,S0cr8t3s,3,Mon Jul 20 00:06:24 2015 UTC,I have tried repeating the same shot in practice but It hasn't really helped in the long run.    Sounds like you need more practice. Get some hole reinforcements from staples and mark two spots on the table. Shoot that shot 500 times and it'll become part of your soul. This shot will come easiest with the application of outside english(because the ball will curve back towards the pocket) but you should become familiar with it using a variety of spins.
billiards,3dvz9y,nsfyn55,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:10:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I'll second this. Not really any trick to practicing these shots besides repetition.

billiards,3dvz9y,wubbadubba,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:59:12 2015 UTC,Do you use low outside to put throw on the OB?
billiards,3dvz9y,I_was_the_Gooch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:58:56 2015 UTC,"Low outside would reduce collision induced throw, especially with dirty bar balls. In essence you are ""rolling"" the cue ball off the object ball. I tend to think of it making the hit roll more true, as opposed to actually ""throwing"" the object ball slightly away from the rail to avoid the side pocket points."
billiards,3dvz9y,SeabrookMiglla,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:20:26 2015 UTC,yeah bottom outside on a variety of these long rail shots works pretty well. 3 o'clock will work also.
billiards,3dvz9y,gotwired,2,Mon Jul 20 05:33:55 2015 UTC,Hit it firmly. Most people tend to over-baby those shots and the throw dumps it right into the rail.
billiards,3dvz9y,petermgates,2,Mon Jul 20 08:07:25 2015 UTC,"This article might be interesting to you.  Edit: Basically, as /u/dirtyduo points out, people report more success by slightly overcutting the ball. That being said, a cut down the long rail, past the side pocket is one of the toughest shots there is - your margin for error is so small..."
billiards,3dvz9y,dirtyduo,2,Mon Jul 20 09:50:31 2015 UTC,I think the problem people have with these shots is that you can't see if you are over or undercutting the ball.  The OB pretty much does the same thing either way (travels away from the cushion) whether you over or undercut it so your brain doesn't get to lock in the mistake and use it for reference.  I suggest over cutting it and working your way toward under cutting until your making it consistently.  Your brain will then at least know whats going wrong.
billiards,3dvz9y,dubov,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:11:18 2015 UTC,"Use a little bit of running side if the cut is not too fine  As one of the posters mentioned don't hit it too soft - it's easy to push at these and not give it a proper stroke  If you tend to miss on the near jaw, aim for the far jaw of the pocket, not the hole itself (that's a general point I suppose)"
billiards,3dvz9y,xmpx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:12:07 2015 UTC,long near rail cut shot?
billiards,3dvz9y,corellianspiceaddict,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:36:45 2015 UTC,"The best advice I can give you is that your line is off some. Try learning the shot without spin. Using top, center and low to pocket the ball. Make sure your line is true and your hitting on the line correctly. Once you have this then start to apply spin. Remember, there is a difference between the apparent line and the actual line. Remember to look at the point of contact and line your shot up from there. Hope this helps. Some of the advice in this thread isn't really going to help you in the long run. If you have to use spin to pocket the ball you tend to lose control of the cue ball. This may not affect some games like 8 ball. Where you have multiple balls and positions to play from. However rotation games like 9 & 10 ball this usually holds true. In order to get position you need to be able to make the ball and play position to different areas of the table. Have fun."

If I make a mistake I drop one from each side (so if I started on 5 I drop to 4).  I stop when either I drop below 2 balls (disaster) or manage to run all 7 out (win).  I started doing that because I realized my positional play wasn't that great anymore, and it improved pretty quickly.  Other than that, I've started to practice snooker on the one table in the Bay Area (Edgie's), which I think helps my long shots in pool. The table wins though."

Later in the game it becomes possible but many players end up in safe positions by chance. A few of my buddies who play league have intentionally played safe on me(on bar tables), mostly while gambling.  I think they would have done the same thing on a big table if the situation permitted. But it could be argued that playing safe is easier on a more congested bar table."
billiards,3du14y,S0cr8t3s,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:39:40 2015 UTC,"I think it's more of the bar player mentality because it's definitely possible (and advisable) to play defense on bar boxes. I played APA regionals a few months ago, and most of the guys I played were from east Texas where they play mostly in small bars. Most of them either didn't know how to play defense or simply refused to. Even though I normally play on 8' tables, I ran them over because they just would not play defense. On the second day I won my matches 4-2, 4-1, and 4-0."
billiards,3du14y,dalgeek,2,Mon Jul 20 00:01:59 2015 UTC,"This is very common along the southwest US border where I lived for many years. They view safety play as being a pussy. You're expected to try to make a shot even if you have no chance and even if you'll clearly improve the situation for your opponent.  Even more so if you're playing for money.  I can clearly picture their eyes agog at the regionals with all these players playing ""coyote"" shots."

They aren't perfect, but they aren't bad. The worst is when you are playing at your favorite bar and you get randoms that decide to try an make up rules while playing.

billiards,3du14y,WillyCornbread,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:24:16 2015 UTC,I've found it better to break a little softer on bar tables. Balls tend to cluster up anyway and slower rolling balls fall into the pockets easier.

billiards,3dpq1b,DarkKnight2060,4,Sat Jul 18 10:55:06 2015 UTC,Poor Alex makes 6 balls on the break and couldn't even get out. I seem to remember it happening again to him at DCC this year too.
billiards,3dpq1b,fadedcheese,3,Sat Jul 18 14:33:11 2015 UTC,"The 8-ball is intentionally placed in the least likely position to result in a made ball on the break. Since it goes in on occasion you can state empirically that there is no position in the rack that has zero chance of being made on the break. In addition there is a famous trick shot that involves making 7 balls so we know its not physically impossible  to pot 7 balls in a single stroke(though not in rack configuration)(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5z5d9adJr8)  I've been playing pool with some degree of seriousness for 10 years and have a pretty hard break. I've made the 8-ball 5 or 6 times(only once on a 9 foot table) and as of Friday have made 5 on the break once.  This is out of 10,000s of racks. Making all the balls is the equivalent to making 7 on the break and the 8 ball simultaneously. Pretty low probability event for a human.  But theoretically the odds of making more balls increases the longer the balls stay in motion(i.e. with the amount of force with which you struck the rack). So if you could hit them hard enough without breaking the balls, the table, or sending things into the air it keeps going up approaching 100% likelihood.  EDIT: I think I changed your question a little bit to ""Is it possible to sink all of my balls on the break"" but same logic applies to sinking all the balls."

billiards,3dpq1b,uunngghh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:17:55 2015 UTC,I break the 8 at least once a session breaking this way.  Whether it be a 7-footer or a 9-footer.  I've been playing semi-seriously for about a year now and I already have recorded over ten 8-on-the-breaks during league play alone.  Definitely over 50 times including practice games with team mates and stuff.
billiards,3dpq1b,MrV2121,2,Tue Jul 21 19:04:17 2015 UTC,"I think there are some practical reasons it may not be possible, but proving this might require just as much complex math as trying to prove it's possible.   The reason I think it's probably not is: Some of the balls in an 8 ball rack travel towards holes pretty easily. But others, in a normal rack, don't head anywhere near pockets. Those ones that normally ""don't go"" might be makeable, if there are certain gaps in the rack, and the rack is broken a certain way... but doing that might cause the other balls (the ones that normally head towards pockets) to miss their pockets.  So it's always a tradeoff...  any hit that helps make certain balls, may prevent other balls from going.   Another possibility is that even if there's a certain hit and certain gaps that can cause all the balls to go, the speed needed to make it happen is impossible for a human to achieve.   Another problem is that the cue ball is always struck at an angle on the break because the rails of the table prevent you from hitting with a perfectly flat, level cue. This angled hit causes the cue ball to bounce off the slate like a stone skipping across water. This not only causes the cue ball to fly off the table on extra hard breaks, it can send other balls off the table too. So even if there's a special break at that could make all the balls... the bouncing cue ball may send balls off the table instead of towards their intended pockets, and there may be no way around this without removing the rail so the cue can make a level hit.  I'm not sure I've even heard claims of someone making more than 8 balls on the break, even after the billions and billions of break shots that have occurred over time.   In 9 ball, I could maybe believe it, 7 balls on the break has been caught on camera and most of the balls 'point' pretty close to pockets on a typical break.   If you really want to get a more scientific answer, you should contact Dr David Alciatore. I don't think anyone on earth has studied the physics of how pool balls behave more than this guy. And he's got some great instructional material on his website at http://billiards.colostate.edu/"

billiards,3dpq1b,Kahmeleon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:52:34 2015 UTC,Best I've ever personally seen was 7 balls on a 9 ball break. One was the 9 so instawin. This is without scratching.   I would think it would be pointless to make ALL the balls because you'd lose in any game by most rule sets. Make the 8 and scratch is a loss in most leagues. Making all and the 9 and scratching would result in you giving BiH to your opponent on the spotted up 9. One pocket would be interesting you'd have all 15 balls in a line due to spotting them all up for the foul.

I would recommend building a cheap 5 gallon bucket ball polisher to keep them nice. You can find YouTube videos that show you how. Mine costs $25 total to make. Younger kids tend to use their hands to knock other balls around. They also tend to eat greasy chicken nuggets and transfer that to the balls. This will effect how the balls play and cause them to get dirtier faster. The dirtier you let the balls get the harder it will be to bring back their shine.

billiards,3dn8hh,sfc949,2,Fri Jul 17 18:10:22 2015 UTC,Normally once a week when we are playing a lot. I use rubbing alcohol to clean any dirt or black marks off them. Then I use Aramith ball cleaner to polish them in the bucket. I think this setup works just as well if not better than the Diamond $400 unit. This and keeping your table brushed/vacuumed and covered when not in use will drastically extend the life of the cloth and balls. Put the balls in the bucket and while it's running clean the table. Takes 10-15mins out of your normal play time but will make all the rest of your playtime much more enjoyable.
billiards,3dn8hh,sfc949,2,Fri Jul 17 18:36:45 2015 UTC,"I have that same cleaner and a chamois cloth for hand polishing. Never thought of/ knew about the ball cleaning machine. I'll try to make one in an old stainless steel trash can that I have so it'll look nice in the game room. It's gonna be a good conversation piece.  Here I am again with the paranoia, do you know how much material is taken off the ball when you polish it? In other words, if you clean them once a week for 15 minutes, how long will it take for the ball to be less than the regulation size Ø-2 1/4""?"
billiards,3dn8hh,redditor1983,3,Fri Jul 17 18:46:53 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, far less than the damage the balls take from being hit into one another. Even if they do remove material, which I highly doubt they do to any significant degree, it should be ""even wear"" so all the balls should still be the same size. Balls are going to wear down and need to be replaced from contacting each other during play. I replace my cue ball about every 3-6 months. I'd consider a new set of Aramiths maybe after 5-10 years with HEAVY play if taken care of properly. Breaking and contact will do far more damage to a ball. Also letting them get dirty will effect their play far more than any miniscule amount that polishing would remove. I mean I know of pool halls that polish the balls almost nightly and never noticed it being a problem. I wouldn't personally ever worry about that aspect of polishing them. Contact damage is much more likely to degrade the set."

billiards,3dispb,HandShoes,2,Thu Jul 16 19:05:03 2015 UTC,"There was no mention of a straight shot being illegal. The rules mentioned were pick a color to aim for, pocket that and then the 8-ball. A scratch is a loss. That was it."

The hole is on one of the focal points of the ellipse, and so long as the object ball passes through the other focal point (with natural roll) it will go in the pocket on the next bank."

billiards,3dibqm,corellianspiceaddict,4,Thu Jul 16 14:49:21 2015 UTC,"Not 100% sure I agree with you. If OP's stroke was busted they'd be struggling on the cuts to. There is something about those straight shots(I think OP would agree with me that its really long, straight shots of half a table or more) they are like an optical illusion or something."
billiards,3dibqm,nsfyn55,2,Thu Jul 16 15:00:59 2015 UTC,"Yes. That's exactly it. Something about those down the table straight shots. My stroke must be off a bit but as someone above said my cut shots are fine leading me to believe that I'm hitting the cue true. But maybe just not as true as I would like to believe.  Edit: Ha! That ""someone above"" was you. Nevermind. I need some coffee."
billiards,3dibqm,mattdebrown,4,Thu Jul 16 15:12:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not positive, but as far as the stroke being off not affecting cuts as much. If you had the cue ball at the right contact point, (negating squirt) but were accidentally spinning the ball, the spin would impart more throw with the full contact, where it wouldn't be as noticeable with a glancing cut shot contact. Not sure if that makes sense. But at the end of the day I also vote straighten the stroke. Make sure you have a measle cue ball, and as brutal as it seems do the zero-x straightening drill. And really do it with focus. It is worth it imo. I hear a lot of people say they have trouble with straight in shots and I find it baffling. If mechanics are good, it should be pretty straight forward. Hehe sorry for the bad pun. And also if the stroke is straight it might be a mental tick, in which case god speed friend. The mental game is a whole other can of worms."
billiards,3dibqm,nsfyn55,2,Thu Jul 16 16:57:37 2015 UTC,"I find I have to hit these a little more to the outside than I think I need to and I have to really concentrate on the stroke. The TL;DR of what you'll likely hear is ... what's intuitive may not reflect what's true the only way to train your brain to what is true is to drill, drill, drill. At first you will be frustrated(see me and ""L"" drills I almost threw my cue in the trash). One day it will feel natural but don't stop there you want to turn this weakness into your strongest shot."
billiards,3dibqm,corellianspiceaddict,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:22:31 2015 UTC,But you're not. Your probably steering the cue. That's a flawed stroke.
billiards,3dibqm,corellianspiceaddict,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:59:54 2015 UTC,It all starts at the stance ending in the shot. Most of the time it is your stroke that's off. There is no secret remedy. It is a breakdown of your fundamentals that causes moist problems in your shot.
billiards,3dibqm,unoriginalsin,2,Thu Jul 16 20:56:49 2015 UTC,"This, this and a whole lot more of this.  Set up the longest straight in shot you can and shoot it 5000 times this month. Nothing else will work."
billiards,3dibqm,ey_bb_wan_sum_fuk,2,Thu Jul 16 15:00:29 2015 UTC,Yep. Practice makes perfect. I just need to hit it over and over. For some reason I just don't get more consistent on those shots. Practice a cut shot? See improvement. Practice my stroke? See improvement. Practice combination shots? See improvement. Practice straight shots? Fail miserably. I'm starting to think it's in my head at this point.
billiards,3dibqm,ricky_clarkson,2,Thu Jul 16 15:13:45 2015 UTC,"It is. It's very mental. You see a straight shot and it's simple. Oh you can't miss! But it's so far from the pocket... what if I miss? Oh man, I can't miss this, that would be embarrassing. I gotta hit this. Let me recheck the shot, hold on.  No chance of hitting a shot when your mind's all in up in a twist like that."

billiards,3dibqm,redditis4queers,6,Sat Jul 18 16:12:14 2015 UTC,Straight shots seem tough because they mercilessly point out your faulty technique.
billiards,3dibqm,Pip_Pip,2,Thu Jul 16 15:28:35 2015 UTC,I agree with this.  I think it's a type of cognitive bias.  Where you're ok with missing a bank because you can't make them all.  So you're more realistic with your expectations.  Where as a straight in you feel like you should make it when your technique hasn't caught up to your expectation.

I don't know much about balabushkas, mainly because I don't have the $25k it would take to get a real one. But i assume the balabushka you are looking for is the production line made from Meucci, I think. It just strikes me as a little silly to own a 400$ knock off balabushka, that when people ask you what kind of cue you have, you are going to say balabushka, then they are going to be like ""what the fuck, you had 25k to spend on a cue?!"" then you are going to have to be like ""oh hell no, I just got this knock off"" And all around this situation sounds terrible."

billiards,3dej9y,MrV2121,2,Wed Jul 15 17:43:38 2015 UTC,"The branded Balabushkas are made my Adams, a Japanese company with a pretty good reputation. Considering the discount, I would go for the Balabushka if you're set on one of these two cues. Due to the discount, this may be a rare instance where you can sell the cue for close to what you paid for it you don't like it. That won't be the case with the other cue.   All that being said, for $400 you can get a hell of a real custom cue on the used market right now. That's what I would personally do."
billiards,3dej9y,EtDM,2,Thu Jul 16 01:43:51 2015 UTC,"I'd go for the Balabushka. They were originally reproduced by Adam cues. A high quality cue company out of Japan. They were recently bought by Helmstetter cues. Another high quality cue company that's been making cues for a very long time. It's unclear whether the company still makes cues in the Japanese factory and under the Helmstetter ownership or what, but you'll get a high quality cue no matter what."

billiards,3defd8,cgc018,3,Wed Jul 15 17:01:16 2015 UTC,"My two cents; I carry a Cuetec break cue and a Players play cue. The reason I do so is only for the tip. Given my playing style, stroke mechanics, and thought patterns and such, I prefer a medium-soft layered tip rounded to a dime radius. If I were to break with it, I'd get a great deal of deflection from the soft shaft which would cause me to miss a lot of breaks, and I'd flatten my soft tip into a mushroom in about a day. So, I carry the Cuetec. It's a war club. The stiff and thick fiberglass shaft means less deflection and the hard nickel radius tip won't flatten nearly so fast."
billiards,3defd8,snowman818,2,Wed Jul 15 17:48:05 2015 UTC,"Yea, the tip flattening is another thing that I was wondering about.  So I'm understanding correctly, you only use 1 cue but have multiple shafts for it?"
billiards,3defd8,yehsper,3,Wed Jul 15 17:54:33 2015 UTC,"Two cues (Cuetech and Players) with differing shafts, tip hardness, and weight (I'm assuming)."
billiards,3defd8,snowman818,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:19:41 2015 UTC,"You'd be right. Sorry for the delay. Real life got in the way of the worthier pursuit of redditing. I have two whole cues. There used to be a rule in the APA about breaking down your stick midgame being interpreted as a forfeit. This meant that players were unable to change shafts mid-game. That rule has gone away, and instead the instruction, as I understand it, is that if you do something else to indicate you're taking your cue apart TO forfeit than it's unsportsmanlike behavior and grounds to give up the match. But shaft changing is allowed. If you go that route, get a midrange cue and keep the stock shaft as a breaker and buy a premium as a play shaft."
billiards,3defd8,warmcereal,3,Fri Jul 17 16:17:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go crazy with a breaking cue right off the bat. Spend some money on a good shooter first, if you want to save after that for a BK3, go ahead. I don't think it's necessary right away.   Also in terms of weight, don't go heavier, or too heavy on a breaker. It should be 0.5oz less or the same as your shooter."
billiards,3defd8,nsfyn55,2,Wed Jul 15 21:00:22 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on your skill level and your level of interest in developing your break as part of your game. As you progress to higher level of competition having a strong, consistent break is more important. A great analogy is a golfer's drive. You can have an excellent mid game and putting, but if you aren't capable of swatting the ball 300 yards off the tee you will be at a disadvantage against someone that can do all three. Likewise in pool you can be an excellent shot maker and position player, but a weak break will be a liability because you'll be gift wrapping more tables for players who are also excellent shot makers and position players.  You might want to work on your mechanics. At some point it will become clear to you that its the equipment holding you back. At that point you move to a specialized break cue will get you that extra oomf. They will typically be a few ounces heavier and be fitted with the hardest class of tip to ensure you are imparting the maximum amount of force on the cue ball.  I break with this guy(http://www.amazon.com/Cuetec-13-99296-Jump-Break-Cue/dp/B000K2MLDC). After a few years I can absolutely tell the difference between this and a house cue. For someone that is just getting started the difference is negligible."
billiards,3defd8,nsfyn55,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:16:15 2015 UTC,"This is a very informative answer.  Thank you for this.  From what you're saying, it sounds like I definitely will be looking for my own breaking cue.  I also saw in an old thread about how I should be looking for a low deflection cue and about how it could mess with my shooting.  Would you suggest that I get both a breaking cue and a shooting cue at the same time or would it be better to get a shooting cue and once I'm acclimated to it, I purchase a breaking cue?"
billiards,3defd8,Crazykiller789,2,Wed Jul 15 17:50:58 2015 UTC,"Do what you feel like I guess. I bought my break stick 4 months after I bought my first cue. I've stuck with the game for 10 years. I'm sure at the time people thought it was unnecessary. It depends on your disposition, how much money you have, what level of play you aspire to, and how much into gear you are. I know terrible pool players that have $2000 wrapped up in a collection of cues and I know good players that have played with the same cue for decades and break with a house stick."
billiards,3defd8,Crazykiller789,2,Wed Jul 15 18:42:57 2015 UTC,Depends on skill and what kind of tip you like on your shooting stick. If you have a soft tip and break hard with it over time it will start to shroom out which is what you try to avoid.   If you regularly shoot with a med tip you should be alright as long as your aren't killing the break. You can use more force but not unloading every thing you got.   If you shoot with a hard tip you will be fine for breaking with it.   Another thing to consider is some break sticks are jump break like my player pure X. It breaks down in the handle to become a jump stick. I do like predators bk stick more but I want my break stick to covert to a jump stick too. If you can manage to find a dymondwood jump/break id get it. I've heard nothing but great reviews about them.   If you have any questions feel free to message me.
billiards,3defd8,aahhmmgg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:58:42 2015 UTC,"I guess I would consider myself an ""above average"" player? I would normally run about 3-4 balls whenever it would be my shot.  I'm assuming that most house cues are hard tips?  That's really all that I'm actually used to using whenever I shoot at the local joints.  I don't think I really have a preference over the softness of the shooting tip though.  That break/jump cue in one is a good idea.  I've never really been able to jump the cue ball, but it could be good practice for me.  So thank you for that piece of advice."
billiards,3defd8,aahhmmgg,2,Wed Jul 15 18:21:39 2015 UTC,"I don't know what house tips have but no one cares about them so they break with them anyways.  I know a couple people in my league who have their own shooting stick and then use a house to break with.    Do you use english when you shoot?  The softer the tip the easier it is to use english, well thats how it works for me there are people who shoot with a hard tip and it works for them.    Yeah jumping is something you have to practice.  I had two friends teach me and I got the hang of it rather quickly.  Just remember you have to strike through the ball and you can't baby it or you will never get it over the ball."
billiards,3defd8,wefolas,2,Wed Jul 15 20:06:44 2015 UTC,"If you ever really want to step up your break game and are ready to invest in a quality break cue, Predator break cues are where it's at. My opinion of course. I have both a BK 2 and BK 3. I think I personally like the BK 2 better since it's a bit heavier and just feels more solid in my hands. If you ever have a chance to break with one, do it. You can definitely tell a difference between a house cue and that."
billiards,3defd8,S0cr8t3s,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:07:58 2015 UTC,"Cool! Honestly, I'm not sure on how much I would currently invest in a breaking cue.

billiards,3dena0,CanisMajoris85,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:56:48 2015 UTC,"I play in the APA, and I've never heard about not being able to say anything once they are down on the shot.  However, I do believe there is something in the rules that says you cannot approach the table without calling a timeout, including checking the line of a shot.  I believe it mentions that case specifically.  I know my captain does this sometimes when I'm shooting, and I do find it distracting, even though he thinks he being subtle.  One could also argue that by doing this, you're giving the shooter information without calling a timeout.  They could think to themselves, ""Oh, he's checking the shot.  Maybe this is not the best shot on the table."".  I'm sure you meant nothing by it, but I can see the other guy's point of view as well.  As for your third point, that's just silly.  Your player has every right to survey the table respectfully during a timeout.  Just my 2¢..."
billiards,3dena0,tone430,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:12:48 2015 UTC,"Guy was being a dick.   From the apa rule book:   COACHING As is the case in many sports, coaching is both logical and reasonable. Coaching gives the more advanced players a chance to help the newer players with their game under competitive circumstances. Coaching is defined as giving advice to your teammate during his turn at the table. Some examples of what is considered coaching are: giving advice as to which ball to shoot, where to leave the cue ball, whether to shoot soft or hard, or whether or not to useenglish. Thesetypesofcommentsareconsideredcoachingbecausethey relate to the game situation. Some examples of what is not considered coaching are: telling a player which category of balls is his, reminding him to chalk up or to mark the pocket when shooting the 8-ball, giving advice before the break, or telling a player a foul has occurred. Comments such as “good hit” or “nice shot” or answering a player’s question concerning rules is not considered coaching. Any comments made to a player when it is not his turn at the table are not considered coaching. Obviously, judgments will have to be made. Play it safe—when your opponent finishes his turn, do not continue talking to your teammates. Go to the table to begin your turn. Be courteous to your opponent. Observe the following coaching guidelines: a. Any member of the team can be the coach. The coach does not have to be designated until a time-out is called, and a different coach can be designated for each time-out. b. So that coaching does not cause excessive delays in the progress of a match, players with skill levels of 4 and up may receive one coaching per game, and players with skill levels of 2 or 3 and nonrated players may receive two coachings per game. Mark the coachings (also called time-outs) with a ‘T’ on the scoresheet to avoidconfusion. Inanyevent,takingtoomanycoachingswillnotbe consideredaviolationoftherules,althoughconsistentattemptstotake too many coachings may result in a sportsmanship violation. It is up to you to notify your opponent if he is taking a coaching he does not have coming. Disagreements are handled just as any other protest or dispute. c. Any member of the shooting team may call for a time-out. In order to avoid confusion, say it loudly and clearly enough for all to hear. d. During his turn at the table, the shooter may discuss strategy only with the coach designated for that time-out. A shooter receiving advice regarding game strategy from a fellow player, besides his designated coach, has committed a foul. A coach may get a group consensus from the other players on his team and pass it on to the shooter, but only the designated coach may pass it on. Coaching periods should not exceed one minute. Repeated complaints against offenders could lead to penalties. e. Coaches may place the cue ball for a player in a ball-in-hand situation during a time-out. Coaches may not mark the playing surface of the table (see MARKING THE TABLE in the 8-Ball Game Rules Section), or guide the shooter’s cue during the execution of the shot. The coach must leave the playing area before the shooter attempts the shot. f. Avoid disputes. When your opponent’s turn is over, go to the table and begin your turn. Do not sit and talk with your teammates, because your opponent may think you are being coached."
billiards,3dena0,gjbrown27,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:15:03 2015 UTC,"""The coach must leave the playing area before the shooter attempts the shot."" Not really sure if that meant the coach couldn't come back or make any additional comments at all."
billiards,3dena0,gjbrown27,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:51:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure either, but I think it has more to do with the coach can't be there aiding the shot. For instance, player is playing a kick shot; the person coaching can't stand there and hold their finger to the rail.    If the coach is not allowed to verbalize after the ""one minute"" timeout, it needs to be explicit in the rules, IMHO."
billiards,3dena0,nsfyn55,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:11:05 2015 UTC,"I'm an experienced APA team captain.  Although none of these appear to be in violation of anything in the APA team manual you should probably ask your League Operator(LO) these questions. The reason being that the APA allows each league to amend the rules to reflect local, historical, and personal preferences. For instance the APA team manual says you can't switch to specialty equipment or break down a cue for masse and jump shots. I've seen league by-laws that override this rule.  But even if no rules are being broken I might venture to weigh in from a pool etiquette point of view.   1) Called timeout and told my teammate...   Seems totally reasonable provided you were being timely. Simply put, think about it from the other person's perspective. They may feel like you are ""over involved"" to the point of slowing down the whole match. Its very often the case that feelings about this reflect regional opinions. Its also often because the other captain hasn't bothered to familiarize themselves with the flow of an APA match.   2) Was seated a few feet from table and moved about 7 feet ...   This is only my personal opinion but I find this highly annoying(especially if I am the shooter) whether my co-captain does it or the other captain. Firstly, I feel like many captains/coaches overuse the timeout and obsess about ""wasting"" them. If I need a better vantage point on what appears to be a tricky shot I call timeout and talk about it with the player. Often when I look closely at it I change my mind. When this happens I reinforce that my shooter made a good call and talk strategy for the rest of the pattern.   Secondly(and I'm certainly not accusing you of this), a lot of captains assert themselves too forcefully and too often into a game they aren't playing. Feeling the need to correct every shot with the one they'd take(especially with 2's and 3's). If its not absolutely game critical(e.g. the game could be over if a poor decision is made) I tend to just let them go. I leave the learning for off days and practice sessions. In other words I let the players play the game.   3) Other coach called a timeout and while they were discussing it one of my teammates ...   I am meh on this from an etiquette standpoint. If its a stoppage I don't care what the other team does."

Maybe enquire about discounts for your members and build a relationship that way.   If that works out to be beneficial then they might be more receptive to future requests for tournament sponsorship, paid advertising etc.   I think a lot of time companies are skeptical of requests for handouts because the risk is that they don't get anything in return (or just something half-areed). Making it a risk-free proposition is likely to get more interest."

Most traditional rules of any billiard game category I'm familiar with do not grant any type of a bonus shot.

billiards,3daerp,StrahansToothGap,3,Tue Jul 14 19:17:32 2015 UTC,"Blerg, I have exactly the same problem!  I think part of the problem is in the shoulder and the elbow; if you have your shoulder pulled all the way back, your elbow has a natural tendency to bend directly forward.  But if your shoulder isn't in the right position, the elbow tends to bend the forearm across the chest, which is what causes my tip to veer to the left.    I've found that I really need a good warm up game or two before I can start shooting well; so I can work on my alignments.  A good way to check is to hit the cue from one end of the table to the other and have come back on the same trajectory and land on your tip.    I'm no expert, but I have the exact same problem that you describe and this is as much as I've figured out so far.  Also, I'm shamelessly piggybacking on your post in hopes to find better advice!"
billiards,3daerp,RaithVZ,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:29:14 2015 UTC,"Ha, well nice to know that I'm not alone! :)  I think you are right in your explanation of the problem.  The arm tends to want to go across the chest, much like a tennis stroke will come across your body on the follow through.  I feel like, as for now, it is unnatural for my arm to just go straight forward."
billiards,3daerp,cosgus,3,Tue Jul 14 19:46:26 2015 UTC,"Try making sure you're keeping a lose grip on the butt. And keep your pinky off the butt like your an aristocrat holding a champagne glass.   I've been told that the pinky is attached to a muscle that makes your arm pronate as you stroke if your gripping to tightly.   To practice a straight stroke, line up a shot ON the rail where the cushion felt meets the wood. Stroke down that line and focus on keeping it straight.   Jennifer Baretta has a drill where you stroke the cue/stick into an empty water bottle on its side without touching the sides.   Also try shooting a cue ball straight into a short rail from the other side from diamond to diamond. The goal is to have the cue ball come straight back to your tip. If it doesnt you are likely shanking to one side and putting spin on the ball."
billiards,3daerp,cosgus,2,Tue Jul 14 19:47:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your tip.  I do tend to keep my pinky on the cue because I like the stability, though maybe this is a habit I should correct.    As for the water bottle exercise, I've heard of it but haven't been able to do it in actuality.  I try to simulate it when I'm practicing at the hall.  Though, I find my biggest issue is when the cue ball is there.  Just stroking at nothing I can keep it in place.  But as soon as it hits another ball, it tends to strike the ball and go off to the left.  It's weird..."
billiards,3daerp,gjbrown27,2,Tue Jul 14 19:50:42 2015 UTC,A loose grip is definitely important. You sacrifice control and precision for that stability. You cradle the butt more so than you actually take grip of it. Let it hang in your fingers. It will improve your accuracy as well as english though it may seem unnatural at first. Theres rarely a need to clench the cue hard except for the break.   It's hard to say if thats whats causing the problem but give it a shot anyway.
billiards,3daerp,OrangeTooth,2,Tue Jul 14 20:00:13 2015 UTC,This makes sense.  This is something I should work on.  Thanks!

billiards,3d8nr3,nsfyn55,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:37:16 2015 UTC,Dude I had a mizerak when I started playing seriously 10 years ago. That stick was miserable. It was severely light and the balance was way off. I continued using it as my break cue till one day the end of the shaft broke off(I didn't even know that was possible)  One of the best decisions I've made was buying a used Meucci off a shooter in my pool room(in fact I still shoot with it today). I'm not a gear head but something doesn't seem right about putting a $200 shaft on a $20 butt.
billiards,3d8nr3,level32,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:04:43 2015 UTC,I think you'll have a hard time fitting those two together. Take a look at Poison cues. It's a Predator sister company. Good bang-for-your-buck cues. You can easily upgrade to a Predator shaft later.
billiards,3d8nr3,col4bin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:37:12 2015 UTC,I don't know if you're looking for predator specifically but I was in the same spot as you a few weeks ago. I went into the store wanting to buy a 314 shaft for my butt but ended up getting a great deal on a full low deflection cue and I couldn't be happier. Ended up grabbing a Raid made by falcon cues. Out the door for $120 and it shoots just as well as a 314 which the shaft would run you ~$240
billiards,3d8nr3,rocksauce,-2,Tue Jul 14 19:13:34 2015 UTC,The only thing the butt does is be dead weight. That being said I've shot with some cues that are pretty poorly weighted. If you like the balance get just a shaft.
billiards,3d8nr3,Pilfered,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:29:07 2015 UTC,That isn't true at all. I disagree with your entire thought on the purpose of the cue.   Put the same shaft on different cues and they will feel and shoot completely differently.   The balance and stroke of the shot is not coming from the shaft alone. People who think you can just put a shaft on anything and it will shoot significantly better are only taking into account the deflection and cue ball contact.
billiards,3d8nr3,corellianspiceaddict,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:49:03 2015 UTC,FINALLY! SOMEONE WHO GETS IT! THE SHAFT DOESN'T MEAN BETTER HIT. THE BUTTE DOES. I keep trying to tell people the stroke starts at the butte end. All of your feel and hit comes from there. Thanks for being smart!

billiards,3d5c68,parlarry,3,Mon Jul 13 17:37:12 2015 UTC,"In guessing you could MAYBE get the absolute bare bones worst cloth for around 100, but if you take the game even remotely seriously you don't want that crap. Also, unless you've installed cloth yourself, I would almost be certain you're going to have to pay someone to install it, it really is a difficult process that could completely ruin your cloth before you even get to shoot on it.   But  the main reason I would be skeptical is just how shady the guy seems to be. The lies about pricing and saying it's easy to re-cloth would make me wonder what else he's hiding. Maybe he really just needs to get it off his hands that bad, but I'd be weary."
billiards,3d5c68,TheOneCalledAtlas,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:44:05 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely on point. Bottom of the line cloth plays slow as fuck. As far as the rest of it, I don't think the dude is being shady, he just wants to move it. Realistically, cloth is not super difficult to apply, and you absolutely can get it for $90. Neither of those are technically falsified, they're just the bare minimum truth.  Brunswick is a good brand, it's an 8ft slate, and 550 is a good price for that alone, discounting the name. You're looking at a couple three hundred for good felt applied professionally, and if you're sweating $300, buy the table, put it together and pinch some pennies til you can get it refelted.  All in all, I say go for it.  E: Check the fuck out of the slate and wood for cracks, fractures, rot, warping, water damage, all of it. Bring a fucking caliper and a level if you have to."

EDIT: didn't see adjusted price, lowered your BATNA to $300"
billiards,3d5c68,CreeDorofl,2,Mon Jul 13 23:51:37 2015 UTC,"Although he's downplaying the cost and effort of re-felting, $550 for an 8-foot Brunswick is a decent deal.   The cheap ones are ~$2000 new, but that includes the felt, which his $550 price does not. So a more fair comparison is $2000 new vs. $650 used.  New tables get shipped and installed for $300 flat by professionals who have done it a zillion times. That's a steal. For this, you're getting free delivery but setup by (presumably) an amateur, who will charge who knows how much.  $100 for a cloth is reasonable. Simonis is the nice cloth and is $300, Championship brand is very common for 7 and 8 foot tables and is either $100 for their cheapo stuff, or $200 for their nice stuff. IMO their nice cloth is more than good enough.  8 footers on Ebay seem to go for around $750-800.  My advice - go there, have him put the slate on the basement floor or somewhere level. Bring a level and just confirm it's not warped. Any other problem can be dealt with, parts can be replaced, but if the slate is warped in any way the table is worthless and there's no fixing it.  If the slate seems ok, buy it, have it brought to the house, and have a professional install Championship cloth on it... either the $120 'Invitational' stuff, or the 'Tour Edition' which is $220. Not the cheapo Saturn."
billiards,3d5c68,rocksauce,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:53:11 2015 UTC,"Craigslist guy aside, it is a pretty good value. Many times moving a table will require anew piece of felt. It can only be stretched and stapled a few times. Even if you don't buy this one keep in mind you will most likely pay someone to move it, set it up and felt it. In my opinion the felting and initial set up are easy. It is the shimming, leveling and waxing the three slate pieces that require real skill to do nicely, since good enough isn't a thing to most of us when it comes to a level playing surface. I paid 300$ for two guys to move, set up and come back after it settled to adjust it when I bought my table. That did not include a new piece of felt."
billiards,3d5c68,wordysanchez,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:29:09 2015 UTC,Totally worth it.  Brunswick uses good solid slate and the table is solid wood. You can get some Simonis and really trick this out for less than 800 bucks total. I would do it.  Moving it isn't difficult and if you have an eye for details you can felt it yourself and level it no sweat.
billiards,3d5c68,fadedcheese,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:36:33 2015 UTC,I'd be wary of this table. It being already apart you can't check if the rails are dead or warped. The slate you'd need to check for cracks chips and various other things. The pockets should be easy to see if they are actually new. It also looks like it's a bit older and has some cosmetic wear. You don't know how long this table has been apart and what conditions it's been exposed to without seeing it all assembled. I've seen tables subject to a lot of water damage that looked fine in pieces and it was only when they were assembled you could tell. The $550 asking price is roughly around where a lot of these mid range 8ft tables are priced. You can normally talk the seller down because it is far and away a buyers market with these because they really are only a home table.

billiards,3d2g5q,FLORI_DUH,3,Mon Jul 13 14:39:11 2015 UTC,"Three-ball. Rack 3 balls in a triangle, break from the kitchen and count how many shots (including the break) it takes you to sink all balls.  Lowest score wins whatever you're betting.  Horse.  Like basketball's game of Horse, but with billiards trick shots.  You've gotta describe the parameters of the shot, then you get 2 attempts to do it.  If you make it, your opponent gets 2 tries to match it.  Sometimes we'll play where if you describe it but fail to execute it, the incoming player still gets 2 attempts, but gets double points for successfully executing it.  I also believe your typical 8-ball, 9-ball, 10-ball, one-pocket, and 14.1 continuous are ""fun bar games"", right :)  Sometimes we will just do drill competitions.  One example: set up the balls like so, take ball in hand anywhere on the table and make as many as you can without missing.  Whoever gets the most balls wins.  If you get too good at that, try a slightly harder layout.  Or try this one (NOTE: this one gets really hard if you don't allow the cue ball or object ball to hit any rails)."

Any balls made on the break don't need to be in order.  Scratch is an automatic loss.  We played a few different versions of this, and scored it like golf where par would be 4 strokes."

billiards,3d2g5q,elint,3,Mon Jul 13 00:42:43 2015 UTC,That's exactly how we started but modified it a little. We found that 3 ball made it easy for people to tie over and over.  With 4 balls and a numerical order we usually had a winner every set.

If there was a tie for best score, money stays in the pot and you add another dollar for the next round.

I think it's a good learning experience for all amateur skill levels because there is always more than 1 way to run a table, so it makes you approach the shot/table differently."
billiards,3d2g5q,warmcereal,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:52:29 2015 UTC,"A ""Fun"" game is a variation of Kelly pool (secretly draw a number from 1 - 15 and that is your ball) where instead of trying to pot your ball first you try to keep your ball alive and pot it last.  It is fun because if your number ball is in a dangerous position, you can try to make it look like you are trying to pot it but mucked up the shot.  You also have to try to work out which ball your opponents have and try to pot theirs before they pot yours.    Even if they pot yours, you keep on playing trying to hunt down their ball stopping them from a double victory i.e. to be the player whose ball is the very last one remaining on the table thus revealing your strategic awesomeness   :)"

Once the three players points are gone he is out that round.  Rack a normal eight ball rack. Break the rack with a random player. Once the balls are broken, the first player in rotation gets ball-in-hand. Each player takes one shot, working the way through the rotation. as shots are missed, points are lost and players will fall out until it comes down to the final two players. re-racks and breaks are done until all players play out their points rendering a win.  To make it fun each player can buy points at the beginning of the round. we usually do 5 bucks a point and 15 bucks a player. We usually do 6 players a round."
billiards,3d2g5q,wordysanchez,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:26:11 2015 UTC,"If you have access to a plastic ""pill bottle"" (a.k.a. the ""peas""), you can play a very fun game which helps hone your skill at understanding tangent lines and table geometry and position play. This is a game I was shown at a very young age when I first began to play pool, and it was very difficult as a new player, but it quickly began to improve my understanding of cue ball movement after it strikes an object ball.   Bottle Pool  Group size: Any number of players can participate in a game much like a ring game. Shake the peas out to determine initial shooting order, redraw as often as you like to keep the order fresh and interesting. You can even play by yourself and keep track of how many innings it takes you to reach 25 points. Challenge yourself to beat your all-time best score.  Goal: Be the first player to reach exactly 25 points to win the game. This game can easily be adjusted to handicap players in the same way 1P is handicapped. Simply adjust the number of balls required for a player to win so that a more advanced player needs more points to win the game than a less-experienced player.   Scoring: There are only three balls used in the game of Bottle Pool. The cueball, the 1 ball, and the 2 ball. In addition to the pool balls, an empty plastic ""pill bottle"" is used on the table as well. The pill bottle can be any heavy plastic bottle (not glass, duh!) which can be stood upside down and provide a reasonably durable and strong game piece which will withstand frequent strikes by the cueball and other balls. on the table. The traditional bottle type used are the heavy red plastic bottles which contain the numbered peas used in many pool games. The peas are removed from the bottle and are not used in the primary version of Bottle Pool. An interesting variation of the game uses the peas inside the bottle and the peas fall out when the bottle is knocked over which can result in bonus points for any peas which fall out and remain on the playing surface of the table. The common rules just use the empty bottle.   Starting the game: Three different spots are used in Bottle Pool. The head spot, the mid spot, and the foot spot are all used. At the start of the game, the 1 and 2 balls are spotted in-line on the foot spot. The 1 ball is placed on the spot, and the 2 is frozen in-line behind the 1. The cueball is placed inside the kitchen for the break shot. The empty pill bottle is spotted upside down on the head spot. The mid spot is empty at the start of the game.   Points are scored in a couple of different ways in Bottle Pool. My understanding is that Bottle Pool originated in Europe as an alternative to snooker and was played on the large snooker tables. It is most fun to play Bottle Pool in America on the largest table you have access to, but the game is enjoyable on bar box tables as well. The game gets considerably more difficult the larger the table is. I think the game pace is better on the large tables because it becomes very rare for a ""break and run"" on the large tables. A break and run is much more common on bar boxes. Points are awarded for legally pocketing either the 1 or 2 balls, or by knocking the upside down bottle over in certain circumstances.   According to the lore I have been told, the only ""respectable and honourable"" way to score points in Bottle Pool is by knocking the bottle over with the cueball. The stories my elders have passed along indicate that it was considered a ""lesser"" shot when a player chose to score a point by pocketing a ball in order to remain at the table.   The traditional rules state that the 1 and 2 balls are wild, and as long as either is struck by the cueball, they counted for points if they are pocketed anywhere on the table. They are considered ""wild"", and after they are struck by the cueball, a ball must either be pocketed or be driven to a rail like in modern BCA rules. If no ball reaches a rail, then a traditional foul is called resulting in a penalty of 5 points. Cueball scratches are a foul and cost you 5 points as well.   The bottle is the primary objective in Bottle Pool, and it can be knocked over in a variety of ways which have different results for the shooter. Traditionally, the goal of bottle pool is to carom the cueball off either the 1 or 2 ball and have the cueball knock over the upside down bottle. This earns the shooter 5 points. If the bottle is knocked over by either the 1 or 2 ball, this is a foul and costs the shooter 5 points. The bottle is a rather inconvenient obstacle at times, and the shooter will often find himself having to cue very near the upside down bottle and at times the bottle will completely obstruct the most desirable angle to strike the cueball. The shooter must be extremely careful with their clothing and their body when cueing near the bottle. If the shooter causes the bottle to fall over for any reason whatsoever, that is considered a foul and costs the shooter 5 points. Even if it is clothing brushing the bottle, the cue touching the bottle, or an errant hand or arm or belly knocking the bottle over... this is still considered a foul and costs the shooter 5 points. The only way to earn points by knocking the bottle over is by successfully caroming the cueball into the bottle after legally hitting either the 1 or 2 ball with the cueball. All other circumstances which cause the bottle to fall over will cost the player at the table 5 points. If the cueball causes the bottle to fall over before touching either the 1 or 2 ball, this is a foul and costs you 5 points as well. This generally happens when a player shoots at an object ball and misses it completely, or when the unfortunate miscue happens and the cueball squirts over and knocks the bottle over before touching an object ball first. This is a foul.   To remain at the table and continue shooting, a player must legally earn a point with each shot. Earning points can be accomplished by potting the 1 or 2 ball. The 1 ball is worth 1 point, the 2 ball is worth 2 points. Upon pocketing a ball, the ball is immediately spotted at the closest open spot. Balls pocketed in the foot corner pockets come up and are spotted on the foot spot. Balls pocketed in the side pockets are spotted on the mid spot. If the normal spotting location is occupied or obstructed, then the ball is spotted on the closest open spot. If a ball needs to be spotted on a spot that is already taken or obstructed, then the appropriate spot is the first open spot closest to the foot spot.   Potting a ball to earn a point is considered the weakest and least-respectable way to earn a point and remain at the table. Potting a ball is considered a shot of desperation and is regarded as evidence of ignorance and inexperience in the ways of gentleman pool. It is frowned upon by the elders, and should only be attempted with shame and guilt acknowledged by the shooter. No pride should ever be expressed when potting a ball. Potting balls is the bottom-feeding way to remain at the table. Much scoffing and jeering should rightly occur when this type of tactic is employed during Bottle Pool.   The only respectable alternative to legally knocking the bottle over with the cueball is by achieving a successful ""billiard"" of the 1 and 2 balls with the cueball. Shooting the cueball and making contact with both the 1 and 2 balls is a ""billiard"" and earns the shooter 1 point and they remain at the table to continue shooting. You can hit both balls in any order you like to earn a billiard, but simply causing the 1 and 2 to hit each other does not constitute a billiard. The cueball itself must strike both balls to earn a billiard.   Regarding the bottle: Each time the bottle is knocked over, it must immediately be stood back up on its neck before the next shot is taken. There are some rules about how and where the bottle is replaced. When the bottle is knocked over onto the playing surface of the table, it is tipped back upside down by carefully pivoting the bottle on the edge of its lip so it stands immediately back upside down. Traditionally, the bottle is not picked up and rotated and set back down on the table as this allows for the player to basically have some discretion as to where exactly the bottle will be placed. It is tipped back up as carefully and precisely as possible so that the bottle now stands immediately next to where the opening of the bottle was facing when it stopped moving. The bottle cannot be intentionally touched while it is in motion. You must allow the bottle to cease rolling or spinning before tipping it back up. Any intentional disruption of the bottle while it is moving results in a foul and costs you 5 points and you do not earn the five points you would have earned had no interference taken place. We generally disregard unintentional contact with the bottle if it is knocked toward the shooter by a fast moving cueball. If the bottle was clearly going to be knocked over legally and it happens to strike the player after it is knocked down, we generally give the shooter credit for a well played bottle shot and ignore the unintentional interference."
billiards,3d2g5q,gabrielleigh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:13:58 2015 UTC,"Special bottle circumstances: If the bottle is knocked off the table surface onto the floor, the bottle is spotted at the farthest open spot from the head spot. If the bottle is knocked INTO a pocket, this is cause for celebration and congratulations by the other players in the game. A pocketed bottle (which is knocked over legally by the cueball first) results in the shooter earning 10 points and remaining at the table. A pocketed bottle is spotted at the farthest open spot from the head spot. A pocketed bottle which was knocked over illegally by the numbered balls or by contact with the shooter is still a foul which costs the shooter 5 points. It is spotted in the same manner as described above. The rarest and greatest achievement in Bottle Pool is to legally knock over the bottle with the cueball and have it come to rest standing upright on its bottom end. This is an extremely rare event in Bottle Pool, and I have only witnessed it happening about ten times in my entire career. Getting a legal hit on the bottle and causing it to flip over and stand upright results in an immediate win of the game. The bottle must come to rest upright on the playing surface of the table to be counted as a game-winner. If it comes to rest upright anywhere else, it is simply counted normally as a 5 point bottle shot.   Ideally, the ""perfect game"" of Bottle Pool would consist of the player caroming off the 1 or 2 ball at the beginning of the game, causing the cueball to go 2 or 3 rails and knocking over the bottle. Subsequently, the player would then make four additional legal bottle shots to earn exactly 25 points to win the game. Five consecutive legal bottle shots is considered a ""break and run"", and is worthy of humble praise and acknowledgement from all of the other players in the game. On bar boxes, this is a common occurrence and is not particularly noteworthy. On 9 and 10 foot tables, this is a much more special event and should be acknowledged appropriately by all players and spectators.   One of the most important rules of Bottle Pool is that in order to win the game, a player must legally earn EXACTLY 25 POINTS. After all balls and bottles come to rest, the player must be sitting at exactly 25 points to win the game. Earning more than 25 points results in a ""Bust"" and the player then goes back to having exactly 1 point. If a player busts after making a legal point, they remain at the table and can continue shooting but their points are reduced to 1. A bust is a very dangerous event and should be carefully avoided at all costs. Examples of ""busting"": A player has 24 points at the start of their turn. They shoot and pocket the 1 ball, but the cueball continues to roll and makes contact with the 2 ball resulting in a billiard of 1 additional point along with the 1 point they earned from pocketing the 1 ball. This puts their point total at 26, thus causing them to ""bust"" and they return to a total of 1 point but remain at the table to continue shooting. Pocketing the 2 ball when they only need one point will cause a bust as well. Knocking the bottle over legally when they have more than 20 points will also cause a bust. Causing the bottle to be legally knocked upright will still result in winning the game even if the player was sitting at more than 20 points when the bottle was struck legally.   Anyhow, this is a fun and different game that my friends and I love to play on the Gold Crown tables in my favorite pool room. You can easily create some gambling fun with this game by assigning a value to the balls. For example, you can gamble by making the point difference at the end of the game be worth a certain amount ""per ball"". If each ball is worth 10 cents, and at the end of the game you only have 15 points, you would pay the winner of the game 10 cents for each ball you needed to win the game. You would owe the winner a total of $1.00. This is a good format for people who prefer to play cheap because they can minimize their losses by earning as many points as possible during the games that they eventually lose. You can also use a simple format where each game is worth a certain amount from each player which is paid to the winner. For example, whoever wins gets $2.00 from each other player in the game. Different players prefer different formats, so you can choose whatever way sounds the best for the group you want to play with.   If the group is very advanced, you can stretch the point total out farther to make the games last longer. 25 points is the standard goal, but you can bump it to 50 points for groups of very strong players, or drop it to 10 points for groups of less experienced players. The game is easily adaptable for different circumstances and lots of ""house rules"" can be adopted to make the game for fun.   Examples of house rules. Leave the pills in the bottle when it is placed upside down. Each pill that comes out of the bottle is worth one bonus point if the bottle is knocked down legally by the cueball and remains on the playing surface of the table. If the bottle is knocked down illegally by the object balls or by contact by the player, each pill that falls out is an additional penalty point along with the standard 5 point foul penalty."

billiards,3d0puh,fadedcheese,4,Mon Jul 13 19:36:00 2015 UTC,"The other guy was getting ""weight"" or a spot. So for him the 8 ball is the same as the 9. This is one way to even the game of 9 ball for players not in the same skill range. Normally it can either be the ""call 8"" which has to be called and not just lucked in or the ""wild 8"" which can be slopped in just like the 9 and still count. This can be done all the way down to even the one ball if the game is way out of line. It can be multiple balls too. Like the 7 and 8 ball or ""the last 3"". If the player can make one of the last 3 remaining balls on the table the player wins."

At the pro level this can mean what pool halls to use and what table at that location. With weight. it could be games on the wire, a ball spot like this, who gets to break, and a ton of other things.

billiards,3czimd,PublicEnemaNumberOne,3,Sun Jul 12 05:01:55 2015 UTC,An 8' table is too big for that room unless you use short cues. You maybe slightly better off with a 7' bar box. If you buy one used you will most likely need to replace both cloth and rails as well as balls.
billiards,3czimd,Tranejam,2,Sun Jul 12 06:17:08 2015 UTC,"I think that room might be a little too small for a 7' table actually. You would occasionally run into instances where you'd need a short cue to shoot(which is fine for casual play like you stated) But if you were to put anything else into the room, it would get really crowded really fast. If you're certain nothing else will be in the room, I'd go for a used 7' table with slate. Probably could get a ""valley"" brand table for cheap. Cloth isn't super difficult to lay, I redid my own, but if you get a decent deal on the table, I would look into paying a reputable company to move the table and install it. Slate is heavy, you don't want to lose hardware during the move, and they'll properly level it and won't band anything up during the whole process. It's money well spent in my eyes."
billiards,3czimd,joeprentice90,2,Sun Jul 12 07:55:03 2015 UTC,"If you try to cram an 8' table in there it will almost surely be frustrating to play on because you'll need short cues and still won't be able to shoot some shots. Most cues are 58""-59"" so the general rule is to add 5' to each side. Doing this you'll see that even a 7' table is just a tad shy. This would be with nothing else in the room. If you try and put things like a table for drinks or room to stand outta the way you start to make it more cramped.  So I'd stay with a 7'(bar box) Diamond and Valley are the more popular brands. You can get Valley tables used on craigslist pretty cheap. I'd suggest getting a table guy to move and set it up. These tables tend to be a one piece slate so can be harder to move. He'll level and adjust it, making it much more enjoyable to play on. They can charge around $200-$500 especially if it's some remote lake house that they have to drive way out of the way.  If you are determined to do it yourself you can and there are videos on YouTube showing you how. You can even look at some beforehand to see if it's something you'd want to tackle. If you find one on CL you can always post it here and people will tell you if you are getting a good deal or if they see a flaw in the table."

billiards,3cxmm3,dirtyduo,3,Sat Jul 11 18:14:44 2015 UTC,"There's rarely a time where I'll shoot bottom inside english. But I did have a tough shot to set up for an 8 ball one time where I had to draw to miss scratching in the side packet, yet still needed to get the cue ball up table. Draw brought the ball back enough to miss the side, and the english spun enough off the rail to bring the cue ball up table. The shot came off flawless, and I had to hammer it a bit to get the action. I had never seen, or thought of that shot before, so I got an awesome rush of feeling like I invented something. I know I didn't ""actually"" invent something, but in the realm of my game, I did."
billiards,3cxmm3,RyanGoslingsCock,3,Sun Jul 12 00:45:20 2015 UTC,"There was a second time I had to use that shot, but I over cut it by a quarter diamond, probably from the squirt and throw or simply my stroke."
billiards,3cxmm3,RyanGoslingsCock,2,Sun Jul 12 00:46:50 2015 UTC,"I typically use low inside when cutting a ball near the rail.  In this picture, you're shooting the 10. Hitting center ball will send the cue ball to the 1 and center high goes to the 2. High left will go to the 3, center left to the 4 and low left to 5."
billiards,3cxmm3,petermgates,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:34:03 2015 UTC,I would have to disagree here.  High left would put forward and left spin causing a hit on the 5 ball.  Low left would be the 3.
billiards,3cxmm3,petermgates,2,Mon Jul 13 17:14:14 2015 UTC,"I will concede that I should have placed the 10 closer to the rail in the diagram because it makes a difference.  However I stand by my assertion that the spin will have more of an effect if you hit low. It's somewhat counter intuitive but that's what I have found to be the case.  I was shown this by a great straight pool player and if you look up shot 22 from 99 Critical Shots, there is agreement there also.  That being said, I will set it up tonight and report back if I am wrong."
billiards,3cxmm3,S0cr8t3s,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:44:10 2015 UTC,Please do!  I was thinking about it and center left (having the most possible sidespin) would maybe be the one to hit the 5.

billiards,3cxmm3,CursedLlama,4,Mon Jul 13 17:52:11 2015 UTC,"I guess I kind of look at it like chipping in golf. I line myself up, consider the implications of squirt/deflection and then when I get down on the ball I am only thinking about speed. Some shots are obviously more forgiving, as far as leave is concerned, but when it really counts you have to be precise.   Depending on the length of the shot, there is always a chance that your bottom english will be nullified by friction with the cloth. Thats why I look at it like chipping because you have to give it just the right amount of speed. This takes a lot of practice to master but it can be alot of fun to mess around with. My suggestion would be to set up a shot during open tables and just start experimenting. You might be amazed with what you can do if you think less and try to just feel the shot."

billiards,3cxmm3,wefolas,2,Sun Jul 12 00:49:40 2015 UTC,I'm far from mastering it but it's great to stop/slow down the cue ball when you know if is going to make contact with a rail after hitting an object. So it's useful for keeping the cue ball in tight spaces for shape.

Low English imparts forward spin in the object ball, which will also push the object ball outside.  The two combined will really throw the object toward the outside so you have to adjust your aim toward the inside.    Depending on the speed/distance of the shot you might also have to compensate for the cue-ball's path being pulled more inside, especially if you have to elevate the cue at all.   Low inside is a fickle bitch so try to avoid it if possible.  High inside has fewer complications."
billiards,3cxmm3,x99percent,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:50:08 2015 UTC,Can you explain to me the difference between inside and outside? I'm sure I use both since I use all 8 directions on the cue ball (or at least attempt to) but I just don't understand what you guys mean by inside and outside.
billiards,3cxmm3,CursedLlama,2,Sun Jul 12 00:53:56 2015 UTC,"If you're cutting a ball to the right, then right spin = inside english, left spin = outside english... and vice-versa."
billiards,3cxmm3,agntkay,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:03:44 2015 UTC,Got it. Thanks!
billiards,3cxmm3,Not2BeEftWith,2,Sun Jul 12 01:20:37 2015 UTC,"right spin need not necessarily be inside english and left spin = outside english all the time. Inside/Outside depends on the angle you are cutting the ball,   if you have to hit (cut) to the left of center on the object ball to make it (meaning cutting the object ball to the right), then using right english is inside english and left = outside.  if you have to hit to the right of center on the object ball then you are cutting the ball to the left, so left = inside and right = outside english."
billiards,3cxmm3,ricky_clarkson,2,Sun Jul 12 02:49:03 2015 UTC,"Imagine the angle created by the path of the cue ball and the path of the object ball in a cut shot.  Inside is the side that has the acute (smaller) angle.  The cue ball is on the head spot, object ball is on the foot spot.  If you're trying to cut the object ball into the right corner pocket then inside = right, outside = left. If you're trying to make the ball in the left corner then it's the opposite- inside = left, outside = right.    Inside/outside English will throw the object ball in the opposite direction.  If you're aiming to make the object ball center pocket but you need to use inside English then you need to adjust your aim toward the inside of the pocket to compensate for the object ball being thrown outside.   Draw/follow has a similar effect- draw throws outside, follow throws inside.  That's why low inside is a bitch- inside throws the object ball outside and low also throws the object ball outside so the two combined have a more dramatic effect on the path of the object ball.    Conversely- outside English throws inside and low English throws outside.  Low outside requires no adjustment for throw because low and outside cancel each other's effects (same with high inside).  In case that wasn't enough to think about- don't forget to compensate for the deflection of the cue-ball (yes, even with your LD shaft) and the cue-ball being pulled in the direction of left/right English.  Both of which will (of course) depend on the speed of the shot.    Side English adds many complications.  Avoid it by playing for position on shots that won't require it."

billiards,3ct3ge,Lord_Napalm,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:51:23 2015 UTC,"I kinda feel that is too easy.  It's always been my complaint with hard-break games -- they all begin with an element of randomness.  Breaking the balls well is a skill.  Making 6 balls on the break is not.  I understand this will normalize with time but many contests the average player will take part in don't allow one player to overcome a few ""lucky"" breaks by the other."
billiards,3ct3ge,khoker,2,Fri Jul 10 16:52:43 2015 UTC,"It's a common debate, how to handle the break in the pool world. It's kind of strange actually.   If they make the racks and tables VERY consistent, making the same ball every time is routine. Even in the hard break games. Look at Shane Van Boening's 10-ball break... 2nd row ball in the side pocket... every time (well, they did the stats in one event and it was like 70% of the time).   Some people complain this makes it boring, and encourages soft breaking, and now there's this movement to use no magic rack and put the 9 on the spot (like in recent mosconi cups) to encourage hard breaks and bring back the randomness.  If you watch this match with Shaw, he actually breaks worse in the sense that he is hitting harder and not getting the same ball in as reliably. With Ignacio, watch the 2nd row ball on the right side... very consistent with it.  I won't say barbox 8ball doesn't have luck affecting the outcome, but to me the luck isn't in the break (where both players should make a specific ball 80%+ with the magic rack) it's in the random layout afterwards, where one guy gets a Mission Impossible runout and starts out frozen to the head or foot rail. Especially if that guy is forced to go by take-what-you-make rules."
billiards,3ct3ge,khoker,2,Fri Jul 10 20:36:18 2015 UTC,"Very insightful reply.  And I think it's fascinating to learn there is some backlash on using the magic rack (at that level of play).      I guess it's not unlike chess in that regard.  Some variants have developed to put more randomness into what was otherwise becoming very boring/static opening sequences (e.g., Chess960)."

billiards,3ct3ge,TheJawsofIce,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:54:15 2015 UTC,"He hits the shot with low inside (low left). The left is just to help it travel around the rails, it's the draw that causes the curve... it's a somewhat thin hit so at first it travels along the usual tangent line, then the draw kicks in and sucks the cue ball back a tiny bit, curving it away from the original path."
billiards,3cup4c,E-L-Y-K,2,Fri Jul 10 22:45:26 2015 UTC,"I do a lot of these upgrades for the local league players who show up with Sportcraft, Mizerak, and other economical brands of cues with the screw-on style of tip.   The biggest issue with the screw on tips is that the ferrule is made from an extremely poor quality of very cheap plastic. The plastic used in these ferrules is completely non-porous, which means the glue used to glue on a good tip cannot soak into the ferrule and ""grip"" it very well. I see a lot of people who simply unscrew the original tip, and then superglue a nicer tip onto the plastic ferrule. They generally play with it for a short period of time and then their nice new tip pops off. The glue simply doesn't bond well with that kind of plastic.   The other issue is that there is a small threaded brass insert inside the ferrule where the tip screws into it. This brass insert has a hollow hole going down into it, and the hole creates an airspace inside the ferrule which reduces the already poor bond the tip will have with the ferrule.   The most reliable way to upgrade is to have a cuesmith replace the ferrule with a new composite ferrule that provides a stronger material with much better adhesive bond capabilities than the cheap plastic used in the screw-on tip ferrule. Ferrule replacement is generally about a $20 to $30 job in many areas of the country, and the Kamui will end up probably doubling that cost due to the expense of the tip. To do the total upgrade, you'll likely have a $50 bill tied up in doing it.   You can simply have the Kamui installed on your existing ferrule, but I'd give it about an 80% chance of popping off within the first year if you go that route."
billiards,3cup4c,gabrielleigh,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:17:31 2015 UTC,Ferrule would be the white plastic piece the tip screws into? Am I better off just buying a player brand stick and getting a kamui installed on that cue? I mean I don't mind my stick.. It is straight and smoother than bar cues. My only concern is when I hit with some power I feel some vibration or something. Not sure if that is good or normal?
billiards,3cup4c,gabrielleigh,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:34:28 2015 UTC,"Every cue feels a little different when you strike the ball. If the feel seems bad or weird to you, then it might be good to try out some other brands and see if you notice any that feel particularly good compared to your current cue. Every player has slightly different preferences and what ever feels the best to you will likely help you play your best pool. Sometimes cues vibrate or buzz when parts come loose such as the joint collar or joint pin or ferrule or weight bolt. I'd have a cue repairman inspect it to see if anything is loose. If all the parts are good, then the cue may just have an unfavorable harmonic quirk that makes it vibrate in an annoying way. Try holding the cue in different spots when you shoot to see if the vibration changes."

billiards,3cup4c,DreadrickTaitum,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:54:49 2015 UTC,I would get a Players HXT from Seybert's http://www.seyberts.com/catalog/Pure_X_Play_Cues-10526.html They are a very good value. They also come with a Kamui black soft tip installed. If you order from Seybert's you can use the Seybert's bucks to get a free case. If you use the code APARULES you get a 5% discount.
billiards,3cuoi1,S0cr8t3s,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:40:33 2015 UTC,"There is a big difference in the cost to have a Kamui installed depending on what part of the country you live in. The manufacturer of Kamui tips has a business agreement you have to sign that is very similar to the dealer agreements that you have to sign to become an authorized dealer for almost any other product out there. Kamui does research to determine what price you should charge for a tip and they try to figure out how to sell the most tips and make the biggest margin per tip that they can. All businesses do this, and Kamui is extremely successful at this and has a huge market for their premium priced product.   Kamui makes you sign agreements to work with them within this model, and some dealers adhere to these guidelines and others simply purchase the product direct from the manufacturer and resell them at a tiny markup and focus on making their money on sheer sales volume instead of the markup on each individual tip.   I can't really discuss the details of this due to my relationship with them, but it is a very common agreement that is certainly not unique with Kamui by any means. With most products, there is a wholesale cost, a MSRP (manufacturers suggested retail price), and other guidelines for pricing that attempt to strike a balance which maintains good sales and reasonable profits.   Labor charges for installing a tip should generally be pretty consistent. Some tips do actually take slightly longer to install because they are not pre-domed, or they are extremely hard and require considerably more effort to shape them and prepare them for use. The difference in labor is about a minute or so, and I don't think it really warrants any significant increase in labor charges for installation. For example, a LePro tip takes about 30 seconds to trim and shape after it is glued on. It comes pre-domed, and the leather is fairly soft and is quickly brought to the desired shape. A Samsara super hard break tip takes a couple of minutes to trim and shape because it has no dome to begin with and it is like trying to shape a piece of granite stone. So there are some legitimate differences in the sheer amount of labor it takes to install different tips, but like I said earlier it should be a minimal increase in labor costs for the more difficult tips (Kamui is slightly more difficult to install due to the layers and the extremely thick nature of the tip).   Purchasing the tip yourself will probably be the best deal in this case, and $15 for installation labor is on the high end from what I have heard from people who have been around the country and had work done all over. It is about a five minute job to install a tip, and that labor rate averages out to roughly the same wages a neurosurgeon probably makes.   If the guy does great work and provides you with a good tip install then his rate might be worth it. That is something people just have to decide on themselves. He may literally be the only guy in the whole area who can even do the job, so he can command a higher price simply by being the only one who can do the job?"
billiards,3cuoi1,gabrielleigh,-2,Fri Jul 10 23:04:43 2015 UTC,"It is about a five minute job to install a tip, and that labor rate averages out to roughly the same wages a neurosurgeon probably makes.   Even if you were on some sort of assembly line with enough tips to keep you working 12 jobs an hour 40 hours a week, that still wouldn't approach the $700k median annual salary for a neurosurgeon.  Let's ignore overhead and the fact that nobody puts on 25000 tips a year."

A year ago, I decided to go the way like you described. I paid 45 dollars total for a kamui soft tip replacement on my lucasi cue. The end results were many dents on the shaft, scratches on my ferrule, and a poorly cut tip. It's 100% done WITHOUT a lathe.  Last month, I went to another place for a tip change. The guy there was going to charge me 10 dollars for labor, so I thought it was pretty good. However, he then said his Triangle Hard tips (triangles have one hardness... what triangle hard -_-) were 10 dollars when you can get them for a dollar online. He also said his kamui mediums were 15, but given the price of kamuis being in the 20s and him overcharging for the triangle, he simply couldn't be trusted. After inquiring more about his service, he got fed up and refused to change my tip.  Custom Cuemaker for R.J. Hsu also overcharges... 50 for a G2 tip change... ridiculous. So the bottom line is buy your own tip and pay for service. When you buy your own tip, you know what you're getting. If you let them supply you with you tip, you could be getting some cheap tip instead of the authentic ones. Mooris are known to have many copycats.  First place was Gotham billiards brooklyn.

Kamui and many of the other new gourmet tip companies engage in price fixing and go out of their way to punish distributors for actually trying to offer consumers a fair price for a tiny piece of leather. They also advertise high MSRP's for the tips to give the repair guys incentive to push the product. Instead of charging you anywhere from $15 to $25 for a tip job with a tip that costs anywhere from $.50 to maybe $5, they are charging $50 for a kamui/g2/predator/whatever and walking away with $35 profit. It's simple economics for the tip guys especially when you consider the presence these brands have established in the minds of amateur players. They are willing to pay $20+ for a tip that is so shitty that the company had to come out with a proprietary scuffer (that costs almost $50) that wouldn't destroy the shitty tip that would glaze over if you didn't apply a $25 piece of cosmetic foundation to it every 5 shots, so why not charge 'em what they are willing to pay.

billiards,3cr3xh,gotwired,2,Fri Jul 10 11:52:02 2015 UTC,I believe camodude was referring to OP's example of solids (7 ball) and that the open table rules apply regardless of what the intended ball is (solid or stripe).
billiards,3cr3xh,daleisamoron,2,Fri Jul 10 14:40:29 2015 UTC,If you make legal contact with any ball but the 8 ball before hitting the rail it is a legal shot.
billiards,3cr3xh,redditis4queers,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:54:17 2015 UTC,"As long as you hit a ball (other than the 8) and either pocket it or contact the rail it is a legal shot.   Under BCAPL rules, if you called the 7 but pocketed a different ball, it would be the end of your inning and your opponent would have an open table."
billiards,3cr3xh,petermgates,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:58:29 2015 UTC,If you don't hit one of your balls and then have a ball go to a rail it is a foul.
billiards,3cr3xh,hadronflux,3,Fri Jul 10 03:15:06 2015 UTC,"And to clarify, since the table is open, all balls except the 8-ball are legal balls.  Hit any ball except the 8-ball first, then pocket something or drive something to a rail and it's legal, even if you're calling the 7 and you mis-cue and hit a stripe into a rail/pocket instead.  That's a legal shot, but you failed to call the shot, so it's your opponent's shot and it's not a foul or ball in hand.  EDIT: And we're all basing our ruling on the assumption that by ""call shot 8 ball"", you are playing WPA or BCA rules.  Look up ""WPA 8-ball rules"" and try to make sure your friends are going by those rules.  Otherwise, you could be playing somebody's stupid variation of bar rules that disagrees with everything we've all told you."
billiards,3cre41,mattdebrown,13,Fri Jul 10 04:05:01 2015 UTC,"It's not a ""more appropriate"" term.  We're basically mis-using a word and muddying everybody's understanding when we say ""deflection"" and mean ""squirt"".  Basically, deflection is what happens to your cue tip when it strikes the ball off-center.  The cue bends away from the cue ball.  Squirt is the cue ball being pushed or squirted off the line of aim.  When people speak of a ""low-deflection shaft"", they're actually talking about a HIGH-deflection shaft.  The shaft is flexible and weighs as little as possible at the tip so it bends out of the way quicker and causes the cue ball to squirt less.  All those OBs and Predators and the like are high-deflection, low-squirt shafts that have the end-goal of sending the cue-ball on a line as close as possible to your actual aim line.  I never actually call my OB or Predator shafts ""high-deflection"", because that would confuse the hell out of people, but I do just try to call them ""low-squirt"" shafts.  I feel like I'm being more correct, and you're not going to take that away from me :)  I have in recent years heard people try to make up for this confusion by using deflection for both pieces -- I've heard them use ""deflection"" meaning shaft deflection and ""cue ball deflection"" meaning squirt.  Also, you say you confuse squirt with swerve.  Well, then, you're really going to love the term ""squerve"".  You see, since you're hitting over a rail, you're almost always elevating your cue at least a little bit, sometimes even more, so you almost always put a little swerve on the cue-ball any time you apply english.  Since squirt and swerve are BOTH affecting the ball, this effect is often called ""effective squirt"" or ""squerve""."
billiards,3cre41,elint,5,Fri Jul 10 06:31:57 2015 UTC,"That's a good explanation.  It's confusing because some people use the terms ""squirt"" and ""deflection"" interchangeably, but as you said - the cue ball squirts and the shaft deflects.  That's how it was explained to me by Bob Jewett who I would consider an authority on the subject."
billiards,3cre41,BlowAndHookers,2,Fri Jul 10 06:47:46 2015 UTC,Hmm the waters are definitely muddy with a lot of people using different terms. But I wasn't aware they were in fact different terms.

billiards,3cpscu,S0cr8t3s,3,Thu Jul 9 20:55:05 2015 UTC,"Great suggestion.  Or just browse cues on seyberts.com for anything in your price range that has a wood (not fiberglass or graphite or other space-age material) shaft. Whatever strikes your fancy, playing with the same equipment day in and day out is far better for your game than using a different house cue every time you go out."
billiards,3cpscu,elint,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:16:15 2015 UTC,Shopping online only.
billiards,3cpscu,S0cr8t3s,4,Fri Jul 10 00:01:08 2015 UTC,"That's all I have been able to do also. Fortunately I think at the lower price level your not taking much risk.   I purchased a players cue last December and had no complaints about it, sadly it was stolen. But I did get a lot of playing time in with it and I can tell you it is a great cue. The wood to wood joint is solid. Had no problems with the Irish linen wrap. And most importantly it played substantially better than a house cue. The feel is a bit denser/stiffer.  I'm sure I've played with a le pro tip before but I don't have the experience to really judge them. I did however decided to upgrade the tip, which is cheaper to have done there than it would be after you receive it. So if you have a curiosity about laminated tips or an upgraded tip in general, I would suggest you take care of it from the beginning. Most experienced pool players believe the tip and shaft are the most important parts of the cue.  If your intrigued by ld shafts, players also has the hxt series which cost a bit more expensive but gets really good reviews. Or you can buy one at a later time because they use the same joint.  Just my .02."

For a while, Ellen Pao, the CEO has been getting on user's nerves with censorship in the name of political correctness, which a lot of people opposed.   Recently, two extremely popular admins were fired, and one of the subreddits that relied on one of her (/r/iama, which has millions of subscribers) shut down for some time to recoup and reorganize.   The other subreddits saw this shutdown, and thought it was a form of protest, and ""joined in"". /r/art, /r/diy, /r/documentaries, /r/funny, /r/askreddit, /r/books, /r/dataisbeautiful, (each with more than 1 million subscribers) and hundreds of others shut down, effectively taking two thirds of reddit down for a day or two.  There was a petition with literally more than 200,000 signatures asking for Ellen Pao to resign.   Chaos reigned as the people revolted, flooding the front page with all sorts of messages about jumping ship or uprising.  It appears that they listened, and Ellen Pao has stepped down from CEO, and has been replaced by Steve Huffman just earlier today.  Most of the chaos is ""over"", but there is still a bit of tension between mods and admins, and more work definitely will happen over the coming months to repair the relationship between them, and make promises about the future of reddit.

billiards,3cpmj6,Bear2591116,4,Thu Jul 9 19:37:38 2015 UTC,"1st you have to determaine if the ball is ivory.  There should be a small black speck on the top and bottom of the ball.  There also should be a very small light checkering pattern on the sides of the ball.  If you have the original box, papers, and ball, it should be worth around $300."
billiards,3cpmj6,UnderTheShills,2,Thu Jul 9 20:25:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, there are two very tiny black dots on the top and bottom. I assume these are the ""poles"" that are mentioned in the paper."
billiards,3cpmj6,elint,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:43:26 2015 UTC,"It depends on where you are.  In the US, for example, I believe it's illegal to sell ivory unless you have documentation to prove it is from the pre-ivory-ban era.  If you can't prove it's age, you can still own or leave it to descendants in your will."
billiards,3cpmj6,Pip_Pip,2,Fri Jul 10 02:20:15 2015 UTC,I think with the box he should be ok.  Though I think ebay cracked down on pre-ban ivory as well.  There are lots of collectors though it shouldn't be a hard sell.
billiards,3cpmj6,elint,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:50:46 2015 UTC,"Of course, thanks for the correction!  I was on my phone earlier and glossed over the box part.  If he's got the original box and papers that came in it, it's probably pretty easy to tell that it was made before whenever (I think it was 1989)?  But yeah, I've also heard ebay blocks it completely because they don't feel confident in their ability to keep people from selling illegal ivory."

The tables look nice enough from the pictures, but it would be great if they had some pictures of the stages of production, i.e., subframe materials and build techniques.  They do mention ""hardwood subrails"" specifically, which leads me to believe that the rest of the construction is MDF or some other cheap material.  I would bet a lot of money that the only hardwood is in the subrails and probably the veneers.  I would also bet that they play similarly to furniture style Brunswicks and probably Olhausens, but I really have no idea."

I hope you didn't pay anything, since you used the term adopt I'm gonna assume you didn't pay for this abomination. So much for crying about it, now here's what your options are; get rid of it, or get a different table. There is nothing you can do to make that table play well. Because it never did in the first place."
billiards,3clzjm,too_lazy_2_punctuate,4,Thu Jul 9 02:10:47 2015 UTC,Unfortunately he's correct. Non slate tables are just not worth the effort. Your game will probably end up being hindered playing on a non slate table. Gotta go brother.
billiards,3clzjm,lrota,2,Thu Jul 9 05:38:21 2015 UTC,"I agree that a non-slate table will never play well, but there is some potential upside: Put it on Craigslist for $100-200 and eventually someone who doesn't know or care about that will take it off your hands.  In the meantime you can practice shots on the sides that are straight and work on your stroke and fundamentals. When someone does take it off your hands, you can put that towards saving up for a better table. Good luck!"
billiards,3clzjm,BlackLabLover,2,Thu Jul 9 05:45:26 2015 UTC,"Although your bed is not slate you may be able to level it.  Climb under the table and check if there is a long beam running under the play field from one END of the table to the other END. If you have this you may be able to fix it.   I dont know what you mean by ""bowing"" if the play field is concave you can try to wedge it up in the middle of the well.  Put a wedge in between the center beam support and the play field.  Hammer it in until its level.  do not go to far with it hammer a little and check the level.    If it is convex you have to take apart the table, remove the cloth and drill down the high spot.  Do that by countersinking a hole, predilling for a screw and screwing it down.  Put some puttyover the hole after you get it level.   It still may not be perfect but it can turn it from unplayable to somewhat okay.   Do not invest in new cloth unless you can get in 100% level, and it stays that way for at least a couple months."
billiards,3clzjm,UnderTheShills,2,Thu Jul 9 18:40:52 2015 UTC,This is the solution.  I started off with a MDF table I found a few houses down just thrown out.  It had a bow in the center from side pocket to side pocket.  Got my car jack out and put a beam across it.  jacked it to the point that it flattened out a lot. We called it roller derby pool.  It was a fun toy until we got a slate table and you just simply cannot compare the two.
billiards,3clzjm,mizzikee,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:42:58 2015 UTC,"Your second problem sounds more like your stroke needs work than an issue the cloth.  Make sure your stroke is straight (Coke-bottle drill) and that you are following through after contact.  As for the warped bed, you need a slate-bed table or that is pretty much always going to happen."
billiards,3clzjm,RoadHustler,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:31:10 2015 UTC,If you felt like throwing away a little  more money on an experiment. You could try disassembling it and replacing the bed with a sheet of 3/4 inch birch ply and a surface of hardboard glued to it with titebond. You would probably  be throwing away a little over a hundred  bucks by the time you finish. but if you can't afford  another table and this one is screwed then have fun experimenting.   Take pictures and let us know how my stupid idea goes.    Oh and if your table has hollow boxes for legs fill them with sand to make it more stable and less likely  to move under  weight when you play.
billiards,3clzjm,wordysanchez,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:57:27 2015 UTC,"The bed is either MDF or honeycomb. Either way, you might be able to shim it slightly for some kind of better result...although I wouldn't hold my breath. good luck man."

billiards,3ckyfq,Appetite_TDE,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:01:09 2015 UTC,"Jumping for me kinda equates to letting go of whitey.   Jumps tend to be more of a power shot with a lot of leftover energy after contact.  I masse well enough and I know how to read the rail.  I don't know what's gonna happen when my jump gets loose.  I guess my hierarchy goes as follows:   A reasonable masse wins out over a half-ball jump, a jump wins out over a full ball masse at less than 5 feet and more than 1 foot.  A safety wins out over all of them if I'm not in a clutch situation."
billiards,3ckyfq,MattadorGuitar,2,Thu Jul 9 03:47:30 2015 UTC,"It's usually going to be a pretty low-percentage shot, so I'll only try it if all other options that I can see are lower-percentage than that, or if missing the shot would leave the other guy in a difficult position.

billiards,3ckyfq,ey_bb_wan_sum_fuk,2,Wed Jul 8 18:51:44 2015 UTC,"Well, a small masse, sure, but I call those swerve shots. For when you're just barely snookered.  But an extreme masse where I'm curving at more than a 90 degree angle? Unless I don't care that much about winning or I'm in an absolute last resort.  I'm somewhat decent at masse shots. Used to be a lot better, but there are better things to spend your time practicing."

billiards,3ckyfq,emfourteen,2,Thu Jul 9 14:37:02 2015 UTC,"When I am just goofing off and practicing with friends, I like to challenge myself to do some rather extreme masse shots. In tournament matches or gambling, though, I limit myself to only shooting them in order to get a legal hit. Even when doing this, I am almost always playing speed to leave a rough shot for my opponent. I rarely ever find myself shooting a curve ball to actually try to pocket a ball. Mostly I am barely hooked from seeing a ball and I try to figure out a decent speed to hit to play a line that will end up rough for my opponent. I certainly think there is a place for the masse shot in competitive pool. But like the other guys say, I trust my 2 and 3 rail kicking to be slightly more dependable to get hits on balls that are hooked from direct LOS. The masse shot has its place in the game, but the circumstances that present themselves where this is the most attractive option are pretty rare for me."

billiards,3ckyfq,aahhmmgg,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:54:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I kick okay but a lot of the times I masse since I know I have a decent chance to make it, not just ducks either.  Also you can masse kick when someone really puts you in jail.  With a soft-medium stroke I can be in one corner, aim straight at the opposite side rail while using masse and hit the opposite end rail almost a diamond and a half up from the pocket.  It opens up angles on balls you shouldn't be able to hit :)"
billiards,3ckyfq,Tee_Whet,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:22:28 2015 UTC,It's all about what you are comfortable with. I've practiced masse shots enough to know I am more comfortable with a masse vs. jumping.
billiards,3ckyfq,NewJerseyAudio,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:24:42 2015 UTC,"I will masse on longer shots to where I am not bending the ball a huge amount, maybe just a couple inches. Im confident in that shot."

We have heard from so many people who have a Bensiger's connection, either they played there or they practically grew up there watching friends or loved ones play there. It is great to see so many people who have the same passion about Bensinger's as Helaine does! Please continue to help us by spreading the word and keep the momentum going.   Today we were featured as a Kickstarter staff pick! This is great news to help us reach a wider audience.  We know that raising $25,000 is pretty ambitious and is a lot of money! We are confident that we can reach this goal by getting the word out to as many people as possible. Every single contribution (big or small) counts and is so important to us.   Here is a little breakdown, to help anyone who is wondering, where this money will go. Straight out of the gate Kickstarter and Amazon (payment processor) each take 5% so there goes $2,500 right off the top. Our biggest expense is the printing and binding. The book will be offset printed and hardbound by Oddi Printing in Iceland, which will cost approximately $12,000-$15,000 for 1,0000 copies. The final cost will depend on the quality of paper we use, and how fancy we get with the final cover design. We want this book to be beautiful and offset printing is the way to go, especially for black and white images.  A few other costs:  Printing proof/match prints to send to the printer to reference during printing - $500  Shipping the books from Iceland to Portland - $1,000+  Final book design: $500-$1,000  Mailing and supplies - $500-$1,000  Producing the postcard set and prints to be included as Kickstarter rewards - $500-$1,000  There are other little nickel and dime costs here and there that I won't mention, but this leaves us a few thousand dollars wiggle room to cover unexpected expenses, which there always are.

billiards,3cflxi,WittyQuip,5,Tue Jul 7 15:13:11 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a defective shaft.  I've never had a warping problem with my Predator 314 or 3142.  As for my OB Pro+ (slightly different construction and ferrule, but same 11.75mm tip diameter as the 2+), I have only had it 7 weeks (May 14th), but I haven't noticed an issue yet.  I'll keep an eye on it.  I would send it back again and make sure they know that you've sent it in once and let them know what conditions you store the cue in (if it sits in a hot or humid car, does it stay there for one day a week, all week long, etc).  I would expect a replacement if you're properly taking care of it and it keeps warping."
billiards,3cflxi,elint,2,Tue Jul 7 15:59:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm really hoping it was just a defective shaft man. I love playing with this shaft. It just feels right. Oh well, I'll be giving them a call and seeing if I can get a replacement! Happy shooting with yours!"
billiards,3cflxi,gabrielleigh,5,Tue Jul 7 17:06:24 2015 UTC,"From my experience (seeing and working on hundreds of spliced or laminated shafts), the quality of the wood that is selected to make the individual splices or lamination layers is generally pretty bad. The splices are generally cut from lumber that would simply not meet the standards for grain straightness that would normally be required for a traditional solid wood shaft. I have found this to be true across all brands, all models, and all styles of the new ""LD"" shafts. Regardless of the method of construction, i.e. ""pie slices"" or flat lamination or any other shape of pieces, the general quality of the wood has appeared to me to be much lower than what would be selected for traditional solid wood shafts. I regularly see laminations with knots and birdseyes and other flaws that would normally cause the blank to be rejected. They slice these pieces very thin to minimize the visibility of the flaws and they get glued together under the premise that this construction method results in an increase in consistency and other benefits as well. Unfortunately, it is my opinion that these benefits are generally outweighed by the additional maintenance issues that seem to arise from the current manufacturing standards and methods used today.   My personal opinion is that I can much more closely control the potential for warpage when I cut a shaft from a single solid piece of aged lumber which I can inspect and evaluate for any potential flaws. The cost of low grade lumber and high grade lumber is nearly the same, but it takes a lot of time, effort, and experience to go through huge stacks of raw materials to select shaftwood that meets the very high standards of traditional cuemaking. Big cue factories can eliminate this issue by simply running low grade lumber through precision sawing operations and gluing it back together in these new configurations and marketing it as some amazing revolutionary new product.   I know plenty of people who have not had any issues with warpage with their LD shafts. I know plenty of people who simply love their LD product and would never play with anything else beside that kind of product. I do major surgery on all of these brands of shafts every week, and I see the guts of these products and I triage the problems they have and I can say without any question that I believe traditional solid wood shafts are more durable and have less warpage issues than the spliced LD products. Of all the LD products I work on, the least popular ""flat laminated"" models seem to have the least amount of warpage. The flat laminated shafts are not nearly as popular as the Predator and OB style of spliced shafts. People seem to think the flat laminated shafts have some undesirable feels and hits. I don't personally like the way the flat laminated models play either, but that is simply a personal preference of mine. They do hold their shape better, though.   Of all the LD products I have worked on and played with, I still think the Jacoby Edge Hybrid is the best product on the market right now. I have had three or four come through the shop for cleanings and tips and stuff, and the quality of wood that Jacoby selects for their LD shaft seems to be quite a bit higher than the other brands. Jacoby is a world-class builder who launched some production lines such as the Edge Hybrid, and that company has a strong custom cue background behind their production line processes.   LD shafts are essentially the ""hotdogs"" of the cue world. They take all the low grade lumber that cant pass inspection for regular cue parts and they saw it up and glue it into blanks which eventually turn into LD shafts. Much like all the guts and tissues from a meat packing plant get blended up and crammed into hotdogs. They throw enough glue and foam and other synthetic cores and gimmicks into the shafts to keep them together for a statistically-profitable period of time."

I'm gonna call OB and see if I can get this sorted out where I can get a replacement shaft and I'll see if that shaft is any better. I'm hoping I may have just gotten a defective one and that all of OB's 2+ shafts aren't as ""fragile."" If that one turns out bad, I may have to look into that Jacoby Edge Hybrid!"
billiards,3cflxi,gimmeaboost,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:03:48 2015 UTC,I'd say you just got a bad one. Most people I know who play with the OB's don't have any problems. I think OB makes a much better LD shaft than Predator. I have only seen very occasional mild warpage with the OBs. Their biggest weakness are the models with the wooden ferrules. Those ferrules are prone to cracking and seem to only last a year or so before they begin to come apart. Everyone I know who has dealt with OB customer service says they are fast and pleasant to work with. Can't really ask for much more than that!

You can reverse the warp temporarily by bending or applying pressure in the opposite direction and it will hold its form for a time.  I think it's pretty common with the laminate shafts."

billiards,3cflxi,Kelvinn1996,2,Tue Jul 7 17:07:51 2015 UTC,Where do you live and how do you store your shaft.  I'd guess it's a combination of a bad shaft (it happens) and your environment.  I'd bet if you talk to OB they'll send you a new shaft this time and hopefully that just solves your problem.

billiards,3ccwxb,CreeDorofl,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:39:02 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately pool rules in the USA are a mess. Here's the deal.  There was a big popular governing body, the BCA, which sanctioned pro tournaments and also ran a league.   The league part of the BCA got sold to a company called CSI, but it's still called the BCAPL (BCA Player's League).   The BCA league rules are slightly different than the original BCA rules. The original BCA rules were adopted by another organization (the WPA) that is trying to become the official governing body of pool, and create one set of rules for players to use.  To further muddy the waters, the BCA league is big, but the APA league is much bigger. So a lot of players use APA rules even outside of the league.   So here's the rule on accidental touches:   BCA/WPA rules - it's a foul, ball in hand for the opponent. The nickname for this method of handling accidental touches is ""all ball fouls.""  In europe, this is the norm. In the USA, it's not. In the USA, it's usually only a foul to disturb the cue ball. The short term for that is ""cue ball fouls only"".  BCA League rules - it's not a foul unless it affects the outcome of the shot. The opponent has the option of leaving the moved ball where it is, or making you put it back. APA rules - it's not a foul, and there is NO option, the shooter is expected to restore the balls as closely as possible to their original positions  (though many people are unaware of this and ask the opponent if they want the balls restored).   To make it worse, many tournaments will create exceptions for one particular rule, just because that's the tournament director's preference. So even if it's legal to use jump cues, they may ban them for just one event."
billiards,3ccwxb,HappySoda,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:16:47 2015 UTC,"Is there at least one single set of rules for all pro tournaments?   We have something kind of similar here with snooker. The most ""ignored"" rule is ""foul and a miss"", because most tournaments don't have the ability to restore the table to pre-shot conditions. But other than that, the rules are identical across the board.   I remember when I did APA in the US, we had slightly different rules based on the venue. It made sense, because house rules usually trump league rules. But I never got very deep with pool, since I'm pretty bad at it. However, I didn't expect the fragmentation to be this drastic.   So... what do you do if you play against a stranger at a bar?"
billiards,3ccwxb,CreeDorofl,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:36:46 2015 UTC,"Nope, no single set of rules for all pro tournaments. A handful of rules are so universal that you don't have to worry about them in pro events... for example, you must hit the lowest numbered ball when playing 9-ball.   But many of the less major rules are not specified, or simply ignored. A frequent controversy arises around pattern racking for example... technically against the WPA rules, but many tournaments don't explicitly say ""We're using WPA rules"", and many players do it anyway, even if they know the rule. 99% of the time if someone pattern racks, his opponent doesn't say a word about it. I only saw someone get caught once and all they got was a warning not to do it anymore.  In any 8-ball tournament, forget about it, you MUST ask whether it's open after the break, or you must 'take what you make'. If you make an assumption one way or the other, it could end up hurting you.  Snooker (from what I can tell) is much better about this stuff.  And yes, even within the APA, it says right in the rulebook that any league operator can have ""local bylaws"" (a euphemism for house rules) so even those rules are not consistent, despite having printed books and a website listing the exact rules. Some of these are really dumb, like ""you can jump or masse, but only if you don't raise the butt of your cue above shoulder height"".   When playing a stranger in a bar, it's customary to say something like ... ""so do you go by league rules or... ?"" and even then, as soon as I foul, I usually say ""So can I put the cue ball anywhere or do you go behind the line?"". You would never ask ""so do you go by WPA rules?"" because 99.9% of the time they'll have no idea what the hell you're talking about."

billiards,3ccwxb,HappySoda,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:28:58 2015 UTC,"I did. But I know that different tournaments can have different rules. Since this rule seemed really bizarre to me and the commentators even took the time to explain it, I figured it's probably not a common rule. I was guessing this was more like the APA's rule on shooter taking the suit of the ball sunk on break, or house rules like ""no masse""."
billiards,3ccwxb,jlbartle,2,Tue Jul 7 14:41:40 2015 UTC,"If 2 balls are moved it's a foul,  if it's just 1 it's moved back by opponent. Exception: cue ball moved is always a foul. Also if you move an object and the cue ball comes within 7 inches of where the ball was or interrupts the movement of the cue ball it's a foul. Bca rulebook has a diagram of this. Most pro tournaments play with these rules"

billiards,3ccwxb,penguin74,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:39:45 2015 UTC,"While not a foul, that's where it can bite you in the ass. You may accidentally move the ball and make it easier for your opponent and he has the option to leave it where you moved it. At least in TAP you do."

billiards,3cdjx1,tone430,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:01:07 2015 UTC,"I think that having an 8ft is better than nothing and that you can get quality practice in.  However, practicing on tables you compete on is ideal.  If you compete on a 7' any shotmaking for feeling smaller is surpassed by the position and cluster knowledge you get playing on a 7'.   I have a 9', I play on 12, 10, 9, 7 tables.  While playing on a larger table at first can accentuate flaws that would make ""long"" shots more difficult in the long run there isn't much difference.   Short term it might give you a training aid boost.  Beyond that I think you are getting less out of it."
billiards,3cdjx1,Pip_Pip,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:43:15 2015 UTC,"Bigger tables do give you more practice on long shots, but they give you less practic dealing with clusters of balls and position play, because the balls have more opportunity to spread out."
billiards,3cdjx1,elint,3,Tue Jul 7 06:48:00 2015 UTC,I disagree on the position play. I find that barboxes usually cause the balls to cluster more. This unoftunate reality causes a lot more sloppy banging than position play. 8ft table is ideal as you get some cluster grouping and also long shots to practice both shooting and cue position.

For instance, I could argue the guy playing the 9 footer has better experience dealing with clusters because his aim has to be better to make those break outs on a 9 footer."

I personally don't think any of them are better or worse, the angles are the same and the balls still move based on physics...they're just different.   A good player on a pool table will be a good player on a different table. By your logic, a player will play better/worse depending on cues as well, which isn't the case."

They can be moved with a full size truck by two people fully assembled. For another couple hundred, you can have a table mechanic put nice cloth on the table after it is set up. I also wholeheartedly agree with the other guys who are recommending getting a table similar to what you compete on. Unfortunately, some of the brands of ""home tables"" available at recreation stores are going to play a lot different than Valley and Diamond tables which are more common in pool rooms and venues where competitive pool is played. Their frames are generally flimsy and more prone to settling and shifting and affecting the ability of the table to remain flat and true over time. Valley and Diamond tables are engineered to be abused by the bar crowds so they stand up quite a bit better over time.   You can sometimes find really cheap Valley bar tables that might look rough on the outside. Buzz all the side panels with a DA sander and roll on a fresh coat of paint. Polish the aluminum corner covers with some automotive wheel polish and soft cotton cloths. A few hours of work and you can have a new-looking table for a fraction of the cost of a new one."

Its a dynamic term much like running and reverse English.   Edit: I should also say that outside English is usually called helping English to as it will negate the throw of a cut when used correctly. This is why it is much more commonly used. I find that I usually use inside primarily for CB positioning rather for the purpose of swinging an OB towards the pocket."

billiards,3c842b,Pilfered,2,Sun Jul 5 23:47:49 2015 UTC,Inside is same direction as your cut. Outside is opposite direction of your cut.  i.e. You cut a ball to the right and use left english - it's outside english.

So he's saying that in this situation ""inside"" English is the same side that your object ball is aiming for, aka: the right middle pocket + inside English = Right English.   The right middle pocket + outside English = Left English."

billiards,3c842b,CreeDorofl,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:38:41 2015 UTC,"Even wording it like ""if you are cutting to the left"" can be misunderstood... I've had someone interpret that to mean ""the cue ball hits the left side of the object ball""... when I meant to say ""you're sending the object ball to the left"".  I think the clearest wording is - Inside = english on the same side as the direction the object ball will be travelling. So if you cut the object ball to make it travel to your left, then left spin = inside english.  Outside is the opposite of the direction the object ball is moving."
billiards,3c842b,tone430,-2,Fri Jul 10 15:53:21 2015 UTC,"You can also think of it this way: if you are cutting an object ball to the left, if you put right on the cue ball, then the english is pointing towards the rail (the ""outside"" of the table).  If you are cutting the same object ball to the right and you put right on the cue ball, now your english is pointing towards the middle of the table (or the ""inside of the table)."

billiards,3c67v6,yellowsnow,2,Sun Jul 5 14:58:06 2015 UTC,"Do you think you're going to be serious about pool (or already feel you are)?   A lot of times people recommend some common cheap brands (players, lucasi, poison) with the idea that if you get serious later, you can move up to a nicer cue.  But, there's a problem with this, and it will actually make life harder if you're trying to become a good pool player.   Most cheap cues come with 'standard' shafts (as opposed to 'low deflection' shafts). I don't wanna bore you with the explanation unless you really want one, but it affects how you aim shots when using english (sidespin) on the cue ball.  So what happens is, you buy a cheap cue and learn to aim a certain way when using english. Then later you buy a nicer cue that with a low deflection shaft (for example a predator), and now your usual line of aim doesn't work anymore. When you use sidespin, you find you're missing shots that you usually make, because the new shaft sends the cue ball on a slightly different path when you hit the left or right side of the cue ball.  This is a painful process and some players never adjust to the difference, and it holds back their game. Other players end up getting rid of the low deflection shaft and moving back to a standard shaft. A few players get REALLY screwed up and keep switching back and forth between 2 shafts, which is ridiculous and causes inconsistency in their game.  I firmly believe low deflection shafts make life easier for the pool player, and make the game easier to learn... and unfortunately, they don't put them on the sticks most people consider 'beginner sticks', they put them on nicer cues.   So my recommendation is... skip the painful 'switching' process, and just start out with a low deflection shaft right now. You'll have an easier time learning to master english, and won't waste time having to unlearn old lines of aim.   The shafts are expensive (about $200) but if cared for properly, there's no reason they can't last for 10+ years. I've been playing 20 years and I'm on my third shaft, and the only reason I switched is because I rage-bashed the other 2 and broke them.   You can also attach a cheap butt to the shaft and still get all the benefits of it. So it's ok to pair up a $200 OB shaft with a $50 players cue butt."

billiards,3c67v6,southpawunited,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:54:22 2015 UTC,Is a $400 Lucasi considered a standard cue and not a low deflection cue? I have the option of buying either the Lucasi hybrid and a discounted replica Balabushka GB3 for the same price. I'm looking for a LD cue.
billiards,3c67v6,CreeDorofl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:59:37 2015 UTC,"To be honest the only cues I trust as definitely being low deflection are Predator and OB cues. I've used both plenty of times and they work as advertised.   I have seen other cues advertise themselves as low deflection, but they don't have the important changes required to reduce deflection. For example the verbiage on the Lucasi site says this about their shafts:   ""Reducing the shaft mass at the tip without having to bore a hole through the center (unlike most other low deflection shafts) increases the performance of the Hybrid shaft while still providing a solid hit.""  Reduced endmass is the #1 thing that makes a shaft low deflection, and the true LD shafts are hollowed out the end of the shaft (just the last 5 inches or so) and then filled with some material like foam to keep the shaft from having a hollow sound or 'feel' when you hit the cue ball.   Lucasi isn't doing that. But without that fundamental change, their cues will definitely deflect more than a predator or OB. Whatever little changes they made to the tip or the ferrule won't cut it.  I'm sure by now, more than 2 companies are doing the hollowed-end thing, and making true low deflection shafts. But since I know for sure Predator and OB are doing it, I don't gamble on the other brands. I just buy their shaft and attach it to the existing butt I've been using for over 10 years.   That would be my recommendation. Get the brands that are known and proven to work. If you want to try a different brand, you gotta do some homework on them... you can't tell whether it's low deflection by the price alone. Plenty of cues cost thousands and deflect like crazy."

The break cue is just that and has a special phenolic tip that is designed to be extra hard for breaking. These don't make for a good playing cue. The last is technically playing cue but although some people do use them fiberglass doesn't play well. It also doesn't compare to the standard wood shaft that that Rage cue has. You should also look at J&J cues they should have some around your price range and are considered fairly good.
billiards,3c35j7,fadedcheese,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:07:31 2015 UTC,"The JJ cue is set up to be a break cue with the extremely hard tip, but that can be easily changed to a softer leather tip for just a few bucks. Other than the tip, I see nothing wrong with the JJ cue you linked.   That Rage cue should work just fine, too. The Earl Strickland Cuetec is not one I'd recommend because of the fiberglass coating.   For the money, I think the McDermott ""Lucky"" cues are even better than all of these options you linked. One main reason is the fact that McDermott uses the 3/8"" x 10 ""big pin"" instead of the smaller 5/16"" x 18 pin in the JJ and Rage cues. I think the big pin makes a slightly stronger joint, and has more of a natural feel than the 5/16"" joints which require a brass insert to be installed in the shaft instead of wood threads like the big pin cues use. This is more of a personal preference than anything else, though.   Check them out here, specifically the bottom of this page with the L1 - L5 models: McDermott Lucky Cues"
billiards,3c35j7,gabrielleigh,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:52:48 2015 UTC,Are the only differences between the McDermott L models the graphics or is there something else that constitutes the higher prices as you go up the page?

billiards,3c35j7,spikebaylor,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:52:33 2015 UTC,I think the answers here are pretty good so if you're looking at these three specifically then go by their answers.  I would suggest looking around at some pawn shops as well.  You can sometimes get a pretty decent cue for your price range.  Just make sure you look at the shaft and ensure it isn't warped.  You may also want to take it somewhere and have the tip replaced if it looks bad.  My first cue was a McDermott my dad got me from a pawn shop.  That cue was great until it got left in my car for a few days and the shaft warped a bit.  Even then I played with it warped for years.  I just had to adjust a bit (I don't recommend playing with a warped cue lol)

billiards,3c1ndj,gabrielleigh,2,Fri Jul 3 22:54:40 2015 UTC,"Here is the first in a short series of sneaky pete conversion cues I am doing for a customer. He brought me a pile of old beat up house cues and I am in the process of cutting them up and salvaging good butts and shafts from what he brought over. Most of the cues had warpage, damaged shafts, and other problems. This is the first one of the series to be completed for him.   This cue has a rosewood spliced butt. He requested this cue to be as long as possible and still fit in his nice case.   Total cue length ended up at 61.25"" long.  The shaft is 31.375"" long and weighs 3.8 oz The butt is 29.875"" long and weighs 15.7 oz Total cue weight is 19.5 oz Ferrule diameter is .494"" (12.55 mm) Tip is a black Kamui SS  My ""Road Agent"" sneaky pete conversions get phenolic collars and buttcaps, custom tapered shafts cut to spec. I replace the weak plastic ferrules with strong phenolic composite ferrules. I try to keep them as subtle and inconspicuous as possible. Tan collars at the joint are low profile, and a thin black buttcap protects the butt from splits while remaining pretty sneaky looking. The joint pin in this series is a brass 3/8"" x 10 big pin.   This cue was actually put together by salvaging two different house cues due to the extreme length the customer requested. These house cues are normally 56""- 58"" in length from the factory. The rosewood butt was banged up pretty bad and had a really rough bottom edge due to not having any kind of rubber bumper on the cue for many years. The blemishes all vanished when I re-machined the cue down to the standard size I wanted. Sprayed the whole thing with auto clear, so it is quite a bit shinier than the original factory finish.   All-in-all, it is a very solid player that won't attract too much attention. A good pole to take to a joint where you may need to briefly look away and not have to worry a whole bunch about the cue being stolen."

It's also a lot rougher, since pool cue tips tend to be harder. All in all, it's not very useful for shaping snooker cues. We usually just use a piece of sandpaper to shape the tip as we like.   I had a piece of sandpaper in my case. But at some point, the wife moved this from the cue case into the snooker case, and got rid of the sandpaper. When I asked, she said she saw this thing when her cousin borrowed my pool cue, and thought I was using sandpaper because I forgot that I had this. So, she switched them, and now I have a flat and mushrooming tip that I can't shape :P"

billiards,3bz9j4,CaptainHaggis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:27:54 2015 UTC,"I sometimes miss the simplicity of UK 8-ball - solids and stripes are much harder for me to distinguish than reds and yellows, and sometimes I forget about one blasted ball that has its mostly-solid side facing me when I'm planning my attack.  However, the terrible 2-shot carry rule played by many (fouls yielding two full turns, not just a free shot) combined with the otherwise reasonable rule of being able to just roll up to a ball with nothing hitting a pocket/cushion, seem to make for overly negative games compared to the US game, as there is a massive advantage if you can force a foul. Even average players will clear the table if the opponent fouls, so forcing a foul is the easiest way to win even from an open table.  Potting your opponent's ball being a foul even if you hit yours first can also turn any average game into a chess match.  Also, the UK has so many sets of rules it gets crazy. Nominate the pocket for the black, maybe, ball-in-hand after fouls sometimes, but behind the line or in the D when the white goes in, and you can probably only shoot forwards. No 2 shots on the black. In some areas the same rules are known as 'new rules', in others they're 'old rules', and if anyone says 'standard rules' you're in trouble. If there's a rule list on the wall, it pays to read and memorise it before playing, as the wall is a better player than anyone else so that list trumps whatever else anyone says.  I think that a sensible set of rules could be created and still be distinct from the US game, e.g., keep two-shots after fouls but no carry, allow them on the black, allow the white ball to go anywhere after the white goes down, no ball-in-hand after a normal foul, but good luck having people play it in more than 3 towns without adding any nonsense.  In contrast, in the US people mostly play 'proper' rules or 'bar' rules, which are pretty similar to each other (though as in the UK the players of each think they're playing the standard rules). Individual leagues/pool halls have variations such as barring jump and (extreme) swerve shots, forcing you to take whatever you potted on the break, getting the black on the break being a win, but they seem less of a pain than the many UK variations. The numbered balls actually add some flexibility in the kind of game played, so you can use the same set of balls for 9-ball, for cut-throat (a game for 3 where you protect your set of 5 balls), etc. I'll have to work out a way of playing something like 6-red snooker with them."

Cannon = break out/cluster breaking  Screw = back spin/draw  Carom is the same, but they don't intentionally play them much except to get position.  Fluke = slop  Break = run  Break off = Break/first shot  Double = Bank  Swerve = masse (although they aren't allowed to jump balls in snooker, and the masse shots are usually just enough to get around a ball, nothing crazy)  Rest = bridge"

Everything else is right though!  Edit: Forgot to add that this is mostly used to develop reds/colors that are usually not playable. (I.E stuck to the cushion, balls touching other reds/colors)"
billiards,3bwomm,IFVoltaire,2,Thu Jul 2 22:50:19 2015 UTC,"If the commentators were referring to cannons when the ball had top-spin, it would be because that spin was causing the cue ball to strike multiple object balls and not a reference to the follow itself."

I force myself to listen for the friction noise as the block slides across the tip. It's not always easy to hear. But if you can't, then you are paying attention to the noise around you. Once I can clearly hear every stroke, I start my pre-shot routine and pull the trigger. Hearing the scratching sound forces your mind to focus and invokes the feelings of a practice session. At least, that's how it works for me :P"

It's hardly douchey.  It's bad etiquette and a distraction to leave chalk on the table. In extreme cases it may even be cause for a foul if your opponent can show you were using it to mark a position on the rail for a bank or a kick.  Concern yourself with your game and let others worry about theirs. If you're spending time thinking about how they're going through their routine, then they're distracting you from your game.  Watch for fouls from your opponent and keep track of the ball positions for your next shot. Anything else is a distraction from your game."

He didn't say one word after the match was over. He signed the sheet and walked off from the table without shaking my hand or anything. To be playing at a tournament of that level and to have a general lack of pool etiquette, it just amazes me. I'm not saying that everyone that uses a magnet chalker is a douche, but this certain individual was. That's what caused me to never use a chalker after that match lol."
billiards,3bvte4,dirtyduo,0,Thu Jul 2 19:04:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, I wasn't really looking for any, nor did my post contain any questions about game theory, but I recognize we like to discuss the merits of the game, so here goes;  As for thinking about the other guys game distracts me from mine. Well, we will have to agree to disagree.   Pool shares many similarities with many sports, games, etc. For my purposes I will use the battle commander as my avatar.  Information is critical. Analyzing your opponents play is like taking in the topography of the battlegrounds, enemy troop movement, intelligence, weather, supplies, etc etc. If someone is shooting and you have your head out the window then you're wrong. That's all there is to it.   Analyze your opponents game. Sometimes this takes months sometimes you know by the end of the first rack. It depends on the opponents strengths and weaknesses. What kind of shot is he good at, what kind of English is he most comfortable using. Does he shoot well on the rails? Can he kick well enough to duck safeties? Can he kick multiple rails to duck?  Apply all these variables and you may find a weakness that allows you to beat a player that is actually above your level in terms of ""potting prowess"". This is where defense comes into the equation.   And yes, sometimes unnerving an opponent is as simple as making him lose his chalk. Though, to be honest with you the type of person that trick would work on is not a seasoned player. They are much more likely to be a bar shooter who fancies himself the ""house pro"", I'm sure you know the type I'm talking about."
billiards,3bvte4,spectacular_coitus,0,Thu Jul 2 18:45:50 2015 UTC,"Funny story now that you mentioned a chalk holder. I'm 20 now but when I started playing in BCA at age 16, I went to Vegas that year. I lost my first match and ended up playing this guy from canada for my next match. This guy was a genuine ass hole lol. He had a magnetic chalk holder clipped to his belt. He had this whole routine every shot. He would kind of move his arm into a circle, grab his chalk, chalk his cue and then did the same routine to place it back on the magnet on his belt. It's hard to explain the exact picture, but from that moment forward, for some reason I vowed to myself I would never use one. Still haven't used a chalk holder four years later. Haha  EDIT: Thought you said chalk holder, not chalker."

It's a shame you had that experience, I never break my concentration because whenever I need to chalk I just reach into my back pocket."

billiards,3bvte4,DetroitLarry,2,Sat Jul 11 05:31:47 2015 UTC,Stay away from the bar while you're playing and focus on your game. Get a decent night's rest and make sure you eat regularly and properly.  Make sure you keep good track of what's happening on the table when it's not your shot in case you need to call a ref. Double check to see if balls are frozen to rails or object balls and if they are inform your opponent that you think they are before they can shoot it.  Everybody plays for keeps at these things and you can't expect people to call their own fouls on themselves like they might when you're playing at home.  Don't let the big room shake your confidence. Everybody had to play really well somewhere else to get there. Just like you did. You earned the spot. So play like it.

If you break with a bit of hop and top to stop the cue ball in the middle of the table, it does the job pretty well.   I'd definitely like to see how well it jumps as a jump tip, but I don't have a way to shorten up the Mezz R into a ~40"" stick."

Were I you I would probably pick up a predator or ob sneaky pete. Its towards the high end of what you want to spend but it will come with a nice low deflection shaft. Its not really like that there are nice cues from all over the world. Among ""Custom cue makers"" Most of the people who anyone has heard of are from the US. But when we are talking about production cues great cues are made all over the world. Even in china... Predator comes to mind. Tip hardness is totally an opinion thing. years ago I was playing with super softs. Then I started playing with mediums now I play with hard tips exclusively and most hard tips are pretty interchangeable. I have tried most of them and they are all great. Some last slightly longer than others though but a few thousand balls shouldn't matter buy the tip you think you will like if you don't, try a new one."
billiards,3brobo,RoadHustler,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:42:29 2015 UTC,If you can swing a little extra(or a wrapped for 370$) I would totally get a roadline sneaky pete from predator.

billiards,3brobo,Crazykiller789,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:47:39 2015 UTC,"You could probably save a little money by buying a new shaft instead of a new cue.  That's what I did recently.  I have a rather inexpensive Viking cue on which I put a Predator 312².  I love the shaft, and the Everest medium tip it comes with as well.  I would have liked to have gotten a whole new cue, but I couldn't justify spending the extra money when I knew the cue I had was just fine (the butt end anyway).  Sorry if I'm being a killjoy."

billiards,3brobo,tone430,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:47:57 2015 UTC,"Oh, well then, happy hunting!  It's always fun to get new stuff!  My only word of advice would be to get a ""standard"" joint type, e.g. 3/8x<whatever>, 5/16x<whatever>, or perhaps Uni-loc.  That way, if you ever upgrade again, you can still use all of your shafts.  If you go with a manufacturer-specific joint, I'm sure they are great, but your upgrade options in the future might be limited.  Unless you really like their shafts.  Mezz comes to mind..."
billiards,3brobo,Cyber_Derp,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:23:25 2015 UTC,"If your willing to go the little more expensive route, I would look at getting a custom cue built. Custom cues will all have a different feel, so just search the maker name and you can find reviews on how it will hit. You can get the cue made exactly to your liking and reputable cuemakers usually have sometime of warranty on their work. I got a custom cue about 6-7 months ago and it was one of the best decisions I've made. It definitely builds confidence in your stroke and game.   And the country thing is kind of a toss up. There are good cues, and bad cues, just do your research. If you decide to go custom, take into consideration shipping and insurance costs if you have to send the cue back to the builder for any reason.  As far as tips, it's all about preference. I use a soft tip personally, but they are definitely more work since they tend to mushroom. IMO a hard tip will be more likely to miscue if you don't chalk in between every shot."

He already had the cue started when I purchased it from him, but it still took about 1 1/2 months to complete. Well worth the wait though.  If your not a fan of a fancy looking cue, maybe look at Josey cues. I've played with a couple and they are very solid. The only thing in the $400 price range would be his sneaky pete's with maybe some inlays and maybe a wrap. He was ranked one of the best cue makers a year or two ago.

You used to be able to feel every inlay and point, but now it's super smooth and nice. I still have one issue with my cue at the ring just below the collar. It looks like it may have expanded a tiny bit so you can feel it, but it's nothing another coat of finish can't fix. He told me to send it to him but I told him I'm not worried about it. It'll be fixed whenever I decide to get the whole thing refinished and re-wraped."

Don't get me wrong, I love the cue and I'll never get rid of it because it plays so well, but I just got a new OB shaft and need a collar put on. So instead of him being able to do it like I would want, he is sending me the collar and someone else is putting it on. Shipping and insurance is to damn much."

I think in that range I would spend as little as possible and go for something fairly simple. That being said, I think you should look for a used Schon or get a sneaky Pete from one of the high end manufacturers or custom maker.   I can't offer any advice on tips, everyone has a preference. Having used a few different tips, I would really recommend Tiger Snipers, I have much better ball response with these over the Kamui I had before."

That's the biggest fuck you break I've ever seen.  Edit: Also 100:05: ""Let me read some of these statistics here""... Hilarious moment!"
billiards,3bpruc,ricky_clarkson,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:51:18 2015 UTC,Still amazes me how Efren switches from right to left handed even on those tough cut shots. Unreal
billiards,3bmwvm,HappySoda,2,Tue Jun 30 14:41:47 2015 UTC,I hate those rounded corners so much.
billiards,3bmwvm,anyd,2,Tue Jun 30 20:18:01 2015 UTC,"Probably a dumb question, but what's the point of them?"
billiards,3bmwvm,IUsedToWantSalmon,3,Wed Jul 1 04:25:09 2015 UTC,Think of shooting a cut shot down the rail. In American billiards that shot banks off the inside of the pocket and falls in.  If that ball comes off the rail a touch on a snooker table it's gonna rattle out.   It makes shots that most Americans take for granted much more difficult.   Edit: not sure which countries feature which pocket-style.  So americans should read as from my pov.
billiards,3bmwvm,anyd,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:34:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, but I think they make balls go into the centre pockets more easily. The US square centre pockets are a pain from a sharp angle.  Also, the response when you deliberately hit the pocket wall is more predictable than hitting the point of a square US pocket."
billiards,3bmwvm,ricky_clarkson,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:45:03 2015 UTC,"Yup. Even after a year of trying out pool, I couldn't adjust to the center pockets on pool tables. This alone made pool feel much harder than snooker to me. At least in snooker, I have 6 pockets to shoot for :P"

billiards,3bo6ow,fadedcheese,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:27:07 2015 UTC,"no no, i wasn't hoping for anything special, i figured it was pretty cheap anyway.   Thanks for the info."
billiards,3bo4dv,Silverball_billiards,3,Tue Jun 30 19:50:08 2015 UTC,"I've got a few different racks, I'll list them and say what I like and dislike about each.  Standard wooden rack: Pros: It matches my table and gives a decent rack.  Cons: It has to be turned a specific point forward to give a good rack, it can warp, it can break from being dropped(I've broken one before)  Flimsy plastic rack: Pros: Dirt cheap. Cons: It doesn't give a decent rack and bends on itself when you try to use it.  Magic racks: Pros: They're pretty good, they give a good rack, they seem to have minimal affect on the ball movement when rolling over the rack, they're relatively cheap for how solid of a rack they give consistently. Cons: I consider them disposable, they will get bent and not give the right rack anymore, racking can be slower with the magic rack compared to standard racks.  Hard plastic: Pros: It's cheap, it gives a good rack, it can take a serious beating. Cons: It's ugly.  Delta 13 elite: Pros: Extremely consistent racks, it comes with its exact measurements and a serial number, it can take a beating, it's light. Cons: It's ridiculously expensive, it's extremely loud unless you buy the leather inserts to quiet it down."
billiards,3bo4dv,joeprentice90,0,Wed Jul 1 03:10:50 2015 UTC,"As someone ignorant, but trying to read this info objectively, it seems you may have listed these worst to best.

billiards,3bo4dv,mattdebrown,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:16:31 2015 UTC,"K sorry should have googled first but Ya, super expensive, and loud due to aluminum but would be negligible versus the sound of breaking so hard to qualify as a con? Eh? Hehe wth"
billiards,3bo4dv,mattdebrown,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:20:00 2015 UTC,"You're right, in my opinion, that's worst to best. And the delta 13, the balls rattle it and make it echo, it's made of aluminum. Think of throwing the balls at a cookie sheet. The leather inserts absorb it though, so it sounds like a normal rack if you get them."
billiards,3bo4dv,joeprentice90,2,Wed Jul 1 13:47:44 2015 UTC,I like the Diamond wood rack that comes with their tables. It's machined and one of the better wood racks out there. You can order them from Diamond or I think Seyeberts or Ozone might have them. I've run into some woodworkers across the country that make racks of similar quality for a bit cheaper. They are harder to find as most just make them for guys in their area and sell a few on the side. The one around here I knew died a few years back.  The Delta 13 is a very nice rack. It's just pricey. It is loud without the leather inserts and I would recommend adding them if you are already willing to spend this type of money. I've also noticed the inserts kinda press back into the balls help keeping the balls tight. Kinda similar to how some use their hands to press them frozen. It's a minimal effect but I like it.  I pretty much agree with /u/joeprentice90 with what he's said about the other rack types.
billiards,3bo4dv,fadedcheese,2,Wed Jul 1 14:59:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've used the diamond rack and think it's a good rack. But I use it rarely, so I figured I'd only say which ones I personally own and have used."
billiards,3bo4dv,joeprentice90,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:22:18 2015 UTC,"Joe put up a good list. I like the hard plastic ones from a straight up value perspective. I have seen a broken one or two at commercial establishments, but I've had mine for over 10 years without any problems. If you want to solve the ugliness problem, I spray painted mine and put on a clear coat finish."
billiards,3bo4dv,trickshottim,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:10:14 2015 UTC,"My personal preference is for magic racks, but a fellow in my league has a Don's Rack (http://www.amazon.com/Dons-Rack-Precision-Pool-Ball/dp/B001FYJVGO/) and it's pretty darned good. Worth the money, I'd say."

billiards,3bl68t,poshio,2,Tue Jun 30 05:30:30 2015 UTC,"That's a great shot, thanks for posting it. While he was thinking what to do I wondered if he might go rail-first on the 2. I think the result could have been similar that way. What do you think?"
billiards,3bl68t,ricky_clarkson,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:18:35 2015 UTC,"The masse shot is a slightly higher percentage shot here. Though that's only if you are equally as good at both shot selections here. The rail first shot is certainly doable, but it's lying slightly awkward in this situation. He actually has less cue ball control if he goes rail first here than he does with the masse.  For this shot, when the balls are close and straight in and you need to get an angle, you need to hit the shot hard so that the masse doesn't take effect until after you've hit the object ball. You can also hop over obstructing object balls (depending on how close they are and how you hit it) and still get down table. It's a great shot to practice and have in your arsenal."
billiards,3bl68t,PulseAmplification,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:27:54 2015 UTC,Is it a masse or is he just jumping the ball and landing on the rail to come down table?
billiards,3bl68t,quizzelsnatch,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:47:14 2015 UTC,"He had a slight angle to go into the cushion, but he was way too flat on the ball to get back down table without the masse. Notice on the overhead view how he loads it up with left when he is jacked up.  As mentioned before, this shot is a lot easier when it's straight in. When it has a really flat angle like the shot here it's a bit more difficult, but not an ultra low percentage shot to pull off.  Put it this way- if he didn't jack up and shot with a level cue (pretend there was no ball obstructing him from having a close to level stroke) and slammed the ball with center stun, the cue ball would go into the rail just like it did and then travel a foot at the most.   There is another shot as you mentioned where you can play a slight jump on the cueball so that it bounces just enough to land on the point of the cushion on the way down that can send it down table, but he needed just a little more angle on the shot for that to be there.   Plus, that shot itself is the kind of shot where you only want to play it as a last ditch effort. Too many things can go wrong. There's also another shot which is very similar to the one just mentioned, where you pop it with a slightly jacked up cue with high inside, and the cue ball will literally hop up on top of the rail and travel a bit before dropping back down onto the cloth into the side rail, and the inside (which is actually running english for this type of shot in the video) gives it a boost. A friend taught me that shot a while back but I've only hit it once or twice in practice. It's way too low percentage for me to ever try in a match. But it's there and it's a possibility.  Crazy how there are almost always multiple choices for shots that look like there is only one choice. Just gotta have the know-how by seeing it done and then practicing it and learning how to hit it and developing the muscle memory for that kind of stroke."

You won't need nearly as much English as normal play, but you may put some top/bottom on breaks and you very well may be putting left and right on jump shots."

billiards,3bf5es,petester,3,Sun Jun 28 17:49:15 2015 UTC,"Your standard 8-ball and 9-ball are the easiest.  9-ball focuses on cue-ball control and 8-ball focuses on shot-selection.  Both require different safety strategies.  10-ball is similar to 9-ball with a more difficult break.  14.1 and one-pocket are definitely on the harder end of the scale.  Both strongly favor safety-play and require your entire repertoire of skill shots (banks, kicks, caroms, masse, etc).  I'd put snooker and 3-cushion as the hardest, but I've had little experience with them except a few fun games here and there at my local pool halls.  I'll let the snooker and 3-cushion experts chime in on those."
billiards,3bf5es,elint,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:28:55 2015 UTC,"As a predominantly pool player that plays 3 cushion at least 3 times a week, I am lucky to score a point, let alone string together multiple.  That game is seriously difficult."
billiards,3bf5es,vitalxx,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:31:54 2015 UTC,"I think cross training in snooker can really help smoothing out a player's cueing techniques. Imperfect cueing is far more glaring in snooker due to the smaller balls and pockets. Having a smooth cueing action is (in my opinion) THE most important aspect of any cue sport.  OP, you don't have to do much for this; just shoot straight in shots over and over again. It's not necessary to shift to a snooker stance for this practice. Use your pool stance and your pool cue. After about 100 hours or so, you should end up with a far more precise (and CONSISTENTLY reproducible) shooting routine.  I wouldn't recommend doing anything other than this, unless you want to become a snooker player. Snooker is different enough from pool that you are better off practicing on a pool table for everything else.   Take a simple half ball cut shot, for example. Unless the object ball is right next to the pocket, a contact point that's 0.5mm off will likely cause the object ball to miss the pocket completely. We spend hundreds of hours to sharpen our senses to be accurate enough to pot balls. While a cool skill to have, you don't need this kind of precision in pool. You are better off spending 10-20 hours learning this shot, and spend the rest of the time learning how to get shape off this half ball cut shot."
billiards,3bf5es,HappySoda,2,Sun Jun 28 21:06:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I play a mix of snooker, English 8 ball, and 9 ball mostly, and all three have such different tables and play styles.  Lots of people assume that being a good snooker player makes you an automatically good 9 ball player but the manner of shotmaking differs so much between the games. Positional play in snooker is primarily stun and screw shots, whereas in 9 ball it is more common to cheat the pocket and play with some sort of side, as well as taking the cueball around a couple cushions to get to the next ball.  I get sick of the argument that I see on youtube videos all the time that usually goes along the lines of ""hurr durr snooker is better than pool"". It's not better or worse, it's just a different game. I grew up on snooker, but I love 9 ball just as much."

billiards,3bf5es,admiral-trapbar,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:09:01 2015 UTC,"i agree with this. playing snooker requires you to be a very straight shooter, no cheating pockets etc. i play pool mostly, but play snooker once a week or so. i think playing on a snooker table really helps me shoot straighter and lessens the intimidation factor of playing on a 9 ft table. different games; but for a beginner i think the snooker table really exposes stroke imperfections and i also recommend playing on a snooker table to beginners especially. but the games are still different, different stroke imo. play 9 ball with regular pool balls on a snooker table :O"

billiards,3bf5es,xmpx,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:38:24 2015 UTC,"people are good at certain games and certain tables, every game requires a certain skill set, every game has a certain stroke. you can be playing one game good on a given day and one game bad. but i think its good to be a well rounded player and have experience in all facets of billiards. players who can switch up the game and stroke are very strong and well rounded players. games like one pocket and straight pool try to eliminate luck factors that come with 8 ball and 9 ball. there is nothing wrong with trying any game, each game teaches you something different but when you play stronger players these games will expose your flaws more- a good player will NOT give you many chances, and when you do get an open window you have to be confident in your knowledge and abilities to execute that difficult shot. if you are a new player who is still learning the basics playing these games its like jumping chapters in a book. but still even when i was first beginning one pocket taught me a lot about the importance of subtitles in cue ball control and defense, decision making. but try them out, you will learn some important stuff.  8 ball- pattern play, you determine the run out.  9 ball- shot making, the table determines the run out.   straight pool- pattern play, working in traffic, breaking out packs with stroke  1 pocket- defense, strategy, shot making"
billiards,3bf5es,SeabrookMiglla,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:20:50 2015 UTC,"I'd stick with 8 and 9 ball to work on getting your mechanics down first. These games are a tad easier with less to focus on. You want to build a solid foundation with stance, stroke and cue control. One pocket requires much more strategy and is considered the chess of the pool world because there can be so many moves. If you can play good one pocket you can generally play about any other pool game well though. It just requires about all kinds of shots."

billiards,3bdia7,The_shady_burrito,2,Mon Jun 29 02:50:33 2015 UTC,Why would you automatically move to selling your cue and getting a new one? Matching a collar isn't as complicated nor as expensive as some people think. As long as you have the correct materials and/or the old collar it shouldn't take longer than 2-3 days as most of the time is used for the glue to properly dry before spraying the clear on.
billiards,3bdia7,Thatdallasguy,2,Mon Jun 29 17:04:43 2015 UTC,Like /u/gabrielleigh said it's about $50-100 to match that collar. That along with the new shaft can add up. I think /u/The_shady_burrito was implying for that cost you could consider selling the cue and finding one with the OB shaft that already has a matching collar. It's possible doing this would result in the same money invested and maybe stepping up to a nicer cue from the used market. It was just his opinion and he just offered the OP another option to consider.

billiards,3bdia7,SirNoobs,2,Wed Jul 1 16:40:30 2015 UTC,"The way it's usually done (from what I understand) is you'd buy a blank like this: http://www.amazon.com/OB-2-Shafts-Partial-Blank-11-75mm/dp/B001R0QVU0  Then you'd get a cuesmith to match the collar.  But I think with something like that it's going to be difficult to get an exact match.  I don't think it's a crazy amount over the cost of the materials.    Edit: the difficulty being the pearl material, getting something that matches how the grains flow."

billiards,3bdia7,supererk,2,Sun Jun 28 13:44:03 2015 UTC,/u/Thatdallasguy summed it up well here.  You can either:   chop off the collar on an existing shaft and put the ring on a new shaft have Viking send you a collar and you would find somebody to match it to your cue have a cuemaker build the collar for you   Contact OB and Viking and see what they can do for you.

billiards,3bczcg,gabrielleigh,2,Sun Jun 28 01:46:50 2015 UTC,"My specialty is building custom jump and jump/break cues, so I can answer any questions you might have about them.   I have been experimenting with three-piece jumpers for about a decade now, and they offer some flexibility in jumping that simply isn't available with the two piece jumpers. The advantages of this added flexibility are fairly small and there are arguments that the advantages are not really even substantial enough to really be worth the extra work in building the cue this way.   For me, my confidence in jumping relies pretty heavily on my familiarity with my jump cue. I have a very intimate knowledge of what I can expect it to do, and not do, in any configuration I have it setup in.   For example, for straightforward long jump shots where you need accuracy to hit a ball that is six feet away from the cueball (or even farther), I prefer to have the jump cue set up in the longest possible configuration to allow me to jump as accurately as possible at long distance. On the flip side, if the jump distance is extremely short... I prefer to jump with just the shaft so I can maximize my ability to control the cueball and not have it bounce off the table.   Jump shots where the obstructing ball is very close to the CB require you to remove as much weight as possible from the cue to allow the cue to deflect out of the way of the ascending CB after it bounces off the table bed and begins its upward trip into the air. In those circumstances I love to use short, ultralight setups that are eight ounces or lighter. I often jump with just a shaft for these super-close situations.   When you have a few inches of room between the CB and the obstructing ball, you can utilize a bit of extra length and weight in the cue to reduce the stroke strength necessary to clear the obstructing ball.   The advantages of the three-piece jump system are that you can more precisely ""fine tune"" the jump cue weight to suit the circumstances of the jump shot. Granted, this adjustment range is fairly small, but for some players it allows them to create a jump cue configuration that boosts their confidence in that particular shot that would have been slightly lower than attempting the shot with a two-piece cue. It is mostly a mental thing, and mental things can be a huge factor in confidence during tough shots.   As far as tips go, I used to be a die-hard phenolic guy. As my stroke improved and my technique grew to incorporate using more english in my jump shots, I eventually began to feel like my CB control during a jump shot was too limited by the phenolic and G-10 materials. I tried out a Samsara jump/break tip and fell in love with it immediately. For my personal play style and stroke, I feel like I might have to add about 5% more speed to achieve the same jump height with the Samsara (as compared to phenolics), but the amount of control I have is exponentially higher so I feel like it is well worth the tradeoff in my case.   Another factor that I feel impacts whether a two or three piece jump cue is really necessary has to do with the table you play on. For bar box pool, the range of distances you typically need to jump is a bit more confined than if you played on regulation 9 foot tables. A two piece jump cue covers pretty much all the situations I find myself in on a bar box, but I regularly play on 9 foot Gold Crown tables and I really like the extra length of my 3-piece jump systems (~45"" compared to ~40"" for my two-piece cues).  Hell, about half the time I need to jump on a 9-foot table I just grab my Samsara-tipped break cue and jump full cue with it.   All in all, it comes down to pure personal preference. If your confidence is improved with a three-piece system, then I'd say the three-piece system is better for your particular playing style. If you don't see any benefit after trying one, then the two-piece cues will be cheaper and simpler for you in the long run. Everyone is different, and neither one is really better than the other by any means. Anyone who is pressuring you to go one way or the other is either just trying to sell you something, or impress you with their superior knowledge and experience. Trust your gut and go with whatever feels the best after you have tried them all out."
billiards,3bczcg,gabrielleigh,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:18:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! Just about every bar near me is 7ft diamonds, so it's a ton of short jumps usually. I rarely make it out to 9ft tables but do play on my 8ft quite a bit at home. I'll have to try some 3 piece ones out and check out the samsara tip instead of the phenolic. Are there any cues that come with that tip to start? I'd really prefer to try the tip of before buying a cue and switching the tip  and finding out I don't like it. Would you mind looking at cheapcues.com and finding a few jump cues you'd recommend trying? They're the shop near me, so I could try any of those in person. Or do you still sell cues? I recall reading you had to get out of the business due to health issues."
billiards,3bczcg,Justinlx,2,Sun Jun 28 03:29:26 2015 UTC,"Those $39.00 jump cues on cheapcues.com work great. I'd expect that on a 7ft table those would cover pretty much any situation you'll find yourself in. The first jump cue I ever owned was one of the early Lucasi L2000JC cues which used to be about $40 back in the day, and I learned a lot about jumping with one of those economical cues. I can't say for sure if any cues ship with the Samsara tip, but a lot of the cue selling sites will install one before they ship the cue to you for an additional fee. The best way I can describe the Samsara is it seems like petrified leather to me. I don't know exactly what it is made of or how they make them, but the material is ridiculously hard yet it scuffs well and holds chalk quite a bit better than phenolic materials.   I don't sell factory cues like what is on that website you mentioned, but I still do some custom building now that my health is improving a bit."
billiards,3bczcg,fadedcheese,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:42:53 2015 UTC,"I'll give those a try, if that's all I'm paying, I wouldn't be upset buying it and tossing the samsara tip on even if I end up preferring phenolic. It could just be a house cue for my home table. Thanks for taking a look, and I'm glad to hear your health is improving!"

billiards,3bafze,mohrt,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:06:20 2015 UTC,"I have seen a lot of people have fantastic luck with the J&J break cues. For the money, they make a pretty damn durable breaker that will take a lot of abuse. About the only regular maintenance issue I see with them is they often come with a cheaper ""chinese phenolic"" ferrule/tip material that cracks and chunks a bit easier than some of the premium (also more expensive) domestic phenolics. Some people break with these cues for years without any problems, though. For a budget breaker, I think they are great for the money.   In the same ballpark of $100, you can also get a cheap sneaky pete cue and have it topped with good ferrule and break tip if you have access to cue repair services in your area."

billiards,3bafze,b1gkat,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:12:45 2015 UTC,"They have more technology about them, whether it be weight bolt slots, carbon fiber components, radial splicing, etc.   As for the BK2, I really hate thicker shafts, so although I felt that the J&J was a good J/B (especially good jumper IMO), I could never get comfortable with it after getting used to my ~12.5mm pro taper shafts for normal play. This shaft size consistency was the biggest reason for me to jump ship from the J&J."
billiards,3bafze,asamimasa,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:16:02 2015 UTC,"The Spark Break cue is available cheap and breaks like a monster.  I've had mine for 2 years and couldn't be happier.  It incidentally is the exact same design, size, and specs as the older original Predator Break that a buddy of mine has.  He paid $225 for his, mine was $75, and is exactly the same in looks, balance, and feel, just missing the puttytat.  I paired mine with a Picone White Diamond Tip and it breaks unbelievably well.  All in, the cue with a super hard ferrule and tip I'm into it for $100.  It's not special looking and garners no attention in the pool hall, until you smash the pack."

billiards,3ba57u,EtDM,3,Sat Jun 27 11:35:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, each player has either the white or yellow ball as their cueball, and must always shoot that ball. The red ball is always neutral.

To score a point, your cueball must contact both of the other balls on the table, and must have contacted at least three rails before touching the second ball.

You'll love him after that, he's a great guy and pool player. I think we need people as passionate as him in the game and around kids.. Plus he his great with kids.   mike is still a great pool player and I respect him, but he is an ass. I'm sure he is a great guy off the table but I haven't seen anything about it.  Also Shane isn't much like tiger woods in my opinion. Granted He has been playing since he was 2, he has a certain confidence when he is at the table, but all in all he is a humble guy. Haha he look he gives when he misses isn't a confused look like ""somebody tampered with the table"" look, more of a ""I can do better, or I won't miss that next time"".

billiards,3b8vqa,mattdebrown,4,Fri Jun 26 22:35:52 2015 UTC,"I have probably ran over a hundred small tournaments and some of the best suggestions I can think of are to keep the finances very open and transparent. Let people know ahead of time how the payout will be split up. I also seem to have good luck with having players draw cards to determine bracket position. When the players draw for spots, there are never any mumblings about the bracket getting ""set up"" to favor anybody.   If the players are all fairly experienced with no huge gaps in skill, then a race to three works pretty well. If you have a huge range of skills from beginner to very advanced, then the short race to two games is better because the novice players simply don't have any chance at all in a longer race against better players. You can handicap the tournament to balance things out, but putting ratings on people can cause drama and problems in some circumstances. Some groups of players get along just fine in rated setups, other people seem to prefer a regular set race of some kind.   Running a ""calcutta"", or player auction, can boost the interest in the tournament because it gives the players a second avenue to potentially earn money and it also can attract non-players to participate and spectate in the auction and tournament which is always good for the establishment to make some extra revenue off food and drinks. The calcutta can be a big draw, but be mindful that it adds some extra time and attention to get it set up and settled up with all the bidders.   Last but not least, take plenty of time to go over the rules and expectations before the first match is called to the tables. Make sure everyone understands any special ""house rules"", and they need to understand whether to expect ball-in-hand after fouls, or if they need to play from the kitchen. There are many acceptable and fun formats which can be used, but the important part is that the players fully understand and agree with these rules before they begin playing so that drama is minimized.  Check around with local businesses to see if there is any sponsorship interests. Lots of places have boxes and boxes of free stuff that they would gladly donate in exchange for a little bit of advertisement space and commercial promotion. Ask around and you may be surprised what kinds of things could be added to the cash pot as bonus prizes, door prizes, raffle items, and other neat things.   Everyone comes to a tournament for the pool, of course, but you can really enhance the experience by tossing in some unexpected surprises like raffles and bonus prizes too.   You can actually leave a lot of the decision making about the format up to the players. If you are unsure what the best format would be, simply conduct a vote during your pre-tournament meeting with everyone who is there to play. Some days everyone is in the mood to play 9-ball, other days they want 8-ball. If you plan on a reoccurring tournament, then you can alternate the format so everyone gets a chance to play their preferred game."

If you have a huge range of skills from beginner to very advanced, then the short race to two games is better because the novice players simply don't have any chance at all in a longer race against better players.   Do you have any suggestions on how to figure the handicap in a non-league environment? Someone runs a local tournament here and supposedly handicaps people, but nearly everyone plays a race to 4. There are guys who run racks consistently playing at the same handicap as guys who might break and run once a month. If everyone was APA or BCA then you could base it off their league handicaps. The only people who get a handicap other than 4 are generally women (they go to 3) and BCA Grand Masters (they go to 5). Seems a little skewed.   The calcutta can be a big draw, but be mindful that it adds some extra time and attention to get it set up and settled up with all the bidders.   No shit. This adds like 45 minutes to an hour if you have a fairly large field of players. I show up late just so I don't have to sit through it."
billiards,3b8vqa,dalgeek,3,Sat Jun 27 02:25:27 2015 UTC,"Eh, if you have all familiar players then you can break them down into some simple ranks. 1-4 is simpler than the conventional 2-7, or 2-10 systems that the big league systems use. All the best players can go to 4 games. The ones playing a ball or so below that go to 3 games. The truly mediocre players can go to 2 games. If you want to take the luck out of it all and promote a ""earn your wins"" atmosphere, you can take out the automatic win for making the 8 on the break too. I'd keep the races at least to 2 games for the weakest players, though.   More than anything else, I'd ask the players what they think would be the most fun and the most competitive way they can all match up against each other and get a good game where they have to play well to win.   And yeah, the calcutta will basically draw the line between a very casual tournament and a semi-serious tournament. It will really slow things down and take some work to add that to the tournament though.   My favorite tournament of the year is our ""Ultimate Ring Game"" 10-ball tournament. It is invitation only, and we usually have 8-10 guys playing on one table. We use poker chips, everyone starts with 50 chips each. You ""ante"" into each game to start (one chip ante at the start of the tournament, doubling each hour). Whoever makes the 10 ball gets the pot each game. Every hour on the hour the ante doubles and you redraw for shooting order with the winner of the last rack automatically being first in the order when he/she breaks the first rack of the new hour. Effin' fun tournament format, and it is hilarious to watch the other players shit when they get low on chips. Crazy pressure, feels like a mix of pool and Texas hold'em TV poker."
billiards,3b8vqa,gabrielleigh,3,Sat Jun 27 02:44:46 2015 UTC,"I've ran 219 tournaments over the past four years and here's some advice off the top of my head.  Note that a lot of this applies to recurring tournaments more than one-off invitational types like you're suggesting.  Hopefully you can find something in here that's helpful....  A)) Starting on time is crucial.  Starting even 10 minutes late should be a calculated decision that you make in rare circumstances.  If people are used to it starting late then they'll start showing up later and later and it can get out of control.  B)) Stay consistent in your payout structure and post exact payouts as soon as there are no more byes to fill (and thus no more money coming into the pot to change the payouts.)  C)) Know your rules.  When a player asks what happens when an object ball was jumped off the table, know the answer.  The shooter accidentally disturbed two object balls, what happens?  D)) Be hyper-aware of any matches that have been called up but haven't started.  If you're not careful, you can look two players in the eye and tell them that they're up on table four and a half hour later figure out that they never even started because one of them thought you meant ""on deck"".  E)) Never make quick decisions based on player feedback.  For example, they will always ask for longer races and never consider that the tournament won't finish in time.  Listen to what they have to say and make changes slowly when you see trends in complaints from diverse sources.  F)) Be consistent with format and rules.  It's tempting to increase races when you have lower turnout, and sometimes it's needed, but if you're making the tournament take just as long then you may not be leaving room for it to grow.  G)) Run one every week without skipping any.  People like to be able to count on it when they're in the mood to shoot.  H)) Run a side pot or two a little later into the tournament once things settle down and you don't need all of the tables anymore (9ball break pot, 3 ball shootout, etc.  I can give more details if needed.)  Find a trusted volunteer to sell tickets before people start getting knocked out which will help keep some of them from leaving early.  Now for a shameless plug!  I wrote and maintain a free website called nomadpool.com that helps to run tournaments and keep track of history and stats.  Some of the features include...   Nomad draws the brackets for you so you don't have to spend important time fumbling around with peas or playing cards before matches even start. The system keeps track of the waiting list and table assignments for you.  After you start, all you have to do is report who wins each match and everything else is automatic. Remote spectators can view the live bracket (and ustream!) on the tournament page over the internets. Can be hooked up to a TV to display a waiting list (this will drastically reduce the amount of times you're asked ""when am I up next?"") Sends text messages to players when they're up to play.  Useful when people are outside smoking or whatnot. You can post your tournament page on Facebook (or reddit!) to give people a place to get info and even sign up early. You can send out a mass text message to your recent players to invite/remind them to show up and play Check out nomadpool.com"

billiards,3b60yd,lordswagg1,2,Fri Jun 26 18:47:07 2015 UTC,"I use the chalk pictured and it lasts a decent amount. You could get it to last a rack if you didn't have to use any heavy english or kick at a ball but I tend to chalk every 2 to 3 shots, or when I am waiting for the other person. Part of it is nervous habit and part of it is seeking the perfectly chalked cue which is honestly impossible in my eyes, as I always see somewhere it can be touched up or something of that nature."
billiards,3b60yd,Pilfered,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:43:11 2015 UTC,"I think it sticks a little better than Master, but chalk is chalk if you use it before every shot.

Dr Dave did a series of chalk test experiments that are pretty interesting. Skip to 17:03 if you just want to see a summary of the results."

billiards,3b507g,BryanH912,5,Fri Jun 26 00:47:04 2015 UTC,"First break and run came about 6 mos after I started playing 9 ball; it helped that I dropped 3 or 4 balls on the break. I didn't have another one for a while until I started working on my breaks.  The most important part of running a rack is controlling your break. You don't need a 30mph break. You need to get a good spread, pot at least one ball, and leave the cue ball somewhat in the middle of the table.  You can still be very successful at 9-ball even if you can't break and run consistently. If you can't see a run, play defense, or run until it's convenient to play defense. Nothing worse than running 7 balls in a game of 9 ball and getting stuck :)"
billiards,3b507g,dalgeek,2,Fri Jun 26 06:47:35 2015 UTC,"Billiards will always be challenging!   I've been playing for almost a year now and I believe my first 9 ball run out was around my 8th month. I wouldn't worry too much though! In my opinion, running out a rack before you are able to get decent shape after every shot is mostly based on what position the balls are in after the break, and how many were potted on the break. For my first run out it was pretty simple -- the next ball I needed to shoot was always easy to get shape on with a simple draw, follow, or stop shot. For now, just focus on running out a couple of balls at a time, and learn how to shoot simple safeties. Always ask yourself if you're playing to win, or playing to get better. Winning is fun and satisfactory, but improvement is key in the long run. Sorry if I typed too much, just wanted to speak my mind from a relatively new player to another.  I'm sure you'll get your first run out soon, and if you do it will feel amazing. Keep practicing and happy shooting!"

I was using heavy english during that time which negatively impacted my game until I got it down.  Once I understood squirt and throw my game improved dramatically and at 1.5 years I ran a 3 pack and felt amazing.  Keep it up.  You will get there.  Try not to think about the end result and shoot each shot without the break and run in mind.
billiards,3b507g,gotwired,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:35:50 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about it. It will come in time. It doesn't really matter if you are able to break and run or not until your break and run percentage becomes high enough that they actually start showing up regularly in matches, which will only come a long time after your first break and run (or even your first medium-sized package)."

I think improving your average ball run is more important to focus on than break and runs initially. The break and runs will come with higher frequency once you become a more consistent shooter. I think pros average like 15 or 20% break and run. But if they are in stroke they can put together 3-5 racks no problem

billiards,3b507g,CreeDorofl,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:47:17 2015 UTC,It took me about a little less than a year. It was in friday night mini tournament on a 9ft gold crown. I lost the match but didn't care as I was so happy to finally get the break N run. As a bonus it was against the most hated guy in the room.
billiards,3b507g,iWeyerd,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:55:51 2015 UTC,"I wanna say it might have been over a year, but that's a vague guess. I don't think I'm a slow learner, but I do think I learned the wrong way, with bad fundamentals and bad habits (such as putting sidespin on every shot, and starting to use it way too early).  I see so many guys saying ~6 months... that's awesome. Do NOT sweat it, even if it takes over a year.  Try hard to learn the right way, with good fundamentals. If you play golf you already know that inconsistent fundamentals will kill you.   I consider THE definitive book on fundamentals to be mark wilson's ""play great pool"" but it's expensive. Don't mind the somewhat amateur website, the book itself is very well done and the guy writing it is a rare blend of pro-level skills and excellent ability to explain things like an instructor should. http://playgreatpool.com/InstructionBook.aspx  If you can't afford that, a nice shortcut in the meantime is Ray Martin's ""99 critical shots"" book. It can be had for less than 10 bucks from a variety of sites, just google it. It will tell you how to handle super common situations. In fact, in most 9-ball racks, every single shot in the rack will be one that's covered in that book.   Good luck to you."
billiards,3b507g,Diial,-3,Fri Jul 10 16:33:21 2015 UTC,I can break and run a 9 ball rack in about 60 seconds.

billiards,3b2cdb,daymoonbeam,9,Thu Jun 25 12:12:24 2015 UTC,"20-0 in your LTC, against the top competition in your league?  Baggers."
billiards,3b2cdb,elint,3,Thu Jun 25 14:32:05 2015 UTC,"Not familiar with how apa works, can you explain?"
billiards,3b2cdb,admiral-trapbar,7,Thu Jun 25 16:56:48 2015 UTC,"APA 9-ball is like straight pool with 9 balls.  You don't play to sink the 9, you play to sink the most balls and score the most points.  Each ball is worth a point, 9-ball is worth 2 points, so each rack is worth 10.  Sinking the 9-ball doesn't give you a ""win"", it just gives you 2 points and lets you break the next rack.  Each skill level (people are ranked 1-9, with 9 being the strongest) has to get to a certain number of points: 14, 19, 25, 31, 38, 46, 55, 65, 75.  When somebody reaches their goal and wins the match, the 20 match points are divvied up based on how badly they beat their opponent.  If the loser is a skill level 5 and makes fewer than 7 balls, it's a 20-0 shutout.  If the loser was close to winning, then the winner gets 12 to the loser's 8 points.  On the low-end of the scale, with two 1s playing each other, one would have to make 14 balls before the other makes 3.  Likewise with the best players -- 9s, one would have to make 75 balls before the other makes 18.  Here's the score chart (left column is loser's skill level, and then scan across to how many balls they made, then go up to the column heading for the score): http://i.imgur.com/CHdKNax.png  Shutouts and even 19-1 and 18-2 are rare, but you see a few each season.  You'll most commonly see them when a brand-new guy is actually a 1 or 2, but he has to start their first week as a 4 (males start at skill level 4, then their handicap starts to settle as they play games).  For a team to kick enough ass to get to their LTC (local team championship), but still lose 20-0 makes me think their opponent was sandbagging a wee bit, or the stars aligned (which admittedly does happen, but I'll play the odds every day)."
billiards,3b2cdb,elint,4,Thu Jun 25 17:10:06 2015 UTC,"So sandbagging in this case would be the players that won having a lower recorded apa skill level than they actually play at so they have less work to do to get a 20-0 shutout?  I've been on this sub for about two years and still have trouble getting my head around apa, and more and more it strikes me as a bizarrely convoluted system."
billiards,3b2cdb,admiral-trapbar,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:09:07 2015 UTC,"APA's not difficult to understand.  It's a handicapped sport.  Just like a lot of amateur bowling leagues and golf groups.  Any time a sport allows amateur players to handicap their score to level the playing field, you will have people cheating the system to appear weaker than they really are so they can kick somebody's ass when it's really needed.  People like to complain about APA, but this phenomenon has always been around when you allow handicaps in ANY competitive sport.  Basically, you have 2 options:   force everybody to play straight-up games, and the better player will win more often than not.  This is obviously the best choice for professional competition.  It is also used in a lot of BCA leagues, but it can easily scare away new players. Allow for some kind of handicapping system.  People will cheat the system and hopefully the management can be vigilant enough to cull the weeds and keep everybody on a level playing field, but there will always be an influx of cheaters trying to get ahead.  The level playing field is still very appealing for bringing new players into the sport.   Any league that claims to be better than the APA (competitors like NAPA and TAP) just use different handicapping systems and can be just as exploited.  It really comes down to the people who run your local league and how well they monitor for cheating and fix problems as they arise.  EDIT: and to answer your question, yes, sandbagging is consistently missing shots during the season to appear weaker and play at a lower skill level, then when your team gets you into the big tournament, playing your ass off and scoring 40% of your team's points (5 players, matches worth 20 points, so it's a race to 51 and this dude scored 20-0)."
billiards,3b2cdb,elint,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:24:23 2015 UTC,If you play to well above your handicap in Vegas you get moved up 2 skill levels and can't ever be moved back down from what I understand.
billiards,3b2cdb,col4bin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:11:27 2015 UTC,"Not quite true.  See rule 27 for the exact wording on excessive skill level movement.  Basically, if you play far above your skill level you can be moved up.  If you move up 2 levels, you're usually disqualified from the tournament.  I've seen entire teams disqualified, and I've even seen individual players receive 1- or 2-year bans from APA.  The wording of the rule is vague, though and says it's mostly up to the discretion of the tournament director.  It's also true that the highest skill-level you attain in Vegas is your new ""lowest-attainable"" skill level and you can't drop below that.  That happens even if you don't cheat.  The only way to drop below this skill level is by having your league office petition the national office to unlock your level.  I've seen people get injured or have other life events happen that significantly hampered their skill level and Nationals has allowed our league to lower them a few skill levels."
billiards,3b2cdb,elint,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:30:43 2015 UTC,Sandbagging essentially means they play like shit all session on purpose to hopefully get dropped a skill rank then play to their normal ability when it's easier to win once they're in playoffs. Happens constantly in APA

billiards,3b2eqr,fadedcheese,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:34:32 2015 UTC,"Former worker at OB here! You can always opt to send your cue along with your OB1 shaft into OB. You definitely have a couple of options.    You can send your old shaft along with the OB1 and butt and they can rob the collar off of the old shaft and place it on the new. This would be the easiest option, if you do not care about keeping the old shaft. Once the collar is robbed, the old shaft is pretty much rendered useless.  Contact the maker of the cue, ask them to send just a collar to you so you can have it placed on your new shaft. Send the collar, shaft, and cue butt in to OB and they can match the collar work and make it flush on your cue.  If neither option above would work for you, OB can, to the best of their ability, build a matching collar for your shaft to match your cue. Keep in mind that the materials might be a little different as some cue makers use what other production company's do not.    Hope this helps!  Didn't realize that you said you already have a matching collar being sent to you. OB cues in Plano TX can definitely get it done for you."
billiards,3b2eqr,Thatdallasguy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:36:43 2015 UTC,I'd say option one should really never be done except to an already ruined shaft. Not having the original shaft generally hurts the resale on custom cues.

billiards,3avs3s,SeabrookMiglla,3,Wed Jun 24 00:37:43 2015 UTC,"Back in the 90's I used to enjoy our APA league. The competition was fierce, the money was decent. My early years of league play really helped me learn to control my nerves and build my appreciation of playing against lots of different players in a competitive environment.   As I became more experienced and saw the league transition into the 2000's, the money began to really dry up as the business seemed to shift more and more of the revenues away from the local payout and more toward national tournament funding. I don't know what the actual percentages look like, but from my perspective things sure looked worse and worse as the years went on. I haven't played in the APA in many years, but my friends who still play say it is certainly nothing they do expecting any kind of sizeable payout (even when they win first place). My impression is that the APA is a hobby you invest your money into and your reward is the enjoyment of playing in a very low-level competitive environment where money is simply not the prize you play for anymore. A $3.00 plastic trophy, some bragging rights, and some experience under your belt.... those are the expected rewards in most leagues these days.   I hear people say all the time that their APA league is bustling and healthy and has respectable paybacks. My local league here in Kansas was just legally confiscated from the franchisee due to mismanagement and loss of membership which caused ""damage to the brand name of the APA"" as I was told.   League circumstances seem to vary a lot from place to place. In my immediate area, the city leagues are booming and the traditional national sanctioned leagues like the APA and BCA are drying up and disappearing. In other areas (notably bigger cities), those leagues are flourishing and the players like their LO's because they run a tight ship and create a fun and satisfying league experience.   I think the APA has fully focused it's marketing efforts and business model in attracting very casual players who are generally new to the game and just want some friendly, low pressure competition. In my view, the really advanced players seem to feel like they simply outgrow leagues like the APA and they often tell me that they want something a little more competitive. The APA is still dogged by a handicap system that is very easy to manipulate through sandbagging. The ""slop"" rule is also very unappealing to the more advanced players who appreciate call-pocket rules.   I wouldn't write off the APA completely, but I always advise people to strongly reflect on what they wish to get out of playing in any league. The different leagues all seem to have a slightly different focus group of players they aim to attract. The APA seems to me to be the ""beginner league"" which is a good place to cut your teeth and learn the ropes and fundamentals of basic pool competition. If you grow beyond what the APA can provide, then leagues like BCA, TAP, VNEA, and a bunch of other leagues seem to shift the spectrum of skill upwards a bit and provide a bit tougher competition."
billiards,3avs3s,Justinlx,3,Wed Jun 24 03:36:18 2015 UTC,"i agree that the APA is more casual, friendly, and geared towards beginners, or people who want to socialize and meet new people. i learned a lot from APA league and became a better player because of it. got to talk with better players etc. and learn some important stuff. i also met some people that became friends outside of the pool hall. id say the APA model was successful in this regard.  but i think that you do begin to 'outgrow' APA in the sense that, you start only wanting to play people of similar or higher skills only. and motivation to beat a handicap against lower ranked players is not really good enough motivation to play your best.  all in all i think the APA serves its purpose well, but for people bashing the APA and the kind of people who play APA (which ive heard some pretty ridiculous and childish stories about certain teams at city and vegas) join a different league. i dont understand all of the hate, comes off as elitist when i hear people sneering at the APA. it is what it is. some of the best players i know play or have played in APA..."

LOL but that is what made it fun. everyone in the league was all actually very cool with each other and laid back, but despite being friends it got competitive on the table. but after a few seasons a lot of the players left that league, so its a lot of new people now. the feel kind of changed for that league with the change of people. nothing against them, just not the same crowd that i started with and were close with.  that particular pool hall had real shit tables, every table was different, which made nothing a gimme no matter how good you were. it was frustrating as hell sometimes, but made matches intense as hell!!"

billiards,3avs3s,Elephunk,3,Tue Jun 23 23:49:53 2015 UTC,"Which is strange because the president of the APA(Reneé Lyle-Beddingfield) is a woman and she has held the position for over 20 years.   The APA seems to be having a bit of an identity crisis. On one hand it makes serious efforts to foster female interest in pool. These efforts include female-only leagues, top-bill sponsorship of respected female players, and favorable skill level adjustments to counter the most common feedback from potential female players ... ""I'm not good enough.""   Then on the other is this bubbling ""casual sexism"". At local events its not uncommon hear lots of ""darlings"" and ""honies"" tossed around. Diminishing phrases like ""go easy on her"" or an unusual number of mid game stoppages to doll out advice to female players.  Not helping the matter are videos like this(http://bit.ly/1Ce3qoV). TL;DW Its a male trickshot artist jumping balls over his scantily clad assistant.  Its like the organization can't decide if its wants to be a place for ""everyone"" or if its demo is strictly dirty old men and boys that haven't quite clicked with adulthood.

billiards,3avs3s,JaktheAce,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:48:46 2015 UTC,"It's based on how you play. I believe the formula is (or so I have been told) the best 10 of your last 20 matches. The LOs enter the data from each score sheet, and the computer figures out your skill level."
billiards,3avs3s,mongshuel,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:20:15 2015 UTC,I disagree. Most guys end up starting as 3s. Women can now start as 2s in nine ball. Men have to play as 3s in 8 ball playoffs even if they are 2s in the regular season. Regular teams get a max of 23 for combined skill levels per night. Women's teams are limited to 19 points. The APA absolutely treats men and women differently.
billiards,3avs3s,JaktheAce,0,Wed Jun 24 17:09:33 2015 UTC,"Most guys do not start as 3's.  They start as 4's.  From the APA rule book:   Obviously, new players do not have a skill level established, so a standard starting method has been devised for new players. Statistics show that 73% of male players are SL4s and higher while 73% of female players are SL3s and below. Gentlemen will play their first match as a SL4; ladies will play their first match as a SL3. A League Operator is authorized to assign skill levels and lowest attainables to new players who are known highly skilled players or to players who have previously established skill levels in another format. If a player has previously established a skill level in the APA 9-Ball format, then he will begin play in 8-Ball with his current 9-Ball skill level.   Those are the rules of the APA.  If your division has different rules, it's an exception that your LO made."

We played maybe 5 games, and I easily beat him 5-0. While I was breaking down my cues, he came over to me and said, ""You're pretty good...for a girl.""   I have no doubt he would rate me lower than a man of equal skill. This type of system allows for too much personal bias."

billiards,3awwfx,too_late_to_party,5,Wed Jun 24 03:53:35 2015 UTC,"It's mostly technique. I used to find that my cue ball would stop instead of drawing too. The cue ball stops at the object ball because you're not imparting enough spin onto the cue ball. You need to make sure you're really hitting through the cue ball and make sure your tip is well chalked and shaped.  Secondly, you might not be finishing the cue tip at the right place - meaning, you're cueing low on the cue ball but when you go to hit it, your cue raises and you actually hit higher than you're cueing. Make sure your keep your head down and still and your cue level throughout the stroke. Try maybe a looser wrist."
billiards,3awwfx,SirNoobs,4,Wed Jun 24 04:44:42 2015 UTC,"Try lowering your bridge and getting your cue as close to parallel to the surface as you can without scraping it on the rails or banging your knuckles.

billiards,3awwfx,snowman818,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:15:55 2015 UTC,"That's what I've found-- when I'm hitting low and not getting draw, it's usually because I'm not keeping the cue level.

billiards,3awwfx,SeabrookMiglla,3,Sun Jul 5 03:23:31 2015 UTC,"just how i personally learned, take what i say with a grain of salt. just some things to think about...  it really is technique, physical strength is a plus i feel but not the main theme, drawing and following a ball with a lot of stroke goes back to form or kinetic energy/momentum. the way i got better at drawing, this is just me, id set up 2 balls and practice random draw shots and hit them over and over again until i developed those shoulder muscles to draw a ball in extreme fashion. having a perfectly level cue is so damn key in this game i really cant stress it enough... going smoothly through the cue ball with power, and not just fast- and- hard, is key to drawing or following good.   when i first started i used to use a lot of wrist snap technique for draw, and i still do use a wrist snap but with less frequency as i once did. for me now, the wrist snap is only used in certain situations. ive talked to really good players who dont snap the wrist and others that use a lot of wrist. watch--- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G13l_W_UI4 starting at 13:30 minutes  if i have two balls in a perfectly straight line with a 1-4 ft. of distance between each-other ill try to use 'bottom outside' and pocket the ball in a given pocket and 'curve' the cueball back with a wrist snap. i did this drill in various scenarios around the table for a good while when i was learning basic maneuvers, and still use this as a 'stroke check' drill when warming up.--- similar to this shot at 12:00 minutes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcOAHhHrng  when i draw a ball with power, it feels like im 'digging in' with my shoulder muscles. its really the only way i can describe it... its like anything else, hitting a baseball bat, golf club, punching- you just know through repetition when you hit it good.  watch some 'straight pool' AKA '14.1' on youtube to at least give you ideas of when to use a power stroke on a draw shot to break out clusters. and maybe practice breaking out clusters as they do, or at least try it. it will probably be over your head and overwhelming when seeing a pro do it with seemingly ease but like anything else it takes practice. practicing 14.1 immediately helped me understand the significance of the concept of learning how to  have a 'controlled stroke' used to break out packs. it really did.  honestly, letting out your stroke and power drawing a ball is not really too hard to do consistently. drawing a ball accurately when needing perfect position is verrrrry hard to do. whether that be drawing a ball exactly 6 feet,1 foot, 3 inches,1 inch or 1/2 inch. drawing to gain shape in a clustered table is very touchy, and you really need to pay attention to detail. bar tables can help you learn to navigate and controlling draw in small clustered spaces, in practical use, this is much more frequent and applicable in various pool games.  as they say, draw for show- follow for dough. the consensus is that draw is more unpredictable than follow.   but players use different routes, and playing style is different. to list a few, players like louie roberts (st. louis),bustamante, earl strickland were more draw oriented players when playing shape...."
billiards,3awwfx,ceezaleez,2,Thu Jun 25 08:34:58 2015 UTC,Are you hitting the cue ball where your aiming? You might be tightening up and striking the cue ball higher than you think. Also make sure your stick is as level as possible and your not shooting down on the ball.
billiards,3awwfx,MonsieurX,2,Wed Jun 24 06:29:55 2015 UTC,It's all about technique. I used to hit hard and low and usually miss or misscue.   Here's the things to work on:    how horizontal your cue is how low you hit how hard you hit how much you follow through your grip and how you flick or not your wrist (for added cue speed and effect - but dangerous for precision)
billiards,3awwfx,too_lazy_2_punctuate,3,Wed Jun 24 11:38:25 2015 UTC,That wrist flick is probably not worth mentioning to a guy having trouble putting English on the ball. It's just gonna get him in trouble.

billiards,3awwfx,gabrielleigh,3,Wed Jun 24 21:05:23 2015 UTC,"One thing I might recommend that hasn't been mentioned yet so far is to consider looking at the way your cue is setup as well. Just starting with the tip of the cue, you may find room to improve your draw quite a bit. An old tip that is worn down and flattened out will really impair your ability to draw the cueball. Likewise, a tip that is glazed over and stoned out might provide less grip than a tip with clean and fresh leather to grip the cueball. Check the condition of your tip to see if possibly you may be due for a new one or possibly just a fresh scuff and shape on your current tip.  If the condition of your tip seems pretty good, then consider the possibility that the hardness of your current tip might be affecting your draw. In general, for some people draw shots seem to take less effort with the softer tips compared to harder tips. There are even brands of tips that are being made with rubberized formulations of solutions within the leather that promote cueball grip for extreme english shots such as the draw shot. Tips such as the Kamui ""Black"" series are specifically designed for really strong english capabilities.   Also keep in mind that the taper profile of your shaft can really influence the ability to put english on the cueball. Thicker diameter shafts with stiffer tapers seem to put less spin on the ball compared to the thinner ""whippier"" shafts. I play pretty strong, and I have a very powerful upper body with plenty of stroke strength (I used to be an aspiring bodybuilder long ago) but there are some cues that I try that simply don't draw the ball well. Regardless of the quality of my stroke or the strength of my shot, those cues will just not put the spin on the ball like other cues can.   A simple test can be done with your brother. Try doing the same shots with his cue and your cue side-by-side and see which cue gives you the best results. If his cue actually improves your draws, then take some time to carefully compare the two cues and possibly consult with your local cue maker to determine if your cue could be modified to be more like your brothers cue. Have the cues weighed, and have the shafts measured to see what physical differences exist between the two cues. This will give you some insight into the differences in the cues that might help you improve your draw.   One thing that seems to impact my ability to draw and put ridiculous english is the age and condition of the cueball. New and shiny cueballs seem much easier to control than old dirty cueballs with lots of dings and pits in the surface. The condition of the table cloth also plays a part in moving ol' whitey around. According to the Colorado State billiards site, ""Two physical properties describe the condition of a cloth: sliding friction (""slick"" vs. ""sticky"") and rolling resistance (""slow vs. ""fast""). A ""slick"" cloth has very little sliding friction and allows the CB to retain its spin longer. For example, it is much easier to draw the ball on a ""slick"" cloth. A ""fast"" cloth offer very little resistance to rolling, so the balls roll much farther before coming to rest."" Ambient humidity and temperature also affect the way the balls roll and grip the cloth too. Per the Colorado State billiards site (which goes along very much with my own personal experiences): With increased humidity, ""Draw shots are more difficult due to increased ""drag"" (due to the cloth playing ""stickier"" with increased sliding friction).""  If you want to improve the sheer strength of your stroke, then there are two exercises you can do to strengthen the arm and shoulder muscles which play the biggest part in your stroke strength. Pull ups will strengthen your shoulder, back, and arm muscles. Also consider dumbbell curls with some light weights to focus building strength in your biceps, forearms, wrists, and shoulders. These exercises can be done with very light weight and will still go along way to stretching out those muscles and building their strength as well.   So lots of factors can impact your draw ability other than just your technique and your stroke. Consider these other variables alongside the suggestions for improving your technique and you might discover some new ways to improve your draw shot.   ~Cheers"
billiards,3awwfx,Not2BeEftWith,3,Wed Jun 24 15:51:48 2015 UTC,There's a lot of terrible advice here.  Stop looking for issues in the equipment and practice your stroke.  Proper technique will overcome every single excuse this guy just came up with.  It doesn't matter if I'm using a beat to shit house cue with one of those slide-on ferrule/tip things or my black boar.  With the right stroke you can draw for miles regardless of the equipment.

Basically they are both compounded by the fact that I'm afraid to miscue and/or jump the ball. The moment it clicked to me that I wasn't really hitting the cue ball below center enough, I was able to get good draw distance when CB and OB are not that far away. However I was just punch stroking so the backspin doesn't last long enough for longer shots. Then I had to learn to follow through draw strokes and now I can get decent draw action in long shots. Just my two cents and I hope it helps you."
billiards,3awwfx,gotwired,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:02:19 2015 UTC,"You don't need that much power to get more draw than you are getting. Hit medium speed and make sure you are hitting low, but not as low as possible. Maximum draw for any given speed will be about 1/2 to 3/4 of the distance between center ball and the miscue limit. The more power you try to put into your stroke, the less accurate it will be and the more likely you wil hit a point other than the sweet spot."
billiards,3awwfx,petester,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:21:27 2015 UTC,"I'm still learning a lot myself.  I can pull off a pretty decent draw if I aim very low and hit fairly hard.

Dig around on there and you can find a LOT."
billiards,3awwfx,McTwizle,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:00:45 2015 UTC,Put a cue across the table from second diamond to second diamond (width wise) and shoot some draw shots.  Don't touch the cue.  Have the back of the cue as low as possible also.  The tip needs to be low obviously but so does the butt.  The stroke is soft but fast if that makes sense.  Your probably jacking up the back of the cue somewhere in the follow through and its raising the tip slightly.
billiards,3awwfx,RyanGoslingsCock,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:52:04 2015 UTC,Simple. Keep the stick as parallel to the table as possible. Keep as still as possible. Set up the shot and repeat as long as you can handle.
billiards,3awwfx,nsfyn55,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:50:00 2015 UTC,"Hit higher than you think you need to (2/3 low) and focus on follow through.  A lot of people struggling with draw are suffering from a bit of shell shock. They are striking too low on the ball. When they hit it sufficiently hard the cue ball jumps off the table. Rather than adjusting where they strike they ""poke"" at the ball resulting in stops or short draws.  The proper draw technique that results in those full table plus ""yo-yo"" draws is all about technique. Leveling your cue, imagining the cue-ball is not existent, and gliding through a consistent spot straight into the object ball.   The drill is simple. Shoot straight into the corner starting the cue ball about 12 inches from the object. When you perfect draw from 12 inches start moving the ball back(get good enough you can draw the whole table). Then work on ""spot"" draws where you draw to specific locations. And draws that include left and right english."
billiards,3awwfx,sphigel,-2,Sat Jul 4 17:02:38 2015 UTC,"Try lifting weights.  Seriously, people underestimate just how physical pool is.  Improving your upper body strength will definitely help your draw stroke.  It certainly helped mine."
billiards,3awwfx,MonsieurX,4,Wed Jun 24 04:17:08 2015 UTC,"Seriously? Please explain... It's like in golf, it's not force that makes it go further (it helps a bit), it's the speed of the cue (or club) that will impart speed. Forcing (or using force) will most likely induce an error because of stiff muscles vs flexible movement. If you hold your cue tight, you will see the problem and why a very light grip on your cue will go 3-4x further than using force."
billiards,3awwfx,sphigel,0,Wed Jun 24 11:36:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, seriously.  It helps a lot.  Obviously, striking low on the cueball and following through are more important but assuming you're already doing that then developing more strength would be the next thing to work on.    Also, I assumed we weren't talking about basic draw shots but power draw shots.  When you're on a 9 foot table and the cueball and object ball are 6 feet from each other and you need to draw the cue ball 3 feet it's a lot easier to do that when your upper body is toned.  Being in shape also helps with consistency.  It's easier to draw the cue ball consistently when you lift weights.  I know that many top pros lift weights.  SVB, Corey Deuel, Mika Immonen, Thorsten Hohmen.  They all lift weights quite a bit.  You don't realize how much it helps your pool game until you start doing it."

billiards,3awwfx,too_lazy_2_punctuate,2,Wed Jun 24 04:40:26 2015 UTC,"Let me be clear, striking low on the cue ball and following through are the most important factors.  If you're not doing that then lifting weights won't help your draw stroke.  You should be able to draw the ball easily in most instances without lifting weights.  However, if you ever play on a 9 foot table and are looking to draw the cue ball full table with object ball 7 feet away you might need to develop some strength before you can do that.  Regardless of what people in this thread say it takes strength to execute this type of power draw shot.  Some people probably have that strength naturally and can do it without lifting weights.  Others might need to develop the strength.   As far as what exercises to do, I just do the basics.  For upper body I do bench press, inclined bench, curls, deadlift, lat pull down machine, tricep lift, sit ups.

billiards,3awwfx,sphigel,3,Wed Jun 24 15:32:06 2015 UTC,This is terrible advice. I play with 80yo men in walkers and canes that can draw the length of the table. Can you hold a cue? Then you can draw.
billiards,3awwfx,EtDM,3,Wed Jun 24 12:36:22 2015 UTC,"This is terrible advice.   Really?!  Developing strength by lifting weights is terrible advice?  Gee, I wonder why most of the top pros are in excellent shape and clearly work out.  Niels Feijen, SVB, Thorsten Hohman, Corey Deuel, Mike Immonen.  These players all lift weights.  They do it for a reason."
billiards,3awwfx,too_lazy_2_punctuate,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:35:50 2015 UTC,"For as many great players you can list that are in great shape, there have been numerous champions that are out of shape, in some cases very out of shape, who can draw the living hell or if a cueball. Steve Mizerak topped 300 pounds at one point, Scott Frost isn't exactly cut, and Mike Massey, who has possibly the draw stroke of any person alive, is not especially trim. While there are many obvious reasons for trying to stay in shape, doing it to improve your draw stroke is tenuous at best."

Did I tell them modern nutrition is quackery? No, I responded that lifting weights for the purpose of gaining more control over your draw/English is totally ridiculous. You can scream all you want about top pros being in shape, but everyone knows that had nothing to do with their ability to put spin on the ball vs the fact that an in shape body can focus for longer periods of time, plus massive increases in hand eye choordination. Which is the same reason drag racers don't eat like shit either."

billiards,3at8no,thepottsy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:32:45 2015 UTC,U can search azbilliards forums and see if there are any reviews for your area there otherwise stores that specialize in pool supplies are few and far between. Some pool halls also sell supplies but i usually find them to be overpriced. Online is really the best bet when you want bang for the buck.

billiards,3at8no,Pip_Pip,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:46:36 2015 UTC,"I think the best way is to find the local pool haunt and ask around.  Usually resellers can sell things for just as cheap as online.  If you need to shave as many bucks as you can most of them will even have slightly used stuff you can get for a bargain.  You can save a few bucks online, but nothing beats being able to try it out first.  Also supporting your local pool community is really important during these dying days of pool."

Sites like ozonebilliards.com, seyberts.com, pooldawg.com offer just about everything you could possibly want, with cheap fast shipping, instead of needing to drive several hours for a much more limited selection.  Not as fun as browsing an actual pool store, but they're few and far between and they cannot compete with the online retailers in price."

Now unless you were playing last pocket 8 ball, you win due to his foul on the 8. In last pocket you would spot the 8 and get ball in hand behind the line.  Super double edit: it's still a loss in last pocket. Your allowed to scratch but not if the 8 ball is made. I don't play much 8 ball so I'm always a bit fuzzy on the exact rules. This is an excerpt from the bca handbook circa 1980s:  http://web.archive.org/web/20040812200422/http://www.sfbilliards.com/lastpocket8s.gif  Of course there are variations to every game and if you want to nitpick you can do so endlessly.

Some will play with a foul on the 8 being a loss, so you're not always right with your above statement.  Some will also throw in extra rules, like 1 and 15 must go in side-pockets, and they must be different side pockets (so whoever makes theirs first dictates where the other person must make theirs).  Then some idiots will try to play LP8 with their other shitty bar rules like ""you only get ball-in-hand in the kitchen"" or ""you have to call every little kiss and carom off of other balls or rails""."

I'll just shoot with whatever and not worry about some one doing something stupid. Don't worry about the cost in that regard. You are allowed to have nice things. More than likely cue nerds will want to look at it. I like playing with sneaky Pete stripped down cues personal, but I used to work in a wood shop and like checking other peoples out.

billiards,3af737,petester,6,Fri Jun 19 17:11:59 2015 UTC,"Generally the cue ball and object balls should be the same size and weight (within tenths of an ounce) if they come from the same set, UNLESS you're on a coin table. Some older/cheaper coin tables use the weight of the cue ball to trigger the ball return so it comes out the back of the table instead of the side, so the cue ball can be significantly heavier. This will affect your ability to stun/draw and makes the cue ball follow more than it should. There are special magnetic cue balls that are the same size/weight as the object balls; the only ones I know of are Aramith brand so they'll have a stylized Aramith ""S"" on it. You'll be able to feel the difference in weight just by picking them up.  So, in terms of practice it shouldn't matter, just be aware of the fact that when you play on some coin tables that the cue ball may behave differently and you will have to adjust for it."
billiards,3af737,dalgeek,5,Fri Jun 19 19:01:06 2015 UTC,"I do one drill using object balls as cue ball. I call it a stop chain where I put one object ball in the center, then do a straight in stop shot. Then the ball left there is the new object ball. It's good for keeping the stroke in line.  The other bonus is if you don't have a measle cue ball, using an object ball will let you see if you are accidentally miscueing and adding unintended spin. As opposed to just 'feeling' a miscue. I find being able to see the spin invaluable to learning/adjusting etc"
billiards,3af737,mattdebrown,2,Fri Jun 19 19:26:23 2015 UTC,"That's a really nice drill, I might try that."
billiards,3af737,CursedLlama,2,Sat Jun 20 04:25:29 2015 UTC,I don't think that it's any heavier. You could try using both methods.
billiards,3af737,Boomkin1337,2,Fri Jun 19 17:47:46 2015 UTC,"Since no1 else has answered this I will try. But I may not be 100% correct.   In short it depends. At most pool halls and house tables it is my understanding that they are basically the same. It comes down to how the balls are returned and I don't know the technical terms. But if they are all returned to one side of the table (including cue ball) or they rest in the pockets for you to pull out then they are the same. There are some aftermarket cue balls like the measles ball which may have a slightly different composition than the object balls but is the same size.   At bars, depending on the tables, I have encountered both magnetized cue balls which are the same size and the slightly larger cb. This must be done so the table can differentiate object balls from the cb."
billiards,3af737,S0cr8t3s,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:57:59 2015 UTC,Off topic but have you ever played the game where you shoot the object balls into the cue ball and carom into a pocket to score ?  Its kind of fun and really gets your carom game going.

billiards,3af737,Not2BeEftWith,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:05:31 2015 UTC,"Look for a dot or a small circle on the cue ball.  Generally a red dot is heavier, blue dot is lighter, and blue circle is same weight."

billiards,3aesx7,agentgreg,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:34:13 2015 UTC,"That are pretty good results!  It also shows that your overall speed control and positioning skills is really good! - I don't exactly know where your problems were with the Draw-Shot to split but I'm sure you'll noticed on what you can work there.  I would guess from your other results, that splitting the balls directly was not the issue, but getting position on the 7 afterwards ... so here some tipps, in case I'm right, as said, it's hard to judge ...  There are basically two ways (that work great for me) you can accomplish more points on T1-P3 1) use the short-rail first: Go into the short rail, then hit the 9, this should result in a good position to make the 7 2) draw to the long rail to hit the 8: This is a bit more complicated, you need a lot of action on the cue-ball with just medium speed.  Thank you so much for participating. I'll promise I'll do better with the video next week. I ordered a light of off amazon so hopefully the light-level for the video from my basement will get better (or at least to a viewable state)."

billiards,3aesx7,warmcereal,0,Sun Jun 28 02:19:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure this is a good thing for beginners to start with. Drills don't help like most people think. If anything they hurt beginners by teaching more advanced techniques than they are ready for. If you are going to do this, I'd suggest drills that teach fundamentals first. For example, finding the aiming line; understanding the principles of the stroke; basics of follow, draw, and center ball. How drift and push work when playing position. These are the concepts that beginning players should work on first. Once these are understood and perfected, then players are able to see these more advanced drills and understand how to implement them in their game. That's my soapbox suggestion."
billiards,3aesx7,corellianspiceaddict,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:23:20 2015 UTC,"a lot of replies to the first thread as well as PMs showed that most ppl actually dislike playing drills, so I've gone for a drill where you can see that this actually happens in games and you profit from learning it. In the current drill, you learn the tangent line when playing a stun/stop-shot and you learn how to influence this line by changing where you aim at the cue-ball. I think this is a good drill for beginners, even tho they won't reach high points ... every drill is not aimed for getting it 100% right the first time ... would be a bad drill if it would be the case ... in billards like with most stuff in life, you learn from mistakes ... so in this drill example, you've not managed to get position so you can start analyze what the problem was ... did the cueball travel the tangent line but bounced of off the rail to hard? - lower speed ... hit the 10? - cueball didn't travel the tangent line, so maybe aim a bit lower so you play the stun-shot."
billiards,3aesx7,corelianspiceaddict,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:01:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm wrong but I think spice addict was suggesting rather than this being the first drill, there are other drills that lead up into this... General follow, draw, positioning drills that would help complete this drill.  We have a wide range of skill levels here it seems so no matter how you do it, it's going to be too easy at some points and too hard at others, and for some people right in the middle.   Looking forward to the rest of the video and I'll be giving you my scores this weekend!"
billiards,3aesx7,warmcereal,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:15:15 2015 UTC,"yea I need to collect some feedback, if you guys think, the drill is to hard, I'll lower the difficulty and make another post. It's hard for me to guess the average skill level ... I read a lot about ppl beeing 4 or 5s in APA ... but since we don't have this system here in europe I've pretty much no idea what that means :("
billiards,3aesx7,corellianspiceaddict,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:31:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think the drill is too hard. I think anyone who has been playing for a few months should be already practicing this if they want to get better. I say go as you are going and like you said, the prize isn't based on scoring but participation.  APA rankings range from 2-7, so your 4s and 5s are average players, can run a table, but probably don't do it often."
billiards,3aesx7,ricky_clarkson,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:38:40 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I mean.

billiards,3afjjr,mattdebrown,3,Fri Jun 19 18:46:25 2015 UTC,"Top Gun scoring has changed in recent years. It used to be that you got as many points as the skill level you beat, but that was unfair because 7s tend to play 7s and 3s tend to play 3s. If someone changed tiers in the middle of the session (say 2-3 to 4-5 tier), they would have significantly fewer points than everyone else in the tier. This happened to me and I went from 1st place to 14th place.  Now Top Gun is based on percentage of points available. In an 8-ball match, you can earn up to 3 points. If you get all 3 points then you get 100%, 2 points = 66.67%, 1 point = 33.33%. It works the same way in 9-ball, except you can earn up to 20 points in a match. This way the points earned scales between tiers and no one gets screwed if they go up in skill level and get bumped to another tier. I believe in the case of a tie it comes down to the player with the most matches and there is probably a minimum match requirement. We had one guy in my league play a single match and get 100%, but my teammate who played 12 matches got 96%, so that guy was disqualified from Top Gun."
billiards,3afjjr,dalgeek,2,Fri Jun 19 19:07:27 2015 UTC,"Before the new point system, ours just went by record, and minimum matches played was 8, in a 16 week session. Sucks that many times I got runner up I was like 12-1 and lost to someone who went 8-0 then sat the rest of the session.  The new top gun scoring really caters to 3s and 4s in my opinion. Much easier for a good 3 to average more than 2 pts over 8+ matches in a session."
billiards,3afjjr,warmcereal,2,Sun Jun 21 18:17:01 2015 UTC,"Yep there's a minimum match requirement. You have to play a certain amount of matches to qualify. I think at least half but I'm not sure.  E: Here it is from the APA website itself.   Top Gun is calculated by the number of points earned divided by the number of points available (PA). Example in 8-Ball: In every 8-Ball match, you have 3 points available to win. If you play 10 matches, you have 30 points available to win (3x10). If you win a total of 13 points in those 10 matches then the calculation is: 13 / 30 = 0.43 or 43% This means that you won 43% of the points available (PA) to you during the session. Example in 9-Ball: In every 9-Ball match, you have 20 points available to win. If you play 10 matches, you have 200 points available to win (20x10). If you win a total of 162 points in those 10 matches then the calculation is: 162 / 200 = 0.81 or 81% This means that you won 81% of the points available (PA) to you during the session. NOTE: You must play at least half the regular Session in order to qualify for the Top Gun Award or entry into the Top Gun Tournament. The regular session does not include Playoffs or TriCups. The top 5 players in each Skill Level Tier will be invited to the Top Gun Tournament. Ties will be broken in the following order: Total number of matches played, win percentage, performance points, lifetime win percentage."
billiards,3afjjr,HandShoes,2,Fri Jun 19 19:59:39 2015 UTC,Here's the official document handed down from my local APA league.  No extra credit for beating stronger players and 3 players from every skill level will qualify for Top Gun.  This seems like a simpler explanation of what /u/dalgeek said earlier and goes into a bit more detail on all of the tiebreakers.
billiards,3afjjr,elint,2,Fri Jun 19 20:13:42 2015 UTC,"The Top Gun rules seem to be determined locally. I'm not sure if there is national guidance or not, but I know that my league (in Seattle) still awards top gun points based on the SL of the player you beat. From the King County APA site: ""A player's Top Gun Points are the sum total of the skill levels of all the players they have defeated during the course of a session (before playoffs). There are three skill level tiers in each division: Low, Mid and High. The player(s) in 1st Place of their division's tier are invited to this tournament each session (in the case of ties, all tied players are invited). This means that a minimum of 3 players from each division are invited to the tournament."""
billiards,3afjjr,RumGor,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:11:33 2015 UTC,"The single best thing you can do to get top gun, is stop worrying about it and just win. Don't try to game the system or match up with certain specific people (especially if the matchup might not be ideal for your team).  It's ultimately about your win rate, so just win. Win every rack you can. Win every match you can. The handicapping system is decently fair, so don't worry about the opponent's skill level number.   If you're getting beat to death and you're gonna lose, score as many points as you can by making balls in 9-ball, or trying to steal one more game in 8-ball.   I've gotten it a couple of times and I did absolutely nothing special or different. I just played normally, and went against whoever my captain told me to play, and tried to win every single rack of every single match."
billiards,3afjjr,CreeDorofl,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:38:48 2015 UTC,If you beat a 5 you get 5 points. If you beat a 7 you get 7 points and so on. If you play more matches you can get more points. My league also seems to let in the highest winning percentage players too.

billiards,3ac0m4,barrettathome,2,Thu Jun 18 21:40:36 2015 UTC,What's different between this and goplaypool.com
billiards,3ac0m4,outside_english,2,Fri Jun 19 02:02:33 2015 UTC,"No offense but goplaypool's website is horrible and it is not responsive meaning that it does not display properly on mobile devices.  They do have a mobile app but I will also be putting a mobile app on the market within the next few weeks.  Also there website directory does not have a map and there directory entries only have a phone number associated with them.  I have it to where an establishment can change there header image, they can be contacted with a form through the website, shows there location on a map, they can add a description and i'm currently fixing to where they can add other entertainment, social links and number of tables.  I'll be adding a lot more functionality to my site within the next couple of weeks as well."
billiards,3ac0m4,outside_english,2,Fri Jun 19 03:21:47 2015 UTC,"I also forgot to mention that they can add a featured video, gallery and users can rate there establishment and comment on it."

billiards,3ac0m4,elint,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:30:37 2015 UTC,"I'm at work so I didnt have too much time to look into the exact details but I would recommend including the ability to rate the player environment there. So depending on if it is inhabited by casual players, aggressive players, gamblers, league guys, thugs, etc. Also, allow people to list table time prices and specials for sure."
billiards,3ac0m4,petester,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:48:44 2015 UTC,"We just had a little hickup with the site but we did have list of tables.  I have to work on it tonight re-integrate it.  As of right now they can rate the establishment but for the future they will be able to rate the tables, food, service and etc.  Good idea on the players!  I'll take note of that."
billiards,3ac0m4,Void23,2,Thu Jun 18 22:54:14 2015 UTC,"Might even be a good idea to be able to list yourself as a regular player at these places so for instance if someone is looking for someone to play certain places, times, or even just certain games in particular it can be easier to connect with other players. That might over complicate it but I know that can be one of the biggest struggles people have as far as finding good places to play."

billiards,3acgej,elint,2,Fri Jun 19 13:59:43 2015 UTC,"A little more about this league…  It's a brand-new in house league at a Moose Lodge just outside of Detroit. We have six teams playing a 10 week season where each team plays every other team twice.  The game we're playing is #mini8 to keep things running fast. It's played exactly like BCA #8ball but you start off with only four solids and four stripes.  Three players play per team per night and everyone plays six games each. All of the players get a chance to ""serve"" which means they get to break three games in a row, one each against of the opposing team members. They also get three more games spread throughout the night when the other team is breaking. So you get the best of both worlds where you have a short ""set"" of three but your night doesn't just end there.  We run the whole thing on a website I made called NomadPool.com. All of the scoring is done live by the teams themselves. This way the stats are live and the LO doesn't have any data entry to worry about.zz x"
billiards,3acgej,tearsofsadness,2,Fri Jun 19 13:36:59 2015 UTC,"Wow, neat league and a hell of a website you've built there.  I like what you've done with the stats and posting game video, etc.  The game seems ridiculous.  I think C players would run a lot of racks in that format.  I also don't like how Freddy breaks off of a piece of cloth and leave it on the table to interfere with the cue ball path (you can see the cue bounce off the cloth at 0:46)."
billiards,3ac55x,too_late_to_party,9,Thu Jun 18 22:16:14 2015 UTC,"You don't master a cue just like a carpenter doesn't master a hammer. He learns to work in harmony with the structures and limitations of the task set forth before him, and through time and dedication learns to bring about a balanced relationship with his tools and medium. A skilled practitioner of anything is less concerned with the tools he uses than the aptitude of his hands.  Learn the game, learn the angles, learn the techniques. Whether you do that on a $500 cue or a $10 house beater is up to you.   If you want some pointers, this is the place to ask. Most of the people here love this game like a family member and anybody else with that passion is immediately a friend.   Schons are beautiful. Take care of it, buy a case if you don't have one, don't break with it, and find a tip that suits your playstyle. If you have questions about any of those things, ask away. We have at least one cuesmith and a litany of very skilled and experienced players in this subreddit who enjoy above all else when somebody new and hungry steps up to the table.   If you feel like you've got some really noobish questions (""Which end should I chalk?"") that you don't want to ask publicly, feel free to drop me a line.  Congrats on a beautiful piece of equipment, man. I hope it brings you closer to the game."

billiards,3ac55x,dirtyduo,2,Fri Jun 19 01:18:47 2015 UTC,You can break with a schon if it's the original shaft. Ive been breaking with mine for 4 years and no bend. Just don't do it with an ob shaft
billiards,3ac55x,jlbartle,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:53:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that made me feel better. I guess I've just been feeling really frustrated recently while playing, as I just can't seem to get used to the deflection and can't control using English. It feels like I'm getting nowhere and the drop in my confidence makes me miss some easy shots too.   I've been thinking if I should get an OB shaft to use with my schon, or save the money and keep on trying with what I have now. I love the feel of my schon, I just can't seem to get the cue ball and object ball to where I want them to go..."
billiards,3ac55x,TheOneCalledAtlas,3,Fri Jun 19 02:45:36 2015 UTC,"Don't get discouraged. I've been playing since I was 14 years old and I'm now.. well I'm a ways from 14. I still get the yips. I still shank shots. I still have off nights and off weekends and off weeks. Everybody does.  Your best friend is going to be fundamentals. From there, it's the same as driving on ice, man. Tiny adjustments. The only thing that english will get you is position. It won't help you make (most) shots.  Lower the stakes. Find yourself some pocket tables or cheap coin ops and play alone. Practice shooting natural, no english, no draw, no follow. Dead center. Step one is to check your ASS (Angle, stance, speed), once you get that nailed down, start lagging. Spot your cue ball, line your cue along the center diamond, and practice lagging until that cue ball is returning to the tip of your stick.   From there, you know your ass is unfucked, and that's the first hurdle. Now set up some balls and drop them without a speck of english. Do that until your arms get tired, then go home.  When you can do that consistently for awhile, start working on your leaves (Where english will actually come in handy). If you're practicing english before you can make natural shots or lag with consistency, you're putting the carriage in front of the horse.  Every victory starts with a battle, every battle starts with a soldier, and every soldier used to shit his diapers at one point. There is no shame in being a beginner, and nobody worth a shit will look down on you for practicing to improve.   Shoulders back, eyes on the horizon, brother. Don't lose sight of the fact that this is something to have fun with. The moment you quit having fun is the moment you stop improving.  Edit: Don't buy an OB yet, and here's why: You haven't dialed in your shots yet. A full maple shaft may cause more deflection than an OB, but it's also going to be more forgiving. An OB comes with a factory diameter of 11.75mm, which with even the tiniest hint of english is going to have a fucking profound effect compared to a 13mm. Save your money for now. When you get comfortable controlling your shots, then upgrade."
billiards,3ac55x,petester,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:09:23 2015 UTC,"Every time I try the thing where I lag the cue ball to the tip of my cue, it comes back at an angle to the right.  It hits the rail 6 inches or so to the right every time on an 8 foot table even though I'm trying as hard as I can to shoot dead center.  Do I just aim more left, or should I find somebody that knows what they're doing to help out?"
billiards,3ac55x,TheOneCalledAtlas,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:24:07 2015 UTC,"That means you need to fix your angle. If you're hitting true and getting return to the right, it means you're angled slightly left. Try adjusting your body once you know your cue is squared."
billiards,3ac55x,S0cr8t3s,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:01:47 2015 UTC,"I am by no means a good pool player but I win a decent amount of games by playing as simple as possible. English is complicated because the degree to which it causes deflection/squirt is directly related to how hard you hit the cue ball. Thus you must learn to play with pocket speed.   I think this is what I, and many other players spend a great deal of time adjusting and calibrating to. Hitting the ball hard causes very different squirt and throw than hitting it softly. Until you have mastered English, use it sparingly."
billiards,3ac55x,CreeDorofl,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:20:35 2015 UTC,"This is something that occasionally causes arguments, but you absolutely should get an OB shaft, or a predator shaft. I wish I'd done it earlier. If it matters, this is coming from a SL7 in 8b and SL9 in 9b... though you can certainly find better players than me, including plenty of pros, using standard shafts.   But trust me, you're needlessly handicapping yourself by forcing yourself to deal with extra deflection.   Every year you spend learning lines of aim on a high deflection shaft, is more time you will need to spend UNlearning those lines of aim, when you finally make the switch. There's no need to keep memorizing bad lines of aim that you're eventually gonna throw away anyway. It will just make the transition more painful.  To be honest, at SL4, you may be overrating the effect of deflection in your shots and it could be you're just missing due to not having enough experience with certain shots, or fundamentals that aren't 100% solid yet. But by SL6 you will certainly come to appreciate the difference.  As for the suggestion that this will somehow make it more difficult to learn, or that the shaft is less forgiving, that's flat out wrong. Even if the smaller tip diameter means you might accidentally put more sidespin on a ball than intended (which is a side effect of having learned on a high deflection shaft)... less deflection means a less severe penalty for small accidental errors in sidespin. The LD shaft is more forgiving and will shorten your learning curve using sidespin.   Keep the schon butt, I'm sure it's pretty and a fine cue. Get a better shaft. And resist any urge to switch back and forth between shafts, that's the surest way to ruin your game. You will miss more often while you learn to adjust to the new shaft... accept it and stick with the shaft, don't jump right back to the old shaft just because you missed a ball or two.   edit: this link will dispel some myths about LD shafts - http://billiards.colostate.edu/threads/cue.html#low_squirt"

It explains a lot and has stuff for beginers all the way to tour pros. 99 Crtical Shots in Pool is also another great book. Like others have said it's probably not the cue it's more the mechanics. I've been playing 20+ years and still find flaws. Don't expect to get good overnight it's a game that can take thousands of hours to get proficient at.

The webbiing on them still looks intact and that's the main failure point on them. I hate this style pocket because it never fails to get your fingers caught in them.  This is almost surely an 8ft table for the home. It's the bastard size because it's rarely used in tourneys. Mostly just for home rec play. I agree with the pricing although they move and recover (you want to do them together) will probably run more than $200-300 which is what makes tables like these pretty common on CL and ebay.
billiards,3a8x8l,fadedcheese,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:37:16 2015 UTC,"when someone is buying a table, they prefer not to be told that ""oh those are fine"". Typically people willing to pay more than 400 for a table want it to look good. those pockets do not look good."
billiards,3a8x8l,wordysanchez,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:57:36 2015 UTC,It's a used table.Yeah the pockets are a bit worn but they are far from needing to be replaced They just need to be reattached in some places. I've sold and installed tables. Sure your can put new ones on. You can replace the felt every month too but both are a waste of money because they aren't worn enough to justify it. If the webbing was held together with zip ties or other parts are torn then maybe replace. From the looks of these they don't need it. It'd make more sense to use that money to replace the rubber or fix the Olhousen pocket cut issue than replace the pockets. The money is better spent on things that effect playability rather than cosmetic stuff.
billiards,3a8x8l,fadedcheese,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:01:02 2015 UTC,"Is this what you are measuring when you say ""around 4 feet by 7.25 feet""?  If so, I'm guessing it's 44""x88"", which is considered a standard 8' table.  If it's otherwise in good condition, you may be able to get $600 back for it.  If you were measuring the outside dimensions, you may have a 7' or 6' table and might get a bit less."
billiards,3a8x8l,elint,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:50:07 2015 UTC,"If you need it out now, you will have to give it away to anybody willing to take it. If you can afford to wait for a buyer, you can put it on craigslist for 400obo, but be prepared to wait a long time and have a lot of tire kickers come over to look at it. If you do find a buyer, be prepared to accept 300, maybe less."
billiards,3a8x8l,gotwired,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:29:54 2015 UTC,"The market in your area will greatly impact how quickly you can sell and for how much. Check Craigslist to see saturation of the market to estimate how fast and for how much it can sell. You can get between $400 - $700, depending on your market. Other ideas: post to social media, contact a local billiards dealer to see if they buy tables, ask around to neighbors and friends, and reach out to coworkers."
billiards,3a6w26,scratchinmadman,3,Wed Jun 17 18:20:47 2015 UTC,"If its a soft tip then breaking with it will cause damage to the tip (mushrooming). If you have a Low Deflection shaft (composite shaft) then breaking with it could possibly cause the shaft to split if you are hitting really hard.   If none of those are true, then breaking with your cue isn't going to be a bad thing for most. I feel personally the avg player doesn't hit nearly half as hard as what pros are capable of so the risk is sometimes overstated. You do still risk damage to the tip, but damage to the cue itself is unlikely. I personally feel like the better the cue the more you should break with it."
billiards,3a6w26,Pilfered,2,Wed Jun 17 18:40:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/Pilfered on these points. A Joss cue is generally plenty strong enough to endure being used for most breaking needs. About the only issue you will likely have is seeing your LePro tip mushroom and flatten out a bit faster than if you didn't break with it. I wouldn't be concerned about damaging the rest of the cue, though."
billiards,3a6w26,gabrielleigh,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:46:26 2015 UTC,How soft are the LePro tips relatively speaking?
billiards,3a6w26,elint,2,Wed Jun 17 19:26:10 2015 UTC,"LePro tips are generally in the medium-hard range, so they're pretty hard: tip hardness chart"
billiards,3a6w26,gabrielleigh,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:23:40 2015 UTC,"They range from medium-soft, to medium, to medium-hard depending on the batch of leather they are punched from. LePro has some pretty ""lax"" quality control and consistency standards from what I have seen. I probably have to flat out discard about 5% of the tips that come in each box due to flaws in the natural growth of the leather. Some batches hit a bit soft, some hit a bit hard, and there are even variations within the same box of tips from time to time."
billiards,3a6w26,spectacular_coitus,3,Wed Jun 17 20:30:03 2015 UTC,"In addition to mushrooming the tip, you'll also harden it by compressing the layers.  I use my playing cue to break with all the time, but I hit a second ball 8 ball break and usually at about 80% of max speed. For 9 ball I just grab a bar cue and hit the damn thing like it owes me money."

The truth is, I've been playing pool for about 15 years now and I've only played for money like, 10 times. And none of those were ""hustling.""  It's all offense.   There is a huge percentage of the population out there that literally doesn't realize that position play exists. They think it's just about shooting the ball in the pocket and they have no idea you're controlling the cue ball as well.  I remember trying to show a girl what position play was. I set up a few examples, I had to explain and shoot them a couple times before she understood. When she finally realized that I was controlling the cue ball her eyes got HUGE and her mind was blown. sigh  ""Dirty Pool""   For the people that do realize that position play exists, many of them think that playing defense is cheating or ""playing dirty.""

My work as a cuesmith involves mostly common sense observations paired with logical and sensible responses to these observations. The kind of stuff you could quite simply describe to any random person on the street and they would likely choose a good solution to the problem just based on common sense. So much of my work is subjective and based on personal preferences. I feel a lot less like a specialized craftsman of an obscure art and more like a chef or a tailor or anyone else who has to listen and observe a client and make logical choices about how to proceed with a project.   Unfortunately, I meet a lot of people who are enthralled with what they think they know about my type of work but when they finally get the chance to hang out in the shop and see what goes into the project they are often disappointed and let down by how simple and sensible things really are.

billiards,3a0hw8,WolfJackson,2,Wed Jun 17 05:35:27 2015 UTC,"That a specific cue sport game (pocket billiards, snooker, carom billiards, etc) takes more ""skill"" to play than another, and that a player who is very skillful in one would easily dominate the so-called ""lesser"" cue sport.   I also hate this line of thinking when trying to cross compare other games and sports, as well. Sure, some games might be easier to learn than others, but every game, from cue sports to ball sports, sets its own standards of excellence.   For example, a pool player who only plays on 9 foot tables might talk down bar box pool as being ""easy"" and less skillful (much like a snooker snob talks down pool). Sure, it's easier to pocket balls on a bar table than a 9 foot, but the ""standard of excellence"" in bar table pool is running multiple racks at a much greater frequency than running multiple racks on a larger table. A bar table specialist will beat a 9 foot specialist over the long haul every time, despite the latter being more experienced on the more ""difficult"" equipment.  Same analogy applies to pool-snooker. The ultimate standard of excellence in snooker (for a single frame) is the 147, of course. So the logic goes: It's so much easier to break and run a rack of 9/8 ball than achieve a 147, therefore snooker is harder/takes more skill.   But pool, especially 8/9 ball, has more variance, and nothing can be determined in a single game or even a single race to 7/9/11 set. A B+/A player could get hot and catch a world champ on a bad day and steal a short set from him (I say this to counter the claim by snooker snobs who cite Steve Davis, Ronnie, being able to ""compete"" in pro pool tournaments as ""proof"" of how a top snooker pro can match up with a top pool player easily due to playing the ""harder"" game their whole careers). Anything can happen in a single set and it doesn't really tell us much.  So that considered, the ""standard of excellence"" for 9/8 ball would be running out the set or, at very least, a 5 or 6 pack. This is also why 9/8 ball are poor tournament games for pool fans (but great for TV), and why all the cool stuff happens in challenge/gambling matches that go multiple sets, like Archer running 13 straight racks against Busta. Or McCready running 6 packs like no tomorrow in his heyday.  And those feats are just as rare and impressive and take just as much ""skill"" as 147s."

If you have to get it out in a week you going to get hosed.  Quickly $600.

Free professional install makes the process less overwhelming for someone that is interested.    The move is also a bargaining chip.

Furniture tables are a harder sell at higher prices. Cloth means nothing usually unless its a brand new high end cloth. Accessories account for about 50$ of the selling price.    All that being said, you will be lucky to get $1500 for that table in the summer. It would likely sell for $1250. In the winter, post it for $1600 firm with the intent to sell for 1500.

The seller included 4 spectator chairs, 8 cheap cues, floor cue stand, shitty wood rack, and a set of balls.   I felt like it was a fair price for a furniture table.  Vitalie tables > all other furniture tables IMO.  I personally wouldn't have paid more than $1000 for a furniture-style table from any other manufacturer.

billiards,39yluq,dirtyduo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:41:49 2015 UTC,Yes. Deflection = squirt. /u/dirtyduo is pointing out that the shot requires getting the cue ball to impact the rail as close to the object ball as possible without hitting it first. This in turn requires compensating for deflection. If you have a low deflection shaft and the shot is relatively close then it's pretty easy.

billiards,39yluq,elint,7,Mon Jun 15 21:13:23 2015 UTC,"This works because the rail is not a perfectly rigid solid.  It compresses when the cue ball hits it, and for a brief moment, the cue ball has time to grip the rail with that spin and get thrown towards the object ball.  For these shots, I basically aim to hit the rail and object ball at the same time, but the inside english puts a bit of squirt on the ball, sending it slightly away from the object ball.  It's an extremely common shot.  Congratulations, you're one of today's 10,000!"

billiards,39yluq,Appetite_TDE,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:25:30 2015 UTC,"Right English makes it so when the cue ball hits the rail close to the frozen ball, the spin will put it in place as if you were aiming at the object ball and rail."
billiards,39yluq,Pilfered,2,Mon Jun 15 21:25:46 2015 UTC,I use this shot pretty frequently.  You can essentially cut past the 90° threshold with it and it really sets your opponent back in their seat when you pull it out.    The downsides are that it opens up a scratch in the corner and it can be pretty finicky if you aren't familiar with how the ball is going to bend into the cut.
billiards,39yluq,dickskittles,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:47:18 2015 UTC,"I don't get what you mean by past 90°? If the cue were parallel or below the OB this shot isn't going to work, and unless you're playing one pocket, it'd be a bad shot even if you did make it."
billiards,39yluq,Pilfered,2,Tue Jun 16 12:12:35 2015 UTC,"Not true.  It can be made with the CB parallel or below the OB, depending on how grippy the cloth on the cushion is.  You're right that in such an extreme case it's not usually the wisest choice of shots, but I like my wisdom in moderation."
billiards,39yluq,dickskittles,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:30:39 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't you call that a half masse into a kick? Which is possible, but as you said maybe not super wise."
billiards,39yluq,Pilfered,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:32:32 2015 UTC,"It's not a half-masse if you do it with a reasonably level cue.  It is a kick shot, but it's a kick shot that looks a lot like a cut shot since it hits the rail only barely before the OB.  And the cut shot it looks like can be a greater-than-90-degree cut."
billiards,39yluq,sphigel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:37:49 2015 UTC,"We're talking about the same thing yeah? I'm saying if the CB is below the OB and you're cutting/kicking back, not up the table...for this to work you'd need at least a diamond and half of space to even get the angle to hit the rail in front of the OB to have it spin back into the OB. My whole point is that if you're shooting such an extreme shot you had better be really great with it or have a better reason."
billiards,39yluq,dickskittles,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:57:42 2015 UTC,You're right that a cut shot cannot be cut greater than 90 degrees.  This isn't a cut shot though.  It's a kick shot as you hit the rail first and spin ball in.  Using this method you can successfully pocket balls well past a 90 degree cut.
billiards,39yluq,uunngghh,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:15:07 2015 UTC,"With maximum side spin you can cut a ball up to about 93 degrees, depending on how dirty the balls are.  You hit a contact point that would naturally produce a nearly-90-degree cut, and throw from the side spin can push it past 90."
billiards,39yluq,JonLivestrong,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:39:43 2015 UTC,I typically use bottom and near English for these shots.  It is pretty common and will impress people when they see you walk a ball frozen against the rail with a hard cut into the pocket.

A cut shot, like you linked to, is a completely different shot than a rail first kick shot which is the shot being discussed.  Not trolling, just stating that they are two clearly different shots.  There are many beginners in this subreddit who might be confused why you're equating an inside english cut shot with an inside english rail first kick shot.  In one shot the english is required to actually pocket the ball and in the other shot the english is simply for position play.    Edit:  Also, you can shoot a rail first kick shot with inside english even when the object ball is not frozen to the rail.  That's not what Efren did however.  He obviously hit ball first.

Arguments could be made that it's the ""official"" cue of the subreddit (but not reddit as a whole) if the mods want to go on a power-trip and say they speak for the entire subreddit.  That would be up to /u/pip_pip and the other mods, though :)"

billiards,39uj5x,I_was_the_Gooch,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:06:15 2015 UTC,"THC has never helped my game.  Alcohol has a calming effect for about 2 beers. After that it's effects turn negative.  Beta blockers are like alcohol. They just have a calming effect by lowering your blood pressure.  The best thing I've ever tried was bromantane/ladasten It's an odd over the counter drug from Russia that has both a mild stimulant effect and also anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) properties. Of course it's illegal to play under the effects of and on the WPA banned substances list. Legally you can import it for personal use.  Pool is such a mental game once you understand the mechanics. What works for one person might not help another. There's plenty of substances that can adjust your mood, your focus, etc. Until you've identified what's causing your game to be off, trying to fix your game with chemicals is a waste of time.   Some days I lack confidence and my stroke is off. Other days I'm over confident and my stroke is off. In the first scenario I'll over think my shots and second guess my angles and weight. In the second scenario, I'm under thinking everything and expecting balls to drop even though I'm cutting corners in my routine. Two entirely different sets of mistakes that are both caused by the same emotion at different levels. Each problem requires a different fix and the fix for one could just exacerbate the other problem if you haven't correctly identified the cause of it.  Knowing yourself and being able to remain calm and focused under a variety of different conditions is the key and there's no ""one"" drug that can provide that for everybody."

billiards,39uj5x,gotwired,0,Mon Jun 15 00:31:35 2015 UTC,I would imagine amphetamines could be used to increase focus and anti-anxiety drugs can be used such as non selective beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol) can be used.  I've met musicians in the pharmacy who've told me they use beta-blockers for performance anxiety when I mistakenly assumed they were using them for blood pressure.
billiards,39uj5x,SirNoobs,0,Mon Jun 15 01:13:27 2015 UTC,"The opiates are pretty big with players. Adderall is also a pretty popular one and I think that the increased focus does give players a bit of an advantage. Then you have alcohol and THC which are more part of the culture. Pros seem to either be in the camp that they wait till after the tourney to get their drink on or that it's almost necessary for them to play their game. ""Beer Gear"" is a term used a lot for this."

billiards,39u85v,megapantsparty,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:04:53 2015 UTC,"Poor guy.  Sorry to hear that :(  For a counter-argument, I love both BCA and APA.  APA is pretty nice in my area and the handicap system really lets players of all skill levels compete on a semi-level playing field (a 7 is still most likely going to beat a 2).  As long as you have a well-rounded team with a variety of skill levels, you've got a good shot.  APA's handicap system is very influential in the outcome each night and so it doesn't favor the team with the highest ranks -- it favors the team with the most players that are improving (i.e. a 3 getting better and working towards becoming a 4).  BCA tends to be less handicap-bound, and the teams with better players often come out on top.  A team with high handicap players will often beat a team with lower handicap players, even if the first team is generally trending down in handicap.  This favors better players over ""improving players"".  We actually have a couple of BCA leagues nearby, and one isn't handicapped at all, so the most-stacked team often does the best.  That being said, both leagues have their places, and I'm sorry one of your leagues didn't work out for you, OP.  It's sad that I see people shitting on one league or another at the end of almost every session (BCA, APA, NAPA, TAP, VNEA, etc) if they get close and don't make it all the way to the next level.  You probably just have a shitty APA league in your area or maybe it's just shitty in your particular division.  My town has great BCA, APA, and NAPA leagues.  We've never had a VNEA league (no Valley bars in town) and TAP was short-lived because of issues with the local franchise.  I don't use that experience to shit on TAP as a league in general, though -- they may be great elsewhere :)  tldr; I disagree with OP on ""BCA is the way to go if you have the option"".  Any well-run league is the way to go.  Don't let OP discourage you -- if you have a chance, get out and play some pool! :)"
billiards,39u85v,elint,2,Sun Jun 14 20:55:34 2015 UTC,I'll just say we couldn't always play together as friends because our teams cap would end up as to where we would lose just showing up. I guess I should of said I prefer the less handicap affected games of BCA
billiards,39u85v,elint,-1,Sun Jun 14 21:01:45 2015 UTC,"Aah, yes, that can tend to happen if you're all on the stronger end of the handicap scale.

Yet while jumping with either jump butt length, the shaft with a 14mm tip leaves little to no response. It will jump but it jumps hard."
billiards,39rtuj,robodonkee,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:41:29 2015 UTC,"I have a JB6. It's a great break cue and with about 15 minutes of good coaching I could do moderately difficult jumps and even make the ball a few times! Jumping is 90% technique, so if you can't jump well it's unlikely that you cue is the problem."

I guess if I'm being honest with myself I'd say, I wish I had bought a dedicated break stick,  then a jumper when I had the money. I'm not sure if it's true for all hybrid sticks, but mine does neither well. It is mediocre in nearly every way."

billiards,39o1s1,SeabrookMiglla,0,Wed Jun 17 04:17:20 2015 UTC,"Same here. I have Tuesday/Wednesdays off, and I wouldn't mind dropping by. I'm mainly curious as to whether they'll be renting out the other tables during the event, or if they're blocked off and/or charging a premium for table time.   I can probably count on both my hands how many times I've picked up my cue since I moved down here a year and a half ago since I live in the NW Valley and the closest pool hall is Good Timez and it's still a bit of a drive. I'm by no means a savant, (around a 3-4 by APA standards) but the idea of being in a pool hall, even during a great event, and not being able to knock a few balls around would probably make me feel just a teensy bit antsy.  Also, do they serve beer/wine/etc.? I know that when I checked the place out back in November when my girlfriend visited they did not. It's certainly not a dealbreaker, as when we went we had a great time at the table as well as watching a couple old timers playing golf along with a really awesome player practicing drills on the table across from us. All in all, a fantastic experience, but it does feel odd being in a pool hall without a pint in my hand, even if I'm not shooting.  Either way, I'm not trying to sound like a snob or a hipster or anything, I'm mainly just asking if it's worthwhile to bring my cue along. I'd still love to see some greats battle it out."

The blue tables have a slightly lower rail that provides a more natural bank (ie the angle of incident is closer to the angle of reflection)."

billiards,39lu0h,MrV2121,0,Fri Jun 12 17:15:32 2015 UTC,Nationals will take this very seriously. They could even take the franchise away from the LO if they find out that they are involved. Make sure everything is documented; they discourage keeping your own records but it may be worth it in this case. They will have access to all of the score sheets too.
billiards,39lu0h,dalgeek,3,Fri Jun 12 17:26:41 2015 UTC,Sandbagging is inevitable in league pool because it's designed to encourage it (to keep teams together etc). In your case it seems particularly bad but there's not much you can do. The only thing you can do with such a situation in league pool is just try to enjoy the night out and not get too worked up about it.
billiards,39lu0h,endingcreds,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:27:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, until we split from this division that's what my plan is.  And this is more a gripe from my team as a unit rather than me as an individual.  I personally like to play them because I always get to play one of their 7's and a guy who is a 5 on my team somehow, someway consistently beats 7's almost every time he plays them, but will get shutout by other 5's and 6's.  It's pretty weird, but it's kinda funny.  The guy I always play was ranked as tied for 26th nationally last year.  Really, REALLY good, but I like it because I always learn a lot from him when I play him.  Not because we talk about stuff, but just from watching him closely."
billiards,39lu0h,khoker,3,Fri Jun 12 17:22:33 2015 UTC,"Your takeaway solace is that any one of those 3's will get automatically bumped in a regional or notional tournament.  And they can be bumped-up mid-game, which can result in a team being disqualified because they can no longer play all 5 players.     On the flip side, none of that matters at all because all the other teams at said tournament will also be sandbaggers, because that's how you make it that far in the first place.     TL:DR;  The APA encourages sandbagging.  If that team bothers you, you don't want to make it any further anyway."

APA executives have ways of rooting it out. i believe the regulation is if any player's skill levels moves up twice at the national tournament the team is disqualified. i've seen it happen. a few years back i was in vegas, watching the semi-finals. one of the teams that won their semi-final round did not play the final. they were disqualified. no prize money.  it will catch up to them. i feel sorry for the other teams in their division that could have played honestly and represented their league with dignity. it's a worthy rant, it makes me angry too."

billiards,39lu0h,BobPlager,0,Sat Jul 4 05:39:18 2015 UTC,To add to this the APA is a franchise. There is an operator who runs this as their business. Franchisees have rules and guidelines they have to follow and know one wants to lose money or their business.
billiards,39lu0h,smokeyforest,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:31:25 2015 UTC,"The APA is a nice way for beginners to learn the ropes and get a routine into playing seriously. But anything after that, it's not going to make you better to take it seriously unless you're in masters.  Playing a race against a 3 when you're a 4 and scoring for four hours hasn't made anybody better. Do it for social night if you want but if you want to get better, meet better players and play them or find tournaments and play in them. Otherwise you get caught giving a shit about sandbaggers."

I think you'll get pretty diminishing returns from league night and eventually you'll need to go to masters or tournaments or sets against better people to really get better.  Long story short it's not worth caring about sandbaggers, there's nothing you can do."
billiards,39lu0h,mattdebrown,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:07:41 2015 UTC,"Im on a team who gets called sandbaggers all the time. Its our teams first session. We have one guy who is a 6 and rest of us are 3s. We just want to have a good time but are getting animosity from most of the other teams. I find it very unsportsmanlike on several occasions. Week 5 we had a match against a team from another bar. I'm a 3 and they put me up against a 4. The first two games I lost but I gave the guy a hard time on the table by leaving the cue ball in difficult spots for him. I definately made him earn those games. The third game I won because I started to relax more and take time on my shots. Whoever won the last game won the match. It was difficult and lasted for 11 innings. I had gotten down to one ball and he was on the 8. I left the cue in a spot where the 8 had to be banked. He missed just barely and it was sitting perfectly in th pocket. I sunk my last ball and as I set up for the 8, right before my shot some lady from the other team yelled ""YOU'RE A DIRTY SANDBAGGER!"" I still sunk the 8 and won but that was extremely unprofessional trying to make me miss my shot by yelling at me. I just want to have a good time.

Here's what I would do, if no luck on reddit... try plugging your zip into this site - http://dc.apaleagues.com/HostLocationFinder.aspx  Find the pool room you like most nearby, and call and ask what their league nights are. Then just show up on league night and talk to the LO (league operator). That's usually the person who knows about which teams have openings.   When you search on the site linked above, they also offer a number for the sort of area manager (in this case Lee Tiani) but I suspect you'd have better luck with someone one step lower in the food chain, who deals more directly with organizing teams.

If anyone wants to replicate a lot of this type of stuff for their own local tournaments, you can check out a website I've been working on. It's called nomadpool.com and is totally free to run your tournaments. It saves time and keeps things running smoothly by drawing the bracket for you (including any byes), taking care of the table assignments, and sending sms text alerts to players telling them who they play and on which table. It also gives your players and viewers the ability to see the live brackets and it can embed your ustream channel to show your live stream right on your tournament's page.  If anyone has any questions or would like me to add a new venue, just let me know. You can also check out a tournament that's happening out here near Detroit tonight by tuning into the tournament page and viewing the live stream and brackets... http://nomadpool.com/tournaments/802"

billiards,39g0l2,wordysanchez,2,Thu Jun 11 14:12:30 2015 UTC,"If you get a pool table, put it in a place where you don't have to move it. Moving it ruins the way it was leveled when it was installed. Adding wheels to the legs only makes it easier to move a table. They also will likely serve as a failing point as the table is heavy for a reason  No one likes an unlevel table.

My teammates are like brothers to me, I have made some great friends, who will continue to be companions for a long time to come. I hear what you're saying, and I can't agree more."
billiards,39c6f4,mcreeves,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:03:16 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I've been shooting BCA 8-ball for about 6 years now, and I absolutely love the people I shoot with - we may not win much, but damn we have fun!  I just wanna know where you found a tournament with a $1400 prize that you could win as an APA 3 handicap.  For my one session in APA 9-ball, I carried a 4 handicap, and to be honest, I would not even CONSIDER trying to enter a tournament, because in my area, there are so many 5 & 6 handicaps in the area.  In my BCA 8-ball league, I bounce between a 3 and a 4.  I've gotten much better - but I still need to work on my bank shots."
billiards,39c6f4,jerutley,0,Thu Jun 11 17:59:28 2015 UTC,It wasn't an APA official tournament. And it was a 9 ball tournament that was scored by rack (like 8 ball) instead of ball count.   It was tiered off by skill levels. 1-3. 4-5. 6-7. 8-9. Then the top two of each tier competed for the ultimate prize. I won the 1-3 tier. The money was split between tournament prize and Calcutta.   It was a really cool experience because I got to sit down and talk (and also get some coaching from) with Kenny Brisbon. Who was recently on the cover of APA magazine.   Hahah. So no. I didn't beat a bunch of 9's to win.

billiards,39b0l5,wingsarchitect,4,Wed Jun 10 15:10:41 2015 UTC,"I think the condition of the surface of the tip can really affect the way chalk sticks to the tip. I begin each playing session by carefully cleaning the dome of the tip with a Willard scuffer. I place the scuffer in the center of the dome and apply very, very light pressure as I spin the shaft. As the shaft spins, I gradually begin to change the angle of the scuffer so the grit begins to gently scratch the tip leather until I reach the edge of the dome. I always scuff with a spinning action, never a ""wiping"" movement that goes back and forth across the dome. I blow out the dust inside the scuffer a few times during this procedure to remove the contaminants from the scuffer. I end up with fine circular scratches in the dome which begin in the center and radiate outward toward the edge of the dome. No ""fuzziness"", no chunks, no clumps of leather at all. Just fine scratches. The spinning movement also ensures I keep the shape of the dome consistent with no flat or uneven spots. I have also stripped away the thin film of shiny oil buildup that accumulates from striking the cue ball after handling the ball. The leather is relatively clean and now has a perfect texture of fine scratches to hold fresh chalk dust.   My chalking procedure is very brief and creates very little ""dust"" on my hand or my ferrule. After preparing my tip in the way I described above, all it takes is a quick circular ""wipe"" to put a thin coat of fresh chalk dust on the dome. My wiping action goes in one direction only, and only makes one trip around the round face of the dome. I chalk between every shot. Going in a circular direction and not going back and forth across the tip will keep the excess dust to a minimum, and my hand position is always above the cube of chalk so any dust that does fall simply falls away from my hand and my cue."
billiards,39b0l5,gabrielleigh,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:07:29 2015 UTC,"I have a slightly unrelated question for you about the Willard tool. What I've noticed is after a while using the Willard tool, stuff starts to build up on the bottom and it doesn't always like to get knocked out. When this happens, do you have a good way of cleaning it out or do you just purchase a new one?"
billiards,39b0l5,DarkKnight2060,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:57:45 2015 UTC,"Mine is like fifteen or twenty years old now I'd bet. I clean it out with a wire brush and compressed air several times a year. The grit is welded into the cup and never goes bad or falls out. You could use warm soapy water and an old toothbrush, too. Just make sure you dry off the Willard tool and let it air dry before putting it away. It is made from stamped steel and it will rust if you keep it wet for a long time."
billiards,39b0l5,gabrielleigh,4,Thu Jun 11 03:47:38 2015 UTC,"Hold the cue with your bridge hand and chalk with your stroke hand. Dont grind the chalk, brush the tip with the corners of the chalk. If you do it right, the chalk should end up with a shuriken-shaped pattern after a while as opposed to just a deep hole."
billiards,39b0l5,gotwired,3,Wed Jun 10 16:23:11 2015 UTC,"Technique makes all the difference. I only because you didn't mention how you chalk your tip. 'Swiping' chalk onto the tip results in a better chalk coat with less wear and tear as well as less chalk dust than the popular and destructive 'drilling' method. 'Drilling' the tip into the chalk will smooth out the tip, making it harder to get an even application of chalk, and get chalk dust every where. Take special notice when watching high level matches; the pros use relatively cheap chalk, but they (largely, I'm sure some don't) hold their cue horizontally, a couple quick swipes with the chalk, and then into the shot. No fuss, no muss, and no pile of blue dust falling around their fingers."
billiards,39b0l5,snowman818,3,Wed Jun 10 16:04:43 2015 UTC,Getting chalk on any part of your cue will not damage it.
billiards,39b0l5,rocksauce,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:56:18 2015 UTC,"This right here.  At the end of a session, I look like I gave a handjob to a smurf.  I'll grab a town and wipe down my shaft before it goes in my cue case and go to the bathroom and wash the chalk off my hands.  Some people rub a giant communal piece of white chalk to keep their bridge smooth, I end up dusting my bridge hand with blue chalk.  There's no functional difference, it just tends to stain my shaft a bit blue.  I'm more worried about performance than looks, so I don't really care that my shaft doesn't look shiny-new."
billiards,39b0l5,elint,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:06:17 2015 UTC,"Actually, there is a big difference.  The white cone of community ""chalk"" is actually powder, and is intended to reduce moisture on your hand, reducing the friction between your hand and the shaft.  Cue chalk does not provide this service, and is intended to increase friction.  Many great tips here about chalking your tip.  I always tell my students to pretend they are in Kindergarten, and that they are coloring their tip with a crayon.  Stay inside the lines, and make sure you provide a light, even coat.  Use the edges of the chalk, and only apply it to any bare spots you see."
billiards,39b0l5,mkglass,2,Thu Jun 11 15:42:13 2015 UTC,Watch some videos on how to chalk. If you do it a particular way it can help with this. Don't spin your cue in the chalk start at the top and bring down twist cue and repeat.
billiards,39b0l5,tearsofsadness,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:33:06 2015 UTC,You might be over chalking. Just swipe (paint) it over the tip once or twice between each shot and check every now and then for bald spots. Sounds like your grinding it in there.

However, if chalking your cue between shots has become part of your ""routine"", one of 2 things is going to happen. You're going to throw off your rhythm a bit, as I like the brief pause between shots to look at the table while I chalk. Or, you're going to accidentally pick up a cube of chalk, and chalk right over that expensive kamui chalk."
billiards,39b0l5,thepottsy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:42:08 2015 UTC,"It's probably your chalking technique.  If you're doing the ""jam the chalk down on the tip, and twist method"", stop.

billiards,398ntd,S0cr8t3s,7,Wed Jun 10 01:30:44 2015 UTC,"I do major surgery on pool cues for a living. I get to see the insides of pool cues all the time and I'd be happy to chip in my two cents on this issue.   The reason cheap cues are cheap is because of the sacrifices that must be made to produce a product that is profitable at a very low price point. To produce a pool cue at a profit for $20 (like a Valley bar cue) you have to go to extreme lengths to minimize the costs of production.   Automating virtually all areas of production goes a long way to reducing these costs. Huge initial investments are made in expensive machinery that automate and speed up the individual steps involved in transforming raw lumber into pool cue parts. This reduces the time invested in producing an individual part to a fraction of the time it would take a custom cue maker to do the same preparatory task by hand.   Huge cue factories often use the same exact species of woods that are used in nice custom cues. The reason custom cues are more expensive is because often the woods used in fine custom cues are hand selected with much more rigorous standards for quality than what is deemed acceptable for use in large factory cue production lines. Wood must be adequately dried before being turned into a pool cue, and the best way to do this is to simply allow the wood to become seasoned with age. The longer you can stretch out the drying process for wood, the less chance the wood will want to warp and shrink and crack after you finish building something with it. In production settings, time is money and cue factories need massive amounts of raw materials for production so they create processes to speed up this drying process and they end up producing wood that is pretty dry and pretty stable. Woods are quickly inspected, quickly tested for moisture content. Human hands spend just seconds of time reviewing these woods before they are fed into the large machines that process and cut them into the requisite shapes and pieces needed to make a cue.   There are examples where the species of wood used in a cheap cue actually really does negatively impact the quality of the cue. For example, many Chinese cues are made with a wood species called ""ramin"". Ramin wood is essentially what I view as the equivalent of pine here in the US. Very light, very splintery, very weak and prone to tear-out during machining. It is almost impossible to do precision machinework on ramin wood due to the weakness of the fibers. You can buy a boatload of ramin logs for next to nothing and some cue factories simply choose to save money on the raw materials by using inferior species of wood.   Another huge factor that influences the quality of the end product are the materials used to make the various non-wooden parts of the cue. Joint collars, buttcaps, ferrules, and joint pins. There are literally dozens of different materials used to make these various parts and pieces. Everything from cheap thermoformed plastics like ABS, PVC and other formulations. Various composite materials such as melamine, phenolic resin materials, fiberglass, G-10, carbon fiber, and other materials cost quite a bit more than the cheap plastics. Natural materials like bone, ivory, and other horns are used as well, but those items can be outrageously expensive. The choice in materials used to produce a cue will have a huge impact on the overall cost to make a cue. The cheap plastics used in many cheap cues are easy to machine and cost a few pennies to make all the parts for a pool cue. The problem is that plastic is simply not good for use on something that is intended to repeatedly smash hard objects thousands of times in its lifetime. The composite materials such as linen phenolic are much more expensive, but produce parts that can withstand the constant abuse of playing pool.   Joint pins are also a significant cost consideration in cuemaking, too. Many cheap import cues use a piece of threaded 5/16"" x 18 rod that is nickle plated to be all nice and shiny. These joint pins can be produced for a couple of cents for each pin. They are made from cast pot metal and are full of imperfections and weaknesses in the grain of the metal and the overall composition of the metal is soft and easily bent. Premium production and custom cues often come with joint pins that are machined from solid rod stock or billet material. The machined pins are generally stronger because they are often larger in size and made from much higher quality metal than the pot metal small pins in cheap cues. These expensive machined pins can cost between $10 and $20 each.... just for the joint pin.   Wraps are also an area where cost considerations often play out. For cues with string-style wraps, the premium material used is called ""Irish linen"". This is a product of the flax plant originally used as fishing line back in olde times. Somewhere along the way, somebody decided to wrap the handle of their pool cue with it and history was forever changed. There are only a few companies producing this material anymore, and the price for a spool of real Irish linen is pretty high. The cheap alternative for mass-production is the use of nylon (plastic) twine that is often made to look like Irish linen. It is glossy because it is plastic, and it is often simply wound onto the cue handle without the use of any adhesive because adhesive simply doesn't stick very well to it anyways because it is plastic. This is why nylon wraps on cheap cues come loose and begin to unravel after a short period of time.   The most important area of cuemaking where cost-cutting has the biggest impact is in the shaft of the cue. Top-tier playing cues are made with shaft wood that has passed an extremely picky selection and preparation process. The grain of the wood initially selected for use as shaft wood must be straight with virtually no waviness or ""run off"" (curvature). The drying and turning process to make a top-tier shaft is stretched out over the course of many years to allow the woods to rest and become seasoned to the climate of the cuemaker's shop. Shafts are incrementally turned down over many years until they eventually reach the desired size of a finished shaft. In large cue factories, it simply isn't feasible to stretch this process out that long. They shorten the time frame of wood drying and they take larger cuts over shorter periods of time to bring the shaft wood down to the desired size. The criteria for wood selection is also much less demanding, and many shafts are made that have small imperfections such as knots, grain irregularities, grain runoff and other undesirable issues.   Finally, the tip installed on the ferrule can heavily impact the cost of production. Many import cues come with tips made for just fractions of pennies. These tips often have imperfections in the leather and develop problems soon after you begin playing with them. Some cue companies spend a little bit more and install a decent entry-level tip like the LePro or Elkmaster, they cost about a quarter each. If you make the jump into the really popular layered tips, you can see the price skyrocket to $15-$20 for just the tip with brands like Kamui, Moori, and Tiger tips.   That pretty much explains some of the major differences in the materials used in pool cues and how they affect the final cost and price of a cue. I could go on for another whole page about the people who make the cues and how that affects the final product as well. You can imagine the difference when a product is engineered, built, and tested by experienced machinists and players who use these products on a daily basis. Many cheap cues are produced in factories where the employees are often not even avid pool players, but rather they are simply paid minimum wage to watch a machine churn out a part thousands of times a day. Cue factories employ designers who create flashy, trendy designs that appeal to the eye. They utilize materials which give the appearance of technological savvy, but often fail to produce durable parts and pieces which withstand the test of time.   There are certainly cheap cues that will work just fine and provide you with a satisfying experience. I didn't want to discourage you from buying any particular cue simply because it is low-priced. I just wanted to provide some background information to explain why cheap cues are cheap. Ironically, some of the most expensive brands of cues on the market are made in nearly identical circumstances, but the marketing hype creates a much higher sense of ""quality"" in these expensive brands. Huge advertisement and sponsorship budgets cause these brands to be thrown in our faces repeatedly at the highest levels of pool. We end up thinking ""well if the pros use these things, they must be better."" Sometimes that is true, sometimes it is a huge steaming pile of horse shit.   With any product or tool, always be skeptical of the hype and try things out for yourself. See how it performs in the field, and base your opinions on what you see for yourself over the long term life of a product. Sometimes cheap is good. Sometimes you can spend little money and get a great product that performs well for the money and meets all your needs. Sometimes cheap is bad, and you end up with a piece of junk that makes you sad and regretful. Knowing why something is cheap will go a long way in helping you make a good informed decision when purchasing an inexpensive pool cue."
billiards,398ntd,gabrielleigh,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:07:36 2015 UTC,"Firstly I have to say thanks for taking the time to share some of your knowledge. There is no doubt that many cues made in China are manufactured in the cheapest possible way, with the cheapest materials. However it is certainly possible for a cue made overseas to have comparable quality to one made in the US. It doesn't seem like this happens all that often but it certainly is possible. There are many people who are pleased with their predator shafts, for example.  For me it all really comes down to a cost vs benefit analysis. I accept that the cue I just purchased has curly maple instead of some higher quality wood. I know that far more time and care would have gone into a $500 custom cue. That said, it's what I expect when paying $200 and I hope it will serve me as a good progression cue. The information you provided is very useful but I have a few questions.   What do you think of 3/8 x 10 joint pins?  Is a solid core ld shaft a sort of middle ground between a standard shaft and a full (partially hollow) ld shaft?  And last, which brands of production cues do you think use the highest quality materials/production process? I know this is slightly subjective but you seem to have a lot of experience. Perhaps you could list a few brands in different tiers.  Thanks again."
billiards,398ntd,gabrielleigh,2,Thu Jun 11 01:52:27 2015 UTC,"I love the 3/8"" x 10 joint pins in all of their various forms. McDermott uses the cheapest version of this pin which I think is still very strong and reliable due to the robust size of the pin when compared to the ""small"" pins used in other cues. I use the cheap 3/8 pins in cue projects where people are really tight on money but still want a strong pin. There are some really slick CNC machined ""flat barrel"" 3/8"" pins that look amazing and come in brass, aluminum, stainless, and titanium and even G-10 too. Those cost a bit more, like in the $10 range.   I build solid wood ""LD"" shafts in my shop for people who want the strength of a traditional wood shaft with some of the same characteristics as the popular hollow LD laminated shafts. Instead of splicing together strips of wood and then boring it out to make it hollow, I use a mix of ultralite materials and a very light species of wood to create a solid shaft that has similar mass at the tip to the hollow LD shafts being marketed today.  I'd say they are definitely a middle ground between the traditional wood shafts and the hollow spliced LD shafts.   I think most of the well known brands can be just fine and perform well for the money. There are some ""red flags"" I look for when assessing the quality of any pool cue. Regardless of the price or brand of the cue, I'd avoid any cue that has any of the following things:  -Plastic ferrules. The ferrule takes a lot of abuse during the life of a cue, and replacing them can be expensive and time consuming. Look for a cue that is built with a composite ferrule and you'll likely never have any trouble with ferrule breakage.   -Screw on tips. This is a hallmark of a poorly-made cue and should be avoided like the plague. Almost always seen in conjunction with extremely soft plastic junk ferrules.   -Cues constructed with ""ramin"" wood. This wood is darker and browner than maple and can be spotted by anyone with a sharp eye who knows what to look for. Ramin wood is a cheap disposable furniture wood that is used to make dollar store shelves, tables, and other disposable pieces of cheap shit. Some genius decided it would be awesome to try to make pool cues out of it, and somehow millions and millions of them have been purchased by people. It is the stuff of nightmares for cue repairmen. Avoid any cue made with ramin wood.   The price has nothing to do with the potential quality of the pool cue. A good cue simply needs to be made from decent woods which have undergone sensible preparation. A vast majority of pool cues in the US are made from plain ol' hard maple which is one of the most affordable domestic hardwoods available. It runs between $5 and $8 per board foot in my area, cheaper than woods like walnut and some of the oaks. An average pool cue is made from almost exactly one cubic foot of wood. So you can spend less than $10 and have all the wood you need to build a perfectly good pool cue. The cheap 3/8"" x 10 pins I talked about earlier cost $2 each. A ferrule costs about fifty cents to make from a good linen phenolic material. Collars are another fifty cents, a buttcap costs about a buck. The rubber bumper is about fifty cents. All-in-all, you can acquire all of the materials to build a fantastic playing cue for less than $20.  For entry-level production cues, I like the McDermott cues because they use the 3/8"" x 10 big pin in all of their cues. This joint is simply much stronger than the smaller 5/16"" pins found in other brands. Lucasi and Players are great for the money. They seem to be put together fairly well and I rarely see major issues with these cues that can be attributed directly to poor quality construction. I have always like the way Meucci cues played, but ever since I began building cues I have developed an intense distaste for the Meucci ferrule design. I have replaced a hundred of them due to cracking, and every time I remove the broken ferrule I think ""how in the hell did they ever expect this to last very long?"". I replace the weak plastic with a composite material and they never have to come back in the shop again. Aside from those major brands, I see lots of random off-brand stuff that all appears to come from the same factories with different brands stamped on them.   The name on the cue certainly doesn't mean it will play well or play poorly. The price will, likewise, have little impact on the performance of the cue. What is important is to look for a cue that is setup in a way that meets as many of your personal preferences as possible. Cue weight, cue length, taper style and tip choice are much more important factors in determining whether a cue is ""good"" for you. I have grabbed 50 year old bar cues off the wall and been able to do anything in the world with them. Bent, beat up old sticks that just play like the wind. I have played with custom cues that cost thousands of dollars that I absolutely hated. It all comes down to having a cue setup the way you like it. Cues are like custom tailored suits. It doesn't matter if it is a Ralph Lauren suit if it wasn't made to your measurements.... you'll hate it. Cues are the same way. Get one set up how you like it and you'll play your best game."
billiards,398ntd,petester,9,Thu Jun 11 03:19:59 2015 UTC,"cuz murica  EDIT:  I decided to try to be constructive.  China has traditionally been known for mass-production.  Mass manufacture used to mean a tradeoff between quantity and quality, meaning China is also known for low quality products.  In the past decade, however, manufacturing technology has improved a lot, and the quality of mass produced products has increased dramatically. Even though China can now produce super-high quality products (Apple's Foxconn for example,) their reputation for quality manufacturing hasn't improved at all in the public mind.  So I'm saying a lot of what you read about Chinese products might be explained by a bit of psychology.  When double blinded, professional musicians can't tell the difference between a stradivarius violin and a newer high-quality instrument.    I'm a novice in pool, and therefore very open to the idea that I'm wrong, but it's not far-fetched that cognitive bias is the reason American custom cues are preferred over Chinese ones.  I'm willing to bet that a modern mass manufacture Chinese cue can perform on the same level as most customs."

billiards,398ntd,too_lazy_2_punctuate,2,Wed Jun 10 03:15:54 2015 UTC,I think a 200$ is about the same quality as a 200 McDermott or meucci. Chinese or American for 200$ you just aren't getting a top of the line cue. Which is fine.
billiards,398ntd,carter1984,3,Wed Jun 10 12:56:30 2015 UTC,"So are you telling me a cue that was made with 200 year old reclaimed wood from Lake Michigan, 200+ inlays, pre-ban ivory ferrule and collars, and an eel wrap is going to instantly make you four balls better?   I saw Kelly Fisher come to this country a decade ago and absolutely slay opponents with a $200 cue.  What that begs the question - exactly what IS a top of the line cue?  I honestly believe that once you get over the $200 (roughly) price point, you are paying for artwork rather than performance. A $1200 cue isn't going to make you sink any more balls, but it may be absolutely gorgeous and a limited edition or one-of-a-kind.   The same might not have been said 20 or 30 years ago, but I have been to manufacturing facilities in China an seen how they upgraded their facilities and their methods to copy American custom cue makers ""best practices"". Everything from selecting woods to turning shafts has been influence by americans going over to these factories and educating owners and managers on how to produce a good quality product.   Are there still cheap cues coming out of China? Of Course there are. Go to any Walmart, Dicks, or other big box store and you will see what the low end of production cues look like. There are also some VERY high end, high performance cues coming our of China as well.  I guess what most people forget is that OEM is done according to the specifications of the customer. One factory might make 5 brands, but it will be different based on the requests of each of the 5 different customers. One customer might want price point only, so they demand the cheapest asian wood with the cheapest plastic components and disposable (screw in or slip on) tips. Another customer might demand only AAA grade shaft wood purchased from Canada or N Michigan, pins manufactured in FL, inlays imported from the mediterranean, and high grade stack leather wraps.   The bottom line is that the quality of product should be associated with the brand rather than the country of origin. If a brand stands behind their products, minds their P's and Q's, and instills trust in consumers, then it should matter where their product is made."

billiards,398ntd,elint,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:23:56 2015 UTC,"I don't seen it as really ""hate"" just preference. Some manufacturers started over here in the States with quality aged wood and attention to detail. Then when their business picked up they moved operations over to China to increase production and lower costs/increase profit. They were no longer using the same quality of materials and sacrificing attention to detail for quantity.  For the longest time cues coming from China were made with Ramin wood. It's a much cheaper wood that doesn't make for good cues. These are the cheap sticks you can find in the big box stores. This gave Chinese cues a bad rep among pool players.  The good American custom cue builders tend to have aged wood that has been cored and hanging for years. That wood doesn't tend to warp or change shape due to the aging process. When stuff moved to China they didn't use wood that had been stabilized like this. That coupled with the fact that the climate is different and shipping it across the world can cause the cue to warp and develop more problems. Some of these issues can and are being resolved and some can't. So now-a-days you can find decent cues coming out of China. China is the biggest growth market for pool right now. I think you'll see quality continue to improve in some cues but it'll take a while for them to undue some of the past damage to the ""Made in China"" label.  It can go the other way too. Look at JB Cases. He started using Chinese construction on some of his cases and they quickly became one of the best deals around. The materials and construction are solid due to Chinese having a lot of practice with stuff like that in luggage and other construction."

Just chill out, enjoy your equipment, and have fun playing pool.  Maybe one day you'll grow out of this phase and stop giving a shit what a bunch of internet forum nerds think about the brand of cue that you bought into.  I got a Lucasi cue I picked up back around '03, and I picked up a predator 314 shaft at the same time.  Chinese cue with a Chinese shaft.  I knew what I was playing with, and I knew what people say about Chinese companies, but I didn't give a shit.  I've enjoyed that cue for years.  A few years ago the shaft broke and I replaced it with another Chinese shaft -- a Predator 3142.  Recently I finally bought an American shaft (OB Pro+).  They're all good hardware.  I think my next cue will be an American-made custom because I can afford more now than I could 13 years ago, and I want something that I don't see another one of every couple of years.  It doesn't make my Chinese cue any shittier -- it's still a nice piece of hardware.  tldr; grow a pair, stop giving a shit about what other people think about you."

billiards,398ntd,outside_english,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:38:50 2015 UTC,"China is not a developing nation and you can't just call people racist for not liking Chinese goods. Good products can and do come from china, but the majority of factories in china are pretty awful. The nicer factories that make higher end goods also have costs closer to American factories. You then have to factor in tariffs and import costs that raise the cost of goods without adding to their quality. My personal opinion about Chinese cues is that the roughly ~$200 Lucasi I have plays nicely and is of good quality. If I had to guess I would say because pool is an international game and popular in many parts of Asia then there are probably people with billiard product experience in the manufacturing process. Just because someone doesn't like a product from another country doesn't make them racist. I will never buy a Chinese car for instance because they have yet to make one good enough."

billiards,3939b5,gabrielleigh,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:39:55 2015 UTC,"No idea in the world. I have never seen or heard of him outside references to this TV show. He is a big box player who favors 1P, so I'd suspect he'd like a 60"" cue with an optional extension. He seems to like a 13mm pro tapered shaft since that is the particular version of OB he is using. I am surprised he doesn't prefer the smaller OB considering he likes 1P so much.   I think he said he was swinging one of the OB Rift break cues with the Speed Break shaft which is 13.25 mm with a phenolic tip. This leads me to believe he is more of a center-ball powerbreaker in 9-ball rather than a Deuel-esque control breaker. I'd have to watch some footage of his game to really speculate any further about what he might like outside of the realm of the sponsored OB cues he has now. Also, I have no idea how tall he is, how strong he is, what his wingspan looks like or any of that stuff. I just took a shot in the dark with the question about what he liked to shoot with. Maybe I can get a follow up response with some more details."

billiards,394hz6,poshio,3,Tue Jun 9 05:04:07 2015 UTC,"Carom cues are typically a little shorter, have a smaller tip (11-12mm diameter), and have a stiffer conical taper than pool cues. The stiff taper is needed for the larger, heavier carom balls.  Snooker cues have even smaller tips than carom cues (9-11mm diameter). Some will use ash wood instead of maple, which provides a different stiffness and feel.  The joint provides a different feel or feedback from the hit. Even some pool cues with a metal pin feature a wood-to-wood contact for a more traditional feel. Also, using metal in the joint will affect the cue's balance point."
billiards,394hz6,trickshottim,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:38:13 2015 UTC,Thank you! So should I avoid playing carom with my pool cue?

billiards,394hz6,wefolas,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:15:27 2015 UTC,"I should clarify first, apparently there are different carom cues for balkline and 3 cushion.  I'm referring to 3 cushion.  I disagree.  It's sort of like do you break with your playing cue?  Some people do, some people don't.  Sure, you can, but generally I try to avoid the added stress to my cue and the tip.  You're sending a much heavier ball a much longer distance.  I pretty much always grab a house cue if I'm playing 3 cushion."
billiards,394hz6,Liquidicity,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:51:46 2015 UTC,"well you can certainly play carom with your playing cue without damaging it. I also think if you play carom with your pool-cue and damage it, you would most likely also have damaged the carom cue. It's still the same wood and the same leather. I agree that it would most likely not be a good idea to use your LD-Shaft for a full force elevated masse ... but a standard wooden shaft should have no issues at all."

She lost the first game, so 3 in a row. She squeaks out 2 games with great cuts. I'm chewing the wooden bartop because of my nerves. I turn around to drink my beer and the place erupts. I said ""what happened?"" ""Your girl just hit the 8 on the break!"" We've been practicing this because she's showed a lot of interest in it. First time ever in league she did it to win a trip to Vegas. I was emotional and very proud. There is a future pro-player in that belly that's already winning tournaments from the womb.

So there isn't really much resale value. But if you want exotic woods and real inlays, you can't find anything else like his product. I've used mine for over 5 years as an APA 6, and never been tempted to upgrade. I wanted one with as much turquoise as possible, so I waited until I saw one I liked that actually had an 8 point high/low forearm, where the low points were entirely turquoise.   Only thing is you have to be patient. He usually has 4-5 new ones a week, and only get them from his store. You can get radial shaft upgrades (mine works as well as a my friends' big name upgrades) or add on a predator from somewhere. I'll be honest though, this isn't one of his best weeks."

The reason collectors hate him is because he completely switched from being a legit cue maker to a large volume/low quality production house and completely decimated the secondary market for his cues. The people who supported him and ultimately paid for his fancy CNC equipment were the ones he shitted on the most.   There is nothing wrong with making a lot of cues. Schon are production and have a strong collector following.  The problem is when your cues fall apart, are not really one of a kind and show absolutely no attention to detail.  He gives custom cue makers a bad name. I've personally seen his cues fall apart so I'm speaking from first hand experience as well."

Your team will have matches at various times, and it's convenient to go up to your room and rest. Some matches end at 1:30am.  Don't party too much. Get your rest for your matches and eat well before your match. You can bring water and snacks with you.   If they use the same tables as last year and the year before, the cloth is slow but the pockets are huge. Spend A LOT of time on the practice tables. It's a dollar a game and there are change machines right outside the rooms.  Lastly, although it's great to play everyone, stick to the best strategy on match ups.   A lot of the other posts here covered most everything else."
billiards,390yr3,qatmandue,6,Mon Jun 8 16:12:37 2015 UTC,"*Edit: Sorry, long post below.  What game are you going to be playing primarily? 8-ball or 9-ball? Anyways, here are some do's and dont's on the barbox:  Regarding the difficulty when transitioning from a 9 footer to a bar table, 8-ball is significantly more difficult on a bar table. Yes, pocketing balls is a lot easier than on a 9-footer, but cue ball is key here. You are playing on a smaller table, but the balls are the same size, so you have less surface area, which means more traffic. It's easier to hook yourself.  8-ball: When you are at the table and it's a mess, and running out is highly unlikely, ever ball of yours that you pocket is like taking a dagger and sticking it into your back. This is one of the most costly mistakes that I see amateurs make, especially on the bar table. They have one or two opening shots, and they ignore their problem balls until later. They run five or six balls and they're stuck. When you only have one or two balls left on the table and you are forced into a safety battle, against a competent player you will lose. They have so many of their balls to stick whitey behind and get ball in hand.   Another mistake players make is when there is an open table, and for example one group has all 7 balls up but aren't laying too badly, and the other group has 4 or 5 balls up, and are laying worse. The bad players always seem to pick the group that has the least balls, I guess because they feel like it's less work, even though they have a ball frozen to the side rail near the side pocket, or they have a ball laying in the middle of the table that has only one pocket it can go into, or etc. etc.  Forget about ball count, pick the group that is laying the best. Even if you can't get out, when you have more balls on the table, you have the advantage when you get into a safety battle.  Lastly, since it is a barbox and you have less surface area (which requires finer cue ball control than on a 9 footer), even on open racks that can be ran, there is usually one or two problem balls. take care of those balls ASAP. If you have to run two balls to get the right angle to get on the problem ball, that's completely fine. Make your entire effort of your run focused on the most difficult parts of the table first. Think of that ball that's lying in the worst spot as the 8-ball. If you can free it up and get position, that's the game winning shot. Not the simple straight-in 8ball.   Bear in mind that these are general rules of thumb. No two racks are the same, and in some cases, it's absolutely correct to take care of your problem ball later, as long as you're not banging the ball around and smashing into a cluster. If you can set yourself up for the right angle where you can nudge the cluster and get shape on the ball, and when you do so, if that ball is your out ball (the ball you shoot before the 8) and you can control it, then by all means go for it.   Breaking in 8-ball on the barbox, unless you are going for the cut break, don't break from the side rail. Or anywhere near the side. Your percentage of pocketing a ball on the break goes way down if you are going for a full-contact head ball hard break but you are breaking from the side. Break just left or right of the head spot. You will need to choose which side of the headspot because every table has its sweet spot. Once you find it, keep breaking the same way and the same speed, and control whitey. If you discover that you need to take a little power off the break to get that wing ball to go, just keep replicating it.  Regarding 9-ball: 9-ball is a bit easier on a bar table than it is on a big table since it's easier to pocket balls, and 9 balls on the table means less traffic than 8 obviously. For 9 ball you want to be breaking from the side. You don't need to break from the rail, it can be next to it. You just want to make sure that you are sending maximum energy to the row of balls just behind the 1 (facing towards you). That's highest percentage chance of pocketing a ball. The 1 can go in the side, and the wing ball usually goes one rail into the opposite corner pocket (or in that direction). The key here of course is both consistency in how the balls are racked (if it's not rack your own, and you are allowed to check the racks that they are giving you, DO SO every break. There are so many subtle ways to make a rack look like it's tight but it's a slug. A small gap between the back ball can do it, so can a gap behind the wing ball. Players are too focused on whether the first two balls are frozen to the 1.   Last thing I should mention is that the corner pockets are much easier to pocket balls in than a 9-footer, but the side pockets aren't. They are made smaller on a barbox, so there are some of those thin back-cuts (where you can't see the contact point on the object ball) in the side that you might be a 70% favorite to make on a 9-footer, you're less a favorite on a barbox. A lot of times it's a lot easier to take the cross side bank than go for the thin blind cut. Even though balls are going to be easier to pocket for the most part, keep your focus and bear down just like you would on any shots on a 9-footer.   Last thing- I heard a rumor that APA (if that is what you're talking about) uses shit cloth for the tables at the nationals. Instead of new Simonis 860 I heard that the cloth is a bit thicker than normal. If that's the case, spin is going to catch quicker, and it's a huge difference compared to new fast cloth. On new fast cloth like Simonis 860, the balls slide longer before spin catches.   You probably know must of this already, but if I helped in any way I would be glad. Good luck and shoot straight."

My team went to Vegas for 9-ball a couple of years ago and we had two of our players (including myself) bumped up skill levels unexpectedly. This really limited which players we could field and still make the skill cap. The partying and skill cap came together to really screw us because the skill level changes required us to throw a player that we thought was going to be able to take the morning round off and he was in no condition to play. Minis can be a ton of fun after you are done with the team play. Mostly though, have fun! Even though we didn't get very far, it was still one of the high points of my APA career."

If you plan to do things in the day before you shoot, just remember that you will get dehydrated super fast.  -Vegas isn't cheap. If you're going to be there for a week, and don't have a ton of money to spend, you'll have to plan. When it used to be at the Riviera, there was a McDonalds across the street. But they don't have a dollar menu. So even the stuff you're used to being cheap will cost more. And the pool stuff you can buy there can all be had cheaper online.  -The hotel is really far from the main strip.

Meet the pros (many of them are manning booths).  I recommend meeting Stefano Pelinga -- he is a very genuine guy, and remembered my name the next time I saw him (a year later).  Take some opportunities to play them if you can -- I beat Ralf Souquet 3-0 to win a rosewood Gator Grip a couple of years ago. :) Bring your walking shoes.  It's a VERY long walk from the rooms to the tables. Once the pro matches are done, they might let you play on those tables for a small fee (was $10 when I was there two years ago, but that was BCAPL).  Take advantage if you can. When playing, just play for fun. The odds of you making it all the way through to the finals is very slim, but you'll have a better chance if you just remind yourself that you made it to Vegas, and just have a good time. Get away from the Rio a couple of times.   Eat at the steakhouse for one night, at least.  They'll give you free admission to the club on the roof. Get plenty of rest.  Cat-naps are your friend.

billiards,390yr3,moar_distractions,3,Mon Jun 8 14:45:26 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily only because of it. One of the ways to win in the APA is by having new players who get better fast, it takes some time for the handicap to catch up. Or even some sort of experienced players who just never really tried so hard and suddenly had something click or they get really into it and practice a lot.   As an example, I played a tiny bit in high school, but got really into playing at a local hall in my 20s with an new girlfriend who also loved it. We played at least 5-6 hours a week, sometimes more. After a few months, we joined a team and were playing a ton more. I lost my first match as a 3 and went down to 2. Then I started winning. I got moved up throughout the season, but I was always ahead of my handicap. I ended up going 10-2 for the season, and only lost top gun by 1 point to someone else on our team. I had to hear about me being a cheater every week. All I was doing was trying my hardest to improve and was getting called a cheater, after really only playing competitively for less than a year. We won the fall session, came in second or third the spring, then won the LTC. I actually got moved up to a 5 right before leaving for Vegas. And even in Vegas, people complained and my games got watched. They made me a 6 while I was there which means I can never play APA below that. But then I broke up with the girl, didn't play much and even now that I'm back into it, I'm not playing nearly as much as I was then, and it's really really tough for me to win matches as a 6. I dropped out of APA and play in a house league, where the hall owner sets the handicaps. It's much better."

I'm a 5 now but it took a few years to get it back after a couple off completely.   Edit: I loved 99 Critical Shots in Pool. Highly recommended."
billiards,390yr3,jtgraphic,2,Mon Jun 15 01:19:31 2015 UTC,"I'm a 3 and beat a 5 19-1 this weekend for the LTC. I wasn't sandbagging or anything, but I'm VERY inconsistent. That's the problem with low level players. They are on or off, and when they're on, they can play like a 4 or 5, but a 2 when they're off."
billiards,390yr3,onwee,2,Mon Jun 8 23:42:41 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it can just be overall skill differences between leagues rather than sandbagging. It's easy to become ranked highly playing against people who don't know what they're doing (e.g. attempting impossible run outs and leaving open table), and similarly easy to receive a lower ranking than your skill would suggest by playing more strategically (e.g. playing more safeties that aren't scored properly). I'm regularly accused of sandbagging at area and Vegas APA tournaments by butt-hurt people, who just don't get it: it's not sandbagging, at least not intentionally, just an imperfect handicapping system."

billiards,393ku1,EtDM,2,Tue Jun 9 11:27:10 2015 UTC,"The red and black dyes used in chalk are two of the most difficult colors to remove from a shaft. From a chemistry point of view, I don't know why that is but something about those two colors are brutal for trying to get out of shaft wood. Like Lxrge said, you can probably go a long way in cleaning it up using the method he said. If you simply can't get it to the shape you would like it to be in by using these methods, I'd suggest looking up your local cue repairman and having them clean the shaft on the lathe and apply a fresh coat of shaft sealer to protect the newly-cleaned wood."
billiards,393ku1,gabrielleigh,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:07:45 2015 UTC,"Cheap fix would be take isopropyl alcohol and a rag and douse the rag a bit and rub it up and down the shaft, that's for the red. Once done with that take a QWIZ and burnish it or any leather you have around the house."

billiards,38zuhm,oviforconnsmythe,5,Mon Jun 8 05:38:27 2015 UTC,"If its after the break and the person shooting has called a 'push' shot, then it is not a foul.

billiards,38zuhm,SoYppah,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:54:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I kinda understand pushshots. Is this when, after the break, you can choose to shoot the cue ball anywhere and sink anything (except the 9 ball) or not hit anything, and at that point, you can shoot again, except this time going for the lowest number?"
billiards,38zuhm,jlt6666,2,Mon Jun 8 06:05:30 2015 UTC,It should be noted that a push shot is not allowed in APA in case that comes into play in your situation.
billiards,38zuhm,Jamuraan1,2,Mon Jun 8 07:42:34 2015 UTC,"after the break, you can choose to shoot the cue ball anywhere and sink anything or not hit anything   This is correct, but you can still hit/pocket the 9-ball, it simply gets spotted on the Foot Spot.   One caveat, your opponent has the option to take the shot after your push, or to give it back to you."
billiards,38zuhm,CreeDorofl,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:49:43 2015 UTC,"To clarify, after the push (which works as you described), you don't get to shoot again necessarily, the opponent has the option. They can shoot, or make you shoot if they don't like it.   There are no fouls during the push except jumping a ball off the table (I think? it's never come up) or pushing the cue ball into the pocket, which can happen if you're careless and trying to just gently roll it very near a corner."
billiards,38zuhm,40-love_kittygirl,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:09:57 2015 UTC,"on a push shot, it is a good strategy to pocket the nine ball if it is sitting in or near a pocket. this eliminates the early combination option if you don't have a shot on the one that will lead you up to the possible combo ball. the nine will be spotted. make sense?"
billiards,38zuhm,HappySoda,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:06:11 2015 UTC,"Wait, but it is a foul if you actually sink something on a push, no?"
billiards,38zuhm,Jamuraan1,3,Mon Jun 8 07:17:39 2015 UTC,"No, it's not. You can intentionally pocket a ball with a push, and as long as it isn't the 9, you don't spot it. The 9 would be spotted on the foot spot."
billiards,38zuhm,Midnight06,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:47:37 2015 UTC,"So if I was playing someone and I gave them the 7 ball, could I call a push after the break, intentionally sink the 7 and take away their advantage? Or would the 7 be the same as the 9 in this case?"
billiards,38zuhm,CreeDorofl,2,Mon Jun 8 08:01:14 2015 UTC,"In gambling, there is no absolute cut-and-dried rule on situations like this... don't let someone tell you ""this is how all gamblers handle this situation"" because they're either mistaken or lying to get an advantage. People argue about this kind of stuff a lot unfortunately.  In one area, it might be normal for a player to sink the other guy's money ball on a push. In another area, it might be strictly forbidden. The only way to be 100% safe is to ask first and agree on the rule beforehand. Don't assume anything unless you love confrontations."
billiards,38zuhm,dickskittles,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:19:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're right about this, Matt.  The rule about respotting money balls on fouls/pushes is that if a player pockets his own money ball (i.e. the player getting weight) on a foul/push, it stays down, whereas if it's his opponent's money ball (i.e. he's the player giving weight), it spots.  Granted, this rule is unwritten, but if any experienced money player anywhere tells you otherwise, I'd submit he's trying to pull a fast one on you."
billiards,38zuhm,CreeDorofl,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:35:46 2015 UTC,"You know what's funny is... I was googling for a thread where I remember people arguing about this on AZBilliards, and found a post I'd made back in 2010 that I totally forgot about. I don't think my mind has changed since then.   But anyway, as for what you're saying is the widely accepted unwritten rule... in that AZ thread you will see people say ""if the guy getting the spot pushes it in, it stays down"" but you will also see ""I have never seen once in 30 years a money ball stay down"", and people who say ""their money ball is to be treated exactly like the 9 ball therefore it comes back up on any break, push, or foul"".   So while you may not have experienced it [yet], I promise you that somewhere there's a guy who will argue with you on this unwritten rule. Not necessarily because they're trying to pull a move, but maybe because he just grew up in a different area with different rules.  Best policy is to never assume."
billiards,38zuhm,Lord_Napalm,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:13:56 2015 UTC,"I've done this on multiple occasions. It sucks for the opponent, but it's the name of the game. I don't see how it wouldn't be allowed. They might get upset, and they probably will, but it's gambling."
billiards,38zuhm,elint,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:31:08 2015 UTC,"Balls pocketed out of order never get spotted unless the ""out-of-order"" ball is the 9-ball, of course.  If you pocket the 9-ball on a foul, the 9-ball is the only ball that gets spotted.  Any other balls would remain pocketed.  So in OP's example, if you are on the 1-ball and you strike the 2-ball first (foul) and pot the 2-ball and the 9-ball, the 2-ball stays pocketed and the 9-ball gets spotted.  A similar rule involves balls that get knocked off the table (I know /u/oviforconnsmythe didn't ask about that, but it's similar to balls potted on fouls).  Balls on the floor are handled differently based on what rules you are playing by.  In the WPA rules, only the 9-ball is ever spotted.  In the APA rules, any object ball knocked off the table gets immediately spotted and it's not considered a foul if the shot is otherwise legal (if you otherwise made a legal shot).  If I am hitting the 1-ball and I strike it first, then it knocks the 2-ball off the table and the 1-ball falls in a pocket, I've legally sunk the 1-ball and I'm shooting at the 2-ball, which is now spotted."
billiards,38zuhm,elint,2,Tue Jun 16 17:24:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Just to confirm, so if you do strike the wrong ball first its a foul and the other player gets to shoot right? Where would the 9 ball be spotted?"
billiards,38zuhm,spiky67,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:30:02 2015 UTC,"If you foul in 9-ball, the other players gets to shoot, and they get ball-in-hand (they can place the cue ball anywhere on the table).  The 9-ball would be spotted on the ""foot spot"" (where you typically place the 1-ball when racking 9-ball, or some rule-sets place the 9-ball there.  Just google ""pool table foot spot"" if you need a diagram).  If the foot spot is occupied, you place it in a direct line behind the foot spot as close as you can to it.  If the entire line is occupied, you place it just in front of the foot spot (don't fudge the 9-ball left or right -- if it doesn't fit on the center-line of the table, move it further back or forwards).  from the WPA rules:   Balls are spotted (returned to play on the table) by placing them on the long string (long axis of the table) as close as possible to the foot spot and between the foot spot and the foot rail, without moving any interfering ball. If the spotted ball cannot be placed on the foot spot, it should be placed in contact (if possible) with the corresponding interfering ball. However, when the cue ball is next to the spotted ball, the spotted ball should not be placed in contact with the cue ball; a small separation must be maintained. If all of the long string below the foot spot is blocked by other balls, the ball is spotted above the foot spot, and as close as possible to the foot spot.   I would actually recommend thoroughly reading the WPA ruleset.  Or if you play in a league, read the ruleset for your particular league.  Most tournament and league rules are somewhat similar to the standardized WPA rules, so it's a good starting point of knowledge."
billiards,38zuhm,CreeDorofl,0,Wed Jun 17 14:42:11 2015 UTC,"On the push, if you sink something, it does not get spotted and your opponent goes and shoot the lowest ball. If you don't sink anything, your opponent has to shoot the lowest ball."
billiards,38zuhm,spiky67,0,Mon Jun 8 07:35:19 2015 UTC,"to be a little clearer, the opponent doesn't have to shoot anything. They can make you shoot it.   But no matter who shoots, once the push is over, the player must always hit the lowest ball first."

billiards,38tqj1,mattdebrown,2,Sat Jun 6 19:10:51 2015 UTC,"If you really want to nail down a repeatable location without any influence from the binder reinforcement stickers whatsoever, just cut them in half with scissors and apply the half-sticker to the location where you want to spot a ball, but make sure the sticker is oriented where you can roll the object ball into the spot and it will exit away from the half-sticker after contact so the sticker is never actually touched by the balls. Same idea for marking cue ball location, just put the half sticker on the shooters side of the cue ball and the cue ball will never be affected by the sticker.   I use them to mark the floor and/or walls of a pool room for using fly-on-the-wall systems, too. I never truly understood how much seasonal weather and humidity changes affected cue ball travel until I set up some stickers to map out a pool room, and over the course of the day or several days the locations of the ""flies"" which marked known shots would shift several inches as the air temperature and humidity changed in the room. The location of a fly on the wall for three rail shots can move by as much as a foot or more during the course of a large shift in ambient conditions, and if you play for long sessions at a time you can actually observe this shift like watching a sundial move on the ground."

These two systems are fantastic for getting me out of about 99% of hooks. They require no math, just simple observations and a little bit of pre-matchup testing to figure out the fly on the wall for the table you are playing on."
billiards,38tqj1,2A_is_the_best_A,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:56:04 2015 UTC,Makes no difference. Throw happens on the contact point between the balls. The cloth is not involved in throw.

billiards,38rq8h,gabrielleigh,2,Sat Jun 6 19:06:11 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure he means a cut of the exposure and traffic for the sub. From what I have seen, most AMAs are generally handled in /r/iama and often promoted in relevant subs like this one. They seem to be much more successful when they are planned and coordinated with the mods, and the mods often help the subject of the AMA understand the rules and expectations of doing an AMA. A careful balance needs to be struck since the subject of the AMA is often interested in not only answering questions from the community but also promoting projects or products they are associated with. The mods will often help ensure the tradeoff between self-promotion and quality community interaction is appropriate and fun for everyone. The mods mostly are volunteers, I am pretty sure very few are actually paid unless reddit determines there is a genuine need to hire a full time mod to manage a sub."

For me there is no equivalent to a tough tourney and when I am playing in one of those twice a year events I end up choking big time against lesser opponents. You need to play in as many weekly tourneys and money matches until you feel comfortable playing your game in any situation.

From personal experience, we had a TAP league in Austin, TX for a brief moment a few years ago, and I seem to recall that it was managed very poorly, so I would have guessed TAP.  The locals who run our bar leagues and tournaments are well-known and trustworthy around here :)"

billiards,38hmm0,asamimasa,2,Thu Jun 4 07:18:35 2015 UTC,/u/gabrielleigh should be around shortly with his typical helpful here's how I do it posts. I'll go ahead and blindly recommend you follow what he says.
billiards,38hmm0,fadedcheese,2,Thu Jun 4 13:16:47 2015 UTC,"Denatured alcohol will work fine to strip off the oils that build up and make a shaft feel sticky and tacky. You will want to use this sparingly, and always apply it to a paper towel first and gently wipe the shaft with the paper towel. Don't soak the towel, just get a spot on it damp with alcohol and use it to quickly wipe down the area of the shaft where you stroke. Avoid wiping down any areas near the joint where there is a clear coat or lacquer finish because the alcohol can cause the finish to separate from the wood if the wood at the edge of the finish gets wet from the alcohol. It generally won't dissolve the finish, but rather cause the surface wood to expand briefly which can break apart the weak physical bond the finish has with the wood.   As far as a sealer goes, I have had fantastic luck with a water-based sealer I bought at Ace Hardware. It is a store brand product intended to seal wood prior to painting or finishing. It is milky colored, but dries clear and does a great job of filling the pores of the wood with a moisture-resistant sealer that helps keep chalk dust and oils out of the wood. I dab some on a paper towel and apply it to the stroke area of the shaft when it is spinning on the lathe. I usually do three very light coats letting each coat dry for 30 seconds between coats. I then like to very quickly flatten the sealer with 1000 grit paper, then I burnish the shaft for a few seconds with the backside of the paper (no grit, just paper backing) to get a super-smooth matte finish that isn't shiny. The dull matte finish is what glides so smoothly where a shiny finish drags on your hands if you have any moisture or sweat at all.   I am not a user of any wax products on the shaft. I personally think the waxes are a bad idea because they are soft and they allow dirt and chalk dust to stick into the soft waxes and build up quickly on the shaft. Initially they make an impressively-smooth finish, but I think they cause oil and contaminant buildup to happen faster than non-waxed shafts. I prefer to just use the water based sealer I described above because it dries hard and resists stuff that would stick in the softer waxes. Waxes are also affected by the heat of your hands and they get gooey and uneven when your cue gets warmed up. The water-based sealer seems to be stable at all temps and I haven't seen it move around or do anything else that is annoying.   Sanding shafts has its benefits and its drawbacks. I personally love a 600-grit finish on my shaft. It is rough enough to allow the shaft to glide, but smooth enough I can't quite feel the sanding scratches. Ironically, shafts glide over your hand easier when they actually have a fine texture on them. A glass-like shine drags on your hands much more than a dull finish. Sanding your shaft with a Mr Clean pad, or a Scotch Brite pad, or any fine sandpaper will quickly and easily strip the shaft of any buildup, but you'll also run the risk of removing wood from the shaft when you do this. This can cause the shaft to eventually become smaller in diameter. An effect called ""hourglassing"" happens where the ferrule is actually larger in diameter than the shaft measured a few inches back from the ferrule. You can use these abrasives to clean and prepare the surface texture of your shaft, but you'll want to carefully observe the color of the dust that collects on the papers or pads. Initially, you will see dust that is blue-green in color and rather gummy and clogs up the paper or pad due to the oil content in the dust. Clean the pads thoroughly several times during your sanding process. Watch the color and texture of the dust and as soon as it becomes whiter and more powdery and ""dusty"", you have removed all of the buildup on the surface of the wood and you have now reached the actual wood itself and you should discontinue any further abrasive cleaning. You can then apply a thin layer of the sealer and flatten and burnish it like I described above. You'll add about a thousandth of an inch to the diameter of the shaft, and that layer will actually grow another thousandth or two as oil and dirt builds back up on the shaft from normal use. If you are careful, you can develop a cleaning process using the abrasive pads or papers which just affects this layer of sealer and buildup and never affects the actual wood of the shaft. The key in this process is to watch the color of your dusts and stop when you get through the layer of sealer and buildup. This process can be repeated hundreds of times without reducing the diameter of the shaft. I am five years into using one of my super light and delicate Ultralite LD shafts which are not nearly as hard and resilient as maple shafts and I clean mine in this manner on a weekly basis. After five years of constant use and thousands of games later, my shaft is the same size as the day I finished it with no hourglassing at all.   Regardless of what methods you end up using, the best way will be whatever way leaves you with the finish you like the most. My way is certainly not the right way or the only way, it is just one way among millions of ways you can achieve some desirable results in shaft cleaning. Every player develops different personal preferences and you may end up liking the waxed finishes better. If you like it better, then it is better. The condition of your shaft plays a huge role in your mental game, and you should always use maintenance methods that give you the most satisfaction regardless of what anyone else tells you. I know a guy who uses nothing but Ronsonol lighter fluid on his shaft. His shaft is now royal blue because the lighter fluid dissolves the blue dye in the chalk and causes it to soak deeply into the wood. He gets a rag out and drenches it in lighter fluid and rubs it all down the whole shaft and it drips off the bottom. Smells like a charcoal barbecue grille. He had me turn the shaft down a few years ago and I was afraid the fumes coming off the shaft would ignite and blow up my shop. Every pass I made to remove some wood made my whole shop smell like lighter fluid. The wood was blue all the way to the core from the lighter fluid he had drenched it with for the last twenty years. I got the shaft done and finished the way I like to finish them and he hated it. He promptly got out his rag and bottle of lighter fluid and hosed the thing down outside my shop and when he was done he had a big toothless grin and said ""That's much better!"". He jumped in his truck and cackled as he took off down the road."

It may work for you, but if somebody without experience starts trying to clean peoples shafts with sandpaper they could easily ruin the shaft if they aren't careful.  I would have a heart attack if my buddy used sand paper on my shaft. When I have my shaft cleaned on a lathe my guy uses a microfiber towel with what I assume is qclean or one of the cleaning solutions intended for use on a shaft (won't irritate skin) and takes the dirt off with generating heat or taking off wood."
billiards,38hmm0,ceezaleez,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:33:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, an inexperienced person could quickly do damage with sandpaper. I get to see the effects of over-zealous sandpaper usage every day when people bring in shafts for work."
billiards,38hmm0,gabrielleigh,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:05:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the superb input as always, Gabriel.  As far as the sealer, is there a brand name, or whatever you just happened to come across at the store by chance?  I'll hold off on the sanding for now for anything valuable, perhaps get some practice on a few of the disposable shafts that get used with my house table."
billiards,38hmm0,gabrielleigh,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:57:35 2015 UTC,"The stuff I have used for years is simply called Ace brand water based sealer. It doesn't have a special name or anything, just a store brand of water based sealer that works great for me. I assume it is probably about the same no matter what brand it is sold under, this one just happens to be under the Ace hardware brand."
billiards,38hmm0,gabrielleigh,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:09:44 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay thanks!  One more question- what happens to the ferrule throughout this process? I'm assuming it gets coated by the sealer as well, as I've never seen it get taped off during the sealing process."
billiards,38hmm0,gabrielleigh,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:08:47 2015 UTC,"Generally the ferrule is finished the same way as the shaft. The one exception I make is when I turn down a shaft to a smaller diameter and the ferrule is made of good quality linen phenolic or melamine that is porous. I like to seal the freshly exposed ferrule material with acrylic to fill the pores of the linen cloth and prevent chalk dust from staining the ferrule. Once the ferrule is sealed, then I proceed to go ahead and do the steps I outlined above. Shafts with cheap thermoset plastic ferrules like Predator, Meucci, and many other brands don't require this extra step because they use a cheap plastic that is non porous and has no reinforcing base material in its composition."
billiards,38hmm0,AK_Chrism,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:44:11 2015 UTC,"Ah, I'd never thought about different workflows for different ferrule materials. Do you change it up for laminated shafts? For example, I'm not sure if raising the grain with the denatured alcohol would be a big no-no for shafts like the OB2 or 314-2."
billiards,38hmm0,RenobMan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:19:27 2015 UTC,"Oh, I can't say I personally would be too worried about it as long as you make sure to apply the solution to a towel and use the damp towel to briefly and quickly wipe away the buildup. A tiny glue line is all that keeps these shafts from flying apart, so you want to avoid introducing any extra moisture or chemicals deep into the surfaces of these shafts for sure. A quick wipe down seems no different to me than simply using the shaft with warm moist hands anyways. Any kind of prolonged or extreme exposure to any kind of liquids will be especially bad for these laminated shafts. As long as you use these cleaning liquids sparingly and give the shaft plenty of time to dry between wipes you should be fine."

The rep points are actually counter-intuitive when it comes to the buyers/sellers. Anyone with massive rep is making a good chunk of change flipping cues and shafts, and their margin comes from sending people like me messages after the fact that say ""I spun the used shaft you sold me on a lathe and it isn't 100% straight like you said, more like 95%, give me 10% off or pay to have it shipped back to you.""  At any rate, when it comes to custom cue makers, I would cast a strong vote for Keith Josey.

billiards,38f8za,BeachBum2012,4,Wed Jun 3 23:35:32 2015 UTC,"References are a big part of choosing a good cue maker. Also, it is nice if you can find one within reasonable driving distance. Some areas of the country have lots of good makers within a short distance, where some areas are devoid of almost any kind of cue making or cue repair services of any kind. Trust your gut feeling. Just because one person likes or dislikes a particular maker does not mean you will necessarily feel the same way. Find a cue maker who works with you to achieve your project goals and isn't too pushy about their own personal preferences or tastes.   Some builders are very open-minded to customer designed projects, while others would rather not take on commissions and prefer to just build what they like and then offer it up for sale. Ask a lot of questions and try to get a feel for how the maker prefers to do business. Sometimes you will find a maker likes to do things in a way that seems compatible with your ideas, othertimes the maker will have policies and procedures which simply don't fit well with your plans. There is nothing wrong with having differences in philosophies or preferences, but getting (and giving) clear ideas and thoughts will go along way in avoiding unpleasant developments during the project. Speak your mind, and lay out as much as possible to the cue maker so they can get the best possible idea as to what you want in the project. There are certain parts of the project where you can be flexible and open to suggestions, but there are no reasons to make serious compromises about what you want. Cue makers often have impressive collections of woods and other materials, but we don't always have everything people want at all times. Be mindful that select materials may have to be ordered and processed many months before any actual work can begin. Woods are very moody and tempermental and should be worked with as slowly as possible. If you want a wood that isn't in the cuemaker's inventory, be prepared to stretch out the timetable for completion by months and possibly years while the newly-acquired woods rest and go through the stages of processing to prepare them for assembly into a pool cue.   If you have very specific ideas for what you want, draw up a blueprint of the layout of the cue. Write down the total length, total weight, shaft taper and tip diameter preferences. Write down any and all possible details of the build and make a copy of them and give them to the cue maker. This information is very important in planning a cue build and will make the job of designing the cue much easier and will increase the chances of producing a cue that meets your specs. A good cue maker will discuss design elements with you and give you objective information about how the various woods will impact these elements and offer alternative wood recommendations or construction methods to achieve your desired specs in the cue.   Get written estimates for the work, and be flexible with these numbers. Sometimes unexpected costs pop up and sometimes good deals are found which can raise or lower the cost of materials to build the cue. Work with the cue maker to keep things transparent and clearly understood by all parties so no unexpected surprises happen when the cue is done and it is time to settle up. Some makers insist on full or partial payment up front, others will do the build and only accept payment when the cue is finished and you are totally happy with it.   Like I said earlier, trust your gut feelings after having a few conversations with the maker. Sometimes personalities click, sometimes they clash. The best customer/cue maker relationships happen when the two people see eye-to-eye and work to make things right with each other. Unexpected delays happen in cue projects, be patient with the maker as they work through these things. Unexpected financial issues happen with customers, and makers should work with people on issues like this as well. Just treat people like you would appreciate being treated and things usually end up working out just fine."

Only fine tuning I need to do is to swap out to a medium/hard tip (personal preference) and that beauty will be hitting just the way I like it.
billiards,38f8za,gabrielleigh,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:18:28 2015 UTC,"Hah, thanks! Some people are fine with doing business on the web and they buy and sell a lot of cues this way. Word of mouth goes a long way to helping people become comfortable with those kinds of deals. It is particularly nice, though, when you can find someone in your area to work with. I push the whole ""go local"" thing pretty hard in everything I do. There are a couple hundred cue makers and repairers in the US and I do what I can to direct people to seek them out and utilize the ones working in their area. I do a lot of work for people in other parts of the world because they simply don't have anyone local in their area, or they may have differences in opinion with the makers who do happen to be local. It is fun to meet new people from other areas, though, and it was a pleasure to do business with you.   Cuemakers are essentially tasked with creating instruments which translate the intentions of the customer to the cueball on the table. The best cuemakers are the ones who listen and understand what the player is trying to say to the cueball, and they craft instruments which translate these intentions as accurately as possible to the cueball. I'd say the single most important thing you can look for in a builder is one who listens to you and works hard to build an instrument that is tuned to the unique dialect that you speak to the cueball. Some cuemakers have huge reputations and fame for the insanely awesome stuff they build. Some cuemakers are known for building super expensive ""show"" cues, others specialize in building ""players"" which see non-stop use in high pressure games all the time. Each maker has a style, and those styles are vastly different from each other in many cases. Some makers strive to mimic the styles and methods of past builders, others like to innovate and push the boundaries of new and experimental designs. Above all, look for a maker you can get along with. You want your cue maker to be the kind of person you'd invite to go to the bar and have a few drinks with. Your maker should take an interest in playing with you and observing your playing style, your stance, your stroke, and your personality. These things are extremely important in developing an understanding of the appropriate kind of cue a player needs. You need a maker who will get down in the trenches with you and wade through the mud to figure out why you have a particular problem, and what needs done to get past that issue. Be skeptical of makers who just try to fill your head with stuff they think is important. A good maker will spend far more time listening and watching you than telling you what they think. Every player has different needs and preferences, and every maker has different strengths and areas of experience. The right maker for you is one who has the right mix of skills to complement your wants and needs. Just because a particular maker is famous doesn't necessarily mean they will end up being a good match for what you want built, and just because a maker is obscure and not very well known doesn't mean they wont do an excellent job for you. One of the greatest builders in the world lives just an hour away from me and he has no website, no social media accounts. He doesn't advertise, he doesn't do shows or expos. He just works, and he is brilliant."

In my experience, most players love talking about/showing off their equipment. I don't think I've ever had someone say no when I've asked to try a cue, it's by far the best way to learn how a particular maker's cues play."
billiards,38f8za,Retroactive_Spider,0,Thu Jun 4 10:54:03 2015 UTC,"I have noticed most of the good players shoot with custom cues instead of mass produced ones   I've been down-voted before for saying this, but I'm still going to say again...  The only thing that matters for the butt of the cue is weight and balance.  Anything beyond that is just decoration.  As for shafts, most ""good players"" don't use the shaft that came with the cue.  Pros sometimes do, but that's because they have sponsorships with the cue makers.  They're on a far different level than us mere mortals anyway.  Having said that: don't base your decision to get a custom cue on whether other players have one.  You can get a factory cue (with a weight and balance that works for you) and a Predator shaft and that's all you'll need to be on the same playing field as the ""good players"" - at least as far as equipment goes.  You still need to have skill.  BUT don't let me talk you out of a custom cue.  I got mine second hand from a custom cue maker in the Bay Area, and I love it.  It doesn't play different from any of my other cues, but the fact that it is unique and the design is very minimalist (what I would have picked if I had designed it) is perfect for me."
billiards,38f8za,phigga,0,Thu Jun 4 03:49:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Some shooters say that the type of pin (both thread and material) matter greatly, but for most people, it's truly just the weight and balance of the butt that matter with regards to playability.  The wrap can make a difference to the feel of the cue, but should not affect shot making for a player with any experience. (That said, if you really hate something like a stacked leather wrap, I bet that would negatively affect the mental aspect of your game).  The best shooter in our league shoots with a Viking butt that he got for $17 at a yard sale, with a Predator Z2 shaft and Kamui soft tip.  We call that stick ""auto aim""...but really we're just talking about the shaft."

billiards,38an9k,mmmjr16,3,Wed Jun 3 16:54:05 2015 UTC,"Yes yes and yes as far as I'm aware. Some are smaller. Some are lighter and some are magnetic. This answer could be wrong but I think different tables use different methods.   For example one table at a local bar has a larger cue ball. When all of the colors are pocketed and you drop the cue ball in a pocket, the table locks the cue ball into the table. Only way to get the cue out is to drop all the balls. But if there is still a color on the table then the cue ball won't get locked on a scratch."
billiards,38an9k,RedditPanhandler,2,Wed Jun 3 16:56:44 2015 UTC,I believe that Diamond tables actually use an optical sensing method to identify the cue ball and reroute it.

billiards,38an9k,RumGor,2,Wed Jun 3 20:14:53 2015 UTC,"there are three methods  One is a magnetic shunt rail. the ball gets pulled towards a magnet as it exits the table and is then detoured to the end of the table.  there is also a rare method, where the cue ball is slightly heavier and the other balls and trips a sensor that shuttles it on it's own rail  and then there is the pretty common system that uses a slightly larger cue ball, that fits on a wider shunt rail to separate it."

The measurements are probably from edge to edge, so the playing surface is likely 46"" x 92"", or an ""oversized 8"" size table.  That's a good thing in my book as long as you have room for it.

billiards,38a26w,sfc949,6,Tue Jun 2 21:30:46 2015 UTC,Note that there's a difference between BCA and BCAPL on this topic.
billiards,38a26w,DetroitLarry,6,Wed Jun 3 12:19:17 2015 UTC,"I wanted to make the same point as /u/detroitlarry. People who say they play in a BCA league most likely mean that they play in a BCAPL (aka CueSports International) sanctioned league.   BCA is mostly a trade organization these days and aren't in the business of pool leagues.   Their published rule set is a replica of the WPA standardized rules.   With regards the question in hand, the WPA rules give ball in hand behind the head string. The BCAPL/CSI rules give ball in hand anywhere on the table."
billiards,38a26w,petermgates,2,Wed Jun 3 17:42:44 2015 UTC,"This is 100% correct.  I'd just like to say that I like the BCAPL/CSI rules just for simplicity sake.  When explaining the rules its so much easier to just say ""ball in hand anywhere on table for ALL fouls"" rather than have to explain that there is a different rule for the break, especially when most players I'm having to explain this too are already unfamiliar with competitive rules in the first place."

billiards,38a26w,mattdebrown,0,Tue Jun 2 21:48:03 2015 UTC,I don't think that's right. I didn't follow your link but a scrath on the break is a BIH foul
billiards,38a26w,ArrogantMoose,2,Tue Jun 2 23:01:59 2015 UTC,"The link goes to BCA's website and is for the WPBA 8 ball rulebook which states:  3.3 Break Shot The following rules apply to the break shot: (a) The cue ball begins in hand behind the head string. (b) No ball is called, and the cue ball is not required to hit any particular object ball first. (c) If the breaker pockets a ball and does not foul, he continues at the table, and the table remains open. (See 3.4 Open Table / Choosing Groups.) (d) If no object ball is pocketed, at least four object balls must be driven to one or more rails, or the shot results in an illegal break, and the incoming player has the option of (1) accepting the table in position, or (2) re-racking and breaking, or (3) re-racking and allowing the offending player to break again. Version 21/12/2007 – The Rules of Play Page 1 of 3 ￼Version 21.12.2007 (e) Pocketing the eight ball on a legal break shot is not a foul. If the eight ball is pocketed, the breaker has the option of (1) re-spotting the eight ball and accepting the balls in position, or (2) re-breaking. (f) If the breaker pockets the eight ball and scratches (see definition 8.6 Scratch), the opponent has the option of (1) re-spotting the eight ball and shooting with cue ball in hand behind the head string; or (2) re-breaking. (g) If any object ball is driven off the table on a break shot, it is a foul; such balls remain out of play (except the eight ball which is re-spotted); and the incoming player has the option of (1) accepting the table in position, or (2) taking cue ball in hand behind the head string. (h) If the breaker fouls in any manner not listed above, the following player has the option of (1) accepting the balls in position, or (2) taking cue ball in hand behind the head string.  I always thought that BCA was BIH on a scratch off the break too, but this clearly indicates that it's not."

From the BCA rule book:  Section 2-3   If you foul on a legal break and do not pocket the 8-ball, your inning ends and any other pocketed balls remain pocketed. Your opponent receives ball in hand.   That was a direct quote by the way."

billiards,386f0g,Humpin_Toad,3,Tue Jun 2 04:31:50 2015 UTC,He sponsors a ton of the Filipnos and has a following with them. Up until recently he also sponsored Skylar Woodward too. He seems to make a lot of cues a year. The one guy on my team loves his but it's more of a plain jane. They don't hold value as well as they could because of the amount of production. I'd try and hit with one before buying one in that price range. If your thought is that you are getting it for cheap to try and flip it for more I'd be careful. As a person I've always thought he's a decent guy.
billiards,386f0g,fadedcheese,2,Tue Jun 2 14:41:14 2015 UTC,"Diveney makes a solid playing cue. Some look pretty sporty. /u/fadedcheese basically gave you all the information you need. If you buy it, buy it as a player and not an investment."

He is in some of the facebook groups for builders that I belong to, and he is a very friendly and helpful guy. I don't know him personally, and have only had a few brief chats with him in these groups, but I'd be confident in making an investment in any of his cues."
billiards,386f0g,gabrielleigh,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:08:09 2015 UTC,"He makes a great cue, but I don't think he's reached that investment status quite yet. He produces alot of cues and I think he's become known more for playability than collectability.   He does have some beautiful cues but from what I understand he's buying blanks not splicing the wood himself. If that's true it would help explain why his cues don't hold their value as well as others in that price range.  It's a tough call to make without having an opportunity to see the cue in person and hit a few balls. I personally wouldn't do it unless I really really really liked the cue. But for 3k I'm probably looking at somebody other than diveney."
billiards,386f0g,ceezaleez,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:13:21 2015 UTC,"His cues are quite well regarded, but 3K is a whole lot of money. To put it in perspective, that amount of cash will buy you pretty much any players cue you could possibly want, with maybe the exception of something super exotic like a Searing, Gus, etc.   If you absolutely love the cue, go for it,but if you're trying to make a buck, there are far better options."

Hes wanting to either sell it or trade it for a lower end Schick I have.

billiards,384o5t,fastereddiefelson,5,Tue Jun 2 00:23:59 2015 UTC,"It's not the pockets that make a difference, it's the cloth. It's much lighter and faster(less friction) it's the same idea with silicon. He's saying that the low friction makes it easier, and lowering it more would make it even easier. But also it's mentioning that even on the lighter cloth, that's very hard to do and still impressive."
billiards,384o5t,joeprentice90,2,Tue Jun 2 01:11:08 2015 UTC,Billiard tables tend to have heated slate that helps balls hold English better as well as super fast cloth.  Silicon oil on the ball just reduces friction even further.

billiards,385nv7,ToastyD,3,Tue Jun 2 00:57:55 2015 UTC,"You'll ideally want it to be a slate table with fairly new cloth and rails. If it's possible, you should try to play a few games on it first, I bought a table that already has a dead rail on it and I couldn't stand playing until I replaced the rails. Cloth can be a big issue too. If you only play on simonis 860 or 760, and end up with some cheap cloth that seems to stop all ball movement, it will ruin playing at home for you. You'll also want to be sure that you can disassemble and reassemble the table yourself, some are extremely complicated, while others are really fast and easy. You'll need somebody to help you with the move also, they're HEAVY! If it's in your budget, I think it's really worth it to pay a pro to move it and install it. They'll level it, restretch the cloth, and if they're any good, they'll give you a guarantee on their work in case anything goes wrong that's caused by them."
billiards,385nv7,joeprentice90,2,Tue Jun 2 02:44:53 2015 UTC,"If it is a 9 foot table (or even an 8 foot), unless you can park your truck right next to the table or you have a slate dolly, 2 people isn't going to cut it if you want to be safe. Slates for a 9 foot table weigh 80kg per piece (there are 3 pieces) and will put strain mainly on your hands/fingers when carrying them so it is not so simple as lifting 40kg per side. Generally speaking, you should have 4 reasonably strong people for moving the slates, especially if tight doorways or stairwells are involved."
billiards,385nv7,gotwired,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:28:33 2015 UTC,"You're right, I should've said a few friends instead of somebody. I was assuming they'd be using a dolly, I forgot how many people just power through it and do it without tools. Thanks for pointing that out."
billiards,385nv7,joeprentice90,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:07:30 2015 UTC,"I moved my 8' table (1"" slates, about 200lbs each) with only one other person.  When I disassembled the table, my 5' tall, 110lb wife and I carried the slates out and stacked them in the bed of the truck.  We just went straight out the garage to the truck maybe 20 feet but she handled it like a trooper.  When I got it to my house, I had a buddy come over and he and I carried each piece from my garage around the house to the basement.  The third slate felt really fucking heavy after carrying the first two but we got it done with no issues.  I should also mention that I'm a 6', 180lb guy who works in IT and doesn't work out for shit.  Not a strongman by any means, but I do know how to lift properly.  Always keep a straight back and do not twist while carrying anything heavy.  Obviously, the slates would have been easier to carry with another person helping, but it is always awkward when 3 or more people are trying to negotiate furniture in tight spaces like hallways and staircases.  At least that's my experience.  Best to err on the side of caution though I suppose, so if you feel like you need another person or two, by all means do it.  It's gotta be safer that way.  I've seen guys heave 1"" slate sections for 9 foot tables completely by themselves.  These guys were no-necked animals though and it made my back hurt just watching it happen."
billiards,385nv7,fadedcheese,2,Thu Jun 4 12:05:58 2015 UTC,"When I did tables we only ever used two guys. It's more about knowing how to carry them. Vertical, with you holding the smoother pocket area with the weight bearing hand using the other hand to keep the slate balanced.  Going down stairs let the stronger guy go down backwards and taking most of the weight with his shoulder. Sucks for the center slate because it's got the sharp edges. Wearing gloves is not always a good idea because they can slip off. Having to replace a slate can cost almost as much as the used table you bought. A third guy going down steps, especially tight ones, can just get in the way."
billiards,385nv7,fadedcheese,2,Thu Jun 4 13:34:45 2015 UTC,"Like a bunch of others you can always just post the CL ad and pictures here and either let us tear it apart or give you our ok. But age, the price they paid for it, why they are selling it are some starters. Then check that the rails are lively, how much wear the table has, what other equipment comes with it and make sure it's slate."

Im from ny (long island) myself and they make me cringe sometimes.  Im hoping that the show brings a few veteran players out of the shadows and back into the local tournaments.  It gets a little dull playing the same faces every week.  It may also inspire a few more players to gamble.  It makes me wanna hit the tables more and practice to get my game up and go play there at steinway or amsterdam billiards to see what i really got  I think the show will be good for the game.  Get some awareness, which is never a bad thing.  And inform some people who play in bars what the REAL RULES are.  I rarely play in bars anymore because everyone seems to Play by a different set of rules or they seem to make em up as they go along."

Three movies about gambling that raised their sport after their release.    With that being said I doubt this is going to have an impact like any of those movies, but it in itself isn't a negative thing.  The show isn't going to hurt pool and thus neutral or positive are really the only ways to look at it, to me.  It's a reality show, it's all trash.  I've only seen a few minutes but it seems like all the rest of the reality shows, just a background I happen to be in to.

Having a cue with an excessive amount of ivory isn't really all that practical, because it draws way too much attention. Carrying something like this around on a daily basis to shoot with would be a bad idea. Besides the normal wear and tear that would decrease the value, this thing stands out so much that it would make it a big target for theft or robbery. I mean, if Johnny Archer can get robbed at gunpoint in broad daylight of his cue and cash, I wouldn't have a chance of carrying this for long without being robbed."

I have no idea on the ferrule's, though. I don't want any ivory up there, personally. I don't much want a buttcap made of it either, as those places just tend to crack over time, even if you don't play the cue (which I do, but mostly at home)."

billiards,37pr0h,carter1984,1 point,Fri May 29 22:23:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my problem with that is ivory is the least offensive endangered species involved in a violin bow, and they're over a hundred years old so paperwork simply doesn't and can't exist at this point. The CITES system they've setup is simply a joke. It's literally impossible to comply with the law. I have quite a list of things I just won't travel with (at least not across an international border)."
billiards,37pr0h,ceezaleez,1 point,Fri May 29 22:48:45 2015 UTC,"All this ivory is 100% legal, and these cues all come with the paperwork to prove it. The only time the law on ivory comes into effect on these cues is when they are being sold, and honestly, the one cue is is in such a class by itself that its unlikely to be sold anytime soon.   Plus a little history lesson ;). The basis for plastics was actually invented by a guy who was trying to win a contest for $10k to find a better material for billiard balls than the so called ""mud balls"" that were the most popular. These were the least expensive type of billiard ball to craft, but the clay they were made of didn't last too long.   Of course there were quite a few ivory sets in circulation, but they were largely impractical, as ivory is not well suited for the high impacts that billiard balls regularly go through. Also, it was very difficult to craft a set of 16 balls that were the exact same size that roll true. Any small variation in the size of the balls would become very noticeable very quickly when you attempted to rack.  I actually have a friend who has an ivory cue ball from the early 1900s, and the grain of the ivory makes it have an ""eye"" (for lack of a better term) on two sides, much like a north and south pole. If it hits these while rolling it seems to make a small jump. This is not good for precision shots as you can imagine."

billiards,37onyl,PM_ME_UR_MATHPROBLEM,6,Fri May 29 04:47:13 2015 UTC,"Ok I'm very very certain that this is not a knock off or a ""low quality"" ball.   This is an Aramith Tournament Magnetic Cue Ball, and they're intentionally made over an old worn down object ball because the magnetic coat is able to spread evenly over an old object ball providing a better, more true roll. I'm guessing the way they coated previous magnetic cue balls (the red dot) provided an uneven coat which led to an uneven roll and a heavier cue ball.  Keep in mind this cue ball isn't marketed as a high end cue ball. It's just marketed as a better magnetic cue ball than many of the plain-jane magnetic cue balls that can't draw for shit and are heavy as a rock.   While we're on the topic, Aramith recently released their newer generation magnetic cue ball which is made with their new Duramith technology as seen here. I have yet to play with this one but I'm sure it plays better than the green logo aramith magnetic cue ball."
billiards,37onyl,sfc949,2,Fri May 29 11:10:24 2015 UTC,"Wait the slightly heavier bar cue balls roll bad?  Is it not my fault that i can't draw at all at this one bar?    My draw is not so consistent anyway, but i feel lucky to perform a half table stun shot on this table.  It would be great to find out it's the equipments fault for once."
billiards,37onyl,grlldcheese87,1 point,Fri May 29 18:50:22 2015 UTC,"Yes.  That's a possibility.  Bar tables have to differentiate the cue-ball from the object-balls in one way or another.  The most common methods are by weight, size, or magnetism.  The most-preferred method is a magnetic cue-ball, because it won't change the game performance in any noticeable way.  A larger cue ball will cause all aiming and angles to perform different, and a heavier (or lighter, though I've never heard of that) cue ball will cause English to be more (less?) effective."
billiards,37onyl,elint,1 point,Sat May 30 08:55:54 2015 UTC,"Actually the most preferred way is what Diamond does by using a laser to ""read"" the ball and send it the proper way. This way you can play with balls of all the same size weight and construction method. It's only draw back is that sometimes it sends the 1 or 5 ball as the cue ball. Mostly seems to happen when the battery is getting low.  A magnetic ball like the one pictured doesn't transfer energy to the next ball in the same fashion because it has different layers of materials to pass through. Hence why these balls can be referred to as ""mud balls"" because they seem to lose some energy compared to a totally solid ball like a red circle."
billiards,37onyl,fadedcheese,1 point,Sat May 30 17:24:33 2015 UTC,"Could also be a lower quality cloth or just poorly maintained felt. Even different humidity levels could effect it. Knowing where you live, if it's more on the rainy side of the island compared to your other place that could also be a factor."
billiards,37onyl,fadedcheese,2,Sat May 30 17:32:14 2015 UTC,"This ball has the magnetic material spread evenly throughout the entire ball to give it the truest roll and maximum performance.   That's quoted straight from the link you provided. That picture shows a cheap acrylic covering sprayed over an old ball with an Aramith logo on the side. Theres no way thats a magnetic coating evenly distributed throughout the ball. Thats why I said its a cheap knock off designed for a bar box.  Plus, stop and think about Aramith as a company for a second. They are considered THE name in billiard balls. There's not really anyone putting out quality products on their level. Now, do you really think a company with that kind of reputation would put out a ball as shitty as the one in the picture?"
billiards,37onyl,Humpin_Toad,7,Fri May 29 11:40:58 2015 UTC,"Actually, he is mostly correct. It is a genuine Aramith ball. The core, however, is not a used ball, but a newly made ball that didn't meet factory specifications, so it was ground down and repurposed into a magnetic barbox ball. How else do you think they obtain the ""pure phenolic cores"" that they advertise for this line of cue balls?  This has been documented quite a few times on AZB in the past and doesn't really affect anything besides people thinking Aramith has been cutting corners."
billiards,37onyl,gotwired,5,Fri May 29 13:48:45 2015 UTC,"This is how they make those magnetic ones. You can see the black layer which is the ""even magnetic coating"". They have to use something as a core so they used turned down balls that didn't meet their standards to be in a set."

billiards,37onyl,squid06,5,Fri May 29 13:32:55 2015 UTC,"Low quality knock off. I'm guessing this was on a bar box, which uses a bigger cue ball than the object balls. This is how the table returns the cue when you scratch. Some companies take older balls and recover them in acrylic and brand them as higher end and resell them. It's sometimes hard to tell just by looking at them. You'd have to measure them to know, and the difference is very minor."

billiards,37o1x6,gotwired,3,Fri May 29 16:10:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you are only going to be there for a year and a half, you should probably just wait until you move to a place with enough room for a 9 foot gold crown. Putting in a pool table is a big undertaking (or an expensive one if you pay someone to do it) and moving a pool table is even harder. If you have to settle for an 8 footer, you should really consider whether having that table for a year and a half provides any advantages over just going to the pool hall and practicing especially considering playing at home is not nearly as fulfilling as going out and finding competition."
billiards,37o1x6,fadedcheese,2,Sat May 30 00:33:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Trying to shoehorn a table in that size room will be frustrating. The room size you listed will have you using a smaller cue for rail shots even on an eight footer. If you already know you are going to be moving in a year or so I would just save the money towards a better 9 foot till then. Waiting sucks and I did it for over a decade untill I finally had the space for a proper table. Although it sucked at the time, now I'm glad I did and have the table I truly want.

Otherwise it's open table to your opponent.   Of course if you're in a bar, anything goes because people tend to make this shit up as they go along."
billiards,37ov1g,petermgates,2,Fri May 29 09:31:08 2015 UTC,"After the break, If a ball drops, you have the option to sink another ball of the same suit, or shoot a ball of another suit for better positioning. If you break and sink a ball, the table is open until a determined ball is potted. If you scratch attempting this shot, the table is still open and your opponent can choose another shot made from the kitchen. For the record, ball in hand is something typically reserved for tournaments and league play."

billiards,37m3py,jlbartle,3,Thu May 28 22:07:21 2015 UTC,"Some divisions count 1pt per ball and 3 pts for the 8. Some divisions are W/L.  From what I've gathered BCA divisions are pretty much only to get people qualified for bca/csi tournaments, and the point system helps broaden the field for prospective players."
billiards,37m3py,ArrogantMoose,2,Thu May 28 22:20:53 2015 UTC,Thanks. So like bca with a handicap?
billiards,37m3py,jlbartle,3,Thu May 28 22:35:26 2015 UTC,The winner of the game will get 10 points for the win.  If I made all my balls and did not win I would get 7 points (point for each ball).   This is the format with no handicap included.  Handicap points are added to the total at the end and have no effect on the individual games.
billiards,37m3py,jlbartle,2,Thu May 28 22:49:37 2015 UTC,So similar to vnea. Thanks and hello fellow schon owner!
billiards,37m3py,spectacular_coitus,2,Thu May 28 23:58:05 2015 UTC,I've heard of some leagues that also offers the winner points for every ball they managed to get their opponent to leave on the table.  So if you won the game you get 10 points. If your opponent left 5 balls on the table you'd get 5 more points and your opponent would only get 2 points for the balls they had down.   Final score would be 15:2

Had you not apologized, I would definitely lean more towards the you're an asshole opinion. But you did apologize. Hopefully the other team had the good nature to understand that people get angry and that in most of those situations the angry party will never apologize. You did. That makes you better than most for being able to admit fault and apologize. I've had people be sticklers on rules to me and I've had people, like you, who were more relaxed. You get both. Hopefully you'll appreciate the more relaxed teams more now (silver lining)."

They are a solid team that I'm pretty sure is headed to Vegas so I see how they've got to be up on their rules. Sadly we may be the chillest team in our league, but I don't think that's gonna change we play the game we love and we understand mistakes are made and we allow the other team to call themselves out on it, and we will always call ourselves out, but we just were reckless and forgot that other people are way more serious."
billiards,37lur6,Not2BeEftWith,5,Thu May 28 17:05:05 2015 UTC,"Here's the really unfortunate part about the whole thing- you didn't commit a foul.  The APA rule book specifically states that accidentally contacting a ball other than the cue ball (even by someone providing coaching) is NOT a foul.  The only time it's a foul is if you move the cue ball when it's not ball in hand.    Keep cool, know the rules, and have fun."
billiards,37lur6,williedills,3,Thu May 28 23:48:59 2015 UTC,Correct. It's only a foul if it's the cue ball or the hand holding the cue ball that moves the ball.

I cut the 9 in and the cue ball was slowly rolling toward the middle of the table (no chance of scratching anywhere) and I swept it over to the kitchen with my cue. While I agree that I was technically breaking the rules, I also think my opponent was a petty chump who would rather win on a technicality than off of skill. I compare people like that to a cop that sits at a stop sign and writes tickets to people who don't come to a complete stop for 5 seconds. Your technically right, but your still a loser."

billiards,37lur6,mattkenefick,5,Fri May 29 05:56:07 2015 UTC,The APA is stupid.. but you touched a ball that you shouldn't have and those are the rules.  They'd probably call you on not marking an obvious 8 ball pocket too and call it a loss... but that's the APA for you. It's a stupid league.
billiards,37lur6,dalgeek,1 point,Thu May 28 16:00:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about the APA I'm not sure what other options there are for pool leagues in center city Philadelphia though.

I guess I am just looking for sympathy/empathy about losing my temper, and wondering how other people have lost their cool during a match."

billiards,37lur6,used_to_be_somebody,2,Fri May 29 03:30:59 2015 UTC,Skip the leagues and just play players and join tournaments. Leagues are too much of an obligation anyway.
billiards,37lur6,kbergstr,4,Thu May 28 22:04:21 2015 UTC,"Leagues are a good learning environment. You will not receive as much coaching or advice playing random tournaments, especially if you are a new player."
billiards,37lur6,khoker,1 point,Thu May 28 22:38:30 2015 UTC,"Marking the 8 ball is not required if both players agree to call the pocket, but it is much safer to mark it, especially in a tournament situation. When I play against higher level players and in masters I normally just call the pocket. If it's someone I don't know or I'm playing a higher level tournament then I always mark the pocket."
billiards,37lur6,You_Poop_I_Scoop,5,Thu May 28 22:36:49 2015 UTC,"My take is that you can't be upset for someone enforcing the rules you've agreed to play by.      So you wouldn't call this foul on another team.  That's cool.  But would you call a foul on them for picking up the cue ball when they, mistakenly, thought they had ball in hand?  Would you call a foul if they accidentally touched the cue ball while lining up for a shot?  Both of those fouls are of the same severity as your foul...  You've created a situation where you changed the table -- even though you think it is easy to ""fix"" it.  What if the balls were locked and you didn't put them back in the right way.  What if you've otherwise affected the table to your advantage?"
billiards,37lur6,warmcereal,1 point,Thu May 28 16:07:45 2015 UTC,"It's happened before and yeah we are that chill that we would not have called it if it wasn't intentional. My team plays in league because we love the game,  we like to drink, and we love shooting pool as a team."

billiards,37lur6,oubeav,2,Thu May 28 19:33:44 2015 UTC,Those fouls are a bit more obvious. I didn't change the table and if it was perceived that I did it would have been by a mm. I don't disagree that it was a foul it's just a Foul that my team whole heartedly would never call on another team. Especially since we were all unaware. I'm down with most of the rules in APA but let's face it that rule book is thick and for a reason in order to settle these things. Let's just say we made our goal as a team to shoot pool and have fun. Not to be referees. That's why I've got you guys to teach me. I'm learning something new every time I play. Although I got pissed I definitely learned a lesson.

That's even more fun, but this is APA not some big million dollar event. Just remember to keep it in perspective, and you'll have a good time."
billiards,37lur6,oubeav,2,Thu May 28 21:43:52 2015 UTC,"The APA seems designed to try and resolve bar arguments.  That's why you don't have to even call a pocket.  Hit your ball first and see if something goes in!  But even then you can't allow certain things.  You don't want situational rules being applied haphazardly.  Concentration and control is a part of the game, even if you are coaching."

billiards,37lur6,oubeav,2,Fri May 29 03:33:23 2015 UTC,"The cue is always live. I believe this is also a foul in BCA for BIH, if you change the path of any ball while holding the cue with the same hand. Correct me if I'm wrong though.  Honestly, it depends a lot on who I'm playing. If I make that mistake, I always give it up, bc that's the rule. But I have played friends, and told them when they make that mistake, just return the object ball and keep BIH.  I have been upset in league one or two times by calling someone to watch a shot for a good hit or check a frozen ball and they make a wrong call... But that's the chance you take when you have someone watch a hit so I get over it."

billiards,37lur6,Durtyjoey,1 point,Thu May 28 17:21:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely a life lesson. Anger is natural. It's important to own up to your emotions. Suppressing it seemed impossible, but after expressing it and apologizing later I felt much better. I seriously get angry less than 5 times a year so it was a very strange feeling, but what I learned is that speaking your mind is important and it helped me to get past the anger apologize and see the matter in a new light."
billiards,37lur6,sirbodanglelot,2,Thu May 28 17:58:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  That little rule can burn you.  I'll never forget a foul someone called on me also during an APA game.  I had ball in hand, placed the cue ball where I wanted, leaned in for the shot but decided to move the cue ball just a bit more...with my cue stick.  Now, the dude called a foul because he claimed I used/touched the cueball with the ferrule which is apparently a foul.  It was such a bullshit call, I lost my temper.  I think we ended up determining it was truly a foul on my part.  I honestly don't remember to this day if I truly touched the ferrule to the cue ball because it all happened so briefly."
billiards,37lur6,LiGht_UrpLe,2,Thu May 28 18:30:27 2015 UTC,IIRC that was actually legal. It's only a foul if the tip touches the cue ball. I'm almost certain the ferrule isn't considered part of the tip.
billiards,37lur6,dalgeek,2,Thu May 28 19:15:08 2015 UTC,That was our argument!  Just the tip matters. Their argument was:  ferrule = tip. I'm in the VNEA now.

Yes it's the rule and yes they get ball in hand if they feel like they want to enforce it, but it's also petty to enforce a rule like that. Just like forgetting to mark the 8 ball on a straight in shot. Winning because of technicalities is not how I want to win. If the other team played well, they should get it even if they forgot a tiny rule."
billiards,37lur6,agntkay,2,Thu May 28 18:14:29 2015 UTC,"A cue ball foul is not a technicality, and that situation would be a foul in any league. Moving any other ball is not a foul but if you touch the cue ball it is."

billiards,37jkvh,gabrielleigh,2,Thu May 28 15:14:21 2015 UTC,"If you want a better presentation of the same ideas on kicking that Jimmy tought, buy Tor Lowry's video. The number system and method for kicking to the corner pocket when learning are identical (and some say plagiarized).  The video you linked to is a special case, almost trick shot that comes out of the system. If you shot the cue ball along the line from the first diamond on the long rail into the middle diamond on the short rail with a half tip or so of running english, you should hit the 6th diamond on the long rail.  I would delete this particular video from your memory as it's not that useful. Learning the reference lines for two and three rail kicks however is invaluable."
billiards,37jkvh,petermgates,1 point,Thu May 28 18:52:32 2015 UTC,"I watched the first half of that and my first impression was that, whatever the system, it doesn't appear to be terribly accurate."
billiards,37jkvh,khoker,3,Thu May 28 03:01:44 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty simple system. Aim your kick to scratch in the corner and put maximum running english and you'll hit the sixth diamond.  Problem is, it's too much for too little payoff. Table conditions are going to cause this to vary far too much and it's not even a shot you're going to see all that often. You can't use the system for a bank instead of a kick, because there's no way you'll get that much english on an object ball.  To me, the hallmark of a quality kick/bank system is that it works both ways. Natural rolling english or don't bother using the system. Otherwise, you can't adjust for table conditions or shots that are slightly outside the scope of the system."

Some people prefer a single piece of slate because you don't have to worry about the ""seams"", but that's relatively minor.  For me, slate comes into play if you want to move a table.  Or get it around a corner.     2-3 people can move a 3-piece slate table once it is disassembled.  But a single piece of slate?  Forget about it.  You better be buying beer and pizza for 5 or 6 of your closest friends.     For my basement I actually HAD to find a 3-piece slate table because I couldn't make a turn down the stairs with single piece of slate.  That basically meant I had to go with at least an 8' sized table, because 3pc slate is more uncommon in 7' tables."

billiards,37fty1,Pip_Pip,3,Wed May 27 09:15:05 2015 UTC,So I understand why they would be regulating the rack itself.  Purposefully leaving gaps and all that definitely detracts from the game itself.  However I am a bit confused as to why they are limiting players with a break box.
billiards,37fty1,Bagelstein,2,Wed May 27 15:55:13 2015 UTC,It's meant to reduce the chance of consistently making a ball on the break.
billiards,37fty1,petermgates,2,Wed May 27 19:22:46 2015 UTC,"So I may have been racking 9 ball wrong for a long time then.  Granted I don't play a ton of 9 ball.  I've always basically went in sequence with the 9 in the middle so the 1, 2, 3 were the front 3 balls and 6, 7, 8 were the back 3.  His rack has the 1 at the front and the 2 at the back, which actually makes way more sense than my rack."
billiards,37fty1,bald_and_nerdy,3,Wed May 27 12:56:36 2015 UTC,"I used to think it went in sequence as well.  When I bought a table, I started looking into each of the games, as everyone I asked told me something different.  It appears the official WPA 9-ball rules state:   ...the one ball at the apex of the diamond and on the foot spot and the nine ball in the middle of the diamond. The other balls will be placed in the diamond without purposeful or intentional pattern.   Emphasis mine.  Source: http://www.wpa-pool.com/web/index.asp?id=117&pagetype=rules"
billiards,37fty1,free_range_human,3,Wed May 27 13:54:37 2015 UTC,"Interesting, so it's literally 1 in the front, 9 in the middle and nothing else matters as long as you don't always rack in the same order.

billiards,37fty1,bald_and_nerdy,2,Wed May 27 14:29:41 2015 UTC,"General rule of thumb is:  9 ball: 9 in the middle, 1 in the front, the rest don't matter.  8 ball: 8 in the middle, solid in back corner, stripe in back corner, the rest don't matter.

He is spot on in his claim that there are ""rack mechanics"" who exploit the loopholes in the old racking rules.   Now if people start figuring out how to consistently pocket a ball, hold the cue ball, and achieve a predictable shape shot on the lowest ball on the table... I have to support those people who develop a perfectly legal strategy based on consistency, predictability, and speed control. Given the improvements (theoretically, anyways) in rack consistency if everyone uses this system, I hope the focus of attention shifts to those people who put in the time and effort to develop a strategic break that gives them an advantage based on a well-thought and much-practiced technique instead of an exploit of racking rules. Make people pay their dues and develop strategies based on skill."

billiards,37fty1,amshaffer,1 point,Wed May 27 16:22:14 2015 UTC,"No movement on the 9, cue ball scratches.  Ouch.    Really though. He explains how the rack is bad because you can leave gaps in balls, but right before, he talks about how you can easily rack the template crooked to get a gap in the back.  I'm not a fan of the template. I like the idea of it, and it does tighten them up well, but I'd rather just use a rack. It's a small piece of plastic on the table sure, but I have a hard time believing it doesn't cause interference on the break in some cases; as subtly as it may be. And the balls roll over the template itself of it, which is not felt/slate  Tip for people using a rack... rack it up as you normally would, then let it sit for 5-10 seconds with the rack still on it and don't touch it... then pull the rack off. The time spent waiting lets the balls subtly sink into the felt just enough so they can maintain their positions when removing the rack."

Not legally, and frankly, even if I did know a way I wouldn't share it.  These videos are great quality and content.  Supporting the TAR team financially is how they will be able to create more of them.  IMO the prices for these are pretty reasonable too.

billiards,37g2i9,ceezaleez,1 point,Wed May 27 16:13:20 2015 UTC,i love pool and i know the dilemma it has with not being as big a sport as it should and the lack of money the sports has.   But there's hundreds of free matches to watch on Youtube. Efren vs Sigel for $200k is even on YouTube. I don't ever see me paying for any match. Especially a PPV.
billiards,37g2i9,fadedcheese,1 point,Thu May 28 03:18:54 2015 UTC,"You are right, but unfortunately very few of those videos put any tangible money in any pool players pockets. There are great old videos on youtube, but without new content the sport doesn't progress.   One drawback to the PPV model is that it won't attract new people to the game, however with Pool now on cable TV, I think we can find a balance that will serve the average bar player, casual enthusiast, along with the hardcore fans who are willing to pay to watch big action.  I think free tournament streams and videos can fill the free youtube niche, but when it comes to big action, I think it's unfair to expect to enjoy the fruits of other peoples labor without contributing to the cause.  The TAR guys put together a great product. I don't think they've had anything new come out for awhile though.  edit: I'm not sure if they are done or not, i didn't want to give the impression they were if they aren't so i changed a bunch of words"
billiards,37g2i9,ceezaleez,2,Thu May 28 06:23:56 2015 UTC,They aren't doing anymore TAR matches last I heard. They were still helping with streaming some stuff. Justin announced it I think in the last Shane vs Efren match.

I watch tournaments pretty religiously and never seen a TAR tournament before and was very curious. Kinda wanted to wet my beak before i dropped any money on it.

billiards,37ep79,Leehblanc,1 point,Wed May 27 12:19:46 2015 UTC,Diamonds are really nice tables.  You buying this one?
billiards,37f626,scratchinmadman,3,Wed May 27 04:25:25 2015 UTC,"If you have a billiards store in your town, try some cues out.  Wrap is purely preference.  I like the feel of a linen wrap, but have a good friend who absolutely has to play with no wrap.  He just doesn't like the feel of a linen wrap.  Again, trying some cues out will go a long way to figure out what you want.  As for shaft diameter, 12.75mm to 13mm is ""standard"", and most likely what you're playing with if you're just using bar cues.  Honestly, I'd go with 12.5mm, as that seems like the smallest they offer.  I don't know what your skill-level is, but I prefer a pretty thin cue -- I'm currently using a 11.75mm shaft.  Smaller shafts are less forgiving, but can provide better english and better accuracy.  Don't sweat this choice too much, though -- you can always buy new shafts for your cue.  I've been playing with the same butt for 13 years now and I'm on my 4th shaft."
billiards,37f626,elint,2,Wed May 27 04:57:42 2015 UTC,"For your first decent cue I definitely recommend a 13 mm. Just so you can dial in your stroke and really get the most out of it. Later on, you could move to a thinner shaft. Have you ever shot with a joss before? I personally love the hit, but everyone is different. Elint is right about the English the thinner shaft provides, but for you, I think a 13 mm would be best. And as for weight, for me, it doesn't matter, because while learning the game I always played with different weight cues. But mine now are 18-19. Wraps are totally up to you as well. Anyway let us now what you get, and post pics! Good luck"
billiards,37f626,The_shady_burrito,1 point,Wed May 27 19:11:43 2015 UTC,What would be the advantage to the 13 over a 12.5 in terms of dialing in my stroke?
billiards,37f626,IFVoltaire,2,Wed May 27 22:55:25 2015 UTC,"Elint ^ was right about almost everything but one, a small shaft does not equate to more accuracy. It's actually the opposite. The smaller the tip size, the smaller surface area you can hit on the cue ball meaning more spin. But, it also means that your stroke must be really good to hit the exact point on the cue ball. If your stroke is slightly off, it will change the angle/path of the cue ball. If i were to push someone with my hand i can choose in what direction they go since i can push them in a certain part of their body. If I were to hit that person with a car, they would only go in one direction, the path the car is taking. I know this example is kind of difficult to understand but it's the way i try and talk about surface area. Sorry if you dont understand it lol"
billiards,37f626,IFVoltaire,2,Thu May 28 00:16:18 2015 UTC,As someone still relatively new to the game but who is really serious about playing and improving what size diameter do you recommend-I'm sort of leaning towards a 12.5 or 12.75
billiards,37f626,fadedcheese,1 point,Thu May 28 03:07:18 2015 UTC,Honestly it doesnt really matter what size tip you use. I grew up playing snooker which most snooker cue tip sizes are 8-10 mm. And I learned to play without a problem. You could even buy a cue with an 11.5 millimeter tip size and not have a problem as long as you practice the basics enough to not miscue or put accidental side spin on the cue ball.
billiards,37f626,bullitt_60,2,Thu May 28 09:02:50 2015 UTC,Sounds good I'll probably go for the 12.75 then as I continue to work on my stroke.
billiards,37f626,butterbaste,1 point,Thu May 28 09:31:33 2015 UTC,"That's a good size I've played for a long time and I like the 12.65-12.8mm range. Keep in mind, you can always have a good cuesmith turn down a shaft but it's impossible for them to make it bigger."
billiards,37f626,Durtyjoey,2,Sat May 30 17:48:14 2015 UTC,"My first cue was a Joss and you'll have to pry it from my cold, dead hands.  You'll be happy with 19-20oz, 12.5-13mm."
billiards,37f626,Pilfered,1 point,Thu May 28 02:26:58 2015 UTC,"I think a 19oz Joss is a great starter cue. As mentioned by u/elint the best thing you can do is go to a local store or pool hall that sells cues and try some out. Most of my friends prefer a linen wrap but I am one of those people that needs an unwrapped cue, just a matter of preference. Don't worry too much about diameter, just hit stuff and get a cue you like the look and feel of."

I watched him and Jayson spend a lot of time making each other re-do their racks because of the deliberate spaces around the 9.

billiards,37e7mw,mattdebrown,1 point,Wed May 27 04:00:19 2015 UTC,"I googled another article to figure out what this was all about. It seemed to imply they wanted to create less 9 on the breaks and stop people winning matches with what is in a sense luck.  That some players were even calling to nullify the ""9on the break"" wins altogether. Though isn't this why 10 ball was invented? I say pros should play mainly ten ball and do a ""hand me down"" of 9 ball to us amateur / casual players. (who love the excitement of some dumb luck and unexpected slop)  I assume promoters presume people want to watch the pros play the game they play. And lots of casual players are unaware of 10 ball. But I think that's bogus logic. Watching pro pool requires effort to seek it out, so all the spectators know what's up either way."

I'm basing that only on personal experience (people I know that use them, forum posts, etc).  I haven't found any worthwhile direct comparisons, but the 314-2 and -3 are going to be somewhat similar.  If money is an issue, I'd recommend just going with the 314-2, especially now that the new one is out (right now you can find a lot of used 314-2s in great condition used for ~$150).  The 314-3 will have some newer technologies (http://www.predatorcues.com/technology/predator-shaft-technology/) but whether it's worth the bump in pay or not is a personal thing.

billiards,377mvc,IAccountForMyAccount,4,Mon May 25 15:26:29 2015 UTC,"You can definitely use your Dufferin break cue to play with. Often, cues set up as break cues have a thicker taper and a harder tip. You can either have the shaft turned down to a diameter you prefer to play with, or you can buy a different shaft all together. Either way works fine and your Duff butt will be great to play with. There is generally nothing different about the construction of butts used in break cues compared to playing cues. The differences are generally in the shaft taper and tip choice."
billiards,377mvc,gabrielleigh,3,Mon May 25 17:01:33 2015 UTC,"Sure... But it depends on the type of player you are. If you are the type of shooter who is never satisfied with the cue, shaft, case, tip, chalk, balls or table then you'll always doubt the effectiveness of your break - - > playing cue. But if you are the type of player who focuses on maximizing the ability and gear you have then your cue hardly matters. And you'll outplay folks with high end cues and it'll piss them off.   My advise, keep the break cue a break cue. You don't want to change shafts between breaks and your first shot. If you are looking for a new cue, take your time. Shop around, hit a with as many brands as you can. Mostly you want a cue that you don't have to think about.   Finally, for a given manufacturer, the hit on a low end cue is as good as a hit on a high end cue (McDermott is an exception). But a $300 Joss hits as well as a $900 Joss. The $900 cue is just more ornate. I think you are better off buying a low end cue from a high end manufacturer than a high end cue from a lower end manufacturer."

billiards,3744vc,redditor1983,5,Sun May 24 20:28:04 2015 UTC,"TL:DR of the article: A low level of alcohol (0.02 BAC) can relax and slow muscles, slightly improving accuracy. In addition, the mental effects of alcohol can help prevent anxiety caused by overthinking shots.  This coincides with my experience and I'm not surprised to see those results.   Pool is a highly mental game, and ""analysis paralysis"" happens to a lot of players, causing them to lose focus. I think the anxiety-reducing effect of alcohol is the primary benefit for most players.  I think it should be emphasized, however, that the article is talking about really low blood alcohol content (0.02) which is like maybe a beer or two for most people. Not drunk.  I've known some people who think they play best when completely drunk. That's obviously not the case, and in that situation I think they simply have selective memory (remembering that ""one great shot"" and forgetting a night full of pathetic ones)."
billiards,3744vc,redditor1983,4,Sun May 24 20:26:01 2015 UTC,I only drink on Fridays and it is my worst night of pool.  My theory is that alcohol makes you remember the one good shot you made and forget the five you completely fucked up.
billiards,3744vc,H4ppenSt4nce,3,Sun May 24 19:57:59 2015 UTC,"Confidence: You could play just as well and probably better without alcohol if you practiced sober long enough. As a pretty good pool player with a drinking problem i have played both sober and drunk many times and everything in between.  I believe it is simply a thing of confidence and being in the zone when your drinking your alot more relaxed. your breathing better. but there usaully is a tipping point with drinking and playing ...anything and the best players do not drink, anymore than a beer anyway...i have found over the years that when i have took a few months here and there to give drinking a break...that i never wanted to quit pool so i would redouble my efforts to improve my game sober in pool halls and bars and tournement...it is hard to get used to it at first and frustrating but once you get a little confidence with your shots you will start to get better faster. and when you are having fun and drinking you will be better for practicing sober"

Where I'm a little fuzzy and off my game until I have my first beer and have a high tolerance for the effects of the drug. I definitely shoot better after my first drink because I have a mental/nerve problem at the start of my matches.   Bottom line if you aren't a drinker, alcohol probably won't make you shoot better.

billiards,373oll,petester,13,Sun May 24 16:09:01 2015 UTC,"Having an extra cue just for break shots is purely a luxury, and most definitely not a requirement. If you primarily play games like one pocket or just prefer to break most games with a softer ""control"" break then there is no need at all to carry an extra cue for breaking. If you happen to prefer breaking with a lot of speed (and your cue is topped with a soft tip for lots of english), then breaking will likely increase the chance of tip mushrooming, dome flattening, and ferrule damage. Also, if you play with about any kind of laminated ""LD"" style shaft, you should avoid breaking with those shafts for sure. There is nothing wrong with having an extra shaft for breaking, although you will be stuck spending 20-30 seconds each game swapping shafts which could be irritating to both yourself and your opponents.   If you have the space in your cue case for an extra cue, pick up a cheap dedicated break cue and you'll take a bunch of wear and tear off your regular playing cue. There is a trade off in having one, though. The extra time and hassle of assembling the cue each time you play, plus the added weight you have to carry around in your case. If it seems worth the extra work, then go for it. It is purely a personal preference and nothing you absolutely must have.  Cue extenders are generally used as temporary extensions which allow people to reach shots where they have to lay across vast parts of the table to reach the cueball. Most people opt to use these very briefly to accommodate one long shot, then they promptly remove them and continue playing the rest of the game without the extension. They are much more common in big table games, but I know a handful of very short players who carry them and use them regularly in bar box games as well. When played on 9' tables, one pocket games put you in awkward positioning very often and the cue extenders are almost a necessity for some people. I have seen people use bridges on top of bridges, and an extension on their cue just to reach a shot in a money game. For the most part, I don't think it is too common for people to attach them to cues for use throughout the entire game. More of a specialized tool for a difficult shot."

I always break with whatever I am shooting with, but I also don't play with $400 cues.  Players has the Lucasi lifetime warranty, now, I believe, so this may be my last one for a while.  I had to pick up a mushroom cutter,  and I replace my tip every 6 months.  There will be a little squish in your tip if you break hard and often, but it isn't anything a little maintenance won't fix."

A friend of mine, who isn't as tall, has a 4"" extension that he screws into the middle of the cue. That might get you the length you want. Just make sure that the extension matches the joint of your cue."

Most house cues to me seem shorter than most personal cues so I would say go check out what they have at the store near you and find what is comfortable without looking at a very expensive 60""+ cue."

billiards,372dun,sleepwalken,7,Sun May 24 05:37:23 2015 UTC,"I get to see the insides of these shafts all the time when they come in for repair. From my own personal experiences, I agree with /u/elint and I feel like you get a better shaft with the OB and Jacoby products. Jacoby looks to me like they build the best laminated shaft on the market right now. They all feel similar to me, each one seems tuned to a slightly different stroke. From a technical perspective, the Predator products are all made in China and the woods and materials they use are of very poor quality. The maple they select to cut the pie splices is the lowest grade that doesn't have actual knots in it (usually). The grain runoff in their splices used to be pretty good back when they were made in the USA. Now they use bottom-shelf maple that would be completely unsuitable for shafts if left in traditional solid lumber form. Their ferrules are cheap plastic and not much thicker than a credit card and they use a hollow wooden tenon that is extremely fragile and prone to breakage. The quality of woods I see in the OB and Jacoby Edge products are much higher and my personal opinion is that they take much more pride in selecting good materials for their products.   Keep in mind this is just my personal opinions which are based on my experiences of doing major surgery on these products several times a week. I am no mechanical engineer or anything fancy like that, but I do triage on these things all the time and I know them inside and out."

Been looking at new cue and getting either a g-core or players HXT skinny shaft."
billiards,372dun,randomkido,2,Mon May 25 18:45:28 2015 UTC,"I am normally a big fan of McDermott, but their G-Core shafts are really bad. The biggest problem they have is simply warpage. Virtually everyone I know who has purchased a G-Core has seen it warp quite a bit after just a few months of play. I love the value of McD cues, especially their low end cues for beginners. They use a good pin, decent woods, and seem to hold up pretty good to normal wear and tear. But their G-Core product really needs some work. I'd say the HXT is a better made product by a long shot. I actually prefer the HXT over the Predator stuff, too."

billiards,372dun,randomkido,2,Tue May 26 02:28:44 2015 UTC,"I have 3 G-core shafts, one of which is 4 years old.  I have had no issues with any of them.  One of these G-cores replaced a first generation 314, but that was for subjective reasons not quality.  G-core shafts are guaranteed for life, including warpage.  If you have an issue with any of their products they will sort it out extremely quickly and without hassle.  I've never owned a Players product so I can't speak to that.  They are made in China and I just don't dig on that.  :)"
billiards,372dun,bullitt_60,2,Tue May 26 15:46:25 2015 UTC,I appreciate the additional feedback. Is g-core shafts your preference then?
billiards,372dun,randomkido,2,Tue May 26 16:00:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, just my personal preference.  I appreciate the lack of deflection but the solid composite core shafts feel  dead or numb to me.  I've owned a 314 and I have an i3 but the G-core provides a happy medium for me."
billiards,372dun,bullitt_60,4,Tue May 26 16:24:34 2015 UTC,"No, you should buy an OB+ shaft.  But if you're getting a 314-2 or -3, I'd go for the 3.  It's only $50 more and it's a slight improvement over the -2.  Get the best technology you can now if you'll be playing with it for a few years.  (the price difference is $75, but the 3 comes with a nice layered tip.  If you order the -2 from seyberts with the same predator tip, it'll end up being $225 instead of $200, with the -3 being $275).  I played with a 314 for 10 years, then broke it (the ferrule snapped off in the middle of a match), and replaced it with a 314-2, which I've used for the past year or so.  Just picked up an OB Pro+ and I'm loving the shit out of it."

billiards,372dun,elint,1 point,Sun May 24 18:08:17 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to say I trust the quality of OB shafts better than Predator.  They're made in the US and with the new plus line, they're using solid pieces of high-quality maple to make their ""vortex-pie"" instead of cheaper laminated maple.  I can only speak to workmanship and quality of the cues when I recommend OB.  I don't have similar models to compare the two, so my opinion that the OB Pro+ is better than the 314-2 wouldn't be fair.  The Pro+ is more similar to the predator Z line than the 314 line, and a closer comparison would be the OB Classic+, when comparing tip diameter and shaft taper.  I love the Pro+ hit way better, but I've also played with a friend's Z2 and preferred it to my 314-2, so maybe I just like the smaller tip and conical taper :)  As for the tip, I wasn't actually recommending the Victory tip, I just threw that in to make the prices an apples-to-apples comparison.  I haven't actually shot with a Victory tip.  I have a Kamui black soft on the 314-2 and clear black soft on the OB, so I like your tip choice)."

Why I like the milk duds:   They feel and sound like a hard tip, but play like a soft tip. They don't mushroom. They are inexpensive The quality control pooldawg8 uses creates the most consistent tip I've tried (Kamui, Wizard, Emerald, Morii, Triangle, Elk Master, Le Pro and dozens of up and comer tips) It wears evenly and breaks in very quickly.

billiards,3711ff,TheOneCalledAtlas,6,Sat May 23 21:33:27 2015 UTC,"You should know that if you're thinking about anything except the shot in front of you, you're just sharking yourself. That includes stuff that you might think is positive, like ""ok, you got this. forget the last miss. You gotta make a statement here and get out. If you clean up this rack you'll be caught up. Show these people what you can do.""   Your only thoughts should be speed, spin, and how thick to cut the ball. And if you feel like you don't have the confidence to pull off shot A, is there a shot B? In theory you should have that decision made before you ever get down, but sometimes you get down and realize shot A is just not realistic. At least, not if you're shooting a little shaky and feel no confidence in it.  In those situations, get back up and line up again. In fact, that probably is the best concrete advice I could give that would help you. Don't be afraid to get up off the shot and redo your routine. And if it still feels wrong, get up again and start looking for plan B.  I personally play at my worst when something is subconsciously (or consciously) annoying me. Could be the karaoke, or could be those shit talking teammates you referred to. In theory we're supposed to be able to shut out that stuff, but if you can fix the problem directly (like ask your teammates to please stuff it, because they're fucking up your flow) then do it.   Lastly, you have to lean on your fundamentals when you're feeling shaky. But if your fundamentals are shaky, you can't lean on them very hard. So you gotta make them rock solid. If you're one of those who shoots balls with lots of 'touch' or 'feel' or whatever, and never spent any time worrying about what your back arm is doing, or your bridge... it might be a good time to start working on that. Even if you're already a pretty high level player.   Remove all twists and jitters from your stroke and make it a robot-like back-to-forward motion with zero movement elsewhere. At first it might feel kind of rigid or mechanical, but after a while you'll realize it makes your game a little more bulletproof, your stroke works even when your head's a mess.  PS: overthinking can be bad when it comes to decisionmaking (like playing a shot in a much more difficult way, or playing the wrong shot, because you think it gives you some subtle advantage).   But I don't believe you can overthink basic stuff like aim, speed, and spin once you're down on the shot. If you take an extra long time lining up, then the problem isn't that you're giving too much thought to these important things.   The problem is, you don't have any idea if a particular line of aim is going to work, or if the ball will go. You think that if you sit there and agonize over it, maybe you will eventually get that confident feeling that the ball will go.   But the feeling probably is never going to come. So just admit to yourself ""I have no idea if this line of aim is correct, but it's my best guess so here we go."" It just means you haven't practiced that shot enough, at least not with that speed or spin. You can come back and try it again later. For now, do your best guess, and then shoot it normally. Don't rush and don't hesitate to get up if the shot's wrong... but just be aware that if you don't know how to aim the shot, you're not gonna figure it out right then and there. You're gonna figure it out later in practice."

I'm a 6 and have a 7 on my team, and when one of us gets off-kilter, we'll have the other one watch us for a few strokes.  Often-times we're not keeping our head down and jumping up, or doing something odd.  If it's mental, then you've broken your routine.  Do something different to get back into it.  If you're over-analyzing, force yourself not to.  Force yourself to spend no more than a few seconds lining up each shot (hopefully you notice you're in a funk at the warm-up table and not in a match).  If you don't have a routine, build one: stand back, look at the table, figure out your ASS (angle, speed, spin), chalk, address the ball, practice strokes, stroke, follow through.  Easy shots or hard, stick with your routine until it becomes second nature."

It can take a tremendous amount of internal fortitude and restraint to bite your tongue and not respond to this kind of childish psychological warfare, but if you can muster up the willpower to present a completely unphased response to this stuff, it can be hilarious to watch shit talkers crumble under the weight of their own insecurities.   If it is your friends just ribbing you for fun, then you'll just have to deal with that in a way that is most appropriate. If it is non-friends who are genuinely picking on you then there is no sweeter justice that robbing them of the pleasure of seeing their efforts cause you any measurable grief of any kind.   When my mental game gets shaky, I try to isolate the individual problems and break them down to very small, short-term goals. I start with trying to reduce any variables in my stance, my stroke, and my pre-shot routine. Ignore all of the factors that fall outside of things you can directly control. Luck plays a big factor in pool, and you simply can't allow it to influence your attitude and state of mind. Try to eliminate the personal factors from the game, and ""play the table, not the opponent"" as much as possible. Look at each and every shot as a unique opportunity to demonstrate superior decision-making abilities. Boil down your options to those with the highest probability of predicting the outcome. Pick the shots that you feel you have the highest amount of control with. Avoid the shots with chaotic, unpredictable outcomes. The better choices you make with shot selection, the more control you will feel like you exert over the game. More control = more confidence. More confidence = more shit talkers.

billiards,36y1wd,RedditPanhandler,2,Sat May 23 01:55:58 2015 UTC,I would much rather just watch a game a pool between two good players than watch a bunch of wisecrackers talk about money and egos. Why should I care about any of that? I just want to see some good safety battles.
billiards,36y1wd,TheJawsofIce,3,Sat May 23 22:38:08 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you would, but this is a TV show that is trying to appeal to millions of people. You must understand that most people need more than just silently watching pool to be interested, especially if they've never played before.   As only a decent player, I think the coolest things about pool are all the crazy shots like the massés or even just some impressive multiple-cushion bank shots and the show did a nice job of showing those for others who might now get into the sport."
billiards,36y1wd,CursedLlama,2,Tue May 26 06:49:51 2015 UTC,I guess my only valid point is that I could do without the super ego personalities.
billiards,36y1wd,TheJawsofIce,1 point,Tue May 26 07:34:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can see why people feel that way. They think that it isn't what a typical pool player is. And that new people might think this is what they'll see at any pool hall.  The flip-side of that is that if every player was just a silent one who stood in the background watching all of this unfold, the general TV audience wouldn't really find that entertaining either. I hate when someone is heckling me during a game but for entertainment purposes you need something happening besides pool. Super egos are really entertaining to people, and it makes each character a lot more memorable. Viewers watch those they like and root against people they hate. It's petty but it's reality TV.   You and me like watching a pool game because we think about what we would do and even learn from the professionals. Someone that has never played before sees it as people just hitting shots in. That's cool for a while but it won't fascinate them like it does you and me (or just me, maybe).   The valid complaint in this thread is the rampant gambling that the show is talking about. Sure, it exists in pool but this show sort of glorifies it so that the games become ""high stakes."" The problem is that newcomers might think that this is how all pool games go and will be dissuaded from going to a pool hall to have fun. That's actually bad for the sport.   Pool is fun. I love playing the game, honing my skills, and just shooting around with friends. That's what people should learn about the game, in my opinion."
billiards,36y1wd,CursedLlama,0,Tue May 26 09:11:48 2015 UTC,lol safety battles on a tv show? No effin way. I'd turn it off 13 seconds through can you imagine someone who doesn't play would want to watch that?
billiards,36y1wd,Durtyjoey,2,Thu May 28 03:23:19 2015 UTC,"I personally believe its not going to be good for the game. It sends the wrong impression to people who may be interested in the game, that if they go to a pool hall to learn they are going to get ""hustled"". The game is slowly dying in America. It needs an influx of newer players if theres any hope at all of it getting to be as big as snooker is overseas. I think this show could have been done a little differently to show the game as family friendly activity and it could have greatly helped.   Just think of what immediately comes to most people's mind when you mention a pool room. A dark, dirty, smoke filled room where you better hold onto your money with a tight fist or you will leave broke and confused. This is the mindset that we need to change.  I also think they could have came up with a better title, there isn't really any true hustlers left. There's newbs, players, short stops, pros. Anyone who gets ""hustled"" is a fool who undoubtedly has no business betting anything on a game of pool."
billiards,36y1wd,Humpin_Toad,3,Sat May 23 10:30:50 2015 UTC,"Lmao ""let's make a reality show about a fun family friendly activity"". You are in complete denial about the game and it's history.  Let's stop trying to act like pool is our virgin game in need of protection from the seedy gamblers who are set on destroying it's image. The word ""pool"" comes from ""pooling"" your money together in a bet. Almost every great player was a big time gambler. Sure there are those who don't gamble, and that's their prerogative, but you don't see them whining about how it's not a family friendly game anymore.  I personally think you're what's wrong with pool. Your just a body on a table, taking up space. Your not interesting to watch or play against and you think anything that is interesting to watch is ""bad for our sport"".   If you don't like it, that's fine. But realize that pool is not yours to protect and gambling will always be a part of the game whether you like it or not. If you want a family friendly activity then put a table in your basement and watch blues clues while the real pool players play in the dark, dirty smoke filled rooms with their money gripped tight."
billiards,36y1wd,ceezaleez,7,Sat May 23 19:40:16 2015 UTC,"Ok, so because I think a show is bad for our sport you bring my game into the picture? Would you like to play for your ""tightly gripped cash""? I have pool cues probably worth more than your car. Dont make assumptions about my game. You have no idea if I'm interesting to watch or not. You wanna play? I'll be in Atlanta a week from now, and then heading towards Indiana. We can find out who is interesting and post video here to settle it.   Forgive me for wanting the best for a game that I have played most of my life. I have been all over the country playing this game.  Its been a part of my life for well over 20 years. I want to see it grow and become as big as snooker overseas. Their players are treated the way NFL or NBA stars are here. Is it wrong to want that for my friends? I know a few pros, some former US open winners, who still play strong, but are struggling due to the lack of big events across the country. There's a few big ones every year but the attendance is dwindling. Were you at the DCC? I was, as I have been for the past five. This year was the lowest attendance I have personally seen. Arguably the best event in America, and the attendance was terrible.   Yes, the history of pool is a dark, seedy affair. I agree with that point. Thats what the sport needs to get away from to flourish in the modern day. Thats what has made snooker so successful. They have polished the image, and the have huge sponsorships. I merely want the same here.   As for whats wrong with the sport, its people wanting to keep the image dark and smoky, and not recognizing that beneath the old age is a bright and strategic game. You can play to win in so many ways, from powering to a runout to strategic safety play. Its a beautiful game, and I'd like to see it grow and flourish. We as pool players need to work together to make it happen, not bad mouth each other for trying to present it in the best light. That sir, (or madam) is whats wrong with the game.   May the rolls ever be in your favor."
billiards,36y1wd,Humpin_Toad,2,Sat May 23 20:46:40 2015 UTC,"Excellent response. Sponsors don't want to be associated with a barroom game played by degenerate gamblers. I also think the person who responded to you is associated with the show somehow. They and someone else always seem to jump to the shows defense whenever someone gives their opinion of it, even when the opinion is tame."
billiards,36y1wd,redditis4queers,2,Sat May 23 21:03:21 2015 UTC,"At this point, the game is dead. This is the one thing that has an opportunity to bring people into the game. Sure their are better ways to present the game, and I think the show could have been casted a little differently and it would have been better, but it is what it is. I don't think it was that bad, and I think they made an effort to show the game in a civilized manner as well as the barking and bullshit. The match making between barretta and dechaine was like a business meeting with notes passed back and forth to contrast finnegan and gary's barking. I don't think there would be a show if you didn't have the contrast. It wouldn't work as a family friendly affair.  Most shows take a few episodes to work out the kinks. Give them some time to figure out the editing on the actual pool and I think it will improve. I think the best thing they could do is post the actual sets on the website for the pool enthusiasts to watch, because believe it or not, they actually played the sets. I'm not sure if they had a stationary camera on the table for every set though.   I was implying that your whats wrong with the game if you can't appreciate a money game or automatically assume gambling is bad, which is how you made it seem in your post. People who take the game so seriously but only play for fun are boring to watch. They take up space. If there are 4 tables in a room, 3 tables with people playing for fun and 1 with action... which one do you think people are going to be crowded around? Don't take it as a personal attack on your ability to play because it wasn't intended as such. This isn't a pissing contest.  I was at DCC this year and it was pretty depressing. I was also at the US open last year and it was even worse. Q masters was a ghost town compared to previous years.  Edit: If this show does well and gets picked up for another season, your friends might have an opportunity to get some TV money, so why not support it? Also, what if it proves there is an audience and brings other networks sniffing around to get in on the action? If we agree the game is dead or dying, then there is nowhere to go but up, right? Whats the worst that could happen... A bunch of fish coming to the pool hall wanting to gamble because they saw finnegan banging balls on TV?"
billiards,36y1wd,ceezaleez,1 point,Sat May 23 21:48:54 2015 UTC,Having a cue worth more than his car is nothing to brag about. It's usually new kids that buy the really expensive stuff because they think it'll help their game. A good player could beat you(or anyone) with the back end of a short cue. Talent is what's important  here.

You mean the history that entails it being the game of kings and queens, a luxury initially played by only the wealthiest of society? Maybe it's you who is in denial about the game   gambling will always be a part of the game whether you like it or not.   True, just as gambling was and is a part of golf, football, basketball, and so many other games. What these other games DO NOT promote is ""the hustle"". There is integrity to wagering. If betting on pool meant two players match up in a race to 9, no spot, no games on the wire, no handicapping, and without having previously demonstrated some ""speed"" in order to get the game in the first place, then so be it. However pool is one of the last vestiges of the art of the ""hustle"", and while it is fascinating to so many, it is truly holding the game back from being more widely accepted. Why settle for a million new fans (shows based on gambling and hustling) when you could make 10 million new fans (tournaments that display, character, honor, integrity, prestige)?"
billiards,36y1wd,carter1984,1 point,Wed May 27 17:04:59 2015 UTC,"Last I checked there hasn't ever been a king of america, so I stand by my statement. Like I said before, the word ""pool"" came about because people ""pool"" their money together over a game of pocket billiards. Pool in American history is full of gambling.    Yes, the game was originally of kings and queens but it was a prisoner in the bastille who put a leather tip on his cue and gave birth to the game we know. A prisoner.     Also, lets look at recent pocket billiard history... Pool experienced it's 2 most recent booms on the heels of movies that focused their plots on gambling. The Hustler and The Color of Money both featured pools seedier side, and purists said it would be bad for the sport. Well it wasn't that bad for the sport now was it? One could argue TCOM gave birth to the camel tour and the IPT of the early 90s.    I get where you are coming from, but having a reality show that dumbs the game down a little really isn't that bad. While not an accurate representation of our sport, it still puts something on the screen that might appeal to the mass audience. People who don't know or care about pool might get caught up in the mindless drama that seems to work for so many other reality shows. They might decide to go to the pool hall and start knocking balls around. This could only stand to benefit us as a community.    I posted this in another thread, but it didn't really get any attention. Worst dump ever. The players killed pool on their own. They scared the Casinos away, and they made pool toxic to sponsors. The Color of Money helped pool, and the players greed killed it.  Don't get me wrong, I am by no means comparing this show to the color of money or the hustler in terms of quality, I'm just trying to argue the point that the exposure will help the game.     The people on the show should still conduct themselves as professionals and they should uphold the integrity of the game in their day to day affairs, but if they have to gab it up on camera a little I don't see a big problem with that."
billiards,36y1wd,ceezaleez,0,Thu May 28 08:36:34 2015 UTC,"François Mingaud:       Captain François Mingaud (sometimes spelled Mingot, Mengaud or Minguad,  and often referred to simply as M. Mingaud; born 4 January 1771 Le Cailar, Nîmes, France, died 23 December 1847, Rotterdam, Netherlands  ) was an infantry officer in the French army and a carom billiards player. He is credited as the inventor of the leather tip for a billiards cue, a ""possibly not original idea"" that he perfected whilst imprisoned in Paris for political outspokenness.   This revolutionized the game of billiards, allowing the cue ball to be finely manipulated by the application of spin.

billiards,36y1wd,autowikibot,1 point,Thu May 28 08:36:57 2015 UTC,The relatively even matches between players trying to fight their way up the list were great and a good advertisement for the game.  However the Matches with Dechaine where both games were made terribly and especially the one against Berretta where he dogs the ten just to not shut her out look bad and show that hustling and nitting it up still exist.  Matching up and making games is a big part of gambling but is also a very difficult thing to do well and is what will scare off potential players.  Any exposure is good for the game and gets people thinking about pool again although on a channel like TruTV it will get mostly players watching it and people that have heard about it and are already in the game.  Also the one chick that is a players girlfriend is just terrible and needs to shut up and stay out of the room and off of tv as she just looks like a drunk whiny spoiled brat.

billiards,36w0u4,moar_distractions,3,Fri May 22 18:24:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with IDontLikeAnyofYall, 99 Critical Shots is my recommendation.   A few of my other recommendations to beginners:  -I don't care how you've seen other people do it, or what you're currently comfortable with, there are only two acceptable ways to bridge. Open or Closed. Sometimes if the balls are in the right position, you will want to use this bridge on the rail. If you aren't using a bridge like this (I often switch back and forth depending on the shot), forcing yourself to learn now should be your top priority. Also, Get low and keep the cue right under your chin.  -Ghost Ball, Ghost Ball, Ghost Ball. Think of the ghost ball every time you set up a shot. Here is an illustration, feel free to research more.  -I think the best way to train yourself to improve is with ""marathon"" sessions. Pool is a muscle memory game, and you train muscle memory when they are tired. It takes a while with just a 20oz stick.   -As you are improving, first focus on cue ball position based on getting to the middle of the table, rather than leaving it in the ""perfect"" place. You are better off with options rather than nothing after missing that perfect position. Taking that further, I think the most important shot to practice is a cut shot where the object ball is along the side rail sort of near the corner pocket and the cue is toward the middle of the table. There are obviously hundreds of common ""scenarios"" of shots, but this is one you will see over and over, even within the same game. In this scenario, with a little practice you will be able to apply a bit of back spin, make the cut into the corner, and bring the cue right back to the middle of the table, hopefully leaving yourself with options for your next shot.   Good luck to you! Pool is a great game that can never be completely mastered. It's my competitive outlet now that I don't play more standard sports as often. Not all leagues are created equal, or even different nights of the same league. If you're getting frustrated, maybe try a different one. In a truly handicapped league, everyone should be losing half their games if the pairings are random. But I've found the way to win is to have new players committed to improving, since the handicaps generally lag behind their actual ability."

billiards,36w0u4,moar_distractions,1 point,Fri May 22 18:24:14 2015 UTC,"question about the bridge: I'm a decent player, but always looking to improve. I'm a female, and my hands are smaller than everyone I've ever compared them to - it's kind of a novelty to me ""hey let's see how much smaller my hands are than yours!"" anyway... lol... I'm not comfortable with an open bridge as it feels... unstable, I guess is the best word. I shoot with a somewhat modified closed bridge. my index finger doesn't wrap completely around the shaft, even with my turned down shaft. do you think there's a better bridge option?"
billiards,36w0u4,glamfairy,2,Mon May 25 21:54:38 2015 UTC,"If you're just hooking your pointer part way around the shaft, then yes, there are definitely better options.

billiards,36w0u4,brosephashe,1 point,Tue May 26 22:15:20 2015 UTC,"The problem with your pointer hooked over the top is the added drag on the shaft. It just makes it harder to keep a straight stroke.

billiards,36vj6i,ceezaleez,1 point,Sun May 24 00:22:05 2015 UTC,Hmm. Pool has potential to be big but it's so varied. There's 9-ball and both UK and U.S. 8-ball whereas snooker is one game. If pool was one cue sport alone like 8-ball and there wasn't such variation then maybe it could match snooker's status.
billiards,36vj6i,SpyderzVidz,1 point,Fri May 22 21:37:46 2015 UTC,"I think the lack of quality coverage (online or TV) for pool doesn't help. Watch a UK snooker match then watch a US 9-ball match - from the quality of the production (resolution, number of camera angles, freshness of on-screen stats) to the commentators, everything about US coverage is painful.  American football and rugby haven't standardised (i.e., both still exist) and both are huge, so the international standardisation isn't that big a deal."

billiards,36udmk,Durtyjoey,5,Fri May 22 04:56:40 2015 UTC,"As for me, and I can only speak for me obviously, the whole composition matters. For me the weight is extremly important as well as the distribution of it. I like to have my cues ""front-heavy"". For me a cue also needs to have personality. I appreciate great craftsmanship. I really like seeing diffrent materials build into the cue. It's also quite important to give me confidence. I'm way more confident shooting a difficult shot with a well build cue than with the broomstick that hangs at the wall in the local bar. Then there is the feedback that goes throught the tip, shaft, binding down into your hand, this feeling is what difference it makes for me between a good and a great cue stick. I like having a crisp feeling with a lot of feedback so I can instantly tell, without even looking, if I hit the cueball good. In recent years, the diameter of the shaft also started to play a role for me. I started playing a 314 which was smaller and I really liked that, then I switched to a 314² and Z² and the Z² played great for me even tho I changed the taper from the ""strong"" taper to the more commonly used Euro/Pro-Taper. Now I'm playing a WX900, a bit thicker than the Z² but it plays great. If I now try cues from other people (i recently tried the EX-Pro), the thickness of the shaft just doesn't feel right anymore.    TL;DR: the whole composition matters, everything needs to line up together to make a great cue."
billiards,36udmk,Liquidicity,3,Fri May 22 09:36:55 2015 UTC,"The easiest way to think about it is that the importance of things goes from the tip down. Tip is what contacts the ball, so has the biggest influence over the hit. Then there's the shaft, with properties of stiffness, deflection, taper. The joint matters too- the density of threads, material of pin, the materials on either face. Then there's the butt itself- weight, wrap, 'crispness'  As far as shafts on sticks, there's a whole bunch of variety, and it's highly unlikely a randomly selected shaft will fit on a randomly selected butt.   Players use 5/16x18 joint I believe. This is a fairly common size, by the most common are 5/16x14, 3/8x10, and Uniloc (exclusive to Predator and Lucasi stuff mostly)."
billiards,36udmk,asamimasa,1 point,Fri May 22 09:23:33 2015 UTC,Yeah uniloc is mostly on them but I wouldn't say exclusive. Samsara break cues are uniloc and a few others I can't think of. OB maybe?
billiards,36udmk,launch_from_my_pad,2,Fri May 22 15:18:52 2015 UTC,"I think the shaft is the most important part of the cue, for sure. The butt of a cue is generally only something which is used to achieve a certain weight and balance in the cue. If a cue has a shaft and tip which fit my preferences then I can play pretty well with it regardless of how the butt is set up. I think you could probably improve your impression of your Players cue if you changed to a shaft which you like. You will certainly want to make sure you order your new shaft with the correct matching threads. Many Players cues use a very common joint pin which is a 5/16"" x 18 pin. I think most all of their models use this pin, and I can't remember ever seeing one with a different pin than this but you should double check to make sure before you order.   The second thing you should take note of is the collar style on your Players butt. The collar is the plastic part of the joint that protects the woods from damage where they screw together. Often, you can order a new shaft with different collar options so you can usually order a new shaft with a collar that matches your current shaft.   Your new shaft will generally come shipped with some kind of standard tip option, which is often an inexpensive LePro brand tip or something similar. When ordering a new shaft, you can often upgrade the tip for a small fee. Your new shaft will arrive with a nicer tip already installed and ready to go. Sometimes just upgrading a tip can make you like a shaft much more than before.   Make some mental notes about what you specifically don't really like about your current Players shaft. Is the thickness too fat or too skinny? Is the taper of the shaft too long or too short? Is the overall length of the shaft too long or too short? Does the tip feel too hard or too soft, or does it not hold its shape very well? Shafts and tips are the most customizable parts of a cue, and no two pool players have the exact same preferences. A cue is much like a custom-tailored business suit.... everyone has different measurements and preferences for what they like and what fits their game. Figuring out what your preferences are for a pool cue shaft will go a long way to improving the way a cue translates your intentions to the cueball.   ~Cheers"
billiards,36udmk,gabrielleigh,1 point,Fri May 22 16:43:24 2015 UTC,"Shaft is definitely more important. Remember to buy one with the correct joint or you're going to have to go to a cue maker and have him put in a different pin which is really annoying to do and there's a chance things won't work out good like it being off center because the butt was already off centered. Stupid proprietary joints cost a bit more.   I use regular maple shaft so not many shafts feel too different, what I find most important t is the tip. It's the difference between me using crazy English or miscuing and losing confidence"
billiards,36secf,WYnativeinAZ,5,Thu May 21 19:12:33 2015 UTC,I don't think you needed to be down table. You just needed to get back to the top of the diagram. I think it was the right spin that killed you.
billiards,36secf,DetroitLarry,2,Thu May 21 19:20:56 2015 UTC,I'm with you on this one.  Anywhere to the top left of the center pocket would have been fine.  No need to force the cue ball that far down table.
billiards,36secf,BeachBum2012,4,Thu May 21 22:54:29 2015 UTC,"This is a very tough table.  I would have played 3 - 1 - safety.  I'm almost always balls out offensive, but there really isn't much and I'd say even for a top player this is a very tough out.  To make it as far as you did was impressive.  Here is the safety I would play(I'll try to get a diagram later): After the 1 get an angle on the 6 ball to push it off the rail and in front of the side pocket while following the cueball in between the 5 and 6.  This solves the biggest problem and your 1 is off the table and you should be in good shape coming back to the table with your 6 by the side."
billiards,36secf,Pip_Pip,2,Thu May 21 19:42:20 2015 UTC,After the 1 get an angle on the 6 ball to push it off the rail and in front of the side pocket while following the cueball in between the 5 and 6.   That's pretty risky. You would have to play that safe perfectly or you would leave him a shot. Almost all the opponent's balls are hangers.
billiards,36secf,redditor1983,2,Fri May 22 01:37:57 2015 UTC,"I agree it is risky, but:  Go for the out:  Playing against a top regional player means if you don't get there you're going to win a few percent of the time.  I see getting out here a small percentage of the time.  So maybe 10% chance of winning.  A medium skilled vs a top skilled in this position  Play the weaker safety:  again against a top regional player a weak safety is just as good as going for it maybe another 10% chance of winning  Play for the strong safety: this is a risky safety, but I think the chances are better than 10%.  Because as long as you can get close you could always do the feather and freeze on the ball safety as well as the one I described earlier.  I would say it's more like  30-40% of playing a good safety here.  Which still isn't great, but I think it's the best of the bad options.    Go for the out differently:  Now, if he were to have played it differently, like the out I described later on.  I think I personally could get out like that 30-40% of the time.  A top guy maybe 60%.  So that might be the best option if the circumstances were different.  I'm trying to figure in the skill of the shooter and opponent as well.  And the pattern he would be able to see."
billiards,36secf,Pip_Pip,2,Fri May 22 02:06:33 2015 UTC,I agree with you here.  My coach also teaches to play the percentages.  A strong safety is often preferable to a tough out.
billiards,36secf,Pip_Pip,1 point,Fri May 22 05:27:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  I primarily play defensively, and was intentionally being aggressive, but didn't see a way to get safe... Yours could work!"
billiards,36secf,pr0driveX,2,Thu May 21 20:05:53 2015 UTC,"I will say though.  If I was going to try to get out, I think I would go: 3, 7, 4 (trying to break out the 5/6 from the 4)  Then depending where I ended up after that it would change."
billiards,36secf,Pip_Pip,1 point,Thu May 21 22:01:25 2015 UTC,I think I would've tried to play the safety as well and get the cue ball behind the 13 close to the rail.  Sometimes I'll play safety shots differently if I know my opponent is better or worse at certain shots.  But that can be risky.
billiards,36secf,CreeDorofl,3,Thu May 21 21:01:29 2015 UTC,"I actually looked at that first.   But, he said it was a very good regional player he was playing  against.   If it was a lesser op I would do that too!"
billiards,36secf,wefolas,3,Thu May 21 21:36:43 2015 UTC,"You picked the correct shot, but didn't need any spin at all. If you cut a ball thinly down the rail, the cue ball goes more or less perpendicular to that rail. Or a bit forward of perpendicular. You just roll it in softish and let the cue ball float straight across to play the 4 in the same corner. It has a slight built in safe, if you roll the 7 softly and miss it may block the pocket."
billiards,36secf,PShark,2,Thu May 21 23:58:56 2015 UTC,"This, hit it pocket speed, no english and the natural follow will give you the leave you want on the 4 and you roll the 7 down and might get the safe if you miss."
billiards,36secf,spectacular_coitus,3,Fri May 22 20:02:21 2015 UTC,"Right ball, wrong spin. Good run up to that point though."
billiards,36secf,Liquidicity,3,Thu May 21 19:35:25 2015 UTC,I would have shot the four before the seven and come off the end rail hard enough to get shape down table on the 7. It would be pretty easy to get on the 8 with even questionable shape on the 7.
billiards,36secf,petermgates,3,Thu May 21 23:17:22 2015 UTC,"why not play the 4, top spin, very little inside english, speed (2.5), to bounce off the short rail in the kitchen. Something like this http://i.imgur.com/BLNaNCo.png (sorry for shitty paint quality)"
billiards,36secf,petermgates,2,Fri May 22 09:54:59 2015 UTC,"I don't like the sound of the high right, that's what pushed the cue ball towards that corner...  Personally if I was playing the 6 in the top left (diagram makes it look like a tight squeeze), I would have followed down for the 4 in the bottom left then cut the seven into the bottom right. That way I have easy shape on the 8 in the bottom left."
billiards,36secf,Vaquero_Pescador,1 point,Thu May 21 19:29:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think you're right.  My thought at the time was that because the 6 was so tight, and was straight in, I just barely rolled it, when I should have followed it up a bit and shot your way.  Also, fwiw, I had walked around and looked at the angle prior to shooting... I couldn't scratch past the 8 ball, and the 8 wouldn't go in if I ran into it, so I felt safe."
billiards,36secf,redditor1983,2,Thu May 21 19:38:05 2015 UTC,Lol but you could go in off the 12. I guess you just can't plan for everything...  It was a tough layout though. You got further than I would - I'd never have played for the bank on the 5.
billiards,36secf,ceezaleez,2,Thu May 21 19:50:42 2015 UTC,"Nice work whittling that table down.  After walking the 7, I would have been trying to rebound off the rail cross table along that grid line to sink the 4 in the bottom left. Slight middle to bottom left should do it (7 o'clock on the cue), but you gotta have either a soft touch or bang it 3 rails. Nothing easy there."
billiards,36rzl0,poshio,3,Thu May 21 17:28:55 2015 UTC,"Great choice for a first cue. If you haven't found any reputable online sellers like ozone or pooldawg who can ship to you, eBay or local Craigslistesque sites may be a good bet.   I'd thoroughly check the return policy to protect yourself against getting a warped cue. Shipping may be too expensive to be worth sending back though, unless the seller will pay both ways.

billiards,36puze,tiddl_ey,2,Thu May 21 12:05:33 2015 UTC,If you want to get better at breaking any game just watch Corey Duel he is an innovator on racking and spends as much time on the break as anyone else out there right now.    I personally prefer the cut break in 9 ball making the wing ball and sending the one towards the side where it either drops or will come up table with the cue ball.
billiards,36puze,elint,1 point,Thu May 21 04:50:20 2015 UTC,Awesome! Cut break! Google'd this term with much better results. Corey Duel appeared in those pages referring to his occasional use of soft break. Soft break isn't useful for me as I play mainly in cpa(apa). I also haven't seen any pros utilize the soft break in my YouTube ventures. I assume it is legal but out of style?  So  Cut break   Soft break  Is there any other main theory break types that anyone is aware of? Will keep searching but thanks for this. Upvote.  *edit typos/format
billiards,36puze,spectacular_coitus,3,Thu May 21 05:45:54 2015 UTC,"The way I break is still legal in APA as far as my league is concerned, as a controlled break where 4 balls hit the rail is not considered a foul to us.  I play more for money than in league however and feel it is far more important to have control over the cue ball than anything else and will help your game far more than hitting it as hard as possible.    Another great thing to look into his racking secrets by Joe Tucker, his book/dvd will teach you more about breaking and racking that will show you much more about the break than most anything else I've seen.  Corey has expanded on that immensely with the amount of time he spends on seeing the effects of his break speed english and angle all will change the results.  Joe's Book is out of print but the DVD is still available.    The best thing is to pay attention to the results of your breaks and how you hit the ball and if the result was positive then keep trying to repeat that if it was negative obviously change the way you hit the ball but still take notes on how the break turned out."
billiards,36puze,Nexism,2,Thu May 21 06:58:16 2015 UTC,"Soft break isn't useful for me as I play mainly in cpa(apa).   The APA/CPA rulebook actually states:   Breaking safe or soft is not allowed. The League Operator may make judgments and issue penalties to teams and players who are not breaking hard. Breaking just hard enough to comply with this rule is not a guarantee against penalties. Remember, break as hard as you can with control.   I added the emphasis at the end.  You don't want to break super-soft, but you don't need to put the entire force of your body into the shot.  As long as you pocket a ball or drive four balls to a rail, what you consider as ""with control"" is up to you.  My break ""with control"" isn't much harder than my average normal-game shot, because I am trying to control the cue ball and make it stop in the middle of the table EVERY time."
billiards,36puze,grlldcheese87,1 point,Thu May 21 20:25:46 2015 UTC,"Yea true, and getting a good spread is easy in 9ball with an accurate full hit. Much more flexibility experimenting with different powers."
billiards,36puze,corellianspiceaddict,2,Thu May 21 21:24:21 2015 UTC,"Whether I hit the ball really hard or relatively soft, if I hit it the one ball ever so slightly off center to the right, hitting from the head string by the right cushion with about a cue tip of bottom right english, the 1 ball will make a beeline for the left side pocket. It might not always go in, but it'll hit a horn if it doesn't.  If I can't get that break to work on a given day, I just grab a bar cue and hit the damn things like they owe me money."

billiards,36ofp4,djangoz,4,Wed May 20 21:36:20 2015 UTC,"I tried out the new set of shafts, and was least impressed by the Z3. It's fine and i wouldn't mind owning one, but I felt that the difference between the 314-2 and 3 was more noticeable; a bit crisper in hit, nothing particularly noticeable with the advertised deflection rates. The Vantage was the biggest surprise to me. I don't generally like thicker shafts and prefer up to 12.5mm, but I did like the amount of action generated, and felt like a 'forgiving' shaft. The Z3 felt mostly like a Z2, every so slightly better, the taper felt ever so slightly different."
billiards,36ofp4,asamimasa,1 point,Wed May 20 22:23:18 2015 UTC,"This is similar to what I've heard all across the web about the 3rd generation predator line.  All fine shafts, but the Z3 probably isn't worth it if you already have a Z2, and the other 2 are great.  I had a 314 for 10 years before the ferrule popped off the shaft during a match.  I've had a 314-2 for years after that and loved it, too.  I had still always preferred my buddy's Z2, though.  I got a wild hair up my ass to upgrade last week and saw these same reviews about the 3rd gen line.  The Z3 being barely a step above the Z2 was disappointing, so I went another direction altogether and picked up the OB Pro Plus instead.  Got it Tuesday and heading out tonight to give it a try :)"

I thought in BCA rules (they might be playing different rules here though), you are allowed to touch a ball between you and the cue ball. But, if any balls come within the zone of the ball you touched, it is a foul. If no balls come back there, no foul. In Earl's shot, no balls came back to that area."

Usually this consist of me trying to get the cue ball around the table to the most difficult position.  No stop shots, basically trying stuff out to see if I can do it.  It's not necessarily practice but it doesn't hurt my game to do it.   I end up missing some shots because they're overly complicated.  Just helps to keep me from running out without having to dog easy shots, even if they're bad they can still pick up on stuff like that, and it's not fun when you know someone is playing against you like you're a little kid.  Edit: I've found that when dealing with people that aren't great at pool:  If they get excited about making a shot, you should get excited with them, they seem to appreciate it.  You know, encouragement and all that. I mention this because when I play serious pool you can see no emotion on my face.

I don't play 8 ball enough to be familiar with 8 ball handicaps.  My only issue with this is sometimes I have friends that refuse to take handicaps because they take it as an insult or something (these are amateurs). I'm like wtf...

Once again, it's a pleasant challenge and people don't call me out for throwing the game when it's a strange scratch.   All of this should be taken with a grain of salt, people get offended when you play down to them.  Mention that you want to keep it fun and say what your going to do.

Whoever sinks the last ball wins. When you scratch (whether you sink the cue ball or miss your object ball), your opponent gets ball in hand. If your opponent scratches in the pocket, you put the ball behind the line. If your opponent misses their object ball, there is no penalty. If your opponent makes slop, they can continue. I also treat playing them that it is practice."

So with that knowledge, if I'm playing someone that sucks, I would miss on purpose while making sure they have an easy shot and set. It takes some thinking and concentration so it looks lime you're actually trying. As long as they are making shots, they don't care too much how good you are since pretty much ever player has an ego...  Also I miss every other shot so my misses seem consistent enough they won't get suspicious.

billiards,36ipou,bullitt_60,1 point,Wed May 20 19:26:54 2015 UTC,"There is a game called Mr. and Mrs. Its name is obviously a bit dated, but it really works as an equalizer. I used to play it with my kids and we had a lot of pretty close games. The idea is that the better player plays standard Rotation and the weaker play can play any ball. The first player to reach 61 points (counting the value on the balls) wins. 61 is one more than half the sum of 1 through 15. If you have leather pockets, it's easy to keep track by manually putting each player's balls on opposite sides of the table (regardless of where the ball is pocketed) as shots are made.   On a good day I'm between a C and B club player. My kids sucked but could make a shot if it wasn't too hard. This game largely equalized us.   For really bad players, don't require them to use the cue ball. Just let the shoot the object directly into a pocket."

That being said, pool players are notoriously hard to shop for because we have this bad habit of just buying the shit we want.  One option in that price range is a case. Next time you're around him just sneak a peak at what size case he uses. There are a lot of options, size being dictated by how many butts and shafts a case holds. Large tubes for butts, slim tubes for shafts. Count how many his case has and find one that you think he'd like. If he has more cues than space in his case, buy him a bigger one. These can be monogrammed and personalized from the right seller.  Any other options in that price range tend to be highly subjective. You could look into jump cues, $200 being a good price point for a solid jumper, and have that engraved. Jump cues tend to be less in the territory of personal to individual players. Look for one with either a Kamui Hard, Samsara Super Hard or Phenolic tip if you go that route. Everything else is going to be mostly style with a little bit of material preference thrown in.  Best of luck, and congratulations on the engagement/pending marriage."

I totally agree with your position on not getting him a cue because of how personal preference can really be a big factor in whether or not he would like the gift. My experience in building gift cues has been maybe 50/50 at best, at least half the time a surprise cue is gifted to someone (even a slick custom made cue), they end up not enjoying the way it is set up.   I'd probably just shoot him with a tranquilizer dart and have some wicked pool-related design tattoo'd on his lower back like a tramp stamp. That would be the gift that keeps on giving every time he leans over to take a shot."

billiards,36hou7,ThisIsDennis,10,Tue May 19 13:45:42 2015 UTC,"Hi, glad to see someone get into pool ^ Here's what I would do, as far as equipment.  The first thing I notice is, it doesn't look like there's enough room around the table...  not sure if that can be fixed. If a situation comes up where the cue ball is near a rail, you need enough room to hold the cue level and swing it back at least a foot or so. Here's a pic showing what I mean --> http://www.pooldawg.com/article/assests/rail02.jpg  Note that he isn't just holding the cue level because he's a small guy, that's how you want to hold the stick 99% of the time anyway. Unfortunately you may not be able to because the wall is in the way.  So the first thing I would buy is a short cue, which is useful for dealing with walls etc. that block your swing. Shooting with a level short cue is better than shooting with a full-sized cue and being forced to elevate the back end to avoid the wall.  OK, so once that's taken care of:  • If you have the money, replacing the cloth would improve how the table plays by 200%. I can see from all the little white dots on the cloth that it's been used heavily, and probably the balls lose energy quickly and don't roll very far. You may even notice balls roll off their normal track and wander sideways when they're supposed to roll straight.   Good cloth will last for years, and your table will feel like it's brand new. but if you paid 100 Euro for the table, you may not like the cost... you'll probably pay at least another 100 for the cloth, plus the price of installing it. For most full-size (9 foot) tables, Simonis is the best and most popular cloth. But for smaller 7-foot tables, I think the most popular is Championship brand cloth. I think it plays fine and is much cheaper than Simonis. Here's a link to buy.  • If that's too much work and money, think about getting a good cue stick. There's a big difference in how a basic 'bar cue' plays, and a well-made 2-piece cue. Obviously your skill is the number 1 thing, but the equipment still matters. Good cue sticks don't have that sticky laminated finish on the shaft, which makes it chafe when you swing the cue and especially when you're a little sweaty. You want wood, not fiberglass. Something like this is a good starter cue --> http://www.ozonebilliards.com/accusnpech.html  • The balls also have a big impact on how the table feels when playing, sometimes it's not just the cloth that makes everything feel slow and sticky. You may want to either invest in a ball cleaner (which spins them around and coats them in a special cleaning oil) or even in a new set of balls. Balls can get expensive but should last a decade if cared for properly. I think these balls are a good deal for the price: http://www.billiardwarehouse.com/accessories/cuestix-2014/BBCB.html  • The plastic triangle is not essential to replace, but it's not expensive so I would do it. Plastic racks tend to bend slightly, and this causes them to bulge at the sides, which means they don't force the balls into the correct triangular pattern and it's difficult to get all the balls touching. When you can't get a good rack, then your break results look crappy, all the balls stay clumped together at the bottom of the table instead of spreading apart. This makes the game much less enjoyable. Spend a few euro on a wooden rack.   For actually improving your pool playing skills, here's what I recommend:   The 99 Critical Shots in pool is a book that shows you the most common and useful pool shots, that come up constantly. I don't know of any book or DVD or whatever that will boost your skill faster. And you may find you can come back to it years later and get new understanding of the things you read. It's very inexpensive too. Usually you can find it for less than 10 euros. Here's one for 2 USD! http://www.barnesandnoble.com/listing/2671897096346?r=1&kpid=2671897096346&cm_mmc=GooglePLA-_-Book_15To24-_-Q000000633-_-2671897096346 The most comprehensive, expert, ""textbook"" way to play correct pool is covered in ""Play Great Pool"", by one of the USA's top billiards instructors. He was, at one point, probably top 25 in the country and he was chosen for our very first Mosconi Cup team. He really understands the game and is great at explaining the correct way to play. The book is much longer and more dense than the 99 critical shots, and it spends many chapters on just fundamentals and drills. That might sound boring, but it's the kind of thing you need if you want to start out learning things the correct way, rather than learning bad habits that hold you back for years. Unfortunately it's a pretty expensive book, $100 USD for international orders. But in my opinion it's worth it. If you could only buy one pool book or DVD in your life, this would be it. http://playgreatpool.com/InstructionBook.aspx Another great source of technical, correct information, is Dr. Dave's website. It has lots of little youtube videos showing specific shots and subtle stuff about throw, english, etc. that helps you understand why certain shots can or cannot be made. Plus tests on helping spot tricky fouls. Here's the list of normal videos, there's also a section of interesting ultra-slow-motion videos. http://billiards.colostate.edu/normal_videos/index.html   The site has tons of information, if you want it organized into a nice DVD with lots of extra content that isn't available on the website, you should consider ordering his VEPS dvds. They are sort of like the DVD version of that second book I mentioned (though it's not the same guy). There are 5 DVD's, and you can get the whole set for $135. It's the ones with the red labels on this page: http://dr-dave-billiards.com/"

billiards,36hou7,petermgates,3,Tue May 19 16:25:54 2015 UTC,"First of all, welcome! And congratulations on getting your table for a steal.  You're in good company, the current world 9 ball champion is Dutch - his name is Niels Feijen. You should look him up as he is an excellent player to study. He actually has his own channel on ustream where you can watch him practice.  If you're interested in knowing what tournaments are happening, keep an eye on the AZBilliards calendar and the Eurotour calendar. Also worth subscribing to is the NYC Grind newsletter or facebook page  There are so many videos on youtube to watch, it's difficult to write a comprehensive list. My recommendation is to start with the CSI and Bilijar9 channels. Make a note of players you like and then search for their names to find more matches.  If you want to watch live pool, you can find free streams such as AZBTV, Inside Pool, ebilliard, OTR and POV Pool.  You can also find a huge library of professional matches available to watch for a modest fee on Accu-Stats.  As already recommended, Tor Lowry and his Zero-X instructional series are good to watch. I'd recommend the 14 days experiment videos to any beginner.  If you're interested in reading about pool, I recommend Phil Capelle's books, particularly ""Practicing Pool"" which I hope is available in Europe.  The classic books that are often recommended are Ray Martin's 99 Critical Shots in Pool and Robert Byrne's Standard Book of Pool and Billiards.  Hope that gives you something to get started with."

billiards,36hou7,mikelybarger,3,Tue May 19 16:34:14 2015 UTC,"There are a few things you may consider upgrading or replacing.  I am guessing that the cues that came with your table are just standard one-piece house cues, so you may want to purchase a decent two-piece cue that you can take with you when you go play somewhere else.  This will add a level of comfort and consistency.  You'll need to pick one that feels good to you (very subjective).  I wouldn't spend too much money on a cue at first because you are likely to try and acquire new and different cues over time.    Definitely consider upgrading the ball set.  I believe in purchasing the best quality set you can afford, since they will have the tightest manufacturing tolerances with respect to weight and roundness.  Super Aramith Pro is Aramith's top of the line set.  Some people prefer the look of Brunswick Centennials, but they are the same ball as the Super Pros, just with a different look and higher price tag.  You may also want to upgrade/change your rack.  I use ""Don's Rack"" personally and love it, but I am saving my pennies to buy a Delta 13 Elite.  Looks like your cloth is in good shape for now but in the future you may consider a premium worsted cloth from Simonis or Championship.  When I get ready to re-cloth my table, I will be choosing between Simonis 760 and 860HR.  I also plan on getting my subrails extended at that time to tighten the pockets to 4.25""."

Tor vids: He already puts a lot of cool free stuff on YouTube but for $20 his other vids are worth it 3. 99 Critical Shots book 4. Banking with the Beard DVDs   I'd also recommend Anthony Beelers online course. He's very accessible and will analyze any vids you put up promptly.

Diamond Billiards is really nice, and has a cool chip tournament on Friday night (9ball). This would probably be a good way for you to meet a bunch of other shooters, including some of the best people around here. I think they also do an eight ball tournament on Thursdays, but I know that Baja Bean in the fan does(I have heard a lot of people complain about the quality of the tables though). Breakers south-side has a good 9 ball tournament on Saturdays during the day, and has near constant action. Green leaf is really nice, but is pricey, downtown, and I heard of people not being treated all that well there, plus the tables are too close together.

billiards,36ds5o,knomis,3,Mon May 18 16:56:28 2015 UTC,I think playing with just the shaft would be a violation for not meeting the minimum cue length.

I have shot with many different Players cues, and my only gripe is that the designs are just lacquered-over decals instead of actual inlays, but that is to be expected at the entry-level price point.  They play very consistently from cue to cue, and seem to have decent quality control from the manufacturer."

I can say that if you're going to spend $125 on a pool cue, Players is a safe bet to get a quality cue.  Is there a billiard mechanic or supplier in your area that would maybe let you test-hit some cues?  Then you would know what feels best to you.  Choosing a pool cue is a very subjective thing."

I'm sure any cue will feel weird to me at first because I've been using the same shitty one for my whole life, but I'm sure I'll quickly get used to it.  Thanks again for the help!"
billiards,36dy3s,bullitt_60,1 point,Mon May 18 18:43:19 2015 UTC,"I just picked up a Players HXT and I love it. Great quality for the price. The HXT standard shaft has gotten a lot of love here on /r/billiards, and it comes with a kamui tip that didn't need reshaping right out of the box, like a lot of cheap cues. I don't know much about your particular cue that you linked to, but I would suggest taking a look at the HXT and maybe spending $20-30 more on it. That's just based on the HXT's great reputation, though, not from any experience with the G21T1.  And since we're talking about tips here, don't break with your nice fancy new cue. Get a break cue or use a house cue.  Edit: looks like you already started looking at the HXT below. Good on ya."
billiards,36dy3s,ceezaleez,1 point,Mon May 18 20:27:37 2015 UTC,"I have definitely been planning on using my regular house cue to break with, for sure!  I'm just worried about the HXT shaft because of the LD factor. Another user astutely pointed out that my house cues probably have a more ""solid"" shaft and that I may feel weird with the HXT.   At the bar I always grab the heaviest most solid queue so I'm a bit worried about how the LD shaft may feel.   I'm sure the best solution would be for me to just go try them out at a pool shop."
billiards,36dy3s,bullitt_60,1 point,Mon May 18 20:32:29 2015 UTC,"It took me a good 6 hours to just get used to the LD shaft, but I like it better. The tip was the biggest difference, tbh.  Whatever you grab is going to mess up your game for a couple weeks, but will be better in the long run once you have a consistent cue you are using. There's a very good chance you ""won't like"" whatever you try out at the shop because house cues are really just that bad.   Not that ""everyone else does it"" is a great reason, but 18.5-19.5 ounces is a weight that a LOT of very good players use. Not that I am one of those, but I think it's got a good balance of power and finesse. It can be hard to control a 21oz. For some situational awareness: I also used to grab the 21oz house cue. Now I only use them to break, then switch to the 18 or 19oz. It's done a lot to help me with shot placement."

You can order with anything you want, but I suggest a maple shaft with a pro-taper and 13mm dia.  I prefer a harder tip, but I suggest you start in the middle with a Le Pro or similar.    edit - they are also made in America if that floats your boat."
billiards,36dy3s,thecrich,2,Mon May 18 19:07:23 2015 UTC,"I posted this schmelke in another thread. I would go with the 3/8"" 10tpi joint, as it is a good solid pin, and if you decide to get a low deflection or custom shaft it will be easy to find one for that pin.  I agree with the le pro suggestion. I'm not a fan of kamui and don't think they are worth the money. The fact that they had to come out with their own brand of scuffer is pretty telling. The tips get hard and glaze over. That is not the sign of a quality tip."
billiards,36dy3s,thecrich,1 point,Tue May 19 07:09:16 2015 UTC,What are your thoughts on the Kamui Black tips?
billiards,36dy3s,thecrich,2,Mon May 18 19:11:01 2015 UTC,"They are excellent, but in my opinion a soft tip is very distinctive in the way it plays.  If you are working on your game, I suggest something medium or hard and move to a soft tip (if you want) later down the road.  As far as quality is concerned, Kamui is top notch."
billiards,36d1nf,HeartBreakRidge,7,Mon May 18 12:23:30 2015 UTC,"Keep your cue as level as possible and accept the fact that you are stuck using top spin on the shot.  If you can't get the result you want, consider playing a safety instead of trying to pocket the shot.  Don't elevate the cue butt any more than you absolutely have to to perform the shot.  This is important for any shot.  If you elevate the butt of your cue, any unintentional side spin will cause the cue ball to swerve, like a massè shot.  It is also more difficult to visualize the correct contact point on the object ball if you are shooting jacked up.  These shots take lots of practice to get comfortable with."
billiards,36d1nf,petermgates,3,Mon May 18 13:12:50 2015 UTC,"Echoing the other advice so far - shorten up your grip on the butt of the cue, use a shorter stroke and really concentrate on hitting the cue ball in the middle (of the horizontal axis) to avoid any unwanted cue ball deflection.  Also focus on keeping your head as still as possible while shooting, to the extent that your eyes stay frozen on the point of contact, even after the object ball has moved away.  With these shots, you just have to accept that you won't be able to control the cue ball as well as if you could see all of it. Don't try to do too much more than make the ball, especially on mid to long range shots."
billiards,36d1nf,jediofpool,2,Mon May 18 15:48:45 2015 UTC,"Choke up and keep your stroke as short as possible. But maybe more importantly, you can only hit the middle of the cueball. Because you're going to have a natural steep angle, any lefts or rights is going to essentially turn the shot into a massè. Don't try to do too much; because there's only so much you can do with these shots."
billiards,36d1nf,MonsieurX,1 point,Mon May 18 12:38:06 2015 UTC,you meant Chalk instead of choke right? ;)
billiards,36d1nf,TheOneCalledAtlas,3,Mon May 18 12:50:45 2015 UTC,I think he meant to increase the angle relative to the table. Choke up just means to grip further up the cue. Or to cry. Neither is a proper response in this situation.
billiards,36d1nf,jediofpool,1 point,Mon May 18 12:53:33 2015 UTC,Haha. You're right. Chalk up as well!
billiards,36d1nf,MonsieurX,1 point,Mon May 18 12:59:25 2015 UTC,"This is a shot you have to train. Hit firmly with a closed bridge if possible.

billiards,36crjz,megapantsparty,4,Mon May 18 10:34:44 2015 UTC,"I doubt that you cue is defective, Players are a reputable brand. If it is warped though, you should be covered by the manufacturer's warranty.  The Mike Page video that /u/megapantsparty linked to is great information on how spin affects the cue ball's path after contact and part two deals with the cue ball's path after it hits a rail.  In your situation, I would recommend something like Tor Lowry's ball pocketing drills book. That has a system for practicing shots over and over, allowing you to experiment with the adjustments you will need to make to your aim when you add spin. It's really important to be structured in your practice time to get the best value from your investment.  One other thing I would suggest is maybe getting a couple of professional lessons. A pro will quickly diagnose any flaws you have in your aim, stance and cueing which will make your future practice all the more productive."
billiards,36crjz,petermgates,2,Mon May 18 17:00:33 2015 UTC,"It's not the cue, don't worry.  For posture and cueing, I always like to show the carom / 3 cushion way (because that's the way I learnt it). It's not 100% the same for pool, but most things apply, especially for spin shots, since carom is nearly only about playerball control.  If you, for example, watch this: 3 cushion 2014 worldcup  you will notice a few things in the game of these players:   keeping the back of the cue as far down as possible, basically keeping it as level as possible. Any kind of vertical angle on the ball, and it will swerve away. following through / staying with the cue on the table. My mentor always says, that this is how you give ""good quality"" to the ball, which is basically the maximum of spin you can apply. straight posture. Good players nearly always stay with their feet about 45 degrees to the playing ball. This helps you straightening your cue and actually pushing straight, without having to bend yourself away from the cue."
billiards,36crjz,NeverRealNano,2,Mon May 18 11:41:15 2015 UTC,"Lower your stick and practice dead on shots. Plot a straight line from middle diamond to middle diamond. Stroke, follow through, and hold position. When you get it to where that ball is contacting the diamond and coming back to hit your tip, you've got your accuracy, stance, bridge and stroke solidified. From there, use your bridge hand to adjust the english, keeping the butt of your cue low.  As an addendum to that advice, look at lowering your line of sight as well. One of the best pointers I ever got was to lower my stick and my head, using my chin as a fourth point of stability on the cue. Hand, chest, chin, bridge. It's seriously the difference between Storm Troopers and Annie Oakley"
billiards,36crjz,TheOneCalledAtlas,2,Mon May 18 18:00:22 2015 UTC,"Starting out using english, less is more. You will be able to make shots more consistently, and control the ball better if you stay within a tip of center (half a tip would be even better) at a medium or soft speed. Once you get used to using small amounts of english, you can start going farther out from center.   While learning, take note of how the cue ball deflects out and then curves back in due to a slight masse even if your cue is not elevated. Beginners who start using english often have trouble grasping the curve aspect of the shot which is speed and condition dependent and not really covered in depth in beginner instructional materials."

The Predator is pretty solid at most things, a good all-rounder.   I've had a J&J j/b, Lucas's air hog, Predator Air 2, and currently have a Mezz Air Drive.

This how I ended up with a Lucasi Air Hog twice, the original shaft was in the closet most of the time, the butt end was what stayed in my case. Not quite as good for dart stroke IMO, but 1 ball away jumps were as easy as any other jump cue.   The only reason I shifted over to the Mezz was because I got rid of the BK2. The switching between butts never bothered me in play, one of the few times I was thankful for Uniloc."

billiards,364ol6,mikelybarger,13,Sat May 16 02:46:54 2015 UTC,"They are not very close. I have played snooker all my life, and tried out pool (APA) for about a year when I was in the US. Without digging too deep into the details, here are some major differences that make the two games almost incompatible:   Strategy. Winning in snooker comes down to 95% accuracy. If you have stellar long pot accuracy, you can even sacrifice some on position play. This is because it is nearly impossible to consistently run out a snooker table, even for the very top pros. But for pool, position play is probably the more critical component. Someone just posted an APA player running 5 racks in a row. When you have non-pros running racks like it's a routine drill, accuracy alone probably won't get you very far. Cueing. Tying into the previous point, you cue very differently in snooker than in pool. Practicing one won't give you a 1-to-1 translation in improvement for the other. Snooker is a precision sport. You cue to be accurate; not power, position, or control. Are the rest important? Of course. But unless you are almost dead center in the pocket, your shot won't pot. Without pot, the rest is pointless, even potentially harmful. Pool, on the other hand, has significantly more wiggle room when it comes to potting. That's why ""cheating the pocket"" is part of the pool vocabulary, but not of snooker. Because of this, the snooker cueing is more accurate, yet less powerful. If you watch some of the pool matches between snooker players and pool players (Selby vs. Appleton), you will see that snooker player's shots generally lack power. When you practice cueing, the two disciplines require very different practice focuses and routines. Aiming. Snooker jaws are rounded. For me, this makes aiming easier. For pool players, I have heard that this is a nightmare. The opposite is true for me: I have a hard time gauging the aim line on a pool table, because the corners are pointed. This is something you can overcome with time. But when you practice for one, you are getting worse for the other. Your brain can only adapt to one of them. So, while you will improve across the board as you practice, you will be nowhere near as accurate as a pool-only player on a pool table, or as a snooker-only player on a snooker table. This is also exactly why snooker players such as Mark Selby and Neil Robertson compete in Chinese pool, instead of the normal pool. Chinese pool is identical in rules and general play to normal pool, except the tables have snooker-like pockets. Finally, the table. Sure, the pockets and balls are the most noticeable differences. But the cloth friction and rail bounce characteristics are something that will throw your game way off, if you are used to a pool table. To us, pool tables feel ""sticky"", and for pool players, our tables feel like pinball tables to them. So, even if you get all the aiming, cueing, and strategy down, you might find yourself in trouble executing your plan of attack because the balls don't behave anywhere near what you are expecting. As with everything else above, practicing one will likely make the other worse.   With everything said, both are amazing sports. So, just play, have fun, and experiment!"

billiards,364ol6,HappySoda,2,Sat May 16 16:15:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you wrote except one thing:   But when you practice for one, you are getting worse for the other.   As a pool player who is just getting started with snooker, I have to disagree.  When I play snooker for a few hours then go straight to playing pool, I find that I pot many more balls at the pool table.  It's like I can't miss!"
billiards,364ol6,burnt_wick,2,Sat May 16 17:02:33 2015 UTC,"Lol I have heard of that before. I wonder if that's because snooker put you in an accuracy-dominant mode. And when you shift back to pool, that mode lingers around while your natural instinct for position play also kicks in? So basically, you end up temporarily with the best of both worlds?"
billiards,364ol6,HappySoda,2,Sat May 16 17:09:00 2015 UTC,Seems to work that way for me.
billiards,364ol6,burnt_wick,3,Sat May 16 19:46:21 2015 UTC,"Different pocket shapes. Smaller balls. Tighter pockets. Different rules.   You might judge yourself in break and run percentage in a pool game. You might judge yourself on being able to string together any sort of run in snooker.  And honestly, pool cues do NOT cut it for snooker.  Long story short: no. Playing pool will not help your snooker game, other than maybe helping you develop a straight stroke."

billiards,364ol6,captainkirkthejerk,2,Sat May 16 06:50:04 2015 UTC,Haha yeah that actually sounds about right.
billiards,364ol6,petermgates,1 point,Sat May 16 14:01:38 2015 UTC,I say play everything. Do whatever you want. Learn as many different games and variations of rules as you can. It's fun.
billiards,364ol6,SeabrookMiglla,3,Sun May 17 02:01:42 2015 UTC,"I'm going to take a contrarian stance here and say that the fundamentals are the same. You have a cue, two or more balls and a pocket to place them in. You do that is a similar fashion, regardless of the size and shape of the equipment in use.  You can still benefit your snooker game by playing pool regularly but only as long as you appreciate the differences in tactics between the two and recognize that you will still have to have some practice at the snooker table.  You can focus on your fundamentals at the pool table. Adopt a snooker stance, bring your chin closer to the cue and really focus on pocketing balls cleanly - into the 'heart of the pocket.'  Playing straight pool can help you learn the finer points of cue ball control, picking off loose balls before you break open the pack, combinations (plants), dead balls etc.  Spend your snooker practice time on snooker-centric skills - long potting, finding shots-to-nothing, getting the cue ball back into baulk, splitting the pack off the blue or black, bringing balls off the cushion, escaping from snookers etc.  A couple of other things that that weren't mentioned already: snooker cues are constructed differently to pool cues. Aside from being slimmer, the wood used is different and they are weighted far more to the front than pool cues.  Also, the playing surface of a snooker table is higher than that of a pool table (minimum 33.5in vs. 29.25in) and it is definitely noticeable when switching from one to the other."
billiards,364ol6,wefolas,2,Mon May 18 17:49:02 2015 UTC,"just my 2 cents:  i think that snooker fundamentals can be used for playing pool, but i think pool fundamentals are there for a reason.  the main difference is obviously the stance: in snooker you are more squared up on the shot opposite to pool where the cue is more to your hip or side. this has to do with power of the stroke. in snooker, the felt is much faster, which means you usually dont need to hit the balls as hard. in pool the felt is slower, and in a game like 9 ball you especially are having to use a lot of power strokes to get up, down, and around the table using rails. in essence the snooker stance i feel is more used for precision, whereas the pool stance is more geared for less precision and more freedom with the stroking arm.  personally when i play snooker my grip changes, i notice that i tighten up my grip more and dont use my loose grip that i do in pool. you have to be much more conservative with your mechanics in snooker because potting is more difficult with table size and rounded pockets. pool is more about cheating the larger pocket for shape with more stroke with less emphasis on accuracy.   in this sense, having the cue more to the side of you gives your arm more freedom to move but at the same time slight errors can happen in this bigger motion. even in pool though, if i go from playing on a 9 ft table that has big pockets and slow felt, to a 9 ft diamond table that has fast felt and tight pockets, i have to adjust to the table and put more emphasis on potting on the diamond and taking more time.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6NMR3kxoQU steve davis who has is the epitome of text book snooker mechanics vs. steve mizerak who has text book pool mechanics"

billiards,3641n9,gabrielleigh,1 point,Fri May 15 22:59:57 2015 UTC,"So I had a guy bring in an old Meucci butt that had a warped shaft, and he wanted to keep the old shaft intact to preserve the value of the cue. He really liked playing with the old cue, and wanted me to build him a new (and straight!) shaft to go on the butt.  The old Meucci clearcoat had yellowed quite a bit over the last few decades, and I spent all day building a ring billet of Juma and black melamine for the stitches in the ring. I assembled the rings and collar on the new shaft blank, and I was very happy with the accuracy of my reproduction on the ringwork. I nailed all the sizes perfectly, and the pattern looked exactly like the original factory ringwork on the cue. I turned the ringwork down and installed the brass insert for the joint pin, and I test-fit the shaft on the butt and I was not happy with the color matchup for the new material vs. the old yellowed original material.  I pondered how to maybe replicate the yellowed patina of the old finish, and I decided to run out to Walmart and grab a $3.00 bottle of Rit liquid yellow dye from the laundry detergent section. I shook up the bottle really good to make sure the dye was mixed up well, then dabbed some on a folded up paper towel and gave it a quick coat on the lathe as the new shaft was spinning. Whammo! Suddenly my brand new Meucci shaft looked 30 years old! I chuckled out loud as the lathe came to a stop and I could see how it looked with the dye.  It matched perfect. I can't wait to show the customer and have him say ""How in the hell did you make the finish look so old and original?"". I'll post another pic after I finish the shaft and get the clearcoat sprayed on it."

billiards,360owi,throckmortonsign,1 point,Fri May 15 02:41:41 2015 UTC,"You'll be a little jammed with a 13'11"" room.  The reason is you want enough room on both sides of the table to actually stroke the cue.  Most cues are around 5', make it 6' for stroking.  So the width would be:  4' (width of the table) + 6' (cue + stroke on one side) + 6' (cue + stroke on the other side) = 18'.  Similarly the long end of the table is 8' + 6' + 6' = 20', but your room is long enough for that.  So there you go.  Honestly, for a table in my own house, I'd much rather have an 8' table and occasionally have to play with a shorter cue when jammed than have a 7' table."

billiards,35z0fy,RoadHustler,2,Fri May 15 05:52:59 2015 UTC,On the bright side you didn't miss a ball. Of course neither did he...
billiards,35z0fy,mkglass,4,Thu May 14 22:09:34 2015 UTC,"This is why I don't like the APA.  Honestly, he shouldn't be allowed to play any more. When you get to a certain level, they declare that you are a pro, and you are not allowed to play in amateur events.  This guy is not an amateur, if he's doing this consistently."
billiards,35z0fy,ceezaleez,7,Thu May 14 20:24:35 2015 UTC,I would say he out grew the APA.   Being too good for the APA doesn't qualify you as a pro by any stretch of the word.
billiards,35z0fy,mkglass,1 point,Thu May 14 21:28:52 2015 UTC,These are my feelings also. It can't be much fun if there's no competition.   I suppose the idea of coaching players on your team could be appealing but even that will be problematic. I have a friend who played team 9 ball on the same team as Mika Immonen. She said he gave the shittest coaches because what was straightforward for him was unthinkable for a much less skilled player. Apparently he didn't get that.
billiards,35z0fy,burnt_wick,1 point,Thu May 14 21:44:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed... I was speaking in terms of the APA's guidelines.  They consider you a pro if you're ""too good"" to play in the APA.  Doesn't mean you're good enough to beat Shane :)  As I have mentioned a few times... I am not a fan of the APA.  I don't like their restrictions, and I don't like that the handicapping structure is easily manipulated by the players.  It relies on complete honesty of ALL players -- don't get me started on that LOL"
billiards,35z0fy,mkglass,1 point,Thu May 14 21:59:47 2015 UTC,I play in the APA but I'm not familiar with how other leagues handicap players.  How do they do it?
billiards,35z0fy,burnt_wick,2,Fri May 15 04:17:01 2015 UTC,"In the BCA league I play in, you are rated by the number of points you score per night on average.  When I play 5 people, I have a possible 75 points, and I average 50.  All of each teams averages are totalled, and the difference is found between them.  We then multiply this amount by .3, and that's how many points (rounded) the higher-handicapped team has to give to the other.  So... for example, my team has a total handicap of 237.  The opposing team has 176.  The difference is 61, and multiplied by .3, that gives us 18.3.  My team has to give the other team 18 points.  There are a total possible of 75 points per round (15 points per game, 5 racks), so my team has to get 47 points to win the round.  If we get 46, the other team gets 29, which added to the 18 points we have to give them, gives them 47 for the round and they win.  It's a great way to handicap because inning counts don't matter, and the only way you can drop your handicap is by losing games (or, at the very least, giving your opponent more points in the game).  It's a stiff penalty for ""sandbagging."" In the APA, all you have to do is keep playing safe, running up your inning count (and don't record the defensive shot), and your handicap will go down.  Not cool."
billiards,35z0fy,mkglass,1 point,Sat May 16 00:20:49 2015 UTC,"That does sound like a good system.   That said, you are mistaken about how the APA handicap system works.   Running up your inning count with defensive shots won't help you sandbag.   Your inning total equals the number if innings played plus coaches (each coach one extra inning) MINUS the number of safety shots taken.   The only way playing extra safes is going to work is if both scoresheets do not record safes.   I record all safe shots. If the other captain hands me a sheet without safe shots recorded, I won't sign it."
billiards,35z0fy,burnt_wick,2,Sat May 16 00:44:31 2015 UTC,"That's good that you do. I did too. But many people are not honest, and do not record their safeties. The equalizer system only works if everyone is honest. And not everyone is.   I was a good 7 in 8-ball and 9 in 9-ball. And I got my ass handed to me by 5's in Vegas. This isn't sour grapes... I have heard captains tell their players to sandbag. The handicap should not be so easily manipulable."
billiards,35z0fy,mkglass,1 point,Sat May 16 05:51:32 2015 UTC,"I think you're right. It's too easy to try to manipulate the system, and all that is required is that the other captain is a lazy scorekeeper. Most are.   That said, all I know is my division. The system works overall. Players who have been playing for 2 seasons are ranked properly.   A more objective system that is less dependent on human due diligence/honesty is certainly preferable."
billiards,35z0fy,elint,2,Sat May 16 06:06:15 2015 UTC,"Yes... my division was good, too, for the most part.  There were some who tried to sandbag, but we had enough honest captains (including me) who would keep them in line.  I've heard stories of league operators who actually encouraged their teams to ""manipulate"" the system.  And I believe them, too, because when you get to Vegas, you suddenly see people who can play lights out pool -- I mean those that shouldn't play APA -- and they're rated as 5's.  It was crazy.  Some get punished by having members jump 2 handicaps (and thereby disqualifying them), but most slip through the cracks.    The APA is good for what they advertise -- a way to get people together to have a good time.  They are all about recruiting new players, and punishing old ones. They are the Comcast of pool :)  Personally, I'll stick with BCA and ACS.  In fact, my next article is going to be about the ACS Championships in Vegas.  I was VERY impressed."
billiards,35z0fy,sphigel,2,Mon May 18 15:20:24 2015 UTC,"In my local BCA league, nobody is handicapped.  Your five players play one rack each against each of their five players.  The team with the best five players usually wins.  At higher-level tournaments, the top few percentage of players are designated as BCA Masters, and you may only have one master on a team.  Players are ranked in our league, but the ranking doesn't affect team points -- it's just for a cash payout for the ""league MVP"" at the end of the season."

billiards,35ssyk,gabrielleigh,2,Wed May 13 09:30:00 2015 UTC,My Diamond table and and chairs were like $6800 with all the bells and whistles. If I had another $6k to drop on stuff I'd add it to my pool travel/gambling fund. Currently I use the money I win at local tourneys to help pay to travel to bigger ones. Adding $6k to that would be a nice cushion. I already have all the gear I need.   I've considered getting a nice higher end cue like a Black Boar. I would only use it at home though because I don't enjoy worrying about babysitting an expensive cue at pool halls.
billiards,35ssyk,thepottsy,2,Wed May 13 16:04:14 2015 UTC,"Local cue maker makes some amazing custom cues, I'd probably spend 5-600 or so on a good cue from him with a spare shaft.  Then I would use the rest of the money for beer at my local pool hall.  That's pool stuff, right?"

billiards,35ssyk,ThisIsDennis,1 point,Thu May 14 07:24:35 2015 UTC,"To be fair, there's still a chance you could pick up something half decent after an event for that sort of money.  The difference with American prices and UK prices is because they don't import nearly as many snooker tables to the states. It's the other way around in the UK. If you wanted to buy a diamond table over here it would cost you a fortune unless you're buying a shipping container full of them. That's why most pool halls overy here end up full of Sam K steels."

But this made me curious, are major manufacturers cues made with robots or is it just a cue maker who sold out for a steady cheque and thus puts company logos on the cue instead of his own mark. I value the company man somewhat less than the entrepreneur, but just furthering the devils advocate and curious myself of how it all works"
billiards,35rb64,gotwired,1 point,Wed May 13 06:51:18 2015 UTC,"Depends on the company. Schon, I belive is pretty much custom in regards to build process, with only a few makers turning out set designs of cues. A bigger brand like Predator probably has an assembly line in China with one person doing one specific job in the production of a cue. I doubt any cue makers use robots like a car maker would. The closest thing would be a CNC machine, but the actual assembly of the cue is probably too delicate to leave to most robots"
billiards,35rb64,RoadHustler,2,Wed May 13 10:12:59 2015 UTC,"but the actual assembly of the cue is probably too delicate to leave to most robots   You'd be surprised just how delicate and accurate robotics can be. But nonetheless, they can't replace human judgement, so that's probably the reason why they aren't used in the cue-making process."
billiards,35rb64,HappySoda,1 point,Wed May 13 20:49:20 2015 UTC,"Is Schon custom?  Or ""handmade""?  I think that is a distinction that is lost in pool today.  I can go buy a Schon off the shelf.  I have to order a cue from Brent Summers and it can be 1 of a kind if I choose for it to be."
billiards,35rb64,SirNoobs,1 point,Wed May 13 14:42:09 2015 UTC,"If you go by that definition, it would probably e considered hand made, but I think most people refer to it as semi-custom."

billiards,35ptg8,moccabee,6,Tue May 12 14:56:15 2015 UTC,"The woods selected for this cue build will have a pretty big influence on the feel and hit of the final build. The rosewood, ebony, coco, and purpleheart are all very dense and heavy and will generally provide a very firm and solid feel when used in the forearm. The leopardwood and curly maple are generally quite a bit softer and will lend a bit more of a mellow feel to the cue. Leopardwood is gorgeous and will produce a beautiful spotted pattern, but keep in mind the leopardwood is often very porous and light. The feel of leopardwood in the forearm will probably be a bit more muted than the other woods, even more so than the curly maple.   None of these different ""feels"" are better than the other, but they are definitely different between the woods. If you have a familiarity with the feel of any of these particular woods and you like that feel, I'd be tempted to select the one that contributes that kind of known positive influence on the recipe. Any of these woods will be beautiful, for sure.   The denser woods (if used in the forearm) will also shift the balance point of this cue forward, too. Players have very different preferences for where they like the weight of the cue to fall. Some prefer the bulk of the weight to rest in their hand that holds the cue, others like the balance to be more forward so more weight is felt in the bridge hand.   This is a very cool idea and I'll be excited to see how it all turns out!"

billiards,35ptg8,nusi42,2,Tue May 12 15:51:37 2015 UTC,"The Homer (from Simpsons wikia):       Thanks to Homer's dislike of the cars Herb's company was creating, Herb decided his company needed a new car that would appeal to the ""average"" American. Unfortunately, Homer's views on an ideal car was much different than that of an average American. Despite the many objections of Herb's employees, Herb encouraged Homer to follow his instincts in creating a car that American consumers would want to buy. Homer took charge of the project after Herb encouraged him to obey his gut when it came to what kind of car he wanted. Unfortunately, Homer's creation was such a monstrously strange car, cost so much to develop, and had such a high price tag (Approximately $82,000), that Herb's car company went out of business shortly after, with its building purchased by Komatsu Motors. When The Simpsons were driving back to Springfield, Bart told a dejected Homer he thought it was pretty cool.

billiards,35ptg8,asamimasa,1 point,Wed May 13 13:39:09 2015 UTC,"Stiffness gets affected. For example, snooker shafts are usually made of ash, and are stiffer than maple shafts we get for billiards. Sometimes you get different constructions for different purposes, most visibly in the Mezz Deep Impact Pro shafts, where the R shaft is ash at the joint, and runs through the core of a maple shaft. The H variant uses Massaranduba wood, and looks very strange. Supposedly a slight bit stiffer than the R, and significantly heavier (just under 4oz. vs. >5oz I believe).   I have a cheapo ash snooker cue in the closet, and grain feels much more raised than maple shafts, which is to say, you can feel more grooves with your nail. I've also heard reports that beards snag on ash shafts."

I'm on an island for vacation right now. These tables and similar outdoor tables are everywhere. At a ridiculous 2 euros per game, I only played one game just to try it out. Your enjoyment really depends on what you want out of the table. I had fun playing on it on the beach, but I probably wouldn't have so much fun if it were a league match."
billiards,35r1m2,HappySoda,2,Wed May 13 01:16:30 2015 UTC,"Interesting product, for sure. They use slate beds, which is good. They use standard rubber rails which is good. The only parts I am unfamiliar with are how the table cloth plays. They use some kind of ""Sunbrella"" cloth according to their website, and I'd suspect it will play a lot different than Simonis or other common cloths found on indoor tables. Aside from the cloth, the construction of the table bases are something I have never seen in person either. If they are square and braced well and wont bend or flex over time, then I'd say this brand of table could potentially perform very well. If you spent some money and had good cloth put on it (for indoor use), I'd be surprised if you could even tell much of a difference between it and regular indoor tables.   As you gain experience with pool, you develop a familiarity with the tiny little nuanced differences in the way the different brands of tables play. There is a good chance this brand of table will have a different personality compared to the more well-known brands like Brunswick, Diamond, Valley, Olhausen, and the other big brands. I'd be tempted to try to spend some time playing on one before I made the commitment to buy one. Table purchases are expensive and moving them is difficult and often very expensive, too. Make sure you feel really good about any table before you blow the time and money to bring it into your home! Let us know how it works out if you end up buying one, I'd love to hear your feedback on them."
billiards,35r1m2,gabrielleigh,1 point,Wed May 13 15:49:11 2015 UTC,"Now that's a better response.  It's the nuances that I am wondering about.

It's really a fact finding mission for me, I'm actually surprised there doesn't seem to be more experimentation with table materials. Like different courts in tennis.   Your right though, if it's the same construction, it might come down to the cloth as the big difference.   Thanks for your answer."

billiards,35r1m2,RoadHustler,1 point,Wed May 13 12:35:48 2015 UTC,It's all about that quality of play brother haha
billiards,35r1m2,robandrobbie1,1 point,Wed May 13 02:54:15 2015 UTC,"The one major factor that will influence outdoor play is the weather. Sunlight will cause the playing surface to heat up which can cause it to expand and possibly warp (temporarily from thermal expansion), also the steel construction of the base will expand and contract with heat quite a bit, and humidity is a bigger factor for outdoor tables. Keeping the table shaded and out of direct sunlight and rain will help with the consistency. Your best luck will be on a covered patio or porch, or under a carport possibly. Exposure to direct sunlight and rain/dew will generally result in a table that is very hard to keep level since it shrinks and expands quite a bit as the sun rises and sets. One of the most appealing things about pool is finding a table that is consistent and predictable so you can really ""fine tune"" your game to the table as you get to know it. Outdoor tables present the biggest challenges to this due to the inherent changes they go through from exposure to the elements. I think I could probably tune myself into an outdoor table pretty easily, but I think I'd be constantly adjusting my speed and english to make up for the changes in the table that will happen throughout the day each day."

billiards,35j7jk,DreadrickTaitum,3,Sun May 10 22:13:15 2015 UTC,"At first only start  out using about a tip of english or less. You don't have to compensate a lot for one tip and it is all that that is required for probably 90%  of shots with english. Once you get good at using a single tip, you can go out further.  Take note of the effect curve has on how much you have to compensate. The farther the distance, higher elevation, grabbier the cloth, and/or slower the speed of your shot, the less you have to compensate for english.  Often times at medium-slow speeds, you don't have to compensate at all because the curve cancels out the deflection (or you have to compensate in the opposite direction because there is more curve than deflection). Long shots with english are much easier if you are familiar with using the speed at which curve cancels out deflection.  Make sure you are stroking the ball and hitting it in exactly the place you want. A pokey stroke can lead to unintended elevation on your shot that will increase curve and make it more difficult to compensate. An inaccurate stroke will make it difficult to judge how much you have to compensate because you don't know exactly how much english you are applying."

billiards,35h1mm,caprirs302,1 point,Sun May 10 15:26:39 2015 UTC,Check out custom cue makers in your area.  That price range is perfect for a nice sneaky pete or plain-Jane cue from a custom  maker that would be much higher quality than any production cue at the same price point.   Also keep an eye on azbilliards or any of billiards marketplace facebook pages.  Don't be afraid to buy a cue secondhand.  A properly cared for cue will last for decades.

billiards,35h1mm,slorebear,1 point,Sun May 10 15:14:10 2015 UTC,"I've seen/purchased many custom cues in that price range.  Good friend of mine bought a Phillipi sneaky Pete for 250 brand new.  No inlays or ring work, just a nice solid cocobola into maple cue, wood to wood joint, white buttcap, and a solid, consistent hit.  I paid 300 for a used Leon Sly s/p 6 or 7 years ago.  Ebony into maple with a hoppe ring and white phenolic/brass rings at the joint.  The nice thing about this cue is that the finish is so well done that it still looks brand new even after years of use.  Custom cue makers often make sets of basic cues and sell in that price range to pay the bills between the fun high-end stuff.  It has been my experience that a basic custom cue in the 200-300 range will be a better playing, better built cue than a production cue in the same range."

The Samsara guys absolutely blow my mind with the woodwork they come up with. When I first got into building, I'd spend hours looking at their cues wondering ""how in the hell did they do that?!?!"". It is damn near impossible to do anything in the cuemaking world that is truly new or innovative. Virtually everything most builders do (including me) is a re-hash or an adaptation of something that was inspired by past makers. The Samsara guys have done many, many things that simply had never been done before. And they do those things with a level of perfection that has earned them the legendary reputation they have now.   Those are some gorgeous poles, and I bet they all play amazing. Nice collection for sure."
billiards,35e1i8,gabrielleigh,1 point,Sat May 9 13:54:55 2015 UTC,"These are the tip of the iceberg honestly. I have a guy that gives me cues to shoot with, and these are just the ones I'm currently playing with, plus plain sledgehammer break cue that I didn't bother putting in here. I'm getting ready to go play, but if theres interest I'll open some more cases later this evening or tomorrow and show some more of them.   Samsara makes some gorgeous cues, but the shafts are all like tree trunks. I have to get them turned down to be able to play with them. they are simply too stiff for my preference. They break good though.   I'll probably pull out a few from Mike Lambros next. They aren't as intricate as these, but they are very good players. Theres a few more Gulyassy customs in there, a few more Schicks, Samsaras, etc. After hitting with a bunch of them I have to say that nothing tops the hit of any of the Schicks in my opinoin."
billiards,35e1i8,gabrielleigh,2,Sat May 9 14:00:39 2015 UTC,"I hear a lot of compliments on Shicks. I have played with a lot of customs, and I tend to prefer the feel of the ones who are made by cuemakers who also tend to be really strong players, too. I belong to some groups of cuemakers and I get the feeling that quite a few of them are pretty casual players who occasionally jump into tournaments and do the league stuff. I know Gulyassy comes from a really strong pool background, and I always wonder about how some of the other highly respected builders play.   Mr. Schick gets truckloads of praise everywhere I see his work mentioned, and I have always wondered how much pool he plays. I'd bet he has a really strong game due to the popularity of his work."
billiards,35e1i8,gabrielleigh,1 point,Sat May 9 14:24:24 2015 UTC,"Schick is in his 70s now, but I was told that he won the Louisiana state tournament a few years ago. He used to be on the road with Buddy Hall way back when as his road partner. I was once told a story that they tried to track down Mizerack to tell him he couldn't play a lick, and that they had five grand that he could take from them if they were wrong lol.   He owns a pool room in Shreveport, and his cue shop is located inside of it from what I've been told. I imagine he probably gets to hit a ball fairly often to stay sharp. Fun fact, he is considered one of the top American cue makers by a lot of people, but he doesn't use his own products. He shoots with a Balabushka.   Since I've seen you on here, I've asked around in my area (central Ga) but I haven't been able to find anyone familiar with your work. I know I like the looks of your cues, and hopefully one day I'll be able to try one on for size."
billiards,35e1i8,JMizzo,2,Sat May 9 14:57:52 2015 UTC,"Hah, that doesn't surprise me that he owns a room. I figured he must play strong to have such an intimate knowledge of how to make good cues. That is funny he uses a bushka."

billiards,35arvu,gabrielleigh,2,Fri May 8 15:24:30 2015 UTC,"This is Graceful Wench. She has been my ""test bed"" for about five or six years now. I think I have been through about four different shafts on this girl since I finished her up in 2010.   I put her together along with a matching jump/break cue that I have since retired, but the playing butt is setup exactly how I like regarding weight, balance, and all the other stuff you feel.   She has a flamed maple forearm with black paper veneered purpleheart sills. I used some nice zebrawood for the handle, but covered up most of it with the leather wrap. I was trying to keep the total cue weight between 16-17 ounces, and the zebrawood helped me control weight in this build, but it was a shame to cover it all up in my opinion.   I tossed in a brass Radial pin for some mid-cue balancing and the sexy looks. The ringwork really shines on this ol' girl. I used some guitar building ""purfling"" inlay strips to make the ring billets for this set. Also used some emerald Dymondwood in the rings as well. Lots of silver rings, too. Capped off each end with some nice white composite collars and buttcaps for indestructable durability. I knew this ol' girl would get rode hard and put up wet, so I didn't want her breaking down on me from using cheap plastic parts anywhere. I generally never use any thermoform plastic in my cues unless I am doing a repair on a customer cue and I have to match up a broken or missing part with the other plastic parts on the cue. For my own builds, nothing but phenolics and composites are used.   I ended up settling on one of my Ultralite LD shafts, and all the other shafts I built for this cue ended up going on other cues. So for now, I am down to only one shaft unless I decided to throw together another one for a backup. This shaft is 2.2 ounces and 11.4mm with a super-stretched pro taper. A phenolic ferrule and a Kamui black SS tip sit on top.   I have been runnin' her hard for the last half a decade, and I am about to retire her and start working on a new set for myself. She has treated me well, though. I have won literally hundreds of tournaments with her. She has got me through quite a bit of action outside of the tournaments, too. She will always have a special place in my heart."

billiards,35arvu,RoadHustler,1 point,Fri May 8 22:51:11 2015 UTC,"The stacked leather gets installed in a slightly deeper wrap channel than linen.

So hearing him reason taught me that i also suck at planning and my shots could all be way easier if i spent time on that instead of cut drills that make me angry."

billiards,354jhy,asamimasa,1 point,Thu May 7 07:36:50 2015 UTC,"Also worth noting there is two ways to watch pros play. Passive and active. Meaning when I watch nine ball to try and gleen some of the pros positional knowledge, I pause the video on a position and try to figure out how they will run out the next few balls, and then resume and see what they did in comparison to my guess. I find this is the only way I can really take away something tangible from what they are doing. They are so good they almost instantly know the best pattern. And if I watch it in real time it goes by so fast,  it seems like efren just gets lucky rolls alllll day"
billiards,354jhy,mattdebrown,3,Thu May 7 18:51:07 2015 UTC,"there are many instructional videos and books out there, along with hundreds of hours worth of competitive pool on youtube. the tor lowry videos are definitely a good starting point to learn the fundamentals. along with http://billiards.colostate.edu/ start with the basics and learn good physical form/mechanics. everything starts there, and even the most advanced players go back to square 1 of basics and tweak their mechanics. i look back and realized that this is a very important time for developing good habits. also learn the tangent line, this is very key to success. but the more you practice the more you will learn, especially if you're around better players.  i think the main thing is to have fun and enjoy yourself while you're learning. if you practice a lot, in the first 6 months or so you'd be surprised how much you will grow. some practice drills in this game can be very boring and tedious but they will help you develop consistency. each drill teaches you a certain aspect of the game.  but do what keeps you enjoying the game."

billiards,354jhy,petester,2,Thu May 7 04:44:24 2015 UTC,"i ran into the same exact problem whenever i first was shown these videos. i think that you have noticed something, and have answered your own question. you have listened and understood certain key concepts but: executing these concepts on a consistent basis, is quite another animal. it is what separates players of all ranges from each other. memorization of certain shots, scenarios, themes of shots, and finally the physical act of the shot itself. pool is a precision game, and requires attention to detail at the highest level.  i myself recognize what needs to be done, but execution is completely different. many times it goes right down to the basic break down of fundamentals and thought process of what needs to happen...you need to be sound in what you are doing to the most minute detail. some days it comes easy with no thought, and other days it is not so simple. i personally feel that there is an interesting balance of knowledge and feel in this game.  although as in anything the more you practice, the better you will become. especially whenever you are aware of these many factors with mechanics and mental aspects. but you also need some direction, and also competition to improve. being around better players or knowledgeable people who you connect well with is very important."

billiards,354nf9,dalgeek,2,Sun May 10 20:08:48 2015 UTC,"Sound advice. You might not run out this way every time but you're drastically decreasing the possible permutations of run outs available essentially removing the mental road block that you're experiencing.   Like most pool fundamentals, you may not see the results right away but you're building proper strategic fundamentals this way; the dividends will pay off in time."
billiards,354nf9,sfc949,7,Thu May 7 06:54:14 2015 UTC,"I have always viewed 8 ball as a game of patience. I play 8 ball with a lot of the same strategy I employ in one pocket because I consider both games to be a ""contest to see who can make the fewest mistakes"".   With every shot in eight ball, one of the first things I evaluate is whether the conditions on the table are statistically viable for a run out or not. I spend a few moments looking at the various patterns and lines to get around the table. If the run out looks highly probable, I begin building a more detailed road map of how I will move to get to each ball. If the run out is simply not there, or the run out would include breaking out balls or other conditions that are difficult to predict the outcome of, then I generally shift gears and enter a defensive mindset.   With every turn at the table, my main goal is to improve the relative situation of my set compared to my opponents set of balls. This can be accomplished by offensive play such as pocketing balls, or with strategic play by carefully breaking out your balls while hooking your opponent to prevent them from seeing a favorable position when they return to the table. Sometimes you can even take opportunities to cluster their set to cause additional problems in their runouts. Either way, your goal should be to make some type of general improvement in the relative layouts of your set compared to their set.   I generally use a roughly-estimated statistical evaluation of each potential shot choice to determine how I play my turn. I know my own strengths and weaknesses, and often I know my opponent's strengths and weaknesses as well. I pick the shot (offensive or defensive) that gives me what I feel is the highest statistical chance to predict the outcome accurately. I look around the table and find a handful of really bad ""zones"" which offer my opponent minimal shot opportunities. I decide which of these zones is easiest to get to, and I compare the location of these zones with subsequent shots in my run out patterns. Anytime I shoot offensive shots to pocket my balls, I make an effort to play shape for my next shot inside one of these zones that would be rough for my opponent to shoot out of. I am not a particularly good shot maker due to my poor eyesight, so I have to consider the chance I will miss any shot and let my opponent back to the table. If you have the choice to let them back to the table in a favorable location or from a hooked location, why not build this into your run out pattern? I miss quite a bit more than I'd like to admit, and I often hear complaints from my opponents that they never seem to have a shot after I miss. The less experienced opponents attribute this to me being ""lucky"", but my friends who know me well understand that this is an integral part of my shot-selection process. Sure, I occasionally let whitey get away and I bobble a ball and catch a good roll, but more often than not my defensive play is carefully built into my offensive shot making attempts and it saves my bacon if I happen to miss.   Study your opponent, and keep track of the types of mistakes they are making during your session with them. If they keep firing bank shots just an inch short, let them go back to the table with more bank shots when you have to play defense. Like I said at first, these games are contests to see who can make the fewest mistakes. Tempt your opponents with opportunities to make those mistakes, and be conscious of when they tempt you with the same things. Avoid those ""hero or zero"" shots, they hurt you way more often than they help you. For every amazing, game-changing shot you do make... there are probably dozens you missed that cost you those games.   Eight ball is often won by the player who keeps their game simple and smart. On bar boxes, it really is anyone's game. Luck plays a huge factor in what you get to shoot at each time you go to the table. You can't do anything about the luck, so tune that part of the game out of your head and don't waste a single second worrying or being upset by it. Focus on the aspects of the game you can control, such as the shots you choose to shoot and the odds you can control the outcomes and predict the layout accurately when the balls come to a stop."

billiards,354nf9,petermgates,2,Thu May 7 10:55:02 2015 UTC,"Watch more videos - I like to watch pro vids on youtube.  I know I can't shoot like them, but I get to see the process and have better long-term vision now because I know what kinds of leaves are possible off each shot. I've seen an improvement in my game - I can usually finish a game in 3 innings where I used to take 6 or 7. Most of that is due to improved leaves and shot selection."

Over time you'll find you know more and more.
billiards,354nf9,Pip_Pip,1 point,Thu May 7 08:46:29 2015 UTC,Good advice. I like to pause the video after the break and see if the pattern I choose is the same as the player shooting.
billiards,354nf9,petermgates,1 point,Thu May 7 21:10:50 2015 UTC,"The other hidden improvement to doing this is that many people don't actually thinking about the whole rack, shot to shot.  They play ball to ball hoping things will work out when they get to the end.  When you start thinking in this manner you can't help but try to be precise.  If you aren't, then there is a flaw you need to work on.  Instead of adjusting the optimal way to play for what you lack, play optimally until your skills catch up."
billiards,354nf9,Pip_Pip,1 point,Fri May 8 02:12:32 2015 UTC,When I am considering shot options with the goal of running a rack knowing the opportunity is there with how the balls laid out I use one major general rule of thumb.  Which shot will likely leave the cue all towards the center of the table. This simply -- in my experience -- gives me the highest probability of staying out of trouble.  With that in mind I tend to find shots that reduce the opportunity for the cue ball to run wild: aka aggressive angle shots unless I'm comfortable using the rails without bumping balls.  Systematically this has helped me with my success rates. If I'm in a situation where the likelihood of keeping control of the cue ball is against me I prefer to keep my balls up on the table and hide behind anything I can to force a ball in hand situation so I can improve my odds.  The worst for me is running most of the rack and then leaving a wide open table for my opponent. There is a lot more room for error with someone who has a solid pocketing ability.
billiards,354nf9,universrevinu,1 point,Thu May 7 04:28:20 2015 UTC,"Starting out playing, i was always told to be thinking of 3 shots at a time.   number 1, the ball you want to make. Number 2, The next ball you want to make plus the position on that ball to leave you the position on ball number 3. As you pot, then you keep adding in a new number 3 ball as at where!.  I found this helped when i started out, however as i developed my ability i found it hindered me as i was overthinking things and have learned that, at least for me, is to have more of a general idea of how i will run the balls.  One other good piece of advice i received was to try and break out difficult balls early. Dont leave it until your last free ball before you try to break it out, if you miss the breakout on your last free shot you have no  next shot. This of course doesnt apply if you are trailing the match and going to break out the 8 for your opponent!"

billiards,354nf9,dickskittles,2,Thu May 7 12:31:16 2015 UTC,"Paying per ball left on the table is not a good way to improve your shot selection.  If you run all your balls without leaving a shot on the 8, this is a fine strategy in your game, as you guarantee you won't have to pay anything.  It's absolutely the worst thing you can do in regular 8-ball, though."
billiards,354nf9,R3dw0lF,1 point,Thu May 7 15:56:29 2015 UTC,"I think in the long run it will/might, depending on who he's playing missing might end up costing him.  Running out a rack will be benificial for himself and his wallet so he should look for the run out, however it shouldn't be the only technique he uses to improve shot selection as this doesn't help selection itself but more as 'punishment' for doing it wrong (learn fast or pay up). Plus it can help simulate 'high' stress levels similar to tournaments (depending on your budget :))"

billiards,34yedp,OrangeTooth,7,Tue May 5 17:27:05 2015 UTC,The long time was our fault. My partner and I ran the tournament. We did not properly gauge how long matches would take. We certainly were not ready for 90 minutes to two hours for some matches. And then we had one match on the one loss side that went even longer and that backed everyone up.   Next month will be shorter races on the bar boxes.

I took the owner's initials (TD) and drew up a celtic/tribal design using the letters and made a pretty sweet design for the inlay.

Jump/break cue to go with it, all the same stuff on it pretty much. Should be a sick set."

billiards,34wiw5,outside_english,3,Tue May 5 03:28:34 2015 UTC,"Frey, Sly, Jacoby,  and Josey all come to mind.   Whatever you end up getting, I'd encourage you to get one of the maker's own shafts as well. You get the chance to see how their own workmanship performs as opposed to having just a fancy butt for the same old OB shafts. In addition, it will be much easier to sell the cue if you have it paired with an original maker shaft later if you decide you want something different later down the line."
billiards,34wiw5,EtDM,1 point,Tue May 5 14:23:31 2015 UTC,That is good advice probably for others.  I however will never be selling the cue.  I probably wouldn't use the stock shaft either.  I love OB and trust their shafts.  Thanks for the tip though.

billiards,34wiw5,BlackLabLover,2,Tue May 5 20:45:55 2015 UTC,"SirNoobs is right, it's subjective.  But I got a very simple custom cue with 2 shafts from Keith for about $600. For the quality, aesthetics and service, I would've paid twice that much."

billiards,34w2le,HappySoda,2,Tue May 5 05:12:16 2015 UTC,That is a really cool idea nice work.  On another point what do you folks think about Bingham using a sight right cue in competition with its built in aiming device. I think the sight right is totally amazing and cant wait to order one to try out. That said its kinda a game changer in terms of body positioning and alignment tech.

I definitely would like to try one out and see if it changes anything. I don't think it would require me to change my stance, so that's good. But since it starts at £149, I doubt I can justify buying one, unless it seriously changes my game or I win the lottery."

billiards,34ttic,jesandma,13,Mon May 4 14:43:51 2015 UTC,"Most pockets on casual tables (home or bar) are the width of two balls (an American pool ball is 2 1/4 inches wide, so typical pockets are 4.5 inches wide though this isn't a hard and fast rule as OP's image shows).  Some tables are even a quarter inch wider than that (gotta keep the games moving and quarters dropping with easy pockets).  Some professional tournaments will use shimmed pockets that are narrower, for instance the bonus ball league used very tight pockets that I think were under 4 inches wide (3 7/8 I think).  But that still has nothing on Snooker pockets around the world in the UK, Chinese 8-ball and Australia.  The jaws of those pockets are rounded, effectively making the pockets play even smaller by rejecting balls that would fall on an American table.  So, long story short, two ball width is a general rule, but by no means is it standard.  Always take two balls and check the pockets on any table before you start shooting to get an idea of what you are getting yourself into."
billiards,34ttic,wheelsno3,1 point,Mon May 4 16:05:57 2015 UTC,"I might be in the minority here, but I think pool pockets are harder than snooker pockets. My accuracy goes to hell on pool tables. Snooker pockets might be smaller, but aiming is easier because you can see the pockets past the rounded jaws. At least that's my go to excuse when people ask me why I'm so terrible at pool."
billiards,34ttic,HappySoda,1 point,Tue May 5 03:46:58 2015 UTC,"Middle pockets on a snooker table play a little easier than side pockets on a tight pool table.  But corner pockets are definitely way tougher on a snooker table, even if the pool table in question is very tight.  Especially when shooting down the rail.  You're just out of your comfort zone on a pool table, which is enough to make you miss in any cuesport."
billiards,34ttic,dickskittles,1 point,Wed May 6 14:44:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pool is definitely out of my comfort zone. I tried to play it more often for about a year, but I just couldn't get a hang of it. That was two years ago. I think the last time I played pool was around New Year's, 5 months ago. Even then, I played pool with a snooker cue. My eyes warp pool cues, because they are so wide :P  It's funny you brought up rail shots. I do that in snooker all the time, even in tournaments. It's one of my more accurate shots. In pool? I don't dare trying it even if the ball is one diamond away from the corner pocket. What's even funnier is I do just fine on a Chinese pool table, which is identical to a normal pool table, just with snooker pockets. I think pool pockets just don't really register right in my mind with their pointy corners."

billiards,34sjye,sleepwalken,2,Mon May 4 04:54:37 2015 UTC,"So here's the rundown on the GS series. From what I can tell it's just an entry-level McDermott, not dissimilar to the entry level Players cues you see a lot. It's not sporting any spectacular features, exotic woods or intricate designs. I personally wouldn't spend $200 on a GS, especially used when the MSRP starts at $210. I recommend taking a look at the Players HX series for something you'll probably get more accuracy out of. The HX shaft is a decent performing low-deflection shaft at a very reasonable starting price (Roughly $150 new).  http://www.billiardwarehouse.com/cues/players/players-hxt-series-pool-cues.htm  Just to say, it's not too expensive for a McDermott, but it's too expensive for a no-frills beginner's cue. Now, if you like McDermott, check out the G204  http://www.cheapcues.com/McDermott_Pool_Cues_G204.asp  It's $15 more expensive and actually has the G-series shaft on it. Set that up with a tip for your playstyle and you'll be good to go.  If you need any help picking out a good beginner's cue and you don't wanna spam this thread, feel free to send me a PM.

billiards,34rn46,JonLivestrong,1 point,Mon May 4 02:42:43 2015 UTC,Care to explain the difference between splice and inlays?
billiards,34rn46,gabrielleigh,1 point,Mon May 4 04:51:36 2015 UTC,"A full splice cue is made of two pieces of wood, and the points are what typically is holding the cue together. Easy example would be a bar cue.  Inlay means a groove was cut out, and a material was glued in its place. Typically inlaid points, or short splice, are made of multiple parts assembled together, usually cored or with threaded parts.   What makes this cue so awesome, is that it is actually 4 sets of 4 full splice points, most with 4 veneers. Points are sharp in each direction with the handle wood being fully spliced into both other sections. This is all done by hand, no cnc cutting. Not many cue makers could do this cue this perfectly, or at all. Everything lines up perfectly. It is nice example of great old world craftsmanship.   I am sure /u/gabrielleigh could explain it better than myself."
billiards,34rn46,redditis4queers,1 point,Mon May 4 05:39:07 2015 UTC,"That is pretty much it. Due to the surface area that is glued in a full splice, it is one of the strongest ways to join two pieces of wood. It takes some pretty accurate machine work to create the splice. One half is precision milled using a milling machine, the other half is carefully sawn using a band saw. Most makers have some very precise jigs attached to the mill and saw to make these cuts as accurately as possible. The forearm and handle can be directly glued together as-is, or veneers can be added like with this cue for an even prettier result. Lots of work, and definitely one of the coolest ways a cue can be put together for sure."

Otherwise you'd have to be seeing pockets if it were uncovered and just had no felt. In that case the rails would have to be higher and there should cushions.

billiards,34nsta,JMizzo,3,Sun May 3 00:59:46 2015 UTC,"Looks to me like a late 60's, early 70's Brunswick Monticello. If it was older than this, it wouldnt be marked just Brunswick with the B logo.

I've worked on a few older tables with bigger slates and maybe 1.5-2"" backed is about the limit even that is ridiculous. It's also not worth close to what you've been told.  The market for older tables is very tiny so it takes an insanely well kept table with something that makes it pretty unique to be worth figures that high.

Which for me meant that I shape the tip down a layer. I had that actually a lot before I switched to the slightly more expensive kamui tips. Which in the end came down to that I had to replace my tip more often.  This leads me to the second point. I had the feel, that the hardness-level of, especially triangle tips vary a lot from batch to batch.  I never had that with Kamui, I rather spend EUR 3-4 more on a tip than have it removed 2 month in because the ""soft"" tip feels like a hard one all of a sudden ..."
billiards,34o4bx,grlldcheese87,2,Sat May 2 23:21:06 2015 UTC,My favorite shaft is bare wood with a bit of wax maybe. I like to let it age with the natural oils in my hands. I don't think it's a problem to sand the clear coat off in general. Doing it on a lathe would keep it consist. Also if it's a inferior piece of wood it might start warping I guess. /u/gabrielleigh can probably give you much more info.
billiards,34o4bx,fadedcheese,2,Sun May 3 01:43:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the assurance.  I know I'm risking it a little, but they're cheap cues to begin with.  I think China is reaching the tipping point in quality.  If the Chinese factory can make decent stuff, so be it.  My replacement dream cue if i screw this up is just nicer cuetec stuff from China."
billiards,34o4bx,gabrielleigh,2,Sun May 3 05:22:12 2015 UTC,"I play with essentially a bare wood shaft as well. I play with one of my Ultralite LD poplar shafts which are extremely light weight and I use a surface-hardening process to make the outer layer of wood very hard and resistant to dents and dings. I don't actually ""build up"" any finish on the surface of the shaft, though. The stabilized wood fiber is right at the surface on my shaft, and every couple of months I put the shaft on the lathe and strip off the oil and dirt buildup and get the shaft down to what is essentially bare wood again.   My little trick that people seem to really like is that after cleaning the shaft and stripping off all the junk, I like to burnish the entire length of the shaft using the backside of some fine sandpaper. The paper backing with no grit really flattens out the wood grain on most shafts and puts a very dull, smooth, polish on the shaft that my customers just love. The burnishing process is easy to do on the lathe, but the same results can be done by hand quite easily. I have to be careful on the lathe to really monitor the heat I generate from the burnishing. I like to very briefly heat up the surface of the shaft which I think helps to pretty much ""temper"" the wood fibers on the surface. Too much heat buildup is bad, though and can temporarily warp the shaft. I try to keep the burnishing stage very brief for best results.   I also use a water-based sealer on my customer's shafts just prior to burnishing. I skip that step on my own shaft because I prefer the bare wood as a personal preference. The water-based sealer soaks in a couple of millimeters deep and provides a reasonable barrier against moisture and chalk dust after it dries. A quick burnish after the sealer gives a finish that my customers seem to love. I have guys that drive an hour just to have me toss their shaft on the machine and do a two-minute clean and burnish job. Guess it must be nicer than what they could do at home."

They make a product called cue wax that I think is fine (Longoni's version is the one I've used). Lee Pepper used to sell great shaft wax too (google LP shaft wax) but he's out of business now.  Some swear by using raw linseed oil.  At least one cuemaker says use nothing and just burnish the shaft with a piece of leather. This is a lot more work than using a wax though.   If you just keep it clean and don't have a nasty sticky clearcoat on it, it will already feel better than 99% of the shafts out there."

billiards,34lki8,metalhawj,4,Sat May 2 06:01:18 2015 UTC,Depends if you are playing call shot or call pocket.  Typically all professional and league matches are call pocket.  Call shot is more of a bar rule.  To answer your question yes it's legal and yes its a valid win.

billiards,34lki8,TheOneCalledAtlas,2,Mon May 4 16:36:16 2015 UTC,"There are three elements to a legal shot, and then two elements to a legally pocketed ball.  The following is based on WPA, BCA and BCAPL rules (basically the rules the pros use, and the World Pool-Billiards Association (WPA) is the model ruleset that most all leagues are based on.)  Legal Shot:   Clean contact between cue tip and cue ball (no double hits or pushes, no disturbing other balls besides cue ball) First contact between cue ball and a legal object ball. (In 8-ball, a legal object ball is any ball except the 8-ball during an open table, and a ball of your assigned group once groups have been assigned).  After contact between cue ball and object ball, at least one ball on the table hits a rail or falls into a pocket.   Failure to complete all three elements is a foul that results in ball in hand anywhere on the table for the incoming player.  Legally pocketed ball:   Called Ball (doesn't have to be the object ball hit by cue ball, but must still be a legal ball to pocket. For instance, if you are solids, pocketing the 2 ball by hitting the 1 ball into it. You must call the 2 ball, but don't need to say anything about the 1 ball). Called Pocket (call what pocket your called ball will go into.  You do not need to call how it gets there.  The details such as kisses, caroms, banks or combos do not need to be called or specified. And other object balls falling into pockets is not a foul in American pool under any official rules.)   Failure to legally pocket a ball on a legal shot is end of inning/turn.  TL;DR - actually please read the summary above, because then you will have a better understanding of the rules, and if you go through that checklist for each shot you will know if the shot was legal or not.  But in your situation, you made your called ball into the called pocket.  It does not matter how it gets there, you made it.  It is a legally pocketed ball."

A lot of times it's a safer bet to carrom or go of the rail to make it in your pocket because you have more room for error.
billiards,34lki8,Pip_Pip,1 point,Sat May 2 06:12:57 2015 UTC,"It would depend on the rules you are using.    Any organized ruleset you use is going to be one of two things:  Call pocket: As long as you make a legal hit (Hit your ball first except when the table is open you can use any ball first) and the called ball goes in the called pocket.  Slop counts (APA): You have to make a legal hit and if any of your balls go in any pocket it's a made shot.  In bar settings there are a number of variants one of which is call every contact.  It leads to arguments and fights and is not desirable to play this way.  However, you have to clarify what rules you are using before you play to avoid dispute."
billiards,34lki8,RoadHustler,1 point,Sat May 2 06:34:51 2015 UTC,"Minor correction in apa when shooting the 8 you have to mark the designated pocket but contact still wouldn't matter. All other shots are slop counts.   All other official rule books do not require you to call contact.   Its usually just drunk guys who can't hit a ball who insist on calling every little bump.

billiards,34lkq5,Lxrge,6,Sat May 2 06:04:20 2015 UTC,"It depends on your cue.  Generally speaking, if you have an ivory joint or an ivory ferrule, it is probably not a good idea to break with if you break hard. The ivory will crack eventually (especially in the winter, if you break with a cold cue).  Also, if you use a soft tip or layered tip, it will cause it to deform quicker and require more frequent maintenance/replacement.  If you use a low deflection shaft it isn't recommended since the end of your shaft is hollow and the ferrule material is much weaker.  Lastly, if you break from the box and have a big stroke, you might not want to use your cue because it will get dents on the forearm from hitting the rail. This isn't a problem when you break from the rail.  I generally break with my player. I recommend using a water buffalo or triangle* non layered tip.  I'm currently shooting with a medium ultraskin and it definitely has worn quickly and gotten much harder over the past 3 months. I prefer a hard tip so it's not a big deal, though i'd rather the tip start hard rather than having to constantly adjust as the tip changes.  My argument for using my player is that i'm used to it and I'd prefer to use something I'm 100% comfortable with for such an important shot. I do have a jump/break cue that i use when i gamble and when i'm in tournaments since i generally break much harder, and I got comfortable with it by practicing with it as a playing cue. If you can confidently draw the ball with a hard break tip, it means your stroke is pure.  *15mm triangle tips are the best and most consistent. 14mm are the second best. Don't bother with anything smaller. The 15 and 14's are stamped from the center of the hide where it is most dense and uniform and the smaller tips are stamped from the sides of the hide where it is less dense. I know alot of people think these tips are trash, but they probably haven't had a real triangle installed. The repair guys don't push them because there is absolutely no profit in it.  ;tldr  ivory cracks  soft tips wear out quicker  expensive cues may get dents"
billiards,34lkq5,ceezaleez,3,Sat May 2 08:20:39 2015 UTC,"Breaking with a cue can have some consequences, no doubt.   The most common issues you may see as a result of breaking with a cue are cracked ferrules, damaged tips, and cracked joint collars. I recommend (especially if you have a powerful break stroke) to upgrade your breaker with phenolic ferrules and joint collars. You may also find that you have less tip deformation problems if you have an actual jump/break tip installed. These harder leathers are intended to be pounded on relentlessly and often stand up better to repeated hammering on a break cue. The ""water buffalo"" tip is an economical break tip which I have good luck with, and there are premium (a.k.a. expensive) break tips like the Samsara which I really like due to their incredible hardness which facilitates jump shots as well as very hard breaking.   Using a fancy, inlaid cue for breaking can speed up or magnify problems with inlays coming loose or falling out, too. I always recommend avoiding an overly-fancy cue with lots of intricate parts. There is no guarantee you'll have problems with a fancy breaker, but those hard shots can shake parts loose and crack glue lines where they would normally hold up just fine with regular shooting.   One myth about breaking that I see no merit in is the claim that breaking causes warpage. In my experience and readings, warpage is entirely due to moisture issues and is not influenced by the type of shooting done with the cue. Wood acts like a spring, and (unlike metal) can't be ""bent"" just by shooting. Any warpage that happens in a break cue was going to happen the same way without it being used as a break cue.   Like these other guys said, definitely don't break with any of the newfangled LD shafts. They fall apart and explode fast enough when used just for shooting balls in normally. I agree with /u/ceezaleez , too. Ivory parts will fail on a breaker, so avoid that if possible.   One recommendation I make for tip maintenance on a breaker: Don't burnish your break tip if it mushrooms. Once you compress the leather and get the tip ""broke in"", carefully trim any mushrooming with a razor blade to remove the mushroomed leather without disturbing the compacted leather in the rest of the tip. Carefully re-dome your tip after trimming it and try to not put a lot of side-to-side force on the tip as you reshape it. Leather break tips can quickly fall apart if they are subjected to the back and forth density and compressing changes that come with breaking, then burnishing, the breaking. I actually don't recommend burnishing any tip, but with break tips this can cause problems very early in the tip's lifespan due to the extreme conditions the tip endures as a break tip.   You can easily get away with breaking using your shooter, just be aware of the maintenance issues and keep an eye on the delicate parts for damage. If you are a ""control"" breaker who uses a medium stroke and works to control the cueball precisely, then there is essentially nothing different with your break stroke than any normal shot which calls for a strong stroke."

An older cue, or something really a work of art? Not so much, it probably could, but why risk it?   However you will beat the shit out of your tips esp a soft or super soft much faster no matter if the cue is new or old. Costs money, long run it's cheaper to get a decent stick for breaking"

So, for a while, I also used that same cue to break with as well.  Later, when I got my McDermott, I continued using that same break cue.

billiards,34lfcv,squid06,5,Sat May 2 04:53:20 2015 UTC,"Do you mean the last ball is in the rack area? If so, the rules say it gets placed on the head spot and the rest of the balls are racked.  You have a few options:   Leave the cue ball near center table and play the cut shot, sending the cue ball two rails into the stack. Leave the cue ball closer to the head spot and call safe. Make the 15th ball and get whitey snuggled up on the middle of the head rail. Leave the cue ball near the stack and play a safety like /u/roadhustler described, hopefully not leaving your opponent a shot on the ball up-table.   Personally I will play for the first option if I can get the position I need. It'a not always possible though so the other two are there for backup.  I second the recommendation for George Fels's book, it's a good read.  Edit: I re-read the safety option and prefer a slightly different type of safe. Also with there being a loose ball up table, I might prefer to get whitey behind the rack area and play safe back there instead.  I made diagrams to explain."

billiards,34lfcv,dickskittles,1 point,Sat May 2 23:15:11 2015 UTC,"I think your 3rd option could use improvement.  Why not play position on the uptable ball, pocket it, and then play the safe /u/roadhustler described?  Then you don't have to worry about leaving the uptable ball, and you get one more point out of it."
billiards,34lfcv,petermgates,1 point,Mon May 4 15:58:58 2015 UTC,"It's a fair point. It does however sound like you're suggesting shooting the uptable ball and playing position for a safe in the next shot.  If you have the right shape to do so, why not shoot the ball with the intention of going into the stack and then play the safety if you miss?"
billiards,34lfcv,dickskittles,1 point,Mon May 4 16:36:37 2015 UTC,On loose pockets I guess I probably would.  On tight pockets I wouldn't want to play a break shot off the head spot; too much chance of missing the ball (because I'm trying to do too much with the CB) and opening the stack.
billiards,34lfcv,petermgates,1 point,Mon May 4 17:10:01 2015 UTC,"I like playing it, there's a fairly large target area to shoot for and you don't have to hit it hard to knock a couple of balls out. As you rightly point out though, the most important thing is to make the shot.  Which do you prefer: make the ball and then play safe into the stack or call safe on the last ball and leave the long shot at the full rack?"
billiards,34lfcv,dickskittles,1 point,Mon May 4 17:36:27 2015 UTC,"I don't play a ton of straight pool, but I was taught to try to develop threats with your safeties.  Leaving the long shot invites a mistake from your opponent, but when played well the hit-and-stick on the side of the rack puts balls near the pocket.  Your opponent will have a hard time not leaving you one of those shots unless he takes a foul, and if he does he's on one and you're on zero, so you'll happily just take one too.  He's in a real bad spot there."

billiards,34lfcv,RoadHustler,3,Sun May 10 14:59:01 2015 UTC,Are you asking where is the best place to leave the cue ball if you are going to be presented with a full rack (no break ball)? Since you are playing position in your question I can only assume you have another ball on the table. It would be worth it to knock the break ball out of the rack if possible. If you can't and are presented with a full rack then you have a few basic ideas 1. if you are going to take a foul make sure to knock a few balls free on the other side of the rack leaving a mostly intact rack as an obstruction. 2. Leave your opponent frozen to the rack if possible making it difficult for them not to foul. 3. Be aware that this will be the start of a race to three fouls if neither of you is forced into an error.  If you can position your cue ball directly in line with one of the three rows of balls making up the outside of the rack you can play a stop shot directly in line along the outside row of balls leaving the cue ball frozen to the ball you contact and sending the opposite corner ball  to the rail. This will do two things first it will give you something to shoot at if your opponent fails to leave you behind the rack second it should force them into a foul putting you on the right side of a 3 foul race. One more safe and they will have to make a very difficult decision.   A second option is a little too complex to describe at this hour but I will direct you to my source this very situation is covered in George Fels Book Mastering pool. And was duplicated in Mr. Fels book Advanced Pool.  He was a fantastic author and both books are worth owning and can be obtained from amazon for almost nothing used. I got a copy for $4 that was a old library book.

That's why I'm against bar rules unless I'm playing a few games with total randoms, in which case I'll play however they want as long as they tell me at the get go.  For 8ball, here's the standard breakdown: Intended ball, intended target, shot was legal (you hit your balls first, you didn't scratch, etc). If all three of those are true, it is a legitimate shot. If any of them are not, it's not. You don't have to call combos. You don't have to call rails. You don't have to point out minute details.     Next time ask him exactly what you have to say for a shot. S. If he's really so unreasonable, don't play with him or just make up even more absurd rules to troll him. Tell him he didn't call if it would be clean in or hit the inner cushions. Tell him he didn't call that his cue ball would hit another after the shot was made. ""I don't know, man, you didn't say you meant [x, y, z] to happen, so it just seems sloppy to me. That must mean it's slop.""     ...nah, you don't really like to do that, but I love messing with people when they're being sore sports :) If you do, you gotta have fun with it.

Playing out of the kitchen after a scratch or not taking ball in hand after the opponent fouls on their shot are a couple of examples that come to mind.

billiards,34imp5,robodonkee,3,Fri May 1 13:54:48 2015 UTC,"My favorite pin is a 3/8x10 radial with a wood to wood joint. I don't care for steel joints.   At the Expo, I got a chance to play with a Black Boar with a ferrule less shaft that had a steel joint. I have never hit with such an amazing cue. My buddies including Skylar Woodward all tried it out. It was crazy. You could load a shot with as much English as you could and just aim to make the ball and it goes. Zero deflection and such a pure hit. If I only had a spare $5k."
billiards,34imp5,fadedcheese,2,Fri May 1 14:04:36 2015 UTC,So you like the wood to wood joints? 3/8x10. More Soild? Another thing I have always been skeptical is how durable wood joints would be. I not an animal with my cues but shit does happen.
billiards,34imp5,gabrielleigh,3,Fri May 1 14:10:15 2015 UTC,"I assume you are asking about the durability of a wood collar instead of a steel, phenolic, or plastic collar on the joints of the cue.   A collar serves only one real function in a cue, and that is to provide strength against splitting when the cue is flexed or bent. These forces occur during normal play, and are usually well within the strength of a wooden collar to contain. The risk, however, resides in the chance that a large and instantaneous force will be seen at the joint if the cue is dropped or knocked over. Wooden collars simply can't contain the force of these rare circumstances in some cases and will fail where a phenolic or steel collar would not. Like all other aesthetic choices, you take the risk by trading strength for beauty. With proper care and some good luck, a wood collared cue can last for generations.   Now as far as a ""wood to wood"" joint goes, that refers not to the collar style of the cue but rather to the joint faces which touch each other when the cue is assembled. In a ""wood to wood"" jointed cue, there is no brass insert in the shaft. Generally a wood to wood joint is a ""big pin"" joint with coarser threads that are suitable to be tapped directly into the shaft wood without the need for an insert of any kind. The larger pins such as the 3/8"" diameter pins of various thread styles are preferred. The smaller 5/16"" diameter pins are generally threaded too finely to be suitable for direct wood threading into the shaft. Standard 5/16"" x 14 or 18 threads are fine in metal, but when cut into wood they are too fine and weak and generally break up and strip out after a bit of use. Small pin wood to wood joints can be made, and I have built a few of them successfully, but generally require an extremely hard blank of maple  to be selected, and I use a proprietary technique to strengthen the fine wooden threads after they are cut to make them considerably more durable.   Wood to wood big pin joints tend to lend a more solid hit that resembles a one-piece house cue feel, where the small pin joints with brass inserts tend to feel a bit more buzzy and artificial. Both ""feels"" are completely normal and preferred by many different kinds of players both amateur and professional. Neither is ""better"", but rather just another one of the endless characteristics of a cue that fall under the umbrella of things that depend on personal taste and preference."

billiards,34imp5,dalgeek,1 point,Fri May 1 15:11:22 2015 UTC,"I think the big pin joints generally feel more solid but a lot of that depends on the woods chosen for the rest of the cue, particularly the forearm wood choice. Some woods can give a ""soggy"" or soft hit regardless of the pin or joint choice. A cue with a cocobolo, ebony, or rosewood forearm is generally going to feel pretty solid regardless of the pin or joint style. The pin and joint style contribute to the overall feel of the cue, but are just a couple of ingredients in the recipe that makes the cue feel and play in any particular way a maker wants.   Most experienced players have developed a general recipe of parts and woods that contribute to the perfect feel they prefer. Like all things, there are extremes which can be created by using certain woods and components. Players generally develop a preference for a cue that falls somewhere in between the extremes and hits a certain ""sweet spot"" that provides the right amount of deflection, the right feel, the right sound, and other preferences that can be felt during play. Those preferences are different for everyone, and often two equally-skilled players will have completely different preference for how their cue is set up.   The best thing to do is get your hands on some cues with the big pins and give them a good workout to see how they translate your intentions to the cueball. They may provide a better translation than what you are currently using, or they may throw your game way off and cause you problems. Sometimes those problems can be worked out and you may find you end up adjusting to the change and like it better than your old setup, other times the change is simply bad for your style and you are better off with your old setup."
billiards,34imp5,gabrielleigh,1 point,Fri May 1 15:44:52 2015 UTC,Awesome thanks for the info. I will use this as my reference when it comes time to get this cue going. It's hard to find this sort of first hand info online. You are the man. Thanks again.
billiards,34imp5,fadedcheese,1 point,Fri May 1 21:40:07 2015 UTC,What do you think about the Predator Roadline cues (LE3/LE4) with the Radial joint? I'm not fond of the Uniloc joint because it comes loose too often and feels really buzzy to me.
billiards,34imp5,Not2BeEftWith,1 point,Sat May 9 01:56:29 2015 UTC,"I like the Radial joint about 10 times better than the Uniloc quick release. I get the same feel from Uniloc cues, and it is distracting to me for some reason. Also, I feel like the Radial is quite a bit more durable and will resist damage better than the Uniloc. I get a lot of Unilocs in the shop that won't screw together, and I'll discover a microscopic little ding or scratch on the piloted part of the pin that keeps the whole cue from going together. I just don't have any personal preferences that go along with what the Uniloc brings to the feel of a cue. Like everything in pool, it all comes down to personal preferences and mine just don't go with the Uniloc feel at all."
billiards,34imp5,dickskittles,2,Sat May 9 04:51:12 2015 UTC,I've had one of my cues with a wood to wood for 20 years. It's now my break cue and aside from having the pin reset once never had a problem with it. I don't care for how most steel joints seem to take away some of the feel of the cue. I treat my cues very well but unless you beat the crap out of it you shouldn't have any problems with one.
billiards,34imp5,gabrielleigh,1 point,Fri May 1 14:18:05 2015 UTC,Amen.  My main playing cue is a boar w/ ferrule less shaft.  Effing amazing cue.
billiards,34imp5,dickskittles,0,Thu May 7 13:40:26 2015 UTC,"Joint material or pin has no effect on deflection.  The ferrule (or lack thereof) does, though."
billiards,34imp5,gabrielleigh,3,Fri May 1 15:53:08 2015 UTC,"Deflection is actually a consequence of mass, or more specifically the exact location of the mass in question. Joint material and pin do actually contribute to the overall conditions that deflect the cueball after it is hit. The style of joint and pin can influence the way energy moves through the joint and into the shaft. Different joint materials and pins have different masses and can influence the balance and mass of the cue at the joint, therefore changing the way the shaft responds when striking the cueball. Ferrules really only serve to keep the shaft from splitting in half, and aside from the weight difference they contribute (compared to the shaft wood that is removed and replaced by the ferrule), they don't really figure much into the deflection of a shaft. A ferrule either weighs more or less than the shaft wood that was removed to install the ferrule, so the ferrule either adds mass to the end of the shaft or it makes it lighter.   The cueball is pushed sideways (deflected) by the mass of the cue as it travels forward and resists being pushed aside by the cueball. Generally, the theory is that by reducing the mass in the very end of the shaft, you can minimize the deflection of the cueball. Deflection has only recently been labeled and marketed as a ""bad"" thing. It has existed for centuries in pool cues, and the great masters of olde cared nothing for the current interpretation of deflection and the negative connotations of the concept we have today. It was just part of the feel of a cue, and it either fit their style or it didnt. There is a certain level of deflection that our brains get comfortable at predicting with each shot, and the perfect cue has just the right amount of deflection to match up with how our brains predict the cueball will travel when shooting with english."
billiards,34imp5,dickskittles,1 point,Fri May 1 16:20:43 2015 UTC,"Your first sentence is dead on.  Deflection depends on the mass located within the tip-end few inches of the cue, and nothing else.  The closer to the tip you get, the more the mass matters, and beyond a few inches nothing does.  So a small difference in the mass of the ferrule (which happens with different materials and sizes), right there at the tip, has a noticeable effect on deflection.  The joint does not."
billiards,34imp5,gabrielleigh,1 point,Fri May 1 19:11:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I agree with that. I am definitely not a mechanical engineer or anything, but my layperson's understanding of basic high school physics lends me to believe the mass at the joint does affect how the shaft would respond to lateral forces at the tip when striking the cueball off-center. Harmonically, I also tend to speculate that the different joint pins and joint collar materials cause energy transmission to happen in slightly different ways through the joint, and the difference can mean that tiny waves of energy reach the tip at different times and cause slightly different responses by the shaft when it strikes the cueball.   I wish some real scientists would blow a bunch of grant money and test this stuff out for me so I could have some kind of actual data to back up my speculations, but for now they remain just that. Speculations. I would sure bet the impact of joint pin and joint collar material selection would be microscopic at best, but I also would not be surprised if there was a statistically-significant influence that could be measured and quantified. My money still sits on the side that says joint pin and collar style have a small impact on deflection in the grand scheme of it all."
billiards,34imp5,grlldcheese87,1 point,Fri May 1 19:55:07 2015 UTC,"The science has been done, and it didn't take a lot of grant money.  This isn't large-hadron-collider-level stuff here.  As you pointed out yourself, deflection is the ball's reaction to some of the mass of the cue getting pushed sideways as a result of the off-center contact.  But the thing is it's only the last few inches of the cue that do move sideways.  Thus only the mass in those last few inches has an effect.  The energy transmission does happen differently due to the joint material, which you can feel with your hand when you hit with different cues.  But this energy is transmitted at the speed of sound through wood.  Any energy being transmitted in any fancy ways through the cue as far as the joint can't affect the ball, because in the time it takes energy to transmit the length of the shaft and reflect to the tip, the ball's already gone.  Both of these facts have been pretty thoroughly scientifically tested and reported.  You can google physics professor Dr. Dave Alciatore's website for a lot of interesting reading and video."
billiards,34imp5,dickskittles,2,Fri May 1 20:02:39 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes a lot of sense. I'll check that out. Thanks for the info"
billiards,34imp5,ceezaleez,1 point,Fri May 1 20:21:41 2015 UTC,"I just read this entire debate.  Changed my mind twice about who was right.  Now i just have more questions.  Anyone ever tried adding washers of different material to the joint while assembling the cue?  I don't mean detail rings.  I mean like drilling a hole in a quarter and slipping it over the pin and screwing down on it.  How does a stainless steel washer compare to rubber, plastic, cloth, anything?  Does soft rubber (skateboard bushing) create a flimsy rubbery hit?    My physics understanding says soft gaskets will actually help transfer energy evenly and the cushion will dampen vibration.  My pool experience says never ever do this because solid joints lead to solid hits for good strokes (I'm always suspicious of tradition).  Can anyone with more pool experience weigh in?  Just trying to separate science and dogma."
billiards,34imp5,EtDM,1 point,Sat May 2 03:51:12 2015 UTC,"A stainless steel washer probably wouldn't make any difference if it was already a steel joint.  A softer washer would dampen vibration as you say, which would definitely change the feel.  As far as pool experience goes, the cue ball won't know the difference.  But if the player feels a difference, whether it makes any physical difference to the balls or not, it can definitely affect your execution.  People play better when they're happy with how their cue feels."
billiards,34ijto,outside_english,4,Fri May 1 13:28:14 2015 UTC,"I am currently swinging one of my custom jump/breaks. Not playing as much due to some health issues I am battling right now, but on the days I feel decent I try to get out and hit some balls to keep myself loose and sharp.   I am just about done with this build. All I have left is to spray a couple more layers of clearcoat on the shaft and the joint protector and then she will be ready to buff out and ship to anyone who might decide they have to have her. She is one of only a few cues I get to build each year that aren't commissioned, and I always enjoy spending some time working on projects that aren't special ordered by anyone.   Anyhow, here is an album:   http://imgur.com/a/Ps01H#0"

billiards,34ijto,petermgates,1 point,Fri May 1 16:32:27 2015 UTC,"So, call me pedantic but I noticed that you make your j/b shaft with texture so that it can be used alone for super-tight jump shots.  Wouldn't that break the > 40"" minimum cue length rule?"
billiards,34ijto,gabrielleigh,1 point,Fri May 1 20:57:34 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, that wouldn't be legal in the formats that require a minimum 40"" cue for jump shots. You'd have to leave the jump cue assembled with the jump handle to avoid that problem. In any other setting where that length restriction isn't an issue, having the ability to drop the total cue weight to just about 5 ounces really helps you jump those super close balls."
billiards,34ijto,RoadHustler,1 point,Fri May 1 21:02:07 2015 UTC,Cool inlays on that jump cue. Get better soon I like reading your posts.

billiards,34ijto,fadedcheese,2,Fri May 1 17:54:09 2015 UTC,Alex Brick made of Dymondwood is what I use. It makes it as easy as throwing a dart.
billiards,34ijto,Granthim,1 point,Fri May 1 13:53:43 2015 UTC,I use an Alex Brick that I love.  I was in the same boat as you last year and read alot of positive reviews regarding how easy it is to jump a ball with these cues.  For a long jump the Alex Bricks are awesome because of the weight.  Jumping is really effortless.  For Shorter Jumps for instance 5 inches behind the ball you need to practice a bit but it is certainly doable but generally a lighter jump would be better.
billiards,34ijto,trickshottim,1 point,Tue May 5 20:45:29 2015 UTC,"I generally use a Joe Bouska dymondwood jump cue. Dymondwood cues are a little harder to come by nowadays though. If you're not looking to spend a lot of money with the big names, the Lucasi wooden jump cue (not the Air Hog) or the Poison jump cue are two of the best values on the market."
billiards,34ijto,fadedcheese,1 point,Fri May 1 15:52:07 2015 UTC,I have an opportunity for an Alex brick JB even though I would prefer just a jumper.  It's being valued at around 350 though.
billiards,34ijto,fadedcheese,1 point,Fri May 1 16:15:03 2015 UTC,I sold my Alex brick JB to a buddy because I bought just the jump cue from him on the way back from a tourney. It jumps great but as a break cue I don't care for it. It was just far to stiff for me to break with. $350 is not bad atm. I've herd some sell as high as $600 because of the Dymondwood stuff. That might come back down soon though.
billiards,34ijto,gabrielleigh,1 point,Fri May 1 16:37:03 2015 UTC,It sounds like Dymondwood could come back around as early as this summer. I guess they are already back to making some gunstocks. This was told to me by a Diamond employee at the expo a few weeks ago.
billiards,34ijto,JMizzo,1 point,Fri May 1 16:34:20 2015 UTC,"I am hoping Rutland Plywood comes back and rebuilds after their huge fire last year. It has been a while since I followed the latest news about them, but last I heard a few months ago they had possibly agreed to sell or license the technology and processes to make Dymondwood to another company. That could have changed by now, but regardless of who makes the stuff I can't wait until there is a steady flow of it available again. I use a lot of it in jump/break cues and the only substitute I know of that is made in the USA is Spectraply. I like the looks of the Spectraply material, but I don't really like the colors I have seen them produce as well as the Dymondwood products. I'd love to hear any good news about the Dymondwood situation if anyone has any new developments on it."

billiards,34ijto,gabrielleigh,2,Sun May 3 14:57:41 2015 UTC,From what the Diamond guys told me is that the original owners are out. The insurance company was paying out a ton in lost revenue from the fire. So they were working with a guy that was interested in continuing the business for gun stocks. The new guy/company has started making smaller pieces for the gun stuff but has yet to get the process up to make longer pieces for the table rails. I would assume this would also include the longer blanks for cues. They were optimistic that he would get that size material going by this summer. That was Diamond and their concern was the rails. So maybe the cue blanks would come up with that or maybe that's another process/machine he'd have to get up too?
billiards,34ijto,gfcolli,1 point,Sun May 3 15:21:11 2015 UTC,"Ah sweet. I really liked the Dymondwood products in general. Spectraply is another option, but I have been less enthusiastic about some of their color choices. Good to know Dymondwood might make a comeback someday."
billiards,34ht5k,hkc222,2,Fri May 1 07:18:59 2015 UTC,"In downtown San Jose, there's South First Billiards, which is about halfway between what you described.   In Milpitas (the bit between San Jose and Fremont) there's Edgie's, which is a lot more enthusiast occupied (Efren and Francisco did an exhibition match there a few years back), but is also heavily occupied by myriad high schoolers from the area during the evenings."
billiards,34ht5k,asamimasa,2,Fri May 1 07:41:02 2015 UTC,"Couple of thoughts: south first Billiards (420 S. First street in San Jose) has twenty plus tables and is rarely ever full. However, the quality of the tables is usually pretty bad. At least one pocket per table is completely sunk and pocketing a ball on those pockets with any amount of force well send it flying off the table or right back at you.   Monday nights are flat rate all night for $12 until closing. It is a great way to play cheap all night long. They just implemented a new game night on Wednesdays with a $5 cover and $3/hour pool. Normal pool rates are $15/hr for a table. The clientele is usually pretty good. Most don't play regularly so you do run the problem of etiquette issues as people tend to loiter between the tables when they aren't shooting and you'll probably spend more time than you are used to asking them to move out of the way so you can shoot. Also the music from the jukebox gets loud and they have DJs on Friday and Saturday nights  Honestly, if you don't care about having perfect tables and pockets (at least one table there is also slanted and uneven [avoid table 23]) it is an ok place to play. Full bar and friendly staff. But be prepared for frustration as you'll find dead rails, broken pockets, poor felt. I happen to live a couple of blocks away so I am always there on Monday (cheap pool!). They don't open on Sundays, and don't open until 4pm the other days. Posted closing times are 2am but they tend to close when things die down, which could be as early as 12:30 on Mondays or Tuesdays.   Edgies is much better, tends to have people who play pool often and have people with generally better etiquette. Table quality is good, staff is friendly. No full bar but they've got beer. It tends to get busy though most nights as there are APA league nights pretty much every night of the week. The open until like 4am though so you'll be able to find a time to play if you are flexible. I don't know the rates off hand, but they are decent. I'd probably go there more often if I didn't live walking distance from SFB.   Sunnyvale has Lucky Shot Billiards in their downtown strip. Small venue, low ceilings, good tables. Again no full bar but they serve beer. I don't know pieces.   Santa Clara Billiards is probably your closest place. That's right on Stevens creek along the auto row. Lots of tables. Lots of people who regularly play pool. They can get busy, but you should be able to find a table. Rates, I think, are a little more expensive than other places. I personally am not a fan of the owner there, but that's just me.   Final note: the latter three locations all have their own parking lots or near by parking. SFB is in downtown San Jose so expect to search for street parking or pay for public lot parking. On weekends that's tough because of the nightclubs and general shenanigans that happen in that area."

There are a ton of really great case makers out there but in general for a quality hand made case you are probably gonna spend more in the range of $175 and up range depending on how nice you want to go.   In J&J's range $25 - $150 they are mostly high volume production companies farming their actual manufacturing out to some sweat shop in Asia.  John Barton is in china but its a little different because he operates a small shop with his wife's family and oversees all the work himself and maintains quality.

billiards,34hdkm,outside_english,3,Fri May 1 04:08:36 2015 UTC,"In most league rules it would still be an open table yes. It wasn't a legal shot if you scratched.

billiards,34hdkm,fadedcheese,2,Fri May 1 04:38:22 2015 UTC,"In BCA, WPA and BCAPL rules (basically the rules the pros play by the most) groups in 8-ball are only assigned when a ball is legally pocketed.  There are three elements to a legal shot, and then two elements to a legally pocketed ball, in WPA, BCA and BCAPL rules.  Legal Shot:   Clean contact between cue tip and cue ball (no double hits or pushes, no disturbing other balls besides cue ball) First contact between cue ball and a legal object ball. (In 8-ball, a legal object ball is any ball except the 8-ball during an open table, and a ball of your assigned group once groups have been assigned).  After contact between cue ball and object ball, at least one ball on the table hits a rail or falls into a pocket.   Failure to complete all three elements is a foul that results in ball in hand anywhere on the table for the incoming player.  Legally pocketed ball:   Called Ball (doesn't have to be the object ball hit by cue ball, but must still be a legal ball to pocket. For instance pocketing the 2 ball by hitting the 1 ball into it. You must call 2 ball, but don't need to say anything about the 1 ball). Called Pocket (call what pocket your called ball will go into. The details such as kisses, caroms, banks or combos do not need to be called or specified. And other object balls falling into pockets is not a foul in American pool under any official rules.)

Once your group has been assigned, let's say stripes, the first thing the cue ball must hit is a stripe or else you have fouled giving your opponent ball in hand anywhere on the table.   Hope that helps, and yes ask any questions you have, there are no silly questions about the rules of pool. Unfortunately the rules most people know are bad rules created in bars by hustlers. The rules I'm talking about are competition rules that have been debated and edited by people with the best of the game in mind. And I want to share the proper rules of 8-ball with as many people as possible.   So read the BCAPL rulebook, and if you still have questions fire away."

Anyway, a good explanation on your part, both to my and op questions. Thanks.  The reason I felt my question might be silly was that generally I'm rather well oriented when it comes to rules (at lest 8/9/10-ball, straight 14.1, not so much). Also, you know, the Internet.

Not saying thee aren't more patient lower skilled players that enjoy the challenge but most get annoyed at the smaller pocket sizes. If it's you playing 90+% of the time then I'd go towards 4.25"" If it's less than that I'd probably stay a bit closer to standard sizes. Unless she's a sucker for punishment.

billiards,34dsxw,Durtyjoey,2,Thu Apr 30 09:53:58 2015 UTC,"Absolutely do not get anything but a wood shaft. They are just too stiff and won't allow you the control wood will. As for the butt of the cue, I wouldn't be as concerned. I like low deflection shafts, but some prefer standard.   I think the most important thing for you right now, is to make sure you take your time and get exactly what you want. If you're anything like me, if you rush it and end up with something that's just ok, you'll find yourself wanting to buy something again sooner or later. For that same reason, you shouldn't necessarily limit yourself to a set budget. If you really want one type that's like 250-300, and go cheap at first, you may just crack and buy the expensive one later. But that's just up to you.   As for my personal preferences? A sub $200 cue is a sub $200. There may be some luck involved, I'm sure people have gotten $175 cues with defects that others of the same model didn't have. But the people that get a defect are going to be the ones to come out and say ""never get a ____ they are terrible.""  Here is an interesting article about weight:   http://billiards.about.com/od/howtochooseyourpoolcue/a/Light-Or-Heavy-Cue-Weight.htm  It echoes what I've always heard. A ""pro stroke"" is easiest to achieve with a lighter cue. If you want to play with any kind of spin, you're better off with a light cue. Heavier cues will multiply any slight variance from the ideal shot. But a heavier cue may be easier to use for beginners who just want to make straight in shots. I use a 19, but I wish it was 18.  Like I said, I think sub $200 cues mostly play the same. You can always upgrade the shaft later on and you will get a much improved hit. So don't ignore the looks. If you like your equipment more, you'll have more confidence, and probably take better care of it. Plus you'll be less temped by a nicer looking one later on.   I'd like to give you a brand recommendation though. He's not the most popular, because he kind of burned a lot of ""collectors"" who paid hundreds for his cues before he started doing it the way he does now which ended up devaluing his older ones. But anyway, Dale Perry is a ""semi custom"" cue maker who sells directly through his ebay page. I say semi because he make a lot of cues which he calls one of a kind, but which have repeating patterns and he just makes a lot of them with slight variations. But if you want a cue with exotic, real materials and inlays, there isn't really any other option.   Check out how awesome this cue is, it will probably sell for less than $200:  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Dale-Perry-DP-Pool-Cue-1-1-Turquoise-Inlays-FREE-Stage-IV-Shaft-Upgrade-/311349643222?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item487de287d6  Javawood Cue  Bocote Points   Ivori Micarta and Turquoise Inlays  Keep in mind that anything that says Ivori Micarta is just synthetic stuff to mimic Ivory. And anything that says ""pearlesence"" is also just a synthetic to look like mother of pearl (but sometimes the colored stuff looks cool.) But the Turquoise is real. Mine from him has full turquoise points. It has more turquoise than any cue I've ever seen. It was only $350. I'm a 6 in the APA, and have played with lots of cues. Unless you're talking about $1,000 stuff, it hits as well or better than anything else I've tried. I'd recommend buying from his ebay store directly, not anyone else selling DP cues. He provides a warranty. He also sells as an ""add on upgrade"" his own radial low deflection shaft, built like a predator. I went with the upgrade and it has a very similar hit to the original predators. I can't believe he isn't more popular. Just keep an eye on his page and wait for one you like and make an offer. There's usually 5-6 new ones a week.   http://www.ebay.com/usr/dpcustomcues?_trksid=p2047675.l2559"

The break/play cues are garbage, just spend the cash on a good playing cue and break with a bar cue.  Down the road you can get a break cue if you want, they're significantly cheaper. You can get a decent one for $50-$80"
billiards,34dsxw,RoastedDonut,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:55:34 2015 UTC,"Nope, they currently offer brands called Hybrid and Custom.  The Hybrid seem to be their ""higher tech"" offering with supposed shock absorption technology and a rubberized wrap, similar to a golf club. The Hybrid shafts are also laminated ""low deflection"" models.  I have an LHE-10. It's an ok cue for the money. The slim shaft is a touch on the wobbly side but I like the hit and can get decent cue ball action from it.  I was a snooker player before moving to the U.S. so I wasn't comfortable with regular shaft sizes, they always felt too big for my liking, even with the larger billiard balls here."

I'm a big supporter of going to physical stores if you don't know what you want because of this (assuming they let you hit a couple of balls to try them out).   Some of my tastes/preferences:  Thinner shaft No uni loc joint Shaft has to feel smooth, not grainy Weight more balanced through shaft Has to have some kind of wrap  I play with a Coker cue currently.

You can get them fairly inexpensively online - the low-end G-series (G-201 to G-206) are available for 216 from Muellers.  I would have stayed with McDermott except for one thing - I wanted to go to a smaller, 11mm tip - and the G-Core shafts can not be turned down below 12mm because of the graphite core.  All in all, I've been happy with the Schmelke - the smaller tip, at least for me, makes my english take much better (sometimes too good - I forget just how much the english will affect my shot), and I seem to have much better precision too.  Some people will say tip size makes no difference, but I definately saw an improvement in my game with the new cue!!"
billiards,34dsxw,mkglass,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:54:21 2015 UTC,Smaller tip is exactly what I'm looking for. Mind linking me to your exact cue?
billiards,34ds3x,Tcram85,3,Thu Apr 30 09:41:45 2015 UTC,"I'd sure avoid using more than one weight bolt in the cue. A very common complaint about cues with weight bolts (in general) is the buzzing, rattling, or clunking feel when the weight bolts come loose. This issue is common for cues with one weight bolt, and I'd say there is an even greater chance that things will come loose with more than one bolt snugged up against each other. With seasonal expansion, the metals and the woods will expand and contract at different rates from each other, and I'd expect this problem will only compound itself when more parts and pieces are added to the equation.   I'd be tempted to carefully measure the total length of the tapped hole (down to the deepest thread), then measure the depth of the rubber bumper that goes in the end of the butt. Subtract the depth of the bumper from your total threaded depth, and you have a number that you can use to pick the longest possible weight bolt that will fit that threaded hole.   Now you can take a quick trip down to your specialty hardware store and pick out a new bolt for a couple of dollars that is within a quarter inch of what you measured. Err on the short side so you don't have any problems fully inserting your rubber bumper. I like to install weight bolts with a little bit of cheap white Elmer's school glue on the threads. I use it sparingly, but the water-based glue causes the wooden threads to expand and close up any air gaps between the butt and the metal weight bolt. The glue dries and makes a relatively weak ""thread locker"" effect, but can still be cracked loose if the weight bolt needs removed in the future. Using epoxy or super glue will result in the bolt being nearly impossible to remove without stripping out the threads or breaking the head off the bolt. The white glue has just enough grip to keep it from coming loose during play in most cases, but still allows for removal in the future.   If this option still doesn't bring the total cue weight up to your desired amount, then the next option is to drill and tap the butt for a larger-diameter weight bolt. The larger diameter bolt adds more weight at the same length and might be enough to bring the cue up to the weight you want. This can easily be done with a hand drill, the appropriate drill bit and tap which are available at the same hardware store you buy your cheap weight bolts. That bolt you have in the cue now may be a 7/16"" diameter bolt (not for sure without measuring it myself), and you can easily increase that to a 1/2"" diameter bolt for more weight.   ~Cheers"

I wasn't sure if that would even work nor if I would mess up the balance/weight distribution of the cue and make it a lot more difficult to play with. I also feel like if I did it with a hand drill (which is the only thing I have to do it with at the moment) I would drill at some sort of angle which would also mess up the distribution. Basically, I don't trust myself to physically alter the cue like that because I'm afraid to mess it up haha"

billiards,34b6v0,load_more_comets,3,Wed Apr 29 19:27:30 2015 UTC,Ive had a Golden West table for about 10 years that has served me very well.  It's similar to this one http://billiardmfg.com/detail.php?Virginia-41 and cost me $1700. They use three piece one inch slate and have a lifetime warranty.  My table has been moved three times by pro's and recovered a couple of times.  The wood still looks new and pocket leather has minimal wear.  They are less expensive than an Olhausen but hold up really well for what you pay. Made here in the USA too. I would definitely recommend.  The one you are looking at is from their modern series and the closest design from Olhausen is the Madison which runs $6765.  I don't have any problems recommending one.  The balls it comes with are nothing special though so you might want to upgrade them.

billiards,34b6v0,randye,2,Wed Apr 29 22:18:43 2015 UTC,"The balls are OK, they will chip after a couple of years depending on how you treat them. I don't know if the sticks are the same since i bought mine at a distributor in Arkansas but the ones that came with it were junk as expected.  Good for kids and players that don't have respect though so get them, just don't plan on them being perfectly straight after a few years.  I have a couple that still are.   I did not get Simonis but the cloth is decent and does the job.  I replaced each time I had the table moved because of re-stretch.  Probably didn't have to but it never hurts.  My table isn't super fast but cloth has more to do with that than anything.  Simonis would make it faster than I like."

billiards,34bsap,sflloyd11,2,Wed Apr 29 22:00:10 2015 UTC,One comment I would make is that your system should provide accurate ratings but doesn't help when trying to match up players of differing ability.  Bob Jewett has developed a handicap/rating system that is similar to Elo. This is on his website and this article appeared in Billiards Digest.  Mike Page of Fargo Billiards developed the concept further and wrote a document detailing how it works. I can't find it right now but there is some info on their website.  I also understand that USAPL have a similar rating system and lastly the rating system in Virtual Pool 4 is supposedly based on Elo.  I do like the website though. It's well designed and clear.
billiards,34bsap,petermgates,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:29:15 2015 UTC,"I do like the website though. It's well designed and clear.   Thank you for that. Those other systems are definitely interesting and I will be looking into those. They've also sparked some other ideas for handicapping different skill levels.   I would love to be able to play a league similar to any of these IRL. Sadly, no one ever had enough interest."
billiards,34bsap,lordmcfuzz,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:00:00 2015 UTC,Lazy request: does any any one have a spread sheet or source code that one could start using if they were to implement this system for an league they were starting?

billiards,34bsap,DetroitLarry,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:45:01 2015 UTC,"This was the base idea for my site nomadpool.com when I first started it. It quickly grew into a site for tournaments because as you noticed, it's hard to get people to care about sending each other challenges. On Nomad, you can even send challenges, accept, and report the results using text messages, so no smart phone is even required.  I feel like some sort of structure is required to gain critical mass. The rating alone isn't enough for most people. That's why I switched focus to tournaments and am now working on leagues. The ladder system is still in tact and will hopefully gain momentum as more people start using the site for their leagues.  If you or anyone else would like a region or venue added to Nomad, just drop me a PM."

billiards,349ltr,petermgates,1 point,Wed Apr 29 12:26:33 2015 UTC,I'd say 8 ball since its the only thing I play unless I absolutely HAVE to play otherwise
billiards,349ltr,petermgates,5,Wed Apr 29 12:29:57 2015 UTC,"On a bar box, cue ball goes on the headstring near the rail (either side). Aim for the 2nd ball with draw and about 75% power. This tends to get more movement out of the 8 ball, assuming that making the 8 on a break is a win.  On a 9ft, cue ball goes on the headstring or just behind, an inch to the left or right of center. Full power, a touch of low, aimed straight at the head ball. This gives me control of the cue ball after it hits the rack with it usually ending up somewhere near the center of the table."

billiards,349ltr,sthngdrksde,2,Wed Apr 29 19:24:12 2015 UTC,8ball = hammer the rack straight on from the head string  9ball = soft but solid break from the far left of the head string just to get the side ball in a pocket and get shape on the one.
billiards,349ltr,dickskittles,2,Wed Apr 29 13:22:31 2015 UTC,"In 8-ball, a soft break doesn't leave you in a world of hurt.  It leaves the less skilled/knowledgeable tactical player in a world of hurt.  If your opponents are doing this to you, make sure you don't pocket any more balls than you have to (to claim the more favorable category of balls), and play safe until things are open enough to run out.  If you're still losing, work on your safety play and learn from your opponents' tactical moves, paying extra attention to when they're able to put you in a really bad spot."
billiards,349ltr,obamas_socks,2,Wed Apr 29 14:58:22 2015 UTC,"My father hates playing with me because we break differently. We only at 8 ball together. Both of us hit the rack dead center, but he prefers to leave the cue ball about 8 inches from the back rail and use the rail as the bridge, supporting it with two fingers. He gets a lot of power and a consistent shot but I lose all hope of putting the ball where I want it when I break like that. I put the ball right on the spot, use a closed bridge, and try to bring the cue ball back towards me after it hits the rack. I find I get the best balance of power and cue ball placement this way."
billiards,349ltr,petermgates,3,Wed Apr 29 15:56:29 2015 UTC,It sounds like your father really hates himself because of his spider-finger rail bridge and is envious of your solid closed bridge which is why he takes it out on you.  Just sayin'...
billiards,349ltr,too_lazy_2_punctuate,2,Wed Apr 29 16:40:22 2015 UTC,Your dad hates playing you cause of how you break?
billiards,349ltr,petermgates,2,Wed Apr 29 23:37:40 2015 UTC,"On the subject of soft breaks in 8 ball, you have to be careful to meet the rule requirements for balls to hit the cushion.   Typically four balls and the cue ball must touch a rail or be pocketed after the break for it to be deemed legal.   Of course if we're talking bar matches here, you would have to agree the rules before you started."
billiards,349ltr,jerutley,2,Wed Apr 29 17:14:31 2015 UTC,"Left-hand side of headstring, about an inch from the side rail.  Hard as I can, with draw, aiming at the ball to the left of the 8-ball.  As long as the rack is nice and tight, I usually get excellent movement of the 8-ball toward the right hand side pocket, and good scatter.  Slight risk of cue going at the left-corner pocket, but usually the draw avoids that."
billiards,349ltr,BobPlager,2,Wed Apr 29 17:49:44 2015 UTC,"I just want to say that I can't stand the second ball break for 8 ball. Almost always leaves a shit cluster down there I have to deal with because someone wants to luck out. Hit the balls and run the table instead of trying to luck out on the break at the expense of the rest of the rack.  Yeah, I get it, if you're good you should be able to deal with it anyway (I play straight pool, I know how to deal with a cluster), but I just hate the second ball break."
billiards,349ltr,petermgates,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:10:31 2015 UTC,I hear ya. Clusters all along the side but I'll take clusters for the excitement of watching that 8 ball creep towards the side pocket.

billiards,349ltr,Schizophrenics,-1,Thu Apr 30 05:54:27 2015 UTC,There is no misunderstanding. You break using the rail? That seems a little sketchy.
billiards,349ltr,thepottsy,2,Thu Apr 30 11:28:29 2015 UTC,"That's not what I said.  As others have stated, they will break with the cue ball close to one of the side rails.  Didn't figure it needed to be explained again."
billiards,349ltr,H4ppenSt4nce,1 point,Thu Apr 30 11:43:07 2015 UTC,"On the headstring about 4 inches to the right of center of table.  I throw a solid 21ish mph break into the head ball to get the cue to bounce back to center table.  I play on a bar box most of the time, and I've found that if I hit it harder than that the balls tend to cluster up on the rail."
billiards,349ltr,Jeembo,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:25:00 2015 UTC,"8 ball: half a diamond to the right, halfway between rail and head string.  Crank that shit at the lead ball just below the center of the cue ball.  9 ball: 1 diamond to the right, halfway between the rail and head string.  Crank that shit at the 1 ball just below the center of the cue ball.  Reason I only go 1 diamond up from the rail is because I get a shitload more power with a rail bridge and going off the side rail feels awkward and unsteady.  If I'm not having any luck though, I'll switch to breaking off the head string, an inch or two off the right rail."
billiards,349ltr,Schizophrenics,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:08:57 2015 UTC,"8 ball, straight on, and I hit it about as hard as I'd ever need to.  Center ball.  9 ball, offset to the right, and about 3/4 stroke. Second ball to the right."
billiards,349ltr,mohrt,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:37:05 2015 UTC,"This applies to barbox 8 ball, other variations may or may not be applicable. The screenshot is a 9 footer, just apply it to a 7 footer.  screenshot  Cueball: place near the side rail so that the rail and the bridge hand become the bridge. Wedge your thumb under the rail and curl a finger over the cue. This is one of the most stable bridges possible, allowing a more accurate break even at hard speeds.  Hitting the rack: hit the 2nd ball full on. Apply center to low english with a touch of right (if shooting from the right rail). The center/low english brings the cueball straight out to the side rail, and the touch of right brings the cueball back toward center table off the rebound. Hit the rack crisp and firm but controlled for maximum chance to pocket a ball. Play with the english until you get consistent results with the cueball. This is the most consistent break I have found, rarely a scratch (a stray ball knocks the cueball in every blue moon.)  Rack position: Be sure to place the apex ball ON or IN FRONT of the spot, never BEHIND. The rack rarely sits exactly ON the spot, so if anything place it forward a touch. Placing it FORWARD increases chances of pocketing a ball, whereas placing BEHIND the spot severely decreases the chances. This is assuming the rack is fairly tight. Millimeters count here! If you rack for yourself, rack ON or FORWARD. If the rack is from your opponent, inspect and insist it must not be BEHIND the spot.  Pattern racking: If you rack your own and patterns are permitted (or go unnoticed ;), rack as shown in the image I linked to above: 1 ball in front, four SOLIDS surrounding the back side of the 8, and the remaining two solids on the left or right side of the last row. This will maximize the chances of spreading the stripes nearer the pockets more often than not. I'd say it makes a 50-70% difference, huge for running out!  That is about all I can think of regarding 8 ball barbox breaks. I've used it in leagues for some years with devastating results. :D For a break cue, I like a lighter cue 17-18 oz, and the hardest tip I can find. Phenolic if its legal."
billiards,349ltr,hivemind_MVGC,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:27:39 2015 UTC,"I really only play 9-ball on 9-foot tables these days, mostly my own.   I break about 8"" from the right rail, on the headstring. I use an open bridge and hurl my entire body at the cue ball with a huge follow-through.   Yes, I'm that guy - but I almost always make 1-3 balls on the break, and the rest are nicely scattered."
billiards,349ltr,jpkaina,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:57:08 2015 UTC,"My breaks...   8 ball: Half a diamond either right or left of the spot, back about 8-10 inches from the short rail. I use a rail bridge with just a touch of follow to stop the cue ball after contact with the head ball. I sometimes use the second ball break, but its too difficult to control the cue ball for ne with that break.   9 ball: I break from the left side rail, about a ball and a half away. Rail bridge, and a touch of draw. I just shoot an over amped stop shot for nine ball.   General: I usually keep my weight on my back foot, then rock forward. A longer bridge is always recommended on the break to help generate power. Another thing I do, and I learned this from watching Earl Strickland, and that is that I let go of the cue out of my bridge hand on my follow through.  I've seen players like Mike Siegel, who plant the tip in the cloth and flex the shaft actually snap shafts because of all the lateral pressure they are applying.   All I can say is develop your own style. Watch the pros and see what appeals to you, and try to emulate them."

Goal is to place the cue ball closer to the center of the table, get a good scatter, and sink a stripe. From there, it's trying to run out.  9-ball: about two fingers' distance from the rail on the headstring, full force break aiming straight at the 1 ball. Scatter and sink a ball. If not, usually leaves a reasonable safety shot.  10-ball: Don't play enough to have a good breaking system yet, but as of now I do something similar to my 8-ball break.

TimmersOG has already covered the one place I have not been yet, so I will skip to the others.  If you're going to be downtown with limited transportation, there are three downtown bars that have pool tables, but nothing great.  Baileys is a nice bar, but limited pool tables and not that great of condition. (2 bar tops)  Buffalo's Billiards is upstairs above Coyote Ugly, it has a relaxed atmosphere, however tables are not in that great of condition either last time I was there (I think they have 4+ bar tables).  Flying Saucer is an awesome bar with a ton of beers on tap. They have two ok bar tops (coin operated only though). Smoke Free!  Little bit out of downtown is Melrose Billiards. They have 8 decent bar tables and a snooker table. Bit of a college scene, they have really good food on 12th avenue (just couple blocks over). We have been frequently going to this pool hall as of late leading to this being my recommendation.  If for some reason your wife's conference is at the Opryland Hotel, there are 6 (i believe 9ft) tables at Dave & Busters. Decent condition as long as you get either of the back two tables. Can also check out the mall and everything while you are there too. And it is smoke free.  Lastly, the pool hall with the best tables around Nashville, is probably Job Billiards Club. They have 25+ Diamond bar tables, 3 9ft tables, and a snooker table. If you are downtown, it might be a bit of a drive though.  Let me know if you have any other questions! Feel free to check out the Nashville Subreddit for any other questions."

billiards,349nxj,basherguy,2,Wed Apr 29 12:13:58 2015 UTC,"Burnishing is a way of making a rough surface smoother. People use cloths and pieces of leather to cause friction on their shaft and smooth out any imperfections.  The darker color you are seeing on other cues isn't due to this though, that's a natural side-effect of playing pool where chalk dust and hand oils will build up on the cue. If it isn't cleaned off regularly, you get the patina.  So I guess the answer to your question is play pool with your new cue and don't sand it any more. You'll get the worn-in look in no time."

billiards,348tod,grlldcheese87,2,Wed Apr 29 11:08:38 2015 UTC,"It is surprising that the league operator would get so pissed given that he set the parameters for the game.   How many points was he giving you at the start? 150 point games can be lengthy, even for professionals. I've watched Max Eberle take over 4 hours to make that many. That was painful as a spectator, I can only imagine how his opponent must have been feeling.   From experience though, it can be demoralizing and downright stressful to sit in the chair while your opponent painstakingly lines up seemingly simple shots.   I'm not saying you should speed up or change your style but I would recognize that your pace is probably slower than average and that could make you unpopular. Over time though you'll probably get more comfortable and your natural rhythm will speed up.   But what to do now? If there are no other 14.1 leagues in the area, you may just have to keep playing with the locals and see if you can get back in next season. You could mention it to the room manager or owner but I doubt it will make you any more likely to be accepted."

billiards,348tod,bobmacpherson,2,Wed Apr 29 15:14:45 2015 UTC,"Often players who grew up or mostly play the faster one rack games are in it for the instant gratification rush and have a hard time with the pace of straight pool. This is not a game with built in instructions. This is the ultimate test of a player. Learn to play correctly first then speed up later. This is not tiddlywinks winks here. Never has a time limit or shall we say a shot clock been implemented in straight pool that has been used effectively for a series of pro tournaments. All of my high runs over 100 have happened when I played slowly, deliberately, and at my own pace. Be polite to these people, smile at them, and when it's your turn shoot their nuts in. Keep up the good work."

Out of everyone, this cunt needs to be the most calm and rational. It makes no sense for a league to try to draw in newer players while enforcing  such a time limit. If a new player is playing slow, then change the handicap. What they are doing (asking you to speed up) is just them being lazy.  Anyway, don't speed up your game beyond your comfort level. You will naturally speed up as you become more experienced and skilled. Speeding up prematurely will harm your development.   Hope you will find a better replacement soon!"

We have a player on our team that is an APA 4/5 and he plays slow...to a fault.  He over-analyzes every shot before going into his PSR.  He's consistently in the 40-60 sec range for almost every shot...longer for anything that is remotely challenging.

billiards,346som,Rtv08c,2,Tue Apr 28 19:27:07 2015 UTC,Here is a secret.  Save your money on a break cue.  Inspect the rack after your opponent finishes and demand a good rack.  You will be getting the best breaks you've ever had without ever using any power.
billiards,346som,outside_english,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:42:42 2015 UTC,This is the best advice on breaking in APA leagues that there is.  I once had a guy re-rack 15 times before he got the head ball set. All the while his captain is telling him (in Spanish) not to help me or give me an advantage.
billiards,346som,petermgates,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:36:10 2015 UTC,Yep it's just pathetic.  I have spent entire matches not trying to shoot well but to figure out how to even make the rack scatter semi decently.  Learned a long time ago that the best technology and most dollars spent on a break cue won't help if the rack has gaps between each and every ball.
billiards,346som,outside_english,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:19:57 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't mind a shitty rack. I love picking apart a cluster in the middle of the table, and unless I'm playing a 7 I'm probably going to win that game."
billiards,346som,dalgeek,2,Thu Apr 30 03:16:48 2015 UTC,But would you deliberately give your opponent a shitty rack because you knew you might have an advantage?

billiards,346som,dalgeek,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:58:06 2015 UTC,There are a lot of break cues that come with phenolic tips. Do some research and see if any bars in the league ban phenolic tips. If you own your own table I'd recommend against a break cue with a phenolic tip since its detrimental to the cue ball over the long term.
billiards,346som,sfc949,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:33:25 2015 UTC,This whole post was a sham.
billiards,346som,vitalxx,2,Tue Apr 28 19:50:30 2015 UTC,I just looked through the team manual again and can't find any reference to either phenolic tipped or heavier than 25 oz. cues being disallowed.  In fact there is a blog entry on the APA site stating that some players like to use phenolic tips.  Local leagues are allowed to rule on equipment not specifically covered in the team manual so it is possible a rule is in effect in your area  There was for a time a ban on phenolic tips under the BCAPL rules and these do disallow cues heavier than 25 oz. You have been able to use phenolic tips in BCAPL leagues now since 2012.

billiards,346som,vitalxx,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:42:41 2015 UTC,"You just have to try it. No amount of advice will replace feeling how it breaks for yourself. Everywhere you play ask to try other's break cues. As for the tip i'd recommend a phenolic ferrule with a thin, hard leather tip, so you get just a slight bit of cue control as opposed to straight phenolic."
billiards,346som,fastereddiefelson,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:32:59 2015 UTC,"It depends on how much money you're willing to spend.  You could blow $400 on a shiny new Predator BKIII or you could repurpose an old cue that you have lying around.  Realistically I doubt you want to break the bank on your first break cue. You can probably pick something up around the $100-150 mark that will work just fine.  Conventional wisdom (as I understand it) is that light is better (~18 oz.) and gives you more control. More weight supposedly doesn't actually help you break any harder or faster. For the most part though, it's a question of what feels good for you.  The advice regarding phenolic tips is sound. It's kind of difficult to find a break cue that ships with anything but phenolic but there are leather tips that are said to be as hard as phenolic (e.g. Samsara) and hybrid leather/phenolic tips (e.g. Tiger Icebreaker) out there that may be worth researching.  So what is it you like about your teammates' cues and do you know specifically what they have?  I always used a house cue to break or borrowed one until I first played in a tournament where there were none. Now I use my old Fury playing cue with a water buffalo leather tip on it. Gets the job done.  Edit: clarification on weight"

billiards,343obs,hello_bolo,2,Tue Apr 28 01:25:31 2015 UTC,"Looks like a rosewood cue. I'd expect it could easily last a lifetime if properly cared for. Cues made from quality woods like this one can stand up to lots of use and be a dependable cue for many generations to come.   The brass joint looks to be in good shape, and the shaft appears relatively straight judging by the one angled pic. Could be a well-seasoned cue that is simple and classy and worth holding on to. Cues develop most of their structural problems fairly early in their lives due to poor quality of woods, wood preparation, or construction methods and schedules. If a cue like this survives several decades of use and still looks good, then the chances of any future problems are about as small as you could get. This cue would be a great candidate for a thorough work-over and clean up by your local cue maker. Have the shaft reconditioned and a new tip installed and this cue will be ready for some serious action."

He has been an innovator in new techniques that have led to different rules changes over the years. He thinks outside the box and did his homework and came up with another crazy break. Corey double dipped john at Chinook Winds 8ball, beat him two sets at Smokin Aces, and now this one for five straight wins on John in tournament play. I think his frustration showed alittle. John had his chances in that match."
billiards,341q4i,redditis4queers,2,Mon Apr 27 16:59:54 2015 UTC,Corey has done some crazy stuff with the break. There was a time where he used the rest or the rake; wrapped it around his arm and instead of his bridge hand to break.  I think he might have also invented the soft break in 9 ball.

billiards,341q4i,sphigel,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:40:00 2015 UTC,I dunno how i feel about this.  Is he able to easily run out after this break?  It's not exactly wide open even though opponents balls are bunched.  I'd be annoyed too if my opponent was racking like that to get a 1 ball advantage.  But I'd also be pretty excited to try and safety him behind that remaining bunch.    If he beat me five times that way i might seriously rage quit.  I guess that right there makes it a sound strategy.

billiards,341q4i,9intheside,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:21:35 2015 UTC,"All stripes and the 8.  So if he's going to run out, he has to break up that cluster.  And if he doesn't want to screw himself, he should break the cluster when he still has some well-situated insurance balls.  And if he's going to break the cluster early, what's the value in leaving it?  I guess it makes it easier for him to play safe before breaking it up if he needs, since the opponent doesn't have a lot of options for escape with all his balls in the same place."
billiards,341q4i,ac120205,0,Wed Apr 29 15:09:47 2015 UTC,Why are they his solids? Are they not playing BCA where it's open after the break no matter what? Doesn't look like he has a great shot on ant solid.
billiards,341q4i,jediofpool,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:41:13 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they were playing take what you make on the break shot.  Cory just did this same break in a tournament this weekend (possibly what the video is from) and that tournament was take what you make.  If you make an even number of solids and stripes it's still open but if you make more of either group you have to choose that group.  It definitely changes the dynamic of the game.  Also, notice that Cory is pattern racking so that all of the solids open up and the stripes are almost completely tied up."

Also I know of leagues where in 9 ball a game is won by sinking the 9 ball, and you must win a set number of games based of your and your opponents SL. In my league that's how 8 ball is played. But in thier league 8 ball is played by each ball being a point, and you race to a set amount of points, which is how my 9 ball is played.  Basically they way they are played are Flip flopped."

It gives players of lower skill levels (< SL4) equal footing. In a team that has a spread of skill levels, most of the members of my team who are not SL4 and SL5 split matches from week to week and end up playing less matches.  In the old system, the SL4 and SL5 who were good enough to beat higher skill levels got a lot more total points.   It was not fair to lower skill level players because those players usually played others of the same skill level."

billiards,33xttp,raptorapture,3,Mon Apr 27 00:13:22 2015 UTC,"Been playing pool for about 10 years now. Was taught pool the correct way from the beginning as far as fundamentals and strategy go.  I learned pool playing with a 314 shaft and recently switched to z2 within the last couple years. In the midst I won a poison cue in a raffle and played with it for awhile as it really reminded me of the 314 in regards to deflection and hit. From what I've been told poison is actually made by Predator so the similar hit and shaft flex are very similar. I've developed a pretty sensitive feel for cues and play with mostly low deflection cues,  the poison cue I tried ended up having slightly more deflection than he 3142 shaft and thus I couldn't consistently make certain shots in which alot deflection compensation was involved.  However this is only because I am not used to playing with anything with a higher deflection than a 3142.  All this considered of all the cues I've played with i have always really liked Predator because they are the only shafts in which you get enough feedback in the hit to just know when you hit a shot good.  You can feel a certain vibration in the shaft to where you can say,  ""man i stroked the shit out of that shot."" I've tried many other brands but only the Predator has been able to give me that feeling.    Until I tried the poison it's the only other cue that has given me the same thing and for a fraction of the price with the exception of having a little more deflection. With that in mind I think you'll really enjoy poison."

billiards,33uaqt,Skeptitroll,3,Sat Apr 25 18:18:36 2015 UTC,"I frequent both subs. If you post this question over at /r/snooker, people will definitely respond. Sure, it seems like the sub is dead, and /r/billiards definitely has a wider variety in discussion topics. But you can still get very good answers from /r/snooker.  Anyway, for your question...   I wouldn't worry too much about the brand. The differences are not as significant as in pool. Snooker balls are smaller and lighter. You don't need to stroke nearly as hard as you would in pool. The typical considerations in pool cue selection generally don't apply here. There are more important considerations, which I'll get to after the next point. You should start with a 9mm tip. That's the standard. Some pros would deviate by 0.5mm out of pure preference. Rarely would anyone go beyond that. The tip variation was more pronounced during Hendry's time. But that's way out of flavor now. Take a stab with a 9mm tip and see how you like it. If you start pulling 30+ breaks very very regularly and feel you need a smaller or larger tip, then go for it. But I wouldn't bother if you can't at least have 30+ breaks. Here in Europe, it's not common at all to go into a cue shop and see anything other than 9mm tipped snooker shafts. Here's the MOST important consideration when it comes to snooker cue selection: sectional setup. Do you want a three-piece or a two-piece? If you want a two-piece, do you want a 50/50 split like a pool cue or the typical 80/20?   Three-piece cues are easier to carry. Typically, the case is the same size as a pool cue case. You won't have to worry about hitting people when you walk around. But with two joints, you are going to suffer a lot of feedback. Since in snooker you hit very lightly in a lot of situations, not getting feedback for a large set of shots could be very damaging to your game.   Two-piece 50/50 split cues... don't get those. Period. Do you want to get a crappy cork-like cue? This is how you get a crappy cork-like cue. Sure, there are some good ones; but you better try it out before you buy. Generally, they are simply crappy pool cues turned down to look like snooker cues.  Two-piece 80/20 split cues are what I would STRONGLY recommend. It's night and day shooting with those. The case will be huge, and you will catch a LOT of attention walking anywhere with it. But the moment you take a shot with one of those, you will instantly notice the feedback. Even on the lightest shots, you can feel how the cue torques upon impact. You will know you screwed up way before you get visual confirmation. This is the primary reason why all pros shoot with those.   I had a three-piece my whole life, because they are cheaper. But I often competed with friends' two-piece cues. Just recently, I finally saved up enough to get a two-piece. I feel like I just rediscovered the game. So, if you can afford one, do yourself a big favor and start with a two-piece 80/20 split cue."
billiards,33uaqt,HappySoda,1 point,Sun Apr 26 08:42:58 2015 UTC,"All good advice from /u/happysoda  Another important point to note is that, aside from a narrower tip, snooker cues are constructed differently than pool cues. An american-style billiard cue will typically have a maple shaft and will be weighted more towards the butt of the cue (the shaft is lighter).  A snooker cue will usually be made mostly from ash and you will see the distinctive grain pattern in the shaft. The weighting will be more towards the front as well.  How this affects the hit and whether it will affect how you play with it is highly subjective. I only wanted to give you a bit more information.  Looking at the offerings from Pooldawg, I am having difficulty telling what is two-piece, what is three-piece and who makes what. It doesn't look like they know much about their products. Trouble is, there are very few options in the US.  I don't know what your budget is but parhaps getting one sent from the UK could be an option. I've used billiardboutique.co.uk in the past and found them to be reliable.  /u/happysoda also mentioned the attention a 3/4 cue case gets. I once had someone on the train ask me if I had a sword in there. Because of course, that's the first thing that comes to mind..."

billiards,33u9dn,dalgeek,2,Mon Apr 27 19:32:37 2015 UTC,"Haven't seen anything like that, even when there is betting involved. Many players aren't even aware of the ""call shot, call safe"" rule in my area.  The local BCA bylaws do limit the 9 on the snap to the front 4 pockets because it's too easy to put the 9 into the two corners by the rack. If you hit the 9 into the back corners then it's either spotted and you shoot from where the cue ball is or you rerack."
billiards,33u9dn,petermgates,2,Sat Apr 25 18:52:51 2015 UTC,"Which pro tournaments have they been playing call shot 9 ball?  As far as I was aware, you never have to call your pocket which is one reason that 10 ball became preferred amongst pros.   In my area tournaments such as the Predator pro-am use a modified 9 ball rule set similar to what /u/dalgeek mentioned regarding respotting the 9 if it's made on the break. It's rack your own, winner breaks and you break from anywhere in the kitchen.   I once played in a 9 ball league where higher rated players had to call their shots and lower rated players didn't. It caused a lot of arguments though and got dropped after a season."

Names of article  Filipinos:       The name Filipino was derived from the term ""las Islas Filipinas"" (""the Philippine Islands""),  the name given to the archipelago in 1543 by the Spanish explorer and Dominican priest Ruy López de Villalobos, in honour of Philip II of Spain. The lack of the letter ""F"" in the pre-1987 Philippine alphabet, Abakada, had caused the letter ""F"" to be substituted with ""P"". Upon official adoption of the modern, 28-letter Filipino alphabet in 1987, the name Filipino was preferred over Pilipino.

billiards,33mpkq,joeprentice90,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:04:04 2015 UTC,Red dot for sure....make sure you don't get a fake. It should have a slight tint of yellow in it. If it's clean-white it's a fake. Don't get the cyclop ball set. It's popular right now but they get beat up quick.
billiards,33mt7g,stogas,3,Thu Apr 23 20:13:16 2015 UTC,"I was in this same situation when I was in school.  I shot skeet competitively until I couldn't afford it and soon found pool to be a cheaper alternative yet anything but free.  What I found was at certain pool halls there were a few regulars who didn't pay for anything.  They were there almost everyday and got free pool and even booze.  I started hanging out there enough until I got the same treatment.  Date a bartender or at least sleep with one can help.  My last 2 years of college I started dating a bartender at a local pool hall that had amazing burgers, steak, and chicken sandwiches.   Everyday I would eat, drink, and play till my hearts content.  Grades suffered but my pool game skyrocketed."
billiards,33mt7g,dirtyduo,2,Sat Apr 25 01:10:17 2015 UTC,"I found a strange private club near where I live that has a small annual member fee. Not sure how common places like that are but they have two bowling lanes in the basement along with a bar table, 8 footer and a 6x12. Haven't joined yet as I just have a cheap table in my house right now. Other than that I've seen a lot of apartment buildings with game rooms that were tempting but I'm guessing you weren't thinking anything as extreme as moving. Other than that maybe find a local bar with a table, and in their down time could maybe make a deal for a flat rate to open the table for you. Though that'd be a stretch unless it's a chill owner.  I feel your pain on this subject, had a cheap hall I used to go to but it shut down. At least you aren't into golf, if you want to look on the bright side :S"
billiards,33mt7g,mattdebrown,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:44:02 2015 UTC,i found one small hole in the wall on the outskirts of town they sell beer to go. The owner opens the table and lets me play as much as I want for 10$. it so happens that its the best bar tables in the area. and it is the emptiest bar you'll ever step foot in. I then realized how important pool is. I'd rather make balls and improve my game level than split and share time in a crowd infested atmosphere. Anyother place I too noticed regulars get the better end so I still travel and make apperances.
billiards,33mzjy,stogas,3,Thu Apr 23 21:00:04 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest benefit to shooting with both hands is you never have to use the bridge stick. When I play by myself, I'll shoot righty against lefty and I'm at a point where I win with my offhand about 40% of the time.  I don't think you should always play with your offhand and expect better results though. You may have been overthinking things that day with your right and shot better lefty because you weren't overanalyzing your shot?"
billiards,33mzjy,BlackLabLover,1 point,Sat Apr 25 05:17:10 2015 UTC,"I agree. Shooting with both hands has its benefits, but it was much more likely that switching hands that match changed you mental state which increased your skill. With that said keep that trick in mind for next time you are struggling, as it may work again."
billiards,33mzjy,SousaphonePwn,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:51:28 2015 UTC,"I started shooting off-hand (left-handed) when I played doubles with a left-handed partner. I got tired of having to depend on my partner to leave me a good right-handed shot. It became a regular weekend thing to play at least a set of off-hand matches with my buddies. A couple years later I would say that I'm at least 75% as well with my left hand.  There are some shots I actually do better left-handed for a few reasons. First, I'm left eye dominant, so it's easier to aim when I'm shooting left-handed.  Second, my left hand is not as dexterous as my right hand, so I'm forced to stick to the fundamentals so my stroke is perfectly straight and natural. For a while I could draw twice as well left-handed  Not having to use a bridge as often is definitely a huge benefit. Also, it kind of fucks with your opponent when you casually swap hands and sink a shot like it's nothing ;)"

He has no problems switching hands and has told me that some days one side just feels bad so he sticks with the other.    He says its just some weird thing about his brain at certain times and leaves it at that.  What I do know is that he makes a great doubles partner for me being a tall lefty with off cue ball control.

I don't know why or how I'm able to put draw on the ball more effectively with one hand but I won't question it."
billiards,33jy5e,SirNoobs,5,Thu Apr 23 03:05:29 2015 UTC,Good shoot but I'm guessing he planned to pass between the 4 and 2 not the 4 and 3.  The window he hit was way too small to play for IMO.

He has a huge window to travel the line to that last rail to get on the 2, and there is simply no believable way anyone would intentionally choose to go through that 1.300"" gap between those balls when there is a 10"" wide window between the rail and the 4 if they move their line a few inches south.

billiards,33jy5e,Sapanther,0,Thu Apr 23 09:43:43 2015 UTC,"This is a perfect example on how to use English,  he used a lot of left hand English,  but he basically set up his stance like a straight shot,  his stroke is perfectly straight just aligned on the left side of the cue.  A lot of beginners and even experienced players, don't visually the shot like this, they set up aiming at the contact point (compensating for throw and deflection)  but don't take account that the shot should be approached as 'straight'.  Some tend to set up as if it's center ball and just point the cue to the left side, causing ur stroke to go from center to left instead of perfect straight on the left side of the cue ball."

billiards,33jy5e,outside_english,0,Thu Apr 23 19:30:08 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you setup aiming straight on the english with the spin induced throw taken into consideration. That is the hard part imo (amateur opinion), and can only be mastered by playing a lot."
billiards,33jy5e,agntkay,0,Thu Apr 23 19:45:53 2015 UTC,"exactly. it takes time on the table for sure, it also brings up the debate on newer technology and low deflection shafts.. I recently played a ring 9 game with a few guys. One of the gentlemen did not have his playing cue and just played with one of the other guys cues...  I couldn't even tell you the amount of times he mentioned or stated... ""Man!!! If only I had my OB cue!""... ""wow man this cue sucks!"" (a custom Meucci). I mean .. sure if you've never shot pool with anything else except a low deflection then shooting with anythign else would seem ""redundant"".  I've tried OB cues and I can see that the yes the deflection is lower...but it's just not the same for me. It will always be a debate...but the low deflection shafts just seem like a really stiff push type feeling rather than a marshmallow feel when you stroke the rock."
billiards,33jy5e,JonLivestrong,0,Thu Apr 23 19:57:39 2015 UTC,"wow.. you've gone on a tangent there :)  and am feeling like I should remain silent but here goes, I love the low deflection shaft."

Hopefully, he will make this a regular addition to his game.   Pool halls are filled with guys who can beat you down and complain about everything while they do it. There is absolutely nothing novel or legendary about that.   To have such a gift of natural talent, and to have the humbleness and selflessness to recognize those around you who have walked down that very same road and helped you (directly or indirectly) achieve your success... now that is how you want your legacy to unfold. You want the highlight reels and the commentary to be filled with examples like this one, regardless of who wins the match. When you are lying there breathing your last few precious breaths, all that money won't mean a thing to you. I suspect your last fleeting memories will be of the way you will be remembered by everyone. You won't be able to lie to yourself and make yourself believe in any fantasy.

billiards,33h2yk,VoodooDrugLab,3,Wed Apr 22 13:52:06 2015 UTC,"Just keep doing it. Make sure you're using a good break ball to start off and the more you practice it the better your break balls will be from the start, you'll get a better spread and not a ton of clusters consistently, and have a higher percentage of getting through that first rack, and picking a good pattern at the end of the rack to set yourself up for a nice break ball.  Keep on keepin' on is what I'm saying."
billiards,33h2yk,BobPlager,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:01:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured.  It just takes a lot of focus.  Such a tough game."
billiards,33h2yk,redditor1983,2,Wed Apr 22 14:44:04 2015 UTC,"Your mistake is that you're starting your practice session with a safety break. Even though it's important to practice a safety break, that's counter-productive to your practice session.  Break the balls wide open for your first break, and then play regular straight pool from there on out.  Practice your safety break by itself at a later time. The strategy play that comes from a safety break can only truly be practiced with an opponent anyway.  Here is a video of John Schmidt (one of the best straight pool players in the world) running 245 balls. He starts the session with a wide open break."
billiards,33h2yk,Bwtadpole,1 point,Thu Apr 23 00:44:44 2015 UTC,"I always start my straight pool practice with a gimmie break shot. I place the break ball on the shelf of one of the side pockets. It's hard to mess that up. Once you pop the rack open, the rest is on you to deliver."
billiards,33h2yk,Bwtadpole,2,Wed Apr 22 14:58:40 2015 UTC,"I thought of that, but it seemed like taking the easy way out. However, if doing something like that will get me to practice straight pool more often, I suppose it's worth it.  Unfortunately, I'll likely never play straight pool against an opponent.  I live in an area where pool is dead.  There are only a few halls within a 50 mile radius of where I live.  :("
billiards,33h2yk,graham6942,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:06:42 2015 UTC,"Boo-urns to that! How close is the nearest hall for you? I feel spoiled now, having two halls within a five-minute drive.  As I mentioned in another response, it's a cheap, non-ideal break shot, but you will make the break ball, and you'll get the rack open some. After that, it's up to us to set up the subsequent break shots without the benefit of hand-picking the shot."
billiards,33h2yk,BobPlager,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:26:47 2015 UTC,"The nearest hall to me is exactly 15 miles away (about a 25 minutes drive).

billiards,33h2yk,petermgates,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:50:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's a very good break ball. If you practice one that puts you on the tangent line of the rack where you can hit it flush and hold the cue ball somewhere near the middle of the table, that's ideal, and i feel like your break ball makes that tough. I suggest getting to know jon Schmidt's center table break ball; it's a bit tough to master but once you do it's a great break ball."
billiards,33h2yk,BobPlager,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:44:46 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree, there are better break shots. But when I just want to get the wheels spinning without worrying about missing the break ball at all, I'll use the side pocket.   I'm familiar with how John Schmidt and other pros start their runs in straight pool challenges, when they have free choice of their first break ball. This just works for me, and I still have to set up and play effective break shots later in my runs without the benefit of hand-placing the shot."
billiards,33h2yk,petermgates,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:23:00 2015 UTC,Is that center table going straight into the top of the stack or off the short rail into the back of the stack?
billiards,33h2yk,petermgates,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:31:16 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpYppApyHhQ  You probably don't want to start off with a ball-in-hand break ball by going into the bottom of the stack; bit risky it can get stuck somewhere I'd say. I think it's a fine break shot if it's your best break ball option on the table mid-run, but I always start with the one John uses here.  To each his own but that's my recommendation"
billiards,33h2yk,Bwtadpole,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:30:48 2015 UTC,"I wasn't aware that it was a John Schmidt thing. Ralf Souquet tends to use it also.  Anyway, I agree completely. If you have ball-in-hand then you want to get the best spread you can. I prefer side of the rack personally to try and keep whitey under control."
billiards,33h2yk,petermgates,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:37:10 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, when you shoot this break ball, where do you prefer to have the cue ball contact the stack?"
billiards,33h2yk,petermgates,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:18:19 2015 UTC,"I'm just trying to hit the nose of the rack. Anything on the side face of the rack is a glancing hit putting you towards a corner pocket, or even worse, scratching off.  Center ball hit so the cue ball doesn't drive itself to the foot rail after contact.  There are better break shots for cue ball control and spread, but this works well enough."
billiards,33h2yk,petermgates,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:29:45 2015 UTC,It sure does work - there's virtually no chance of not making the ball which always helps.

billiards,33h2yk,jondrums,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:19:49 2015 UTC,"graze the corner ball and try to bring the cue back to the headstring.  Then it's a battle of playing safety against myself until something opens up.  Once I open up the rack, I go for it."

Newburgh which is a bit west of you (i84) hosts APA tournaments usually once a month or so at Bleupers Billiards, but you must be part of the APA.

Back in my early 20's I only had one option for watching pool matches on TV and that was ESPN.  I have a box filled to the brim of ESPN pool matches on VHS.   Yeah, I just linked a Wiki for you just in case.  Now you know as well as I do that pool doesn't get the recognition it deserves.  So the marketing team over at ESPN decided they needed something flashy that will draw in a bigger pool crowd, and that was Trick Shot Magic.  Don't get me wrong, these guys are still fantastic pool players. Mike Massey, Tom Rossman, Andy Segal.  They can all give any pool player a run for their money.  Now you have Venom all over the web doing his thing.  But if it brings more fans than it is what it is.  So for that I respect it.  but.....  trick shots are not real pool.

The dress code is rather relaxed now, however it used to be rather restrictive, hence the revisions.  I agree that the clothing will never make one a better player, but it does prevent the sport from becoming more like a convention and it keeps the sport professional and dignified"
billiards,33deyn,russharv9,3,Tue Apr 21 17:15:50 2015 UTC,"keeps the sport professional and dignified     If pool players think their image is one of professionalism and dignity, then as a group we are way more delusional than I thought. The public image of a pool player is about on par with that of a poker player. We are seen as gamblers, hustlers and sharks that thrive in low-lit back-alley bars hustling suckers at 3am.    An easy way to determine how any sub-group of people are seen by the public eye is to look at how they're portrayed in realistic fiction such as TV shows and movies. How do pool players look?"
billiards,33deyn,joshuarion,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:45:50 2015 UTC,"I actually look at pool in two ways: as a sport and a game.  Actually, any athletic/competitive event can be viewed this way.  The image you described, of us as sharks or hustlers, is the way I view the sport as a game because they aren't playing to get better, they're playing to win cheap victories that pay chump change.  Sport is about more than the actual activity going on, it's about the attitude and the atmosphere.  They don't televise the sharks hustling suckers, do they?  No, they televise the professionals who have trained to be good at this because it's something they're passionate about.  You keep your sport dignified and let the rest of them play games."

To a degree I agree because, of course, there's a difference in attitude of the World Cup of Pool Final Match and some guy hustlin' at Hard Times...    So I guess if your intention is to keep 'pro pool professional and dignified', then okay, I guess we can just talk about that...    Is a dress code the main issue here between 'dignified' and 'undignified'? Because honestly, you can put Scott Frost in a tux and that dude will still seem like a skeezy hustler. You can make Earl wear a jacket and tie and he'll still break sticks and tell the other player he 'just got lucky'... Conversely, I am 100% sure that if you tattoo'd Shane Van Boening and put him in a set of biker leathers, he'd still act like a Gentleman.    So in the end, I'd agree that (to a degree) a dress code for major tournaments could probably be reasonably enforced and there are some merits to it... But where we disagree is that I don't think a dress code is even a issue when it comes to making the sport or the game dignified, professional or respected.    Just my .02 :)"

billiards,33deyn,fadedcheese,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:21:32 2015 UTC,I know Accu-Stats won't. At the Southern Classic they moved Shannon Daulton to the arena table. He had been wearing shorts and a collared shirt. They made him take the 20 min shuttle to change his pants before they would let him play his match. As the sponsors I think they have a right to say that. They want a certain image maintained while selling a product. They they are paying for the right to have it.  The tucked in shirt rule is nice because it sucks playing a match while having to stare at some guys ass crack the whole time. Pro sports like baseball and basketball don't let people play in anything they want. So why should pool be any different? When it's a casual pickup game or something they can be more casual but at the higher levels a bit more professionalism is a good thing.

billiards,33any7,sfc949,-3,Tue Apr 21 00:26:44 2015 UTC,Really? I hate diamond tables.
billiards,33any7,Hydris,2,Tue Apr 21 01:24:26 2015 UTC,"Diamonds are the most consistent tables out there. I grew up playing on Gold Crowns and if I went to a different venue that had Gold Crowns they usually played different than the ones I played on at my home turf.   When I became a manager of a different pool hall, we had all Diamonds installed, and after getting used to them, it never took me time to get the feel of a Diamond at a different venue. The pockets are the same size, and they are cut identically. Didn't have to worry about the rails playing short or long, they almost always played the same way unless it was humid or the table was near an air conditioner on full blast.  Once I got used to Diamonds I realized how great they really are."

billiards,339yq6,lolasaurusrex1234,1 point,Tue Apr 21 00:31:35 2015 UTC,Actually spot 7 is one of the easiest.  It's a half ball shot.  Just aim your cue directly at the edge of the object ball and it rolls in like magic.  I use that exact spot in one pocket to make the spot shot after a scratch.  Edit... misveiwed spot 7... the half ball shot is actually forward of spot 7.  2 diamonds up from head rail... one diamond over.

billiards,33b45j,Liquidicity,2,Tue Apr 21 07:44:43 2015 UTC,"you're correct in that you have identified something you are practicing which is not working for you. there are many ways to go about getting better, but there has to be some structure to your practice just as in any game or sport. whatever keeps you motivated and enjoying yourself is very important in progression. you have to have fun- believe in what you are doing, and be motivated to practice, regardless of how good you want to become.  think of pool as any other game or sport in that the first steps are learning good physical form. we call this the 'mechanics' in pool. this is the foundation for everything else you will learn in this game. without good and solid mechanics, your progression will be slower.  mechanics is something that takes a lot of deliberate practice, and is something that requires a lot of upkeep.   http://billiards.colostate.edu/normal_videos/index.html -here is a good learning website with a ton of instructional videos and other information about the game. this is a great video also- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pm-VDuGzJS4 & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUJwbfbACf8there there are also many other instructional videos on youtube, some are good and some are bad. but everyone is different physically and mentally. so there is no one correct answer. what works for some wont work for others, people have different bodies and minds.  it is great that you have a table at home that you have to practice on. although, pool is a social game. you can learn a lot of valuable information by getting out there to your local pool halls meeting and playing other players who have been around and are more experienced. join a weekly pool league and play better players, or get a professional instructor who can help you develop. but if you want to get better you need to get into contact with better players who know the game.  this is a great game to learn and is really fun once you start getting better. the game really opens up once you begin to get past the elementary basics and develop consistency."

billiards,33b45j,gotwired,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:44:16 2015 UTC,"One good piece of advice that I was given was to play 9 or 10 ball when playing by yourself. Rather than playing 8 ball and playing loose and having lots of options on the table, you've got 1 ball each shot. It forces you to think more about position than what shooting both sides of an 8 ball match does.  I love 8 ball, don't get me wrong, it's my favorite game. But when shooting by yourself I think that 9 or 10 ball is going to keep you sharper.   Other than that, I like running drills. I've come across a bit of people that are like, ""Screw drills, the only way to get better is to play people!"" I would agree with them when it comes to the mental aspect of the game: shot selection, big shot vs safety, etc. But the fundamentals of  the game you're only going to learn from doing over and over. Bad at draw back? Practice draw back. Bad at banks? Practice banks.  Most of the drills I run I've found online. YouTube, billiards university,  some videos I see posted to Facebook. Switch them up to keep them fun but run them frequently enough where you improve."

billiards,32vvhy,I_am_the_LION,2,Fri Apr 17 11:57:00 2015 UTC,"All leagues need to purge that silly rule.  A player should never be penalized when they make ball(s) on the break and don't foul. It puts you at a disadvantage more often than not, especially if you break and pocket several balls from your group. Every ball of your group that's pocketed on the break limits your options even further."
billiards,32vvhy,PulseAmplification,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:16:58 2015 UTC,"The reason they do that is because it favors the lower level player. There are lots of rules in the APA that are only there because they favor the lower level player. No jump cues, no push-outs, take what you make, etc."
billiards,32vvhy,DarkKnight2060,1 point,Sun Apr 19 08:01:57 2015 UTC,"And that's one of the reasons I dislike the APA- When players improve and go up in SL it can hurt the team. I played one season of APA about 15 years ago, and I was giving lessons to everyone on my team. Within a few weeks several players moved up in their skill level. This caused the team to go over the maximum points allowed and we ended up being forced to forfeit one match every time. Seeing how a team can get hurt when players improve, it's only natural that some teams will resort to cheating and decide to sandbag.   I ended up winning the MVP tournament and then the regional event to go to Vegas, and even though we were an 8-ball only team, when I heard that in 9-ball you can't push out after the break it became pretty clear that as you said, the system favors the lower level player. The problem with that, and the whole SL bullshit is that it doesn't promote actual improvement.   The APA is fine for players who don't take the game too serious and just want to go out for a social gathering, etc. But for someone who wants to improve and really likes competition, the APA works against that IMO."

You have to hit a shot a lot to know how to adjust for what english will do to the ball, how the ball will come off the object and rails, and heck - just learning the speed of the table takes skill and practice.

billiards,32uodp,Lxrge,6,Thu Apr 16 21:23:25 2015 UTC,"This looks to be potentially their best shaft they make in my opinion. One piece of solid maple, no ""hollow"" low deflection issues in the end of the shaft. I don't know exactly what their ferrule situation looks like (internally) on this model, it appears to be hard to find much info on what is inside this latest version. They are using a shorter ferrule, which makes me happy considering the super long 1.25"" ferrule they used to have was incredibly thin and weak and prone to cracking. Next to the Predator ferrule, Meucci made the second weakest ferrule on the market in my opinion. Hopefully this new ferrule style improves on that by a long shot. I'll have to cut into one to know for sure, though.   The Meucci website is abysmally bad right now, and it is pretty much just a giant wall of marketing hype without much technical info or anything that can really give me much to work with on forming opinions on what to expect prior to actually getting my hands on one of these shafts. Pretty much everything they have for sale is the ""greatest thing in history"" as tested 39 years ago by a metal fixture named the Myth Destroyer.   I grew up playing with the Meucci cues from the 80s and 90s, and I loved them. Same can be said for the McDermott cues of that era. I can't say I still maintain that level of fondness for their current products, although both companies seem to be making strides in improving their manufacturing processes once again.   If I had to speculate, I'd guess my favorite shaft they are making right now would either be their Ultimate Weapon shaft, or their ""no dot"" classic shaft. The UW shaft is apparently 11.6mm, which is very close to what I personally like to use, and they have a new short ferrule design that could potentially be a huge improvement over their old classic ferrule that appears to still be used on the no dot classic shaft. The little bit of info I could find indicates the UW shaft has a ""conical"" taper which I certainly do not prefer personally, but in most cases I can recut the taper and convert a conical shaft to a pro-style taper which I prefer.   Please keep in mind that all of this is purely speculation on my part. I haven't got my hands on a UW shaft yet, but they look like their best offering just based on the tiny bit of info I could scrounge up with a quick google search."

billiards,32s90p,gabrielleigh,1 point,Fri Apr 17 12:04:06 2015 UTC,"I do this all the time for my customers. Most tips are glued on with super glue, which is just polymerized acrylic plastic after it cures. I use a brand new razor blade and I lay the shaft down on a clean tabletop and I gently use the razor blade to slice off the tip from the end of the ferrule.   Sometimes this takes some considerable force, so be careful that you don't break the blade and injure yourself. But if you slice right down the spot where the tip leather is glued onto the ferrule, you can generally remove the tip without damaging it or losing much leather material and reuse it on another shaft.   This process is easy if the destination shaft is smaller in diameter than the donor shaft, but can still be accomplished with shafts of identical size if you are careful about gluing the tip onto the new shaft so that it lines up correctly. You can rubber-band a couple of shish-kabob skewers wrapped in wax paper to the end of the shaft to serve as a guide for gluing on the tip in the center of the shaft so it isn't off-center and hanging off one edge.   Sand the backside of the tip by laying a piece of sandpaper (grit side up) on a flat table and gently block-sanding the back side of the tip on the paper. I recommend using a thin super glue and avoid the gels. Put a generous droplet in the middle of the tip, then immediately blow some warm ""foggy breath"" on the glue droplet to help the curing process speed up a bit. Immediately install the tip and keep constant pressure on it for about a minute or two. Set the shaft aside and let the glue finish curing for about fifteen minutes, then clean up the installation and prepare the tip for play again.   Enjoy the money you saved by buying yourself a beer."
billiards,32rehk,bkirby1,7,Thu Apr 16 02:37:22 2015 UTC,Work on getting a square hit on your object ball before adding power.  Focus on following through.
billiards,32rehk,outside_english,3,Thu Apr 16 02:41:28 2015 UTC,"To add to this, work on controlling the cue ball after the break.  Slamming the ball at 25mph doesn't do you much good if it gets stuck in a nasty spot after the break. When I started playing 9-ball I focused on making the cue ball stop in the middle of the table. You can't do this unless you hit pretty much straight on, which means you'll also put all of the energy through the center of the rack. I had to take some speed off of my break, but I got better breaks.  Once you get the cue ball control down, start slowly adding power back.  Recently I've found that standing up (which brings your whole body forward) at the end of the break adds a couple mph to the cue ball without sacrificing much accuracy."
billiards,32rehk,dalgeek,2,Thu Apr 16 07:28:49 2015 UTC,"If you develop a good stroke, and practice fundamentals, your break will get stronger.  You didn't really specify which game you were talking about so it's difficult to really give you tips. 8 ball, 9 ball, 10 ball, straight pool, one pocket and bank pool all have different breaks, and there are many different theories for each game.   If control is something you lack on the break, try breaking less hard. Don't try to go beyond your strokes capability. You don't have to have an earth shattering break to make a ball or have an open table. The soft break is banned in many tournaments because it's extremely effective and was abused by a few pro's to the point of making it boring to watch."
billiards,32rehk,ceezaleez,1 point,Thu Apr 16 07:05:02 2015 UTC,"I play 9-ball mostly, and have difficulty getting a good break.

Everyone else who tries it breaks perfectly fine :("
billiards,32rehk,too_late_to_party,1 point,Thu Apr 16 08:25:26 2015 UTC,"really the break is the most athletic part about pool in the sense that there is a lot of timing involved. and it doesnt really matter your size.  its more about having good mechanics which will give you kinetic energy. it really does start with a good pendulum stroke though, with some major back swing.   put it this way- in any sport- baseball, golf, boxing etc- what makes a batter or a golfer or a boxer hit hard is not necessarily their size but rather the way they use their body to create force. same thing with the break. ive seen many many smaller players have tremendous breaks and it has nothing to do with their size.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKXykcdxJzM alex pagualayan is a tiny fella and can hit the rack wayyy harder than this, but this particular break was just effective because he knew where and how to hit the rack (watch his body when he breaks)  check out this video at 5:15 this lady has a crazy break https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgzgV8qzbRw"

billiards,32rehk,HappySoda,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:50:18 2015 UTC,"Probably like a snooker break or a 14.1 break, where you barely touch the corner ball or just enough to make the break legal, and freeze the cue ball on the top rail."
billiards,32rehk,FrancisCastiglione12,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:51:59 2015 UTC,"In nine ball, pros have perfected breaking where they hit the one ball slightly to one side, which usually makes the one ball in the side pocket and the wing ball in the corner pocket, and puts the cue ball back in the center of the table."
billiards,32rehk,ceezaleez,1 point,Thu Apr 16 22:36:31 2015 UTC,"Corey Deuel perfected the soft break around 2001, and used it to steam roll through the US Open that year, defeating Mika Immonen 11 - 0.  He is credited with changing the game, and many tournament organizers began implementing rules to make this break illegal, with the ""3 balls passed the headstring"" rule finally being settled on.   Here's him running an 8 pack with the soft break.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H6OlaGA5eE  And here is Ronnie Alcano's soft break that won him a 2006 world championship.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRX_gEBeeas  One thing i would like to point out is that the 3 ball passed the head string rule really wasn't intended for amateurs, so the fact that you keep getting called on fouls for it seems kind of silly to me. The break isn't about being macho and smashing the balls, it's about making a ball and getting a shot to continue running. You are hitting as hard as you can without sacrificing accuracy, and that just happens to be about as hard as a soft break in your case.  At the pro level, I understand why they changed the rules to prevent it, though I disagree with the decision. It doesn't make for an exciting game to watch when every rack looks the same, and the break ends up being just another robotic shot in a long run.  The reason I disagree with this is because they essentially are making luck an even bigger part of the game. Players almost always break hard in 3balls passed the headstring events, and sometimes, through no fault of their own, the balls kiss back and don't cross the headstring, and now you have an illegal break. It makes the game seem a bit watered down to me. I don't understand how you can break hard, make a ball on a break, and still have to give up control of the table and say that isn't shit luck. At the end of the day, it's all about ratings though, so I understand their reasoning for banning the soft break.  Also, SVB played Donnie Mills in a pattern rack, soft break, long race format and Donnie had the edge until Shane gave up and started breaking hard. I think Shane proved the soft break doesn't guarantee a victory or ruin the game as some have claimed.. the better player should win in the long run.   Anyways, keep practicing. As your stroke becomes more consistent, you will be able to put more power behind the cue accurately. Don't try to overdo it. Another thing I haven't seen mentioned is to make sure your breaking a good rack. If the 1 ball isn't frozen and you have gaps your never going to see the full potential of your breakshot. If your opponent gives you bad racks, offer to rack your own.  Dirty balls, Old worn out balls, and worn cloth with also diminish the effectiveness of your break. Try playing with a clean or newer set balls if you can get your hands on one."
billiards,32rehk,Bagelstein,2,Sat Apr 18 01:34:55 2015 UTC,"In addition to making sure you follow through, make sure that power comes from your legs/ships and not just your arms.  You really want to twist your body into the shot.  If you are just swinging your arms as hard as you can you are going to end up losing a ton of accuracy and not getting any real power behind the shot."
billiards,32rehk,too_late_to_party,1 point,Thu Apr 16 04:59:33 2015 UTC,"I tried the twist-body-into-shot and always end up fouling by not hitting the one-ball (I play 9-ball mostly). There was a time I was breaking quite decently by standing and pushing forward with my shooting arm instead, a little bit like how Allison Fisher did here."
billiards,32rehk,Bagelstein,1 point,Thu Apr 16 08:36:28 2015 UTC,"If you watch this clip more carefully you see that she puts her whole body into the shot even though it doesn't look as dramatic as you might be imagining it should.  Her back foot comes up as she pushes off of it to shift all her body weight through her arm and into the cue.  When I say you should twist your body into the shot, I don't mean you need to exaggerate a turning motion, just put your full body into it as opposed to just your arm strength.  If you are having trouble with hitting squarely where you are aiming then it just means you need to keep practicing a straight stroke.    If you want an alternative that might help you more in the short run you could consider taking the cue further back towards the rail and using an overhand bridge while resting the cue on the rail itself.  This isn't the best way to get the most out of your break in the long run however because you are limited to where you can position the cue and the increased distance takes away from the strength of the shot, but it'll give you much more stability to shoot straighter while putting more power into the break."
billiards,32rehk,dickskittles,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:09:02 2015 UTC,"That video clip (Allison's first break) illustrates a lot of important points about how to break hard.  She doesn't jump.  She doesn't twist.  She doesn't kick her back leg up and try to touch the back of her own head with it.  She doesn't exaggerate her follow-through.  She's not large or muscular.  Kinda contradicts a lot of what's already been said in these comments, doesn't it?  Here's what is going on with Allison:   1) She has a very good stroke.  Having a very good stroke means using all the muscles that move the cue forward in harmony with each other, and keeping all the muscles that hold the cue back or steer the cue off line relaxed and out of the way.  It doesn't take strength to hit the ball hard.  It takes using all the right muscles together and keeping all the other muscles quiet.  2) She moves her body to make room for a harder stroke.  On a standard shot, Allison keeps her torso still.  On the break, she raises up with the final stroke.  Raising up gets you ""out of the way"" of the stroke.  It also makes your arm into a longer lever; note that raising up her torso but keeping a level cue means moving from the shoulder (""elbow drop"") as well as the elbow (""pendulum"").  The whole arm strokes, not just the forearm.  3) She gets her weight moving forward without any sudden lunge.  When the cue hits the ball, she's got her weight over her front foot.  She only moved forward a few inches, but it contributes a lot of force to the stroke.  4) She times everything perfectly.  Every accelerative force (elbow drop, bicep contraction, weight shift) is peaking just before contacting the CB.  This is where the advice some people give is really harmful.  Don't save anything for the follow-through or the leg kick.  None of your muscles should be getting ready to exaggerate your follow through when you're accelerating toward contact.  Everything needs to happen in time for the strike, not the pose."
billiards,32rehk,too_late_to_party,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:47:27 2015 UTC,"If I'm getting this right, it's more about getting the acceleration from the body momentum in time with the forward stroke and ""standing"" into the break that's important, correct?  I'm a casual player at best in university for about a year but am ashamed to say I can count the number of times I've had a successful break (with 3 balls past the headstrong) on two hands :'("
billiards,32rehk,dickskittles,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:30:48 2015 UTC,"It's more about having a good stroke.  If your break is really weak, item 1 in my post above is where you need to start.  Once you have a reasonably powerful break just from a coordinated and uninhibited stroke, then you might want to try adding in the body motion elements."
billiards,32rehk,SeabrookMiglla,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:16:22 2015 UTC,"first off, there are many different ways to break- having a variety of breaks in your arsenal when one isnt working in ANY game is key. experiment; watch how other people break including your opponent. tables all break differently, so sometimes your go-to break wont work as well on a given table. its not always about just hitting the rack as hard as possible, but rather a controlled break with a good and firm stroke. your always trying to look to control the cue ball on the break which means many players in 8 or 9 ball use more bottom english so the cue ball stops somewhere in the middle of the table. whoever is breaking really has an advantage as they control the tempo of the game. there are offensive and defensive breaks in various games. i would search youtube and look up how to break, there really are so many different ways you can break. is there a specific game you want to know how to break in? 8 ball, 9 ball etc...?  here is just one of many videos on youtube that address breaking: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7-onHOXHPk"

billiards,32o0k3,cause_you_suck,10,Wed Apr 15 09:18:02 2015 UTC,"It certainly isn't exposure but more of a content issue. Billiards, bowling & tennis are all on tv weekly. Its that 1:1 sports are very tough to broadcast... there's only so much an announcer can talk about 2 people at any moment... With the big team sports & golf, there's multitudes of story lines for the audience to follow.    Audiences need more than the game... they need a storyline."
billiards,32o0k3,IceUpSon,2,Wed Apr 15 11:38:23 2015 UTC,I think pool can learn something from tennis as far as how to create story lines. Similar tournament type structure where as team games are season based with a culminating championship at the end.
billiards,32o0k3,ceezaleez,5,Thu Apr 16 10:40:17 2015 UTC,"Dying is not the right word, plenty of people still play, a lot of them just don't watch it on TV. At some point it stopped getting on TV regularly and I've read somewhere that to some extent that was due to screwups negotiating contracts with e.g. ESPN.   There's a ton of pool streaming online and it costs little or nothing, and a lot of guys are doing it more or less for free. In general cable TV is getting replaced by streaming services so people are getting their pool fix online if they need one.  With the right people doing the right marketing, it can find a niche somewhere on TV, or doing internet PPV, despite the fact that it IS a little dull to watch. But a lot of the people who have tried seem to have some fatal flaw or make some incompetent mistakes that kill it before it can get off the ground.   For example one guy tried to start a new televised game, Bonus Ball, which had very high production values, teams, uniforms, a proper 'stadium', and they have a fairly interesting new game. But they screwed up getting permits on that stadium and delayed their opening, and allowed an unprofessional guy to do PR, where he ended up actively pissing off potential viewers.   Kevin Trudeau tried to inject massive money into a pro pool tour and chose to present viewers with the game we all know, 8-ball. But the money dried up due to a change in internet gambling legislation (or, depending on who you ask, he just swindled the players and ran off with it).   The US Open has a recognizable name and top players, but the guy running it keeps paying the players waaay late, to the point where he now has to put up the money beforehand in escrow.   tl;dr with a little competence, business savvy, and honesty we probably COULD get this game in front of mainstream viewers."
billiards,32o0k3,CreeDorofl,3,Wed Apr 15 14:37:57 2015 UTC,"First of all, I don't think billiards is dying.  There are plenty of people playing in leagues and tournaments.  The real issue is that it's not getting TV coverage like other sports.  My question to you is: do you want it to become like baseball or football?  Athletes becoming so famous that you can no longer pay $60 to play alongside them?  With all of that attention comes a lot of negative side effects.  I, for one, don't relish that.  I like it the way it is now.  That aside, the main problem with pool becoming ""mainstream"" is that there are too many different ways to play.  Take baseball, or football.  Of course, Pros have different rules than college, but for the most part they are the same.  Same fields, same rules (mostly), same scoring mechanisms.  And the pros have a single league (again, as a rule), such as the NBA, NFL, or MLB.  With pool, there are just too many variables.Table sizes vary. Game rules are VERY different (8-ball, 9-ball, 10-ball, 1-pocket, 14.1, etc!).  There is no single governing professional league.  If the game of billiards were to go mainstream, we need a few things to happen:   A single league, with a commissioner in charge. One official game, or series of games.  If there are multiple games (say for example 8-ball, 10-ball, and American Rotation), they need to have a standard set of rules. Players need to be paid their winnings.  Immediately.   I don't see anything happening soon, but there is some hope.  Take a look at Joe Tucker's American Rotation tour, and Oscar Dominguez's Mest West State tour.  They are both run very well, players get their winnings immediately, and have amazing potential for growth."

Specifically: talking about things that aren't related at all to the match, trading inside jokes or stories that leave viewers on the outside, criticizing the players even though the commentator making the remarks went two and out in the tournament and is clearly bitter and/or drunk and high.   A good commentator should appeal to viewers that aren't as well versed with the nuances of the game. They should have a detailed profile of EVERY major player in a tournament, complete with previous tournament wins and titles, some biographical information and relevant (and appropriate) stories that will inform people new to the game.

The camel tour was a big deal in the 90s and when it folded it kind of marked the beginning of the end.  Corey deuel mentioned in an interview that a big issue is also the disconnect between amateur and pro pool. Every little leaguer has a favorite baseball player. Everybody knows that you play highschool ball, then college then there are minor league franchises operated by their big league counter parts.  The APA doesn't support pro pool at all, nor do many of the other leagues. There is no set path to becoming a pro, no investment in the sport as a whole. It's also become very fragmented almost like boxing with all the belts and divisions.  If pool players were household names there is no doubt on my mind that pool would be on TV and players would compete for 100k purses."

billiards,32oqxm,scrotorboat,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:21:20 2015 UTC,"I read this tip somewhere, can't remember if it was on azbilliards or a post on here:  Concentrate on making your backstroke as straight as possible, and your forward stroke will naturally become straighter. It makes sense to me because I often focus too much on making my forward stroke straight, which results in an exaggerated and unnatural follow through (poking instead of stroking).  Also, make sure your backswing and forward stroke are the same length.   This bit of advice parallels something I learned as a collegiate sprinter with regards to arm motion: concentrating on swinging your arms backwards will give you a more powerful and natural forward swing. Beginners tend to concentrate on swinging their arms forward, which is counterintuitive to the laws of inertia. Less forward momentum is generated when you actively concentrate on forcing your arms forwards; you end up wasting energy because your arms are pushed forwards, rather than swinging naturally."

When it's away from the table, it will not only block your cue, but also your body. But when it's close, it will only block your cue and your arm if you need to be right next to it.  Of course, with that said, you can work around it somewhat if the pole is away from the table. If it's right up against it, there's really nothing you can do with a blocked shot."

Probably half the shots from that side of the table were either not possible, or you ended up literally hugging the pole. As for the table size in general, always go smaller. I (or rather my parents) made this mistake with my first house, and rail shots are hard enough without having to swap out with shorter cues for every one of them."

With pool, a top too large means you can't get any purchase on the cueball and a tip too small means you can't get the power. A 9mm is perfect as it allows power and control of the cueball together. In snooker, it's pretty much the same.  9mm is just right for me and I suggest it to anyone who wants to play UK 8-ball. Obviously, if you can, try a bigger and a smaller tip and see how you do with them. Then make the decision."

billiards,32n2l1,outside_english,3,Wed Apr 15 02:37:56 2015 UTC,"okay, i went through the website, and heres the part that is very concerning. So they offer these sticks in a variety of styles. Within those styles they offer the buyer the ability to choose which wood combinations for the cue design. Which is fine, but heres where it gets sticky; they deliver within 25 days. Which means either they have a warehouse stocked with every combination of styles of woods, which would be many, but I'm too lazy to math, so you figure it out. Or they slap your stick together from some sort of template, then put it on a lathe and turn it down in a single day. And that there is your problem if that is the case. Good, even decent playable cues are made over periods of time. Great cues take about a year from what I understand. /r/gabrielleigh could explain it better, and maybe he will drop in to give his advice. I could be wrong. If I were you I would just write them an email and ask them whats up, how are the cues made or any other pertinent questions like wood curing and all that. For the money they are asking they should be more than willing to be forthcoming about the quality of their product."
billiards,32n2l1,too_lazy_2_punctuate,3,Wed Apr 15 02:58:42 2015 UTC,Good observation about slapping the cue together in 25 days.
billiards,32n2l1,HappySoda,2,Wed Apr 15 03:14:07 2015 UTC,"I also doubt they have more than a handful in their ""warehouse"". The blanks, at least for cue places near Budapest, Hungary all come from one particular blank making place in far eastern Hungary/Romania. That's also where the local forestry industry is based. The individual shops would order from there and then slap on their own design, joint, logo,  and what not.   I don't know what their curing process is, but I do know that not all wood types are available all the time. Except for the type of wood used for Players cues (totally uneducated, layman's eyeball check), the availability depends on season and popularity. For example, I wanted the shop next to me to make me a custom snooker cue. The problem is the base wood (ash) and one of the spices were out of season. They quoted me a 6 month wait. So, I ended up buying one they had on hand. Anyway, even though the pool cue I got from them is not a custom like the snooker cue, it is holding up really well after a year.  Anyway, OP, I would probably avoid the more expensive options. McDermott and Cuetec are pushing hard in this area, with the lowest grade selling for around $100. There's no way a local cue can command more than that. Once you add shipping cost in, I can see a little over $100. But I'm seeing some options in the $200's. That seems crazy to me. Anyway, I might be able to go ask my local cue maker about these and see what they say. If I find anything interesting, I'll report back."

I am currently in Hungary, which neighbors Ukraine. I have seen cues looking like these before. I even have one from a local cue maker who makes these decorated ones. Overall, the quality is good for its price here. The butt is pretty nice. It has a substantial feel to it. You probably won't be able to change the weight, however. The shaft isn't a high quality one, but at least as good as Players shafts; possibly even close to the HXT ones on a good day.   With that said, it costs like $40-60 here. I don't think it's worth $240.  If you do get it, avoid the ones with the points. They don't look very sharp, and the points can be uneven."

All these guys get blanks from the same place. Then they cover it with a decorated film (there's a name for it, but I forget), like Players and Action cues, and call it a day. I mean it makes sense around here, since people make like $500 a month. When I went to get mine, they kept on trying to push American cues on me, thinking I can afford them. While correct, I wanted a unique looking Hungarian one. So, I ordered a blank and got to see how they make the decorated ones while waiting for them to get the blank ready."

billiards,32ing8,dickskittles,3,Tue Apr 14 05:33:49 2015 UTC,"That drill is a great drill to improve your ability to run balls in one pocket.  I'd alternate in this one: play your standard one pocket break, give yourself one shot as your opponent to practice responding to the break, and then take ball in hand and see how many balls you can run in your hole.  It gives you what your drill doesn't, which is practicing the decision-making process of how to best run balls given a realistic game layout.  Of course most of one pocket isn't shooting at your hole, so you also gotta practice moving, and the only way that I feel really helps much with that is to play the game.  Preferably against more experienced players."

billiards,32ing8,HeadHunter76,2,Tue Apr 14 21:31:41 2015 UTC,"Ok, I see a few problems with this drill. Its only a shot making drill. That should be something you already have in the bag. One pocket is a lot more about cue control in my experience (15+ years). Very rarely will you have an ideal setup similar to this in a game between two good 1hole players.   A drill that was taught to me many years ago was a game similar to playing the ghost. Rack the balls, and break them head on with a soft/medium break. Take ball in hand run as many in one pocket as you can until you miss. When you miss, rack up and start over. .This drill will help you a lot with cue control, as you will have to maneuver the cue around the pack and learn to break up clusters. It will put you in more true to game scenarios than the drill you are currently running.   I have played One Pocket for quite a long time, and even beaten a few pros along the way. I would love to help you learn the game any way I can. I play fairly regularly all across the Southeast US if you happen to be in the area and would like to get together for a few racks.

billiards,32ing8,SeabrookMiglla,1 point,Tue Apr 14 14:29:20 2015 UTC,"That's a good drill for general cue ball control, however I'm not so sure how effective it is for one pocket (even though you're shooting the balls into one pocket).  If you want to specifically practice common one pocket shots I would probably focus on the banks that come up often.  That being said, one pocket is mainly a game of strategy and the best way to practice that is to play against someone better than you.  I also recommend watching videos. This is a good start. That channel has other one pocket videos as well. Watching matches like that can give you a good idea of various shots to practice as well as examples of the strategy involved (which is like 90% of the game)."
billiards,32ing8,Liquidicity,1 point,Wed Apr 15 01:06:24 2015 UTC,"Nice job. Just to clear one side of the square is hard, you can do the other side just with a bit more practice. I thought you had the speed down well which tells me you know the different strokes in the game. When doing drills like these in practice, and you slightly goof up on a ball- just keep going to get a rythym going. Your pace of play was good I might add, the minute you begin rushing is when you begin making mistakes.  Just my opinion- I noticed something you did that stuck out to me because I use to do a drill similar to this, and occasionally still do and I would do the same exact thing. It seems like the 3rd ball for some reason I always get out of line or miss it playing shape. After the 3rd ball things run smoothley. And honestly I think you completed the hardest part, you just didn't finish. Edit:looking at the video again,- I couldn't see the angle of the last shot, but you definitely Jabbed at that last ball, all the other Shots you stroked well.  I think your mechanics look good and solid. Just keep practicing and putting in the hours and results will show!"
billiards,32ing8,Humpin_Toad,0,Wed Apr 15 16:52:07 2015 UTC,"playing the drill is basically playing a lot of stopshots if the drill is played correctly, so it's not so much of an one-pocket drill than it is a stopshot drill.  That aside, your arm is not ""in-line"" at all times, this could be due to stance or maybe the camera-angle is playing tricks on me. Also you're holding your stick not at the right place for your hight, your ""back-hand"" should move a bit back so your arm is at 90° when your tip contacts the cueball.

billiards,32hdyh,brosephashe,3,Mon Apr 13 20:35:21 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who doesn't see the allure to this guy? Don't get me wrong I know people love him and the tricks he does and I've got nothing against anyone but to me I just don't find him or trickshot pool entertaining. I'd much rather watch Efren and Earl shoot 9 ball in a race to 120 then this to me that is skill I guess I see this as parlor tricks almost mocking a sport that I am so passionate about.
billiards,32hdyh,thrownintoawall,2,Mon Apr 13 21:38:59 2015 UTC,I like both equally. The thing is its just a different kind of demonstration. One has to separate artistic shots from game shots mentally and we all understand one is not the same as the other. The best (poor) analogy I can come up with is that of two different types of painters. One who paints murals or portraits and one who paints houses. They use similar tools and even similar skill sets but each for very different end goals in mind and one can appreciate both if one understands well enough. However for the layman the portraits are going to be more impressive.   That's the difference between game pool and artistic pool. One is a demonstration of problem solving that can only be truly appreciated if one understand the problems the player is facing. Artistic billiards is entertainment for the masses because they might not understand the difficulty in a 150 ball run of 15.1 but they can most certainly understand the difficulty of a 15 foot jump shot into a cowboy boot.

billiards,32hdyh,FootofGod,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:52:05 2015 UTC,"I'm with you man.  I've been playing pool for about 15 years now and I've never really been interested in trick shots. To me it seems like it's something targeted more at amateurs.  And, like you, I find someone running out a rack far more interesting.  Of course, I should admit, that I enjoy watching things like 30+ minute one pocket strategy battles. Most ""normal"" people would pay money to not have to watch that, lol. So maybe my opinion is not relevant.  I don't have anything against this guy, or trick shots, but I'm simply not interested in them."

billiards,32f969,knomis,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:12:26 2015 UTC,The Phillippi has a 3/4 length elephant ear wrap. I'm guess it's shorter because he wanted to show the return points on the butt. He also started the wrap just south of the return points on the forearm so it gives it a nice symmetry. All the points are razor sharp so it would really be a shame to cover them up.

I changed my game plan a bit and played a lil more conservative. Played a few safeties on the 3rd rack and won. (1-2). Broke dry on the next rack, he missed his second shot I ran out. (2-2) I broke ran about 4 balls played a good safe and won that rack (3-2) on hill.....  I broke came out dry he almost ran the full rack and hung the 8 in the pocket, I had to clear out 6 balls, missed an easy shot on the 2nd to last ball....  Next rack (Hill-Hill) was a safety battle...in short he gave me the game, I missed an easy ball for the win....I still can't believe I missed it to be honest..and I'm pretty upset...it's ...i dunno..it sucks but its my fault and my lack of concentration or something..who knows I suck. lol"

There's no one else in the world arguably who would have been able to clear up from that position, and there are better shot makers than Ronnie in the game (Judd Trump and Neil Robertson for instance).  I think what this shows more than anything is brilliant shot selection. Almost every ball was awkward. Yet his shot selection in many cases was such that he left himself an ""option b"" if he didn't land perfectly on the ideal red. When an option b wasn't possible, he would play the less risky shot to avoid being out of position (avoiding the cannon from blue to black). No one else sees the game the same way he does which is why the term genius gets thrown around a lot.  Yes, he had to pull out some really impressive shot making skills for a few shots, too, but dude...just LOOK at the table in the beginning. It's a complete mess! That he was able to make a frame winning break, let alone clear up from that position is unbelievable.  Edit: a few more points."

billiards,3276ts,dalgeek,2,Sat Apr 11 06:40:03 2015 UTC,I like this answer. One of my favorite ways to play is barbox 8ball because it's all about cue ball control.
billiards,3276ts,DetroitLarry,6,Sat Apr 11 07:17:51 2015 UTC,"Playing on a 9 footer is more difficult in my opinion. It generally presents more challenges and it all boils down to shot-making. Making shots on a 9 footer is out and out hard. Getting position while making shots becomes exponentially more difficult. Solving problems while making shots while getting position, etc...Because of this good 9ft players are more skilled than good 7ft players. 7 foot tables have their own unique challenges, of course. But playing well on a 9ft table is much more difficult than playing well on a 7ft table.  Personally, I'm an exclusive 7ft player in league and in recreation while only playing on 9fters about once a month, maybe less. I always carry a healthy amount of respect for good 9ft players after I find myself playing on a 9 footer."
billiards,3276ts,sfc949,3,Sat Apr 11 08:44:40 2015 UTC,You have a bad case of confirmation bias. I recommend a healthy dose of 9ft play to cure your fear of the longer shots.
billiards,3276ts,unoriginalsin,5,Sat Apr 11 14:38:42 2015 UTC,"I own a 9ft Diamond table, but end up playing competitively more often on bar boxes. Big table players often believe its harder to play on a big table, and it can be, but deep down, its really just different.   Playing big table will help your stroke, and help you be more accurate. It will not teach you the same level of speed/ball control a bar box will. The windows are bigger and easier to hit on a big table.  After playing at home all day, playing on a 7ft table feels claustrophobic. Constant planning to break balls up and fitting into small windows is suddenly as important as being able to make a shot.

billiards,3276ts,ac120205,2,Sun Apr 12 00:42:21 2015 UTC,"Bar box tables are easier because you don't have shorter shots,  but can be more difficult because of the more crowded nature of the balls.   9 foot would be the opposite."
billiards,3276ts,daytonm,1 point,Sat Apr 11 04:55:25 2015 UTC,"Normally about the hardest game a 7ft player plays is 8 ball. With 9ft you get into much more challenging games like One Pocket, Banks, and Straight Pool. The tougher games tend to help further better all around skill. I mean at the pro level a 7ft match can be decided by who won the coin flip because they just take turns in an alt break format. You rarely see this in big table play aside from a short race format."

billiards,3276ts,TrollaBot,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:58:37 2015 UTC,"In my experience, another big difference is the speed of the felt.    7 foot tables typically have very thick felt so that it can better stand up to the abuse a table typically gets at a bar.  9 foot tables at a pool hall typically use much lighter felt which results in the table being much faster.  I'm sure this is not always the case, just my experience."
billiards,3276ts,burnt_wick,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:00:38 2015 UTC,9ft > 7ft.  Especially when the 9ft's pockets are tighter.
billiards,3276ts,outside_english,1 point,Sun Apr 12 18:29:18 2015 UTC,"Bar box players have better follow and draw control within the size of the table, while 9 foot players have better understanding of routes and 9 ball type pattern play/recognition."
billiards,3276ts,RyanGoslingsCock,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:05:21 2015 UTC,"What does the size of the table have to do with the the way the cue ball travels? Seems like baloney.   The tables are different, but its hard to say one is better than the other."
billiards,3276ts,Pilfered,1 point,Sat Apr 11 07:29:00 2015 UTC,"It's as simple as the 9 foot table has more distance to travel. And there's less congestion since there's generally more space between the balls. Which is why I think (note my wording ""I think"") 7 foot table players tend to play more 6 inch draw, 1 foot draw, 2 foot draw, short control type shots since they are sometimes trying to work into and out of tight spots and not bump other balls since there's more chance they will with routes. There's a chance a 7 foot table player would develop a better ability to bump balls since they would tend to need to break up more clusters, or not have any other option but to bump something.  Conversely, I think all the open space of a 9 foot table allows a player more room to play more 2 rail and 3 rail routes without as much worry on traffic. Probably 4 and 5 rail routes as well.  I'm not saying one is better than the other, but I do believe both tables will cause a player to play differently. Even the stroke of the player will develop differently. Some amazing 7 foot players have short jabby strokes that give them excellent control for their given space, and some amazing big table players have long rhythmic flowing strokes that help them move the cue ball around the length of the table."
billiards,3276ts,RyanGoslingsCock,1 point,Sun Apr 12 05:34:28 2015 UTC,"I play on both a lot, I'm not sure what your experience is with 7ft, but I would say balls tend to cluster more on a 9ft than a 7ft, which after the break I'll have almost zero clusters and balls spanning the entire table. Going four or five rails for position? I mean, I can see a situation but...who and why?  Maybe you're basing it off of the level of players you tend to see at those different sizes. I think the avg bar player is much worse than the avg full size player, merely because a more serious/experienced player is going to seek playing on those tables."
billiards,3276ts,Pilfered,1 point,Sun Apr 12 21:05:12 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that better players seek out big tables. I'm super lucky, the campus at MSU has 14 9 foot Brunswick's. I got into straight pool, and my friend wants to start playing one pocket. Playing on those tables helped my 7 foot table a ton. That feeling that there's no long shots on a 7 foot table is nice. I'll leave a shot across the table if getting close is difficult.  The 4 and 5 rail comment was in a different sentence since it's so much less likely someone would play it often. It was based on a rarity situation, but I believe 9 foot table players would see them more so than a bar box guy."

billiards,3276ts,RyanGoslingsCock,-1,Mon Apr 13 01:06:27 2015 UTC,"Ok. I've read all the comments. I think most of you are wrong. 7 foot tables are designed so the games go faster and can rotate more money per hour. The pockets are larger than 9 footers. If you want your game to be the best it can be, play on 9 footers. The routes are the same the strokes are the same the games are the same. Lower skill players have more success on 7 footers than 9 footers because thier stroke doesn't have to be as perfect to make balls. That's it."

Even if you add in non-player fans of pool it's still a far cry from the amount of 'viewership' that they need. Unfortunately the so-called ""reality"" shows think that they need to add drama... Personally I think it takes the focus of the show off pool and creates another fictional drama, just like the shows that are fully scripted. It does suck but you gotta feed the pig! It's all about money, not about pool or the players or even the viewers. It just plain sucks. Buuut- if you want straight pool you can find it on the sport channels.

We all know about reality TV, that it's drama driven and not reality driven.  The show obviously is going to center around gambling, and I think that this isn't necessarily bad. It's a big part of the games history. Even if you don't like to gamble yourself, some of pools greatest matches were for big money. example  Whether or not the show will be good for pool remains to be seen.

I do this, and have seen others do this.  The idea is filling the pours in on the tip, not creating a huge layer of chalk, Having too much just leaves the chalk all over the table.  Along with this, it also will show if your tip is in need of scruffing by showing glare on spots that have been pressed down.  Using shitty chalk can also leave bigger pieces on the tip, you do not want this, as they will dig into your tip, along with possibly getting left on the table and becoming a small pebble on the table which can potentially change the course of the ball.  Oh and the reason for the hand chalk clapping is once again the same, you just need it to smooth your hands, not coat them, otherwise the chalk ends up all over the table your pants, your face, and maybe your keyboard....."

There are very few people who willy nilly go back and forth from 9ft to 7ft tables. Most players just stick to one size. If you play an APA league, you probably stay on 7ft tables. If you play a BCA affiliated league you probably shoot on 9ft tables. And yes, you can be sure both groups just about openly sneer at the other.  9ft table players will say the bigger table means you have to be a better potter.  7ft table players will say the smaller table means you have to be better at cue ball control.  are their merits to either party? sure. But it seems in todays pool world you just about have to choose which school of thought to follow."
billiards,31zq1b,too_lazy_2_punctuate,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:12:33 2015 UTC,"Aramith makes a product specifically for cleaning the balls. If you don't want to use that I know some people use Brillianize, Plexus or similar plastic cleaners.  To clean the felt i recommend getting a horse hair brush for daily cleaning and a brushless handheld vacuum for weekly cleaning.  There is also Quick Clean table cleaner which is the same as the old Chalk Off stuff if everybody remembers. It works ok, but I'd still brush and vacuum the table as well."
billiards,31zq1b,ceezaleez,1 point,Fri Apr 10 08:57:11 2015 UTC,"question 1- im not very knowledgeable on table maintenance with and what is the best method for maintaining felt so maybe someone may have better advice. the brush is always good. many pool halls use smaller shop vacuums, they works well, but im not sure how they affect the actual longevity of a high grade simonis felt. there are aerosol spray cans to keep your felt slick and shiny; this is used after brushing from my understanding. kinda like waxing your car, the final touch. but again, im not the best person to talk to when it comes to that sort of thing.  question 2- its kind of like this. and this is just my opinion. i personally feel that if i had the choice to practice on a 7fter or a 9fter, id pick the 9 fter. bigger table means its harder to make shots; also a big table requires a bigger stroke. these attributes are important to learn, and are qualities that are more difficult to develop on a 7fter.   although before i am going to play a match on a 7 fter, ill practice on those small 7 fters to get the feel. the strategy and ball placement is different. you dont need to let out your stroke as much, and the break is completely different. on a 7 fter you can settle for a longer shot more often and dont necessarily have to get fancy with the cue ball.  in short- you need to play on both. both will teach you certain things about the game. bar tables will teach you very fine position plays, the subtleties in cue ball placement when working in tight areas. it will also give you more touch in your stroke. id say a 70% big table to 30% bar table is roughly a good split to give you best of both worlds. but always make sure you practice on the table you are going to play on or at least something similar."
billiards,31zq1b,SeabrookMiglla,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:35:13 2015 UTC,When I first started playing I only played 9 footers and looked at 7foot table players as inadequate. I was 18 and new to the game.  Now I have respect for both.   9 foot tables requires more of a stroke to make it all around the table and judge ur speed.  You can't really poke stroke all your shots like on a 7footer.   7 foot tables require less of a stroke but a lot more touch.  Speed is a major factor in small tables obviously because it's less area to work with.
billiards,31zq1b,JonLivestrong,1 point,Sat Apr 11 03:13:14 2015 UTC,"Most players that become very good or want to move to mainly 9 foot tables at some point in their career. While there are merits to bar tables, 95% of the higher level competition is on 9 footers and for short rack rotation, its more of a 2 player game rather than a competition to see who can put their opponent to sleep with a gigantic package first."
billiards,31zq1b,gotwired,1 point,Sat Apr 11 03:23:32 2015 UTC,"I'll skip the first question. I play on any table. I learned to play on bar boxes and later on 9 footers. I really cut my teeth on 9 footers, and still prefer them to this day. BUT - there is a wide variety of table sizes. Everything from 6 X 3 to 6 X 12 (Ocean table) - and I suggest you play on them all. They all have their merits and their foibles. The more experience you get with different sizes the more well rounded player you will be.  Lastly, never hesitate to ask someone to play on whatever size table. I wouldn't wait for them to ask me.

billiards,31unj6,ceezaleez,6,Wed Apr 8 07:53:21 2015 UTC,"Obviously, each person should use whatever type of shaft they are most comfortable with. That said, low deflection shafts reduce the variables that you are dealing with on each shot. None of the ""natural"" low deflection techniques you mentioned will lower the deflection to the point of a predator shaft, or even very close.  It is not just pros who use low deflection shafts (and believe me, the usually small sponsorships alone wouldn't be enough to entice them to play with inferior equipment), but many of the top level amateurs throughout the country. It's not simply a fad. Players who have used regular shafts for over a decade have made the switch because they can tell the difference. Deflection is not some nebulous idea, it is a measurable attribute.   There's no period on the end of the sentence when it comes to personal preference. Low deflection and regular shafts are both perfectly fine, it's up to the player to decide. It's unfortunate that many manufacturers use shortcuts to create their products, I know many players would be willing to pay top dollar for a truly high quality low deflection shaft. I can say that I am very happy with my low deflection shaft after having used a regular one for a while. I don't think I'll ever switch back."
billiards,31unj6,JaktheAce,6,Wed Apr 8 14:39:00 2015 UTC,"I get what you are saying and I think it misses the key point in this.  I also think that Jak and Gabriel further things to the conversation.  1) The notion that more quality is put into the materials on high end custom cues:  There is no doubt that many cue makers put an obscene amount of effort into quality control on their materials and process.  The high-volume manufacturers certainly don't have the same control on the materials.  However, I do think that the process itself is of high quality.  i.e. you can get a shaft from Predator that has a section with poor grain but the cue itself is built to the same exact standard as the next.   2) Low-Deflection is a fad and has a placebo effect on a persons game:  This is the big divergence from my vantage point.  This is patently false.  Low-Deflection is real and makes a considerable difference.  Let's imagine a scenario to illustrate the point.    Say I have a straight in shot and I aim center ball at the shot.  Say my margin for error when I strike the cue is 1/4 of a tip.  So in aiming for center ball I might actually hit up to 1/4 of a tip in any direction off center.  With a low deflection shaft it increases making your shot based on the margin of error because as you deviate from your desired target the deflection is less.   Yes if you know where you are going to hit you can adjust and it doesn't matter, it's when you don't know where you're going to hit that it makes all the difference in the world.  It translates that because I use a less deflection shaft I am going to make more shots in the long run and it really is fact.  Up the point where I shoot absolutely perfect and at that point it would no longer matter but be a personal preference thing.   3) Repeatability:  I believe that I can replicate my current playing cue easier with a Z2 than a high end custom shaft.  As the pie section design doesn't rely as much on the batch of wood and they can use the exact same process.  It means that if my shaft breaks I can have an easier time getting a shaft that is going to play the exact same.  (That's not to say there isn't variation but the variation is less and I can find other z2 shafts that play identical with little effort and less cost than tracking down an identical custom shaft)  4) You can do more with a higher deflection shaft:  I have no scientific data here to back me up, but I can say I don't believe this to be true.  I have a pretty strong stroke and can do pretty much anything.  I would challenge someone to create a shot that they can do with a regular shaft that I can't do with my low deflection shaft.  I will post a video if they do the same.    TL;DR  Low deflection is real and it does matter."

I don't have any scientific data either, but I have discussed the issue with a well respected certified bca instructor and he agreed that deflection has it's place in the game, that a super stiff low deflection shaft is not ideal for certain shots.

billiards,31unj6,Pip_Pip,0,Wed Apr 8 20:23:38 2015 UTC,"The way you make it sound, it's a wonder anybody can run 100 balls in straight pool with an old fashioned shaft.  Fair point on the bar situation. I use bar cues when i'm in a bar, because bar pool isn't serious pool. I make due with the equipment they have, and have fun.  If you are in a bar league and everybody has a personal cue, I understand it puts you at a disadvantage to use house equipment, and you wouldn't want to bring a $1k+ cue into an enviroment where it might get stolen or damaged.   Anyways, like I keep saying. LD is not for everybody.   I guess the point i was trying to make is just because you have found LD to work for you, make you play better or give you more confidence doesn't mean it renders natural shafts obsolete. There is very little research to support any companies claims of ""radial consistency"" and all these proprietary buzz words, so like you said it's all anecdotal.  I also wanted to make the point that the shafts are overpriced in the first place. Whatever money spent engineering the ""low deflection technology"" was saved in cheaper materials and less need for quality control, along with all the other benefits of being able to manufacture in china (Low value of chinese money, subsidized shipping, no workplace safety, enviromental regulation etc.).   This doesn't apply to all of the LD companies, I think Tiger is made in america, not sure about OB or the other ones, but it especially applies to predator."
billiards,31unj6,ac120205,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:30:43 2015 UTC,"Predator started in the US.  I only speak of predator because that's what I use.   I can understand the complaints about durability,  cost to value and wanting to support US made or US made has an inherent ""betterness"".    I noticed you mentioned buzz words as I didn't use any I guess you are referencing other posts.   I purposely don't use them because that stuff can be quackery.     Statistically, you will make more shots using low deflection. Z2 had the lowest deflection as far as I know.  Thus I use a z2.    People can of course do what they want, Tiger Woods can beat me with 20 year old golf clubs. He can maybe even beat other pro's using them.   Perhaps his confidence is higher even.   It doesn't negate the fact that most are going to use the newer better technology because it actually is better in terms of performance.   You can do what you want and be successful but LD is objectively better."
billiards,31unj6,Pip_Pip,0,Wed Apr 8 22:14:42 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't say ""objectively better""...the only thing you can say objectively about ld shafts is that they deflect less. they stay truer to the aiming line and you don't have to compensate for as much deflection as a standard shaft and thats about all you can say objectively about them. To say that they produce superior results compared with standard shafts would be wrong, because it depends totally on the player. Ld shafts can also have a hard time making jump shots, so they are limited in that sense. not trying to bash ld shafts, because i have a few and use them myself and like them."
billiards,31unj6,ac120205,1 point,Thu Apr 9 02:30:36 2015 UTC,they stay truer to the aiming line   This is objectively better

If someone is brand new to the game, they will probably make more shots with a ld shaft, that is true. If that is the point you are trying to make i would agree 100%."
billiards,31unj6,Pip_Pip,0,Thu Apr 9 03:44:04 2015 UTC,"Having said that, players will have to learn to compensate for deflection on all current shafts. The amount of compensation is all that is different. This can make some shots harder for ld shafts vs standard shafts. Like jumps, masses, and swerve shots talked about above. Again not knocking ld shafts because i use and enjoy them, but i don't  agree with saying that they are ""objectively better."""

Obviously the better you are the more you hit your aiming point, but at some point you are going to make a mistake.  With the low deflection the cost of the mistake lessens.    In a beginner they are less accurate and it can work out to help them even more.  Though I do sympathize with the earlier point made by OP that the extra help could slow down aiming development.  (Like using a super big ball to practice basketball)  It doesn't change the fact that a LD shaft does perform better.    Masse you can still do just as well with an LD (Jumping perhaps not, I'm not a full cue jumper with LD or normal), if you are really concerned about this using an extra cue that isn't LD is always an option for those specific shots.  (Unless you play in some weird rules that don't allow it.)   I'm not saying you can't play amazingly with a non-LD shaft.  Like my Tiger Woods analogy.  It's entirely possible to shoot better than everyone with a non-LD shaft.  It still doesn't change the fact that you can make more shots using a LD shaft unless you shoot perfectly, in which case it will be a tie.      What if you're used to the feel of a non-LD shaft?  I could play with that better than I could play with a LD shaft.    You may be used to it, you may just like it better.  That's perfectly fine.  It still doesn't change the fact that with a LD shaft you can miss less shots.  People play with worse/less advanced/less performing equipment all the time in professional sports golf, baseball, tennis, etc.  (and again it's fine) It doesn't change the objective fact that a carbon fiber tennis racket will outperform a wood one."

I will make 30 out of 30 instead of 29 out of 30. It's the difference between running 8 racks in a row compared to running 4 racks in a row. 1 shot.   You might still miss the shot with your LD shaft because of throw. A rotating cue ball that strikes an object ball will throw it off it's path. Aim for a center ball hit and end up putting 1/4 tip center left and the effect is even greater since a cue ball that is sliding will impart more of it's spin to the object. Any good bank pool player knows this. You will likely hit the right face of the pocket and if the balls are dirty, if the A/C is off or any number of other factors and you just hung your 30th ball up in the jaws. It doesn't matter that your cue ball went straight as an arrow and hit the object ball dead center and stopped in place. The object ball is sitting in the jaws of the pocket and your run is over.  Now say i miss my intended spot by the same margin on a straight in stop shot with my ivory ferruled 13mm shaft. Since my tip is bigger and I use a nickel curve, I will still be hitting closer to the center than a thin tapered LD shaft. The cue ball deflects slightly to the right, with a hair of left english and makes contact with the ball about a millimeter to the right sending it to left facing of the pocket. The english imparted on the cue ball throws the object slightly to the right correcting the miss caused by the deflection. Cue ball moves about a centimeter to the right and rotates in place for a brief second.   Often times in straight pool and one pocket you have to throw a ball in because you can't get a thin enough hit on it. You would think LD makes this easier, however with a low speed shot with heavy english is going to magnify the swerve and you will likely miss unless you compensate for that swerve. I find it easier to let the squirt and swerve cancel each other out.  You can try to over simplify everything by saying ""hey i eliminated a variable so it's better!"", but at the end of the day, deflection (or squirt as it's also known) swerve and throw all act together in harmony. That's why regular pool cues have gotten the job done for the past 200 some odd years, and most every pro that is in the game was able to achieve world class play with a regular maple shaft before making the switch.  I just want to reiterate that I'm not bashing you or anybody else for using LD. Like I said it's a very cool concept that definitely works for alot of people. Many of my friends shoot with low deflection.  I'm just saying that they aren't the new standard and I hate to see new players get told that in order to improve their game or get over a hump or jump up in skill they need to invest in an LD shaft. Or even worse be told ""get an LD now before it's too late"", before a player even has a chance to develop their feel for a cue or their own ability as a player.   It takes a long time and a lot of different cues to find what works for you. Pigeon holing yourself into LD early into your education of the game is detrimental to long term skill development in my opinion.  There may have been other points that I was trying to make, but I think this was my main point."

billiards,31unj6,ac120205,2,Wed Apr 8 17:35:40 2015 UTC,I have LD shafts for my main playing cues but haven't touched them in years. I much prefer a tight grained hard rock maple shaft. I just like the feel especially playing games like banks. The feel is just better in my opinion. I don't like the cheaper Chinese construction of a lot of the new LD stuff. Seems like they try and take too much weight out and you get a thin ferrule you have to be careful with and laminated wood that splits.
billiards,31unj6,gabrielleigh,2,Wed Apr 8 14:26:49 2015 UTC,"An LD shaft will make life easier for a rank beginner, but it will handicap them if they ever want to take a leap in their pool game. By not learning the importance of striking center on the cue ball, they're going to have a very rude awakening years down the line when they decide they want to be better than an APA 4/5. Deflection gives a player the benefit of knowing that the cue ball didn't end up where it was supposed to, so they should re-check their aim.   With an LD shaft the same shot can be missed due to throw from unintended english applied, but it will be far more difficult to detect, and they could go years, or their entire lives, without figuring it out. I think for the pros, it's about the sponsorships and nothing else, since they probably all learned to play with HD cues, and their cue ball control is so tight that the benefits aren't viable."
billiards,31unj6,RoadHustler,3,Thu Apr 9 05:37:14 2015 UTC,"Good points. I use both standard and ld shafts, and of all my cues, my favorite is my old joss with ivory ferrule...definitely not low deflection. I also am a fan of the ""flat stroke masse""(didn't know it was called this, but the name is fitting) and use it more on thin cuts than to go around balls. Deflection is useful on other shots as well, like when you can only see a part of the cue ball. In the long run, i don't think it matters much as long as you can remain consistent with the equipment that you are using."
billiards,31unj6,JonLivestrong,3,Wed Apr 8 08:10:59 2015 UTC,"Great advice, and my thoughts exactly. As a cue maker, this whole LD marketing fad has me just dumfounded at the engineering and materials quality that is being put into some of these shafts.   I do maintenance and repair on most of the LD brands in my shop each week, and I am seeing shafts come in with wood that isn't fit for chopsticks. Ferrules so thin you can see light through them, and made from materials like PVC and ABS plastic. I'll be doing emergency surgery on a ferrule, and discover the tenons are only about .070"" (seventy thousandths of an inch) thick, and the hollow ""LD"" weight-reduction hole is drilled off centerline making the tenon paper thin on one side, and three times as thick on the other side. I sometimes think these things are designed by whippersnappers who don't spend a lot of time in the shop building and repairing the things they design."
billiards,31unj6,Kaos_Rob,0,Wed Apr 8 13:02:25 2015 UTC,I too have seen a few of these dog ate my homework ferrules. I think many of the LD shaft makers assume they are never gonna see the shaft again so why should they care. Most users will assume it was their fault if the ferrule or tennon fails after a while and just buy a new one.   IMO the exception to that trend is OB they have a amazing warranty and in my experience honor it in good faith every time. But they are the exception.   I sent them a friends shaft he had bought from an online retailer almost a year before. It had a manufacturing defect that he hadn't noticed for a while they replaced it immediately.
billiards,31unj6,corellianspiceaddict,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:41:30 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way about low deflection. I've used my Steve Klein since I've started the game back in 05'. I picked up a OB shaft about 2 years ago and had the joint custom made for my Klein cue. I mean..yes the deflection is gone..but its replaced with a 'push' type feeling when you use english. When I use the original shaft on my cue, when I put english on the cue... the cue ball feels like a marshmallow. I can feel the english in my stroke. But when I use the OB shaft, it sort of just feels like hitting the cue with a 2x4. I mean I can still pick up english and get a ton of action on the cue ball with the OB shaft...but its just not the same feeling."
billiards,31unj6,Claclink,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:43:54 2015 UTC,"An LD shaft will still deflect. If I don't adjust my aim I will still miss (maybe not by as much as with a standard shaft) but still. On longer shots with a standard shaft after the initial deflection the spin on the cue ball will bring the cue ball back towards the aiming line. Without the deflection the cue ball drifts outside the aiming line and that still needs to be compensated for.   I shoot my best pool playing position with follow/draw and staying within a cue tip of center when using English and deflection is minimal. People think a LD shaft will allow them to juice up on the cue ball like Earl Strickland and play 4 rail position.   With all that said, I shoot with a 20 year old predator 3.14 on a Joss sneak pete."
billiards,31unj6,ColeeOlee,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:28:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what you say. I personally use a LD shaft. The reason being that it has more radial consistency than a standard shaft. High end cues with maple shafts don't have that kind of consistent hit throughout the radial turn. It is for that reason I use them. Plus when you discuss value vs performance, low deflection shafts out perform cues of equal/cost. They may lose this advantage when compared to higher end cues. 1000$ and up. It is this that makes them worth the money when compared to standard cues with maple or laminated shafts."

Deflection is actually quite useful in many situations and many players depend on it.
billiards,31unj6,Claclink,2,Thu Apr 9 03:59:21 2015 UTC,You don't need deflection to do masse.  What shots do you need deflection for?  Deflection causes the cue ball to travel in a straight line from the impact point.
billiards,31unj6,ac120205,0,Thu Apr 9 04:15:59 2015 UTC,"OPs ""flat stroke masse"" is one. Although a true flat stroke should produce negligible swerve, in practice a good amount of swerve can be seen. Deflection can also come in handy when it is difficult to directly aim at an object ball (like when there is another ball frozen to the cue ball). It can be easier to get a full tip of left/right english on the cue ball allowing it to deflect on to the object ball than trying to find a thin peice of cue ball to hit while aiming directly at the object ball. That shot comes up quite a bit, and not many people know it can be made easier by counting on cue ball delfection."

I picture it on the set of some sci-fi flick, or the holodeck from Star Trek, and my inner nerd wants one immediately. Out of curiosity, I did a little digging. THIS is one of the first things I found. Basically, you have to use the balls they provide, otherwise you'll ruin the table you just spent over $70,000 on! My assumption is that the balls have a slight rubberized coating of some sort, which means you probably couldn't do almost anything other than straight-in shots. No masse, no jumps, basically no english at all. Hell, you probably can't even do bank shots. But hey, I guess if you've got the kind of cash to spend on something like this, more power to ya."

billiards,31ob6v,HEYIMMAWOLF,3,Mon Apr 6 21:34:01 2015 UTC,"Typically, jump cues will have an extra joint halfway down the butt for increased leverage. Break cues only vary slightly from their standard brethren and can be difficult to tell apart. They usually have a flatter, more firm tip and a sturdier shaft build. You could use a break cue for playing, but will probably notice a significant drop in the amount of spin you can apply to the cue ball. Honestly, just keep playing and enjoying the game and focus on the mechanics of your shot, anyone that judges you based on your cue is someone you'd rather not play with anyway."

billiards,31i798,SousaphonePwn,3,Sun Apr 5 08:53:23 2015 UTC,"There isn't a whole lot of difference in cues between $80 and about $200, then you'll jump up to $400-500 to get a cue with a low deflection shaft.  Over $500 it's mostly looks that drives up the price.  Or, you can buy an $80 cue then put a low deflection shaft on it for $185-$235 and it won't feel much different than a $500 cue with a low deflection shaft on it (this is what I did).  I like the Predator cues/shafts, but OB and McDermott have very nice cues as well -- it mostly comes down to personal preference.  You can get cue extensions that fit between the shaft and butt to give you an extra 4-6"" of reach.  I know a few taller players who swear by these.  I wouldn't spend a whole lot of money on a jump/break cue unless you do a lot of jumping.  The Players JB6 runs around $90.  I've had one for about 2 years and it's a great cue, plus you can't beat the lifetime warranty.  If you want a specialized jump/break cue (fiber glass tip, lower weight, etc) then you're going to spend at least $150.  As for league rules, the only thing you have to worry about is APA where they don't allow jump cues -- a jump cue being any specialized cue that you would not normally shoot with, like a cue with an extra hard tip or one that you would break down for jumping.  I've heard of some leagues/bars banning phenolic tips because they can chip some of the  cheaper balls."
billiards,31i798,dalgeek,2,Sun Apr 5 10:40:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response, it definitely gave me a place to start researching.  What is your opinion of a jump/break cue compared to a designated jump and designated break cue? I've heard people say designated cues work much better, but I don't know if I want to spend the extra money or carry around a third cue if it's only a minute difference."
billiards,31i798,dalgeek,2,Mon Apr 6 00:12:42 2015 UTC,"I can't speak with authority on that issue because I don't do much jumping myself.  Dedicated jump cues tend to be shorter and lighter than even jump/break cues that break down.  A normal jump/break cue with the 3rd piece taken off will be about as long as a dedicated jump cue with all 3 pieces.  I've seen some jump cues as light as 10oz, which makes it easier to manage when you're shooting down on the cue ball.  Some good examples are the Predator Air II Jump and the OB Lift Pro."
billiards,31i798,dalgeek,2,Mon Apr 6 00:26:53 2015 UTC,"ok, I have one more question  I'm looking into maybe getting a slightly nicer cue and then putting a predator shaft on it because that seems to be what I've heard the most nice things about. Is it difficult to find a $80-$100 dollar cue that fits a low deflection shaft or not. I don't know how difficult matching up joints and such is, or if there is anything else you have to watch out for when doing this. Thanks for all your help   Edit: and what is the difference between the Z, the vantage, and the 314 shaft?"
billiards,31i798,redditor1983,2,Mon Apr 6 06:22:52 2015 UTC,"Buy the butt first then buy the shaft to fit it.  You can easily find a decent Players or Action cue around $100. Most companies have a favored joint type (or two) and you can normally find any shaft with various types of  joints. You can find the different joint types here: http://www.seyberts.com/cue_joints  For most players the joint type doesn't matter; /u/gabrielleigh can probably shed some light on the more common joint types and the best ones to look for. Personally I have a 5/16 x 18 on my Players with a Predator Z2 to match and it shoots great. I also have a Predator SP butt with a Uni-loc quick release joint, which is nice and fast to take apart but I find that it works its way loose and I never notice until I hear a weird ""tink"" while taking a shot.  The Z2 and 3142 are both low deflection shafts; as far as I know, the only difference is the diameter (11.75mm vs 12.75mm) and the taper (conical vs pro). The Vantage is a newer shaft and is supposed to have less mass up front but it's also thicker than the 3142.  I haven't used the Vantage so I can't tell you anything about it that isn't on the Predator web site. Some people swear by the thinner shaft and some people say it doesn't matter. For a newish player I doubt it matters beyond whatever is more comfortable."
billiards,31i798,wefolas,3,Mon Apr 6 07:27:56 2015 UTC,"I think you're focusing a little too much on dollar amounts, personally. Quality of cue and price are not necessarily directly correlated. And, in addition to that, a great player with a $100 stick can easily beat a newbie with a $1,500 cue.  My advice is to look into getting a low deflection shaft (generally these run about $200). The butt doesn't make that much of a difference.  The point is, you want to start shooting with a LD shaft now rather than later. As you get more and more experience, switching to a LD shaft becomes much harder because you've become accustomed to a regular shaft.  So, for the butt, just focus on getting something with the features you want, such as wrap/no wrap, weight, and ability to accept an extension (because you're tall). Then just get an LD shaft to fit it."
billiards,31i798,wefolas,2,Sun Apr 5 21:38:03 2015 UTC,"I'd also say, don't get hooked on the idea of a new cue if you don't know what you want, unless it's a McDermott which you already know you like.  Check out the marketplace forum on azbilliards, or ebay.  Find something you like from a seller with good rep.  Try it out, and if you don't like it, flip it.  Searching for a 69"" or 70"" cue should narrow your results pretty well and you can decide if you actually do want a longer cue."

billiards,31dqfc,SeabrookMiglla,2,Sun Apr 5 06:08:22 2015 UTC,"I try to hit a couple ""benchmark"" shots when I come up to a new table.  The 3 rail kick from corner to corner is pretty good for telling how the rails bounce, and a lag is good for checking table speed.  The cue ball also makes a huge difference in playing style.  Many coin tables use ""mud balls"" which weigh more and may be larger than the other balls.  The extra mass makes it damn near impossible to draw effectively and the cue ball tends to follow when you don't want it to.  My buddies and I play challenge games where we can't use stop/draw (or follow or English) so that we can play effectively when certain types of shots are unavailable or unreliable.  When I played in APA regionals, the first match was played with a mud ball and my opponent did nothing but gripe about the table and cue ball while I ran his ass over."
billiards,31dqfc,dalgeek,2,Sun Apr 5 20:48:06 2015 UTC,"I'm going through a similar thing. I have a cheap mdf table with a really grippy clothe. I learned how to spin the cue ball where I wanted on these conditions for the most part. Then recently I've been going to my local bars in my downtime from work and shooting a few racks there. The slate, the bumpers and the clothe were all wildly different. The cue ball rolled and bounced for ever and the cue ball spin has that cool delayed effect when spinning on the cloth. Where as on my home table it's so sticky. Anyway, I've started visiting all the tables around the city and it hasn't taken long for me to get a decent feel for the variations in tables. And  I'm able to seamlessly go from the high end table to my garbage table with relative ease.  So basically my advice is to get more time on that table and do conscious practice instead of just playing under pressure.  And this reply is getting long but I also find it's important for me to go play on public tables often as compared to practicing at home alone. It might just be me, but it helps to get used to all the noise and action of a bar compared to practicing at home in complete silence."
billiards,31dqfc,mattdebrown,1 point,Sat Apr 4 16:55:51 2015 UTC,"Just fyi, the cue ball has a lot to do with the variation of play that you're seeing too (in addition to the felt, rails, etc). For example an oversized rock, a 2-1/4"" magnetic cue ball, 2-1/8"" cue ball, an Aramith red-circle, Aramith 6-red dot, etc will all have noticeable differences ranging from subtle to very noticeable."

billiards,31dn9h,mattdebrown,5,Sat Apr 4 01:58:31 2015 UTC,"Hmm. This appears to be one of the hundreds of things in life that ""If they work for me, then they are good for me"" and can be considered in the realm of things that are subject to personal preference. Much like tip hardness, shaft diameter, taper style, cue weight, etc.  For him, this works great and gives him extra confidence in his mental game. Statistically, over a large number of identical shots, this may even up his potting percentage. I try to be open-minded about such tips and techniques, and if they can be demonstrated to improve a player's game, then I support it for sure. I'd be tempted, though, to do an even more in-depth analysis of is stroke to see if perhaps there is another underlying factor that might be contributing to him missing these long shots. While this tip works for him in these situations, I'd suspect there might be an even more fundamental change that could be implemented that allows him to make all shots easier without the use of this particular tip.   Who knows, really. I'd say he should go with it until he finds something that works even better. I know it is challenging and intimidating to make any kind of conscious change to your technique (especially when you reach an advanced stage of experience like him), so I applaud him for putting in the work to figure out a good hack for making these shots in his game.   For me, I find myself in these situations quite frequently. My little ""tip"" that works for my own mental game is this:    Examine the shot carefully. Look at the tangent lines to determine if any scratch potentially exists.  Inspect dome for proper scuffing and shape. Carefully remove any particles of dirt or fuzz that can deflect the cueball and cause a miss at such long range.  Chalk the tip evenly by spinning the tip inside the cube of chalk to evenly distribute the chalk around the circumference of the tip. Do not ""wipe"" the chalk across the dome, this leads to inconsistent chalk thickness across the dome.  Approach the table where my stuff is leaned up. With your non-bridge hand (to avoid the introduction of moisture to the cue), grasp my whiskey and coke with at least three fingers (including the front two in this case) With one smooth motion, bring the glass to my lips and take a deep and healthy swig of this luxury of life. Glance at your opponent without making any sudden movements. Allow one small corner of your mouth to (very briefly) curl upwards in a Grinch-like grin.  Return to the table, make the shot. Resume enjoyment of the whiskey and coke.    This works for me in many cases, but I know from experience the choice of drink would really throw off a lot of people's concentration and make the shot even harder.   Whatever floats your boat, chaps."
billiards,31dn9h,gabrielleigh,2,Sat Apr 4 11:21:07 2015 UTC,"With your non-bridge hand (to avoid the introduction of moisture to the cue), grasp my whiskey and coke with at least three fingers (including the front two in this case)   This may be the most critical part of the pre shot routine.  Don't mess this up!"
billiards,31dn9h,dalgeek,4,Mon Apr 6 07:31:25 2015 UTC,"Everyone here is way too quick to dismiss stuff like this.   The back hand grip is responsible for a lot of little twitches and steering that throw the tip off the intended line. There's one common example that is well-known and widely accepted - ever see someone try to do power draw, they hit the ball hard, and they get no draw at all?   One of the culprits is their grip fingers - as you swing backwards, your hand rotates, it's pointing diagonally a bit instead of up and down. Before the shot, when the whole forearm was vertical, there was no particular pressure on any of the fingers. But when the hand (and fingers) are all angled diagonally, the grip hand fingers press upward into the bottom of the cue butt. Then during the forward swing, their hand clenches, the whole cue lifts just a hair, the tip is no longer delivered to the bottom of the cue ball, and you get no draw.   Two common fixes are to loosen that wrist, and to loosen those rear fingers so they can't push the cue around.  This guy's tip works on the same principle, that your fingers can cause unintended steering. Therefore, take them away and just let the hand carry the cue, supporting it like a battering ram rather than thrusting it like a spear. Little imperfections in your back grip are taken out of the equation.  This is the kind of thing people should at least TRY before dismissing it ""because reddit"" (or someone else) said it's stupid. Even those who tried it and say it doesn't work... it could be that this just solves one problem with their stroke and there are 4 more that need fixing too."
billiards,31dn9h,CreeDorofl,1 point,Sat Apr 4 16:11:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm with you dude. I don't always fear making long straight shots but if they aren't working for you this tip seems to work. I tried it and was comfortably making lots of long shots. I just went back and forth on the table running long shots for a decent while (by my personal standards). Of course there is maybe a ""perfect"" way to play but if you can pot the shot and get shape how can you complain? There are lots of weird strokes and ticks that plenty of pros have that don't seem to hurt their game at all."

The index and middle finger are the closest to the business end of the cue. If you need a looser grip, some players might choose to drop the pinkie finger.   For anyone new to the game, this is one of the worst pieces of advice I have come across.  0/10 would not recommend."

billiards,31dw50,cryptobark,2,Sat Apr 4 03:28:38 2015 UTC,"Haven't seen any of the new models come through the shop yet, but I am anxious to see the internal changes they made. These LD shafts are hugely popular in my area.   The Z3 looks like they designed a slightly-different ferrule that now has a black ""fiber tip silencer"" inside of the thin plastic ferrule. The fiber piece now extends just a tiny bit back into the hollow bore, sandwiching the delicate ends of the spliced shaft wood between the fiber piece and the very thin ferrule. Here is a visual comparison straight from their website:  The Old ""Z2"" Ferrule Design  The new ""Z3"" Ferrule Design with Fiber Tip Silencer  I'd expect this change will make a very slight improvement to the tenon strength of the Z3 over the old Z2, but they continue to use an extremely thin and weak ferrule ""veneer"" tube which as far as I know will continue to be made from a very cheap and weak thermoset plastic instead of a much stronger (and more costly) material like phenolic or melamine.   My prediction is there will be a slight drop in tenon break-offs, but the same amount of ferrules cracking and splitting.   And I am seeing more and more of them come in with huge flaws in the wood pie slices chosen for construction. I have no idea how some of this stuff makes it past QA. I have seen actual knots and obvious birdseyes that would have immediately sent that blank to the reject bin in the past. The Predator shafts from years ago seemed to have much nicer lumber in them. The grain runoff was minimal, and I was generally impressed with their choice of good maple to make their old shafts years ago. Now I get them in the shop with warpage and splitting and I look at the woods used and they wouldn't have even been acceptable for use in a butt blank, let alone making shaft wood from it.   I think Predator has some fantastic technology and concepts in general, my only wish is that they would scale back the mass production and scale up their wood selection standards and QA department. In my opinion, if they would simply install a short (solid) hardwood tenon inside the hollow bore of their shafts and use a strong phenolic ferrule they could cut back the breakage by a huge margin."
billiards,31dw50,gabrielleigh,1 point,Sat Apr 4 11:48:45 2015 UTC,"Not the same at all, but I've been using a cue for a little while with a similar ferrule/carbon plate to the Z3, and I fucking hammer balls about - Nobody else at the club has had a ferrule stand up to the beating I've given that thing.   I would wager that Predator have put a LOT of money into researching it.  If you're gonna hammer the fuck out of it, Z3 is the way forward, if not, I'd stick to the z2 or 3142, if they're gonna drop the prices."

billiards,31ahbj,ZeppyFloyd,8,Fri Apr 3 08:29:56 2015 UTC,"No wonder so many beginners find this so confusing; you just asked for advice and almost every single reply contained or implied at least one myth.  The problems you're seeing when you try to use follow and draw are all caused by not hitting the ball where you think you're hitting it.  If you hit the ball too close to the center, you don't get the action you're going for.  If you hit the ball too far from center, you miscue, which can cause the scoop-jump and the other problems you described.  Use a cue with a good tip, chalk thoroughly, and practice using a numbered ball as your cue ball.  Before every shot, line the ball up so the number is facing you, right-side-up.  Then look at where your chalk-mark is, after every shot, relative to that number.  Is it where you thought you were hitting the ball?"

billiards,31ahbj,dalgeek,2,Fri Apr 3 12:55:35 2015 UTC,"No so much accelerating, but following through the cue ball is essential.  Also, if you're using proper equipment, it takes surprisingly little effort to stop and draw.  One reason people scoop the cue ball is they try to hit harder than normal, which throws off their stroke then they end up hitting where they don't intend.  Slow down your stroke and make sure you're hitting the cue ball where you want (say 1 tip low to start) before trying to do it with power."

Once I made sure I was taking a nice, slow backswing, following through and staying down, I stopped miscuing almost completely.  So yeah, work on your stroke first and foremost, make sure it's consistent a straight, and then you can really start training your draw shots."

As for #2, I've seen advanced level players fall into the trap of angling their cue with their shooting hand. So, it happens. But if you watch snooker players in particular, you'll notice how ""flat"" their strokes are.  It wouldn't hurt having someone take a video of some of your shots as well. Then you can have a good idea of what you're doing.   One more thing I didn't mention: it may be helpful to use the circle bridge, to ensure you're hitting your target on the cue ball."
billiards,31ahbj,MaskedEngineer,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:00:33 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate on what the circle bridge is?
billiards,31ahbj,pantlessrobo,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:44:19 2015 UTC,It's also called the closed bridge. You wrap your index finger around the cue and close it with your thumb. Do a Google images search for it and you'll see what I mean.
billiards,31ahbj,MaskedEngineer,1 point,Fri Apr 3 17:20:16 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah. That's what I do. Didn't know that's what it's called.  Also, what situations would you use an open bridge? What's the practical difference between shots made using the circle bridge and the open bridge?"

Every numbered ball less than 8 is always solid and every number greater than 8 is a stripe.  Simple.  Easy.  Completely disregarded."

billiards,319l32,lunchboxweld,4,Fri Apr 3 02:18:39 2015 UTC,"With 8-ball, the most common way two people wager is by having what is called a ""race"". If both players are of similar skill and experience, you can start the race out at an even number such as a race to five games. Keep track of the games, and whoever wins five games first wins the bet. You can keep track of the score any way you like, but keep the score in a way that is clear and indisputable to all parties involved. Almost nothing causes more unnecessary drama in pool betting than inaccurate or questionable score keeping.   If the players have a gap in skill or experience, the ""race"" can easily be adjusted to make the more experienced player win more games to win the race. For example, the better player could play to win 7 games, and the less-experienced player only has to win 5 games to win the race. This would be called a ""7-5 race for $20"" or whatever amount you decide is fun.   In 9-ball, this same race format can be used, but due to the rotation nature of the game, you can also incorporate ""spots"" (balls needed to win individual games) into each game of a set. Normally, whoever makes the 9 wins the game, but a less-experienced player can be given a ""spot"" to make each game easier for them to win. A more experienced player can ""give you the 8"", and you would only have to shoot the balls in rotation up to making the 8 to win the game. The more experienced player would still have to make the 9 to win the game. You can adjust that ""spot"" as far as necessary to roughly balance the odds where a reasonable challenge is presented to both players despite the difference in experience or skill.   Lots of creative methods are used to balance the odds between two players, and by far the most important thing (regardless of what is arranged) is that whatever is arranged is completely and clearly understood by all parties participating in the gambling. Be clear and concise with the terms you seek, and make sure you get clear and concise agreement with your opponent before you begin the match. If one player is obviously dominating each set with a given spot, then the player who is easily winning should be open-minded about adjusting the spot to allow the matches to be more competitive. These are the standards of ""gentleman pool"", which I am a strong proponent of, although gambling in general can bring out the worst in people from time to time. Just do your best to promote a fair and balanced game, and be a gracious loser as well as a gracious winner and people will be happy they had the opportunity to play with you."

There's a lot of different ways to bet on this, but here are some we do on my table:   9-ball, dollar per ball, five bucks a game. Every time someone sinks a ball, everyone else pays him a dollar. When someone sinks the 9-ball, everyone pays him five bucks. You can do this at any amount, say, quarter a ball, dollar a game.  9-ball, dollar on the 5-ball, dollar on the 9-ball. As above except only the 5 and 9 pay out. 9-ball. When someone pockets a ball, everyone else drinks. If you scratch, you drink.

In more casual play, I gamble by the game. ""$3 on this game?"" ""Lunch on this game?"" ""$1 on this game?"" etc..   By the game is easier if you're in a group. You can play someone for a couple bucks, the winner (king of the table) gets to stay and keep playing the next opponent until he loses.  You could also opt for a small tourney. Everybody pitches in $___, you make a random bracket and winner takes all (if there are enough participants, you can pay out further than first)."
billiards,319l32,Appetite_TDE,1 point,Fri Apr 3 06:18:13 2015 UTC,"If you match up well with your opponent, I recommend playing X ahead (I like to play 6 ahead).  It's very similar to a race format.  You just play to get X wins ahead of your opponent.  Move a quarter along the diamonds to mark your wins.  Left is your opponent, right is you.  First person to get the quarter to X diamond on their respective side takes the bacon.    The reason I like it is, it makes for a long match and a real fight for the money.  Play it for a higher bet than you would a race because you could be in action for hours to get that win.    Also it's worth noting, if you start to get in action frequently, you are going to find bad gambles.  I don't mean people who blew you out.  I'm talking about people who want to change the rules while you are on the case balls or people who fire air barrels in hopes for a win.  Don't disrespect them as it will hurt your chance for more action (people talk shit).  Just don't play them again and move on."

If you have a more upright stance, your effective wingspan will be shorter and adjusting for that can free up your stroke a little bit. You can also try widening your legs to get a little bit lower because you cant do that with your back."
billiards,318po9,gotwired,1 point,Thu Apr 2 23:53:16 2015 UTC,"I tweaked my back and ended up relearning how to shoot from an upright ""old man"" stance.

Your seeing the balls from an angle that you never really had to before, so it'll take some adjusting."

billiards,31882z,Sweatybecker,2,Thu Apr 2 19:51:59 2015 UTC,"I have noticed that some ""bar"" triangles are smaller than ones I have seen in pool halls and from the one I use.  Your best option is it take a measurement of one of your balls and see if it is the standard size.  According to WPA/BCA equipment specifications, the weight may be from 5.5 to 6 oz. (156–170 g) with a diameter of 2.25 in. (57.15 mm), plus or minus 0.005 in. (0.127 mm)"
billiards,31882z,unkn0wnEntity,2,Thu Apr 2 20:34:20 2015 UTC,"It will hurt your game. Smaller balls require less energy to get moving, exhibit FAR less contact throw, and drop their speed much more gracefully. On top of that, your pool pockets will be like buckets if you use snooker balls. If you are used to these, you'll be in big trouble playing with a normal sized set."
billiards,31882z,HappySoda,1 point,Sat Apr 4 05:35:01 2015 UTC,"This makes sense, thank you for the reply. The pockets on my table are small to begin with and have the snooker style rounded knuckles instead of the angle style pool pockets so I feel like shooting bigger balls in to smaller pockets will force me to be even more accurate."
billiards,31882z,HappySoda,2,Sat Apr 4 21:51:52 2015 UTC,"Wait, then you don't have a pool table as people here would commonly think of it. That's sometimes referred to as ""Chinese pool"". It's basically a scaled down snooker table, very popular in Asia. In that case, shoot with the smaller balls. You won't be able to learn much if you shoot with regular pool balls, since you will almost always miss on a table like that. That breaks the feedback loop."

Definitely don't squirt any WD-40 up there, but you can squirt a shot of Windex on a Qtip or dip it in rubbing alchohol  and gently swirl it around inside the pilot hole. Hold the shaft upright when doing this, so any liquid will tend to drain out the shaft hole instead of running up into the joint and staying inside the shaft. You'll probably see some black and blue grime, maybe some brass colored dust and other stuff on the Qtip when you pull it out, this is normal. Also squirt a shot of Windex or alcohol on a clean paper towel, then wipe the joint pin down really good and use your fingernails to press the paper towel into the short section of threads to see if anything has gummed up the threads on the joint pin. Once you have thoroughly cleaned everything you can see, inspect everything to make sure you didn't leave any bits of Qtip cotton fibers or paper towel fuzz on anything. Let it air-dry for a few minutes, then test fit it together again. This works in about 95% of cases. If this doesn't work, then you will need to take the cue to a cue maintenance specialist to have the pilot hole inspected and possibly they will need to determine the thread size and pitch of the pin and run a tap up into the shaft to clean the threads so it will screw together again. Generally about a five-minute fix and most cuesmiths probably won't even charge you for it.   The threads look like a common 5/16"" x 18 size, but they could easily be metric or some proprietary thread profile, too. Good luck, I hope these suggestions help!"

I'm on the fence about this. But from the outside watching a match between efren and earl, I definitely appreciate efrens grin when he misses versus earls meltdown. And from the limited amount of earl I've seen it seems his emotion can carry over to his next shot and starts a mental meltdown. I'm sure efren hates missing but being able to let it go, and/or control what he lets his opponent see seems advantageous. It's almost like showing fear or weakness.

But is what you did actually legal?  I know in games like 10 ball where they play call shot/call safe, if you shoot your ball into a pocket after you called ""safe"" then the opponent has the option to take the shot or make you shoot again.  That rule is specifically designed to prevent shots like the one you did.  But of course, that may not be the case in the rule set you were playing by.  EDIT: I just checked the rules. Your shot was legal. Personally I would not have been upset if I were your opponent because I agreed to play the match with those rules. But I also think that's a really shitty rule. I prefer the more professional way of allowing the opponent the choice of shot."

That last shot at position #4 is not worth practicing in the side pocket. It's great for the corner, however. If you have to stay in the side pocket, move the cue ball a half-diamond downwards to make it more realistic, while accomplishing what you initially wanted: reversing or cutting it backwards, relatively.

I built it purely to troll them back, and I could have easily beat up on them using just my regular cue. The balance and weight were fine for jumping, but rather light for playing. While it allowed me to easily jump when I needed, it was a bit of a handicap for playing the rest of the normal shots. Funny in concept, and as far as I know there was never a successful challenge to the ""legality"" of it.

It's either that it's OK to jump with your shooting cue, or jumping with your break cue.   In any occasion, you may not use a shortened jump cue or break down your cue and only use the shaft.    The only way to legally perform a jump shot is to shoot down on the cue ball. Scoop jumps are never legal."

It's still a playing shaft. I just think I'll have to practice a bit to get the full cue jump down(which reminds me that I need to get a spare piece of cloth to use as a jump pad).
billiards,30pw2r,gabrielleigh,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:27:16 2015 UTC,"There are two decent super-hard jump tips that are legal to use in all formats (as far as I know). The economical option is called the Water Buffalo tip. It is extremely dense leather that holds its shape quite well and withstands brutal breaking very nicely. My favorite way to install them is to glue them on and machine about half the thickness off before doming them. This makes them thinner and they feel even harder. Jumping is not too bad with the WB, and I find it is slightly easier to jump when they are cut down a bit as well.   The more expensive option (which I prefer and use on my own jump/breaks) is the Samsara jump/break tip. It is essentially petrified leather or some other insanely hard material. I honestly don't know for sure how it is made or what it is made of, but it is also legal in all formats that I know of. These things are damn near indestructable, and I just dome them at full installed height and have no problems jumping or breaking with lots of english."

Ended up getting the jacoby edge hybrid, absolutely love it! But again they are all good, just different. They make shafts that are low deflection (lighter towards the tip) and shafts that are 'laminate/hybrid' or pieces of wood fused together, in some type of pie configuration usually. That randomizes the grain pattern and gives a more consistent hit. Some people love low deflection shafts and others like being able to put more squirt/swerve on the ball. I'd say jacoby edge or any predator. Lucasi or universal are good and cheaper as well.

billiards,30m6i8,MonsieurX,1 point,Sun Mar 29 06:23:58 2015 UTC,"Hi, i went from I-2, to I-3 to 314 to Z2... I wont touch another I-3 but all these cues are very good. The I-2 will allow dialing deflection but can give unwanted deflection too. The 314 and Z2 are awesome, no deflection at all. The Z2 requires more experience and care when aiming... Otherwise it's my new favorite. I dont think i will go back to 314...   I have a gripe with the I-3, it's too thin and the cue's tip often jumped over a cue ball stuck to the rail... Too flexible IMOHO...  But it's amazing at giving spins, better than the Z2... But i will appreciate any arguments - i wasn't as good a player when i had it... The Z2 is much much stiffer and delivers spot on everytime..."

Just wears out your tip faster, i think your joint should be fine. It may be a problem if you are one of those players that bend the shaft into the table during break, but even then i think your cue would hold up."
billiards,30k2n7,ac120205,1 point,Sat Mar 28 08:19:12 2015 UTC,"The biggest probably, besides being a pita switching every time, is some league nit that will call a forfeit for breaking down your cue if you forget to tell him you are. I've seen all kinds of arguments about this running tourneys.  I'd just use it to break with and replace the tip more often as long as you aren't slamming the rack."
billiards,30k2n7,fadedcheese,1 point,Sat Mar 28 13:27:19 2015 UTC,"Not a bad idea at all, especially if you play with an expensive layered tip on your playing shaft. Like fadedcheese said, you'll have a bit of a delay every game you break where you change shafts, but as long as you are fine with that then it isn't a ""bad idea"".   Also, if you have room in your pool case for another butt, you can pick up a cheap ""sneaky pete"" cue just to break with for just a little bit of cash. I have a lot of people buy these and bring them over to the shop to have a super-hard break tip installed, then they are good to go with a cheap breaker to save the wear and tear on their playing cue. Here are some good ones if this idea seems interesting:  http://www.ozonebilliards.com/lucasi-cues-one-piece-l-2-20oz-l-2-20.html $36.00 True Rosewood Four-Prong One-Piece Cue Le Pro Tip No Wrap 3/8 X 10 Joint High Impact Fiber Ferrule  Also about $36.00 is the Dufferin http://www.ozonebilliards.com/duonepihihop2.html 100% Canadian Hard Rock Maple shaft True four-prong construction for a rock solid hit High-impact fiber ferrule with a Lifetime Guarantee High-polish Super UV finish Traditional Dufferin taper for years of warp free usage 12.5mm Le Pro tip pre-shaped and scuffed to a dime radius 58"" Length and weighs 20oz  These are one-piece house cues, and you can usually have them cut in half and a good pin such as the 3/8"" x 10 pin installed for less than $50. You can also order these cues already jointed, but generally the expense of ordering them already in two-pieces is quite a bit higher than having them converted. I like the Lucasi and Dufferin cues because of the good woods and reasonable quality of construction for a factory-made cue. There are a lot of cheaper import house cues which can work, too, but they often use inferior softwoods and have some pretty horrendous methods for installing weight into the butt of the cue which makes servicing them quite unpleasant.   Anyhow, for around a hundred bucks total you can get into a brand new dedicated break cue and save yourself the time and trouble of swapping shafts each break.   And Ryan at RAT cues is a great guy. I am acquainted with him through some facebook groups, and he is one of the best in the business. You won't go wrong with him, he stands behind his work and puts out a gorgeous cue."

Call shot pool is great if everyone wants to minimize the luck factor to an extent. Conventional nine ball is generally played where balls count as long as a legal hit is made on the lowest ball first. I'd say it is quite a bit more common for ""slop"" to be normal and allowed, but I do see quite a few games set up with call pocket as well. As long as all parties involved in the game know and clearly understand the format and rules then there shouldn't be any drama about it.

The highest quality non-commercial (furniture-style) table IMO)   I personally would stay away from most furniture-grade tables.  They look nice, but typically lack support in the sub-frame and are built from inferior quality materials.  Pool tables range in size from 6' to 10'.  Most home tables are 8 foot, most bar tables are 7 foot.  The size is purely a function of how much space is available.  General rule of thumb is to get the largest table your space and budget will allow.    Minimum room size: add at LEAST 5 feet to each side of the table.  So, for a 4'x8' table, you will need a 14'x18' space for it.  More if you plan on having furniture etc. around the table."

billiards,30ejtg,slorebear,1 point,Fri Mar 27 12:34:19 2015 UTC,Craigslist?
billiards,30ejtg,B-Mack,2,Fri Mar 27 13:04:35 2015 UTC,"That's where all the best deals are it seems.  Use http://www.searchtempest.com/ to search multiple craigslist markets within a designated search radius.  That's how I found my table.  I was looking in a 400 mile radius, which is up to about a 6 hour drive.  Should give you a lot of options to consider.  Quick note:  Don't expect the person you're buying the table from to know anything at all about it or tables in general.  I spoke to very few sellers who were knowledgeable about the table they were selling.  Ask questions here and at AZBilliards forums if you want legitimate answers."
billiards,30ejtg,fadedcheese,2,Fri Mar 27 13:08:07 2015 UTC,"You can probably find a decent used 9' table on craigslist for around $700. Will probably spent another $300-400 having it moved and set up at your house. So you're probably looking at around $1000 (if you don't have to refelt or do any other work on the table)  I'd definitely recommend buying a used good quality table vs a new, crappy one..."

Leagues really are built for beginning level players to have an environment to get experience and exposure to better players.

billiards,30ec29,unoriginalsin,2,Thu Mar 26 18:28:34 2015 UTC,"Did you mean this?   RULES: FARGO   Except when clearly contradicted by these additional rules, the General Rules of Pocket Billiards apply.    TYPE OF GAME:    FARGO is a game that consists of 10 innings (or frames). The player's game score is the total of the scores for these 10 innings. In each inning, the player scores points until he either misses or succeeds in shooting all 15 balls. Fargo is a challenging game, with aspects of both straight pool and rotation, and is suitable for both beginner and expert players.   PLAYERS:    Any number of players can compete.   BALLS USED:    A standard set of balls, 1-15, plus the cue ball.   THE RACK:   A standard triangle rack is used. The balls are racked at the beginning of each inning for each player. The player may choose to rack his own balls and to place balls in the rack in any order that he believes is to his advantage.   OBJECT OF THE GAME:    To score more total points than the opponent(s) in a predetermined number of innings (300 points is the maximum in a 10 inning game).   SCORING:    Each inning consists of a ""random phase"" and a ""rotation phase"". In the beginning of each inning the player places a coin on the table rail with the heads up (or some other conspicuous marking device may be used, such as a piece of paper with ""random"" written on one side and ""rotation"" on the other). Balls are then pocketed in any order (i.e. in ""random"" order) and they count one point each. At any time during the inning, including before the first ball is pocketed, the player may choose to turn the coin over. This designates the beginning of the rotation phase. After the coin flip, the lowest numbered ball on the table must be contacted first (i.e. the balls are shot in ""rotation""). Any legally pocketed balls after the coin flip count two points each. There is only a single coin flip each inning.    OPENING BREAK:    At the start of each inning the player breaks from behind the headstring and has a free break (no special balls to cushion or other requirements once the break stroke commences, and there is no penalty for scratches or jumped balls). Any balls pocketed on the break shot or jumped off the table are spotted, and the player begins by taking ball in hand anywhere on the table.    RULES OF PLAY:   8.1. Fargo is a call shot game. The player must designate the ball and call a pocket for each shot. He need not indicate kisses, caroms, combinations, or cushions (all of which are allowed). A legally pocketed ball entitles the shooter to continue at the table until he fails to pocket legally a called ball, or until he has pocketed all of the balls.   8.2. The player is entitled to any additional balls that are pocketed on a shot, as long as he pockets legally his called ball; the additional balls count the same as the called ball.  8.3. Initial playing order is determined by lag, or if several opponents are playing, by lot. Shooting order for subsequent innings is determined by the scoring results of the preceding innings - the player with the highest score shooting first. If several opponents are playing, all of the players shoot in order of their partial scores, with the higher players going first. In the event of a tied score the playing order is the same as for the previous inning. When playing on separate tables, or in separate locations as in an internet competition, the player order is determined by the Tournament Director as appropriate and practical for the situation; this includes the option of playing the entire 10 innings and reporting the scores to the Tournament Director at the end of the game.    PENALTY FOR FOULS:    There is no point penalty for fouls; the player's inning ends and any balls pocketed on the foul stroke do not count. After the coin flip (i.e. during the rotation phase), contacting first an object ball other than the lowest numbered ball (a bad hit) is a foul  FARGO FAQs   1) Do I have to call my shots?  Yes, see rule 8.1. The ball and the pocket must be designated, the other details are irrelevant, just as in Equal Offense or 14.1. Shots must be called in both the random and the rotation phases.  2) What if I scratch on the break?  See rule 7. There is no penalty for a scratch on the break, or for jumped balls.  3) If an extra ball slops in during the rotation phase, does it count as two points?  Yes, see rules 6 and 8.2. Balls pocketed legally before the coin flip (during the random phase) count one point each, balls pocketed after the coin flip (the rotation phase) count two points each.  4) After I turn over the coin and take a shot in the rotation phase, may I change my mind and flip it back to the random phase?  No, see rule 6. After the coin is flipped, you are committed to the rotation phase for the rest of that inning.  5)If I shoot in 14 balls in the random phase, may I flip the coin to get two points for the last ball?  Yes.  6) Are combinations OK in the rotation phase?  Yes, combinations and caroms are allowed in the rotation phase. The requirement is the same as in 9-ball, namely that you hit the lowest numbered ball first, with the addition that the ball must be designated and its pocket must be called.  7) What are some good strategies?  This depends on the player's skill level. A beginner (say someone who typically scores less than 100 should simply try to pocket all the balls he can randomly; if he gets to a point where he knows a cluster is going to stop the run, or if he runs down to the last two or three balls, only then should he consider flipping the coin. An intermediate player (100 to 200 points) should clear out all the clusters and trouble balls during the random phase, and play as many balls as possible at the end of the run in rotation. An advanced player (over 200 points should break out only the most difficult clusters during the random phase, and he will be able to break out the remaining clusters during the rotation phase; with a lucky break and a good spread of the balls, he may be able to play the entire 15 balls in rotation.  8 ) How do I rack the balls to make the rotation phase as easy as possible?  In general, the corner balls roll the farthest, balls along the sides and the rear of the rack tend to stay together, and the three balls in the middle usually don't roll very far.On the break shot, you want a good spread of the balls to minimize the number of clusters, but not so much scatter that the nearby balls are widely separated. Experiment with both ball position in the rack and various break shots to see what works best for you.  More details from: www.playpool.com"

billiards,30dzcg,wheelsno3,8,Thu Mar 26 17:58:58 2015 UTC,I always play BCAPL rules. If someone comes to my table and refuses to play those rules I simply walk away.   Bar rules can be abused and lead to fights due to the oral tradition nature of them since these rules can vary.   Never play bar rules. They need to be eliminated for the health of the game long term.

billiards,30dzcg,wheelsno3,1 point,Thu Mar 26 17:07:08 2015 UTC,Many bar rules lead to stymies.  One important rule is 'hitting a rail after contact'  and 'ball in hand after a foul'
billiards,30dzcg,DetroitLarry,2,Thu Mar 26 21:40:32 2015 UTC,When you don't even have to hit a ball because there are no table fouls then the game is compromised. Bar rules suck. But you know that.
billiards,30dzcg,Njdevils11,1 point,Thu Mar 26 21:46:58 2015 UTC,"The main problem that leads to most of the arguments is the unwritten rule of ""honest effort"" that typically accompanies bar rules.  One problem with honest effort is that it's usually not verbalized and everyone has a different opinion of what's acceptable. The bigger issue is that it's unenforceable. Rules like that always lead to pissing contests amongst certain types of people."
billiards,30dzcg,level32,2,Fri Mar 27 01:28:33 2015 UTC,Uhg. I hate when I see someone do this and then watch the smug look on their face as they think they played a skilled defensive shot.
billiards,30dzcg,Troyandabedinthemoor,3,Fri Mar 27 01:34:44 2015 UTC,I play in an 8 Ball VNEA league. Ball in hand unless on the break... then it's behind the line.
billiards,30dzcg,Wampoose,2,Thu Mar 26 17:40:27 2015 UTC,Don't see a lot of Canadian VNEA players around here... good day sir!
billiards,30dzcg,jerutley,2,Thu Mar 26 17:48:49 2015 UTC,"Ball in hand for everything.   I used to play 'behind the line and shoot forward' but it was frustrating when it worked to the foulers advantage. My friends and I have a lot more fun since we changed this rule.   I'm the most experienced player in that group of friends, so they generally ask me to decide the rules, and I let those rules vary a little depending on the experience level of the players. (Like I don't ask that new players try and call all their shots, it's just too much to expect from a beginner.)  That's when I'm just trying to make sure that everyone has fun. In league play and when playing against strangers, it's best to have a pre-agreed upon written copy of the rules. There's usually some 'house rules' on the wall of the bar, and if not I look up BCAPL rules on my phone, just so they're handy."
billiards,30dzcg,wheelsno3,2,Thu Mar 26 17:38:43 2015 UTC,Ball in hand means you can put the cue ball anywhere on the table you want and shoot from there.  Behind the line (also sometimes known as behind the head string) means you can put the cue anywhere within the top 1/3 of the table - usually same as the rule for the break.
billiards,30dzcg,iams3b,2,Thu Mar 26 23:38:36 2015 UTC,It is supposed to be easy. The other player fouled. It is a punishment.
billiards,30dzcg,Diial,1 point,Fri Mar 27 01:30:06 2015 UTC,"That's like saying, in basketball, a free throw seems too easy because nobody's blocking you and you're close to the hoop... Yeah well you shouldn't of fouled the dude, this is your punishment, and You sir shouldn't of scratched!"
billiards,30dzcg,wheelsno3,2,Fri Mar 27 02:01:44 2015 UTC,"Omfg I used this exact example two nights ago.   I just started playing really often (at least 3 times a week) but I just got a good idea of league rules a week ago. My friends and I love competitive official rules in any game. My gf was not understanding how our new ""ball in hand"" rule was fair since we also used to always goes behind head string for scratches. She said it's unfair and too easy.   So I just said, yeah and when a basketball player gets fouled he gets two extremely easy shots, but hey, the other person shouldn't have fouled. It's a fair punishment. Needless to say my point didn't come across her logic as fair no matter how I cut it.   As far as my mindset goes, yeah I always used to play head string fouls, but if I fuck up, yeah I should be punished, and it makes sense that anyone who fucks up gets punished the same way."
billiards,30dzcg,Diial,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:07:56 2015 UTC,The problem is that most people have never played enough pool to get screwed by someone fouling on purpose when your only ball in in the kitchen. So they don't understand why ball in hand in vastly superior to ball in kitchen.
billiards,30dzcg,CreeDorofl,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:28:15 2015 UTC,Yeah it definitely always sucked when my only ball was behind head sting so if my opponent fouled (my ball probably blocking his shot) it'd be a back and fourth game of trying to make long ass bank shots from fouling or shitting positions ten times over.
billiards,30dzcg,MaskedEngineer,2,Fri Mar 27 12:06:37 2015 UTC,"Neither exactly - Some league rules are a bit like bar rules.   For example not having to call shots in 8 ball feels bar-like to me, but that's the rule in the APA, the largest american and canadian league. So I go by BCA rules (which have two flavors that are nearly identical, general BCA rules and BCA Pool League rules).  Bar rules are designed to make the game easier on beginners, as pool has a pretty steep learning curve. But in the hands of good players, they can become abusive and ruin the game. Some of them are based whether you're doing something intentionally or not, which obviously cannot be proven and therefore leads to arguments. I like my rules cut-and-dried.  Ball-in-hand anywhere is actually better for beginners, as it's very strong in the hands of good players who will use the ball in hand to solve the worst problem on the table, then run the rest of the rack. Whereas beginners can get the game moving by setting up for a very easy shot, but are no threat to win just because they got ball in hand. I recommend you use ball in hand all the time."
billiards,30dzcg,CreeDorofl,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:43:37 2015 UTC,"Bar rules are designed to make the game easier on beginners, as pool has a pretty steep learning curve.   This makes it sound like there's a bar pool committee somewhere, trying to simplify people's lives.   Bar rules are disseminated by word of mouth and vary wildly in various parts of the US, not to mention the planet. I know very good players who have never played outside of their local bar and who insist they will never play league rules because component ""X"" of said rules constitutes ""cheating"" or ""slop"" or <you name it>. They just can't wrap their brain around the possibility of playing the game some other way."
billiards,30dzcg,MaskedEngineer,2,Sat Mar 28 03:05:10 2015 UTC,"haha yeah ""designed"" was not the right word there. It just sort of happens organically. One person decides ""well that's too hard"" or ""that's unfair"" and they both agree ""ok next time, I can move the ball off the rail by 1 cue butt width!"" and it catches on."
billiards,30dzcg,TimmersOG,2,Thu Mar 26 18:37:00 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's hilarious what it's come to in some circles. There are areas along the AZ border where you're expected to try to make a shot no matter what. Any hint that you're trying to play safe in any way will elicit cat calls and ""coyote!"" and maybe even a physical confrontation if you play an outright safety and there's enough money on the line.  They haven't the slightest idea that this might be unusual."
billiards,30dzcg,wheelsno3,2,Thu Mar 26 21:47:02 2015 UTC,"House for us is, ball in hand for all fouls except on the break, ball on the break does not determine your balls, ball must go in the pocket you call, but we don't care how it gets there."

I'll work on my stability, and balance a bit more. It's never been in my thought process to think about my bridge hand, but I think I'm gonna put some work into to make sure it's good enough.  I have a problem in pocketing consistently, and I have a feeling my weak closed bridge might be the problem."
billiards,30cyeo,PulseAmplification,2,Thu Mar 26 20:03:29 2015 UTC,"If you're using a closed bridge, keep your palm on the table and stabilize with your pinky and middle finger.  If using an open bridge, a good trick is to tuck your middle and ring finger underneath (like ""metal horns"" or the sign language for ""I love you"") and use your thumb and index finger knuckle to rest your cue."

I'm going to take a video of my bridge hand tonight to see if I can see problems with it while shooting some difficult shots. I'll post the results! Since its hard to get a visual without a visual lol.   Thank you."

billiards,3071w3,reeve27,7,Wed Mar 25 00:10:43 2015 UTC,"Professional cue repairman here.  I doubt there is anything you are doing to cause this problem. Aside from jabbing the cue into the ground or other hard surface intentionally, this problem is more likely caused by the natural grain of the leather having a weak spot in it. Often, a tip will ""chunk"" or split like this along that weakness in the grain of the leather. This can happen years after installation, or immediately afterwards. I don't know of any normal use of the cue that might cause this to happen, though. Simply bad luck with the piece of leather used to manufacture the tip.   I'd recommend having a local cue repairman replace the tip. They will advise you on the cost and the different tip brands they might carry. Prices vary a lot, and mostly due to the difference in cost between the various brands of tips available. Expect to pay anywhere from $5.00 to $40.00 for a tip replacement job depending on whether you pick an entry level tip or a more expensive layered name brand tip.   No worries, though. I doubt you'll have this problem with the next tip you get installed. This type of problem is quite uncommon and is mostly attributable to bad luck."

billiards,3071w3,gabrielleigh,1 point,Wed Mar 25 03:16:45 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the answer. Do you have a recommended tip? At least for a beginner?
billiards,3071w3,gabrielleigh,3,Wed Mar 25 08:03:16 2015 UTC,"A tip recommendation will start by figuring out your budget for the purchase and installation of the tip. Once we have a dollar range you want to spend, then I can decide which tips might fit your budget and we can move on to the choice of brand, hardness, and other choices.   If your budget falls in the ""cheap as possible"" range, then some of the common economy tips that are stocked by most repairmen are tips like the ""LePro"", ""Elk Master"", and ""Triumph"" tips. There are quite a few other inexpensive brands, and other choices may be available depending on who you find to install them. These three economy tips are all single-layer tips cut from a thick cow or pig hide.   Moving up in price, you could also have a ""layered"" tip installed. These tips are more expensive because generally the manufacturing process is a bit more complicated and time consuming. Layered tips are made from several layers of leather which are glued together like a sandwich. Layered tips are often marketed as ""better"" than single-layer tips, but I can't say I support those claims. A ""good"" tip is simply a tip you like, and a good tip will also resist deformation and damage and provide you with a consistent and predictable hit.   Layered tips which I have had good luck with have brand names like ""Kamui"", ""Ultraskin"", and ""Tiger"". The prices on these tips varies greatly, mainly due to the fact that some of these tips are heavily endorsed by pro players and lots of marketing hype has driven the prices sky-high. You spend a lot for the name, essentially.   Talk about all of these options with your local cuesmith. They will generally ask you what brand you prefer, what hardness level you like, what dome shape you prefer (for example: a ""nickel"" or ""dime"" shaped radius on the dome).  Once they have a budget to work with and they know your basic preferences, they can make some recommendations for a tip that will fit your needs."
billiards,3071w3,ey_bb_wan_sum_fuk,1 point,Wed Mar 25 12:13:23 2015 UTC,Hijacking here to ask a question: What's the main difference between nickel radius and dime radius? Is it just a matter of how much English they impart?
billiards,3071w3,gabrielleigh,4,Wed Mar 25 18:05:09 2015 UTC,"Oh, they do affect the ability of the tip to grip the cueball. I generally like to shape a tip so the center of the dome is 1/8"" higher than the edge of the dome where it meets the sidewall of the tip.   For thicker shafts of 13mm or larger diameter, a nickel radius gets you in that ballpark. For skinny shafts like my 11.4mm playing shaft, the dime radius provides me with enough dome to maintain a lot of surface area contact when applying lots of english to the shot.   A nickel radius on a small shaft ends up being a flatter dome. This is fine for center-ball shots, but when applying several tips of english in any direction (side, draw, follow, etc...), a flatter nickel dome means less tip leather is contacting the cueball compared to a dime-shaped dome. This can contribute to miscuing, in my experience.   The golden rule for everything in pool cues is simply this: ""If the player likes it and plays their best pool with it, then that is the best thing for that player.""  I encourage players to try different things out to see how they feel. In the end, they should trust their gut feeling about what makes them play the best."

Tip replacement isn't too expensive  (25$ at a couple places by me). I've had nice tips last years too (tiger snipers, they are medium hardness)"

billiards,300ult,dbrider,4,Mon Mar 23 16:01:29 2015 UTC,"Good Timez Billiards just opened up and a fair number of pros make their way by there when they are in town. It's pretty well lit, which some people like or don't like.  Pool Sharks, Cue Club, and Mickey's Cues and Brews are other good choices. Gorilla Cafe has pool and carom tables, if you're in to that. Depending on where you come from, some folks get surprised that smoking is allowed all over Vegas, including pool halls, so be forewarned."
billiards,300ult,trickshottim,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:51:12 2015 UTC,"Yup that pool hall is owned and operator by Teddy Garrahan and Gary Onomura. If you want to walk into a pool hall where you'll hear some good stories and even tho it's just opened theres a 95% chance you'll have some pro level player in the building one u may not even know.  It's a bit more of a clean cut billiards hall. Its non smoking, very well lit, all brand new perfectly level'd tables. A pit with tight pockets (one pocket table), also a snooker table in the very back with plenty of private space. Its only a few miles off the strip, if you come to vegas, take a cab, or hit me up and i'll take u in the limo for a good price haha.   The other pool halls are not bad also. Cue Club has history, that's closer to the strip. But they recently cut the pool hall in half, it's got high ceilings but it's embedded smog from just history. You'll find house players in there also that are good. Cue Club used to be one of the main pool halls in town now there's a few since the city is growing so much.  Pool Sharks, Right down china town about 4 miles off the strip. This is a pretty good pool hall. Its large, has about 25 tables, about 6 or 7 being 9 foot diamonds, the rest old beat up brunswicks. This place is famous for action with top pros, they have a nice pit area, with square stadium stadium. I've seen a few matches played here for 5-10k. I've also heard efren and busta went 15hrs straight gambling one pocket. It's got its name carved in with the pros.   Best Billiards, Thats about 7miles east off the strip. Its a nice little pool hall, with a nice espresso bar, italian eatery. Has nice diamonds, and a nice setup. Almost every table (about 10-12 tables, 5 or 6 9 footers, 3 or 4 caroms, 2 7 footers) has a digital scoreboard so you can keep score of 1pocket or straight pool games. I've seen some local big gamblers play here, and they host a couple big tournaments. Bobby Baldwin (google him if you dont know, hes a vegas legend), saw him playing a gentleman 5k a rack for fun.  I almost forgot Mickeys Cues and Brews, this is a quick freeway drive off the strip. Its got plenty of good tables. I dont spend much time here since its farthest away from me. Its a nice pool hall tho, they host weekly tournaments that attract a lot traveling pros also. Its close to the airport so ya.   But again.... my suggestion is Good Timez, its new but it will grow quickly, soon you'll have to wait at the bar for a table, great owners, great atmosphere, clean non smoking, you'll find a money game if you're looking for it, thats for sure."

billiards,300r2h,merryprankster2990,2,Mon Mar 23 16:26:07 2015 UTC,Thanks! I looked up Hawaiian Brians and I really hope that's an hourly rate. If not at $5.25/game guess I'll have to get some 1p action because playing any rotation sets would cost a fortune. Any clue how the action is there? I'm wondering if it's worth packing a cue or just playing off the wall.  Do you know anything about this Velvet Touch place? It looks like another decent option.
billiards,300r2h,merryprankster2990,3,Mon Mar 23 19:37:05 2015 UTC,I've never actually played there but a friend of mine who's played all over the world always talks highly of it though he hasn't been there for a few years.

billiards,300r2h,grlldcheese87,2,Mon Mar 23 20:25:27 2015 UTC,"Hi.  Disclaimer.  I'm drunk.  Brian's is Fine.  I prefer it because booze.  Don't use house cues unless you like rolling a dozen across the table.  5 bucks an hour per person.  That other guys an idiot or a liar or both.  Additionally, Brian's has deals.  Monday flat rate 5 bucks all night.  Tuesday 2bucks an hour.  Wed thurs flat 10 bucks all night.  I think all other days 5/hr/person.  Questionable felt. Great service.  Velvets is way more serious.  No booze.  No talc.  Carom table available.  Crap house cues.  They'll prob stick you on table 6 with ripped felt because you're new.  Money games and serious talent there.  Less friendly but great talent and advice.  Cheaper hourly than Brian's, not sure exactly.  ~3.50/hr.  I'm not great. I play with a 100 dollar cue.  Take my advice with grain of salt.  But 5.25/game is outright false and libellous.  That guys a jerk off.  Stopped lurking and made an account just to defend Brian's prices.  Love you, r/billiards.  P.s. in defense of Velvets lack of booze, great little hipster beer bar next door.  and you sound like you want real tables and maybe action.  So Velvets is probably your spot.  Brian's more about concerts and drinks.  Although for a couple rounds I'd be happy to local escort you to Brian's and see some local music while there.  Brian's a more fun spot all around.  Pm me.  If i remember making this account tomorrow I'll definitely get back to you.  Nothing but love for reddit and pool."

The others in the group aren't pool players and would have more fun at this type of venue.   Velvets is probably where I'll go on a night it's just me and try and maybe find a game. I'm not really much of a drinker these days so the booze stuff doesn't matter but thanks for the tip on the bar next door. What's your favorite place to play on the island? I'm staying on the west side of the island but these places seems like a 30min drive each way which is fine.  Now that you have an account you should post here more. Assuming you remember having an account. Thanks again."
billiards,300r2h,ghostfacekhilla,2,Thu Mar 26 13:34:08 2015 UTC,"I love Brian's.  Tables are good enough for me.  Played there a lot in high school and the New owner/partner used to run my favorite music bar, a small reggae/local music venue.  I thought they both closed.  When they were reincarnated together i got obsessed with the game all over again.  I live a couple blocks from Velvets so i don't know west side too well.  I think aiea cue is the only other pool hall, not 100% certain.  I don't know aiea cue, but I've heard not so nice things about it so i don't bother with the drive.  That's farther west, but still not close to koolina(i assume you're staying somewhere around there).    Hawaii's not great for billiards.  Even the pro shop that used to drill my bowling balls is closing soon.  I'm just happy Brian's was still around when i decided to start shooting again.  I'm sure there are dives with bar boxes on the west side but i don't know enough to recommend anything specific.  I almost feel bad telling you this, but maybe spend your time site seeing around north shore.  Hawaii's got a lot of beautiful destinations, but billiards related spots aren't high on the list.  although in r/billiards, that's like telling you to just take up golf.

Any other places you think are ""can't miss seeing""? Brian's looks like it'll fit nicely into one of the nights. Part of the group will go out drinking and since I normally DD they will happily humor me by going to a place I'll enjoy.   I visit pool halls all around the US and can't pass up adding a few from Hawaii. Thanks for all your help.

billiards,2zzg70,The_shady_burrito,7,Mon Mar 23 05:37:40 2015 UTC,"If what you are asking is: will better balls make my composite slated table bearable? The answer is no. There is only one cure to your dilemma, you know it, and don't want to hear it. But I will confirm your worst fears; you need a different table. One with at least a half inch slate.  As for answering your question directly, very little. The best balls available will still play like shit on any non slate table."
billiards,2zzg70,too_lazy_2_punctuate,3,Mon Mar 23 05:59:46 2015 UTC,Yea slate is important for proper play. You could practice drills on a nonslate table as long as its in good condition. but slate substitutes just aren't heavy enough to stop vibration hard enough to stop flex and smooth enough (over time with wear) to provide a suitable substrate for pool. But a nice set of balls wont hurt and will outlast your table once you convert it to firewood.
billiards,2zzg70,RoadHustler,2,Mon Mar 23 06:44:11 2015 UTC,"But a nice set of balls wont hurt and will outlast your table once you convert it to firewood.   Haha about the firewood. But what RoadHustler says here. I got a really, really nice set of premium balls and two years later, they still look nice as hell. You can really tell the difference in quality of balls when you go to your local bar or even in my case, when I go to the pool halls around here."
billiards,2zzg70,trinatek,2,Mon Mar 23 12:40:07 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with what these guys are saying. I think that the way a table ""feels"" or ""plays"" is based not just on the quality of the individual parts, but how they react and complement with each other as a whole.  A nice set of premium balls will improve certain things, but the table contributes a huge amount to the way things feel when you play, and I would be careful to keep your expectations limited to just aesthetic and consistency improvements in the balls. Like RoadHustler said, a nice set of premium balls is expensive and you will be happy someday to have them already bought and paid for when you upgrade your table. Also, you will have a jump start on being familiar with how the balls play, and that will cut down the time you will need to tune your game on the new table.   No reason in the world to not get them, in my view. Go for it."

billiards,2zyrz5,approx-,1 point,Mon Mar 23 01:33:15 2015 UTC,Well to start the color of the felt is not related to the brand of table you can get the cloth in almost any color on any table. I usually buy Brunswick but Diamond Olhausen or Connolly also make a great table. For your price range used is probably gonna be your best bet.   By the way red cloth is kinda rough on the eyes if you play for long periods. Your eyes will thank you for greens or blues.
billiards,2zyrz5,RoadHustler,1 point,Mon Mar 23 02:45:59 2015 UTC,"Agree with this. At $2500 you can buy a great used table if you look around: Brunswick GC and Diamond tables seem to hold their value the best.  And yeah, unless you're deadset on red, I'd go with standard green or tournament blue felt. Will be much easier on the eyes and probably easier to resell if you are so inclined"
billiards,2zyrz5,BlackLabLover,1 point,Tue Mar 24 05:10:55 2015 UTC,"The three dominant manufacturers are Brunswick, Diamond, and Valley (in no particular order).

Whatever the reason, I say you play by your league operator's rules or don't play in that league.    Save the one-handed pool for proposition bets with suckers if you do it that well."
billiards,3008wd,JMizzo,3,Mon Mar 23 19:33:12 2015 UTC,"Would you carry a chair around the table and sit in it and shoot pool? There isn't a rule against that.   Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Is there a physical limitation that makes you break in that way? Would you be ok with being held responsible for any damages? Is the complaint from the players or establishment? Are you using a bridge to break? Lastly, why would you break that way when there is no benefit, only negatives.  This became an AMA way to quick."

billiards,2zsp5s,gabrielleigh,3,Sat Mar 21 12:14:44 2015 UTC,"I have been pretty impressed with the McDermott ""Star"" line of cues. I have had a few come through the shop for tips and other maintenance, and the economical line of cues from McDermott seem to have most of the features I really like from their more expensive lines. The only beef I have seen with the McDermotts lately is the poor installation job of their linen wraps. They use a good quality linen, but the installation method is incorrect and the wraps will work loose and begin to unravel.   They make a really slick looking wrapless model called the Star S1 which is a slightly fancy ""sneaky pete"" for around $109.00  http://www.mcdermottcue.com/s1.php  This cue has some pretty woods, a classic design, and it features the 3/8"" x 10 big pin and a true wood-to-wood joint that I think provides a superior feel and hit compared to joints like the small pin 5/16"" variants with a brass shaft insert.   For an entry level production cue, this one looks hard to beat and has a nice low price. Also, McD guarantees their cues for life, so if you keep all your paperwork and register the cue online you should have no problem getting anything fixed that is considered a manufacturing defect or flaw, which is pretty rare in most cases."

No offense, but $120 probably isn't going to buy a great cue. But having the same cue to play with everyday (and in good condition) will improve your game a whole lot. Especially if you've been playing with house cues.  So don't get too caught up in which cue you buy. Just get something decent in your budget and play as much as possible with it. =)"

There are plenty of quality cues from production makers such as McDermott, Cuetec, Viking, Lucasi, Joss, etc. etc. etc. that fall under that price point.  I have a Joss and a Schon.  I love both cues and they both have a very similar hit and feel.  The Joss is far less expensive though.

billiards,2zqyo0,BryanH912,6,Fri Mar 20 22:22:55 2015 UTC,"Stroke is the most important element in the game. It'll take you years of practice to consistently be able to hit center ball at any speeds. With that said, get a beer bottle, place it on a table, get a cheap stick from big five or something, and practice your stroke for hours."
billiards,2zqyo0,Derpin_Around,5,Fri Mar 20 23:39:11 2015 UTC,"Absolutely this.  Your stoke and form are the building blocks for everything else.    As you shoot you will develop an ""eye"" for the shot.  You see where you need to aim to make the shot happen and you just do it.  That can't happen if you can't consistently hit the cue ball at level center.  You can learn to shoot with bad form but your shots will never be consistent.    The bottle drill enforces a clean stroke and a level stance as the goal is to stroke without touching glass.    After the bottle drill, it's a good idea to shoot the cue ball, from the spot, to the middle diamond on the head rail.  Leave your cue extended after contact.  The goal is to bring the cue ball back to your tip.    I do a variant of the spot drill as part of my warm up every time.  It deals with speed control as well.  I move my cue and try to stop on the spot after head and foot rail contact.    Get good at these and you can graduate to flat draw and follow."
billiards,2zqyo0,Appetite_TDE,2,Sat Mar 21 02:47:30 2015 UTC,"Grab a cue and an empty bottle and simply practice your cueing by cueing through the opening of the bottle. It's suppose to help you get accustomed to cue in a straight line. Since you're only limited to one opening per bottle at an nonadjustable height, I would recommend getting a couple other bottles with a different base diameter so you could practice cueing on other parts of the theoretical cue ball.   Once you're cueing decently, you can begin doing the drill Appetite mentioned as well. The drill he mentioned is crucial too because it gives lots of feedback on how good you're cueing."
billiards,2zqyo0,Derpin_Around,3,Fri Mar 27 14:17:47 2015 UTC,"Throw out some balls, take ball in hand and then try to make them all in in consecutive order. Best drill. For learning english set up the same shot over and over hitting the que ball in different spots (think of the que ball as a clock face) with variations on how hard you hit it. Pay attention to the way the que ball rolls. Do this for hours and hours and hours."
billiards,2zqyo0,merryprankster2990,2,Fri Mar 27 18:21:41 2015 UTC,"Set up like balls 1 through 6, make them in consecutive order allowing yourself 3 missed shots, if you miss 3 times set I'm back up again. When you get comfortable with that give yourself 2 missed and then 1 missed. When you can run out 6 balls fairly often, add more balls to the table. This is specifically what I did when I started playing. This isn't going to make you good at playing other people because you're not breaking, there's no pressure and there's no defense but it will provide you with skills necessary to start playing others."
billiards,2zqyo0,merryprankster2990,2,Fri Mar 20 23:22:30 2015 UTC,Oh and get yourself a que too. Doesn't have to be expensive just something straight that'll give you some consistency. hope all that helps
billiards,2zqyo0,merryprankster2990,2,Fri Mar 20 23:30:49 2015 UTC,"If you're new to the game, the best ""drill"" is to simply play more.

billiards,2zqyo0,redditor1983,1 point,Fri Mar 20 23:34:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with this statement but you can also do just really simple drills, like nothing fancy at all. as an example practice striking a ball with the cue ball that allows the cue ball to come off at an angle go three rails around the table and then stop as close to the center of the table as you can get it, and do that like a million times. cue ball control drills are the most important imo, like getting the feel for the speed of the shot and where you want to leave it, and control/consistency is one of the main things that really separates the pros from the amateurs."
billiards,2zqyo0,s0und0fyell0w,1 point,Fri Mar 20 23:19:24 2015 UTC,Take a striped ball and line the stripe up straight ahead- hit the ball from one end of the table right over the spot straight across to the middle of the foot and try to get the cue ball to come straight back to your stick. Stay down on it and try to hit the end of your cue tup. Keep doing it until you hit the ball straight and dead center every shot. You'll be able to see I intended spin if you use a stripe.

If you want to get good quickly, you need to understand the physics of the game, and you need to do some basic drills to learn how to apply those physics. And learn some strategies to run the table.  I spent a decade just playing, but I became twice the player I was after I read this book (non-ref link) and worked through its recommendations. You can get it for a few bucks used.

Repeat with the cue ball at 2 diamonds away, 3 diamonds, etc. Video yourself if you can.  You can really expose weaknesses in your stroke and if you can hit 80%+ with the cue ball 3 diamonds or farther away (especially on 9' tables), then your stroke is probably pretty straight and dialed in.   I do this 2-3x a week and it was really frustrating at first how steep my % dropped with the cue ball at 3 diamonds or more away. But it  helped expose flaws in my stroke and correct them."

billiards,2zq4yy,RoadHustler,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:25:35 2015 UTC,Yea the thing is WPA rules dont require that any particular person rack and they also dont require that the rack be straight. They only say that the 1 ball has to be on the spot and that it cant be racked with purposeful or intentional patern.   Because of this its not a violation of the rules to tilt the rack. Although I agree it should be a violation of the rules and I think it should be required that tables have the center string marked so that rack straightness becomes readily visible at the back end of the rack.  You cant really expect people to follow rules that arent rules.

This could be a good drill.  http://www.billiardsdigest.com/showdrill.php?id=60  You could do this sort of drill with any shot you feel you need to practice as well, progressively moving the cue ball to a further away/more difficult location after every make, and moving the cue ball closer after every miss.  You might want to try it with straight in shots while at the same time, trying to make the cue ball stop."

There's also a super simple drill in the video to straighten your stroke. It's so simple it may seem pointless but I think it's great to do now and build strong fundamentals and stroke mechanics instead of trying to fix problems later on. I feel like I should almost be on the zero-x pay roll having plugged it a few times, but imo it's a great resource and it's on YouTube for free so it deserves props. Apart from that, when I started learning cue ball control I would setup a simple shot, Mark the cue ball and object ball position, and just do the exact same shot with the different types of cue ball spin. Then I made a little paper circle and moved it to different spots and try to land the cue ball in it."
billiards,2znhof,mattdebrown,1 point,Tue Mar 24 23:32:50 2015 UTC,"each drill teaches you something different, so pick one that really addresses what you want to improve on. drills are great because they require a lot of focus, and really get you into stroke quicker.  i also think that for a beginner they make you improve at a faster rate because they reinforce certain concepts. when i do drills it takes me a few tries to really figure out the drill, some are easier and some are more difficult. if i goof up and get a rattle i usually continue with the drill, especially if its a drill that involves running balls.  the one that i really like and helped me improve a lot is to: form a line of about 5 balls off the rail just behind the side pocket, and shoot them each into the corner pocket. like this video at 25:00 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSihPJeYqHY except i put the line behind the side pocket because there is more distance which makes the drill harder. ^ this drill really helped me a lot. it teaches you a lot about different strokes, speed control, and cue ball control. i think its probably the most important drill ive learned.  this is another good one that is pretty basic but critical- form a circle with 15 balls in the center of the table and try to run them out while keeping the cue ball in the circle. this is a good one that teaches you how to stop, stun, jack up over a ball, and shot selection in the stack."

billiards,2zknxm,gotwired,1 point,Fri Mar 20 01:53:04 2015 UTC,I watched the guy play recently he must be in his 60's at this point but he was playing 9 ball and he didn't miss a ball that could see a pocket in 11 racks he broke and ran 6 racks with ease. People started telling stories of him in his hay day just wondered if anyone had heard of him
billiards,2zknxm,slorebear,0,Fri Mar 20 16:11:01 2015 UTC,he was a good player from Wichita from the 70s.   not really known as some unbeatable hustler i dont think

billiards,2zkdty,vicgina,3,Thu Mar 19 08:22:23 2015 UTC,"Being that you have a very nice cue, I'd be tempted to work up a short list of specifications you want in a shaft and check with your local custom cue maker to have a shaft built to spec and fitted to your butt.   Not sure what area of the country you live in, but I have a lot of contacts around the world and I might be able to steer you to someone who can help you out.   You could tie up a small pile of cash in buying an aftermarket shaft and having it matched up and fitted to your Helmstetter. You will end up settling for whatever specs you can find that are available in aftermarket options, or you could have one built exactly how you want it by a custom builder. Depending on who you have do the work, you could save some money and end up with something that is exactly what you want for your carom setup.   Holler at me if you would like some help tracking down a local custom builder, I'll send out my pigeons and see if I can find you a reputable local builder."
billiards,2zkdty,gabrielleigh,1 point,Thu Mar 19 15:50:43 2015 UTC,"The idea of a custom shaft is appealing, the one issue I might have is that I haven't really played enough carom to know what specs to request from a custom cue maker.  My plan for today was to drive around to different shops and try a few cues out so I could say make me something like this.  However, four ball and 3c don't seem to be that popular in Denver and I couldn't find a shop that had a single carom cue in stock.  I did speak to one local custom maker today, but he only creates shafts with his custom designed taper and it isn't really appropriate for the games I play.    So if you could point me in the direction of someone in Colorado who could make a relatively vanilla carom shaft in either 5/16x14 or 5/16x18 I would really appreciate it."
billiards,2zkdty,SirNoobs,1 point,Fri Mar 20 01:35:50 2015 UTC,Carom cues usually have a smaller tip and stiffer hit compared to pool cues. The carom balls are bigger and heavier and you might want something that can cut through the cue ball and not feel whippy. Try looking into a smaller tip shaft with a conical taper like the OB Pro if you can your hands on one.
billiards,2zkdty,gabrielleigh,1 point,Fri Mar 20 04:19:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I struck out on finding a local Colorado carom shaft maker, but I found two names of good carom shaft makers in the US who might be able to help you.   Noel Mendoza out of Chicago was recommended: https://www.facebook.com/noel.mendoza.106  There is a carom shaft builder in Wisconsin as well. His name is Mike O' Neill.  I don't know either of these guys, but they were the only names I got when I asked around.   Good luck"
billiards,2zkdty,gotwired,2,Fri Mar 20 15:21:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can. I am not sure what joint Helmstetters use, but popular brands like Predator make shafts for all commonly used joints and blanks that can be fitted to less common joint types. Predator has a carom shaft that you can find at online retailers like Seyberts or Pool Dawg.  You can also go the custom route and just find a cue maker to build you a shaft."
billiards,2zkdty,SirNoobs,2,Thu Mar 19 08:42:58 2015 UTC,"This is actually a good question. From my experience, if the pin types match, the aftermarket shaft will fit the butt. However, there are some rarer cases where the two will fit but the edges won't be flush because some manufacturers or cue makers use different joint diameters even though it's the same pin, so you'll maybe see some overhang.   One guy at my pool hall shoots with only 5/16x14. He has a Tim Scruggs butt and interchanges with different custom cue maker's shafts haha. I suggest maybe trying Seyberts. They have a good return policy and let you return items that you don't work out for you."
billiards,2zjkhk,schiffty1,1 point,Thu Mar 19 02:30:08 2015 UTC,Each half has Sampaio and Made In Portugal Stamped faintly under the lacquer.
billiards,2zjkhk,gabrielleigh,1 point,Thu Mar 19 02:43:04 2015 UTC,"An interesting cue, for sure. I have heard of Sampaio, but never seen one in person.   I did a quick google search for them, and found an old AZB post from 2009 of a similar cue which was offered for $300.   http://forums.azbilliards.com/showthread.php?t=151323  The post refers to some Blue Book numbers that are much higher for cues in mint condition, though. The AZB cue had a cracked buttcap ring, and I noticed your cue has a dark wooden buttcap now, is it possible this is the same cue?"
billiards,2zjezw,Lxrge,3,Thu Mar 19 01:43:52 2015 UTC,"Schons are fine cues.  Personally I'm a big fan of wood to wood joints.  Like your Dale Perry or McDermott were.  Dale Perry uses a radial pin, which is my favorite.  Though I've heard his aren't as well made as some of the nicer custom cues that use radial pins.    If you are willing to spend the 400+ to get a Schon, I would look into custom cues.  The big thing for me is getting a perfect balance point.  If you can find one that matches the pendulum of your swing I think it elevates the playability considerable.  Maybe Gabriel can give you a page on qualities to look for.    For me it's:   Wood to Wood (radial) Balance Point Solid hit with a hollow sound (I key off of sound as my focus point) I like a nice leather wrap   My Samsara plays great and has all of my favorite qualities in a cue.  I also am a big fan of the Z2 shaft, but that (low deflection) has a huge spectrum of personal preference there."
billiards,2zjezw,Pip_Pip,1 point,Thu Mar 19 03:55:55 2015 UTC,I agree with this.  I owned a Schon in the past and traded it off as I hated the feel of the metal joint. It seemed to take a lot of feel out of the front of the cue.  I do prefer a tight grained HR maple shaft over an LD though.
billiards,2zjezw,fadedcheese,1 point,Thu Mar 19 04:06:24 2015 UTC,It's so hard to find a cue Maker that can make my specifications around the 4-500 range.
billiards,2zjezw,Pip_Pip,2,Thu Mar 19 04:33:19 2015 UTC,Not to say have it made but preowned  edit: A good course of action might be to list off your specifications and someone can point you to a maker that might fit.  Then you could find one to try (or maybe someone can help you here to find one).  If it's what you are looking for you can start the hunt to find your unicorn.
billiards,2zjezw,Pilfered,1 point,Thu Mar 19 04:56:13 2015 UTC,"I went over to Ozone Billiards today, I shot with Schon want a big fan too stiff of a hit for me I decided on an OB with a OB-2+ matching shaft so far I love it.   It's thin like a Meucci, wood to wood, joint and just hits so nice!"
billiards,2zjezw,JMizzo,2,Sat Mar 21 02:21:37 2015 UTC,"I have a Schon and love it.  I also have a Joss and they play very similarly, although the Schon has a thinner butt/handle and a balance point that is slightly more forward, which I prefer.  I'm a big fan of stainless steel joints and the 5/16"" x 14 thread.  It's going to be a personal thing though.  The best thing you could do is fine somebody who owns one and will let you hit some balls with it.  Schons have a very consistent hit from cue to cue so if you like the feel of one, you'll most likely like the feel of 99% of them."
billiards,2zjezw,SeabrookMiglla,1 point,Thu Mar 19 12:18:55 2015 UTC,"I went from a players HXT to a Schon and love it. Solid hit, love the way it feels when I'm really trying to do something with the ball. The quality of construction is great, hold it next to a McDermott or Joss and I think the Schon just shines.   I have a custom coming in a couple weeks, but I'm sure I'll still be shooting with the schon afterward."

billiards,2zfm4g,sphigel,6,Wed Mar 18 15:57:13 2015 UTC,What I love about this shot is how quickly he recognizes that there are not other good options for making the ball.  He just takes a few seconds to think about it and then plays it off the point like it's nothing.

I think if Earl could have maintained this level of sportsmanship throughout the rest of his career, he would have been remembered as one of the gods of the game. When I see footage of him like this, it just makes me facepalm at the way he behaves now. He had an amazing gift for pool, which few people could argue with, and the potential to be a true ambassador of the game even after his game began the normal downhill slide due to aging.   But.... no.  Now it seems most clips I watch of his recent play are filled with complaints, flamboyant arrogance, and trash talk. I see consistent disrespect for his opponent, his audience, and the game in general. That is too bad, because he really had a good thing going as evidenced by this old footage.   Efren's shot was awesome, of course, but the thing that caught my eye was the stark difference in personality between this Earl and the Earl of recent years."
billiards,2zfm4g,skike,5,Wed Mar 18 21:49:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it's not like he was Mr. Nice back then either.  Hell, even the commentators were commenting on his uncharacteristic jovial attitude.

billiards,2zfs3a,razorpool,2,Wed Mar 18 05:10:21 2015 UTC,"Just some hints  -Stroke speed doesn't affect squirt, only swerve.   -The cut angle affects throw, often times more than spin.  -Elevation of the cue is also a factor that you should work in there somehow as hitting the same spot on the cue ball at different vectors can have much different results, especially when the cue ball gets airborne."
billiards,2zfs3a,gotwired,1 point,Wed Mar 18 10:10:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the hints. Stroke speed definitely affects squirt - http://billiards.colostate.edu/threads/squirt.html#speed You're right about the cut angle and throw, I might have to add that label. Yes, cue elevation is an additional variable - in fact there are many other variables that could be added to the diagram to make it even more complex! E.g cleanliness of the balls, the type of tip and shaft, etc. It might be difficult to make a comprehensive diagram, but could be an interesting exercise."
billiards,2zfs3a,sphigel,1 point,Wed Mar 18 15:37:26 2015 UTC,Stroke speed definitely affects squirt   Nothing on the website that you linked to supports your argument that stroke speed affects squirt.  According to that site stroke speed affects the effective squirt or net squirt.  The net squirt is the difference between the squirt and swerve on a given shot.  A slower stroke allows more time for the cue ball to swerve back towards a straight line path.  The ball still squirted just as much with a slow stroke as a fast stroke.  There's just more time for swerve to take effect with a slow stroke.
billiards,2zfs3a,gotwired,1 point,Wed Mar 18 16:11:05 2015 UTC,"You are right, I completely misread that article. Thanks"
billiards,2zfs3a,mkglass,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:22:28 2015 UTC,"""Cue ball deflection"" or ""squirt"" refers to the angular deflection of the CB immediately off the tip. Squirt does not vary with speed. Proof, from careful experiments with cue-testing robots, can be found here:   You can't actually change the cleanliness of the balls or your shaft or tip for any given shot, well I guess you could, but it is not normally done."
billiards,2zfs3a,I_Am_The_Mole,2,Thu Mar 19 00:59:03 2015 UTC,"It's a good start... Might I offer a couple of suggestions?   Add every factor you can think of that can affect the shot (cloth speed, butt elevation, etc) Add a legend explaining some things.  Sometimes you use a solid arrow, sometimes a dotted line, and different colors -- what do they all mean?"
billiards,2zfs3a,mkglass,1 point,Thu Mar 19 16:53:00 2015 UTC,"Good suggestions. The colors are just for aesthetic purposes to make distinctions, but I think the solid vs dashed lines could use some explaining."

billiards,2zfs3a,mkglass,2,Wed Mar 18 21:17:14 2015 UTC,"LOL I know you're joking, but...  There is a difference between overthinking and understanding.  It's important that you understand as many of the factors affecting your shot as you can.  However, when you are actually down on your shot, you should not be thinking about any of this.    Think of it like going to school to become a doctor... you have to spend a lot of time learning and understanding and testing that knowledge.  But once you're at the operating table, you shouldn't be thinking about all of that -- just get in there and do your job."

billiards,2ze1te,BilliardsProfessor,2,Tue Mar 17 20:24:19 2015 UTC,"One suggestion I might make is to develop some cheap sets of cues from a few different manufacturers, each set having four similar cues models that are configured differently so that students can try out different versions of the same basic stick.   For example, have four basic entry-level Players cue butts of the same model number, but order them with different weights. Then you can just order additional shafts and have the shafts set up in a variety of ways to interchange onto the cheap butts. Have a few 13mm standard shafts, have some ""pro"" style shafts with thinner tapers. Set a few up with hard tips, medium tips, and soft tips. This way you can just change shafts in a few seconds, and the student can instantly feel the difference in equipment.   If you end up trying to compare two or more cues of different manufacturers, it is hard to really isolate what contributes to the difference in feel because so many things are different between the cues you are comparing. If you keep all other things equal, then the student may have an easier time feeling changes that are limited to just a few characteristics in the cues.  Just an idea, I'd love to hear more about what you come up with and how the students respond."
billiards,2ze1te,gabrielleigh,2,Wed Mar 18 16:09:17 2015 UTC,"Not a bad idea... Most of my students are beginners, so they probably won't really know the difference between a Player's and a higher quality. Would be a good way to compare some basic cue parameters..."

I'll upvote and hopefully someone will answer better.  In all seriousness, it looks like it's in great shape and I would love to have one like it.  Is it a pro-table? I don't know, but it is certainly not trash IMO.  It looks like it has a ball return system, as long as it's not clogged up and they roll back,  it doesn't look like it's dinged up or chipped anywhere and the felt looks tight.  That's about all I know to look for.  Roll a ball from one end to the other and see how well it bounces.  Try to get it straight on and straight back.  If you can get good even banks, it's playable for sure."
billiards,2zb12z,BlazzedTroll,2,Tue Mar 17 17:56:17 2015 UTC,"From the picture you took it looks like it's in pretty decent condition.  Here are a couple of things to check to see if it's worth something:   Rails are firm and not detached anywhere Cloth has no stains or tears/rips Pockets are attached totally Slate is not cracked (it may be multiple pieces, in which case you might be able to detect where the pieces are separate)   It's not important if it's level since that can be fixed quite easily. The quality of the felt isn't too important either since that's an inexpensive fix if the buyer cares about it."

Can anyone tell me from this admittedly bad pic if this is a good table or a junk table. Apparently it is a Brunswick. It is at least 35 to 40 years old. Not sure whether it's worth trying to sell or to just trash it. I could drive back up (45 minutes) and take more pictures if needed.
billiards,2zb12z,gotwired,2,Tue Mar 17 02:17:24 2015 UTC,"Do not trash it! It looks like a good table.  Worth probably well over $1000.  I'm not sure what the model is, but definitely try to find out and look up value."
billiards,2zb12z,total_looser,1 point,Tue Mar 17 19:09:42 2015 UTC,"The good news is Brunswicks are very good tables.  As /u/bclan11 mentioned you're probably looking at a value of at least $1000.  The bad news?  Pool tables can be a slow market so it could take a while to find a buyer at it's full value.  It sounds like you don't have a long time frame, so it might be best to hit up any local pool halls and see if they know of anyone interested i purchasing it.  Hopefully someone with more knowledge can ID the particular model and help you zero in on a more precise valuation.  It would definitely be worth taking more pics next time you're in the area."

Shooting order is redrawn every hour. $50 entry fee gets you fifty poker chips. Payout on the 5 and 10 balls, payout is raised every hour with the shooting order changeup.   I think this tournament was probably worth about $700 or so with the calcutta, and we are having a nasty invitation-only Ultimate Ring Game next month. This was pretty much the ""warm up"" for the one next month, and I think I learned a little bit about the value of pacing myself throughout the day. I practiced for several hours before the tournament began, and I think I spent a bit too much time on my feet that day. I felt good until about the last two or three hours. I think I wore myself out, but it was a good time and feel like I know what my limits are. Looks like about ten hours of continuous play is about all I can do, so I'll have to rest up and plan my big tournament next month with this info in the back of my mind.   Sighs."

Yesterday I was playing and I realized that from the set position (cue right near the cue ball), my practice strokes were kind of yanking the cue backward as opposed to pulling it backward.  I think in my head is that it kind of played like this: Let's say the moment the cue hits the cue ball is position 0.  I feel like I was mentally making sure my stroke was good from -20 (all the way cocked back) to 0 and that was it.  Now I've started to try and focus on -10 to +10.  Does that make sense?  I may have shortened my backswing, but I feel like I approach going through the shot better.    Any tips?"

And there's no more important skill...any Polack can hit a ball in the pocket but you have to set up the next shot if you want to win!  So if you can't stand the game... play it anyway! Once you get a bit of skill at this game, all kinds of improbable shots in real pool become very makeable shots, e.g. breakouts and caroms and threading the cue through traffic and easily making ""scratch"" shots.  I used to have a couple of league teams and I made them play it all the time. They hated it but we always finished first or second place, even with players who were very green at the beginning of the season. It was hilarious to hear an opponent call ""scratch"" trying to psych out my 2-month player and they nail the shot and miss the pocket by two inches."

Practicing other games, the (newb's) focus is on the object ball and the cue ball control usually doesn't get the attention it deserves, no matter how much you remind them of its importance.

billiards,2yydtm,mattdebrown,6,Fri Mar 13 21:36:32 2015 UTC,"Heya! This happens to be one of my specialties in the world of pool cues, pool playing, and other related areas.  From my experience, there are three big factors that influence how easy a jump shot can be executed. The single biggest factor is proper technique, in my opinion. A very close second place is using an appropriate cue for the jump shot. Lastly, the type of table bed (slate or otherwise) has a large impact on how easy it is to make the cueball jump.   As far as technique goes, you seem to have a good grasp of the fundamentals of shooting a legal jump shot. Customarily, a roughly 45 degree angle is used for most jump shots. You can get by with a shallower angle if your obstructing ball is farther away and you use more power in the jump stroke to get your distance. For extremely close jumps where the obstructing ball is very close to the cueball, you may need to increase your cue angle to a much higher degree to clear the obstructing ball. For most jump shots, especially when you are first learning to jump, you should aim for the core of the cueball. It is generally much harder to achieve a jump when you aim at a spot that is above the core of the ball because the cueball will often strike the tip after it bounces up off the slate and is on its way up. With practice, you can eventually learn to use low english to stop the cueball after a jump shot. Running english can also be effective with a little practice. I generally try to hold the cue as lightly as possible so that the cue tip can bounce off the cueball after it strikes it.   Having an actual jump cue will also go a long way to improving your success with the jump shot. Generally speaking, jump cues can be of any length and configuration. They tend to be much lighter than regular playing cues (9 to 13 ounces total weight) in many cases. One important characteristic of jump cues is they tend to have extremely hard tips and stiff shafts with robust tapers. This ""rigidity"" of a jump cue helps transfer a very quick shock of energy to the cueball which makes it bounce off the slate much more than conventional shafts with medium or soft tips. The more brittle the cue, the easier it is to jump with. A whippy or soft-hitting cue will bend and absorb the energy of the impact and create less of a jump. Depending on your personal preferences, you may find shooting some jump shots is easier with a shorter cue, too. Many people prefer jump cues that are 40-45 inches in length. The shortness of the cue serves to reduce the overall weight of the cue, and it also tends to shift the balance point more forward to allow the shaft to settle into your bridge hand easier. When the cue is elevated to the jump shot position, the center of gravity of a jump cue is much lower than a regular shooting cue. The closer you can get the center of gravity to the cueball, the easier it is to jump.   Finally, the table you attempt the jump shot on will have a fairly large impact on how easily the cueball jumps. Unfortunately, many cheaper tables are more difficult to jump on because the playing surface is often not as hard and dense as the thick slate tables that cost much more. Tables with composite surfaces, MDF, and other non-slate materials are just plain harder to jump on. The choice of cloth on a table also impacts how easy it is to jump. Cheaper ""fuzzy"" cloths soak up valuable energy from the cueball, and it takes more strength to achieve the same height in the jump compared to jumping on the better worsted wool cloths like Simonis.   Jumping on a Simonis-covered Brunswick with a thick slate bed is relatively easy. Jumping on a cheap wooden recreational table with garbage cloth can be almost impossible at times.   So with the appropriate technique, a focused and sharp stroke, a cue with characteristics that favor jump shots, and the ideal table... jumping can be so easy that it takes virtually no effort or concentration to successfully jump the ball."
billiards,2yydtm,gabrielleigh,2,Fri Mar 13 23:56:19 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for all the amazing info. Glad to hear my mdf table/crappy cloth/cheap cue could be stifling. It was great learning to slide and spin the cue ball on this weak gear because when I got to the pool hall it was so buttery once I adjusted. Sort of like training with a weight vest. Looks like it might be smart to just put off training the jump shot until I have access to better gear. Thanks again for the wealth of info. This sub is certainly a great resource"
billiards,2yydtm,gabrielleigh,2,Sat Mar 14 02:54:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you learn to jump in those conditions, you'll be earning frequent flyer miles at the pool room on the good tables."
billiards,2yydtm,rocksauce,2,Sat Mar 14 03:09:52 2015 UTC,"Once you are jacked up you will hit higher up on the cue ball than you think. Try just one tip width higher. Then commit. It's not a gentle shot. It has to have something behind it and it needs to be a good stroke. Jump shots are really fun as are massés, but a kick shot off one plus cushions is a way more useful skill to have.   Having a jump cue helps immensely. I can jump pretty well, but with my medium tipped play cue it is near impossible. I actually got a 10$ jump cue off the bargain rack at my local shop and it works well enough for the dicking around I use it for."
billiards,2yydtm,ChasinClouds,1 point,Fri Mar 13 22:41:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips, though it sounds like it might be a bit futile with my cheap wood table. Will definitely look into a jump cue but your comment about kicking stands out to me.  Might have to invest the bit of dough to get the zero-x kicking video.  The free zero-x video was the most useful video I found as a beginner. And kicking is so beast mode. Not as flashy as the jump or masse but after seeing efren pull out his magicians hat on these you tube clips, that seems like a good path to follow hehe"

All that being said, I only have to use a half masse when I fuck up getting position. It is not a shot to rely on, but it's a good tool to have in the bag."

billiards,2yukhg,tent405,6,Thu Mar 12 23:12:01 2015 UTC,It was a demonstration of Russian values were seeping slowly into the American lifestyle through subversive Russian propaganda. People unknowingly playing Russian Billiards in their bars is a brilliant and subtle way of showing that side plot.
billiards,2yukhg,txcomet,1 point,Fri Mar 13 07:00:30 2015 UTC,"To be fair, at my pool hall, on any given night you can see ""extras""/kids  shooting object balls like that. They could be playing Irish,Polish,KY, carom pool. At least I tell myself that to sleep ok at night..."
billiards,2yukhg,fadedcheese,1 point,Fri Mar 13 14:36:08 2015 UTC,"Well it's not KY and not carom 8. Notice the position of the 4-ball. It stays exactly the same in between the shots of the scene: they are still playing the same rack. However, the dude switches up on which balls he's shooting.  Carom 8 is a very fun game. I've never played KY - found the rules here and it doesn't look appealing to me.  Do you have links to the Irish and Polish games? I've never heard of those."
billiards,2yukhg,tent405,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:23:19 2015 UTC,I was just referring to a common game called by many names depending on where you are. Basically you shoot object balls into the cue ball and try and carom the ball into the pocket. You can chose any object ball unless you are playing it in like a rotation format. It can have a wide variety of rules. It's just a fun game to change things up although it will help you learn caroms.

billiards,2ytpg1,Jiveturtle,3,Thu Mar 12 19:01:56 2015 UTC,"Well, the 8 ball is an important ball, isn't it? You make that ball, and you win the game. And that's one step closer to winning your match. And that one match is a step closer to making the playoffs.  But you can't just shoot the 8 ball on your first shot at the table, right? There's a handful of balls that you have to make before you can shoot the eight. And each of those shots in between you and the eight deserves your full attention and commitment.  It's easy for our minds to get ahead of our actions in pool. Sometimes when you're running out, you'll be mentally shooting the 8 ball, imagining the pats on the back from your teammates, shaking your opponent's hand. Next thing you know, you missed the shot that was right in front of you the whole time, maybe three or four balls away from shooting the eight.  Of course, you should always plan your shots and your runs ahead, but once you have that plan, execute it step by step, shot by shot. Commit to your plan, and keep the what-ifs and hypotheticals out of your mind."
billiards,2ytpg1,Bwtadpole,1 point,Thu Mar 12 20:57:43 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the advice, thanks.  Maybe I need to just concentrate on what's in front of me... I've already made my plan, so I just need to execute it."
billiards,2ytpg1,Bwtadpole,1 point,Thu Mar 12 21:26:18 2015 UTC,"I think that might help. If you catch your mind wandering, don't be afraid to get up off the shot, take a step back, re-focus, and get back down. Don't accept anything less than your best effort!"
billiards,2ytpg1,jgc121,2,Thu Mar 12 21:57:37 2015 UTC,"Practice.. set up the shots you're consistently missing, and shoot that shot a hundred times or so... It's partly in your head as well. As for drinking - if you're taking your game seriously - don't drink. Just my opinion though, I drink when playing, but I know I'll miss some shots I shouldn't.."
billiards,2ytpg1,jgc121,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:59:00 2015 UTC,"I was mostly joking about the drinking.  Although it might steady my nerves, to be honest.  I'm not talking about tough shots or odd shots here.  These are shots I know, ones I've taken hundreds of times already and that I'll never miss except when it matters.  I'm starting to think it's just in my head and I need to go do drills for a couple hours."
billiards,2ytpg1,adityars,1 point,Thu Mar 12 21:28:28 2015 UTC,"I understand, I wasn't suggesting doing that drill setup because you can't make the shot. Rather because it helps muscle memory and being able to calculate the shot in your head without thinking about it. It helps me when I'm in your situation. Was only a friendly suggestion :-)"
billiards,2ytpg1,jeagle64,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:01:53 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I think you're actually right about it and that's definitely what I'm going to do - make a note of what easy shots I miss (and the situation where I miss them) and then come back and practice them.
billiards,2ytpg1,adequatepipe,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:12:38 2015 UTC,"A lot of it depends on whether or not you play/feel slightly different during league games instead of practice games, and find it is a mental thing. I wrote about this ages ago Playing under pressure – Using your emotions to get more focus. Since you can run tables, and it's not lack of aiming/stroke, I'm guessing this is more of a mental issue.  Like /r/Bwtadapole said, it is also about making the plan and then playing one shot at a time.  I used to have this problem ages ago but seem to have it only on rare occasions now... Even when I do notice adrenaline/stress building up, I am now days consciously aware of it, so I can take a step back, take a deep breath to steady myself, and then get back to address the ball."
billiards,2ytpg1,megapantsparty,1 point,Fri Mar 13 02:32:59 2015 UTC,Establish a consistent pre shot routine.(Treat every ball equally)  Designate a key ball and plan your pattern and stick to it as best you can.( I like to leave a easy shot up table or a hanger for insurance if I get outta line)  Most of all realize that the 8/9 ball your shooting isn't the last ball of your pool career. Treat it like any other ball and fire it in. Look at it not as the last ball but the first step to the next rack. And quit panicking.lol

billiards,2ytitu,megapantsparty,2,Thu Mar 12 21:51:26 2015 UTC,"OK here we go,  I play on 7ft diamonds, and 9ft gaberials.  I only really play 8 ball on the 7fts. For the 9's I play 9 ball, straight pool, American rotation, rarely one pocket, and my favorite 10 ball. For all breaks, I'm on the head string. On 8 ball, and American Rotation I'm in the center. I use to smash the shit out of so I could get the cueball to jump. Once I started getting that to happen, I started to just get it to fly off the table. Vary rarely getting it to jump strait up and down. Was told by multiple people just to slow down my final back stroke, and not as hard. Now I can get it to pop and stay on the table.    With 10 ball I shoot in the break box but one Dimond away from center either way.   9 ball I'm near the rail on either side. Just far enough away so I can use the whole cue ball.  I use the same speed /technique for all of those.  10 ball's the only one I rarely make a ball on most of of the time."
billiards,2ytitu,total_looser,2,Thu Mar 12 18:44:04 2015 UTC,"i dunno, at the higher levels it seems to be about control - cue ball center table off break. if the cue ball is outside the box described by the two off center diamonds on the long and short rails, you're getting too much action. popping ball decreases those odds. it gets you laid though :)"
billiards,2ytitu,asamimasa,1 point,Fri Mar 13 05:07:08 2015 UTC,Interesting.  Why is it necessarily a good thing to have the cue ball pop? Just do you know your getting good power? Personally on done tables I find a medium too hard break better for pocketing balls than all out thunder break
billiards,2ytitu,launch_from_my_pad,2,Thu Mar 12 21:44:43 2015 UTC,It's to let off some of the spin that may be present on the ball so it's less likely to catch once it settles down on a spot.
billiards,2ytitu,megapantsparty,1 point,Fri Mar 13 06:19:12 2015 UTC,I believe it's to prevent the cue ball from getting kissed too early causing undesired positions. Don't quote me.

billiards,2ytitu,miketo3,2,Fri Mar 20 01:44:31 2015 UTC,"I play 8 and 9 ball on various 8' tables. With slow felt, I break from the center with only a small amount of back spin to keep the cue ball from rocketing off the pack and into a wall. On fast felt, I break 8 from a diamond off from the head spot. Depending on which corner ball is looser, I break from the opposite side. For 9, I break a couple inches from the left rail on the head string. Maybe I'm just superstitious."
billiards,2ytitu,total_looser,2,Thu Mar 12 18:57:26 2015 UTC,So you guys don't find it effective to give it forward english to try to break the rack further more?
billiards,2ytitu,total_looser,2,Fri Mar 13 00:08:08 2015 UTC,I think the rack moves well with enough power and precision. Forward english will only make it harder to guarantee good cue ball position after the break

billiards,2yp4rv,nando420,3,Wed Mar 11 17:26:31 2015 UTC,I use this one. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9DHsGEorow  Each person has 3 strikes. You miss 3 times and you start over. This drill has improved my team's long shot precision and side pocket precision alot as for defensive and metagame drills I cant confidently rec any that im trying.
billiards,2yp4rv,aslay,3,Wed Mar 11 18:18:28 2015 UTC,"I know that you think it is hard to find higher ranked players, but you really need to try harder to find one.  It's not because of the points that you will get by playing a 6, but rather the points that you will get from his or her ability to give superior coaches.  You can't make the shot if you don't see the shot, or the pattern, or when to not take the shot for that matter.  Yes, higher ranked players have better technical ability, but what's just as important is that they can see the table in ways that you cannot.  This is something that can not only help your team during coaches, but during the downtime of nearly every shot as they wait for their opponent's inning to end.  You need to start looking wherever you have not yet looked for a higher ranked player.  I would start right here on /r/billiards and /r/philadelphia.  I found a player on this sub, and he had never played league before.  He ended up being a solid 5 on my team.  Make a post now.  It's free, and you have nothing to lose.  Continue looking online in other places.  My LO has a message board for players looking for teams and teams looking for players.  Does yours?  You should ask.  If your LO does not, encourage him to start one by showing him the link above.  Finally, post on popular billiards forums and facebook.  You live in a big city.  You can find a 6.  You just have not looked hard enough yet.  I understand that your roster is full.  Even if you did find a 6, you don't have room for them.    That situation will change.  No team has all 8 players come back every season.  Someone will likely drop for next season, especially because it is the summer season.  However, that is far from certain.  Here is how I recommend that you select a player to drop if you do indeed find a 6:  Start doing optional practice sessions on a day most accessible to your team, probably Saturday afternoon.  Any of the drills posted here by others are very good, rotate through them.  Keep the players who attend these practices.  Drop the one who attends the least (my guess is that you will have 1-2 players that never attend at all).  Here is a drill that I like that is particularly good for lower ranked players.  The skill that I find most low ranked players lack is the ability to hit very softly, which is crucial for many if not most defensive shots.  Place the cue ball half way between the back rail and the first diamond (center of back rail).  Place an object ball on the first diamond directly in front of the cue ball.  The object of the drill is to make the OB land right on the second diamond (where many tables have the sticker).  Have each player take five tries and cycle through the team.  This will be difficult for many 2's and 3's.  In fact, you will probably see that OB roll all the way past the side pockets on their first attempts.    However, they will quickly improve with practice.  This will make a huge difference when they attempt very soft shot defensive plays in the future.  Posting here with your intent to improve your team is much more than what most captains do.  Good luck!"
billiards,2yp4rv,burnt_wick,2,Thu Mar 12 02:30:09 2015 UTC,"You could keep track of who each person plays and whether they win or lose.  How much information about the match you want to write down is up to you.  It's easy enough to take a picture of the scoresheet at the end of the night.  The result is if you notice Bob always loses to John, try not to match them up.  If you keep track of ranks, you can tell if someone just went up or down since the last time you played them.  Note the personalities on your team.  I had a guy who would lose to a woman almost all the time no matter the rank.  So I just stopped doing the matchup (if I had a choice).  On the subject of timeouts, if the person is a 2 take one on a ball in hand.  Make sure they have the best chance to setup for the next ball.  You can do this for a 3, but I usually like to save a timeout for later in the game when you're closer to the 8 or when they need to kick at a ball.  Remember when giving advice the ability of the shooter.  2's and 3's might not understand ""soft shot"" or ""medium speed"".  They're probably not going to be able to do draw or lots of english.  You learn these things over time."
billiards,2yp4rv,garnerh42,2,Wed Mar 11 18:19:21 2015 UTC,"There were many times that I wanted to quit and felt like every loss was my fault. Ive learned that time outs should be used sparringly, really if the shooter is missing something thats obvious to you or if you see them struggling (taking a long time to figure out a shot or trouble aiming). You will have to be good at aiming and have a rough idea where the cue ball will go when it strikes the object ball to give helpful time outs. Let your teammates know that you trust them and they will trust themselves. It can be hard to organize but if you can make it happen. Its extremely important to have team get togethers for practice and working on shots that they find difficult. Even though you're the highest level player, I'm sure that others on your team have advice for tough situations to share with the others."
billiards,2yp4rv,aslay,2,Wed Mar 11 18:01:36 2015 UTC,"As for match ups, always look at the big picture. See all your skill levels as well as the opponents, this can keep you from having a mismatch at the end.  Being captain is difficult but when you have good team morale and start to win a few, it's so worth it."

I notice that many lower handicap players totally forgo the defensive aspect and try to shoot at a low percentage shot even when there is an obvious safe that will turn the rack to their advantage.  Practice them and you will see the opportunities more often with the added benefit of developing speed and cueball control."
billiards,2yp4rv,MrV2121,2,Thu Mar 12 13:53:13 2015 UTC,"You should try and get an older, more experienced player on your team (we are in the same boat on my team).  I am the only one ranked above a 4 (I am SL6 in 8-ball), but I am still not very seasoned so I don't always give the best advice.  So what we did, was signed an older gentleman (about 55 years old) whom is only a 4 (at the moment, he has been a 5 somewhat recently) who knows the in's and out's of the game, but is still a guy who is all about having fun.  Having him on our team (even though he isn't the best player himself) has helped our team dividends.  Everybody (besides me) on our team has bumped up at least one SL since his arrival.  He is most helpful on timeouts and can sometimes sand-bag a SL7 (if the other team plays 7-7-3-3-3).  Also, we have made the playoff's every session since his arrival, when before, we would struggle to make the wild-card.  Definitely good advice to recruit an veteran who packs much knowledge about the game even if he isn't the best skill wise.  That is how your team becomes better."
billiards,2yp4rv,JonLivestrong,2,Thu Mar 12 15:27:52 2015 UTC,"I was a captain for APA for about 2 years. We took first many times and top 3 i think everytime except maybe 1 session or 2 session, in at least 1 game 8/9. We even made it to nationals in Las Vegas. I as the captain couldn't make it because my gallbladder decided to almost rupture 2 days before the tournament. Was in the hospital for 6 days. We just recently stopped playing as a team because our players were getting ranked up constantly because we kept winning, even though it was just a 6 team league and i knew how to beat every team so it was easy..didnt mean my players were putting in 10 hours a night 5 days a week at a pool hall practicing, but since I knew how to win and manage the team, that led to its demise.  Here's my advice. Notice the players who are more committed. Make sure they're getting the attention they need when it comes to timeouts and practice time. The people who are there to hang out and have a good time and just shoot pool they're awesome to have on the team also. Main things to teach those type of players is table management (safeties, knowing when to stop pocketing balls and let the opponent shoot to clear problem areas that are hard to handle, time outs (if you can't call them)).  Learn how to talk to each player, you cannot talk to all of them the same, you have 6-7 different brains playing the game 6-7 different ways. So you have to learn each players habits and the way they process the game, so you can learn to teach them to fix their problems, and you can also learn how to line them up and play routes if you know how they like to play.  It's impressive that you're the highest rank at a 4. In Las Vegas we get ranked up so high its hilarious. Because we have so little teams. So little competition.  This was my line up for most the time for both 8 and 9 usually.  Ranks: 8,6,5,5,4,3,2. 8ball was about the same except the 8 was a 7.  So i could barely mix and match my roster. I had to play the same 5-6 players constantly. It was annoying. But you dont seem to suffer from that.  Fun things to do is add a scratch jar, every scratch is a quarter. use the money at the end of the session to pay the bar tab for an open bar on the team if u save that much (or dont drink that much).  You can also run practice nights where teammates play each other in matches and keep score as if its a league match. you can run a mini tournament, or play winner gets a beer/drink/food/ what not."
billiards,2yp4rv,The_Vapist,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:23:33 2015 UTC,Great tips I'll definitely try it. Yeah I'm playing out of philly there is a lot of competition and we are super slow to rank up. My one guy got several rackless nights before going up to a 4 just last week.
billiards,2yp4rv,hadronflux,1 point,Fri Mar 13 23:05:37 2015 UTC,Some people have recommended finding a stronger player to put on the team like a 5/6. They are hard to come by and my roster is already full. Plus my players don't shoot so bad. I've thought about getting together with my team to run drills maybe if you guys know of any good ones.
billiards,2yp4rv,Jiveturtle,2,Wed Mar 11 17:33:27 2015 UTC,"I'm on mobile, so pardon me just pasting the link. But this is a video by Robert Byrne (who also writes great books, his Standard Book of Pool and Billiards is AMAZING and I would recommend it 11/10.)  Anyways, this video has just about every drill you would need to bring yours, and your players' games, to their best. I would suggest watching the video with notebook in hand, because there is no way to remember everything this man says only watching the video once.  Also, there video sort of cuts and restarts in the middle, since whoever uploaded it ripped the video from a VHS tape. If you fast forward, there is still lots more content. I hope this helps!

billiards,2yo1y4,asbelowsoabove,2,Wed Mar 11 11:34:42 2015 UTC,"The key here is more practice. People who don't crack under pressure are that way because they have taken that shot hundreds and thousands of times when it doesn't matter, so that when it does matter, their natural ability just takes over without thinking about it."
billiards,2yo1y4,achovan,3,Wed Mar 11 12:28:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, that's kinda what I figured. The game is so easy in theory, but I can over complicate anything."
billiards,2yo1y4,fadedcheese,1 point,Wed Mar 11 13:26:13 2015 UTC,"The game is so easy in theory.   This game is HARD. If you are off by 1mm it can cause a miss or get you out of line. You have to have control over all kinds of things. Flaws in stance, stroke, speed, alignment, along with a host of other things can cause misses. Even if you pocket a ball doesn't necessarily mean you hit the shot properly. Everyone misses, most pros have probably missed more shots than you have even attempted to shoot at. It takes lots of practice. Don't ever get too down on yourself with this game as it's very demanding. When the pros run out it looks easy because they have practiced so much they make it look easy."
billiards,2yo1y4,fadedcheese,1 point,Wed Mar 11 14:11:25 2015 UTC,"All I meant by easy is that, there's no variables that you don't control. There's no wind, there's no one trying to block you or steal the ball. Its all on you, there's a spot on the ball for you to hit that will make your shot. You just have to execute it."
billiards,2yo1y4,unkn0wnEntity,1 point,Wed Mar 11 16:54:58 2015 UTC,"Sure there is. Dead rails, shitty cloth, the random bar patron walking in front of your shot can all be factors. This is why people pretty much always play better practicing or at their house than at the tourney.   Hell I lost a national championship because a buddy took a picture of me shooting a finals match with his camera flash on. That caused me to shank the shit outta the ball because I was in mid backswing. Wasn't a thing I could do about it. We look back and joke because that picture cost me $400+ and a slightly bigger trophy.  Anyway the point of this was to let you know that pool is a hard game and it just takes lots of practice when the pressure is on to overcome what you are having problems with. I was just trying to give you some support and reasons to not get too down on yourself."
billiards,2yo1y4,MrV2121,2,Wed Mar 11 17:54:13 2015 UTC,"So I was in the same boat as you. After hearing numerous people mention the book ""The inner game of tennis"" I gave it a read.   After reading it and applying what I learned the last 2 weeks of league play where a lot more fun and I was more relaxed and confident.   I strongly recommend reading this book. I will probably end up reading it again soon."
billiards,2yo1y4,justthrowitout86,2,Wed Mar 11 16:30:16 2015 UTC,"Just remember, it's just a game.  Win or lose, you still are going to come back next week and play again.  Once you accept that, you'll do much better when it comes to the clutch.  I used to freeze up on 8-ball shots all the time, but then after a couple sessions I made this realization.  I have been a SL6 ever since."
billiards,2yo1y4,too_lazy_2_punctuate,2,Thu Mar 12 15:32:41 2015 UTC,"I have the same problem and I am slowly starting to break it. Take your time and breathe. If you readjust your shot take a step back, chalk up, and line up all over again. My biggest problem is second guessing myself at the last minute. Taking a step back to readjust gives you a larger view of your shot and keeps you from making that 1/8th of an inch mistake that is the difference in making or missing your shot especially on a bank or cut shot."
billiards,2yo1y4,Jruff1984,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:49:52 2015 UTC,"For me, recently I lost a tourney and landed in 2nd place because I missed an easy shot on the 8. The guy I was playing was no joke, and i won't lie I was feeling the pressure. Usually I can handle pressure though, but in analyzing my play afterwords, I realized before I took that shot, I had doubted myself. Told myself I was likely to miss, in the back of my mind at least. pressure is part of the game, but your attitude goes a long way in overcoming the pressure. As mentioned in an above comment part of gaining that confidence when under pressure is to practice a lot so that when taking any shot, muscle memory can take care of most of it."
billiards,2ymfdd,UPVOTE_ATM,2,Wed Mar 11 00:20:30 2015 UTC,"I recently bought cloth for my table and asked everyone I trusted about it. The local pool hall owners all suggested 860HR, and the players (who owned tables) suggested Simonis by about a 2 to 1 margin.  Of the people who suggested something other than Simonis, the brands they named were at best $70 cheaper (for 9ft table), and none of them claimed their chosen brand would last as long.  I ended up forking over for the 860HR, although at a decent cash discount from my local pool hall owner."
billiards,2ymfdd,PShark,2,Wed Mar 11 01:39:17 2015 UTC,"That's probably because very few people can even name another brand of worsted cloth. The billiards market is VERY tough to penetrate, and since Simonis did it some 30 years ago they have never looked back."
billiards,2ymfdd,carter1984,1 point,Wed Mar 11 02:44:04 2015 UTC,I agree with this. I think most players only know the Simonis name and are ignorant to the actual composition of the cloth.  Im just trying to figure out if worsted cloth is worsted cloth no matter the brand.
billiards,2ymfdd,carter1984,1 point,Wed Mar 11 03:09:41 2015 UTC,"There are differences. The type of wool used, the nylon composition, the shearing process, the weight of the final product...all of these will affect how the cloth plays and how it ""wears"", but most players will not really be able to tell much of a difference in anything other than basic speed, and even that is subjective."

billiards,2yjlva,trinatek,7,Tue Mar 10 10:21:07 2015 UTC,"I was an optician for a few months and actually spoke to the optometrist about this. She said that in pool you're moving quickly from ""reading"" to ""intermediate"" to ""distance"" lengths that it becomes more difficult for your eyes to focus. Add that to your general prescription overall deteriorating, and you start to have a hard time making out the edge of the ball you need to hit."
billiards,2yjlva,adequatepipe,2,Tue Mar 10 12:45:50 2015 UTC,"moving quickly from ""reading"" to ""intermediate"" to ""distance"" lengths that it becomes more difficult for your eyes   This is something I was warned about when I had laser surgery.  As you get older the muscles in your eyes grow weaker and your lens gets stiffer, so it becomes more difficult to focus on close objects.  I may still have 20/20+ distance vision when I'm 60, but I'll likely need reading glasses for close work.  My dad went through cataract surgery about 10 years ago.  He's currently pushing 80 but has perfect distance vision and he needs reading glasses for the same reason."

billiards,2yjlva,CreeDorofl,2,Tue Mar 10 20:51:10 2015 UTC,"I attribute the decline in my level of play with the decline in the quality of my vision. It doesn't help that my dominant eye is getting worse than the other at a slightly different rate. My right eye, arm, back foot plane is no longer the automatic setup. If I don't spend time finding my center of vision for each session, I'll be relying on luck and modifying on the fly. It's not optimal.   Now, I've never been a World-beater, but the decline is real and measurable."
billiards,2yjlva,CreeDorofl,2,Wed Mar 11 00:39:14 2015 UTC,"For the record he got lasik and strongly recommends it, so the commentators may be jumping to conclusions. There are a lot of other things that cause a decline including a simple lack of drive. And even pool takes a toll on your body. It's not football or anything, but it can still wear you out, to the point where your mind is distracted by back pain, aching feet, etc. and you miss a ball you're supposed to make.   The main thing is being able to see the edges of the balls. A lot of us subconsciously aim cuts by imagining the cue ball eclipsing/overlapping the edge of the object ball. If it's a fairly thin cut, and the edge of the ball is indistinct, you can't see that tiny sliver of overlap. Glasses may help but they're a pain to shoot with. Not a lot of world champions won their titles wearing glasses."

billiards,2yjlva,fadedcheese,-2,Wed Mar 11 19:30:29 2015 UTC,Also his form is terrible. For decades this didn't seem to matter but now it seems like it's hard for him to fade his insane stroke. He will totally dog a shot and not know how to fix it because his arm is all over the place on a shot.  Edit: I think he used to practice more.
billiards,2yjlva,RoadHustler,2,Tue Mar 10 16:03:33 2015 UTC,"Really? I've always thought his shooting form was one of the most organic, beautiful ones out there. Unconventional? Absolutely. I've never seen anything like it - when he shoots, his pool cue is truly an extension of himself. A result of years as a poor child living in a Pool Hall and sleeping underneath the tables, playing every single day.  I also think calling his form ""terrible"" is a bit much. The pendulum method isn't the only way to shoot out there, and in someways can actually be really restrictive with what you can do with it."

Oh for sure I wouldn't call him the monster he once was. I also mentioned in my original post that he's certainly not the player he once was - but he's also 60 now, and on any given night you still see flashes of his older self. I doubt many of the greatest pool players out there played their best in their 60's.  Efren is nearly twice the age of maybe 80% of all the individuals who even take their stabs at the US Open, Banks, 1 Pocket competitions, World 9 Ball, etc. -- he's got 20-30 years on a lot of them. In our life times, you and I may never get good enough to defeat the Efren of today (I mean unless you're one of the players that gets invited out to Vegas every year). It's really an amazing feat, and I don't think anyone can deny that.  I think it's kind of odd knocking on him for loving the game and loving competitive play still even in his old age. You seem to be taking what he's doing, something I find extremely admirable and heartful, and knocking him for it. Kind of makes you ask yourself: what if the other greats played well into their 60's with the same impairments Efren faces every time he steps to the table today? How well would they fare, y'know?  I would go as far to say that if you took any of those past greats, put them in their 60's and face them against the Efren of today - I wouldn't hesitate to put money down on the magician.  (TL;TR Of course he's not the monster he once was. He's still a hell of a player by human standards. What he's doing out there is admirable. If you took Efren in his prime against anyone else in their prime I would take Efren. If you took Efren at the age of 60 vs any of the past greats at 60, I would take Efren)"
billiards,2yjlva,fadedcheese,-1,Wed Mar 11 03:22:47 2015 UTC,I find it hysterical that it can be considered bad form to critique a athletes declining performance. His form sucks and he hasn't been competitive in years yes he wins occasionally. For instance he won the manny pachaio tournament because svb (who walked out) and dennis o were both knocked out for not calling the ten ball. So reyes played one of his students in the final who also shouldnt have been there. Ok he was once the best in the world now he isnt even close.
billiards,2yjlva,RoadHustler,3,Tue Mar 10 23:29:31 2015 UTC,I think he finished 2nd in the Overall at the Derby this year. I'd say that's pretty competitive as it's an all around and not a single event. Also the fact that he was dead asleep in a chair for probably 30+ mins before he woke up to play Dechaine was just funny in itself. It's sad to see his skill decline but I don't agree that he is no longer competitive.

billiards,2ygupk,RoadHustler,0,Mon Mar 9 19:46:57 2015 UTC,"it can, but it depends on your contact point.  it creates a downward movement as the tip hits the ball.  sometimes you can see people's cue really flex against the table.  if, by raising, you end up contacting the top of the cue ball, you can cause a jump, but if your contact point is low, you likely wont jump."
billiards,2ygupk,redditor1983,3,Mon Mar 9 20:00:05 2015 UTC,You may try standing a litttle closer to the table and therefore a little higher off the cue on your break shot. But not at the expense of accuracy. I really like that it appears you are leaving the cue ball in the center of the table. That is IMO the most difficult and most vital part of the break after making a ball. Good work...
billiards,2ygupk,RoadHustler,2,Mon Mar 9 19:36:03 2015 UTC,Cool video.  Here is Shane Van Boening's break in super slow-mo for comparison.  Notice he stands up almost completely mid-stroke. And he's known as having one of the better (best?) break in pool.
billiards,2ygupk,redditor1983,2,Mon Mar 9 19:40:18 2015 UTC,"Contrarian here... love shane he plays great but, big BUT. While everyone talks about his break what they fail to mention is that almost every loss he has suffered vs the other top players was in alternating break format and was not because he missed a ball. His losses were a direct result of losing control of the cue ball and it ending up snookered on the right head rail with a kick or bank on the one or no shot on the two and less so scratching on the break. When he breaks 10 ball he is playing position on the one in the left head corner when the cue ball gets kicked by one of the the middle end row balls he ends up in trouble. In alternating break format you must hold serve if your opponent isnt going to miss like the Ko brothers, Appleton, ect. He shoots as well as the best and breaks to win but at that level small percentages count big."

billiards,2ygupk,Gilandb,1 point,Mon Mar 9 23:12:47 2015 UTC,"I remember someone mentioning that the pivot point is really important to know for your break shaft when you do this sort of break with a lot of movement. Here's Dr. Dave's explanation of it, the gist of it being that there's a certain distance bridge for a given shaft where shooting off center still goes mostly straight. This would cut down on missing a solid hit on the head ball.   For Shane's, there's more backswing and a bit of lateral rotation involved, whereas I notice most Asian and European players minimize the backswing and lean forward over their shot more, resulting in a lot of digging into the felt.   I spent a summer learning this break when I was too easily influenceable by what I saw on youtube matches (horrible idea to start watching the Filipinos). It was an extremely high learning curve break method, and I don't think the results are worth it over at the amateur level compared to a simpler style. It's also not particularly practical for 9 ball, where the break is more about breaking from the side, making a wing ball, sending the one to the opposite side corner, and controlling the cue ball."

billiards,2ygupk,CreeDorofl,1 point,Mon Mar 9 23:12:10 2015 UTC,"looks good ill put in my 2 cents if u dont mind!  if you take ur time starting your forward stroke you can rise higher making more room for your arm to swing through the ball. if you watch shane van boening break (best break in the game; my opinion) he almost holds the cue at the back of the stroke as he's rising, keeping it there generating more power as he lifts his body way up.  when you make contact your elbow is still at 90 degrees as if you're just hitting a hard shot, you rise about 2 inches when you make contact. if you watch shane, he rising almost straight up, at least 2 feet rise up, almost of the female pros do the same its the only way to generate the most amount of consistent power."

billiards,2ygsvl,rektful,4,Mon Mar 9 18:24:38 2015 UTC,"Here is a practice that helped me a lot on my straight shots.    -Line up the cue ball on a diamond on the long rail.  Aiming center ball or slightly above center, shoot straight across to the matching diamond on the other long rail. You want to have just enough speed for the cue ball come back to the tip of your cue.  This will show you how straight your stroke is and if you are unintentionally adding spin or missing your aim point on the cue ball.  Once you get this down, switch to doing it the long way on the table.  If I notice that my shots are little bit off line during a game.  This is the exercise that I go back to every time and it will straighten out my stroke again.  Bonus! If you have the option to lag for break, this gets you pretty good with your speed control."
billiards,2ygsvl,docsplacej,2,Mon Mar 9 18:58:37 2015 UTC,"practice.  straight shots can often be taken for granted.  If you're into practicing, you can literally practice those straight in shots.  And while you're practicing, I recommend also practicing your cue control by making sure the cue either stops perfectly after making contact with object ball, or if do put top or bottom onto it that it rolls perfectly toward pocket or back to stick tip location.  Hope this helps."
billiards,2ygsvl,MrV2121,1 point,Mon Mar 9 18:41:07 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry if i dont answer your question, but I think I may know what you are talking about because I've had trouble with rather straight in shots in the past, despite shooting straight being one of my stronger suits.  If you have a straight shot and the object ball goes a little to the left or right during your miss there can be a few different reasons for this.  It could have to do with either hitting the cue ball wrong, like you accidentally put a little unintended spin left or right. Sometimes a straight shot missed has to do with either hitting the ball with extreme top or extreme bottom, for some reason when you put these two it 'throws' the object ball differently and you have to be really focused on your stroke delivery when using extreme bottom or top.  I play snooker sometimes, I've noticed that the grip ia very important in delivery ans has to be just right with a tough straight in a shot. I put a lot of focus on my body mechanics when I shoot a long straight in shot. You have to put a deliberate stroke on the ball whether you are hitting harder or softer. I think when you are very confident with your mechanics, the long straight shot becomes easier. Just practice shooting long straight shots, and really pay attention to how you are missing."
billiards,2ygsvl,SeabrookMiglla,1 point,Mon Mar 9 21:01:54 2015 UTC,Obviously practice maters but what are we practicing when we practice straight shots. For me its about Pre shot routine and alignment and stroke straightness. You see because its perfectly straight in if you miss you can eliminate aim as a cause and pay attention to alignment and straightness sometimes I use a drill like this to work on grip or eye pattern too.
billiards,2ygsvl,RoadHustler,1 point,Mon Mar 9 23:48:01 2015 UTC,"thats a good point. for me the grip, with variations of the straight shot, is where i think most of my concerns are and what i focus on when im down on the shot. any slight deviations in your arm or grip can cause you to hit the ball in an unintended fashion."
billiards,2ygsvl,SeabrookMiglla,1 point,Tue Mar 10 08:18:23 2015 UTC,"i tried hitting it really soft with follow through and that seems to work. but then i see people slamming a straight and the object ball just disappears to the pocket. and yea if the object ball is far, it will often go left or right if i put any kind of force into it. i use an open hand grip for almost all my shots, should i change that? cue btw thumb and index"
billiards,2ygsvl,SeabrookMiglla,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:51:09 2015 UTC,"In all honesty I think hitting a long straight in a shot with low speeds is more difficult than hitting it with medium or hard speed. You may be not 'stroking' the ball good when you hit it at higher speeds. It's not really about slamming the ball in, it's more about the quality of the stroke even when you are hitting harder. in terms of your bridge- it's all preference open or closed. Although, there are various ways to use an open bridge. So this could be a problem IF you do not have a sound bridge. Check the level of your bridge, is your Palm on the table or not? You need to be aware of the height of you bridge and adjust your mechanics because there are certain bridges that make shots easier and more difficult."

But to be eligible to do that you have to be active on an APA team? Is that right?  I was on an APA team for about a year, and it was OK. I did well, but I'm really not into the team thing.

billiards,2yf44x,_uncreativeusername,3,Mon Mar 9 07:00:54 2015 UTC,"Make sure that you're aiming for the biggest part of the pocket.  The size and center of the pocket changes based on the angle that you're shooting.  I used to have a bad habit of aiming for the center of the pocket even if I was doing a cut shot.  Also make sure that you can visualize the object ball going into the pocket and stay down to watch it fall (if possible).  If you're sitting there doing practice strokes and it doesn't quite feel right, stand up and take a walk around the table.  90% of the shots I miss by a hair I say to myself ""shit, I knew that was wrong but it did it anyway"".  If you stay down until the object ball falls then your body will remember what it felt like to make that shot and the next time it will be easier.  There are some shots I can glance at for half a second, take zero practice strokes, and nail every time because they feel so natural."

billiards,2yf44x,AK_Chrism,3,Mon Mar 9 08:21:35 2015 UTC,"Usually when I'm not shooting well it has something to do with the fundamentals.  Staying down on your shot, following through on your stroke, keeping that good pendulum motion of your forearm and keeping the rest of your body still.  Perhaps even the way you address the table and go through your pre-shot routine.  One thing that I do at times is to shoot opposite handed.  I'm usually holding the butt of the cue in my right hand, but if I switch to my left, I really have to slow down and be very purposeful about doing things the right way.  Then when I switch back to my right I am focusing more on doing the basic things right and it feels like my shots drop more often than not and I am controlling my cue ball better.  If you've never practiced off-handed this may just be frustrating to try, but it is really a useful trick to have in your bag for certain shots that come up, instead of having to shoot with a bridge, or behind your back, etc... you can just switch hands and pocket the ball naturally."
billiards,2yf44x,dalgeek,3,Mon Mar 9 16:42:18 2015 UTC,"One thing that I do at times is to shoot opposite handed.   Good to know i'm not the only one who does this.  I started learning how to shoot left-handed when I played doubles with a left-handed partner.  It definitely makes you more aware of what your body is doing.  I play at least a few games every week left-handed, and at this point I'm about 75% as good with my left hand and there are some shots I shoot better with my left hand.  It's nice to not have to hunt down a bridge for really simple shots that just happen to be on the wrong side of the table."

If I'm in a funk, I find one part of my technique that I know is crucial to a successful stroke and I just focus on that. For example, I may focus on keeping my head still through the shot while maintaining a loose wrist. I also make sure to simplify my game a lot. I avoid extravagant leaves involving lots of draw or follow or five rails etc. and I try to play as many stun/stop shots as possible.   It's the same attitude when I play an sport really. Like when I play tennis. Same thing. Focus on technique, keep head still, maintain looseness, breathe while hitting and keep it really simple.   As my strokes come back, and with it, my confidence, I slowly bring back the flair.  Also remember that sometimes there are things in your life just somewhere in the back of your mind gnawing away at you, unbeknownst to you.

Not only is it relatively cheap, ~$10 plus the price of a tip, a lathe will generally allow for a much cleaner and safer install (you will probably butcher a few tips before you get it right and might damage your cue if you are not careful) and tips only need to be replaced every 6 months to several years, so you wont exactly get good at it if you only do your own cue.

billiards,2yeyv0,gabrielleigh,4,Mon Mar 9 15:08:02 2015 UTC,"Tips, even the cheaper ones, can last for years if properly maintained. Some tips are unquestionably more prone to mushrooming, flattening, and compressing a bit after they are installed. Most of these problems occur early in the life of the tip, and if they are addressed properly by the owner, they can often be resolved once and then the tip enters a more ""stable"" period in its life where any changes are much smaller for the rest of its service life. The biggest single issue with the lifespan of the tip is often in the way the tip is scuffed by the owner. Some players needlessly grind away on their tips with rough sandpaper or scuffers, others tear apart their tips with the tip pick tools. Properly scuffed tips should exhibit virtually no wear in the short term, and proper scuffing techniques result in no ""fuzziness"" in the dome, and you should see no leather or debris ""snowing"" down from the tool because of excessive pressure. The scuffing procedure should serve to simply clean the tip of contaminants and chalk dust, and should create very fine and relatively smooth circular scratches in the surface of the dome leather. If done properly, virtually no leather should be removed in the scuffing process, only the chalk dust and contaminants that are pounded into a shiny ""glaze"" on the surface of the leather. I play with an extremely soft Kamui SS tip, and I installed it about a year and a half ago and it is still at about 60% of its original installed thickness. Not too shabby after thousands of games, dozens of tournaments and gambling sets.   A good tip can last you quite a while, and I'll be happy to link you some articles and pics of how to scuff and maintain your tip if you'd like.   Here is a pretty in-depth write up I did a while back on the subject:  https://np.reddit.com/r/billiards/comments/1qpxsi/scuffing_a_cue/"

billiards,2yeyv0,too_lazy_2_punctuate,1 point,Mon Mar 9 16:46:33 2015 UTC,"So, do you recommend the owning of a burnisher or a grazer to help deal with mushrooming?   Its one of those things I'm on the edge about whether I want one or not."
billiards,2yeyv0,gotwired,3,Mon Mar 9 17:56:20 2015 UTC,"Burnishing a tip is always bad, in my opinion. Some tip leather will naturally compress and mushroom out a bit (especially soon after installation). While this does not necessarily mean the tip is inferior or defective, it is an annoying occurrence and can have a huge impact on your mental game during aiming. The quick and easy on-the-spot short term fix is to burnish the sides of the tip to re-compress the tip leather back to its original shape. While this makes an immediate improvement on the shape of the tip, the unseen side effect is that you cause the tip leather to expand back after it has become compressed. This process is often repeated many times as the tip leather is re-compressed, then burnished, then compressed again with more play. What happens is that the leather becomes weakened by this back-and-forth process, and it eventually begins to fall apart on the microscopic level. The tip will eventually become easier and easier to deform, and mushrooming will tend to occur quicker and easier as time goes on.   In addition to the problems caused by compressing the leather back to its desired shape through burnishing, this process also can add heat to the tip through the friction of burnishing and compressing it. Heat is generally a bad thing for most tips, especially layered tips, because it can degrade the adhesive used to bond the individual layers of leather together. I think burnishing increases the chance of ""delamination"", or separation of layers, in layered tips.   What I feel is the better remedy is to carefully remove the mushroom using either a hand-held trimming tool, or to have a cuesmith machine off the mushroom on the lathe. A razor trimmer works very well, and can be kept in your cue case for on-the-spot mushroom removal. Make sure you keep a very new razor installed in the tool, and with a little practice you will find you can effectively remove the mushroomed leather and restore your tip to the desired condition yourself. If you don't feel confident in doing it yourself, this is about a two minute fix for any cuesmith, and most smiths wont charge you anything to remove the mushroom and give the tip a good machine scuffing for you.   Removing the mushroomed leather with a trimmer or a lathe achieves a successful restoration of tip shape without subjecting the tip leather to the harmful effects of burnishing. You do not disturb the natural compaction of the leather in this method, and the tip remains more consistent and durable in the long run compared to the burnishing method. In most cases, a tip will develop a mushroom in the first couple months of use. Having the mushroom trimmed off correctly will generally allow the tip to remain consistent and in a vast majority of cases the mushroom will not develop again after the tip is broken in after initial installation.   There are certainly exceptions to this rule, but in most cases you will have far superior results by trimming the mushroom instead of burnishing it."

billiards,2yeyv0,RoadHustler,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:19:16 2015 UTC,"It's just advice to get people to buy more tips. Unless you are really scuff happy or your tip breaks due to a bad miscue or defect, it should last around 6 months minimum, much longer for hard tips."
billiards,2ydrco,amshaffer,3,Sun Mar 8 22:54:55 2015 UTC,"If its not affecting your stroke, don't worry about it. Basically every pro ever drops their elbow on shots that are medium speed or higher.  Some instructors promote a static elbow, but its mostly because lower level players haven't refined their strokes enough to stroke effectively and they want to simplify their students' movements so that it is easier to work with."
billiards,2ydrco,gotwired,1 point,Mon Mar 9 00:00:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you don't have to follow the pendulum method to a T. For shooting at the cueball at medium to higher speeds, dropping the elbow slightly is actually the natural course your arm will wanna take - As long as, like gotwired said, it's not affecting your stroke."
billiards,2ydrco,trinatek,1 point,Mon Mar 9 03:34:38 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. I'll try to be more aware of keeping things static next time I'm at a table. I wonder if I'll notice a difference!  I dropped a clip of my stroke in here just to make sure I'm not doing anything too terrible.
billiards,2ydrco,HappySoda,2,Mon Mar 9 04:09:19 2015 UTC,"Nah, you're good. That elbow drop is due to your overly exaggerated follow through. At least that is what it looks like from the clip. As a snooker player, our follow through usually don't extend out more than 2 to 3 inches. Pool players seem to go for really long distances. I'm not sure if there's a good reason for that (I suspect people exaggerate it because it looks cooler when playing pool). But in order to do that kind of distance, your elbow must drop as your hand moves beyond its natural limit.   Mark a spot on the cue ball and place the ball in a way that the spot is dead center. Now, try to hit center ball. Look at the chalk mark. Is it right on the spot? If so, you have nothing to worry about. If not, you might want to shorten your bright distance or something."
billiards,2ydrco,SoYppah,1 point,Mon Mar 9 10:16:26 2015 UTC,"Good to know! I knew follow through was important, so I must've just overdone it in an attempt to make sure I actually do it in the first place.  I'll see about reigning it in a bit. I don't want to accidentally double hit or anything."
billiards,2ydrco,endingcreds,1 point,Mon Mar 9 13:36:26 2015 UTC,"These are just my opinions-  If u are still new to the game <1 year+- and u want to have good habits.. you should change ur stroke that you lock your arm. It makes urself cue straighter(lowering your arm generates more power, yes, but also tends to make you not cue straight).  People that drop their arm have normally been doing it for years to the point they correct their own stroke to cue straight or they have practised it alot to give themselves more cue power. Examples are the filipinos(efren reyes) and Ronnie o sullivan(snooker)  It's more of making a mental note to lock your arms before the shot for the first few months and after that it just becomes muscle memory."
billiards,2ydrco,aslay,1 point,Mon Mar 9 00:03:54 2015 UTC,"If you're just putting balls in I think your exaggerated follow through is probably overkill and dropping the elbow in unnecessary. Remember, the follow through should be proportional to the back stroke length which depends on the speed of the shot. It's when you need that extra bit of action for power draw/follow that dropping the elbow really helps. I also drop the elbow on the break shot."

billiards,2y9opz,squid06,2,Sat Mar 7 20:43:53 2015 UTC,I would think that if a reputable mechanic that did it they should come and fix it at no charge. Unless you caused it by trying to move the table or something. They'll have to remove the bed cloth to redo the seem.
billiards,2y9opz,fadedcheese,2,Sun Mar 8 00:03:23 2015 UTC,"Got to agree with cheese As long as you didn't move the table or sit, stand, dance on it this shouldn't happen. And if the slates were in such bad shape when it was re-felted that they couldn't be stabilized with shims then they should have mentioned the issue. I would recommend you call up the guy who set up the table describe what happened and see if he/she will come repair it. If not you may want to find a new mechanic.   Oh also on a new table shipped from somewhere else extreme changes in humidity / environment could cause this as well. If part of the frame were to swell."
billiards,2y9opz,RoadHustler,1 point,Sun Mar 8 02:00:54 2015 UTC,"So I may have briefly put some weight on the table with my foot while installing the light above it.

billiards,2y9opz,fadedcheese,1 point,Sun Mar 8 05:28:26 2015 UTC,Yeah honestly you're probably responsible for part of it then. Mechanic could take some of the blame depending on what he shimmed it with I guess. It could cost you a new bed cloth because that will have to be pulled up. I'm guessing you stepped on the seem and broke the beeswax or whatever was used to fill it loose. A table should be able to take some weight because you have to lean on it to shoot longer shots but not a whole body of weight right there. Also why it's not a good idea to use the table as storage and set stuff on it.
billiards,2y9opz,RoadHustler,1 point,Sun Mar 8 14:37:11 2015 UTC,So the thing is if the frame isnt level under the slate the slate has somewhere to go under the weight and the only thing holding it together is wax and probably superglue.  * Edit: Had your installer put in shims evenly it probably would have been ok. But its hard to say from here.

Three days I play league and two other days I practice by ghosting or playing other players I know if they're around.    I play APA for my local pool hall, and the owner of the place is the captain of my teams.  He set up a time every Friday that I go in and he plays with me for a couple hours, gives me pointers, etc.  He is a 9 in 9ball and a 7 in 8ball so I try to soak up everything I can from him.  I think he does this because he could tell I really wanted to improve and I showed a passion for the game.  I don't ever seen him playing anyone else unless its for money.  The thing that made the biggest difference for me was improving my stroke and understanding how spin induced throw works."

Sometimes you get such a good break that a 3 could run it, sometimes you get a mess that Efren Reyes would shake his head at.  The most important part is being able to recognize the run (based on the spread and your shooting ability), make a plan for the run, and execute the plan as accurately as possible.  Once you have the plan don't worry about the 8 ball, just worry about getting to your next ball.  I don't know how many times I've been 5-6 shots into a B&R only to miss my shape and blow the run.  Oh, and don't miss."

I get the level of play might not be as great as some of the bigger events. Most people work during the week so might only have a few hours to watch in the evening. looping doesn't help because by the time they get back from work the next day that days events have started.

Really I think that some days the game comes easy- you are feeling good, you are stroking well, getting favorable lay outs, getting favorable rolls. Other days it will be the opposite, none of these things will happen and you will constantly be trying to gain momentum and catch a rythym but it will never come.  I think this is just a reality of the game, although simply recognizing when this is happening and trying to play through it is crucial in player maturity.  I think there are different ways people go about trying to fight their way through a tough day at the table when nothing seems to be going right. I think understanding what kind of a player you are helps this. Knowing what your strengths and weaknesses are, and how to shift momentum of the game. Some players when struggling break down to their mechanics and become more cautious and slow their game down. I think in general whenever you speed your game up too quickly you have a higher chance of getting in trouble. Although some players are ry thym players and have go more by feel and don't really think about lay outs that much. But I think regardless of style, I think trusting and knowing your abilities is key to becoming a better player."

billiards,2y3fdy,asamimasa,2,Fri Mar 6 02:29:21 2015 UTC,"I can't seem to find any reference material on their ""NX"" ferrule material. I found an AZB forum question from a guy who says they claim the ferrule is made from two different materials, which is pretty common with new ""LD"" shafts that have hit the market in the last few years. I also found a fairly high-rez photo of a replacement Mezz ferrule, which didn't specify if it was a factory made Mezz ferrule, or somebody else reproducing them. The material in the photo looked a lot like the Aegis material I use in my shop, though.   I haven't done a Mezz ferrule replacement yet, so keep in mind my advice is purely speculation based on working on other LD shafts which are marketed with similar features. I have replaced hundreds of ferrules, though, and some problems and symptoms seem pretty consistent regardless of brand.   As far as the tapering goes, it generally isn't something that necessarily means you have to replace the ferrule. A lot of LD ferrules are extremely thin-walled. The popular theory with LD shaft technology is that deflection is often attributed to the mass of the shaft, particularly within the tip end of the shaft. The general consensus is that if you reduce the mass in the end of the shaft near the tip, you lower ""deflection"". Some companies accomplish this by drilling or boring out the end of the shaft to make it hollow, then often filling in the void with a foam or some other type of ""core"" which weighs less than the wood that was previously there. Consequently, in the race to make the lightest and strongest shaft possible, some companies have even redesigned ferrules to make them very thin and light as well. Most ferrules used to be roughly 13mm in diameter, and were often installed on a 5/16"" wood tenon. This meant that ferrule sidewall thickness was in the ballpark of .100"" in most cases. Manufacturers could therefore use thermoset plastics like ABS, PVC, and other formulations to create cheap ferrules that would last a reasonable amount of time. With the advent of modern ""LD"" shaft technology and thinner profiles, ferrule diameter has shrunk from a common 13mm size to 12mm or less in some cases. Quite a few shafts are now standardly produced in the 11.75mm size now.  A 12mm diameter ferrule installed on a 5/16"" tenon now has a sidewall thickness of roughly .080"". An 11.75mm ferrule on the same tenon now has a sidewall thickness of .075"" at most. Threaded ferrules (like the Mezz ferrule) also now have the added problem of seeing this extremely thin sidewall scored with fracture-inducing internal threads which I feel like further compromise the strength of the ferrule.  The end product is a ferrule which has the sidewall thickness which roughly equates to not much more than that of a credit card. In the case of Predator ferrules, they use a soft thermoset plastic material instead of a composite ferrule made from resin and cloth which would be quite a bit stronger. My best guess just by looking at some random pics on the web is that Mezz probably uses a composite ferrule material which is a bit stronger than the junk thermoset plastics, but I couldn't know that for sure until I get my hands on one.   If the tapering is essentially limited to the ""cap"" of the ferrule, then the odds of it weakening the strength of the ferrule are much lower. If the tapering extends back into the sidewall of the ferrule that surrounds the tenon, then the structural integrity of the ferrule is lower for sure. Will it cause ferrule failure? That is hard to say. Ferrules replacement is not super cheap, and I always recommend people to just play with it until you have a problem. I have seen some incredibly thin ferrules with deep scratches last for years and years without problems, and I have seen brand new ferrules crack the first night they were used. I'd just use it until you see a problem. One huge, significant factor in this whole situation is the mental effect of seeing the taper when you are aiming. If the tapering on the ferrule distracts you or bothers you, then I think that could easily reduce your ability to focus and play your best pool. In that case, you may find it to be a good investment to just have it replaced for peace of mind if nothing else.  As far as tip pads go, I don't see any correlation between using them and extending the life of ferrules or shafts or anything else. I think it is a mental thing, and a pad will often slightly change the ""feel"" of a particular tip. It is one of those issues of personal preference, and you should use a pad if you like the feel of the tip better with a pad under it. I can't say I have ever seen any measurable trend in equipment durability related to pads, though."

It's also pretty sad that the LO did not know this and could not offer a ruling on the spot."

billiards,2y0p54,Stiegurt,2,Fri Mar 6 02:44:39 2015 UTC,"Generally, for just about all instances I've come across in APA, there's no retroactive action available for most instances, you can't ""go back and make it right"" and since the ball both players had interpreted to be used as the '9' was already pocketed, what anyone has to say about it at that point is moot. It's similar to how in 8 if a player starts shooting the wrong set of balls, gets all the way down to the 8 and pockets it, it's too late for anyone to do or say anything about it at that point.  If someone had caught it prior to the ""9"" being pocketed I would guess that the action which would be most in-keeping with APA's general rule set would be to continue shooting on the table as-is, but with the correct ball as the ""9"" (no-one noticed prior to the break, and you can't ""un-score"" a rack that's been partially shot)  Source: 18 years playing APA  tl;dr: There's no ""backsies"" in APA"
billiards,2y0p54,spicyclitstatertits,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:06:56 2015 UTC,See that makes somewhat sense.. it's some sort of an answer where as our league operator couldn't provide us with one. Would that pocketed ball be considered a dead ball?
billiards,2y0p54,thepottsy,2,Fri Mar 6 02:48:45 2015 UTC,That's ridiculous. All over.  Who is catching balls during a league match?! What SL are these guys who can't pony up an extra rack? Your league operator is an idiot.
billiards,2y0p54,spicyclitstatertits,5,Thu Mar 5 15:52:11 2015 UTC,"This is common practice for leagues that have to play on coin operated tables, and is suggested in the rule book.  No clue what SL matters in the equation."
billiards,2y0p54,thepottsy,0,Thu Mar 5 16:06:52 2015 UTC,"I play on coinops, I understand.  If it is a couple of 7's shooting dollar/rack, those are 55 balls that have to be paid for.  You gotta pay to play, if you don't pay your match dues, you don't play. If you cant afford a couple bucks to shoot a clean rack, then you probably shouldn't shoot.   Just my couple cents."
billiards,2y0p54,gar187er,0,Thu Mar 5 16:27:49 2015 UTC,"It's 55 balls if one player skunks the other.  If it's 2 7's playing, that's probably not going to happen.  It could potentially be 109 balls, which if my math is correct is 13 racks.  Not exactly wallet busting, but after paying your league dues for the night, and possibly your bar tab, why not try and save a few dollars if possible."
billiards,2y0p54,gabrielleigh,1 point,Thu Mar 5 16:36:18 2015 UTC,I am counting myself lucky that the bars open up the tables for league around here.  No quarters needed.
billiards,2y0p54,thepottsy,1 point,Thu Mar 5 21:06:46 2015 UTC,Same here.
billiards,2y0p54,thepottsy,1 point,Fri Mar 6 17:43:13 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I would tend to think that (regardless of which balls are used to make up the rack) the responsibility of determining the correct order to shoot the balls, and also to ensure that it is appropriate to move any balls by hand before touching them (for example, to gather the balls to rack the next game) will always fall on the shooter who controls the table. Fouls are generally considered ""unintentional"" unless the rare case of unsportsmanlike conduct shows up and someone intentionally fouls by cheating or otherwise disrupting the game.   For reference, I found a section in the WPBA rules that governs ""touched balls"":  ""6.6 Touched Ball  It is a foul to touch, move or change the path of any object ball except by the normal ball-to-ball contacts during shots. It is a foul to touch, move or change the path of the cue ball except when it is in hand or by the normal tip-to-ball forward stroke contact of a shot. The shooter is responsible for the equipment he controls at the table, such as chalk, bridges, clothing, his hair, parts of his body, and the cue ball when it is in hand, that may be involved in such fouls. If such a foul is accidental, it is a standard foul, but if it is intentional, it is 6.16 Unsportsmanlike Conduct.""  From what you describe, this appears to be a completely honest mistake with no unsportsmanlike conduct, so I'd lean toward this situation being considered a standard foul committed by the person currently at the table in control of the balls and equipment on the table.   Page 54-54 of the APA Team Manual indicates some of the circumstances where balls are moved or touched by hand, and outlines how they are replaced:  ""g. Causing even the slightest movement or altering the course of the cue ball, even accidentally, is a foul. Even dropping the chalk on the cue ball is a foul. It is not a foul, however, to accidentally move any other balls (including the 8-ball) unless, during his turn at the table, a player moves a ball and it in turn comes in contact with the cue ball. Any balls moved accidentally during a shot must be replaced by the opponent after the shot is over and all balls have stopped rolling. If it occurs before the shot, it must be replaced before the shot is taken. EXCEPTION: If an accidentally moved ball comes in contact with the cue ball, creating a foul, no object ball will be replaced.""  So looking at all of this in the context of what you described, if the person who began to re-rack the balls did not touch the cue ball, then I'd say the object balls should be replaced before the opponent could continue play. If the person re-racking the balls grabs the cueball in the process, then I think it becomes ball in hand for the opponent and the balls should be replaced to an agreeable position. The rulebook is vague in this situation, and generally these situations are referred to the league operator. If the teams do not wish to call the league operator at that time, then they simply have to come to an agreement on how to resolve the situation before play may continue. If no agreement can be made, then the match is usually postponed until a ruling can be made by the league operator."
billiards,2y0p54,thepottsy,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:11:04 2015 UTC,"The rule book isn't vague on it.  They give you some guidelines, not rules, for how to play while saving a little money.  Both players were in agreement on what ball was the 9 ball.  No foul was made.  People aren't paying attention to OP's initial post.  Neither player had an issue with the outcome, or the way the balls were racked.  An onlooker did. An individual who has no say in how the 2 players play their match, can NOT call a foul, and really has no business commenting on the match at all."
billiards,2y0p54,snowman818,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:24:35 2015 UTC,The onlooker was a member on one of the teams. It does matter because the matches played affects the entire team not just the individual player.

Then to not know the order of the balls to work? I just can't seem to get my head around it.   The reason your operator didn't find a ruling is because he's not following the rules by using the wrong damn balls... and you just discovered the reason why you don't do that.   I'd assume that the rack was done improperly then since the ""9"" ball wasn't in the center position. I'd pony up $1.00 and rerack with a full rack of balls."

billiards,2xxl42,dalgeek,10,Wed Mar 4 18:33:26 2015 UTC,"I'd guess the problem lies in the glue used to install the tip. I feel like a properly-installed Kamui tip will withstand pretty much any kind of miscue without popping off.   Notice in the pic you posted that there is virtually no leather material still adhered to the end of the ferrule. This leads me to believe that the glue did not achieve a good bond with the plastic ferrule material. This could be caused by a couple different things, though. If the face of the ferrule was improperly cleaned and prepared, then even good glue will suffer from an inferior bond in that case. Also, super glue has a very short shelf life after the seal is broken. Super glue reacts with moisture in the air to ""polymerize"" or become solid. Super glue does not ""dry"" like water based glues, but it cures due to chemical reactions. Glue that has been opened for a while often seems to lose its potency and result in weaker bonds. Keep in mind my interpretation of how super glue works is a layperson's understanding of chemistry, to say the least. There are certain jobs that I have no fear of using old glue for, but tip installation always warrants opening a fresh tube for each job. Ferrule installation can be done with older super glue, as can installing inlays and most other major repair jobs. Tips seem to be much more prone to popping off when old glue is used, so I always open a fresh tube for each tip job.   If I could wager on the cause of this pop off, I'd bet on bad/old glue as the culprit.   I also have to agree with the comments that you should never break with a low deflection shaft. Predator shafts are extremely delicate, and they are much more prone to splitting, cracking, chunking, and ferrule damage when they are used to break with. You can get by if you are a medium-power ""control"" breaker, but I'd avoid using the LD shafts (especially Predator shafts) if you are more of a ""power breaker""."
billiards,2xxl42,gabrielleigh,2,Wed Mar 4 20:36:44 2015 UTC,"Gabrielleigh is mostly spot on with his info as usual. A few things I wanted to add about Cyanoacrylate (super glue) is that while it has great bonding strength it has very low shearing strength. Meaning a blow along the direction of the seam can pop it right off. Lean your cue on a table and let it slide off and hit the ground and the joint can be weak enough to pop off after the next break even if it doesnt pop off right then. All it needs is a little crack to work lose along the seam. Another common mistake is to spread the glue all over the tip then placing it instead of applying a low surface area ""bubble"" of glue then pressing the surfaces together. This can avoid accidentally allowing the glue to polymerize before it hits the other surface. In dryer climates it is recommended by Kamui that the installer apply ""the foggy breath"" to the surfaces like you are cleaning your sunglasses. This will apply a small amount of moisture to the surfaces to start the reaction."
billiards,2xxl42,RoadHustler,1 point,Wed Mar 4 23:06:45 2015 UTC,"Based on this it sounds like an installation issue.  I had the same tip put on my OB months ago and it's still fine (they both get the same playing time), but it was put on by a different person.  I am definitely more of a medium-power ""control"" breaker, even with my break cue I only hit in the range of 12-15 mph and when I use my playing cue I break a little lighter.  Thanks for the info!"
billiards,2xxl42,JMizzo,3,Thu Mar 5 01:17:54 2015 UTC,"With a capped ferrule it would typically be installation issues. How old was the tip? I break with my playing cue almost always, even though I have a few break cues. I also don't take anything off of it when breaking. Tip should hold up through breaking, just might mushroom a bit from the compression."
billiards,2xxl42,JMizzo,1 point,Wed Mar 4 19:16:22 2015 UTC,I had it installed about a month ago.  I play 3-4 nights a week and I'm not really a heavy hitter when it comes to breaking.  Didn't show any signs of trouble until that break.
billiards,2xxl42,thepottsy,3,Thu Mar 5 01:09:35 2015 UTC,"If you had it done by a repair guy he should warranty it, without question. The fact that the ferrule is capped helps your cause. Sometimes the ferrule being loose can pop the tip off, if it is uncapped. If the person doesn't warranty their work, you shouldn't have them do your cue work."

billiards,2xxl42,MaskedEngineer,2,Thu Mar 5 04:21:26 2015 UTC,"Highly unlikely your miscue was at fault.  I'm going with bad tip job, plus I've seen this happen before in person, and there is no way the shooter caused it.    Also, keep in mind the whole break cue thing is a relatively new thing.  There used to be no such thing."
billiards,2xxl42,Crunkbutter,1 point,Wed Mar 4 18:40:16 2015 UTC,"It could be either, but its no big deal. Just lightly sand the end of the shaft and bottom of the tip, score the tip a little with a razor, and glue it back on. Should be easy because it is already cut to the size of your shaft."

billiards,2xr80a,Pip_Pip,1 point,Tue Mar 3 16:45:38 2015 UTC,I doubt it's wax. One piece slate and hella hard. I think some of the cloth backing was left on when I pulled it off and that's why it's so hard. I could be wrong though. It just looks so easy from the pics on AZ billiards and the slate looks non scratched too. I'm barely getting ribbons from the glue like in their pics. I tried reghistering there to ask some mechanics cause I also wanted to know what kind of table it is but I'm still awaiting approval or something. Idk if I'll be able to do the propane torch thing. We have birds in that room and they're extremely sensitive to air pollutants. Thank you for your help though. I'll see if I can move them for a day or so to try it. I'm dreading having to flip the slate to do the bottom too.   One reason I think the too of the slate was glued besides the circle was that the bottom side is a light grey and the top is dark. Different textures too
billiards,2xr80a,Pip_Pip,1 point,Tue Mar 3 20:59:35 2015 UTC,I haven't heard of anyone successfully flipping a slate.  They are usually designed to be in one direction.  Not to say it doesn't exist though.    You wouldn't think someone would use wax on a one-piece but you never know.  I wouldn't use glue on felt but some do.  I'm not a table mechanic though so take my advice with a grain of salt.  I have just done my own tables for the last 10 years.
billiards,2xr80a,unoriginalsin,1 point,Tue Mar 3 21:20:42 2015 UTC,"I meant flipping it just to get the glue off the bottom. As it's a bar box there's no wood backing on the slate so I can't staple. I'm looking into methods where just the vertical edge is glued. That would be ideal but I need to make sure I have the right glue first. I have 3m fastbond 30nf from ozone for the cushions , but everywhere on AZbilliards says 3m fastbond 10 is what's used for slate. If I can't use the 30 I'm just gonna spray glue cause that's another $30-40 in glues that I won't use for 10 years"

billiards,2xqrjc,GotTheNumbers,4,Tue Mar 3 02:39:38 2015 UTC,You could always get a non-Lucasi shaft as well and stay under your budget.  I'll refrain from my personal opinions but there are a ton of options depending on what you are looking for out of the shaft.

billiards,2xqrjc,MaskedEngineer,1 point,Tue Mar 3 04:34:49 2015 UTC,Makes sense.. it's mostly about the shaft and tip. You could even get two for the price of a new cue... it's very convenient to have a spare if you play a lot.

billiards,2xqrjc,gotwired,1 point,Wed Mar 4 11:03:18 2015 UTC,"If your Lucasi has a common joint like a 5/16x14 or 3/8x10, a new shaft will be worth the money because you can use it on many future cues that you decide to buy if you ever grow out of your Lucasi and brand-name shafts like predator and OB with a common joint will have some resale value. If your Lucasi has some kind of proprietary joint like a uniloc, don't bother because the shaft will have no value if you ever decide you want something besides the Lucasi."
billiards,2xqrjc,gabrielleigh,1 point,Tue Mar 3 06:43:52 2015 UTC,"From my experience, it never hurts to have an extra shaft or two for your main playing cue. It doesn't matter at all if the inlays are cracking or popping out, or if the clearcoat is bubbling or peeling away from the cue. None of that affects the hit of the cue, and there is no reason to replace the butt unless you simply become so self-conscious about it that it begins to affect your mental game. If the blemishes in appearance don't really bother you, then I'd recommend purchasing an additional shaft for the cue.   Once you have a new shaft that you like, you can always have your local cue maker do some restoration and repair on your old shaft. Some people like to set up two different shafts for different games; a harder tip on one shaft for games that don't require as much english, and a softer tip for games requiring lots of english and such.   Other people like setting up two shafts to be as identical as possible so they can always have a ""backup"" shaft in case they pop a tip off or ding one up really bad during an important game. This can be a little hard to achieve when you have an old shaft and purchase a new one because the woods are likely quite a bit different, but a good cue maker can get them pretty darn close to being the same in most cases.   In any case, aside from taking up the extra room in your cue case, it is always nice to have a backup shaft ready to go on your cue in case of an emergency. Having your old shaft restored will also give you a ""benchmark"" that you are familiar with when you compare the hit and feel of any new shaft you purchase for the cue. Trying a new shaft on a different butt will feel a lot different, and it may be hard for your brain to pinpoint the exact differences since you are using both a different butt and a different shaft."

billiards,2xia91,croissantology,3,Sat Feb 28 23:19:05 2015 UTC,"8 or 9 makes a difference.  9 ball you should work on your break and try to make the 1 in the side, I'm sure there's lots of youtube videos.  In general if you don't think you're getting enough movement on your break think about when the peak of your power on your swing is and make sure that's when you're contacting the cue ball.  Also follow through, watch the pros break and the cue's collar usually passes their bridge, that's how much that stick is going forward.  If it's a short race in 8 ball though I'd probably just break medium though, trying to leave some clusters.  Nothing like breaking wide open and dry and having the other guy run out or take the easy side.  Work on your safeties, you're not going to do that in a week but ... if you're going to start playing in formats where you have to win a game, it's a must.  Also work on getting out of them.  Even a half safety of just leaving them long on an awkward angle or on the rail will play with their shot.  If it doesn't, they're good enough to beat you anyway so learn from them :)"
billiards,2xia91,wefolas,1 point,Tue Mar 3 02:24:32 2015 UTC,It's 8 ball. I'm going to focus more on my safety shots tomorrow. I think I'll work on breaking from the side of the table rather than the center because it seems like that's what the pros do. Thanks for the tips.
billiards,2xia91,ursusamer,2,Tue Mar 3 07:42:08 2015 UTC,"Stretching is a very important part of my routine and I always take five minutes to loosen up my wrists, neck, and waist before I play. My favorite stretch is one where I extend my arm to the side and level with my shoulder, bend my wrist so my fingers point straight upwards, and tilt my head the opposite direction. If done correctly I will feel the stretch from my jaw, through my neck/arm, and to the very tip of my middle finger. I will hold this stretch for 15 seconds and repeat as needed. This really helps keep my neck loose as I am like you in that I hold my head low and close to my cue when I shoot. Hope this makes sense to you as I try to be succinct on mobile.   Good luck in the tournament!"

billiards,2xhzoe,BioTiger,2,Sat Feb 28 21:45:00 2015 UTC,I'd recommend not spending more than $150. Any more than that and the marginal benefit is too small to make it worthwhile for a relatively new player.  I'd spend any extra money on a couple solid books.
billiards,2xhzoe,manfrotto26,1 point,Sun Mar 1 17:03:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.  As a new player, just having your own cue for consistency's sake is enough.  Over time you will have the opportunity to try out many different cues and develop a feel for what suits you best.  Meanwhile, it's time to build solid fundamentals and a consistent stroke and learn the game.  Check out Phil Capelle's ""Play Your Best ...."" series of books for a comprehensive look at the fundamentals, as well as basic and advanced strategy for games.  As for cues, there are a lot of solid choices for not much money.  Schmelke, Players HXT, McDermott (& Lucky), Viking (Valhalla), even Dale Perry offer great values at the lower price points."

Clearing a table is kind of similar.  BUT, that being said I'm not sure there is such a thing as being a perfect pool player (or sculptor, for that matter).  Every shot can be played differently, every table can be attacked differently, everything is subjective.  Some tables simply can't be played with artistry - often the only path to victory involves tact, disruption, and maybe even luck.  The only real truth in pool (or life) is self-improvement and wisdom.  Perfection is unattainable and pursuit of it is a fool's errand.

billiards,2xakhr,gabrielleigh,5,Fri Feb 27 06:37:30 2015 UTC,"With any scuffing tool, the tool cleaning method will depend primarily on the way the tool is made.   Some scuffers are made from billet or cast metal with the ""grit"" adhered to the inside of the tool. Some of these models use a circular paper grit pad that is glued into the metal cup. You should avoid using any water or soap to clean a tool that has a paper-backed abrasive pad that is stuck inside the metal cup. The moisture will cause the paper pad to swell and come apart. I use compressed air to clean these types of tools instead. Start with about 40 PSI and work your way up to maybe 60 or 80 PSI. Higher air pressure may cause the pad to separate and blow out of the tool. You can also use a wire brush with brass or aluminum bristles to break the chalk clumps up for easier removal with the air.   For tools that have the abrasive material permanently glued into the metal cup, most use a very hard epoxy which resists moisture quite well. Water generally does not hurt these tools, but using hot water can cause the epoxy and metal to expand at different rates and the epoxy can lose its grip on the metal surface causing cracks and chunks of the abrasive to fall out. Use room temp water to clean these tools. Soap is usually fine to use as well. You may want to avoid using water on stamped steel tools because of rusting.   The most durable and easiest to clean tools I have found are the Willard brand of scuffers. They use some electro-welding or sintering process to basically weld the abrasive particles into the cup. Mine is about 20 years old and is just as good as the day I got it. It is nickel plated (or something similar to that) and I blow it out with 120 PSI air pressure and it is clean and perfect."

billiards,2x81ke,hevin-karvick,8,Thu Feb 26 11:22:21 2015 UTC,"Properly done, a masse will do little, if any, damage. Burn marks may occur, but they occur with pretty much any power shot and aren't a big deal unless you are hitting the same shot in the same area over and over. Its the poorly hit masse's that cause significant damage like tears or holes, but practicing masse's will generally result in a number of poor hits, so your risk of doing damage increases the more you practice masse's."
billiards,2x81ke,gotwired,6,Thu Feb 26 11:59:47 2015 UTC,"Any shot that requires you to shoot downward on the ball with a lot of force will increase the rate at which the cloth wears out. It doesn't matter if it is the break shot, jump shots, masse shots, bouncing balls, or otherwise. These shots cause small, concentrated instances of heat and pressure and there is simply no way to avoid that in these circumstances. The combination of heat and pressure causes the cloth fibers to break and come loose, eventually the cloth shows signs of wear. You'll just have to acknowledge that shooting any of these shots will shorten the lifespan of the cloth in the long run. It is a trade-off that you'll have to accept for your own personal table, and it is a trade-off that the proprietor of the pool room will have to accept if they choose to allow these shots in their room. Personally, I consider these shots a natural part of the game. I encourage people to practice them and learn how to minimize the damage they cause by improving their technique. I have seen recommendations of using a ""pad"" made of recycled pool table cloth under the cue ball for practicing these shots, but I have found that using a pad really changes the effect of the shot and the ball does not respond in the same way as when the shot is attempted without the ""pad"". Also, in all practicality, you won't be able to pick up the cue ball and place a pad under it in league, tournament, or gambling circumstances anyway. I'd say you will be doing yourself (and everyone you play with) a big favor by honing your technique at home on your personal table so that your execution of these shots is as gentle and controllable as possible when playing in public places. Before you get your personal table recovered, take a few days to really test the limits of power and recklessness on the old cloth. You'll never have a better opportunity to see how the maximum power and english will affect shots than when you get to play on cloth that is going to be thrown in the trash soon anyways. You can fire away with no guilt or worry, and that is a rare opportunity in pool and it could really help you gain an understanding of the upper limits of force in your stroke and how they affect your shots!"
billiards,2x81ke,gabrielleigh,3,Thu Feb 26 16:58:19 2015 UTC,"Honest truly I don't think that I've ever needed a masse' in game play. I've only experimented with it fleetingly. To me, it's not a controllable shot. So I play without it. My reason for the question was setting the rules of the house. If I'm spending $5-700 on the table, I want it to last. The others that play there are youngsters. I don't want them learning bad masse's on a new felt.   That's a great idea though. Practicing rough shots on a soon to be replaced felt."
billiards,2x81ke,xmpx,2,Fri Feb 27 00:46:25 2015 UTC,"masse in game is something i've only pulled off a handful of times, and mostly horsing around.  a real masse shot is unlikely to be used because most people dont practice it.  how much easier would it be to jump, kick, etc.   i find a ""half-masse"" (where the cue is closer to 45 to 60 degrees instead of almost vertical."

billiards,2x81ke,RichardLeeOMG,2,Fri Feb 27 11:15:17 2015 UTC,"it's something i didn't really try for almost two years.  i was on a little masse bend, if you will, for a while, and then after making a few good shots i got over it.  recently have been practicing it, but just slightly.    dr dave has a great video about how to aim masse shots using the BAR method.  to put it quickly, there's three points you need to focus on, the contact point of the cue on the ball, the imaginary straight line through that point and onto the table, and then the resting point of the cue ball.  depending on how you aim the cue it will change the aiming reference line, and that's all it really it, a reference, but it's pretty darn close.    video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2XHxXypNWI"
billiards,2x81ke,MaskedEngineer,2,Fri Feb 27 13:27:52 2015 UTC,If you want to learn to masse' go to a billiards store and ask for a small square of felt. Put your cue ball and masse' off of that to learn. Sure it may still hurt the felt a little but it's better than doing it directly on the table felt. Also if you're planning on re-felting the table I would just go to town. =P

billiards,2x5sri,parlarry,2,Wed Feb 25 21:59:20 2015 UTC,Can I point out that pool has been on the decline since the 1920's when people played billiards mostly. By the mid 40's half of all pool rooms in the US were closed. New York city has allways required a license to operate a pool room. In the 20's (roaring 20's everyone partied like it was 1925) their were over 2000 licenses in nyc. It was once just what everyone did for fun. Like videogames or tv. What happened? After the 1929 crash people had less disposable income so rooms closed then it declined slowly until WW2 ended and everyone came home and made familys less time in the bar. As the popularity of tv increased everyone stayed home more and more. In 1960 the hustler helped a little then 20 years later the color of money bumped it in to the public eye for a minute. But now in america its a shadow of what it once was.
billiards,2x5sri,RoadHustler,3,Thu Feb 26 01:41:42 2015 UTC,"Detroit recreation  The Recreation Building opened Oct. 1, 1917, and was designed by the noted Detroit architectural firm of Smith, Hinchman & Grylls, known today as the SmithGroup. It cost $750,000 (about $12.8 million today, when adjusted for inflation) to build, and Sweeney-Huston dropped another $350,000 (about $6 million today) on outfitting the building. “This amount was invested,” the owners told The Detroiter in January 1919, “in response to the demand for a recreation center of the strictest moral tone and environment.”  The structure was erected by Porter Brothers Co. and was billed as “the largest building in the world devoted exclusively to billiard rooms and bowling alleys,” the Detroit Evening News noted in September 1917. The Detroit Chamber of Commerce hailed it as “the greatest recreational temple in the world.”  The seven-story Italian Renaissance-style building had four floors of bowling alleys with 22 lanes per floor — 88 in all — and a total of 103 billiards tables spread over two floors. The Detroiter noted in January 1919 that the tables were “the greatest number ever gathered in one building” and that the number of alleys formed “the largest department of this kind in the world.” This was an era where bowling was considered an upscale sport, when men wore ties and white shirts with sleeve garters. Pin boys set up the pins by hand as Detroiter after Detroiter rolled.  “Detroit owes a great debt of gratitude to those enterprising men who founded that Recreation Building,” businessman A.A. Higginson told The Detroiter in January 1919. “It is a great civic asset. It’s the recreational center of Detroit.”  The ground floor hosted a number of shops, including a shoe shine, drugstore, laundry, lunch counter and a hat shop. The building was littered with cigar stands and barber’s chairs, and patrons could cozy up to one of its many soda fountains for a Boston cooler or an ice-cold Vernors ginger ale. The Detroiter noted that the building’s motto was “Eat-Smoke-Shave-Rest and Play.”  http://www.historicdetroit.org/building/recreation-building/"
billiards,2x5sri,RoadHustler,2,Thu Feb 26 01:46:29 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think the game will get built up more locally than on a professional level. By that, I mean leagues and tournaments need to be set up to support as many players in a city, town, and state. I live in Montana, and I think we have an amazing thriving pool community. There's a little bit of drama, but that's based on how many people want to play, not how many people get excluded.  The internet needs to be utilized for this to happen. Each state needs to start tapping into all of their community resources at their hands to make people feel like they are a part of a group.  And if the professional players want to help that out, they need to start traveling to a lot of cities and build the audience on a face to face, person by person level. I don't think that's an easy task, but it's what I believe needs to be done.  That means they need to make it a point to step away from the 9 foot and 10 foot tables and play some bar box. Because that's what most people are playing on that play the game. If your area supports a lot of bigger tables, that's great. Then you probably get a lot out of seeing those big table matches. But that's not where the masses are.  I've mentioned this before, but I'm working on my own idea as to how to build onto the community in my area. And you'll be damned sure I'll let you folks know here when things get going. I look forward to your support honestly, and I look forward to giving all of you folks the same support in return."
billiards,2x5sri,RyanGoslingsCock,1 point,Thu Feb 26 05:18:46 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with the points your making. One thing I'd point out is that you say that the pool community in your are is thriving. How would you define ""thriving""? I'd say we have a large number of people playing pool in this area as well, but most people are you're typical apa player that really isn't getting much better, isn't learning much about the game, and isn't in it for much more than a night out. There used to be a niche community of serious players in my area that took the game seriously, but most of them have fallen away from the game or moved somewhere where the pool scene is more alive. I truly believe that a national PLAYER FRIENDLY, COMPETITVE league could usurp the APA, but I myself wouldn't know where to begin. I have plenty of ideas as far as rules and ways to make it work, but taking it any further than my local area seems daunting."
billiards,2x5sri,RyanGoslingsCock,1 point,Thu Feb 26 20:38:20 2015 UTC,"In this area I define thriving by the two biweekly tournaments that are held every Sunday. Two guys run a different one on alternating weeks. And the other random tournaments that people put together always seam to be successful IMO. So even just in the town I live in, we support a BCA and a VNEA (2 different skill leveled leagues in VNEA) season each year that don't overlap. And it looks like at least 3 new full teams are added every year in the lower vnea league.  I myself want to put together a 14.1 club, but am not sure how many people would actually become regular participants. I do know a bunch of people who enjoy that game, and also want to learn one pocket.  In the end, I think we have a really strong community here, and that's a big blessing."
billiards,2x5sri,snowman818,2,Thu Feb 26 23:25:22 2015 UTC,"Every sport is structured like a pyramid scheme. The occasional golfer supports the golf course, playing a couple times a month and buying range balls and beers at the nineteenth hole after paying for lessons. The club ace who only pays twilight greens fees doesn't. The skiers who only buy the pass at discount preseason rates don't keep the hill open, the four or five one day ticket with rental gear and lunch buying crowd does. The APA has its problems, but it sells beer and eats quarters while keeping the cue smiths busy installing tips on cues bought on Amazon. You're right, op, people aren't getting better, but most golfers never break 100, most skiers never run a double black clean, and most pool players will never run a table."
billiards,2x5sri,snowman818,1 point,Thu Feb 26 20:41:20 2015 UTC,What would you say has caused golf's popularity to soar and pool's to plummet?
billiards,2x5sri,khoker,1 point,Thu Feb 26 21:09:47 2015 UTC,"That's a great question and one I don't really have an answer to. I've noticed a recent uptick in the popularity of indoor virtual golf lately, and here in the cold wet northwest, that might have something to do with it. The problem with golf is that it's seasonal. Pool has dropped off a good amount. My favorite pool hall closed after they tried to compromise between being a quiet basement pool hall and a noisy strobe light pulsing dance club. Needless to say, I quit going and almost all the players quit too. Total waste of 8 Brunswick gold crown 9' tables. These days, like most people in this town, I play on bar boxes in bars with overly loud jukeboxes and drink specials more targeted to getting really drunk fast and cheap than being tasty or interesting. I think the venues, places like I just described, scare away people who aren't already into playing the game or aren't already hanging out in those bars. Some of that is branding and appearance, but a lot of it seems to do with venue. If given the choice, who wouldn't prefer to shoot in a clean, well lit place that was tailor made to host pool tournaments? But that's just me, and most may well disagree with me."
billiards,2x5sri,megapantsparty,1 point,Fri Feb 27 03:00:51 2015 UTC,"It's the same problem that bowling has -- the revenue cannot sustain the footprint.    Especially in more dense, urban areas.    APA, in more ways than one, is more geared for your typical bar than for the game itself.  You get 10 people out into a bar (on an off-night no less) where only 2 players can shoot at any given time.  It's a bar's dream come true -- an artificial line at the pool table and ~10 drinkers for a good 4-5 hours!     But as you've mentioned, APA doesn't make you all that much better.  It often punishes strong players.  That's the recipe for failure; pool halls are difficult to sustain and leagues like APA do not actively graduate players to go seek out higher competition."
billiards,2x5sri,AlMightyBawb,1 point,Wed Feb 25 22:08:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response. I'm multitasking at the moment, but my  two initial thoughts are:   When you refer to revenue, I think it's important to point out that it's everyone EXCEPT league operators that are suffering in the revenue department. The players competing in tournaments aren't making money like they should as well as pool hall operators. Those apa district operators sure aren't hurting though....  What about something similar to poker where players bought into bigger buy in tournament? The biggest issue with getting people to compete in bigger tournaments in the past was the worry that it would kill their gambling action. I just don't think this shark type attitude exists in the game anymore (at least not to that extent). This could be useful going forward as the youth of the game basically have a clean slate as far as hustling and it's affect on the game go."
billiards,2x5sri,Crayons1,2,Wed Feb 25 22:28:11 2015 UTC,"As you can tell I like to talk. But in looking at your response again, I feel it's important to address the impact of the apa on what you would refer to as strong players. I've seen enough myself that have just become frustrated with the pace of play, exorbitant fees that you almost never have a chance to get back, and the luck favoring rule set the apa uses, to the point that they have quit pool altogether. Maybe we need a countrywide league that encompasses the players that are better than most apa players, but not quite pro level?I have so many more things I want to address, but you definitely hit the nail on the head in many places."

billiards,2x5sri,jpalbarado,1 point,Thu Feb 26 20:40:04 2015 UTC,"Chess has no competing rule sets. Neither does snooker and that's part of why it's very much trending upwards with more events and money year on year right now.   Pool has 9ball, 8ball, 10ball, bar box tables, 10ft tables, Russian billiards, English pool, Chinese 8ball, 3 cushion and more. You could argue that the variety is a strength but in terms of unifying the game for acceptance on the world stage, you just find that  billiards is fractured, unfocused and no one game has had enough depth to lead the way and push things forward.   New variations are still emerging like bonus ball and American rotation. I think experimentation should be wholly encouraged but, as you know, it's not just the rules that are the problem."

billiards,2x49cn,Lxrge,3,Wed Feb 25 15:18:06 2015 UTC,I think the tight pocket craze is annoying. My two main issues with it are that pool should be fun and high runs are fun. And I feel that at a conditioning level we will learn more from success than failure. Tight pockets make you play like you are gonna miss. Instead of like a guy who can't miss. Don't teach yourself fear. But if you want to try tight pockets sometimes buy some of thoes spring loaded rubber pocket restrictors. They are fun sometimes.
billiards,2x49cn,RoadHustler,6,Wed Feb 25 20:31:32 2015 UTC,"If you are thinking of ""shimming"" the pockets on a new table, you bought the wrong damn table.  ""Shimming"" makes the corners of the pockets play terrible, even if they are tighter. The proper way to make tighter pockets is to extend the subrails and then the rubber to the proper geometry.  This work is like $1200, so if you're buying a new table that needs this done, then you're doing it wrong. You should just be buying a diamond in the first place (with the pro-cut pockets, if you want insanely tight pockets).  I'm not familiar with that brand, but beware of pockets that open too widely. Pocket geometry is a big deal. If they are too wide, they will just reject all balls that hit the facings. My previous table had pockets like this. Shimming such a table will tighten the pockets, but it won't correct the geometry so you won't be any better off.  The moral of the story is that a table really needs to be engineered for tight pockets from the get-go if that's what you want. That's why I'm wondering why you bought this table if it's not what you wanted..."

billiards,2x0gf0,RoadHustler,2,Tue Feb 24 18:53:48 2015 UTC,National billiard supply company name plate. But the name plate may be a replacement item from an older table. That name plate is from the radio craze of the early 20's. Everything was wireless back then the radio was cutting edge technology.   National was never part of Brunswick but it was purchased by AMF according to the Chicago billiard museum. If the base is original to the table it may have some inlay work under the paint as painting tables wasn't the custom back then labor was cheap.

Hasnt been in business for decades it was bought by AMF they were one of Brunswicks main competitors. But notice the wood repair on the edge of the name plate. I think someone added the plate later and it was probably a different company that made the table. That is a fairly common thing todo especially if you have a kick ass name plate like that one. Thoes plates are very collectable and nice ones like that are sought after.

billiards,2x0ujj,MrV2121,7,Tue Feb 24 19:43:38 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I have no idea whether any of the following is true or not.    The exact formula is a secret, but what I have been told is that your SL is determined by an average of your scores from your 10 BEST matches out of your last 20 matches.    Whatever range that average falls into determines your SL.  The ranges break down like this:    Skill Level Range    7 0.00 - 2.00   6 2.01 - 3.00   5 3.01 - 4.00   4 4.01 - 5.00   3 5.01 - 7.00   2 7.01 - 10.00    If you LOSE a match, you get a score that is calculated by the formula (innings - safeties) / # of games won.  If you WIN a match, you get assigned an ""applied score"".  It doesn't matter how many innings or safeties in the match, or any other factor.  The applied score is based on your cumulative win percentage and breaks down like this:    Skill Level Win % Applied Score    7 100 1.1   7 90 1.1   7 80 1.2   7 70 1.3   7 60 1.4   7 50 1.5   7 40 1.6   7 30 1.7   7 20 1.8   7 10 1.9   6 100 2.1   6 90 2.1   6 80 2.2   6 70 2.3   6 60 2.4   6 50 2.5   6 40 2.6   6 30 2.6   6 20 2.8   6 10 2.9   5 100 3.1   5 90 3.1   5 80 3.2   5 70 3.3   5 60 3.4   5 50 3.5   5 40 3.6   5 30 3.6   5 20 3.8   5 10 3.9   4 100 4.1   4 90 4.1   4 80 4.2   4 70 4.3   4 60 4.4   4 50 4.5   4 40 4.6   4 30 4.6   4 20 4.8   4 10 4.9   3 100 5.1   3 90 5.1   3 80 5.2   3 70 5.3   3 60 5.4   3 50 5.5   3 40 5.6   3 30 5.6   3 20 5.8   3 10 5.9   2 ALL 7    If this is correct, then if you win consistently, no matter how many innings or safeties are marked, you will eventually move up in SL because your applied score will fall within the range of the next SL up.  People's SLs fluctuate wildly when they are new because they don't have the history to stabilize the scores.  Once they reach 20 matches, it becomes much more stable.  I'm trying to test this information by making a stat sheet for my team to try to predict when they are bordering on moving up or down.  It will take some time to see any results though."
billiards,2x0ujj,garnerh42,1 point,Wed Feb 25 15:35:59 2015 UTC,"I'd be very interested in the results of said study.  It would really help, at least mentally, to know whether you are borderline about to move up or down.    Could actually be used to an advantage if you know you have a particular opponent coming up you'd like to either be able to move up or down for. (ie. say I'm a 5 on the border of moving down to a 4, and I know next week I'll be facing a 7 and it doesn't matter towards our match if I win or lose, I could lose or have a high inning count on purpose to change it to a 5-2 race against the 7)."
billiards,2x0ujj,RoadHustler,1 point,Wed Feb 25 16:29:26 2015 UTC,"When you say ""cumulative win percentage"" is that only for the last 20 games or your overall win percentage that APA keeps track of on the site?  I would think the former, but just trying to be precise.  Also, does the same formula apply for 9-ball?"
billiards,2x0ujj,unkn0wnEntity,2,Wed Feb 25 17:04:37 2015 UTC,"Those are good questions that I don't have the answer for.  I think you're probably right though and cumulative win percentage means how many games won vs. lost over your last 20 matches.  I would think that 9 ball would have the same general idea and basic structure, but a different range and Applied Score structure since it has more possible SLs, and a different formula due to it not being scored by the game like in 8 ball."

billiards,2x0ujj,parlarry,2,Wed Feb 25 20:49:42 2015 UTC,I started playing APA for the first time. We are 7 weeks into the session.   I started as a 4. I lost the first week to a 2 (I won 2 games) and the second week to a 6 (I won 1 game).   After that I moved down to a 3. Since then I have only lost 1 game and am still a 3 after playing a total of 6 matches.  Of these 4 match wins I've only played SL 3s or SL 4s.   From what others on my team have said is the SL is based off innings / safeties and the SL of the person you are playing.   So I'm not sure how often people change SL but so far only 1 other teammate and myself have gone down. Also I have the least number of matches played on my team as well.   I also don't understand the chart either lol I'm still new to APA.

Just don't get all the hate!"
billiards,2wwhn4,warmcereal,3,Mon Feb 23 22:31:08 2015 UTC,"I really don't get it either. 9 Ball is a non-call game anyway, but you're going to win a lot more games if you practice good cue ball control and table planning. I've seen many rack'n'smackers die fiery deaths on the tables at my local bar. My comment is more in regards to my skill to luck ratio my first season, and not a commentary on APA or their players.   If you lost a game to someone that plays slop, you either didn't take them seriously enough or you aren't as good as you think. But that isn't APA's fault."
billiards,2wwhn4,I_Am_The_Mole,2,Tue Feb 24 00:53:15 2015 UTC,"The best way that I am able to put it is that I do not believe you should be rewarded for luck.  If you miss your shot, you should concede your turn. Edited for missing a word."
billiards,2wwhn4,BRLKHH,15,Mon Feb 23 22:46:45 2015 UTC,"There is no question that calling ball-pocket is objectively more fair as it removes luck.  That being said, it actually makes sense for the APA to allow slop.  It's a good idea.  The main reason why is that the APA is a mostly a bar league.  Playing conditions are often loud in a busy space, and of course alcohol consumption is the norm.  I personally only drink after I am done playing my match, but that is not typical at all.  Much of the way that APA rules are structured are so that the possibility for a dispute is minimized.  Allowing slop is case-in-point, but there are many other rules that exist not because it is the best rule for pool, but because it minimizes the occurrence of disputes.  Even when you are shooting on the 8 ball, you don't actually call the pocket in APA.  You have to place a physical marker (can be anything, a cell phone, a cigarette lighter, etc.) by the pocket you intend the 8 ball to pot in.  This is of course to minimize disputes.  Not having to call ball-pocket for every shot also speeds up the game.  Keep in mind that you have to have low ranked players on an APA team.  The skill level ranges from 2-7.  The average male player is a 4.  You must play five players a night.  Even playing five players with a skill level of 5 per night is illegal (total of all player skill levels must be 23 or less).    Low ranked players obviously take many more innings to clear a table.  Requiring ball-pocket will drag these matches out even more.  APA is a great league and certainly the best league to start playing pool in a structured competitive fashion.  The APA puts sportsmanlike play above all else, and that's the most important thing for a new player to learn first.  It's a fun league where players of all skill levels can get together and have fun while still being competitive.  Many players get to a higher skill level and move on from the APA, and that's just fine.  If you want to take the game more seriously, you can move to another league that uses rules that require you to call ball-pocket.  Calling ball-pocket is the way to go for leagues that play in pool halls.  It's just not a good idea for playing league in a noisy bar."

billiards,2wwhn4,Hotwir3,4,Tue Feb 24 00:56:05 2015 UTC,"There are three elements to a legal shot, and then two elements to a legally pocketed ball, in WPA, BCA and BCAPL rules  Legal Shot:   Clean contact between cue tip and cue ball (no double hits or pushes, no disturbing other balls besides cue ball) First contact between cue ball and a legal object ball (in this case the 8-ball is the legal object ball). After contact between cue ball and object ball, at least one ball on the table hits a rail or falls into a pocket.   Failure to complete all three elements is a foul that results in ball in hand anywhere on the table for the incoming player.  Legally pocketed ball:   Called Ball (doesn't have to be the object ball hit by cue ball, but must still be a legal ball to pocket. For instance pocketing the 2 ball by hitting the 1 ball into it. You must call 2 ball, but don't need to say anything about the 1 ball). Called Pocket (call what pocket your called ball will go into. The details such as kisses, caroms, banks or combos do not need to be called or specified. And other object balls falling into pockets is not a foul in American pool under any official rules.)   Failure to legally pocket a ball means end of inning/turn.  The 8-ball follows all the same rules as prior shots, and as long as the 8 is on the table the game is not over.  Read that again, as long as the 8-ball is on the table the game is not over.  Ways to lose the game:   Pocket the 8-ball early (not as a separate shot after you have cleared your group). Pocketing the 8 into a pocket you didn't call. Pocketing the 8 on the same shot as a foul occurring (like wrong ball first, double hit, or scratching) Knocking the 8 off the table over a rail.   But simply fouling/scratching while shooting at the 8 ball is not game over.  It only gives ball in hand anywhere on the table, just like all fouls before it.  There is only one way to win the game:  Legally pocket the 8-ball without fouling into a called pocket as a separate shot after clearing the table of your assigned group."

I.e., are slops supposed to be respotted, or is that only end of turn?  I was surprised to actually not find this information on the WPA rules list."
billiards,2wwhn4,llbad,2,Tue Feb 24 04:33:15 2015 UTC,"No balls are ever respotted after the break. If the 8 ball goes in on the the break there is an option to respot the 8 or rebreak given to the player. That is because making the 8 on the break is neither a win nor a loss under WPA, BCA or BCAPL rules.   So ""slop"" shots like extra balls falling or making the wrong ball or having a ball go in the wrong pocket, they all stay down. Spotting balls is not a part of 8 ball. (unlike one pocket where balls get spotted often)."

billiards,2wwhn4,wheelsno3,2,Tue Feb 24 17:03:31 2015 UTC,"In 8 ball, Most leagues and competitive events are call pocket.  What may be confusing is amongst skilled shooters, most shots are obvious enough that you don't need to communicate your intentions.  The uncommon/low percentage shots, the 8 ball, and safeties* are called of course.  It's just another of those unwritten laws in pool etiquette.   Not all safeties need to be called. I often don't call safe if I'm playing lockup and I don't drop a ball.  Also, the good ol' boys playing bar rules don't like safes much so it's better to just intentionally miss sometimes."
billiards,2wwhn4,Appetite_TDE,3,Tue Feb 24 02:42:23 2015 UTC,"I have a friend like this. Extremely lucky all the time, like every other shot. The only problem is the 8 ball for him, since he has to call the pocket. When the balls go in, it is almost never the pocket he was aiming at. As a result, he almost always lose for potting the 8 ball in the wrong pocket. Very entertaining to watch."

The Gandy Big G is also a commercial table that plays very well.  Gabriels makes a hell of a nice table but they are not easy to find, and usually aren't cheap.  For furniture-style tables, there are so many on Craigslist that you'd have to be crazy to buy new.  Peter Vitalie tables have by far the highest quality and sturdiest construction of any furniture table.  Kasson and Olhausen also make decent tables as well so you can keep on the lookout for them.  There are lots of deals out there but you'll need to be patient to find a good one for only $500.  You can find one of the above for that price, but it will probably need work like refinishing or acquiring missing parts.  Remember also that moving, leveling, refelting, new cushions, etc. will at least double that price so that needs to be factored into your budget."

Dale apparently used to build expensive and high quality cues but switched to the eBay mass-production model where both his price, and his quality control took a nose dive.  The fit & finish and attention to detail just aren't there anymore.  He uses nice looking woods still and all his cues are technically ""one of a kind"" (although he just cycles through different combinations of inlays, woods and ringwork so they all look very similar).  I sold the first two to guys in my league that were buying their first cues.  Both still have them and still like them.  I bought a third that I use as a bar beater cue.  It looks nice and plays well.  I personally think Dale gets a bad rap because he screwed the resale value on his original cues.  IMO they're a lot of bang for the buck.  All that said, I wouldn't pay more than $130 shipped for one."

The balls are then placed according to the referee’s assessment, and play continues according to specific game rules as if no locking or jawing of balls had occurred."

I've seen two balls get stuck between the points of a corner pocket, making it almost impossible to pocket one (I assume if you hit one dead-on at warp speed to bend the cushion it may have worked), and it always made me laugh just seeing the cue ball deflect off of the barricade that would usually take another shot or two to loosen. Never seen two balls get stuck like that in the pocket though, that's pretty funny."
billiards,2wtb9g,PulseAmplification,1 point,Mon Feb 23 01:44:22 2015 UTC,"http://www.wpa-pool.com/web/the_rules_of_play#8.3  8.3 Ball Pocketed   A ball is pocketed if it comes to rest in a pocket below the playing surface or enters the ball return system. A ball near the brink of a pocket partly supported by another ball is considered pocketed if removal of the supporting ball would cause the ball to fall into the pocket.  If a ball stops near the edge of a pocket, and remains apparently motionless for five seconds, it is not considered pocketed if it later falls into the pocket by itself. See 1.7 Balls Settling for other details. During that five second period, the referee should ensure that no other shot is taken. An object ball that rebounds from a pocket back onto the playing surface is not a pocketed ball. If the cue ball contacts an already pocketed ball, the cue ball will be considered pocketed whether it rebounds from the pocket or not. The referee will remove pocketed object balls from full or nearly full pockets, but it is the shooter’s responsibility to see that this duty is performed."

As I said, I'd like to get the best cue in terms of function before splurging on things like aesthetics. I don't need pearl inlay, but I want a cue that is going to really get the job done. I just want to know everything I need to know about cues so I can make an informed purchase."
billiards,2wt3z7,ZombieDiesel,1 point,Sun Feb 22 23:24:50 2015 UTC,Have you always played with house cues?
billiards,2wt3z7,ZombieDiesel,2,Sun Feb 22 23:27:47 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. I grew up with a regulation size table in my parents house, we got it when I was about 10 (i started learning the very basics when I was 8). I've played religiously ever since they got that table, i'm 29 now. My cue there was a 1 piece house cue, but it was a solid wood, evenly weight distributed cue. It wasn't great, it wasn't terrible.  So, I had ""my"" cue at the house, and have since had several crappy -decent pool cues. I actually have a pretty decent pool cue right now (it's about a $200 viking) but I'm not sure I'm happy with it, although it might just be the tip. The tip is extremely hard, and I'm used to a soft leather tip.  What I want to know is things like what are the different types of tips, and what's the difference between them? What's the difference in what kind of wood you use? What's the difference between different cue ferrules? Etc. I just want to know everything I need to know about cues and how they, and their different aspects, effect my shot.  I mean, I think I can probably just buy a new shaft and tip, and probably be happy."
billiards,2wt3z7,ZombieDiesel,2,Sun Feb 22 23:36:31 2015 UTC,"Well if you want an upgrade from there I am a huge advocate of Jacoby cues. It's my preference. That's the thing, it's all preference. I like wood to wood joint over steel, I like g2 tips over every thing else (can't stress this enough), and I like Cocobolo for aesthetics. Your biggest thing as far as feel goes is going to be the joint, the shaft, and the tip. Different butts do feel a bit different but weight distribution is key there. A good maple shaft is key (I don't play with laminated shafts so no help there). Ferrule is tricky for me because I don't use very many variance there. Again people on here ""should"" help more than me but hopefully I got you started."

billiards,2wt3z7,ZombieDiesel,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:02:30 2015 UTC,"ok, so you and I have very similar tastes in cue. I like minimalism. That cue is beautiful. I'm having a hard time seeing how it pieces together, though. It's not your typical screw...  Also, what's the difference between a jump cue, break cue, and play cue? From the sound of it, break cues are just cheaper? As for jump cues, I can't figure it out.  edit: Ignore that part about not fitting together. I only saw the part with the two black caps on it."
billiards,2wt3z7,JMizzo,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:08:34 2015 UTC,Break cue is usually heavier than playing cue and with harder tip. Jump cue is short and super light. Google predator air 2. There is some youtube videos also. Yes I like simple cues. This cue is amazing to play with. A really nice wood to wood sneaky Pete from a reputable cue Smith would be just fine. Still expensive but simple and will play great. Look for jacoby sneaky petes or even better. Cocobolo is beautiful to me. Hard to find a prettier wood. Thank you for the compliment. I played with a cue dealer a while back. He was playing with a 2000 dollar cue. He picked my jacoby up on accident and played the rest of the rack not even realizing it was mine.

billiards,2wn4ts,TheJawsofIce,5,Sat Feb 21 09:12:05 2015 UTC,"The best advice I can give for cue selection is to get something like you have now, a ~$100 or less cue.  In the beginning its all about having a consistent experience to hone your fundamentals.    While you are laying down the training, play with everyone's cue around you.  Land at a nice sized hall and make friends!    I ended up with my Schon in this exact way.  Hit balls with a dozen cues and found that one just spoke to me.  Friend wanted to move it and I made an offer.  Had he not, I was already researching picking up one for myself.  If only I could have talked my other friend out of one of his Gina cues...  holy cow the hit on that baby...  I guess this was a roundabout way to explain my point of... cues are different.  Don't let a brand name or high price tag fool you into thinking its an upgrade for you.  Everyone's arm is different - find the best fit for yourself through experiments!  In your case, you seemed to dig the Lucasi, so maybe explore that avenue a bit.  Like /u/KeeFyBeeFy said, manufacturers have different 'known' qualities.  Simply ID what you like about the cue you played and log it.  Keep looking till you find one that fits your style and feels good in your hand."
billiards,2wn4ts,bajunio,1 point,Sat Feb 21 15:41:55 2015 UTC,Excellent advice!
billiards,2wn4ts,gabrielleigh,3,Sat Feb 21 17:42:54 2015 UTC,"A lot of people overthink cues. Here's the simple version -  The #1 difference is that cheap uses use a shiny coating or laminate on the shaft that makes it sticky, it fails to glide smoothly through the fingers. You gotta work a little harder to swing the stick.   When you finally play with a decent shaft, it doesn't have the shiny sticky stuff on it, and glides smoothly. Imagine if you had to drag a mini trailer behind your car for months and suddenly one day it was removed and your car drove normally.   Other than that, there's the wrap, and of course there's a psychological difference.  Also, some very popular shafts have a slightly narrower tip at the end, and for some people it feels great... like you can hit the cue ball more accurately, like your fingers wrap around the cue more easily without chafing, etc.  I'd like to offer advice I wish I'd gotten when I first started. 99% of how the cue feels and plays is in the shaft, the butt is just a tube-shaped weight that you can grip. So when you go shopping for cues, you can buy a butt based solely on the looks. Then get the shaft for its performance.   Another bit of advice, which can sometimes cause arguments, but really shouldn't: Get a low deflection shaft. Predator and OB make the most popular ones. They're about $200. They aren't absolutely necessary to play great pool, but they DO make learning and playing slightly easier. You can get them in a variety of joint types so they can fit any butt you want, including your $100 Players cue. With that kind of shaft attached to just about any butt, you can have a cue that plays as well as anything on earth."
billiards,2wn4ts,CreeDorofl,2,Sat Feb 21 21:21:21 2015 UTC,"Another bit of advice, which can sometimes cause arguments, but really shouldn't: Get a low deflection shaft.   There was a video I saw on YT (I think it may've been a TAR vid) where a pro (I think it was Mike Dechaine) spoke about switching to a low deflection shaft late in his career. He said it sucked. Not the LD shaft itself, but the transition.  My take away from that was to advise newer players to go ahead and pick one up as soon as they could reasonably afford to buy one. If you learn with a simple wood shaft, you're going to have a bad time changing to LD and should probably avoid it if you've been shooting seriously for more than a few years."
billiards,2wn4ts,unoriginalsin,1 point,Sun Feb 22 07:27:27 2015 UTC,"yes! this is exactly right. I felt like it was 2 months before I could make balls normally again. But I was glad I made the switch and I wish I'd done it earlier, instead of burning certain lines of aim into my memory and then having to erase them and figure out new lines of aim. I was lucky to do it in the first couple of years but wish it coulda been from day 1."
billiards,2wn4ts,CreeDorofl,1 point,Sun Feb 22 16:00:40 2015 UTC,"How a cue plays is impacted heavily by how the how the butt is weighted and balanced with the shaft. I play with a 17.6oz cue which is neutral balanced. What that means is it doesn't feel like a 17.6oz but lighter. Most people who try my cue can't play with it cause of the ""lack of weight""."
billiards,2wn4ts,KeeFyBeeFy,1 point,Thu Feb 26 08:18:59 2015 UTC,"well, that's probably not just due to the balance, 17.6 is actually light. 19's the most common weight.   I would advise people get the weight they like, but wanted to stress the idea of '""don't overthink it"". People get some funny ideas about the importance of a half ounce or the exact balance point. No offense intended, I just truly believe nobody ever missed a ball because they were stuck with standard balance."
billiards,2wn4ts,CreeDorofl,2,Thu Feb 26 14:02:37 2015 UTC,"A small part of it is knowing that you're using what you think is a nicer cue. The cost of cue parts I believe rises at an exponential rate, so we get a false idea of how much better a cue is. However, that doesn't stop you from thinking you have an awesome cue, and then you feel more confident with it. Since there's more confidence, you're not letting the other things that you normally worry about cloud your mind while you're shooting"
billiards,2wn4ts,iWearNoHat,1 point,Sun Feb 22 12:56:19 2015 UTC,"All sorts of differences.   Most important is the quality of the shaft wood, the taper (lucasi is known to be a bit more whippy, whilst players stiff) and the balance + weight of the cue.  Then the joint type and material provides the feel. Metals are harder feel , phenolics are medium and wood 2 wood soft (debatable, some hard woods used as joints could be harder then phenolics)"
billiards,2wn4ts,KeeFyBeeFy,2,Sat Feb 21 11:10:46 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Regarding the joints, could I put a ""spacer"" in between my joint of a different material to achieve a different feel?"

You can get used to any cue, sure the modern shafts have way less deflection, but, once you find ""your cue"" it can be any cue, 100$ or 10k."
billiards,2wn4ts,mxpower,1 point,Sat Feb 21 18:15:49 2015 UTC,"There is virtually no correlation between the ""feel"" of the cue and the cost of the materials used to build it. The way a cue ""feels"" and hits is largely determined by the profile of the shaft, the style of joint, and the overall weight and balance of the cue's design. The relative expense of the materials has little to do with whether you will like or dislike the overall feel of the cue and the way it plays.   The cost of the cue is also largely based on the demand and reputation of the maker or manufacturer, and the price often reflects the maker's commitment to high standards of construction methods, good customer service, and the use of properly-prepared materials to build the cue.  A cue made quickly from poorly-prepared wood will have the same ""feel"" and hit as a cue made from the same woods which have been carefully dried and prepared, the difference will manifest in the ability of the cue to resist warpage, shrinkage, and other consequences of using poorly-prepared woods and materials. I know this from experience, because early in my cue building career I built some (in my opinion) fairly pretty pool cues that eventually warped and shrunk and developed other problems due to my failure to properly age and prepare the woods used in their construction.   So sometimes the higher price for cues can be related to the extra time, effort, and patience that goes into preparing the materials and building the cue. Sometimes the price difference is simply due to brand recognition and has nothing to do with the process of building the cue at all. Like several others have said, you simply need to try to identify the specific things you like and dislike about different cues you get to play with. Over time, most people begin to notice a trend of characteristics of pool cues that seem to positively impact their game. I have picked up old warped house cues that hit like heaven, and I have tried out thousand dollar customs that played like garbage to me. I tend to not base my expectations of a cue's compatibility with my preferences based on the price tag.   Once you have developed a list of characteristics you like about pool cues, then you can begin to identify certain brands and makers who tend to build cues that fit your preferences."

billiards,2wnf9b,Liquidicity,2,Sat Feb 21 13:37:19 2015 UTC,Took me about a year and 3 months before I could consistently have a few runouts each time I play. I played about 5 times a week for two hours each day for that year and 3 months.

Some people will get lucky and have a complete Mickey Mouse runout early on in their career, others have to wait a while until their skill catches up or they get lucky on the break. Break and runs don't really denote skill for lower level players because they happen too scarcely to actually matter in a match."
billiards,2wnf9b,gotwired,2,Sat Feb 21 16:43:49 2015 UTC,At 4 months you likely need better cue control to set up your runouts. Work on that instead! A great way to jump-start this is to play the game backwards: carom the object balls off the cue ball and into the pocket.
billiards,2wnf9b,MaskedEngineer,1 point,Sun Feb 22 06:59:25 2015 UTC,"Never give up mate. If you enjoy the game and want to keep getting better, keep at it.  I've been taking my game seriously for longer than you have, and I've yet to have a break and run in a game. It's also one of my personal milestones. In the beginning, I focused on a good stance and a consistent stroke. After that my focus was on pocketing balls. I was doomed working on position play, but missing a lot of my shots. I worked on pocketing balls before trying to get a handle on English, draw and follow. Mostly because I would screw up a lot of shots trying too hard to get good cue ball action. So I want back to the drawing board and devoted myself to hitting center cue ball, and simply pocketing balls.   I tried to learn, and pay attention to the natural angle that the cue ball wants to go when you hit center ball and put aside fiddling with English to alter that angle until I'm stronger at the fundamentals.  I split up pocketing balls into cutting, rail shots, banking, etc. Pretty early on I realized that stopping the cue ball was a very important skill. I think it's the first step to becoming strong with position play. I notice that when I hit the cue ball bit low, it forces my stroke to be a little cleaner with less of a chance of getting unintended left or right action. It's probably not like that for everyone, but for me, I'm starting to be able to better control and predict where the the white will end up.  Good luck and keep at it."

billiards,2wip8h,Lxrge,2,Fri Feb 20 05:28:17 2015 UTC,"I convert playing cues into jump and jump/break cues all the time. It is a simple process for a cue builder to do, and can be done for about $50 in some cases. You decide where to add the second joint, and the butt is cut in half at that point. Joint collars are strongly recommended to be added at the second joint, and a joint pin is drilled and tapped for the second joint. The cue will need to be refinished in some cases, and that can add some additional expense to the job.   All in all, it is usually an easy job and the only trouble I have ever encountered is when trying to convert import cues that are manufactured with the ""pot metal"" molten slugs of metal inside the handle to add weight to the cue. I have found these slugs of metal located right where the second (jump) joint is located, and they add a lot of hassle to the job. Sometimes a threaded connecting screw is located there as well.   A simple house cue conversion can be done very cheap, but converting a fancier cue is usually a bit more expensive because of the ringwork, clearcoat, and other potential extra steps needed to do the job correctly."
billiards,2wip8h,gabrielleigh,1 point,Fri Feb 20 15:47:50 2015 UTC,"Very interesting answer. I always thought that the shaft of a Jump cue is harder than of a normal cue. I thought that the ""hard maple"" which is used in Mezz Jump/Break cue (or Predator Jump cue) is different from the common ""maple"" used in normal playing shafts.    Am I wrong?"
billiards,2wip8h,nusi42,5,Mon Feb 23 17:17:10 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of different species of maples, some are naturally harder than others. Another factor that contributes to the ""hardness"" of the wood are the growing conditions and environmental factors that occur during the lifespan of the tree. A hard maple growing in Canada will have different properties than the same species growing in Florida.   The terms ""hard maple"" and ""rock maple"" are common names for various species of maple tree and I believe they are often used more as marketing terms than anything else. Some maple species are considered softwoods and are rarely used in cue building. Silver maples are one species that are common in my area, and are essentially only really used for furniture and firewood.   Maple that grows very slowly in cold, drier climates will put on annual growth rings which are thin and often very close together. Maple trees that grow in sunnier, moist climates can put on annual growth much faster and the rings are often much thicker. Some cue  makers claim that the super-tight growth ring patterns found in the slower growing cold climates are preferable for making cues. I am somewhat ""on the fence"" about this. I have had plenty of very tight grained maple with high ring counts per inch, and I have liked using it just fine for my shafts and butt parts. I have also had maple with wide, fat growth rings that was just as pleasant to work with. Each tree will have different characteristics, and even trees in the same grove might have different growth patterns and ""feel"" different when harvested and turned into pool cues. A tree growing on the sunny side of the slope might put on new growth in a much different way than the tree in the shaded valley on the other side of the hill.   I'd be wary of any claims from major cue manufacturers that their maple is ""harder"" or ""better"" than the competition. I find it to be difficult to make sweeping generalizations about stuff like that, and I tend to make judgements on wood on a board-by-board basis. Is ""harder"" even actually the same as ""better""? I don't think so at all, necessarily. I play in the ballpark of the skill level of a BCA 10 speed on most days. I play with one of the softest of the softwoods, a shaft made of super lightweight poplar wood, 11.43 mm diameter with a super-stretched pro taper. I have one of the lightest, whippiest shafts I have seen (2.1 ounce shaft weight). I can easily stick my fingernail deep into the raw poplar wood if I wanted to. I surface-harden the shafts after final sanding with an acrylic finish to make them more resistant to dents and dings, but the underlying wood I use is about as soft as balsa wood. For break shafts and jump shafts, I prefer the heavier and much harder exotic woods like bloodwood, ipe, purpleheart, and the other super-heavy exotics. American hedge (osage orange) is also fantastic for jump or break shafts. Dymondwood and other comparable laminate products are great for break and jump shafts, too. I can jump and break just fine with a regular maple shaft, but the added weight and density found in some of the exotic species takes a bit of strength out of the stroke needed to jump a ball. If I have two dimensionally-identical shafts, one of maple and one of bloodwood, I'd guess it takes about 10% more stroke strength to jump the same shot than with one of the exotic shafts. Gravity helps a lot, considering many of my exotic break and jump shafts weigh between 5 and 6 ounces. I also think less energy is lost to vibration and converted to heat energy with the exotics, too. More of the energy input by your arm makes it to the cueball, in my opinion. I'd love to be able to conduct some experiment to measure the precise forces needed to jump with the different woods, but I don't have the equipment or knowledge to do that right now. All of my opinions are simply ""gut feelings"" and based purely on subjective casual observations which carry no scientific or statistical value, really.   The closest thing I have done to actually measuring shaft characteristics (aside from physical dimensionsal comparisons) is when I built my G-Flex tool to measure the amount of flex a shaft experienced with a 16-ounce weight suspended on a rolling fixture in the middle of the length of the shaft. I could suspend the one pound weight at the midpoint of the shaft, and a magnetic dial indicator base would measure how far the shaft flexed under the weight. I could then rotate the shaft to see how the flex measurement changed depending on the orientation of the shaft. I found that most shafts seemed to flex farther when the feathers of the grain were oriented up and down. When the spine of the shaft was up and down, the flex distance was less in most cases. I had thought that when trying to build a shaft that was identical to an existing shaft, I could duplicate the dimensions of the shaft and then weigh the shaft and compare the flex measurements to hopefully find a shaft blank that matched the original shaft. I was very much surprised how different blanks varied in flexion so much. Blanks cut from the same plank of wood were all very similar, but planks cut from different boards (different trees, essentially) would often measure quite differently under the G-Flex meter, even if they were the same species of wood. Keep in mind that ""flex"" is a much different term than ""deflects"" and ""deflection"" which are common marketing buzzwords which I feel like consumers should be careful with. The simple rig I made to test flex has nothing to do with testing for deflection. Deflection is an effect that happens to the ball that is hit with a shaft, and is much different than the measurement of how a shaft flexes under a bending force.   There are certainly harder maples than others, for sure. Many makers and manufacturers will often cut break and jump shaft profiles with a little more wood through the middle of the shaft, and this has a dramatic effect on how ""hard"" the shaft feels. Jump and break shafts often are quite a bit stiffer than playing shafts, but for the most part this is due to the taper style and ferrule/tip style than any characteristic of the raw lumber used. Adding or removing a few thousandths of an inch to the thickness of a taper can have a huge impact on how the shaft feels."

billiards,2wip8h,gabrielleigh,1 point,Mon Feb 23 23:58:35 2015 UTC,"If you want a break cue you can just put an incredibly hard tip on it (phenolic or bakelite).

billiards,2wip8h,Pip_Pip,1 point,Fri Feb 20 07:46:32 2015 UTC,"As others mentioned, the tip is the most important part. If you have a soft tip, it's realistically impossible to jump any usable height. That's the major distinction of what makes a break cue.   I've heard of there being Predator BK2 conversions into jump/break, but they seem to be rare and demand quite a premium. I quickly found that the BK2 shaft is my favorite to jump with, so I bought a Lucasi Air Hog for the butt end and stashed away the native shaft."
billiards,2wip8h,asamimasa,1 point,Fri Feb 20 08:39:29 2015 UTC,"Edit: added details.  What makes a jump cue a jump cue is the rigid shaft and it being very light weight not to mention a very hard tip sometimes phenolic if not a very hard leather.  This is why a jump cue is shorter (39""), for reducing the weight.  This is why good players (I did it a few times too) can take just the shaft of a cue which is about 29"" and jump a ball with only a toothpick's distance between.  There's videos on YouTube showing this.  I think some even have Larry Nevel.   But most leagues/tournaments won't allow cues less than 39"" or may not even allow jump cues at all.  This is why top pros use a very light cue with a hard tip.  Earl Strickland is completely against jump cues.  He feels they are cheating.   If you want a Jump/Break cue a good cue smith can split the handle and put a joint in it.  But most break cues are shorter than normal, like 57"" vs. a standard cue which is 58"".  Plus, as stated earlier, they have a thicker shaft and a less of a pro taper to give it rigidity."
billiards,2wip8h,FreeThinker76,1 point,Fri Feb 20 16:50:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, but just using it as a dedicated break cue and buying a cheap jump cue for $50 would work 10x better and not risk turning the cue into firewood should you mess up, which you probably will if you are doing it yourself and have to ask a question like this."

Break effectiveness is all about how fast the cue ball is moving when it hits the rack (assuming you hit the rack squarely, of course).  In order to move the ball fast, you need to accelerate the cue stick.  The lighter the stick is, the easier it is to accelerate, and therefore the faster it will be moving when it hits the cue ball.  My suggestion is to use an 18 oz stick or lighter as your break stick -- with a very hard tip (phenolic if your league / tournament will allow it).  You can find more information here and here."
billiards,2wdzyg,mkglass,5,Thu Feb 19 19:50:20 2015 UTC,"This is not entirely true.  Break effectiveness is not all about how fast you move the cue stick - it is about how much force you generate with your arm minus how much force you lose in the transfer of force through the cue and cueball and into the rack.   The muscle strands that cause the twitch motion, unless trained specifically, will be the limiting factor here.  You can only accelerate your arm to a maximum speed and then you the average person plateaus.  The best break stick for maximizing force is going to be the lightest stick that is heavy enough to prevent  you from reaching this plateau.    For the average player this is a cue that is between 19-21oz.  also having a heavier stick slows down your stroke allowing for more control over your actions.  This will give you the second (and most important) part of a break shot and that is control enough to leave your cue ball center table and pocket an object ball.  the function for force out of a break stroke uses the mass of the cue as a multiplier thereby allowing one to get the same force out with a slower more controlled stoke using a heavier cue.  Also of note is that there are few (read: none) top pros that use a breakstick lighter then 18oz  Both of the sources cited above exemplify my points - the first article talks about heavier vs lighter in the part about baseball bats - the second article clearly shows the mathematical equations that show mass as a multiplier to acceleration with regard to break force.  Its all there to read for yourself.  Finally, A phenolic tip would be the best for energy conservation as it moves through the cue and into the cue ball but completely blows your control ability - once you get your break down you will want to put spin on the cueball to help predict where it will end up after the break - this is much harder with a phenolic tip then it would be with a hard single piece leather tip intended for breaking.  I wrote a short article that includes some details on why I use a break stick and what I look for in a good one  here: http://www.sneakypetemafia.com/j-pechauer-breaking-cue-bradley-thuringer-review/"
billiards,2wdzyg,bcthuringer,1 point,Thu Feb 19 22:07:12 2015 UTC,"You're right... the bottom line is that it depends on a lot of factors.  I took the approach of devil's advocate, and I realize now it sounded like I refuted the original post.  When breaking (pardon the pun) the factors down to just cue ball speed and not considering control, my experience is that a phenolic or otherwise very hard tip and a lighter cue greatly increased my break speed.    The best way to determine, however, is trial and error, and practice, practice, practice :)"
billiards,2wdzyg,mkglass,2,Thu Feb 19 22:22:53 2015 UTC,"Just a little first hand experience.  I recently purchased a 21oz cue.  My other two cues are 19ozs.  I've found the 21oz. cue was heads and shoulders better at breaking.  I don't dispute your reasoning though.  For most people that may be true. I have to admit I was not born with many quick twitch muscles.  I cant throw a ball far.  I cant jump high.  And at best I drive a golfball 220 with the wind at my back.  So for me, the greater mass of the stick improved my break, since I seem to be unable to accelerate with the lighter cue any more than the heavier one, but neither do I hit the heavier stick any slower.  If you are like me I'd suggest at least trying a 21oz. cue.(maybe borrow one first).  I didnt buy the heavier cue for breaking...and was happily surprised at this unexpected bonus."
billiards,2wdzyg,CompZombie,2,Thu Feb 19 22:14:27 2015 UTC,"Any cue will do if it works for you.  One small concern is the cue tip.  An $80 cue might have a cheap tip that will mushroom, flatten, or fly off.  Any decent tip that is properly installed should be fine.  I break exclusively with my playing cue, which has an OB shaft and a soft kamui black tip."

billiards,2wdzyg,bclan11,3,Thu Feb 19 19:29:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other points made in the comments, I just have one thing to add; powerful breaking strokes can and will cause the tip to mushroom. I recommend shooting and breaking with that cue until the tip needs to be replaced. Don't be tempted to run right out and buy a break cue. Invest in a good layered tip when you need to replace the original one, and break with a bar stick until you know what you like both in a play cue and in a break cue."
billiards,2wdzyg,snowman818,3,Thu Feb 19 06:13:04 2015 UTC,Casual player with an $80 cue here.  I just use a house cue to break.. I don't need to break or mushroom my tip.
billiards,2wdzyg,Jeembo,2,Thu Feb 19 20:54:55 2015 UTC,"There's no real need for a break cue.  That said, I have one, but because it breaks down to a jump cue, not because I believe breaking will hurt my playing cue.  It is very unlikely that you will damage a cue by breaking with it.  The main reason people have a dedicated break cue is to keep the tip on their playing cue from getting mushroomed and compressed more quickly than it would otherwise.  Plus, many people like harder tips for breaking and softer tips for playing.  Having a second shaft with a hard tip for breaking can accomplish address both of those concerns.    Some people believe that their playing cue will explode or something if they break with it, but that is ridiculous.  I know a guy who has been breaking 9 ball racks at 25+mph with a $3000 Gina cue for many years.  He hasn't had any problems so far, just more frequent tip maintenance."
billiards,2wdzyg,Bwtadpole,2,Thu Feb 19 13:31:31 2015 UTC,"The only real concern I've heard about breaking with your playing cue, and the only concern I agree with, is if the cue has an ivory ferrule. Ivory ferrules aren't meant to handle the force of repeated breaking, and it's pricey to replace.  Your cue should be just fine to break with if you want."
billiards,2wdzyg,Liquidicity,1 point,Thu Feb 19 15:40:32 2015 UTC,"Break with it once...     Do the Balls spread nicely? Do you have control of the cue-ball? Is your break consistent?   If you answered these questions with ""yes"", go ahead and break with it. If you answered one question or more with ""no"" analyze if it's the cue or you that cause the ""no"". If it's you, try to work on it (get better at breaking) instead of investing money in a breaker you're not able to use the potential of."
billiards,2wdzyg,SirNoobs,1 point,Thu Feb 19 12:14:07 2015 UTC,"You can practically break with any stick. However, players prefer not to break with their playing stick as this might damage the shaft in the long run.   Some qualities a dedicated break stick tend to have a thicker shaft with a straighter taper and a hard tip such as phenolic rather than leather."
billiards,2wcgii,NearlyMe,4,Wed Feb 18 19:51:24 2015 UTC,"Etiquette is pretty basic. Don't talk while your opponent is shooting. Sit down while your opponent is shooting if possible. Don't get angry or bang your cue around. If you foul, admit it. Take half an hour and read the entire APA rule manual to familiarize yourself with how the game is played. Otherwise just be polite.  As for getting better, I recommend finding a highly ranked player and asking very nicely for some instructional time. You're in the APA, so ask someone who is ranked 7+. Not all players are very good teachers though, try talking to more than one person if possible."

Or even stands directly behind the pocket you're shooting.   The best way to improve is HAMB (hit a million balls).  That said, after you've been shooting for a while you will begin to see shots that your have a low probability of making. So now, you HAMB at that angle. There are also drills you can look up online. The drills are great for learning English and such. But still HAMB is a great way to improve."

billiards,2wcgii,RoadHustler,3,Thu Feb 19 08:12:14 2015 UTC,"Okay, so as another low handicap bar league player (i'm a 3who played as a 2 for quite a while and I'm pretty sure I'm getting close to moving up to a 4), I have a couple pieces of advice.   On ettiquite-- don't be one of those guys who takes everything super serious. If you're a mediocre player, let everyone know that you're there to have fun. Smile a joke a bit before the lag. If they don't respond well to the joke, just move away from the table after you miss and don't say anything or interact with the other player. If they joke around, they'll forgive minor infractions.   On play-- okay, here's how you can absolutely dominate  9 ball when you're a low handicap player (assuming you play low handicaps). Never miss small. What I mean is always assume that there's a chance you can miss, because there is-- you're a one-- it's expected that you're going to donk off a bunch of shots that look like gimmies, but what you don't want to do is leave the ball in the pocket, because that's how you give up points.   2- Learn to estimate your chance of making a shot and be honest about it. Sure the 6s on your team hammer home kick shots all day long, but don't compare yourself with them. If you honestly know that you only have a 15% of making that kick shot, isn't playing a safe infinitely better? You're probably playing someone who won't make some kind of killer shot, so just safe them and move on.   Don't mess with English or draw/follow in games yet-- just get a really smooth centerball stroke. Those shots you think you need english on?--  80% of those could probably be done better with nothing on them but speed control. Just get a smooth even stroke where you can make simple cuts 90% of the time. Once you're there you can start to look at draw/follow... but you probably don't need them much.   If you do that and learn to make simple shots, you'll be a 2 in a heartbeat."

billiards,2wahvh,gotwired,1 point,Fri Feb 20 04:07:39 2015 UTC,"The main problem with the magic rack is that it doesn't account for old worn or misshapen balls. If you have a set of balls that is worn down significantly, you can use stationary paper reinforcement holes to correct the magic rack groves slightly (although it will then mess up the alignment for newer sets of balls). You can also just stick the reinforcement holes directly onto the cloth in a rack layout to have the same effect as a magic rack (actually better, imho) after some fine tuning."

billiards,2w7mma,NeverWasNorWillBe,5,Tue Feb 17 17:27:30 2015 UTC,"There are some lower deflection cues out there in that range. Players HXT series comes to mind as one suggestion. Cuetec R360 is another.  However, you probably just need more practice with hole reinforcement stickers (where you can set up the same shots over and over). The LD shafts reduce deflection, but not by a whole lot... certainly not enough that you can start simply ignoring it completely. This is even more true when you're talking about the LD cues in the $225 price range."
billiards,2w7mma,2A_is_the_best_A,2,Tue Feb 17 17:58:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah... the youtube video I watched seemed overly dramatic.  He used two different cues, and one of them had exaggerated deflection and the other had none at all whatsoever.  Made me think it was a sales pitch or something.  Can you please tell me more about the hole reinforcement sticker drills?"
billiards,2w7mma,endingcreds,3,Tue Feb 17 18:30:53 2015 UTC,He's talking about placing THESE on the table to mark where balls go to set up repeatable shots.  Then you experiment with varying amounts of speed and English to determine deflection amounts.  Practice shots over and over to get used to how the cue plays.  Drilling the deflection properties of a cue into your muscle memory will make your shots predictable and more consistent.
billiards,2w7mma,IFVoltaire,2,Tue Feb 17 18:52:01 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks a lot.  I'm good with the owner of the place I play at so I'm sure he won't have a problem with me doing that.    The reason deflection scares me is that I find it staggering to predict the result at longer distances.  It makes me think that some people just won't use english on longer shots, aside from follow and draw.   I'm not sure about going with a LD shaft since I've been playing on a $100 players cue for the past year."
billiards,2w7mma,endingcreds,1 point,Tue Feb 17 19:28:39 2015 UTC,why not just buy a predator shaft for your existing cue? you can get one for your price range and it's going to be true LD.
billiards,2w7mma,endingcreds,1 point,Tue Feb 17 22:03:32 2015 UTC,"That's a good idea, I could do that.  I guess I thought there's something special about the butt of a cue too, but maybe not so much?"
billiards,2w7mma,tjshaw02,1 point,Tue Feb 17 22:16:06 2015 UTC,"I have a Z2 predator shaft from Seyberts.Com and it hits great. It was in the $220 price range. The deflection is almost minimal but much better than a normal shaft. Just remember that you no shaft can truly eliminate deflection as it would defy the laws of physics.  The Z2 has a smaller tip size so it might take some getting used to.  If you do buY it from seyberts, you get free shipping and If you use Aparules, you can get 5% off when you imputed the code in checkout. Gold Luck"
billiards,2w7mma,dalgeek,1 point,Tue Feb 17 22:34:09 2015 UTC,The joint will effect the feel of the hit of the cue but has minimal to no effect on deflection. All the low deflection technology is in the front end.

billiards,2w6aws,onepocketfan,6,Tue Feb 17 08:21:45 2015 UTC,"IMO, flatter tips the better for power breaking, so nickel if I have to choose between the two.  Mine is more like a quarter radius.  More surface area = less chance of miscuing and greater margin for error.  Incidentally, my breaker tip diameter is 13.25mm for this reason.  My playing cue is 12.75mm and a dime radius."
billiards,2w6aws,LiGht_UrpLe,3,Tue Feb 17 12:28:02 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that for breaking, you want a flatter cue tip (nickel or more). Since it's less about precision and more about power and will decrease miscues. (As /u/Atlatlien said)"
billiards,2w6aws,gabrielleigh,1 point,Tue Feb 17 13:44:14 2015 UTC,"IMO, I think it is based on the style of breaking you prefer. The game you are playing also tends to affect the style of break, too. Many of my nine-ball customers break very hard, and they prefer thick shafts with flatter domes. Some, however, prefer to exercise more of a ""control"" break. Their break shot is no different than a strong normal shot. I see them using lots of english, often shooting considerably left or right of center ball with draw or follow as well. Those players prefer 12-13mm shafts with some flex. I have built long-stretched pro-taper break shafts for quite a few guys in my area. Most one-pocket players just use their playing cue to break, so no special setup is needed there. Eight-ball players tend to follow along the lines of what the nine-ball players prefer.   All in all, I'd say it depends on how you like to break, and what kind of effect you are trying to achieve with your break shot. Huge spread, lots of chaos? Go with a thicker shaft, hard tip, and you may prefer a flatter dome. Super-precision, medium-strength control break? You may try using conventional playing shafts with medium to soft tips to maximize your control."
billiards,2w6aws,Stiegurt,1 point,Tue Feb 17 17:04:39 2015 UTC,"Learning how to break with power and precision is going to give you the most reliable breaks in the long run, and to that end, I think you should break with a tip that's as close as possible to what you play with, so that you can use the skills you develop as a player during your break. You should be controlling the queue through the shot, rather than hitting it as hard as you can with no precision.   Even if you're going to play a simple center hit break and hit it pretty much flat with little to no english, you should play it like you would a really hard stun shot, if you control your queue through the strike of the ball, you're going to see a more controlled outcome which you can work on and develop to give yourself a better break, if you don't care about the precision of your break shot, then it's never going to improve, regardless of what equipment you use.   So while it's true that a flatter head and a bigger tip do result in less deflection when hitting center ball hard with less precision, it's actually probably better in the long run to hit with as much power as you can employ precisely, and you should be using a tip head that supports the precision level you're already accustomed to."

Also, I'm against charging for music, it puts the atmosphere control in the hands of people that are not qualified to control such important aspects of the business.

I've used three of them so far and wore one out in about a year of solid playing (the other one is on my spare shaft). Tip maintenance is not a big deal for me, I generally scuff my tip with a tip tapper and shape it to the shape of a nickel. The edge of the tip is what I play most of the game with, so I'm most particular about the edge, not the center."

billiards,2w26q0,RoadHustler,1 point,Mon Feb 16 17:39:14 2015 UTC,"For me, it is a very counter-intuitive process that I don't fully understand. You would think that opening your hand and sliding it backwards on your last stroke only to catch the cue again, to then pull the cue back, and then finally stroking forward through the object ball would complicate things and make you lose accuracy right? Yet, surprisingly, it doesn't. Sure it takes a while to get used to this process, but once you can execute without having to think about it, the results are amazing. In fact, you get more accuracy and speed. Somehow the cue ball follows a truer path and if you use english, it does not tend to fade before it reaches the object ball.   My guess is that this happens because holding the cue from further back while maintaining the original set position (the spot where you stop the tip closest to the cue ball before your final stroke) and then stroking forward inevitably forces you to perform a follow through. In other words, when you execute a standard stroke, your set position is also the position at which your forearm is perpendicular. To actually hit the cue ball your forearm must surpass this point. Even more so if you are performing a proper follow through. However, if you imagine the same set position, but instead you slide your hand back to hold the cue from a lower point and then stroke forward, by the time your forearm reaches the perpendicular position, the cue is already way beyond the contact point of the object ball. Thus, an automatic follow through is achieved.   Not sure if any of that made any sense, but that's my take."

billiards,2vy4ro,bike_it,1 point,Mon Feb 16 21:03:58 2015 UTC,"See, and i always thought nine ball required faster felt, since it's easier to get position when the next ball is across the table."

Here is an AZBilliards thread where they discuss various Simonis cloth types."
billiards,2vy4ro,redditor1983,1 point,Sun Feb 15 19:19:19 2015 UTC,760 is a little faster and the cue ball slides more it also  does not last as long . 860 you can't hardly kill that stuff. Both are great cloths. Commercial tables generally use 860 in premium settings. If you play out it might be better to practice at home with the same cloth that is far more common in most premium pool halls. I've had both on my gold crown one.
billiards,2vy3o3,admiral-trapbar,2,Sun Feb 15 05:19:24 2015 UTC,"I personally have the Aramith Tournament set. The polyurethane balls you mention may be shiny out of the box but within 6 months of use will take on a matte appearance and chip quite easily. Invest in a good set of balls, they will last you decades of regular use and give you much more enjoyment out of the game."
billiards,2vy3o3,Green_Three,2,Sun Feb 15 07:53:58 2015 UTC,I bought a set of Super Aramith Pro-Cup a couple of months ago. They see a lot of use but still look as perfect as the day I opened the box. They are around £80 a set and worth every penny.
billiards,2vy3o3,sadface234,2,Sun Feb 15 12:50:08 2015 UTC,"I have the Cyclop TV set that came with my table and a set of Super Aramith Pros. I used the Cyclop set for the two months before the Derby because that's what's used there. After getting back I switched to the Aramiths.  My opinions: The Cyclop balls react well but seem to play ""lighter"" especially that ghostly cue ball. I don't care for the cue ball as it makes the edge harder to see. The balls seem to leave less burn marks on the table but I think this is also the reason the seem to skid often. Guessing it's due to less friction. they also seem to stay a bit cleaner than Aramiths but generally I don't let my balls get dirty enough to notice.  The Aramith set seems to have a much more solid feel with contact. They do seem to leave slightly more burn marks on the table but skid MUCH less that Cyclops. The cue ball is better because it doesn't have the ""glow"" the Cyclop has. So in my opinion the Aramiths are worth the extra $100-150/set they cost over the Cyclops. I still use a measle ball for most practicing though. This is all observed on Simonis 860 HR."
billiards,2vy3o3,fadedcheese,1 point,Sun Feb 15 15:50:16 2015 UTC,Aramith pros or Brunswick Centennials (which are essentially the same) are the best you can get. The lower level Aramiths are not bad as well.
billiards,2vy3o3,gotwired,1 point,Sun Feb 15 05:32:33 2015 UTC,I like the look of Centennials but they are freaking expensive.  Super Aramith Pros are the same in terms of quality (and construction) and are a little less expensive.  Either of those are excellent.  I don't like the Cyclops balls I've hit with.  Seems to me like they get dirtier faster and cling more.
billiards,2vy3o3,bobmacpherson,1 point,Thu Feb 19 13:39:14 2015 UTC,Nothing plays better or looks better than brunswick centennials. It's a once in a lifetime investment. Keep them polished and clean for proper action. And don't use any other cue ball other than the blue dot one that comes with the set. That red dot ball is a different size and a different weight and that affects the action as well. For the life of me I don't understand why many places substitute that. I was at the expo one year and a vendor had fabricated a precision caliper to precisely measure the roundness of pool balls and the results were profound. Cheaper balls were way screwed up. Centennials were perfect. Out of round balls at slow speeds can roll off dramatically  on a level table with good cloth. But if you play on bar tables a lot with balls that have never been cleaned any balls should do.
billiards,2vy3o3,SirNoobs,0,Thu Feb 19 23:02:10 2015 UTC,"I do, I prefer the Brunswick Centennials over the Aramiths. I go to a pool hall where they clean the polish and clean the pool balls after every use and I like the hit of the Brunswick balls. It feels a little more lighter and crisp to me. I found that the Aramith pool balls tend to skid (or ""kick"" for you) on contact more than the Centennials. I have yet to try the Cyclops set, I've heard that they're based on Centennial technology.  However, I don't really ask the guy behind the counter for which set of balls. It's not really a big deal for me."
billiards,2vy3o3,gotwired,2,Sun Feb 15 22:50:56 2015 UTC,The Centennials and the super aramith pros are the same ball with a different number design (both made by Saluc). The lower level Aramiths don't play as well as the Centennials or Super pros. The Cyclop set is made in China and feels cheaper and plays lighter than the Centennials or Aramiths.

Something like this would require a governing body of pool which has failed to exist for quite some time now.

billiards,2vvjtw,miker95,5,Sat Feb 14 15:01:35 2015 UTC,"The ""screw-on"" tips which come on WalMart cues are generally not as reliable as the glue-on tips which are supplied with most production cues. While it takes a bit more effort and money to have a glue-on tip replaced, they generally last considerably longer and most players generally agree that the glue-on tips have a better ""feel"".   The screw-on tips also have the potential to come loose during play, which usually produces poor results in accuracy and control during your shot.   The entire reason they are so easy to replace is that they are often made from inferior materials which crumble, crack, and fall apart quite easily. They make them easily replaceable so you can just change them out every day when you have a problem with one. The glue-on tips can last for years if properly maintained.   I expect that you'll be happier with your new cue with glue-on tips once you have it for a while and discover the improvement in your game that comes with using (in my opinion) a better setup."
billiards,2vvjtw,gabrielleigh,1 point,Sat Feb 14 15:32:55 2015 UTC,"That makes complete sense, thank you for the information!"
billiards,2vvjtw,gabrielleigh,4,Sat Feb 14 15:35:05 2015 UTC,"No problem!  Tip replacement is an easy procedure, and many players do this themselves using simple hand tools. If you end up having it done by a professional cue repairman, the price you will pay is generally based on the cost of the replacement tip you pick to have installed. The prices for tips varies widely based on the brand or style of tip.   A couple of popular and affordable tip brands include ""LePro"" tips, ""Triumph"" tips, and ""Elk Master"" tips. They usually run between five and ten dollars US including installation. There are areas of the country where prices may be higher, but that is the average total cost I see posted from people. These are all ""non-layered"" tips.  ""Layered"" tips generally cost more because of the increased complexity in the manufacturing process to make them. Some popular examples of layered tips include the brands like ""Kamui"", ""Ultraskin"", and ""Moori"". You can expect to pay anywhere from $15 to $40 US to have layered tips installed on your cue. As a personal preference, I prefer the feel of layered tips, but they come with the added expense compared to non-layered tips. It is a trade off, and you may (or may not) feel it is worth it.   Tips are classified in several ways, and you will likely develop a personal preference for what you like in a tip.   Layered/Non-Layered - Tips are usually either stamped out from a  single, thick layer of leather.... or cut from a stack of thin layers of leather which have been glued together. Some people prefer the non-layered tips, other people prefer the feel of the layered tips. Purely personal preference, in my opinion. Hardness rating - Tips are usually classified by how hard they ""feel"". Some tips are only available in one hardness rating, and other brands have several levels of hardness available. They are commonly marketed using terms like ""soft"", ""medium"", ""hard"". Occasionally they are referred to with terms describing how the cueball responds to the hit. Terms like ""fast"" and ""slow"" are used in this case.  With/Without a ""pad"" - Some tips are supplied with a thin backing pad under the leather. This pad is intended to protect the face of the ferrule, and is also intended to prevent super glue from soaking into the bottom layer of leather and changing the ""feel"" of the tip. Some people prefer a fiber pad under their tip, other people see no need to have one. Yet another case of personal preference, and as a professional cue builder I see no advantage in using a pad. If you like the way they look or ""feel"", then use a pad under the tip. I don't think ferrules or shafts suffer any negative effects from not having a pad under the tip.    Anyhow, that is some general info on pool cue tips. Good luck with your new cue!"
billiards,2vvjtw,Apexified,1 point,Sat Feb 14 16:05:44 2015 UTC,How does the pad adhere to the leather?
billiards,2vvjtw,gabrielleigh,2,Sat Feb 14 19:00:09 2015 UTC,"Some tips, like the Triumph, come with the pad already adhered to the leather tip. You can also purchase the pads separately and use them under any tip you like."
billiards,2vvjtw,Apexified,1 point,Sat Feb 14 22:34:24 2015 UTC,"I get that part. I mean, if the idea is that the glue will seep into the leather, do they not use glue to adhere the pad to the leather? And if they do, how is it different?"
billiards,2vvjtw,gabrielleigh,1 point,Sat Feb 14 22:39:06 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that they have a ""special"" glue or gluing process that uses some kind of thicker glue that is strong enough to bond the pad to the tip, but is thick enough that it doesn't ""soak"" into the tip leather like regular superglue. These things are closely-guarded proprietary secrets of the tip manufacturers, and very little information is available about those processes. I can only speculate about it, but that is the best understanding I have of the process."

If you haven't been there in 11 years, maybe you shouldn't be so quick to call their equipment shit...Or you should probably just learn about the equipment before you knock it because I am pretty sure they had the same equipment long before that.   were you there when chuck was killed?   Yes, I was, well I wasn't there when it happened, but I was there a few nights earlier and after.   did you know chuck?   Yes, I did. Everyone knew Chuck. He basically made it his business to introduce himself individually to anyone who looked like they took the game even the least bit seriously and make sure the players were always taken care of. They don't make room owners like him anymore, sad to say.   drop your attitude. seriously.    You first.

billiards,2vsnzm,Bwtadpole,1 point,Fri Feb 13 20:52:08 2015 UTC,"I haven't done that in a while, but the variation I learned was to break like you are talking about, but then you decide how many balls you think you can run.  If it's 4 then you leave the 6, 7, 8, and 9 on the table and give yourself ball in hand.  If you can win consistently then you do 5 balls, etc.  And to give you an incentive for a good break, any ball you drop on the break lets you run one fewer ball.  So in my above example if you get one ball on the break then you only have to run the 7, 8, 9."

It racks just like 10-ball. I break, don't take BinH, and play it straight through. I think it's a great way to practice finishing a table that your opponent doesn't run out. Since 8 ball is easier to run without both sets on the table, not taking BinH makes the break more important to control the cue ball."

billiards,2vqav9,Lxrge,16,Fri Feb 13 03:51:04 2015 UTC,If you're not a good player and have money it can't hurt to buy a good cue.  You have the reliability of shooting with the same cue each game and it looks cool because money.  No problem here.
billiards,2vqav9,frisianDew,1 point,Fri Feb 13 04:49:25 2015 UTC,"This.  I play almost entirely in bars.  I don't compete in any leagues.  I just play for fun.  However, bars have shit cues that they expect to be destroyed.  The place that I hang out at regularly goes through about 1-2 cues per week.  Tips break, shafts warp, weights fall out.  It all happens.  So I went looking for a cue of my own that would be more reliable.  I spent $170 for a decent cue and case on craigslist and I've been extremely happy with it.  It's improved my game, and while I'm getting tired of explaining this to every jackass that thinks that owning a cue means that I'm a professional or a hustler, I still take it with me every time that I go out."
billiards,2vqav9,wolfgame,0,Fri Feb 13 07:16:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think the OP was talking about <$200 cue+case, buying a Dufferin 500 or something to avoid house cues is just sensible if you play with any regularity.   I think this post was more likely directed at the people on this sub who post pictures of their $500 cue and $30 chalk but nobody ever posts a video of themselves playing really well or making amazing shots or anything that demonstrates a skill other than the ability to swipe your credit card."
billiards,2vqav9,BramtonJob,3,Fri Feb 13 13:56:06 2015 UTC,"I'll say this in response to that last paragraph. The reason no one posts them running balls, well there's many. For one, none of us are at an SVB level, nor even close. So even if I can beat you, or most other people who post here, that doesn't mean it would be worthwhile to watch two and a half hours of me playing. Whereas you could use that time to watch a vid of efren or some other pro and maybe actually learn something. And if a person posts a single run out, I mean, what does that really tell you about their game? They cherry picked their footage? They run racks so often they have no problem providing such footage? Not to mention the plethora of unsolicited advice that comes out of the wood work that's nearly impossible to discern between good and bad unless you really know your stuff. And let's say you posted a truly amazing video, running 9 packs, runs to 300 in 14.1, 300 Fargo score, all that shit. People will ask why haven't you competed, that you can make a video but clearly can't handle the pressure of competition otherwise you would have tortured the world by now. Plus you'd be giving your game away for the world to see. I mean anyone gambling with you who asks around will get pointed to that videos direction, well then you're gonna be giving up weight. And probably alot of it too. So in summary, there's nearly nothing to be gained by posting yourself shooting to this sub. You just don't have much to gain, but a lot of confidence could be lost in an attempt to show off."
billiards,2vqav9,too_lazy_2_punctuate,2,Fri Feb 13 14:50:36 2015 UTC,"Well, damned if you do and damned if you don't - easier to just not post anything here about your equipment or your game. Toxicity is everywhere."
billiards,2vqav9,ey_bb_wan_sum_fuk,1 point,Fri Feb 13 15:33:33 2015 UTC,"I know what you're saying, but you don't need to post a two hours video to show off..   As far as I'm concerned you have to be at least a certain level to run out a whole table in 8 ball. That's not something you can do as just an average/novice player, at least by my standards. So maybe if someone cherry picked their footage, who cares? It still happened, and still deserving of some recognition no matter how trivial.   You get a plethora of unsolicited advice in any hobby, leathercraft, woodworking, archery, ANYTHING. In fact I think the best way to get traffic to a thread is to make a claim that someone wants to refute, much like the OP. If everyone kept content to themselves for fear of getting unneeded advice then this whole site would be a shit hole, and no niche subs would have any meaningful existence.   Also, if you can make runs to 300 in 14.1 that's absolutely brilliant and I would definitely watch it. Again, you think people should withhold content for fear of people questioning a lack of competition?  Pool is not intrinsically linked to either gambling or tournaments, many people play for fun, in recreational leagues and are quite good players who don't go for trophies or money clips...   If giving up your game footage is a death blow to your playing then you must be immaculately stuck in your games paradigm.   In summary, there is something to be gained, it's called sweet sweet karma, and if you're so fragile that you can't take a tonguing over the internet from strangers, then maybe self-esteem and confidence need to be worked on more than your game.  Problem is you can get that sweet karma from a simple picture of something expensive, which is exactly what the OP was ticked about."

Cues below that get the job done, but I wouldn't expect reasonably aged shaft wood or choice cuts of wood on the butt, both of which are very important if you plan on keeping the cue for a lifetime."

billiards,2vqjsd,H4ppenSt4nce,3,Fri Feb 13 05:18:02 2015 UTC,I've met a few guys who use 25oz break cues and they still can't break for shit.  I could break better one-handed with my playing cue than they could.
billiards,2vqjsd,dalgeek,1 point,Fri Feb 13 07:28:57 2015 UTC,It took me awhile to get my break down.  I play at bars and they don't have break cues.  So I'm always using a playing cue.  I have found it's all about how I balance my weight.  I tend to hold myself more over the ball and lunge a bit.  I still have troubles getting the full power most of the time.  Do you have any suggestions?
billiards,2vqjsd,BlazzedTroll,2,Fri Feb 13 18:01:02 2015 UTC,"I've found that where you hit is more important than how hard you hit.  A glancing hit on the head ball is not going to deliver as much energy as a square hit.  Also, if you're putting a ton of spin on the cue ball then you're wasting energy that could be used to spread the rack.  Unless you can hit a stop shot at full power then it really does you no good to break as hard as you can swing the cue.  If you can lunge and keep control of the cue ball then you can add a couple mph to your break, but if you're losing control of the cue ball then your break will suffer.  EDIT: To quote Pirelli: ""Power is nothing without control."""
billiards,2vqjsd,dalgeek,3,Fri Feb 13 18:14:35 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I break better with a light cue because I can get it moving faster.  I don't believe cue weight and cheating are related in any way.  Cheating IMO is made up of things like wetting someone's chalk, silicone on the cue ball, etc."
billiards,2vqjsd,slorebear,0,Fri Feb 13 13:42:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know that, and you know that.  However, the weight limit on break cues is 26 oz in every league that I know of.  It says banned in the title, and they still buy it."

billiards,2vq3gv,EtDM,1 point,Fri Feb 13 18:47:38 2015 UTC,"Many people, myself included, don't like the way that uni-lock joints feel.   I'd try out cues with both a 3/8x10 wood to wood joint and a 5/16x14 steel joint, and get whichever feels better to you. These are by far the two most common joint types out there, which also makes finding a replacement or upgraded shaft easier down the line."

I recommend getting your eyes on the table to make sure there isn't and particle board or MDF in the frame or rails. MDF is fine for the slate backing though.   The thing is, they're made by a company who's main business is spas not pool tables.   Ultimately, 1100 for a table that may only last 5-10 years is a fair deal."

billiards,2vmgb9,onepocketfan,2,Thu Feb 12 05:22:49 2015 UTC,"You can't shim your pockets ""properly"" unless you completely redo your rails. Properly would be not to shim, but to extend your subrails, which is actually adding wood to the rail so the cushion itself is longer. It requires either a fair amount of woodworking skill to do properly or a fair amount of money to pay someone to do it properly. Google it or search around AZB to get some examples of subrail extension.   If you just have to have smaller pockets and are on a budget you can add an extra layer of facing to your pockets, but this will make it play funny when a ball hits around the points. It's up to you if you would rather have tighter pockets or pockets that play correctly.  Edit: Either way you have to redo the cloth on your rails. Subrail extension will require new rubber, shimming will not."

If your sticky hands are really stubborn, (like mine get in the summer) take to keeping some alcohol prep pads, like a doc uses to prep for an injection, in your case too. They're cheap, readily available, they come in handy little foil packets, and the rubbing alcohol will absolutely dry out your skin and strip the oils off your cue shaft. People will look at you funny, but what the hell.   A buddy of mine, who runs a players cue with the old x-shaft, absolutely swears by hoppes gun cloths. He swears they leave the shaft clean and slicked for the next use. I haven't tried it, but it might be worth a look.   'Fixing' the cue by sanding or abrading it with sand paper or magic erasers or what have you works with dinged up non-coated maple shafts but it will absolutely ruin a cuetec. Let me say that again; SANDING WILL RUIN A CUETEC. The coating is important on all their shafts. Don't run the risk."

billiards,2vl0nt,Komisu,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:41:34 2015 UTC,First i would ask if you use and baby powder or hand chalk when you play? This helps keep moisture from your bridge hand from getting on your shaft. i would also recommend either  using some cloth to wipe off your cue as you play or using a shaft cleaner like this one. http://www.pooldawg.com/product/q-wiz-shaft-cleaner-and-polisher I use the one i linked and it helps a lot with keeping my cues clean and smooth on league nights

billiards,2vif3g,onepocketfan,2,Wed Feb 11 06:25:13 2015 UTC,"I have a student who is left-eye dominant, but shoots right-handed.  She would consistently hit the ball with left-hand english, but thought she was hitting in the center.  I don't believe in focusing on eye dominance, but sometimes it can be the culprit if you line up wrong.  So... do this:  make a circle with your thumb and forefinger, and look through it at a distant object with both eyes open.  Now, close your left eye.  If the object is still inside the circle of your fingers, then you are right-eye dominant.  If not, close your right eye.  If the object is now in the circle, you are left-eye dominant.  It's possible that your non-dominant eye is above your cue stick.  Thus, you might think you're in the center of the cue ball, but you are not.  If none of this is true, then the likely culprit is an uneven stroke.  Try slowing things down a bit, and get someone to take a video of your stroke from the front, side, and back.  It's best if you see what you're doing from a 3rd person perspective."
billiards,2vif3g,mkglass,1 point,Wed Feb 11 17:05:46 2015 UTC,"Line up your cue first with your arm hanging loosely at your side.  Place your left food under your left hand.  Place your right foot at about a 45 degree angle from your cue with a wide enough stance that you feel stable.  Lean down and slide your bridge hand forward without moving the cue.  Adjust as necessary to feel comfortable, just make sure that your cue doesn't move and that your left foot, left shoulder, and cue stick are all lined up in the same plane.  There are many variations on stance depending on your height, build, dexterity, etc. but the most important part is keeping your arm lined up with the cue so that you're always swinging straight."

billiards,2vif3g,petermgates,1 point,Thu Feb 12 03:31:26 2015 UTC,"Doesn't sound like it has to do with your feet.

Meaning places where there was no chalk or not enough to go around. So if the bars don't care about the tables enough to invest in more than one cube of chalk that's all the way drilled through, or replace the old and beer stained felt... I don't care enough to rub off my chalk and use the right color. If I go to someone's house I'll gladly use their chalk, but where I live there isn't a pool hall for over 200 miles. So it's all bars and a large percent of the tables are neglected.  Edit: I'd also like to add that one of my friends uses tan chalk on his valley table with the normal green felt. He switched from blue just over year ago. At a glance you wouldn't notice that a different color had been used, and when you brush the table the tan chalk in his and my opion 'disappears' better.   But I still agree with you that you should shouldn't treat tables poorly whatever the case. But is it that hard to have chalk?"

I had a magnetic chalk holder before getting one where the chalk hangs out of your pocket. When I had the magnetic one and people would ask to use it, the thing sprouted legs so fast. They would chalk, set it on the table so they could chalk again after a couple shots. A few times id walk up to the table after their turn to find it missing, and on the other table because someone from there grabbed it when I wasn't watching.  Edit: how does the chalk not get swiped in places with more tables?  I use to have a couple blue chalks in my bag, but I forgot them at bars after loaning them out to somebody so they could chalk."

billiards,2vdjtg,admiral-trapbar,1 point,Tue Feb 10 05:37:27 2015 UTC,Rules surrounding what you an and cannot do to your opponent's object balls is one of the biggest differences between US and UK rules.  That and how fouls are handled.
billiards,2vdjtg,wheelsno3,2,Wed Feb 11 09:16:41 2015 UTC,"There are three elements to a legal shot, and then two elements to a legally pocketed ball.  Legal Shot:   Clean contact between cue tip and cue ball (no double hits or pushes, no disturbing other balls besides cue ball) First contact between cue ball and a legal object ball (in this case the 8-ball is the legal object ball). After contact between cue ball and object ball, at least one ball on the table hits a rail or falls into a pocket.   Failure to complete all three elements is a foul that results in ball in hand for the incoming player.  Legally pocketed ball:   Called Ball (doesn't have to be the object ball hit by cue ball, but must still be a legal ball to pocket.  For instance pocketing the 2 ball by hitting the 1 ball into it.  You must call 2 ball, but don't need to say anything about the 1 ball). Called Pocket (call what pocket your called ball will go into.  The details such as kisses, caroms, banks or combos do not need to be called or specified.  And other object balls falling into pockets is not a foul in American pool under any official rules.)   Failure to legally pocket a ball means end of inning/turn.  Taking all of that means the scenario you described above is a legal shot, and a legally pocketed ball, and because it is the 8-ball it is also a game winning shot."

This keeps the amount of money lost at an effortable rate as we don't play it to make money off of each other, we use the money just to make the game a bit more tense and that you're focussing more ... it kind of helps us to get more into a turnament based groove than just playing ""for funs and giggles"".

The most I got was around 30 € ... the most I payed was around 40 €, but all considered, I think we all (4 of us) are pretty equal on the win/loss ratio.

The game borrows concepts from the outdoor game of golf, which is historically related to the cue sports. It is usually played on 10–foot or 12–foot snooker tables as their size and structure are more appropriate (even in billiard halls in the United States where it is in fact more popular than snooker itself, according to the Billiard Congress of America).

billiards,2va5eb,onepocketfan,2,Mon Feb 9 08:04:47 2015 UTC,"If you are getting the rails redone,  don't use shims. Tighten the pockets the correct way by extending the sub-rails to accomodate longer cushions (and thus tighter pockets). Shims are okay if you are keeping the same cushions, but they don't play the same as regular cut pockets and if you are getting the rails done anyway, you might as well go all the way.  If you aren't able to do the work yourself, you can send your rails out to a table mechanic or have them come to you and do the work at your house. Make sure you get a reputable mechanic to do the rails because shoddy work will generally have disappointing results."
billiards,2va5eb,gotwired,2,Mon Feb 9 12:39:11 2015 UTC,Extending the sub rails is the best way to tighten pockets. That's how my table is done but it is a tad more expensive on an existing table. You have to replace the rubber and pay for the sub-rail labor. If I was doing this I would look into getting a Diamond rail profile done too since you are already replacing the rubber. Double and triple shims are where it's starts getting a tad messy but if you just wanted a cheaper way to tighten them I think shims are fine. It really depends on what size pockets you want. A good mechanic is key though so you get the pocket cuts right and all.

billiards,2v5rar,swag_train,9,Sun Feb 8 03:41:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can buy replacement shafts from Predator, Mezz, OB, and many other makers. All you have to do is make sure the joint on your butt and the joint on the shaft you are buying match up (everything in pool has some kind of sexual inuendo, sorry).   You should also make sure you find out what kind of cue you have first because you probably don't want to spend $300 on a shaft with a rare joint-type if your butt is a $30 cue from Sears or Walmart.   Conversely, if your grandmother gave you an old custom from a famous cue maker (which does happen on occasion), you may want to seek out the maker (or his successor if he is no longer around) to have a replacement shaft built as it will help the resale value if you ever decide to sell it."

Keep up the pressure play, and you will eventually get used to it - possibly even prefer it!  Working on your fundamentals is always a good thing too. Consistency is the name of the game!"
billiards,2v1ovm,jac50,3,Sat Feb 7 20:01:11 2015 UTC,"I have basically the same problem as you. Can play a few quality practice frames, but just buckle under pressure. I don't necessarily feel nervous, but something is definitely off.   For me it's shot selection. I go for a much harder clearance than I should do, mess up position, then end up missing. Then it's a straightforward clearance for the opponent.   I've started to take shots a lot slower, thinking about the clearance.. got a trial tomorrow, so will let you know if that works!  Good luck."
billiards,2v1ovm,khoker,4,Sat Feb 7 04:45:42 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound weird -- but the problem is that you care about losing, or missing.  What you describe as ""loose"" I refer to as ""zero-memory"" pool.  You miss a shot, lose a game, who cares, right?  Rack'em up.  When you are playing league, or any structured event, your loses are persistent.  They carry over to the next game.  They matter.  There is no ""trick"".  Don't change your routine.  Don't worry about what the other player is doing, or saying.  Don't worry about people watching you.  Don't worry about blowing an easy shot, or missing an easy leave.   To (mis)quote a pro I can't recall at the moment;      When I realized all pool shots are hard, I stopped missing the easy ones.       Take your best shot.  Keep shooting until you miss.  When you miss, take note on why.  If the shot behaved in a manner you weren't expecting, set it up later and try it again in practice.  If you missed a shot you feel you should have made, practice it later until you make it 10 of 10 tries in a row.  Win or lose, shake your opponents hand and see what you can take away from that game."

Embrace the nervousness, gain a sense of humor even and get your mind off missing and make the shot.  I bartend at a dive bar type place. We have a healthy pool community around the area so there's usually someone playing . I'm a decent shot (running racks is not uncommon).   When I'm working pool comes up often in conversation and I am mentioned aa a good player, so I eventually gained a reputation as the easy favorite to win. I don't always have any days off but slow nights I get to shoot around. The pressure and nervousness of trying to hold up to their expectations can be a bit overwhelming...which has lead me to a good rough patch a few nights.

billiards,2v1ovm,NSA_Mailhandler,1 point,Sat Feb 7 16:06:24 2015 UTC,"This is a huge part of pool and this problem is faced by nearly every player.  The only real solution is practice. You have to practice under pressure as much as possible.  Most people solve this problem by playing for money, to be honest. Small time money matches have pretty much the same pressure level as a league match.   When I grew up playing pool, the good players refused to play unless there was money on the line. They were afraid that playing ""for fun"" would mess up the way they played under pressure.  I hated it then (because I could never play with anyone) and I still kinda hate it now because I'm not much of a gambler. But the fact is, there's truth to it.  If you don't want to play for money, you can at least play people in a ""structured"" way. That is, always play races and always play your ""league style"" of play. Don't just shoot loosely without keeping score."

When you are playing in competition, the opposite is true. After a tough loss, the only thing anyone remembers is how poorly they played.  In reality, practice and competition don't vary that much for the most part, although poor play in conpetition often snowballs out of control if you aren't careful.   The only way to really fix your problem is to just get better so that difficult shots become easy enough that you never miss them."

billiards,2v2tc8,RyanGoslingsCock,1 point,Mon Feb 9 01:17:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Yes watching that clip made me understand, I think. I've never understood anyone breaking without trying for tons of follow, the better to drive the cue ball through the cluster after the initial hit. But now, I see that what the pro break is trying for is transferring spin to the initial hit by using draw. Then, follow through with a low point makes sense. Thanks for all the responses."
billiards,2v2tc8,DarkKnight2060,1 point,Tue Feb 17 17:16:12 2015 UTC,"That's not really what's happening. At the moment of the hit, they hit either center ball or slightly top spin. However, since they are lifting their body up, the cue elevates slightly in the back. They do whatever they can to keep it perfectly level, but it won't ever be perfectly level. The bend into the table that you see if them following through, but keeping their bridge hand planted to the table. Since they have stood up at this point, the end of their follow through has the hurt end of the cue lifting up while the top end staying on the table."
billiards,2v2tc8,DarkKnight2060,1 point,Tue Feb 17 21:38:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I don't disagree with what you say, but I do think the intent is to break with draw. If the cue ball pulls back, odds of it going into a far corner pocket are reduced, and follow spin or drive is transferred to the object ball. You can see it in their setup, practice strokes. They are aiming below the center of the ball. And everything you said is also happening. Thanks again for the response."
billiards,2v2tc8,gotwired,1 point,Wed Feb 18 05:35:33 2015 UTC,"I don't want to sound argumentative or contrarian, but I suggest you watch the SVB break video again. The pre-strokes are aimed low to get a good idea of center, but the final break stroke is actually center ball, maybe slight top.   What happens is the force of the cue ball hits the rack, goes all through the rack and some of that energy goes back into the cueball. This sends the cueball bouncing backwards off the head ball. The forward spin on the cueball keeps it parked in the center of the table. The cueball immediately following he break is traveling backwards through the air, but with forward spin. The forward spin keeps the cueball from flying toward the back of the table when it hits the cloth. Draw would make the cueball shoot backward after the initial hit."

At the professional level, no 8 ball pro has a chance against any snooker pro in a game of snooker. A snooker pro can hold his own at any billiards game.   Any pro pool player would compete in snooker tournaments if they could.  They money is so much better in snooker.  They can't, because they lack the skill to compete at snooker.  Snooker is the ultimate cue sport.   edited to add paragraph on why pro pool players don't play snooker."
billiards,2uq5hw,burnt_wick,3,Wed Feb 4 07:54:30 2015 UTC,Then why when do snooker players get murdered in pool by pool players in long races? Different games. Different skills. I respect the hell out of snooker. Both games are amazing.
billiards,2uq5hw,burnt_wick,5,Wed Feb 4 17:07:29 2015 UTC,"i beg to differ. I'm actually travelling from the US in the UK right now, and I've played snooker for three non-consecutive nights after not having played snooker for at LEAST 15 years. I've beaten the shit out of every brit and scot I've met in the pubs i've gone too. :) I'm an APA 7, BCA 9.  Snooker is great. Its hard, but its not impossible. The angles are just different and the speed control is different. But even a decent player understands the NEED for speed control in general, so it only takes a few games to adjust angles and play different speed than you're used to."
billiards,2uq5hw,fractivSammy,3,Wed Feb 4 09:33:03 2015 UTC,It was a mistake for me to say that an APA 6 or 7 has no chance of playing a respectable game.  APA 7 is the highest level - you just can't go any higher.  That's why the skill for APA 7's has such a wide range - there is just nowhere to go up even as you get better and better.  So it's completely reasonable to think that an APA 7 could be quite good at snooker.  I'll revise my statement to say that an APA 5 or 6 has no chance of playing a respectable game of snooker.
billiards,2uq5hw,angusfred123,2,Thu Feb 5 00:39:36 2015 UTC,"For the people disagreeing, it is true that at the highest professional level, a pool player stands very little chance of winning a snooker match. Take the top 10 pool players in the world vs the top 10 snooker players for example. The reverse may be true but only over a large number of games, like a race to 100 maybe.  Any pool pro will admit that this is the case. Just ask Corey Deuel for example."

billiards,2uq5hw,redditis4queers,1 point,Wed Feb 4 08:54:28 2015 UTC,"What would you consider a respectable game of snooker? Back when I was still a lowly B player, after only playing a few times (like literally 2 times) I had multiple 30 breaks and a 50 break. At the time, I wasn't even a decent pool player. I know several A players who almost never play snooker who have 100 breaks.  Snooker has a more specialized skill set than pool, so pool skills don't translate to snooker as well as snooker skills translate to pool, but there are a few pool pros who can take a few frames off snooker pros just as there are a snooker pros that might be able to take a short set off of a pool pro (neither the pool pro nor the snooker pro has a chance in a long race in the other's game). The most prominent is probably Alex Pagulayan who was one win away from winning a tour card last year after only a few months of dedicated practice.   Snooker pros are extremely accurate and great at speed control over long distances, but really aren't anything to write home about when they are forced to move a heavier cue ball around."

They may be included as olympic events in the future.  These types of games are commonly referred to as mindsports.  Cue sports would not qualify as a mindsport.  Physical activity is required to make a ""play"".  While mindsports may involve endurance to stay sharp throughout a long tournament, no physical actions are required to properly make a play.  This is what separates chess from curling.  You can say that cue sports are a skill and not a sport, but when you say that, you have to draw a line somewhere.  Clearly, physical activity is required to play well, unlike chess.  Where do you draw the line?  Golf?  Bowling?  Polo?  Badminton?  Softball?  Squash?  Ping-Pong?  Archery?  Shooting?  I challenge you to draw a line that involves how much physical activity is needed to be considered a sport.  There are two categories: sports and mindsports.  If a game requires physical skill to make a play, it's a sport.    Any qualification that refutes that statement is arbitrary."

To be completely honest, I don't care for sports. IE Football, Baseball, and stuff like that.

That's at the lower range of your prices and other ones are up in the 200 and up range. I have no complaints with any of them. And I liked them a whole lot more than my friends' Joss' and other stuff in the same price range. Also, if you go to the azbilliards buy/sell forums, you can get really good deals on used cues if you're ok with that.

It just doesn't make sense. Spending a bunch of money on a run of the mill McDermott that 1000s of people have is just silly. If your game isn't to the point where you worry about deflection, then get yourself an action sneaky pete until you're ready for something else. Otherwise (like me) you'll eventually get to a point where you want something really nice and wonder why you invested so much in a starter cue.   Sorry for the length hope I can help  Edit: just be sure to go wood/wood. no graphite. No cuetec."

billiards,2up8ra,I_Am_The_Mole,0,Wed Feb 4 04:04:31 2015 UTC,If you're willing to save up another $100 dollars head to any website that sells McDermott cues. Sometimes the Cue Of The Month doesn't sell out and old inventory gets marked down a lot. I just got a new Mcdermott this way for about $280ish. Would have been cheaper if I hadn't bit on the custom wrap.  One of the reasons I heavily recommend this is because all Cue Of The Months seem to come with an upgraded G-Core shaft so you get a really pretty cue with solid feel.
billiards,2up8nl,aryyanii,2,Wed Feb 4 00:44:22 2015 UTC,"Based on the shape of the nameplate, it looks like an Olhausen . I would still go look at it to make sure.   Personally, if the Brunswick is in similar conditions, I would get the Brunswick. I think the Brunswick will play a little better than the Olhausen .   Olhausen pockets have a funny cut to them and they often reject shots that hit the facing. This can be frustrating because it actually takes certain shots away from your arsenal because you know that if you try it on that table the pocket will reject the ball. This is actually a fairly well known phenomenon called the Olhausen rattle.   The other thing about Olhausen tables is they almost all have Accu-Fast rails. These rails have their benefits and problems. The nice thing about them is they will likely play the same for a lot longer than your typical rails. You won't have to replace the rubber nearly as often. The problem is they are a little softer than standard rails. This means that they will always bank a little shorter, your kick measurements will be slightly off, and the softness exacerbates the problem that the cut of the pockets have.   TL;DR: I would get the Brunswick."

Simonis, Champion, Brunswick centennial, even gorina is OK. Avoid the cheap nappy stuff. I prefer adjustable screw in feet it makes it easier to fix if it settles  badly in a older building or if some fool moves it from where it was level without leveling it again. Names to look for Brunswick, Diamond, Olhausen, Gandy, AE Schmidt.  Do not buy Sears, Sport Craft, Spencer Marston, Coventry, Fat Cat, Play craft. Avoid any pool items EVER! with the names Minnesota fats, Mosconi or Mizerak on them. Find an installer you trust you will be calling him back someday to have him either move the table or refelt and relevel it. So save your self some trouble and find a good guy."

There's a whole set of other rules for American 8 ball (BCA being one of them), so I'd keep in mind the rule differences, and maybe set the game up to take account for these.   The rulesets are quite different between them (ignoring the fact that the tables, balls, and pockets are different sizes), so playing people in other countries might be difficult.

Possibly the forearm, which is the front of the butt. If so, don't worry about what wood is in it. The only effect the but has on the hit of the cue is weight and balance both of which are likely adjusted by the cue maker independent of the wood with the use of coring, weight bolts, etc."

Interestingly, all my Google searches come back with articles about how March Madness office pools are technically illegal, hmm.  My feeling on this is that it probably depends on the location and, in reality, whether it's enforced.  I've been playing pool for 15 years and I've never heard of anyone getting in trouble for gambling on pool, and people are VERY open about the fact that they are gambling. It's not hidden at all. Walk in to any pool room in the U.S. and there is a money game going on, most likely.  I'm pretty sure that if gambling on pool was illegal, and it was strictly enforced, the game of billiards would all but disappear from the U.S. Gambling is, fortunately or unfortunately, the reason many people play.  Now, I'm pretty sure that the issue gets more serious if and when the house is getting some kind of cut. That's a different thing entirely.

At the same time, if you get very serious about pool, you may find it easier to understand. He's probably not mad about winning or losing, but because he's playing below his own expectations (which often are unrealistically high). He feels foolish because he can't make balls he thinks are simple and he doesn't understand why.  It's almost like a phase you see everyone go through. They master some of the physical aspects of pool, but not the mental game, and when they cannot perform despite all this pool knowledge and despite all this muscle memory.  Eventually players come to understand the true difficulty of shots, the smart options when faced with difficult situations, and the effect mood has on their performance. Then you see the tantrums come with less frequency because they stop expecting the impossible. But if they're dead nuts serious about pool, they still feel that anger when they fail.  Some people are just gifted with a very calm demeanor, or maybe it's their upbringing, they can be intensely serious about something but they'd never smack a stick or yell about it. Others are unfortunately just angry people in general, they may hardly care about pool but they're willing to get physically and verbally abusive over nothing important."

billiards,2ue9qv,PulseAmplification,2,Thu Feb 12 08:21:41 2015 UTC,"In almost two decades as a pool player I've seen a few people break their cues out of anger/frustration.   Several years back I saw a guy try to destroy is $6000+ Ginacue after he dogged an easy out ball in a one pocket match that cost him a measly $500. I understand that people lose their shit when they make a bad mistake in a match sometimes, but some people take it way too far.  I've damaged my cue out of anger once in my life, and that was when I had first started playing, and owned a $50 piece of junk. I banged the edge of the table with the shaft after missing an easy shot for the win."
billiards,2ue9qv,too_lazy_2_punctuate,2,Sun Feb 1 15:32:35 2015 UTC,"My brother has a hard time keeping his cool. Lately I've been playing more, and I think when we play there's a bit of sibling rivalry going on. It's getting old though. He knows not to blame me, but he says things like ""ya know it's just not fun to play you cause I know if I miss just once, it's game over"". So I dog a lot of shots and hand over wins to him or else he can get so bent out of shape that he literally does throw a tantrum. It's sad too cause I used to really enjoy shooting pool with my brother."
billiards,2ue9qv,s0und0fyell0w,3,Sun Feb 1 16:15:10 2015 UTC,well if your that much better than him its understandable he is not having much fun playing you. maybe you should give yourself some sort of handicap so you don't have to purposefully miss.
billiards,2ue9qv,too_lazy_2_punctuate,2,Sun Feb 1 19:02:45 2015 UTC,"Well, I did try to give myself a handicap...which resulted in him telling me that I am insulting him and his game by offering one. I seem to be in a no win situation. One thing that worked for a while was when he would get upset, I would work with him on the shot he had missed and show him what to do to make it and the subtle little tips that go along with winning play. But even that didn't work for long. After a while he said he didn't need me coaching him. I think in some ways, he will never be OK losing to me cause I'm his Lil bro. the only other person he behaves like that around while shooting is my dad."
billiards,2ue9qv,s0und0fyell0w,2,Sun Feb 1 20:45:45 2015 UTC,"well I guess its just a family thing. I get kinda annoyed when my brother beats me at pool. even though he has been playing longer than me, but I have put in a lot more effort and time into getting better, yet we are still roughly the same skill level. we both get annoyed losing to eachother, its just natural for brothers to try to one up each other."
billiards,2ue9qv,too_lazy_2_punctuate,1 point,Sun Feb 1 21:21:43 2015 UTC,"See I understand that, when me and my brother were closer in skill we had a very healthy rivalry. But he's married and working, I'm single and in my last year of college and so have much more free time. I feel sort of like he shouldn't get so mad since he doesn't have the opportunity to practice as much as me. If he was playing 5 days a week it would be a different story. i mean how can he expect to keep up with me when he only plays on saturdays?"
billiards,2ue9qv,s0und0fyell0w,2,Sun Feb 1 21:32:31 2015 UTC,"I agree, its no fun playing with people that take it so seriously. it is a game after all. of course we all want to get better but getting mad about your lack of skill or missed shot is not productive, nor is it very sportsmanlike. I mean if it is for money or in a league match I can understand getting a little pissed in certain circumstances, but you don't have to ruin your opponents fun just because you got unlucky or whatever, ""the balls roll funny for everyone""."
billiards,2ue9qv,RoadHustler,2,Sun Feb 1 19:01:18 2015 UTC,"All the time... it's sad when people forget that its a game that they love. I love to spend time doing serious practice by my self.

I am a good pool player but I will allways be an amateur pool player I dont want to make this thing I love to do in to a job. It should be a game not work."
billiards,2ue9qv,giganticMidget,2,Sun Feb 1 20:17:20 2015 UTC,Old buddy of mine is like that. If he misses a shot he start to pout and curse loudly.
billiards,2ue9qv,dalgeek,2,Sun Feb 1 20:37:36 2015 UTC,"I used to get angry, and actually broke the butt of my first cue by slamming it down on a chair while packing up.  Why?  I kept losing to someone who I just KNEW I could beat, but I was too wrapped up in trying to win rather than focusing on how to actually play better.  Having to replace a cue was a bit of a wake-up call that I should control my anger, but I never realized why I would get so angry until recently.  As a new player I greatly overestimated my shooting ability and underestimated my opponents because I didn't understand the game well enough.  If I lost it was due to some outside factor, not because I was shooting too hard, using too much/little English, not playing enough defense, etc.  I think even veteran players can fall into this trap because they just shoot the way they always have and don't really pay attention to why they miss.  As I learned the mechanics and strategy better I could analyze my shots and figure out why I was missing -- knowing why made it easier to focus my frustration on improvement instead of breaking equipment.  I still have my moments (especially when drinking) but I haven't broken or damaged any equipment in a few years ;)  Being able to objectively examine and critique your game makes it a lot easier to move past mistakes and channel your energy towards improving, so you don't become that angry guy no one wants to play with."
billiards,2ue9qv,dubov,2,Sun Feb 1 20:45:50 2015 UTC,To try to throw you off your game. The person is frustrated but on some level believes that showing it will distract you. They cannot accept losing and will try anything to avoid it
billiards,2ue9qv,razorpool,1 point,Sun Feb 1 20:46:26 2015 UTC,"Expectations. Someone that gets angry from an outcome has usually put too much emotional investment into the situation. If all players were realistic about their expectations, then they would understand that things don't always go their way.  Also, I've seen players exaggerate being angry to put their opponent off. You should avoid these players, as it will be no fun for you to play against them."

billiards,2udgoe,gimmeaboost,1 point,Sun Feb 1 19:45:04 2015 UTC,"That is an impressive rack and run at the 50minute mark. She opted to cut bank the one to leave the cue down table for view of the two ball, rolled to fast and had to short rail bank the two. Again great bank as she used the hole pocket, but only leaving a bad position for the three. She then kicks on the short rail for the three in the side at a pretty controlled speed and had full contact on the three. From the four to the 9ball she plays natural shapes. 9ball is tough and especially being 7 racks behind your opponent. She's definitely got some fire under pressure. Sometimes it's best not to rush racks on a long race, leaving your opponent of the table for a longer time span. Also are these 8ft Diamonds?"

I have a tendency to get a little inconsistent with my head placement because of my opposite eye dominance (particularly when I have to awkwardly set up close to a corner or rail). Other than being cognizant of it, there isn't a whole lot you can do besides practice."
billiards,2uao9f,rocksauce,2,Sat Jan 31 16:38:25 2015 UTC,I'm the same left dominant and right handed. It's super important to learn to shoot with both eyes open. Because we want to lean forward over the cue more to get our dominant eye over the cue that we can unintentionally compress our bodies and mess up our mechanics.
billiards,2uao9f,razorpool,1 point,Sat Jan 31 18:40:02 2015 UTC,"If it feels off, then your body is telling you something that could be important to pay attention to. Try to visualize what looks straight, regardless of where the cue stick exactly is. Whatever looks straight for YOU will be correct.

billiards,2uao9f,dalgeek,1 point,Sat Jan 31 18:05:54 2015 UTC,"Try to line up your cue on the shot before you get down, then hold your cue in place and move yourself around the cue to get into position.  The parallax effect will be less when you're standing up and keeping your cue in place will help your brain realize what a ""straight"" shot looks like once you get down.  There are many times I'll line up like this but it doesn't look right when I get down, but the shot works so it was obviously aimed correctly."
billiards,2uao9f,TreuloseTomate,2,Sat Jan 31 19:57:16 2015 UTC,Thanks
billiards,2uao9f,iamNOYK,1 point,Mon Feb 9 07:59:12 2015 UTC,"Forget about eye dominance. You will naturally align the cue with your visual center, wherever it might be. Adopt a consistent pre-shot routine and avoid the most common mistakes: Getting the head out of line, and getting the cue out of line.  Set up a long straight in shot and stand behind the cueball with your head above the line of aim. The aiming process is done now, and a straight in shot guarantees that you are 100% sure where the cueball has to hit the objectball (full ball). When you are getting into your stance, pull your head straight down. This is the most important part. Don't lean left or right. STRAIGHT down, always on the correct line!  If it still doesn't look right, check if your cue is on the correct line. Keep everything still, but raise your head slowly and look down at your cue. Does it look like it's lined up correctly in a straight line with cueball and objectball? Or does it cross the line slightly? If it does, this is why ""something feels off"". You'd be surprised how far off your aim can be without you realizing it. It can help to bring the cue in line before you go down. Observe what professional players do. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz7bwxbmQoM&t=26m52s&user=Bilijar9  Once you are down on the shot with head and cue on the correct line, don't make any adjustments. Just check if you are on the correct line, do a couple of warm up strokes, push the cue through the center of the cueball, and keep your head absolutely still. If you feel an urge to make adjustments when you are down on the shot, you've already messed up. Stand up and start over.  Every shot is basically the same: Just executing your consistent routine."

Any money or effort you spend retipping the graphite one will probably not be worthwhile if you get any more serious about pool, because you'll realize you instead want a quality cue with a maple shaft.  As for retipping yourself, if you do it right the process is rather industrial.  Most areas with poolhalls have a few guys who are good at it and don't charge too much, and most players I know just go to them rather than do it themselves.  For weight, 18oz (break) and (19oz) playing are good starting points, but you should try some lighter and some heavier and find out what you control the ball best with.  That's what matters, and there's no formula or one-size-fits-all answer that can tell you, you just have to discover your own preference."

Either 18 break\jump and 19 play was my initial thought.  I'm used to a 21oz stick when I use mine so getting used to 19 is reasonable."
billiards,2u78v1,its_just_tj,1 point,Sat Jan 31 01:45:22 2015 UTC,"I have always used this for shaping with great success.  With out know much about your old cue, it is tough to give good advice. That being said, if it is graphite, it is probably not the greatest cue.   If it were me, I would buy a new cue. The logic being that you can at some point convert your old cue into a breaking cue very easily. Being graphite, it should be nice and stiff already."

It's hard for me to justify much more than 150 for a regular use stick and that or less for a jump/break stick.  Once I get to a place with more of a pool scene, and finish school so I have more time to play I'll end up going for better sticks.  Best of luck selling your stick though, they sound really nice."

Once you have the tip in the shape you need, you should only need to lift the ""nap"" of the leather to allow it to hold chalk.  I have Kamui tips, and I use their Gator Grip for this.  I have not had to reshape my tip for over 6 months.  However, sometimes your tip will mushroom, and you must reshape it.  In that case, I like the Ultimate Tip Tool, myself.  I keep one in my case just in case, but more often than not, I find myself loaning it to my friends.  I haven't used it on my tips for a very long time."

I'm not sure if the free upgrade is still available, but look into those since they're great value for the money.  I've had mine for almost a year now and it still works great and has held up just fine.

billiards,2u60k9,IFVoltaire,1 point,Fri Jan 30 16:05:30 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, Poison makes pretty good cues. As they are owned by Predator, it makes complete sense that they would be. The only problem with Poison cues are the fact that they only come with 2 joint systems. Ghost and Bullet pin systems which are created by uni-loc. Later on, if you still like the cue that is, if you wish to upgrade to a better shaft or something of that nature, it will be EXTREMELY difficult to find top quality shafts that come with those pins. So far the only other brand that sells shafts for those 2 pins are Predator. (which makes sense since they own poison as well) Luckily Predator have very good shafts in the market so you can advance onto those. But if you are in the market for other shafts, you will probably be disappointed since you will find very,very few. Anyways, good luck on finding the right cue. Enjoy!  EDIT: I would also look into McDermott cues. I have one and I'm a personal fan of them so I'm a little biased. I will say that they do make some pretty decent cues for your price range. http://www.seyberts.com/mcdermott-gcore-cues Seybert's has 5% off with the promotion code aparules :D"

billiards,2u4hub,dksmoove,4,Thu Jan 29 21:25:50 2015 UTC,"It's probably more a case of what your potential buyers need to know when you advertise them.   Make and model is a start. Size, condition, table bed construction, pocket size and supplied accessories (cues, balls etc.) would probably be the information I'd ask about.   Look for obvious branding and do some googling to find out what the model is. My hunch would be Brunswick but I'd have to see a pic to tell.   I'd also expect a pool room to have 1 inch thick slate bed tables, if one has been dismantled it makes it easier to tell. Otherwise a bit of crawling underneath might yield answers.   Generally you don't find ""professional standard"" tables on Craigslist in the NY/NJ area, usually home tables which are of slightly inferior construction. This could work to your advantage if the right buyers were interested.   You might consider posting on azbilliards.com forums although you will have to register and there may be a minimum post requirement for the sales forum. Worth asking over there though.   Edit: shipping and set-up of pool tables is a key factor in many people's decision to buy a used model. Slate is heavy and it can be very costly to move a table from A to B then get a mechanic to set it up correctly.   Anything you can do to aid this will be a selling point. Perhaps contact some local table mechanics and see if you can set something up for a bulk discount - Often they will ship and install. They may also be able to help with marketing."

Will they make it?  Maybe -- but that's not the question.  The question is will YOU make your shot.  The problem with a shape shot like this example is that, even if you miss your 7, your opponent still gets the shape.  Example.     Maybe them take the difficult shot and you'll have a 99% clean-up rate when they miss."
billiards,2u5an8,khoker,1 point,Fri Jan 30 02:51:59 2015 UTC,"I should have used 9 ball as an example, but yes, safety would be a good option if you're playing 8 ball.

billiards,2u5an8,isomr,2,Fri Jan 30 03:46:32 2015 UTC,"I think the best way to approach this shot (highest odds of success) is to shoot the 7 ball in the lower left corner pocket with a very modest amount of low right English (1/4 tip of low and 1/4 tip of right) to  gently send the cue ball to the side rail, and let the spin to bring you back cross table just below the side pocket. From there you have a very doable cut on the eight. The shot is basically a half ball hit, and most importantly you don't have to let go of the cue ball."

billiards,2u3r5e,Apexified,1 point,Thu Jan 29 21:23:10 2015 UTC,I bought one for my table at home. It's much flimsier than the Magic Rack at the pool hall (which is actually branded magic rack) the only difference I've noticed is that it has a tendency to curl up with placing balls on it (unless carefully placed) and get thrown around if it isn't removed immediately after the break.
billiards,2u3r5e,Appetite_TDE,5,Thu Jan 29 23:17:10 2015 UTC,They are pretty neat.  It's a great tool for working on your break because the rack will be consistent.  Also they are nice on* worn out bar tables for obvious reasons.

billiards,2u3r5e,JaktheAce,1 point,Thu Jan 29 19:22:29 2015 UTC,"For nine ball, if you play at a high level, it can make the game less interesting because it makes the break incredibly predictable. I still like it quite a bit.   For 10 ball and 8 ball? Magic racks have ruined regular racks for me. I find myself very annoyed playing 8-ball without a magic rack now. It just makes for better, faster games. Same goes for 10-ball.   If you know what you are doing, you can rack a magic rack faster than a regular rack. I can rack an 8-ball magic rack faster than someone can with a regular rack with the first 3 balls touching, on average."
billiards,2u3r5e,asamimasa,1 point,Fri Jan 30 02:10:31 2015 UTC,"I prefer it in most situations. I'm at a position where I benefit from having the rack explode, and have some predictability in what happens, but not so much where I can abuse it (as well as anyone else I'm exposed to). It most importantly prevents clustered break leaves, and also prevents people from setting up a poor rack because of inexperience or poor sportsmanship.  Between several versions of 8 ball templates (CSi, some eBay ones), I haven't found one that's perfect. The ones I've dealt with always aren't quite perfect, and leave the wing balls a bit loose. IMO, the 8 ball break is more erratic and the number of balls flying around makes it comparatively less important that it's predictable, so I'm not particularly upset about it not racking perfectly. There are some templates made for 8,9, and 10 ball, which is convenient, but the extra material means that there's more places for the balls to stay on top of after the break, and consequently harder to wiggle out from beneath balls."

billiards,2u49jg,jf442,3,Thu Jan 29 20:22:11 2015 UTC,"The ""obvious"" shot is to hit bottom right, as much as you can, so that the cue ball kicks off the side rail and comes back down table for the 9.  This is risky because of the side pocket; if you don't draw enough you're going to scratch 9/10 times.  The less obvious and safer shot is to hit top left.  The position of the 8-ball means that when the cue ball hits the side rail it's in a good spot for 3 or 4 rail shape back to the 9.  A medium shot with a lot of left will carry the cue ball all the way around the table for shape on the 9."
billiards,2u49jg,dalgeek,2,Fri Jan 30 00:39:38 2015 UTC,"I like this route, personally. A high left running english shot puts the cueball running two rails around the bottom left corner, and should not even come close to a scratch. I think using low left to draw into the bottom rail in the pic is risky and many people will scratch in the side pocket going this route. The running english route is nicer to watch, too, in my opinion."

Those kinds of points are priceless."
billiards,2u49jg,gabrielleigh,2,Fri Jan 30 16:53:08 2015 UTC,"Your choice depends on the skill of the other player. If you are playing a decent or good player(APA skill level 5 and up), then you would cut the eight ball in the corner with bottom right english(mostly bottom). If you hit it correctly the cueball will hit just above the side pocket on the opposite side of the eight and will run over to the other side of the table for an easy pot on the nine. Here is a picture: http://pad.chalkysticks.com/810aa  You might elect to play a defense on a very weak player(APA 4 or less), but even then I would take the shot if you are confident with it."
billiards,2u49jg,JaktheAce,2,Thu Jan 29 23:42:44 2015 UTC,I would play a safe. Hit the 8 so it goes two or the rails and end up on the opposite side of the table and leave the cue on the short rail.
billiards,2u49jg,soccercoach1230,2,Fri Jan 30 03:45:24 2015 UTC,"I think you are very unlikely to shoot the 8 and get a good angle on the 9 from this position, and you must consider a safety. Set it up 10 times and try it if you think I'm wrong."
billiards,2u49jg,isomr,3,Fri Jan 30 07:13:34 2015 UTC,"Draw, if you arent too close to the rail...and maybe some outside english."
billiards,2u49jg,too_lazy_2_punctuate,1 point,Thu Jan 29 20:43:06 2015 UTC,Play for the safety.  Pot the 8 in the corner (leaving the cue around the 8's original position) and then you'll have a fairly easy way to kick the 9 two rails back to the middle of the head rail (shitty example).
billiards,2u49jg,khoker,1 point,Thu Jan 29 22:14:15 2015 UTC,There's the possibility of playing safe by hitting the 8-ball full and letting it go four rails to the middle of the foot rail.
billiards,2u49jg,Bwtadpole,1 point,Fri Jan 30 01:25:15 2015 UTC,"A little bit of draw and more outside english. The english will allow you to get back to the short side of the 9 without hitting the shot at a hard speed, which would make the shot 5x more difficult.   If you are too close to the rail to use english reliably, you have to bank it. With the bank, shape is natural and it plays 2 ways if you happen to miss short.  Playing the safety on the 8 as others have suggested is a weak shot and wont win you games against high level opponents. If you have a chance to shoot and no chance to hook, you should be shooting like 99% of the time.  Making the 8 and playing a safe on the 9 is a little bit better, but still not the best option if your opponent is good."
billiards,2u49jg,gotwired,0,Fri Jan 30 20:52:11 2015 UTC,I would play either this http://pad.chalkysticks.com/ac056 or this safety http://pad.chalkysticks.com/fd6d6.
billiards,2u49jg,gloryian,0,Fri Jan 30 11:55:25 2015 UTC,"Personally it depends on the table. On a bar box I'm cutting the 8 in with low right, he cue ball going back and forth across the table.   On a 9' table I'd think hard about playing safe, banking the 8 four rails to end up near the 9 and take it from there. Played with a little follow, the cue ball should rest up on the head rail."
billiards,2u31qw,DarkKnight2060,4,Thu Jan 29 14:52:12 2015 UTC,"A loose rack makes zero difference in the ball flying off the table. You need to focus on getting the right contact point on the CB, it's super critical.  Follow will cause flyers, and so will too much draw (causes the CB to jump a little and be in the air when it contacts the rack).   A perfect break has the CB doing the little jump, but landing about 6-12"" in front of the rack, with just a little back spin so it squats right there in the middle of the table. You can see the landing spots on the cloth, usually.  You need a dead on hit as well. You want all of the energy of the CB going into the rack. If you're off to the side, enough energy will be left in the CB for bad things to happen, including jumps off the table and scratches."
billiards,2u31qw,2A_is_the_best_A,2,Thu Jan 29 15:59:24 2015 UTC,Actually forward spin is more likely to send the cueball flying.  Loose rack makes the balls spread a bit less.
billiards,2u31qw,bald_and_nerdy,2,Thu Jan 29 15:11:31 2015 UTC,Most break shots leave the table slightly. Adjusting distance will help you keep the ball on the table. As practice I would dial your power way back and progressively work it up.
billiards,2u31qw,rocksauce,2,Thu Jan 29 16:12:03 2015 UTC,"The break is something that requires a lot of practice, and most people don't practice enough.  The key to keeping your cue ball on the table is two-fold.  First, your cue stick should be as level as possible at the moment of impact.  This will limit the downward force on the cue ball, which is what makes a cue ball jump.  Second, strike the lead ball in the rack as squarely as possible.  If you hit it off-center, the cue ball will go sideways, and if the cue ball goes into the air at all, it may jump the rail if it goes to the side.  If you hit it squarely, the cue ball will simply jump straight up, and you won't scratch.  A little-known fact: it's impossible to have a perfectly level cue stick when breaking, because of the rail.  When you break, the cue ball WILL jump, even if it's just a half inch or so.  Take a slomo video of anyone's break, and you'll see what I mean.  If you strike the cue ball at just the right speed, you can time it so that the cue ball hits the rack at the instant the cue ball hits the table (after it jumps into the air), or at least while it's on its way down.  If you do that, the ball won't jump into the air, or it will minimize its upward trajectory.  This actually requires you to take a little speed off, which may not be a bad thing.  Control is WAY more important than power."
billiards,2u31qw,mkglass,2,Thu Jan 29 16:15:11 2015 UTC,"If you had the ability to record and play your breaks in slow motion you would easily see why the CB is being sent flying.  No worries, I do it all the time too.  The CB is more than likely airborne (slightly off the table) at the time of impact.  So physics takes it path here and the radius of the ball it hits is slightly lower than the CB making a ramp for it to ride up.  This along with top spin will make it happen almost all the time.  Most top players use no english when breaking and try to smack the head ball dead on.  The result (provided the rack is tight) is the CB stopping somewhere in the center of the table.  This is the goal on most professional breaks.  If you are breaking in 8-ball and going for the 8 ball break, you don't need so much power as you do good follow through and hitting your target on the rack.  This type of break is not common in top level play because most rules the 8 ball on the break is not a win.  You also more than likely need to play some english (I use bottom inside) to help keep whitey out of the corner pocket.  Good luck"
billiards,2u31qw,FreeThinker76,1 point,Thu Jan 29 21:56:46 2015 UTC,"Like other posters stated, it is most likely due to elevation of the cue.  A loose rack won't cause the ball to fly."
billiards,2u31qw,uunngghh,1 point,Thu Jan 29 17:37:32 2015 UTC,you don't want to put too much top spin on the cue ball. I try to hit it squarely in the center so the cue ball is still sliding when it makes contact.
billiards,2u31qw,s0und0fyell0w,1 point,Sun Feb 1 18:55:22 2015 UTC,"If you're breaking off the rail, stop. That adds a lot of elevation and will account for a good amount of the balls flying off the table. The side rail is fine for cut breaking, but when you're breaking in the middle of the table break from the headstring. It took me a couple days of just practicing the break to get working, but I'm so glad I did."
billiards,2u4117,Appetite_TDE,2,Thu Jan 29 19:20:14 2015 UTC,"I'd have to see it on a real table to be certain, but I think the top was completely unnecessary.

billiards,2u2tca,newbrict,3,Thu Jan 29 13:23:59 2015 UTC,"Just so that we are on the same page, there are two general types for both of these shots:   rail: frozen vs not frozen  bank: one diamond or less approach angle vs more than one diamond    For frozen rail shots, practice very thick cuts. If the cue ball is not pretty much head on, learn to play safety. Don't bother trying thinner shots, unless you are in a desperate situation. The contact throw will more than likely make those shots too unreliable for any form of competitive play.   For rail shots that is not frozen, practice for all angles until you got it down cold. Literally, if there's a hair's width between the bank and the rail, you need to be able to make it at all cut angles.   For one diamond banks (banking width-wise; the total travel distance of cb and ob should not be more than 2 diamonds table length-wise), practice both positive and negative angles (ob traveling away from cb starting position and towards that). There's no reason you shouldn't be able to make them consistently.   For other real shots, learn to play safety. Rail and felt condition becomes too much of an issue beyond single diamond. You don't want to risk that in a match."
billiards,2u2tca,HappySoda,2,Thu Jan 29 16:46:37 2015 UTC,"Banks are tough. You can use a system but no system will work on every table, they need to be adjusted to account for the condition of the rails. Some tables bank longer or shorter than others.   In fact, even when using a system I find I'm doing a lot of adjustments based on feel and experience. I don't know anyone who sticks to a bank system even when their eyes tell them the shot is lined up incorrectly.  As you get better, you'll find that very thin cuts are makeable, and in fact more reliable than banks... more predictable. So cut if you can, and bank only as a last resort. Avoid full table banks (where the ball has to roll down the entire 9 foot length of the table) almost entirely, it's the biggest sellout in pool, most players can't make these more than 30% of the time even if they're pretty good otherwise.   Probably the best resource you'll find online for these shots is here: http://billiards.colostate.edu/threads/banks_and_kicks.html  Good luck."

billiards,2u2tca,rocksauce,2,Fri Jan 30 19:06:33 2015 UTC,"Don't over stroke your banks. The compression of the rail is the reason the angle of incident does not equal the angle of reflection (ie why balls come off more perpendicular to the rail). Like every other shot, practice practice practice makes a big difference."
billiards,2u2tca,jf442,1 point,Thu Jan 29 16:07:25 2015 UTC,this took me forever to figure out. I wish someone had told me sooner.
billiards,2u2tca,rocksauce,1 point,Thu Jan 29 20:03:04 2015 UTC,Conversely if you don't have enough angle to make the bank without the cue ball interfering you can over cut the bank and over hit the cue ball and pick up the bank that way.
billiards,2u2tca,bald_and_nerdy,1 point,Thu Jan 29 20:05:57 2015 UTC,"I am terrible at rail shots, if the ball is on the rail I know the cue ball needs to hit the ball and rail at the exact same time to make the object ball follow the rail in, still 60% of the time I mess those up.  As far as banks go I try to avoid it since rails are different on every table but the physics of cutting and english are more or less always the same.  When I get used to tables I have better luck pulling reverse banks (probably not the right name, the object ball banks toward the cue ball's initial position).  Those are kind of nice since you don't worry about double tapping."

In fact, if the cueball hits the rail and the ball at the exact same time, the ball will be cut slightly into the rail and bank out. You have to hit the rail just a little bit before the ball and have it either slide or roll along the rail to hit the ball full in the contact point."

I prefer regular masters. It makes less of a mess on the balls than some of the newer stuff like the kamui or predator stuff. The kamui is more like cosmetic makeup in the way it sticks all over the CB.  But, for certain, don't listen to any manufacturer's crazy claims about chalk. Not a bit of that has ever been proven in scientific tests. Kamui, especially, makes completely bullshit claims about their chalk (they swear it affects CB deflection... totally impossible).  Just use what you like. There's not much reason to spend money on chalk, honestly.

billiards,2u34pf,2A_is_the_best_A,1 point,Thu Jan 29 18:34:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. It's usually a colored clay substance, that has been dried.   One current fad is some people like the ""pre flag"" masters chalk. The flag was added to the label after the 9/11 attacks (and no other change was made, despite what some people claim). So there are a bunch of people using at least 14 year old chalk out there right now.   I haven't noticed any difference with age. I've been using chalk from the same box for about 8 years now.   I have noticed differences between the colors. I like the ""camel"" color better as it seems a little drier than the blue that I currently use (since I now have blue cloth). But it's not a big difference."

billiards,2u34pf,gabrielleigh,2,Thu Jan 29 16:15:27 2015 UTC,"I prefer the good ol' Masters chalk myself. As a professional cue builder and repairman, I'd recommend avoiding red and black dyed chalks. They tend to stain shafts, the table cloth, and about anything else they come into contact with.   I can't say I have ever noticed any kind of detectable improvement in my cueball control by using any of the ""premium"" chalks on the market. Predator and Kamui both offer expensive chalks, and I have used them both extensively. I was never able to detect any improvement to my control whatsoever. My personal opinion on the premium chalks is that they are just a sales gimmick.   The important thing with chalk, for me, is having access to relatively new and ""fresh"" chalk. I think chalk gets contaminated over time by the moisture, dirt, and oils from your hands. Chalk cubes seem to degrade faster in hot and humid weather. When a chalk cube gets worn down to the bottom of its paper wrap, it has been held by thousands of hands, many of which were dirty and sweaty at some point. I feel this contamination is transferred to the tip of the cue to a small degree, and I have had many cubes of chalk that just seem to be ""bad"" when they get older. I go through the same scuff routine each night, and that damn old cube of chalk just keeps slipping and miscuing for me. I'll request a fresh cube from the staff at my room, and suddenly my miscue problems are a thing of the past.   As with scuffing, I feel like the best technique is to spin the shaft inside the cube of chalk to evenly coat the tip. ""Wiping"" back and forth over the top of the dome seems to create uneven chalk distribution and I recommend avoiding this technique."

Fast cloth keeps the balls rolling and, on a break, provides more opportunity for them to find a pocket.    As for table size -- I would suspect that the smaller the table the more likely it is to make balls on the break (shorter paths, more traffic in the two far pockets) -- but I have no scientific data to back that up."
billiards,2u2myh,khoker,1 point,Thu Jan 29 12:15:00 2015 UTC,"Solid science!   Actually that makes sense. Here I thought my break was on the brink of being awesome when, in reality, it's at least a foot short of awesome.   I guess it's just getting a feel for both and making adjustments intuitively."
billiards,2u2myh,khoker,3,Thu Jan 29 16:04:40 2015 UTC,"There's not much you can do with the break.  Slow cloth is slow cloth (although on a 9' table you'd still want to break from a rail as opposed to straight-on -- assuming that you're playing 8 ball).      Leaves are a completely different story.  You have to learn to quickly adjust to the table.  The best thing I can recommend is actually a really easy drill...     Line up 5-6 along the head or foot string (whatever gives you a comfortable shot -- I usually line them up along the first diamond instead of the second) .    Shoot the first ball (the one on the left or right, doesn't matter) as soft as you can.     Hit the next ball so that it goes past the previous ball but not too far past.   Repeat with each ball.   You ""win"" if you hit each ball further than the previous one but you don't touch the far rail.  If you fail to pass the previous ball or hit the far rail you lose.     That's it.  It's a good drill because it is easy to set up and you don't have to sink any balls -- so you can do it prior to starting a game on a pay table.    EDIT:  Change ""around"" the head string to ""along"".  The balls should be in front of you in a horizontal line, with you standing at the end of the table."

Guess I'll see later if it was a one-off or if I'm going to have a days long streak of poor shooting.   I'm really enjoying being able to practice at home but playing by myself tends to be a bit less interesting than having other people around to shoot with. Any suggestions on one player games that keep it interesting?

I posted something about it the other day which I will just link you to, because I'm lazy...  You could also test yourself by playing ""the ghost."" Not sure if you know that one already.

billiards,2u2myh,georgelovesgene,2,Thu Jan 29 22:39:10 2015 UTC,"You have to adjust your break strategy for every table size. I don't break the same on any 2 table sizes. You'll see the pros adjusting their breaks to the equipment during the practice before every tournament.  I'm real sensitive to dirty balls, as well. This causes a ton of throw you don't want. Some halls either have crazy clean balls or crazy dirty balls. Your balls are probably pretty clean being new (I'm guessing), so this could be throwing you off."

billiards,2u0so1,PulseAmplification,2,Thu Jan 29 00:16:41 2015 UTC,"You have a great stance and a nice looking smooth and fluid stroke. It kinda reminds me of Earl, the way you take your practice strokes and address the cue ball on some shots.   If you don't mind some very slight constructive criticism, the 5-4-1 pattern instead of the 5-7-1 makes the run easier, with the 6 being your ideal out ball for the 8. Leaves you closer to the 1 and removes most of the risk. If you come up short on your angle for the 4 into the lower right and wind up either straight-in or with an angle going towards the 3, it's still very manageable to get shape on the 3 as long as you don't come up so short that the 8 hooks you on the 4. Edit: Even then, you still have the 7 as a backup.   Either way, you still managed to get out with skillful shot making. And again, your fundamentals are absolutely superb. How long have you been playing BTW?"
billiards,2u0so1,PulseAmplification,2,Thu Jan 29 02:33:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah, that does sound like an easier pattern. I started playing when I came to college because where I lived before there were no pool tables to play on (Very small town), so about a year and a half. I put so much more work into it than anyone I've ever met though... Well, maybe not the pros, but I play about 5-8 hours a day and when I'm not playing I'm watching online. I've probably watched every video of Shane on YouTube twice..."
billiards,2u0so1,Datlamp,3,Thu Jan 29 02:49:13 2015 UTC,"I play about 5-8 hours a day and when I'm not playing I'm watching online.   If you keep up that work ethic you will be able to compete with guys like Shane sooner than you may think. No matter how much natural talent someone has, when you start putting in long sessions just about every day you'll reach a level where everything becomes easy. Your good fundamentals will make reaching that level quicker.   You may reach a plateau at one point, a lot of players experience this, and a LOT usually quit the game or stop playing it seriously because they think they won't improve. It can last a while, but if you play through it, one day your game will make a huge jump in ability. Before that plateau, you become better gradually as you keep practicing, but after that plateau suddenly you find yourself playing twice as good as you did before, and it stays that way if you keep playing.   Keep it up, and keep watching Shane and other great players on YouTube. Also try checking out some slightly older matches, like from the '90's or early '00s when Billy Incardona, Danny DeLiberto, Grady Matthews, Mark Wilson and a few others were commentating a lot.   I used to watch Accustats tapes religiously, and when I was an up and coming player, listening to them explain in detail why a player plays a certain shot a certain way, leave themselves an angle a certain way, etc. Pool commentating these days, even when you watch great players like Shane or Ko Pin Yi play are often done by amateurs, because a lot of these events are streamed.   I would also strongly recommend looking for videos of Yang Ching Shun in the early-mid 00's when he was playing. He was the best 9-ball player on the planet at that time.   Sorry for the long rambling post, I love to talk about pool.  Good luck with your future endeavors!"

I like to practice on 9ft, and if it has tight pockets its a plus.  I feel the longer shots help me be a lot more accurate when i play on the bar boxes.  Might need a little adjusting on your cue ball speed but its nothing major."
billiards,2twx62,soccercoach1230,2,Wed Jan 28 03:15:11 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, playing on a larger table helps. I have a predator now, but didn't really see that much of a difference from my 200 cue except the intimidation factor."
billiards,2twx62,trickshottim,2,Wed Jan 28 03:12:54 2015 UTC,"Poison is actually the value brand of Predator. They're made by the same company. It's probably best if you can find someone who will let you hit with their Predator to see if it's worth it for you to switch. Cues are a very personal thing.  As far as table size, playing on a bigger table will (hopefully) get you more comfortable with longer shots. When you play on a small table, all the shots will seem short by comparison. Having said that, smaller tables tend to create more ball clusters which you need to have the skill to break them up properly."
billiards,2twx62,Claclink,1 point,Wed Jan 28 04:44:28 2015 UTC,"Don't worry too much about the fanciness of your cue (unless you are into that), especially if you like it and shoot well with it.  As far as best cue makers, that's very subjective. That's like asking who the best woman for you is. The most beautiful? The best in bed? The best personality? For most people, they want a bit of each, and same for cues.  I have a viking with a low deflection Katana shaft that I have had for several years. Not super fancy or anything, but its solid and I love to play with it. Shane Van Boening plays with a ~$300 cue, so that tells you right there its more about practice time and not equipment.   For table sizes, its like my piano teacher told me once when I complained about the quality of my practice piano: ""You should be good enough to adapt to the equipment"". Same principle applies to pool tables. Shitty 6' bar table? Hit firm, deliberate shots, nothing too fancy. On a 9' diamond table? Take your sweet time and focus on the finesse of your stroke, or you'll be rattling pockets all day.  Its a good skill to be able to play on a variety of tables."
billiards,2twx62,gotwired,1 point,Wed Jan 28 07:32:01 2015 UTC,"Predator z2 shafts make a low deflection cue ( as do a couple other companies), it makes a big difference on the squirt of the ball when applying English.  If you have already learned to compensate for squirt, a z2 shaft will force you to relearn how to aim a little.  Personally, I prefer a low deflection cue because it what I taught myself to shoot with and it leaves less room for error.  Other than that, a cue is a cue. A straight cue with a well maintained tip is going to do the job.  Most of what you are paying for is look and feel of the hit, which have little to no effect on the outcome of your shot."
billiards,2twx62,bald_and_nerdy,1 point,Wed Jan 28 08:39:04 2015 UTC,"If you are satisfied with your cue, don't worry about changing it unless you have money to blow. The most important thing is that it gets the job done and if it is working for you now, a more expensive cue wont necessarily work better for you and may even make you worse for the time it takes you to adjust to the new cue.   Poison is a value brand of cues, but they aren't terrible, just a little over-modern in the design for most people. If cues were cars, Predator would be Toyota and Poison would be Scion. Basically a Toyota, just made at a lower price point."

billiards,2twx62,petermgates,1 point,Wed Jan 28 20:50:04 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't practicing on the largest table with the smallest pockets (for standard pool) be more beneficial in the long run?  I mean at worst you play on a 10' table and you're used to making long cuts accurately and you play on an identical size table, otherwise you'd theoretically be more accurate right?  I guess I'm wondering if money and space were not an option would there be a reason to not go with a large table with narrow pockets?  Also 4.5'' pockets are the narrowest right?  The balls are 2.25"" wide so 4.5"" pockets can't fit two through at the same time, they would get stuck (unless two were wedged in and you slammed one through).  I'm just getting back into pool after a few years off."

I would not spend less than $50 either, but I seen some decent beginner cues for that price point. The key factor is what you prefer. Weight, tip, ferrule length, taper, shaft connection, weight and brand name are factors that some people use to pick a cue, but I think that color, personality, design, and comfort are just as important. You want to pick a cue that does to fits your style, not someone else's."
billiards,2twx62,rubadubstyle,1 point,Thu Jan 29 07:12:10 2015 UTC,"The ""toyota/BMW"" analogy shows a misperception.  Cues are not like cars; a BMW performs better than a Corolla, period.  It can accelerate faster, and can change direction more effectively at higher speeds.  One cue does not perform better than another in any absolute sense.  It can't apply more draw.  It can't pocket thinner cut shots.  It can't drill straight-ins from farther away.  Efren Reyes beat the world with a $10 cue in the 80's.  Michael Schumacher in a Geo Metro could never beat any schmuck off the street in a decent sports car.  Now, for a given player, certain variables are going to make the cue feel more comfortable, which MIGHT improve play.  Things like weight, balance, and the feel of a harder or softer hit.  On side-spin shots, cues will cause different amounts of cue ball squirt, and you need to determine whether a lower deflection shaft makes you more or less accurate when using side spin than a traditional one, and choose your shaft accordingly.  But once again, it doesn't really make one cue ""better"".  For practicing on different table sizes, practice will help, not hurt.  Regardless of the table, when compared to not practicing, practicing is definitely better."

billiards,2tvgo6,gabrielleigh,3,Tue Jan 27 19:35:26 2015 UTC,"You'll have to trust your gut on the wrap choice.  I can answer a lot of questions about the Kamui tips in general. I have been one of their Kamui Authorized Installers for a while now.   Kamui has made some model changes over the years, and they have conventionally offered two categories of tips. The ""original"" brown tips, and the ""black"" tips. Kamui sales material has indicated that they feel the difference between the black and brown tips has been a tradeoff between accuracy and control. Their product literature indicates the brown ""original"" series are designed for optimal accuracy. They also state that the ""black"" versions are designed for optimal control and english.   The original brown tips are made of traditional leather layers, where the black versions have been treated to a process that increases their traction on the cueball with some kind of rubber-like impregnated compound in the leather.   A couple years ago, they came out with the ""clear"" versions of these tips, which are essentially the same tips as they have always had, but with a thin clear acrylic layer on the bottom of the tip. They state that this clear layer helps to prevent superglue from soaking into the bottom layers of the tip and making the tip play differently when it gets pretty thin at the end of its lifespan.   I have installed a hundred Kamui tips of all hardness and color styles, and I feel like they make one of the most consistent tips on the market. As for whether the ""clear"" versions have any advantage over the standard models, I can't say I can tell any difference. I have tried the black SS model with and without the clear pad, and they felt the same to me. It is one of those things I kinda feel is more of a marketing gimmick, but there may be some advantage to the clear pad that I don't know about."
billiards,2tvgo6,gabrielleigh,1 point,Wed Jan 28 01:19:43 2015 UTC,Super informative!  So which tip would you recommend?  And I have heard that kamuis play a level harder. (Medium plays like a hard) Whats your experience with this?  Or have you heard anything like this?
billiards,2tvgo6,gabrielleigh,2,Wed Jan 28 01:52:25 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think they may be a tiny bit harder than other tips of the same hardness category. One nice thing about the Kamui is that they don't mushroom like other tips. They hold their shape very well and don't cause you grief."

billiards,2tvgo6,MadManuel,2,Wed Jan 28 03:27:41 2015 UTC,"What seems funny to me is that I had a strong personal preference for hard tips before I tried a Kamui. My past experiences with other soft tips were generally poor because of the terrible mushrooming, flattening, and other problems I'd encounter with the softer tips. Kamui made the first soft tip that I didn't have to work on every night. I was a big fan of the Moori tips back in the day when they had a good reputation. I loved their hit, but I had my damn shaft in the lathe about every week trimming off mushrooms and reshaping the dome on them. When Moori started dropping in quality really bad, I began looking for a new manufacturer to go with. Kamui only got really big just a few years ago, even though they have been a tip manufacturer for quite a long time now.   I was skeptical of trying them at first because of the steep price. I am a bargain hunter, and I generally am pretty happy with most low-cost alternatives to some big name brand. I had a friend who got a Kamui installed, and I showed up to the pool room one day without my poles. I grabbed his cue and put a three pack down on him without blinking an eye. I was pretty hot to try them on my cues, so I ordered three for myself. I liked them so much, I applied to become one of their Authorized Installers. The rest is history.   If you are looking for a good, low-cost alternative to the Kamui, there is another brand which I think are fantastic. ""Ultraskin"" tips seem to play very similar to the Kamui, and they are like less than half the price of the Kamui. Seems like you can find them for like four or five bucks online.   All in all, the Kamui is a high quality tip. The price is a bit high on them, imo, but I have no argument against the quality and consistency of the tips. One thing I look for in layered tip construction is the consistency in thickness, flatness, and levelness of the individual layers of leather in the tip. Kamui's manufacturing process keeps these criteria looking very good, and I have yet to warranty a Kamui for delamination (layers peeling apart), chunking, or any other flaw that happens with most other brands of tips.   I hope this info helps, but keep in mind my opinions are based on pretty strong personal preference which is fairly subjective. Give one a try and let me know what you think of it. Like everything else in the world of pool cues, you will always learn something about what you like or dislike when you try something new."

Now, the rails. This is the pain in the butt part. First question: are they heavy? If so, it doesn't matter what they're made out of, they can be made to play well.  Second, you need to measure the geometry of the facings on the rails (angles, nose height, etc), as well as the geometry of the cusions that are currently on there. Hopefully, this will match existing gold crown dimensions. If so, just get some new rubber and cloth and be done with it.  If the geometry is really goofy, then just set it up and play it until you move and sell it with the house. Save up for a diamond (I say this because if you want a gold crown to really play well you need to basically have the rails re-machined to match the diamond geometry... which is like $1500... so its cheaper to buy a used diamond usually)."

billiards,2trxbd,SeabrookMiglla,5,Tue Jan 27 01:16:46 2015 UTC,"Personally I love Hueblers. Paul is in a home now and not making cues, but he's made some great cues.   Anything above three or four hundred bucks and you're basically paying for a piece of art that you get to play with."
billiards,2trxbd,its_just_tj,3,Mon Jan 26 23:22:09 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Above $400, you are paying for the experience of the cue maker and the wood they are holding. Premier cue makers like the recently passed Tad Kohara have tons of wood that has been aged for decades and selected based on suitability for making into cues. This helps make them quite a bit more solid and less prone to warping than anything you would find on a non-laminated production cue shaft.   That is the main reason why production cue makers have gone to laminated shafts because you can produce a decent shaft with inferior wood.  Its true, you can get a decent cue for $400, but not one built custom to your liking with premium materials that will last a lifetime.  I think the ""paying for art"" price would be well above $1000, maybe around $2000, which is about the price the best cue makers offer plain janes at."
billiards,2trxbd,gotwired,1 point,Tue Jan 27 00:20:55 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. I was speaking from my own experience. Sadly I don't have many opportunities to hold, let alone play with, anything that expensive."
billiards,2trxbd,its_just_tj,2,Tue Jan 27 01:05:10 2015 UTC,Don't get too wrapped up in expensive cues. There's a diminishing return on investment as the price goes up.
billiards,2trxbd,EngrKeith,1 point,Wed Jan 28 19:56:52 2015 UTC,"Yea, there's a wierd price range around $5-700 where you can get a top of the line production cue with a laminated shaft or a custom cue from a less well known maker who might not be the greatest quality wise.   In that case, I would almost always go for the production cue unless there was some cue aspect, like ivory or micarta ferrules, that I absolutely couldn't live without (which I can).  Its also worth it to note that cues by the most famous custom cue makers hold their value very well and can be sold aftermarket for near or some times more than what they were bought for."
billiards,2trxbd,gotwired,1 point,Tue Jan 27 02:43:23 2015 UTC,Agreed. My father still has his Kohara custom. Luckily my father knew him personally so he asked him to make him a special cue. Truly a great pool cue that feels probably the best of any I've ever felt

I'm not sure that I've missed a ball, ever, as a result of the cue stick. Sometimes the tip, maybe, but never really the stick.  I would agree with your $300-$400 number. Maybe with inflation, perhaps around $500 now.  Premium materials aren't required, and it being custom isn't required. As far as lasting a lifetime, both cues play just fine, although the shaft on the oldest one is probably around 11mm or less after all the play, and cleaning, and tip replacements.  I've often found an inverse relationship between the price of the cue and the quality of the player's skills."

billiards,2trxbd,gotwired,1 point,Tue Jan 27 16:47:50 2015 UTC,"At $1000, you are above most production cues, but still on the lower end of the custom cue spectrum. High end production cues like Schon or Mezz might be a good buy in your price range. Just try them both out and see what kind of hit and style you like. If you want to go custom, you might have to settle with a mid-range maker, but custom cues have the added advantage of being able to specify details on the design and build of your cue rather than picking from already built cues.  I've never bought a custom under $1000, but some reputable makers that come to mind in that price range are Coker, Ariel, and Gilbert. Actually, I have a Gilbert, but its a break/jump, but it plays pretty decent. I also had Coker make a shaft for me, which was a bit too stiff for my liking."

Both of those are even cheaper (well a Gilbert j/b is cheaper).   I think Jim Pierce cues are probably the best deals out there right now. You can get a great player for like $300-400.   $1k seems to go a loooong way with customs lately. I wouldn't think about buying either a production or a new cue right now.

Don't use your ultimate like that, it will take hours to shape the tip that way, it will leave leather on the table/felt and the result will be aweful. - please consider: sit down in a chair, place the shaft on your lap so it's balanced with the ends beeing left + right from your knees. Take the tip-tool in your off-hand and place your dominant hand on the shaft. Now with light pressure, press the tip-tool to your tip and start rotating the shaft back and forth with your other hand. Your tip will be shaped in minutes and the waste is on the floor, not on the table.    Never ever ever ""force"" the pick into the tip, better ""roll"" it over with really really light pressure ... if you ""tap"" it on the tip 'cause you feel you need to, watch your fingers :)"

Just make sure you:   always use downstrokes on the tip rotate the cue slowly in your hand to ensure an even treatment vary the angle of your hand - use a flatter angle (like 20 degrees) when working on the top of the tip but a wider (like 35 degrees) angle on the edge of the tip. go slowly and check frequently that it is symmetrical once the tip is the right shape, check if the edge is sharp. If it is, soften it (the pic in the link is good, just a few 70 degree downstrokes would do this. Some people use a pencil sharpener). Sounds minor but saves a few miscues Use a fine sandpaper to finish. Don't worry about making the tip surface too smooth, you actually get the best grip with a slightly roughed up tip.    You should use one of these  http://www.braytoncues.co.uk/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=254  But instead you can hold the sandpaper in that shape with your fingers"

To me, it looks like a cheap economy table and I personally wouldn't pay $400 for it.  $250 if it's slate would probably be my max, and even then I (personally) wouldn't get it.  There are just too many other quality tables on Craigslist these days, and the used table market is very heavily in favor of the buyer.  You can use Searchtempest to search multiple nearby craigslist markets at the same time.  Keep in mind that even if you can disassemble, move, and reassemble it yourself (which is generally pretty easy), leveling and re-felting the bed and rails is going to add roughly another $500 or so to the price."

I've found erroring on the aggressive side when making a decision to pocket a ball or play safe really, really, pays off. So let's say you have a 60% chance of playing a good safe, or a 40% chance of pocketing the ball and getting position. I'd shoot the ball all day.

I tend not to coach people unless the ask for it. I find that being overbearing actually pushes people away from the game, especially when done by people who have no idea how to teach. Of course, I help out anybody that seeks it.  The only way to get really good at the game in any reasonable amount of time is to learn from somebody who knows the game very well. People who try the lone wolf approach tend not to get very good."

billiards,2tk03c,Bogiesmokey,4,Sat Jan 24 22:23:36 2015 UTC,"The resale market on home tables isn't very good.  This is evidenced by looking at any local craigslist and searching for pool tables.  You'll see prices much lower than you'd imagine sit for months/years.  If you have a commercial table (Valley, Diamond, Brunswick Gold Crown) those tend to have a steady resale value and resell quickly enough for a decent price.  Everything else is just what you can find someone to pay for it."
billiards,2tk03c,Pip_Pip,3,Sat Jan 24 23:03:55 2015 UTC,"Like /u/Pip_Pip said, this tables resale value isn't going to be very good.  It is also not one of the 3 big American name brands, aka, Olhausen, Brunswick and Diamond.  This is what is considered a furniture grade table.  I assume the price when bought was close to $1700-2100 which probably included clothe and delivery & setup.  So if you factor the cost of having a company delivering a table and how much one would charge to setup and the price of clothe (Worsted or Nap) and subtract that from the table you are looking at about a $1200 table give or take.  Now if it is in good condition, a pool table is one of those things that it will be worth about 50-60% of it original value.  This of course also depends slightly on if the sticks and balls were including in your original purchase price.   So I would say about $500-700.  Good luck with your sale.    BTW, I lost my ass when I sold my table.   Edit: I should add my prices are for a standard 8' table."

billiards,2tk03c,muchachomalo,2,Sun Jan 25 03:11:00 2015 UTC,"New with a  new accessory kit and install, this table cost right at $2100 new. In a used state and depending on the area. You can get between $800 and $1200. The color of this table won't fit with most motifs for game rooms, so demand for this particular table won't be as high as a natural oak finish or one of the darker colors. If the rails aren't dented and scratched, Realistically, you'll get between $800 and a thousand.  Source:  I'm an installer with fifteen years of experience.   Geographic location will cause these numbers to go up and down. In California, the price might go up a tiny bit. In Arkansas, it'll probably be a little lower.  Hope this helps."

If there aren't a lot of buyers, you might have to pay to have someone take it off your hands. The problem with this table is that serious pool players generally look for more commercial pool tables like Gold Crowns or Diamonds and home buyers generally buy new, so there might not be a big market for your table."

Here's a table for sale on AZBilliards that I think looks a lot better. That table was put up for sale 5 years ago for $900 and didn't get much attention...

My question is if a radial joint shaft will fit this, or am I better off getting a partial blank shaft, and then having a cue maker fit it to my cue.   If I can just buy a radial shaft, I was thinking about using some beeswax or some other wax to fill out the joint to make it a better fit."
billiards,2thkw6,JMizzo,1 point,Sat Jan 24 05:30:09 2015 UTC,"Wait, piloted radial pin. Is it a Zinzola? There is no need to fill in a pilot. From the angle it is hard to see how deep of a pilot you have."

The pilot is ~0.55 inches, overall joint length is about 1.5 inches.  Does that mean I can just buy a radial shaft and it'll fit fine? I'd rather do that than go with a partial and then fit that to my cue."
billiards,2thkw6,gabrielleigh,2,Sat Jan 24 09:15:45 2015 UTC,"I know there are some ""Chinese Radial"" knockoff pins out there, some interchange with Uni-Loc Radial pins, others have a tiny difference in thread pitch that makes them seize up and not screw on properly. I am not familiar with the Bautista pin, but I would recommend being extremely gentle when trying to thread on a conventional Radial shaft. You can easily damage the wood threads of the shaft if they don't match up in thread pitch and depth.   I routinely install the actual Radial pins in the cues I build, and I have seen some of the cheap Chinese radial pins that match up with the Uni-Loc Radial pins just fine. I belong a a big group of cue builders who have mentioned there are some foreign copies of the Radial joint that are different in thread pitch by a tiny, tiny bit and they don't work together. Haven't had one in my own hands to verify yet, but I trust the sources of this info.   As always, I'd recommend contacting the builder for info on the cue. Send that pic to them along with any cue info you have, and they should be able to advise you on the info you need to match up a new shaft to that pin."
billiards,2thkw6,gabrielleigh,1 point,Sat Jan 24 19:17:50 2015 UTC,"The cuemaker said the pin is a 3/8x8 ss pin. He said there may be some differences, but it can fit a radial shaft. He does recommend bringing it to a cuemaker so that if there is any differences, it can be adjusted to fit.  I was thinking about buying a radial joint protector to test the fit. Not sure how close that would be to getting a radial shaft to test.  My only problem with getting a partial is finding a cue maker that is on the list for OB cues. Tried calling a few and couldn't connect to any of them.  Is it possible to just swap out the joint to a 3/8x10 pin? If so, is this usually an expensive fix?"

billiards,2tdaqb,The_Vapist,2,Fri Jan 23 19:31:50 2015 UTC,I really like this idea. I've been playing for about a year. I started out just throwing balls on the table and pocketing them. Since I've gotten better and started trying to incorporate English more as a weapon in my game I've been just playing 9 ball for practice. I like this idea because like it said I can practice the shots I missed and learn the shot for next time. Also since you place the balls without  clusters it really makes it simple enough to just focus on trying to get position on the next ball. I'm definitely going to give this a try thanks for the article.
billiards,2tdaqb,manguydudeian,2,Fri Jan 23 06:12:22 2015 UTC,"A buddy of mine taught me a variant of this.  Rack 9-ball then break until you make at least 1 ball and get a spread that you should be able to run.  Use a piece of soapstone to mark of the position of every ball then simulate the run in your head, figuring out where every ball should go and where your cue ball should be after every shot.  After each successful shot and shape, mark the new position of the cue ball so you can reset if needed.  If you miss, reset everything back to where it was on the previous successful shot.  If you do this enough you'll learn several things:    How to break properly.  This is 50% of a 9-ball game.  If your break sucks you will never run a table and it will be very difficult to win. How to quickly analyze the table to determine if you can even run it, or how far you can run. If you keep missing the same shot then you either have unrealistic expectations of how the run should go or your shooting ability is below par.  Fix your run to match your ability or vice versa."
billiards,2tdaqb,dalgeek,2,Fri Jan 23 06:19:56 2015 UTC,"I cannot second your first point ... efren has one of the worst breaks of all the pros ... yet he's the most successful 9ball player there ever was.     Point 2 is solid    point 3 is also not correct, if you keep missing the same shot over and over ... practice that shot ... it's not only about pocketing a ball, it's also about getting on the next ball in a way where you can get on the ball after that. So just saying ""if you miss a shot more than twice, your playing ability is bad"" is not the right approach in my opinion. If you need to play the ball in a specific way to fall correctly on the next ball, this can also lead to misses, in fact, that's the main reason if a pro misses a ball, they need to play the ball they are currently on in a way that makes even a possible easy ball a difficult shot only to fall into the window that is needed for the next shot to be able to get to the next ball."
billiards,2tdaqb,Liquidicity,2,Fri Jan 23 11:43:54 2015 UTC,"Efren is an outlier.  For us mere mortals, having a good break is more important.  I'm pretty sure Efren is a Jedi.  Corey is a good example of someone who has perfected the art of breaking.   If you keep missing the same shot   This should have read ""If you keep missing the same shot AND shape"".  The main point of the exercise to make sure you can plan your run and actually execute it.  If you're planning a shape shot that you can't make, either your plan is wrong (i.e. the ball can't actually go that way) or you don't have the ability to execute it.  One of the biggest problems for new players is expecting the ball to do things that are physically impossible."

billiards,2tcdvg,WYnativeinAZ,3,Fri Jan 23 20:19:53 2015 UTC,The snooker cut pockets with American sized balls is really what makes the game special. Normal 8 ball on a 9 foot American pool table is too easy for pros.   But this game is just hard enough that the pros can't run every single rack which leads to tactical defensive play.

billiards,2tcdvg,Texaskid89,2,Sat Jan 24 11:40:55 2015 UTC,"Jumping over a ball is illegal in snooker, so you'll rarely see a snooker player attempt it, even when playing pool.  Still, I think that their ability to more or less switch to a different sport for a lark, and then still give someone like Earl a run for his money speaks volumes about the skill level of snooker players. Can you imagine someone like Earl playing snooker? Probably wouldn't even make it through the qualifier round of any sizeable tournament."

On a regular table, they are highly competitive.  These pockets make it a whole different game.  Since Shane typically shoots to the center of the pocket on every shot, but Earl's style is to use the whole pocket, (making it easier to get shape) he misses MUCH more often."

billiards,2tcdvg,burnt_wick,8,Fri Jan 23 03:24:09 2015 UTC,"That form of chinese 8-ball was the name given by us Americans. It's like just naming another game after something else but in all honesty its just a naming scheme. China has always played 8 ball with World rules. The thing that has changed over the past few years is that they now use American style tables with Snooker style pockets. I know this because I've watched every Chinese 8-Ball tournament since 2010. I'm not saying you're wrong, there of course are people that call that ""backwards 8-ball"" chinese 8-ball. The problem is that its just a given name and not really a thing for China.   **I just realized an analogy. It's like how we say English. (Spin) In other parts of the world, they would look at us strangely for calling it English. It's just a name we developed for that special part of the game."

billiards,2tbtq9,HandShoes,2,Thu Jan 22 22:29:19 2015 UTC,You get a slight bounce on the cue ball so it's off the table when hitting the front ball. Just so happened to be hard enough and at the right angle I guess.
billiards,2tbtq9,enhancin,2,Thu Jan 22 22:39:39 2015 UTC,"breaking with a slight elevated back of the cue so the ball jumps ... as well as striking the ball slightly above the center for forward rotation ... both combined with a really hard break will take the cueball airborn ... depending on how hard you hit it it goes higher or lower ... svb uses this tech. in his ""pop-break"""

billiards,2tbtq9,petermgates,-1,Fri Jan 23 00:10:45 2015 UTC,"Sometimes the spin can cause it.  If you give it back spin it is spinning backwards while moving forwards so it is gliding so to speak.  imagine a thin ring around the object ball that is parallel to the surface of the table, this is where balls flat on the table would make contact.  But since it is slightly higher the cue ball makes contact higher.  Usually this isn't much at all if it is even visible concept the object ball immediately moves but on break the front ball has nowhere to go until the balls on the second row move.  So the cue ball goes up.  I used to basically do draw shots on a break from the right side so I could make the balls spread and change my cue ball's ricochet so it hit perpendicular into the right rail then back into the 8.  My plan was to drop the 8 on break, I think it worked once out of around 2000 breaks over a 5 year period."

Also works with the rail, but the effect is usually less dramatic.  I always try to put a little backspin on my breaks so I don't fuck up the tables from the cue ball jumping up."

If they were I would imagine it would be some combination of cue ball foul and something else to account for the foreign object.  I think the common sense answer would be to re-rack and let the opponent break. Although they're probably going to have to switch tables, lol"
billiards,2tbtq9,redditor1983,3,Fri Jan 23 01:21:40 2015 UTC,"Most rules do address this.  In this case, the cue ball ended up off the table, which is a foul and the incoming player gets ball in hand.  If the cue ball had stayed on the table it still struck something that wasn't a permanent part of the table (the light in this case, but it could be a piece of chalk on the rail or even the wall) and this is also a foul, again giving the incoming player ball in hand."

billiards,2tbg1g,workshop777,1 point,Thu Jan 22 21:02:44 2015 UTC,Most definitely when I started paying 9 ball my skill level jumped in 8 ball dramatically.
billiards,2tbg1g,sirbodanglelot,1 point,Thu Jan 22 21:40:34 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. I think 9 ball teaches you how to finish the last 2 or 3 balls and through the 8 in 8 ball better than anything else. And if you walk to the table and you only have a couple balls left, 9 ball will teach you routes to try and get in line when simple planned routes aren't an option."
billiards,2tbg1g,RyanGoslingsCock,3,Fri Jan 23 00:16:43 2015 UTC,"My favorite: place the balls frozen to the rails. Put two balls on the foot rail at the diamonds nearest the pockets. Put four balls on the side rails, one ball on each diamond nearest the corner pocket, and one ball on each diamond nearest the side pocket. Do the same for the head rail, and the opposite side rail. Put one ball in the center of the table.  The rules are; no combos, no banks, no caroms, no jumps, no masse shots, and absolutely no break outs. Even if a shot is made, the cue ball may not contact another ball. *edit, I forgot. No misses. A miss or a bad contact means resetting the balls and starting over.   The game is begun ball in hand, no restriction, and the balls may be shot in any order. Good luck. It's a lot harder than it sounds. I've seen accomplished shooters go to pieces trying to finish this drill without missing or messing up the leave.   It drills rail shots, english control, and speed control."

Example: I shoot at my last stripe ball towards the corner pocket but it hits other balls during its path. You pocket the striped ball in another pocket, and soon after, the 8 ball goes in as well. Although, technically, the last ball you made was the eight ball; you still lose the game."

Keep in mind any rule is possible as long as agreed upon before the game starts.  BCA Rules: http://bca-pool.com/?page=54  3.6 Shots Required to Be Called  On each shot except the break, shots must be called as explained in 1.6 Standard Call Shot. The eight ball may be called only after the shot on which the shooter’s group has been cleared from the table. The shooter may call “safety” in which case play passes to the opponent at the end of the shot and any object ball pocketed on the safety remains pocketed. (See 8.17 Safety Shot.)  3.8 Losing the Rack  The shooter loses if he  (a) fouls when pocketing the eight ball;  (b) pockets the eight ball before his group is cleared;  (c) pockets the eight ball in an uncalled pocket; or  (d) drives the eight ball off the table"

billiards,2t8juf,MxMonkey90,3,Thu Jan 22 02:52:49 2015 UTC,They can be fixed and we do fix them. It has just become a hassle becuase they fail so often.  All Diamonds were originally tournament tables that Diamond installed coin-op mechanisms. The engineering is not as sound and sturdy because of this.The level mechanisms just wear out quickly and they are not as easy to get into and fix. Valley tables are much easier to work if you ever have to. Which is rare.  Edit: I want to add that the Diamonds can not have a dollar bill accepter installed. With the Valley you can program competitive pricing options for slower times and a league play. Diamonds play awesome from a shooter perspective but as an operator I need something reliable and that can make me money.
billiards,2t8juf,petermgates,2,Thu Jan 22 04:15:07 2015 UTC,"My biggest complaint about Valleys is the big metal corner covers, compared to diamonds leather pockets. I just hate the Metal covers really."
billiards,2t8juf,petermgates,2,Thu Jan 22 03:09:32 2015 UTC,I agree with you on that. They have resigned the corners in the new higher end model. They are better than the older versions.  Valley made them metal so they last longer. You sacrifice some quality for durability.
billiards,2t8juf,mkglass,2,Thu Jan 22 04:17:42 2015 UTC,"Who specifically is rejecting the idea of switching tables? Is it the players or the bar managers/owners or is it a combination of the two?  If you have somewhere with multiple tables, would it be an option to change just one of them, suggesting that you have to take the Diamond in for a major service. If people are under the impression that it's a temporary thing and it's only one table (for now), they may be more open to accepting something different.  Once they realize that, properly maintained, this new table is as good as the one they had before - in fact it sounds as though it would be more reliable - they should be happy for it to stay.  I realize that what I'm suggesting could be construed as misleading your customers - I'm just putting the idea out there..."
billiards,2t8juf,nwcubsfan,1 point,Thu Jan 22 14:43:33 2015 UTC,"It is a combination of the two. The bar owners would prefer more reliable tables but they also want to make money.  The league players are really the only ones who are holding out to keep the Diamonds. Everyone else says, ""I dont care what table it is just make sure it is level, the felt is good and it works.""  I have thought of replacing just one of the Diamonds with a new Valley but it would be a huge problem if it didnt work out. A lot of extra work really.

billiards,2t8juf,georgelovesgene,2,Fri Jan 23 05:49:00 2015 UTC,"I have mixed feelings on the Valley table they use at my local bar that is our home table for APA.  The bar reduces the price of a game from $2 to $1 during APA night, so that's a very nice feature.  The table can take quarters two different ways, via a coin slot like you see on a soda vending machine or by the large mechanical mechanism where you put in 8 quarters at once and push the tray in to release the balls.  It can also take dollar bills.  The option to put in quarters through the slot is often broken, so you put in quarters and don't get credit and the coins do not come out through the coin return.  So the table has two ways to release the balls - a mechanical method (put in 8 quarters and push in the slot) or an electronic method (put in quarters or dollars and push a button).  The mechanical method doesn't have any problems.  However, when you use the electronic method to release the balls, the release often jams and balls get stuck in the table.  Sometimes they will release if you put in money and trigger the release mechanism again, but sometimes that doesn't work and the bar has to call the service company to open up the table (the bar does not have the key).  We also find that balls sometimes get stuck inside the table after being potted.  That means that sometimes when you release the balls for a new game, you will be a ball short.  If you send the cue ball down into a pocket, the ball will be released but then you have to put more money in to release the ball.  The other odd thing is that every game at least one object ball will come out in the cue ball return instead of being sent to the regular location for potted balls.  The table has to be plugged in, so there is a power cord that runs to it, which is a little annoying.  The table has an option to be plugged in overnight to charge a battery, but that did not work reliably so the bar just ran the power cable to the table and remains plugged in all the time.  The table plays fine, no issues there.  As a player, overall the table is ok.  Whenever the table fucks up, which is often, the bar gives us the money to release locked up balls.  However, sometimes the table totally locks up and they have to call the service company.  That does not happen often, but when it does, no more pool for the rest of the night.  Many of the other bars in our APA division have tables that don't have any electronic options, just a mechanical coin slot.  Those tables rarely have any issues.  Some of the other bars in our APA division use tables with electronic options.  Those tables have similar issues to the ones I described with our Valley table.  If I were a bar owner, I would never put in a table that has any electronic options.  It's just not worth the constant hassles.  The owner of the bar we play at took out a mechanical table for the Valley, and he regrets that decision.  TL;DR - Tables with electronic options are not worth the trouble.  Stick with  mechanical."

We have a few bars that do have the Top Cats and they are way better than your average coin table... I love to play on the 8'...   but  They are not as good to play on as Diamonds. Are they in the same ballpark? Maybe. It's a good table and I guess you could review both for specifics and see who wins...    With that said, if the Diamond table's coin operation break more often than the valley's, then lose the diamonds and stick with the Valley... The #1 purpose of a pool table is to be able to play a game of pool on it.    If it was a bar I play at, I'd prefer to have working Diamond tables, sure, but I'd be way happier to have Valley tables that are up 99% of the time than a Diamond table that's up 80% of the time.

I know of very few mechanics that can work on Diamonds. They are changing table mechanics but it seems their production isn't able to keep up with demand. Also, they used to be the 'prettier' tables. Have you seen the new impregnanted plastic they're using since the Dimaond wood factory burned down? I do think they're worth having in your arsenal as a vender but wouldn't strictly put them out. Are you able to do any work on them if they go down? They play is AWESOME on them... But the reliability is terrible. Weigh your options. If you're able to vend to peoe without a split (don't know the laws in your location on this) it'd be worth it, maybe. But you're still going to have to fix the issues, also considering people proficient in covering them with the 'Factory method' are far and few between... Eh."

billiards,2t70et,Bay1Bri,2,Wed Jan 21 18:17:44 2015 UTC,"The ghost ball is a visualization method in which you imagine the cue ball where it will be at the point of contact. Then you can aim the real cue ball at the center of the ""ghost ball"" and assuming that you can hit the center of the ghost ball you will pocket the object ball. This is a massive simplification but on every shot the ghost ball will be sitting touching your object ball opposite the pocket in your mind. It's kind of interesting but the contact point on the object ball is independent of the cue ball position. Although you do have a larger contact point when the object ball is closer to the pocket. If the ball is in the mouth of the pocket you could have theoretically several options for position play by using different ""ghost balls"". I feel that most players have issues delivering the cue along the shot line consistently. So they may be able to tell you where the contact point is but they can't hit it consistently. And this is mostly due to an inconsistent and ineffective Pre shot routine."
billiards,2t70et,RoadHustler,1 point,Wed Jan 21 18:40:40 2015 UTC,"That's exactly my problem, when I look at the table, i know where to aim (I know some adjustment have to be made to account for the spin the object ball picks up, but one step at a time lol) but I lose where the shot lin/target is without the aid of a marker (physical ball, finger, chalk mark). Any way to fix this? Thanks for the reply! glad to know I'm not the only one who has had this problem."
billiards,2t70et,hippytech42,3,Wed Jan 21 19:06:26 2015 UTC,"Try testing your stroke a bit.  If you're unsure how:  place the cue ball on the center of the headstring (the break line), aim at the center diamond of the opposing short rail and shoot as straight as you can.  Leave the tip of your cue where it finishes at the end of your stoke.  Do this several times.  Take note of where the cue ball comes back to.  If it lands left or right of the cue tip, then that tells you if you are consistently putting unintentional side spin on the ball.  If it comes back directly to the tip of the cue, then you know your stroke is straight and you can eliminate that variable from your problem solving steps.  Hope this helps!"

billiards,2t70et,RoadHustler,2,Wed Jan 21 19:17:22 2015 UTC,"Research: your pre shot routine is what you do between the end of planning your shot and hitting the cue ball to execute the plan. Repetition: figure out what your pre shot routine is and hone it through repetition. Break it down: F.I. I start by walking and planning. Then I stop behind my cue ball and examine the shot line (the line connecting the middle of the cue ball with the ghost ball) while I chalk. After chalking I place my right foot on the shot line and step forward with my left placing my bridge hand on the table. Eyes to the cue ball when I address the cue ball. Shift eyes to object ball. Move cue back pause and move cue to home. Keep my eye on the object ball contact point till after the ball is gone this is called eye latency and is critical. My hand should have come to rest at my rib in a spot I am familiar with we will call my home position.  I don't actually do practice strokes. I'm not saying its what you should do just that I dont and I didn't want you to think I missed something. Write it down: you need to know what you do and if it is working for you. If it isn't you can deliberately change it and write it down again. Think About it before bed on the bus when you are waiting for your turn to play make it yours. Know yourself: Use your camera phone video tape your self and get familiar with what you do. Watch a whole game pay attention to whats different between when you miss and when you make a shot why did you miss. You will see that most of the time its  bigger issue than friction, spin or deflection or any of the other silly reasons we tell ourselves about why we miss."
billiards,2t70et,petermgates,1 point,Wed Jan 21 23:07:04 2015 UTC,It sounds as though you are standing in one position to determine the contact point and then moving to stand behind the cue ball to take your shot.   Is this the case?
billiards,2t70et,rocksauce,1 point,Wed Jan 21 20:00:21 2015 UTC,"Yes. Generally I stand along the line from the pocket to the object ball, extended off the table (I hope this is a clear description). Then I pick the spot on that line where the center of the cue ball has to be when striking the object ball to sink it. Then I walk over to line up behind the cue ball to set up the shot. Along the way, or when I line the stick up with the cue ball, I lose the exact spot I had planned on earlier. At some point I have to take my eye off the center of the ghost ball, and I can't find it again from behind the cue ball."
billiards,2t70et,petermgates,2,Wed Jan 21 20:14:34 2015 UTC,"I have been playing for a while and still do what you are talking about to some extent. Don't focus on the exact point so much. Think of the two angles you look at the shots as reference points, but don't be so rigid that you don't let your brain do some of the work.   In the future you will realize how looking at the object ball to pocket line will give a good visualization of the tangent line, which is essential for knowing where the cue ball will end up after the shot."
billiards,2t70et,ey_bb_wan_sum_fuk,2,Wed Jan 21 20:26:00 2015 UTC,"Ok, it's the moving from one point to another that makes it very difficult to keep the proper aiming point in your head. Blink and you lose it!  In my opinion, it's better to stand behind the cue ball and try to visualize the shot angle and contact point from there. Then make minor adjustments to your stance so that your head and body are aligned along the intended cue ball path.  Once you're aligned properly, you can get down into your shot and focus on delivering a smooth and straight stroke right along that line.  One way to help a little, when starting out is to position yourself behind the object ball, in line with the target pocket and place the tip of your cue on the table, half a ball's width from the edge of the object ball.  Keeping the tip in the same spot, side step around so you are behind the cue ball and the cue is directly over the center of the cue ball.  Take a couple of seconds to try and visualize the angles and contact point from this new position. Once you get the hang of it, you should be able to do this visualization from behind the cue ball, without using the cue as a guide.  Bear in mind that this isn't an ideal approach to use all the time for a couple of reasons:   Lining up with your cue like this requires you to be stood too close to the cue ball. You then have to step back to get in to final position for taking the shot. Best to avoid this sort of thing in the long run. Putting the tip of your cue on the cloth can sometimes leave a small chalk mark on there. Your opponent could call foul play for leaving an aiming mark.   Edit: minor tweak after re-reading."
billiards,2t70et,snowman818,1 point,Wed Jan 21 20:43:58 2015 UTC,"I do something similar, except I picture the cue ball on the line rather than picking a point on the line where I believe the cue ball's center will be. Picturing the whole ghost ball makes it much harder for me to ""lose"" it when I'm getting down for my shot.  Visualizing the whole ball also makes it easier to set up the shot once you are down, since you have a larger and more defined point of reference, rather than some abstract ""center of the cue ball"" to aim at."
billiards,2t70et,slorebear,1 point,Wed Jan 21 20:30:57 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go out on a limb and wager that the wider the cut of the shot the worse this problem gets? We all started there. It's about repetition and practice. Eventually, you will just develop a feel for the pocket. You'll still line up on the object ball, to find the line, but you'll be confident about contacting that point with the cue ball without feeling like you have to determine the exact center of your 'ghost ball'. Keep shooting, keep chalking, and keep practicing a smooth and consistent stroke. You'll be alright."
billiards,2t70et,gotwired,1 point,Wed Jan 21 21:16:38 2015 UTC,"i remember having the exact same problem.  what fixed it?  about 4,000 balls.  i spent about 25 hours putting 15 balls on the table, rapid fire clearing it in no order, hitting whatever ball looked hittable.  i still do this to warm up, i am down to knocking all 15 down in under 3mins."
billiards,2t70et,keizzer,1 point,Wed Jan 21 22:10:31 2015 UTC,"You should steer away from ghost ball as much as possible. While it is a good visualization method for beginners, it has the fundamental problem of being a very big target for an activity that requires a very small margin of error. The basic premise for any activity that requires aiming is ""aim small, miss small"". The closer you can get your aim to being an infitesimally small point, the better.  In pool, there are several methods to accomplish this.   One is to visualize a point or line that the center of the cue ball has to pass over to make the object ball. This is useful to some degree, but fails in that often times, for thinner cuts, you are aiming out in no man's land where there may not be any visual landmarks to aid you.   Another is to take the contact point on the object ball, and line it up with the contact point on the cue ball. The cue must be placed on a line going through the center of the cue ball that is parallel to the contact point line. This method has the drawback of not having the cue over the line of aim, but is easy to visualize even when down on the ball.  Ultimately the only way to get better at this, using any method, is to practice and ingrain how the shot is supposed to look into your subconscious to the point where you don't actually have to consciously ""aim"" the ball to be on the right line.   It is also important to note that even with perfect aim, poor alignment of the cue and poor stroke can cause a miss, so working on those is arguably far more important than spending your time learning how to aim."
billiards,2t70et,PulseAmplification,1 point,Thu Jan 22 01:32:30 2015 UTC,"If you're really serious about getting better, you're gonna have to get rid of the ghost ball aiming system.    First.  Make sure your fundamentals are solid.  Bridge, stroke, stance, etc.  Second.  Break away from the aiming system by shooting a million shots.  Set up a shot on the table and shoot it until you feel extremely comfortable making it by feel. Then move on to a different shot.  Eventually you won't have to think about where your aiming.       This video really helped me a lot when I was working at getting better."

It probably wouldn't be too difficult to get down into that weight range by removing the bolt.    Just don't go for heavier materials from the start.

I've noticed that most people who like a lightweight cue also prefer cues that have a very rearward balance point. Perhaps a 19oz cue with the weight shifted full rear would feel light enough on the bridge hand to be comfortable.   Perhaps a gift certificate to the local billiards supply?"

billiards,2t4i9o,gotwired,1 point,Wed Jan 21 08:47:54 2015 UTC,"It depends on how sweaty your hands get. Using alcohol will get rid of all the oils from your hand which make the cue sticky, especially if you do it every day, its essentially playing with a bare shaft, but if your hand produces enough oil to stick up the shaft before your session is over, you may have to either wipe down in the middle of your session or pick a different method. Gloves work great for those with sweaty hands, but if you are style conscious you may want to try wax, which feels smooth as silk for a few weeks until it gums up and you have to take it off and reapply.  The trick to using alcohol is, after wiping down the cue, to make sure the cue is completely dry before touching it or putting it in your case or anything."
billiards,2t4i9o,FreeThinker76,1 point,Wed Jan 21 12:17:12 2015 UTC,"When I was big in to playing pool, I wish I had as much dedication to my game as I did in keeping my equipment in great condition.    Here is what I did at least once a month to keep my cue's shaft clean and well burnished and my ferrule (if it's white) nice and clean.  NEVER take any sandpaper heavier than 600 grit to the shaft and even when you do it is for just a very quick light cleaning.  If you have any dings in the wood, a ding is nothing more than the wood pushed in.  If you put water on that part it with a q-tip and let it sit for 5 minutes, it will raise the ding out.  Then dry and lightly sand that area.    As for cleaning chalk off the shaft here is my tried and true method I used and it works great for cleaning the entire shaft including the ferrule.  Use a small amount, like a dime size amount of Liquid Comet.  This will clean the shaft and use a slight abrasive to sand it.  Then take a damp preferably with very hot water cloth and run it down the shaft.  What this will do is raise any dings out.     Now the shaft will have a rough feel.  I will then take the 600 grit (or higher) sandpaper to slightly even out the shaft.    Remember, lightly sand it only.  When you sand you are removing material, and you want that cue's diameter to always be what you bought it as (or had it turned down to).  I then use micro-burnishing papers like THESE.  They last forever and you use them in stages.  You just clean them when they are clogged up.    I like to then finish with a piece of leather to burnish the shaft (Maple, I presume) to a glass like finish.    You should also be using some sort of sealant like a good wax.  This will make cleaning the shaft easier for next time.    The end result will be a silky smooth no ding shaft that is awesome to play with.  Every time my league teammates would use my cues, they would refer to them as the Excalibur compared to others they used."

The shaft is low deflection, which really doesn't matter in my newbie opinion.  You shouldnt be using english when learning to play anyways, so low or high deflection isn't a concern.  The tip is a Kamui, one of the more popular and quality tips you can get out there.  they have a butt load of designs, and I found them quite solid.  I would always advocate in-store versus online, because you can get a better feel for what you're going to be using.  Weight and grip is 100% subjective."

It's awesome and I love it a lot. :) my advice would be to go to a shop and get a feel for different cues and wraps to see which fits you best. Also like my cuetec some cues comes with weight adjustment bolts. This is better for an online purchase as you can adjust the cue weight should you find it too light.
billiards,2t28jd,BlackBurgers,0,Mon Feb 2 02:38:00 2015 UTC,"I would personally recommend a Cuetec. If you want low deflection, Go with the R360 shaft. You're going to play closer to $300, but I think it's worth it.  As for the tip, I prefer Kamui Clear Black medium on mine."
billiards,2t28jd,mkglass,3,Tue Jan 20 21:10:41 2015 UTC,"Don't go for a cuetec UNLESS it has an R360 shaft. Considering that is out of the OP's budget, he should probably stick to Players, Viking, Mcdermott, etc.  Also, don't pay retail for a cue no matter where you buy it, nobody pays retail except on high-end customs."
billiards,2t28jd,gotwired,0,Wed Jan 21 04:24:20 2015 UTC,"If you have access to a store with a good selection of cues, you have 2 options. Go handle them in person and purchase there, or find one you like there, and search for a better price on line.  FWIW, most of the more reputable online merchants have pretty flexible return and exchange policies.  Pooldawg, and Seyberts are 2 good examples, I think both of them will let you return/exchange even after you have chalked it and played with it.  I have purchsed both of my cues from Seyberts, and have nothing but good things to say about them.  As far as your price range, you can find some decent cues in that range.   They would be more towards to $200 mark but Lucasi and McDermott both have cues in that range."

billiards,2t28jd,thepottsy,0,Tue Jan 20 16:35:10 2015 UTC,"That's a tough one, and yes, very subjective.  As a relatively new player, I would probably steer clear of the low deflection shaft until you have mastered your mechanics.  That's just my opinion, others might see it differently.  Hardness of the tip is really determined by how you shoot, however, it seems that most people are just fine with a medium tip."

billiards,2sx9bt,too_lazy_2_punctuate,2,Mon Jan 19 11:29:49 2015 UTC,"Short answer: Get a Players LD shaft.   Long answer: Getting a shaft is a very personal thing. If you can, try a few out first. They all feel different and behave differently.  First things first, you have to decide on whether you want a normal one or a low-deflection (LD) one. Read up on their benefits and drawbacks. In the end, I would recommend LD shafts. This is not because they are better. This is to prevent you from getting shaft-envy later, when you start talking to more people about cues. Most people won't shut up about LD shafts. Just one less headache. Oh yeah, you shouldn't switch back and forth, as they shoot quite differently.   Second, decide on the construction. Learn about solid ones and sliced ones. Basically, solid ones give you good feedbacks but are prone to warping. Some of the more expensive ones use more aged wood to get around this problem. But those aren't always easy to identify. You probably should just settle for a relatively cheap one or go straight to a (respected) custom cue maker.   On the other hand, the sliced ones are basically 8, 16, or 32 slices glued together to form a circular cross section. Don't believe in the marketing hype. Actually, just go ahead and assume everything that's said in ads as completely negligible. Very simply put, the slice structure makes warping from natural imperfections less likely (it's like diversifying your investment portfolio, but you are still going down if WW3 starts), while making feedback less pronounced (think earth quake with a solid bed rock vs loose gravel). You won't know what you prefer until you try them.   Here's a short list to go by. I'm sure other people can fill you in on more shafts.   Players: Solid wood. Cheap. LD quality very close to the best performers out there. Feels ok. Keep it FAR from light sources. I am the ""proud"" owner of 3 identical Players shafts because I kept two near a floor lamp.   OB: Sliced. Very good overall, but nothing truly excels. People like them because of how they feels. The tip might fall off from their gimmicky metal insert between the tip and the ferrule.   Predator: Sliced. Excellent performance. You can't go wrong with the 3142 or the Z. But they are expensive and can feel like a dead cat flopping in a turbulent ocean to some people. I actually like it that dead feeling.   That's the ""low, medium, high"". All other shafts are somewhere within that range."
billiards,2sx9bt,its_just_tj,1 point,Mon Jan 19 15:34:30 2015 UTC,I feel like ten years ago predator was at the top of that list. Since they moved their factory from Florida to China I have heard only bad things about their shafts and cues.
billiards,2sx9bt,petermgates,1 point,Tue Jan 20 01:00:11 2015 UTC,All of Predator's cues are made in the same plant as Players and Lucasi
billiards,2sx9bt,too_lazy_2_punctuate,2,Mon Jan 26 23:31:38 2015 UTC,"The advice from /u/HappySoda is exactly the same as I would give.  Moving from a Players to a Lucasi offers no real upgrade unless the Lucasi has a better shaft. As described though, better is a subjective term and you should probably spend your energy learning about and trying out new shafts.  Speak to people in your pool room, find out what they have, how it plays for them etc. If you're lucky, they may be happy for you to hit a few racks with their cue. I found that was the best way to try out a bunch of stuff before deciding what I wanted.  Also, what /u/HappySoda called 'sliced' could also be referred to as 'laminated' construction. Typically anything marketed as 'low deflection' will be one of these."
billiards,2sx9bt,cHJvZ3JhbW1lcg,1 point,Mon Jan 19 17:41:38 2015 UTC,Lucasi and predator both come from China from the same factory. Though I wouldn't be surprised hxt did too.

billiards,2sx1od,TheJawsofIce,4,Mon Jan 19 08:17:10 2015 UTC,"A small Shop Vac or similar vacuum will work wonders for this. I actually prefer the small units over the large versions. The small ones seem to pull up the dust and dirt but don't quite have the suction to pull up the worsted fibers from the cloth. Use the wide, flat head for doing the table, and the little detail tip for getting under the rails and down in the pockets.  Don't forget to clean the ball return area under the table, too. A huge amount of dirt and dust collects down there (on coin-op tables), and people forget to clean it since it is down below. That is the last place the balls sit before they are placed on the table, and often much dirt and dust is brought up to the table from the ball return area.   Take a bit of time to clean each ball with windex before placing them back on the table. Skin oils build up on the balls from being touched often, and this acts as a magnet for dirt and grunge buildup. A clean towel with a dab of turtle wax will slightly improve the surface finish on the balls and may help hide tiny scratches.   As a final touch, wipe down the side rails of the table after you have everything else cleaned up, and the table is now in pretty much the best shape you can manage. Offer to do this for free to the proprietor of the bar or room you are in, and you might earn a free beer or three!"

One of the commenters advised them that they might be able to offer their services cleaning the tables in exchange for some free time.  /u/gabrielleigh touched on this here too - If you're looking to do it anyway, you might want speak to the bar manager and see if an arrangement can be made.  Chances are, the reason nobody does it now is because nobody at the bar knows or cares enough to spend the time. The players suffer a bad setup but don't bother complaining so nothing changes."

billiards,2stltq,Greenman333,0,Fri Jan 23 00:53:07 2015 UTC,"Don't forget to thrust your hip into the break as well, timed with the cue stroke. Just as in martial arts, this measurably increases the power behind the stroke. Use the same side as the dominant hand (e.g. if you hold the butt with the right hand, throw your right hip). It takes practice to get the timing down and maintain the accuracy of your stroke, but for light-framed folks this is the best way to get more powerful breaks."

The verb effect goes beyond mere influence; it refers to actual achievement of a final result ""the new administration hopes to effect a peace settlement.""

billiards,2sqrry,iamNOYK,1 point,Sat Jan 17 21:34:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, but I do know that the tip diameter is 12.9 and that's a little ridiculous for me. I'd say get the 314 or z shaft. The z is the same thing as the 314 but it is 11.75mm and everything is just a little bit better, but not by much."
billiards,2sqrry,JMizzo,1 point,Sat Jan 17 20:01:19 2015 UTC,The taper type is also different between the two. The 314 is a pro taper and the Z is a conical taper. The Z S Tuned is a Z shaft with a pro taper only available from Seyberts.

billiards,2slge9,isomr,1 point,Fri Jan 16 22:08:04 2015 UTC,"That is a very nice overview. If I may comment:   I use Loctite 454 rather than 401. It is a gel instead of a liquid, and I find it easier to apply (ymmv of course). Otherwise they are functionally the same. I don't bother with rubbing alcohol anymore. I find it more effective to use a piece of masking tape to remove the sanding debris from both the tip and the ferrule. The chisel/sandpaper trick is neat. I use a dremel with a sanding drum, but, then again, I have surgeon's hands. Not for everyone. But if you can do it, the whole process takes just a minute. Once I have the dremel running, I also roughly shape the tip to a dime or nickel shape, and finish it by hand sanding with a paper. Very quick process as well. Burnishing the sides works even better with the back of a piece of sandpaper than with your fingers.   Thanks for posting!"

Not uncommon to have four or five people standing right next to the table.   Just like any game or sport, pool has certain rules of etiquette that you might not be privy to if you aren't a part of that community. I've met people who have played pool for years casually and they still have never heard of basic pool etiquette until they played with me and I explained it to them. I'm often given the stink eye when I tell someone it's rude to stand right next to the table, but they get it eventually.   On the other hand, I think we all know it's rude to just walk away from another person without any explanation."
billiards,2skrzn,JaktheAce,7,Fri Jan 16 01:56:51 2015 UTC,"Ah the gathering crowd.  I have a wide stance, I get low on the shaft when shooting, and when I get on a roll I kind of ignore my surroundings, so I have a tenancy to step on people standing too close to the table.  As a result when people see me on a roll they kind of clear out.  Though I'm normally kind of nice about it ""excuse me I need to be right there"" which people appreciate."

billiards,2slskz,S0cr8t3s,5,Fri Jan 16 06:27:07 2015 UTC,"I just watched it. I'd just like to reinforce that you won't learn the secret to Shane's timing and how exactly he gets his ""pop"" and speed. He says that you just have to keep practicing the break until you get the cue ball to pop up, and get a feel for it. So basically he doesn't know exactly why or how he gets that perfect timing and that exploding power. Since that's the main thing that separates Shane from the other top pros, it's pretty disappointing that you don't learn much about that from this video. He also doesn't go into details about his stance, or his grip, or anything like that. He says he just practiced the break a lot, and changes different things about his stance until it felt right.  What you do learn from this video is what Shane is ultimately trying to accomplish on the break for all of the different games. He goes into detail about where he is aiming on the cue ball, where he's trying to hit on the rack, where he places the cue ball, what the desired result is, and what he does to adjust to the specific table he's playing on when his normal break isn't working right. They talk about the magic rack vs. the regular rack, and about breaking from the box vs. being able to break from the side rail, etc...  Most people, including myself, will learn a lot about just how much you can control on the break, and how exactly to go about breaking for each game. You will however, have to put the hours in figuring out how exactly to hit the ball the way Shane does on the break.  TLDR: You will learn a lot about the strategy of the break in each game, but not how to hit the break like Shane. It's definitely worth $15."
billiards,2slskz,sixsence,1 point,Sat Jan 17 03:50:18 2015 UTC,"Before watching it, I was able to get the CB to pop most of the time. However I would also jump it off the table about 5-10% of the time. Usually that happened when I was shooting from near the centre of the table and I have since adjusted to more of a cut/2nd ball break and I rarely jump it off now.   I do believe Shane is right in saying that it is a feel thing. Everyone's stance and stroke is different and while guidelines can be given, a person needs to develop what works best for them. There's no big secret, it's not about rack rigging, the man practices his break 20hours/week.  If this video isn't enough for someone, they should fly to SD, find Shane on the frozen lake he is fishing in or his home pool hall and present him with a significantly larger chunk of cash than $15. Just ask him to watch you and point out the things he would do differently."
billiards,2slskz,sixsence,2,Sat Jan 17 23:00:55 2015 UTC,"I agree, but people will buy this because it's Shane, and they want to be able to break like him. However, this video provides info that you can get from any other pro. It's common knowledge between all pros. What separates Shane from the other pros is how he hits the ball, not the strategy behind what he's trying to accomplish. People will learn a lot from this, no doubt, just not the part of breaking that distinguishes Shane from the rest of the pros.  There is no magic secret Shane can reveal that will make someone instantly be able to hit the rack like him, and I don't even think Shane knows how he does it. It would be nice, however, if Shane could go into detail about his stance, how he grips the cue, and how he transfers his weight and gets the timing that he does. I don't know if that's even possible, because it seems like it's just automatic for Shane after hitting so many racks. I don't think he knows how he's doing it, he just feels it. Even if he does know to some extent, I don't think he knows how to articulate it."

billiards,2si8p2,TheJawsofIce,4,Thu Jan 15 11:34:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with archer after SVB said that - you can do drills all you want, but it's only going to improve your game to a finite degree. Drills are good to practice a particular shot, but it doesn't teach you how to win racks, the pressure of games, overhitting/underhitting leaves to be safe, getting OUT of safes put on you, and be able to see different scenarios. IMHO, only playing more games and other people will do that. If a difficult shot you've never seen comes up in a game, keep a mental note and do a short ""drill"" right after the game ends, or at a later time by yourself, or with someone that can show you how to make that pot/safety/kick, or whatever shot you are thinking of."
billiards,2si8p2,chotoipho,3,Thu Jan 15 14:53:45 2015 UTC,"I want to also add that watching your opponent during a game can also improve your game as well, as opposed to drills. You can see shots you've never even thought of. If you do drills, you are practicing shots you've already seen. If you play/watch games, you get to explore and discover."
billiards,2si8p2,chotoipho,3,Thu Jan 15 14:57:09 2015 UTC,"The increased confidence I have when hitting a shot that I've practiced repeatedly through drills can't be understated.  It's amazing how quickly a drill can turn a shot you think is tough when you first try it, into something you're happy to see because you know you can sink it with consistency."
billiards,2si8p2,spectacular_coitus,2,Thu Jan 15 19:39:19 2015 UTC,"To clarify he doesn't have a set routine while he practices.  That isn't to say he doesn't practice.  This guy practices more than anyone.  If you are at a tourney with him, you'll often see him off by himself hitting balls constantly.  I've seen it several times while he's idle to practice for hours."

It can't be the only thing you do, game experience is at least equally important, but how many people after discovering a love for the game and joining a league have a completely full understanding of it's complexities?  Things like throw and deflection, countering the spin on the object ball when doing a cut bank, and cue ball speed based on sharpness of a cut for position can all be taught with drills. I credit going through the shots in 99 Critical Shots for my jump from 3-4 handicap to 5-6. Do I do them much anymore? No. But I know so much more because of drills I don't have to."

billiards,2sh5pi,JaktheAce,2,Thu Jan 15 03:16:29 2015 UTC,"Ha, I know you're joking, but I hear this all the time, and in reality a table with minuscule pockets is the last table you would ever want to learn on.  This table is an extreme example, you could not even make shots down the rail on this table, but anything smaller than a diamond pro-cut is useless except for practicing accuracy.   Playing on a table with pockets that are too small fundamentally changes the way you play. You take less risks and fear making shots down the rail. You sacrifice trying harder for the leave to ensure you pocket the ball, when you should be just as dedicated to both.   Part of practice is playing the best patterns. If the conditions on a table make you play a different pattern than what is optimal on a normal table, or shoot a ball less hard, or with less English than what would be best, that isn't good for your game.   It's great to play on a table with smaller pockets than you normally would, but nothing smaller than diamond pro-cut unless you are just practicing shot-making accuracy."

billiards,2sh5pi,buttcrust,-1,Thu Jan 15 21:56:59 2015 UTC,"You mean regular pocket billiards table right? Billiards tables have no pockets. What size is the table?  If all the pockets are rounded like this, someone turned a pool table into a snooker/pool hybrid table. Rounded pockets have a huge effect on how the balls can be pocketed.  A few pool halls I used to go to had regular pool tables, and then one 'American snooker' table in the back for Liability ring games. Those tables were usually 5x10 with rounded snooker pockets, smaller snooker balls, and the pockets were much tighter than standard snooker pockets. The corner pockets were so small that they barely fit a snooker ball, so pocketing a ball that was on the rail was impossible no matter how soft you hit it, the pockets would just spit it out. This was always on super fast cloth as well.   Some pool rooms had the 6x12 snooker regulation size, but had the tiny pockets cut for Liability. That game generated a lot of action.   Edit: the pocket is rounded very similar to an English 8-ball table: http://www.8ballacademy.com/baulkline/index.php?page=british_8ball"

I recently just got back from vacation over there and this style pool table is the only type you'll find over there. The corners are rounded but built in the style of an American pool table. The pockets are 2"" 5/8. When I put a 2""1/4 standard regulation ball, I couldn't fit my pinky on either side of the ball even. Also, whether you shoot it hard or soft while frozen on the rail, it is impossible to make. It made 8 ball the only game you could play since Rotation games were basically 1 hour long matches. I will say one thing though, my potting has never been as good as it is now. ;)  EDIT: Now that I think about it, I should have taken a photo of the tables so you guys could see them.

billiards,2siy6s,neonbuttons22,4,Thu Jan 15 16:17:24 2015 UTC,"The mark on the table most generally comes from the cueball smashing down the cloth during a jump shot. Proper jump technique keeps the tip of the cue from hitting the cloth, but it is impossible to avoid the mark left by the cueball as it is fired downward by the cue. The same sort of marks happen during break shots, and they pepper the area around the rack from the cueball bouncing up and landing near the rack after a break.   Aside from picking up the cueball and setting a pad under it, there is no way to prevent this damage to the cloth. Most of the time, touching or disturbing the cueball during the game is a foul, and placing any kind of pad under the cueball will dramatically increase the necessary force to jump the ball.   It is just one of the bits of collateral damage that occur in the game, and pool room owners will either accept and allow it as a cost of doing business, or they will ban jumpshots and save a few bucks in the long term.   I build dozens of custom jump cues each year, and spend countless hours instructing people in the art of technical jump shot execution. If there was a simple and easy way to prevent this damage to the cloth, I'd sure be happy to learn about it."

billiards,2siy6s,bclan11,1 point,Thu Jan 15 23:29:27 2015 UTC,"I believe OP is talking about scoop jumping.  This is an illegal shot and will almost always leave a mark.

billiards,2siy6s,slorebear,2,Thu Jan 15 20:07:40 2015 UTC,"Like this  Also, even if you're just playing for fun, you should try to not scoop the ball.

It is slightly heavier than a cyclops or aramith cue ball. Also I watched the CJ Wiley instructional dvd on how to properly execute a jump shot. Have yet to accomplish the jump draw. I watched the dvd countess times before attempting it in a 9ball tourney and was able to get out. Equally important to know kicks.

This article by Tony Robles helped me with my jump shot.  It's probably going to be necessary to use a short jump cue if you want to jump over a full ball but you should be able to get enough height with a regular cue to get over the edge of an obstructing ball.
billiards,2siy6s,thepottsy,1 point,Thu Jan 15 21:10:36 2015 UTC,"If the mark is being left by your tip making contact with the felt, you can abbreviate or shorten your stroke to prevent it.  I notice that the cueball itself will sometimes leave a mark from the high compression and friction, which is very hard to avoid on some felt types.  If you are just practicing, you can use a small piece of felt under the cueball (as mentioned in another comment) and avoid this."
billiards,2sj2ea,burnt_wick,2,Thu Jan 15 16:51:49 2015 UTC,I would think that this is a bad idea.  Putting pressure on the tip as you remove these would weaken the bond over time.

billiards,2sj2ea,Pip_Pip,2,Thu Jan 15 18:15:32 2015 UTC,"For this to stay on the rim of the cover needs to push in towards the ferrule.  As you pull it up it will grip the tip tugging it upwards.  Though slight, over time it will degrade the bond between the tip and the ferrule.    I meant the tip and hopefully that explains my thoughts a little more.  I also don't see what this would protect from?"
billiards,2sj2ea,Liquidicity,-2,Thu Jan 15 18:32:43 2015 UTC,"There are two main benefits to using a Tip Saver. The primary benefit is that Tip Savers protect your cue tip from drying out. This will keep your tip preforming in “tip-top” condition for longer than it ever could have without a Tip Saver.  The second benefit is that you no longer need to worry about removing all the chalk from your cue tip before putting it back in your case. By putting a Tip Saver on your cue, you will no longer have any excess chalk particles gumming up your cue case.   Source"

billiards,2scwht,Jamuraan1,1 point,Wed Jan 14 05:43:13 2015 UTC,Dude I know exactly how you feel.  I have heard conversations about me before while I was practicing alone.  It really can get into my head and mess with my game.  I try to use it when it happens.  I focus even harder and want it even more.  You may have stressful games in the future with distractions that you will have to tune out.  The guy obviously must have a shitty life to be able to do that to another person.  I wouldn't have to be a pool fan either to say that guy is a piece of shit.

billiards,2scwht,WildWeaselV,2,Wed Jan 14 07:39:42 2015 UTC,Find a local pool hall in your area.  When i started out a few years ago a lot of the older guys would help me out and give me pointers.  And Practice...practice...practice.  There are hundreds of videos online along with drill demos.  Keep your head up and stay on the tables!

I feel like everyone watching the game is now silently judging me or writing me off as a competent player.  It's one of those things I never felt when I practice alone.    So, in a way, the guy in your post was challenging you to improve your own internal state of calm.  It may not be pleasant to experience, and certainly not deserved by a player that just wants to relax and practice, but who knows... it may help in the long run."

It's always practicing.  From your narrative, it does sound like this guy was simply a class A. Don't give these kind of people the time of day. learn how to detect them, let them have their game, then beat them.   If someone's trying to rustle or hustle you, don't get shook. If you're not as good  as them, learn from them.  Also, don't let people play at your table before they're able to beat you in a few matches.   As far as the game goes, get your own cue and stick to fundamentals. If you have an open table to practice on you'll be better than them in no time."

If anyone well, maybe not a pro I recognized, but if someone walked up to a table I was playing on and did what you described, I would have told the guy to ""fuck off I didn't ask for his help, now get the fuck off my table."" Furthermore, if you are young it's likely he is too. So the chances are you just ran into a guy who grew up playing on his daddies pool table. Let that sink in. You weren't bested by anyone, and the guy sounds like a total prick. If I were you I would not let it bother me and keep doing what you're doing.  For what it's worth I never owned a table. But I had two friends growing up who did. And many times they took pleasure in beating me in less than sportsman like manners. Today, those guys won't play me. I can't even give em a spot. Because though they had lots of table time, they never really practiced. But as the years passed, I had to search out places to play, and i did, and through the years I got better. Don't get me wrong, I'm no champion. But definately the best player in my neighborhood."
billiards,2scwht,crunch816,1 point,Wed Jan 14 16:40:00 2015 UTC,"I've been playing for a while now, I'm almost thirty. Let me tell you, I ran into several of these douches when I was younger and just starting out. They would slam the ball and make something then be like ""wow your not so gsure or for owning your own cue.""  That fucking stung, every time. But a few years ago after id been playing a while and got pretty good, I mostly only played pool halls where I avoided this behavior. Well I went to the bar to play on their crappy table. This big muscley douche comes up and decides he's gonna beat me. He was exceptionally rude, I'm not nearly as big as he is. Anyway, I break, get nothing, he shoots and makes 2 or 3 in. He totally thinks he's hot shit. I step up and run out to the 8 ball. He misses his next shot, clearly no thought for where the cue would land. I win. He's pissed but the line of people behind him basically tell him to move it along. It was one of the most gratifying moments of my pool life. I know it sucks now, to feel like you're no good, but keep practicing and drilling, eventually none of those assholes will even be close to you. I've had several of those moments of glory now, they are just as good as that first time. Yours is coming, use that as some motivation to keep going."

Don't talk, just concentrate on the game whether you're up shooting or waiting to shoot.  Think what you're going to do when it your turn to shoot.  It increases your concentration, and if you're playing a loudmouth, it seems to screw up theirs...especially if they're losing.  When they realize they can't get to you, it seems to have the opposite effect and they end up sharking themselves."

What exactly is a glove changing or progressing? Two, gloves don't help anything other than allowing your cue to slide. I have very sweaty hands and would never use a glove. It's called soap and water / cleaning products. Take care of your cue and it will be good to you, no need for chalk/ gloves. As for it improving your game, it doesnt, period.  Lastly, I use the term fag very lightly. Sorry if it got your panties in a bunch because you're one of those sensitive little flowers that has to cry that things aren't politically correct. Fag is a great word and to me, has nothing to do with homosexuality.

Eventually you'll end up playing some big ego at the bar... This is when I take the opportunity to absolutely destroy them in front of her, doubles or even singles. She'll realize you were much better than you led on and, in my case, she got her mind blown a bit and thought it was hilarious I kept it from her for so long.   In one case, playing doubles with her, the guy kept screaming ""What!"" as I made more difficult cuts and banks, bringing attention to the shots and then challenged me to a singles game where I stepped it up further.

The both of you just stated that the ball that was trying to be made could go/not go. IMO he won the bet because the ball went in and that was the main focus of the situation. Now let me ask you, did you say the shot wouldn't go because he would scratch, or did you say the shot wouldn't go because you didn't think the ball go through/past another ball into the pocket?"
billiards,2s96g6,IFVoltaire,1 point,Tue Jan 13 06:14:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of this.  If you bet on whether ""a shot would go,"" I think he wins if he makes the ball, unless you brought up the scratch as being an issue in the shot or you specifically stated it had to be a legal shot."
billiards,2s96g6,BlowAndHookers,1 point,Tue Jan 13 07:08:57 2015 UTC,This is accurate. You have to be clear on the rules of the bet. No set of rules anywhere governs that bet except the ones you guys delineate.
billiards,2s96g6,HighPlainsDrinker,3,Tue Jan 13 16:31:41 2015 UTC,"Nope, you couldn't rake the table because that's not a shot. You bet whether the shot would go or not. It went. You lost the bet, and it only costs you 10$ to keep your word. This is an easy payoff in my mind. By not paying him, hell even by just delaying him his payment he will be less likely to trust your word in the future. When gambling, all you got is your word. No one has time to hammer out written contracts so yes there are usually large swaths of grey areas in many bets. The scratch option in your situation I would have mentioned beforehand, why? Because it's a good back door in case he does make it, but that's all beside the point. Pay your friend, tell him you were being a whiney bitch for no reason then ask him to play 8 ball and you will spot him 2 balls.

billiards,2s96g6,S0cr8t3s,1 point,Tue Jan 13 16:41:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah then sorry buddy. The problem with this situation is that when he said he could pocket the ball and the shot would go, you didn't ask him if he thought he would scratch as well. This is almost like if we were to say, a person states that they can pot the 8 off the break and even though he/she makes the 8, he/she scratches. Sure it isn't a legal shot, but there were no rules stated beforehand that the 8 ball had to be made legally. It just had to go in. Sorry for the situation though. :("
billiards,2s96g6,IFVoltaire,2,Tue Jan 13 16:51:25 2015 UTC,"Was the word ""go"" actually used? Whether or not a shot will go has nothing to do with scratching IMO."
billiards,2s96g6,mingpow,3,Tue Jan 13 17:23:33 2015 UTC,"He was clever/lucky enough to make the shot, but he knows he didn't legally pocket it and is exploiting a loophole in the bet. Give him his dirty $10; just don't forget to give him a raised eyebrow as you hand it to him."
billiards,2s96g6,TheJawsofIce,2,Wed Jan 14 17:23:46 2015 UTC,Basically this. Plus paying him ensures future action. Most people who gamble don't get that. Gambling is like a business funnell. You keep putting into it and it keeps coming back. But if you rip off one guy it can ruin the whole thing.
billiards,2s96g6,too_lazy_2_punctuate,2,Tue Jan 13 10:43:21 2015 UTC,"I'm actually going to refrain from judgement because I don't feel like I have enough information about the circumstances of the bet...    From what you've described, I can see a ton of factors that would determine who's being the jerk, including;    1)Table-talk being such that it is, he has BIH or something on the 8ball that's positioned so that if you hit it in the corner, you're scratching 99% of the time... In that case, he's a jerk for trying to pull one over on you even though it'd be clear from context that you meant he can't make that shot legally.    2)Let's say random balls were between the object ball and the cue ball, and to pocket the object ball he had to do some crazy two rail kick-combo that you thought was impossible and he actually pulled it off... Then scratched. The bet would pretty clearly imply that there's no way he could pull off a 1:1000 shot like that, but he did (and scratched as well)! You'd be the jerk for claiming the bet was about the legal pocketing, when it pretty clearly was about being able to make the shot.    And, of course, there are the other infinite scenarios between those two.    My suspicion is that the truth lies somewhere in the middle; you intended the bet to be about pocketing the ball legally and he intended the bet to be pocketing the ball (regardless). It's impossible to know for sure, but if this is the case then my vote is to make a second bet/contest to settle this first one."
billiards,2s96g6,joshuarion,2,Tue Jan 13 18:31:59 2015 UTC,If my buddy tried that shit he wouldn't get a penny.  It's implied that a scratch always negates a shot in my opinion.  He is just trying to get outta paying.

billiards,2s8r61,slorebear,0,Fri Jan 16 21:40:01 2015 UTC,"I would first recommend that you avoid 'Player's' cues at all costs. They are low-quality cues that are not built to last. They are not even worth the ~$100 they usually sell for.  How much are you willing to spend on a cue? Sometimes you can find some decent or good quality custom cues for cheap on Ebay. I would also strongly recommend not buying cues that are imported.  Good quality cue tips are also important, and everyone has their preference. Not only the brand, but how hard/soft they are, whether they are multi-layered or not, etc.   Before making the plunge and buying something from ebay, you might want to check the wanted/for sale message board section of Azbilliards.com, it's a pretty active site for pool players and plenty of custom cue makers as well. Name your price and you will get offers, and I can guarantee they are almost always better than 'Player's' brand cues.   http://forums.azbilliards.com/forumdisplay.php?f=5  There is a buyer/seller transaction report stickied at the top. Check there to make sure that the person you are buying from is reputable. You can also ask for advice on a good first cue in your price range."

If you can play you can run out with any cue. Sometimes you can find some decent quality sneaky petes for about $100 on ebay.   I worked at a pool hall for about seven years, and the owner of the pool room was also a cue repairman. He had a lathe set up in a back room and was a part time cue maker himself, but more as a hobby. Anyways, a good 80% of the cues that were brought to him for repair due to defective quality over the time I worked there were Player's brand cues. The most common problems (aside from warped shafts, which is a given for maple that isn't cured enough) were the wrap unraveling, loose ferrules, and sometimes ring and joint problems as well.  Another pool hall not too far away had a lot of tables including bar tables, which attracted pool leagues. Naturally that pool hall started selling Player's and Cuetecs to the league players, and a lot of their traffic came to us.   Of course this doesn't happen with all Player's cues of course. Just as you mentioned, I've seen people play with old beat up ones over the years as well."

I draw the cue straight back from the ball on my practice stroke, but it seems more often than not I'm off line when I stroke at the cue ball. Close in shots and close in cue ball control I'm generally ok, but long shots go awry half the time. It's really holding up my game.

billiards,2s8u8d,The_shady_burrito,1 point,Thu Jan 15 00:24:27 2015 UTC,"Have you ever filmed yourself playing or had somebody take a short cell phone video if not I would start by doing that than watching and looking to see if you notice anything,   Things to look for are you rushing the shot, do you stay down, unwanted body movement,   Another way  you could test is to put all 15 balls on the table, just start shooting random shots, what you would do different is line up the shot normally get down on shot take your practice strokes annd before you pull back before your backstroke close your eyes and shoot do not open them until you hear balls stop rolling or ball going in, this can help you feel your stroke  I think pulling the cue back real  slowly on your backstroke and than pausing at the end before shooting would help with this,  It may take a couple of practice sessions to get used to but i think it could help (Watch videos of Allison Fisher or Buddy Hall they both used this stroking method)  Another thing you can do is can an empty bottle it could be water bottle,soda bottle,beer bottle etc, and practice stroking back and forth, than once you can do that good step back get in stance and approach the bottle like it was the cue ball and you getting ready to shoot the shot, than practice stroking back and forth again, Try to do it at different sppeds,using different bridges etc  Another way is put your cue over the diamonds on the side rail make sure the cue is covering the diamonds than stroke back and forth, making sure the diamonds stay covered by the cue during your stroking motions  Another thing you can do is called barrier training(there is a video on youtube of dr cue explaining it if you need more insight) Basically you put something like a pool case on the pool table against the side rails pin your backarm/hand snuggle against the case and start stroking back and forth,   Also one of the biggest reasons for people swaying is too much upper arm movement, try to remember only part of your body should be moving is from the elbow down,    Hope this helps"

Overall, it's probably near 50/50 that I make the correction I needed or mess up a shot that was fine, but it makes it impossible to improve because nothing's bolted down.

Every single one of his For Sale posts describes a cue that I would love to see pictures of though.

Also, some people shoot faster and more carelessly the harder the shot is, but that's more a beginner's tendency. Another common one is speeding up unnecessarily as you get further into a run, culminating in a botched key ball shot.   Eta: Not standing up and re-aiming when you get distracted or change your mind on spin. Not selecting a break out ball at the beginning of a rack or going for a break out too late. Oh, and breaking harder and harder when you keep breaking dry instead of changing up the break position."

It's critical to maintain your aiming posture until the follow-through as moving your body slightly upward changes the aim and english to the cue ball.

billiards,2s3s51,portajohnjackoff,2,Mon Jan 12 10:08:02 2015 UTC,"They play too fast.  I've been guilty of this myself.  It doesn't mean that they step up and shoot immediately (though they may) it means that everything they do is quick.  They consider and dismiss a shot quickly, or stroke to quickly, or walk around the table fast.  When I start to play badly and get in my head, it's my instinct to try to play more fluidly and quickly so I don't over-think. I've found that when I'm playing poorly, it's best to slooowwww down. This has two benefits: first I don't make any rash decisions or movements.  For obvious reasons this is good. The second, is that even if I miss and continue to suck, slowing down the game will often frustrate your opponent.  I don't try to be a dick about it, but forcing them to wait just 20 or 30 seconds while I consider shots, then giving them a crappy leave on top of that, and doing this several times in a row can have a devastating impact on an opponents perception of the flow of the game.  Even if they are winning and you can't hit crap, they start to feel the initiative slipping.  It basically changes their state of mind to yours.  I should note, this second reason works best on mid range players.  Most higher level players I've met are very patient when they need to be and lower level players (often newer players) don't really notice as much."

billiards,2s1n11,matlockga,2,Sun Jan 11 08:06:18 2015 UTC,"Composite cues, or cues that are coated with plastic or fiberglass or any other synthetic material are fantastic for use as vehicle hood props, garden stakes, and window prop sticks due to their resistance to moisture from the coating on the wood.   Unfortunately, they are not good for playing pool. The reason they are coated with composite materials is a cost saving decision. Inferior woods that are, themselves, wholly unsuitable for pool cue construction can be made to last a minimal amount of time with the application of a layer of composite material on the outside.   A blank of good quality maple wood that is of the quality to build a pool cue may cost two or three dollars each. An inferior blank with knots and unfavorable grain characteristics cost about ten cents. It costs about a quarter to add a composite coating to a cue, so the production costs of a composite cue are in the ballpark of about a fourth of the cost of making a cue with traditional high quality woods.  In most cases, you'll be much better off to spend a few more dollars and invest in an entry-level traditional solid wood pool cue."

But I don't remember the weight distribution being out of the norm with it.   Can you describe the weight total and distribution you are looking for?  There are tons of different ways to get the distribution you want. If I knew what you were looking for I might be able to broaden your selection list a little bit.

It has a CF wrapped shaft, too.   There's nothing wrong with it. I used it as a break cue until a year or two ago.   I use custom cues now, but if that's the feel you want, then there's nothing wrong with that. It never hurt game any, not even a little bit."

Try going to different campuses, not just the one you go to.  Some apartment complexes have a game room, one I lived at had no cues but a great table, so I brought my own and played for hours a day for free.  You gotta explore the city and try finding tables all over, ask them if they ever open up the tables for a set rate, those will be cheaper.    Also with $1/game bar boxes, you can play 9-ball and a bonus 6-ball game, or practice shooting 4 balls in order.  That gives you more practice per dollar than playing 8-ball.  If you find a place where the bartender's cool with you, you can put cups in the bar box table to keep the balls from falling.  Most places will ban you if they catch that though."

Those days have a flat $12 rate from 7pm to close (usually around 12:30). That flat rate is for the table and independent of the number of people on the table.   The tables are admittedly shitty though. Nine foot tables. Only about six of them (out of twenty) have been felted recently. Each table has at least one pocket that is lower that pops back any ball hit into it with any amount of speed. Music is loud and the people who play usually aren't players, but rather people who are drinking and just happen to be playing at the same time.  (The type of players who don't understand that other people are playing and who do stuff like sit on the tables or put their drinks on the rails).  Street parking in dtsj can be difficult to find at night. They don't validate at any of the downtown lots either.   I'm there every Monday despite these drawbacks, mostly because I live within walking distance and everyone there knows me. They've got a full bar and decent daily drink specials. Also have a handful of regulars on Mondays that would play for fun.  We've tried to run eight ball tourneys on Mondays but we've had a hard time getting enough people who are interested in playing most weeks.   420 S 1st Street, San Jose CA"

She of course told us and showed us that a lot of people use the loop bridge, but she prefers the snooker bridge, probably as snooker was what she started playing first.  Worth every dollar of the $800.  Only 2 other people came to the training, so it was almost private lessons.  We all went to dinner Fri and Sat night and to drinks Sun night.  Best 2 days of pool ever!  What was even more interesting was that even in a pretty crowded pool room in a pretty populated city, only a handful of people recognized her.

Similarly, in snooker physical strength and athleticism are not significant factors that affect performance, and in fact the main professional tour is open to both men and women. Allison herself was briefly a member, but never progressed into the sport's upper levels. The only other female I can remember on the main tour was Reanne Evans who was awarded a place on the professional main tour for the 2010–11 season. She was allowed to play on the main tour without having to go through the usual qualification process, presumably in an effort to drum up some publicity. Despite the fact that she'd absolutely dominated women's snooker, she failed to win a single match and was relegated from the tour at the end of her first season."

Round robin format with even-up races going to 65, 85, 100 and 125 depending on the division.  Ratings are refined over the season and the top 48 across all divisions enter a single elimination handicapped playoff over a couple of weeks at the end of the regular season.  Stats-wise all you get from the league is a ball count and w/l ratio. I keep my own sheets with innings stats, successful safeties types of foul committed etc. but that's just to track my own progress.  The room has their own website for posting schedules and results and the league has started using Brackelope for playoff brackets.

Drunk kid talking a bunch of shit in spite of the fact that he can't hold a pool stick.  Random dude comes over and calls the kid out.  Says he'll play one rack for everything the kids got and dude is going to shoot with a broomstick.  Only thing the older guy insisted on was getting the break.  We give the old guy a shitty little broom with a hollow aluminum handle with which he proceeds to break with and absolutely smash the rack.  By the time the older guy gets down to his fourth or fifth ball its pretty clear he's going to run out and the kid hasn't been back up to the table yet.

billiards,2roy86,petermgates,5,Thu Jan 8 04:17:10 2015 UTC,Five laps of the table and 20 push ups.   Or ball in hand to your opponent.

I mean if you bump balls by accident with your stick it's not a foul, at least not APA rules (not that I'm a big fan of APA)."
billiards,2roy86,unoriginalsin,1 point,Thu Jan 8 17:19:03 2015 UTC,There's no opponent's discretion in APA rules. All accidentally disturbed balls must be returned to their original position.
billiards,2roy86,parlarry,1 point,Thu Jan 8 20:34:39 2015 UTC,"OK well regardless, wouldn't that be what happened here?"
billiards,2roy86,unoriginalsin,1 point,Thu Jan 8 20:59:48 2015 UTC,"Debateable.  The rules are not entirely clear on what happens when a ball other than the cue ball is deliberately struck with a normal stroke as though it were the cue ball. You could call this accidental, but I don't think that quite fits. This situation isn't explicitly covered by the rules, so I think we have to apply the accidentally moved balls rule."
billiards,2roy86,parlarry,1 point,Fri Jan 9 09:14:25 2015 UTC,"Right. It seems like pool has weird scenarios that aren't explicitly defined in the rules happen more than anything else. I'm guessing if he's mistaking the nine ball for the cue ball his opponent would have mercy and just apply the accidentally moved balls rule, like you said."
billiards,2roy86,unoriginalsin,1 point,Fri Jan 9 14:24:20 2015 UTC,"Well, these situations are covered in the WPA rules, but I don't think APA explicitly references them and they don't define what constitutes making a legal shot is. So you could argue that shooting the 9 ball was his shot and since the cue ball didn't strike another ball or a rail, it would be ball in hand."
billiards,2roy86,RoadHustler,1 point,Fri Jan 9 19:44:51 2015 UTC,"As long as you aren't playing all ball fouls, didn't move the cue ball during your shot and the balls can be restored to their original position the only violation would be unsportsmanlike conduct or missuse of equipment. Both of thoes are loss of game or possibly loss of match. If you moved the cue ball in the shot it would be ball in hand."
billiards,2roy86,herkybird70,1 point,Thu Jan 8 17:22:11 2015 UTC,"But because he made the other stripe, in most rule sets if accidental contact results in a ball being pocketed it is a foul and results in BIH."
billiards,2roy86,Gunslingermomo,1 point,Fri Jan 16 04:28:31 2015 UTC,"When I read this post I'm not thinking it's talking about an accident, but someone thinking that if it's the same penalty as ball in hand, you could just as well hit an object ball as the cue ball for position.  If I was ruling on that though, I'd say you're not even making an attempt at the game and therefore it's a forfeit and you lose the game."

Very reputable fella and well known on the UK pool scene.  The problem you're going to have is that £20-30 just isn't enough money to be buying a pool cue in the UK really. It'll get you a junker with a screw on tip from Argos, but you might as well go to B&Q and buy a broom handle.  I paid about £40 for my first cue, and it's a total pile of shit (although it did get me through 2 league seasons). The only thing you'll get for that price in the UK now are Stingers - which have a horrible fibreglass coating on the shaft, which makes it horrible to play without a glove... and stuff like BCE cues from Argos. In all honesty, you might as well just use house cues."
billiards,2rn0gz,petermgates,1 point,Wed Jan 7 18:54:34 2015 UTC,Do you play UK pool (reds/yellows) on a 7ft table?  I ask as the balls and pockets are little smaller than US-style pool. Typically you play with a cue more similar to a snooker cue.  I would just go with the regular size. That will be what she is used to already.  I've used Billiards Boutique in the past and had no problems.

I remember when it suddenly appeared here in my area of the country. Pool halls were absolutely hemorrhaging players. You couldn't hardly go to a familiar tournament without seeing and hearing about the long list of pool players who quit or seriously reduced their pool playing so they could play Hold'em instead.   Many who quit never came back to pool. Others only came back after years and years of cards finally got boring to them."

You will always have locals playing each other from $20-$100 a set but honestly when you play against someone who can run 4 racks in a row it discourages gambling against that person, so they go on the blacklist for a while. Most locals that are halfway decent can't get any action because they've already played and beat whoever tries to step up, and the word spreads like wildfire out here. When action from out of town shows up, they fight like dogs amongst each other for it.   As far as shady players and such, well you can go anywhere and find yourself playing someone shady, or someone who you doubt will pay out at the end of the match.

billiards,2rim8b,Gilandb,2,Tue Jan 6 18:54:25 2015 UTC,"I know a guy who's 70+ and his take on it is that legalized gambling killed the game as far as gambling.  If a guy's got an itch to gamble, he can buy scratch offs or hit a casino these days.  He said that in the 60's he could walk into any bar and get a game going for $20 a rack.  Nowadays if you can even get two guys to even talk about playing a race for $50, they'll haggle over the spot for 2 hours and then end up not playing.  Also, we had a road player who bumped around my area for a while and it really was not a glamorous life.  He lived in his van basically had to play tournaments to make a living.  The way he explained it, ""hustling"" is basically dead.  Anyone who doesn't play pool assumes anybody who can hold a stick is a hustler and so they won't gamble.  And anyone who was half way decent expected him to give up a huge spot.  So he was basically stuck playing tournaments and scraping by.  Eventually he got banned from all the local tourneys and moved on.  Now on the other hand, while I've never been to Vegas personally, I've known a few people who went there for APA nationals.  From what I've been told if you're interested in action it's everywhere for events like that.  Not being from Vegas I have no idea what it's like week in and week out, though."

Was there one time and a middle age guy came in and wanted the guy at the next table to give his son a chance to win his money back. Seems he took the kid for around 7200 the night before. They hassled him until he just paid his tab and left. People there consider $20 a rack as not gambling. Don't know, could be just the transit nature of college students. That place used to get a lot of high rated players there. They used to have a 10+1 tourney once a week. haven't been there in a couple of years, so don't know if it is still that way."

That's when people who have other sources of income and don't rely on this money to eat can play for $50 or $100 and not mind losing. Nobody is winning or losing enough money for it to affect their life enough to resort to violence, cheating, or simply not paying, and it's all about the thrill and fun of it, not whether you eat tonight or not.  The kind of gambling the OP is talking about, where you play to make good money (enough to make a living), and you rely on that money to eat, you are most of the time playing against people that live in pool halls and will do anything to win, or anything to avoid losing. This goes for anything that isn't exactly legal and involves large sums of money. It's definitely not the safest or easiest way to make a living."

Plenty of people would cheat for $20 and plenty others would hand over an agreed upon sum of money in the thousands because they are straight up and like a good high-tension match-up. Not everyone's definition of a good life is a 401k and church on Sundays.

My point is that you can take any honest straight up person in the world and place them in a situation where if they lose this match they don't eat tonight, and out of necessity they will do things they would not normally do. People who gamble for fun and don't rely on the money have no incentive to do anything shady, whereas everything changes when you completely rely on that income.

billiards,2rjnd2,S0cr8t3s,6,Tue Jan 6 19:48:56 2015 UTC,"This subject is beaten to death, and though I like the occasional hypothetical discussion, there is no simple answer or yes/no responses to your suggestions. It's going to take a true visionary with unlimited ambition to pull it off, and there's no telling what the one ""right"" way to do it is.  With that said, what I would love to see is one united national body for pool that can partner with regional tournaments, and players can go to a single website to see their stats and how they are progressing vs. everyone else.   Tournaments are too much about money (cost vs. earnings) and not enough about competition and improvement. This is because it costs so much to travel to tournaments (plus entry fee, food/drink, and possibly a hotel room), the average player goes 2 and out and spends hours just sitting around not playing, and the only real metric for how you did is based off of whether you placed in the money or not.   There's no measure to how someone has improved over the years or how you stack up with the rest of the competition, except for tournament-specific systems based off an arbitrary amount of points you get for where you place each tournament, which then resets after each season.   People would also be less intimidated if tournaments were separated into ""A, B, C"" class tournaments so a 2 in the APA doesn't have to play Earl Strickland. This also gets rid of the handicapping systems which all have their flaws, and people always complain about. Good players need to let go of the assumption that ""everyone gets better by playing better players"" is an excuse for average players to travel and spend money to get their asses kicked by pros. Yes, there is truth to that statement, and it is awesome to play against pros every now and then, but people will only get discouraged over time if this persists. They need to play people better, but still in the same ""class"" as themselves to really see steady improvement, without getting discouraged. This is a concept many pool tour directors don't seem to get.  If players had a single ELO rating like in chess, instead of ""A, B, C"" which mean different things for different areas/tournaments, players would be able to see their improvement and know where they rank against everyone else. If people had this kind of official rating, they would seek out tournaments to play in to improve their rating, and it wouldn't be just about money. That rating would be a very specific number that they get to keep forever, and they can always strive to improve. It would tell them exactly how good of a player they are and where they stand against everyone else. Nowadays, there's no universal way to easily tell someone else how good you are. You can say, well I'm a 6 in the APA in 9-ball, an A- in so-and-so's tournament, and I give John Smith the 8. It's ridiculous. It would be so great to just have to say to someone that you just met, who lives accross the country from you, ""I'm 1824.""  For now, tournaments are doomed, and leagues are where all of the recreational players will be, because they are local, cheap, take only a few hours one night a week, and the average player gets to play against people of equal strength."

billiards,2rjnd2,joshuarion,5,Thu Jan 8 20:01:07 2015 UTC,"Interesting question...    I think we need to approach it like a combination of the poker boom and golf.    It's essentially a two-stage revival approach: 1) create new public interest and 2) ensure continued interest...    Poker is, essentially a boring game. Most of the time players are folding pre-flop or shortly after, pots are generally not very large and most of the time is spent listening to your ipod or chatting with other players. Ocassionally there's an exciting pot; someone picks a hand to bluff huge or blinds are so high that someone's all in with 27offsuit or something exciting. But somehow interest in poker exploded in the earl 2000s. Why? The main reason is ESPN's coverage of the WSOP Main Event. The idea is brilliant: take pre-recorded footage from the ~100hrs of gameplay involving THOUSANDS of participants, edit it down to the most exciting 100 minutes, add a few interviews and other voice-over features and have commenters who are knowledgeable and entertaining to listen to. Poker Boom.    After that people got interested. Then they started playing poker. THEN they started wanting to watch long hours of poker-streamers, online poker players, etc... Because before they knew about poker, all they saw were guys folding all the time. After they read books, read forums, etc, they understood more about the game and wanted to see the subtler moments play out.    This can work for pool as well... Record a major tournament (to start), edit down the most exciting shots, get a couple guys who are knowledgable and entertaining to comment on the pre-recorded shots and boom, suddenly it's interesting.    Five years ago you couldn't pay me to watch a one-pocket match. Now I'm spending my evenings (when alone) popping popcorn and watching archive footage of 8 ahead matches that last 9hrs.    New games like Bonus Ball will not work because it's focusing on a perceived weakness that doesn't exist. Honestly, whoever the marketing guys were for that league need to be fired. An honest and extensive SWOT analysis would have shown that the Opportunity is a giant world of people who enjoy casual competitive games and the Threat is that exposure/interest in pool is declining. That should lead you to the conclusion that you need to figure out a way to expose new people to the game. Instead they made a game for pool players that has a rule system so complicated that the players/captains/announcers and even the referees get confused sometimes.    Sorry for the long post. Thanks for reading. I'm a marketing guy and this question hits me in my passions. :)"
billiards,2rjnd2,joshuarion,3,Thu Jan 8 22:33:06 2015 UTC,"I agree that this format could grab the attention of non-fans, causing many people who tune in to get hooked. Pool is such an addictive game that having knowledgable and entertaining commentators explain individual shots, what makes some more difficult, and considering the options at the players disposal could very well work. Many people who never watched pro pool before but play socially would flood into their local halls to try and play the game a bit more seriously. Once beginning to appreciate the difficulty and complexity of the game. Airing one really difficult shot/rack after another certainly holds my attention for a while but context is also important to me.   The sheer amount of money is what draws so many people to poker. With those percentages up, the full information given by pocket cams and the sometimes sick satisfaction given by being able to watch it play out is very entertaining. A single hand that takes five minutes at the final table, could cost a person millions in payout. Pool is more of a grind for less money and a single moment rarely has the same potential excitement. So I'm not sure if it could be filmed and aired in the exact same way but with the right commentators it would have a chance.  Over time, I think a 'World Series of poker' style pool tournament could be really successful. First few episodes short highlight games and shots, in later ones you get to watch whole matches. Giving amateurs an opportunity to get into it while also satisfying serious players. After a few years, people would be playing in local tournaments to win paid entry and I bet money would be pouring into the industry.   If you were in charge of marketing for a first time event, how would you approach it?"
billiards,2rjnd2,LEGITIMATE_SOURCE,2,Thu Jan 8 18:34:35 2015 UTC,"If you were in charge of marketing for a first time event, how would you approach it?     Someone pitched the WSOP format to ESPN and they threw money at it... Similarly, you saw a rise in interest in competitive gaming once MLG threw money at events...    It'd take patience, time/energy but mostly money to do... Bonus Ball had all of the necessary resources but really blew it IMHO.    One of the reasons the WSOP format took off is that Hold 'Em is easy to follow superficially. You can teach someone the basics of the game in a few hours. Many people who caught the Main Event have (at least a few times) played a few hands of poker here and there, so it was easy to see that player A is beating player B because player A has a flush.    If we use the success of the WSOP Main Event/Poker Boom phenomena as an example, then we need a game that most people are familiar with and can follow. So,  8ball! Many people that are bar goers have at least picked up a pool cue once in their life and know that one player is stripes and the other solids. It's easy to follow.    If given unlimited resources, I'd try to get new sponsors on board, cuemakers/chalk companies/apparel/energy drinks, the works. Stuff to attract visitors that would normally be interested in a large pool tournament. Then I'd host an invitational 8ball tournament with +10% added to the money pool and a guaranteed prize pool minimum.    There's a ton of minor details and 'gimmicky' things we can do to it, but the basics are important: make it exciting and interesting for people to watch that have never paid attention to pool before.      It will take time and patience... Probably a big company like ESPN or NBC. I'm not saying it will happen, but there's definitely a reason why the average age of the guys on my pool league is 42 and the youngest player we have is 25. :/"

Often, some of the biggest improvements people make in their pool game is finding ways to eliminate variables from their game. Finding a dedicated break cue can sometimes go a long way to removing variables from that particular shot.   I happen to have a few jump/break cues available for sale on my official facebook cue page.

They make this terrible ""twang"" sound whenever I try to break with them, and the tips are complete trash (or so they appear to be).  I was looking at what u/PrecipitASIAN was suggesting, and it seems like a very good choice. I guess the one thing I'm worried about is if this is something I actually need as opposed to something that'll only benefit me a little. Also, is breaking with your playing cue really that bad? Forgive me if this is a stupid question but I really have no clue."
billiards,2rjbsz,gabrielleigh,2,Wed Jan 7 09:48:52 2015 UTC,"Breaking with a playing cue has some potential consequences. A lot of it depends on your break style and the strength you break the balls with. Most break styles can fall within two categories, although many break styles are often a hybrid style that utilize a bit of both major styles. There are ""control"" breakers who use a medium strength break and look to hold the cueball in a very specific place on the table after it hits the rack. There are also ""power"" breakers who use raw strength and often unpredictable english to move lots and lots of balls to increase their chance of pocketing something.   ""Control"" breakers can often be very successful breaking with a playing cue, and due to the nature of their break they see less potential to damage their playing cue. Control breakers often break with a similar stroke to any strong shooting stroke they would use while pocketing balls during the game. Power breakers often put enormous amounts of strength and leverage behind their cue during the break, and this can have very significant effects on the condition of the cue over a short period of time. Soft and medium hardness leather playing tips will suffer from the effects of ""mushrooming"", chunking, flattening, hardening, and delamination of layers in many cases. Ferrules of inferiour quality will also suffer from cracking, splitting, chunking, and becoming loose from the impact of breaking.   So here is where you find yourself having to decide what is ""worth it"". If you play a couple hours a week with friends, and you break a handful of racks each week, then investing in a break cue is harder to justify. I'd aim to purchase a good, cheap cue that you can stick in your case and not worry too much about the way it looks or anything. If you catch yourself in a hot streak where you are dominating the table and breaking a lot, then you'll have a cheap cue that will absorb the brunt of the damage of breaking.   If you find yourself playing considerably more pool, and your skill level allows you to consistently and regularly win games and earn the break on the next rack, then you will have much more justification for investing in a better quality break cue at that point. The justification comes in the reduction of maintenance expense on your playing cue. Many of my customers spend $50 to $100 a year having tips replaced, ferrules fixed, and other types of damage repaired on their playing cues. Often this work is the result of damage caused from powerful strokes during break shots. Not only do they have the financial expense of repairing the cue from this damage, but often this damage occurs in the middle of league or tournament play, thus rendering their playing cue useless for the remainder of the day. This can be a huge psychological factor if they have to suddenly switch to another cue or borrow one from someone to finish their play.   So in some cases, the investment of a breaking cue can provide substantial reductions in wear and tear on a playing cue. It is completely a personal decision, and there is no real ""universal"" standard for whether you should get one or not. The only thing that will ever matter is whether you are happy you bought one or not."
billiards,2rjbsz,thepottsy,1 point,Wed Jan 7 18:10:25 2015 UTC,"Not a stupid question, also not really a consistent answer for it.  Do you really need it?  No.  Could you benefit from it?  Possibly.  See, no great answers to this question.  Breaking with your playing cue, isn't that bad.  Keep in mind the whole break cue thing, is relatively new in the grand scheme of billiards.  A lot of it is dependent on your break technique.  For example, me and a friend of mine are roughly the same height and weight.  He prefers a light weight break cue, while I prefer one that has a little more weight to it.  We have completely different break techniques.  The only similarity is we are both right handed, and we are both aiming at the cue ball.  Anyway, you know the old saying, YMMV."

For breaks, I usually just switch the shaft on my playing cue (haven't gotten to the point of getting an entirely separate cue for breaking). Is this potentially harmful to the butt of my playing cue? Also, I was wondering if my breaking cue setup would be legal in most APA leagues if you happen to know that as well."
billiards,2rjbsz,gabrielleigh,1 point,Thu Feb 19 05:16:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know of anything that might be harmful from doing that. Breaking is hard on ferrules, tips, and joint collars more than anything. You are saving your playing shaft from a lot of wear and tear by switching, so that is good. I think that is legal in all formats, too. Not for sure, though"
billiards,2rjbsz,petermgates,3,Thu Feb 19 19:55:26 2015 UTC,"Break cues have generated some heated debate in the past.  Some people break with their regular stick and suffer no ill effects. It is probably dependent on what the cue is made of - laminated shafts and (expensive) soft tips can be damaged whereas a hard tip and solid maple shaft should hold up better.  Some people use a house cue for breaking rather than buying something special. These cues usually fall into the solid wood/hard tip category noted above.  Some people buy a cue marketed as a specialized break cue and report improvement in their breaking ability. Whether this is because of the materials used to construct the cue, consistency from using and understanding the same piece of equipment or something else was subject to debate.  Personally I only acquired a break cue when I realized the tournament I was going to wouldn't have house cues for me to use. It's an old playing cue that I had a water buffalo tip put on. Does exactly what I need of it but then I'm not into throwing my whole body into a break shot.  I've tried break cues by Fury, Players, Predator and Poison. All got the job done but I couldn't tell you if one was better than the others."
billiards,2rjbsz,Texaskid89,0,Tue Jan 6 19:52:47 2015 UTC,"I'd like to ad consistency aswell. Meaning once or if you practice/use a breakstick you'll learn the better breaking patterns/points for an effective break and Qball control without the worry of breaking off your playing stick tip or damaging shafts i.e. OB shafts. I use my playing cue that has ring work but zero inlays and it has a hard water buffalo tip. I can draw immensely when in stroke. True you can draw or get more english with a soft tip very easily with way less effort, but use hard tips for full cue jumps and breaking. I like using my playing stick for now. But I have in certain times try my usual breaks to no avail and borrowed a friends breaking cue and saw better results. I asked myself later why is this, well it factors so much as: (A) perhaps i wasn't following through my stroke (B) the break/ jumps have phenolic tips (C) some have extra hard leather tips (D) some weigh more, which is very easy to say when my playing cue weighs 18.4 oz."

I've always just used whatever unwarped house cue I could find and honestly I kinda think I get better results with the tip on the house cue. It could be the tip, maybe I'm not breaking right, I dunno, but I'm somewhat disappointed. Its an Action break/jump cue, like $80-$100. I still like it for the jumping ability though, although I admit I suck at jumping. :)"

Pawn shops are required by law to report every item they purchase. This includes the make, model, and serial information. If your cue is lost or stolen, file a police report then contact SNAGG to report it and they immediately scan the digital databases of the FBI, pawnshops nationwide, Ebay, Craigslist and other online sources. If it is found, local authorities are notified to obtain the merchandise to be scanned and positively ID’d as yours using one of 400,000 standard pet scanners available nationwide. If a scanner is not available one will be shipped directly from SNAGG. If you ever sell your cue simply go to the SNAGG website and transfer ownership to the buyer.

A lot of your posts ask for drills suggestions and I feel like you'd get a lot from this book.   Also I second the suggestion for Tor Lowry's Zero-X ball pocketing drills. If you have the time to work through them, those exercises will sharpen up your understanding of shot angles and cue ball positioning with varying amounts of english.   Lastly someone was on the sub promoting their new version of target pool. Whilst a little on the pricey side, that will give you a solid course in cue ball control.   Edit: also look into some of Dominic Esposito's Drill Instructor DVDs. There's lots to be learned in there."

billiards,2rg9h9,hadronflux,2,Tue Jan 6 22:10:52 2015 UTC,"I like Tor Lowry's ""ball pocketing drills"" component of his video thing he's got.  He basically sets up increasing difficulty shots where you use english on 12 parts of the cue ball to get it to consistently end up in a particular location.  I know doing the drills have not only improved my control but they've taught me how the cue will come off of a ball+rail.  The downside (for those that don't like it) is it is in the zip code of ""hit a million balls"" approach."
billiards,2rg9h9,matchstickmaker,1 point,Tue Jan 6 04:24:55 2015 UTC,/u/Mr_Giblets posted a drill here that I have been using lately. It's a lot of fun and has been very helpful in my quest for cue ball control. That thread has some other good ideas too.
billiards,2rg9h9,gabrielleigh,1 point,Tue Jan 6 01:54:22 2015 UTC,"I can't say I have ever been a big fan of drills. I much prefer to focus my practice time on games which reinforce the particular skills that I am seeking to improve on.   For example, when I am struggling with cue ball control I prefer to play games that tend to ""force"" you to control the cueball. Rotation games such as 9 or 10 ball tend to emphasize cue ball control and really cost you when you lose that control during the game. One pocket is also fantastic for cue ball control, because such a huge focus of that game is reducing the chances of your opponent having good position. If I am missing balls, I like games like 8 ball, snooker, and straight pool that moves the primary focus to pocketing balls.   Anyhow, to each his own. I enjoy practice time much more when I play a game where my shots are more applicable to the areas I wish to improve."
billiards,2rg9h9,dalgeek,4,Mon Jan 5 23:42:16 2015 UTC,"Drills are necessary because they train your muscles. The only, only way to improve your muscle memory is through repetition. If you shoot the same shot ten times in a row then you can examine why you're missing it because the only variable is you. Drills first then practice."
billiards,2rg9h9,Bwtadpole,1 point,Tue Jan 6 02:04:57 2015 UTC,"The counterpoint being that if you're shooting one shot, you're gaining muscle memory for one shot. I'd argue that if you don't have a sense for detecting points of error, then drills may be the way to go. If you can detect errors, you may get more out of straight playing the game."
billiards,2rg9h9,unoriginalsin,6,Tue Jan 6 03:00:54 2015 UTC,"The counterpoint being that if you're shooting one shot, you're gaining muscle memory for one shot.   As far as your muscles are concerned, there are only a very small number of shots. Perhaps a dozen. Arguably far fewer.  Play is not practice. Not even Especially when it's non-competitive.  Which isn't to say that it has no value at all. It's great for starting to learn the game, but after a certain level of basic competency has been achieved you will not get better through idle casual play."
billiards,2rg9h9,Bwtadpole,1 point,Tue Jan 6 03:09:23 2015 UTC,"You're adding ""idle"" and ""casual"" to my idea of what playing the game is.  I don't disagree with you, but you're taking it to an extreme I didn't start at.  I agree that there are ""types"" of shots, but dalgeek's example had me envisioning someone shooting the same type of shot from the same distance out trying to get the same shape at the end.  That sort of practice, the kind I think he/she was talking about, is good for learning one specific shot, but if you can execute all of the different ""types"" of shots under the varying circumstances that come up in the course of a game, I'd say you have a good conceptual and mechanical understanding of the game."
billiards,2rg9h9,dalgeek,3,Tue Jan 6 06:26:02 2015 UTC,"Some drills do involve shooting the exact same shot over and over again.  If the cue ball and object ball are in the exact same position every time, and you miss the shot 30% of the time, then were does the issue lie?  Could be your aim, but that's not likely because if you hit 7 out of 10 then you obviously know where to aim.  That leaves your stroke.  I also do a drill where I semi-randomly throw a ball out on he table and shoot it from the foot spot and see how many I can make in a row.  If my stroke is in tune from the first drill and I'm missing the shots, then it's probably my aim that is off or I'm rushing my shots.  The whole point of drills is to make as much of the shooting process as automatic as possible so you don't have to spend time thinking about every little aspect of your shot every time you step up to the table."
billiards,2rg9h9,unoriginalsin,3,Tue Jan 6 08:38:12 2015 UTC,"You didn't start this thread, there is context here. I added those adjectives to enhance the contrast I was deliberately drawing between the difference between play and practice. I don't mean to demean idle casual play, but if it's not competitive play then it's not going to improve your shot making skill.  When you play games as /u/gabrielleigh suggested, you're only going to get to shoot those shots you have trouble with occasionally at best. When you actually practice with structured repetitive drills, preferably of a progressive nature, you can practice only the shots you have trouble with. The more time you spend practicing what you can almost do the sooner you will improve your ability. This has been demonstrated time and again to be true for all physical skills, and the fact is widely accepted across all other sporting communities.  OP asked specifically for drills to improve cue ball control. This is something that is important in every billiards game there is. But, if he wants to specifically improve his ability to control the cue ball, he needs to structure his practice to improve his shot making ability and cue ball control. The best way to do this is to repeatedly practice stun, draw and follow shots until he can confidently guarantee a specific result to an acceptable degree of accuracy. Then he can proceed to add left/right spin to travel around the table using the rails.  You do what you want. But, if you're choosing your practice method based on what you enjoy doing, then you're only cheating yourself out of time you could be spending actually becoming a better pool player and thus a great deal of enjoyment that comes with winning more games that actually matter (whether that's gambling, tournaments or league is up to you)."
billiards,2rg9h9,Bwtadpole,1 point,Tue Jan 6 15:48:11 2015 UTC,"You're right, I was more responding to /u/dalgeek than the OP. I understand both their/your argument and my own, and I think they both have merit if they're explained properly. I wanted to open the discussion up, and while I think it did open up, I got away from the point of the thread.  I think my simplified point is that muscle memory is necessary, yes, but you need that and the high-concept understanding of how to make adjustments for different shots to shoot well. If you shoot a shot with low-outside English from six inches out from the object ball, you don't engage your muscles the same way if the OB is instead eight feet away. Same type of shot, different muscle engagement.  But like I said, not the point of the thread. The archetypal cue ball control drill is the L-drill: https://angleofreflection.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/l-drill.png  From the shown position, shoot the 14 into the corner, playing shape for the one in the same corner without disturbing any other ball on the table. Make the one, playing position for the three, same corner and without touching the other balls. Typically, people play the first 3-6 shots going to the foot rail and coming back out towards the middle if the table, but it's alright if you need to draw your way back into alignment!"
billiards,2rg9h9,dalgeek,1 point,Tue Jan 6 16:16:49 2015 UTC,"Once you get the shot down without having to think about it then you can easily adapt the shot to multiple situations with less effort than if you had to figure out every shot on the fly.  The mechanics of shooting do not change very much unless you have an oddball shot where you're stuck to the rail or shooting over another ball (I do drills for those too).  The less you have to think about while you're at the table, the more you can concentrate on your game instead of the nitty gritty details of every single stroke."
billiards,2rg9h9,joshuarion,0,Tue Jan 6 08:29:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah but... Your muscles aren't used in aiming.    Once someone has an idea of how basic physics works they'll be able to immediately say 'ohhh, I hit that too thin...' or 'Ahhh, hit it too hard...""    It has nothing to do with 'muscle memory'.    I'm not suggesting drills aren't helpful, btw, I'm just saying that muscle memory isn't a part of aiming."
billiards,2rg9h9,dalgeek,1 point,Tue Jan 6 08:01:31 2015 UTC,"Aiming is important, but hitting where you aim is all about muscle memory.  Realizing that you hit it too thick or thin doesn't help unless you realize exactly why you did it.  Were your feet in the wrong place?  Did you drop your shoulder?  Turn your wrist?  Your brain and nerves are not fast enough to correct your movement mid-stroke, so you need to make sure your arm is heading in the right direction at the right speed without any conscious thought.  Ever make a shot and find yourself leaning or moving your cue to one side after the shot because you realize you screwed up?  That's your brain realizing you just did something wrong about 250ms after you did it, which is far too late."

If you're curious about any of those places or others in the area, feel free to drop me a PM as I've played in most of the spots around town a time or two. Good luck!"

The podcasts were typically done the day before the first game, and online users were able to ask the top level pro's questions.   You get everything from personal playing history, practice tips, funny stories from SVB, Reyes, Earl, Archer, Appleton, etc. The questions could literally be anything so theres a good bit of variance, and on the flipside if you watch all the SVB ones you hear a lot of repeat questions.

billiards,2r7nkq,UPVOTE_ATM,2,Sat Jan 3 16:30:15 2015 UTC,"I ran a twice weekly 8 ball tournament for 5 years locally in a small bar with 4 valleys. We would use three tables and usually get a field of 10 - 20 players. Most often we would finish in 2 & 1/2 hours. I don't love the tendency in the amature pool world of excluding better pool players from competition. My solution was a BCA double elimination with one game per match and a coin toss for the break. Its just enough luck to make it fun and short enough to keep most of the players there to watch the final matches. Its always a bummer when no one watches the final.   Edit: $10 entry fee, one dollar per game. The bar payed me to run it and all the entry went to the prize fund. I made a table of the pay outs by number of players and tried to pay as deep as possible. The table was posted so the players knew what was what with the pay out. Transparency is very important for something like this your clients (players) have to be able to trust the Tournament director."

The last bar tournament I regularly played in (8 ball) had some batshit-insane rules (like no safeties, and you had to call every rail the cue ball touched -- which included the ""extra"" rail on a long bank with the object ball already close to the pocket).      But moving past all that -- there was only 1 table.  If less than 6 people showed up it was double elimination.  6-12 it was single elimination. Somewhere around 14 people it switched to doubles (with a random parter match-up) and back to double elimination. It might have gone to single-elimination doubles after 18...  I can't remember.  RANDOM doubles generally scared people off.  And rightfully so."

It has sixteen nine foot tables(3 diamonds) all with blue Simonis 760 re-felted every four or five months.   The big tournament is the weekly Wednesday single elimination 9-ball tournament with standard international rules. Entry is $15, and there is a Calcutta player auction which adds another $300-$600 to the pot depending on the night. Most nights it's between 45-60 players, although the biggest nights are 75+ players. The tournament pays out $1000 to $2000 every week.   The tournament is handicapped were 1 game is given for every two ranks. A 7 in the APA is a 5 in the tournament. A low 9 in the APA is a 7 or 8. Highest rank to play in the tournament was a 16. There is also a huge 10-ball break and run raffle for $1000 a ball that is a big draw."

Every current location is 50 cent bar boxes, and each player contributes one quarter to drop the balls, usually.  We have one bar owner who will occasionally open the table and give us free matches.  Couple years ago, we had one location that had 75 cent boxes, and there was an agreement that the hosting business would provide the third quarter to drop the balls.  3 sessions per year - spring session starts in Jan and runs to May, Summer session May to Aug, Fall session Sept to Dec.

billiards,2r7nkq,warmcereal,1 point,Sun Jan 4 03:09:10 2015 UTC,"One place I know runs a very successful house league. 8 ball, meets weekly, 5-player teams, players are handicapped based on a ten point scale. I think you race to your handicap, i.e. a 7 plays a 5, the seven must win 7 racks, the other guy must win 5. I believe they skip all the stuff that some people find tedious about the largers leagues... stuff like having a scorekeeper who tracks number of balls left, or innings, or having special 'match points' based on whether it was close or not. You either won or you lost the set.  Not sure of the weekly fee... a flat ten bucks maybe? 100% of the money goes back to the players, at the end in a big playoff. It's pretty significant... some money goes to trophies but otherwise the LO (who owns the pool room) takes no money for himself, and I think the top 2 or 3 teams get paid.   No limit on who can be on a team, the theory is that the handicap takes care of a bunch of killer players stacking up into one team.   Handicap adjustment is done by the league operator and is apparently subjective, though I think he goes by win/loss records. That might bug some but I've never come across a league where someone didn't cry about handicaps or claim they were being manipulated. So it seems to work as well as any other system."

Since they are leagues, they know how many tables they need beforehand and just block them off. They are $10 get a cue league (low end McD) or $5 if you don't want the cue. All tables are the same for the league (and tourneys).  I have seen house tourneys have 1 or 2 extra tables for warmups for people playing in the next matches if there are not enough tables to run all the players at once. For example, say they 16 players (8 games), but only 6 tables available. 4 tables go to playing the the first set, the other 2 tables they allow those waiting players to hit a few balls on to stay warm.  I wouldn't necessarily say ""the bar runs it"". I mean, they have control over the league and the tourney, but more like they are hosting it than random employee #3 is running it today. Generally the same person runs them all. They could be an employee, but it is not part of their employee duties, IE, they won't go get orders or anything. They are only doing the tourney. Just as often, it is someone outside the hall that is doing it (with their permission of course)."

It's $10 entry with $1 of that going into a break and run pot that gets two names drawn for a shot at it each week. The owner let's me open the tables 30mins before the tourney starts for free practice. No quarters or anything. Normally get anywhere from 14-32(capped so it doesn't run too late) It's a race to 3 in winners and loser's bracket with guys that have won the tourney a few times going to a 4th game. If two ""4s"" play each other it stays a race to 3. We use NAPA rules for 8 ball and Texas Express for 9 ball. The owner adds $25 for 8-13 players, $50 for 14-23, and $100 for 24+. I try and always run a tourney that I'd enjoy playing in so it just winds up being a fun weekly tourney.  The break and run currently pays $200 to make it to the 3 ball, $500 to make it to the 6 and it's at $1400 for the whole rack. If you've played 2 of the last 4 weeks. otherwise you can get half."
billiards,2r7nkq,fadedcheese,1 point,Mon Jan 5 16:50:22 2015 UTC,Yes the tables should be opened. The idea is to get people into the bar with small perks like that Generally a tournament is weekly but the bar can host as many tournaments as they see fit In my experience the bar will designate a tournament director. That person may be paid in money or food or drinks. When I was doing it the bar was paying me $20 Starting a weekly tournament is going to be a lot easier than setting up a league. If you have enough people interested in a league call your local APA office. They likely have a division you can join.

Each bar has 8 players (4 teams of 2) and we play 4 rounds first team to 9 wins.

Now when you are against the rail or shooting over an object ball there's no way to see down table at the ball you're shooting at. Instead the cue stick automatically jacks up and leaves you staring straight down into the cloth.  tldr: virtual pool online went from my favorite all time app/game to something that clutters up my phone's home screen in the blink of a single update."

Novuss is a national sport in Latvia. The board is approximately 100 centimetres (39 in) square, typically made of wood, has pockets in each corner, and lines marked on the surface. The board is usually placed on a stand, but may be placed on a barrel or other surface that allows the pockets to hang down properly. It uses small discs instead of balls, and each player has their own small puck instead of the cue ball used in other cue sports. Players use a small cue stick to propel their pucks into their colored object discs (the novuss equivalent of object balls), knocking them into the pockets. The winner is the first one to sink all eight of their object discs (of which there are sixteen in total in two different-coloured sets, plus the two pucks).

billiards,2qykqu,Bronco5150,5,Wed Dec 31 22:42:49 2014 UTC,"It depends on the rules you are playing. VNEA regardless of playing the eight, as long as the eight is still on the table it is not a loss."
billiards,2qykqu,y_the_mind_fuck,1 point,Wed Dec 31 23:01:29 2014 UTC,"Regardless of what rules, the possibility not even drawn out could leave the op snookered and not have an easy out. Funny how it changes terms rather quickly contingent on what the rules are. Sounds like the both parts are playing undefined rules."
billiards,2qykqu,Texaskid89,3,Thu Jan 1 07:59:46 2015 UTC,"In APA if it's your turn to shoot on the 8 ball, and the cue ball goes into a pocket, it's a scratch on the 8 (a loss) regardless of whether you were trying to pocket the 8 (or even hit it) or not.  Note that also in APA a ""table foul"" (Hitting a ball out of turn or not pushing a ball to a rail) isn't a loss of game even on the 8 ball, it's only a scratch (the cue ball goes into a pocket or off the table) or pushing the 8 ball into the wrong pocket that results in loss of game."
billiards,2qykqu,Stiegurt,1 point,Wed Dec 31 23:08:48 2014 UTC,"This is correct. Otherwise someone could just keep saying ""I'm not shooting the 8"" while they foul all night. If your next legal ball is the 8 and you scratch then you lose in APA. In BCA your opponent would get ball in hand unless you sink the 8 and foul, in which case you lose."
billiards,2qykqu,dalgeek,1 point,Thu Jan 1 07:01:03 2015 UTC,"To my understanding, the only ""foul on the eight ball"" is a result of pocketing the eight ball and scratching the cue ball. It's like giving your opponent ball in hand (or kitchen) and resulting in a win due to the absence of the eight ball."
billiards,2qykqu,Ian_is_cool,3,Wed Dec 31 23:13:12 2014 UTC,"Depends on the rules you're playing. BCA; what you describe is correct. VNEA; what you describe is correct. APA; pocketing the cue ball while on the 8 results in a loss for the shooter. Bar Rules; depends on your bar/region, but generally pocketing the cue ball while on the 8 results in a loss for the shooter..."
billiards,2qykqu,joshuarion,0,Wed Dec 31 23:19:50 2014 UTC,Pocketing the cue ball while on the eight is a loss in BCA.   http://bca-pool.com/associations/7744/files/EightBall_January2008.pdf
billiards,2qykqu,Pilfered,3,Fri Jan 2 08:21:22 2015 UTC,Section 3.8: The shooter loses if he fouls when pocketing the eight ball   This would be a loss only if the 8 ball was pocketed. Otherwise it is not a loss and the opponent gets ball in hand.  It's written in a clearer way in the updated set of rules for BCAPL. Section 2-10.
billiards,2qykqu,petermgates,1 point,Fri Jan 2 14:04:20 2015 UTC,A foul on the 8 ball is not a loss unless the 8 ball goes in. The ball that flew off the table is counted as pocketed and you have ball in hand.
billiards,2qykqu,gotwired,1 point,Thu Jan 1 15:11:27 2015 UTC,"If the 8 ball is still on the table the game is not over.  Per BCA, BCAPL, VNEA, WPA, ACS, and other rule sets.  These are also the rules used in all the highest level professional tournaments.  Again, if the 8 ball is on the table the game is not over and fouls are punished with ball in hand anywhere on the table for the incoming player."
billiards,2qykqu,wheelsno3,0,Fri Jan 2 18:49:54 2015 UTC,"If it's APA rules then it's a foul, you win.  Edit: [removed BCA]"
billiards,2qykqu,Humidity275,1 point,Thu Jan 1 01:26:05 2015 UTC,Bca the opponent gets ball in hand. The eight must leave the table for the game to be over.

billiards,2qw06q,HappySoda,5,Wed Dec 31 04:29:28 2014 UTC,"I like long bridges for high power shots, medium bridges for medium power shots and short bridges for low power shots."
billiards,2qw06q,petermgates,1 point,Wed Dec 31 05:15:59 2014 UTC,I have a line for my bridge hand (permanent marker) 10 inches. At my address position my bridge it at the line. And I also have a groove in my cues butt end where my pinky finger rests. These distances assure that my stroke is consistent.
billiards,2qw06q,RoadHustler,1 point,Wed Dec 31 16:40:34 2014 UTC,Wow... That's hard core! Do you feel it improved your game?
billiards,2qw06q,RoadHustler,2,Wed Dec 31 19:35:18 2014 UTC,"Yea it not only improved my game but it helps me to minimise slumps.  *If my practice gets lazy and I start missing things I shouldn't I can go back to basics and fix it. *I believe that when pocketing any ball except for masses, kicks and banks its just a straight line between the current cue ball location and the location the cue ball needs to occupy to knock the object ball into the pocket if you can set your cue on the line that it needs to travel to send the cue ball to the desired location with the necessary speed and spin for subsequent position play then its just a matter of moving the cue in a straight line.  *Most shots were missed before the players hand ever touched the table due to poor fundamentals. I endeavor to minimise mistakes in my set up and delivery with consistency and routine as much as possible.  *Pocketing the ball and getting position is the result of what came before it. A effective and consistent pre shot routine is the recipe for consistently successful shots. A successful shot can happen without a effective consistent pre shot but it doesn't have to happen every time and probably won't.  *So when I practice I practice what happens before I strike the cue ball and look at what the balls do as a report card on what happened before hand. As I take a shot my mind observes the act. Then I record and evaluate the results. It is important that you do this dispassionately your inner monologue will get in the way of effective practice if you let it. Use your smartphone to record your practice and watch the video especially the missed shots they will teach you a ton about what you are doing wrong. Once you are familiar with what you are doing in general you will get a feel for what you are doing wrong when you do something wrong.  *Consistent form will make it obvious when you deviate from this form."
billiards,2qw06q,Texaskid89,1 point,Wed Dec 31 20:33:31 2014 UTC,"I too have a bridge point but its contingent on my cue as each have a different balance point. I'll tell you a secret, I put a rubberband to stick my muscle memory at practice."
billiards,2qw06q,PulseAmplification,1 point,Thu Jan 1 08:06:21 2015 UTC,"Some people can play very good by changing up their bridge length often for all the varying types of shots, and other people can play very good by keeping the same bridge length, but changing the length of their backstroke. There are a few exceptions when a very short bridge is required, or at least helps you accomplish the shot better, e.g. when the cue ball and object ball are really close together, kill shots, or some shots in general that require an extremely fine touch.   I am one of the players that keeps the same stroke length (about 10 inches I think) and changes the backstroke depending on the shot. For me, it just feels more natural.   My problem with constantly changing your bridge length, you are changing where you hold the cue as well to keep your arm at 90 degrees when your tip is at the cue ball. This causes you to get used to constantly changing the feel of the cue, since the balance point of the cue is constantly being changed. I tried this for a while and just couldn't get used to it, so I went with the common method of just changing your backstroke for almost all of the varying shots."
billiards,2qw06q,dalgeek,1 point,Sun Jan 4 03:50:17 2015 UTC,"Depends on the shot.  If the joint of my cue is sliding over my bridge, I know it's too long and I need to break out the rake."
billiards,2qvo64,Koyoteelaughter,1 point,Wed Dec 31 02:33:39 2014 UTC,Honestly whats the market value  of slate? Secondly if it where Brazilian vs. Macon Georgian slate there would be an optional difference as ones American and the other foreign. It is a very cool concept on making a personal/ custom table. Might try a wood traders forum if you plan a diy table.
billiards,2qvo64,Texaskid89,2,Thu Jan 1 08:03:36 2015 UTC,"With shipping, one set of slate would realistically cost you between $600 and $800 depending on how far. If you're local and picked it up yourself, it'd cost you around $400.  We'll take $200 a set locally. The slate came in with a batch of tables over the years. The tables had all been pieced out to replace parts on some of the damaged ones. We ended up having all the slate to those tables left over.  My buddy aka my boss has had these two bundles of slate stacked in the corner of his warehouse ever since. He isn't trying to get market value from it. He just wants them gone. He sells kitchen cabinets now and needs the room for cabinet storage. When the tables were ordered in originally, they were advertised with Italian slate. Before that batch of tables, the slate came from China. So, there's a mix of Italian slate in there and Chinese slate. I hope that's helpful."

billiards,2qup36,theamazinchad,2,Tue Dec 30 21:32:16 2014 UTC,I've only played in 2 tournaments and both were at my university campus (which is huge). Got knocked out first match in the 8 ball tournament (to the eventual champion). I felt pretty bad and then went all serious for the 9 ball tournament. Both tournaments had around 35 people. First place was 50 bucks which was neat I guess. I realise I'm just a kid compared to everyone else here but I really liked the experience because you get to see really good players scan and run the table and more than taking it like a serious competition it's a great opportunity to observe good players in action (unless there's a lot at stake!)
billiards,2qup36,aunlakhani,2,Tue Dec 30 23:04:12 2014 UTC,"This sounds like a great weekly event, is it 8ball or 9-ball? For 15 bucks I would play every week.

He gets to break and try to run a 10ball rack, for 1k a ball? Where does all that money come from?"

I got knocked out by Antonio Lining who went on to get 3rd, I believe.  I also played in the Reno Open when I was starting out. I think I won 2 matches, which wasn't a bad finish for my skill level at the time.  Competing in larger tournaments is the only real way to gain experience in playing larger tournaments. You can dick around in house and local tournaments as much as you like, but the only way to really test your mettle is to put yourself into a bigger pond."
billiards,2qup36,phigga,1 point,Thu Jan 1 09:45:07 2015 UTC,So what is the level of competition at tournaments like that? How many racks can players at the Reno or Japan Open run in practice and in competition (I'm guessing many are alternating break). Also how much did you practice to prepare to play in these events?  I've heard that one of the most difficult aspects of playing abroad is the food. Do you like sushi?
billiards,2qup36,phigga,1 point,Mon Jan 5 14:41:49 2015 UTC,"The Japan Open generally has multiple former world champions playing as well as a plethora of other less well known pros.   The Reno Open also had a similar level of competition, although it is not held any more.   As far as how many racks they can run, I have run 6 in practice and 5 in tournaments and I am not anywhere near the top of the heap. I would guess guys like Efren Reyes have run 12 or so.   When I was playing in these tournaments, I was playing every day for 4 hours or more a day, but I did that for a few years, so I couldn't really say it was specifically preparation, just my normal routine.  Food is a difficult aspect if you are a picky eater and aren't willing to eat anything other than steak with A1 and baked potatoes, but most people love the food in Japan. Tokyo is the gourmet capital of the world.  I frickin love sushi, but can't always afford to have good sushi. lol"

The one I worked on had an extremely heavy cast ball that was used as the hand grip for the cane. You unscrewed that part and the shaft was attached to the underside of the hand grip. Then you had to unscrew the shaft from the grip, take a protective bumper off the other end of the butt to expose the real joint pin, then screw the cue together. It was really awkwardly weighted and I can't say I liked the feel of it. It was pretty neat to look at though."
