PuzzleAndDragons,3e1sl6,dominicanscholar,40,Tue Jul 21 08:24:02 2015 UTC,Then the NA servers would die overnight.
PuzzleAndDragons,3e1sl6,nerogenesis,6,Tue Jul 21 09:03:47 2015 UTC,The only downside is following the JP schedule. I can hardly do most of the timed events because i'm asleep when I play on the JP server.

PuzzleAndDragons,3e1sl6,Chocobean,0,Tue Jul 21 14:04:46 2015 UTC,"No, that only since EU countries have several languages, unlike JP/NA which are one language."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e1sl6,blvcksvn,4,Tue Jul 21 08:49:18 2015 UTC,Canada is not one language. I assume we should count Mexico as well as part of NA.
PuzzleAndDragons,3e1sl6,pingpong_playa,7,Tue Jul 21 13:37:19 2015 UTC,Canada is primarily English. Quebecois constitute very  little of the NA playerbase.
PuzzleAndDragons,3e1sl6,blvcksvn,7,Tue Jul 21 13:46:12 2015 UTC,"not sure about the downvotes, it's true that only about 12% of canadians speak french by default, and i believe only 4% only speak french. It's not nearly as bicultural as some think."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e1sl6,DimmiDongus,5,Tue Jul 21 15:05:58 2015 UTC,Doesnt change the fact that mexico is in north america though.

PuzzleAndDragons,3e1sl6,Rexcalibur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:14:37 2015 UTC,What rank are you at? How come you didn't get any of those all this time? :p  I hope they have a free jewel event soon and that a phoenix pops out for you form PEM. Still have to get theurgia yourself though.
PuzzleAndDragons,3e1sl6,Chocobean,2,Tue Jul 21 14:07:00 2015 UTC,"It's not a rank problem. I've just failed to get Phoenix drops running Noah and Zeus Vulcan, gotten the blue and 2 green Grimoires instead of Theurgia, and used up my Fire Jewels on A.Horus and Goemon."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e1sl6,Rexcalibur,3,Tue Jul 21 14:11:19 2015 UTC,"That's rough :< well, Horus will help you get it all back next time. Zeus Vulcan mythical had the best rates for phoenix I think....I had three invades in like 5 tries."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e1sl6,Chocobean,4,Tue Jul 21 14:15:35 2015 UTC,"While you're right that Zeus Vulcan is the best place to get phoenix, it's not an invade since it always spawns on F4 and the drop rate is probably somewhere around 10-20%, you were extremely lucky to get 3 in 5 runs."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e1sl6,jx9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:53 2015 UTC,Oh you're totally right it wasn't an invade.  Oh man I was so lucky!! It dropped twice in my first two runs I just assumed it was darn frequent. I probably just died without making it to floor 4 those other times. I am glad I decided to stone for the last phoenix drop then. :/ man that's rough.

PuzzleAndDragons,3e1sl6,Chirei,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:35:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, but in the past we should always get around 1 days notice about an incoming update.

PuzzleAndDragons,3e1sl6,funkyfool999,2,Tue Jul 21 18:11:20 2015 UTC,Damn 4 people said to feed before but now I am not sure again. I think I will just evo now since I am impatient and awoken meimei will be useful unless the skill up change comes quickly.
PuzzleAndDragons,3e1sl6,Rifful,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:49:08 2015 UTC,"If my understanding is correct, you should try to awake evo BEFORE the skill change happens to the jewels.  The chance to get skill ups is calculated PRE-fusion, but awarded post-fusion.  So what matters is if the skills match before you evolve, not after.  Weird, but true.  This is how some lucky people were able to max skill their pentad dragons, just through the evo-fusion process.

PuzzleAndDragons,3e2ci5,nico2929,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:30:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you, will try it. As you can see I kinda forgot I had Nephtys and Goetia, and from what I've seen when it comes to Orb Enhance they buff damage considerably. As for Curse Wyrm - unfortunately its on 15 sec CD (no skill ups), so I think in this case green golem would be better for GLZ (in-colour, same CD). Plus it has no auto-recovery. I did a HUGE mistake by fusing Queen Bee (1313) instead of farming collab a little longer and skilling her up, as it is low CD 50% damage reduction - would be perfect for 1st stages. O well, live and learn."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e2ci5,InfinityMechanism,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:11:00 2015 UTC,"+1 for a Nephthys team.  While you don't have her absolute best subs, you should be able to make a serviceable team for KotG and a bunch of descends with the cards that you have.    In addition to the subs Nico suggested, you can also consider Vampire (the D/B uevo), Hanzo, Dill Sirius, chibi pandora, CDD, and Echidna.    I'd recommend using Vampire, Gryps, Hanzo, and Goetia primarily, but your sub choices will vary to counter specific descends.  Once your monsters are leveled more, you can run KotG if you sub in Echidna to delay Zeus.  One thing to keep in mind is that you do not need to cover every color.  Just make sure that you won't prevent yourself from activating your leader skill with your orb changers if you are using less colors.    Work on leveling and awakening your main team and skilling up your orb changers.    If you are looking for Nephthys friends, feel free to send me a friend invite.  I have a +297 Neph up almost all the time.  Also feel free to message me if you have any questions."

You can also put together your Ra and work towards Awoken Ra and just letting your orb matching carry you through the game.  Considering you have Avalon Drake and G/L Meimei, if you manage to clear Athena, Ulti her and use her green version team!"
PuzzleAndDragons,3e2ci5,Jph1181,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I actually started skilling up/awakening Tyrannos (started farming legendary sky dragons for upgrades) but still lacking red dragon fruit. Will see if any other proposed teams can actually tackle that dungeon. And yes, thats the reason i have sphinx and i farmed thoth + sopdet legendary (unfortunately after 8-9 runs i got only thoth drop once)."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e2ci5,Cielbunneh,2,Tue Jul 21 16:13:51 2015 UTC,"Excluding Nephthys, I have all of the cards that you mentioned & from looking at your herder, I think that your best bet would be a Nephthys team. Gryps & Lumiel are the 2 main subs. The final 2 would be Goetia and for now Vampire can work as the last spot. If you need some utility or other skill for a dungeon, Vampire is out, but your other 3 subs will still have all colors covered so you can activate Nephtyhys LS. As someone who uses Verdandi, the hp boost is extremely helpful in descends and rushes. You'll have that + a rcv boost for your dark cards with Nephthys. Throw in the fact that its very easy to activate her LS by merely matching any 3 of the 6 orb types on the board, I think that the sky is the limit for yours or any Nephthys team. Also I'll explain why I don't recommend the other teams you mentioned. GZL is strong, but maintaining his hp is a headache & without high hp cards like golems, GZL teams have poor hp. Even with a shield like Kushi, 1 ill-timed skyfall and its game over. I hypermaxed one of my GZL's, but he is strictly a sub. Urd is easy to use, but there aren't many good R/B subs. I have Hino, Red Valk and others, but my hypermax Urd has slipped from main leader down to Thursday mythical leader and top tier sub for my Awoken Shiva team once he arrives in NA. Satan is basically a farming lead. He works for easy descends, KotG and some biweeklies, but anything else will probably be a struggle due to the -9999 rcv. Andromeda like all hero teams are very REM dependent. L/L Ra, keep practicing in endless corridors if you want to get better with him. That's the only way he will be worth it. Sarasvati falls in to the Andromeda/hero category of being REM dependent. G/G Meimei, as a leader if it isn't a dungeon that has lots of G/L/D enemies, I'm not sure how much better she will be than your other options."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e2ci5,Cielbunneh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:42:22 2015 UTC,"Whoah, thank you for the long and detailed explanation! As per 2 other comments will try Neph team then, need to do some levelling first but should be manageable soon(ish).  I do know already the pains of GZL and skyfalls (5x column :/) that can destroy whole plan. On the other hand some dungeons/descends (Hera-is) just beg for green TPA treatment. Anyhow this is the main reason why I need some new teams :)  When it comes to G/G meimei i was thinking about using her as sub most of the time for GZL and as leader paired with another meimei (or maybe verdandi) for dungeons where i do need more survivalability with a punch behind it. Will see though, as G/G meimei is still a bit farther away than I hoped."

PuzzleAndDragons,3e2r81,veeeSix,2,Tue Jul 21 14:44:47 2015 UTC,D/L is the definitely the way to go if you are new to using Anubis. Awoken Anubis has more potential but is harder to use and is for more experienced users. You aren't losing out on much by using D/L anyways since he still can reach 100x atk.  For a team I suggest D/L Anubis/DKali/Yomi/Pandora/Zuoh/friend D/L Anubis but with Anubis teams the subs aren't always important. Just make sure you have enough time extends and it also may be worth getting Diza for the nice damage reduction.

PuzzleAndDragons,3e2r81,lightning2k3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:12:46 2015 UTC,"To get more than 10 combos, you have to rely on skyfalls. There's only 30 orbs on the board, which is only enough for 10 combos even if you match everything in sets of 3, and that's not possible on most boards.  Now, skyfalls aren't uncommon when you're clearing most of the board, and you can set things up so that skyfall orbs are more likely to form combos with the orbs you're leaving up, but it's still not 100% reliable."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e2r81,LordFlufffy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:26:50 2015 UTC,Yeah I was thinking about the board last night and how much of it you'd need to manipulate in order to make 10 combos with skyfall. Insane!

Also Sopdet is auto-loss as well, there's no way you can do less than 200k if you activate LS bonus, if you don't you can't do enough damage.  You also have to not fail on the floors leading up to there.  Definitely sub 20% success rate, maybe even sub 10%."

If you do make A.Bastet, you could use her as a Horus sub just for the time extends.  I still prefer your A.Horus team over the LKali team since Horus' leader skill is so reliable (any 4 colors!) and since the multiplier gets so high when you use an active skill.  I'd actually look to fit Echidna in (could take Shiva's spot) when bosses don't have preemptive status shields.  Shiva and Bastet should both crush tricolors, so I wouldn't really sweat the decision.  If you need another Horus/Bastet friend, I main A.Horus (2 flampys from hypermax) and A.Bastet, with A.Ra/Athena/Haku/etc in the best friend slot.  313,033,370"

PuzzleAndDragons,3e3mkz,Sunjuan,2,Tue Jul 21 19:01:16 2015 UTC,"I vote Bastcat. Osiris, Verdandi, Sasuke, and Wee Jas are great subs in my opinion. Osiris and Sasuke give you orbs fast. Wee Jas has healing, bind clear, delay, and time extends. Verdandi provides a board wipe with heal   7 time extends from the whole team, complete poison resistance after Sasuke's buff, 5 skill boosts so that Osiris and Sasuke will be ready turn one, 6 enhanced green orb awakenings for a damage boost equivalent to an extra TPA across the team.  After looking into awakenings and figuring all of this out, I'm mad jealous of your potential bastet team, even if there's no triple TPA card. The only thing is I think it's only 60% skill bind resistant. Either way, looks pretty beast. I think your damage will be fine, and consistent."

I am going all in with Awoken Shiva. Awoken Horus is an excellent leader because he's so easy to use, but Awoken Shiva with his rcv multiplier and being a combo leader, not color like Horus gives him the edge in my opinion. Valk is your best choice for green if you roll with Horus. Ultimately, I feel that you will be better with a sub-optimal Shiva team than your potential Awoken Horus team."

Either people just look up the time on a resource, or just get lucky checking the app. I get that they want to spread out server power, but why not just make the dungeon available to a user for 1 hour after they enter the dungeon? That keeps the dungeon limited to an hour a day and users don't have to make themselves available at (sometimes) impossible hours to participate."

So you would press the group for Emerald Dragons, for example, and see both Super Emeralds and the regular emerald dungeons in the sub dungeons. This is just like how it is for daily dungeons or for descends with 2 difficulties. This also means that you get a stone for beating each one again (2 for each color for a total of 10 stones)  Edit: Most of the stamina costs shouldn't change, but IIRC Super Metals got reduced to 45 stamina.

PuzzleAndDragons,3e14i8,SolarJoker,2,Tue Jul 21 04:08:24 2015 UTC,That's because the Descend is specifically called Sha Wujing&Zhu Bajie descended. It's similar to Izanami Descended and Xuanzang Descended

If we value each roll on average to be worth ~5000 points (during godfests, REM is majority gold now and the occasional GFE to skew the data upward), that's 1 stone per 1000 points to pull the gold dragon. Or worth over 1000 stamina by doing descends this way.  I think until we see how they implement the MP dragons, suffice to say there's no other method that makes grinding for MP worth it. Even if you're desperate, might as well just roll the REM and sell what you roll."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e14i8,astalotte,2,Tue Jul 21 07:48:10 2015 UTC,I still maintain that you shouldn't deliberately farm or roll the REM for MP.

Not farming for late bloomers on NA, not descend carnivals, not 2-boss descends, etc. Gungho clearly made sure nothing farmable is remotely useful for their MP store.

The poison has only helped in maybe one out of a hundred runs now, where it took out the 9th floor dragon with no red orbs available.

PuzzleAndDragons,3e0tsa,FlamingArcher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:53:05 2015 UTC,"do you not use any in your teams?   Slimes, and their similar god versions (GZL/SunQuan/Nim/Muse etc) supplement a lack of burst damage that some leads have issues with.  Urd's multiplier is only 10.89 at full-ish health.   this is generally not enough to 1 shot massive healt monsters, such as Zeus, which have 5.3 million life.  You'd be extremely dependent on insane skyfalls to boost your damage up high enough even with a well developed team.    that 10.89 becomes 32.7~ times multiplier, making an Urd/Cao cao board able to do insane damage when setup correctly.   I'm honestly surprised if you dont run an enhancer of some sort.  The only team that hasn't had some varient of an enhancer is my awoken bastet team, but that's because her leader skill has a damage enhance built in."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e2sxm,kieran_dvarr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:04 2015 UTC,"Currently I'm planning to take in the following:  Lubu (max), king baddie (max), hera (max), hadar (33 for the orb enhance), extant Sonia (17), and a browns hypermax rsonia.  Usually I tend to use vamp and cdd instead of my Sonia and hadar but thought this may work better against gold (hera, Sonia, hadar then my).  Any advice is appreciated and I added my padherder too though it's a week out of date."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e2sxm,SBelmont,2,Tue Jul 21 15:03:43 2015 UTC,"You should be fine as long as you are able to heal back up on each Keeper. Personally I think Vamp or CDD may be a better sub than Hadar, as you can pop Vamp/CDD (Vamp after healing the turn before) to help burst a keeper and more stats if they're higher leveled. With Gravity and type advantage on Gold Keeper, along with 2.5x or 3x on top of Ronia board you should have no issue breaking Gold Keeper in one shot after Dark Absorb wears off."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e2sxm,djewell314,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:17:50 2015 UTC,Alright thanks. I'll take another look at the possibilities of changing hadar out.  Might make some difference... Name/lvl/hp/atk Hadar 33/2412/1074 vamp 49/2443/1230 CDD 84/2755/1513  Actually with the 7.5x atk that would make a base difference of 3292 each turn. With the other multipliers that could well be significant.
PuzzleAndDragons,3e2sxm,Sunjuan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:28:10 2015 UTC,I've never tried it with a ronia but the main problem I see it the turns of dark absorb at the beginning. I assume the boost from lu bu and baddie can make up for it though. As long as you don't have a brain fart and use your burst when the absorb is on and don't use lu bu right before he punches I don't see any problems though.
PuzzleAndDragons,3e2sxm,Jethompson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:08:33 2015 UTC,Ya. I'll have to wait for the dark absorb to end but I think the enhance will make it enough to get through after hera.  Either way im going to try in about 3.5 hours. But I'm still uncertain.  I know I'll have to stall early and take out light and dark quickly. The second ronia is actually to eliminate dark.
PuzzleAndDragons,3e2sxm,SBelmont,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:12:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think you'll be fine. I have a friend who farms this with devils I believe. A side note though, you should definitely clean up your herder and add more teams to your teams list. It was a nightmare to scroll through."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e2sxm,SBelmont,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:14:19 2015 UTC,Thanks I'll see how it goes then.  And Sorry about the mess. I'll try to get the teams in a better order.  Not sure how much cleanup I can do though. 800+ cards and growing.
PuzzleAndDragons,3e2sxm,djewell314,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:26:59 2015 UTC,Double check on Hadar before you run today. He is losing his devil typing once we get 8.1 and becoming machine type instead :(  Do you need both LuBu and Baddie? One good burst should kill it. You might want to get some bigger stats in there in place of baddie.
PuzzleAndDragons,3e2sxm,djewell314,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:29:41 2015 UTC,He's losing his devil type? That stinks. I was planning to make him a main part of the devil team once he was maxed. He just didn't have priority yet. Oh well.  I think you may be right about losing baddie. I'll only gain about 300 base atk but with all the multipliers that could be sufficient to make a difference.  But then I will need to watch the dark keeper more.  Thanks.

PuzzleAndDragons,3e2o21,Commiesalami,3,Tue Jul 21 14:19:29 2015 UTC,"Rarity only affects appearance rate of mobs on random floors. Since Rodin Tama only appears on F6 which is always fixed (red dub, blue dub, rodin tama), him being 6 stars does not affect his drop rate at all.  For any single floor, every monster that ends up appearing on that floor has the same chance to drop. This is true for every dungeon in the game, no exceptions.  If F6 has a 100% drop rate even without the 1.5x drop bonus (and I'm not sure about this, but according to the other comment it does), then 1.5x drop bonus has no impact on Rodin Tama's drop rate. It will always have exactly a 1/3 chance of dropping on that floor."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e2o21,jx9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:18:19 2015 UTC,"There's 100% drop from that floor, I believe, so roughly a 1/3 chance of getting the Rodin tama drop. I don't know what the actual drop rates are, but for some reason when I was Seaway farming I almost always got Rodin tama drops. Probably because I don't actually have a Rodin, so gungtroll was trying to rub it in my face.   Edit: by 100% I meant that you're guaranteed a drop from one of the three spawns, like how Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday legend/mythicals guarantee you one of the two/three drops on the boss floor. The 1.5x rates on Seaway increase the rates for drops on floors 1-5, but for floors 6 and 7 you'll always get a drop from something."

When all comes to worse I line up water prongs and pray. Rodin tama floor requires activation and 1 tpa, water type advantage too good. Delay not needed but I like to be safe. Boss floor is pretty easy, I don't always need Durga's burst. Team doesn't have a lot of HP though, so if I can't kill synced mobs I die, and I can only tank 1 hit from 1 mob the whole dungeon, 1 rodin tama hit, or 2-3 from Wangren (he usually dies before he can do anything though)"

Pack a Lilith for floor 6, Ronia-LB-Beelz for 7 and a quick changer to round out the team (Persephone/Haku/Vamp in that order IMO).  I've definitely gotten trolled a few times (triple 1-timers kill runs) and losing 88 stam hurts.

PuzzleAndDragons,3e06n8,JayJx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:01:43 2015 UTC,DValk was indisputably better until the branch evos for Greco Gods were announced.  Pretty sure now it's just:   Would you rather have a faster and smaller orb changer? Would you like an active that can standalone but is slower?
PuzzleAndDragons,3e06n8,JayJx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:29:12 2015 UTC,I was tempted (still am) to max Persephone but I think Dvalk remains the better choice in that she adds double TPA flexibility to dark teams that are mostly row based.  Valk and Persephone weighted stats are close but when you want to add a card for double TPA to pierce defenses you prefer the ATK of Valk to to HP of Pers.
PuzzleAndDragons,3e06n8,iNViSiBiLiTi,3,Tue Jul 21 03:01:59 2015 UTC,"Wait.  Persephone has double row and double tpa now, iirc."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e06n8,White_Dynamite22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:24:12 2015 UTC,"she does but she has lower base ATK than DValk so the potential max damage remains lower.  The only reason to add TPA cards to a row team would be to hit a higher single card max damage for breaking defense on something like a fat metal dragon, so Dvalk is still better I think.  Unless the math from the double rows of Persephone brings the rest of the cards on the team higher."

That team hypermaxed bursts for around 7.5 million hypermaxed with a normal 20/10 board though with Loki though, so Batman is just overkill a lot of the time."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e18sp,spamfinity,2,Tue Jul 21 05:41:03 2015 UTC,"On one of the JP tier list sites, where they give template teams and ideal teams, one of the ""ideal"" teams for general purpose dungeons was Beelzebub/CDD/Haku/Pandora/LuBu/Ronia  I see some people saying Hanzo but the problem with him is that he works against you. Hanzo is converting red orbs which means he is taking away from your damage. CDD + Haku gives you a mostly dark board with a little red and is optimal."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e18sp,QnA,2,Tue Jul 21 08:06:19 2015 UTC,"I will agree with others that Lu Bu is only really necessary when you don't have the stats to tank and spank through bosses.

I think this is a team that has ideal subs, but no ideal team as it is very flexible and dungeon-dependent.  I personally like the pandora/raoh combo as it results in a 1/3 dark, 1/2 fire, and 1/6 water board on a 8 turn cd, they also come with 3 dark rows, 2 fire rows, 3 skill boosts, and 1 skill bind resist. Protects you from jammer/poison orbs too.  I try to make my team hybrid F/D so bad ronia boards can't let me down. I don't know if it does more or less damage than monocolor but ronia team does more than enough damage for bosses."

Is it as good as the optimal dark teams? Probably not, but it does provide a guaranteed safe, extremely high damage all-enhanced-fire board to protect you from orb troll, and it has 6 fire row enhances so the damage isn't bad.  tl;dr If anyone is unlucky with dark Devils, you can still make a decent fire Devil team too!"
PuzzleAndDragons,3e18sp,nishikihebi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:11:28 2015 UTC,Grizal is pretty good. I'd prefer him over Hanzo.
PuzzleAndDragons,3e18sp,blvcksvn,-1,Tue Jul 21 04:35:34 2015 UTC,"Zuo/Pandora/Pandora/Loki  Zuo + Pandora is superior to Haku + Hanzo. You lose some attack but gain a lot of HP.  Loki just losses some attack and a skill boost compared to Lu Bu while gaining some, IIRC, some HP and a lot of RCV. Lu Bu's skill is over-kill, with Zuo + Pandora + Loki and if you want Beelzebub you can easily very easily one-shot anything.  Another good choice is Batman instead of Loki but honestly 2x isn't necessary at all, Loki has slightly better awakenings, CD is a lot lower (8 turns) and now comes packed with a haste so you can actually make your burst load faster or use him just to pop some Pandora if you need to and she is 1 turn away.  Some people will tell you about Persephone and other subs, just go for the team I named. We're talking a team that can burst once or twice in a row, not more, you need to be able to stall which is what this team gives you, extremely high HP and very good RCV while making your burst great. Also running a tri-color board changer without an extra orb changer to make it 2/3 dark is idiotic, Haku without Hanzo is crap, so is Zuo without Pandora."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e18sp,iLambdadelta,2,Tue Jul 21 07:47:43 2015 UTC,"Haku without hanzo is still good for both the active but mainly the awakenings. Pandora is also good by herself for both active and awakenings even without Z, if heartbreaker is needed gravis/vamp are usually thrown in. To make such a opinionated statement while calling others idiotic is pretty damn idiotic lol."

Your ability to clear descends largely depends on what monsters you have You are by no means the slowest or fastest in terms of rank to days played ratio. (If you want to increase your rank, certain dungeons have higher rank exp to stamina ratios that let you level up fairly quickly, but of course your ability to clear these dungeons are also somewhat limited by box synergy) Another thing that determines your rank is how much you play. You can grind out the first 100 ranks pretty much without stopping over a weekend which is what I did because I have no friends, no plans, and no life. Does that mean that I can judge you if you have plans and don't want to grind 3 stamina dungeons on your weekend for ranks? Let's just say that if you don't judge me, I won't judge you. As long as you're playing and enjoying yourself who gives a flying f-bomb if you're advancing quickly or slowly. If you think you want to advance more quickly (or more slowly) this sub is a great place to get advice on what you should do to advance and stuff."

PuzzleAndDragons,3e04qp,EthanAlways,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:59:55 2015 UTC,People go at different rates. Your level can differ by a huge amount from someone with the same day count depending on how rigorously you spent your stamina on rank ups instead of fun stuff like collabs or descends.   The descend thing means you might just be building or playing a team wrong. Post your box/padherder in this thread or a new thread and someone will be happy to take a look.
PuzzleAndDragons,3e04qp,scissorblades,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:50:17 2015 UTC,"Would help to see your box/team(s). Progress rate really depends on your starting pull if you get a good lead or not. I'm at rank 153 after ~70 days, the only 'descends' I've done are the normal Hera and Two Heroes. Still on the first floor on Starlight Sanctuary afaik ranks go quick up to ~180 once you can clear that can farm the final floor. It sounds kind of like you didn't get a strong starting pull and have been slowed down by that relative to many players here who re-rolled for a strong lead."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e04qp,vert_mike,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:31:30 2015 UTC,"Don't think about PAD as a game where you should be comparing your progress to others - it's single player for a reason. You play at your own pace, so only compare your progress to how you FEEL you're progressing. Do you feel like you're going too slowly? Do you feel like you're hitting a wall of some sort? What content can't you clear yet, and what does your box look like? Maybe take time to research your units and make a better team with what you have, or maybe spend some time in Endless Corridor honing your orb-matching skills.  Either way, no matter what the answer to your question is, don't sell yourself short - play the game at your own pace, and if you're still enjoying yourself, why does it matter if you're doing better or worse than anybody else?"
PuzzleAndDragons,3e04qp,CardboardOverlord,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:04:24 2015 UTC,"Not a hardened veteran, but not a newb either. To echo what everyone else here has said, PAD is a game that one can enjoy at their own pace. I've seen people of all kinds enjoy it at different speeds, and /u/JayJx more or less has it down. Even if you frequent all of the PAD communities, all the people active on there are but a mere fraction of the total number of people playing in NA. These people probably just see the game for what it is - a game, and not a competition.  Also, take solace in the fact that the very producer of the PAD, YamaP, is apparently terrible at his own game. Pretty hard to ""beat"" that."

I myself have played for 23 days and am closing in on rank 120, and I intend on getting to or above rank 200 by the end of the summer. I'm guessing your monster collection is pretty extensive though, simply from the sheer amount of time that you've been playing. You should have the means in your monster box to clear a descend without stones. Edit: Sorry if I came off as blunt, but it's an honest answer."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e04qp,PhantomNox,9,Mon Jul 20 22:56:28 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain most players seem to be around the same rank as days because they are the vocal part of the community. The vast (silent) majority I would imagine range between rank 125~250 with more days than that played.  You just have more dedication to the game than OP, and there's nothing wrong with either of you.  So, to OP I say that you should just play the game however it suits you. If all you want to do is play casually then it's not a problem, and looking into completing some descends might just be your next horizon in the game."

Near the year mark, I decided to do an alt account and to reroll until I got something of a different style.   First roll - DMeta. Now mind you, this was a year ago when he was still the bomb diggity. I celebrated. Someone sent me a PM asking me to trade accounts. They had a fresh alt account they were just sitting on to collect eggs which had some lucky rolls and was sitting on Ronia, Ronia, Blonia, D/B Batman, Vitra, Tiamat IRCC. A handful of stones too. 20 or something. I figured, DMeta was too IAP for an alt and this other account gave me a solid devil team to play with which was the exact opposite of my main Kirin.

So I maybe did that a few times until I rolled a Venus.

PuzzleAndDragons,3e238l,SBelmont,2,Tue Jul 21 12:59:29 2015 UTC,The skill up happens when the evo materials matches the original skill. Then it gets applied to the new skill. This was tested with the dragon fusion evos.

PuzzleAndDragons,3e238l,refreshing90,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:30:16 2015 UTC,I think it's still possible that we'll get a skill up event before the skill changes. It's worth waiting a week or so just to hope it pays off.  At worst you just didn't have awoken meimei for 1-2 weeks.
PuzzleAndDragons,3e238l,White_Dynamite22,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:27:43 2015 UTC,I highly doubt they're gonna change it before Haku/Leilan comes out like in JP.  Having only 1 of the jewel able to skill up a monster makes no sense at all.
PuzzleAndDragons,3e238l,Toadleclipse,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:35:41 2015 UTC,this sounds like a great idea. good call
PuzzleAndDragons,3e238l,White_Dynamite22,-2,Tue Jul 21 12:38:13 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that if they announce the active skill change you should awoken evo asap even without the skill level event since 10% > 0%
PuzzleAndDragons,3e238l,scrllock,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:52:10 2015 UTC,"This is  awful advice.  The ult evo process goes as follows:  Put in mats, select if you want to uevo or keep normal evo, THEN the materials are fed in as if in the power up fusion process.  Feeding jewels without the same skill shouldn't skill up awoken form unless they have been updated to awoken version.    Edit: guess i just dont understand how skilling up the original skill transfers a skill up to the normal skill, when it should reset."

Best way to save is exactly as you stated; make a ton of 6+ cards, then make some 36+ cards, then feed in batches of 5 or build up to bigger amounts.  Best way to save money while feeding plus eggs is to store the plus eggs on monsters with as low a level cap as possible. It costs more gold to feed gold into higher level monsters even if they are max level. Carbuncles and tamadras are example candidates."

I dump plus eggs into a cheap fodder monster until it gets about 30-40+ eggs, then start on a new fodder monster.  The stat distribution ends up being pretty even, and then when the target monster is +280 or so I'll pay attention to what stat each plus egg is and make a final feed that brings it to exactly +297."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e06qr,JayJx,2,Tue Jul 21 01:28:27 2015 UTC,"You don't have to make sure that you're stacking the same stat on your fodder monsters in the method I described. Just any combination of 5 +eggs into a +egg carrier, and then 5 of those into a 6+ monster. I'll typically feed in batches of 10~120 up until the card is almost maxed on a stat too, and then I pay attention to the fodder that I designate for the card.  If I understood you correctly, you're just feeding batches of +5 onto the same fodder card over and over up until about 40+, and then you start a new one. It's just slightly more expensive since feed costs go up if the +level goes up during a feed, so you're paying for the +6, +11, +16, +21, +26, +31, etc. feeds as opposed to just +6, +6, +6, +6, +6, and then +36."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e06qr,Chocobean,4,Tue Jul 21 01:32:31 2015 UTC,"If your target monster will gain more awakenings, feed the plusses to tamadras because tamas will always be at level one, saving you some Gold Coins. Actually I fed away some +9 tama even after I have no more awakenings cuz plusses are worth more than awakenings.   I also didn't wait to feed +36s together. I like being able to see my progress.   No rush. The whole project to +297 will take so long non IAP that by then tamas and coin and EXP will mean NOTHING to you. (Source: ~day 500, 2x 297)"

PuzzleAndDragons,3e06qr,reki,2,Mon Jul 20 23:45:03 2015 UTC,"Don't be that demoralized, I'm less than a year into the game and I'm almost done with my 3rd +297.  Also, I haven't been running coin dungeons, so I'm not even being efficient.  Non-iap, except for the 5 stones for $1 deal."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e06qr,W2T,2,Tue Jul 21 01:55:23 2015 UTC,Are you JP or NA? 3 +297s in under a year's pretty damn efficient on NA.
PuzzleAndDragons,3e06qr,alfuh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:35:26 2015 UTC,Modern day non IAP should 297 every 2 months or so. A year ago (before 5 min stam and lots of events) it was maybe every 6 months though.   Source: me
PuzzleAndDragons,3e06qr,W2T,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:45:13 2015 UTC,Pls explain. Running lots of coin dungeons?    I don't get it    Source: have no 297s :(
PuzzleAndDragons,3e06qr,alfuh,4,Tue Jul 21 20:52:08 2015 UTC,"Um, not even.  2 months = 60 days =  17, 280 stam. Even at 50 stam per +egg, which is the lower end of weekday normals at 1.5x drop, that's 345 +eggs.  If you can run kotg at any time, OoH during weekend, mechs or FT5 during 5x techs, prepare (or stone) for SV, and factor in rank ups, it'll be even faster.  I say 2 months or so because you'll likely be doing other things like farming evo mats or playing descends or challenges for piis. It does get faster when you're not constantly building teams.   I currently mix in kotg with alt coins, but according to the alt coin guide on here, it will give you a +297 every 3-4 weeks, a couple maxed cards every week, and occasional piis. Well worth it if you have the team / friends / BFF."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e06qr,aznxpwr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:22:07 2015 UTC,"Shit balls. What am I doing with my time??    I run the Normals at 1.5 most days unless there is a dragon descend on color for my team. Just started clearing the mech dragons (kinda left them there for a looong time), still can't beat kotg, I hit OoH on the weekends, and this is will be my first time running SV later today.     I guess I've been burning a lot of stamina on descends lately and as I'm not even level 200 quite yet I don't have much stamina to go around.    I'll report back when I get Urd to 297"
PuzzleAndDragons,3e06qr,W2T,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:44:31 2015 UTC,"If it's farmable and has a plus it automatically becomes plus egg fodder to me, even before use as skillup, uvo, or exp fodder."

PuzzleAndDragons,3e06qr,Shoemakerrr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:52:29 2015 UTC,I would compare the replacement cost.   +eggs are roughly 30-40 stam on average and farmable at any time.   Skill up fodder can be 50 stam guaranteed or 100 stam average and often limited time.   Uvo mats like jewels are maybe 300 stam on average and are usually available but limited in the sense they need to be easily farmable.
PuzzleAndDragons,3e06qr,BlademasterFlash,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:53:48 2015 UTC,"""hey I think I'll give this guy some plus eggs to clear out my box""  In reality I just make a bung of +6 monsters and then feed those, too lazy to keep going for +36, and the stats do come in handy once in a while. Coins aren't exactly hard to come by so I don't really bother with being the most efficient."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e06qr,Vortegon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:07:28 2015 UTC,depends on how much u coin dungeon :3
PuzzleAndDragons,3e06qr,BlademasterFlash,2,Tue Jul 21 04:38:02 2015 UTC,"Eh, I mean I don't stone them I just burn a full bar of stam+ if I rank up and then wait to go again. If I want to run a descend or challenge I won't run a coin dungeon because I want my stamina bar as full as possible. If I get low on money I can just run weekend pretty easily as well. Plus to level up monsters I will stone king carnival and selling the golds from that makes back the money from buying king carnival and then some if you are lucky. Basically doing coins a few days a week and running descends, daily dungeons, collabs, etc I don't find it hard to keep a large amount of coins lying around. If I did stone them or just ignore everything else however I can see that it can get costly."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e06qr,in0ri,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:03:26 2015 UTC,I run the Mechdragons on the mondays we have 5x plus egg technicals so I end up with +36 mechdragons and then feed those off
PuzzleAndDragons,3e06qr,Lunien,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:25:49 2015 UTC,I think you can actually do Mechdragons every day of the week. Everything in that dungeon is almost 100% guaranteed drop anyway

PuzzleAndDragons,3dzwab,red_cactus,2,Mon Jul 20 22:59:20 2015 UTC,"LMeta is better if you've all your colours covered already by virtue of how being On-Colour for damage. Especially if you have Sun Quan, having a team favouring healers is a huge plus. If you have a blue team in the wings waiting to be played, then Isis is better but for L.Kali on her own, L.Meta is definitely your best option. At least, IMO as a L.Kali player who owns Isis/Metatron. I play the team Light-based."

Just playing devil's advocate here, but what about a dungeon with a pre-emptive that you can't survive without a shield?  Or one with more binds.  Or a team combination that requires B/G on the same sub?"
PuzzleAndDragons,3dzwab,sigismond0,4,Mon Jul 20 22:23:13 2015 UTC,they specified Lkali so the last point is moot

PuzzleAndDragons,3dzwab,sigismond0,2,Mon Jul 20 22:33:31 2015 UTC,"He has Indra for shield. Plus, Isis' 15% shield isn't that strong. It won't make the difference of surviving a 38k preemptive from DQ Hera on a Lkali team.   For A. Ra, I would say Isis all the way because her lower CD also synergizes well with Ra's leader skill. For LKali specifically, I'd argue Lmeta is a lot better since SQ is used on almost all LKali teams."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dzwab,DaijoubuLoL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:28:59 2015 UTC,"The only thing I know Isis shield is good for might just be 100% gravity, even then, indra is better and also have the main light attribute. Isis would be better if her quick guard had a heal attached."

PuzzleAndDragons,3dzwab,reki,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:01:37 2015 UTC,I sure hope her active will be buffed to 3 turns soon. She's really on an unfair advantage compared to awoken isis.

Or you can say that she will win the next voting for uevo but she will most likely receive another leader skill. There's no voting for awoken exclusives as of yet. That argument isnt valid. She can be compared to awoken isis because she wouldnt receive awoken form anytime soon and there isnt a pattern. Only way is to buff her active to 3 turns cd, just like how they tweaked RGY/GGY active CD."

PuzzleAndDragons,3dzwab,reki,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:36:38 2015 UTC,"I'd say LMeta.   On color Additional bind clear awakenings (helpful for when you want to clear binds, but don't want to waste an active) Easier to evo Easier to skill Will still potentially get new awakenings/stat increases if she ever gets a split/UU evo. Healer typing, if using SQ   A Isis does come in handy if you need 100% SBR.  Something like  LKali LKali AIsis DLBatman Izanagi  But if you have something dark with a SBR, like Gryps or Yomi, you could use that to cover dark, and use LMeta instead of AIsis."

If you decide to go with DrOrganicSwagPHD's suggestion, you'll need the Valkyrie anyway. As a heroes series lead, Wukong has a lot of damage potential.  By my read of your box, you have almost all of the pieces for it and as you work towards the more advanced evolutions you'll start to see improvements in each stage of the way."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e0qg6,FreeCuber,2,Tue Jul 21 01:48:35 2015 UTC,"Man - You really should create yourself a Pad Herder.   Friday Twinlits  Either Way here's a Write up and a link to how to do Friday Twinlits. You have all the pieces, just run Chibi Metatron, and see if you can get some skill ups on your Lilith and Echidna:  The Team   Chibi Light Meta | Valkyrie | D/D Lilith | Echnida | King Shynee | Friend Light Meta Ult Evo   The Strategy is as follows:   Floor 1: Match one set of Light Orbs + 2 or so other color matches and target one of the little ""Mythlits"". This will leave 1 maybe 2 or so other ""mythlits"" alive. These Mythlits will attempt to continually bind your team. Stall here until both Lilith's and Echidna's Skills are ready and then clear the remaining Mythlits. Floor 2: You can stall one more turn here if need be, but generally you clear this floor by using Lilith's Poison Floor 3: Take the Preemptives from the Dub-Mythlits. Use Echidna's Skill and Kill the two Dub-Mythlits leaving only the baby Tamadra Alive. Once the Mythlits are dead, feel free to literally setup the board as you so choose without even having to match orbs. The Tamadra will not kill you. I've mimic'd this guy's pattern. Notice how he places orbs and sets up the board on the tamadra then poisons again to clear the tamadra. You can generally setup like 8 or 9 Combos this way by staggering the Light and Heart Orbs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDRvqmPPO24 Floor 4: Echinda if you want just in case and if her skill is back up. Use Light Meta to clear any remaining bind if necessary. Target the ""Angelit"" and then use Valkyrie, King Shynee, and then unleash all the combos you set up in the previous floor and BOOM go both Twinlits in one shot.   It's a very reliable team and very safe usually unless you get no light Orbs on the first floor. This is where Valk is very useful when skilled up.  Thursday Trifruits   You're pretty stocked on Red Monsters so this might work. Granted, this is entirely dependent on red Orbs on the first two floors. It fails from time to time if orb trolled. You're gonna want max Levels on all monsters and awakenings and a Max Skilled Gigas. Chibi lu bu will do unless you pair with a Real Lu Bu. If you pair with a real Lu Bu, I'd suggest running perhaps with Hera-Ur Senpai or the Hellfire Pyro Demon.  The Team   Hera Ur Lead | Holy Night Hera | Ronia | Gigas | chibi lu bu or Hera-Ur Senpai | Friend Hera-Ur or Lu Bu    The Strategy:   Floor 1: Match a set of Red and A Set of Dark if you can. The Decreased movement time sucks, but if you can get a Red Mass attack off even better. You need to kill the 4 seeds immediately and then have a few turns to finish off the dragon Fruit, If you get orb trolled here your run may end.  Floor 2: Usually makes or Breaks the run right here... If you have enough Red and Dark Orbs you want to mass attack and kill all the plants immediately. If some are not synced and you can take a few out and don't get attacked, then you may be able to get another turn off. If you get bound here you're most likely going to probably fail. Floor 3: If you've made it here and haven't used Gigas yet, Use him here and do a Mass Attack with as many combos as you can to Kill both the Plant and Fruit, but leave the Tamadra alive. The Plan from here on out is to leave the Tamadra Alive and stall for Ronia's Active. Try to not kill him before the Ronia and Lu Bu and Hera-Ur's skills are ready. Just move an orb and make no matches if your guys are bound and you need some time to just let the binds wear off. When Ready - Kill the Tamadra and proceed to the Boss level. Floor 4: The easiest of the floors to be honest now that you have all actives ready. Use Ronia -> Hera-Ur -> Lu Bu. If the Hellfire Pyro Demon Active is up sure use that too. Match as many Rows/Combos as can be and you should be able to kill all the fruits at once.    Potential Red Attacker Team  Another Option is to run a Red Urd Attacker Team. I've never done this, but in theory, something like this could work.   Urd Lead | chibi cao cao | King Flamie | Attacker R/L Horus | Gigas (max skilled) | Friend Urd   The Strategy is probably the same as the Devil Walk through.    Floor 1: Kill Regularly  Floor 2: Kill Regularly with Mass Attack if you can Floor 3: Use Gigas and Mass Attack. Stall on the Tamadra till other team actives are ready. If possible wait for Gigas again. Floor 4: Use Urd Active -> cao cao Active  -> Gigas Active -> Horus Active Enhance -> King Flamie. This is actually  a 100% Red enhanced Board. I'm pretty sure this will blow up the fruits and splatter them on the walls. What remains of the fruits will drop as a gold egg.   I can't tell if your Cao Cao is chibi or not, but regardless, that looks like it would be a pretty effective if you had the levels on your team.  Hope that helps. I think you're gonna need to get some levels though to make these runs work though.   Also, maybe your Athena team could work here too.    Athena | God Valk if you can get her | Izanagi | Avalon Drake | God Verche | Friend Athena   *Two Prong your way through. Get to the Tamadra and stall. Avalon Drake -> Athena -> Izanagi and Match Two Prongs to slice and dice fruit. You can probably use the Valk skill if needed on Floor 3. A Skilled Verche will also help with Orb Troll Early to help get 2-prongs to get you to the boss floor."

PuzzleAndDragons,3e0qg6,HourScrew,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:44:36 2015 UTC,For Thursday you want a fire based team with at least 1 orb changer that'll be up floor 1.  Anything that's 9x or higher should have you clearing it. Thursday is considered one of the easier weekly mythicals
PuzzleAndDragons,3e0qg6,Krypto406,0,Tue Jul 21 03:10:04 2015 UTC,"I used this thread for beating Friday mythical. Use chibi metatron for lead and shynee instead of arcline and you should be able to do the dungeon if you can stall on the first turn to wait for lilith. It is important to know that if you do not do a mass attack on the final floor, you will only kill one of them."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dz72z,waterfan71,8,Mon Jul 20 18:49:46 2015 UTC,"Summoned here by a friend, but Awoken Anubis is certainly a more powerful leader than D/L Anubis in the right hands. They fulfil different roles in my opinion, with Awoken covering the stronger dungeons (think pii technical. I'm sure D/L could technically do it, but it is ""safer"" with Awoken). D/L would still be more useful in say the weekend dungeon where you really don't need 100x.  In regards to your opening statement about getting a badpii, is that just showing that you cleared challenge level 9 with Anubis or were you planning on using that pii on D/L Anubis? I do not recommend the latter as he has a farmable skillup."

In the right hands, Awoken Anubis pretty much smashes everything except those bosses with built in resolve. I would not use a Badpii on D/L, but will be using my Badpiis on Awoken. If you plan on transitioning to Awoken, I would try to nab and max skill 2 DIza, for actives every 3 turns with continuous damage reduction. And if you have DKali or Haku, then that's the dream. Cathy is not a rare drop but as you know, even with 2.5 skill-up rate, 2.5 times 0 is still 0..."

It's too easy to accidentally pop the 16x on D/L Anubis and enrage bosses.  If you hit the multiplier with a skill used on Awoken Anubis you will be killing most bosses/floors instantly.  Just my 0.02

The majority of the drops for the dungeon are for the purpose of skilling up your Elemental Series characters (if you have any). If you plan to use it for a sub I'd suggest just using the actual Card for a better set of stats and awakenings than Kapibara-san. Luckily they're pretty obtainable and easy to come by, so if you're dead-set on getting a sylph or one of the other elementals, it's within the realm of possibility lol"

Sylph is good as a lead for Draggie and Thanatos can help devil teams in Sandalphon but those are the only uses I'm familiar with. Definitely not worth evolving the fodder from this dungeon but I'm planning on making a few runs during 2x and feeding the evolved drops.
PuzzleAndDragons,3e1941,cptal,2,Tue Jul 21 16:25:57 2015 UTC,Yeah I was wondering how much effort I would use. I did spend a decent amount of effort leveling up my Healer girls cause they actually have a use.

PuzzleAndDragons,3e1941,wildcard58,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:36:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for chiming in. I wasn't really thinking about them as skill-up dungeons but I'll look at collabs through that lens now too.
PuzzleAndDragons,3e004g,shizuibla,3,Mon Jul 20 22:17:45 2015 UTC,"She has a large REM sub availability so her potential as a lead is pretty good. Her teams have a great balance of stats and her damage can skyrocket if you have enough rows. Here's a video of her clearing C10. I think this guy's team is hypermaxed, which is why the team has so much health but she still has an excellent health pool without an excessive amount of +eggs."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e004g,Turbeypls,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:31:31 2015 UTC,I like her active but it seems as if she was made as a sub for durga. She's got the same atk bonus as  nepythys but weaker rcv and hp buffs. She does get devil subtype though. Nep lacks a subtype
PuzzleAndDragons,3e004g,IAmTheRoommate,6,Mon Jul 20 23:02:45 2015 UTC,"You're confusing Famiel with Lumiel. Famiel is the UY sub, Lumiel is the Durga sub."

PuzzleAndDragons,3dyn2h,bluosXD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:31:06 2015 UTC,"Can't go wrong with TPA or rows. With TPA team, you would want to match 5, 4, 3 orbs to achieve most damage. With row team, you would want 6,5,3. I like archangel gabriel, siegfried, or amon (2 rows for awaken) as subs. Gabriel enhances heal orbs which achieves the 5 connected orbs easier with siegfried/hermes."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dyn2h,ExcaliburLOL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:50:28 2015 UTC,"OK for Andromeda and Hermes as staple subs (maybe wait for Hermes new branching ultimate to be sure, but.....OK). They must be max skilled. Andromeda is very important for SBR as Sara has none.  Famiel is OK, but CD is quiet long and you're not sure to generate many orbs, i would use him only if board refresh is needed. I would prefer a 5 turns over him, better an heart breaker. I would consider Famiel as an utility more than a staple sub.  Sara teams need HP, so Sieg > Fenrir. Rows or TPA are not that much important, if you activate well, you can overkill most of the time anyway.   Sun Quan is also an interesting utility solution for delay if max skilled. Last utility that would be helpful is a damage shield."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dyn2h,chamule4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:19:26 2015 UTC,What's your opinion on the blue grimiore for orb enhance? Obviously this would be in addition to an orb changer and board refresher.
PuzzleAndDragons,3dyn2h,vicioust,2,Mon Jul 20 17:49:42 2015 UTC,"I think she's pretty good, but skilling her would probably be hell. I think /u/crescive uses her."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dyn2h,Sunjuan,2,Mon Jul 20 18:34:00 2015 UTC,"I spent like 8-9 stones and walked away with a max skilled Apollo, Gabriel, almost Andromeda, and 8 Karin jewels. It could've been a lot worse considering I got 0 skill ups for Theurgia and only 1 for Armadel.   I'm at a point where the dungeon isn't hard, just tedious. Lots of runs where I got pre-emptive jammers on my water orbs, wood sprite into double wood demons, and Michael is always annoying to deal with.   I think I will use her on my Sarasvati team when the Uevo comes out. Andromeda/Hermes are really good, but have no orb enhance of their own. The green orb enhance also helps if you're running a board change or a wood orb changer (like Hermes). With Sarasvati's lower activation threshold, new LS mechanic, and active skill spawning two orbs I think Paulina would be a great sub (high hp is nice too)."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dyn2h,Crescive,0,Mon Jul 20 19:48:48 2015 UTC,"yes I find her decent too. I have UandY and Skuld in My team, so don't feel the need for her orb enhance, but it's important to be able to activate the 5 orbs burst."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e08uv,Ape_Sauce,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:24:59 2015 UTC,"You could work towards an Awoken Bastet team in the future with subs like Liu Bei, Awoken Meimei, Marine Rider, etc. Maybe sub in Asgard as a defensive option??? seems nice to have when you don't have Kush/Susano."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e08uv,DrOrganicSwagPHD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:45:37 2015 UTC,"Awoken Bastet/Liu Bei/Meimei/ADKZ/flex. Consider BAO Robin (low CD, time extend), Earth Dragon Knight (unbindable unbinder and orb change, low stats), Cu chu (same active, without the unbinding, 5 turns instead of 6, higiher stats), Marine Rider (double TPA, but you already have Liu Bei and Meimei to do damage for you), Kano (skill bind resist, autoheal)  You could make a decent Kirin team but I don't think that'd interest you if you already play UY.   I also see the makings of a good Hathor team: Hathor/Lvalk/Zeus and Hera when they come to NA/Lmeta/Ama. Having two bind clearers might be a bit much but Ama and Lmeta are your best picks for blue and red. Ideally Ama would be Lkali. Good thing is your team should have plenty of RCV, being healer focus. Since you have so many healers, maybe you could get Sandalphon to fill in the blue spot for some healer boost/damage reduction (he sucks to skill though and it's a hard dungeon).  Those are the best teams I see. Medjed and Sphinx were pretty easy for me to beat with my own UY team so Bastet is doable (I farmed up some masks with UY as well and got jewels from doing challenge descend dungeons, also with UY)."

PuzzleAndDragons,3dwjvb,VilAlesund,2,Mon Jul 20 04:28:04 2015 UTC,Nice! Your videos are always really helpful to me since I run nearly the same team (Karin instead of Skuld). Very jealous that you're non-IAP and have her ><
PuzzleAndDragons,3dwjvb,vahs,2,Mon Jul 20 04:41:14 2015 UTC,Nothing really to be that excited about with Skuld as a Lakshmi sub to be honest. She isn't really that great without Trunks. I'm looking to hopefully roll a second Andromeda to replace Skuld.
PuzzleAndDragons,3dwjvb,Esplen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:48:27 2015 UTC,I run Skuld with Kamui (in lieu of Trunks) and the board it makes is good enough that I don't mind Kamui dragging down the team's HP and his bad awakenings. I also like having a 5 turn orb changer.

PuzzleAndDragons,3dwjvb,syuk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:10:08 2015 UTC,"As long as you have other orb changers, it's fine. It's more about timing, really. Do you need to use it now, or can you save it for the boss? Since Lakshmi innately plays defensively, healing every attack, you can get away with heavy damage without too much worry for the turn after. It comes down to your other subs and skill ups, if anything. Of course you wouldn't want to use Buri if its your only orb changer, but if you have Andromeda or even Kamui in reserve, it's safe to use it. Since some floors have harder floors than others and require a big nuke, using both actives is essential at times."

I used an Awoken Bastet team to farm it, which worked pretty well, but the combo requirement and careful management of skills contributed to just wearing me down after doing it so often.

The Pengdras hit HARD when you start at level 1. Floor 3 -- Died to the two synced small shieldras after focusing down the big one in the middle. Floor 4 -- The preempts from the blue and light pirates sometimes got me when I wasn't getting heart skyfalls. Floor 5 -- Trying to stall a few turns for skills, then couldn't kill the dark/fire dragons before they attacked. Floor 6 -- Same as floor 2 Floor 7 -- Usually not too bad, but died here sometimes because I wanted to save a skill for later floors, resulting in not enough damage. Floor 8 -- Zaerog on a 2 turn timer, along with being forced to use skills on previous floors usually meant death. Floor 9 -- This floor was my absolute favorite.  I definitely didn't make 6 combos a few times, which meant death.  Sometimes I didn't have enough orbs to ping him 32 hp in 3 turns -- then you either eat a 14k hit or get a card bound for 2 turns;  the hit isn't too bad, but the bind usually screwed me over.  Once I entered the floor and didn't have enough red or green orbs to make a single combo;  I made 7 combos, but no red/green skyfalls, so he killed me. Floor 10 -- If at least one A. Bastet active wasn't up, pretty much an auto lose.  Not doing enough damage-->Heal to full + skill bind --> Death."

PuzzleAndDragons,3e0gv9,curtdissel,3,Tue Jul 21 00:30:07 2015 UTC,"I personally am a big advocate of Hermes-> Andromed active combos so I would run ALaks/Hermes/Andy/Karin/Amberjack (ideally this would be Gabriel).  This will give you a good mix of solid actives and well-rounded stats and awakenings.  Feel free to ask about anything, and if you want add me at   372496223  I run a hypermax Alaks most of the time."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e0gv9,iplayvicariously,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:16:10 2015 UTC,"I feel like that kind of team relies too much on two-active combos. Double Andromeda is excellent for this kind of team, and Karin/Amberjack will provide enough burst when needed. Besides, I find Amberjack a better choice since he can make 2/3 water with Karin. Although I'm a bit fishbiased."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e0gv9,Grim_Sheep,2,Tue Jul 21 02:40:04 2015 UTC,I went with Amberjack (besides the fact that I only have him) since he combos well with Karin and he has 3 orb enhance awakenings. I really like orb enhance awakenings and they make clearing trash floors easy since this team lacks TPAs.
PuzzleAndDragons,3e0gv9,iplayvicariously,2,Tue Jul 21 09:45:12 2015 UTC,"I guess that comes down to player preference and dungeons then. Many lategame dungeons do not allow room for small activations from a single active unless your board is exceptional, and I've found that having a solid 2-3 larger skill combos makes a bigger difference."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e0gv9,iplayvicariously,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:23:49 2015 UTC,"Do I need that much burst? I went with a 2nd Andromeda over Hermes cause she has over twice as much RCV. Without a lot of plusses, I felt that the RCV would be too low which is why I threw her on there."

PuzzleAndDragons,3dx4ff,ZackariahL,2,Mon Jul 20 11:11:20 2015 UTC,I'm amazed there's always 5 dark orbs in every round.  RNG was quite kind to him.  Very interesting playstyle indeed.

PuzzleAndDragons,3dx4ff,HourScrew,2,Mon Jul 20 07:46:56 2015 UTC,This is what my team will end up being. The orb enhancers are not there because I want their orb enhance.

It took me a little over two weeks to max skill him on natural stamina, and now he is a solid sub on my Hathor/LKali & Sonia Gran teams.  I was actually enjoying this game a lot while working on defoud.  Stamina was spent in a flash, no need to worry about filling up.  I was beyond collabs, descends, no schedules, I played when I wanted and it was pretty stress free.  I think I'm going to start max Skilling my Red Odin even during non-weekends pretty soon just for that feeling of no-pressure."

You must have gotten pretty lucky with skill ups if 2 weeks (14 days= 40ish runs of natural stamina), i'd factor in rank ups more, but it's exp/stam is real trashy.

PuzzleAndDragons,3dx63h,JayJx,2,Mon Jul 20 22:32:37 2015 UTC,There's the farmable setup of LFagan that clears this about just as fast (33 seconds?).  LFagan/TornadoHolyDrag/Defoud/2xWhiskeyDrag/LFagan.  Requires lots of skillups and either a LFagan best friend or a lot of LFagan friends. But totally farmable.  Off the top of my head the other incredibly fast non-rodin teams include: Lubu/Vritra/A.Ra setups. Goemon is fast too but his team requires probably one or two Rodins for skill boosts and clear.

PuzzleAndDragons,3dx63h,Taen-,2,Tue Jul 21 06:44:06 2015 UTC,The only reason Lubu is there in the first place is to clear a floor. His boost is irrelevant. You could do the same thing except with no attack eggs with an Awoken Ra or Vritra.

This'll probably be too much cost for you but use whatever you can with the best stats for your cost restriction. Skuld's leader skill has more flexibility than Liu Bei's so it's easier to build a team around her. Hopefully you'll pull more green subs to use your Liu Bei later. For now, though, maybe set him aside for a bit."
PuzzleAndDragons,3e049g,Sunjuan,3,Mon Jul 20 23:23:34 2015 UTC,"Go anubis and yomi. Jkkk   I agree with earlier comments, you can also use blonia as lead too and skuld and ult amon as subs, slap in two king bubblies and call it a day. Loll, super troll but works the same as Ronia teams rocking two baddies.  As for which pantheon to focus, based on your current box I would strongly recommend only egyptian 1, egyptian 2, and maybe japanese 2 (and no other ones)  ::Egyptian 1::  Everything is somewhat relevant, even a dupe anubis can get you two extra time extend for combo teams.   Ra is just Ra, the god of teams right now, your sun quan is good for both his l/l version and his awoken version. Though he is not quite as good without at least one kali.   Horus is a strong lead too, and you have red fckin odin and a Chibi one! so jellllyyy   Isis will work with your skuld team along with sun quan in her awoken form or physical form. A strong pick in many rainbow teams too.  ::Bastet:: Is the real jewel, her awoken form is currently an S tier lead and you already have her S tier sub Liu Bei. Kushinada also works well with her when you skill her up.  ::Egyptian 2::  Almost the same deal as Egyptian 1  Nepnep is a bit weaker but she's still great waifu material. There's many good farmable dark monsters. Slap in a vamp and you can take full advantage of her orb enhance awakenings and active. (I just recently made a post on the power of orb enhance awakenings if you want to take a look).  Set, generally the weakest of the pantheon but again, you have red fckin odin so who cares.   Hathor is hathor, currently an A tier lead. Get a valk and you can take on the world. Jk, I just have a huge bias for her lololll. Dem jugs~  Nut is physical blue thus going very well with your possible skuld and blonia team. She's also pretty strong as a mono blue lead herself.  ::Osiris:: like bastet is currently one of the strongest lead, rating A+ as a lead that goes well with your S tier sub Liu Bei. Kushinada is also strong on his team due to his green hp and rcv mutiplier you can hit a lot of thresholds with her active.   ::japanese 2::  Only u&y is really good here. You can use him as a top tier skuld sub or a leader by himself since you already have some of his best subs: U&Y | Sun quan | d/l yomi | farmable light valk | flex | Friend u&y  Verdandi is also amazing cuz you have liu bei but unfortunately there's no pantheons for her.

PuzzleAndDragons,3dzybx,Sunjuan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:54:08 2015 UTC,"Um I'm not sure how much farther any of the teams I suggest could take you but this is what I saw:   You probably considered an Awoken Shiva team... Shiva/Leilan/chiyome/Hino/Hino looks OP. Only thing would be a lack of RCV. Awoken Minerva, yamato, Ares, and Dino Rider could also make good subs. Minerva has nice five-turn orb change and def break, but you don't really need more of that on a Shiva team. Yamato is row-based, which isn't really Shiva's style, and so is Ares, but they're good orb changers. Dino Rider is lacking in the HP and RCV stat department. That's why I suggested the team I did. Ideally you'd want Rvalk somewhere. Could take out a second hino for another sub I mentioned.   You could make a wukong team with wukong/apollo/arthur/baal/awoken venus. 10 rows with a friend wukong. Baal will be annoying to skill. Arthur I suggested over the second apollo because he has a row.  You could also make a Pandora team with Pandora/Pandora/Dark Valk/Hanzo/Persephone. Maybe stick in FA luci somewhere. If only you had Haku for the board wipe...  Anyway. Solid teams. I'm mad jealous of your box."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dzybx,Sunjuan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:41:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the input! I'm really excited for awoken shiva, but yeah, a red valk would be great for the recovery. I could use echidna for the recovery potentially, but then I lose utility elsewhere.  I've definitely thought about Hero teams and I've tried Yamato, but I just suck at that play style. I definitely tend to do better with combo/quad color leads."

PuzzleAndDragons,3dyhcu,dai_,2,Mon Jul 20 19:44:09 2015 UTC,You could wait. In the current rotation there's only Flampy and Shiva Dragon so probably there's more for other elements.
PuzzleAndDragons,3dyhcu,illithid_2003,2,Mon Jul 20 16:01:41 2015 UTC,"Save your MP. The best option to use them on is 25% dark resist across an entire team, but you're still early on to be making that kind of an investment in any team right now. Set up a late game team before you start piling on your resources. Otherwise, you'll only receive marginal benefits right now which you may or may not regret."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dyhcu,ikumo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:02:28 2015 UTC,I see. Related question:  People keep telling me to use my Verdandi-team. Is Verdandi really a proper late game team? Lets say: hypermax verdandi/verdandi/g valk/cu chu/liu whatishecalles and friendleader valk/bastet?  Or should I try to aim for something different like bastet-meimei rotation since only 2 are missing?
PuzzleAndDragons,3dyhcu,mytherrus,2,Mon Jul 20 16:06:28 2015 UTC,"Verd is only a lategame leader with vigorously optimal subs and heavy plussing and skilling.  You don't have vigorously optimal subs, so I recommend investing in Kirin, since she has far more farmable options, as well as REM options.  Post your box and we might be able to help you out :D"
PuzzleAndDragons,3dyhcu,Alakazam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:04:00 2015 UTC,"The kirin team will force you to combo better, but the Verdandi team can clear a lot of content regardless.   I'm in a similar situation. I'm clearing content with my urd team, but I'm learning awoken bastet. Eventually, when I uevo my liu bei and mei mei, bastet will be my main team"
PuzzleAndDragons,3dyhcu,ikumo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:25:35 2015 UTC,"Verdandi can reach the late - early endgame with high plusses and the right subs (pretty much as many copies of liu bei as you can get). Without at least 2 bei I think verdandi's pretty lacking as a lead, since you're just playing an unconditional 3-3.3x lead. Verdandi NEEDS liu bei to do damage. Verdandi is okay for a late game team, but she is a far reach from an endgame team."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dyhcu,heram_king,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:27:42 2015 UTC,"verdandi sucks. fight me verdandi fans. :P  She's alright, but I don't consider her late game viable. She can ezmode a lot of dungeons, and her subs and herself are great subs on osiris and a.bastet. Those two and imo awoken mei are all stronger late game leads than verdandi."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dyhcu,machinepeen,2,Mon Jul 20 22:23:54 2015 UTC,If you're not sure you should wait; you never know what else they'll add to the rotation.  Nothing in the current rotation is particularly game-breaking & actually worth rushing to get.  I feel like since we got Flampy/Shiva Dragon the first rotation (both of which are fire) we'll eventually get 300k MP cards for other colors.  By that time you'd have more points and also a clearer picture of what you actually want.
PuzzleAndDragons,3dyhcu,viconius,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:05:06 2015 UTC,"I think waiting is the best option. You're not going to get a lot of MPs unless you IAP heavily (and MPs shouldn't motivate you to IAP) so when you're ready to invest them you should have an endgame team and know exactly why you're spending them.   It's also a brand new mechanic, with  opportunities in the future for buffs to latent Tamas, new latent Tamas, new cards in the shop, etc."

Make an imgur album of screenshots or use padherder.com  Here's an overview of the dungeon: http://www.puzzledragonx.com/en/mission.asp?m=822  As you can see, many monsters have multi-hit moves, so an Odin method wouldn't worth because the damage reduction would only apply to the first hit, and then you'd die.  You should definitely develop a team more before doing this dungeon; it used to be a descend so it's no catwalk.  Also getting Zeus for his skill... I don't really recommend it. The cooldown is extremely long; you'd have to stall a lot to be able to use it in a dungeon, and most higher end dungeons are not conducive to stalling. Skilling him up would take a long time too. And why do you need the 35% gravity?  Edit: Hi Jerry. Didn't look at username."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dyq6p,Sunjuan,7,Mon Jul 20 17:04:18 2015 UTC,"Possible, but inconsistent. Here's a better method to get Zeus:  You're going to need 297 +1 eggs, a very big box (sorry, 20-box challengers), and Hera. This method works best if you have ""Awoken Stick-san and String-kun"" from the Traps Collab from a while ago, but it's not necessary.  First you feed your plus eggs to Hera and put her under the box. Zeus will take the bait, and at the right moment, you 100-0 him by pulling the string. If you don't have Stick and String, this method is only 50% effective as he'll use Mars Daylight to OHKO you.  Hope this helps and good luck!"

The leader skill does enough damage with those plus eggs to one shot the first few stages. Best to not match elements that your party consists of so you don't have to wait for the combos to roll or watch your monsters do their damage. Rest of party should be able to one shot final stage, can throw in one of those slimes with 3x dmg if short on dmg for whatever typing your party consists most of.

Your team: Hino, Ronia x3, Lu Bu, Friend Ronia. Floors 1-4: any match (off color is fastest) to clear the floor. Floor 5: Friend Ronia and Lu Bu to clear floor.    Other teams are faster, but you're very close to having this team ready. I'd advise against the Vritra team - it's tempting, but it requires 135ish attack eggs on the Vritras to work, and you'll have to farm a ton of plus eggs to make that investment worthwhile."

PuzzleAndDragons,3dw6r0,fether,2,Mon Jul 20 01:59:01 2015 UTC,I would actually prefer they don't touch her ls and just give her TPAs :/   A lot of her subs have them and it would be easier on matching than making 5s along with 4 other colors
PuzzleAndDragons,3dw6r0,99percentmilktea,3,Mon Jul 20 04:43:23 2015 UTC,"Kite, Asmodeus, Juggler, D.Meta and D.Kali. Jesus Christ. How much of a whale are you?   So I kept an eye on the damage you were doing and it was around 500-700k per sub whenever you did activate the 64x. As blvck said, you didn't go for the optimal style of team (you show off lol) but that's still quite nice for consistent turn by turn damage.   Unfortunately Kite doesn't have the HP/RCV boost that Hathor has, so I'd say you really want to maximise your damage output with OEA as there's a lack of tankiness.   Despite that, excellent video demonstrating in how many different ways you can match the 5 orbs and still get the boost. It also showcased that he still has a very safe 16x to fall back on.   I've speculated many times since Tsubaki/Kaede/Sumire came out that Egypt 2.0 will be getting this as well. And my god, I hope they do. Perhaps not a x2 multiplier but maybe a 1.5x. A 6x (with the x2) for 11 orbs on Nephthys (5-3-3) seems slightly OP as long as they have that tankiness."

PuzzleAndDragons,3dw6r0,blvcksvn,0,Mon Jul 20 03:35:58 2015 UTC,"Please no that team... if you actually stacked orb enhances that team would be much better... copying over from thread http://redd.it/3dlcyl, a much better team without going for an unsynergistic mix of rows and tpa with the 5orb combo would be    [ Empty/Wildcard ]  [ 黒天の幻龍王・ゼローグ∞ ]  [ Goddess of the Dead, Nephthys ]  [ 劫火の威女神, Kali ]  [ Hell Queen Persephone ]    [ Empty/Wildcard ]   [ Enhanced Dark Orbs ]  x7 [ Enhanced Fire Orbs ]  x3 [ Enhanced Water Orbs ] [ Enhanced Wood Orbs ] [ Enhanced Light Orbs ]  x2 [ Extend Time ]  x5 [ Skill Boost ]  x8 [ Resistance-Skill Bind ]  x5  Requires REM subs but brings out the ideal elements of Kite's playstyle. You only need to 5-match Dark orbs, and can use two-prong if you have extra. Zaerog ensures a constant stream of Dark orbs (can drop DKali for another Zaerog). DKali + Persephone creates a Dark-heavy activatable board. Nephthys' orb enhance+burst active can help in all situations. Goetia may be used instead of Nephthys. Lumiel or Typhon may be used instead of DKali. Izanami, Vampire or DValk may be used instead of Persephone. A second Z8 may also be used.  Please don't ignore orb enhance meta when it's screaming it.."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dw6r0,machinepeen,3,Mon Jul 20 01:22:21 2015 UTC,"Hell even a completely farmable team would be solid.  Kite / Zaerog Infinite / Aamir / DIzanami / Flex would have 100% SBR, 6 orb enhances, and fairly substantial utility.  I think the biggest issue for Kite (atm at least) is you basically have to pick between 2 of 3 in orb enhances, skill boosts, and utility (since dark shields & bind clears are fairly limited), but if the meta keeps trending toward enhances like it is that won't be an issue in the near future."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dw6r0,blvcksvn,2,Mon Jul 20 01:36:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Basically any team with at least 5 dark orb enhances eliminates the need for an enhancer like DMeta, who contributes little to a Kite party."

Also, in the video, I tried to do as little combo as I possibly can, just enough to activate his LS to test out his fire power, so that's not really a true judgement on his overall fire power."

Generally the best way to maximize damage on a rainbow team is to run the same main attribute, and let the sub-attributes account for the other colours.  Horus is already F/D so you'll need a F/L, a F/Wt, and a F/Wd, then you have a bonus slot for F/?.  With Horus you don't need hearts, so it's nice to have a heartbreaker or two in there to maximize your damage and ease of activation.  You also want to stay away from most orb and board changers as they won't help you (ie. Nords, Chinese Gods, Greek Gods).  The exceptions are the Kalis that create a fully activateable board.  Damage boosters for Fire, God, or Devil type (depending on how you built your team are very welcome).  Also stay away from row awakenings.  Your best bet would be TPA (as many as possible) or Fire Orb Enhance (up to 6).  Time extend is nice as well.  Also, Horus is flexible and you should change the team to suit the dungeon (ie. sub in Kushinada or Susano if you need to tank some big hits, or sub in Red Odin if you need to poison, etc.  Here are my choices for Horus:   Light: http://puzzledragonx.com/en/monster.asp?n=1728 or http://puzzledragonx.com/en/monster.asp?n=984 or http://puzzledragonx.com/en/monster.asp?n=1272 or http://puzzledragonx.com/en/monster.asp?n=1586 Water: Nothing really good for F/Wt.  Maybe http://puzzledragonx.com/en/monster.asp?n=1650 but you could probably just sub in a better water monster with no fire. Wood: http://puzzledragonx.com/en/monster.asp?n=1660 Bonus: http://puzzledragonx.com/en/monster.asp?n=2078   Again, no need to stick to all fire, but that's one option.  Your best bet with Horus might be to just stack the strongest subs you have and make sure your colors are covered.  You could throw in a sub with God Atk boost and then just make a rainbow colored god team.  Flexibility is key."

Until this point, I was trying to get by using Blue Odin (back when he was only 2.5x Gods & Water) as the leader of a half-ass God-Rainbow team, using Isis/Horus as my friends.  I took a break from Horus when I rolled a Ronia/LuBu, and later when I diligently rolled for a Hathor.  Now I'm happy to head back to my Horus team that has more power and it easier to activate.  There's still a place for Ronia/LuBu and Hathor, but Horus will be my goto."

PuzzleAndDragons,3duqbk,ikumo,3,Sun Jul 19 17:49:21 2015 UTC,Shiva wasn't nearly as upsetting as Scarlet. They're both hero teams on steroids.
PuzzleAndDragons,3duqbk,Lovetan3,15,Sun Jul 19 18:52:06 2015 UTC,"just to make it clear, the amount of dedication a Scarlet team like that would take is insane, and with the amount of grinding it takes you'd be able to perfect any other team as well. this is a ""farmable"" lead in the sense that it doesn't take a Gacha to get her, but it would take you a tremendous amount of stones and grinding to get that team up."

PuzzleAndDragons,3duqbk,Lovetan3,4,Mon Jul 20 00:17:41 2015 UTC,yea but when a team is technically farmable people somehow start thinking it's not an IAP team or is easier to acquire than REM teams. but a Scarlet system probably costs as many or more stones than any mediocre REM team does :p
PuzzleAndDragons,3duqbk,RangeXero,2,Sun Jul 19 19:01:01 2015 UTC,"If a non-iap player pools the evo materials and stones starting now, it is plausible that they can make this team soon after she is released"
PuzzleAndDragons,3duqbk,Lovetan3,9,Sun Jul 19 19:08:39 2015 UTC,she has 11 skill levels and her dungeon is pretty difficult. it would take a non-IAP ages to make that team.
PuzzleAndDragons,3duqbk,RangeXero,3,Sun Jul 19 19:13:05 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of time to build a team capable of cheesing her dungeon specifically, and have a lot of materials ready. Besides, it doesn't have to be a team of 6, it could just be 4 scarlets+2 arbitrary fire monsters. The point is, it is doable with preparations."
PuzzleAndDragons,3duqbk,Lovetan3,4,Sun Jul 19 19:17:38 2015 UTC,"yes it's doable, but it's not some team you run a dungeon real quick to grab it and then wreck Rushes with."
PuzzleAndDragons,3duqbk,RangeXero,2,Sun Jul 19 19:23:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's easy by no means, but doable by all. It's worth investing in imo, as it's one of the few things a non-iap and whale can share without luck being involved."

PuzzleAndDragons,3duqbk,ShakingTowers,8,Sun Jul 19 18:16:02 2015 UTC,Not that that would be a problem for anyone with the resources to build this team...
PuzzleAndDragons,3duqbk,toothmann,3,Sun Jul 19 18:30:56 2015 UTC,the resources actually arent that bad  its about 50 skill ups at about 50 stam per drop  it would probably take less than a 85 stone pack which is less than most full REM teams. Dont forget the REM teams need their skill ups too
PuzzleAndDragons,3duqbk,ShakingTowers,3,Sun Jul 19 18:43:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's what he meant, more like anyone that can farm scarlet is probably over rank 350 anyway."
PuzzleAndDragons,3duqbk,mytherrus,3,Sun Jul 19 19:17:05 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the difficulty of farming that dungeon enough to get 50 skill ups (so about 205 times during 2.5x skill ups assuming 100% success rate) plus the evo materials, which if I recall involves DQ Hera-Ur, which is 3 red jewels apiece (don't remember what else Scarlet needs and PDX doesn't seem to have it...).  So yeah, let's say the stones/stamina are not an issue, you're still probably rank 350 already or pretty close if you can do all of that."
PuzzleAndDragons,3duqbk,ShakingTowers,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:27:00 2015 UTC,it would probably be more efficient to max level all of them and feed for guaranteed skillup.
PuzzleAndDragons,3duqbk,mytherrus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:22:51 2015 UTC,"IIRC the guaranteed skill up only works with ultimate evolutions. If that's true, it means that you have to evolve AND max level them, which requires you to get 50 Heras, 50 Hera-Urs, and 250 spirit jewels (3 for Ur and 2 for Scarlet per skill up). I get the feeling that is NOT more efficient than farming Scarlet ~200 times."

PuzzleAndDragons,3dv8tt,Cielbunneh,14,Sun Jul 19 20:21:05 2015 UTC,Yeeeee team UY in the house!
PuzzleAndDragons,3dv8tt,Nugur,11,Sun Jul 19 20:25:59 2015 UTC,"HAHA I KNEW IT  UY BEST QUADCOLOR  (jk i can't pull kali and feel sad when I see all my uy friends slowly becoming her)  Kali still has a bunch of benefits, like the time extend, skill bind resist, skill boost, built-in guaranteed activation active, unresisted light damage, and waifu art. UY, of all the quadcolors, can probably build the most damage-intensive mono-color focus team. For this, though, he loses time extends, the skill bind resist, and the unresisted damage (I cry when I get green spawns). Durga's easier activation is nothing to cough at. I plan to farm with my Durga in the future, and she has an excellent farmable sub pool, as does Kirin.  UY is the only quadcolor that's not light or dark, the only quadcolor without a time extend, and the only quadcolor that does not have a leader skill update that increases damage beyond 25x or eases activation. They are, however, the only quadcolor that stacks both orb enhance and TPA.  My team sits happily at 7 enhanced blue orbs awakenings. It'd be 8 if I pulled my white whale, Sun Quan.   I also have a planned Sarasvasti team that I can't wait to rock that also has 7 orb enhances.  I hear debate about the real value of orb enhance all the time but I think it's a force to reckon with, especially when it stacks as naturally as it does with egypt 2/UY leads.  in conclusion I BELIEVE IN THE SPARKLE META and GO TEAM UY"
PuzzleAndDragons,3dv8tt,Sunjuan,3,Sun Jul 19 21:04:12 2015 UTC,"Yah, I was only referring to potential damage output, in which U&Y has an edge. But light kali's utility is just too op, so overall I think she is still the best 5x lead lol. (Though some recent dungeons are quite anti light and dark teams).

PuzzleAndDragons,3dv8tt,Sunjuan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:15:54 2015 UTC,Two Blodins is a little overkill imo because then you have two actives of orb enhance and they have a long cooldown. Something with more utility should take priority over the second blodin.

Full board changers are pretty necessary, and the bind recovery and jazzhands are appreciated.   Also, blodin doesn't benefit from SQ's boost, so might as well replace him for utility."

Every time i match natural light orbs, the damage is x1.67 for tpa, and 1.59 for 3 match.  I have 7 light enhance awakening.  The x1.59 plus minimum activation shot my damage to above 100k light, which causes problems on sphinx, as sopdet's dark half would absorb that damage.

PuzzleAndDragons,3dv8tt,Crescive,3,Mon Jul 20 08:34:12 2015 UTC,I noticed this with Awoken Horus. With 6 orb enhances you do more damage than F/L even with a lower multiplier. The burst is insane on a fire heavy team too.
PuzzleAndDragons,3dv8tt,Vallard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:33:04 2015 UTC,"Yup, same as hathor really, 4.5 x 4.5 x 1.5 extra = 30x compared to l/f's 25x. Really I feel orb enhance is even more powerful in mono colour teams. The only thing is that those teams usually have all their attention focused on rows and tpas."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dv8tt,Ploxzx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:45:23 2015 UTC,Rows and tpas generally require matching while orb enhances just work under the hood though so most people definitely pay less attention to stuff that they don't have to work for in dungeons
PuzzleAndDragons,3dv8tt,An00bis-,2,Mon Jul 20 01:15:13 2015 UTC,I have a max skilled Ars Paulina and she does a lot of work on my Nut and U&Y teams. While I do have Muse I prefer the grimoire for her lower cd and ability to slightly fix bad Karin/Famiel actives. Depending the amount of orbs I find the damage comparable to using a type enhancer.
PuzzleAndDragons,3dv8tt,ElectricLeo,3,Sun Jul 19 22:31:15 2015 UTC,Interesting. This means that Sakuya gets a good amount of damage from orb enhances since 2x Sakuya+uuvo Valk = 6 enhances alone.
PuzzleAndDragons,3dv8tt,ElectricLeo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:10:51 2015 UTC,"Yah, and since 5-6 orb enhance is adequate for the bonus damage you don't need to worry about it for her other subs.

PuzzleAndDragons,3dv8tt,Calamitymkii,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:42:29 2015 UTC,"What is the ""new orb enhance""? I must have been drunk when it was announced. I was going to run A Bastet / Vish / Vish / Awoken MeiMei / Kush when the evos are released in NA and that would give I think 5 orb enhance off the top of my head. Are you saying Vish will be EVEN MORE POWERFUL?  Can't wait. Thanks for your work!"
PuzzleAndDragons,3dv8tt,znredra,2,Sun Jul 19 23:09:02 2015 UTC,"Yah, they buffed orb enhance a while back. Basically the new calculation is: (1+0.06a)*(1+0.05b) where   a = the number of enhanced orbs in the combo   b = the number of orb enhance awakenings in you entire team  So take your bastet team for example, everyone has one green orb enhance thus (1+0.06a)*(1+0.05(6))  So 3 orb green combos gets you (1+0.06(3))*1.3 = 1.534x more damage  One set of green rows gets you (1+0.06(6))*1.3 = 1.768x more damage   One or multiple sets of TPA combo gets (1+0.06(4))*1.3 = 1.612x more deeps on top of the tpa damage so yahh....  Edit: calculation, extra sets of combo and prongs don't increase otb enhance multiplier. Ie. 1 prongs = 1.612x, 2 prongs still = 1.612x"
PuzzleAndDragons,3dv8tt,Michmich455,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:26:28 2015 UTC,Thanks! I appreciate taking the time to do the math.

PuzzleAndDragons,3dv8tt,DrunkLightning,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:10:59 2015 UTC,"For the two sets of green combo, how are you doing the math?  If you mean 1 combo of 6 orbs, then you are correct.  If you mean two separate combos of 3 orbs, then each combo is still 1.534x that applies only to that particular combo."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dv8tt,DrunkLightning,2,Mon Jul 20 11:30:44 2015 UTC,"Ah, you're right. Just tested it out with my U&Y team. I misinterpreted the formula. Two sets of blue is still 1.534x and twos sets of prong is 1.612x. Huh, that really sucks, that means extra combos or prongs won't provide incremental orb enhance damage. :0   Thanks for pointing it out!"

PuzzleAndDragons,3dv8tt,ta11geese3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:38:22 2015 UTC,Its something you have to factor it in as its part of the design of each individual monsters. having an x25++ isn't really that impressive if you naturally hit for peanuts.
PuzzleAndDragons,3dv8tt,Seivyr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:45:04 2015 UTC,"Yahhh, but then you can argue U&Y team has more two prongs thus higher damage and much better rcv...the cycle never ends lol. All this still doesn't change the fact that Durga currently has the lowest potential mutiplier of all the 5x leads right now.   I'm not saying which lead is the overall best, I'm merely pointing out the numbers. And quite frankly unless you're a mega whale with all the optimal subs, deciding which lead is ""the best"" is impractical. You play the best you can with what RNGesus gives you. Even then different teams benefit from different dungeons."

PuzzleAndDragons,3dxsd6,red_cactus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:56:49 2015 UTC,"Ronia, Ronia, King Baddie, Persephone, Flex. Pair with another Ronia.  You usually want at least one King Baddie for that 3x damage mult. Two Marvelous Red Dragon Caller Sonia's can get a 9x base mult (2.5x plus two 1.2x for a 6x combo which isn't too hard to pull off). When you use her active you can reliably get 4-5 rows for row mults, plus the 3x from King Baddie, plus any orb enhance awakenings you have. It's not unheard of to get a 30-40x mult, spread over two colors with a full board attacking combo. If you had a Lu Bu you could swap him out for King Baddie, his lower mult is compensated for by his much better stats and awakenings.  It won't quite match what other endgame leads like Bestcat or LKali can do, but it's much more reliable and safer. Ronia makes a fantastic farming lead - if you can clear a dungeon once with her, you can almost always clear it again."

PuzzleAndDragons,3dwxrg,Sunjuan,2,Mon Jul 20 18:07:37 2015 UTC,"Famiel is a newer god so it's hard to find people with her. I would suggest also asking for other similar leads in the future :) You can get more requests that way. Good similar leads that buff healers are Lmeta, any of the Valkyries, maybe Athena if you have a decent amount of God/Healer cards on your team, and Light Zhuge Liang (note that his leader skill only works when your HP is full). If your team is blue-heavy also consider asking for Skuld friends.  If you're a decent comboer and have someone with a dark sub att on your team, also consider using Umisachi&Yamasachi as a friend. They give 5x attack if you match water/wood/light/dark, and Famiel's active skill conveniently changes the whole board to those colors. If you ever pull a UY yourself, you will find that Famiel is an excellent sub for them :)"

LZL might be a good pick for me though  I actually run UY as a sub because I'm not confident I can match the 4 consistently, I find Famiel to be a pretty low risk high reward if you have the right subs for her"
PuzzleAndDragons,3dvecv,Amphora_PAD,8,Sun Jul 19 21:08:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, the music is fine.  I think you talk for the perfect amount of time.  Maybe talk about what are some of the toughest parts of the dungeon, and the advantages/disadvantages that your team will have in the dungeon. Also talk about how many tries it took/how many plus eggs you have, because I know when I see someone use a team similar to mine I'm curious to know if my shoddy plus egg count is enough.  I personally don't like text commentary, although I know some others do.  Don't go mainstream!! I like seeing different leads clear things, instead of feeling trapped, like ""alright I guess this dungeon is so tough only awoken Ra can clear it, so a pleb like me doesn't have a chance""   For team composition suggestions, idk what to say unless I see your box, but in general I like teams that are a little funkier than normal. It's interesting to see people get creative with teams. I remember I saw a clear once of one of the challenge dungeons (I think it was level 8, no RCV) with a UY lead and a LL Ra friend. It confused me for most of the dungeon run, because I thought it was stupid to bring LL Ra instead of LD, and I also wondered why they hadn't just used a UY friend. Turns out they used Ra's active for one high def low HP floor (perhaps an enemy Ra, I don't remember), and then they used a heartmaker on the last floor to activate Ra's leader skill. It was a pretty janky team but I enjoyed it :) I like a change of pace, I guess, because seeing clears with perfect ideal teams gets tiring. I know perfect ideal teams are good, that's why they're perfect and ideal."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dvecv,Sunjuan,2,Sun Jul 19 21:35:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the long and thought out reply. I'll try out some other team pairings in the future, I agree it's fun to see those.

Anyhow. While I understand you'll be doing a lot of actual clears. I do hope you'll also cater to the audience like myself who enjoys seeing non-mainstream teams. Ra is fun and all, but there'll be a crapton of videos of him doing the same thing across all of them.   I particularly like the YouTube channels who use obscure teams to clear content. Such as a Row oriented Nut team, or TPA Neph. Even that one screenshot of Artemis x Something was making me hungry for a video about it to just see what difficulty a team setup like that would bring in order to still get success.   We all know Ra can and will clear 99% of the content, and luckily your commentary keeps it interesting despite it being a Ra video. Part of what makes Reco's streams fun to watch is his use of Anubis.   As for commentary, reasons for team picks and explaining the boss mechanics and why you're stallig or chipping on a certain floor is always good to know and interesting to listen to. Also don't be afraid to mention me every now and then as the greatest person who has ever lived. We both know that's a fact!   All-in-all you're doing a great job already and I'll surely miss the Santa Sakuya videos, as I truly associate her with you.

Never go into medjed blind T_T)   I swear I fell asleep watching 3 text commentary videos just today on youtube (To be fair they were in Japanese and I don't understand that and they were all bastet/ra stuff)  Honestly, my favorite clears tend to be the half/no rem teams (ie. less than 3 rem only things in a team. I'm sure you have the skill for it :D). To be fair though, any sort of unorthodox team would be amazing. For instance, your Kali/Kirin video."

PuzzleAndDragons,3dvecv,W2T,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:14:53 2015 UTC,"Music is fine.  You speak well, in the sense that you speak when you need too. When there is a lull in conversation/music or you make a strange play you speak up. Good job.  I personally think talking out your thought process but not your orb process should be done more. For instance saying something along the lines of. (Ok, my board isn't activatable but I need to kill this floor now. And if I use Kali now it will be available when I'm on floor 8 when I need more burst because X happens)  I personally don't like txt commentary, especially for a game like this were im trying to watch your movements on screen.  For team comp we are getting a huge influx of Awoken Egyptians. So aside from Anubis (which is always fun) I would say steer away from that.   Your a great player so people will watch you play, but we have seen tons of LKali/Egypt clears lately. If it's not something really difficult, do it with a team that's still in meta but with less exposure (Lakshmi, Durga, Hathor etc)  Also a fun idea I have wanted to see would be a ""race"" for example say you and Chase both go into a C9/10. Put the screens side by side and see who clears first. You would have to do two different races though so you both get traffic to your vid.  Lastly I think you are the only one that does much Santa Kirin. it's kind of your calling card. Idk if you are worried about Stam but maybe for the really hard things do 2 videos or maybe put both runs on screen for a side by side a Sanata and then a X clear."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dvecv,DrOrganicSwagPHD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:44:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you as well for the thoughtful response. The race idea is interesting - I've seen reco do it with someone else, and it was entertaining to watch. The outcomes rely a lot on luck though, especially with combo and color teams.  The 2 clear videos side by side idea is fun - I've had someone else suggest this to me before, and I might try it out next time. The only concern I have is that it might be distracting and hard for viewers to follow, since both screens will be running at the same time."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dvecv,DrOrganicSwagPHD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:57:57 2015 UTC,There are a lot of twists you could do with a dual screen layout.  Flip back and forth after each turn. Pause a side after floor clear to catch up. Have a timer or turn counter to measure which team took longer. Do a Farmable team Vs a Rem team. Fire v water/gods v Devils. Or Santa Kirin Vs the Fotm team.

Shinrabansho will come back around sooner than we think, since JP recently had a preview announcement that announced Asmodeus getting an ultimate evolution, most likely will coincide with another Shinrabansho collab. Also, how often do you use two Dragon Riders on the same team? Missing that skill up will probably not affect what you're able to clear and such a trivial skill up is not worth wasting a Pii compared to awoken ults and the like."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dx5kv,iamarocketsfan,2,Mon Jul 20 07:12:07 2015 UTC,"Definitely lakshmi! Shes an s tier lead in japan. She has crazy burst, strong rcv, and decent hp (between 20-28k at hypermax). Team will be lakshmi/karin/amberjack/andromeda/flex. Flex can be either blodin for stats or andromeda for more orb change. If you can get ahold of a baggi then you can destroy pretty much everything."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dx5kv,ILoveToSayFuck,2,Mon Jul 20 14:49:14 2015 UTC,Tbh ALak/Andro/Andro/Hatsu/BOdin/ALak.  This team would wreck lol. However all your orb changers need to be skilled for it to be effective  EDIT: Just read that you arent keen on skilling peeps up. Most of the blue teams that you can make are only effective with skill ups. My Andro team (which you can make) is Andro/BOdin/Karin/Hatsu/Reine/Andro. All of my monsters are max skilled besides BOdin. You have awesome blue monsters and you can make a crap ton of teams but they will only be good if skilled up :/   TL; DR: Skill up monsters for op teams!!!!
PuzzleAndDragons,3dx5kv,Shiefu,2,Mon Jul 20 16:58:29 2015 UTC,"If he really doesnt want to skill up, i guess op could run Blonia/blonia/blodin/blodin/bubblie. Also a killer team with like 10 skill boosts and 8 rows, and insane hp and rcv."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dx5kv,ILoveToSayFuck,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:12:40 2015 UTC,"I may have phrased things incorrectly. Really, I want to make a team that can work effectively before skillups. Because skillups take much longer than everything else, especially since Lakshmi requires piis and Andromeda requires those godawful evolved fodders. But I'd like the team to at least be able to take on slightly lower content even before I can max things out.   Currently I have a fire farming team (Urd) and my main green focus has Parvati/Bastet/Verdandi for various types of dungeons. I want a water team to complement them. So for example, I'd want to use my water team to only run fire dungeons (Zeus Vulcan perhaps?) or something like that. And preferably this can be done before I've maxed everyone out, which may take weeks or more.  So it's more of a team that isn't reliant on orb changers all the time, the way I've heard Hero teams pretty much have to."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dx5kv,Shiefu,2,Tue Jul 21 01:41:32 2015 UTC,"I see. I think you should stick to urd, parvati and maybe just skill up blue along the way. Because there arent many descend capable teams that you can make without skilled orb changers. Lakshmi can still kinda work if you have like 3 andro and a hatsu. If you are struggling with fire based descends, i duggest you invest in a spike team such as A.Ra, Durga or LKali because those teams dont rely on skilled pets as much. I cant be sure if you have these leads or subs though."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dx5kv,ILoveToSayFuck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:39:50 2015 UTC,"This probably looks best for now. I don't have Baggi, but I'll probably use Phoenix Rider as off-color shield if necessary.  Do you think it's worth grinding for piis by getting Awoken Karin instead of I presume B/D one?"
PuzzleAndDragons,3dx5kv,Crescive,2,Tue Jul 21 01:57:05 2015 UTC,"Lakshmi to be most efficient will need to be skilled up, but because she has so much rcv, shes pretty easy to stall with. I would definitely get awoken karin when you can as your burst will be better. Run a blodin in your flex spot for pii farming as his 3 tpa will take out piis easier. For 10 floor dungeons you will be okay without skillups just stall."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dx5kv,Sunjuan,2,Tue Jul 21 03:11:55 2015 UTC,"Lakshmi is your best bet for a team that is not as dependent on skills being up all the time with her naturally high hp, rcv boost, and 6.25x unconditional leader skill.  Sarasvati and Andromeda are very orb-hungry and absolutely dependent on skill ups. Sarasvati more-so, I don't think she's worth using without both your lead and friend being max skilled.  Andromeda should be the #1 priority for skill ups as she's probably the best all-around blue sub. Using pii's on Andromeda is perfectly fine considering how useful her active is/how shitty fairies are. Lakshmi's active isn't nearly as important as Andromeda's."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dx5kv,Sunjuan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:05:53 2015 UTC,"Saras/Hatsume/reine/blodin/Karin imo. 7 rows, some tpa, 2 5 turn orb changers, a haste board wipe. Sarasvati seems the most powerful and flexible to me out of those three leaders. Maybe it's personal bias because she's the only one I have. Also, Saras and Andro both rely on skilled orb changers. Lakshmi maybe not as much but you'd still have to skill things if you want true endgame potential. Skilling sucks but it's gotta be done."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dx5kv,Sunjuan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:21:14 2015 UTC,"I will max Hatsume pretty soon with the water survey dungeon coming up. Reine is at lv2 and I’ll need to wait for Poring Tower again. But otherwise how would you prioritize Sara vs. Andro and kind of the minimum skillups before I can at least start using them? Unless I really whale these are going to be long term projects. Karin is also an issue since if I make her the Awoken version it’s going to be all about piis. I understand the need for lots of water orbs all the time, but do they all have to maxed?"
PuzzleAndDragons,3dx5kv,Sunjuan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:55:25 2015 UTC,"IDK what the minimum skill levels are or anything, sorry :/ And yeah I have a long term Saras project on the side too.   There's an update that will make jewels skill up Awoken Chinese, so you could farm those instead of piis. Still a huge pain in the butt, yea.   Saras vs Andro is your choice really I guess.

PuzzleAndDragons,3dwhxl,Altiondsols,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:14:57 2015 UTC,It seems like he used his stones to continue instead of rem pulls. The only interesting monsters can all be gotten from the pem during evo mats carnival. He should take the account as a learning experience and restart if he wants to get even a little bit serious
PuzzleAndDragons,3dwhxl,-123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:38:16 2015 UTC,That sounds about right.  Continues and stamina refreshes probably cover everything outside of the four REM pulls and the box expansions.

PuzzleAndDragons,3dwhxl,yolloswaggins,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:29:21 2015 UTC,"If you're not going to reroll then the best team I see for you is a mono-red team. Its basic members drop from normal dungeons (titan, naga, eventually mystic fire knight) but it will be a painful process as the rates are low.  Lead with Tyrannos and pair with Ares for a team with decent HP and attack but poor rcv. Lead with the elemental and pair with another elemental for a grinding team. These both have limited use but with enough levels you can get your red team to clear the weekly expert dungeons."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dwhxl,-123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:32:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly the time farming for those monsters (titan, naga, mystic fire knight) is going to be way longer than rerolling."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dwhxl,yolloswaggins,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:09:13 2015 UTC,"True, but farming a mono red team or farming a vampire or saving stones to roll during a godfest are pretty much his only non rerolling options."

PuzzleAndDragons,3dwhxl,Nugur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:40:29 2015 UTC,Feed the dark metal dragon to any dark monster you're using. The metal dungeon is fairly easy so those dragon can be obtained easily.
PuzzleAndDragons,3dwhxl,arkain123,0,Mon Jul 20 03:04:25 2015 UTC,"That stone you're holding on to? That should be devoted to increasing your box size. And so should every stone you get your hands on until you're sitting on your rankX2 space (more or less)  Now. All the metal/jewel dragons can be fed away, you'll get tons of them. Keep all the evo materials, you have some really good ones, and even the crappy ones will be useful at some point.  The non evo dragons are all relatively crappy even when fully evo'd, the fairies are all relatively easy to get and skill up for very specific monsters."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dwhxl,DimmiDongus,8,Mon Jul 20 03:36:50 2015 UTC,"I heavily disagree for this one.  OP is in serious need of a real leader and subs fast, and should save stones to roll in next godfest. Rerolling is the better option but Op wants to stay on this account he really needs to get good gods fast.  Also the amount of box space he had is fine,  there's a lot of stuff unneeded like the metal dragons.   OP if you read this, reroll. You get through the game 3x faster with a good god.

PuzzleAndDragons,3dvw6y,tikigodbob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:44:00 2015 UTC,The weekend dungeon gives 2x coins during  events. If you run it with a ganesha friend you get double the coins.
PuzzleAndDragons,3dvw6y,OsitoDeOjosAzules,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:48:04 2015 UTC,I knew that but i wasnt sure if thats what he was running or on what level. Seeing as ganesha is a light card.

PuzzleAndDragons,3dvw6y,tikigodbob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:57:14 2015 UTC,Means the orbs so the whole dungeon is rbg. Personally I run legend with a ganesha but master will still net you 1 mil or so? So it's not bad if you can't do legend yet. Have you done the tri color dungeons at the bottom of the challenge dungeon? It ends today and they are generally pretty easy (first three only) so give them a shot! I think It green dark blue

PuzzleAndDragons,3dvw6y,kittyPowersupply,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:44:33 2015 UTC,It'd be the 40 stamina weekend dungeon.  You would generally run that with one ganesha friend along with a combo lead like kushi or anubis or Bastet.  One run will get you around 1.8m coins (when there's an event on).
PuzzleAndDragons,3dvw6y,mytherrus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:50:43 2015 UTC,"Just the tricoloured weekend dungeons for coins. Coins are super important in the end game when you're farming dungeons that need you to pay coins to open them. And even lvl 1 is worth it because you only care about the leader skill. Ganesha does no damage in the weekend dungeons anyway.   You could grab some nice high level friends with your weekend Ganesh I bet. I would post your ID in a thread telling everyone you make it your leader on the weekends. Do you know how to make it your leader on your friends list? Just assign him to one of your leader slots and make sure that's the team that's on screen when you leave the team edit page. Or make it the leader of team slot 1? I can't remember, sorry.

PuzzleAndDragons,3dwr9s,zably,2,Mon Jul 20 05:01:52 2015 UTC,"The ""pow"" stands for ""power"" and does more damage than the safe combo, but the cascade can get interrupted by skyfalls (if orbs of the same color come down in the wrong place they can match things early, so you don't get as many combos as you thought).  The safe version is the board that is more reliable, and will more often (many are 100%) hit the stated number of combos."

PuzzleAndDragons,3du0aa,frucknog,3,Sun Jul 19 21:02:32 2015 UTC,Seconded. Tera Battle is the PaD mechanic with locked tiles and it is not fun rearranging the board around locked tiles at all.
PuzzleAndDragons,3du0aa,ElectricLeo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:51:37 2015 UTC,It probably just prevents locked orbs from bring picked up/moved while still allowing them to be used for combos.
PuzzleAndDragons,3du0aa,PaPa_ZeuS,10,Sun Jul 19 23:44:31 2015 UTC,"Interesting, wonder if it'll mean that the orb cannot be moved or that it cannot be changed (or both).   GungHo continues to impress me with the tweaks and changes they make like the rogue style dungeons, the new 7x6 etc. boards, the MP and latent awakening system and now this. They're succeeding at keeping PAD fresh and interesting for me."
PuzzleAndDragons,3du0aa,Machius-sama,2,Sun Jul 19 13:43:58 2015 UTC,"They have been screwing up a bit though.  MP is nice but it will become mostly irrelevant fairly soon, only players actually buying anything from it are those with unlimited in-game resources so they will get everything they can in no time. People with little resources won't really buy anything because investment is just TOO big and is only worth doing on teams you have perfect subs for, then again most players with little resources don't have that. Even if they do, getting ideal latent awakenings is just too expensive and not likely to attain for the time being.  Furthermore, since the MP is subject to change and we do not know how events are gonna work, unless you don't have any kind of resource limit you're better off waiting for some event or tweak.  Then again other latest addition was the new ""cross shield mechanic"", a complete failure. Other of the new additions were rogue dungeons which are garbage and most people do not like anyways because the whole idea is dumb and designed so you will fail pretty much because you do not know what's your HP on each floor (meaning you can't really plan for it) and same happens with your damage (you are used to hit for like 7m with a proper burst, then again you have no idea what your damage would be with a lvl 50 team with a few +eggs)."
PuzzleAndDragons,3du0aa,iLambdadelta,3,Sun Jul 19 16:40:48 2015 UTC,"Different people different opinions I guess. I've not been a huge fan of everything they've been doing but most of it has been satisfyingly interesting at least. I actual really like both the cross shield and the rogue dungeons (and haven't seen too much negativity about either of them) they could have been done better and I personally find the skill requirements difficult but I like the creativity they represent as opposed to being ""just another stat modifying leader skill"" or ""just another difficult dungeon"".  On the MP thing whales will always work on a differently level and at a different pace but for the rest of us latent awakenings are just the next progression from Hypermaxing. Even non-IAP players if they want to will eventually be able fully latent awaken their favorite monsters just from REM dupes."
PuzzleAndDragons,3du0aa,Machius-sama,-1,Sun Jul 19 17:37:53 2015 UTC,"Do you play JP? Most JP players I talk with just loathe the whole rogue idea because it's just bad, doesn't add much to the game play, dungeon is harder depending on what you run (this isn't a bad thing) and because you don't know your stats. You will never expect to fail to one-shot a 2m HP enemy with Ra's x100, but you will get that happen in rogue dungeons because lvl 10 team.  As I said about MP, no, it works mostly for whales/very heavy IAP. For non-IAP or light-IAP it is mostly irrelevant, prices are too high and commitment is just too big. Unless you get many GFE dupes, specifically L.Meta or GOdin then you won't get too many points.  Problem is even when you will be able to ""hyper max a team with latent awakenings"" in the far future, commitment is just WAY TOO BIG for a non-IAP player. Say you had your SQ fully awoken with the new stuff, then Isis came out so your ideal Ra team changed... that's something you cannot afford to happen as non-IAP, especially because you have so little points.  It is something to work towards on, maybe do it on your lead only and some specific versatile subs, but that's it really, it is nice but too costly for light players so it doesn't really add anything new.  Not saying new content is bad, just saying it doesn't really add that much to the game, for me and some friends the MP has been mostly a new button that enables us to have helpers with 5 time extends, but that's it really. Then rogue dungeons are about getting one-shot because you thought you were gonna be able to tank that hit in F4 or because you failed to one-shot because your team is lvl 30."
PuzzleAndDragons,3du0aa,iLambdadelta,3,Sun Jul 19 20:14:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can't anticipate your team's power throughout the dungeon, but that's limited to the first few runs in Zaerog. The latter legend dungeon follows similar trends.  IMO it's not the problem on ""you can't estimate your team HP and damage because my team is at level 10."" If you think about the whole idea behind legend dungeon - low cost monsters level faster - meaning it's your decision to bring a high cost subs (like GF-onlys) and you know he's not going to level up. If your GF-only is at level 30, your normal subs (cost 30-35) are probably at level 80-90.  Secondly you are also expected to bring shields or use HP/RCV multiplied leads because the damage are supposed one shot normal teams no matter the levels you are at because usually the damage are set where you can only tank those hits at max level. Don't forget it's a Legend+ dungeons just like all rushes, it's not supposed to be done with ""new"" players still struggling in no-stoneing Zeus Vulcan (just a metaphor).  On the MP shop - they still have a minimal impart to the game. They tried hard to minimize the idea of ""IAP and you win"". People are just getting too crazy seeing teams of youtubers loaded with full X awoken."
PuzzleAndDragons,3du0aa,iLambdadelta,-2,Mon Jul 20 01:54:57 2015 UTC,"Do you actually play JP and follow the community? Nobody gives a damn about cost because the strongest teams are still the strongest. Latest descend, Scarlet, hardest so far, best teams for farming it are like Shiva Dragon (99 cost), Awoken Shiva, Awoken Ra and obviously Cloud system, all high cost other than Cloud.  Dungeon being rogue has nothing to do with bringing HP/RCV mults or anything lol level is adjusted to the fact that it is rogue so some bosses hit a lot less. As I said above, people run the dungeon as if it wasn't rogue, it's not worth building a team around ""cost""."
PuzzleAndDragons,3du0aa,astalotte,3,Mon Jul 20 05:53:07 2015 UTC,"stop talking about rogue dungeons as if only megawhales like black☆mist, 理事長, kosuke etc. are running them. not everyone can afford such teams to begin with."
PuzzleAndDragons,3du0aa,iLambdadelta,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:26:14 2015 UTC,"Lol man any ok player can clear all those new rogue dungeons, I have cleared all of them already without much difficulty other than Scarlet, if you do not have the best leads in the game with good subs or just happen to be able to build some cheesy team that for some reason works you cannot even aspire to clear it.  What does your post have anything to do with what I said though...  Btw, I'm non-IAP and have most of the teams I mentioned lol."
PuzzleAndDragons,3du0aa,astalotte,3,Tue Jul 21 01:38:03 2015 UTC,"I'm saying that not everyone has the ideal teams such that they don't need to care about cost. I can't run the A.Ra speedrun team for Nordis because I don't have A.Isis and Lu Bu. I can't run the Shiva Dragon speedrun team for Scarlet because I don't have 3 Ares, and I've spent almost 2000 USD on this game.   That's what I'm talking about. Everyone has a different box. Using the smallest demographic to make your argument is stupid. If you're non-IAP and have most of the teams you mentioned more power to you, but you don't represent the majority"
PuzzleAndDragons,3du0aa,Machius-sama,3,Tue Jul 21 03:09:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, I am exclusively JP (for well over a year now), it's in my flair details.  I don't know how many JP players you talk to because I find the opposite (and I live in JP and have a decent sized group of PAD playing friends - both Japanese and foreigners like me) - people tend to be ""whoa that looks crazy, but still pretty cool"". fether makes my main points for me - it is somewhat controllable (you can alter your team to suit) and it is also a Legend+ dungeon (super end game content, aka. supposed to be difficult, aka. you can rarely get away with tanking it tends to be ""OneShot or be OneShotted"").  Being non-IAP is all about those choices you mention, investing in max skills, investing in max plus eggs and now investing in max latent awakenings is always going to be a long term project and it's always going to be potentially risky if a new better sub (that you have access to) turns up.   I doubt many people outside of superwhales will have fully latent awoken teams (pretty much the same deal as fully hypermaxed teams), for most of us it'll be about having a hyper + latent awoken leader and that's plenty (an extra 0.5 seconds if both you and a friend has maxed out on time extends is great for combo/rainbow leads or an extra 10% dark resist between the 2 leads is pretty good too etc. etc.). It doesn't need to be more than that, I can now somewhat customise my lead (and in doing so, at least for a while I can stand out from most of the others on my friends list).  For me while the new content recently isn't huge, and much of it requires teams/skills beyond where I feel I am, I still like the fact that it adds some small interesting things to the game, it's the game I enjoy but with a few extra things that keep it from getting too ""same old, same old""."
PuzzleAndDragons,3du0aa,iLambdadelta,-1,Mon Jul 20 02:34:59 2015 UTC,"Thing with rogue dungeons is you just don't know your stats so it is common to fail due to lack of knowledge, and the only way you can try this is by giving it a shot. The fact that you sometimes fail to one-shot because you ignore what your damage actually is kind of sucks too. New mechanic doesn't change game-play at all, it just buffs some collab cards and the new Sonias because low cost but that's it, people still run the same teams as ever and play them the same way... bosses even get slightly nerfed to adjust to the fact dungeon is rogue (DQ Hera comes to mind). It's a new ""mechanic"" that doesn't actually do anything other than make you know less things about your team, which you can actually know if you go and watch YT videos (so you know what level each monster will be per floor) and then take out a calculator and calculate your damage every turn. It's just annoying.  Thing with the MP is they can play around it, add new things, make event, it can potentially keep things fresh, but for the time being it adds very little to the game, light players can't really risk it at all. I'm not even sure if time extends are worth it at all, I'd personally spam some dark resists."
PuzzleAndDragons,3du0aa,Machius-sama,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:50:19 2015 UTC,"I guess it all comes down to what type of player you are. If you are hyper analytical and like to constantly be in control (like you seem to) then yes, I can understand how the rogue dungeons could seem incredibly annoying and somewhat scary. If however you enjoy a bit of randomness and being able to overcome through extra effort/practice (like I do) then the rogue dungeons are actually quite an interesting thing. Something worth aspiring to defeat. People still run the same teams because those teams are good and they are what they have access too (a person with top tier hypermaxed team will obviously use that regardless), but for the rest of us some slight tweaking of subs to take advantage of the faster growth rates (and get rid of the slower growth rates) can make a major difference.   MP is what it is, in future it will probably bring more (there are still a few untouched elements of the original rogue dungeon navitama concept and a set of monsters like Shiva Dragon (one for each element) seems fairly likely). Like everything else in the game players will come to it from their own perspectives, if by ""light players"" you mean casual non-IAP - light IAP players, they will be fine, those players tend to be into the game just for some time killing fun and are less likely to see things in terms of being a ""risk"", if they can afford it they'll go ahead and add the latent awakenings to their favourite lead because that's what is important/fun for them and if things change they'll save up for whatever new thing they want.  By the way are you a JP player? You keep asking people but it feels like you are just getting your info from some YT stuff and don't have any personal experience with the actual mechanics involved or the JP community. I mean i've heard from some people who aren't fans of these mechanics but your level of negativity towards them is a first."
PuzzleAndDragons,3du0aa,iLambdadelta,-2,Mon Jul 20 06:53:42 2015 UTC,"You just summed it up in one word, randomness, I do not like that, it's a game-ruining factor in my eyes. It is inherent to PAD, I did learn to deal with it but rogue dungeons take it even further which is bad in my eyes.  You'd me surprised. I've spent under $100 in the game and are over rank 400... also know plenty of players around the same rank (which is where you kind of get stuck because exp curve + no dungeon you can spam to get fast ranks).  Yes, I play in JP. I am just too dramatic, you could include me in the ""not a fan"" category, it's just a softer way of saying ""people who don't like it"". From an objective point of view system so far, as I explained, adds nothing to the game other than confusing dungeons where, as I explained, you will keep failing because you lack information, which you can obviously get yet is a complete pain in the ass to do.  Scarlet, Nordis and Infinirog are very nice dungeons, but honestly Nordis and Zaerog just have trash floors so you can level up your stuff (thus making the dungeon quite worse, really trash floors are just...) but then dungeon gets nicer. Scarlet is very challenging and could be even better if it didn't involve the whole rogue mechanic. Many of my failed runs happened because I either over-estimated my damage or my HP, as in ""ok then I should be able to stall next floor"", suddenly nope, same happens when going for the one shot, ""enemy has 2m HP shouldn't be too hard, I'll just save some orbs"", then nope he survives enrages and kills. Also the fact that +eggs are so important on these since they are not affected by monster's level is a clear design fault. It is just some poorly thought mechanic that got thrown into the game because they had already worked on it (and dropped the original idea because after like 4 months they realized it was gonna be game breaking) so they wanted to use it. I still haven't really heard about people that love the fact that a dungeon is rogue, it's either people disliking it or just not caring."
PuzzleAndDragons,3du0aa,Machius-sama,2,Mon Jul 20 07:50:32 2015 UTC,"Rogue dungeons are a hard thing to love, mainly because they are so difficult. We also don't hear people saying that they love Yamato Rush, or they love the Technical Pii dungeon or Challenge Lv10s. I do however hear how people appreciate their existence, the challenge they represent and the fact that they are something different from the usual PAD descends. And that's my position too, rogue dungeons are pretty nightmarish, but the bosses are cool, the feel of running them is different and they provide a challenge for people to aspire too. End game content, end game challenges and rewards that are (at least partially) end game relevant.   For me it all comes down to the fact that I enjoy PAD and that anything that adds variation and new challenges to PAD (no matter how small or how annoyingly difficult it may be) I feel is a good thing."
PuzzleAndDragons,3du0aa,iLambdadelta,-1,Mon Jul 20 08:37:01 2015 UTC,"Zaerog is not hard... Nordis is kind of troll but not very hard with adequate teams, Scarlet is a bitch but not because it is rogue but because dungeon is designed so you get one-shot on most floors and stalling is almost impossible unless +eggs, I'd prefer them to boost boss stats instead of making it rogue and nerfing bosses while also randomly nerfing my team, I like knowing my stats.  Then again Technical Pii is awful because it's full of RNG (as in you don't even know what bosses you are gonna face which sucks, very few teams can actually run it ""consistently""). C10 is usually nice imo and Yamato Rush is about +eggs so you can tank Goemon's pre-emptive, as in teams like Lakshmi can stomp through the dungeon if you got Baggi or full hyper-max so you can tank Goemon's hit, which is why the dungeon is kind of meh, it's all about some HP thresholds."

PuzzleAndDragons,3dvrgy,CuteGayDragon,2,Mon Jul 20 00:06:07 2015 UTC,"Let's put it this way, if you're good enough at the game or you work on orb matching skills, asmodeus another should be able to take you through around 80-90% of the content in the game even if she doesn't scale as well as some of the leads that we prefer to recommend to new players. She is pretty darned tough to use when starting out though  I'd suggest trying out another account or something during the next godfest since those 7 stones could be another great god.

PuzzleAndDragons,3dwerq,Putrify,2,Mon Jul 20 02:25:25 2015 UTC,"Verd/GZL/DCC Athena/Marine Rider/ GL Meimei/Verd  Stacks a grand total of 10 green TPA and will get you far.  The cost is a pretty hefty thing for you to take, but you just need to farm up rank and you should be good. Meimei can be uevod to Awoken Meimei later on once you get the mats for it. The team only has 1 quick orbchanger with Marine Rider, so consider getting a G/R Cu Chu or an ADK Zeal for that spot.    Lkali/Lkali/Dkali/SQ/flex/Lkali  Hot damn you got some nice Kali shit going on. Flex can be taken by LZL for his juicy orb enchance and dongs, Benis (preferably awoken) for her CTW or Lmeta for her binds recovery. Another great option (that you don't have yet) is LValk.  A quick orbchanger is very vital to any team, so you want to have her on deck. Either Izanami works well for shields as well. Shit, you could even drop your 3rd LKali in there for shits and giggles.  Yamato/Leilan/Ronia/Ares/Gigas/Yamato  Gigas is a farmable heartbreaker, which will flesh out your team greatly.  It would have been better to have the R/D Gigas from the PAD school collab since he has a row, but R/L will do fine.  Yamato's leaderskill is if you match 8 fire together, you deal 4x damage (16x with friend). This works really well with rows, so you want to stack those as well.  With this team, you have 7 rows. if you get R/L Ares and Awoken Leilan (what you should aspire to) then the team will have 10 rows.  Very strong. I don't know if you will like Tomato's playstyle, but that's up to you to figure out. One problem is that he requires a maxskilled team to be effective, since if he is trolled on any one occasion he is fucked. It's also pretty easy to orbtroll him, since he requires a lot of fire orbs.  LzL/Lkali/Lkali/Lkali/Lvalk/Lzl  this is basically a brainless farming team. Not optimal by any means, but it's alright.  It might be able to handle KotG, but you might want to put Sun quan in place of an Lkali for the burst active.  This is definitely weaker than your Verdandi team, so prioritize that first.   Of these teams, your LKali is the strongest and will be able to tackle many later descends. If you want specific advice, go to the guide on the subreddit.  In terms of which team to develop first, I would go with your Verd team. It can handle a lot of stuff and having a strong farming team will allow you to develop your other teams faster."

PuzzleAndDragons,3dwerq,PhantomNox,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:28:26 2015 UTC,"An attacker team with a Cao Cao lead, GZL and DCC Athena subs, and two other attacker subs with TPA sounds pretty powerful, especially once you evolve them. With a Cao Cao friend, you'll be at an unconditional x9, and probably well over 20k hp. You're going to have to jack up your cost quite a bit though, as evolved GZL and DCC Athena are very expensive. Then again, I'm pretty new to the game as well, and  this suggestion is probably just based off my bias, as this is basically the team that I'm experimenting with. I'd also suggest that you level up the monsters that you're actively using to at least lv 50, the boost is stats definitely adds up."

I'd say it has its uses and I have a lot of sub options (Angelion, DQXQ, Valkyrie, Echidna, Lileth, King Shynee, Venus, Fuu, etc).  Pros:   Friday dungeon Can clear all normal except KoTG and past that (haven't even beat KoTG yet) Can clear all technical except beyond Mythic Stone Dragon Cave With the right subs it can beat Sandolphen, Hera-Sowilo, and one or two others Once you max level a lot of the subs it is really a high HP and high RCV team.   Cons:   Annoying as hell to stay above threshold Compared to other leaders it has pretty low attack Getting all the subs and leveling them up to give yourself enough HP Better find yourself another team for the descends :P   Overall I like her, but I'm getting pretty tired of never being able to do a descend."

[ Keeper of the Sacred Texts, Metatron ]  [ Sacred Dragon Princess, Da Qiao ]  [ Nomadic Dancer, Fuu ]  [ Divine Law Goddess, Valkyrie Rose ]  [ Awoken Venus ]  [ Keeper of the Sacred Texts, Metatron ]    This above team allows you to burst 5-6 million damage every 5 turns.  Chibi DQXQ makes a great ""free"" option, which really helps the team out.   As for King of the Gods, pair with a light Zhuge Liang for more damage, and run an additional orb changer for floor 9.

I'm running Meta/Valk/DQ/Sun Quan/Awoken Venus currently (with really close to 30k hp), and would like to switch over to Sandalphon (or maybe Arcline) instead of Sun Quan, but I need to max skill him first. A well invested Metatron team can get you through a decent amount of the early descends brainlessly, and definitely has the potential to take on the medium-hard stuff."

PuzzleAndDragons,3dwx9d,Sunjuan,2,Mon Jul 20 13:18:37 2015 UTC,"/u/Chisame already suggested a good base for an Lkali team. For the last two slots I'd prob use Lmeta and Lvalk. Other options you can consider are Athena, Awoken Venus (or LD Venus in place of Dkali for a light-focus team, although I think Dkali is superior), and Wee Jas for Lmeta if you already cover water and you want time extends to go with your unbindable unbinder (I still recc Lmeta over him because of superior stats, shorter CD, skillability, and waifu art).  Anyway that's a pretty solid Lkali team. I know you said you think she's more difficult, but imo higher end dungeons require higher end skills, no matter what lead you're running. Lkali is actually pretty easy considering the damage output you can generate by matching much less than, say, an Anubis lead. I personally main UY, who has the same leader skill but lacks the time extends. It took me some time to adapt after playing grind mode with HP multipliers and Grodins, but I think the burst life is more fun and more rewarding. If you want some tips on playstyle, I'm working on a UY guide and I made a section about quadcolor comboing here  If you want to continue with the tankier, unconditional multipliers, Lmeta would be a nice choice for your box. Lmeta/Lvalk/Awoken Venus/DQ/flex would be a solid light-based team. Lmeta is sorta falling out of the meta (lol) due to the HP conditional part of her leader skill, but the HP multiplier helps the healers' traditional problem of low HP, and her teams naturally have high recovery. This team wouldn't be the best for every dungeon, but it would excel in some. For the last spot, maybe Wee Jas or a second Lvalk if you don't mind the leveling.  Another great endgame descend team that I spot besides Lkali is Krishna. Krishna's ult makes him S tier in Japan (or so I believe if I remember correctly). You have some decent subs for him too. Krishna/Dino Rider/Cao Cao/Leilan/Chiyome looks like a solid team to me. All orb-changing or board changing subs, Leilan + Chiyome for a fire-heavy board sure to destroy bosses. Alternatively throw in Awoken Horus for the awakenings and orb enhance if you need it. Gigas is a decent farmable sub to consider as well if you have enough RCV to counteract the deficit. Make sure to skill everything! Mono color teams need those orbs.  Edit: I don't recommend an Andro or Panda team because those leaders are both extremely REM-dependent, and you don't have good subs for either of them (except SQ for Andro). Their farmable teams do significantly worse than their REM teams. I think the other teams I suggested would fare better."

PuzzleAndDragons,3dwx9d,Sunjuan,2,Tue Jul 21 00:07:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the bind clear is super useful in a ton of dungeons, so I think that you'll find that you will need her a lot.

Right now my friends list transformed in the last week to 80% hypermaxed Awoken Ra, Bastet and Horus AND I LOVE IT, which I guess means my friends list was already mostly whales, but I would accept any max skilled Yamato (don't care about plus eggs) because I love that guy, any Ganesha (lvl 1 even), and any max skilled Norn regardless of plus eggs.  In fact when I think about it, I'd take almost any highly-skilled current-ish leader because it might open up fun options. I have viable teams of all colours in my box and can make up for no plus eggs by comboing harder, but I can't make up for a high-cool down skill.  And I love just hitting endless corridors with new teams and trying out stuff.  But you gotta log in frequently. If you haven't played for 2 days you're out.  I also just culled a bunch of 297 Ronias who were all skill level 1. Quite why you'd 297 a Ronia and never skill it up even once is beyond me."

Its not that we dont want to skill it up, it just takes too much work for the chance to skill up when you could be farming for other things like +eggs, which is easier to farm. TL;DR: #pleb #skillup #RNG #gungtroll"
PuzzleAndDragons,3duj6s,in0ri,8,Sun Jul 19 17:42:41 2015 UTC,"This. Paying 50 stamina for a 1/3 chance of getting a monster u can feed for a 1/4 chance (on 2.5x skill up) of skilling up can be prohibitive.  Until this friday I was like 0/25 on my Kali skill ups which took me over a month and I was feeling pretty inadequate as the only slvl 1 kali on my flist, but sometimes non-IAPs get trolled hard by skill ups and it takes us a looooong time to get them.  I might throw some $ at the game for refills once my stamina pool gets huge, but for REM rolls they just cost too much for what they give you, I'm not averse to spending money, but $5 for a tiny tiny chance at getting what I actually want just isn't a good value in my eyes. /rant"
PuzzleAndDragons,3duj6s,ElectricLeo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:43:57 2015 UTC,"Skill ups are hard for everyone, whale or not. I didn't skill up my ronia (actually only lvl 5) by stoning, and I used two days of stamina to get one drop (no skill up) from the red pirate dungeon this weekend for my chibiyome. But if you have a 297 ronia and you continue to not try to skill her up I think you are crazy. A max skill ronia with no plus eggs, for me, is way more preferable than burning 297 eggs on a card you never use. I guess she's good at stalling, but then if you're in a position in which you can stall with her you probably don't need the eggs anyway.  I do feel for you on the thursday mythical though. I still need red fruit for my urd and I'm so done with farming for them after three months of slow collecting for ronia. Maybe I'm not a whale by your standards if I'm not doing that?  That said, I did pay for a bunch of box space to keep my blue and green fruit and max skilled my verd and skuld the moment they dropped. I really hate the skill up system. If piis were a little more attainable in the coin dungeons I would do those exclusively and pay for stamina refills to tear through as many as possible."
PuzzleAndDragons,3duj6s,alphafirestar,3,Sun Jul 19 18:53:56 2015 UTC,"I think the difference for whales and non-iap players is the frustration when you dont get the skill ups. For whales, skill ups are basically how many stones you use and how many you wasted by not getting the skill ups. For non-iapers, its time that was wasted, not many non-iap players refill their stam. Running mythical dungeons takes up 50 stam, which is 4 hours and 10 mins, just for a chance and what could get the drop you need or even just the chance for a skill up. There aren't that many hours in a day for non-iapers to run mythical, we can run up to 5 mythical dungeons assuming we start at 0 stam. The feeling of getting 0/5 is pretty devastating assuming all 5 runs gave you the one you needed. Skilling up is a terrible system for both parties, but I think non-iapers really dislike throwing days away for a chance. It's also pretty ironic to think teams needed to farm twin goddess requires pretty much max skill anyways, so there is no way for non-iapers to reliably farm that dungeon, 99 stam takes about 8 hours. TL;DR: skill up system is trash, whales wastes stones, non-iapers wastes time."
PuzzleAndDragons,3duj6s,ElectricLeo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:28:37 2015 UTC,"I will spend money on the game, but that doesn't mean I'm not gutted when the thing I want doesn't drop or the skill up doesn't happen. It's not like if you spend some bucks on the game you're suddenly immune to that, or that if I can afford to spend $23 a month that I'm so rich I'm like FUCK IT! 300 stamina and no skill up, what do I care! Let's burn some cash! It's infinite anyway! It took three months to skill up Ronia. THREE MONTHS. Even if you IAP, it doesn't mean you don't understand the value of time or money.  I spent $46 trying to get D Kali at the last PCGF. I felt the pain of not getting her. It's odd that you'd think that because I choose to spend money that I don't value that money. I do. I just love Puzzle and Dragons. It kept me able to keep playing games through the first month of my daughter's life when any other kind of real time gaming became impossible.  I don't like it when you tell me that I don't care if I lose stamina. I'm not sure why I care, but I do. IAPers are not some rich limitless money pit. We are not all oil barons from Dubai. Though I imagine some of us are :) But to tell me I don't understand your loss of four hours feels like an insult."
PuzzleAndDragons,3duj6s,alphafirestar,4,Sun Jul 19 20:47:50 2015 UTC,"I apologize if what I said offended you. I think watching japanese pad players really influenced what I think a whale is, seeing them buy multiple packs of stones for godfests and refill stam all the time has kind of desensitized me pertaining to the concept of whaling. Of course there are also people who do not have a tree that produces golden apples. I think whales have all the rights to complain about how there are friends who dont have a max leveled ronia even though it has been 297ed. I also think whales should understand not all players are whales or is hardcore and can have a hypermaxed xxx up for you to use at all times. In the end, whales choose to iap and non-iapers choose not to, its a choice we all make on our own and we should respect each other for the choices they have made."

PuzzleAndDragons,3dwgrk,PhantomNox,2,Mon Jul 20 02:44:03 2015 UTC,"Let me try and hit a few points and ill comeback and comment on actual teams...  Don't rush, the beginning of the game is about ranking up and leveling up, high team cost and solid monsters.  For your leads (that you asked about) I won't comment on D.Meta because I've never had one but  Ra: sub wise he is pretty forgiving however he is hard to activate, very hard to activate. Most people use board changers and time extend awakening, also defensive skills like shields. The dream team is something like A.Ra, LKali, LKali, DKali, G/B SQ but that is a whale team. I run Ra, Dark Venus, LKali, Kushinada and Chrono turtle.. It's mediocre atm.  Sakuya is considered the ""weakest"" 25x leader in terms of overwhelming damage but she still offers  25x with gravities and THE EASIEST team to obtain.   Kirin(Sakuya)/Red/Blue/Green/Flex Red: ideally Apollo but he is REM only and is really only useful when skilled, instead you can use Echidna, garbage stats but super useful active and has her own survey dungeon. Also you can get her at legendary dragons footprints (towards the end of the normal dungeons) Blue: ideally Light Meta, again very rare. For the farmers team I use Midgard (blue golem), rare but farmable on tuesdays in keeper of blue's dungeon. Keepers skill him up so he isn't to brutal to prepare. Green: Valkyrie or Athena, I prefer Valkyrie. Both are descend bosses so you aren't ready yet but sooner than later you will be able to get then. Flex: Verche is a winner clear, changes dark to light with a tpa. Farmable at the light dragon in legendary dragons footprints (although a pain to get, rare)  That is the eventual team to look at.   As for weekday mythicals, they suck imo and take some attention to team building to beat. This early in the game just save your PAL points and use them at the machine during events only, maybe save for the special 500 point machine for better rates. I have received one of reach fruit and 9 total by doing this in 66 days.  If you want I can look into your box for a team to use now? Also if I missed anything point it out and I can elaborate. (fyi played on and off for over two years, current account is the 66 day old one)"
PuzzleAndDragons,3dwgrk,GnuHope,0,Mon Jul 20 12:40:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the extensive response! I'm definitely keeping my mind on ranking up, since a lot of my monsters are pretty high cost when evolved.  It's good to hear that Ra is easy to fill with subs, that just means that I have to get better at matching. Maybe I'll upgrade from DQXQ to something a bit harder for practice, though I imagine that the main problem is not consistently having enough of each orb on the board. I think I could put together a Kirin team pretty easily with what I have and what I'm working towards. I already have a L.Meta, I'm working on farming a Naga whenever I have free stam, and I have a DCC Athena, unless you mean the descend Athena, which I'm looking to get asap anyways. Instead of Verche, would it be okay to use an evolved Rei Sirius? He has two TPAs and changes a column to light.  I'm saving my PAL points for the 500 point machine for sure, though getting a green dragonfruit specifically is probably unlikely. I've managed to get only a red and blue dragonfruit from the PAL machine... If you've got time to look over my box that'd be great, though you've already given me a good amount to work with. These are the main teams that I'm using for content clearing right now: http://imgur.com/a/ALUzh."

PuzzleAndDragons,3dwgrk,GnuHope,0,Mon Jul 20 21:12:17 2015 UTC,I'm running weekend dungeon (master) when I need coins and lava tube when I don't. I'm thinking about trying out alternate coin dungeons soon too. If there's a better way feel free to tell me!
PuzzleAndDragons,3dwgrk,GnuHope,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:22:01 2015 UTC,"Well as for lava tube, switch it up and run whichever has higher drops rates. Anything you don't feed sell.. I ran each weekend dungeon only once and have about nine million because I just sell my extras.   I haven't started coin dungeons yet but I know they are superior just been attending to other projects or running the shinra 1 collab (wicked xp/stam ratio)"
PuzzleAndDragons,3dwgrk,GnuHope,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:25:49 2015 UTC,"So I primarily use mobile so please forgive the (seemingly) random and piecemeal way I'm going to do this but... What jumps out is a freakish green team potential!   DCCAthena/Saiga Another/tpa orb changers would by my suggestion. I'd like to stack 6 orb enhances and every monster with a tpa if we can so.. Hmm skip the orb enhances but  DCCAthena, Saiga Another, GZL is the base, each with at least 2 tpa, an orb changer, def break and orb enhance.. For one turn it can spike almost anything. For those two flex spots I like Perseus and the earth dragon swordsman, clear blinds, change orbs and heart breaker (cu chu is better but thats down the road). If you prefer ADKZ has a TPA and low cool down (plus not to bad to skill up). Use GOdin as a stat stick.. Whenever huge stats and 2k auto heal.  With a DCCAthena friend you have high hp and tpas but I'd look for Verdandi friends, her active is more helpful then a second orb enhance. The team cost will be high but this team can clear KotG most likely, need to play your skills and tpas to one shot Zeus but doable.   If you have something in mind share and I'll dive back in, but this seems the simplest to play and grow from where you are.   Do you understand TPA boards? http://m.imgur.com/a/xAPED is a good resource for different leads and different boards.  Finally 2 more things... Kirin/Echidna/Valk/LMeta/Verche is as close to perfect as it gets without LKali (Verche/echidna) and Apollo (echidna). Rei is an okay sub for Verche but sometimes he converts orbs you needed where Verche only removes orbs you know you don't need.  My question: why do you want Athena? DCCAthena is just better (more tpa)"
PuzzleAndDragons,3dwgrk,GnuHope,0,Mon Jul 20 21:06:28 2015 UTC,"The core of the green team (DCC Athena, Saiga Another, GZL) is just as I thought. I was thinking Perseus and GOdin or Perseus and ADKZ for the remaining two spots, but hearing that Earth Dragon Swordsman could take a spot is certainly something I never considered. I'll evolve/awaken EDS when I have spare resources and see how I like him. I have plenty of DCC Athena friends and a couple of Verdandi friends, so the friend slot is covered. I've seen the TPA board examples floating around, but I have no idea how to interpret them. Is each example simply telling you the maximum amount of TPAs you can generate given a certain board? As far as Kirin goes, can I use DCC Athena in place of Valk, or is Valk's orb changer too valuable? And I just want normal Athena because her uevo looks cool, not really any other reason haha."

Xuanzang is a tough dungeon. I'm rank 238, cleared a whole bunch of descends. I cobbled together a team with mini dqxq and I've been doing this dungeon all day.

Assuming both Robins are max leveled with no plusses, you have a grand total of 6890 HP, which isn't enough to tank most of the hits in this dungeon. Robin is not that reliable of a leader with only two time extends unless you're some sort of combo God. If you don't hit your threshold you'll die easily. You don't have a lot of wiggle room. Sun Wukong's lightest attack is 2k more than you can tank, and if he spawns on a two-turn timer then god help your soul.   All in all I'd wait to assemble a better team. I don't think your odds look too good."
PuzzleAndDragons,3duz4a,Sunjuan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:50:44 2015 UTC,"The leeks do give a permanent 50% reduction so that team basically has 2x hp and recovery so it's definitely not as fragile as it seems.

PuzzleAndDragons,3duz4a,etlandis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:05:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah but you'd have to stall long enough for the first leek to come up, which would take 20 turns, and it's pretty difficult to stall in that dungeon imo."
PuzzleAndDragons,3duz4a,Sunjuan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:59:59 2015 UTC,That's true. You'd need to do exactly 8 combos to be able to stall without getting killed in one round although actual stalling is pretty easy due to the 4k recovery that team packs

It was die to one or the other. Gave it a rest woke up this morning and just walked through the first three levels no big deal of ss. Maybe give it a rest and come back when you arent frustrated and try to get more combos or use skills more efficiently
PuzzleAndDragons,3dv4f2,OsitoDeOjosAzules,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:13:21 2015 UTC,"Howdy! - Let's see here. This is a toughie as you're mainly Fire, and you're going to have to do double the damage against that guy to get past him.  In all honesty, Starlight Sanctuary levels and especially the ""King of the Gods"" level are not to be taken lightly. These are Damage and Burst Checks. Typically unless you're team is fully leveled, max awoken, and/or has a type advantage it will be very challenging. You really most likely just need to level, evolve, and awaken your team.  Alright now then... a proposed plan! This may sound like rambling, but i'll see if I can lay it out.   Since you have no heavy Armor Breaker you'll probably have to resort to a burst. King Flamie is an Attacker Burst and easy to farm Evolve your other Urds into Attacker form and get some levels to benefit from Flamie Evolve and get some levels on ""Shaitan, the Flame Elemental"". I'd probably replace Zeta Hydra with Shaitan for the Red Orb Enhance to be honest since he won't benefit from the Attacker burst and this is all about 1 Massive attack vs Delaying and grinding down the boss.    The Team:   Leader Urd Urd Rowdy Red Samurai - Heart Break King Flamie -  3x Attacker Burst Shaitan - Red Orb Enhance Friend Urd   The Plan   1: Get to the Boss 2: Use Urd's Active Skill. 3: Use King Flamie's Active Skill 4: Use Rowdy Red Samurai's Active Skill 5: Use Shaitan's Active Skill   This will net you:   3x Attack to Attacker Type for 1 Turn  A Red and Blue Board with Mostly Red All Red Orbs enhanced   I'm willing to bet, that if your friend's Urd is high enough level, she'll hopefully be able to do the necessary damage:   Monster Defense x 2 (Fire vs Water) + Monster Hit Points =  140000x2+32533 = 312,533   If you can line up Several 2-Prong Attacks, with the friend's Urd, you'll be able i'm thinking to do that much in Burst."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dv4f2,Denzik10,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:27:34 2015 UTC,"Hi! I had a similar problem when I first got to Starlight Sanctuary, as it's essentially the first late game dungeon in the game. My starting team was Cao Cao which is very similar to Urd, and while they worked great up until this point, their power starts to fall off. My recommendation to you is to start working on other teams that will not only improve your matching skills, but also carry you much further into the game.   The easiest and best option available to you currently is your Karin Team. The Chinese Celestials are fantastic entrances into the world of Combo gods as their activation requirements are a lot less taxing than some of the other, harder leads. This team is mostly TPA based, and can output much more damage than your current Urd team could even dream of. Not only that, but these subs, minus Water Dragon Knight, are all very powerful leads themselves! If you choose to make this team, you'll have access to 36x, 25x, 16x, and 12.25x teams that all play differently, and can be very strong once you acquire the proper subs!   You do have another route available to you, but this one will be much harder to learn and doesn't present itself to you nearly as well. In your box resides one of the current Kings of Puzzle and Dragons, Ra. Ra is capable of an incredible 100x in his Awoken Form, and 64x and 36x in his other forms. However, with such power comes a very difficult to activate leader skill. Sadly, your subs don't compliment Ra nearly as well, but you can make a rather decent Farmable Team without too much effort. The benefits of this route over Karin is only experience, as you'll soon be more attuned to working with very difficult leader requirements, but once again, your Karin team is much much much better.   Keep in mind that I'm not telling you to trash your Urd team, as it'll still be fantastic for farming easier dungeons. Nearly every player has at least one Farming team that isn't hard to use, and one Descend team that has much higher damage output. Good Luck and Happy Puzzling!"
PuzzleAndDragons,3dv4f2,LordFlufffy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:54:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the wonderful write up! Are my subs really that good for Karin though? It's the one team I'he thought of making, but the subs scared me a bit."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dv4f2,LordFlufffy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:35:35 2015 UTC,"Your subs for Karin aren't perfect, but they'll be perfectly fine for carrying you through the easier and even some of the harder late game content. Zuoh + U&Y makes a Karin Board, Dmeta is fantastic for her active skill and stats, and Dragon Swordsman is a great source of bind clear. You have a passable amount of HP and a good chunk of attack too. The only problem with this team is its lack of RCV, but you probably won't need to stall on most of the content this can beat anyways. The cool thing about this team in conjunction with KotG is that it has a solid amount of dark damage, as well as 5 dark row enhances, meaning that if you focus on a dark heavy board for Zeus, you should be able to one shot it rather efficiently. And as I was saying earlier, a lot of these subs turn out to be pretty solid leads as well. Dark Metatron is an amazing farming lead with 16x, U&Y is one of the 5x4c or quadcolor leads that can clear most of the game, and Zuoh is one of the only gods in the game capable of dealing 36x. If you happen to roll any key subs for these gods, you can just as easily switch over."

PuzzleAndDragons,3durra,DragonSpawn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:18:22 2015 UTC,I'm going to second this mainly because a colour or combo based lead will teach you so much more about the game then running anything else.   Just remember that Wukong does require a bunch of skillups and awakenings to run properly and skillups are the most frustrating aspect of this game so just take note.

PuzzleAndDragons,3dui1g,phantomace1111,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:50:19 2015 UTC,A.Ra can use pretty much anything (though 2L1D team is optimal) so it's not like there's going to be a huge difference. Chances are you'll end up flexing any subs you have for different dungeon conditions.
PuzzleAndDragons,3dui1g,Rexcalibur,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:39:24 2015 UTC,With that team you already have 5.5-6.5 seconds (8.5-9.5 with Ra active) to move orbs so the CTW isn't going to make a huge difference.

I've been keeping my Venus L/D for my Hathor team and anything less than 10 seconds is a waste of a skill for CTW on a rainbow team.  Also, her awakenings aren't stellar either for rainbow teams.  Now for a healer team where you're making light rows?  Awoken Venus is the way to go."

PuzzleAndDragons,3dvfcy,jordmorton,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:28:04 2015 UTC,Hang in there. It will definitely be worth it in the long run. The game has so much to offer later. Don't let a crappy beginning get you down.
PuzzleAndDragons,3dvfcy,Sunjuan,2,Mon Jul 20 00:08:06 2015 UTC,"Hey, his unevolved form (Beast Rider, without the Merlin) was my starter! I didn't know anything about rerolling then so I just kept him.  Eventually I rolled some great monsters, but if I hadn't I definitely would have stagnated. I would recommend rerolling. His leader skill only multiplies attack, so your team would have very low HP. He also doesn't teach you how to combo; I didn't learn until much later because it wasn't necessary to use him.   His ultimate evolution is slightly better but it's too hard for you to get in the beginning. He's also not used, even as a sub, on many (if any) end game teams.  In short, he's not a good leader, and he can't even transition to becoming a good sub.  Godfests are usually twice a month. During a godfest, there are increased chances to get gods. Those are the best times to reroll. The next godfest would probably be the end of this month (7/31), although it hasn't been announced yet. If you're getting frustrated, maybe try rerolling then :)"
PuzzleAndDragons,3dvfcy,Sunnycyde,2,Sun Jul 19 21:27:27 2015 UTC,Actually he does become a decent sub once ultimate evolved. Fast orb change and 2 tpa is great only downside is low(ish) stats.

I have similar luck when pulling leads: two uy, two Kirin, and one Durga. I also have two bastets, but few other green monsters, and no other combo leads. Personally, I really want shiva. I even saved and ult evoed a Phoenix in case I ever pull him.   Pretty sad to see another user that's switched from UY to Kali. I'm slowly watching as my entire friends list gets swept away. I feel like most of my friends just put up uy in their first slot while they increasingly use and plus their kalis.   Edit: just looked at your box and teams, you have so many of my white whales :( guessing this is IAP. Very nice teams! I'm going full farmable Durga route since my dark box sucks.

Also, U&Y needs board changers and time extends to be effective, while Blodin’s active doesn’t help much.   And yup, I’m light IAP, but I spend my stones only on REM and occasionally box space (never stamina). I generally don’t have the greatest luck, but I do have a weird knack for pulling GF exclusives.   The LKali switch will hopefully only be temporary! I’m very fond of U&Y, so I’m really hoping GungHo gives them a good alt evo and awoken evo. I think U&Y have more future potential than Kali (who’s unlikely to get another evo)."

I always kept at least 3 tamas in my mail for the next several months until he finally came. I love my blodin very much lol   I luckily have a board changer on my team (Famiel) and yeah the lack of time extends sorta sucks :/ I was so excited when I saw the latent tamas, but now that I know that each one is only 0.05 seconds idk if I should bother.   Your box looks really lucky to me! Namely my white whale is sun quan and I think I spotted three so I just went to extreme salt mode lol.   Kalis gonna hold the meta for a while. Oh well. I wouldn't have a good Kali team if I pulled one anyway. And yes more uvos for uy pls. Awoken JP 2, gungho make it happen!"

If it's the latter, try downloading the HK version (which runs on JP servers) but is less strict when it comes to 3rd party apps and rooting.   Also, if you download the HK version, you can see for certain if it's running into conflicts with 3rd party programs or root. If nothing else, use it as a tool to see for sure."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dtmw7,TheHardTruth,2,Sun Jul 19 10:11:01 2015 UTC,"It never worked. Is the HK version ""connected"" with Jp? I mean, if he manage to create an account there can he add a person in Jp?"
PuzzleAndDragons,3dtmw7,QnA,2,Sun Jul 19 10:21:08 2015 UTC,"The HK version runs off the same Japanese servers so it means you can add him as a friend and use each other's leaders. However, the drawback is that some collabs don't come to the HK version (like DBZ). But everything else is the same as far as content goes. When updates happen and new evos & monsters gets released, it's all the same since they both use the same JP servers.  I can't run the JP version because my device is rooted or something so I play the HK version instead and it's the same except for some collabs don't come over. The funny thing is, if someone else playing JP rolls the collab and say they roll Goku, and they're on your friends list, you can use him as a friend leader even though you couldn't roll in the collab. =)"

Just a tip I realized, Make sure to use YOUR bastet's active on a boss floor if you need more damage.  Awoken Bastet's skill gives you the movement time, but normal Bastet still has her damage enhance on the skill [meaning your active skill+awoken leader skill boosts green damage by 2.25-- 1.5(skill)x1.5(awoken leader)]"

You'll want enough team cost to fit all your best monsters on your Horus team, like LZL.     Hold on to one Keeper of Rainbow you get, through Tuesday dungeon or lucky PAL pull, since it'll probably be your best dark sub for a while. I might play Dub-mythlit right now as your dark sub just to squeeze more team cost in somewhere else.  So in the near future, your main team can look like: Horus | Gigas | LZL (evoed) | Dub-mythlit/KoR | best green sub (Earth Dragon) | friend Horus (actually any rainbow leader is fine) This covers all colors, but costs 131 counting evoed Horus as well. You'll need quite a few more ranks for that.  LZL is much more of a mid-late game project, since you need to awaken him and assist him with fast orb changers like Valk to be good. But Horus will be good now and in the future; you just need more practice (and time extends)."

I know I would have been on this route if it weren't for my roommate telling me otherwise, and eventually landing a Sakuya."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dqv95,davidLg,5,Sat Jul 18 20:51:43 2015 UTC,"Sonia Gran could also do well as the face of PAD.   I feel like they should revamp the tutorial so that it emphasizes moving your orbs around until you run out of time (I feel like they might already do that, but I've still seen people who are used to Bejeweled or Candy Crush move a single space at a time) and maybe introduce some more complicated board mechanics like cascades.  The tutorial should also include more information about the game outside of the board and talk about awakenings, evolution, leader skills, etc.  Also to draw people in they could replace the beginning slimes and carbuncles with some cooler looking gods and just tone down their stats.  Another thing they could change to make the game more attractive for beginners is to make the first REM roll a guaranteed gold egg or god. I feel like it'd be interesting if on the first roll all REM gods would be available so that beginners at least start with something they can potentially stick with for a long time."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dqv95,thugraptor,5,Sat Jul 18 19:19:42 2015 UTC,"Aside from the required tutorial, there should be an optional advanced tutorial dungeon that teachers you about all the new mechanics that has been added such as rows, tpas, enemy skills and what do they mean (elemental dmg reduction, resolve, combo shield), jammer/poison orbs etc...  Would be nice if they gave you something minor but exclusive as a reward too (maybe a random trash rem roll like sticker girls, the chibis, or dragon knights)"
PuzzleAndDragons,3dqv95,doesnotexist1000,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:04:04 2015 UTC,I feel like adding anything to the tutorial should take place at least after your first roll. The tutorial is already pretty tedious as it is with rerolling and first time players aren't going to be able to absorb all that information at once anyway. I like the idea of explaining awakenings/uevo/leader skills after a certain milestone (maybe after the first 6 element stages)
PuzzleAndDragons,3dqv95,99percentmilktea,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:18:27 2015 UTC,The problem is people already ignore the tutorial so much that they don't realize it tells you that you can drag an orb all the way across the board.

PuzzleAndDragons,3dqv95,Hipster_Jesus,3,Sat Jul 18 20:51:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with your art changes, but the point you made about trash monsters is spot on.  You fight the same 3 damn recolored monsters for the first couple weeks of playing this game, you only see cool stuff every few bosses and if you luck out with a good REM pull (assuming you don't already know everything about this game and rerolling).  It seems like it would be really easy to throw in another two sets of trash mobs.  Start them off as powerful as low level slimes, give them one or two evos and you can even make them skill up some new set of trash rolls from the REM with their evos and everyone will be happy.  I'm fairly sure the GungHo employees also haven't touched the tutorial in years, a little revamping would be cool."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dqv95,FatSquirrels,2,Sat Jul 18 20:57:55 2015 UTC,"Recommendations I'd make are:   Create new tutorials for how to awaken, how each awakenings work (specifically TPA and rows), skill ups, and expanding friend slots -- Summons Board (a newer GungHo game) has much better tutorials First skill up feed is 100% success rate, second is 75%, third is 50%, etc -- also in Summons Board, it's encouraging for newbies and great for everyone. GH could just raise the skill levels up by 1 if they want to be evil, but it's a good lesson for new players Add an option to add friend slots when trying to add a user when maxed Add incentives for new players: 2x exp until rank 50, half stamina until rank 50 -- again, Summons Board has this, and makes it much more easier for new players to get hooked since they progress faster Add a missions system: beat 10/25/50/XX dungeons and get a stone/item/monster, do a 5/7/10/X combo and get X, beat X dungeon, reach rank XX -- yup, Summons Board   A guild system would be fun. Adds more incentive to keep logging in if you have others that depend on you.  Edit:   Notifications when stamina is full (optional) Notification when guerrilla dungeon is active (optional) -- yup, in SB 11 rolls for the price of 10 (probably will never happen since YamaP doesn't like batch rolls, he says there's magic in rolling one at a time)"

Sonia Gran/Zaerog8 would be much better than a stupid Volcano Dragon (it's not even final evo).  I think the starting screen with the RGB starter dragons should be recycled every week.

Of Minerva, Femme, Chiyome, A.Hino, A.Leilan, Uriel, and Yamato choose 3-4. And of A.Horus, Echidna, and A.Shiva choose 0-1 (A.Shiva > A.Horus in this case imo.) This team would be relatively easy to play give you pretty consistent damage.  I think starting out I would go Krishna, Minerva, Chiyome, Femme, A.Shiva because you have lots of fast orb changers that way. But with time maybe move towards something like a Krishna, Minerva, A.Leilan, Chiyome/yamato, A.Shiva. Going with Yamato over Chiyome will give you 100% skill bind resist also but longer orb change. (Full disclosure I'm not really a krishna player, but this team just seems like it would be pretty dece. but it would be worth checking out the krishna guide on here and some youtube videos to see if you would want to play that."

I typically just spend a stone or two to clear Challenge 8 when I feel like it and bring some bind-resistant leaders.   I present you with three new suggestions for your box: * Horus  is easy to use. Time extends will help you improve combos. * UmiYama because it matches your plus eggs and subs. * Venus rows could be awesome if the resists apply.

PuzzleAndDragons,3dt0cv,Duckwen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:27:13 2015 UTC,"Actually, that was a funny story all in itself. My girlfriend likes to roll during godfests even though she doesn't know anything else about the game besides this is the period of time where I will spend my stones, usually.   Before I let her roll, I got my gambling fix in and rolled a couple times and got LKali and was very happy but still wanted Liu Bei and GZL to team with my DCC Athena.   When I gave her my phone, she rolled(and she doesn't let me see the screen until it hatches, mind you) and said she got this ""Kali"" girl and when I saw it was LKali, I told her I had just rolled her too. So she asked me what am I looking for then and I said Liu Bei or Zhuge Liang. She rolled again and said ""here's the Zhuge guy"", I was super excited until I saw it was LZL and not GZL and all she could say was ""you gotta tell me which one beforehand"". After that she got a couple of silver eggs and then, with my last roll, she just said ""I think I got that Kali's sister or something"". And that's how my girlfriend rolled me 3 GFE(2 6 stars) in about 6 pulls.  But yes, I was very pleased with the end result, even though it shifted my entire focus to a new team."

As much as I like skill up fodder for the Sticker Girls (own two duplicates of Ruka), farming this particular set is quite annoying for a couple reasons:   The 3-star drops not only require evolving, but they also require Keepers (although Keepers are easy to farm beyond Tuesdays for some high Rank players) Granted, 4-star drops don't need any evolving, but Ruka and Kurone's fodder has 50/50 chance of RNG trolling players as only one will spawn in Battle 6/7 This is a licensed Collab, so it's limited to a 2-week stint each time and its return could take months or year (if it ever returns)   With any luck, perhaps GungHo would add non-evolving, non-licensed Collab skill up fodder for the Sticker Girls someday."

PuzzleAndDragons,3ds4jy,MacawsInMacau,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:16:00 2015 UTC,"1) Gonna guess that the two that's most likely going to surface is the ""self skill boost"" and ""chance to survive fatal hits"" latent awakenings. considering that they were mentioned as part of the original Navitama awakenings.  2)  I like the idea that Shiva Dragon is a monster that both IAP and non IAP can gun for, and it somewhat suppresses the luck factor involved in the REM. As much as everyone would groan and moan that only whales will be able to easily access the monster due to its steep price, i think its still somewhat fair, either you pay for it or you bleed for it. As it is for certain MMOs. What i really don't like about Shiva D though is that the only proper non IAP god type that can be placed in his party is literally just Hera Ur, lifive  and maybe Vulcan. They need to work on its non IAP sub selections.  3) I will wait for the stats of Indigo before trying it with anything. For all you know they would give her a color absorb that will tear rainbow teams apart.  4) About the same as 3. I think skyfall manipulators will be important in this type of dungeons.

Only time will tell though.  As far as awakenings go, we might see a nerfed TPA for 1.1x damage or something. I'm also interested in other things we can buy.

I'd say 30k is still reasonable, but I don't really think I would go much higher, unless it came max leveled or something."
PuzzleAndDragons,3ds4jy,imk2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:07:22 2015 UTC,"I think more than TPAs and rows, smaller 5x4 board bring in several other factors.   Lack of stalling ability. Less likelihood of 3 heart orbs with fresh board. Lack of combo damage. Meaning LS, like Goemon's 5x or DMeta's 4x or... Shiva Dragon's 5x, come into play more because there are fewer other ways to gain damage. Orb changers will be more prominent. 20 orbs means on average 3.3 orbs per color for fresh board. That's not a lot to go on. Much more orb trolling. Board changers, probably all become more important. Smaller board restrict skill level meaning sub optimization (aka how much are you willing to pay $$$) will play a bigger role."
PuzzleAndDragons,3ds4jy,plogp,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:24:55 2015 UTC,"Column skills are also impacted in efficiency for both orbs and amount of manipulation needed. Currently they're good for one TPA by moving one orb, but on the larger board you can now remove the second from the end or force the last two on either the top or bottom into another combo.  And...what about Shin's cross skill?"
PuzzleAndDragons,3ds4jy,Level8Zubat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:21:44 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see a 1/5th bind resist latent tama but I kind of feel like it might be a little overpowered. I get so sad when my awoken horus gets bound =(  I for one welcome our new 9 star overlords. I'm looking forward to seeing what they do for light since I have a better team for it (potentially) on jp. In fact, while I kind of hope they're not exact clones, it would be nice for the subs I have if they were. I feel like the angel invade alone is going to make an equivalent light card pretty unlikely. Shiva Dragon is ridiculously strong but you have to have the right cards to make it worthwhile - a farmable option that's as good as the angel invade would be ridiculous. Of course this is all pretty far down the line. I'm still pretty far away from being able to buy one on jp, but luckily it will probably be a while before any I really want come out. All bets are off when he comes to na though.  As far as the bigger/smaller boards, I feel like the skill ceiling is higher on the bigger board and lower on the smaller one. Even if you can't make full use of the extra orbs on the bigger one, it shouldn't be any worse than normal size. The smaller one has a lot fewer chances to mess up and if you do mess up is theoretically easier to fix. However I just can't believe all they'll do is change board size. I'd bet they'll also change orb move time. I'm interested to see the dungeons though."

They're more likely to look for and participate in discussion because they're more invested in the game. They also have more to brag about, and showing off accomplishments helps validate their spending. (Not being sarcastically critical here, although it kind of looks that way; even as a cheap old man, I like to brag a bit when I can.) Yes, I have Bastet. She sat in my box for over a year, unevolved, in case I wanted her for a 20-cost dungeon. Eventually, something languishing in your box will become the Next Big Thing. It's the nature of the game. Then it will ever so slowly lose ground to power creep. I have, in nearly 600 days, hypermaxed one monster. I have a lot sitting at +50 to +150 and loads of skilled-up stuff. I've only recently started diverting most of my stones to +eggs, though. When you reach a point (probably much sooner) where you feel like you don't really need a lot from the REM to progress, stoning for +eggs will hugely accelerate things. Don't neglect skill ups, though. Check hard dungeons on the database or wiki (sidebar links) to know when to expect one-shot-or-be-shot moments and other surprises. Often these attacks come when a boss reaches a hit point threshold. Either kill the boss from above that point, or use a delay or damage reduction skill. Ha ha ha I can't wait to evo my Bastet.

PuzzleAndDragons,3dpvjc,Apof,5,Sun Jul 19 03:56:39 2015 UTC,"The thing about A. Bastet is she's a very high skill cap leader.  She's going to be very frustrating to use until you get reliably get six combos or more, with at least one of those being a TPA.  And as has been said in multiple different threads, you don't need a Liu Bei to make her team viable.  Despite appearances, the game isn't completely pay to win.  There's a good deal of individual skill/practice required to use the high tier leaders and to clear the very late end game content."

PuzzleAndDragons,3dpvjc,in0ri,2,Sat Jul 18 13:53:24 2015 UTC,Ahem... no REM challenge. Awareness raised.  I'm out.
PuzzleAndDragons,3dpvjc,yiannisph,5,Sat Jul 18 21:17:48 2015 UTC,"Don't set your sights on a specific team or leader, you'll go mad. Or broke. Or both. Pick a few leaders you have and enjoy, read up on them, and build up your teams for them -- farmable at first, REM upgrades if you get them.  Don't underestimate levels -- simply getting your team members to level 99 gives you a far stronger team than mid-levels. It adds up fast. Plus eggs will come over time, but level 99 you can totally control.  As for godfests, I'd recommend spreading out your stones -- pull a half dozen times when there's a good potential lineup, then stop and wait for the next one. You'll get a better spread this way. PCGF is an exception, but even that is distinctly different each time.  Hope you're able to keep having fun, and good luck!  P.S. Yes I have Bastet. :-) However, my support for him sucks -- no Liu Bei, no Venus, no Osiris, no Meimei, etc... A good gambler works the cards he has, just pretend you're Han Solo playing P&D and you'll be fine."

Play longer, use your natural stamina all the time, grind everything in the game, and you'll eventually have those awesome hypermaxed teams.

PuzzleAndDragons,3dpvjc,HippasusOfMetapontum,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:13:38 2015 UTC,"lol i actually like this post.  I feel the pain.  Here's a bit of my responses   how can you have bastets   I had to roll a ton (and sacrifice many lambs to RNGesus) to finally roll one, after having 4 anubi and 0 other egyptians.   want liu/Venus   I had 0 of either despite being some of my most wanteds and rolling every fest they were in.  Ended up getting 4 liu beis in a short time, and eventually venus(would be VERY useful in your DQXQ team in place of Sun Quan).  it happens, just give it time, and also, the more you want, the less likely you are to get (from my experience).   grodins   pls no   2 awesome teams   Your teams are actually VERY solid, and as someone who claims they cant combo very well anyway, you have 2 teams that cater to that extremely well.  Lmeta and Dandi both can do very late game things.  off the top of my  head, Lmeta can do Dragon/God rush with a team close to yours.   two prong attacks   learn them, love them.  They add so much damage.   F--k the izanami dungeon... 2-3 stones each run   Stop running the dungeon for now then.  Its a WIP team and she'll come back.    What team are you using for it? i find Lmeta clears it pretty well.  if yomi screws you up, just use DQ/Valk while blinded and match as much damage as you can, should 1 shot.   battery life:   If i see that getting close 22%/21% I'll usually stop playing until the notification comes up.   one shots   they suck   297s   best way to get 297s is to farm FT4-door of light and shadow on mondays with 5x technical events going on.  Also starry view, and at your rank, King of gods works very well since you'll rank up a lot.  Dont underestimate having more and more stamina bank.  Having more stamina helps ramp up the plus egg farming since you get more runs per stone.  I'm about to hit 200 stamina, which means i can almost run 7 (with 10 more stamina) starry view lanes per stone.    TLDR: more rank->more stamina-> more efficient stone usage for plus eggs.   Perfect boards with little thinking   I started as an lmeta player (after about rank 120 when i pulled her) and my combo skills where garbage because they didnt need to be good.  I have since tried to get much better, and started looking at a lot of instructional videos (like this series, but he got shadowbanned, so he doesnt show up in subreddit anymore) to try and recognize board patterns.  Setting up perfect boards is pretty useful when you can use them.   Also I've spent way more time in Endless corridor varients than I should.     stylus/pens   try using your finger, a lot of people still do, and if you lose your finger, well then... idk.   skill up chance   yupp, life sucks sometimes with skill ups."

It's improtant to know this, he has a perfect pii farming team with Rodin system and is rank 930+. If he says it's worth to save piis (as a person who can farm piis more efficiently than others as speed, consistency and stone to stamina ratio) it's definitely worth.  Grats on your max skilled goemon, although I am still faar away from having one, I am planning to max skill mine the same way.  Edit: To be more clear, I believe it's worth. Even if I had excessive amount of piis, I would still go with the feeding max level uevo because I believe piis are more valuable than exp.

PuzzleAndDragons,3dqco0,jx9,9,Sat Jul 18 13:22:50 2015 UTC,"The value or ""worth"" of something always varies and depends on the player. For some players, time is the most valuable resource and they are interested in the fastest method regardless of stones spent. For others, stamina efficiency is the most valuable resource and they are interested in the method that takes the least amount of stamina regardless of time. For some players, they really want to rank up fast so they prefer the Pii farming method as that gives a ton of rank exp on the side as they farm for Piis. For others, they're trying to skill up a lot of descend bosses so they don't mind farming for more red jewels. Etc. etc.  TL;DR: the most worthwhile/efficient strategy for 1 player may not necessarily be the same for another."

If lilith is max skilled, you need 8 skill boosts minimum so that she can poison floor 2.  You could also make a swallowtail, who has a skill boost and shorter poison timer once skilled (but no time extend).  Floor 1: basic activation, use Lkali if need be.     Floor 2, clear greens/hearts on free turns, poison before taking a single hit.  use the turn to match any excess colors (besides light), greens, and hearts.  Arrange the board if you can, but its not necessary.  Floor 3: use the excess light orbs to make 2 tpas+36x activation, which should 1 shot even the tamadra.  Floor 4:  Disclaimer-- with 9 skill boosts on my listed team, Sun Quan comes up as I enter the floor.   Pop sun Quan, delay gives you a ton of turns to kill, but usually a tpa light +activation kills at least the devilit.

I do better that way then trying to plan stuff out, but nowhere near that level.    I noticed you literally NEVER used Genbu, and only used Parvati twice or so.  How would you think a max skilled Verdandi would work instead of parvati?    I was thinking of running something like Bastet/Liu/Meimei/Sasuke/Verdandi as my team."
PuzzleAndDragons,3drfpg,AverageSloth,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:42:34 2015 UTC,"Yea we are probably the same style. The longer I look at the board the worse I match, so I just let my eyes and stylus do the work. XD.  I didn't even notice that I never use Genbu. XD. I am pretty bad when it comes to dual color or tri color board personally so that could be why. I picked Parv for 3 reasons: 1. She can help me heal if I got Apolo. 2. She has dual TPA and I lack better sub (no Verdandi or artermis or Gvalk and such) 3. Her skill is 5 turn so if i dont have other skill but enough green on the board i can still hit dat 36x.  I would use max skilled Verd in a heartbeat honestly. But for such a long dungeon sometimes a quick heart maker can come in very handy."

I would pick either A.Ra or A.Bastet and work on hypermaxing them, and then their subs. Leaning towards A.Ra first since it shares a lot of subs with SS Isis, then A.Bastet. You'll find that A.Bastet to be much more flexible than A.Ra though, due to being a combo lead and having a far wider range of subs.  Feel free to add me.

PuzzleAndDragons,3dsfrg,christopherjin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:51:35 2015 UTC,Aite thanks :)
PuzzleAndDragons,3dsfrg,JPLjoseph,2,Sun Jul 19 03:33:15 2015 UTC,"it is definitely possible to clear, but consistant farming is out of the question. you'd likely need a perfect ronia board. you mingt be better off with a delay sub> the hera"
PuzzleAndDragons,3dsfrg,JPLjoseph,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:52:43 2015 UTC,what delay would you consider helpful? echidna would give me another 3 turns but i would lose rcv and dmg. maybe ill sub her in if i have alot of trouble. thanks for the advice! :)
PuzzleAndDragons,3dsfrg,reki,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:45:23 2015 UTC,"i think batman is optimal but its unlikely you have it, try without a delay and if you dont have any luck try echidna"
PuzzleAndDragons,3dsfrg,reki,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:29:12 2015 UTC,You guessed right I don't have it I'm planing to use CDD with Haku to form a nice board thanks for the advice tho :)
PuzzleAndDragons,3dsfrg,RangeXero,2,Sun Jul 19 03:45:06 2015 UTC,"The problem with that team is that it's pretty low on dark rows. Thankfully, Zeus is easier than he looks because he's light element, so you only really need to do about half as much damage...somewhere in the 2 million range which should be no problem with Ronia/Luci/Baddie unless you get an exceptionally shitty Ronia active.  Tiamat in floor 8 actually only has 500k HP, I'd reckon if you save dak orbs before floor 8 you might be able to just wreck his face with a row and some."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dsfrg,RangeXero,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:07:56 2015 UTC,"isnt there 5 dark rows on it tho since lucifer has 2, haku has 2 and ronia has 1 so that seems pretty good i dont know whats standard since i dont usually use ronia. thanks for the advice :)"
PuzzleAndDragons,3dsfrg,reki,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:47:38 2015 UTC,"4 is the breaking point for where rows about equals 2 combos of 3 for single-target damage, so that's the minimum. So 5 would be the minimum for rows to be generally worth.  A typical row-focused team will run 7+ rows, 9-12 rows aren't uncommon. My Ronia team, for example, has 10 dark rows."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dsfrg,RangeXero,2,Sun Jul 19 03:10:29 2015 UTC,"This is actually incorrect. 3 row enhances means rows beat out combos if you make multiple rows, 4 row enhances beats out combos when you make a few combos in addition to the row, and 5 beats combos all the time."
PuzzleAndDragons,3dsfrg,reki,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:24:17 2015 UTC,also i think i do have enough damage b/c after the math as long as i get even 2 rows from ronia's active i have enough dmg. http://imgur.com/HKvmzRJ however im prob gonna use grim sheep's advice and run cdd. thanks everyone! :)

PuzzleAndDragons,3dsfrg,tamabot,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:44:24 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/9h5irlm Here i should still have enough damage as long as i get 12/30 dark orbs :).
PuzzleAndDragons,3dsfrg,RangeXero,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:55:40 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I forgot about 3 row enhances winning if you make multiple rows....I guess it matters here since you're planning on bursting with Ronia where you're always making multiple rows.  4/5 is basically what I said though: 4 is pretty even, whereas 5 ends up being better in general."

PuzzleAndDragons,3drk8o,wivable,0,Sat Jul 18 19:44:54 2015 UTC,"One to two awoken meimeis, GZL, then flex.  Bastet's weakness is RCV and no HP boost for big preemptives.  Kushi can help with both, but there are better options when you're not facing large preemptives.  Michael's great to patch up Bastet's RCV, and when max skilled, can become a great source of both defense and offense with his active; if it doesn't kill you, Michael can probably get you back to full health.    Osiris is awesome for longer dungeons so you can get your prongs and Bastet's secondary boost more often.     Wee jas or earth dragon knight for bind clear.  I'd prefer Wee jas since binds tend to be more than 2 turns, but unless skilled up he's pretty unusable.    A. parvati for full poison resist against Beelz' sea of poison.  For most descends, you'll be just fine with mostly offensive subs as you'll simply pop and active and sweep a floor.  Only when you're expecting to have to stall (Gaia in god rush) or be bound/hit/skill lock that you have to move subs around."
PuzzleAndDragons,3drk8o,kittyPowersupply,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:07:24 2015 UTC,One thing to add is that having some friend Osirises can help with the tanking department in dungeons where sweeping isn't an option.

PuzzleAndDragons,3droqi,Fatalxsumm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:52:41 2015 UTC,"Beat it with bastet. You dont even notice the binds. Drop gabriel under 50% hp and he wastes 4 turns out of the 5 turns he binds you for. He also only has like 700k hp so two turns even with one leader bound should be able to kill him easily. Break michael's Defense really easily with either GZl or Liubei. You only need bastet's active and 1 prong to do that. Kill at least 1 of the floor 1 as soon as you can so the other wastes a turn enraging. I dont think you can stall on it. The rest is super piss easy to kill with awoken bastet.
