hearthstonecirclejerk,3a6rv8,abat__,5,Wed Jun 17 19:33:03 2015 UTC,Omg! A new bug that was discovered 20 seconds after the new patch! I am going to make 3 threads about it and proceed to complain about the entire patch because of minor bugs. Blizzard obviously doesn't care about us and is trying to make the game p2w.
hearthstonecirclejerk,3a6hai,Banana4142,24,Wed Jun 17 16:37:03 2015 UTC,"Tavern brawl is so bad. It should be a perfectly balanced and extremely competitive, not this mode that is simply just for fun and gives free packs like we asked for. Is Blizzard stupid?  This is the only way to fix tavern brawl:  1) Unlock all classic cards for every player, simply for balance reasons. NOTE: YOU WILL NOT GET ALL GVG CARDS TOO YOU LAZY F2P PLAYERS  2) Every week, hold a poll on /r/hearthstone (the heart of the community, everyone is top 5 legend player) about which classes are most OP and unfair. Ban these classes from tavern brawl. Hunter is always banned because LE HUFFER  3) After every loss (not win, or else game is p2w) reward 50 special GvG packs. Each pack has guaranteed one legendary (otherwise game is too much of a grind and everyone will quit)  4) At the end of the tavern brawl week, release new 4000 card expansion to keep game fresh  IF BLIZZARD DOES NOT DO THIS THEY ARE LITERALLY THE LAZIEST AND GREEDIEST COMPANY ON EARTH"

Unfortunately, their time here has come to an end. The memes here have dried and been overused, and are no longer dank and rich.

After all this game is advertised as free to play, so everything should be acquirable with in game currency within 45 minutes of signup (or else it is unfair to new players and clearly pay to win).  Now, I know what you may be thinking, that Blizzard has to make money off the game somehow right? Well I am a certified reddit pro businessman, and I can assure you if Blizzard does not give every player 100 packs right now, new cosmetics, new heroes, and a new 500 basic card expansion (all cards auto added to collection for balance purposes), this game will surely fail. If new players are not at MINIMUM given 1000 packs at signup, there is no way anyone will stick with this game.   Blizzard's greed is disgusting.

hearthstonecirclejerk,36320e,Grommash_Hellscream,5,Fri May 15 18:01:44 2015 UTC,I regularly make top 100 rank 18 and I highly recommend removing any cards from your deck that make your opponent feel bad when you play them. Nobody likes facing down Emperor or Dr. Boom and they really don't like playing around the combo so don't be such a bully! You and everybody else who beats me is everything that is wrong with this game. This is a children's card game that nobody cares about and that is why I added you to furiously berate you about your lack of skill and/or genitals.
hearthstonecirclejerk,36320e,Pseudopsyence,4,Sat May 16 00:57:20 2015 UTC,Lol no offence but you must not have been playing more than like what 2 days XDXD??? EDIT: My advice: GIT GUDD NUB XDXD AAYYYY LMAO XS

After that you can have enough packs to literally get every single card in the game and finally enter ranked play (you need all of them p2win amirite?).

hearthstonecirclejerk,32ey9r,EndaSmith,19,Mon Apr 13 06:15:32 2015 UTC,"I have spent the past hour trying to play this deck, however, I fear that I have only begun to scratch the surface of its incredible depth and complexity. I will describe my last struggle trying to tackle this deck in the hopes that somebody here can aid me. I apologise if my account seems simplistic and demonstrates a clear lack of understanding, I am a writer not a Hearthstone professional like Xixo.  I stared blankly at my already used hero power for what seemed like hours, contemplating the meaning of life and death and wondering why ""I will hunt you down"" kept appearing next to my forlorn expression. Eventually a rope appeared burning down towards nothingness. Despite it having already happened every single turn so far this alarmed me and I moderately quickly leapt into action. Just before the rope finished burning I managed to hit the end turn button, no small feat, and greeted my opponent as a sign of goodwill.  The next turn the cards just kept flying from my hand, propelled not by thought or any logical pattern but simply by the hatred of seeing a number greater than zero next to my opponent's portrait. I wish that I could say that I understand what I was doing now but in all honesty it is beyond me.   My white hot rage had somehow managed to overcome the complexity and it wasn't long before I had my opponent within death's reach. Then what I can only describe as a vision of Satan appeared before me. Beelzebub himself conspired against me to  summon what a horrid message repeatedly described as a ""taunt"" in front of me.   I had never lain eyes on such an abomination and I hope never to do so again. Every attempt I made to damage the face was dream-crushingly disallowed by this contemptuous message. It directed me to attack the taunt, however, I feared its supernatural powers and stayed away.  Of course I lost that game due to the foul hand of Satan, however, I wonder if there is a way that I can protect myself from being afflicted by such a scourge in future attempts to understand this deck. Does anybody know a way to scare away these demons? I am not above sacrificing animals, as long as I can steal them from the streets or neighbours because I am strictly F2P."

Instead try to defend a dishonest woman who scammed people for money, and had other professionals playing on her account.. Celerity didn't seem like he wanted to accuse Amy of anything besides their whole money issue, but after talking to him in MagicAmy's Twitch chat he even admitted he played on her account for her, and that last time he watched her play she was far from a professional level, and likely hasn't improved enough in that short amount of time to be capable of winning that esl tournament by herself or to be placing high in legend...

I took over after that last hunter nerfing idiot, so I havent had time to fix the game yet!   But hints of what is incoming: Mech warper is now 0 to cost and a hunter minion. Skill command is 7 damage (so you dont need to buff it with spellpower), requires 0 mana and ofc no beast requirement. Undertaker is back to normal (+ getting a secret buff).   Goblin fire mage and Arcane shot switches place in library, I never felt the need for arcane shot as hunter, the word arcane sounds more magey, and hunters obviously could need a goblin fire mage, wich ofc is getting a dethrattle (does 4 damage more to random enemy) this to get more synergy towards rewamped undertaker, undertaker itself also gets a dethrattle to synergize with multiple undertakers!"

When people ask for advice on how to counter popular decks, what they actually want is to hear hyperbolic bitching about popular decks.  Make sure to upvote hysterical whining and overused jokes, while downvoting actual answers and suggestions, so that people can't actually learn anything and the game can't progress.  Because we all know that it's literally impossible to beat a popular deck.  It does make sense, though.  Mech Mage literally has a 100% win rate, and people only play other decks because they're too honorable to take free wins."

hearthstonecirclejerk,2t5lgs,Zhyler,4,Wed Jan 21 09:13:24 2015 UTC,I really feel like the buffs to undertaker are well thought out and very creative. This will definitely push more players to play hunter as now undertaker is a beast which means you can have 4 of him with webspinner. I think a proper nerf for the op magma rager would to be to make him 10 mana deal 30 damage to your hero as a 1/1.
hearthstonecirclejerk,2t1jey,Pseudopsyence,3,Tue Jan 20 11:42:02 2015 UTC,Way too slow.  Hunters won't have room for this in their decks.  This is just a win-more card.

hearthstonecirclejerk,2rly2u,Pseudopsyence,17,Wed Jan 7 07:47:37 2015 UTC,"After carefully reading your excelence In-depth analysis, ive reached the conclusion that Dr.Boom needs a buff.   7/7 main body is no more than a nub common golem, and he is supposed to be le-gender-y? I know the gender y is = girl, but still, he should be at least 8/9 wich is fair cause then he gets 1 stat for each upgrade rare/epic/legg=3.   His arms is crossed in the pictures art, wich signals insecurity, he need new upgraded art where he is more secure.   The bombs should hit the target you want to hit, just like in real life! This I feel would add the realistic touch HS is know for across the galaxy.   A guy(edit grill=) with bombs protects himself, so he should have divine shield.   Finally the casting cost should probably be around 1-2, I for once would like to see more synergy towards the undertaker here, as a pro hunter myself games are mostly over before I even get a chance to play Dr.Boom and I really feel Blizzard did a bad job making him impossible to cool-combo in round 2, it would still take the normal 3-4 rounds to win anyway and he could be easily removed by opponents concede."

hearthstonecirclejerk,2oqnjr,Feerox,9,Tue Dec 9 09:12:46 2014 UTC,"Recycle Compared to Siphon Soul, this spell seems somewhat overcosted - however, in my opinion it is a far superior. While Siphon Soul has a fixed return of +3hp, kill minion Recycle's expected return is far more varied. When used on cards like Ysera, or Ragnaros, you are essentially giving them a free huge threat to play later. At the same time, and most importantly however you will benefit from this greatly when your opponent requires a specific draw to win or recover from a losing position. In summary, recycle does one or more of the following at the cost of gaining 3 less health vs Siphon Soul: Reduces your opponent's chance to draw a key card by X% Screws you by giving your opponent another big threat in fatigue range Silence and destroy deathrattle Destroy a minion, bypass on-death effects i,e Cult / KV Recombobulator The Recomboulator in constructed is somewhat of a win more card. It gains absurd value only if you can trade favourably that turn while having 2 extra mana to spend to cast him. Generally in constructed, minions which will gain value from recomboulator don't last very long - even if they do, guaranteeing a good trade is even harder. Priests and Druid have cards like Cabal Shadow Priest and Ancient of Lore who's power is in the on-play effect, and are otherwise weak. High health creatures and ones prone to silence will also love to play Recombobulator. These specific situations aside, It is hard to extract value from Recomboulator normally since you should already be using the strongest cards for it's mana cost, meaning you seldom get an upgrade. We can then reason that it is a situationally superior earthen farseer for 1 less mana and has 1 less health, so decks which already heals their minions with farseer might enjoy this card. Unstable Portal Contrary to popular belief, playing unstable portal turn 2 in constructed will more often than not be a nightmare than a dream. The ""best case"" for Unstable Portal is to draw into a game swining legendary - most of which, even at 3 less mana is a dead card for another several turns. Standard decks simply cannot afford the risk of skipping a turn 2, especially when the most favourable outcome of the turn 2 skip is to get a 5 drop ragnaros / 6 drop ysera. The 1 mana discount is a trap I feel many players will fall into. ""Winning games"" with a turn 3 Sylvannas / Highmane to argue for turn 2 unstable portal is a common gambler's fallacy when the maths is clearly points to the contrary of turn 2 unstable portal. Correct use of the card in constructed is yet to be seen, but you can be assured turn 2 empty unstable portal is terrible. Even if it was your ""only option"" you could have drafted a real 2 drop instead, so it's still inexcusable. As with a lot of GvG cards, however if you're way behind already by turn 2 and need to gamble to win, there's no better card for it on turn 2. Ancestor's Call This card has been severely misjudged as far as I can tell. One would think that it's random and you could mess up massively. I could talk about this card all day, but tl;dr Ancestor's call out your own large solid threat when your opponent likely has Ragnaros / Ysera / Ancient of War / Ancient of Lore / Cabal Shadow Priest etc. You get your huge guy on the board and trade even with their summoned creature, except you draw from Ysera that turn and they dont, your ragnaros shoots and theirs doesn't, War is a 5/5, Lore doesn't draw cards. I think you get the picture. Implosion Absolutely insane card 1/3 of the time. Rolling a 4 with knife juggler on board is even more insane. The fact that it sucks 1/3 of the time can be offset by the value achieved through buffing tokens which did not cost a card to be generated. So I suspect an implosion deck should be buff heavy. Knife juggler already being a staple in zoo makes the card reasonable without building around it. It is similar to hellfire, in that it's either a dead card or wins you a game you would have lost. Shadow Boxer Priest's knife juggler, and should be treated just as dangerously. With Light of the Naruu, Pyromancers, Circles of Healings etc you'll see this card get more value than knife juggler on the turn it is played, and fair value in subsequent turns. An easy way to evaluate this card is whether you think a knife juggler preists can proc consistently is good. I suspect some players will find it has no place in their deck. I for one, think this card is Godly. Since priests now have ""the dream"" mana curve of top tier cards. (Priest, Shadow Boxer, Cultist) Explosive Sheep Combined with Poision Seeds, this is an equality + consecreation that bypasses divine shields. It is fine when played on it's own in 1v1 situations - since If it is not silenced or killed using additional resources from your opponent, it represents 3 damage to whatever it's attacking, and still deals 2 damage if your opponent spends resources to destroy it. tl;dr unless silenced it's a positive tempo card. Feign Death This card has a bad name for being ""win more"", but when used in conjunction with explosive sheep it's a 2 mana consecreate you have to play twice, gives hunters mind control potential with sylvannas, summons two 2/2 beasts for 2 mana with highmane. Let me just be straight in regards to this card. Any deck which is built around this card will benefit hugely from it. With the expection of Warrior, all other classes have abilities that can affect the board state, so the 2 mana better spent else where in many cases. With hunter, you have nothing else to use your 2 mana for. The flexibility of the card is really what makes it fantastic. Especially since strong death rattles are cheap as dirt for hunters (nerubian eggs, loot hoarders, mad scientist etc) Circle of Healing is perhaps the easiest card to compare this one to. The times where you get high value from the card makes up for the amount of times it's a dead card. Ship's Cannon Pirates are -almost viable- with this card. Problem is they are still lacking a solid vanillia 1 and 3 curve, and that captain's parrot is still garbage. It does address the issue that summoning 3/3 for 0 in pirate weapon decks doesn't gain you enough tempo as a ""best case scenario play"" by letting you deal 4 damage to board for ""free"" (you get a 2/3 body). A pirate deck will be interesting, but honestly turn 2 parrot (required to make the combo consisent enough to be viable) is just too slow. But hey, you still have the turn 2 War Axe, Turn 3 Coin > Cannon Double 3/3 pirate dream. Steam Wheedle Sniper Would you play a 2/3 battlecry deal 2 damage for 4 mana in hunter? If so, this card is for you. Otherwise, it's gimmicky. The curve is just too awkward. Paying 2 mana to deal 2 damage in constructed stops you from developing your board, resources spent keeping your shitty guy alive so you can ping for 2 dmg is better spent keeping your highmane and other big threats alive later. Shrinkmeister I suspect young brewmaster to be good now, since it was close in priest for use in conjunction with shadow madness. Imagine a deck with Brewmasters to get more Shrink Meister + Shadow madness / Cabal Shadow Priests combos and just think about how annoying that is. Not to mention priests can Shadow Madness > Recombobulate / Brewmaster your cards.  Sorry for the long post. I havnt copied it and i almost spent 5 hours on it"
