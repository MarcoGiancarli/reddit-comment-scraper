Actos was the tenth-best selling drug in the U.S. in 2008, with sales exceeding $2.4 billion.[1] While pioglitazone does decrease blood sugar levels, studies on the main cardiovascular outcomes has not yielded statistically significant results.[2] Its cardiovascular safety profile compares favorably with rosiglitazone (Avandia), which was withdrawn after concerns about an increased risk of cardiac events.
