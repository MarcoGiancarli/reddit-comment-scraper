Aquarius's key did break, but Lucy has the parts of the key, so maybe somewhere in Alveraz, someone could fix it. But we might not be able to ever see Aquarius again. She was Lucy's first sprit ;-;. So sad.."
fairytail,3e3stm,RobloxGirlClone,2,Tue Jul 21 19:33:36 2015 UTC,I really loved the relationship between them! I deeply hope that they key can be repaired

fairytail,3e3stm,Yodude1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:45:39 2015 UTC,I think he gave her the power but Aquarius was temporarily because it seems like you need the spirit out to put on the outfit
fairytail,3e3stm,thederpyguide,-1,Tue Jul 21 21:16:04 2015 UTC,"I hated Aquarius. Worst fucking teammate ever, she just fucks over Lucy time and time again. Honestly shes probably better off without her.  That being said, im a firm believer we will see her once more. Too much unresolved mystery going on with the 12 golden keys to just completely get rid of one forever. Plus Aquarius is just chilling in the celestial spirit world, so its not even that big of a deal :P. I think its a plot on the back burner right now, since we seem to be getting into the real nitty gritty of the main plot."
fairytail,3e2aow,Mimmei,5,Tue Jul 21 12:15:58 2015 UTC,"I honestly think she has quite the power up now its just a shame that she will always be outshone. Like you see her using the stardress stuff and then to the side of that Natsu has just one shot some giant ass monster. Poor Lucy just always ends up not living up to her potential, like in GMG when it finally looks like she is going to do some epic move against Fleur and then that is stripped away last minute. I so hope she gets something good soon and doesn't end up just being fan service forever."
fairytail,3e2aow,Izetha,4,Tue Jul 21 12:35:20 2015 UTC,"It's not that she doesn't live to her potential it's more that she gets out shined by the more powerful, it's like if night wing becomes a badass and shows how strong he is, he will always be in the shadow of batman, superman, and wonderwoman."

fairytail,3e2aow,Damanos,4,Tue Jul 21 17:43:22 2015 UTC,I'm really excited to see Cana's new potential tbh. I hope she can finally control her latent power that even Mavis acknowledged.
fairytail,3e2aow,Retawes,3,Tue Jul 21 15:56:51 2015 UTC,"I will say she is could potentially be top tier now. I mean Scorpio Star dress should be immensely powerful given Scorpio can generate and manipulate an endless amount sand. I would say Scorpio Star dress should be around DF Wendy level if not superior because Sand is denser. Then you have her Gemini Star dress in which it would allow her to transform into other people. Her magical power seems to be up there with some of the top mages. She also has Aquarius mode in which she can generate and manipulate water. The water was also powerful enough to block jackal nukes. If she can combine Keys then she would be immensely powerful and her magical power would be off the charts.  From what Virgo said Star dress increases the users magical power so if she was to use all 9 of her zodiac keys and we say with each key her magical power doubles then her magical power if it increases exponentially would be 1596x stronger. If it increases Arithmetical then her power would be 27x stronger. If you add in some silver keys then her magical power will increase a little more. Not only would her power increase but so would her celestial spirits power. Also she wouldn't really have any vulnerable spots. With Crux she would be extremely smart and knowledgeable, with Horologium and Aries she would have great defense and with Sagittarius he aim would be amazing. With Taurus her physical strength would be great and with the other spirits she could use long distance of short distance attacks. Also with Gemini she can fly."

fairytail,3dux9b,NightfallDragoSlayer,5,Mon Jul 20 03:15:40 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, although I feel having the magic is enough to qualify them.  Making cobra second gen was stupid though.

fairytail,3dux9b,Billy-Orcinus,2,Mon Jul 20 13:01:13 2015 UTC,"I still think they should be considered dragon slayers. They weren't taught by dragons, but they still have the magic to use it. Being taught by a dragon, well gifted was the main way to do it. But all in all if you can use the magic, you're a dragon slayer.   Plus being 1st generation doesn't necessarily make you stronger, or better. I mean look at Laxus, he's stronger than all the current dragon slayers. Also now? I'd say he could take on rogue and sting, or even natsu and gajeel while combined 2 on 1 pretty easily. Also he could beat cobra but he's probably on par with sting and rogue. (Not mentionIng Wendy because he'd wipe the floor with Wendy)"

fairytail,3dycz3,scrawlx101,4,Mon Jul 20 15:18:29 2015 UTC,"Dunno but Freed really needs some attention, after battle of fairy tail he was made kinda weak, I wanna see him get some fights, as for Laxus I think Ichiya said Laxus is in Blue pegasus but is always out training."
fairytail,3dycz3,Rexzar,6,Mon Jul 20 15:57:48 2015 UTC,"I think they have been always powerful, and as for this arc, I think Freed will be -Mirajane tier (Gajeel, Juvia? Not sure). Bickslow, a bit less strong than Freed, maybe as strong as Lucy or Elfman. I hope so, at least. My fav character on the series is Freed, so I hope he recieves some love!! :)"
fairytail,3dycz3,momohowl,2,Mon Jul 20 15:27:53 2015 UTC,"In fairness most of Blue Pegasus aren't that powerful. We never really see Jenny's power, but seeing as Mira one-shot her pretty effortlessly she can't be that great. Ichiya is very powerful as demonstrated vs Bacchus, but he's not really ""ace"" material. The Trimens aren't that strong either. Hibiki is basically useless in a fight, seeing as his is magic non-combative. Plus Ren and Eve together were still one-shot by Gajeel. With all of that said I'm hoping Freed is a beast."
fairytail,3dycz3,LeRandomNoob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:16:07 2015 UTC,Given tehy spend more time at blue pegasus than Laxus I would not expect that much of an improvement
fairytail,3dycz3,Milguas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:06:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah they are helping, Laxus probably isn't even apart, they probably convinced him and he's just off training and doing stuff. Totally see him in this arc against one of the spriggan 12. I have a feeling it won't be a big fight, totally will be a take him out in under 5 minutes like Laxus does since he's OP as shit."
fairytail,3dycz3,RossNub,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:47:00 2015 UTC,Precisely. He has no time to waste bonding with the host club guild
fairytail,3dycz3,Milguas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:59:27 2015 UTC,"Freed has got to be pretty strong. He pulled a draw against Mira(although she did not fight at her fullest) and that's in combat. Give the man time to prepare and he can beat almost anyone. Besides he's been a lot more focused after that skirmish, and he seemed stronger on Tenrou. I would not say Natsu, Erza or Gray level strength (and probably not Gajeel either), and definitely not Laxus or Gildarts, but I think those are the only members of Fairytail who can beat him.  Bickslow's pretty strong too considering he handled Loke, Lucy and Happy, however, he would have lost to Gray had it not been for Freeds runes, so he's definitely not Gray tier strength.   With training it is hard to tell. Mashima can make them all-powerfull or weaklings. And honestly we can't tell which it is gonna be."
fairytail,3dycz3,Terosan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:40:03 2015 UTC,what about cana and juvia how do they compare? is freed gay or just really respectful of laxus?
fairytail,3dycz3,Terosan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:56:53 2015 UTC,"Cana lost severely to Freed. He didn't even transform. Of course now she has Fairy Glitter, but so far she hasn't used it well.  And Juvia is pretty weak, unless she get's pushed to far. When Gray is involved she can fight with a power that strikes fear into even Erza - though not on Erza's level. Juvia's true strength is hard to figure out, but it was enough to push Gray and defeat Meredy. But since it is very hard to force it out of her, it's unclear if she would use it in actual combat against Freed."

fairytail,3dysk8,BlueCuracao,4,Mon Jul 20 17:13:56 2015 UTC,Do we even know if this is true anymore? Couldn't Rogue and Stings implanted lacrima just been part of the false memory their dragons placed to think they had killed them?
fairytail,3dysk8,tormentedthoughts,2,Mon Jul 20 22:56:13 2015 UTC,I've been wondering this myself. And given how Wendy can use dragon force on her own now that cannot be attributed to the lacrima's either.

fairytail,3dws4x,reigun91,2,Mon Jul 20 05:33:27 2015 UTC,"Just read both mangastream and mangapanda.  Generally, mangastream is editted to flow better, mangapanda is more literal.  If the translator isn't knowledgeable about the series (or derps), then the mangastream might say something flat out wrong.  Ex: this latest chapter of FT, mangastream just flat out says the wrong thing about the great magics."

fairytail,3dve8z,ChocolateTacoFilms,2,Sun Jul 19 21:37:59 2015 UTC,"I think you should watch it, it's reference one in the GMG so if you wanna get why its said then watch it. It's a good arc atleast in my opinion you get to see Mirajane fight um well its kinda hard to explain what she fights without spoiling it but WATCH IT JUST FOR THAT FIGHT!"
fairytail,3dve8z,sardinemanR,2,Mon Jul 20 08:42:03 2015 UTC,"It is standard FT fare, I'd say watch it. It's better than the Ophius summons arc, and the filler after that by far.   I've watched every FT episode, I wouldn't want to just skip episodes, they all go by so fast. I wouldn't ever re-watch the filler arcs whereas I'd re-watch some of the other arcs like the Grand Magic Games, but I don't see why you'd just skip anything if you'd never seen it.  But I am a huge fan of the series so YMMV."
fairytail,3dve8z,Shispanic,2,Mon Jul 20 09:27:02 2015 UTC,"It isn't as bad as everyone says it is, yes it isn't canon and not as well written as the rest of the series (probably because Mashima wasn't the one writing it), but I would at least try watching a few episodes and then decide if you want to finish it or not. I personally like it a lot, and gives Lucy some closure with her father (somewhat unnecessary, but good all the same.) If you are a busy person and want to continue with the canon story, skip it and come back and try when you have time. Otherwise try it and decide for yourself, other people can only tell you so much."
fairytail,3dve8z,PissedOffBiotic,4,Sun Jul 19 21:19:09 2015 UTC,KoTSS actually is canon. It's referenced in the manga and the magic Oracion Seis uses is the same they do in the manga.
fairytail,3dve8z,Shispanic,2,Sun Jul 19 21:25:04 2015 UTC,"Ahh, forgot, it just wasn't written by Mashima. I find it interesting that he was comfortable making something he didn't write canon to the story, not that it matters much because they only reference it that one time (during Tartaros) and by magic I think you're referring to Angel summoning those weird ghost type monsters in place of celestial spirits?)"
fairytail,3dve8z,PissedOffBiotic,3,Sun Jul 19 21:38:49 2015 UTC,Angel's magic  Racer's new magic  Midnight's nightmares  Mashima works much more closely with the anime studio than many other mangaka.  He designed the Eclipsed Celestial Spirits.  It wouldn't surprise me if he told the studio what magic to give them as he had plans for them.
fairytail,3dve8z,Milguas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:42:47 2015 UTC,Cobras character design too. His GMG look was identical to his starry sky one
fairytail,3dve8z,Shispanic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:05:46 2015 UTC,"I think Angel is the only new one, Racer still uses time distortion magic and Midnight always had illusion magic the only thing he has differently in KoTSS is Zero's magic/Genesis Zero (spoiler is for OP if they decide to watch.)"
fairytail,3dve8z,PissedOffBiotic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:47:14 2015 UTC,"My bad, I thought the nightmare magic was new.    And I thought Racer got knew magic because of that animalistic nature."
fairytail,3dve8z,TheUltimateTeigu,3,Sun Jul 19 21:51:55 2015 UTC,Cobra's new look as well. Mashima worked on this arc though. So it's even more canon.

fairytail,3dve8z,ChickenPlunger,2,Sun Jul 19 22:40:56 2015 UTC,I heard that he was gonna make it in the manga but decided to skip it because the anime was getting too close.

fairytail,3drvju,Skydanzer,-2,Sat Jul 18 21:40:53 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I prefer Elie to Lucy, as she was a freakin badass when she stepped up her game for Haru. Lucy hasn't done anything of this sort Summoning of CSK is kinda like that, but not really in my book"

fairytail,3drvju,Milguas,0,Sat Jul 18 22:56:37 2015 UTC,Key of the Starry skies is not filler as it was mentioned in the manga during the GMG
fairytail,3drvju,thederpyguide,2,Sat Jul 18 22:34:56 2015 UTC,It's easier to explain it as filler now unless they get major roles in the plot of the manga we probably still will refer to them as filler just to make it easier when they technically are cannon
fairytail,3drvju,Billy-Orcinus,14,Sun Jul 19 00:44:14 2015 UTC,"Lucy is not a fighter, she is the one who us, the audience, is supposed to relate to. We all see the Fairy Tail universe through her eyes because Lucy and we people ""joined"" the Fairy Tail guild together in the first episode/chapter. Having said this, Lucy is not going to be one shoting enemies in the beginning of the series. Later on I am positive that Lucy will become as much of a tank as Happy(Fairy Tails strongest wizard) :|   Also Lucy HAS taken down several tough enemies. For instance, that giant octopus in Edolas, Angel and others."
fairytail,3drvju,Billy-Orcinus,2,Sat Jul 18 23:20:14 2015 UTC,Ok then i kinda understand why she is the way she is. Ok Thanks that really makes me happy. :D

fairytail,3drvju,FireHawkDelta,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:45:30 2015 UTC,Lucy being useless. For example all the way back in the Phantom Lord arc. If not for Lucy Natsu would've died to Gajeel. After that she saved Natsu who was incapacitated from being on a raft during the oracion seis arc. During the GMG her future self came back to the past to warn everyone of the doomed future waiting for them and then even died. AFter that she closed the gate with Yukino which made it so only 7 dragons came through instead of 10K  of them. Don't even bring up Tartaros. So no OP is just another stupid Lucy hater.
fairytail,3drvju,Naw207,3,Sat Jul 18 22:58:21 2015 UTC,"If not for Lucy Natsu would've died to Gajeel.   To be fair, that wouldn't even happen if she didn't run away from home"
fairytail,3drvju,thecubanguy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:28:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not a Lucy hater, Lucy is one of my favorite characters in the show. Also im just saying my opinion. Yes she has done the things you said but she could have done more. AGAIN MY PERSONAL OPINION. Also like i said i'm not in FT 2014 so i dont know what she does in the future. Spoiler tag please."
fairytail,3drvju,RossNub,-1,Sat Jul 18 23:32:14 2015 UTC,"Okay, when we're talking about usefulness we have to consider, how useful is this character in comparison to what another character COULD do? By this I mean, if I were to take any other character from the series and put her in any of Lucy's situations, would he/she be just as useful as Lucy herself. Is there anything special about Lucy that no one else has?   For Phantom Lord: You say that Lucy saves Natsu. But how though? She does it by feeding Natsu flames so he can regain his strength, and the way she does it is by causing the machinery to explode. The thing is, Lucy never thought of causing those machines to explode. It was Sagittarius that came up with the idea to explode those machines to produce fire, thus saving Natsu. Yeah, Lucy's power revolves around her spirits helping her, but that doesn't change the fact she wasn't able to figure out for herself a way to save Natsu, and I bet a whole bunch of characters would have figured it out.  For Oracion Seis: Ok, she saved Natsu from a raft. Not exactly a hard thing to do. I could tell a 10 year old to do that and he would get it done. Lucy just happened to be in the right place at the right time, wasn't anything special.   For the GMG: It's true her future self came back to the past to warn everyone, but isn't that the logical thing to do? If you had an opportunity to warn everyone of impending doom, would you not? Anyone else would do it, it's just no one else except for Lucy could do it because all of her friends were dead. Also, can we even classify future Lucy as Lucy? She's not the same Lucy as the present day one. That's why we even differentiate her in the first place.  Then present-day Lucy closes the Eclipse Gate. Except when tried to do it herself she couldn't. She never even thought of summoning her spirits to close it, Yukino was the one that had the idea, not Lucy. If Yukino was not there, that Gate was never going to close.   For Tartaros: Yeah, Lucy is a badass in this arc. No one can argue against that. It's probably the first time she's done something incredibly useful for the guild.   The fact of the matter is Lucy really is not anything special. Aside from what she did in Tartaros, she hasn't done anything impressive, and whatever she has done could most of the time be done by someone else. She reminds me of Sakura to be honest, except Sakura is actually one of the stronger characters as far as Naruto standards go. Lucy, not-so-much."
fairytail,3drvju,Flametoss456,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:42:28 2015 UTC,What's wrong with it. And i watched it dubbed so there were months between episodes so things are forgotten
fairytail,3drvju,Blackheart595,2,Sat Jul 18 22:46:16 2015 UTC,Phantom Lord arc. If not for Lucy Natsu would have died to Gajeel.   She saved Loki who is a member of the guild   She saved JUVIA from being mind controled by that gene simmons freak during the Tower of Heaven arc  list goes on and on and on. You just have to look. That and you should not define useful by how big of a bang they make during a fight. You seem to think powerhouse = the only useful ones.
fairytail,3drvju,Blackheart595,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:59:48 2015 UTC,"She gets a lot better in Tartarus when you catch up. Some people here(me included) don't find her useless, but I guess it can be easy to forget/ignore some of her good things. That becomes nearly impossible in Tartarus. So get hyped."
fairytail,3drvju,Shispanic,2,Sun Jul 19 03:16:45 2015 UTC,"Oh lord how can you say she's useless. She literally saved Natsu various times, fought and won against an OS member, managed to solve all the GMG stuff (with help, ofc), was freaking awesome in Tartarus arc and has gained cool power ups recently. She is actually a pretty useful character. Maybe not the best fighter at all, but she's very smart and knows about a lot of usefull stuff (and Crux is literally the most useful thing/magic in case you need  to know something coff coff GMG, and dont say that Celestial Spirits count as different characters because they are HER magic and HER power). She is definitely useful! :)"

fairytail,3dqi1a,Athentis,2,Sun Jul 19 01:56:30 2015 UTC,"I find it interesting that you like Edolas the most (I don't have any problem with it, but from my experience it is one of the most hated canon arcs). I'm glad you enjoy the series, and enjoy the sub as well. Only one question, sub or dub?"
fairytail,3dqi1a,Shispanic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:04:52 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say Edolas is my favorite overall, mainly because I haven't watched it all yet! But I didn enjoy it and it's interesting to hear people's reasons for not liking it as much as other arcs.   As far as format? I watch subbed mainly, but would like to watch some dubbed. I like voice acting in all of it's forms, and like to hear the different interpretations of the characters."
fairytail,3dqi1a,Shispanic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:10:37 2015 UTC,"Ah I see, you have the majority of canon arcs covered, but Grand Magic Games (and Tartaros which is after GMG) are amazing. Good call on the anime, I watch the sub (but I started with the dub) both are fantastic, but the dub is released in such big intervals that I can't wait."
fairytail,3dqi1a,AstonishingSpiderMan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:36:46 2015 UTC,"OK! So I've thought a lot about it. The ""Best Girl"" title is not one easily or lightly bestowed.   My first reflex would be to say Erza, as she is immensely powerful, loves theater, enjoys cooking, and is ready for almost anything. But, she remains fairly static throughout the parts of the series I've gotten through so far. Not a ton of marked growth.  I adore Levy, but I really see her as like my best friends little sister; really cool, super cute, fun to talk to because of her high intellect, but just not my type.  Juvia, while romantic and doting, can be a bit fickle.   Due to her astounding growth and untapped power, her ability to find the light in every situation, and having a weakness for her friends, I would call Lucy best girl. in my opinion, she's the glue of the group and she can only improve her standing and abilities.   Lucy is best girl."

fairytail,3dssya,gulagmann,7,Sun Jul 19 12:22:02 2015 UTC,"Oh dear, hello, I'm from /r/k_on and we wish you no harm, we do have cakes though.     That thread is by no means a collaboration by the sub and while I personally like poking fun at these things a little bit it's just meant in good fun, I profusely apologize if anyone was offended by anything on our sub. My opinion on these brackets are that they are silly and pointless, and there is no need to be upset.     I think we can come to an agreement that every girl in both Fairy Tail and K-On are all best girls, because life is better with cute girls and cute girls with swords.  PS: Your sub style is really nice."
fairytail,3dssya,derek_453,3,Sun Jul 19 03:44:13 2015 UTC,"Alright, I accept your peace treaty,  For now.."
fairytail,3dssya,gulagmann,3,Sun Jul 19 03:45:15 2015 UTC,"I'm glad! May our subreddits co-exist for years to come, I sincerely hope you guys have a great series ahead of you."
fairytail,3dssya,derek_453,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:57:48 2015 UTC,It's no problem.  All in good fun ^.^  I do plan on watching K-On though. I hear it's a good show.
fairytail,3dssya,gulagmann,2,Sun Jul 19 04:00:50 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to hear that! It's not for everyone but it is one of the more approachable series that have the ""cute girls doing cute things"" theme. It has a very good soundtrack, likeable characters and a very relaxing atmosphere, and of course it's very moe moe kyun.  Feel free to drop by /r/k_on at any time, we'd be happy to have you visit."
fairytail,3dssya,derek_453,2,Sun Jul 19 04:11:16 2015 UTC,If it has a very good soundtrack then sign me up :)  I'll stop by and check out /r/k_on
fairytail,3dssya,gulagmann,2,Sun Jul 19 04:22:43 2015 UTC,"I hope you enjoy your stay. Oh man, I'm so jealous of how many flairs you guys have."
fairytail,3dssya,AstonishingSpiderMan,3,Sun Jul 19 04:29:52 2015 UTC,The members that worked on the flairs did a good job. They put in a lot of effort and it showed.
fairytail,3dssya,derek_453,2,Sun Jul 19 04:42:03 2015 UTC,"It definitely does, we only have one poor guy making flairs. We pay him minimum wage, call him weird (but loveable) things and we feed him - ""occasionally""."
fairytail,3dssya,Billy-Orcinus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:46:09 2015 UTC,Sounds familiar
fairytail,3dssya,Billy-Orcinus,0,Sun Jul 19 12:26:44 2015 UTC,Well as long as you guys feed him then we're good
fairytail,3dssya,Dafurgen,3,Sun Jul 19 04:55:19 2015 UTC,"You appointed me to General am I right? And as General I say we stand down...for now. As long as we all know Fairy Tail girls are Best Girls, that's enough of a victory for us. They can live in their delusions because they won something in a bias filled match. And that's no victory my friend, just a delusion. I am not a coward by saying all this, it's just that I want to protect everyone on this sub from the horrors of a cross sub war. I've seen it take place first hand, all the agony and pain is just awful. I would be heartbroken if a member went off to post an attack thread and never logged back on again..."
fairytail,3dssya,spanishmonkey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:27:20 2015 UTC,"Alright. I'll follow your orders Geberal. It's touching to see that my general cares about his overlord(yes,I'm your overlord)."

fairytail,3dq04b,cutterschrute,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:09:43 2015 UTC,If it's out in october that means we most likely will get a delay for the dub stream again...

fairytail,3dr7yu,brabroke,18,Sat Jul 18 18:00:58 2015 UTC,"Edolas is not just a mirror dimension like you're making it out to be. It's a whole parallel world with its own culture and traditions. The citizens of Edolas may be physically identical to their twins in Earthland but they are entirely different people. Take Porlyusica, for example. Remember that she is Grandine's Edolas counterpart. Grandine and the other dragons are 400+ years old, yet Porlyusica is in her late 50s/early 60s probably."
fairytail,3dr7yu,CoconutPalmie,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:35:57 2015 UTC,"Including all the different last names, etc. I agree. They are physically identical, but entirely different. It would be very easy then, to have EdoNatsu running around because he does not have the same backstory."
fairytail,3dr7yu,terazosin,3,Sat Jul 18 18:42:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why people thought the Dragon Invasion Arc was the actual Dragon Festival. There were no demons for one, and it just didn't seem like it to me in the first place. So I want surprised at all to hear that the actual DF was going to take place at another time, not to mention Acnologia seemed to be a necessary member for the DF to take place. Edolas also doesn't follow the current timeline exactly. Wendy isn't as old in Earthland as she is in Edolas, so that shows you something right there. Same with Porlyusica not being over 400 years old like Grandeeny should be."
fairytail,3dr7yu,TheUltimateTeigu,-3,Sat Jul 18 18:42:28 2015 UTC,"we dont know if Grandeeny is over 400 years old though, she could be a young dragon. still, 400 years in diffrience sounds way too big in contrast"
fairytail,3dr7yu,TheBlonkh,2,Sat Jul 18 18:51:48 2015 UTC,"Well, concerning Natsu's age, the only thing I could think of as an explanation is that Edolas is a similar but still different world, where multiple things are different, which can include Natsu's birth date. It's still lazy, but it can't be helped I guess."
fairytail,3dr7yu,Dudley-Jong-un,2,Sat Jul 18 18:27:39 2015 UTC,What was the timeline error from the GMG?
fairytail,3dr7yu,AmateurPhysicist,-1,Sat Jul 18 18:40:31 2015 UTC,"They destoryed the portal, resulted all dragon in current timeline been reverted... this shouldnt happen because well... the dragon is already here...   another major one is the dragon. Atlas have clear memory of the event, however Zinnicon didn't have the memory. It is possible reversion in timeline can cause memory not present, then howcome Atlas remenbered it? If Atlas remenbered the event, then it wouldn't be a timeline reversion, then how would those dragon disappear  its basically time travel paradox"
fairytail,3dr7yu,Dudley-Jong-un,2,Sat Jul 18 18:45:12 2015 UTC,"This most likely isn't a scientific explanation, but it does help to explain why Atlas remembered Natsu.  The dragons disappeared because the portal was destroyed before Rogue could come back in time and have it opened, which means that it was never opened because it was destroyed before it could be open.. Consequentially this means that the timeline was completely fucked up in every way possible and took some time to recover, and so before in this sense doesn't exactly mean chronologically before.   Prior to all this, Ultear cast Last Ages, which rewound the timeline by one minute, saving everyone. How did it save everyone? They saw their future. They saw themselves die, and were able to avoid their deaths because they were able to think quickly and take the offense. However, they shouldn't have been able to do this, because    Because time was rewound, the future versions of the characters didn't exist yet.  Since they saw into their futures and were able to save themselves, those versions of them never actually existed in the first place.    This leaves one explanation: When the Eclipse Gate was opened, it caused the timeline to splinter into the original timeline and at least two other parallel splinters. One of those splinters suddenly ended when Ultear cast Last Ages. The memories of the now nonexistent future versions of the characters merged with those of the others and they were able to save themselves. Since Last Ages requires the caster to sacrifice their own time, it affected the Ultear in the other time splinters and she became an old woman, along with attaining those memories of the now nonexistent Ultear.   Meanwhile, since the timeline was still splintered, when the Eclipse Gate was destroyed, it caused all remaining splinters to completely collapse back into a single timeline, causing all the dragons to disappear--since they were never actually brought through the gate in the first place (see the first paragraph)--yet leaving behind all the destruction caused by them in Crocus. Later on, it is revealed that Mest manipulated the memories of the Magic Council to hide the fact that the royal family used Zeref's magic and unwittingly allowed multiple real dragons into the city. This could indicate that either the city never righted itself while the timeline healed itself, or it did, but the council would still be able to recall the whole dragon ordeal despite not having been there to witness it in person.   Meanwhile, since the timeline collapsed, Atlas was able to remember his time with Natsu, or at least he was able to remember Natsu because the memories of his alternate self merged with his own when the timeline collapsed, much in the way everyone else's did when Ultear cast Last Ages and ended that particular splinter of time.   One reason why Zirconis didn't remember Wendy or the others could be that he was under Rogue's influence for the entirety of the Eclipse Gate event, so he probably didn't retain those memories until and after his death. However, Atlas was able to break free from that same influence upon hearing that Natsu was Igneel's son, and so he had his own will and consciousness back, allowing him to retain those memories. Another reason could be that his ghost was summoned before the timeline got fucked up and was therefore unaffected by the events that would later happen in the pastfuture.   TL;DR: I can't think of one for this."
fairytail,3dr7yu,Milguas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:47:10 2015 UTC,Oh i remember now thanks for clearing this up.
fairytail,3dr7yu,Milguas,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:47:50 2015 UTC,Paradox applies if there is only a single timeline. Multiverse theory says hi
fairytail,3dr7yu,Edd601,0,Sat Jul 18 22:36:52 2015 UTC,mutiverse can have paradox too
fairytail,3dr7yu,Edd601,2,Sat Jul 18 22:51:22 2015 UTC,No they can't because an alternate timeline forms with EACH choice. >_>
fairytail,3dr7yu,War-Bandit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:06:24 2015 UTC,"We already know that (Edolas spoilers:) Porlyusica is Edolas' Grandeeney, and I don't think she's as old as Earthland's Grandeeney, as we can see from this picture: http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/fairytail/images/2/2b/Young_Makarov_and_Young_Porlyusica.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/640?cb=20100419201955, she was young around the same time as Makarov was young, which probably suggests that she wasn't born around the same time as Eartland's Grandeeney.  Might be the same with Natsu."
fairytail,3dr7yu,Terosan,0,Sat Jul 18 18:29:13 2015 UTC,"we dont know how old is Grandine though, she could be a relatively young dragon. We know Porly communicated with Grandine before her disappearence, meanning the Lets hope into our children and extend our life because some random ass curse incident must have happened during Porly's lifetime"
