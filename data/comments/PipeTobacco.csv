PipeTobacco,3e33sx,Chuzordie,2,Tue Jul 21 21:37:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah any time a pipe gets sat down for an extended amount of time, it will go out. And relighting isn't as easy as it is for a cigar, so I understand."

PipeTobacco,3e33sx,bovinitysupreme,3,Tue Jul 21 18:41:29 2015 UTC,"The largest flaw imo is not knowing what you will get. I have read some people getting 12 pipes while most get only 10 as the bag says.   His getting 11 pipes was a nice bonus and the hardwood pipe is ++,  the sheer randomness is is fun. * I swear i counted 11 pipes like 4 times.."

PipeTobacco,3e33sx,gestalt162,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:49:16 2015 UTC,"I have a few of them.  The worst I have found was drilling that was too high- I have a Great Dane egg where the hole for the shank was drilled about 1/2 inch from the bottom of the chamber. Nothing some pipe mud couldn't fix.  The finish also may be missing, I have a diplomat that is complete except the finish was missing. Also the outer wall was degraded in one spot (kernels missing/falling out) but this is cosmetic.  By and large the flaws are cosmetic and the pipes are definitely smokeable. The aforementioned diplomat is my best smoking pipe, period."
PipeTobacco,3e5bpu,Chuzordie,2,Wed Jul 22 01:59:33 2015 UTC,"I would never pay good money for a pipe with all that junk in there. I don't even like simple stingers. That's just my opinion, but I think there's reason most high-grade carvers don't use any of that stuff. I believe it was all just a fad/gimmick to sell stuff because it has some newfangled technology. It was really popular in factory pipes around middle of last century."
PipeTobacco,3e5bpu,tennesseean_87,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:04:38 2015 UTC,"Don't buy pipes with gimmicks, they never work like they claim. I'm waiting for something to come along and prove me wrong about it, but I could be waiting a while.  Also, where is this guy's prices?"
PipeTobacco,3e24n9,cigaraway,7,Tue Jul 21 11:04:22 2015 UTC,"Here is a cut and paste of some common general advice, since this comes up often.   First, note that there are three major categories of tobacco: English, Virginia and aromatic. There are other special categories, but these are the most common.   Aromatics smell great, but don't usually taste as good. They can be hard to smoke well because they are very wet and get very hot. People think they are good to start with because they are sweet, but really they are better left until after you work on your technique a while.   English smell like a campfire or a good whiskey because they have a smoky fur cured tobacco called latakia in them. They are usually easy to smoke, stay lit well, and are flavorful, but you have to like the latakia. Some are stronger than others.   Virginia includes blends that mix it with other tobaccos like burley (earthy), perique (sweet and/or peppery), orientals and others. There are different kinds of Virginias, too (red, gold, etc). They tend to be grassy or hay like, and sweeter. They sometimes come as pressed flakes or coins instead of loosely cut ribbons. They can be hot and somewhat challenging to smoke, but very rewarding.    Dry out your tobacco before packing it in the bowl. Get a good quality pipe (briar or cob). Pack the bowl looser than you think it needs.  Slow down! Puff gently. Your tobacco is too wet — dry it out more. Tamp often. Tamp gently, with just the weight of the tamper. Try lots of tobaccos (join the bowl exchange). The tobacco is still too wet — dry it more. Use a soft flame butane lighter, Zippo pipe lighter or matches, not torches/cigar lighters.  Cheap Bics are fine. Read the FAQ. Participate in the weekly Piper University thread. Dry out your tobacco more. Let the pipe cool before you clean it. Don’t be afraid to use a soft pipe cleaner to dry it out during a smoke if it starts to gurgle. Don’t worry about relights.  If it goes it, relight and enjoy. Use a filter.  Or don’t.  Whatever you like better. Make sure you dry out your tobacco. Above all: take your time and enjoy yourself.  It’s not a chore, it’s a relaxing hobby.   Help us help you by answering a few survey questions so we can understand your preferences:   Saccharin or savory sweet? Tea or coffee? How do you take your tea/coffee? weak/strong, light/black, sweet/bitter? Which smells do you enjoy? Fresh cut grass, dry hay, the loamy earthy smell of half rotted leaves in the late fall, campfire? Do you like dark fruits like plums and figs? Do you like the tingle of black pepper in your nose when you get a strong hit of it? Rich and hot from the bakery bread or something a day old with more grains and bit more dense you can sink your teeth into? Rich BBQ sauce or charred, well seasoned meat bark? Do you like something straight forward and in your face or do you want something complex to sit and ponder and try and figure out just what it is that ephemeral taste in the background?

PipeTobacco,3e24n9,levins0,2,Tue Jul 21 17:45:33 2015 UTC,"Nicely done.  :)  I'm going to say give a try to Dunhill My Mixture 965 for an English.  It's got a nice creaminess to it and some sweetness from added Cavendish.  It's got some Latakia for the campfire, but it tastes milder than it smells so don't be too scared.  It lights and burns easily.  And for a different flavor, try Dunhill's Elizabethan Mixture or get some H&H Anniversary Kake from Pipes&Cigars.  The Dunhill blends should be easy to find anywhere, including local B&Ms.  P&C has them, of course, along with their H&H line.  Both of these are Virginia/Perique blends.  The Perique adds a bit of pepper and a lot of dark fruits (more in the Anni Kake).  Both are easy to smoke.  The AK will require a bit of drying, but the Dunhill blends generally come pretty much ready to pack into a bowl."

PipeTobacco,3e0ja5,blenheim45,5,Tue Jul 21 01:24:55 2015 UTC,"The tobacco came before the pipe.  My nephew brought me a new Brigham pipe and a stack of tins when he came up for my 50th birthday some 20 years ago. I had been smoking Capt. Black and similar stuff, because it was what was available, and I had a number of serviceable good smoking pipes.  The tobaccos he had picked up on the drive from Florida to Ontario, and he had stopped at I think J.R.s probably in Georgia or the Carolinas and they had a sale on.  There was Dunhill 965, EMP, Royal Yacht, MacBarens: Vanilla, Plum Cake, and one of their Virginia Burley tobaccos.  It was an OMG moment as I opened and tried each of the tins as we visited over the next week of his visit. A continuing epiphany of ""oh this is what tobacco tastes like"" and I have never looked back.  While the pipe was nice and I still have and smoke it, ""the pipe"" which did the same thing was purchased at an antiques store in St. Augustine Florida, and yes my nephew and his wife were there too.  It is a Karl Erik partially rusticated egg, which not only smokes very very well, but feels so sensuously right when I hold it.  Not quite 20 years later and the Egg still defines what I like a pipe to feel like when I hold it."

Now the the tins that were purchased in the EU, assuming they have a tax stamp attached, would probably fall under the maximum allowable amount to be brought along with you because you would be possessing them traveling back into the EU and have no proof of how you acquired them.  If you are traveling on official business I would suggest overpacking them as well as you can and hoping for the best in your household goods shipment."

PipeTobacco,3dywt8,adirtygerman,7,Tue Jul 21 01:29:19 2015 UTC,You can search by strength on Tobacco Reviews as well.
PipeTobacco,3dywt8,naughty_corner,4,Mon Jul 20 19:24:32 2015 UTC,"That is a measure of the total strength of a tobacco, of which nicotine content is only one component.  Nonetheless, it is at least a good start, but you are going to need to read through the comments.  Even this isn't always a good measure because it is quite common to see a signifiant range of opinions on nicotine content."
PipeTobacco,3dywt8,FullFrontalNoodly,3,Mon Jul 20 22:43:53 2015 UTC,I really don't get what 'tobacco strength' is if it's not nic or taste strength.
PipeTobacco,3dywt8,tennesseean_87,2,Tue Jul 21 00:12:18 2015 UTC,"As best as I can tell, it is supposed to be an average of all factors.  But even in that regard it is somewhat meaningless.  For example, you could have a straight burly and virginia mix that would be very mild in flavor but high in nicotine.  Something like that would get a medium rating, but the value of that rating is really questionable until you start reading the comments."
PipeTobacco,3dywt8,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:07:18 2015 UTC,"Taste and nic go together to form ""strength,"" which is why it's unfortunately useless. I prefer to ask people specifically about the taste or the nic depending on the context."
PipeTobacco,3dywt8,pwny_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:12:54 2015 UTC,"I think using strength, flavor, and taste for nic, topping, and fullness of flavor would be the best. I know one yt reviewer who rates strength, nicotine, flavoring, and taste. I still don't understand the strength rating. I'd think taste fullness would cover it, but what do I know."
PipeTobacco,3dywt8,tennesseean_87,4,Tue Jul 21 22:14:08 2015 UTC,No such thing as no nicotine tobacco. However you could try either some of the more recommended aromatics or English/Balkan style blends as they tend to be on the lower side of nicotine content (minus Nightcap).
PipeTobacco,3dywt8,carnesy,3,Mon Jul 20 17:48:26 2015 UTC,Any good pointers to where to find brands/styles of these aromatics?
PipeTobacco,3dywt8,carnesy,5,Mon Jul 20 18:34:28 2015 UTC,"Either of the blends by Cult (Blood Red Moon and Abacus), Missouri Meerschaum Great Dane*, Mac Baren Vanilla Cream make sure you get the round ready rub tin not the whole flake (it seems pricey but you're getting the hundred gram tin not the 50), Autumn Evening by Cornell & Dheil.  Also check the sidebar for our FAQ, I believe the beginners section lists various blends nominated by the community.  Edit: www.pipesandcigars.com and/or www.smokingpipes.com will have them. Note MM Great Dane is only available through P&C"
PipeTobacco,3dywt8,Turbostar66,3,Mon Jul 20 18:42:10 2015 UTC,Just be careful as many aromatics use Burley (one of the higher nicotine content leaves) as a base.
PipeTobacco,3dywt8,carnesy,3,Mon Jul 20 20:04:02 2015 UTC,Generally though I find due to the various treatments and such Aros go through in processing and manufacture that most of the nic from the burley is stripped out. Also since they are topping and casing the leaf they generally don't use the high quality (and high nic) leaf that they'd use in a more traditional burely blend.
PipeTobacco,3dywt8,PipeBeard,2,Mon Jul 20 20:07:39 2015 UTC,"+1.  Also, I found the vanilla cream flake to be stronger than the vanilla cream mixture.  It's not super strong, but it definitely surprised me."
PipeTobacco,3dywt8,carnesy,2,Mon Jul 20 22:14:17 2015 UTC,True but since I have no idea what kind of experience they have I keep it simple and recommend the ready rubbed. One of the worst things a new smoker can encounter is the finickiness of a flake and the issues inherent of an aromatic. If you don't know how to treat either of those it can make for a bad experience and when you combine the two the issues multiply if not handled with care.

PipeTobacco,3dywt8,PipeBeard,4,Mon Jul 20 23:22:14 2015 UTC,The first thing that came to mind was Frog Morton.  The other thing is that smokingpipes.com has a tobacco selector that will allow you to filter by strength (i.e. you can search for mild and very mild blends).

PipeTobacco,3dywt8,FullFrontalNoodly,2,Mon Jul 20 23:27:38 2015 UTC,"If you go in the other direction, nicotine can work like a sedative, and may even help you fall asleep (i.e. Nightcap).  Not that I'm trying to be a bad influence or anything...  In all honesty, I think a lot of us find a happy medium, and generally look to pipe smoking to have a relaxing experience.  Milder blends should help that for now.  The ritual itself can be calming.  There are some good suggestions on here.  Look for what works best for you, or whatever helps you sleep at night ;)"
PipeTobacco,3dywt8,ColinOnReddit,2,Tue Jul 21 01:17:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, what is it about nightcap?  I just had my first nirvana bowl, and it happened to be with nightcap, and the feeling was unlike anything I have ever gotten from tobacco before.  When I used to smoke cigarettes (not as a regular smoker, so I always knew when I was getting nic) smoking in the evening would keep me up all night, yet I fell soundly asleep after smoking a bowl of Nightcap."

PipeTobacco,3dywt8,ColinOnReddit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:18:20 2015 UTC,Huh?  I thought the whole point of vaping was as a nicotine delivery system.  People actually smoke nicotine-free fluids just for the taste?

PipeTobacco,3dxdz4,AsIfThatWouldHappen,9,Mon Jul 20 09:16:01 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, let me make it clear that this is not an attack in any way on this pipe or it's seller. I elected to include their name in this post because they actually have some really great pipes on their page, and some awesome prices, so if the owner of the FB see's this, please know I genuinely do not mean to bash you in any way.  NOW, to my point. This is a beautiful pipe I am sure we can all agree, what gets me however, is how it is described as having 'Flawless straight grain' wrapping the entire bowl. To my eyes, and likely to my personal opinion of what constitutes 'straight grain', this appears to have a small area of flame grain on one side and next to no 'straight grain' to be seen.  The reason I post this is because as my hunt for pipes intensifies I see the terms 'stunning\perfect\brilliant straight grain' etc. appearing left right and centre online, and believe me when I say this is far from being the least worthy of the title.   Many makers stamp pipes as straight grain, some do have what I would consider straight grain, as I perceive it through my OCD biased eyes anyway. These pipes have uniform and consistent straight grain all over, with consistent gaps between the light and dark grain, uniform colour variation and thickness, and uniform straightness. Others are stamped straight grain while having flame grain and birdseye everywhere.   I guess my question is, what is ""straight grain"" to you, is it a term set in stone requiring a very specific grain to meet requirements? Is it something you believe is the ultimate perfection in a wood grain?  If this sounds a little familiar,  you may have read something similar by Fred Hanna in the book ""Perfect Smoke"", where he talks at length about his fixation with 'perfect straight grain', and his gripe with people using the label where it doesn't belong.He has a beautiful collection of insane quality straightgrains that are just mesmerising with their perfection."
PipeTobacco,3dxdz4,jarvis400,7,Mon Jul 20 09:28:28 2015 UTC,"I agree, calling that pipe having straight grain is utter nonsense.   (Conversely, I wonder why it wasn't unique, because evidently most things are now unique, if not amazing. 75% of all the things are now amazing. The remaining 25% are apparently badass.)   To me straight grain means just that, vertical straight grain throughout and around the bowl. Of course, you can say that the pipe has some straight grain, like these two pipes that have mostly flame grain, but some straight grain here and there, as well. (Oh, I miss those two pipes. Traded for tobacco, as per usual.) Here's another shot for those who like titillating close-ups.   I've never owned a 100% straight grain pipe, mostly because they usually come at a steep premium. Fred Hanna's collection of straight grain pipes is truly incredible, indeed."

PipeTobacco,3dxdz4,jonmon22,2,Mon Jul 20 15:07:29 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that most (at least a lot of) people don't understand the structure of briar burl. You can have straight grain all around a bowl, but each of those straight lines are actually cylinders if take a cross-section of them--as you see on the bottom and on the rim of a straight-grain pipe. Ring-grain is the texture that results when this is blasted--the growth rings are perpendicular to the straight grain.   I have always thought straight grain refers to regular (not random) straight lines of grain all around the bowl. This results in birdseye on the rim and bottom. The best version have a block perfectly oriented so the grain doesn't travel in a straight diagonal, but in a vertical manner.   What is the difference between straight and flame grain? Is it the appearance of the grain itself or the orientation?"

A lot of folks us pipes&cigars, but if you go back through the posts here you will find a constant line of complaints from the time when they were sold to cigars international.  I have no personal experience with P&C as they will not ship to Canada.    from my point of view the price differences are minimal between the major suppliers, unless they have a particularly good sale on at a given time, and most of the sales show up on all the majors with some slight difference in timing.  One thing that galls me is that P&C evidently marks prices up before declaring a ""sale"", according to numerous reports here.  That strikes me as being a very shady practice.  Things I like about SP: if  an item is out of stock you cannot order it and have an order broken up over time, as various items come into stock; when you look at a pipe, you see the pipe you are ordering (more pictures for higher priced pipes), NOT a ""stock photo"" of the pipe style;  their shipping is quick, so quick that don't try to change your mind the next day or sometimes later in the same day, for it is probably already picked, packed, and on the way to you; and  most importantly I have never heard of anyone having a problem with them or their products that was not taken care of to their satisfaction quickly and without a fuss.

Once they sent me a cheap pouch that was defective, and they immediately made it right.    Their sales are decent and the prices are good.  The one thing you have to pay attention to is that apparently they like to artificially inflate prices before a sale so it looks like the sale is better than it really is.  The sale prices are still usually better than their competitors, but it's kind of sneaky to do that.  Their phone staff has always been helpful and friendly.

Aromatics are the candy store of tobaccos, great smell, sweet tasting as a rule  very little ""tobacco"" taste as such.  It was where I started oh so many years ago, and where most older smokers started, unless they started with the other dominant group of OTC blends, the burley/Virginia blends like 1/2 & 1/2, Prince Albert, SWA, etc.  Aros are a bit like ""Cherry Whiskey"" and other flavoured alcohols, enjoyed by many and disdained by those who like the ""purer"" flavour of straight blends.  But note that those straight blended whiskies are look down on by those who prefer unblended drinks, and so on and so on, etc.  [If you are looking for a good and economical alternative to Capt. Black check out Lane's bulk 1Q which has been a best seller for years, and is available on line and in most shops that carry bulks, although often sold under a re-label name in b&ms.]  The prime rule of pipe smoking is ""smoke what you like, and like what you smoke.""

PipeTobacco,3dycen,levins0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:31:48 2015 UTC,"Israel. But after buying Frog Morton online and feeling disappointed, now I prefer to buy tobacco in person so I can smell it first and have an idea on what it's gonna be like."
PipeTobacco,3dycen,levins0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:36:34 2015 UTC,"FM is a nice middle of the road English, and as a lat. hound I find it on the ""light"" side.  I do note that a lot of people only consider latakia laced blends to be for ""cold weather"" smoking, although I smoke them year round.  Problem with  buying by smell is that almost all aros smell good in the tin, and that often bears little relationship to how they taste.  Latakia and perique tend to be an acquired taste, and at least for beginners a little goes a long way.  FM is a light weight by comparison with blends like Pirate Kake (C&D) which is 75% Lat., as it probably is about 15% lat.  But the key is not just the amount of Latakia, but what else is in the blend.  If you look at a full list of Cornell and Diehl blends that contain Latakia there are at least 75 different blends there (I haven't counted them recently LOL, there may be closer to 100).  And they all taste slightly different, and some taste very different.  And you will find some surprising blends in the list like Burley Flake #4, which is burley dominant, but also contains Lat. and red Virginia.    If you are in or near a major city or a university check and see if there is a pipe club around. [look for announcements at any tobacco shop you enter too.] Every pipe club i have heard of welcomes new members, and it is almost a contest to get the new guys to try everyone else's favourite blends. LOL"
PipeTobacco,3dycen,Forever_Man,2,Tue Jul 21 00:45:28 2015 UTC,"I would go for a Burley, an aromatic, and a VA if you don't like latakia."

After doing that all morning and afternoon, we ran errands around town.    Got home, girlfriend made some delicious dinner, and now, enjoying some 2013 Wenceslas in my Crown Achievement billiard.  Been trying to smoke through all my bags of samples that have sent to me that past couple of years and this one was next.  Really nice aro."

PipeTobacco,3dvbq5,Holyshnikez,14,Sun Jul 19 20:45:49 2015 UTC,"Hey man. Very nice of you to offer to share all your tobacco with someone here. I'm sure someone will be happy with the tobacco they'd be receiving. I'll throw a number in for the hell of it - 30.  That being said, if you're really in a financial rough patch I'd offer the suggestion for you to sell your tobacco in one lot over on /r/pipetobaccomarket. You don't have to charge full retail or anything, but I'm sure someone would be happy to take that tobacco off your hands for something like half retail. In that case everyone's a winner (you will get some cash and the person buying it will get cheap tobacco), and you can get some of the cash you invested in the tobacco back. Just a suggestion.  Thanks again for the post!"
PipeTobacco,3dvbq5,soymilkisgood,3,Sun Jul 19 21:34:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the kind words! Truth be told, I put some thought about placing it on /r/pipetobaccomarket , but how many times do you really get to do something like this in a year?

PipeTobacco,3dvln7,liams_dad,3,Sun Jul 19 22:30:49 2015 UTC,not much of anything special. most of the aromatics i've smoked have been flavored with cherry/vanilla. i like to pick up the blends my local tobacco shops make. i'll get in habits of smoking virgina tobacco and then switch to aromatics for a change. i'd really like to an english blend next
PipeTobacco,3dvln7,liams_dad,3,Sun Jul 19 23:48:45 2015 UTC,I don't want to influence you.... but Missouri Meerschaum Great Dane is my favorite aromatic. It is a vanilla/cherry aromatic that might be right up your alley.   I love the variety of flavors pipe tobacco has over cigars. I have found that I enjoy VaPers and Burley's and do not like latakia.

PipeTobacco,3du90z,bantha_burger,2,Sun Jul 19 18:25:59 2015 UTC,That's exactly the finish I want on my project! Love the natural color of it. What did you do to it?
PipeTobacco,3du90z,BriarBoy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:22:48 2015 UTC,"For this color, I diluted a ""medium brown"" aniline dye by about 4 to 1 with isopropel and mixed it up.  After that I added just a couple of coats of dye and then did the final sanding and polishing after it dried for a few hours.  It added just a bit of richness to the wood color while remaining fairly natural looking under normal light.  I'm reasonably happy with it.  If you go that route, be sure to mix up the dye well when diluting it.  I don't think I mixed it enough and there ended up being a few spots that were darker than others."
PipeTobacco,3dub94,vilelm,7,Sun Jul 19 15:29:42 2015 UTC,"I'm currently traveling abroad for work and ended up picking up a very small meerschaum pipe as my first pipe. Have a friend at home who's been bugging me to get into pipe smoking with him (I prefer cigars). Had a lot of issues with the size of the meerschaum pipe so decided to order in a Missouri Meerschaum to give it a try; picked up the country gentleman. Huge night and day difference between the two, and i prefer the cobb over the meerschaum (probabbly due to size, lot easier to light and keep lit a larger pipe than what i started out with). To help with understanding my new cobb pipe I found this pipe wiki and it was very insightful and informative:  Http://pipedia.org  Hope this helps!"
PipeTobacco,3dub94,TheReturned,5,Sun Jul 19 16:43:39 2015 UTC,"I found the opposite, two of my estate pipes no matter how many times I've cleaned them and sweetened them they just mute the flavors for whatever reason.. I keep them though because they were gifts. My MM however I can't say for certain enhances my tobaccos flavors but it hasn't made them tasteless or off by any means."
PipeTobacco,3dub94,BWeice,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:41:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it makes tobacco tasteless, but definitely less ""rich"" than when I smoke in briar. Could it be related to the absorbent qualities?"
PipeTobacco,3dub94,BWeice,4,Sun Jul 19 16:17:03 2015 UTC,"Well.. if the cob is pretty new you would definitely need to run a few smokes through it to build up a cake like others have suggested. A cob definitely has more of an absorbent quality to it which is why it smokes cooler and doesn't gurgle much if at all. I suggest smoking some burley blends through it, I broke in my new Savinelli pipe with Three Friars which is more virginia than burley but just that mild amount has built a cake on it thicker and faster than any other pipe I own in just 7 smokes. A fresh cob does give off some of its corn flavors through the smoke so you may be tasting some of that and feeling the flavors thin out."
PipeTobacco,3dub94,BWeice,2,Sun Jul 19 16:33:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, corn taste is definitely present, but it's slowly going away. I think I'll smoke it more frequently and wait for the cake to build. Thanks for your advice."
PipeTobacco,3dub94,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:38:44 2015 UTC,"No problem, let me know how it works out for you! Cobs aren't for everybody but you need to give it a chance."
PipeTobacco,3dub94,FullFrontalNoodly,4,Sun Jul 19 17:00:04 2015 UTC,If you are using a filter in the cob pipe that will definitely do it.
PipeTobacco,3dub94,FullFrontalNoodly,2,Sun Jul 19 15:56:30 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's what I thought the first time I smoked it, but I've been smoking without since then and it's the same. It's like all the flavors get ""absorbed"" by the corn."
PipeTobacco,3dub94,DavidPx,4,Sun Jul 19 16:14:34 2015 UTC,"I think the cob may be absorbent when it is fresh -- and it will definitely add a flavoring the first couple of times you smoke it -- but I think both of those go away after a half-dozen bowls.  The MM cobs have a really open draw, so that is also something that could be fooling you."
PipeTobacco,3dub94,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:25:18 2015 UTC,What do you mean when you say the open draw could be fouling me? Could you please articulate on that?
PipeTobacco,3dub94,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:40:43 2015 UTC,"The draft hole on the MM cobs is a fairly large diameter, especially when you use them without the filters."
PipeTobacco,3dub94,DavidPx,2,Sun Jul 19 16:56:14 2015 UTC,Maybe your cob hasn't built up its cake yet.
PipeTobacco,3dub94,BriarBoy,2,Sun Jul 19 16:25:46 2015 UTC,"This. Cake hasn't built up yet, also because I'm not using this pipe very much (because I do really find briar much more satisfying) but I'll definitely use it more and report back how's doing.  Maybe I should follow Mark Twain's advice source :)  I asked him if he had brought a supply of pipes with him:  ""Oh, no,"" he answered, ""I never smoke a new corn-cob pipe. A new pipe irritates the throat. No corn-cob pipe is fit for anything until it has been used at least a fortnight.""  ""How do you manage then?"" I asked. ""Do you follow the example of the man with the tight boots;--wear them a couple of weeks before they can be put on?""  ""No,"" said Mark Twain, ""I always hire a cheap man--a man who doesn't amount to much, anyhow--who would be as well--or better--dead, and let him break in the pipe for me. I get him to smoke the pipe for a couple of weeks, then put in a new stem, and continue operations as long as the pipe holds together.""  Edit: formatting"
PipeTobacco,3dub94,adirtygerman,3,Sun Jul 19 16:35:06 2015 UTC,"It is worth noting that the corn for the MM pipes has been heavily hybridized to produce large, woody cobs.  I don't know exactly at what point this was done, but it is certainly possible that the cobs we have now could be quite a bit different than those that Mark Twain smoked.  As to cake build-up, I'll leave this here:  http://pipedia.org/wiki/The_Complete_Corncob_primer#Avoiding_Cake_Build-Up"
PipeTobacco,3dub94,herrhobbes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:46:19 2015 UTC,"I read that, what I don't get is when it says: ""What makes a cob so good is that it somehow first absorbs tars and harsh flavors, and then dissipates them.""  I think this happens with the ""good"" flavours too. From my (admittedly short) experience, the same tobacco as way less flavor on corn than on briar."
PipeTobacco,3dub94,XPostLinker,2,Sun Jul 19 16:51:20 2015 UTC,It could just be a pipe-to-pipe difference.  Many people say their tobaccos taste different in different briar pipes.

PipeTobacco,3dteb6,Mordenkrad,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:33:11 2015 UTC,yeah. Tobaccoreviews.com lists it as an aromatic
PipeTobacco,3dteb6,tennesseean_87,2,Sun Jul 19 07:40:42 2015 UTC,"While I agree in this instance, (and in most), I always take TR with a large grain of salt."
PipeTobacco,3dteb6,ahedderly,2,Mon Jul 20 03:42:04 2015 UTC,"I'd call it an aromatic of some sort. I remember I got a sample right when I started and loved it, and then tried it again and recognized it as a bit aromaticey. I think it's probably a great tobacco for people wanting to transition away from aromatics a bit."
PipeTobacco,3dteb6,jarvis400,2,Sun Jul 19 07:56:50 2015 UTC,"Even though it clearly has a some flavouring added, I wouldn't call it an aromatic. Most blends have some additives; sweeteners, flavourings and humectants are the main three groups.  Capstan, Dunhill Flake, OGS etc., all have some flavour additives, but most people would still call them straight, non-aromatic tobaccos.  Some tobaccos are hard to define. For example GLP Haddo's has a very distinct top note, which you can taste throughout the bowl, but I don't think many people would call it an aromatic. Some will, though.  I personally disagree with the TR listing."

Not all aromatics are created equal. Some are nice to smoke, but some are just a waste of time. Kind of like the old saying:  ""all rectangles squares are squares rectangles, but not all squares rectangles are rectangles squares""  Edit: math definition correction  Definition: A rectangle is a quadrilateral with all four angles right angles.

PipeTobacco,3dteb6,HorkyBamf,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:51:55 2015 UTC,All good response. It's a good top note but for me there are top notes that mingle with the tobacco and top nots that present themselves as a separate entity. When they 'feel' separate that's when I subjectively call them an aromatic as in this instance.
PipeTobacco,3dsg7a,nosoup4me,6,Sun Jul 19 00:40:44 2015 UTC,Small toothbrush or the brush you get to clean electric razors. It won't come completely clean but it'll help. The dirt melts into the beeswax finish.

PipeTobacco,3dsg7a,carnesy,2,Sun Jul 19 01:40:04 2015 UTC,"Don't strip the wax. The more you smoke it, the less noticeable the dirt will become. An electric toothbrush should work fine. Any non abrasive brush or pick."

And if there are any tricks to getting a nice even patina?  Thanks
PipeTobacco,3dsg7a,BriarBoy,3,Sun Jul 19 00:44:11 2015 UTC,"A very soft paint brush used gently should work. Use of a coloring bowl is best for even coloring but ideally it is used from the first smoke in the pipe, they are tough to find these days, it's a bowl that fits a top the pipe's bowl and the tobacco is smoke in it, the pipe remains cooler and no carbon builds up on the pipe walls, thusly producing a faster and more even color."

Intellgenstia might only be in LA and Chicago though, which is cheating, but blows every other cup of coffee I have had out of the water, so it is obviously +++++, couldn't be better.   There is some small batch stuff I have had from both coasts, and even a local place, which is pretty great, but Starbucks, when it is made properly, can hang in there. Just like with pipe tobacco and whiskey, I am a coffee enthusiast, but not a snob. I try to think the best cup of coffee I have had is one I am drinking at that moment.  It is a shame about Firedance. It really paid out for me in a way that I couldn't get any other aro to sing. It is pretty obviously they aren't near to my heart, but I figured I ought to review the ones I have and spread the word."

I shut up pretty quickly then. I am blessed/spoiled with an exceptional roaster in my small town.   As for the Firedance, I only gave it two tries to be fair. It's topping was just too much for me.

Fresh cut grass, dry hay, the loamy earthy smell of half rotted leaves in the late fall, or a campfire?  -Do you like dark fruits like plums and figs?  -Do you like the tingle of black pepper in your nose when you get a strong hit of it?  -Rich and hot from the bakery bread or something a day old with more grains and bit more dense you can sink your teeth into?  -Rich BBQ sauce or charred well seasoned, meat bark?  -Do you like something straight forward and in your face or do you want something complex to sit and ponder and try and figure out just what it is that ephemeral taste in the background is?

PipeTobacco,3dsmys,cigaraway,2,Mon Jul 20 06:06:09 2015 UTC,"I'm no guru for matching people with tobaccos. However what I feel these questions do is let us know your basic preferences to various tastes so, collectively we the community, can make recommendations. For example with the campfire and charred meat, we can tell you may like Latakia blends and the Syrian Lat tends to have more of a charred meat taste smell than straight campfire to it so we could point you to Mac Baren's HH Vintage Syrian or McClelland's 3 Oaks either standard or Syrian.   The dark fruit and pepper are characteristics of Perique. The coffee questions relate to some blends with burley and can have aspects of breadiness as can some Va blends, others like C&D's Briar Fox have been described as having a Graham Cracker taste. As to complexity well, it should be self explanatory, do you want layers and nuance or something that remains unchanging for the duration of the smoke?"

You just have to find that out for yourself. Maybe 6 or 7 times.   If you want to get four, go ahead and try one of the two purish burley blends.

PipeTobacco,3dmx5m,BWeice,5,Sat Jul 18 12:00:44 2015 UTC,"Here are a few tips:   Hold the match between your thumb and index finger with the tip close to your palm.  This will give you a a very natural wind-break. Use your middle finger to apply pressure while striking. Hold the match near (but not quite) vertical with the tip down immediately after striking.  This will give you good ignition of a larger section of wood while the tip is flaring up. If it is seriously windy, immediately use your free hand to fully cup the flame. Don't attempt to light your pipe until a good section of the match has caught. If necessary, continue the two-hand windbreak over your pipe."

Great video, thanks, I have been lucky with all mine so far but no doubt I'll need to do this one day myself.  A bit off topic but I saw a Kaywoodie on Ebay I wanted to ask you about, I don't want to buy it but it is interesting. Its a new in box, Samuel Pepy's desk pipe, made in France. Is it something special? It's $500 usd...."
PipeTobacco,3dol6j,scriptonic,2,Sat Jul 18 09:58:15 2015 UTC,"I've seen those....they have an odd history. The pipe isn't actually a kaywoodie made pipe. In fact its a GDB second. The actually name of the seconds company is Saumel Pepy's. At the time that these were being produced Kaywoodie had a factory in London as well as the US. So basically Kayoodie bought seconds from GDB threw their stamping on it and Bob's your uncle. If you just google Samuel Pepy's Desk Pipe I'm sure you'll be able to find two different versions, one that says ""by kaywoodie"" and the other that says ""By GDB"" expect for the stamping and stem logos they are the same exact pipe, same exact box (it opens in a very unique manner), and same exact rustication.  These are rare, but not $500 rare. But at the end of the day if someone wants one THAT bad they'll pay any amount. $250-$335 is what I would ask if I were selling one.  Very cool pipe though"

It was made between 1950-1972, before the Cadogen take over, in a period where Orlik was still well regarded for making high quality pipes. This changed after the Merger which led to a drop in quality.  I'm really looking forward to this one, I once bought a MINT, high grade Old Bond Street Orlik off eBay, only for it to vanish in the mail before it arrived. Hopefully this will finally be my chance to smoke a good old orlik, even if it's a lesser grade."

PipeTobacco,3dmv9y,SupraMario,8,Fri Jul 17 16:17:25 2015 UTC,"It takes a while to begin to find flavors in your blends, this is just because your palate hasn't matured yet. Which can take years to do so, it's just like wine or scotch. Same thing.  That's what's awesome about pipe smoking, practicing until you can taste everything."
PipeTobacco,3dmv9y,BWeice,4,Fri Jul 17 16:22:53 2015 UTC,100%^ You are used to the flavors from those OTC blends this is a complete shock to your palate and may need some time. Anytime you add a new kind of blend with different leaf it's going to take a few smokes to start distinguishing what it is.
PipeTobacco,3dmv9y,SupraMario,8,Fri Jul 17 16:27:33 2015 UTC,"My advice, also is to try and limit the amount of sweats you eat and drink, drink water instead of coke, hold off on that ice cream. This will allow your palate also to catch onto more hidden/light flavors vs expecting super strong sugary flavors."
PipeTobacco,3dmv9y,Chuzordie,2,Fri Jul 17 16:32:15 2015 UTC,I will try that. I already don't drink soda so it won't be that hard.

I have found that 965 doesn't give out its true flavors when its hot and humid outside, its more of a fall/winter time smoke (for me anyway). If you can, try smoking it indoors with the air on or at least a moderately cool area. A different pipe could possibly solve this too.. I love it in my cob so I don't really know."

To sanitize, just get some alcohol (I use whiskey) and pipe cleaners, soft and bristled... just keep cleaning the inside of the stem/draught hole with it, until the pipe cleaners come out clean.  Don't get any alcohol on the outside of the pipe, unless you plan on refinishing the whole thing!  To de-oxidize a vulcanite stem, I usually just use micromesh pads, start coarse and keep rubbing till the oxidation is gone, then increase the grit until finally the stem will be shiny and black.   I finish off with Obsidian Oil.  One bottle should last a lifetime, I put my finger on the top of the jar, and that usually does a whole stem.  If you want to refinish the pipe, I'd start by looking at dozens of articles on reborn pipes.  The micromesh pads will be your friends here too."

PipeTobacco,3dl6jv,Pandam,5,Fri Jul 17 05:58:56 2015 UTC,"If you didn't air out or dry your tobacco it's very possible that it was a little bit too moist, hence causing bite. Flakes and plugs are particularly susceptible to this since they're so compressed that it might take a bit of extra time to dry properly (see: Samuel Gawith's line of presoaked towels-- I mean flakes).  For wetter flakes it might be better to try rubbing them out or cube cutting and then allowing them to dry a bit prior to smoking. Keep toying with your methods until you find what works for you."
PipeTobacco,3dl6jv,BWeice,2,Fri Jul 17 04:49:20 2015 UTC,"A flake is dry when it stops feeling cold to the touch, the cold is from the moisture leaving the flake once you feel its not cold prepare it and wait another 5-10 minutes just to make sure it's dry"

Depending on the tobacco and my patience, it can be 10 minutes or an hour.  It usually tantalizes me with the scent, and it's part of the ritual.  Once I've packed, I return the extra (if any) to a jar that collects extra, and I smoke that mix occasionally.  :)    I wouldn't air out the whole jar, just what you are going to smoke next.  I always get a little tongue effects.  It's not always from smoking hot, it can also be a chemical reaction, and it's just gonna happen to some people."

Sanitize them by getting a stack of pipe cleaners (bristled and smooth), and some whiskey or other alcohol.  Use the alcohol on the pipe cleaners and just keep cleaning the draught hole until the cleaners come out white. I clean from the stem to the bowl this way. Don't get alcohol on the outside of the pipe unless you are ready to refinish it!  It looks like one might have a bit too much cake, a reamer should knock it down to a dime thickness, and it's good to go.  The Parker looks like it has oxidation on the stem, the other stems look fairly black.  I use micromesh pads and Obsidian oil to deoxidize, and shine my stems.

PipeTobacco,3dk5vy,IUseExtraCommas,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:24:00 2015 UTC,"Oh, the 'pitting' you are seeing is just uneven cake buildup.  That's not a big deal, if you keep the cake at the desired thickness, it's a good thing.  And the pits in the cake will theoretically fill in as you use it.  The most common guidance I hear is cake should be the thickness of a dime, but some people have different preferences.    Building a nice cake inside the pipe (carbon deposits) is usually considered 'breaking in' the pipe."

It lends my mind to wandering. Ironically, I usually don't have time until it is dark due to family life. I don't mind putting a pipe down and coming back later,  but it is not ideal for several reasons. It interrupts the mellow, the flavor is slightly less IMO, and if you restart enough you can get moisture issues. I had a run there for a couple weeks where I was really busy and stressed and I tried to cram in the pipe wherever I could and it really sucked. It just ruined the whole thing, so I had to take a week off and come back to my old ways. Glad I did. Rushing a pipe is just wrong.   Also, on the cigarette front, my smoker friend taught me a trick. if you have to put one out and want to come back to it later, just blow the residual smoke out of the cig after extinguishing it. This solves 90%of the ass problem you mentioned."

PipeTobacco,3dk05z,antiwittgenstein,3,Fri Jul 17 03:22:52 2015 UTC,"Ideally, there are 3 scenarios that make a great smoke for me. :)  A great smoke is either contemplative or social.  The most common, is I have some time, I grab a book and a drink and a pipe, and sit on my back port for an hour..  Reading/thinking/smoking by myself.  Usually in the evenings, sometimes it's dark, but watching the sun set is perfect.  Second is if my wife or a kid joins me. (one grown daughter smokes cigars).  They might not be smoking anything, but we chill on our porch couchtm and we shoot the breeze or just enjoy the silence.  Third is when I have the chance to chill with another pipe smoker.  I've met a redditor who lives in the area, and we meet at a coffee shop and share tobacco & shoot the breeze.  I'm going to formalize this with a pipe club, which may or may not attract any other people. :)    I usually plan my smoke in advance and dry the tobacco as needed.  And I usually smoke the whole thing.  I have had mixed results with finishing a bowl started previously, I think some tobaccos this works, and some don't work as well.  Aromatics usually go bad, Virginias & Englishes sometimes don't care, in my experience."

Quite possibly cut-offs from cigar rolling etc.  We had one such brick at one of our pipe meets years ago. I remember that nobody liked it much. I certainly didn't. Nasty and sharp, I recall. This particular brick was bought while in Cuba.  There might be some local pipe tobaccos, but I doubt that there's anything in export quality.

As far as Cuban cigar leaf in pipe tobacco, I haven't seen any on the market yet, mainly due to the embargo I believe. Now there is pipe tobacco with cigar leaf in it, some hate it some love it. There are a few different options with different cigar leaf in it. I've had 6 or 7 different blends and the best one was OK, but nothing I'll stock in my cellar"

I think that has a lot to do with large American companies bankrolling most NC cigar brands and their insistence of quality and consistency.  Eventually I'm sure we'll see guys like Jonathan Drew or Pete Johnson going into Cuba, and setting up shop.  That's when we'll start to see some really exciting stuff coming from the island.  Currently there isn't an incentive to make every cigar perfect as they'll sell either way.   I'll suffer through a badly rolled Cuban far longer than I will a non-cuban though.

PipeTobacco,3divy3,BWeice,13,Thu Jul 16 17:36:03 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  There is a substantially different flavor profile to them than cigars from other regions.  Now, whether that flavor profile is ""better"" is up for debate, but it is totally different.    Cubans are sought after because of the embargo, that is true, but not only because of that.  As for the ""fraction of the price"" bit, that's not entirely true either.  Yes, there are Behikes and the like that will cost you a fortune, but there are also very affordably priced Cuban cigars.  Bolivar Petite Coronas can be had for around $5 a stick, and those are FANTASTIC with a good cup of coffee.

There's plenty of excellent (if not better) cigars that come from other areas.  especially since most were cuban seeds transported when Cuba became communist and embargoed.  So in many ways, they're superior as they've been raised and cultivated using the latest techniques and modernization.  Dominican Republic, Honduras, Nicaragua....all fantastic places.   Hell, the big Dominican brands (Cohiba, romeo y juliet, and ashton) all are sister companies of parent companies in Cuba.  I've also had cubans before (you can visit other countries and get them!), and while they taste different having a cuban vs. Dominican varietal of the same exact cigar by the same brand, I wouldn't suggest they were any better.  In fact, I'd say they were actually inferior in quality, especially in consistency. While the dominician ones were much more consistent with better binding on the wrapper.  Edit: quality doesn't mean taste. Simply the manufacturing process and consistency across multiples of the same product."

(Now the caveat being in my experience) is the majority of people who do this are the old timers, who might have a bit of nostalgia about the good ole times, and the people who aren't heavily invested into the hobby.

PipeTobacco,3diywb,disinformatique,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:16:46 2015 UTC,"Greg Pease sure makes complex blends :D, what worked for me was to be persistent and smoke very low quantities of his blends extremely slow. My first bowl of SixPence (a relatively less complex blend) was like oh my god this is awesome, but then the blend flattened out for a few weeks and then suddenly started gaining upward momentum. Took me 3 months for me to understand Six Pence and finally write down my review on it (it's published on tobaccoreviews website & my YT channel as well as website).   What I feel is that SixPence will be better for you than Haddo's but dont give it up yet. Greg's blends may not be Esoterica but they are a class on their own.   What I am trying to say is that give them time and patience and you will be rewarded fully. I am currently smoking Gaslight, Quiet Nights, Key Largo and Six Pence. I would suggest taking up Quiet Nights and it only requires two weeks of airing, instead of Gaslight which is more Latakia heavy and extremely bold. Quiet Nights on the other hand is slow burning, extremely balanced and rewards you better than Gaslight. Let Gaslight age for 3 months in a mason jar and then light it up in a small bowled pipe. Greg himself prefers small bowled pipes for his own English blends.   I hope it helps."

PipeTobacco,3die06,Piffyr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:15:51 2015 UTC,"I've seen carbureted pipes with a design similar to this, but never on a Kaywoodie. There is usually a small valve at the front of the bowl that caps of the airway that the smoker can use to adjust the amount of airflow from outside of the pipe. The idea is that when the smoker draws on the pipe, it will draw air in through both the valve and the perpendicular draft hole. The introduction of air from outside of the bowl is supposed to provide the smoker a cooler smoke. In reality, it's just gimmicky and lends itself to poor aerodynamics.  Like I said, I've never seen this particular design on a KW before and your photo doesn't show anything that we need to see to know if this is an intentional design. If /u/scriptonic hasn't seen it either, then I'm really flummoxed. KW did make carbureted pipes, but the design was completely different and the valve was on the bottom of the bowl. I'd be interested to learn if anyone else has more insight."

Time makes most tobaccos better, especially many bulk blends. I vaguely remember reading a review on dunhills bulk 965 in which the reviewer was disappointed to find that the blend tasted nothing like he remembered. He threw it in a jar and let it sit for a while and by the time he opened the jar again the blend looked, smelled, and tasted how it was supposed to.   TLDR: bulk offerings are often quite young when put on the market. let it age a bit."

For me, I could do without the Perique, and the Latakia content was a little lower than I expected, but still thought it was a great blend. It helped me wind down in a tough situation, so I will always have a place in my heart for it.  Everyone has a widely-acclaimed favorite that they don't like. PS Luxury Navy Flake was the first non-aromatic, non-English blend I tried, and I did not like it, I had to will my way through 2 oz. Although now that I have learned how to smoke better, maybe I should try it again.  My advice is to seal it up in a mason jar, try other tobaccos, and come back to it later. You may be surprised."

I did not like the smell, and I thought it ruined my whole order, everything smelled like an old campfire to me.   I put it in a jar, and put the jar in two freezer bags.  I finally tried it a few days later, and it was interesting.  I didn't hate it, but everything was so strong that I couldn't handle it.   I put it back on the shelf, and didn't try any more english blends for a few months.  Now I'm enjoying some blends with Latakia, Frog Morton(s), Mississippi River, McClelland Special Anniversary etc.  But Nightcap just doesn't do it for me.

PipeTobacco,3dgh2m,The_Juggler17,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:15:19 2015 UTC,"Something else to consider - try a corncob pipe.   Now, I wouldn't recommend using one exclusively, there's too much you're missing with a good briar. The other suggestions in this thread regarding briar pipes is great.   Corncob pipes are incredibly cheap, and they smoke very cool and dry because the pipe draws away that moisture. When it's new, it will have a smell and taste of corn that you may find pleasant too. They also tend to hold a ghost flavor (from previously smoked tobacco) longer and more strongly.   .   All pipe smokers have several pipes, and I'd say a cob is worth trying - but in addition to a nice briar pipe."
PipeTobacco,3deb74,xDemagog,11,Wed Jul 15 16:31:43 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna make this quick.   Smell: dark, dank, sticky fire cured tobaccos. A rich tobacco sweetness. You can almost get a licorice scent, but really it's just that leathery smell you get from dark fired tobaccos.   Look: dark, dank, sticky flake. Mottled with bits of brown. It's a good looking flake if you like em dark.    Taste: dark, dank, dirty fire cured Virginias  Room note: I dare not smoke this in a room  No licorice whatsoever to the point that I'm gonna ask Glynn if I got the right stuff or not. I know for a fact it's the GH Dark Flake with a topping, but none that I can detect (not even Lakeland floral). The after taste was reminiscent of your cigar chewing uncle's breath and I think I'm kinda done with fire cured tobaccos, retrohaling irritates my sinuses.

PipeTobacco,3dfdjb,BWeice,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:57:59 2015 UTC,"The bowl referred to as the ""cup"" is meerschaum I'm assuming, to take care of that you'd want to remove it if possible and then dampen(do not soak) a rag or washcloth with high proof alcohol and gently wipe away the tar build up, make sure not to get any alcohol on the finish.   if you want to freshen up the inside of the gourd or if it really needs it gently scrub the inside with the high proof alcohol, don't go too crazy after you've done that wipe it down with a clean/dry paper towel and let everything air dry for at least 2 days before smoking it  also for the stem get yourself a good pipe cleaner and once again dampen the tip of it with high proof alcohol and run it down into the stem until it comes out the same color it went in, this may take a while depending.  If you want to shine up the pipe itself get yourself some caranuba wax and gently buff it on.  Edit** Just to clarify Do NOT use excessive amounts of the alcohol just a dab will do ya"

PipeTobacco,3dfdjb,carnesy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:31:27 2015 UTC,"No problem, let me know how it turns out!"
PipeTobacco,3dfdjb,grabageman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:50:32 2015 UTC,"This to me looks like an excellent candidate for restoration.  The stem likely has bone threads so be careful getting that off.  After that I'd go ahead and remove the already loose band and polish it up a bit with some metal polish of your choosing.  Removing the bowl should only take a grasp and controlled deliberate twisting motion to get it freed.  Inspect the cork gasket and replace if it no longer seals sufficiently.  Cork sheets can be had at hobby stores and the like.  I've used plain elmer's glue to recork.  Non-toxic and holds just fine with no signs of the bond deteriorating over time and use.  For the outside of the gourd itself I'd just do a good spit polish.  Kind of gross but spit is an excellent solvent.  Should get much of the grime off.  It's important to not ever let the gourd get ""wet"" as it may swell and crack, usually at the rim.  For the interior of the gourd I like to use a bottle brush or test tube brush and scrub the crud out of it.  Be sure to get a supply of bristled pipe cleaners to aid in this job as well.  For the meerschaum bowl I'd spit polish that too.  The visible cake in the pictures should be removed to the best of your ability.  Use non-sharp implements for this task to chip away at it.  After all that you may reattach the band in the proper position.  I use just a dab of glue on the gourd where and position it where it should be and let the glue cure.  I think you'll be surprised how this looks once restored."

PipeTobacco,3ddhbk,AsIfThatWouldHappen,4,Wed Jul 15 12:24:36 2015 UTC,"So I was browsing ebay today looking for anything that peaked my interest, and started looking for another meer lined pipe like my newly purchased Kaywoodie Relief Meerschaum's, although I wanted something bigger.  I chucked in some search words, and this popped up. It was super close to finishing and I had no idea what a 'savory' pipe was, but I took a gamble and managed to jag the highest bid with a few seconds to spare. I love the look of this pipe and it looks like a good size, and is reportedly mint and possibly unsmoked, and is apparently 50+ years old.  After confirming the purchase I researched 'Savoy' and found out some great info, they appear to be a Dunhill second (or sometimes called a 3rd) which by all accounts smoke as good as or better than the Dunhill's from the same Era. I won't know 100% until it is in my hand, but this appears to be a Meerschaum Lined Dunhill Shell Group 4 or 5 Bulldog second, which is awesome as that is one of my most wanted Dunhill's.  I paid $30 for it too which I still can't believe. I'll post an update and better photos when it arrives and give my thoughts on it, but fingers crossed it lives up to it's big expectations."

PipeTobacco,3ddhbk,crimsonrat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:18:34 2015 UTC,"well yes and no, i wouldn't call it a dunhill third at all. Savory was its own company created in late 1800's. I'm not sure when but at some point dunhill did take them over; but as far as I know it was never a second or a thirds line. From my understanding they were still basically their own company, own tools, supplies of blocks, shapes etc. The only thing different was dunhill now owned them."
PipeTobacco,3ddhbk,CamStat,0,Wed Jul 15 16:41:32 2015 UTC,"From what I could find yesterday, including on smokingpipes.com listings for Savory Pipes (now expired) they were a Dunhill Second, made with Dunhill sourced Briar in the Parker\Hardcastle factory after the Dunhill take over.  They also bought dunhill Seconds and stamped them as Savory pipes, which is evident in the pipes with the same signature shapes and finishes as the Dunhill's of the time.   There are two different logos, with the Script 'S' being the restamped dunhill pipes and the 'crown logo' being their own make pipes.   They have Shell, ODA and Root Briar equivalents stamped as Savory.  I hope this doesn't sound argumentative and I will know for sure when I get it in my hands, if it's true it might be a good option for us to hunt for as estate's with a budget in mind."
PipeTobacco,3ddhbk,mapguy,0,Wed Jul 15 23:16:39 2015 UTC,"People often get confused when one parent company owns smaller companies that make the same thing. Savory's weren't made in the duhill factory, they were made in the Hardcastle/parker factory. Different machines, different blocks, different worker bees.   At one point yes, Hardcastle was a dunhill second, and I think the same goes with parker, but not anymore.  But at the end of the day it doesn't matter who made it, it matters how well it was made. I've seen dunhills with off centered drilling that gurgles like no ones business, and I've seen Dr. Grabows that will out smoke many fine makers.   It sounds like you've already made up your mind that it's going to be a great smoker, and I hope it is, but I think you won't look at the pipe critically due to the connection is has to Dunhill."
PipeTobacco,3ddhbk,squilliam132457,0,Wed Jul 15 23:31:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah thats what I was able to discover.  As I said, I bought mine before I knew anything about it because I liked the look of it, anything else is a bonus.  It looks enough to me like a Shell Meer second and it is from the period where they were a seconds company using restamped pipes and Dunhill Briar.  How it smokes is far more important than who made it,and I based that on people's reviews of their Own pipes. Time will tell and it wasn't a bad gamble at $30ish delivered :)  I had an old Grabow Grand Duke and a Medico, both of which I rusticated and restained because they were dirty and beat up, I gifted them to some friends who were interested in taking up the hobby. They are two of the best smokers I have ever come across and I almost regret letting them go now.

PipeTobacco,3ddkrh,sartoriuswasahorse,3,Wed Jul 15 13:00:14 2015 UTC,"Welcome aboard. We're in a pretty weird position in Dublin. We have the Peterson's shop, every Petersons pipe and tobacco you could ever want, and almost nothing else. Having said that I can recommend Fox's on College Green. They have their own blends which they sell in 25g pouches for around 10 Euros, so you can try the tobacco without shelling out for a 50g tin. I'm particularly partial to the provost mixture myself, Campanile is a decent blend too. The Decent Cigar Emporium stocks a few blends (including a couple of Peterson's blends which they sell for less than the Peterson's shop - can't imagine that goes down well)"
PipeTobacco,3ddkrh,DominicSherpa,2,Wed Jul 15 13:31:03 2015 UTC,Thanks! I was actually just looking at the Fox's website and was wondered about their own blends! Sounds like they're worth a visit anyway. I'll definitely go drop by soon :)
PipeTobacco,3ddkrh,DominicSherpa,2,Wed Jul 15 14:06:05 2015 UTC,"It's well worth a visit. The house blends are underrated because they aren't widely available I think. They tend to get good reviews on tobaccoreviews.com but you don't hear much about them on forums etc.  It's also a bit cheaper for pipe cleaners and random paraphernalia. At the risk of sounding like Fox's marketing department, keep their pipes in mind too. I have one from their budget range (around 35 Euros) and its a very decent pipe for the money."
PipeTobacco,3ddkrh,LegesAequitas,2,Wed Jul 15 14:59:34 2015 UTC,"Now I'm just waiting for the DominicSherpa sponsored pop up ad to come up :P That's awesome though, a lot more in my price range without having to really go out on a limb for something. Thanks for the recommendation!"
PipeTobacco,3ddkrh,pylorns,2,Wed Jul 15 15:09:13 2015 UTC,"I'm up in the north and there is a local tobacconist in Belfast called Miss Moran's which has a good variety of quality blends. The tax is cheaper up here so if you're ever across the border it can be a good place to check out. I usually order most of my things on gqtobaccos.com which will likely be cheaper than Irish prices as well. I'm thinking there might be restrictions on shipping outside of the UK, but the owner, Glynn, is a very nice guy and I think he will ship if you ask him nicely.   To answer your main question, MacBaren Vanilla Flake could be a good choice from the sound of your description. If you really want to stick with Peterson tobacco then the De Luxe Mixture or Luxury Blend might be good."

PipeTobacco,3dek49,Chuzordie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:35:22 2015 UTC,"Shit. Yeah. I was supposed to review Gold Block for you. I'll get on all three, I've got a little jar of Ogden's Mixture that's been marrying for months now.  My mix of Ogden's is 1/2 GB and 1/2 Bruno Ready Rubbed. It's pretty tasty as a mix, I find both to be lacking on their own. Gold Block will burn your tongue and Bruno is very similar to ODF (which I find boring).   I will say, as far as pouch blends go, Ogden's Mixture is the best you're gonna do at a supermarket or grocery store in most places if you don't like aromatics. Tobacco shops are harder to find, so many just settle for those blends or Condor.   Also, tobacconists aren't supposed to ship to the States, they can incur big fines. That being said, a private citizen won't really get in trouble. My personal hesitation is, if I send stuff out and it gets dinged, it's out of my hands. I just don't enjoy the idea of helping someone throw money away.  Edit: lots"
PipeTobacco,3dfalz,PhysicsNovice,5,Wed Jul 15 20:36:22 2015 UTC,"I like it most of the time, if it's used tastefully. The thing with bamboo is that it takes a lot of skill using such a naturally visually interesting material and blending it with a block of briar and a stem to make it a visually unified composition. On that count I don't think all pipemakers succeed in it. That being said, when done well it can be really spectacular and visually interesting. It just depends on who's making the pipe.  Edit for examples: This is playful, visually interesting, and makes sense as a composition, here I think the bamboo is a little out of place (the bowl's dip below the shank line kind of works against in my opinion), here the pipe utilizes the natural organic structure and nodes of the bamboo to create an almost flower-like piece while balancing the rough nature of the bamboo with a flowing, smooth bowl, and here (probably one of my favorite of the bunch) the thickness and rotundity of the buddha belly bamboo is reflected in the round bowl (sandblasted to contrast the smooth bamboo), with a touch of plateau for a more organic feel."

PipeTobacco,3dcllu,moebbels,4,Wed Jul 15 05:32:49 2015 UTC,"Nice looking pipe. The stem needs a good polish, though.   My local shop has a few Chacom Virgins and I understand they are from the mid '90s. They also have cumberland stems. Yours seem to have a regular vulcanite stem that can be cleaned up with some effort. Look for the sidebar for advice or search for restoring vulcanite stems.  So, can't help much in dating your pipe. But I do remember when I looked through those few Virgins, which all were fill free with a decent grain, I noticed something odd. Two or three of them were truly virgins. The airway wasn't bored all the way through to the bowl."

PipeTobacco,3dbip7,carnesy,4,Wed Jul 15 00:15:33 2015 UTC,Don't really know how to answer that. Besides a bowl of Nightcap these are the first Dunhill blend I've smoked. I have a bunch of their blends sitting here but I haven't smoked them yet.
PipeTobacco,3dbip7,Cycleoflife,5,Wed Jul 15 00:18:30 2015 UTC,"Certainly a fair reply. I quite enjoy Dunhill blends myself as I find them easy to pack and smoke with great blending of flavored.

PipeTobacco,3dbip7,_JackBlue,5,Wed Jul 15 00:22:07 2015 UTC,I don't know how the aged ones I got compare to fresh rolls but the tin note was very plum-y when I opened them and they needed about 10-15 minutes to dry but rubbed out or folded and stuffed they light and burn well. With the darker Va's they are very earth and a bit heavier than I've heard Escudo or Golden Slice described. They provide a noticeable plum/fig note mixed with the Va's when sipped with no spice until you retro-hale.  To be honest these are also my first VaPer flakes so I have almost nothing to compare them too. I lucked out and discovered my local B&M has a large stock of them that never sold from their original order back in 2010 (had to decipher the old style 7 digit numeric code). Needless to say I plan on going back for a few more tins every pay period till I've bought up most of their stock. I think future trade partners will be very happy!

PipeTobacco,3dbsfh,gigadude7,3,Wed Jul 15 01:20:30 2015 UTC,"Your aros are generally going to be packaged damp, that is how they get those smells on the tobacco, so when you light up it smells like a scented candle has been lit, and you wife/girl friend/ significant other doesn't banish you to the woodshed.  the tobacco is also treated with  a ""moisturizer"" to help it retain the ""wet"" which is normally required to keep those scents at their maximum. And if they come in a pouch, as contrasted to being packed in a air tight tin, they are wetter still.  Your Primarily Burley blend probably has very little moisturizer since it is understood this is going to a straight ahead tobacco smoker.  And the same holds true of your London Mixture which came in a nice round tin, which was ""vacuum packed"" [actually only packed with a negative pressure] which is nicely sealed from outside influences until you open it.  The reason that pouch tobaccos have the most ""moisturizer"" [propylene glycol ] is that :a) tobacco needs to be pliable so it doesn't crumble due to rough handling; b) it needs to retain that while sitting on a shelf for months; c) uninitiated smokers (you have been initiated haven't you?  Are you paid up on your dues?) tend to expect tobacco to be that ""wet"" or they think it is no good; d) cello wrapped pouches are inherently bad storage devices, but much cheaper than any others.  That comment ""d"" also applies to tobacco stored in baggies, even zip-loc ones.  They will permit the migration of moisture and gases out, and are not suitable for any extended storage.  You will a rather constant series of comments on here about using glass canning jars, which I do myself when I buy bulks and get more than I will be smoking within the next month.  Unlike some on here, **I do not do this with tobacco that come tinned"", but leave them as they arrived.  Opening and jarring the tinned tobaccos stops the maturing process that was going on since the tin was originally sealed, and it has to restart when you re-package it.  BTW the hotter you smoke the tobacco the less ""taste"" you get from it.  So if you are smoking too hot, not only can you possibly damage your pipe, and burn your tongue, you also change the profile of the tobacco's taste.  That is also a reason to avoid  torch style butane lighters, dreadful things that they are.  LOL"
PipeTobacco,3dbsfh,blenheim45,2,Wed Jul 15 05:14:48 2015 UTC,Dry it out until the point where you pinch it instead of clumping together it fluffs back out.. this should take care of both but try slowing down your cadence some.
PipeTobacco,3dbsfh,BWeice,2,Wed Jul 15 01:50:46 2015 UTC,Even when drying aros properly you may still be left with some moisture and gurgle at the bottom if the bowl. It's always good to keep an extra pipe cleaner with your pipe so you can send it down the stem and shank to dab up the moisture
PipeTobacco,3dbsfh,Slamfrankel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:13:39 2015 UTC,"I'm an aromatics guy myself. I loosely spread my next smoke on a paper towel and put it under my desk lamp about 20-30 minutes before stuffing into a pipe. Some really wet & sticky aromatic tobaccos, like Molto Dolce (one of my regulars), require a bit longer to 'cure' before lighting up. I find it burns better and without much of the wetness or 'gurgle' you are experiencing. However, smoking a 9mm filterd pipe will reduce a lot of moisture as well. If you don't have one or prefer not to use a filter, then drop in some Eriksen Keystones for a cooler, dryer smoke. Also, I've found that better quality pipes seam to burn cooler too. If you don't have the budget for a quality briar, get yourself a MM corncob. Lastly, 'sip' don't puff. Enjoy!"

PipeTobacco,3dc43f,pipeCrow,4,Wed Jul 15 03:42:41 2015 UTC,"The folks that sell estates have generally cleaned them up so they are good to go, unless you are buying the pipe ""in the wild"", as in ""as found"" condition, or from non-specialized sellers on EBay.    Even ""in the wild"" purchases are not generally difficult on briars, mostly time consuming until you get the methods down pat.  There are certain things you will need, and the one that you cannot pick up just at any drug or hobby store is a reamer.  You can go inexpensive and get one of these at around $7 to $8, or go whole hog and get a Senior Reamer! in the $30 to $35 range. The ""name"" on the pocket size one does not make any difference, but having a name almost guarantees it will be made our of good steel.  I misplaced one ""branded"", picked up one cheap in a b&m, patting myself on the back that it was only $3.95.  The cheap one bent in less than six months.  I got another one, this time a Brigham, and shortly afterwards found the original one when I got out my summer shorts, where it had been hiding all Fall, Winter, and Spring. LOL  I have never known anyone to break a Sr. Reemer... ever.  Lose one or get it stolen, yes.  Break... Nope.  Very handy devices, but not so pocket friendly.  Everything else you might need is either already in your house or easy to obtain.  I suggest you avoid pipe cleaners that are dyed from hobby and craft stores, as the dye will generally transfer to your hands and the pipe too if you wet them with alcohol, which at one point or another you will do."

PipeTobacco,3datz3,Desamos,7,Tue Jul 14 21:01:13 2015 UTC,"Use the airtight seals. Where have you read that you don't want an airtight seal? I've never heard that before. What I have heard is that having some air in there initially is a good thing for the aging process. I think this is why McClelland, C&D, GLP don't vacuum seal their tins, but you don't need an interchange of air from an inadequately sealed container. According to GLP, some of the aging goodness begins when the oxygen inside is used up by the microbes and they start using anaerobic processes that produce the flavors associated with aged tobacco. If you don't seal the containers, you're just letting out the aromatic compounds that make pipe tobacco taste the way it does. A little exchange won't kill you short-term, but you want to limit it (by sealing in air-tight containers)."
PipeTobacco,3datz3,tennesseean_87,2,Tue Jul 14 22:41:23 2015 UTC,"That's some really good information. So for aging, I would use the air tight seals then. As for just regular storing, it would not matter then right?"

Save the bail-tops for your daily smokes. Be sure to fill the jar with tobacco.  Some people say you want to compress the tobacco in the jar.  You want some air, but no more than necessary. You want to make sure you get a completely airtight seal -- make sure no leaf gets trapped under the seal. Do not open the jar until you are ready to smoke the whole thing.

PipeTobacco,3d8s2c,AsIfThatWouldHappen,5,Tue Jul 14 11:47:18 2015 UTC,"REVIEW #14  NAME Bayou Morning Flake (C&D)  DESCRIPTION ON TIN A Virginia/Perique lover's delight! We start with Old Belt Red Virginias, add 25% Perique and press the whole lot before slicing into flakes.  LEAF Broken flakes, thick and somewhat more broad than most other blends.Medium to dark brown, fairly uniform, with  red-brown and some light patches spread throughout.  TIN AROMA Figgy, stewed fruit comes to mind. A kind of raisin bran and light toast smell is fairly prominent, the perique is noticeable with its tangy spiciness, and the virginias smell fresh and a little sweet. Definitely a bolder smell with the stoved red VA's as opposed to golden.  TASTE From first light it was nice and spicy, took really well to the flame and just kept streaming beautiful white smoke. The Perique here is delicious, it's spicy, tangy, not overpowering but just right for this blend. It is a sharp flavor, but still very smooth in feel, The retrohale was beautiful, warm and spicy, with that fantastic pepper note. The VA's supported the Perique for the first 1/2 to 3/4 of each bowl, adding some sweetness and cutting through the sharpness, and giving the whole smoke some substantial body. Towards the bottom of the bowl the VA's shine, they sweeten up but still remain nice and bold and dark, like a good red wine. The perique doesn't disappear but moves aside a little to give the Virginia it's 15 minutes of fame. Not a terribly complex smoke, but not overly one dimensional either, very reliable and consistent, I do think this would make a great all day smoke if you like a heavier, bolder smoke with a good nice nicotine kick.It is very approachable. This is coming up in the Community Review soon, but there is also a ready rubbed version that reportedly tastes quite different so experiences may differ for those who take part. I really enjoyed this blend.  SMOKEABILITY Was a little wet in the tin when I opened it, I left the lid off for a day and it was fine after that, I just gravity fed the broken flakes, tapped them down, then packed a little more on top until the draw felt right and it always smoked beautifully. Required very few or no relights, burned slow and cool and never wet, but it likely would be wet straight out of the tin. Made plenty of smoke, all of which was very flavourful,  SUMMARY I really enjoyed my time with this blend, I wouldn't hesitate to buy more, but I may try the ready rubbed next out of curiosity. For some people the Perique may be a bit much, or the Stoved Red's may taste a little off if you haven't had them before, but for a smoker with a bit of experience this is a great blend. Looking forward to the community review to see how the two versions compare in others opinions.  SCORE 4/5"
PipeTobacco,3d8s2c,hedonaut,2,Tue Jul 14 11:50:53 2015 UTC,"Great review, man. An interesting note on the two versions. Typically a ready rubbed has been pressed, cut into flakes, then tumbled out again. The Bayou Morning bulk version is just ribbon cut. There's never been any pressing at all. So the drastic difference between the two smokes has a lot to do with whole leaf being pressed vs being simply sliced into ribbons and mixed.   In any case, this is, as you can tell, one of my top smokes right now. The toasty noted from stoved Virginias that haven't been sugared all to hell and back is fantastic."
PipeTobacco,3d8s2c,C-Ray6,2,Tue Jul 14 13:07:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback and the info. That really does explain the difference between the two doesn't it. Yep, the smell and taste of the Stoved VA's is a nice change of pace for sure."

I swear it is more reminiscent of gym socks. But when I finally lit it up, holy cow! I love this tobacco. Easily my new favorite. Tangy spicy goodness with a very present retro-hale. I enjoy it. Great review."
PipeTobacco,3d8s2c,ijustreadidontpost,2,Tue Jul 14 13:33:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Sounds like it's a decent smoke, I may well order a tin next time I buy. Isn't it great finding a new favourite!"
PipeTobacco,3d95pa,jonmon22,7,Tue Jul 14 13:57:35 2015 UTC,"Autumn Evening by C&D is a good aromatic, it tastes like maple but isn't intrusive to your taste buds. This blend burns ridiculously cool I could not get this to bite and it just billows smoke that tastes great, also you really wont have to fiddle with dry times since it isn't sopping wet in PG and requires little to no drying time making it simple to pack and smoke"
PipeTobacco,3d95pa,BWeice,5,Tue Jul 14 14:35:08 2015 UTC,"I was going to make this recommendation. I think we do beginners a great disservice recommending wet tobaccos to start with. A lot of the wet aromatics out there are very fussy. They're difficult to pack and light, and it's hard to tell how dry they need to be. For that reason, Autumn Evening would make my list, as well as Prince Albert and Half and Half. A corn cob pipe and a dry drugstore burley is the perfect kit to learn on. Autumn Evening is perfect fi you know your friends will dig something sweet."
PipeTobacco,3d95pa,hedonaut,4,Tue Jul 14 15:51:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure ""best of the rest"" would be a good idea. I haven't ever bought any, but from my understanding it is the tailings of the bulk blends they ship. The mix could be anything.   I would suggest something like Chatham Manor. It's cheap, tastes great and easy to smoke."
PipeTobacco,3d95pa,liams_dad,2,Tue Jul 14 14:37:46 2015 UTC,Sutliff Spinnaker is a good one light and strong cherry flavor.
PipeTobacco,3d95pa,lunchboxweld,2,Tue Jul 14 14:30:44 2015 UTC,"Unless you only smoke strong latakias, why not let your friends take a few puffs from your pipes to see what they like?"
PipeTobacco,3d95pa,FullFrontalNoodly,2,Tue Jul 14 16:56:09 2015 UTC,"I would focus on something easy to smoke and pack. Something neither too overpowering nor too dull. And something not pricey, right?   Peter Stokkebye English Luxury - A fairly tasty, good performing light English blend $3/oz Hearth and Home AJ's Vaper - Yes, Anniversary Kake is far superior, but it also bites the whole mouth in a way that might be offputing to a new smoker. Easy going VaPer. $3/oz Carter Hall - a truly phenomenal tobacco, easy to pack and light, very tasty burley-Virginia combo. $4/pouch Dunhill Early Morning Pipe - This is the best performing pipe tobacco I have yet to come across. It has a light smokiness. Unfortunately, for some of us, it also has a distinct soapy tang. $4/oz   So there are my off the cuff thoughts. Light English or Light VaPer seems the natural thing. No aromatics. No flakes. No dark fired. No Nicotine bombs. If you can spare it, get two different kinds of tobacco so that they know up front about the different experiences that await them. Good luck!"
PipeTobacco,3d95pa,antiwittgenstein,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:09:34 2015 UTC,You can get the Hearth and Home Signature Series tobaccos in bulk for a great price.. I would recommend Anniversary Kake and Classic Burley Kake.. Both are in my weekly rotation and are just sublime :)

PipeTobacco,3d7d0n,BWeice,2,Tue Jul 14 03:40:53 2015 UTC,It smokes quite well and fits in my hand very comfortably.   It requires the tobacco to be more dry than some of my other pipes or it will gurgle and it only passes the pipe cleaner test if you reaaally focus.
PipeTobacco,3d7d0n,BWeice,3,Tue Jul 14 03:45:37 2015 UTC,I have a pipe I got off ebay that has a peterson system in place (not sure the technical name) thing is the biggest pain in the a** to get a cleaner down but I love me a freehand I may have to pick one of these up in the future

PipeTobacco,3d7d0n,chewsyourownadv,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:19:44 2015 UTC,"A long time ago, someone decided that if you can slide a pipe cleaner from the button (mouthpiece) to the bowl without taking the pipe apart, it relates somehow to how ""well built"" the pipe is, and presumably how well it smokes.  In my opinion this test only shows if the airway in the stem is aligned with the airway in the shank, going to the bowl.  I have a couple pipes that do not pass this test and they still manage to smoke tobacco just fine."
PipeTobacco,3d7d0n,SupraMario,2,Wed Jul 15 16:50:57 2015 UTC,It's gorgeous. I love the way these things color over time. Do you remember being able to see much of the grain before it colored?

With a cob I feel its safe to do back to back bowls with them your only worry is how fast you smoke out of it, you want to be somewhat gentle so you don't burn it out.  As with flakes I suggest either cube cutting them which is my go to or rubbing them out otherwise they can be a pain to get going. Stokkebye puts out great stuff for the price!"

PipeTobacco,3d5y2q,carnesy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:28:16 2015 UTC,Sounds legit. I don't have any jars at hand so I can't do something like this.
PipeTobacco,3d5y2q,carnesy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:15:21 2015 UTC,"If you decide you don't like the English blends, even after about a half year to a year of aging, you'd likely do better trading them away for similar blend to those you do like. The reason being that besides Aros, latakia heavy blends don't benefit ft aging nearly as well as Virgina heavy blends do.   That's not to say that they don't benefit at all. Most people seem to agree that G.L. Pease (the american king of Lat) blends tend to need time in jar or tin to mature for the best smoke.  However Latakia generally tends to mellow out over time and fade to the background (which can be a good thing as any va's in the blend may sweeten and come to the front as mentioned above in the case of Pease), and tend to be completely pointless and even detract from the blend after ~5 years or so."
PipeTobacco,3d5y2q,Cycleoflife,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:32:19 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that latakia blends peak at around five years of proper cellaring.

But yes, since my order I have discovered /r/pipetobaccomarket and may very well take advantage of it at some point."

Real talk, I don't know how the pressure would impact the cake and, but I don't really imagine any other serious complications. Make sure your pipes are dry and cool before magneting them.

PipeTobacco,3d7exm,Mordenkrad,2,Tue Jul 14 08:33:15 2015 UTC,I recommend felt simply because its cheap and it'll stick to anything with some super 77...  I think leather would be cool though. I don't know what glue to use to make leather and wood stick together permanently though.
PipeTobacco,3d7exm,hedonaut,2,Tue Jul 14 09:07:06 2015 UTC,"Good super glue will go the trick quite well actually. Just think about how well it glues little bits of wood to your fingers when you're working on models. Note, rough up the wood where you're going to set the glue."

But that's the danger with the market right now - a lot of guys coming on to the scene and only the strong survive. To me, Eric was a victim of slightly overpricing his work, especially because his target audience (mostly the IG crowd) doesn't go for $300+ pipes all too often. To make matters worse, I don't think he was able to go mainstream to get more customers for his pipes, so he was screwed whatever way he went. I think what he should have done is make pipes part time for longer and built up a reputation and quality before diving in full time. But hindsight is 20/20 I guess, and I wish him best of luck in his future endeavors.   I also wonder if the price of the pipes already out there from his shop will change significantly in value going forward. On one hand they're an extinct breed, but on the other people will slowly forget about him as time passes and as more come into the hobby that don't have new work of his to look at. I guess we'll see what happens..."

PipeTobacco,3d6d98,FullFrontalNoodly,2,Tue Jul 14 00:31:37 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, IG is a photosharing social network. A lot of newer pipe makers start selling their pipes there because the big etailers aren't going to carry brand new makers.

PipeTobacco,3d6d98,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:19:27 2015 UTC,"i think that is less a case of ""the big etailers aren't going to carry brand new makers."" And more a case of either the pipe makers don't want to split the money with the retailers, or that the quality does not fit the price point... or the quality is just not consistent.  It is a common trait among artists and artisans that they don't see  the value of having other people handle the sales.  that works okay if you are good enough and have made your rep, and your production levels are not that high.    Over the years I have known quite a few ""struggling artists"" who used terms like ""ghouls"", ""blood suckers"", ad nauseum to describe art gallery owners.  Their common complaint was that the galleries did  not pay them what their works were worth, because typically a gallery pays at most 50% of what they are going to price a painting for.  They ignore the fact that most successful artists have been supported by one or more galleries, where they bought the works and then promoted them with showings and brought the artist into the public's awareness."
PipeTobacco,3d6d98,blenheim45,2,Tue Jul 14 04:21:40 2015 UTC,"That may be the case, or probably a little bit of both. I know I've read one or more established artisans on PMF talk about the economics of self-distributing vs. going through SP, P&C, etc. and how the little bits of time communicating with buyers, packaging, making trips to the PO, etc. really add up and keep a maker out of the shop. It obviously brings notoriety as well."

After decades of dealing with the public i can tell you they are frequently wrong, unreasonable, and generally pains in the ass.  and it is a lot easier for a person who is not emotionally invested in the creation to deal with negative comments than it is the creator.  And a lot of people will make them in an attempt to dicker on price, although that is generally not a great ploy.

I never thought he had a lot of trouble moving his pipes, so I'm inclined to believe it may be a personal reason rather than a business move. He was a part timer as well. If it were for business reasons I don't know if he would have sold all his equipment.   I agree with your views as well.

A store usually carries bulk blends, and will usually be willing to let you try a free sample. I'd say go there and grab a pipe, and ask to sample their recommendations. Smoke something there if they have a lounge. Just be sure you buy tobacco there if you sample anything.  Alternatively, have you looked at the Reddit Starter Kits?

In other words, art no longer had an intrinsic quality that defined it; it became just as much about the community, which often had conceptual references or inside jokes. A lot of Modern art leaves me cold for this reason, and avant garde stuff is equally boring unless it's playful."
PipeTobacco,3d3g0p,autowikibot,4,Fri Jul 17 04:20:55 2015 UTC,"It's supposed to be profound and clever. I understand but don't appreciate it. It's become prominent in pop culture lately partly because it's mentioned in ""The Fault in Our Stars"" by John Green and many of the young adults who read that book have created apparel with this on it. One character in the book has shirt with an image of a pipe and the words on it and is very proud of it.  That being said, /u/gardvar has made what is to me a really funny play on the original. The original, I understand but don't appreciate, but this I both understand and appreciate.  Edit: I don't mean to say that I don't recognize that the art was significant. I just don't particularly love this piece on it's own, perhaps because people have been talking about it so much lately."

I'll have to agree with you here generally- Penzance is good, balanced, and quality, but overall there are many more accessible blends that give as good a smoke. Bonehed sent me some as well, but I don't know if it was the same age as the one you experienced. Matches the description, though.  /u/bonehed - Was this the same batch you sent me a sample from?"
PipeTobacco,3d30ag,pixeechick,2,Mon Jul 13 07:17:18 2015 UTC,"Nup, I believe I sent some to you before I acquired the older batch. Yours was from a recently (at that time) opened bag.  Thanks for the reviews /u/chewsyourownadv - perhaps some of the differences, besides vintage, are from crop variations?"
PipeTobacco,3d30ag,bonehed,2,Mon Jul 13 13:26:42 2015 UTC,"Could be. The latakia smoked the way I expected an old batch, being mellow as it was.

The h11 isn't a shapecode....in fact no one really knows what the stampings on the stem is for. I had a signet G-2 on the stem. Some people think they were early prototypes others think it could be batch codes, some even think they are repair or replacement codes. But even the current head boss of kaywoodie is stumped. There is no official documentation even denoting the stem stamps.  quick guide for dating kaywoodies 4 holed stinger pre 1960, 3 hole post 1960 4 digit shape code pre 1930ish 3 digit shape code post 1972, no shape code = modern 1990's I think.

Yes the h11 is on the stem and there are no numbers on the bowl or shank, only the Kaywoodie Super Grain stampings. It's a great smoker and I paid $13 for it and it cleaned up mint which is all that really matters. I guess it will remain a mystery hey.  I have seen and tried to buy a few of the oddities, I really want a Calabash but they are hard to find and harder to afford. A chinrester would be cool for the novelty, and I have bid on a few of the shank logos and ancient KBB Kaywoodies without any luck.

PipeTobacco,3d0o8y,Ciceronian,19,Sun Jul 12 15:04:18 2015 UTC,"You know, I saw the post and the comments and I totally saw both sides of the issue.   The way you set it up could be construed as bidding, particularly when saying you'd take the highest offer.  On the other hand, by keeping offers to PM, people are only making offers they want to make and aren't competing.   In retrospect, I think you're only guilty of wording (and maybe being too transparent), because you easily could've just posted and said ""open to offers"" (without the highest offer bit) and then just sat while they rolled in, and easily turned the others away with ""I'm waiting on response from another offer"" or ""sorry, that's below what I was thinking.""  I guess next time, just say ""hit me with offers"" and leave it at that. And never mind the snark, if lording their pipe superiority over others makes them feel good, they can enjoy being King of the Neckbeards. Sometimes people forgot that criticism can indeed be constructive, and not dripping with pure asshole plasma."
PipeTobacco,3d0o8y,xDemagog,2,Sun Jul 12 15:22:32 2015 UTC,"All makes total sense. Being too transparent and over-explaining what I'm saying... or am about to say... or have just said is a problem for me in pretty much all walks of life.   I do want to be clear, too, that I'm interested in using this example as a case study, because every other time I've seen this issue discussed anywhere it's usually unproductive."
PipeTobacco,3d0o8y,xDemagog,3,Sun Jul 12 15:27:36 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I don't necessarily think you were being shady. You worded your exact intentions, however you were taking the highest offer until a set amount of time. Some believe that eBay would've been a better outlet, however I've seen people do essentially the same thing you did on FB and numerous posts in PTM saying open to offers. So maybe it was just the time limit coupled with you openly stating you'd take the highest offer? Idk, the more I think about it, the more a sillier it gets."
PipeTobacco,3d0o8y,WoodsmansBriar,2,Sun Jul 12 15:36:34 2015 UTC,There's really no rules or whatever against offers. At the will of the market ultimately.
PipeTobacco,3d0o8y,WoodsmansBriar,0,Sun Jul 12 16:27:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it just seems like there's a bit of a culture that exists of decrying the market and SMHing whenever anyone anywhere in the supply chain does something other than share freely (which, in my own moment of self-righteousness, I should point out that I have done my share of, typically on Instagram.)"
PipeTobacco,3d0o8y,WoodsmansBriar,3,Sun Jul 12 16:31:46 2015 UTC,"...and the market will dictate if that is ok or not. If you get a buyer then it's obviously acceptable. Sometimes people just need to get off their high-horse.   I'd say you're not in the wrong, but that's me. The community, here and elsewhere for pipes is fickle."
PipeTobacco,3d0o8y,Aedan382,6,Sun Jul 12 16:36:06 2015 UTC,"Markets are great in that you're more then free to offer any price you see fit for an item. If someone is willing to pay an amount for an item, then you do have a market for it. That's kinda how free markets and other economical factors play into it all.  Now for the whole ""Seek profit from another piper..."" that's a two way street I guess. B&Ms and online e-tailers and plenty of others do this all the time, that's how businesses operate. Now if you're just a guy who's looking to let a fellow piper procure a hard to find tobacco, I support there's two thoughts. 1. Ask for the price you paid for it + shipping/other associated fees to get it to the buyer. 2. Make a profit.   I can see both sides of it to be honest. I'm more then happy to purchase tobacco that folks cannot find locally and sell/send it to friends for the cost of tobacco + shipping. That's been a pretty standard ratio for cost to product for a while now. At the same time, it's a free market more or less, and if people are making offers for well above that price point then someone is willing to buy it.   I ultimately suppose these are facts everyone knows, however sometimes it's worth hearing again. Don't like the price, then bugger off. Like the price, then buy it. If people complain enough to shove you out for selling your product around here, then I suppose it's the marketing dictating the terms.   My .02 cents."

Shut your mouth and move on.    I've had some cigars I got for x price, someone asked me to sell them some a while later, and i asked for about $1 more a stick than I paid, because dammit I LOVED them, and that's the number I felt would be worth it for me not to smoke them myself.  Don't like it? Tough titty, go find them yourself.   Don't take it personally, if someone offered you a price for the penzance you liked, and you want to sell it, do so.  I'm from the opposite end of that particular spectrum.  I've tried 3 bowls of penzance someone sent me as a sample, and I don't ""get it"". Do I denounce those that do? Nope, I keep my mouth shut and keep looking for guys who buy EMP, Nightcap, or 965 and don't like it, and I offer to take it off their hands hah!"

PipeTobacco,3d0o8y,Mordenkrad,2,Mon Jul 13 01:39:09 2015 UTC,"I tend to believe in the free market idea of real prices - that the actual value of them item is the lowest the seller will part for it and the highest the buyer will fork out. For structured markets, this is roughly approximated, but when it comes to an auction like yours, that is about as pure a free market you can get.   My only - yes unsolicited - advice would be, if you get another bag of Penzance/Stonehave/80 year old unopened Virginia Flake or some other mystical beast, sell it piecemeal instead of a bag at a time. Why? Well, the preponderance of the sub are newish, young, and poor. They can't/won't/shouldn't fork over $$$ for a huge bag of something that is a tad overhyped. But if you split the bag up, you can get $10+ an ounce, $6+ a half ounce, etc, without anyone thinking you are gouging them, because at that point, they are just happy to try something that is otherwise nigh impossible to get their fevered hands on, and with minimal impact their ramen budget."

Benefit of the doubt, it's a Sunday and perhaps they have better things to do. Still, If no one offers an opposing viewpoint after an invitation to civil discourse, but decides to continue to swoop in whenever a leaf of tobacco is sold or purchased anywhere at above a price they personally deem right and good, then honestly that's pretty disappointing to me."

What you're missing is that the ptm is more or less a clubhouse of friendship and manlove. We don't gouge. It's never really been a friendly place to people in the game to make a profit; it's for redditors trying to trade and sell with other redditors. r/pipetobaccomarket has a long history of throwing shitfits when people break with the unspoken code of conduct, and you should look at the top controversial posts if you ever want a good laugh.

In fact I don't know exactly how he could have handled it better, given his stated need to turn it into cash, not ""trade bait"", and his obvious misgivings about how the blends like this are being sold by others.    there is nothing in the post that violates the written rules of the ""market"" that I can see, so why is /u/Ciceronian supposed to know that he has violated the rules of your very unofficial ""club"", and for that matter why should he care?  Are you under the impression everyone there is playing by ""your set of rules""?  the fact that guys historically price pipes below the level of professional sellers, such as Smokingpipes.com or pipestud probably reflects that they have significantly lower costs than the pros do.  They don't have to pay employees, pay rent on a physical location, etc., therefore they can afford to sell cheaper.  Do you expect to see someone who has stumbled on a Dunhill for $20 turn around and sell it for $50, just so they won't be ""gouging"" their buddies?  I don't.  And just out of curiosity, why the hell didn't you take up the debate in a civil manner?  And while I do not know /u/DenverTele well enough to judge why he commented as he did, I do know enough about Todd Johnson to know that he makes great pipes, but has no great reputation for any social graces (and that comes from people who like Todd).  I am old enough to remember when Dunhill pulled distribution from the US, and almost overnight Dunhill tins went from $8 to $50.  Or when SG lost most of their tobacco due to mold and the same thing happened as people ""had to have"" their tins of Commonwealth, Balkan Flake, and all the rest.  No one forced anyone to buy at the inflated prices that were posted, and I for one didn't.  But if I had had tins to sell I certainly wouldn't  have wanted argue with someone who wanted to pay me what the market value had become, even if I thought (as I did) that that market value was downright silly."

I don't.   Actually yeah I do that exaclty. I found an unsmoked 1962 dunhill for 80 and sold it to someone on here for 150 shipped from canada where shipping was 20, yeah I made a bit of profit, but it was WELL below market value. Why? Because I feel the same way are mordenkrad and devertele. But you're right, not everyone plays by the same rules. Is there any thing morally wrong gauging for full ebay retail? Depends who you ask. Ask me and I'm always going to say yes, especially when you're selling on PTM."
PipeTobacco,3d0o8y,soymilkisgood,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:59:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe I am naive but I did not see this post as an attempt to gouge.  I saw a fellow with mixed feelings about the whole thing.  IF he had want to get maximum price he should have taken it to EBay or something similar perhaps selling it on consignment through 4Noggins (and believe me, that causes me pause, when i see what appears to be over-priced new tobaccos there).  And if he were comfortable with ""gouging"" would he have put in the that little bit about don't bid more than you can afford?  I don't think so, at least if I were trying to max the price I would not be discouraging bids.  I routinely sell pipes to members of our small pipe club, and at the last meeting on three pipes sold, two of them I told the members that their offers were too high.  One offer was $35 and we settled at $20, one was $60 and we settled at $40.  Each of the pipes were probably worth the offered price, but I am not in this as a business and I did not have that much tied up in them.  But that is my choice, not something I am compelled to do, AND I was dealing with fellow club members.  I still made a small profit on each of the transactions, about which I feel no guilt whatsoever. LOL  I don't even follow these things closely, so I have no idea what the 8 ounce bag in question lists for MSP or what it goes for in the current after market.  But wouldn't he have to have had quoted a set price to make it specifically ""gouging""?  I think what P&C is reported to do, instantly inflating the price when it comes in, much more reprehensible than offering an in demand product to the highest offer on PTM."

Its his right to do so, I'm not going to start removing posts over there because I feel the price is too high. If it sells, wonderful, if it doesn't that sucks and lower the price and try again.   I'm not saying anyone is compelled to give the members of this sub or PTM a discount, its a free market and at the end of the day the buyer determines what the value of something is, not the seller. I could go on there right now and put up a kaywoodie bulldog and ask 300 bucks and if someone is happy with that price then thats the value of a kaywoodie bulldog at that moment. It's a free market and it sorts itself out.  My PERSONAL gripe right now is that someone got their feelings hurt and decided to make a huge spectacle of it calling out other members of the sub, that's not cool in my books"

PipeTobacco,3d0o8y,majkeli,2,Tue Jul 14 02:10:08 2015 UTC,"It's honestly a tough and very fine line to walk. I've only ever sold one bag of Penzance and one of Stonehaven, and I went to eBay when I wanted to do so because I knew trying to sell at a profit here would be frowned upon. However, when I have pipes to sell and the like I always sell them at below the price you'd be able to find them at online so everyone comes out a winner. Like others have said, I think explaining yourself too much may have hurt you a bit too. Who knows."
PipeTobacco,3d0o8y,DenverTele,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:00:22 2015 UTC,I was actually eyeballing one of your Ardors not two minutes ago.  I tend to try and avoid eBay for tobacco. Largely because I myself have far overextended myself in auctions and I legitimately feel like I AM price gouging there. But also in part because it seems like every day their tobacco policies are getting tighter. I too tried with a bag of Stonehaven and had it pulled despite the fact that I followed the policies to a T. The reason they gave was that it's available at retailers (I asked them to let me know which ones so I could buy from them.)

Long story short...you don't get the crux of this community and that's sad.  There's so much more to it than you're allowing yourself to participate in.    Yeah, you can charge whatever you want for tobacco, and there will always be somebody willing to pay premiums to the point of ridiculousness.  But I doubt you'll ever see the connections, community, and friendships that you otherwise could if you stopped treating this sub like a profit center.

I guess where I'm frankly just confused and to be honest, as foolish as it sounds, a little hurt is that I do see more than a profit center and would like to be part of this community. I've traded in PTM. I've put up WTT and WTBs before this WTS. Yes, you're entitled to your opinions about ""premium pricing"" but I think it's also worth pointing out that the community you care so deeply about also really does seem to encompass folks who are self-aware, in their right minds, and willing to buy a bag of Penzance. And while we can argue back and forth all day about the free market and numbers, I guess what I really don't get is why in this rich, supposedly welcoming community where friendships, connections, and community abound, a dude who's been around for a bit (not, admittedly, as a very active participant, but up until now a very civil one) gets dismissed like a troll for putting up a WTS Penzance post that, if anything, is OVERLY polite."

Okay, then why are you calling me out?  Here's the deal: Pipetobaccomarket is a free market. We don't moderate much over there. The main things we look out for is spam, and people who have a track record of selling items and never shipping. We'll pull those posts. Now I don't give a damn if you have a pound of tobacco and want to sell it for $10; cool, someone is going to get a good deal. I also don't give a damn if you have a pound of tobacco and you want to sell it for $500. Is it gouging? yeah it is, will you find a buyer? Maybe IDK, and personally it's none of my business how much you make on that bag of tobacco, for all we know you could have $450 into it.   What bothers me is when you post in another sub looking for someone to pat you on the back on tell you its okay.    My advice: go fix your shit. Update the codes of conduct. I suspect you WON'T though. Because if you do, you'll have fewer opportunities to trot in and gush self-righteousness.   Fix what shit? Someone called you out for gouging and you got your feelings hurt? What do you want me to do? Send them to a corner and make them think about what they have done? As many people on here have said before PTM is a free market and the buyers will determine what sells and what doesn't. Why do you think /u/soymilkisgood is able to sell so many pipes? Its because he's a quick shipper, with a good track history, and he doesn't gouge. Could he charge 20-30 more per pipe? Yeah probably, will he sell the same as he was before? No.  If you don't want to sell anything on PTM thats fine with me, there are alternatives. Just don't forget the 20-30% fee's that are associated with being a seller on ebay; also those are probably going to go up soon because ebay and paypal are becoming two separate companies again.  I'm bottom lining this Sell YOUR stuff at what ever price YOU feel comfortable at, but don't go running around crying bloody murder when a stranger on the internet let you know they didn't like your business practice."

Charging $70+ for a bag that isn't considerably aged is just duping suckers.  Yeah, there are suckers, and suckers will pay what suckers will pay...but that doesn't make us any better of a community for taking advantage of them.

PipeTobacco,3cytfw,cubicleninja,2,Sun Jul 12 02:29:42 2015 UTC,"Very nice. Typically I don't like the draw on cobs because I'm not a filter fan. This has just the perfect draw. The stem is comedically bad, I must admit. Came in warped to the right with really bad finishing on the bit (jagged edges and whatnot). I refinished the bit by hand, touched up some of the finish here and there, rubbed up with my mix of beeswax and mineral oil, and away she went.  I had to put some work into it, but I do enjoy the pipe. Was it worth the cash? Walks a tightrope, but leans just a little toward being worth the money. I'm pleased with the bowl size and everything.  I dedicated mine to Frog Morton On The Bayou. Easily my new favorite blend."
PipeTobacco,3cz8k9,likedunhill,5,Sun Jul 12 03:12:51 2015 UTC,"I would advise against storing pipes in a tupperdor because you want them to dry out after smoking. Same thing with pipe tobacco - I'd say don't store it in the tupperdor because the ideal humidity for pipe tobacco is about 15%, which is far lower than that of cigars. Just keep the cigars in there and nothing else."
PipeTobacco,3cz8k9,soymilkisgood,3,Sun Jul 12 03:18:00 2015 UTC,"I think you're confusing relative ambient humidity with moisture by weight. (Or it's worded confusingly...)  This from Greg Pease: ''Tobaccos quickly take on flavors and aromas from their environment, and we don’t want our cigars tasting like pipe blends, or vice versa. And, it turns out that while cigars are happiest in the region of 65-70% RH, a somewhat lower range is more suitable for pipe tobaccos. At an RH of 60%, pipe tobaccos will tend to stabilize near 12% MBW, and by 66% RH, it will find itself approaching 14% MBW. At 70% RH, the tobaccos will go beyond 16% MBW, which, as discussed, is too high for proper smoking. Keep them separate. They’ll both be happier, and so will you.''"

Some people will swear up and down that S. Bang is THE brand, THE maker, the most sought after thing out there. Two minutes later you could be having a conversation with a guy who only wants to snuggle up to his gouged-to-pieces rusticated poker with a spinning skull ring and thinks straight grained pipes are prissy and boring.  I think the solution to finding a slightly better starting place might lie in having you describe what you look for in a pipe. Of your cheaper pipes, is there one particular shape or style that strikes your fancy? Once you start to hone in a bit on what you like to smoke, hold, and look at, then we could start to do some serious looking into which brands and makers really executed that general kind of pipe well.  If you're looking into estates, it might also be useful to think about some of the basics of restoration; you can score yourself a really top quality pipe for a song that someone did a poor job listing because they thought it was a piece of junk, when really it just had a stem begging for some oxiclean and a shank that needed a few (million) bristled pipe cleaners."

I like Dunhill and Ardor pipes but am not partial to any one kind. So really I wanna learn whats good to buy and what to avoid. Any reading material would be cool, and just learning whats popular and what quality pipes are is where i wanna start."
PipeTobacco,3cy2lj,Ciceronian,3,Sun Jul 12 03:02:23 2015 UTC,"Richard Carleton Hacker is one author and notable collector I've read. The crowd is divided on him. Heck, I'm divided on him. He can turn a phrase and clearly knows a great deal about the industry. He does occasionally throw out misinformation in terms of smoking technique. He also quite a high opinion of himself and any of his books will leave you feeling like you shouldn't bother with pipes until you are wealthy enough to afford cabinets full of Dunhill Dead Roots. Here's one of his less patronizing books: http://www.amazon.com/Pipesmoking-Century-Richard-Carleton-Hacker/dp/0931253152/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436672543&sr=8-1&keywords=richard+carleton+hacker  On the complete opposite end of the spectrum, you can pick up this e-book for free: http://www.amazon.com/OLD-BRIAR-Pipe-Smoking-Budget-ebook/dp/B00557L6J2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436672751&sr=8-1&keywords=old+briar. It's repetitive and a bit dated (""let me tell you about a great thing called the Internet, and this great site called eBay."") But the guy has a clear passion for quality estate pipes in the less-than-$100 range. Some solid restoration tips in there as well.  One of my personal favorites is this set of essays from Fred Hanna (who created Wilderness and Legends for McClelland). Again, redundant in some places, but there's a lot of variety here—covers smoking technique, pipes, and tobacco. And he's a fine writer to boot: http://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Smoke-Gourmet-Relaxation-Reflection-ebook/dp/B00GYHDWCQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436672917&sr=8-1&keywords=the+perfect+smoke  In terms of brands... I absolutely adore Charatan's Make, particularly from the First Lane Era. It's still very, very possible to find high quality Charatans for a steal on the Bay. (I picked up a stunning Charatan Special a few weeks ago for less than $30 and restored it. Smokes great. I would value it at over $100 if I were selling it.) You mentioned Dunhill, and they of course are considered the gold standard by many—go to Pipedia and research them a bit. All told, if classic pipe shapes are your thing, you might do well looking into some English estates.   Danish estates are in a world of their own and are solid if you're looking for more exotic freehand shapes.   There's also currently a lot of really cool things happening on the American front with artisanal pipemakers. I would definitely proceed with the most caution there, though, because IMO, there's also a lot of really crap things happening."

If you hunt around the estate market you'll find plenty of deals good enough that you can experiment without breaking the bank. As for the ""sought after"" pipes, almost every pipes of every kind is sought after by someone. There are all sorts of collector's out there. Don't worry about that for now, though. Just look for the pipes that appeal to you and fit within your budget. Eventually, you'll learn what you appreciate and what you want to seek out.  Oh, and I definitely second the idea of learning the restoration basics if you're going to play around in the estate market. Very few good deals will arrive in a smokeable condition despite whatever claims the seller may make. A simple ream and clean is easy to do and will get most any pipe back into the action as long as it isn't otherwise damaged."

PipeTobacco,3cx17s,CBNathanael,4,Sat Jul 11 15:02:27 2015 UTC,"As seen in a previous Piper U, I'm getting the hang of the basics.   I have a tough time keeping my pipe lit. Now, I know it's common for it to go out frequently, but what I'm experiencing feels excessive. If I puff aggressively, I get tongue burn, but if I go slower, I get maybe four or five puffs before it goes out. In the end, I've probably gone through 15-20 matches.   Does this have to do with packing? Tobacco too wet/dry? Simple impatience?"
PipeTobacco,3cx17s,PipeBeard,6,Sat Jul 11 23:43:40 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the tobacco is too wet. Pinch them, and if they stick together, they're too wet (the converse is that they will turn to dust - crisp is ok).  Lay it out on a paper towel in a single layer and let it sit for 20 minutes or so, maybe more, maybe less depending on the blend.  I tend to think people fret too much over packing technique.  Get it in there evenly, not too loose, not too tight (milkshake through a straw is as tight as you'd want to go. Looser is ok).  The initial light, tamp, light, tamp is just as critical.  Light in circles while puffing for a charrig light. The tobacco will curl up.  Tamp it out while puffing.  Then light in circles while puffing for a true light. The tobacco should stay flat and the ember should fill the top of the pipe.  If it doesn't, use matches until it does, while puffing.  Then puff and tamp, and you should be good to go.  You'll usually have to have relights, and that's part of it.  Drying the tobacco will help cut that down a bit."
PipeTobacco,3cx17s,CBNathanael,2,Sun Jul 12 00:07:11 2015 UTC,"Good info about drying it. I've done some reading on drying, and either misread or flat out missed any descriptions of how it should feel. Mine's definitely wet, the pieces are pretty sticky.  As for the packing ""milkshake through a straw"" -- how is that even possible without going crazy when pushing it in? Even the description of ""water through a straw"" is ""impossible"" for me. Using the three-step or Frank method, there's not a major difference between full and empty."
PipeTobacco,3cx17s,Piffyr,3,Sun Jul 12 14:36:44 2015 UTC,"Not meaning to sound pithy, but the answer is, ""yes."" It could be any of the things that you mentioned and most likely a combination of all of them. Don't worry, man. It's a rite of passage type thing and you'll get it if you stick with it. Read all of the info in the WIKI (great stuff there) and tweak one small thing each time you smoke. Nothing's going to change if you keep doing the everything the same way. Eventually, everything will fall into place and you can finally turn in your pipe smoking training pants."
PipeTobacco,3cx17s,CBNathanael,2,Sun Jul 12 00:18:08 2015 UTC,"Even in writing, I knew the answer was ""yes"" ;)  I'm just trying to glean any little bit of info I can.

Hint: A smaller bowl might preserve the light better for some of the blends that are harder to dry. Aromatics seem to work best in smaller pipes for me. It might inaccurate given that it's my personal experience. Let us now if it helps at all.

PipeTobacco,3cx17s,PeskyPrussian,5,Sun Jul 12 14:41:01 2015 UTC,"Hello Folks,  I've got a beautiful Unfinished Savinelli.  However, the bowl does have a few decent sized spots filled with a pinkish/tan putty that really sticks out like a sore thumb as the rest of the wood color darkens.  Does anyone know of a good way to get the putty out of those fill holes?  I'm planning on replacing it with briar dust and glue combo that seems to look a lot more natural.  I've tried picking at it with needles and knife blades, which might work eventually but the stuff almost cement like."
PipeTobacco,3cx17s,tennesseean_87,3,Sat Jul 11 16:32:30 2015 UTC,"I would think the briar dust wouldn't color if mixed with super glue, so you'd run into the same issue if it got darker.   Why not rusticate it if you get the fillls out?"
PipeTobacco,3cx17s,PeskyPrussian,3,Sat Jul 11 18:36:04 2015 UTC,"I've thought about that as well, however it would be a bit of a shame considering the rest of the grain on the pipe is beautiful except for those couple of spots."
PipeTobacco,3cx17s,tennesseean_87,2,Sat Jul 11 18:39:19 2015 UTC,"That's why you get those pipes that are smooth with random rustication in a few select spots. I don't personally care for the look myself. If the border between rough and smooth is otherwise integrated into the design (facet on a blowfish, rings on a bulldog, transition from side of bowl to rim), it's fine, but otherwise it looks like a pipe that should have been a second or fully rusticated that is being sold up as a mostly-smooth. Do what suits you, though!"
PipeTobacco,3cx17s,Piffyr,3,Sat Jul 11 19:19:05 2015 UTC,"Most of the time I use a dental pick to remove fills, but I also use a sharp pointed probe set from time to time. You can get dental picks from eBay and probe sets should be available at just about any hardware store.  A briar dust/CA refill is going turn out darker than the surrounding briar. How much darker depends on the size of the dust particles, consistency of the mix, etc. They won't look as bad as the pink putty fills, but they'll still be pretty obvious. If you're going to go that route, you might want to consider just going ahead and completely refinishing it and adding a stain. You'll already have done all the hard work with the refilling. If you choose a stain that's a bit on the darker side, it should do a good job of blending those fills."

PipeTobacco,3cx17s,Kal-ElofKrypton,3,Wed Jul 15 13:43:21 2015 UTC,"Why should I buy an expensive, brand name pipe? What are the benefits over a $35 no-namer?"
PipeTobacco,3cx17s,blenheim45,6,Sun Jul 12 01:01:51 2015 UTC,"If you know how to spot the flaws and know how the flaws either will or will not affect the smoking qualities of the pipe, then fine buy the cheap pipes.  [And BTW $35+ is not an ""expensive"" pipe.]  Most companies using actual briar do not set out to make cheap pipes.  The low end pipes  are either are either to get ""something"" out of the faulted briar they end up with, or the pipes that have gone wrong during the manufacturing process. This can be simple cosmetic flaws like sand pits, more major wood flaws like missing chunks or cracks, or things like being mis-drilled.  Some are simply cosmetic, some can dramatically affect the smoking quality.  If you can identify the faults and know what they mean in how a pipe will smoke, then you can find good values in unbranded basket pipes.  The import of a ""brand name"" is the declaration by the manufacturer that ""this is a pipe that our company made and we are proud of it"", the lack of a known name is a declaration that ""we may have made it, but we don't want to hang our reputation on it.""  the only other way to make a cheap pipe is to cut costs on the materials and labor, such as using cheaper woods, such as fruit tree woods, instead of briar. do the math, a $35 retail price probably means a $17.50 wholesale price, which would represent $8.75 total cost (materials, labor, packaging, overhead, etc.).  Now  figure out what the wholesale cost of a chunk of briar and a ready made stem would be.  You have probably gotten real close to the wholesale cost already, haven't you?  If you need to stretch your budget, check out EBay lsitings for small lots and see if you can't score 4 or 5 pipes for a modest price.  You will have to clean them up, which is not exactly rocket science, and you may end up with only two or three goodies out your ""lot"", or you could be lucky and they may all end up being good buys.  And almost anything you buy will not require a full break in period and be a better pipe than your new ""sub $35 pipe"". YMMV"
PipeTobacco,3cx17s,BrackGin,2,Sun Jul 12 08:48:13 2015 UTC,"This is enlightening, it's useful information. But how do you tell a 'good' pipe from a 'bad' pipe if it's not cosmetic or carpal-tunnel miss-drilling? I'm also trying to figure out if my grandfather's pipe's which I own now are worth a good penny ,but that might be a post of itself, safe to say none of them have branding and I'm not sure what to think."
PipeTobacco,3cx17s,blenheim45,3,Sun Jul 12 12:06:30 2015 UTC,"You can't necessarily tell for sure, but you can recognize the ""signs"". Rustication can be used to hide flaws or just unpleasing grain.  Really dark and opaque stain can be used to hide the same thing. Combine the two... uh oh.  If you have followed discussions on here very long you will have noted people complaining about the failures of even brand name pipes.  sometimes it is something relatively minor, such as a finish that bubbles or changes color unexpectedly, sometimes it is more substantial.;  Generally the brands will stand behind their products.  But what you have to worry about is buying without that assurance, so you look to raise your chances of being right.  On estate pipes I am very aware of color changes where they would not be expected.  We all expect the rim to be darker, but when one side of the bowl is that raises a warning flag.  Pipes you already own, such as your grandfather's ""heritage"" pipe, the proof is in the smoking.  As to the dollar value, that is only truly important if you are going to sell it, and very  few ""unbranded"" pipes from the past century (other than meerschaums) have any real dollar value."

PipeTobacco,3cx17s,blenheim45,3,Sun Jul 12 22:25:47 2015 UTC,"There really is no set value to used pipes.   The value is set when a willing buyer and a willing seller agree upon a price.  There is a matter of honour and responsibility though when you have more knowledge than the other party, and they rely on you to value a pipe.  If Mrs. Smith comes to me and says her husband died and she knows I smoke pipes, what are his pipes worth to me, and he has high end pipes it is wrong for me to tell her $10 each.  On the other hand if i walk into a antiques store and find these same pipes priced at $10 each, then that is A-Okay in my book.    I offered a 1928 Dunhill shell to a buyer at Chicago Pipe Show in May and he offered $175, and knowing his rule of thumb that meant he would have offered it for $350 (it unfortunately had a replacement stem or it would have been worth 2Xs as much).  I thought I had a buyer at $235 so I turned him down, but not because his offer wasn't fair.  I thought it was a fair offer, in fact sold him four other pipes that night.  His company has a right to make money on the transaction, and quite honestly he can get more for a pipe than I can, because so many people shop with confidence with the company.  YMMV"

Quiet different, but a real knock out blend. I also reviewed this earlier this year. Classic Burley Kake - Sort of a dressed up Prince Albert, it is sweet with a bit of chocolate and liquorice flavor to it. Carter Hall - A classic mixture of burley and Virginia, it is sweet and fruity, nutty and bready at the same time. A must try for any pipe smoker."

If you're looking for a more English style, the English luxury was very good, but not as Burley heavy (still noticable though). It had an interesting sweetness to it.

PipeTobacco,3cuaw2,Piffyr,4,Fri Jul 10 22:03:47 2015 UTC,"I get it. A local community news crew shows up at your business to do a short piece on it. They don't really care about the history of the business. All they want is a short clip that makes the area and the people look good. So, you give them what they want...   ""Moved down from Chicago, because during the war it was very difficult to get raw materials across the ocean. Mountain laurel, which grows indigenous to this part of the country, was deemed to be the best replacement. They originally started digging the raw material and getting it ready and making them in Chicago, but they determined that the employees in northwest North Carolina are very diligent, hard working, good people. So, they moved the entire business here in 1943.""   But for those of you in the pipe community that really are interested, you should know that almost all of that is inaccurate.  There were no Dr. Grabow pipes made in Sparta, North Carolina in 1943. There was, however, a sawmill owned by D&P Pipe Works that cut mountain laurel ebauchons. It had been there since at least 1942. The blocks they cut were used to make their own branded pipes and also sent to Henry Leonard & Thomas, Inc. (HLT) in Ozone Park, New York for their pipes. Henry Lavietes (the ""H"" in HLT) was the brother of David Lavietes (the ""D"" in D&P) and son of Paul Lavietes (the ""P"" in D&P).  HLT closed down their operations in New York and moved to Sparta in 1944, but they didn't do so because they thought the North Carolina people were diligent and hard working. They did it because their labor force in New York wanted to unionize and southern workers were less inclined to such things.  Dr. Grabow pipes weren't made in Sparta until 1953 when HLT bought all of the assets and equipment of the Dr. Grabow Pipe Company, which had been located in Chicago, Illinois, and moved the operation to Sparta."

They can just puff away at it pleasantly while they go about their thing, sorting raw leaf or working one of the cutters. I don't smoke aromatics often, but when I do it's typically Autumn Evening for the same reason.

Cavvicchi, from the Scuderia series uses port as one of the main components in the topping. A by-country navy flake would be neat. I don't know if sake would come through well in tobacco though, and likewise for tequila. Liquors need to have quite a bit of flavor to really come through well in the smoke. I know scotch works nicely. I'll tinker around on the idea with some of the blenders on Monday.

Some of the pipes I have had when I have.convinced friends to take up a pipe and have a leisurely time with me have been great  The feeling of sharing that satisfaction with others is great, even if you just sit in silence and stare at the smoke rising.  When my friends come over now, my pipe cabinet is like a lolly shop to them.  Good luck, hope you find a pipe mate!"

Grant has been a long time DE supporter and is a great marketer so adding him to their pipe division is natural. Hopefully he realizes that the current line of DE pipes is garbage and can change some things around for the better. I just hope it doesn't make him completely drop off the face of the earth as a pipemaker.

PipeTobacco,3ctbnt,soymilkisgood,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:00:34 2015 UTC,"Well, even if he continues to make pipes he wouldn't be competing directly with them at all, so I doubt he'd have a non-compete.

PipeTobacco,3crqhn,hedonaut,6,Fri Jul 10 15:26:55 2015 UTC,"Since when have we become the cigar industry?  Seriously, though, have any of you ever noticed the drastically different kinds of people who tend to rise to the top of each industry. On the cigar side you have guys like Rocky Patel and Jonathan Drew who both look like they're in a constant party kind of mood. Meanwhile, the pipe side is led by guys like Pease and Kevin Godbee who look more like university professors than career hedonists.   Even the ads are different. It's rare to see anything pipe related with half-naked women the way you see it with cigars. Once in a while you see a 'Women of Pipes' kind of photo-montage, but even then they're at least trying to be tasteful, even if they're not succeeding. I wonder what causes such a stark division in the moods and attitudes associated with each hobby.   As a bonus, it seems the pipe world wasn't always as tasteful as I'd like to believe. (NSFW)"
PipeTobacco,3crqhn,DavidPx,7,Fri Jul 10 13:25:22 2015 UTC,"There has always been a sort of Freudian undertone to the cigar users image, at least in my memory, ""if you catch my meaning, if you get my drift.""  The bigger the better, and if you got it flaunt it sort of attitude.    Cigars are an in your face proposition, with a ""I see your piddling little ten dollar stick, watch while I light up a Gurka and turn your weekly salary into ash silly boy.""  And while we have some pipe smokers who have a flaunt it attitude, I recall seeing  a fellow walking through the smoking tent in Chicago with what appeared to be a reverse calabash about the length of a baby's arm and dressed to the nines in a hipster way.  My immediate response was, damn that has got to be an awkward pipe to smoke, but there was no ignoring it.  Most non-smokers haven't a clue whether you have an expensive pipe or a Dr. Grabow in your paw (they can see cob and know cheap though), and even knowing smokers can't tell if you have a vintage Dunhill or an Everyman without a close look.  And whatever you have, you don't throw it away when you are done.  Even in the 50s and 60s, pipesmokers who could flaunt it, Heffner, Sinatra, der Bingle for example, smoked pipes that looked just like those of the grocer, the carpenter and the high school principle."
PipeTobacco,3crqhn,robomonkey94,6,Fri Jul 10 15:08:54 2015 UTC,"Its the aroma of pipe tobacco though.. unlike a cigar where someone can see it burning and look at the ring wrapper like a price tag.. good smoke from a pipe is a visceral thing.. has to be savored up the nose.  I don't want just any schmo pawing through my leaves of leisure.  Tobacco of the pipe is to be shared among friends and discussed, not lauded around like a trophy wife. That is the difference that I get from it."

PipeTobacco,3cr5ap,kafkadre,4,Fri Jul 10 03:12:30 2015 UTC,"Foray is just one of those strange words I use, not a pipe term. It technically means a small raid or invasion, but it is used colloquially as term for trying out the unknown.   By kindest I mean it is the easiest to prepare, light, and keep lit. The deal with flakes is - they can be a bear to light on fire. They are dense and frequently much, much more moist than ribbon cut or whathaveyou. The Newminster flake only takes 10-30 minutes of drying time, can be smoked with the stuff'n'fold method quiet easily, takes the match easily, and will keep it's cherry. On top of that is pretty tasty, ages rapidly, and doesn't bite. It is the perfect first flake for a new smoker. Oh, and it is like $3 an ounce online."

PipeTobacco,3cr5ap,hedonaut,3,Fri Jul 10 17:19:40 2015 UTC,"Back home in Pennsylvania, there was a park called Moon Lake. It had been officially closed due to finding problems, but the owner of the land allowed people to come up and fish or bike in the park through the day. The gates were closed an hour or two before sunset and opened again sometime in the mid morning. Being the nightowl that I was, I was never up there early enough to get in during 'business hours'. A friend of the owner had given me permission to wander around in there when the gates were closed though. It turns out, my motorcycle was narrow enough to safely fit through the boulders used as a baracade to the park. I used to go up an hour before sunset in the summer and autumn and ride down though the tiny, twisting roads over the relatively hilly mountain terrain and down to the shore of the lake. There I'd park my bike next to ""my"" picnic table and go for a walk for 45 minutes or so and enjoy the scenery. I'd come back to my table in time to pack and light a pipe while I watched the sun set, then read on my kindle for an hour or two as darkness fell in earnest.

Just be sure you bring the cast iron up to temperature and let it cool completely in the oven so it doesn't crack from thermal shock.

Seriously though just the usual pipe cleaner swabbing with a maybe 2-3x a year bit where you put it in the oven or just inside your fireplace with a good hot fire going. This burns up alot of the more stubborn gunk that will accumulate making it very easy to scrape off once the pipe cools.

Someone will come along and read this and think there is truth behind it, and then desiccate the hell out of their tobacco, then scorch their tongue and be miserable. Yeah, some tobacco (read: Gawith flakes) need to be dried to some extent. Yes, bone dry tobacco is a bit easier to get lit. No the tobacco will not taste better just because it was easier to light. No, not every tobacco needs to be, or even should be dried before it is smoked.   Also, I get that its fun to rag on aromatics, but (1) that's what 99% of people have in mind when they decide they want to start smoking. So you're effectively saying ""hey, you know that smell your after, not going to get it. Instead smoke this, it smells like roofing tar, but its what all the cool kids smoke (and I like roofing tar). (2) Plenty of folks do, in fact, enjoy aromatics.   I know this was meant to be funny, and not taken seriously, but the thing is, new folks come here all the time, and someone is going to take this to heart."

Yeah it was probably made tongue in cheek; but how many threads has newbiez posted help i can't keep my pipe light, or my pipe gurglres, or all I get is steam and hot air taste.   The aromatics part was kind of like a small jab, but other than that hopefully people we get it reinforced in the back of their mind that tobacco needs love and a little time to itself, maybe it needs to spend the weekend over at her sisters place to think through things.....wait.....

PipeTobacco,3cnoem,scriptonic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:54:41 2015 UTC,"I encounter blends that need to be dried a bit from time to time, but nothing that I dry out as a matter of course.  With the exception of the newest iteration of FVF, I can't think of a single one that I would automatically let dry before I smoke it. I remember the 2013 Christmas Cheer needed about 10 minutes, but the 2014 was good right out of the tin. I can't think of a single ribbon cut blend that needed any drying, and I smoke plenty of aromatics.   I think people overly dry their tobacco for two main reasons, first I think people are too quick to blame the tobacco rather than look for some error in packing or puffing, and second I think we are placing too high an importance on lighting and relighting."
PipeTobacco,3cnoem,DaveInPhilly,-1,Thu Jul 9 20:49:12 2015 UTC,Well....to be fair then sounds like you are the kind of person who would benefit from this graph. You should dry out your tobacco

Why do we jar tobacco and store it moist then dry it before smoking? And stating 'dry your tobacco' seems kind of vague as it doesn't really help anyone learn how dry their tobacco should be.

Golf tees are generally made of polypropylene or high density polyethylene (HDPE) now if it's the last one then it should dissolve in acetone and I have it on good authority (http://pipesmokersforum.com/community/threads/tar-in-pipe.3445/) that acetone will not dissolve a pipe stem.  Having said that I imagine you would need to leave it for some time to start work on that tee and I'm not sure anyone has ever been crazy enough to leave a pipe stem in acetone for long enough to test whether it also eventually starts to dissolve.  EDIT just realise that I may have misunderstood and the tee may be stuck in the wooden part of your pipe - in which case you should be fine, I'm pretty certain that acetone will not dissolve briar though it almost certainly will remove any finish on there.

PipeTobacco,3cn8ri,goshdarnitguys,2,Thu Jul 9 05:39:52 2015 UTC,"From carnesy:  Answer a few questions for us to help us figure out what you'd like:  -Saccharin or savory sweet?  -Tea or coffee?  -How do you take your tea/coffee? Brewed weak or strong, lots of cream and lots of sugar, a little cream and sugar, some of one and none of the other, dark and bitter?  -Which do you like the smell of more? Fresh cut grass, dry hay, the loamy earthy smell of half rotted leaves in the late fall, or a campfire?  -Do you like dark fruits like plums and figs?  -Do you like the tingle of black pepper in your nose when you get a strong hit of it?  -Rich and hot from the bakery bread or something a day old with more grains and bit more dense you can sink your teeth into?  -Rich BBQ sauce or charred well seasoned, meat bark?  -Do you like something straight forward and in your face or do you want something complex to sit and ponder and try and figure out just what it is that ephemeral taste in the background is?  If you can answer any or all of these, it will help establish your taste profile in your own mind to serve you with future smokes going forward, as well as give us some clues to either make outright recommendations or suggest pairings of possible combinations of tobacco and drinks to try.  Basically I came up with these questions as I was helping my local B&M guy help a rather clueless lady figure out what kind of cigar to get her husband for his birthday. Over the last few weeks I've been turning them over in my head and expanding on them in more idyllic moments. These thoughts have helped me get a more nuanced taste for some of the blends I've had since coming up with them.  What I've come up with is the Earthy rotted leaves, dark strong coffee and hardy dense bread (to me) are indicative that he may like burley.  The fresh cut grass and dry hay (lemon/yellow and red/dark respectively) and the fresh warm bakers bread equate to Virginia's. The questions about the black pepper and dark fruits are to see if he may like perique mixed with his Va blend.  The campfire would point to Latakia blends with the dark charred burnt ends off the BBQ would make me recommend Syrian Lat as opposed to the general woodsmoke of Cyprian. If he wanted a Latakia blend to sit and puzzle out I'd offer up Ashton's Artisan Blend, a rather complex blend, as opposed to Pirate's Kake which is a straightforward punch to the face. If he wants refined sugar type saccharin sweet as opposed to savory, I'd point him to one of the better aromatics depending on what kind of candies/treats he likes.  If you want to make those questions into a diagram that should help get you started with a quick and dirty breakdown. Obviously others can offer up/be consulted on their opinions on what type of leaf falls into what taste profile for further refinement as well."

From my understanding when it comes to Va/VaPers you can't go wrong with the bullseye, twist, or navy flakes.   If you like things a little more English I hear tell that the Proper blend is good and the English Oriental Supreme is a very respectable Balkan blend while the English Luxury is a slightly sweeter smoke do to the inclusion of Cavendish.

If you call them im sure they will adjust the prices accordingly for you. They have pretty good customer service on the phone as long as you are nice to them haha
PipeTobacco,3cmwpj,SupraMario,2,Thu Jul 9 14:41:04 2015 UTC,Yep have to buy at least 4 ounces PER BLEND to get the discount.

PipeTobacco,3cmwpj,SupraMario,2,Fri Jul 10 14:11:58 2015 UTC,"Hmm.. Well the Bullseye tastes like fresh grass and a little creamy brown sugar to me. I love the stuff. The Navy is sweet but not over powering. It has a little rum or whiskey taste on the exhale. Its good with a nice cold Soda. The Twist is its own special thing and it seems to be aging the best out of the lot. Its naturally sweet and def creamy but the flavors keep changing on me. I have not tried the two you mentioned so i cant speak honestly about them. If you like naturally warm, no tongue bite tasting tobacco, the cub cut is phenominal! It mixes well with other blends too. I may do this deal tonight and get some Navy Flake, Bullseye, Twist, and Cube Cut"

PipeTobacco,3ckoe5,ChefPD,6,Wed Jul 8 17:37:14 2015 UTC,"I’ll try to keep this short and sweet. My father has a small collection of sperm whale teeth along with plenty of other whale antiques and generally loves sperm whales. Around 30 years ago, he bought a smaller tooth that he cut into three pieces, the tip, and two smaller cross sections. Not too long ago he gifted me the cross sections with which to do whatever I pleased. They were the perfect size for a pipe ferrule, and being the pipe fanatic that I am, decided to get it put onto a pipe. As far as smokeability and comfort go, David Huber makes some of my favorite pipes. So, I decided to go with him for the commission, and luckily enough, he had a block of strawberry wood, which I absolutely love. It’s lighter than briar, smokes beautifully, and takes a great blast. We talked turkey for a short while, and after a long waiting period, the pipe is finally complete, and it looks to have been totally worth the wait.   It’s a sandblasted strawberry wood apple with oval shank, whale tooth ferrule, and cumberland stem. This pipe will not only be a great reminder of my father’s memory when he passes, but mine as well when I pass this pipe on as a family heirloom. All in all, this is the most important pipe in my collection. I hope you like the pictures, all courtesy of David, /u/dshpipes.  Thanks again, David."

It's also the smoke I take with me when I go out. I know I'm going to enjoy it, and everyone around me will not complain about the room note. For me it is an everyday smoke.

Since then it's changed hands more than once, but, as you can see by looking at the briars offered today, Ropp has maintained plenty of classical French style. This even includes pipes still made with one especially notable feature: real horn stems, something which these days has become quite a rarity, only very occasionally cropping up either from independent artisans, or on surviving estate pipes of a vintage as similarly great and distant as that of the Ropp marque itself.''

PipeTobacco,3ciihi,DenverTele,2,Wed Jul 8 14:27:53 2015 UTC,"Sure thing. I was curious to see if it had similarities had you tried it. I kind of want to get my hands on some kinnikinnick now, but I'd almost feel irreverent doing it. I would feel like I was chowing down on unblessed communion bread. It's not wrong, per se, but doesn't feel right either."
PipeTobacco,3ciihi,hedonaut,2,Wed Jul 8 14:42:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the kinnikinnick itself isn't any more sacred than anything else.  If you want to load up a cob (I'm guessing it would ghost like nothing else, so I'd definitely suggest a cob!) and smoke kinnikinnick I don't think any Native is going to give you crap about it other than to ask why you weren't smoking something better.  heh-heh  Now, if you loaded up some Frog Morton in a chanunpa and puffed away it would be bad form.  Chanunpa are sacred and should only be used in ceremony.  Native Spirit tobacco used to make a kinnikinnick blend, but I don't see it anymore.  Shame, it wasn't bad."
PipeTobacco,3ciihi,DenverTele,2,Wed Jul 8 14:48:10 2015 UTC,"Noted. I appreciate the direction there. Being that I didn't know, I didn't want to assume."
PipeTobacco,3ciihi,hedonaut,2,Wed Jul 8 15:01:26 2015 UTC,"Yes. American Spirit used to make a kinnikinnick called Pow-Wow Blend. I think it was discontinued several years ago because I haven't seen it in a very long time and it's no longer listed on their website. It contained--going from memory now--tobacco, sage, yerba buena (mint), willow bark, bearberry.   I really liked the stuff. I didn't smoke it all the time, but it was a nice change-up now and then. To my taste, it was a little light on the tobacco and I would usually add a little more tobacco to it. It had a nice ""warm"" smell/taste when exhaled out of the nose. I'm not good at describing these things but it sort of reminded me of the spice cumin a little. My dad loved the smell when I smoked it around him and once remarked that it smelled ""like a Utah wildfire."""

It will smoke with out one, just need more punctuality in cleaning without the ""stinger"".  Do make sure it is not lodged down the air hole as that does cause problems.  It can get pushed down ther if a pipe cleaner is run down without removing from the shank first. [Been there, done that.]"
PipeTobacco,3cifif,blenheim45,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:35:48 2015 UTC,"It has a stinger. I removed it after looking up what it was and finding out that most people didn't like them. Also, it is loose in the tenon, so it falls into the shank every time I smoke it. Should I try and secure it somehow? Or just leave it?"
PipeTobacco,3ch6gq,felloutthevault,9,Tue Jul 7 21:47:26 2015 UTC,"I believe everyone's idea of moderation is going to be different, me personally I have never smoked more than twice in a day and have not smoked a full 7 days in a week. Too much I could see being really hard unless you really have the time haha, a bowl usually lasts me 45 minutes - an hour hour and a half. Now obviously people can do half bowls, or smoke tiny full bowls depending on pipe size but usually after a smoke if you like the pipe you let it rest a day and if you're going to be wanting bowl after bowl I figure your collection of pipes is going to have to be huge!  this is going to be my take on it and it's my opinion only 1-3 bowls a day 4 days a week is fine, just don't make it a habit more than a hobby go out and smoke when you feel like it not because you feel like you need to! Happy smoking.  *edit: I'm really glad to hear you stopped smoking cigarettes, I've seen it lay a destructive path to a lot of close people in my life it takes a very strong will to do that.

PipeTobacco,3ch6gq,BWeice,8,Wed Jul 8 12:51:08 2015 UTC,"If done as a relaxation activity and not because you feel you need it, it's moderation.    The way I think of it is like beer.  I love beer, but have less than 1 a week.  Why?  Because the situation I can truly enjoy a great beer is not a frequent occurrance.    Same with pipes.  You need time free of major distractions.  For me, that's a quiet period at work (I do from home call center work, so there's no smoking policies).   Once the calls come in though, it stays out as frequent relighting leads to gurgling and is just stressful.    That's about 4 times a week for me (about 3-5 bowls total), give or take depending on call volumes.  In other words, if you have to ""make time"" for it, it's potentially reaching a dependency (either physically or mentally).  If you use it as a means to pass some free time enjoyably, well that's fine."

PipeTobacco,3ch6gq,carnesy,3,Tue Jul 7 21:54:40 2015 UTC,"There's not a ton of data out there, and I always think that any time we put smoke into our bodies, there are risks.  But the one big study that we see quoted every now and then was done by the surgeon general in either '69 or in the early 70's suggested that pipe smokers who do so in moderation 'may' live longer than non-smokers (I'm on mobile, so I'll try to find the source after posting).  This has been heartily debated among the pipe community, but I think we all wanna believe! (I have thrown this stat at my wife more often that I care to admit).  IIRC, I think that THEIR benchmark for moderation was less than 4 pipes per day (so, 1-3).  I smoke at least one pipe every day, 2 per day at least once a week, and maybe 3 or 4 per day once or twice a month.  I tend to consider that moderation, but ymmv.  EDiT: It was 1964, with a subsequent report in 1979 alltering the findings.  Here is one article of many about the studies http://www.meerschaumstore.com/health.htm"
PipeTobacco,3ch6gq,PipeBeard,2,Tue Jul 7 23:08:54 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the study has been proven complete bunk, smoking...anything, is bad, period.  This does also mean sitting in traffic inhaling car exhaust...is also bad."
PipeTobacco,3ch6gq,SupraMario,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:04:03 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  The risks can be different, but my wife works in oncology and sees pipe smokers frequently.  There are even some prelimary studies on the risks of certain types of vaping (saw a recent study that in some cases, the formaldehyde levels can exceed that of cigarette smoke?).  Any time we put smoke into our bodies, there are risks. The biggest reason I wanted to add that study was for their definition of moderation.  It helps me sleep at night ;)"

I think if you absolutely can't go the week without smoking you may have a problem."
PipeTobacco,3ch6gq,hammeat,2,Tue Jul 7 22:08:40 2015 UTC,"I smoke about 4 times a week, but I never keep track. The absence of habit is moderation enough for me. Sometimes more, sometimes less. Never find myself ""needing"" a smoke."
PipeTobacco,3ch6gq,Cobwarden,2,Tue Jul 7 23:52:10 2015 UTC,"As of yesterday, I was doing a daily bowl stretch for like two or three weeks. I'm taking a break today while I wait for my P&C shipment to come in. I ran out of pipe cleaners, so I'm just going to shelve everything until the P&C box comes. I've been extremely stressed at work lately, and this order from P&C coincides with a huge relief from work. So, I'm going to probably go back to a bowl every other day once the box comes in."
PipeTobacco,3ch6gq,csobod,2,Wed Jul 8 01:49:25 2015 UTC,"As everyone else has said, it's subjective, but personally I equate an average size bowl with three cigarettes (I spend about the same amount of time smoking). So if you smoke once a day that's about a pack a week, albeit without inhaling.  I'd say a pack a week is moderation, but it's still probably not great for you. I smoke 2-3 bowls a day currently, although I've gone as high as 5 a day, so I'm above moderation and into ""habit"" by my own rather arbitrary scale. I do feel nicotine cravings, but it's not like I'd kill for a pipe. It's just a feeling that I really want a pipe so I can relax. Of course, tobacco is addicting so I'm not surprised. I weigh the risks, the same way I do with my diet. I could be healthier if I completely cut out soda from my life, but I still have a soda about twice a week because I enjoy it."
PipeTobacco,3ch6gq,JCelsius,2,Wed Jul 8 02:49:10 2015 UTC,"If the weather is nice I will usually smoke after work and maybe twice on weekends. If it's too hot or cold or snowy or rainy or...well you get the idea, I don't smoke.  I smoke my pipe to relax. If I can't relax while doing it, I don't smoke. That's my moderation."
PipeTobacco,3ch6gq,lightningserpent,2,Wed Jul 8 10:37:26 2015 UTC,"Moderation is different for everyone, so I can't speak to what your moderation may or may not be.   I would like to talk about cigarettes with you. I know it's not what you asked for but I feel like I should offer my unsolicited advice as a piper and as a reformed cigarette smoker.  Sometime soon you will get a sense of comfort that you have finally stopped smoking. It will feel great. Finally! You may feel like you are out of the woods, and, since you aren't addicted, you can maybe smoke socially once in a while. Maybe out at the bar, or at a party. Maybe after a good meal or good something else. I mean, you're not addicted any more so what can it hurt?   Please don't fall into this trap. Some people do have an iron will and can smoke socially, but for me it was a false sense of security. I ""quit"" 4 times and each time I started again the same way, a social cig every once in a while led to buying a pack led to buying a carton a week. For me, it was a slippery slope, and before I knew it I was full blown, pack a day habit again.   The last time I quit I resigned myself to never smoking again. Ever. And I haven't. Pipe smoking didn't start until maybe a year after I quit cigs, and I didn't treat it as a replacement for them. I doesn't sound like that's your aim, either, so that's good. I only smoke for the enjoyment of it, which is something I never said about cigarettes. I have been cigarette-free since April 21st, 2012.   Good luck with your cessation and many happy pipes!"

As long as you live under their roof, it's right to show appreciation and respect by abiding by their rules.   Secondly, but of equal importance, honesty is paramount. Without delving into morality or ethics here, the repercussions for your relationship with your parents will be far worse if they find out by accident instead of hearing it from your mouth.   Sit down with both of them and half a frank discussion. Show you understand the risks. Explain why you enjoy the hobby. Explain that it is a hobby. Liken pipes and cigars to a glass of wine with dinner and cigarettes to alcoholism (not far from the truth in some ways). Explain how you take measures to secure your health and resist addiction.

Hell no but he just wants me healthy, but out of respect I guess you can say I sneak in a smoke when he's not around.. Does it make me feel good? no not at all but it's a decision I make. I have a nice collection going on but I don't make it an eye sore for him so it's kept hidden but he at least knows of (some of) it.   I wouldn't say he's disappointed but more on the lines of concerned as what a parent always is, concerned you are doing the best for you and your well being. If you can express your hobby to him in a manner that you understand the risks but also do it for such and such reasons then his reaction is what's final if he hates it, hide it don't anger him go for a walk and find a nice spot or hang out at a friends just be courteous.   Me living in an apartment complex, my neighbors see me all the time with my pipe but I make sure to keep it away from all of their windows or open doors to be polite and not have my god awful smell in their homes same with my own, I spray myself down or just wait it out before stinkin' up the place he provides me with.

The only context I could think of where tobacco oil would ever come up in this sub is in the context of dried tobacco losing its oils and not tasting as good, but that's neither here nor there.  Edit: Here's one. Good luck!"
PipeTobacco,3cgh7t,DaveInPhilly,2,Tue Jul 7 19:17:55 2015 UTC,"I brought it up in the leather craft sub a while back and there wasn't a lot of relevant experience. Most people are avoiding treating the leather because they're unsure of what effects would come from oils and finishes potentially seeping into the tobacco. There was more concern about affecting the flavor than any health concerns, as you can stick to vegetable oils and beeswax if you're worried about standard finishes actually harming people. I'll keep looking."
PipeTobacco,3cgh7t,hedonaut,5,Tue Jul 7 19:28:05 2015 UTC,"I have no idea what you're looking for. If such a thing exists, I would suspect that you would need to reach out to the tobacco farmers directly. Besides continuing your goolge search, you may want to reach out to the folks at Cornell and Diehl (info@cornellanddiehl.com). I know the Tarlers worked very closely with the tobacco growers. Craig has passed away, but I believe his son still works there and may be able to point you in the right direction."
PipeTobacco,3cgh7t,hedonaut,2,Tue Jul 7 19:18:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll do this. I appreciate the lead!"
PipeTobacco,3cgh7t,mile_high_me,4,Tue Jul 7 19:30:25 2015 UTC,"Just a note, that email address redirects to my inbox anyway. I appreciate the warm regards from /u/DaveInPhilly, but none of us actually know. I ran back and chatted up the master blender to see if he knew anything, and he had never heard of anything like that either. Most tobacco extracts are used as pesticides. As such, it would seem to me that the best option would be any food safe vegetable oil. Small amounts are already used in a lot of aspects of tobacco production like lubing the sides of forms when making presses, so it won't bother the taste at all. Sorry we couldn't help more."
PipeTobacco,3cgh7t,hedonaut,3,Tue Jul 7 19:36:36 2015 UTC,"It's not often that I get a response to an email before I can finish writing it. Thanks!  Since I've only seen reference to it in scientific papers, I was worried it may be a rarity (they may have produced it specifically for those studies).   I'll stop looking and go with my backup plan of jojoba oil with a thick finish of beeswax. Palm and coconut oils are commonly used, but I have other reasons for avoiding those. Thanks again!"
PipeTobacco,3cgh7t,mile_high_me,4,Tue Jul 7 19:52:36 2015 UTC,"Sure thing. As long as we have you, is carnuba wax ever used on leather?  EDIT: We call it quantum blending. We blend tobacco before you even knew you wanted it."
PipeTobacco,3cgh7t,hedonaut,3,Tue Jul 7 19:54:25 2015 UTC,So I just have to say I want a special blend but have no idea what I want in it and you'll instantly know what I want?  That is customer service at its finest.

I mean, there are a bunch of pipe shapes that interest me, and some that don't, so I think it'd be better to be able to select multiples.  Also, regarding the prices and types of pipes, I think they need to be matched up.  In other words, if it's a high grade artisan pipe or a smooth pipe, I could see paying more for it, while I wouldn't want to pay $200+ for a relatively new artisan doing partially machine made rusticated pipes.  Anyway, I answered with my top preferences, so hopefully that'll help with some guidance about what to go with for next year."
PipeTobacco,3ce11d,crimsonrat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:11:35 2015 UTC,"First, I'd like to see multiple options allowed. I mean, there are a bunch of pipe shapes that interest me, and some that don't, so I think it'd be better to be able to select multiples.

This why the last ""question"" was put in place. This survey is just a guide to gauge where peoples interests are at. General shape, price point, etc. Obviously a $50 high grade artisan is not going to happen, nor is a $400 rusticated machine made billiard."
PipeTobacco,3ce11d,PipeBeard,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:50:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  I guess I figured it'd be easier to check off multiple shapes rather than a freeform text box where I just relist the shapes that are already listed that I'm interested in, but whatever works for you guys is fine by me.  For the second point, I was sort of thinking that there should be some way for me to say ""I'm willing to spend up to $100 if it's a factory pipe, but up to $200 if it's artisan.  I don't want to spend more than $200 though"".  Or something like that.  But hey, if this gives you a good idea of what to organize, then that's all that counts.  Thanks again!  I'm looking forward to the result."
PipeTobacco,3ce11d,carnesy,2,Wed Jul 8 13:06:27 2015 UTC,"If we end up with a savinelli or some factory thing we've done ourselves a great disservice. We have buying power, and that gives us the opportunity to get a good deal on a great pipe. the J&J pipe is a prime example of what we CAN have.   So, aim high motherfuckers. Have some taste."
PipeTobacco,3ce11d,soymilkisgood,2,Tue Jul 7 23:47:13 2015 UTC,"It is not a great disservice not picking a high grade artisan maker every year for the poty. The simple fact of the matter is not everyone here can/will drop 300 bones on a pipe. This is why I added the price range question, and currently only 5 people have selected any of the ranges from 200 and up, while 21 people have picked the 100-150 mark.  As for the hand made/factory/artisan question the 2 pipes out of the same shop is a clear leader right now."
PipeTobacco,3ce11d,Mordenkrad,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:55:54 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this one. If I wanted to buy a factory-made Sav, I could just hop on smokingpipes.com and go to town. A PoTY is a fantastic opportunity to leverage a little bit of economics of scale and get something really nice at a significant discount—the fact that this year's PoTY is in the $250-350 range is just insanely discounted, imo."
PipeTobacco,3ce11d,soymilkisgood,2,Fri Jul 10 18:13:21 2015 UTC,I agree about not getting factory pipes for that reason.

I like it, and wil certainly pick up another one.  It essentially directs the smoke towards the roof of your mouth.  It was weird getting used to at first, but I've grown to really like it, especially with Burley blends."

PipeTobacco,3cdlty,spudlytater,12,Tue Jul 7 02:16:20 2015 UTC,"As other have said, if you find that you are tempted to smoke every day, but are afraid to because of your health, you are better off quitting. I think all of us that partake in tobacco products know that they could be bad for us, hell, they could kill us (though studies show that pipes and cigars are no where near as bad as cigarettes) but we choose to use them anyways.  Why do we use something that we know is bad for us? I can't speak for every one here, but for me, it is because I would rather enjoy this little pleasure in life and just not worry about it, then deny my self the pleasure just because it is bad for me. Now, there is nothing wrong with not doing something because it is bad for you, it actually makes more sense then willingly doing something that is bad for you. However, for me the pleasure outweighs the risk factor and frankly, I would rather enjoy the time I have on this earth than worry about everything that could do me harm.  So what you need to decide, is whether your pleasure or your health is more important to you. However, keep in mind that if you are worried enough to ask about your health smoking as little as you are now than chances are you will never, truly, be able to sit back and enjoy a nice bowl of tobacco. Every time you smoke you will probably be thinking ""will this be the one that does it?"" even if it isn't at the front of your mind, that thought will be lurking in the back of your head.  How do I know that for sure? Because I used to be like you. When I first started smoking cigars I was super afraid of getting the big C. I loved tobacco and nicotine, but I was super afraid of what it could do to me. Eventually I really had a thought about my life, thought about what it would mean to get really, truly healthy, and realized that I didn't care enough about my mortality to give up so many things that I enjoy because of it. Hell, I could give up all the things that are bad for me and live a clean life for a year, then get hit by a bus, or have a brain aneurysm or some such. Or I could live as I do now, happy and moderately healthy and live to 100. You never can know for sure and living life based off of ""what ifs"" just isn't a way to live in my opinion."
PipeTobacco,3cdlty,shavinghobbit,3,Tue Jul 7 03:14:46 2015 UTC,"I second this, i always asked why do we measure life in years instead of how enjoyable it is? Call me odd but id rather live a shorter, happier life than a longer more stressful one"

PipeTobacco,3cdlty,scriptonic,6,Tue Jul 7 07:03:32 2015 UTC,"Wow. Well, I really appreciate the responses. Maybe I should be a little clearer. In addition to smoking, I also love fried chicken. I would probably eat it every day if I could, but I know that would be really bad for me, so I don't. I think moderation is the key to a healthy, happy life. I have no issue with moderate smoking, I just don't want it to turn into an eating fried chicken every day kind of scenario, if that makes sense. Because this is the first addictive substance I have ever tried, I don't know how to gauge whether I just enjoy it or I am forming an unhealthy habit. I'm looking for advice on that. If the advice is, ""If you can't tell, quit,"" then I have no qualms about that. I don't want to eliminate a joy in life by being overly cautious, but I also don't want to form a habit I can't break. Thanks again, everybody."
PipeTobacco,3cdlty,pixeechick,7,Tue Jul 7 03:38:10 2015 UTC,"Remember: addicted or not, every time you light up is a choice to do so. Put it down for say two weeks and see how you're doing. If you've not felt a craving to pick up the pipe, you're probably in the clear. If you're still obsessing, take another two weeks off and see. You should be able to ""forget"" about it in a sense.  For me, whenever I am in your shoes, this is what I do. Recently my SO asked me to take a couple weeks off because of a respiratory illness going around. My answer was ""absolutely"" without reluctance or hesitation. Sure- I was saddened to be parted from my pipes, but knowing that it was temporary and for his peace of mind, it was easy. If I were addicted, I would probably have been looking for ways to sneak one in.  See how the break goes and how you respond to it. You'll get a pretty good sense from that where you should go next. Good luck!"
PipeTobacco,3cdlty,jonmon22,3,Tue Jul 7 04:31:35 2015 UTC,"I will second this.  I know for a fact that I am not addicted to pipe tobacco because of the lengths of time I have gone without it. If you are worried about being addicted, then lay the pipe down for 2 weeks or maybe more. You will have a better sense of how much of an 'addiction' you have."

PipeTobacco,3cdlty,SupraMario,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:07:46 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent point. While I have tried those things, I have never done so on a regular basis.

PipeTobacco,3cdlty,KoldProduct,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:04:30 2015 UTC,"I think the children of this comment have things spot on, and I think you've got the right mindset as well. I went through my first pipes with extreme caution...I smoked like once every two weeks, just because I was worried about the health risks. Then some nice weather came along and I met some friends who piped, and for like three weeks we smoked and talked late into the night every night. Then things got really busy at work and I didn't smoke for a couple weeks. I thought once or twice ""Man, it would be nice to sit on my porch and smoke some"" but I never considered even bringing a pipe to work. From there on out I proceeded with much less caution because I was more confident in my knowledge that I was not addicted.  Edit: Man, the end of that sounds like a conservative textbook. I generally smoke on my weekends because my workdays don't leave me any time. Sometimes more, sometimes less. I am still perfectly confident that I'm not addicted."
PipeTobacco,3cdlty,raizel_234,10,Tue Jul 7 20:17:23 2015 UTC,"If you're worried about the risks you shouldn't partake. If you are worried about your self control, you should not partake."

PipeTobacco,3cdlty,hedonaut,4,Tue Jul 7 05:52:09 2015 UTC,"I also try to smoke not much more than once a week. What I've found though is that I'll get more into it and smoke 2-3 times a week for a while, then other times I'll go weeks without smoking at all. As long as it averages out to what I'm going for I don't stress about smoking a few extra times in a certain week.  As long as overall you can meet your goal don't worry about doing it more some weeks and less others. Smoking that rarely you aren't really addicted to the nicotine in my opinion, so it's jus a self control thing not an addiction thing."
PipeTobacco,3cdlty,BeggingforQuestions,4,Tue Jul 7 05:21:42 2015 UTC,"Let me give you a look from the other side. I am a nicotine addict. I used to smoke cigarettes. I moved to vaping and got off the nails, but over the last few months, I began to resent the fact that my vape was permanently fixed to my face whenever it wasn't preoccupied with food, a pipe, or sleeping. I cut back and back on vaping, using my pipes and snus to keep things at bay... and it's been awful.   Don't get me wrong, I effectively smoke for a living. Two to three bowls of pipe tobacco a day if a-okay with me. But, to my horror, I've come to realize just how dependent I am on nicotine. The first day with no vape and nothing to supplement made me feel like a drug fiend, which, in a way, I suppose I am. I'm currently using some snus and limiting myself on daily smoking, 2-3 bowls a day right now. After the big pipe and cigar trade show coming up, I plan to cut back completely for a little bit. Maybe drop down to a bowl a day, then take a week or so off all together. I want to appreciate my nicotine, not just scratch an itch.   I can't say what the risk of addiction is for you, and it's certainly very different with pipes as opposed to something you inhale. Inhaling lets the nicotine hit your system much more quickly, which, in turn, makes it more addictive. I've know guys who smoked a few bowls a day who could give it up without a thought. I, for one, have to be a bit more careful."

PipeTobacco,3can8r,Turbostar66,2,Mon Jul 6 18:07:00 2015 UTC,"Yes indeed! In my opinion, your stem is amber, making it a pipe which probably dates to the early 1900s.

They did have a resurgence in the 50s, but were mainly limited to human heads and the eagle claw. Mind me asking what you paid for this pipe?"

PipeTobacco,3can8r,VfV,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:16:08 2015 UTC,"Got a photo? There are very few fake meerschaums out there; the majority are a handful of models of very, VERY ornate antique-style pipes with over-decorated shank bands and big curved ""amber"" stems; a few of the earliest fakes even have ""Gustav Fisher"" (Gustav Fischer was a famous carver, who did not sign his pipes) and the name of a Vienna trade exhibition (written in English, despite it being supposedly Viennese). These were made from plaster or, in some cases, plastic, and some have a mold line on them. I still see them on eBay occasionally.  Here's one. Others include a tulip with a nude woman coming up under it. They always have those chunky ""silver"" stem ferrules. Did you get one of these types?"
PipeTobacco,3can8r,Turbostar66,2,Mon Jul 6 16:25:20 2015 UTC,"I don't have a photo, but I will try to find one later. I was able to return it to the seller (who didn't know it was fake...she claimed it was something brought back from overseas by someone in the military.)  It was a basic sultan head with a curved plastic stem (looked similar to this, minus the silver washer on the stem). It was unsmoked.  It was very heavy (which instantly made me suspicious) and just didn't feel like meerschaum...I have several real meers. Plus the stem had a screw-in mouthpiece like I've never seen before...the threads were actually in the stem of the pipe...there was no sleeve or anything. The mouthpiece screwed directly into the bare plaster. EDIT: The pipe shank was the ""female"" part, and the mouthpiece was the ""male"" part."
PipeTobacco,3can8r,Turbostar66,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:05:22 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I read this.. a friend of mine bought one off ebay that matches your description. He doesn't know much of anything about pipes but he figured he could sell it to me once he got bored with it haha, he takes on my hobbies but it never sticks.   Anyway if I get a hold of it I will snap some pictures and show it to you. I hope it's real meer even if pressed because it will be in my possession soon and it needs a lot of TLC. If I remember correctly the shank was threaded and the stem screwed into the shank but it is loose and also the mouth piece was chewed through leaving me to believe it was plastic. Do you know of anyone who would be able to fix that?"
PipeTobacco,3can8r,Turbostar66,2,Mon Jul 6 18:11:06 2015 UTC,"I hear about ""pressed"" meers occasionally, but to my knowledge, no one has ever offered evidence up of one of those. I think the most likely knock-offs would simply be plaster of paris.  Is it heavy? A meerschaum pipe will gain some mass as it absorbs moisture, but the fake sultan head I had weighed as much as a real meer twice its size.  As for the mouthpiece, real meers sometimes have acrylic stems, so the stem itself isn't always the tell. It is very hard to tell from photos...you could always take it to a pipe shop to see what they think if you are suspicious."

The reason I mention the mouthpiece is even with clenching the guy before must have been hungry the bottom half including the button is missing I figured it would have been better quality or at least chew proof haha.

PipeTobacco,3cargn,Cycleoflife,5,Mon Jul 6 13:46:44 2015 UTC,"In the lore of Middle Earth, Tobald Hornblower (a Hobbit) was credited as the first person to smoke tobacco or Hobbit's Weed/Leaf. Until Tobald smoked the Leaf it was merely admired and grown for it's fragrance by the first men (Dunedain). They called it Sweet Leaf or Sweet Galenas. It wasn't until the Second Age that the plant made it to Middle Earth though. It was brought there by the Numenoreans and they called it Westman's Weed . Among the popular types of tobacco in Middle Earth there was Southern Star, Longbottom Leaf, Southlinch and the most popular of them all was Old Tobby which was named after Tobald Hornblower himself. The author of these Middle Earth tales (Hobbit, Lord of the Rings) was JRR Tolkien. Tolkien was an avid pipe smoker and thought of it as an art form as well as a hobby. He was known to have smoked several blends but the one he is most famously credited with smoking was Capstan Blue Navy. Later on he was introduced to Three Nuns tobacco by his good friend, colleegue, and fellow author CS Lewis. I am relatively new to smoking pipes as well. I'm almost 7 months in and I love it!!

Pipe cleaners are the tools to smoker can go without,  therefore this is valuable information. Hope it helps someone down the line.    Regular pipe cleaners: Daily use general purpose cleaning. Use them to swab out excess moisture or dampen them with alcohol and use them to break down tar build up and sanitize the pipe. Fluffy cleaners: Same as above, except the fluffy cleaners can swab out more moisture per cleaner or deliver more alcohol if necessary. Also, the slightly wider diameter is useful for swabbing out large bore airways. Bristle cleaners: Used as a mild abrasive to break down solid tar deposits and scrub off bits of tobacco that may have adhered to the walls. Tapered cleaners: Available in the varieties above, but they are slimmer on one end than a regular cleaner and about as wide on the other as a fluffy cleaner. Best used when heavy deposits, narrow slots, etc. prevent easy access with a regular cleaner. Insert the small end and scrub until the channel opens up enough to get a non-tapered cleaner in."

PipeTobacco,3cargn,BWeice,3,Tue Jul 7 02:11:40 2015 UTC,"Tobacco cuts  Plug tobacco is made by pressing full leaves of tobacco usually resulting in slabs 3/4 cm thick. This was done mainly so transporting was easier while also creating and enhancing certain flavor characteristics. Plug's introduced cut plug, navy cut, and flakes tobacconists usually had a special cutting device to make even slices about 1-1.5 mm thick.  Crumble cut sometimes referred to as crumble cakes is made by stacking flakes and cutting them crossways they then are repressed and sliced again making it crumble with little effort.  Twist/Bogie/Rope/Pigtail cut's was originally used as chewing tobacco for sailors back in the days where wooden boats were most common and could be a fire hazard. The process to making this is similar to that of a cigar where full leaves (usually a variety) of tobacco is plaited covered with a wrapper leaf and then spun tightly. This form of ""cut"" was preferred because it could easily be chewed, smoked or coarsely ground up for snuff. This method usually creates extremely strong yet sweet flavors.  Curly/spun/coin cut is usually when the twist is prepared in the shape of a roll about 1-3 cm thick, left to mature, and then thinly sliced giving you that coin shape.  Meanwhile as these cuts are prepared scraps are sure to be left behind these scraps or ""loose cut"" is put into a special drum where it is cased with natural additives to then be matured and shredded into strands.  Ribbon cut is formed by cutting long, even, thin strips lengthwise. This was the standard cut for cigarettes and cigarillos depending on the width of the ribbon. This is currently the most commonly used cut of tobacco. this cut varies in size the smallest being .5 mm which is ultra fine shag.   Shag cut had a bad reputation back in the day and was thought to be the really strong and worst kind of leaf used because of its strong odorous qualities."
PipeTobacco,3cargn,Turbostar66,3,Mon Jul 6 13:39:43 2015 UTC,"Different types of tobacco leaf have different sugar and nicotine content. (the below was borrowed from the interwebs)  The amount of nicotine vs. sugars is usually an INVERSE relationship. Tobaccos high in sugar are usually low in nicotine and tobaccos high in nicotine are low in (natural) sugars.  Highest nicotine, lowest sugars by TOBACCO type -   Burly Kentucky Green River Kentucky Perique   Highest nicotine, lowest sugars by CURING type -   Fire-Cured (with one exception - see below) Air-cured Air-cured, Pressed / Fermented (That's not an official term, but I made it up to describe how Perique is processed.)   Highest sugar, lowest nicotine by TOBACCO type -   Virginia Maryland Turkish / Oriental   Highest sugar, lowest nicotine by CURING type -   Flue-cured   Flue-curing tobaccos involves heating up the barn while the leaves are hung upside down. The heat is gradually raised using ""Flues"" which are like big tubes that create an oven-like effect, but the heat is kept under 200 degrees. It takes 3 - 5 days. Most tobacco is flue-cured. The speediness of flue curing makes it economically attractive. It also help hold the sugars in the tobacco by quickly killing the leaf.  Fire-curing smokes the tobacco, just like smoke-curing meat. Fires are lit on the floor of the barn and the smoke rises to the hanging tobacco.  Air-curing is when the tobacco is left to dry out naturally without adding heat or smoke. It takes 4 - 6 weeks.  Sun-curing is like air-curing, but as it's names implies, the tobacco is left out in the sun. Sun-cured tobaccos are usually used for cigars and not often found in pipe blends.  Here's an interesting rule and an exception to the rule -  Fire-cured tobaccos like ""Dark-Fired Kentucky"" and ""Green River Kentucky"" have some of the highest nicotine and little to no sugars at all.  However, the quite popular Latakia tobacco is fire-cured, but contains low nicotine and high sugars. This is because Latakia is made from Oriental tobaccos which have high sugar and low nicotine to begin with."

PipeTobacco,3cargn,BeggingforQuestions,2,Mon Jul 6 18:00:31 2015 UTC,"Pipe tobacco, also known as zwergenuck in the language I made up, is a relatively new substance that was introduced one day as a scented potpourri-like substance that was intended to mask the odors of men who reeked of oil and lumber at the end of the day. They would store it in tins and wear them as necklaces so it could always be on hand to rub under there armpits. Many of them were flavored to smell like vanilla, cherry, or campfires. They soon gained popularity after the Boston T-party (the t stands for tobacco) where angry protesters dumped cartons of imported cigarettes into the Boston harbor in protest of the tax. This forced many to find an alternative for their nicotine fix; leading to the smoking of their aromatic potpourri tobaccos of of spoon-straws that many of the colonials got for free from Kellogg's brand cereal. Soon, more advanced designs came forth and instead of what was then called ""spooning"", the pipe and the hobby pipe smoking was born. It was a golden age after that, new shapes where made like the ""apple"" shape; named after Johnny Appleseed who became a legend after he traveled the country growing briar roots for all to smoke with!

[Alternative Step 2: NO microwave?  heat water in a kettle and pour into bottom of the steamer, and proceed.   remove from microwave place middle section above hot steaming water and re-cover and let sit.  i generally give it 30 to 45 seconds covered, longer does not hurt. give the tobacco the pinch test ( if the tobacco crumbles when pinched it is too dry; if you pinch it and it just stays pinched it is too wet; if you pinch and the tobacco springs back to shape it should be just right).   Unless your tap water reeks of chlorine or sulfur gas (some well waters) you need no special water, and no chance of introducing foreign substances like bacteria or mold.  No threat with the paper filters either and they are cheap.  You may have to play with your particular microwave, since they come in all sorts of power ratings to know how long to heat the water, but you will soon figure that out.    Unless you are messy and spill some of the loose tobacco clean up consists of dumping the hot water and drying the set up.  I used to use my wife's but she raised a stink claiming she didn't want her veggies to taste of tobacco, even though I had done this for years without ever having that problem arise... just one day she  saw me using ""her steamer"". :-)"

This does, of course, suck.  However, because of the current communities (filled with the very same people that make your pipes cost more) there are new tobacco blends being produced. There are new, artisan pipe makers sprouting up all the time, making new and interesting designs. There are large public events where pipe smokers can meet one another and talk shop.

PipeTobacco,3cdg45,Mordenkrad,3,Tue Jul 7 02:33:30 2015 UTC,"It's a matter of what pipes you're looking at. Old Kaywoodies were expensive pipes, once upon a time. Savinelli, Stanwell, and Dunhill have always made some high end factory pipes. Perhaps with the pipe world shifting more to specialized hobbyists rather than daily, casual smokers like our fathers and grandfathers has affected the selection.  Once upon a time, the average pipe smoker owned a few pipes and smoked the hell out of them. A pipe was seen as a tool, a thing that burned tobacco and nothing more. Most pipe smokers now, or at least the ones who feel compelled to talk about them on forums, see pipes as something more precious. Our pipes are collectors items and even jewelry, in a way. If you're looking for the basics, you can still find Grabows for well under $40.   Lastly, it has nothing to do with hipsters. Being in the industry, most pipe shop owners bemoan the loss of a lot of the older smokers who didn't balk at spending $2-300 on a pipe. The younger (perhaps hit, perhaps not)  component of our hobby (which makes up a big portion of our reddit community, by the by) is mostly made up of college age guys who are delighted to find a good pipe for $50 new. What's changed over time is standards. The average pipe buyer now wants a much better pipe than the average pipe smoker of previous decades. Basket pipes aren't as common at high end tobacco shops and drug stores rarely stock cheap pipes anymore.   Tl;DR: The pipe world, on average, just prefers a nicer pipe. Cheap pipes are still available. Look harder."
PipeTobacco,3cdg45,hedonaut,2,Tue Jul 7 14:34:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not an old man by any stretch of the imagination. My college roommate and I decided to try pipe smoking our sophomore year in college (late 1990s). I still do, he does not. A lot has changed since then, nearly all for the better.   The internet has given us access to such a tremendous selection of pipes and tobacco that just didn't exist to guys without access to a decent B&M. Even a good shop might stock Dunhill tins, and if you're really luck maybe a few McClelland blends. Now I have access to the entirety of McClelland's line-up, in addition, to every blend put out by C&D, GLP, and and so many more, including almost all the big European brands, on a single website - and they don't even charge me shipping provided I spend enough money. What premium would expect to pay for access to so much? 110% of what the B&M's charge? 150%? 200% - how about 75% of what the same tin would sell for at my shop. But that's still a few dollars more than I want to spend right now? Not to worry! There are half a dozen competing sites with the same selection, at least one of them has to be running a sale.   Sure, demand has gotten silly, first (in my recollection) was Dunhill, then Gawith, now Estoerica. Setting aside the need to hoard the unobtainable, prices are pretty close to where the used to be, all things considered. I don't remember ever paying less than $6 for a tin of tobacco, now I pay between $8-12 depending on the brand and blend. In 15 years, that kind of inflation really isn't bad. For comparison's sake, base price for a 1998 Civic was $9,980. The 2016s will start at $18,680.  Pipes seem to be about the same. If anything I think the market for high-end factory pipes (Dunhill and Castello specifically come to mind) seems to have come down, as people start chasing the stuff put out by individual carvers."
PipeTobacco,3cdg45,DaveInPhilly,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:17:38 2015 UTC,"I think that it is the hipsters, I started smoking after graduating college in the early 90's and prices were stable at least until 2002 when I stopped buying pipes. I had a good rotation but would buy pipes when I'd visit a new city or travel to Europe after I had about 40 or so pipes I stopped buying them because I didn't have enough racks/space so I just bought tobacco and never paid attention to pipe prices.  For the decade of the 90's and in the early 00's I remember you could get a Peterson Standard System for $70 with the equivalent Savinellis about the same price. High end pipes from Ascorti, Rinaldo, Radice were maybe $200 to $225.  Those prices were solid from 1992 to 2002, now they've pretty much doubled, totally outpacing inflation. I don't get it though online now there are a multitude of pipe shops. Back in the day you had Iwan Ries for pipes and JR for tobacco. There seems to be about the same brick and mortar places where I've lived and travelled. I know there were tons of cigar shops in the boom but 90% didn't have pipes or tobaccos.  There must be collusion among the distributors and major online retailers to gouge these rube hipsters. That is the only thing I can think of to explain the crazy jump in prices."

PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,BrackGin,3,Mon Jul 6 00:31:46 2015 UTC,"I would throw in for sure. What a haul! I may have not been smoking for long but I love it, and aspire to reach that sort of a collection someday! If I could get my hands on some Dunhill tins he had for a discounted retail price that'd be amazing. I wonder if he had any Frog Morton's too. I'd be interested in that as well OP, that is if you were to purchase the lot."
PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,Dunder_Mifflint,3,Mon Jul 6 04:56:45 2015 UTC,I would love to throw in on this as well.
PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,kindapoortheologian,2,Tue Jul 7 01:13:41 2015 UTC,It might slip our hands it seems.
PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,BrackGin,2,Tue Jul 7 01:16:58 2015 UTC,I made them aware of this. I'll let you know if it's something they'd be interested in.
PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,BrackGin,3,Mon Jul 6 00:36:33 2015 UTC,Very much appreciated.
PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,hedonaut,3,Mon Jul 6 00:41:22 2015 UTC,"Indeed. If we get a list, a few of us can pitch in with you as a buying agent, which means we all get cool stuff."
PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,SupraMario,2,Mon Jul 6 00:45:57 2015 UTC,"I'm down for this, I'd buy 3-5 or more sealed tins."
PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,Cycleoflife,5,Mon Jul 6 06:52:54 2015 UTC,"That, son, is a fine collection of tobaccos. And all those jars are full and seem to be well cared for! It is so hard to put a price on it. It is obviously worth what the highest bidder is willing to pay which is probably not much on Craigslist. I'm guessing some of those tins have some age on them and could fetch a nice dime either here or on eBay, or whatever. She probably just wants it gone and to have it go to a good home. I would contact her and say you are very interested but that you need to inspect the lot for its condition. Check that none of it is dry, look at some dates on the tins, etc. Be very nice and ask what she would be happy with selling it for. I would bring at least $200 to $500 cash, though, as it is probably worth that or more."
PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,blenheim45,8,Sun Jul 5 23:13:06 2015 UTC,"Nice collection of tobacco.. now the big question is, ""where are the pipes?""  As to not wanting to ""insult them"" with a low ball offer, I am not sure what that means.  I would consider a offering 1/3 to 1/2 of the retail value on the unopened tins, but no more.  Consider that if you in fact have to break this down and sell some of it your time and effort is worth something.  Opened tins are difficult to sell unless they are truly scarce, although you can usually trade them for other opened tins.  YMMV  tobacco that is too dry is less of a problem than people make it out to be, there are simple and very cheap ways to deal with this problem.  Mold however is a real problem, as if there is mold anywhere in a jar or a tin it is a threat to any tobacco anywhere in the vicinity and garbage time.  [please don't confuse mold with ""bloom"", bloom is desirable and has a crystalline nature, mold is funky hairy stuff.]  depending upon others who have called, what you think is a low offer, may seem generous.  Always try to get the seller to name a starting price for the item.  It doesn't hurt to tell her, ""look i want some of this for myself, but you want to sell it as a lot, and i understand.  So tell me what you need to get and i can figure out if  it is worth my while to take the time and effort to find others to take what I don't want, to get what I do want.""  [then wait for an answer]  P.S. someone who labeled his jars as neatly as these are is unlikely to have allowed for a real dehydration problem to exist. imho"
PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,DenverTele,2,Mon Jul 6 03:18:39 2015 UTC,[then wait for an answer]   You are clearly somebody who understands how negotiations work.  :-)
PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,blenheim45,2,Tue Jul 7 13:14:14 2015 UTC,"A ""close"" is when you ask for a decision, in sales  you have probably just asked a question like ""do you want the deluxe model or the uber-deluxe model?""   Now you have ""closed"" and you must ""stay closed"".  first person to speak loses. LOL"
PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,BrackGin,4,Wed Jul 8 01:47:28 2015 UTC,So I did the nice thing to try help them out. I messaged the 'Viking Club Pipes of St. Louis' to make them aware of the listing. I also informed them to call the local brick and mortar shops in the area.
PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,BWeice,5,Mon Jul 6 00:30:29 2015 UTC,That's very kind of you. Way to go. For the rest of us we mourn this great pipe legend. Whoever he was.

PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,BWeice,2,Sun Jul 5 22:55:06 2015 UTC,She's asking for an offer (no price listed) which is why I'm asking for help here.
PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,Alligator_Gar,4,Sun Jul 5 22:56:22 2015 UTC,well lets just say a 1.76oz tin is an average of $9   those big mason jars of SG FVF since I don't know the weight is about $75/lb   SG Best Brown Flake $70/lb  the big GL Pease 8oz cans are about $30 each   Sam Gawith tins 1.76oz let's say those are $10 a piece   Kendal Kentucky is around $40/lb   Dark bird's eye $45/lb   Gawith Rum Flake $45/lb  All those pouches I have no idea..
PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,BrackGin,3,Sun Jul 5 23:15:25 2015 UTC,"What /u/Cycleoflife said. Make sure there is no mold, you can however rehydrate the tobacco if it's dry, Results may vary (I've never done it)."

PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,SmokinLogan,2,Wed Jul 8 02:43:59 2015 UTC,Appears as though there is no way I'll be able to afford the lot. Do any of you see anything that is out of production that I may want to snag?
PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,DenverTele,3,Sun Jul 5 23:17:21 2015 UTC,"I would pick up the FVF, and some of those Cornell & Diehl tins, they look to have some age but I can't tell from the pictures also I don't know what you prefer but I hear age does wonders to them."

PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,BrackGin,2,Mon Jul 6 15:23:35 2015 UTC,I suspect the owner might want to keep the pipes. They don't perish and are great aesthetically.

PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,Alligator_Gar,3,Tue Jul 7 13:06:22 2015 UTC,I think that might make it work. There's 4 others who want 3 or 4 tins. That's amount 350 between all of us plus what the wants to add. If he can't afford it I will understand.
PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,BrackGin,2,Tue Jul 7 14:25:10 2015 UTC,"Well, if we can do it, neat, if not, no big loss. Just keep us posted, I'll have to make room in the budget if I'm going to go forward with it."

PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,SmokinLogan,2,Tue Jul 7 08:51:18 2015 UTC,There's a comment about the current offers. They aren't as low as you would think.

I'm honestly doing this to help out this community, and this young lady who lost her father. I need to know how much you're willing to send me so I can give her the total offer. Please give me your offer that does NOT include shipping costs. I have a feeling that if I don't handle this right, I'm going to eat a TON of shipping costs. If we land this, I'll box up what you want and give you the different shipping costs. That being said, it may be difficult to ""call dibs"" on stuff, as some of the other people may want as well.

PipeTobacco,3c8nkj,SmokinLogan,2,Tue Jul 7 16:57:00 2015 UTC,"Price everything accordingly, make a selection that covers each persons interests (even if it surpasses their budget), be fair and cover all the basis divining equally according to their contribution (no distinction over a higher amount).   It's only 8 of use up to now, so the big boys might have to deal with the smaller batches to pick some favorites and negotiate the others. Pleasing everyone is the goal. I've already made a selection of what I'd like to get, I don't expect to be able to get them all and that i the whole point, find something you are OK with.

PipeTobacco,3c8qgw,dumitrudobre,6,Sun Jul 5 23:20:56 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend Esoterica Margate.  I know, it's hard to find bc its Esoterica, but it's not as ""unicorn-blend"" as Penzance or Stonehaven.  It doesn't have the brown cavendish, but like /u/hedonaut recommended with star of the east, the VAs are on the sweet side.  Also, the orientals are on a similar plane as 965 in that they don't overdo it on the spice.  If you like English/Aro hybrids, Pembroke is Margate topped with French cognac.  The key with Pemnroke is that it needs enough dry time.  Both are really nice Englishes.  Keep an eye on pipesandcigars b/c a few times a year they offer 965 in bulk for 19.99 a pound (or maybe it's once a year?)"
PipeTobacco,3c8qgw,PipeBeard,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:58:59 2015 UTC,Margate is wonderful. Highly looked past dues to Stonehaven and Penzance.

There's no cavendish, but the virginia is all stoved, so there should be enough sweetness in there to capture your attention. I also highly recommend Squadron Leader as another medium bodied English that has plenty of flavor. It's nowhere near as powerful as Star, but it's a really well mannered and complex smoke."

The story goes that it was blended to match the old 965 because the lead blender felt their was something missing in the new blend.

Beyond that, I also enjoy tasting the unlit bowl for a few puffs, and some more than others, usually not as long as 10 minutes.  I wouldn't say it's unusual, especially if it helps to prime your pallette.  Either way, a pipe should be all about what helps you to relax.  It's all part of the experience as a whole."

PipeTobacco,3c96e5,OccasionalPenguin,2,Mon Jul 6 18:37:52 2015 UTC,"Personally, I drink triple IPA's (beer) every other week and enjoy them. For those who don't know IPA's are extremely hopy (hoppy?, hoopy?) and harsh on the tongue, which is why the ""soapy"" taste of this blend is not bad when paired with the right drink. Some rum or a nice crafted beer accentuates the tastes well for me. I smoke it on on a medium bowl because bigger puffs really concentrate the soft tobacco and slight additive flavors that are missed in small consecutive puffs."

PipeTobacco,3c9462,cgvet9702,2,Mon Jul 6 02:04:40 2015 UTC,That's great to know. I didn't know lane had a cherry blend. I usually don't get any lane tobacco due to the fact I'm not a huge fan of it.
PipeTobacco,3c9462,cgvet9702,3,Mon Jul 6 02:36:27 2015 UTC,"So many shops carry their blends and also rename them in many cases, it's about impossible to say if you are smoking them or not. Lane, mcClelland, Cornell and Diehl, and Altadis are going to be what you're smoking in any shop that carries bulks. Even in a shop that truly blends their own, they'll be getting their blending components from one if them."
PipeTobacco,3c9462,cgvet9702,2,Mon Jul 6 02:43:11 2015 UTC,That's really good to know. Honestly I usually just order tobacco since for the longest time there wasn't a local shop.

I have made the mistake of pairing the wrong pipe with the wrong blend for years before. If pipe collecting has taught me anything, break in the pipe slowly with a variety of tobaccos. One bowl of Latakia will not ghost it forever, but you may, in the mean time, discover that bowl just sings with a bright Virginia, or pulls the most delicate nutty noted out of a burley blend. Treat every new pipe as an opportunity to reacquaint yourself with blends you know and love and let the pipe and your palate dictate the dedication. I have a Savinelli Sabbiata 673 I recently dedicated to straight Virginia flakes. I've been smoking that pipe for three years, but always with heavier Va/Pers and stuff like university flake. I wish I knew then what I know now. That little Rhodie burns Brown Flake like nothing else. If you just choose a blend and a pipe and pair them off the shelf, you never give yourself the opportunity to explore the options at all, and thus, it may not be an optimal pairing."

I'm like /u/Cycleoflife in that I don't find FM to be spicy, so much as I do smoky.  The key to that is the latakia, which is smoked over hardwood fires as part of the prep, so it's like wearing a hoody next to a camp fire for a while.  VA tend to be my favorites.  I'd say to check out Capstan Blue.  It's the most accessible VA out there in terms of being easy to pack, keep lit, and smoke, and has a lot of nice VA sweetness and ""hay tones."" Not too mild and not too strong.  There are high quality aros as well, that should not taste like chemicals.  Macbaren Vanilla cream flake is nice.  As is Gawith Celtic Talisman.  I just popped a tin of Tsuge Summer, and that is fairly nice as well.  Another one I'd recommend would be Deep Hollow, which is the aromatic counterpart  to Frog Morton (same JRRT inspired line by McClelland).

The person that gave then to me is a cigar smoker who occasionally smoked a pipe, so I have no idea how long they have been in bags (one is dated, 2009).  Would these be worth keeping? Or are they pretty much goners? All feel very very dry. And most are aromatics or have at least some sort of topping or casing, the least of which would be some PS LNF or Haddo's Delight."
PipeTobacco,3c3whp,PipeBeard,3,Sat Jul 4 18:07:38 2015 UTC,"Pinch a few ribbons together. If they crumble to dust, it's toast.  You can (almost) always rehydrate dry tobacco, but you can't sufficiently dry soggy tobacco, so if you give rehydrating a whirl, go easy.  I use a clean spray bottle (meaning go buy a new one) and distilled water (which you can get from the baby food aisle.  One or two small spritzes over some tobacco laid out on paper towels should do.  I tumble it around in a big bowl afterwards to evenly coat the moisture and then jar it up.  Remember, it shouldn't feel moist.  Pinch a few together, and if they stick to each other, it's plenty moist.  Honestly, if it doesn't turn to dust now, smoke some and see if it's ok.  Usually pipe tobacco needs to be dryer than you'd think.  If it's ok, toss it in a mason jar. Haddo's is strong, but is really wonderful stuff."
PipeTobacco,3c3whp,JorN_T,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:44:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'm used to getting my C&D bulk quiet dry, but this is of course beyond that.  I wasn't too sure if the presence of toppings or casings would change the prospect of rehydrating, whether what made the blend what it is would be lost already.  The larger pieces in the Haddo's were immediately snapping, rather than bending.  It's humid enough here most days that maybe I could just leave it outside when I do yard work."
PipeTobacco,3c3whp,PipeBeard,2,Sat Jul 4 19:57:51 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. I think they'd be worth a shot, at least te Haddo's.  It may be ok as is, but the rehydration shouldn't ruin it. It would be mostly water that has evaporated, I'd assume, so adding a little back should be fine."
PipeTobacco,3c3whp,blenheim45,2,Sat Jul 4 20:24:30 2015 UTC,"Straight tobaccos tend to work out better than aros, but there is only one way to find out.  And as long as there is no problem such as mold, even the non-nondescript ones (after rehydrating) are suitable for your own ""mystery blend "" jar.  Most long time smokers develop one of these in which they dump tobaccos that are left over scraps and ends of tobaccos that don't measure up.  [If you smoke aros and straight tobaccos, you may want separate jars for each.]  I use a Tupperware steamer . place your tobacco on a paper coffee filter and place it over  either water heated in the microwave or hot water from the kettle and cover.  generally 30 seconds to 45 is sufficient for the driest tobacco to make it smoke-able.  [NOTE;  Do NOT put the tobacco in the microwave, cooking it changes the taste.  You are only using the steam off the heated water.]    Now admittedly I like my tobacco drier than some, and I figure if it does not crumble to dust when I pinch it, it is not too dry.

If a resolution cannot be found, it is possible that reddit will become obsolete for all intents and purposes, and people will not participate as much (Digg, Myspace). While this sub will undoubtedly continue, the key contributors might migrate elsewhere and the quality would then suffer."

PipeTobacco,3c3whp,hedonaut,3,Sat Jul 4 23:34:47 2015 UTC,"If reddit, as a whole, looked threatened, we should just make our own thing for just this sub and it's relatives. It wouldn't be hard to put together. It's such a niche crowd, and it's not always subject t the instability of other content. Relative to the rest of reddit, it would be a very low traffic site. I'd offer to host and organize myself if that was ever needed."

PipeTobacco,3c3whp,PhysicsNovice,2,Sun Jul 5 02:32:00 2015 UTC,One of the things that makes this forum unique is that it is embedded within the larger framework of reddit meaning increased traffic and awareness that helps grow our hobby and makes information easy to find for new and inexperienced pipers. I'm a piper today because of this sub and I found it through reddit before I smoked my first bowl.
PipeTobacco,3c3whp,hedonaut,3,Sun Jul 5 22:55:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'm grateful for having had good guidance in the form of my local pipeclub as well, but I also attribute much of my success and progress in this hobby to reddit. It's no secret I found my job on here. Now, as a more experienced smoker, I find one of the best part of the hobby is helping out newer folks. It's also good that it's not only new folks. There are a lot of guys on here who know way more than me I can continue to learn from as well."
PipeTobacco,3c3whp,blenheim45,2,Sun Jul 5 23:27:25 2015 UTC,"ah so, is that a lifeboat I see?  Now the problem is how one manages to get the word out to 15,000+ members in the case of need?  who owns the contents of the site and is there a contact list?  Could a site be set to mirror this site... without violating something or another?  The problem I see is how to designate where the lifeboat is, in casse it is needed.  Even if we could post such an address right this minute, there are members who would not get the message and some who even if they got it would misplace it, etc.    And for that matter if the members could accept a format change I can think of a number of sites that would welcome the membership with open arms (e.g. PipeChat).  Of course that format change is better in some ways, but not as cell phone friendly, which is probably important to a lot of users."

Life boats are generally a matter of last resort, when there is not seen to be a viable alternative.    what I fear is that if it does happen, and the plug is pulled, even if it isn't permanent, but involves a matter of weeks where the site goes dark, the community will end up broken up."
PipeTobacco,3c3whp,hedonaut,2,Sun Jul 5 04:59:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It's the group here and the way we interact I want to preserve. I see a lot of talking, but less back and forth discussion other places. I want to see that continue above all."

PipeTobacco,3c3whp,PipeBeard,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:28:00 2015 UTC,"This sub seems to be split on it.  I've gotten some, and won't reorder (gave the rest away already, or Id offer it up).  It's very medicinal to me.  Think luden's cough drops.  It will ghost the bejesus out of a pipe, too. Some people seem to love it, though.  Supposedly it's a mix of two bulk blends (possibly lane, but I can't remember exactly what).  My go to cherry is Gawith Celtic Talisman, which uses high quality tobacco and a nice floral cherry topping."
PipeTobacco,3c3whp,levins0,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:37:11 2015 UTC,"Most blends are as good as (the people who like them) say they are. By that, I mean some people may like a blend a lot, and others hate it. Look at the current community review for firedance flake to see that play out.   If you like aromatics, and if you like cherry aros, you will probably like Hobbits Weed. I got some recently in trade. The cherry flavor isn't too cough drop or candy like, but it's definitely sweeter than the cherry cordial (chocolate with cherry liqueur) blends that I've tried.   It was decent tobacco with a solid cherry flavor that lasted through the bowl. It was one of the better cherry blends I've tried. It reminded me of a gentler version of McClelland three cherry bulk. I liked it better than the McClelland."

PipeTobacco,3c3whp,GWFKegel,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:59:02 2015 UTC,"Expired Tobacco?  I've done some blog reading. I know it's not certain how long tobacco lasts, and that virginias and similar tobaccos tend to age the best. I also know that mold is bad and ruins tobacco. However, I have no idea how to tell if my tobacco is still good. I'm most concerned about something that would be more harmful to smoke than normal tobacco.  The tobacco was stored in a thin ziplock bag, and then those bags were placed into an air-tight plastic jar. Here are photos. If you could help me determine which you think are smokable (in your opinion, you're not liable)? Would you still smoke the following?  One is a Dunhill 965, probably around 8 years old.  The other is Sweet Dutch Cavendish, a local tobacconists' take on a dark Cavendish. It's probably about 4 years old."
PipeTobacco,3c3whp,Cycleoflife,3,Sat Jul 4 23:19:17 2015 UTC,"They look fine to me. As long as there is no mold you are good to go. See /u/PipeBeard's comment elsewhere in this thread about proper hydration of tobacco. People age their tobaccos on purpose all the time. The smoky character has probably dissipated somewhat from the 965 but the Virginia has likely improved. Should be a nice mellow smoke. Cavendish is kind of pre-fermented in my understanding. If it was an aromatic, it may have lost some of its top note, but should smoke fine as well."
PipeTobacco,3c3whp,blenheim45,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:33:28 2015 UTC,"""what he said""... and the aros may have bled over to the other tobaccos.  In the future you would be better not to allow the aros and the ""straight"" tobaccos to be stored within the same ""jar"" .  imho"

PipeTobacco,3c3whp,PipeBeard,2,Mon Jul 6 01:56:13 2015 UTC,"Cavendish is a way of processing tobacco (usually Virginia or burley) by which the tobacco is pressed and heated (by various means) and allowed to ferment, which brings out the sweetness.  After that, flavor can be added to make it an aromatic.  Not all cavendish is aromatic, per se.  For instance, brown cavendish is added to Dunhill 965.  It does bring some sweetness to the party, but I don't think it's topped with any flavoring, and 965 is not an aromatic."
PipeTobacco,3c3whp,PipeBeard,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:08:30 2015 UTC,"Also, not all aromatics contain cavendish.  An example would be Firedance Flake, which is a flavored Virginia flake.

If you are the man of integrity you say you are you will not find the answer here. You are the only person who can tell you what is right or wrong. People can give you their opinions and undoubtedly there will be strong ones, but at the end of the day only you can decide if you can sleep at night with the choices you made that day.   If I only smoked a bowl or two a week I'd have very little guilt about going 30 days before any blood testing they gave me to get a lower rate. Insurance companies fuck with people all the time.

PipeTobacco,3c2etc,blenheim45,9,Sat Jul 4 16:24:20 2015 UTC,"I am in the insurance industry and to mis-state the facts on an application for a life insurance policy would be seen as fraud and in the event of a a claim the claim would be denied.  The very best outcome would be payment of an amount that represented what the collected premium would have bought had the truthful answers been given.  following that is the possible return of the premium paid at this time, not exactly what you want in that situation.  Different companies have different ratings and views of levels of smoking, which they typically determine both through the verbal & written questions and through blood and/or tissue samples.  Another approach to stretch your budget is to consider the use of term insurance, at least to cover those needs that have some sort of time limit.  Such needs are covering a mortgage or other debts which will over time be paid off and need no coverage at a future date.  Also the allowance for covering educational expenses for a child of 4  should have been covered 20 years from now, so they too have time limit for the need.  Most companies will offer a guaranteed renewable policy, which means that at the end of the original term [5, 10, 20 years] you can renew, regardless of changes in your health at a predetermined premium rate.   Generally at that time you can choose a reduced amount of coverage, but not a greater amount.  So If you have taken a ten year term policy and you have paid off 50% of your mortgage then you could reduce your total coverage if you so choose.  Ideally you should be taking the difference between the whole life premium and the term premium, investing it, thereby increasing your ""worth"" and lowering your need for ""insurance"" in your later years.    When pricing out term policies make sure to check the renewal rate for the subsequent terms, as some companies make the jumps on subsequent terms so high as to make it very unlikely that the client will want to renew.  Their idea is to make it unreasonably expensive the nearer they come to likely ""pay out time"".  That each subsequent term will be more expensive is a given with any term policy, as they are making up for the ""savings"" that occurred in the original low priced and lower risk period, but there is a difference in how different companies handle this.  [ all comments are made re insurance law in Canada, but in principle are generally correct in other North American jurisdictions.]"

The rates are higher than non smokers but no where near the premium charged for full timers. Someone mentioned reducing your smoking in the time before your swab tests and I do agree. That's just being cautious. Do not lie on your application though. You don't want to jeopardize your benefit payout. Life Insurance is the one thing guaranteed to be used because all our lives end.  Also to make sure you save money, only buy a term life policy. I can give you tons of reasons why, but it pays the least commission to agents for one. Its the basis of every other policy anyway, all other types are cash vehicles tacked on to increase the cost and are less beneficial to clients.

This is what I've read around the web throughout various years and I have neither the sources handy nor the interest to go digging them up, but I would advise you not to take the 1964 information as fact.

I would suggest anonymously calling the insurance company from a phone number that your insurance company cannot identify with you and asking them what they consider the real cutoff to be...

PipeTobacco,3bye24,blenheim45,16,Fri Jul 3 04:26:18 2015 UTC,"Just so people understand, the first sub to go private in this mess was iama, and the reason the mods did it was because the person who was fired, Victoria, was the one who managed the ama system. She was the head of pr and was the liaison between the talent doing the ama and the community.   She ran the scheduling, explained the process to the talent, managed the ama while it was running, and even often typed the answers while the talent dictated in person or over the phone.   She basically singlehandedly ran the ama operation. When she was gone, the iama sub mods felt they could not effectively run the sub without her. It was sudden, and so nobody had the time or information to properly take over her responsibilities.   They locked the sub because they needed time to organize so that the ama process didn't fall apart for what they had scheduled immediately following her departure. The did not lock it out of spite or protest.   Others followed, and it has become a protest, but it didn't start that way."
PipeTobacco,3bye24,levins0,2,Fri Jul 3 11:47:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly, why does everyone think that this is a personal attack on the reddit community? Someone who was on the reddit payroll was released. That happens every day at every company in the world. They have no obligation to give anyone outside of the HR department a reason. It will be hard for that sub to manage for a while but I'm sure they will figure it out."
PipeTobacco,3bye24,EmporerNorton,10,Fri Jul 3 14:33:47 2015 UTC,"They didn't respond just because of this isolated incident though. Since Pao took over, Reddit had been changing a lot about the type of community they're allowing to exist here. There was that whole fiasco where they were closing down subs that weren't ""politically correct"". I'm not saying that all those subs added true value to the site, as many of them were pretty offensive, but Reddit's best characteristic has been that it's a safe-haven of uncensored ideas and opinions. Pao, and I'm sure a board of some sort, is trying to turn it into cultivated content. With the recent AMA thing, Victoria was fired because the Jesse Jackson AMA resulted in Jesse Jackson being skewered by a highly suspicious and questioning community. When a public figure goes out and presents an opportunity they have to expect that sort of thing can happen. And so they fired Victoria because she couldn't control the ideas of everyone who saw the AMA, which is an absurd reason for being released.   The entire point is that those who own Reddit are trying to make it a site for the general public who will be truly insulted by the diversity here. They have the right, but it sucks. You can bet that if that happens, support for small subs will be out of the question."
PipeTobacco,3bye24,ahedderly,3,Fri Jul 3 17:29:53 2015 UTC,"Actually it seems like she was probably fired because she wouldn't let the admins monetize the AMAs the way they wanted to. Expect to see sponsored AMAs soon, and/or AMAs actually done by a third party like a celebrity's assistant or PR people. The fact is that Reddit has never been profitable, and the admins are under immense pressure from the investors to start making a profit. The way the admins see it, if their commercial efforts drive away the old hard-core userbase but they manage to keep a reasonable casual audience and make money off them, they're coming out ahead."
PipeTobacco,3bye24,daysleeping19,0,Sat Jul 4 00:12:19 2015 UTC,"Pao did not close ""politically-incorrect subs."" FatPeopleHate was banned, FatPeopleStories wasn't. One racist sub was banned, others weren't. The banned subs were those who user-bases were conducting organized harassment campaigns. Plenty of VERY politically-incorrect subs were left alone, precisely because their users kept their stuff inside their subs. Still, countless users portrayed it as a ban on subjects Pao didn't like, some of them (I think) being users of said banned subs who were angry that they were gone-- after FatPeopleHate was banned, users made FatPeopleHate2 (banned), then FatPeopleHate3 (banned), then FatPeopleHate4 (banned) and so on. The users of said subs weren't banned individually, so they were free to run around claiming that Pao was breaking free speech laws or just being a dick."
PipeTobacco,3bye24,ScottSierra,2,Mon Jul 6 16:14:34 2015 UTC,"That's a more complex issue than I initially thought, but news on this whole thing is so skewed and I didn't hear any of it 1st hand. Thank you for clarifying.  What exactly is meant by ""organized harassment campaigns""? I just wonder because if it's something that they were organizing to do IRL, wouldn't that then become an issue to be much more effectively addressed by local law enforcement such that the source of the issue could be stamped out and the sub could be left alone?  Again, I think Reddit is much better off without these subs, but I'm conflicted about when it's appropriate to enforce censorship of a group, no matter who. I understand that Reddit has the right to edit the site however they feel appropriate."
PipeTobacco,3bye24,ahedderly,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:24:38 2015 UTC,"They were, as I understand it, rallying together to go harass other Reddit users in groups.One of the banned subs was, in fact, created for the sole purpose of being against another gaming sub and its users.  Censorship on such a site as this should, in m y opinion, only happen when groups are being problems. There are other racist subs, for example, and maybe some of their users do spread their crap elsewhere, but they don't seem to be going, ""Hey, let's all go over to this other sub and fuck shit up!"""
PipeTobacco,3bye24,ScottSierra,2,Mon Jul 6 19:14:37 2015 UTC,"I think that it still seems to me a better solution to start banning individual members who participate in these activities. Also, isn't it relatively easy for the moderators of a sub to ban others from that specific sub? I guess I just don't see it as an issue that needed to be addressed by the highest level of administration."
PipeTobacco,3bye24,ahedderly,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:17:55 2015 UTC,"My thing is that, although I don't know exactly how they went about it, I'm guessing that decision was made for a reason. It'd be quite pointless for Pao to ban subs she ""doesn't like"" and just leave several others that are similar."

FatPeopleHate was banned and FatPeopleStories wasn't. The banned subs were those whose users were running organized campaigns against others.  Her bans weren't even slights on free speech. Websites can restrict whatever they like-- for example, Reddit could ban ALL subs the higher-ups think are racist-- and it wouldn't be against free speech. That protects us against the government banning certain topics; private forums of any kind can ban anything they like."

At this point it is not inconceivable that reddit will not remain a viable platform for much longer. If reddit, like digg of old, should fall, the /r/PipeTobacco community will go with it.  As a newbie, this sub has been an invaluable resource for me. I'm sure at least some of you had bought a pipe or three from /u/soymilkisgood .

PipeTobacco,3bye24,PhysicsNovice,2,Mon Jul 6 16:16:35 2015 UTC,"This too shall pass. I have been an admin on a forum for nearly 8 years and like hemorrhoids, there is an occasional flare up. I have to agree that there is nothing more frustrating than mods-not modding, causing a behind the scenes pissing contest. We had promoted someone to admin and entire threads were being deleted forever and others haphazardly merged together. We litetally had to shut the forum until a lot of hard work got things sorted out. The guy screwed up after years of good work and it caused the remaining admins to look hard at who had what privileges. Once the dust settled and all of the good ideas were implemented things just got better. Lots of pride and the feeling of protecting our own caused things to go private but only for a short while.   I think reddit has its place in the great scheme of social media, but there are other means of the same communications."

Many I knew and they and i continued contact on other sites... but some it was the single mode of connection.    I doubt I am the only one who did not know there was a backup site.  That's good news... but it would be a poor second to continuing the growth here unimpeded.. imho.  This site is unique in my experience, great growth rate, well moderated, and great atmosphere. [I actually prefer the physical set up and lay  out at places like PipeChat and Brothers of Briar, but for sheer numbers of new pipe smokers participation, this site seems to be second to none.]  We are fairly simple as sites on reddit go, not all that complex, and the brouhaha doesn't seem to affect us directly, but.. the confrontation between disgruntled mods and inept administration could go nuclear, and in that case what happens to the healthy bleed over we get from someone who comes to reddit for their daily dose of /r/jokes or one of the larger sites and stumbles on our happy band smoking away over in our corner?

The center of the ""bulb"" has a more random grain, or a lack thereof.  Pipes made from the middle or ""heart"" of the briar as I've always heard it called can often appear to lack grain pattern and will sometimes behave unpredictably, though not necessarily poorly.

PipeTobacco,3bwdr3,soymilkisgood,15,Thu Jul 2 18:21:29 2015 UTC,"Firedance Flake: an abbreviated review to kick things off. - My rating: 2 - somewhat recommend  Blend Name: Samuel Gawith Firedance Flake  Tin Description: ""None but the Piper...Keeps up with the Dancer""  Leaf: Virginia  Appearance: Medium moist-ish brown flake that is uniform in color. Needs substantial drying time before smoking.  Tin Aroma: Very overwhelming blackberry note. It is like sticking your nose in a bottle of a slightly vinegary grape concentrate. Stinks up everything it's around with its scent.  Taste: Good amount of berry and light vinegary, vanilla, and some light bread notes. But mainly it's the sickeningly sweet topping that gets to me, quickly overwhelming me with that artificial lollipop/cough syrup note that I just can't take after a while.  Strength and Nicotine: Decent strength because Best Brown Flake is the base tobacco for this flake. So unlike aromatics in that it is satisfying to smoke in the nicotine department.  Smokeability: Okay if you like aromatics and/or grape kool aid. Or maybe like to smoke outside. Or have a girlfriend/wife/ladyfriend who likes this sort of scent and won't let you smoke inside otherwise.  Room Note: Musty grape/berry cough syrup yuck yuck yuck it stuck around in the apartment for a week afterwards I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT  Thoughts: A fine aromatic if you want to try something with a fruity flavor and some backbone nicotine-wise to it. But you are warned that if you don't like the tin note, you're not going to like the taste or room note. And it will stay with you for a long time afterwards, haunting your dreams.  Recommend to: An aromatic smoker, someone who wants to please their guests with the room note, a smoker who wants an aromatic with backbone who might not usually smoke aromatics.  Summary: A fine tobacco that has been ruined with the topping, which I can't stand. Be sure to store it away from your other tobaccos, and don't smoke it indoors or in a favorite pipe if you don't like the tin note. You've been warned.  My Background: I’ve been smoking for about three years. Have all types of pipes in all different price ranges, and have tried a lot of tobaccos. My favorites are Vas, VaBurs, VaPers (lots of different flakes) and I also love pressed Englishes (flakes and cakes)."
PipeTobacco,3bwdr3,Cycleoflife,3,Thu Jul 2 18:30:20 2015 UTC,Well put. You summed it up perfectly.
PipeTobacco,3bwdr3,antiwittgenstein,11,Thu Jul 2 21:25:26 2015 UTC,"Review #44  Blend Name: Firedance Flake  Leaf: Standard Virgina Brown, maybe a touch darker, with a few white spots and streaks.  Tin Aroma: Raisins, blueberries, blackberry jam  Taste: Even at first light the tin aroma is present on the palate – berries, black and blue, slightly sweet, but no berry tartness, just a round fruity flavor. Muted Va Flake – citrus, black pepper, a bit of honest tobacco, nutty. It is good flake, but those flavors backup singers to the diva. Which is there, as far I have as I have noticed. Every. Single. Puff. I have never had an aromatic to be so persistent. I had a bowl of this that I smoked on for three days. When I readied to put flame to it the second day I said to myself ‘The berry will be gone, but the flake was good.’ But no, it was still there, without fading a smidge. On the third day I similarly thought ‘Surely the flavor has spent itself.’ Amazingly no. It is tenacious – and extremely consistent. What you get on first light stays on through till you hit ashville, no matter how many days you let the bowl rest.  Nicotine: On the mild side. I never seem to smoke at this for long, so it doesn’t build up enough to make me green.  Smokability: Class I asbestos. My last bowl I cubed cut, set it front of a fan, under a lamp, and then just out for over 2 full days. It was a bit easier to light, but it refused to keep lit for more than a 5-10 minutes at a time.  Room Note: Quite like the tin, blue and black berries.  Thoughts: This just ruined every other Aromatic that I thought was the least bit decent. The ones that I thought were tops, Molto Dolce, Barbados Plantation, Autumn Evening, Captain Black Royal, are small time compared to Firedance. They take patience and special smoking techniques to eek out the promised flavors. And the preparation. Dry for a minute too little and you are in soggy town. Dry a minute too long and the flavors evaporate before you get it in your pipe. Firedance is a bear to prepare, a beast to light, and chore to keep lit, but it is still on a completely different plane of existence compared to every other Aromatic I have tried. The crux of it is, Firedance Flake actually tastes like the tin and room note promise. And that is what I think all of us truly desire, above love, financial security, and a cure for the common cold.  Similar Tobaccos: Newminster Navy Flake? Comoy’s Navy Flake? Really nothing I have had really compares…  Summary: A VA flake with a pronounced, tenacious berry casing that has ruined all other aromatics for me.  Thanks to /u/pixeechick for giving me a sample in perfect time for community review!"
PipeTobacco,3bwdr3,pixeechick,3,Fri Jul 3 02:49:27 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you enjoyed it. I have to agree with just about everything you have said here, especially the part about it ruining every other aromatic you come across. I think this is one that I'll keep on hand, along with Celtic Talisman, for those times when I do feel like something a little bit aromatic."

PipeTobacco,3bwdr3,Cycleoflife,9,Sat Jul 4 02:00:23 2015 UTC,"Firedance Flake Review  Special shout out to /u/levins0 for making this possible by divying up an order. I'm extra happy not to have a whole tin of this leftover as it did not suit my fancy. So thank you.   Tin note: Blackberry Jam meets fruity pebbles. This is the strongest topping I have ever smelled. While there is nothing offensive about the smell itself, it is just way way too strong and it makes me want to puke.   Moisture: dripping wet, no surprise from a Gawith flake, but I feel like the topping made it even harder to dry out fully.   Smoke: my first go I tried the fold and stuff after letting it sit out a few hours and it did not smoke well at all. Second try, I fully rubbed it out (RIP my manliness as I smelled like a tweeniebopper the rest of the day) and let it sit out overnight. I still had moisture issues with it. Also, I tried it in a different pipe for round two but found no improvement.   Flavor: Meh. After the intense tin note, the last thing I wanted was more berries but that is what I got which only served to mask the nice brown flake beneath. I guess my issue is that the top dressing did not in any way seem integrated to the tobacco flavors. A good aro should blend the two seamlessly.   Nicotine: My two tries at this flake were too frustrating to assess the N and I certainly was not satisfied afterward.   Aftertaste: Light  Notes: Two tries were all I could muster, and I did it for all of you good folk out there, so I could participate in this month's review. I give it a 1/4. With all the trouble I had with it, I wouldn't even recommend it to an aro lover. But it could be the favorite of someone who just loooves berries and has ready access to a dehydrator."
PipeTobacco,3bwdr3,SupraMario,9,Thu Jul 2 21:24:21 2015 UTC,"Firedance Flake My Thoughts  First  Thanks to /u/Cycleoflife for sending this to me (I've got a plan to get you back lol), I was told I'm obligated to give a review...so first time for everything.  Tin Note  Umm...fruity? A lot more potent than I expected, like someone spilled some blackberry wine on the tobacco...I love Vas and Aros in general, but this stuff was even a bit strong for me...and that's coming from someone who likes Lane Limited 1Q.  Taste  Trying to get something out of this, was...pretty difficult, the tobacco was so damp it was like trying to keep a sponge that was just rung out, lit. Even leaving it out for a good night still caused me to have to relight it constantly. Unfortunately the minor taste of berries I did get out of this was masked with ash from my constant need to puff to keep it lit, which I still consider myself a huge novice of the pipe, so this potentially could have been my complete fault. :/ At least my wife loved the smell of it...  Nicotine  Honestly, after being a cigar smoker, very little bites me. This was your average amount from an Aro...not much.  Room Note  You know those damn candles your wife buys to make the house smell like someone just shat out a muffin bakery? Yeah...open it dust it around and put it out...quick.  Would I recommend this  Maybe, I know after I just got done bashing it...but this seems to be worth a damn (from all the reviews) if you can get it to smoke properly...if. I would only tell someone to try this after they had tried out other aros and were feeling the need for a dessert smoke.  My Thoughts  Ok, so it's tobacco? It's got that going for it...I have a feeling that they used it to soak up a few spills at the local winery...but come on...at least cut it, to tone it down a notch. I love aros, I really do, but this was a bit much, the remainder that is left, is going in a jar to age...for like 5-10...years...when I'm brave enough to open it again."
PipeTobacco,3bwdr3,Cycleoflife,4,Fri Jul 3 01:10:24 2015 UTC,"Hey, you made good! Thanks for the review!"
PipeTobacco,3bwdr3,SupraMario,2,Fri Jul 3 03:46:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it definitely wasn't what I expected though."
PipeTobacco,3bwdr3,AsIfThatWouldHappen,8,Fri Jul 3 12:50:58 2015 UTC,"Some great reviews here, and as everything has already been said I'll keep it brief.  Tin note on this bad boy is amazing, everyone nearby me whenever I opened the tin was amazed with it. Luckily a lot of it comes over in the tastw too.  Only drawback for me was the drying time, I once sat a flake on my bench for 48hrs and it was still wet.  I found 6-8 hours on a paper towel with an extremely bright lamp aimed at it from about 3"" away done the trick, and let me smoke a whole bowl folded and stuffed with about 3-4 relights.  A great tasting Aromatic with a good nic kick, a great tobacco flavor backbone, and an amazing aroma. It's only drawback is the fact it is the wettest substance known to man.  3/4"

PipeTobacco,3bwdr3,hedonaut,4,Thu Jul 2 18:28:03 2015 UTC,"There's a lot already written here, so I'll break this down into a few simple sections.  Tin Note: Sweettarts, Kool-aid, and purple candy of some sort. This takes like purple, pure and unadulterated.  Taste: Oh my god sweet... You guys know well by now I tend to go in for dry, even bitter stuff. I loaded up a huge meerschaum with a flake and a half rubbed out. There's a sour note in here too, reminds me of some sort of raspberry Sourpatch Kid. Half way down the bowl and this stuff is burning like a dream. Nicotine content is a nice, even medium, and the flavor has hardly changed, for better or worse. This stuff seems uniquely incapable of biting, which is neat. I keep getting little hints of some sort of tobacco undertone to the flavor, maybe? I'm not so sure as I smoke it. I keep looking for it. Winding towards the bottom, the flavor remains constant. There's a strange herbal note that pops up once in a while, but it's steady as she goes besides.   Smokeability Provided it's dried out well, this blend burns well. I took this all the way down a fairly large bowl with one relight. Nicotine is a nice, easy smoking mild-medium. There's enough there to enjoy, but it shouldn't be too much for anybody. The sour-piquant notes can wear after a while though.  Thoughts This is a really well done full-flavored aromatic. Most aromatics struggle to get into the medium range where this one is almost overwhelming. That, too, is this blend's greatest failing for me. Just a hint of bready, earthy Gawith Virginias and burleys would have balanced this blend out so nicely. A hint of cream and spice to bring this blend down out of the candy clouds into a rustic dessert kind of profile would have made this a go to aromatic smoke for me. It's so well put together, but just too strongly sweet and sour for me. I might have reacted better if I was expecting that, or perhaps smoking it at a different time of day. I may pick up a tin to play with occasionally or smoke out on the patio bars when I'm surrounded by non-smokers, but I doubt it. It's cloyingly sweet.   Summary This will give you cavities. 3 or 4 if you like the sweet stuff, 1 if you don't. It's well put together, great quality, but not to my tastes."
PipeTobacco,3bwdr3,Chuzordie,2,Fri Jul 3 15:21:21 2015 UTC,"It was tasty,  and while the wine /  brandy flavor was there it didnt overpower imho. My first ARO Flake,  so I have nothing to compare it to.  I only had a small sample that  was shared between me and the wife,  we both enjoyed it and I find it a solid 3.6 out of 4.  I will be ordering a tin or two of this to savor some more."
PipeTobacco,3bwdr3,Ciceronian,2,Fri Jul 3 15:03:46 2015 UTC,"I know it probably isn't kosher but I'm going to chime in with a quick thought rather than a full review, since I don't have anything that reviews here haven't already captured and I don't quite fully trust my own palate to offer accurate or fair reviews quite yet.  What I will say is that while Fire Dance is overall not my thing, I'm grateful to it because I think it taught me (finally) how to handle flakes--what to look for in terms of dryness and readiness, and how to maximize the flavors and look for the best pairing with pipes. I truly think that before this blend, I was smoking flakes just about the same way I smoke ribbon cuts with the single added step of rubbing them out half-assedly."

PipeTobacco,3bv72n,unigami,8,Thu Jul 2 12:31:33 2015 UTC,"The old tobacco reviews site had a hall of fame, and every so often blends were nominated and voted in, IIRC (maybe monthly).  When they switched to the newer format, I don't know if it went away, or what...  I spend more time here, anyways.  965 was in that hall of fame (and topped also smokingpipes.com's list of all time best selling Englishes).

I wanted to have a nice, long smoke today while I read, though, so I broke it out, filled it with a blend from my local B&M (Tobacco Grove in Maple Grove, MN), grabbed my Kindle and a nice brew, and lit up on my deck. I have to say, it was pretty great!  Even though I tend to smoke a little more quickly than I should, it still lasted me a good 50 minutes! Not bad at all! It's always nice smoking in a fresh pipe, too. The tobacco I was smoking was an English blend called A.M. Pipe. Pretty mellow, but in a fresh cob, it was delicious! I'm not really good at pairings, but I thought the Red Ale I grabbed, from a local brewery called Summit, was pretty good!

The fired-cured KY Burley tastes different than air-curred Burley and much different than latakia (more woody, BBQ smoky than campfire smoky, and more subtle smokiness), but is still a strong tobacco flavor that I love when it's lightly sweetened by the addition of VA leaf.   ODF is my favorite, PS AMsterdam is good, and if you want some Perique in there GLP Triple Play is great. 3 Nuns is also great, but a bit expensive."

The Doubloons  Doblone d'Oro (Doubloon of Gold) is aptly named. The individual coins are roughly the size and thickness of an American quarter. They look like a mosaic of different tobaccos, coarsely rolled into coins. The coins break apart fairly easily, and in a packed tin it's difficult to get many coins out unbroken. Neither thing is a problem as it makes a good way to break apart the tobacco for easier packing.  The Burn / Smoke  After packing a bowl, the tobacco was fairly springy when being lit. It also kind crumbles when tamping it back down. However, once it's lit, it kept the flame fairly well. I only had to relight once in a large bowl while smoking outside. Depending on how much you smoke, and how quickly, it might get a bit damp toward the end of the smoke, and the nicotine from the tobacco may hit you about 30 minutes into the smoke. That's par for many tobaccos. And it definitely doesn't count against this in any way. Just good to note it.  Final Opinion  Doblone d'Oro is a solid tobacco. Much like the scent, the taste is mild. It tastes like a smooth Virginia and Burley mix with only minimal sweetness, and the Perique adds a spicy note.  So who should smoke this? Well, if you like hugely aromatic or flavorful tobaccos, I would not recommend this one. This blend is a smooth smoker, but it's light on the taste and unimpressive on the room note.   BUT: Two types of smokers will definitely want to check this out. (1) If you're a fan of Virginia or Burley blends, this is definitely one that burns consistently, isn't too wet, and doesn't have an overwhelming sweetness. (2) If you've always wanted to try something with a notable part of Perique, but you've always been too cautious about it being overwhelming, this is a nice blend to taste what Perique does to a mix when balanced by other tobaccos."

Don't retrohale just after lighting or re-lighting.. It'll set your nostrils on fire.  The nicotine kick is for real.. I'm used to what you get from Nightcap, but I'll have to try that with a retrohale. I might pass out!

As mentioned above, Bayou Morning has a hefty dose of Perique. Stokkebye's Amsterdam has big KY flavor. You may want to try a straight VA or two (McClelland 5100, SG BBF, Newminster SNF) to see what they taste like without Perique. The first few VAs I smoked had Perique in them, and it wasn't until I smoked straight 'Ginnyweed that I found out which flavors the Perique was adding."

PipeTobacco,3bnjda,Pateirn,4,Tue Jun 30 17:39:48 2015 UTC,Their Indescribable blend is a pretty good aromatic also. I wouldn't say it fits as extra fruity though.

Sometimes, it scratches the right itch.  I know you've tried cherry blends, but have you tried Hawith Celtic Talisman?  They use all natural flavorings (abiding by the old British purity laws), and it's a natural cherry that is almost floral.  Really nice stuff."

PipeTobacco,3bm0u6,Avant-propos,5,Tue Jun 30 08:39:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and glad to hear you're coming along. To piggy back on this thought, a PSA for the new folks. Relighting is fine. I relight, lots of guys more veteran than me relight plenty. Too many guys make the mistake of over puffing to try to save their ember. They over heat the pipe and burn their tongues. Don't do it! Let me pipe cool, wait a bit, and relight.   To quote a Klingon proverb, ""The pain of a thousand relights is preferable to the stain of dishonor from a single burnout."""
PipeTobacco,3bm0u6,hedonaut,3,Tue Jun 30 12:03:24 2015 UTC,"Too many guys make the mistake of over puffing to try to save their ember. They over heat the pipe and burn their tongues.    This was me. I tended to over-conserve resources like lighter fluid. After I bought myself a huge bottle of butane and keep it on hand, I've since forced myself to ignore how long it takes to light or how much butane I'm using.  The key to keeping it lit for me has been to give it enough flame to begin with. I used to try to get by with a couple second light and then try to suck that mother into life. Now I keep my draw very gentle and just let it take as long as it wants to get a thorough ember to begin with. My tongue no longer hates me."
PipeTobacco,3bm0u6,star_boy2005,3,Tue Jun 30 16:44:41 2015 UTC,Agreed. I often get confused looks when I use two or even three charring lights. Getting that initial ember thick and even with a light head of ash is key.

Lo and behold! I haven't even heard of that game in at least 10 years. I have no idea why it popped into my head, but it is a great picnic lawn game. Possibly the best."
PipeTobacco,3bm0u6,Cycleoflife,3,Tue Jun 30 13:35:02 2015 UTC,"I've seen it before but never played it. I don't know if I learned all the rules, I watched two games and then I played. It is indeed ideal for smoking a pipe while playing. Another good game would be pétanque."
PipeTobacco,3bm0u6,Nicadimos,2,Tue Jun 30 20:24:40 2015 UTC,"I saw some guys playing at the beach last time I went. It looks cool, but it seems like it has a lot of rules. Most picnic games tend to be pretty simple. Toss this beanbag into that hole, hit this pole with a frisbee, toss this rope thing around those posts, etc."
PipeTobacco,3bm0u6,Cycleoflife,2,Tue Jun 30 15:17:25 2015 UTC,"Yea, I agree that there is a small learning curve versus corn hole or Frisbee, but it is no worse than croquet. Indeed I have forgotten the rules after so many years, but IIRC there was a strategy to it as well as throwing skill and the team play was superb. I promised myself that when I got back to the states I would make my own set, but never got around to it."
PipeTobacco,3bm0u6,Nicadimos,2,Tue Jun 30 17:37:09 2015 UTC,"It looks like something that if I had a consistent group I got together with, it would be a lot of fun. It doesn't look too hard to make a set."

PipeTobacco,3bl1ut,DenverTele,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:07:02 2015 UTC,"I really wanted to like Samovar.  And the flavor it had was lovely, but it was just too light for me.  I think I need something that punches you in the face a bit more with flavor.  I think it would be an excellent morning tobacco, but I almost never smoke in the morning (If I do, it's typically a cigar.) so I didn't see myself dipping into this one too often.  That's why I passed it on.  Great creamy texture to it though."
PipeTobacco,3bl1ut,AsIfThatWouldHappen,2,Tue Jun 30 12:35:10 2015 UTC,"Very similar to my thoughts, it has great complexity, it's ultra smooth and creamy, the taste is amazing, but it's not 'filling'. I found it a great all day smoke, and usually had something bigger at night."

Still a great smoke in it's own right.

PipeTobacco,3blplz,hedonaut,2,Tue Jun 30 11:58:53 2015 UTC,"When I feel like a VaPer, it's usually because I feel like a bright, fresh, sweet and peppery smoke to sip on and enjoy. I feel like a VaPer should be a light,delicious, refreshing smoke.  Not sure if it is the red stoved VA's, but the BMF felt a bit heavy and 'dour' if you will, compared to the escudo experience. Mind you it is still a great tasting smoke all the way, just might need to get in the mood for it myself next time.  After a few more bowls I'll do a review and see how it has grown on me, now I know what to expect. Even if I was looking for a new favourite 'darkside VaPer',this would never overthrow Six Pence haha."

I feel like each bowl is a chance to get to know what the blender thought rather than blend my own. I do tinker with unusual drink pairings, though, that go against traditional wisdom. I even include food sometimes. A stout Latakia blend without orientals seems greatly enhance by a piece of good chocolate nibbled as I smoke. I also find that a good gin and club can clear the palate in a way water doesn't, keeping me from adjusting to really full flavoured blends the same way a bite of yoghurt does between bites of spicy Indian food."

PipeTobacco,3bkrz4,Carl_Schmitt,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:59:55 2015 UTC,"I have that problem with Latakia a lot. It seems most blenders want to make every Latakia blend 50% and 75% Lat. Very few are content with just and ounce or two in a pound aside from Dunhill, whose Orientals disagree with me. Those who do blend light English blends make the blend all around too light. They marry a trace of Latakia to a limp blend of bright VAs that leave me equally dissatisfied. I've found a few blends that fill that niche nicely, but I'm always on the hunt for more."

PipeTobacco,3bkrz4,AsIfThatWouldHappen,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:14:58 2015 UTC,I will try some Blackhouse the next time the mood takes me. I know it carried quite the reputation over on pipesmagazine. It seemed to have a cult following for a few years there.
PipeTobacco,3bkrz4,hedonaut,2,Tue Jun 30 11:49:06 2015 UTC,"1) Blackhouse was the professional tasters winner in the Chicago tobacco throwdown to match the original Balkan Sobranie.  The pros got to taste and compare with aged original BS for comparison. So the rep. was well earned.  In that same throwdown the peons (like you and me) got to vote, but without the original BS to compare with, and they voted McClelland's Balkan Blue/Blue Mountain as the ""people's choice"" (i.e. best tasting).  2) Your comments about Latakia blends are not that far off, but that is probably because you are listening to lat. hounds like me, who tend to note those that are very lat. forward.  i find the same thing true with the perique phreaks, that the blends they tend to talk up perique has ceased to be the magic ""secret ingredient"" and has become the dominant factor.  And we see it elsewhere, as blenders contend to make the ""cherriest"" cherry blend, etc.  And you can carry it over into things like hot sauces and such.  I mean tell me, what use is a hot sauce  that is ""so hot"" that you just need one drop, if that means if you get two drops you have killed the dish? (I am still trying to figure out what to do with my dried ghost peppers, although I have successfully made a nice hot sauce from habaneros that can be eaten with due caution. LOL)  3) Unless I have missed out on some news, and what news it would be, I think your flair should read ""... And Runowski Was his Holy Prophet"".    Mind you as much as we miss ""Morleysson"", if you seek ""his monument"" you need look no further than the burley blends on the C&D list.  [Three young smokers at out most recent club get together were commenting how they couldn't smoke 'Morley's Best' and I just commented to pass it to me.  Think they were a touch overwhelmed by the Vitamin N content. :-) ]"
PipeTobacco,3bkrz4,blenheim45,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:38:44 2015 UTC,"1) I've heard something to that effect. I've also been told it stands well on its own merits as an English smoke. I suspect once the weather starts to turn again I'll have more interest in Lat forward blends, just not yet.  2)Agreed, though I think some components do interesting things when they're concentrated. Perique is drastically different when it makes up 5% of a blend vs when it comprises 50%. I think, too, that it requires a huge amount of skill on the part of the blender to pull off a successful blend with such a radical component. My tastes just don't lends themselves for enjoying Latakia this way more than occasionally. 50% is at the limits of my enjoyment. I can still really enjoy it, but it's an occasional treat rather than something I could smoke daily. I think your observation with hot sauce is an apt one. The buffalo wing world is awash with people after the most extreme rather than the best made or most flavorful. A well executed 75% Lat blend is fantastic, but it's strange how they dominate the market now in many ways when they once would have been inconceivable.   3) His spirit lives on in the old man funk of my pipes and the fields of Kentuckey and St. James Parish.

Or rather I read all his posts on Bob, PipeChat, etc., and on occasion had a comment that drew a response.  A man of great knowledge and a way of presenting it that never put anyone else off (oh, I wish I had that gift).  And this was at a time when ""flame wars"" and dogmatic positions defended to tooth and nail were not uncommon, even among internet pipe smokers.  Even though we knew his health was declining, it still came as a shock when the ""broken pipe"" announcements spread across the net.  Most of the boards I usually visited had ""Morleysson"" tribute pages, with many tributes to this knowledgeable and kindly tobacco blender.   re. pleasant lat blends.  I would love to know the story behind Arango's one bulk blend that carries their own name, as contrasted to blends that they distribute for other labels.  It won the 2014 throw down for ""Best English Blend"" against fierce competition (as one would expect).  Balkan Supreme is both quite nice and modestly priced, but not widely listed (of course you guys list it).  I know that Arango was supposedly involved in the hunt to recreate the original Balkan Sobranie blend, which had strayed so far from the original recipe and i wonder if it was a ""failed"" attempt.   One of those ""well this isn't it.... but damme sir if it isn't quite good none the less.""    As to the so hot it is painful, yeah I don't get that.  i grow habanero's every couple of years, but one good bush will provide me with more than enough heat for a couple of years.  I grow them because they have a flavor in addition to the heat that I like, but it has to be done in moderation or the heat will completely hide the flavor behind the pain of the heat (for me).  out of my several hot sauce attempts, the most successful has one minor ingredient that somehow makes a world of difference, although no one has every been able to detect the ingredient and i am at a loss to how it could make such a difference.  The ""secret"" is a minced raw carrot.  Like a blend that has a handful of one particular ""Oriental"" tobacco added to a ten pound bag.  you can't taste, you can't smell it, you can't see it, but you can taste the difference it makes.  the ""chili heads"" tell me there is this endorphin rush that follows the pain, but I think there are more pleasant ways to do that.

Granted, it's dicier than a briar in terms of longevity, but no briar in that price range is going to do much for you unless you get lucky with an estate. Clays are awesome, but fragile.

PipeTobacco,3bl9t7,smokewisps,3,Tue Jun 30 07:26:27 2015 UTC,You can get a decent briar pipe from a B&M for about 40-70 bucks if you're able to raise your budget on a pipe. My first pipe (after a cob of course) was an unmarked briar basket pipe and I haven't looked back since
PipeTobacco,3bl9t7,blenheim45,3,Tue Jun 30 14:00:15 2015 UTC,"New pipes under $25 are ""suspect"" to say the least.  So if that is your budget start with cobs, you can get a grab bag of cob seconds for $30 from MM.  Having said that start searching antique stores and fleamarkets.  The majority of my my pipes were bought from those sources, and if you are persistent you can find not just good, but occasionally great briars cheap.  nice thing about antique dealers is they price according to ""curb appeal"".  I have bought a lot of 5 pipes from an antique dealer [one Pete system, one GBD, a BBB, and two (2!) Dunhills; all from the 1930 to 1950 era] for a total of $60 (they were on the shelf at $15 each).  He had at the same time a really nice old carved meerschaum with nice coloring at $400 and a huge monstrosity of a cherrywood Ropp at $90.  The two pipes he saw value in were visually attractive, each in a different manner. he saw them as decorative pieces, where the pipes I bought were just old basic wooden pipes.  In my experience this is not that uncommon... although the inclusion of two pre-WW2 Dunhills is uncommon.  You don't have to ""hit the jackpot"" like I did to be worthwhile though.  There are lots of good briars out there if you learn to pick the wheat from the chaff.  The nice thing is that you are just as likely to find a dozen pipes as one.  And if you find a goodie you may find several.  Smokers don't tend to half 12 basket pipes and one pricier pipe.  They tend to buy to a level of quality, so if there are a couple of Peterson's, then the Kaywoodies they have will also be better ones too.  YMMV and good luck."
PipeTobacco,3bl9t7,tennesseean_87,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:03:22 2015 UTC,"After I bought a Kaywoodie for less than $10 on eBay, I grabbed a random lot of pipes for about $30.

Most folk, including myself, see most cobs as disposable.

Take the flake and depending on how big the flake is cut three strips length wise then cut cubes out of them using the bigger pieces on the bottom and the broken up pieces on the very top to get a good light. Make sure the flake is dried out properly too, you want there to be barely enough flex in it where it doesn't snap when folded, I also found you don't really need to tamp unless re-lighting is impossible.

PipeTobacco,3bih57,geese,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:05:05 2015 UTC,"Sort of depends, I kind of have trouble nailing down exactly what someone might mean by ""lighter and sweeter"". I haven't smoked a great deal of squadron leader as my body chemistry disagrees with it (kind of stings my mouth).   I'd say Skiff is sweeter than SL because of the orientals. It has a not-quite vanilla flavor as a result. The smoke is far thicker and creamier than SL and the nicotine level is about the same. I expect ""lakeland essence"" refers to whatever process is used to give the tobacco that sort of velvety consistency and if that's the case, it's present in both blends.  I favor latakia/oriental heavy blends (Skiff being my favorite) so I'm a little biased. The Westminster is more similar to Nightcap and is also fucking awesome."
PipeTobacco,3bih57,CaptainDickPuncher,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:23:32 2015 UTC,There's no lakeland essence on either of those tobaccos. The Lakeland essence really only applies to a select group of extremely floral aromatics. The lakeland flavour is a very traditional style of floral aromatics that only come from the Lakeland region (pretty much just from Samuel Gawith or Gawith Hoggarth and co) and they're very much a love it or hate it style.

PipeTobacco,3bih57,thewanderingdude_,3,Mon Jun 29 16:02:48 2015 UTC,Well if you want Va's then try Artisans Blend. I can't recommend that one enough.
PipeTobacco,3bih57,Fabiansruse,3,Mon Jun 29 16:07:37 2015 UTC,I would recommend Old Dublin over Davidoff Royalty. I just finished a tin of Royalty and found it pretty unremarkable. It's not unpleasant but nothing exciting. Old Dublin on the other hand is one of my favourite English blends.
PipeTobacco,3bih57,tennesseean_87,2,Mon Jun 29 21:12:20 2015 UTC,I was also going to suggest the Frog Morton stuff... I just got some Blackhouse... not quite as strong as Nightcap - might be a good choice.
PipeTobacco,3bih57,defrost24601,2,Mon Jun 29 16:05:13 2015 UTC,I think McClelland British Woods should fit nicely with you.
PipeTobacco,3bih57,raizel_234,2,Mon Jun 29 16:20:23 2015 UTC,"Have you tried the royal yacht?  It's pretty nice, especially in this summer heat.  smokingpipes.com also has baby's bottom and the 3-year matured VA."
PipeTobacco,3bih57,PipeBeard,2,Mon Jun 29 21:46:10 2015 UTC,"Dan's Gordon Pym is good, and I liked the few bowls I've had so far of McClelland 2020 a lot (and it's bulk!). GLP Westminster is great. Suttliff Berkshire is a medium ENglish, but does have some Perique to it, thought I found it more fruity than peppery.   For a heavier blend I love HH Vintage Syrian."
PipeTobacco,3bhxm3,birdlandbass,12,Mon Jun 29 10:55:12 2015 UTC,"I think the problem here is that you previously vaped and went to aromatics. Maybe you thought it was gonna taste more like it smells? It's not shisha. Most aromatics have a super mild taste when it comes to the flavoring. A lot of people hate them, stating they just taste like hot air (I like some of them so I'm not one of those people).   There are ridiculous amounts of pipe tobacco out there, and you should try the different genres before you decide to leave."
PipeTobacco,3bhxm3,MisterHall,3,Mon Jun 29 12:03:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback!  You pretty much hit the nail on the head as far as my mindset on aromatics went. I definitely got that ""hot air"" sensation while I was smoking that MacBaren, but I'll look around for some other tobaccos and see what catches my eye. Thanks again."
PipeTobacco,3bhxm3,the_costello_show,6,Mon Jun 29 18:18:26 2015 UTC,"Forget about what you got out of your tobacco choice for a moment... did you enjoy smoking your pipe? Did you enjoy the preparing your tobacco, packing your bowl, and sitting down to slowly savor in just slowing things down for a while? It sounds like you certainly enjoyed researching pipes and tobaccos and you relished in the process of preparing the pipe for a smoke, so if you enjoyed the act of smoking the pipe I'd say your problem is you've simply not found a tobacco that appeals to you.   Give it time. I'm still fairly new to pipe smoking, and my tastes are just starting to develop and refine. Don't expect to be able to discern each flavor when you're just starting out. Try to get a sampling of each type of tobacco (there's plenty of trades to be found around here) and just enjoy exploring for a while. If you find something you enjoy, explore deeper into similar blends. You'll eventually find what appeals to you and, at the same time, you'll start to find you're able to pick up more of the subtleties as your smoking palate develops.  Pipe smoking is a journey, not a destination."
PipeTobacco,3bhxm3,IUseExtraCommas,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:16:44 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your feedback!  As far as your questions go: yes to all of them. I chose the perfect day to do it since it was sunny, not too hot, and slightly breezy. It was incredibly relaxing and it was just nice being able to sit and forget about the world for a while.   Now my choice of tobacco, I've replied to two posts so far and I'm pretty sure I'm seeing a pattern. I should've definitely tried picking out several tobaccos and sampling them instead of buying one large tin. That was probably one of my mistakes in starting out. I'll try doing some more research and picking out some different varieties of tobacco and report back at a later date. Again, thanks for your feedback!"
PipeTobacco,3bhxm3,SupraMario,4,Mon Jun 29 18:23:05 2015 UTC,"It could be that pipe smoking isn't for you, and while that would be a shame, it does happen. :)    But, I also think that it might be too high of expectations, or just the wrong tobacco for you.  Just from your post, I wonder if you should approach it from the standpoint of experiencing what countless sailor, soldiers, detectives and coal miners experienced in days of yore...  ie, try some good old fashioned blends..  with the intent of discovering and old tradition.  Don't expect every bowl to smoke great, and don't expect to do it right every time.  Each pipe and tobacco has a magic to uncover, but it has to be uncovered by trial and error.   Start with old time tobacco styles, not aromatics, to get into the era.  (I do like aromatics, but I tend to like non-aromatics a little more usually.)  Since you've done a lot of research, you've probably read about drying your tobacco, and smoking slowly.  That can't be stressed too much, and goes double with aromatics.  I thought I understood it when I started, but eventually realized, that what I thought was dry, and what I thought was slow, was not dry enough or slow enough. :)    Here are some tobaccos that I think you could find more complexity with;  McClelland 5100 Red Cake.  Inexpensive bulk, great smoke, great sweet Virginia flavor, also great to blend with other tobaccos to mellow them out.  Anything in the Frog Morton series to try an English blend.  I've had 'on the Town' and 'on the Bayou'.    Mac Baren Scottish Mixture.  This has a lot of everything, and each bowl offers up something a little different.  So if you are looking to find complexities, this seems like a good choice.  Some B&M stores will let you try samples in the store, or sell in small amounts.  If you can find one of those, it might be what you need."
PipeTobacco,3bhxm3,BrackGin,2,Mon Jun 29 12:34:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the great feedback!  I will say that I tend to set myself some impossibly high standards, and I probably was coming at pipe smoking from a weird angle. I'll definitely look in to some of those tobaccos you mentioned and post back at a later date with my new experiences. Thanks again!"
PipeTobacco,3bhxm3,cheoperative,3,Mon Jun 29 18:36:32 2015 UTC,"Most Aros are difficult to figure out, I've found just a few so far that have hit the spot for me. Pipe smoking is not something you can just pickup and figure out in one sitting, it's taken me a good long while now to even begin to get a hint of taste or flavor. I'll also be honest with you, the Mac Baren Vanilla Cream you tried, also tasted like hot campfire to me. Just because it smells good, doesn't mean it's going to taste good.  Give it another shot, it takes a while."
PipeTobacco,3bhxm3,shavinghobbit,3,Mon Jun 29 14:03:21 2015 UTC,"For the tasty side of things you can always go Cavendish, there are some mild ones that balance the tobacco's strength with other flavors. As any other redditor will tell you, it all comes down to personal taste. If you do try to get into it once more be sure to know what you want out of it and not judge it by your expectations.  Heck now you know to stay away from that blend, you might want to trade it out later on when you have a clearer picture of your preference."
PipeTobacco,3bhxm3,BWeice,3,Mon Jun 29 14:27:35 2015 UTC,"I started out on aromatics and quickly gave up, for about 4 years! Then I tried again, with some english blends, no aromatics and I've been puffing ever since.  Try this packing method: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XHYPso7TXs"
PipeTobacco,3bhxm3,arterianSanor,3,Mon Jun 29 15:14:23 2015 UTC,"Okay a few things:   Okay, no matter how much you read up (and watch videos) about packing and lighting a pipe, it is still something you very much need to actually practice before you get good at it. I am like you, I spent a lot of time researching everything about smoking a pipe before I even packed my first bowl and now, after smoking a bunch (at least once a day for the last 3 or so weeks and a few more times a couple years ago) I am just getting ""okay"" at packing a pipe. I find that building up a palette for smoke is a lot harder than it is for other stuff. No matter how good you are at detecting flavors in other things, tobacco is a whole different ball game. Also, as others have said aromatic tobacco is... odd in some ways. It doesn't taste how it smells, often times there is just a slight tinge of flavor brought by the casing, despite how it smells. If you smoke a cherry tobacco and expect it to taste strongly of cherries then you will probably be disappointed. Now, in my opinion I would suggest going out and buying some highly rated and different kinds of tobacco. Get your self a good English, a good Virginia and maybe a good burley (though really, all you need is a good English and Virginia to get started).  Next time you smoke, arm your self with a review for the tobacco that you are smoking. See what others have said about that tobacco and the flavors they detect and see if you can find them in the tobacco, really search for those flavors and try to find them. At first you might not be able to, but eventually you will be able to smoke a tobacco that people have described as ""spicy, sweet and a little nutty"" and actually be able to find those flavors and understand what it means when some one describes a tobacco in this way... because it may not be what you expect. Lastly, remember that pipe smoking is not like a cigarette, or vaping or even cigars. There is a lot to say of the ritual of smoking a pipe, it takes a while to do it right and it takes even longer to learn how to do it right. Don't stress if the bowl isn't packed right, or it goes out or if your bowl gets too hot. Just remember what you did that caused those things to happen and don't do them again."
PipeTobacco,3bhxm3,d3rp_diggler,2,Mon Jun 29 15:42:51 2015 UTC,"Like most have said, some but not all aromatics are just flavoring to make it smell good but nothing more but hot air now on the other hand there are very good aromatics that don't soak in humectants and use quality tobacco such as the ones /u/IUseExtraCommas suggested.  You most certainly have to smoke a bit more to get those notes in the flavors, however don't drive yourself mad looking for them like I did it will drive you insane your first few bowls haha. Do some research on tobacco reviews and find something that appeals to you, start building a small sampler bunch and smoke a few bowls of each, eventually you will start building your flavor portfolio in your head.  What I found to be the most simplest and provided good flavors for me in packing is by just gravity feeding the bowl, it is tight enough to smoke long and loose enough to not need many relights. Gravity feeding is just pinching a bit of tobacco dropping it in your bowl and gently as ever press it down so it doesn't clog the air hole and repeat until the bowl is full. Test the draw by sipping as you normally would when you smoke it should have little to no resistance and you should be good to go.  Don't give up and try try again it's a tradition of patience that makes it what it is.  *edit: left out some important information (D'oh) Drying your tobacco greatly helps, to see if its at a good level to smoke pinch what you took out to put in your bowl if it sticks together after you release it than it is too wet, if it crumbles than it is too dry. what you want to happen is it separates back into individual strands. Drying helps bring out the flavors immensely"

The Golden Gate is a historical site in the center of Kiev, it was the main gate into the ancient city one thousand years ago. However, for pipesmokers this name is associated with the only briar pipes manufacturer in former Soviet republics. Golden Gate is the only company in Ukraine manufacturing briar smoking pipes for over 20 years. Though the Ukrainian company has been involved into tobacco activity for over thirty years, making wooden smoking pipes, it has become popular, having started to make briar pipes. Briar is supplied from the Italian Tuscany. The raw material is treated under the European technology. The high-quality ebonite is used for mouthpieces of Golden Gate pipes. Skilled and talented masters design various and very beautiful models of smoking pipes. Each series is created under the general idea, and the assortment is replenished annually with new lines of smoking pipes. The most talented Ukrainian designer Konstantin Shekita has been working in Golden Gate for many years and he still creates some models for them."

Ask for blend recommendations to pair with your preffered tastes, for example some things that they could find useful are:  -how you like your coffee  -do you like campfire smells  -do you prefer heavy earthy tastes or sweeter lighter flavors  -do you like the tingle of black pepper in your throat when you get an over seasoned dish?

PipeTobacco,3bgul2,blenheim45,7,Mon Jun 29 04:02:57 2015 UTC,"there are pipe stores and there are pipe stores.for the past couple of decades the money has been in cigars in tobacconists, and for a large part still is.  Figure a guy can walk in and drop $200 easily on cigars and if he is buying modestly he has 20 to 30 cigars and if he is a high roller he may have 5 or 6.  Doesn't take much time to burn through those leaving nothing but ashes and he is coming back for more.  and then they start selling him things like humidors and such.  New pipe smoker walks in and drops $200 and walks out with a decent starter pipe or a basket pipe ($50 to 80), and depending on where he is in the US a slew of tobacco, pipe cleaners, probably a little pouch, and that tobacco is going to last him quite a while, and the pipe probably will last years.   when they both walk back into the store the cigar buyer may drop the same amount again, more if he is buying accessories, the pipe smoker won't, unless he has decided to get a second pipe already... you see where this goes don't you?  The cigar smoker stands around and gasses with the others there and will smoke one or more of his purchases, the pipe smoker may smoke a (one) bowl of tobacco, which may even be a free sample, and just possibly a second bowl.  Even if both bowls are his own tobacco he hasn't made a major dent in his supply.  Now a lot of former tobacconists and pipe stores, or the newer ones are pipes for smoking other material than tobacco.  you will see pipes made of metal, glass, and god knows what else.  There will a hundred different types of rolling papers, and just maybe to keep the pretense up that they a 'legit"" enterprise there maybe some ""pipe tobacco"" although beware it may just be RYO cigarette tobacco labeled pipe tobacco to get taxed at a lower rate.  The second type of store won't help you because frankly they probably know less than you do.  The first type may help you, if you find one of the people on staff who actually know something.  As a clue look for the guy who is oldest in the store, because any ""new hires"" and young guys aren't going to have been around when pipes were in.  They will have spent their time learning the differences in cigars and how to sell them, that is what any in store training is going to have been about.  There are good tobacconists who care about pipes, they are just a lot rarer today.  I know if I find myself in Boston I am going to Peretti's, in Chicago - Iwan Ries; Central Florida it's Edwards and that covers from Orlando to the gulf and up and down the gulf too; Lexington Kentucky Schwab's or Fayette Cigar; Eastern Tennessee it's Gatlinburlier, and so on.  Let us know where you are and someone may have a good place near by.  Or if you find a goodie, let the rest of us know.     The starter kits here are a great place to start, you needn't start with the cheapest cob version, and you should read up on the first sections of ""Our Wiki"" which will help you sound less like a green horn any where you go.

PipeTobacco,3bgul2,BWeice,5,Mon Jun 29 14:16:44 2015 UTC,"I am new to pipe smoking as well (tried a few times in the last 2-3 years but always bought the disgusting pouch tobacco from headshops that tasted like shredded paper towels someone wiped their ass with and would quit after a week or so, trying again months later with a similar tobacco and an identical result) so I can offer you perspective from someone only one or two steps ahead of you who has just discovered his local tobacconist/pipe & cigar lounge:   As recommended, go to a basic smoke shop and buy a cheap $5 cob pipe first. You could buy a nicer pipe once you're at your pipe store, but the reason you should go there WITH a pipe is because the owner should be cool with letting you sample a number of tobaccos in-store. I wish I would have known this on my first visit. Don't pretend to be knowledgeable. If anything, let them know you're new so the tobacconist can act accordingly. You don't want him to assume you know your shit because he will rely on the knowledge he assumes you have instead of offering more thorough assistance knowing you're new. Ask for advice and for suggestions. Who doesn't love offering advice and expert opinions to beginners relating to the field/interest they are knowledgeable in? It is okay to answer ""I don't know"" to the tobacconist's questions. This gives him complete creative control in deciding which pipe, tobacco and supplies to recommend and/or let you try which I am sure he would enjoy.  Sample, or, if you don't feel comfortable sampling a bunch of different kinds of tobacco, at least ask which of each tobacco -- aromatic, non-aromatic, English blend -- they would recommend and buy at least an ounce of each as a sort of tobacco sampler pack. Many smokers would recommend that you only smoke one type of tobacco in one pipe, i.e. one pipe devoted to smoking only aromatics. I wouldn't worry about this as a beginner, especially if you have one (or maybe buy two or three) cheap cob pipe as you will be sure to upgrade to better pipes if you decide the hobby is to your liking. If for some reason you're dealing with a tobacconist who isn't quite knowledgable and can't dispense with informed suggestions, it is no big deal to decide on tobacco based purely on smell, so don't be afraid to ask to smell some available blends. Don't forget to get a pipe tool and pipe cleaners! Don't get suckered into buying crazy things like a $90 steel lighter with a built-in tamper. Maybe invest in one nice pipe but keep everything else basic for now. Don't be intimidated. We all have to start somewhere.    Bonus: Turn a friend on to pipe smoking so you could hang out at the lounge (if your store has a lounge), try a bunch of blends, get to know the local community. This is something I also would like to do. I suppose I could try to at least invite my friends who smoke cigarettes to come and smoke a cigar haha."
PipeTobacco,3bgul2,soymilkisgood,5,Mon Jun 29 09:51:59 2015 UTC,"What's your price range on a pipe, have you smoked cigars previously or any tobacco and you can get away with using a bic lighter/zippo/matches unless you want to splurge on a pipe lighter which has a slight angle DO NOT USE A TORCH LIGHTER  When buying a pipe make sure it has good even drilling, ask before you undo the stem or ask them to do it for you making sure the draft hole is aligned with the bottom of the bowl and tenon."

Estoterica tobaccos are not sold outside the U.S. Germain's Rich Dark Flake is very close to Stonehaven, though. Comes only in bulk, and is not as widely available as the tinned blends.  I understand that real tobacconists have been disappearing in the UK for quite some time, and it's not a given that there's one in every town. Some newsagent's shops might carry pipe tobaccos. I hear that St.Bruno is available even in Tescos. It's arguably the best quality OTC in world."

If you're going to Edinburgh, you're in a bit of luck because there are several shops which sell pipe tobacco. At least two on the Royal Mile that I can think of offhand. (But then again, I'm a Glaswegian and try to spend as little time as possible in Edinburgh)  You'll find a couple of shops called Robert Graham, both in Edinburgh and Glasgow, which specialise in whisky and cigars, but also have pretty good selection of pipes and pipe tobacco. They most certainly stock Germain tobaccos."

Most of the local stores I've been in have had quite little to do with pipes as well, but its great to be able to find some amazing things that ""slip through the cracks"" in the system.  I had a similar thing happen with a liquor store back in college.  They had a few old bottles of 1960's Aberlour Scotch that they had just found in the back of the store when they moved that they were selling for about 1/10 of their value. I told them about what they were missing out on, but they still let me buy one for their original marked price.  They were a truly kind older couple who ran the store and I didn't want them to get ripped off.  It was an incredible experience that I would never have been able to have without that kind of luck.  Sometimes it does pay to look in unexpected places."
PipeTobacco,3beqm3,PeskyPrussian,4,Sun Jun 28 15:44:31 2015 UTC,"I had a (kind of) similar thing happen with a bottle of Wild Turkey Rare Breed that was being sold for about $40 due to old price data since it was on the self for so long. The store owner saw the clerk ring it up and and then saw the price. He tried to say it was wrong and was mispriced and tried to override the computer, I disputed that it was the same price he had on the shelf tag and showed him which shelf I got it from with the tag clearly marked ""Wild Turkey Rare Breed $39.99"". While it was a dick bag thing for him to initially insist on trying to charge me more when he saw the tag (and the crowd of customers watching the exchange) he relented and told the clerk to finish the sale at the marked price. While the clerk was finishing my sale the owner proceeded to pull the tag and the remaining stock off the shelf so no one else could buy it at that price.

He went and grabbed three more as soon as I finished explaining, and I had to ring them at the same price. He only intended to buy one, but once he saw he could take advantage of the situation, he did. That's just greed.

I am guessing that this pipe was made some time in the past 20-35 years.   It is a great looking pipe, nonetheless. I love good lattice work. I own a topkopi with similar lattice and they color in a really interesting way."
PipeTobacco,3bcxou,lightningserpent,2,Sun Jun 28 04:42:26 2015 UTC,That is a pretty cool looking meerschaum pipe. I bet it would have some awesome coloring if it got smoked enough.

I love they way they color over time and if you give them a nice wax and buff after they darken up a bit they look awesome.

PipeTobacco,3bcns0,Slamfrankel,2,Sun Jun 28 01:31:01 2015 UTC,"I have one of these exactly. I've smoked mine about 10 times, and it's getting dark. The inside has a nice char layer forming, and the outside is getting darker, but the top is getting darker than I'd like and I am very careful to not get flame on the wood there. I am looking forward to getting some wax on it this week to shine it up a bit. It feels nice in the hand, but seems to burn hotter than my finished pipes. Not sure if this is really a thing or if it's my imagination. Either way, it's beautiful, and I love it."

I have 4 of these Savinelli Seconds/Unfinished and they are my coolest smokers.. You must be a seasoned pro when it comes to cadence so i'm not even going to bother to ask  how quick you smoke. I work with my hands in the sun all day so granted my skin is like leather but the pipes barely seem to get warm at all when i smoke them.. I feel stupid giving you any suggestions but try putting a dry blend in and pack it half way up the bowl. That should be a quick and not so hot smoke. You will build a cake after doing that 5 or 6 times. Once again I'm just suggesting things you probably already know. Don't give  up on that pipe!!"

I think that would make it looks really nice with the natural wood color. Anyway, I'm going to work with some other tobaccos, concentrate on pacing, etc. Most of my pipes have more wood on 'em, so they tend to have more surface area to cool. This little Dublin is pretty thin walled compared to most of my other pipes.   Take care, and thanks for the tips! I may have been smoking longer than you've been alive (lol) but I'm never too old to be reminded of proper technique."

PipeTobacco,3bby7d,arklenaut,15,Sat Jun 27 19:30:18 2015 UTC,"Several hours rest is primarily for drying. It is simply to evaporate the majority of moisture near the surface of the chamber. Without resting, your pipes may sour quicker. Days are usually recommended to completely dry a pipe."
PipeTobacco,3bby7d,MaydayBorder,2,Sat Jun 27 19:57:15 2015 UTC,This.
PipeTobacco,3bby7d,tennesseean_87,2,Sun Jun 28 00:45:25 2015 UTC,Note that meerschaum pipes cool faster than briar and you do not want a cake to build inside them. They need to rest only a fraction of the time before they can be smoked again.

PipeTobacco,3bb4c4,carnesy,5,Sat Jun 27 15:02:26 2015 UTC,What's your opinions on 4th Generation tobaccos? Specifically the 1931 and 1855 blends? My local B&M has a crap load of tins from 2012 sitting there and I want to know if it's worth picking up a few tins of each as one is a navy flake and the other is a straight Va blend.
PipeTobacco,3bb4c4,bonehed,3,Sat Jun 27 19:54:54 2015 UTC,I've had a flake or two of the 1931 and enjoyed it (thanks again /u/rkdc). A decent burley (mostly). Haven't had the other...
PipeTobacco,3bb4c4,SupraMario,3,Sat Jun 27 20:26:47 2015 UTC,This is what I'm about to go grab its discounted and has been sitting for like 5 years now lol
PipeTobacco,3bb4c4,carnesy,3,Sun Jun 28 17:32:52 2015 UTC,I went with the 1931 that's 4 years old and it's amazing. If you can get it oldrr and cheaper go for it.

PipeTobacco,3bb4c4,carnesy,3,Mon Jun 29 01:27:43 2015 UTC,"Don't know, like I said I've only tried the 1931 flake. Smoke a bowl of what you got and then decide if they are worth it. If you get em and later down the line decide you don't care for them they can act as trade fodder if nothing else."
PipeTobacco,3bb4c4,SupraMario,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:36:40 2015 UTC,Well I have high hopes for these as they are the first really aged tins I've ever gotten.
PipeTobacco,3bb4c4,gestalt162,2,Mon Jun 29 02:21:48 2015 UTC,I've heard that the straight Va is a carbon copy of MacBaren Virginia #1.  The only one I've had is their English (think it's called Founders' Blend) and I thought it was fantastic.
PipeTobacco,3bb4c4,TheHonourableCurls,4,Sat Jun 27 23:32:21 2015 UTC,How does everyone have their collection display if at all. Eventually when I get somewhat of a collection built up I'd like to display it properly instead of just having them lay around in some drawer.
PipeTobacco,3bb4c4,bonehed,4,Sun Jun 28 05:02:51 2015 UTC,Racks or cabinets. Drawers aren't a great option as some airflow is ideal for drying a recently used pipe.  You can't visually admire your collection if in a closed drawer either.
PipeTobacco,3bb4c4,LegesAequitas,3,Sun Jun 28 14:11:05 2015 UTC,I agree with /u/bonehed. I use racks myself and it is important to have some decent airflow for a recently used pipe. I once was traveling with a pipe and put it in a pouch immediately after use. After a few days in the pouch the chamber was still moist and had developed a very stale and acrid smell which shows the necessity of giving the pipes some air. One note I might add is to be careful with light and moisture when storing pipes with vulcanite stems in racks or cases exposed to light or moisture as it can expedite the oxidation of the stems.
PipeTobacco,3bb4c4,tennesseean_87,2,Sun Jun 28 14:46:05 2015 UTC,"I've got racks, but I sort of want them to be closed to light to slow down stem oxidation. maybe in my new place. Lots of mine ride in the passenger seat of my car because that's where I smoke a lot."
PipeTobacco,3bb4c4,hedonaut,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:26:06 2015 UTC,I've never heard of light causing oxidation. I always assumed it was a function of moisture in the atmosphere and your lips.
PipeTobacco,3bb4c4,tennesseean_87,2,Mon Jun 29 02:39:41 2015 UTC,UV rays speed oxidation. I've got a pipe with a stem oxidized on one side because that's the side facing the window (even from across the room).

I love every one of them, but have issues packing C&D blends because they're rather dry coarse ribbon cut with lots of chunks. What's the best way to pack C&D tobaccos?    Thanks."
PipeTobacco,3bb4c4,BWeice,3,Sat Jun 27 20:42:08 2015 UTC,"I very coarsely break the chunks up into smaller chunks then gravity feed it pinch by pinch tapping the bowl to level it out in between each pinch, this has worked good for me."
PipeTobacco,3bb4c4,tennesseean_87,3,Sat Jun 27 21:36:48 2015 UTC,"I do a looser, more gravity fill with less downward pressure than other blends."
PipeTobacco,3bb4c4,CurlyFatAngry,2,Mon Jun 29 01:24:41 2015 UTC,So one gravity fill or three with different pressures just lighter? Wouldn't one gravity fill leave a lot of air in the bowl?
PipeTobacco,3bb4c4,tennesseean_87,3,Mon Jun 29 01:38:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe two fills, but ultra-light pressure--much less than the standard 3-step method. I'd only use a pure gravity-fill for something like a cube-cut."
PipeTobacco,3bb4c4,hedonaut,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:45:03 2015 UTC,"This, /u/curleyfatangry, is how I, myself, handle it. Those little bits of compressed tobacco, likely bright VA flake, will unravel and expand quite a bit. A lot of the components used in C&D blends are pressed and flaked to change the way they handle and taste, but it does lead to a rougher mix. They always burn nicely despite it, but it's still a matter of ongoing 'research' so to speak. A lot of the guys have been working on ways to even it out some without changing the way the blends taste and burn to try and achieve better packing."

PipeTobacco,3bb4c4,Mordenkrad,3,Sun Jun 28 13:17:17 2015 UTC,"just smoke it more. Pipes tend to cool as they build cake and get smoked.   A lot of people blame lack of cake, but I think it's something a little more than that for pipe heat. I think it has to do something with conditioning the oily briar to handle the heat, too, but I have no concrete proof for this process."

In all seriousness the only problem with buying online is when the TAD kicks in and you realize you have to make your cart smaller on smokingpipes because a 300 dollar charge to your bank account won't get past your wife.

I know what blends I'm getting in bulk and have a wide selection to choose from at better prices than I can get in person.   My personal opinion is that if you're just starting out, you should explore and develop your palate with cheaper bulk tobaccos like Stokkebye, Newminster, and C&D. The value is excellent, and it will help narrow down the overwhelming quantity of options you get when buying online. Once you know what genres you like, move on to more expensive bulks (McClelland, Gawiths, etc.) or tins, but you may find you like some of the bulk blends just as well."

Fikri Baki is ahead of the game on this, keeping up with modern techniques and using real Cumberland stems. Tekin & WGM (formerly IMP) are not far behind but not quite on the same level as Baki. I'm the same way about taking my turkish meerschaums on the go, I don't. If you want the benefits of meerschaum on the go check out vintage African meerschaums they are tougher and smoke as well as Turkish IMO, contrary to popular consensus."

PipeTobacco,3b9wnq,antiwittgenstein,2,Sat Jun 27 18:11:27 2015 UTC,"I just finished my first bowl of McClelland Legends and I thought of your post. Not as BBQ spicy as ODF but way more sweet, like you are looking for. The flavor is like BBQ chicken where you continually slather the meat with BBQ sauce while it cooks and it burns but stays sweet. It would be interesting to load one on top of the other and see what effect that brings. Also, it would be fun to try to blend McClelland 5100 Red Cake with ODF... Hmm must start blending..."
PipeTobacco,3b9wnq,Cycleoflife,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:56:12 2015 UTC,"Old Dark Fired, Dublone D'Oro,  and Black Frigate. ODF and DdO both feature healthy doses of Dark Fired Kentucky, a sort of fire cured burley. The smoke smell from that reminds me more of barbeque than Latakia. Black Frigate is a Latakia mix with a rum topping which helps sweeten it up.   The problem of sweet and smokey is that Latakia is very dry. It's hard to get a very Lat forward blend sweet without loading up on the casings. A lot of guys love the Frog Mortan series, which I find to be too sweet and mild, but they're most definitely worth exploring. If you want to try a specialist in really heavy Latakia blends, take a look at Pease. G.L. Pease is a Lat lover himself, and most of his blends feature Latakia as the most prominent component. They're very smokey, but may not have the sweet notes you're looking for.   If you want to explore more McClelland, check out Balkan Blue and British Woods. I think they're both really excellent Latakia blends, and by virtue of being McClelland blends, they're automatically much sweeter than other blenders. It's just McC's nature to trend sweet like that, while C&D and Pease tend to be dryer, but stronger and fuller in body.   EDIT: If we're talking McC Lat blends, how could I have forgotten Bombay Extra. That's another really wonderful blend of theirs. If I have to make a list of 5 tins, Black Frigate by C&D, Abingdon by Pease, Old Dark Fired by Macbaren, Bombay Extra by McClelland, and maybe... Lagonda by Pease? That has a little more bright VA to sweeten it up."
PipeTobacco,3b9wnq,hedonaut,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:04:07 2015 UTC,"Once again I'll be the contrarian here. Concerning Mac Baren Old Dark Fired this time. I don't find much sweetness at all in ODF. I think it's a good smoke in its austere way, but I find myself wanting in sweetness. A fine tobacco to try, though.  I do agree agree on McClelland suggestions. I'll add Three Oaks Syrian and Wilderness. McClelland is famous for their virginia blends, but I've grown to like their lat/oriental blends. Especially those with Syrian lat."
PipeTobacco,3b9wnq,jarvis400,2,Sat Jun 27 16:39:04 2015 UTC,"I recommended ODF in a different comment but noted it is not a perfect match. You articulated why. It does not have the sweetness OP is looking for, but the BBQ sauce seasoning it has in spades."
PipeTobacco,3b9wnq,Cycleoflife,2,Sat Jun 27 19:13:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed. DF Kentucky leaf spiciness is sort of closer to BBQ than latakia, but is also very ""dry""."
PipeTobacco,3b9wnq,jarvis400,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:46:50 2015 UTC,In my opinion I think McClellands Arcadia tasted and smelled exactly like bbq. It reminded me of when me and my friends would make bbq smoked meats which is why it didn't last very long before I finished it

Their 333 is a personal favorite of mine.  It has a lot of the things you'd look for in a straight up burley blend, from the natural chocolately aroma, to the body and cool burn, to the natural, clean, nutty flavor, to the exact right amount of that burley sour."

PipeTobacco,3b7bki,soymilkisgood,2,Fri Jun 26 15:59:12 2015 UTC,This was one of my original favorites. I was gifted a tin by an old user who's not around anymore. It's terrifically sweet without coming off as cased or topped.
PipeTobacco,3b7bki,ijustreadidontpost,3,Fri Jun 26 17:20:56 2015 UTC,"Burley is generally not my flavor profile. It can be too harsh and strong (C&D blends, I'm sorry to say, being a main offender here). It's good with other things sometimes, though. Like VaBur flakes and the like."
PipeTobacco,3b7bki,soymilkisgood,2,Fri Jun 26 15:46:11 2015 UTC,"I find it doesn't take much of the right variety to get the flavor into the smoke. Chenet's has a little white burley in it, surprisingly enough. I was unaware of that when I reviewed it, but I certianly tasted a little of that familiar sour funk. White burley most of all has that harsh quality to it. Even Three Friars is only a quarter burley or so, which is surprising for how much it comes across in the flavor profile."
PipeTobacco,3b7bki,tennesseean_87,2,Fri Jun 26 15:50:52 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of recommending Three Friars, but I didn't realize it had that little burley.  OP should probably get some, anyway!"

PipeTobacco,3b7bki,tennesseean_87,2,Fri Jun 26 17:21:17 2015 UTC,"Not all Burley is created equal, certainly. I usually just don't like it if it's too prominent in a blend, especially if it's too green."

PipeTobacco,3b7bki,soymilkisgood,2,Fri Jun 26 19:32:36 2015 UTC,"Finally, the truth comes out! About 1/4 Burley. That's about what I'd have guessed from tasting a few bowls, but some people around here have been calling it a Burley blend. Guys have tried it and thought they must like Burley b/c they like a blend with 25% Burley, so they get recommendations for Burley blends. But just because you like 3F doesn't mean you like Big 'n' Burley or Haunted Bookshop!"
PipeTobacco,3b7bki,the_costello_show,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:48:30 2015 UTC,"Very true! But the burley component is evident there. It's similar to a lot of guys liking mild VaPers like Luxury Navy Flake or Luxury Bullseye Flake trying to tangle with a blend like Chenet's Cake, or, god forbid, Exclusive. It's all a matter of degree."
PipeTobacco,3b7bki,the_costello_show,2,Fri Jun 26 21:26:02 2015 UTC,"It's definitely evident, but it seems some people think it's dominant. I love straight VA blends, but I've really started liking little bits of Burley or Oriental mixed in but not dominant."
PipeTobacco,3b7bki,DaveInPhilly,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:12:22 2015 UTC,Indeed. I prefer Renier's Golden to Dunhill Flake for that very reason.
PipeTobacco,3b7bki,tennesseean_87,2,Fri Jun 26 22:39:04 2015 UTC,That's pretty much how it goes with my palate as well. It's got to have some VA in there to sweeten and soften it.
PipeTobacco,3b7bki,ijustreadidontpost,2,Fri Jun 26 20:45:00 2015 UTC,"Man, I'm so glad to hear someone else has the same opinion on C&D burley blends. I'm fairly new to pipe smoking, so I tried a few highly-rated blends of theirs: Epiphany and Morning Drive Time. My initial impressions of both are that they're way too forward. I've come around a bit on MDT, but Epiphany I've had a difficult time going back to."
PipeTobacco,3b7bki,CHHolmes,4,Sat Jun 27 01:16:15 2015 UTC,"I learned that high ratings for burley-forward blends were from people who genuinely like burley. If you don't like burley, you are likely to find those same blends to be ""meh"". Same with latakia, perique, cigar leaf, etc. If you're like me, you'll find some blends with burley that you like, just not burley-forward stuff. I just can't stand the stuff a lot of the time."
PipeTobacco,3b7bki,tennesseean_87,3,Sat Jun 27 02:50:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed on both accounts. I don't like Dunhill's orientals. Just straight up don't like them. no amount of tweaking, twisting, and mixing is likely to change that. Folks who don't like burley aren't going to want to go anywhere near something like Epiphany."
PipeTobacco,3b7bki,BriarBoy,2,Sat Jun 27 03:02:01 2015 UTC,"I'm nowhere near experienced enough to make definitive statements about any tobacco, never mind a brand. Some day, perhaps. Agreed on Epiphany, though. It's probably not the best choice for an introduction to burley."
PipeTobacco,3b7bki,BriarBoy,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:41:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If I was going to recommend any C&D burley as a good one for beginners, it would probably be Oak Alley. The red va sweetens it up a bit, as well as some black cav. The orientals add a little more depth, and the blend of burleys themselves is fairly mild relative to some other blends. It's still a strong blend, but nothing like Old Joe or Haunted Bookshop."
PipeTobacco,3b7bki,tennesseean_87,2,Sat Jun 27 13:49:45 2015 UTC,"I'm learning the same lesson as I develop my tastes. At this point, since my smoking sense is not very refined, picking up subtle flavor profiles is not easy. It's kind of like going out to a bar or a club to meet women. When you're just starting out in the dating world, you pretty much need a girl to throw herself on top of you before you realize she's interested. As you gain a bit more wisdom and experience, you can detect subtle hints and act on them.   Epiphany pinned me to the wall and started making out with me. I'll be honest, I was a bit intimidated... I didn't expect the burley to be so aggressive."

PipeTobacco,3b7bki,tennesseean_87,3,Fri Jun 26 17:20:03 2015 UTC,I just had my first bowl of OJK today. I smoked my first of Haunted Bookshop Yesterday. I think I prefer OJK for the addition of more red VA and the Perique seemed dark fruity more than peppery.
PipeTobacco,3b7bki,antiwittgenstein,5,Fri Jun 26 16:16:45 2015 UTC,"That red VA makes all the difference, I agree.  Haunted Bookshop rarely comes out these days, though I like it to beef up my cheap aromatics for a good mindless smoke with decent nicotine."
PipeTobacco,3b7bki,bonehed,2,Fri Jun 26 16:24:29 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest difference is that white burley, too. OJK is mostly dark stuff with Red VA and perique. HB has some bright VA and white burley, making for a harsher smoke without a lot of time in the tin."
PipeTobacco,3b7bki,EvilDead58,3,Fri Jun 26 17:18:57 2015 UTC,"I think I've grown to enjoy that harsh, strong Burley flavor. When I first smoked Haunted Bookshop and Big n Burley the harshness was a little off putting,  but as I grew  accustomed  to it I became fond of those blends.   Disclaimer: I tend to like strong, bitter flavors in things such as coffee,  tobacco, and more recently unsweetened chocolate  (which I have to say, is bitter and harsh as all get out, but sugar causes a lot of problems for me so it was the only choice for trying to get a bit of chocolate!)."
PipeTobacco,3b7bki,bonehed,2,Fri Jun 26 18:05:21 2015 UTC,"Indeed. I maintain that proper aging does wonders for the acrid edge. That tends to be a byproduct of the leaf fermenting and curing. It's the reason for cigar wrapper being kept in bales or hanging for years before it's rolled. I think there's a lot of similarity between the two different strains. Just the same, I like strong burley the same way I like espresso. That dry flavor is wonderful."
PipeTobacco,3b7bki,EvilDead58,2,Fri Jun 26 18:19:34 2015 UTC,"The Big 'n' Burley I tried after a year of aging was much less harsh than I remember it being fresh. I'd still go for a bit more VA sweetness, but it was much better."

PipeTobacco,3b3q3h,jthmeffy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:08:30 2015 UTC,I can attest to that.. Even though Peter Stokkebye flakes are extremely cheap when they had a sale up I checked previous purchases and found instead of 20% off I was getting at best 5% and they had removed the MSRP. However I use them since they have the best shipping rates and have most of what I need since I don't buy any artisanal pipes nor have any B&M's around for miles
PipeTobacco,3b3q3h,jthmeffy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:45:54 2015 UTC,"For Father's Day, they put on a Savinelli bundle for $99, using the savinelli logo, calling it a ""Savinelli Rossi.""  Yes Savinelli makes Rossi pipes, but it is technically a sub brand. They are good pipes and are built to last, but calling a Rossi Vittoria ($45 on smoking pipes) as a Savinelli Branded pipe seemed a little disingenuous to me, especially when they sell them as Rossi Year round (with no name drop).  Everything in the bundle could have been had for around $65/70.  They tend to gouge, too, but what can I say about that... I'll admit I've sent them $50 in exchange for a bag of Stonehaven, so I guess I'm part of the problem ;)"

I personally try not to buy from companies that blatantly price gouge.   In fact, here are the current prices as of right now   Fuck P&C. I won't buy anything from them or CI again."
PipeTobacco,3b3q3h,philo-sopher,2,Fri Jun 26 01:08:47 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why people get bent out of shape that they charge those prices. People are willing to pay them. If they were charging too much, they'd have Penzance and Stonehaven in stock. But they don't have them in stock. That's because there are people willing to pay that much, so the market is setting the price.   The opposite of this is when a maunfacturer or retailer sells something for below the standard retail price. We call this a sale. If people have some philosophical attachment to standard retail prices such that they will demonize someone for charging more, then they should also refuse to buy items on sale and only pay full retail price.   Those are my two cents, but I'm just a nasty, bourgeois pig."
PipeTobacco,3b3q3h,philo-sopher,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:36:45 2015 UTC,Have you reached out to them to inform them about their price structure? Maybe they would change it?
PipeTobacco,3b3q3h,Turbostar66,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:33:57 2015 UTC,They are aware of what the MSRP for the products they sell are. Penzance (and most Esoterica tobaccos) is just more rare.
PipeTobacco,3b3q3h,famousdogwalker,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:49:00 2015 UTC,"Found this on another form: ""As you are certainly aware, Esoterica tobacco is extremely difficult to obtain. The perpetual shortage of Esoterica product has been forcing an increase in our cost for some time and we could no longer maintain the old price. The new $49.95 price was chosen to cover our increased costs and allow us a reasonable return on our investment in time, effort, and money used to acquire it.""  What kind of shortage would increase P&C costs? To double the price? Looks like smokingpipes and others can afford to sell it just fine at their price. Esoterica hasn't increased the price on their end. This is simply price gouging. Does anyone know if they even got stock when it was on sale a couple of months ago?"

PipeTobacco,3b4bq8,paok1234,2,Fri Jun 26 00:08:48 2015 UTC,"I think you should go with burley kake first if you only have one pipe. It has a nice vanilla flavor that you may lose if you smoke any of the Latakia blends first. Then, you should smoke Firestorm next, so you can taste the Vas and the Perique. White Knight should be next because it's a creamy Balkan with just enough Latakia to make it smokey. Black House should be last I think. I found that to have the most intense flavor of all those blends, and a bit heavier on Latakia than WK. If you smoke the Lat blends first you'll have to smoke at least 4-5 bowls of the Burley Kake to get the ghost out and be able to taste it. IMHO"

I do want to say a couple of things, though:   Any self respecting pipemaker would not have let something leave the shop like that. I can only imagine how many customers of his received subpar product and either didn't complain or didn't know about the defect in the first place.  This should not be the exception in terms of customer service. The benefit of buying from Artisans, especially those that are well-known, is that they should stand behind their work. If they don't take back a pipe when you're unhappy with something, they aren't worth your business (or anyone else's). They should not be held to a lower standard than large pipe manufacturers, especially because you're likely paying many times what a factory pipe would cost."

PipeTobacco,3b3r1d,Piffyr,3,Thu Jun 25 19:11:02 2015 UTC,Is there any danger to skipping the Magic Eraser step and just going straight to the micromesh? I've got some pretty oxidized stems and the magic eraser just isn't doing it.
PipeTobacco,3b3r1d,GWFKegel,3,Thu Jun 25 20:32:25 2015 UTC,"When I have a stem like that, I just drop it back in the Oxy bath and then go at it again with the Magic Eraser. Usually, one more bath will do the trick, but you might need one or two more depending upon how bad it is."
PipeTobacco,3b3r1d,Piffyr,2,Thu Jun 25 20:45:58 2015 UTC,I knew you'd stop by and drop some knowledge. Thanks. But what about the one that feels rough?
PipeTobacco,3b3r1d,Piffyr,2,Thu Jun 25 19:37:44 2015 UTC,"Same thing. I have that happen plenty of times before. There are different formulation of vulcanite and they each oxidize a bit differently, at least in appearance. Just treat it the same way you do the discolored ones."
PipeTobacco,3b3r1d,Dunning-Kruger-,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:08:00 2015 UTC,I'm no expert in pipe restoration and I've seen sites showing how Oxyclean can deliver but..... as a chap with some chemistry background I can tell you that Oxyclean (which is a peroxide based cleaner) doesn't 'bring oxidation to the surface' unless I am misunderstanding the use of that phrase and you mean to imply that it oxidises the surface (which is correct !)  Oxyclean is probably just oxidising the entire surface down to the same level below as the scratches/damage which means when you buff off the oxidised layer it should be smooth and level.  Perhaps more critically it is removing any stains caused by other processes by oxidising them. It's a bit like those acid peels favoured by the more extreme cosmetic-procedure ladies but much more manly of course :D
PipeTobacco,3b3r1d,Piffyr,3,Thu Jun 25 19:29:36 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the correction. Likewise, I'm no chemistry expert, but I have some experience restoring pipes. ""Bringing the oxidation to the surface"" is just a common phrase used in the circle for the process. You're right; it's technically inaccurate. It's sometimes necessary to use a bit of shorthand for the sake of brevity when the technical details aren't the meat of the matter."
PipeTobacco,3b3r1d,PipingaintEZ,3,Thu Jun 25 20:02:11 2015 UTC,"I knew it was short hand and it's a good thing to know that it's not blatant ignorance, I was a bit worried people actually thought that it raised oxidation which is basically outrageous and senseless. Oxygen adheres to the surface during the chemical process making strong bonds with the material and soft ones with dirt which is why most of it can be easily removed. DW40 is a deodorizer and degreaser which does the same for oxygen and grease. The More You Know"

PipeTobacco,3b22tr,Piffyr,2,Thu Jun 25 12:41:35 2015 UTC,"If the pipe has been well smoked like this one obviously has, you're not going to get it down to perfectly clean wood like you'd find in a new pipe without taking off material and thinning the walls. Some amount of ""blackness"" is to be expected. The chamber has been holding burning embers after all. If the pipe has been smoked hot, it may also be that the walls are charred.  Ream the pipe and lightly sand with 400-grit paper wrapped around a dowel or your fingertip to remove the cake. That's all that needs to be done. Don't do any water dunking. Ever. In general, water + wood = bad."

I certainly wouldn't trust myself to pull that off. I find, for my own projects, an oyster knife to make initial cuts, a reamer to make it even, and sandpaper to make it glass smooth works best."

They were produced by Kaywoodie from 1964 to 1971, but were made on a completely separate line from the other pipes. They were created to be a competitor to Dunhill if that tells you anything. They're sought after by collectors. So, you're not going to pick one up cheap unless you're lucky.  Also, quality standards for Dr. Grabows made from '66 - '82 were some of the highest in the country.

PipeTobacco,3b0imm,tennesseean_87,6,Thu Jun 25 00:04:15 2015 UTC,"Here's the video I recorded for your original request. Mute the audio, nothing but car noise.  EDIT: I'm adding the following details as it might help put my puffing style in perspective.  I am relative new pipe enthusiast (4 months) and only recently have I hit my stride, so to speak, when it comes to cadence. The relatively fast cadence combined with a shallow draw allows me to keep the pipe lit while eliminating any tongue burn.   I smoke almost exclusively aromatics with lots of nose but with little tobacco flavor, and which tend to the moist end of the spectrum. My habit of not knowing which tobacco I'm going to smoke until moments before I leave the house in the morning, means I don't have time for pre-drying, so my efforts are additionally compounded by having to keep sometimes overly damp tobacco lit.   The cadence and puffing style you observe is what has evolved to solve this particular set of problems. It is not necessarily ideal nor is it required if your parameters are greatly different, but it works very well for me. Given the tobaccos I smoke, I almost always make my way to the bottom of the bowl with a nice fine ash and without having to frequently dump it out or tamp it excessively.  I owe part of the secret of the success of this style to /u/BriarBoy's packing method, which is extremely loose and insanely uncomplicated."

So I went online to find his pipes later that day.  I have a problem with saying no when I find a beautiful pipe, and this one just seemed to speak to me. The pictures don't quite do it justice. The grain is tight and beautiful. The accent on the shank is redwood, and the stem is vulcanite. The airway is very well engineered.  I spoke with him for a bit and found that he got his start restoring pipes, much like myself.

PipeTobacco,3az30r,Piffyr,9,Thu Jun 25 03:33:37 2015 UTC,"Cobs are great, but they're not so much ""rugged"" as they are ""disposable"". You're not likely to cry when you have to shell out another eight bucks because you snapped it in half on the trail or dropped it into the stream, but you're also not going to have a pipe to smoke for the rest of the trip.  If you want something truly rugged, you might consider picking up a metal pipe to lug around with you. If you're in the States, you can get a brand new Falcon from 4noggins for about $50. If you don't mind gong the estate pipe route, then you can get them much cheaper than that. A nice bonus is that the briar bowls are interchangeable. So, if you want to mix 'n' match tobacco types on the trail you don't have to worry about ghosting."

PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,chewsyourownadv,3,Thu Jun 25 00:32:41 2015 UTC,It's the only thing I've been smoking in my new Savinelli. Thinking about what I should put in their next after I build up a bit more of a cake
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,sinbad-ass,5,Wed Jun 24 13:50:35 2015 UTC,"If you enjoy it and want to move on to a similar but richer blend, consider Moonshine Pipe Co. XXX. Good stuff, and a little more stout than OTB."
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,carnesy,3,Wed Jun 24 16:36:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestion! I'll have to look into that
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,carnesy,4,Wed Jun 24 16:38:35 2015 UTC,"Don't feel bad Pix, it's been either too hot, humid or rainy for me to smoke for about two weeks now. I tried having a bowl when I went to my family's beach place but the wind was blowing too much to get a decent bowl going all weekend."
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,carnesy,2,Wed Jun 24 16:43:22 2015 UTC,"That's awful. Maybe a wind cover would help you out here? We've got the house closed up and the A/C on now, so I'll have to go outside in the heat and humidity myself. I'll just have to bring a fan out with me to keep me cool and the mosquitos away."
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,carnesy,2,Wed Jun 24 15:02:39 2015 UTC,Kind of hard to find a cover big enough for a Sav 315 EX.
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,levins0,3,Thu Jun 25 00:36:00 2015 UTC,"Sav 315 EX   Looking at the chamber diameter (a little under 21mm), I would think these spring-loaded puppies would do fine. I use them in all my pipes."
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,levins0,2,Thu Jun 25 00:50:56 2015 UTC,I think you were looking at the 315 KS bowl. While my line isn't made anymore (that I can find) here's the same shape in the Hercules line that's also an EX size. That one is listed as 23.88mm and eyeballing mine with my medical tapemeasurer gives me right about 24mm across so it would seem to match.
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,PipeBeard,2,Thu Jun 25 02:21:16 2015 UTC,"Well dang. That's massive. Yeah, I can see how that might be an issue."
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,levins0,2,Thu Jun 25 04:03:21 2015 UTC,I guess I'm just a guy that likes his pipes extra wide ;)
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,antiwittgenstein,2,Thu Jun 25 04:09:58 2015 UTC,There's an inappropriate joke in there somewhere. I'll see if I can avoid it. Phew. Think I made it.
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,levins0,3,Thu Jun 25 04:17:51 2015 UTC,"I had a bowl of Hyde Park over the weekend, and a bowl of Brown Bogie that kicked my ass on Monday.  It was the first time that any tobacco levelled me with a nic hit, so it was quite a lesson.  I enjoyed the tobacco overall, and will have more, but I have to make sure I've got the time to just laze around and relax afterwards.  Thankfully, I had just eaten lunch, so no nausea, but I got quite a dizzy buzz going."
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,levins0,2,Thu Jun 25 10:00:42 2015 UTC,"I remember reading of the Brown Bogie experience. Crazy stuff, that!"
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,hedonaut,3,Wed Jun 24 13:18:07 2015 UTC,"Yup, it was a hell of a ride.  :)  This afternoon I'm going to pack some Ennerdale Flake in my ""Reserved for those Crazy Lakelands"" cob."
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,JLowU571,3,Wed Jun 24 13:36:27 2015 UTC,"Hyde Park and Ennerdale are some of my favorite blends!  I haven't had brown bogie, but have been kicked by some of the other ropes..."
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,PipeBeard,2,Wed Jun 24 16:49:38 2015 UTC,"/u/antiwittgenstein sent me some of that (I think! The bag's unlabelled and the letter is semi-packed somewhere). I haven't gotten around to it yet, but I brought it with me for this week."
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,Slamfrankel,2,Wed Jun 24 17:08:19 2015 UTC,"It's hard to mistake the smell.   :)  For me it's a mood thing. When I want that Lakeland, this is as Lakeland as it gets."
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,levins0,2,Thu Jun 25 00:33:38 2015 UTC,Close I sent you GW Brown Flake and Erinmore. The first is one of those lakeland atrocities while the latter is a damned fine burley-virginia flake. You can tell which one is Erinmore because when you smoke it you don't summon Cthulu from beyond the unspeakable portal of neverending nightmares.
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,Slamfrankel,2,Thu Jun 25 01:15:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the clarification, Antiwittgenstein. I should have realised Brown Bogie is a rope and what you sent is very obviously a flake, so it can't be the same thing. I'll be giving the Poison bag a taste very soon. Can't wait. :) I love a challenge."
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,scopawl,2,Thu Jun 25 03:25:32 2015 UTC,"I thought you were referring to the Ennerdale I mentioned (which is a flake).  It's easy to mistake that name with Erinmore, which I've done.  Once you smell Ennerdale, though, you would never mistake it for anything but Ennerdale.  It's like dunking your nose in a bottle of softsoap.  :)  As for the Brown Bogie rope, I actually found the lakeland essence was barely there.  It was noticeable, but only just, unlike the Ennerdale which hits you on the head with a sledgehammer (full of softsoap!)."
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,flaggman,2,Thu Jun 25 03:35:09 2015 UTC,"Hehehe -- atrocities.  :)  It's definitely a bit of an acquired taste.  And yes, Erinmore is good stuff."
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,CaptainDickPuncher,4,Thu Jun 25 16:24:36 2015 UTC,"This week, I popped the seal on a 1lb tin of Old Joe Krantz. Tin date was 02/02/10, making it over 5 years old. It's incredible. Sweet and tangy, yet dry and spicy at the same time, and so very very smooth. The burleys have picked up this background note that reminds me of a lot of the Gawith burleys I love like Dark Flake Unscented. Absolutely amazing stuff. I've also been enjoying some Solani 633 when I need something lighter as a break. Also really incredible stuff, and I'm bulking up my cellar with it."
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,Mordenkrad,2,Thu Jun 25 16:22:34 2015 UTC,I've yet to meet a Solani blend that I didn't enjoy.

It goes with coffee terrifically. Tonight it might be some C&D Oak Alley out of my new Nording mini Zulu. This tobacco is awesome! And i cant wait to see what its like  with a bit of age :)
PipeTobacco,3ay4gh,mutantturkey,3,Wed Jun 24 13:35:54 2015 UTC,"I finally tried Elizabethan recently, along with their de Luxe Navy Rolls.

PipeTobacco,3ayf3u,chewsyourownadv,4,Wed Jun 24 14:34:43 2015 UTC,"I'm digging Three Friars, any and all Burley suggestions are welcomed"
PipeTobacco,3ayf3u,BWeice,5,Wed Jun 24 14:52:41 2015 UTC,"Me too! In addition to that, C&D Old Joe Krantz is a pretty stout burley-forward blend. It's a bit stronger than 3 Friars.  I know some people will also recommend Haunted Bookshop, but it's a bit too throat-punchy for me.  Last, to change it up a bit maybe consider Epiphany. It's still a burley-forward-ish blend, though not so blatant as the others."
PipeTobacco,3ayf3u,BWeice,3,Wed Jun 24 15:00:55 2015 UTC,Haunted Bookshop is on the top of my list on blends to try ever since I heard Matches860 and Public Piper give it good praise. There's been a number of instances where Old Joe Krantz made it into my cart but I never followed through on it.. but these are all good suggestions. Thank you!
PipeTobacco,3ayf3u,CaptainDickPuncher,3,Wed Jun 24 15:21:15 2015 UTC,I picked up Haunted Bookshop at the same time that I picked up some Three Friars and it's really good. Much bigger Nic hit than Three Friars so sip it slow and it's a dryer tobacco and super dry smoke.   It's got more of that great C&D Burley nuttiness with a bit of spice from the perique.  I also picked it up because Matches860 likes it so much and I don't regret it.
PipeTobacco,3ayf3u,BWeice,2,Wed Jun 24 15:31:11 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I felt Three Friars kick me in the head a little.. Thanks for the warning I will proceed with caution haha"
PipeTobacco,3ayf3u,CaptainDickPuncher,3,Wed Jun 24 15:36:43 2015 UTC,Just take it slow and use a small bowl and you should be fine. But don't expect to handle complex math problems during or afterwards.
PipeTobacco,3ayf3u,hedonaut,3,Wed Jun 24 15:41:48 2015 UTC,"Same with Old Joe Krantz. Have some food first, and consider it your last smoke of the day. :)"

PipeTobacco,3ayf3u,hedonaut,2,Wed Jun 24 16:33:55 2015 UTC,"Too late, I traded the Haunted Bookshop you sent me. I really like everything else you traded in, though. I just smoked two bowls of Haunted Bookshop and could deal with it. Old Joe Krantz should age pretty similarly though."
PipeTobacco,3ayf3u,hedonaut,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:42:56 2015 UTC,"No doubt, and that's no problem. If I can find some of my aged stuff I'll pass some along. Old Joe is awesome old. It actually gets a little sweet."
PipeTobacco,3ayf3u,liams_dad,2,Wed Jun 24 16:47:28 2015 UTC,"Hehe, as long as you're ok with it being something along the lines of casting a pearl before swine, I'll happily try it!  And, yeah, Old Joe is gonna get old in my collection. I don't usually go for stout blends like that, so he'll last a while."
PipeTobacco,3ayf3u,tennesseean_87,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:50:21 2015 UTC,"I kind of live on the stout stuff. A blow of Hamborger Veermaster here and there is lovely, but my first smoke of the day tends to be in the realm of Three Friars or Sixpence and it goes stronger form there."
PipeTobacco,3ayf3u,BWeice,2,Wed Jun 24 17:03:52 2015 UTC,"I'm breaking the new Warren poker with 3 Friars right now. I usually hate break-in smokes, but 3 Friars is making it nice. More or less."
PipeTobacco,3ayf3u,boomer56,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:29:48 2015 UTC,Sweet deal. 3F and HB tend to be my default break in smokes.
PipeTobacco,3ayf3u,hedonaut,4,Thu Jun 25 11:23:25 2015 UTC,Solani Aged Burley Flake is my favorite burley.
PipeTobacco,3ayf3u,boomer56,2,Wed Jun 24 16:33:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe I just need to smoke more of it, but 3F came off as more VAPer w/ some Burley thrown in to me. I found it much sweeter than C&D Burley blends like Epiphany, Burley Flake #4, Pegasus, and Big 'n' Burley. Of those I've tried, Pegasus was my favorite, probably because it had the most VA sweetness, though it was still Burley forward. Burley Flake #4 was great, too. Sometimes the others were so earth and dry that they bordered on harshness."
PipeTobacco,3ayf3u,PipeBeard,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:51:28 2015 UTC,"You're most likely right, but this being my first blend with Burley in it I found that I like it and don't really have anything in my stash with burley in them. Burley Flake #4 was something I took a few glances at I will be sure to try it. Thank you!"

PipeTobacco,3ayf3u,hedonaut,2,Wed Jun 24 21:10:07 2015 UTC,"I also love Commonwealth. Sadly, I recommend Penzance (hard to come by).  Keep an eye out for it, but in the meantime, I'd say to give Brebbia Latakia Flake no 9 a go."
PipeTobacco,3ayf3u,tennesseean_87,2,Wed Jun 24 17:04:38 2015 UTC,"I'm coming back to the hobby after a decade off, and actually remember when Esoterica distributed tobacco to stores rather than strapping it to a unicorn and releasing it into the wild.

PipeTobacco,3ayf3u,hedonaut,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:14:32 2015 UTC,I've gotten some in a B&M. I asked if they had any and they said they grab me some Penzance from their distributor next time it became available.
PipeTobacco,3ayf3u,tennesseean_87,3,Thu Jun 25 02:48:21 2015 UTC,"Sixpence. I've been averaging a bowl a day lately. It has just enough Dark Fired and strength to be really interesting, but not enough to be bitter or hard on the palate. Any suggestions?"
PipeTobacco,3ayf3u,daneelthesane,2,Wed Jun 24 16:35:06 2015 UTC,"I can't recommend another VaPer with that little hint of Kentucky... but, it did actually remind me of Sextant for similar reasons.

PipeTobacco,3ayf3u,tennesseean_87,2,Wed Jun 24 16:48:38 2015 UTC,"GH&Co. Brown Flake Unscented has a smidge of burley and a hint of dark-fired. Maybe less than Sixpence. It has a different flavor, but if you like SG BBF (those Gawiths have a way with VAs that is a bit distinct), it's sorta similar but with those added ingredients. Maybe it's worth a shot."

It's Burley based, but with just a hint of Latakia and maybe a light vanilaa or chocolate topping. I smoked it while reading LOTR a few years ago, so maybe that's part of the reason I'm making the association, but I think it sounds similar enough to the descriptions of STM I've read."

This is why i use olivewood from my department (Drôme/France) boxwood is also a wood which grow in every forest around my house, and bamboo come from edges of my locality. I posted a tutorial (in french) showing how i was working (some mounths ago, my way to do vary a little, but, it's quite the same) Tools used are a drill press, a belt/disk sander, and a radial saw (and a lot of sandpapers :D ). i'm using tim west bowl spade bits. For this pipe i made a tenon out of bamboo, and glue it inside the stem. (most of time, i do the tenon on the bamboo of the stem, but my new way to do allows me to have a stronger mortise on my pipe. tutorial : http://www.metabricoleur.com/t8171-pas-a-pas-fabrication-d-une-pipe-en-buis-bambou-cade (use Gtranslate if needed) Don't saying too much at the beginning allows to have good questions to answer ;) Do you need more informations ?"

PipeTobacco,3awiso,TheWierdAsianKid,5,Wed Jun 24 01:52:29 2015 UTC,"Have you checked our ""Our wiki"" yet? In the firsst section ""For Beginners"" it has a section on the types of tobaccos and recommendations for each of the types.  The recommendations are from polling the readership here, so they represent blends that have a consensus of support, not just one guy's favorites.  Please note that aromatics are constantly being released, so there is always a lag between any list and the hot new blends, such a BRM.  Two years ago I think the new hot one was Molte Dolce.  But some of the listings are going to have been around for a long long time like Lanes 1Q or BCA, of which tons have been smoked over the years, and continue to be smoked.  MacBarens has some in this category too, like their Vanilla Cream, etc."

PipeTobacco,3awiso,blenheim45,3,Wed Jun 24 04:44:18 2015 UTC,"nothing wrong with that... ""real time opinions"", but realize that the recommendations will only reflect the opinions of whoever is on line tonight and sees your question.  The poll results reflect a wider cross section,and they are updated periodically.  the Wiki is also at the top of the front page, so that folks accessing on their phones don't have to scroll forever to find it.  it will not answer all of your questions, but it will move you up the ladder and get you to more advanced questions.

In my own case as a bit of a lat-hound, one of my faves does not make the list.  I think primarily because it is not that widely distributed and therefor not well known.  But I have no argument with the ones on the Wiki list, and some of those I see recommended by others are not where I suggest people start their journey into Lat.-Land.

PipeTobacco,3awiso,blenheim45,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:36:43 2015 UTC,"so, which are your favorite latakia blends?"
PipeTobacco,3awiso,_hlidskjalf,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:16:23 2015 UTC,"One that get's overlooked is Arango's Balkan Supreme.  It is a bulk which Smokingpipes.com sells for $31.54 a pound (!!!) and I love it.  Arango is known for their cigars, and distributes a number of tinned tobaccos from off shore, but this is the only pipe tobacco I know of sold under their name.  it won the vote at the Chicago Pipe Show (2014) for ""Best English Blend"" against some stiff competition. I really like Balkan Blue from McClellands, Squadron Leader by SG, Balkan Saseni (when it has some age on the tin)  And Dunhill London Mixture when aged.  And their are lots more C&D's Epiphany (a clone of the long discontinued Einstein favorite Revelation), which is a laid back Middle of the road, I can smoke it all day, bowl after bowl blend.  On the other hand, while I like Pirate Kake from C&D, at 75% latakia, I can't picture myself tapping out the spent bowl and reloading for an immediate re-bout.     Unlike a lot of Lat. smokers i am not in love with the Frog.  it's nice, but to me not exciting, strictly MotR for my taste.  Don't like McBaren's latakia Blend, but like almost anything which  they have put out under the HH lable, including Latakia Flake and Vintage Syrian.  To my taste buds latakia blends come in two sorts.  There are the sitting in the library, sipping on a bit of brandy or a good bourbon,  perhaps enjoying a good book with clouds of smoke creamy latakia blends.  And there are the rosy cheeks, stamping about in the bush, on a Fall afternoon with your shotgun over your arm (I am not a hunter but i can buy into the image) rougher and rowdier latakia blends [Altadis/Sutliff ""Count Pulaski"" bulk blend comes to mind.  CP has been sold under various local names in B&M stores across the nation.  ]  I tend to like the smoother creamier version most times.. but their are times when blends with a bit more edge to it  is just right.

Hope you enjoy the read, the whole thing is worth  reading, but I find the Arcadia blend chapter just nails the dream of a lot of us pipe smokers, to find that one true holy blend that always satisfies and through its satisfaction makes us better people.  In case you don't make the connection the author J.M. Barrie is the same fellow who wrote Peter Pan among other things, and at least one of the characters in the group in the story would have been his friend A. C. Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes tales.  and Dr. John Watson smoked... Arcadia blend.  A.A. Milne would have been part of the pipe smoking group too, yes the author of Winnie the Pooh."

Also similar in tastes to Cult's BRM, but more of a mixed berry taste, is Missouri Meerschaums Independence Day. Or if you're looking for a good cheap option in a chocolate/caramel variety there is Great Dane also by Missouri Meer at $4 for a 1.5 ounce pouch (currently back ordered though).  For vanilla I'd go with Vanilla Cream by Mac Baren, if you're a newer smoker get the round tin of ready rubbed rather than the flake.  That should be sufficient to induce a case of TAD."

I am assuming since you have the LotR reference you do not want a cob warden, but some briar from the shire for your new ""hobbit"".  There are no good cheap briar church wardens that I can recommend, certainly nothing in the $20 range.  It is barely conceivable that you might find one at the $50 range, but I expect that $70 is more likely to get a good smoke.  However... there is the alternative of getting a decent estate bent briar and having a church warden stem made for it.  You don't even require one with an existing functional stem, which should bring the price down a bunch.  I would suggest a 1/8 to 1/4 bent pipe."

PipeTobacco,3awk7q,blb977,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:42:26 2015 UTC,"No, the cob is ""inexpensive"".  ""Cheap"" is an altogether different thing, and in pipes it can be downright frightening.  Like pipes made out inappropriate materials, such as rosewood or black walnut.  Both are beautiful and much cheaper than briar and easier to work.  Both are also sensitizing allergens which is not something you want to heat up with a fire and suck into your mouth, throat, and nose ( and God forbid your lungs).  Think of smoking something like poison ivy, which gets more reaction with every exposure.  Yes a cob will do, or one of the fruit woods, like pear, which we see in a lot of Ukrainian and Polish pipes."

That alternative of getting  a stemless but otherwise solid briar and re-stemming it with a churchwarden length stem  would be quite ""economical"" approach btw."

I'm not sure I follow your meaning by 'funneling one of the airways'. Would you mind clarifying for me?"
PipeTobacco,3aupwp,blenheim45,2,Tue Jun 23 20:19:22 2015 UTC,"Way too soon to try something that radical!  This is not a typical problem with Brigham pipes, either with or without the filter (take it from a fellow with over 20 of them). A visual inspection may tell you something about the shank portion, but with that bend the stem looking is not going to work.  Most likely problem is some sort of constriction or obstruction, and it doesn't take much.  i have seen it arise from a bit of fluff from a pipe cleaner  getting caught and then catching fluids and building up a restriction, or even a stray bit of tobacco.  Take a 1/8"" drill bit, insert it down the shank (gently) and see if you can see it appear at the bottom of the bowl.  If you find the entry hole but  are not see the metal bit turn it by hand and see if it will ease into the bottom of the bowl. [Do be careful, unlike the one that comes with the Senior Reamer, your drill bit is made to drill and has a sharpened tip, and you do not want to cut into the bottom of the bowl.] When you pull the bit out you will probably see the tar slightly solidified in the bit's threads.  You can check to see how it looks by looking down the shank while shining a flashlight down into the bowl.. usually.  Now follow up with your bristled pipe cleaner dipped in alcohol (the higher per cent alcohol the better, we are using it as a solvent, not as an intoxicant).  Take care to clean out the bowl at this point to as if there was any build up some of it will have been pushed out into the bottom of the bowl.  On the stem you both have to clear the airway at the mouth end AND you have to clear out the area where the filter should have been, and that is larger than any pipe cleaner.  Try swabbing with a alcohol on a q-tip and then a doubled up pipe cleaner so you get pressure on the whole of the wider space.  only do the mouth end at last and i always work away from the mouth end and down to the tenon. [Why pull any dirt towards my mouth? Yech!]  Please do not mess around with internal construction of your pipe.  If these procedures do not help send a note to Brigham (either in Canada or in the US) and let them figure out what is wrong. I can almost guarantee you they will not look favorably at correcting a problem if they think it could have resulted from you trying to ""modify"" the pipe."
PipeTobacco,3aupwp,tennesseean_87,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:25:28 2015 UTC,I meant something like countersinking the holes in the mortise and tenon. But this still wouldn't explain why the problem got any worse.
PipeTobacco,3aupwp,Alligator_Gar,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:06:57 2015 UTC,I would still suspect tar build up. I use a squared-off bamboo skewer to gently push gunk away from the walls of the airways.

Lots of great starter info there including the Pipeman's Handbook, and the Wiki in the menubar at the top of the page (I think there's a sidebar link, too).   Saturdays we have a thread called Piper's University (it's stickied at the moment) where you can ask all those little questions you may feel are small, a little newbish or maybe just need a single reply or two to get you on the right path.   As for the question about drying, sit it out on a paper towel, some paper or something else for 20 minutes or so. The tobacco shouldn't stick together when pinched, nor should it crumble. Springy but not sticky is the goal."

Read about each type of tobacco flavor profile and characteristic. Then look at the sidebar and get/trade a tin from each of the categories - aromatic, English, VaPer, Va. Decide what you like or don't like from each blend. Do you like the smokiness, the sweetness, the nuttiness, the spiciness, etc? Then, search and find blends that have the type of tobacco with the flavors you like. You can either buy those blends or, you can trade them at r/pipetobaccomarket. Maybe you can ask for some samples. Smoke what you like, like what you smoke!"

I have several that I have picked up over the years, the only real drawback is that they do not come in the smaller sizes to my knowledge.  If your rubber seal just sits there it may well be one size too large.  In addition to the usual sources like hardware and supermarkets, check also craft stores as this style is often used for decoration, storing pasta and dried beans, etc. and for things like ""wedding"" decorations.  [Don't ask me, I just know i have come across the references...?]  The medium to larger sizes can often be found in my area in places like thrift stores in the kitchen stuff."

PipeTobacco,3aq82v,Elle_se_sent_seul,3,Mon Jun 22 17:02:59 2015 UTC,Just got it in the mail. Some Seattle Pipe Club Potlatch and some Deception Pass (for the new pipe) and a Peterson Royal Irish straight apple. I have around a dozen Petersons and this is one of the best I've seen. Their higher end pipes smoke great and have great workmanship. No off center drills or any of that nonsense.   I'll try and make a review of Potlatch soon. I also been needing to finish up my review of Squadron Leader Special Edition as I'm almost done with the tin as well as a review of the Reddit POTY (which is great and such a bargain).

PipeTobacco,3as6uj,Forence,6,Tue Jun 23 02:11:06 2015 UTC,"My favorite pipe would honestly be my Missouri Meerschaum County Gentleman; I smoke whatever through it on any occasion My favorite bacco is Dunhill's My Mixture 965, It has a smokiness to it that I really enjoy on a cold/winters day. It has a nice strong flavor that let's you know your smoking something with just enough nicotine to keep you alert and not dizzy. Actually today I just found out 3 Friars from C&D has a weird smell in the bag/tin than it does when you smoke it. The tin smell I can't explain but it's just nowhere near the good cup of black coffee taste it has once lit and smoking. Very surprising. I smoke a pipe sporadically throughout the week sometimes twice in a day most of the time once. I usually smoke either in the middle of the day around 2-3 pm or around midnight, my ritual being going outside and seeing how humid it is and if I really want to be out there baking haha. I sit in the shade or walk around the block just taking in my surroundings while deep in thought about everything going on in the world which gets scary but makes for a good smoke! I very much prefer being alone while smoking. I bring a pipe over to a friends every now and again but I'm too distracted I feel to enjoy the pipe, it's strange I need to be distracted by myself rather than others otherwise I rush through the bowl or just not notice it's flavors and I feel it's wasted. If we have a lull in our conversation and we all just veg out in our own thoughts than it's a good smoke, its weird."
PipeTobacco,3as6uj,BWeice,3,Tue Jun 23 02:37:35 2015 UTC,"• My favorite pipe is my Peterson 86 Irish Made Army. My girlfriend saw me holding it in a shop and handed me the money to get.. She is actually from Ireland so that may be another reason it is so special to me! Virginias and VaPers are the primarily the only thing i will smoke out of it.   • My favorite blend is Hearth & Homes Signature Classic Anniversary Kake. It's a VaPer and  is by far my favorite blend. The smell, the taste, the memories attached to them. This is just a very special tobacco to me. I smoke this stuff all over the place. Wherever the mood strikes!  • The blend that really through me for a lood was McClelland's Darkstar. The tin note smells like ketchup but when its lit, it tastes like burning sugar. Hot and sweet.. I have found that leaving this tobacco out to dry for a week or more will greatly increase the quality of the smoking experience.      • Other than in the morning with my coffee, there is no ritual time for me. On most days, i will smoke 2-3 bowls but somedays it will be more or less. I enjoy reading a book or watching a good movie when I smoke but often i will just sit in my backyard and think to myself while puffing away.  • Being that i have no pipe smoking friends i tend to smoke alone.. Sometimes i prefer to be alone with my thoughts and my pipe though. Occasionally my girlfriend will come sit with me outside while i smoke but she will never partake."
PipeTobacco,3as6uj,Slamfrankel,3,Tue Jun 23 03:21:04 2015 UTC,"i don't have just one favorite, but usually when pressed list My partially rusticated Karl Erik ""Egg"" as one of my most favorite pipes.

(Bought from /u/soymilkisgood).  Beautiful shape, great smoker.  But I love pipes, a lot of different pipes lure me with their shape, lore and history.  From the very expensive artisan pipes I don't have, to the functional Grabows and Kaywoodies that still sing of peaceful evenings enjoying the untold varieties of tobacco leaf.   If I must pick one...  I'm going with the humble 5100 Red Cake.  Inexpensive, but complex, versatile and consistently enjoyable.  It's hard to pick just one, because different moods and pipes call, for different tobacco. No good answer. Sporadically.  Sometimes I don't get a chance for days, other times I smoke as many as 3 bowls the same day.   Yes!  I like smoking as a social experience, or a contemplative activity.  Sometimes it's a great way to get some alone time and recharge, and other times I like to talk and socialize.  Usually I am the only one smoking pipe tobacco.  The one thing is, it's a quieter experience, it doesn't fit well with loud groups or energetic activities."
PipeTobacco,3as6uj,tochrais,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:37:05 2015 UTC,"My favorite pipe is my bent billiard basket pipe. It was my first pipe given to me by a friend. And my Savinelli Tortuga that my wife got me for our anniversary (along with a bent bulldog for the same reason). And my MM Legends, because they keep me company on the drive to work and back. I like an english blend with my coffee on my way to work. So far, Dunhill Nightcap. A bowl of that with some dark coffee gives me a good kick to start my night. My pallet is pretty bad but usually aromatics in general are what I notice this with. Smells like cherry? Tastes like hot air to me.  Almost every day. I get in the car, light my pipe, and off I go. An hour later I'm at work and my bowl is finished. In the morning it's the same thing but I'm smoking a different tobacco and driving the other direction.  I don't have many opportunities to smoke socially so I prefer alone. I get really self conscious smoking around other people and it ruins the experience for me.   Fun post by the way!"
PipeTobacco,3as6uj,PipeBeard,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:37:00 2015 UTC,"Radice radice bent apple.  I posted it about a week ago in the ""what's your favorite pipe"" thread, so I know I'm going to get yelled at by the twitter bot, but I'm not at home to take another pic.  This is dedicated to my favorite blend(s) of all time: Firedance Flake and Best Brown.  Because of the Firedance ghost, Best Brown alone sometimes tastes like Firedance light :) Firedance Flake and Best Brown.  Firedance Flake is Best Brown Flake topped with blackberry brandy.  There are a number of others on my short list of favorites, but this one takes the cake.  A lot of people consider it to be an aromatic, and I'll go along with that, because of the topping, but it is an English aromatic, which means something quite different.  When I think aromatic, I think aroma first.  Oddly, if I find anything lacking with Firedance, it's the aroma.  I enjoy a good mustache note, and this one doesn't leave the aroma of firedance; its more cigaretty than anything, but the flavor is anything but, and I'll take that any day (but don't tell my wife I said that).  Many Gawith blends originate from a time when there were English purity laws that meant that tobacco flavoring had to be all natural.  Their aromatic blends do not have the sickly sweet smelling, hot burning mess that a lot of other aros suffer from.  With Firedance, you get all of the high quality VA from the best brown and natural tasting blackberry.  Something about it just hits me right.  I've already written my review for July 1 ;) Probably 1792 Flake.  The smell in the tin is of earth and cocoa and the flavor is like a fine maduro cigar. I love the stuff, but it's way to strong for me to smoke a full flake at a time. Daily, sometimes twice or three times a day.  The steady pipe comes around 8 pm, which is right around the time the kids go to bed.  It's a perfect way to unwind the day.  I am always either reading or writing (sometimes redditing, depending on the mood) when I smoke.  If I really get into something, and haven't had my nic fill, I'll pack another, and then sometimes another. Yes.  Most days it works out that I smoke alone, and in fact, a lot of times, that is my 'mindful meditation'.  I usually try to turn my phone to airplane mode (I write/read on my phone, or I would nix it altogether).  But then there are times when it is nice to smoke socially, especially pipes.   A lot of times the friends/family I hang with will vape while I smoke, but a few of them have pipes and are always interested in trying new blends I get.  Both have their place for me."

You guys always have wonderful libations with your pipes on these videos. I was thinking that a flagon would be interesting, because it could have a way to snap the leather to it for easy carrying. Of course, something like that would probably be pricey, but just thinking about a metal and leather drinking doodad with pipe paraphernalia sounds cool.

PipeTobacco,3aq6h4,notastalka,2,Mon Jun 22 17:54:27 2015 UTC,Probably red Virginia in the mix.
PipeTobacco,3aq6h4,cungor,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:27:22 2015 UTC,That's exactly what i thought! Have you tried this stuff yet?
PipeTobacco,3aq6h4,pylorns,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:28:58 2015 UTC,"Nope, never even heard of it. Unfortunately, I'm not super well-versed in pre-made blends, especially those really fancy ones that come in tins and such (too expensive and I smoke too much), but I've had a lot of fun playing around and making my own blends, and red Virginia is definitely one of the more unique tobaccos."
PipeTobacco,3aqsrb,BWeice,4,Mon Jun 22 19:28:12 2015 UTC,I've been singing the praises of 3 Friars since I got the ounce I ordered. It's really nice stuff.
PipeTobacco,3aqsrb,CaptainDickPuncher,3,Mon Jun 22 21:25:09 2015 UTC,I tried it fresh in a cob and dried out in a meer. It did well fresh in the cob a light vanilla aro with a decent Va backbone is what it came across to me as. Dried out in the meer it was pretty much hot air. The blend is a bit finicky but really pleasant if you get the moisture and cadence down just right.
PipeTobacco,3aqsrb,PhysicsNovice,2,Mon Jun 22 21:57:23 2015 UTC,"I thought I was tasting the rum I had used to clean my pipe with when I got a hint of vanilla, glad to hear you picked up on that also."
PipeTobacco,3aqsrb,tennesseean_87,3,Mon Jun 22 22:30:21 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed 3 Friars, but found it to be more VA forward in taste. The C&D Burleys tend to be much less sweet and have a deep earthy characteristic. I've only had a few bowls of my 4 oz sample of 3F, though. I did enjoy it a lot, though.   Can one of the C&D guys tell us if it's more VA forward or Burley forward in proportion?"

PipeTobacco,3apfw5,Alligator_Gar,2,Tue Jun 23 03:18:08 2015 UTC,It's funny.  I look at a collection of hard used pipes and I want to make them beautiful again.  Need to figure out where to buy lots of that sort.
PipeTobacco,3apfw5,mile_high_me,2,Tue Jun 23 03:55:00 2015 UTC,I am exactly the same way. Strange thing is I have absolutely no desire to carve my own. There is just something about making something new again after seeing it in such bad shape that appeals to something inside me. I like looking at a filthy disgusting pipe and wondering what beauty might be hiding underneath all the filth. Or even better is seeing a pipe I'm familiar with and knowing whats there and doing the work to make it look like the maker of the pipe intended. I've always been more of a fixer than a creator I guess.

PipeTobacco,3apfw5,thekiltedpiper,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:34:08 2015 UTC,Just a shot in the dark. Gbd pipes have a brass rondel they put right about there on their pipes. I was just curious. Any other markings on the pipe?

PipeTobacco,3amp5k,r33det,14,Sun Jun 21 19:04:29 2015 UTC,"I have played with a lot of 3D printers and I am I'm intrigued. PLA is a corn-based food grade plastic, but not very high temp and not terribly durable. ABS is better, but I wouldn't want to use it as a pipe, because styrenes are no joke; at least according to OSHA. HIPS is technically food safe, more durable, and high-ish temp but it is still a polystyrene.  It's a neat idea, but I wouldn't smoke a 3D printed pipe even with a briar sleeve. The plastic will still give off fumes if it reaches its glass transition temperature."
PipeTobacco,3amp5k,lightningserpent,3,Sun Jun 21 20:56:36 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to think of a design that would be safe. Maybe if it had not only a meer/briar bowl, but also a meer/briar part that filled the shank and screwed into the bowl so that the internal part was totally sealed off from the plastic. Or maybe they're 3d printing a material that is safe but unavailable to us normal 3d printing peasants.  Edit: Looked at the page and that's what they claim. Briar insert in the bowl and stem with an acrylic mouthpiece.

PipeTobacco,3amp5k,ahedderly,2,Mon Jun 22 03:28:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is fused filament printing. Using a thermoplastic would probably not go too well. I'm guessing it's some form of laser cured resin, probably SLA."
PipeTobacco,3amp5k,gardvar,2,Mon Jun 22 06:12:04 2015 UTC,All printing processes including SLS and SLA will have MSDS sheets for the materials that are used. I encourage anyone that is considering purchasing this pipe that they find out what material it is made out of consult the MSDS about that material.   A second thing to consider is the finishing process. Regarding SLA the process usually involves recommendations to use tripropylene glycol; isopropyl alcohol; a “chemical bath”; or a solution with caustic soda (lye and sodium hydroxide). Several of these things make me uncomfortable regarding my lungs. I would be interested to hear from the company on their process.
PipeTobacco,3amp5k,lightningserpent,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:15:27 2015 UTC,I wonder if we could get a 3D printer to handle some of Yello-Bole's Brylon.
PipeTobacco,3amp5k,hedonaut,2,Mon Jun 22 13:51:01 2015 UTC,"I've built a printer that can print various nylons at ~260°C. If you can get it in a filament form with a consistent diameter of 1.75mm or 3mm and it has a glass transition temperature below 275°C then I would say ""maybe"".  Impurities can cause issues with extrusion. There are a number of ways to make filament, but: http://www.filastruder.com  Should give you an idea of what it takes to make filament.   If someone is considering building a printer I suggest building a delta/rostock printer. They take a little bit more work to configure, but it is well worth it. A moving Y-axis of the mendel style bots is easy to build, but is a constant challenge. I've done both style styles, several iterations of each, and the delta bots seem to have less printing problems every time."

I had been eyeing some Rattrays (I like classic shapes and love my Rattray's Celtic) but then visited Oldrich Jirsa's website and found a perfectly proportioned Billard. After a few days of hesitation I gave in and ordered and today a package from the Czech Republic arrived.   What can I say, this pipe is a beauty! Delicate but not flimsy, well made and exactly how I imagined it. I just had an inaugural smoke with some Solani Aged Burley Flake, and it smokes perfectly.

Copper: More subtle vanilla than any other Captain Black but very nice. I like it; it's a winner in my book.  The Nording is cute and is a small ""Zulu."" It's going to be a great travel pipe.

I'll break it down for you.   DRY YOUR TOBACCO. Place stem in mouth in a comfortable spot and close your lips. With your mouth closed, just breath slowly through your nose. It doesn't need to be deep breaths, just slow and steady ones. Relax.  Wait for your mouth to fill with smoke slowly drawing in, when it does, open your lips to let the smoke escape but don't exhale or blow the smoke. Repeat this process.   Your mouth forms a natural vacuum when it's closed and you're breathing through your nose, that vacuum just to happens to be the perfect cadence for most aromatics."
PipeTobacco,3an865,shavinghobbit,2,Sun Jun 21 22:14:24 2015 UTC,Okay. Thanks for the tip! I'll defiantly give this a try when I light up one later tonight. I guess it does make sense considering the whole tasting through the nose thing as well.
PipeTobacco,3an865,liams_dad,2,Sun Jun 21 22:43:19 2015 UTC,"I'm on my phone, smoking a pipe and just saw this. After trying it, I have to say that you may have just changed everything for me"

PipeTobacco,3an865,Crowifa,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:19:11 2015 UTC,What are the characteristics of a burley?
PipeTobacco,3an865,tennesseean_87,2,Mon Jun 22 21:46:46 2015 UTC,Burley's have a nutty flavor to them. Many OTC blends are burley forward. The Classic Burley Kake is a burley with a cocoa flavor added.

PipeTobacco,3aml1i,PerspicaciousPiper,3,Sun Jun 21 18:29:02 2015 UTC,Was there any actual markings showing it was silver? My bet...pewter...
PipeTobacco,3aml1i,SupraMario,3,Sun Jun 21 20:28:26 2015 UTC,"I honestly didn't get that close of a look, I plan on going in tomorrow to take a closer look at it."
PipeTobacco,3aml1i,SupraMario,3,Sun Jun 21 20:38:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah that will give a better indication, a lot of people don't know the difference between the two."
PipeTobacco,3aml1i,SupraMario,3,Sun Jun 21 20:51:01 2015 UTC,What should I look for in order to make the determination as to whether or not it is pewter? I have seen pewter tankards and such before and the differences seem to be quite obvious. I wasn't aware that there were instances in which the differences would be hard to discern.  Edit: I should also note that the silver portion did seem to be tarnished and it has been my understanding the pewter will not do this.
PipeTobacco,3aml1i,BriarBoy,2,Sun Jun 21 21:28:29 2015 UTC,"Pewter won't tarnish but it will grey, silver will get that greenish grey look. If it's plated silver its going to have more than likey pewter under it. Your number one thing is a purity stamp if its silver."
PipeTobacco,3alz1e,WafflesHouse,2,Sun Jun 21 15:06:46 2015 UTC,"The 73 is more than likely their code for the pipe shape rather than the year. I could be wrong as there are a few makers who stamp the year of production on their pipes, but usually it's just the shape ID."
PipeTobacco,3alz1e,carnesy,2,Sun Jun 21 15:42:49 2015 UTC,"Okay cool. Pipedia says Danmore only made pipes from 70s to 80s, so I thought it might be a year thing. Thanks for your time :]"

Typically that means I ship a day or two late and feel bad so I give extras. Most of the time it is a small amount of tobacco. But in your case, I thought I'd send a ""welcome to the club"" package to another pipe restorer. I hope your pipe smokes as great as my very closely related Il Ceppo does."

I picked up a few cobs and a couple estates. One was a nice 1931-1932 Kaywoodie. Those 4 digit ones smoke so amazing and it has nice grain. The other an Amphora that has some amazing birds eye. Just needs cleaned up.   I almost pulled the trigger on one of the 4 digit Kaywoodie churchwardens. I'm bummed I couldn't stay for the dinner and the clinic tonight."
PipeTobacco,3aijp0,lunchboxweld,6,Sat Jun 20 15:02:27 2015 UTC,Do I really need more than one pipe? I smoke mostly aromatics and haven't noticed a difference in flavors.
PipeTobacco,3aijp0,blenheim45,10,Sat Jun 20 17:30:04 2015 UTC,"NO...but it is a hell of an explanation for the bitter half why you have several dozen pipes around. :-) ""Well dear the pipes need to rest after smoking, and I have different types of tobacco and to get the best taste out of them I smoke them in different pipes, it just works better this way.  And I spend a whole lot less on tobacco and pipes than i ever did on cigarettes, and all you ended up with there were dirty ashtrays.""  It helps that she knows I buy estates and have sold a few for a significant better price than i paid for them. LOL  I would suggest though that you pick up a second pipe even if it is just a cob, just in case..."
PipeTobacco,3aijp0,levins0,6,Sun Jun 21 00:31:20 2015 UTC,"""Bitter half"" is a really funny typo/autocorrect in this context. Just sayin'."

PipeTobacco,3aijp0,Mordenkrad,3,Sun Jun 21 03:48:35 2015 UTC,If you don't notice the difference then don't worry about it.
PipeTobacco,3aijp0,kingofjax,3,Sat Jun 20 18:41:37 2015 UTC,"It depends on how often you smoke. Briar needs a cool down period. If you smoke a couple bowls a day, every day, the briar can crack or burn out inside the bowl. If you just smoke a bowl once or twice a week, I wouldn't worry about it."

PipeTobacco,3aijp0,kingofjax,3,Sat Jun 20 21:04:42 2015 UTC,You should be fine. Just let it sit for a day after the day you use it.
PipeTobacco,3aijp0,CBNathanael,5,Sat Jun 20 21:06:53 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to get better at packing a bowl, but I'm unclear on how the draw should feel. I've heard the straw analogy, but it varies from ""a drink""  to ""a milkshake.""   I always have a clear difference between empty and packed, but never the suction required to get water up a straw, let alone a milkshake. Am I misunderstanding  the process, or am I severely underpacking?"
PipeTobacco,3aijp0,blenheim45,6,Sun Jun 21 00:18:02 2015 UTC,"More like water than a milk shake, which is to say still very easy but not entirely devoid of resistance.    I seldom run across it in packing anymore, but occasionally I will when I over-tamp.  Solution is to use the straight probe on the 3-in-1 tool and run it straight down the center of the bowl and find the hole, and then draw it straight out.    But if you want you can reverse the course, pack a bit lighter and then after lighting gently tamp.  Easiest way to control your tamping is to use a bit of wooden dowel and basically tamp with the weight of the dowel and little or no added pressure.  You will end up smoking less than a full bowl each time, but you will know immediately if you over tamp, as it will get hard to draw or it will go out.  YMMV"
PipeTobacco,3aijp0,CBNathanael,3,Sun Jun 21 00:39:08 2015 UTC,"I think I'm confused by the dowel approach. Unless I'm using a 3' section, I can't imagine it's heavy enough to tamp anything."
PipeTobacco,3aijp0,levins0,4,Sun Jun 21 00:46:53 2015 UTC,It shouldn't be heavy. All you should be doing when tamping is gently pressing the burning bits down against the not burning bits. It's really just making sure the embers make contact with the next unburnt layer of tobacco.
PipeTobacco,3aijp0,CBNathanael,3,Sun Jun 21 01:38:20 2015 UTC,"Oh! I thought you were referring to the tamping process when packing (e.g. baby/woman/man).   This makes much more sense. In that instance, yes, I tamp very lightly with my pipe tool."
PipeTobacco,3aijp0,blenheim45,5,Sun Jun 21 01:50:00 2015 UTC,"It is not like ""tamping"" earth or stone prior to pouring concrete, and no you do not need a three foot section.  That is exactly the point.  The first tamp of the pipe is generally between the charring and ignition lights, and all it is doing to maintaining contact between the part that the heat has caused to expand and the underlying still compacted tobacco.    I find most new smokers generally don't tamp often enough, and when they do they tend to tamp too hard, almost extinguishing the pipe.  ymmv  In the slow smoking contests they give you a 4 inch piece of dowel for a tamper... and it seems to work pretty well, with contestants getting smoking one bowl up to 2 hours or more... with very constant and gentle tamping."
PipeTobacco,3aijp0,CBNathanael,3,Sun Jun 21 03:47:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) /u/levins0 clarified it for me. When I tamp after lighting, it's a pretty light touch. Your comment makes MUCH more sense, now"
PipeTobacco,3aijp0,antiwittgenstein,4,Sun Jun 21 03:58:09 2015 UTC,"How are your smokes with your current packing? What method are you using?  I like to pack light, so that there is no real difference between filled and empty when I do a pressure check. I make up the difference with vigilant tamping."
PipeTobacco,3aijp0,CBNathanael,4,Sun Jun 21 00:35:30 2015 UTC,"I'm using the three pinch method. I don't smoke much, and they're not often, so practice is very slow going.   I usually end up with tongue burn, but that could be because I draw too hard. I'm basing my experience on movies and TV shows, so I tend to expect billowing smoke with every puff. Nosing around here has been good for my perception :) I think I just need to pack a little tighter, and slow down."
PipeTobacco,3aijp0,antiwittgenstein,4,Sun Jun 21 00:44:42 2015 UTC,"I hate the 3 pinch method - it is fine once you know what you are doing, but it is like trying to learn how to ride a bike using a 10 speed.  Try the palm'n'stuff: 1. Put a pile of baccy on your non-dominant hand. 2. Invert the pipe over the pipe. 3. Gently rotate the pipe. 4. Once it sucks up most of the tobacco, right the pipe.  For many ribbons, this produces an ideal pack. It is very light, but will burn consistently as there is an even amount of tobacco up and down the bowl.  Many tobaccos, especially nearly pure Virginia, will not produce voluminous clouds. It is whispy. In fact for many tobaccos, aromatics especially, you want to take tiny sips. If you want to have a bite-free big puffs of smoke experience try an English blend with Cavendish, and maybe even some cigar leaf (Billy Budd comes immediately to mind) as these produces the thickest smoke."
PipeTobacco,3aijp0,CBNathanael,5,Sun Jun 21 01:01:59 2015 UTC,"I've seen the Palm Method before, and was thinking of trying that out, along with the Air Pocket.   I don't care much about voluminous clouds. It's the slow pleasure I'm after. I just needed to manage my expectations. :)"
PipeTobacco,3aijp0,winemakerpete,5,Sun Jun 21 01:05:43 2015 UTC,"What exactly is a pipe club? I assume it's a group of gentleman/ladies that get together to smoke and hang out, which sounds great! Is there anything else to it? Where do they meet, indoors/out? Public or private area? Is there a list of known pipe clubs out there in the US? Thanks!"
PipeTobacco,3aijp0,gestalt162,5,Sun Jun 21 02:19:00 2015 UTC,"At its most basic, a pipe club is a group of people who meet on a somewhat regular basis to smoke pipes together. Generally the only qualification for membership is an interest in and enjoyment of pipe smoking.  There are hundreds of pipe clubs throughout the world, and I am sure they all do things a little different. I am a  member of my local pipe club, and can tell you what we do.  We meet on the last Monday of every month at the lounge of our local tobacconist. There are usually 12-15 of us at any given meeting, with some who attend every meeting and others who only come a couple times a year. All male, but that's more due to the demographics of pipe smoking than any specific exclusion of women. Ages range from college students to old codgers. Dues are $10/year, plus $5 at each meeting for pizza. Dues go the shop for its support, and to support club events. Many members bring bottles of premium booze (usually scotch or whiskey) to share with everyone.  Meetings usually ""start"" at 6:30, and people usually start leaving around 8:30 (the store doesn't close until 10). There is usually a featured tobacco that everyone can fill their bowls with and sample. There is a ""business"" section that lasts 10 minutes and usually is to discuss ideas for events- we have had, or are planning:   Talks by tobacco blenders (Lane and Erik Stokkebye) Visit to a local pipemaker's shop for an explanation of the pipemaking process Slow smoking contest Cookout at a member's house Club blends (club buys tobacco varieties and members are allowed to blend and take some home)   The club treasurer orders pizza and wings for everyone. If there are at least 12 people, the store donates a pipe or tobacco pouch to raffle off, and members can buy raffle tickets. Other than that, 90% of the meeting is spent just shooting the shit, talking with other members about pipes, tobacco, and life. At the end of the meeting, everyone gets to take home an oz of bulk tobacco from the shop, or a tin of the feature tobacco (usually Sutliff) if available.  All in all its a pretty good time. I look forward to each month's meeting.  I would check out /r/pipeclubs, where people post info about their local clubs, or ask if they are available. Also check out the United Pipe Clubs of America website, although it is far from exhaustive, it does have a long list."
PipeTobacco,3aijp0,winemakerpete,2,Sun Jun 21 14:09:37 2015 UTC,"Wow, that sounds really fun. I assume this is in a city? I have a tobacco shop about 30 min from here and it is the only one for hundreds of miles. I should call him up and ask if he hosts one. I don't know why I didn't think of that myself. Thanks for the thorough response."
PipeTobacco,3aijp0,gestalt162,2,Sun Jun 21 16:27:21 2015 UTC,"Yep, this is in Buffalo, NY.  If your tobacconist has a lounge, I would ask them if they're willing to host a monthly pipe club, then leave an email sign up list there and see how many people sign up. Our club has a signup list on the tobacconist's front counter, and everyone on the list gets a reminder about a week before the next meeting."
PipeTobacco,3aijp0,winemakerpete,2,Sun Jun 21 19:53:05 2015 UTC,"No lounge that I know of. It's a tiny place and guys are always smoking standing up in there. Alot of ""excuse me"" and ""pardon me"" as people try to buy things. Great place, though. Doug, the tobacconist, is a great guy, too."

PipeTobacco,3aijp0,blenheim45,4,Sun Jun 21 16:59:30 2015 UTC,"/u/gestalt162 has stipulated a fairly typical US pipe club, as far as I can tell.  soem clubs are more formal, some less.  Here in Canada our smoking laws are rather strict [which is about as accurate as saying the Marquis De Sade wasn't a nice guy].  so in Ontario there is no such thing as a smoking lounge, unless it is at a casino.  Basically the law is set up so that you are not allowed to smoke in a business that has employees, nor are you  allowed to smoke  withing 30 feet of an entrance to any building open to the public, nor in any bar, restaurant, park,  sporting event or arena, ad nauseum.  So our club meets at members' homes.  We started with two guys who met on line and went from there.  We nominally have 20 members, but never have had all 20 in one spot.  We are very laid back, do not have a 'business meeting"" more than 2 or 3 times a year, and while we talk tobacco and pipes, whether new acquisitions or the one that got away, we also will talk about anything under the sun  or for that matter under the moon.  Just off the top of my head we have discussed: RPGs (D&D and WoW mostly), comic books, science fiction, alternative history, the history of bible translations, 3-D printing, computers, music, NFL football (especially ""Da Bears""), Kentucky Basketball, Cards Against Humanity, and damn near anything else that comes along.  the ages represented start at 19 and then there is me at 70 at the other end.  We only have one female member, who appears irregularly, she is into building demolition derby cars (I think?), which takes up a bit of time too.  We are in an area with the major urban area being 45,000 and the two co-founders live in a town of 4,500+.  We have members who came as far as 45 miles or so, about an hours drive away.  We do have the support of a local tobacconist, but due to regulations he cannot host meetings, or he would.  In addition to guest visits from Ernie (our local tobacconist) he has also brought visitations by Jack Ried (pipe repairs and pipe carver), our local Brigham representative (who also reps for a slew of tobaccos that Brigham handles in Canada) and some other tobacco reps over the years.  Some where on line Steve Fallon AKA ""Pipestud""has a write up on how they started and run their local pipe club... ""seek and ye shall find.."" a few false hits and here it is ""Starting your own pipe club"".  You will note this is a much more ""formal"" organization than my club ""Chatham-Kent Pipe Club"". LOL"

I've never experienced such fantastic creaminess, spice, and flavor all balanced so delicately and expertly. This blender is a god, methinks. I will definitely be looking to try the rest of his lineup.   I don't know what Balkan Sobranie was like in the late seventies, but I am happy to believe that this is as close as it gets. I was very impressed with both Blackhouse and Whiteknight. I think your analysis is spot on, /u/tribial. My preference lies with the brightness and spice of the Whiteknight, but I will certainly be stocking up on a few of each for an aging program."

The WK is more of a balkan blend with the Orientals coming forward more, hence the spice like flavor. The BH I find it to be more of an English with the Va and Latakia coming out more, with the black Cavendish and KY adding the richness. They're good blends for someone to taste the difference between a balkan and an English. I have 30 tins of WK and about 5 tins of BH in my cellar so, you can tell which is my favorite.

So you think the WK may age better as well as it being your favorite? Am I correct in assuming the VAs will become more forward and the spice will mellow with age then? (In theory atleast?)"
PipeTobacco,3ahcf4,paok1234,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:32:59 2015 UTC,"Well, I think both blends will age pretty good. I just happen to like WK better. I find it's not as heavy as BH and a bit more creamier. IMHO  with age both blends should mellow in the Lat and Oriental department and, the Va should come forward with it's earthiness and sweetness. At least I hope so, since I have 30 tins of it and plan to get more! Lol"
PipeTobacco,3ahcf4,BriarBoy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:24:51 2015 UTC,"I already thought they were both pretty light on the Latakia smokiness, I could have had a bit more of that in both of them, but will probably pick up about 5 of each to age and 1 or 2 more to smoke fresh. I'd like to try Magnum Opus as well, and will have a tin or two of that in my next order."
PipeTobacco,3ahcf4,BriarBoy,2,Sat Jun 20 18:34:59 2015 UTC,"I find WK to be lighter in Lat than BH but my taste buds do get it. Magnus Opus is another one I would like to try but, I have a whole line of VaPers I have to get through first."
PipeTobacco,3agt6a,csobod,6,Sat Jun 20 01:18:14 2015 UTC,"Aromatics are exactly what their called, all about the aroma.  They smell great and leave some great scent in your mustache, but not all of them are very flavor forward (though some are very tasty).   Some people define enlish blends by the use of latakia (though that's not a hard rule).  Latakia is smoked over pine, so imagine what your favorite hoody smells like after sitting by a camp fire for a few hours.  FM original will be a good intro to an Engliah style.  There is an amazing amount of variety out there in terms of English blends, but FM should tell you if you'll like them in general.  Virginia blends tend to be my favorite.  Straight VA blends are on the sweeter side of the natural tobacco spectrum.  You hear the term hay-like with VA blends.  VA/Pers have the addition of perique, which adds a peppery touch and a nice sourness like stewed plums.  There are tons of options for these too.  I always suggest to look at tobaccoreviews.com and compare notes to what sounds good to you, and certainly ask lots of questions."
PipeTobacco,3agt6a,PipeBeard,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:51:27 2015 UTC,That's very good advice. What would you recommend as a very mild virginia blend?
PipeTobacco,3agt6a,PipeBeard,3,Sat Jun 20 01:52:59 2015 UTC,orlik golden slices and capatan blue are great examples that are both easy to get into and easy to love :)
PipeTobacco,3agt6a,blenheim45,3,Sat Jun 20 02:02:33 2015 UTC,"FM is a nice  MotR English, assuming FM is what you get.  There is a section in ""Our Wiki"" in the Beginners Section which both covers the types of blends and gives several recommendations for each type.  It recently came up in conversation among a few of my fellow club members, and those who like Latakia, as I do, tend not to blow the smoke out through our noses.  those who like Virginias and Va.-Per.s tend to exhale through their noses.  Lat. hounds tend to find a lot of Virginias bland and cigarette like, and the others find the Lat. over powering.  So guide yourself accordingly.  For your switch from aros to ""plain"" tobaccos (unflavored) you are going to taste tobacco, and that runs a whole gamut, defined by a number of variables, the type of tobacco, where it was grown, how it was cured, and what other tobaccos are in the blend and in what proportions.  Go to one of the major blenders sites (not just one retail source) and count the number of variations they have on a ""theme"".  i always cite Cornell and Deihl, since I have the ambition to eventually taste all of their English/Balkan Blends.  they used to list 70 such blends, not counting blends they produce for other's, but now I think it is about 90, approaching 100. LOL  And that is just one blender and one type of blend.  If you can locate a pipe club in your area, or an upcoming pipe show that is one of the best ways to get an introduction to some of the various blends at little or no cost.  ""Sit right down here and try some of my Arango ""Balkan Supreme.  This is a modestly priced bulk and won ""Best English Blend"" at the Chicago tobacco throwdown in 2014"". :-)"
PipeTobacco,3agt6a,antiwittgenstein,2,Sat Jun 20 01:59:34 2015 UTC,"An English blend is about smoke and savoury notes - from the Latakia and Orientals contained therein. Frequently sweet and spicy elements - Virginia, Cavendish, and Perique - are mixed in there too, so you get a full Asian dish kind of balance of all kinds of flavours. Unlike aromatics, the taste is extremely pronounced.  As for straight-ish Virginia, particularly flakes, you get a sweet-sour frequently spicy melange, with citrus notes or plummy, dried fruit pops, or if it is a good one, both at the same time. Orlik Golden Sliced and Hearth and Homes Anniversary Cake are good places to start."
PipeTobacco,3agt6a,NapalmBBQ,2,Sat Jun 20 01:55:34 2015 UTC,"Just picked up my first tin of Drew Estates' ""Meat Pie"". It's honestly fantastic.

There are lots of options, but Down by the River is good, and if you think you'll like fuller, more cigar-like notes, try some of the burleys by C&D. Dark-fired KY is smoky, but more in a woody, BBQ way than the campfire of latakia (try ODF for a decent bit with some sweet VA, and Dark Twist Roll Cake for a sweeter VA with just a bit of KY)."
PipeTobacco,3ahbk9,Slamfrankel,9,Sat Jun 20 04:31:35 2015 UTC,There's the possibility that you just don't like english blends. Venture forth and obtain burley. Burley good.

PipeTobacco,3ahbk9,Edge767,6,Sat Jun 20 14:20:31 2015 UTC,"Don't feel bad. I have seen on this subreddit over the years the trend toward, ""You're not a real pipe smoker unless you love English blends."" This is pure rubbish. You're a true pipe smoker if you smoke a pipe and derive enjoyment from it, utilizing a tobacco of your choosing that suits your taste. Flavor is subjective. Some people love chocolate while there are some poor souls who actually dislike it. The same holds true for strawberries, pineapple, and tobacco (among others).  Bottom line: if you like aromatics, smoke them. Nobody should judge you for it. If they do, they are the ones who are not among the brotherhood of the pipe. I will gladly smoke my pipe with any other pipe smoker regardless of the tobacco he or she chooses to place in their bowl. That's their business, and what I put into my bowl is my business.   Enjoy!"

The latter two are definitely there, but the VA and Per are also strong.   I've never tried MR, though, so I can't compare."
PipeTobacco,3ahbk9,Cycleoflife,3,Sat Jun 20 21:53:33 2015 UTC,"Well buddy, if you've tried Plum Pudding, Shortcut to Mushrooms, Frog Morton Cellar, Balkan Blue, Nightcap, and EMP and you didn't like them it's safe to assume  you're not into Latakia/English/Balkan blends. Stop wasting your money and look into other non-latakia blends. Maybe try some VaPers or Va blends. Do some trades with other guys here that like those blends."
PipeTobacco,3ahbk9,Cycleoflife,2,Sat Jun 20 12:02:14 2015 UTC,"Yea, it sounds like you have done your due diligence and you just don't really care for Latakia.

A big red tub of PA sits proudly on top of my cabinet, a pouch of CBW in my car, and a bag of 1Q on the work bemch in my garage.   Sir Walter Raliegh Aromatic is good, I don't care for the non-aro, though. Half and Half is also a great old blend. North of the border Amphora is still readily available, and well worth a try."

PipeTobacco,3afo6k,MinisculePeen,2,Fri Jun 19 19:23:27 2015 UTC,"There isn't really a ""most"" to it. It depends heavily on personal tastes, the tobacco itself, and to some extent the pipe. If you try another flake and it doesn't sit well with you, the next step is to cube cut it. After that, rub it out. Personally, I've got some pretty stout blends like Sextant that I prefer in flake form. Then there's Gaslight, which I really prefer in cube cuts. But there are some, like Key Largo or Irish Flake that I can't stand as flakes or cubes, but rubbing them out brings them to a tolerable state for me.  I'm sure you'll be inundated with tobacco recommendations, so I'll leave that to others."
PipeTobacco,3afo6k,chewsyourownadv,2,Fri Jun 19 19:38:18 2015 UTC,"I can't remember which was which, but I remember thinking they were very similar to the Stokkebye Luxury Flakes. I prefer the Navy, but I think Twist is a bit more popular. Orlik Golden Flake Sliced and Capstan Blue are also going to be very similar. I'd bet you'd enjoy any of these about as much as the IRC flake.  If you want to expand your horizon a bit further, I'd suggest Gawith's Full Virginia Flake, or FVF's baby brother Best Brown Flake. All of them are good, but FVF is head and shoulders above the rest, IMHO.   Edit: brain fart."

There is a big shelf that slides out, then moves up and locks into place.    I store all my (keeper) smoking pipes and tobacco on that shelf, and installed a cheap 'push on' light, above and inside.   My cellared tins hide under the shelf way back in the cool, dark and dry.    The drawers are filled with my tools and pipes I'm restoring/cleaning.  And that is overflowing, so my sweetheart is looking for a vanity/display to put near the desk for all that stuff."

Things like the 100g Solani tins are horrible, and so they get jarred immediately. The rest is in wide mouth mason jars, either 1 or .5 pint ones. All of this is in large cardboard boxes in a closet.  As for the pipes, I only have 1 rack that hold 18, and needless to say, it's completely full. The rest of the pipes are in other cardboard boxes or sitting on the same wire shelf the rack is on.

Along the long side two drawers. One shallow to hold pipes, one deep to hold jars and tins. The rails would be all wood, no cheap metal rails to crap out on you.

Try emailing the company this picture and see what their response is.  It is not like the stamp is going to cost you anything.  LOL  The very worst I can anticipate is they might ask you to mail it to them, for them to replace it.  all things considered I imagine they  won't even require that.  They might want to know when and where you purchased it.  If it was out of a bag os ""seconds'... well that might be another matter, but I doubt it."

PipeTobacco,3acax8,Chuzordie,2,Thu Jun 18 23:11:03 2015 UTC,"The weather here (NE Ohio) has been humid and pretty warm.  I keep the pipe on a bench in my garage. The temp in there is somewhere between the outside temp and the A/C temp in my house.  Maybe mid 70's.     I don't see the crack on the inside and a light does not show thru, but the pipe feels warmer in this area when I smoke it. It looks pretty deep.  And there is a lighter crack on the other side and also going around the bowl at about the same elevation.   BTW I don't rap it or anything like that when I clean it out."
PipeTobacco,3ac9wo,Chuzordie,3,Thu Jun 18 22:54:36 2015 UTC,They are a popular collectable and ltd for a reason.

PipeTobacco,3aa1xd,hedonaut,5,Thu Jun 18 14:12:32 2015 UTC,I honestly love them so far. My newest is the deep red coloured one to the right of the middle stand. It is the most pleasant pipe I have to clench because the bent stem sits comfortably against my chin/jaw and the bowl is delicate and light. I was smoking some of the Connoisseur's Choice this evening and it is known to be a hot burner but the pipe remained  cool to the touch for the whole smoke. I got the Mr. Brog Churchwarden for the looks and totally regret it. The pear wood is no match to briar and I should have gone for another estate pipe.  As for my second favourite; the castagno - it has a very large and thick round bowl with a really wide stem and bit. It is far too heavy for me to clench but its size is comfortable to hold.
PipeTobacco,3aa1xd,Dieselandrust,2,Thu Jun 18 14:30:55 2015 UTC,It's a lovely collection. Those St. Claudes are neat pipes. I've been thinking of grabbing one myself if I can temporarily free myself of my Capri addiction. What makes your favorites so special?

PipeTobacco,3ab1m2,pipesmokinggal,8,Thu Jun 18 17:25:32 2015 UTC,"Smoke the hell out of it and cake it up. The build up of cake should help to remedy gurgling, but if it still gurgles then it comes down to faulty engineering in the stem or bowl. You can quickly solve gurgling in the meantime by:  1. running a pipe cleaner through the stem to absorb moisture 2. blowing gently into the stem, which rapidly heats the embers in the bowl and evaporates existing moisture  If I don't have a cleaner with me (which I often do not), I will use #2 and it solves the issue. Cake usually solves it completely."
PipeTobacco,3ab1m2,Cobwarden,11,Thu Jun 18 17:29:56 2015 UTC,Or the tobacco is too wet and simply needs more time to dry before packing. Not all gurgle issues are poor drilling/engineering.

PipeTobacco,3ab1m2,DryYourTobacco,2,Fri Jun 19 00:13:04 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, dry your tobacco before smoking and I believe this is why most people advise to smoke quarter or half-bowls in the beginning stages of caking.

PipeTobacco,3ab1m2,tkms,2,Thu Jun 18 21:01:06 2015 UTC,Also a fast cadence can make the tobacco smoke wet as well. If you're a fast smoker that could be contributing as well.

PipeTobacco,3aallr,MisterHall,12,Thu Jun 18 15:27:30 2015 UTC,"Open one, leave the others. Smoke the one, buy other things, cellar them. Keep your cellar deep so you're always smoking aged stuff and only keep a few things open at a time."
PipeTobacco,3aallr,hedonaut,3,Thu Jun 18 15:34:33 2015 UTC,the last part is where I fail. opened tins everywhere.
PipeTobacco,3aallr,tribial,7,Fri Jun 19 05:00:29 2015 UTC,"Age is good, but don't go nuts over it. Its often a very subtle thing and if you're asking a question like this, chances are you haven't developed the palate to appreciate the nuance anyway. I developed my cellar by buying 2 tins to replace each one I smoked. Eventually this will increase your cellar exponentially and you end up with well aged tobacco because it just takes so long to smoke through it all.   If you only have one tin of something on hand and won't let yourself open it because you want it to age, particularly if its something that is readily available, I think you're doing it wrong. But that's just my personal take on things. I suspect I am in the minority (particularly around these parts)."
PipeTobacco,3aallr,DaveInPhilly,5,Thu Jun 18 15:47:07 2015 UTC,Irish flake is my favorite and I have the other two also in mason jars. I've only been smoking for like 2 years and have never had a tin last long enough to age. If it's not that big of a difference then I don't really see the point. I was under the impression that the flavors meld a little better and different flavors come out
PipeTobacco,3aallr,Slamfrankel,5,Thu Jun 18 15:58:36 2015 UTC,"I just recently got a tin of Irish Flake and loved it so the next day I bought another tin and the unopened one said 2012 on it ( may have been earlier. I don't have it on me) and i was so excited that it was aged. I cracked it and found no difference in taste, texture or color. So i'm just speaking from my one time personal experience but it seems to age extremely slow. I have Best Brown and Golden Sliced and both seem to taste better with age. Both of mine are delicious and the best brown came with some plume on it already"
PipeTobacco,3aallr,TheShitHitTheFanBoy,3,Thu Jun 18 16:09:23 2015 UTC,"Depends on the tobacco. Irish Flake is mainly Burley and therefore age wont make as much of a difference. The small amount of aged tobaccos I've smoked has led me to the conclusion that aging a tobacco doesn't make a huge difference. It will get better, but it won't become something completely different. I'd say that just 2-6 months will do just fine for most tobaccos."
PipeTobacco,3aallr,DaveInPhilly,2,Thu Jun 18 17:21:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, flavors meld a bit, VA leaf sweetens, latakia and any tobbing will mellow and fade some. Some blends change more than others. I can't really say that anything new or different comes out, though. Latakia tends to really mellow out (which is why I don't understand why people pay a premium for really old latakia blends). So when you age a blend like SG Navy the effect is that the VA sweetens and matures, while the latakia fades away. This creates a very different profile from the young tobacco, which is far more Latakia forward, but all the components are still there.   Don't forget that tobacco is aged to an extent before it is sold. Blenders age tobacco before they blend. Then they age the blended tobacco. Then they package it, and the packaged tobacco isn't exactly ""aged"", but it does sit around before it reaches the consumer.   I had the opportunity to speak with Eric Stokkebye not long ago. Someone else asked him if he he aged his tobacco after it was tinned. He kind of shrugged it off, saying basically not at all. He didn't see the benefit in doing so. Once the air is removed, the aging process is very, very subtle. And to whatever extent the blend was altered - it will deviate from the final product as he initially intended it. He was surprised to hear that folks were so vehemently in favor deliberately letting stuff age.   Greg Pease comes out on the other end of the spectrum, and has created an art out of the anaerobic aging process.   TL;DR - To each his own."

PipeTobacco,3aallr,tennesseean_87,2,Thu Jun 18 17:43:35 2015 UTC,Thank you for asking. The replies here are very informative for an even newer newbie than you!
PipeTobacco,3aallr,PhysicsNovice,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:51:29 2015 UTC,"If you already have some in mason jars, don't open new tins of the same blend. At least wait until you smoke up what you have open before cracking those."
PipeTobacco,3aallr,Cobwarden,3,Thu Jun 18 20:17:11 2015 UTC,The Orlik GS I have is 7+ years I also smoke FVF with 15+. At this point I find aged tobaccos to be better but not worth the wait.  If you look hard enough you can find just about any blend with age on it. I've set my price point at $1 per year of age since I can usually find that. But like I said aging hasn't blown me away so Im not really on the hunt for it anymore beyond the novelty.
PipeTobacco,3aaa4o,chewsyourownadv,4,Thu Jun 18 13:53:54 2015 UTC,"Bouchons are fantastic.  I really wasn't a fan of regular semois as it tastes too much like cigars for me.  (I like cigars, a lot, but if I want cigar flavor I'll smoke the cigar I want to smoke.)  But the bouchons were pretty interesting.  Still more of a cigar note than not, but VERY chocolatey in flavor.  Great stuff.    I'd suggest smoking them in a pipe with a narrow chamber as anything below bowl level becomes hard to smoke, so using a smaller chamber will prolong that.  I really need to get more of those."

PipeTobacco,3aaa4o,RazorRabbit17,2,Fri Jun 19 01:53:19 2015 UTC,"I have purchased both the bouchons and the green brick. To date it is/was the largest most expensive tobacco purchase I have made.   The bouchons and brick both have similar flavors (which I am not great at explaining) but the bouchons can be a pain in the ass if you don't have it seated well and use a narrow bowled pipe.   Also the box the bouchons come in is nice, but it doesn't seal and let's them dry out very quickly. I recommend putting them into a humidor, or into a mason jar with a humidity pack or something. Also the loose tobacco dries out quickly in the original packaging and when it's dry, it burns really hot and really fast.   Yay wall of text."
PipeTobacco,3aaf6z,Slamfrankel,3,Thu Jun 18 14:35:59 2015 UTC,"Davidoff of Geneva on Madsion, and Nat Sherman's townhouse should both be on your list. Both locations are very different in feel, and both have fantastic people working them. If you go to Nat Sherman's, get talking to their pipe guy, Chris. He blends the in house blends for them and really knows his stuff. The Townhouse is really a fantastic place to spend an afternoon. They have fantastic atmosphere.   Davidoff's is a smaller spot, the whole place just exudes class. THe staff is extremely professional. Check in on Alexandro for me. He was starting to delve into pipes pretty seriously when last I visited, and I suspect he'd be tickled pink to get someone in asking for him to talk pipes. He's a really interesting guy to chat with besides that.   Barclay Rex down on Water St. is well worth a visit as well. Those guys have a small spot as they're constructing a bigger lounge right now that won't be open until later in the summer (I believe). They also have a really neat atmosphere. Aside from pipes and cigars, they have a selection of fine hats and canes. They're that old school. Terrance, at their other location, has a lot pipe lore and stories to share as well.   Check em out. Make sure you tell them who sent you. And have fun on your trip. Despite the grueling NY state tobacco taxes, NYC is an awesome town for a pipe guy."

I generally have little faith in aromatics. /u/levins0 included a little sample in a recent trade, and with a little (lot?) drying, I thought this flake is superb.

PipeTobacco,3a9ac6,PipeBeard,5,Thu Jun 18 11:34:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks, Pipebeard. With all the excitement around here about it, I think I have to give it a few more rounds to know for sure. I also refuse to form opinions on anything based on a single sample (Fermented skate is an acquired taste. Silkworm pupa taste like dirt regardless. Sesame leaves are the shit.). Do you find it better a little wetter or drier? Mine was very dry, which may have lead to the cigarette-y taste."
PipeTobacco,3a9ac6,paidinboredom,2,Thu Jun 18 11:52:09 2015 UTC,"I tend to prefer it on the drier side. The cut is interesting and chunky, and the pieces are sometimes difficult to break down, but i rub them out as much as I can.  Maybe that helps a bit.  I have definitely gotten cigarette-y taste, and have found that age helps, but I try to take this one real slow, too.  I have a tin of the 2014 that I haven't opened yet, because I'm still finishing up my 3rd tin of the 2013 ;)"

Rubbing out, fold and stuff, both led to disappointment. I'm struggling to see what is so amazing about this stuff... Perhaps in reviews that I write I'll put a ""worth the effort"" section.

Also, I hate broken flakes because they always cause my hands to hurt rubbing them out, and it reminds me that I'm old and arthritic. :P  This week my pipe blends have both been McClellands: Frog Morton's Cellar and Vanilla Ice.

Maybe I haven't been keeping up with your posts as much as I would like.   For me, lately, it's been all about the Kajun Kake across a few pipes. There's hints of flavor in there I'm crazy about finding, tantalizing little glimpses of something wonderful, but I'm having a hell of a time trying to find a smoking cadence that really brings them out. The tin note is sweet with notes of chocolate, molasses, and vague little whiffs of tanginess. In the pipe, though, it comes out as a dryer, mostly earthy profile. It's still pleasant, mind, just not what that tin note advertises. I'm hoping I can find a way to get more out of it. It might just be a matter of age.  I've also broken in, or I'm in the process of breaking in anyway, a new English pipe. We have some of the old Capri Golden Burls laying around, which Savinelli discontinued. I've been snapping them up as quickly as my budget allows because I love them and they won't be around much long. I'm thinking an afternoon bowl of Squadron Leader will have to happen."

PipeTobacco,3a7cua,gestalt162,7,Wed Jun 17 21:01:08 2015 UTC,"Haha, right?  Actually, if you mostly start with small tins or 1oz bulk samples, a few mason jars will be fine. Get the large, quart sized wide mouth jars and use Ziploc bags for the tobacco inside the jars. That way you only need maybe one case  (12 jars) to hold the various samples. Just store like with like. If they smell similar, jar them together. The smells will mesh a bit, but the flavor will be fine."
PipeTobacco,3a7cua,SupraMario,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:16:42 2015 UTC,I would not recommend that. I have had at least two occasions where the flavored of 2-3 great tobaccos melded in the same jar (separate bags) to produce one crappy tasting tobacco.

PipeTobacco,3a7cua,raizel_234,3,Thu Jun 18 03:52:03 2015 UTC,"Truth!  You can determine what level of pipe, get the most necessary of accessories, and a free groups of sample to see what the different tobacco types are like. In Our Wiki there is a ""beginner section"" which includes things like what the major tobacco blends are like, and includes specific recommendations polled from the membership here.  So instead of my favorite English blend (which is very good mind you) you get suggestions that a large number of people endorse.  As you begin to figure out what you like, and don't like you are going to be overwhelmed by the number of blends listed, many of which sound like they should be identical, since they have what appears to be identical ingredients.  Only it doesn't work out quite like that.  If you go through a list of Cornell and Diehl's blends that are considered ""English"" (that is Latakia forward blends) you will find over 70, probably closer to 90 today, and each of them is different.  Some are close to being the ""same"" and some are totally different than the others.  And that is one blender and one type.  The same thing holds true for other blenders of note, and for the other types of blends too.  So let us say you have found a blend you ""like"", and for the sake of argument it is a Va-Per (Virginia Perique blend) and it lists virginias, perique, black cavendish, and just a touch of orientals.  It is good, but...it isn't quite everything you want.  Now you go to tobaccoreviews.com and look at the reviews of this known blend and read through, noting who rated this about the same as you would.  Now punch in the ingredients on their search engine, and look for the same reviewers and how they feel about the various other blends.  [After a while you will find some reviewers who seem to be dead on to how you taste the tobaccos, and you can look through their reviews for highly rated blends and generate your shopping list.]  One of the reasons for doing this is you might really like a blend, but find it is a budget stretcher, only coming in tins and at a premium price.  If you can find a bulk that tastes as good for you... and costs less... bingo you have just given yourself more buying power.  IF you go into a b&m tobacconist [Bricks & Mortar] and ask for their most popular blend you are almost invariably end up with an aromatic [flavored] blend.  Bask in the old days most of use started out eitheer with aros or with a plain codger Virginia/Burley blend (Sir Walter, Prince Albert, etc.)... it was what was available in every gas station and drug store.  Even today probably 90% of the pipe tobacco sold is aromatic.  However on here you are going to see a division something like 50/50 or maybe even 60/40 in favor of non-aromatics.  The difference is basically whether you want to smoke a tobacco that really smells nice and has less tobacco taste, or if you want to taste the tobaccos and perhaps not  be able to do it around some of your (non-smoking) friends. LOL    Of the four founding members of our local pipe club, ALL of us started out with aros.  Even though each of us will on occasion still smoke an aro, we all mainly smoke plainer tobaccos on a day to day basis.  Always keep in mind the prime law of pipe smoking: ""Smoke what you like, and like what you smoke."""

PipeTobacco,3a6fr3,star_boy2005,4,Wed Jun 17 16:26:09 2015 UTC,"I've refurbished a few heavily caked meers. I put a vodka soaked (not dripping wet) cotton ball in the bowl for a a couple of hours and then scraped the cake away with a dull pointed knife. Peeled, rather than scraped, becuse the cake came off rather easily every time. This advice came from some meer collector at some forum, and I personally couldn't see any harm come upon those three or four meers. All this said, take caution and use high proof potable alcohol.  BTW, in my experience meers do ""ghost"" pretty much the same as briars if they been tortured with cheap aromatics. They do come around after a while when smoked with other tobaccos.  EDIT: Forgot to add that, same as with briars, the culprit for a nasty tasting smoke or ""ghost"" is usually in the gunk/tar deposits in the airway and the bottom of the mortise, rather than in the bowl itself. Be extra careful when cleaning the mortises and the connectors of a meer  because the material softens when it gets wet."

PipeTobacco,3a6fr3,Mordenkrad,3,Thu Jun 18 04:34:15 2015 UTC,"You don't want any kind of liquid sitting in your meer at any point.   Your best best is going to be to scrape out the bowl as best you can using a dull instrument. You can run a pipe cleaner soaked in denatured alcohol or some other high alcohol content substance through the shank, but be sure you sop up all the moisture left behind immediately with dry cleaners.   Besides those two steps, your best bet is always to smoke it. Meer ghosts don't last long, especially with a bowl of pirate cake or ten russians."

PipeTobacco,3a6fr3,Mordenkrad,3,Wed Jun 17 16:40:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can.  You want to use the highest % alcohol you can get your hands on.  I use 99% isopropyl alcohol (unscented), aka rubbing alcohol.  i would use Everclear, but Canada does not allow the sales of pure ethyl alcohol to the public. [Beware: some U.S. jurisdictions do not allow pure ethyl alcohol either, and you will see Everclear bottles and when you read the fine print you will see they are not the 95% alcohol product sold in other states.]  The cotton ball method mentioned above, followed by a gentle scraping or peeling with.. my weapon of choice is a butter knife with a rounded head.  Pure alcohol is going to evaporate in fairly quick order, should all be gone in 24 hours.  Then pack and smoke something plain and bland, like an old codger blend such as SWR,  'arf & 'arf, or Prince Albert and you should be good to go."

PipeTobacco,3a6fr3,BriarBoy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:56:10 2015 UTC,"Meers don't really ghost, so you are likely getting residue from cake.  Gently, very gently scrape it out.  You shouldn't have to do much else."
PipeTobacco,3a6fr3,BriarBoy,0,Wed Jun 17 19:03:03 2015 UTC,"Just realized what pipe you are talking about, the bowl was clean as a whistle, not a bit of cake in it. I take very good care of my pipes, hope you don't end up ruining the pipe in the process of what ever it is you are trying to achieve. Just smoke 10 bowls of that ""Hobbit's Weed"" through it and it should be gone."
PipeTobacco,3a6fr3,Mordenkrad,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:54:38 2015 UTC,"It kind of sounds like you're taking issue with the fact that I didn't find the pipe in immaculate condition. I meant nothing personal. In fact, I didn't mention you by name nor did I criticize your care, even indirectly. The pipe is clearly used, though. ""Clean as a whistle"" is not at all how I would describe the bowl. Unlike the other meers in my collection, in which the lining of the bowl is kept visible, this one has a thick black layer of carbon, which to my thinking is holding the odor of the tobacco that was previously smoked in it. More to the point, that tobacco was apparently of a variety that I don't care for. That's down to a matter of taste - you smoked a variety of tobaccos in the pipe that differ from my own tastes. It's to be expected and I'm not in any way putting you down for it, as you seem to be doing. Now that it's mine, however, I wish to make it more to my liking, which I feel needs to begin with eradicating it's current smell as well as I am able without damaging the pipe, if possible. Smoking 10 bowls of ""Hobbit's Weed"" in it, as you so emphatically put it, isn't an option as I would not find it pleasurable to smoke 10 bowls of anything in a pipe that delivers an unpleasant flavor with every puff. I do plan to try the cotton ball/alcohol technique, as /u/blenheim45 and /u/jarvis400 suggested. If I ruin the pipe, it's my loss and you can say I told you so. I'd rather be friends, though, and consider this another learning experience in my still new hobby. Peace, man.  EDIT: Just saw this post of yours over on /r/pipehogs: ""How I Feel When I Receive A Message About A Nice Meer I Just Sold Saying The First Bowl They Smoked Was Hobbit's Weed And THEY Will Have To De-ghost The Pipe!""

PipeTobacco,3a5hf9,bonehed,2,Thu Jun 18 01:08:32 2015 UTC,"Always found this humorous - ''The name Alco came about when Falcon first began distributing Falcon in the UK. George Hunt, realising that Comoy had a line of pipes with that name, and not wishing to infringe any copyright had a think about it. The decision was to rework the stems, buffing out the F and N from FALCON as the thickness of the aluminium was sufficent. They could not remove the name completely without damaging the pipe. In the end the trade mark issue was settled, as it was not even an issue with Comoy. The name Falcon went forward in UK and ALCO was kept as the name for another line of Falcon pipes, the ones with the smaller thread''"

PipeTobacco,3a33b2,IUseExtraCommas,3,Wed Jun 17 02:20:20 2015 UTC,"Brighams are funny that way.  I have yet to run across a ""non-system"" Brigham, although I know they exist [see there is one right above].  I think it was an earlier attempt to break the US market open, where there was a certain prejudice against filtered pipes, which were seen as ""cheap"" like Dr. Grabows and Medicos.  Yes they turned out stalwart factory pipes, but... they also had the President's Series which were primarily free hands and carved by Herb Brigham who was the President of the company, out of ""special"" pieces of briar as they came through the shop.  a lot were given out as presentation pieces by the company, or so I understand.    They also accepted special orders for pipes, and I believe I have one in my hands as I speak.  Model #9999.  As the Brigham rep says.. ""but we did not make a model 9999 or 999 or for that matter if you were inclined to think it was stamped upside down do the same with sixes.  But I believe that the forth number  ""9"" designates and oversize pipe, as I have had another larger than usual Brigham which had a four digit # also ending in 9.    This one is a Lovat shape (or ""club"" shape as Brigham defined it) which should be shape #19. [a one dot is 119, 2 dot 219, etc.]  This has the ""three dots"" in a line (horizontal) with small-large-small dots which would signify the ""V.I.P. series of pipes, which was there highest line of pipes in the 60's."

PipeTobacco,3a33b2,Makaaberi,2,Thu Jun 18 03:08:49 2015 UTC,"Well, out of my dwindling stable I guess the this Radice might be my favourite.  The shape is in the style of a classic British factory made half bent billiard and perhaps nothing too exciting, but the thing is I can't find nothing that would annoy me about it. The dimensions are perfectly to my liking. It's a shape that is really hard to make well, mostly because people have often a preconceived idea on how this shape should look like.   Sometimes the pipe's aesthetical value apppears, not from the first impression, but builds from the longer relationship with a pipe. I really haven't found anything wrong with it. Yet.  It smokes well, too.  EDIT: For comparison, here's a current photo of the same pipe."

Don't put water directly on them.  There are other methods, but that one works well for me.  If the tobacco is moldy, ie has hair and smells like crap, don't buy it.  If the tins are rusted and there is rust dust on the tobacco, don't smoke it.  These aren't legendary blends that I'm aware of (despite what the tin says), just old tobacco.  Would be cool just to have the tins if you are into that sort of thing."

PipeTobacco,3a3p23,blenheim45,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:52:14 2015 UTC,"Hard to say. i would not be tempted by the Dutchman, as I don't care for aromatics and they suffer most long term aging.  The Gallaner's might well tempt me, and since it has already been opened you can take a peak (I assume).    If as /u/jimjimwest notes there is something on the tobacco, you need to figure out whether it is mold (not acceptable) or ""bloom"".  The latter is the result of sugars crystallizing on the tobacco as it ages, and looks quite different from mold with a bit of magnification.  I use a vegetable steamer for rehydration, generally one goes in the microwave.  heat the water in the covered steamer, take out, add tobacco on a paper coffee filter to steaming rack, replace lid.  30 to 60 seconds generally will take care of the deed and you are good to go.    Use the pinch test, by pinching the tobacco.  If it holds the shape of the pinch it is too moist (but we all know how to cure that don't wee?), if it crumbles it is too dry, if it springs back open from the pinch (all be it perhaps slowly) then it should be about right to smoke."

Balkans are usually defined as having Orientals in a more prominent role in the blend but the distinction between Balkan and English blends is pretty hazy in general.   In any case there actually aren't very many blends out there that are simply virginia and latakia. Although Mclellands Contest Blend seems to be quite close to what you're smoking already.

I got it monday and loaded up a cob full of the dark english right away, it is really tasty, and cery similar to the FM blends. Really nice McC virginia tang in there too. I will definitely be purchasing more of it when It's gone! Thanks as well for the FMC, it was my first English and is dear to me, one of my favorites for a nice cool evening on the porch.. let me know how those blends turn out for you as well, i really liked the Boswells but not much of an aro guy generally speaking.   Have a good one, and thanks again for the trade!"

PipeTobacco,3a1jfl,chewsyourownadv,2,Tue Jun 16 14:36:12 2015 UTC,"Morta is pretty cool. In terms of flavor and smoking it's similar to briar. You have to keep it fry inside. This isn't a pipe to forget half a bowl in for a week. Sometimes excess moisture can cause soft spots and damage the pipe. That having been said though, you can smoke it again as soon as it's dry much like meerschaum, so it's easy for a morta to become your daily desk companion and provide something to smoke when you're doing a deep clean cycle on the others.   Foe me, I want to have pipes of every kind, so not having one yet was reason enough. Here's my previous post about the one I bought. It smokes great."

She gets genuinely annoyed and for the life of me i don't understand why. I have only been steadily smoking a pipe since January but right now i have probably around 30 pipes. 3 Savinellis, 3 Petersons, a Stanwell, a Nording, a Big Ben, a handful of no name basket pipes (Made in Turkey, Italy, Czech, Greece) and lots of MM Cobs. Right now i'm in a dangerous PAD frenzy. Don't let the lady in your life keep you from your pipes but more importantly, don't let your pipes keep you from your lady because at the end of the day she will stay by your side while you smoke the days troubles away."

PipeTobacco,3a1ej2,tennesseean_87,3,Wed Jun 17 00:18:39 2015 UTC,My wife said exactly this. I asked how many pairs of shoes she owned. She admitted defeat.  I have about 25 pipes.   Only use about 7 favourites in regular rotation.
PipeTobacco,3a1ej2,apechef,2,Wed Jun 17 08:58:10 2015 UTC,"I scored a couple of boxes of estates at a flea market. Never officially counted tham so I am able to ""import"" another pipe without the boss knowing. Seriously though I have no idea guessing more than 70-less than 100, but it is way more than than any practical rotation needs. Yes I have a bit of a problem.."
PipeTobacco,3a1ej2,Riquaphugee,2,Tue Jun 16 16:00:29 2015 UTC,"My wife, bless her soul, has never questioned my new hobby, even though I've bought 19 new and estate pipes since I started in February. They include pipes by Savinelli, Stanwell, Peterson, Big Ben, SMS, Butt Choquin, Jeantet, Comoy, and more.   I'm drawn to beautiful and interesting looking pipes. She'll occasionally ooh and aah over some particular pipe when I'm cleaning it. I even sat her down one day and showed her each pipe and what was special about each one and she responded with polite enthusiasm and even asked questions.   What's so remarkable about the whole thing is that my wife is staunchly against smoking of any kind. She lost multiple relatives who smoked cigarettes to cancer and emphysema. She really would rather I not smoke, but she never pressures me to stop, her only rule being not in the house where it will stink up the drapes. I feel sheepish quite often because I've got TAD and PAD very bad and have spent way too much money in too little time on it. But I am having a great time with it and I always take care of her in many ways and she's known since I married her 30 years ago that I have lots of hobbies. She is truly the best sport I know and all of my pipes love her for the home she's let me give them."
PipeTobacco,3a1ej2,star_boy2005,2,Tue Jun 16 17:54:50 2015 UTC,"I have about 15 non cob pipes. Honestly, I have considered selling  most of them, because those cheap mm cobs smoke so well, and I often grab one instead of a briar.   I have about 30 cobs thanks to those bags of smokable seconds."
PipeTobacco,3a1ej2,levins0,2,Tue Jun 16 18:18:07 2015 UTC,"I only have 8, which may seem like nothing but I guess it's more to the fact that I am a cheap ass. For the longest time I survived with only 2 but over the past few years I've added to my rotation. In my lonely collection I have one pipe that I like to smoke only Aromatics which is a Sandblasted MasterCraft, but I still like my Dr. Grabow's too for go to pipes.   Although I was thinking about buying a new pipe for my next birthday."
PipeTobacco,3a1ej2,Kofcandre,2,Tue Jun 16 21:03:58 2015 UTC,"I usually hover around 15 to 20. Once I get a I've 20 or so I sell off some pipes on eBay that I tend to not use a lot. I've owned about 35 or so pipes over the years. While most of my early ones have been sold there are a few of my firsts that I'll probably never sell (such as my Peterson Kenmare Bulldog from around '05).  To me, it's natural to not have more than 20 or so, for me to manage in my head."
PipeTobacco,3a1ej2,jackstiofain,2,Tue Jun 16 21:36:32 2015 UTC,"I find myself doing this.  I keep the pipes I really enjoy smoking, and pass on the pipes that I don't.  So far I have 5 pipes that I will never sell (one of which doesn't smoke worth a damn but I've had it since I was about 22 or so, a custom meer in the likeness of Einstein.  The carving is great, but mechanics are not.) and I have around 5 pipes I will likely ultimately trade / sell someday.  My pipe cabinet has more slots, but it already feels cluttered.    Then again, I'm not the sort who enjoys china or collectables in a cabinet.  I like tools I actually use."

PipeTobacco,3a1ej2,star_boy2005,2,Wed Jun 17 20:57:12 2015 UTC,"Not complicated, but eBay charges you once a month depending on how much money you made. Like 5 to 10%, I think. I just use my phone, type the description and upload the pics. Also, you won't get the money right away, takes about a week to 10 days."

PipeTobacco,39zwmw,JakofBlades,2,Tue Jun 16 13:24:16 2015 UTC,"This was my very first tobacco when I got my very first pipe in February of this year. It was one of few tobaccos that my local store had so I wasn't expecting it to be very good.  I was still figuring out packing techniques and how the whole pipe smoking thing worked, so I had no idea what to expect for taste, smell, room note, whatever. I think we all remember our first pipe tobacco?   Anyways, it's mid-June and I'm still no expert, but I've tried about 6 different tobaccos. After letting the Royal dry out it smoked much better than when I bought it. I'm fairly certain it's because it dried out and not because I was a total noob.   Anyways, I quite liked it in the end. However I still can't seem to taste anything when smoking pipes. Does anybody have any tips? My pipe is a Dr. Grabow Omega, I've smoked Captain Black Royal, McClelland; Just Plain Nut, VBC, Rum Toddy, Georgia Cream, and another unknown brand of Rum Butter. I've read on here that aromatics won't have a noticeable taste."
PipeTobacco,39zwmw,bigcat318,2,Tue Jun 16 23:16:05 2015 UTC,"That is, sadly the size of it. Some tips:   Try non-aromatics. Grab a balkan blend (Sutliff Bosphorous Cruise is my go to right now, but everyone has their favorite), a VaPer(H&H Anniversary Kake and Orlik Golden Sliced are good places to start), and a traditional English (Dunhill 965 is nearly the definition of). These have distinct, bold flavors that you won't need a flashlight and a shovel to find. Try the breath smoking technique: put the pipe your mouth and breath through your nose. Don't pull. Every 2-3 breaths, exhale. Works wonder on aros. Develop your palate. This takes more time, but really get into tasting everything - coffee, beer, whisky, your food, tea, smoke some cigars. The more things you taste the more you will be able to taste the things you taste."
PipeTobacco,39zwmw,bigcat318,2,Tue Jun 16 23:44:05 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for the tips! I'm trying to develop a palate with tobacco and whiskey right now.

PipeTobacco,39x6hg,mutantturkey,2,Mon Jun 15 18:15:38 2015 UTC,I don't see this working. The categories are vague and difficult to clarify. How many pipes do I have to carve before I can get the crafter flair? Do I have to sell them or can it be for personal use? Do kits count? What exactly constitutes a repair? Is sanding off some rim char enough? How many of those do I have to do? Do I even have to to a good job with any of this? Who verifies that? What if I'm a pipe maker and an awesome trader? What if I repair pipes and sell them?
PipeTobacco,39x6hg,Piffyr,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:59:59 2015 UTC,"As I tried to state somewhere in other comments there should be a significant amount of 'evidence' in the subreddit before anyone can claim to deserve any flair. Repairing is the most demanding I think, fixing up to use is not the same as scavenging and saving some old crummy pipes, and again there must have been quite a few under that users belt before going pro flair. There's always a possibility for trainee flairs; who knows?  Then again, if we don't try we'll never know."

I have been an off again on again pipe smoker since 2012 but it wasn't until just now that I got back into it and decided to get serious about it. Also, you can get some situations where a person may have been smoking a pipe for the last ten years, but only smoked one kind of tobacco, so while they are experienced at smoking a pipe they might not have any more knowledge about different kinds of tobacco than I am."
PipeTobacco,39x6hg,shavinghobbit,2,Mon Jun 15 16:37:57 2015 UTC,"That is easily solvable, based on sub activity mods and other flair'ed users can more or less grasp if it fits the bill. If it's not on the interwebs it don't count."
PipeTobacco,39uu8j,hcwatson87,3,Sun Jun 14 23:52:20 2015 UTC,"Pipe: bowl width is a determining factor in how mild/strong a blend may seem. Smaller bowls also help if a blend has too much nicotine for you. I'd say medium width would be about 13/16"", 3/4"" would be smaller side and 5/8-11/16 definitely small. 7/8"" would be slightly large and anything bigger I'd say would be very large. The depth will impact the length of smoke you get. You can always pack half-bowls, though. I'd also consider whether you'll be clenching or holding the pipe in your hand. If you clench, shorter, lighter, more heavily bent pipes will be easier on the jaw. If you're holding it, buy whatever you like the look of.   Tobacco: I think even mild cigars aren't as mild as the mildest pipe tobaccos (though I haven't smoked a cigar in some time). Are you looking for something similar to cigars, or are you really trying to get a completely different experience? If you want something similar or reminiscent of cigars, some blends have cigar leaf in them, and others have different tobaccos that are more or less similar in flavor (Burley and sun-cured leaf come to mind, possibly KY blends). If you want something completely different, aromatics are often mild and usually very sweet with a flavor additive more or less dominant over the tobacco. VAs and VA-Perique blends tend to be naturally somewhat sweet (but not as much as most aromatics) with some hay, grass, fruit, bready, or spicy notes depending on the blend. English blends have a more exotic flavor often reminiscent of a piney campfire, though some are more like a VA with a little of that flavor. You can also get blends that hang out between these catgories or combine them, so a complete taxonomy would get really lengthy.   You can find recommendations of each genre in the FAQ or just ask here about which genres sound interesting if you want my opinion."
PipeTobacco,39uu8j,tennesseean_87,2,Mon Jun 15 00:11:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much. I'm not really looking for a cigar taste, I'm wanting to branch out and find something with more flavor. I saw a post on here about Hobbits Weed, I looked it up and it sounds tasty, something along the lines of what I'm looking for. What are your thoughts on this?"
PipeTobacco,39uu8j,tennesseean_87,3,Mon Jun 15 00:16:40 2015 UTC,"I've never had that one. It's an aromatic, right? If you really want to branch out, try a little of each: Aromatic, English, VA, and a lighter Burley with little-to-no topping. Give each one a fair chance and remember that after smoking a while your taste may change some, so keep leftovers around in jars if you can to try again in 6 months or a year (or get more). Once you find what you like you can explore each in more depth."
PipeTobacco,39uu8j,the_costello_show,6,Mon Jun 15 00:36:01 2015 UTC,"Just about everyone will recommend a cob pipe as your first, with good reason. Missouri Meerschaum makes good pipes in a pretty extensive array of styles to fit most tastes, and you can try different styles to find what suits you best before you invest in a comparable briar.   As for tobacco, I'd start with the ""drug store"" blends or some of the online retailer's ""house blends"" to get an idea of what type of tobacco suits you. Most of these are reasonably priced and you can get them in small (one ounce) quantities. Once you sample enough types of tobacco, you can start to refine your own taste and start venturing into higher-quality blends and brands with confidence. I'll warn you in advance: don't be lured into a certain brand or blend simply because other people tell you it's a great: the best latakia blend in the world isn't going to appeal to you if you find you can't stand latakia.   Take your time and have fun!"
PipeTobacco,39uu8j,carnesy,3,Mon Jun 15 01:23:12 2015 UTC,"Ask to pull the stem from the shank (or have them do it for you) and check the drilling on the pipe, I love Peterson's, they make up the majority of my collection, but some of the drilling on their recent stock is horrid. If the hole in the shank to the bowl is too far off center from where the hole in the stem will line up put it back and look at another. It doesn't have to be dead center but the closer the better.   Off drilled airways cause condensation in the stem which leads to gurgling and random draws of tobacco juice. Of course this can be remedied by sticking a cleaner down the stem mid smoke but better to minimize the occurrence of this in the first place. This is generally not an issue with straight pipes but the greater the bend the more likely it could be an issue.  EDIT: This is really not an issue with their System pipes or those with military style mounts since those stems are designed for condensation to occur and to be removed mid smoke so swabbing can be done as needed, as opposed to your typical style stem which should not be removed from the shank until the pipe has cooled."

PipeTobacco,39smrh,butter_bee,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:17:45 2015 UTC,There is a little rubber gasket-like ring around the perimeter of the lid. Problems with tins can range from the seal breaking to rust forming on the inside. 30+ years is a long time for nothing to have gone wrong.

I realize it is a sealed 35 year old tin, but that seems like a lot of cash for a small amount of tobacco.  I guess that's just how supply and demand works. I'm even willing to admit I might even be a little jealous that I don't have that kind of money to spend. I am still new enough to this hobby that I can't appreciate the value of certain things, even Dunhill pipes still give me sticker shock.

PipeTobacco,39smrh,bonehed,4,Sun Jun 14 15:59:57 2015 UTC,"That's the most amusing part about it. Latakia looses it's bit after 10 or 15 years. I have some Robusto by Pease from '06 that's incredible, but I'd have been pissed upon opening it if I was a Latakia nut. The smoke is there, but mellow, and subdued. It's like guys paying thousands for century old wine. That shit's vinegar, and amount showing on the price tag will change it or make a person any less a fool for buying it because they think it's going to be good.   Now if it's being bought purely for rarity as a collector’s item? Have at. It's a neat find provided someone could prove it's authentic."

I've never even seen one of these before, but Pipestud confirmed that it is from the 1980s, when Penzance first appeared.""  They did not offer any evidence on how pipestud confirmed it was from the 80s. The seller may have looked at a picture found on their website. No sort of documentation was provided.   When I start spending money on this scale I really like to see things in person or have a third party certify it somehow.   Deep down I really hope the buyer got what they paid for.

PipeTobacco,39rokr,PeskyPrussian,7,Sun Jun 14 02:31:05 2015 UTC,It has been my experience that toothpaste with baking soda is better than standard minty types for neutralizing pipe/smoke breath.
PipeTobacco,39rokr,Weenie,3,Sun Jun 14 02:56:57 2015 UTC,Take this one step further and make a mix of baking soda and peroxide to brush your whole mouth with followed by a minty mouthwash to rinse the grit out.  The peroxide will destroy most of the top layer of cells that have been most heavily effected by the carcinogens in the smoke reducing risk of oral maladies (I think) and clear the taste from the tobacco while whitening your teeth. The alcohol in the wash will get most of the rest while clearing the grit from the soda mix and freshen your breath since baking soda and peroxide mouth isn't too pleasent either... Or so I'm told.  But I'm just a stranger on the internet so take this with a grain or two of salt as your mileage may vary.

PipeTobacco,39qunb,tennesseean_87,2,Sun Jun 14 02:56:30 2015 UTC,"I would tell a skeptic to run a small, short experiment:    Buy a ounce of McClleland Red Cake 5100, and one of Newminster Navy Flake.  Jar those babies. Wait 5-6 months Order another ounce of each tobacco Smoke the fresh and the aged side by side. You will be astounded by how much richer, sweeter, and complex the tobacco, with just 6 months on it, is compared to factory fresh.    The mechanisms of aging are not well understood and we shouldn't speculate. What would be more interesting than investigating the primary cause is to experiment with the variables to see if you can speed up the process. I really don't think tobacco companies are holding back research. It is more reasonable to assume they haven't been funding any on aging all that time - I mean, why would they? Aging costs money, which is why it has mostly been pushed onto the consumer to age cigars and pipe tobacco."
PipeTobacco,39qunb,antiwittgenstein,2,Sun Jun 14 16:48:00 2015 UTC,Number 2 is the correct answer. All that shelf space does not come cheap.
PipeTobacco,39qunb,hedonaut,2,Mon Jun 15 19:48:14 2015 UTC,"Do you have any ""proof"" that could convince any skeptic that aging tobacco can improve its qualities beyond your own senses of taste and smell?   Tobacco undergoes some changes. It can be checked with a simple if not long experiment. The fact whether the seal in a tin that was stored long enough was broken or not becomes apparent right after the tin is opened.   Whether the changes are for better or for worse, it's the matter of personal preferences. The only solid conclusion I came up with from my own experience is that if I didn't like tobacco fresh, I'm not going to like it aged. Everything else, including whether I'm going to like more tobacco, which I like fresh, is variable. This at least means that whatever changes are happening under the cover they do not sum up to a single parameter: good/bad.  Give it some time. After a while you'll smoke your share of aged tobacco to see everything for yourself."
PipeTobacco,39qunb,haharisma,3,Sun Jun 14 20:17:57 2015 UTC,"Since when is empirical evidence not valid proof? Why would a paper with findings based on observations be more valid than our current findings based on observations?   I get that people tend not to conduct experiments with the same methods of scientific professionals, but the vast amount of tobacco user data and the ability to, with relative ease, test the theory for yourself makes the need for ""proof"" seem pointless. We have proof. Smoke some aged tobacco. There's your proof.   Now, ""why?"" is an interesting question. It most likely has a lot to do with tobacco's natural oils reacting with air. Cigars do this sort of thing as well. Those oils seeping out and crystallizing is the believed cause for tobacco plume, one of the most desirable signs of aged tobacco."
PipeTobacco,39qunb,Mordenkrad,3,Sat Jun 13 23:52:58 2015 UTC,"Skeptics are very unwilling to accept anything without an objective proof. I agree that the taste and smell senses of many pipe-smokers are as good measuring instruments as any machine built by an engineer. The only problem is they are subjective and therefore can be influenced by the individual's own state.  Anyway, I agree we do not need a precise and technologically advanced measure of the variables that determine the aging of a tobacco to just enjoy it and realize it is better than before. One of the reasons I posted this was that I have read comments from skeptics that believe we actually are self-induced to think that tobacco really ages. But that's how skeptic's mind works..."

PipeTobacco,39pmlw,Cycleoflife,4,Sat Jun 13 15:02:25 2015 UTC,"How can I identify the stem material? I read here about the properties of vulcanite vs lucite vs acrylic, etc. But without examples in front of me, how do I know what I have?"
PipeTobacco,39pmlw,Piffyr,5,Sun Jun 14 04:04:21 2015 UTC,"Appearance and ""feel"" are the best identifiers though sometimes it's not easy. Vulcanite is always black and has a very slight bit of give to it between the teeth. It's easy to put a dent or scratch in vulcanite by biting down on it. Acrylic (and there are many more varieties than just lucite) comes in a variety of colors and has very little give between the teeth. It's much more difficult to dent acrylic when biting down on it.  Then, there's a whole host of materials that are less widely used but still not uncommon: Plastic (feels like chewing on a pen. found on cobs), ABS (found on lower end pipes. a feel somewhere between vulcanite and plastic; typically dark gray to black in color), Bakelite/Redmanol (only found on old pipes. softer than acrylic but harder than vulcanite and typically red, amber, or smoke gray in color), horn (looks like bone, typically with striations of light and dark color), amber (cloudy gold in color and comes in a wide variety of ""feels""; some as hard as glass others soft like plastic), nylon (a feel similar to plastic but a little harder), and I'm sure there are plenty more that I'm not thinking of at the moment."
PipeTobacco,39pmlw,blenheim45,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:13:55 2015 UTC,"The most commonly used are rubber, aka vulcanite and various trade names ebonite, etc. The Vulcan part comes from vulcanization which is part of making rubber moldable for manufacturing.  It is softer and therefore generally more comfortable, but rubber has sulfur, and it discolors with exposure to UV and various chemicals, including some that naturally occur in saliva.  so it scratches easier and discolors.  Plastics cover a lot of ground and various names also, such as bakelite.  Much cheaper material for the manufacturers, but not as readily worked and ""refined"", as what you get coming out of the mold tends to be what you use.  Acrylics are newer, much lower upkeep (no sulfur to worry about), a whole range of colors and effects with those colors, but not the same comfort level for the habitual ""clenching"" pipe smoker.  Acrylic (by any of its names, lucite, etc.) can be worked much as rubber can, and it is popular in higher end pipe making for the various effects that can be created with the  material.  Horn and amber are no longer common, and can be expensive alternatives, except in rare situations.  Amber is probably the most fragile stem material, and has become comparative rare as a raw material since it is fossilized tree resin, and they have not been fossilizing many trees recently.  Nylon never really caught on as a stem material, as it was never all that much easier to work , nor had any other outstanding benefits to it."

PipeTobacco,39pmlw,LegesAequitas,2,Sun Jun 14 15:51:55 2015 UTC,"It's a very safe bet to say that it has an acrylic stem. Savinellis are made almost exclusively with acrylic stems.  Edit: I may be wrong on this one. Smokingpipes.com shows it as having a vulcanite stem, but pipesandcigars.com shows that series as using acrylic. I'm leaning toward thinking that your pipe might have a vulcanite stem as Smoking Pipes usually has more accurate listings and there were a few other places listing it as having a vulcanite stem."

It is an ""underslung pipe"" which was sold with the tag line ""because water can't run uphill"".  It incorporates an expansion chamber to cool and dry the smoke and takes the air off from above the camber at a level almost at the height of the top of the bowl.  As you can see from the patent illustration there are four major pieces: Bowl (threaded), bottom plug (threaded); shank / outer bowl (threaded two places); and of course a stem (unknown if it too is threaded, but if it is then part 3 is threaded yet one more time).  Lyons was a machinist who had lost an arm in work accident during WWI, which in the 1920s meant that he was basically unemployable and without an income.  He invented and was making the pipes in a shed at his house.    Then he sent a pipe to politician General Charles Dawes when he saw him smoking a pipe.  Dawes liked the pipe, and the men became friends.  Dawes gave the pipes away when he was running for vice President (1924 with Calvin Coolidge ) and the pipes became known as the Dawe's pipes, and orders jumped to 75,000 while Lyons was turning out at most 1000 a month...  I personally would love to get my hands on one of these (cheaply)as they look really interesting, and I like ""interesting"" pipe variations.    And /u/arommmatic the downfall of these pies was not their lack of popularity, if anything the problems were limited manufacturing not keeping up with demand and the complexity of design compared to other pipes. imho"
PipeTobacco,39pmlw,FuerzaGallos,2,Sun Jun 14 03:53:47 2015 UTC,"I've never smoked a Lyons pipe but a couple of friends who have smoked it both told me they didn't like it at all.  My opinion about the downfall of that pipe:   That pipe doesn't smoke well. It's a pain in the rear to clean. Was a novelty and* when the novelty was gone, people loose interest."
PipeTobacco,39pmlw,antiwittgenstein,2,Sun Jun 14 10:38:18 2015 UTC,"What is unclesr to me is how the smoke moves from  the holes in bottom of the bowl to the expansion chamber, and then back up to the shank and out.  Some how that smoke has to go from that area below the bowl back up to the shank, but the drawings don't make it obvious to me. The bowl seems to be threaded a long way down, which eliminates one obvious path... although I think that has to be the path, some how. .. or there is a drilled channel hidden in the outer bowl wall.  As to being a pain to clean, remember this pipe was developed and introduced in the period shortly after the introduction of ""pipe cleaners"", and many pipe innovations were designed to make cleaning easier, such as Dunhill's ""innertube"" pipes.  Dunhill's answer had been to put a metal tube that went from the stem down the shank and stopped with an angle cut that fit the hole at the bottom of the bowl.  When the bowl was dirty you replaced the ""inner-tube"".  Whether you cleaned it (probably by soaking in a solvent like alcohol and running string through it) or discarded it was at the option of the smoker.  We have trouble imagining a time when ""pipe cleaners"" were relatively unknown and not readily available, but at that time there were a lot of pipes designed to ""make cleaning easier"" and a pipe that could be separated into pieces for easy cleaning was a popular  approach.  the thing about these complicated designs is there are so many small ways for them to go wrong and to suddenly not smoke right.  I have seen pipes where it was a small bit of tobacco or a bit of fluff from a pipe cleaner that was caught in the air channel that made the pipe gurgle like a boarding house drain.  Remove the obstacle and suddenly the pipe performed like new.  They say that every man has a great idea That Will NOT Work!, and the period between the 1920s and 1950s saw a lot of them built in the pipe industry.  If the Falcon style pipe with its metal ""radiator"" was a good ideal, then surely running that metal air channel is an ""S"" so it had triple the length for cooling was a better idea...NOT.  Talk about a pipe that will not pass a pipe cleaner.  LOL  the 1920's saw both photographs and moving pictures (as in news reels) become common daily fare, and Dawes started as a popular business and political leader.  He lost his political luster when he missed an important tie breaking vote in the Senate as vice President (he had gone to take a nap) which saw a major Presidential appointment fail, and then later as the Depression hit, not many bankers were held in much popularity.  But before that he was well known, having designed the WWI reparations package, and was a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.  His image with this novel looking pipe made it an early example of product placement and endorsement, and Dawes himself became a partner in the company making the pipes."
PipeTobacco,39pmlw,LegesAequitas,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:46:32 2015 UTC,"Great post.  Just to clarify, that pipe has a lot of extra holes prone to be clogged, that's why I said is a pain to clean or is almost certainly a bad smoker."

PipeTobacco,39pmlw,FuerzaGallos,2,Mon Jun 15 13:02:38 2015 UTC,"I was waiting for this thread! As I said in the last thread I made I got my starter kit a few days ago and it has been kinda hard to get the technique right... could use some help.  I tried to start with the McClelland 5100 but I should have anticipated that even after reading a lot about lighting your pipe and smoking it it was not going to be that easy, so long story short I messed it up and ended up with a hard plug of tobacco that wouldn't let me light all the tobacco underneath it, now I am aware that that happened because I was smoking too fast but I was smoking like that because I was trying to keep the pipe lit! So I guess my problem is mostly with lighting the pipe, I tried to dry the tobacco a little bit before smoking it but it was a humid day so I am almost certain it was not as dry as it is supposed to be, so  I just kept on removing the hard tobacco plug that was forming and tried to smoke what was underneath it but the same happened because of my lack of technique so I just ended up wasting a bowl of a good blend.  A few days after that I grabbed my pipe again and packed it with 1Q cause there ain't no way I am wasting any more 5100 or any other good blend untill I get my technique right... so I packed it, left it like that for about 20 minutes and then tried to light it, this time it was way easier! I circled the match above the tobacco while taking medium strengh puffs (not sure if that's the right term) so to also charr the tobacco that was under the top layer of tobacco, took my tamper and tamped down using only the weight of the tamper over the tobacco, then used another match to do the real light, this time I took about five medium strengh puffs and then the tobacco kind of caught fire which I don't think is correct... but I kept puffing and the fire went out and there was a lot of smoke so I considered the pipe to be lit, I tamped down a little bit more and started smoking; this time I went real slow and taking my time with it and surprisingly it went pretty good!.. for the first half of the bowl though, I produced a very nice soft ash, there was a cool dry smoke and a nice smell coming from the pipe but then I got to the middle of the pipe and it started to go out, I removed some ash with the spoon of the tamper and I tried to relight it but I kept failing at it and started producing once again that god damn hard tobacco plug that gives me an ashy taste and a not so pleasant smell, so that probably the top of the pipe was well dried but the bottom wasn't and that's why it happened. So now I guess I need to really dry my tobacco even more than whatever I think is right.  Any ways sorry for such a long post, I would like to hear any tips you can give me about getting better technique overall.  TL;DR: I smoked too fast the first time because I couldn't keep my pipe lit so it all sucked, later I dried my tobacco inside of the pipe which provided me with a better experience that let me go slow on the pipe for the first half of the bowl and a lame tongue biting experience for the rest of it."
PipeTobacco,39pmlw,FuerzaGallos,5,Sat Jun 13 18:59:23 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the hobby! You sound like are making a good start. My immediate suggestion is to get your tobacco prep right.   Drying - to accelerate drying (or make possible under humid conditions) use heat and airflow - put it under a lamp and in front of a fan. I would say, at least for the summer, dry a minimum of 20 minutes before smoking. The tobacco should still be pliable, not crispy, but it should not be moist to the touch. Pipe loading - There are many loading techniques and you should attempt them all, especially here at the beginning. This guy has the best collection of packing videos I have seen, where he explains the physics behind smoking, shows you how the various loading methods for various pipe cuts work, and gives good advice for how to attempt process in general. The loading videos start at #46.   The first thing you should try is the scoop'n'fill:    Test the airflow of the empty pipe. Do this over a clean table, plate, tray etc. It is messy. Make a pile of tobacco in your non-dominate hand. Invert the pipe over the mound. Be gentle. Swirl the pipe over the pile. The pipe won't be able to eat all of, don't try to make it. Right the pipe. Test the airflow. Should be no different than the empty pipe.   This should give you a light, even pack. Gently touch the tobacco. Feel that springy pushback? That is what a proper loading should feel like.  After you get that one to work, try the Frank method."
PipeTobacco,39pmlw,levins0,3,Sat Jun 13 21:03:08 2015 UTC,"You've given some great advice, but the link to the video isn't showing up so give it an edit. It looks like you were trying to set up a link to Kel's intro videos which I think are great. : )"

PipeTobacco,39pmlw,FuerzaGallos,2,Sat Jun 13 21:29:23 2015 UTC,thanks!
PipeTobacco,39pmlw,star_boy2005,3,Sun Jun 14 06:40:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks! great advice, I've found that definitly drying your tobacco works wonders. Also I've been packing my pipe without any actual method so I guess I will start practicing that frank method."
PipeTobacco,39pmlw,thedirtybook,4,Sun Jun 14 06:39:50 2015 UTC,Others have given some great advice and links. The only thing I'll reiterate is that it sounds like you are packing too tightly. Try to put less in the pipe and see if that helps.
PipeTobacco,39pmlw,Piffyr,3,Sun Jun 14 00:45:45 2015 UTC,"Sounds good! As I said previously pipe smoking will likely take a good bit of practice and trial and error before you start to get everything right, but I think that's part of the fun in being a beginner. You'll come to find your own style and way of doing things. Just remember that packing the tobacco lightly is not an issue at all, just use your tamper after lighting to get the tobacco to the right packing density. Just take your time, relight when you need to, and  enjoy the process.   You've probably been doing a good bit of searching around for information on the hobby and YouTube is an especially good place. Kel has a good set of introductory videos, which contain a good number of packing videos. I don't always agree with his tastes and recommendations for tobacco, but that's not a big deal. I'm not the biggest fan of Jayson Dagner, but I think he has a great intro video and has good taste in tobacco (in my opinion). There's a guy named Jeff who also has a good amount of intro videos and it's very accessible for beginners, here's his video on packing. Hope this is helpful!"
PipeTobacco,39pmlw,bboyer1987,3,Sat Jun 13 20:10:16 2015 UTC,"Those videos are very helpful, specially the packing one, I think my packing is not that bad to be honest but I still need to make it better haha I just think that I am not drying the tobacco enough, thank you!"
PipeTobacco,39pmlw,PipeBeard,3,Sun Jun 14 06:41:53 2015 UTC,"A video that does a good job of demonstrating how to pack a pipe loosely is one recently posted by u/briarboy. I've started using this technique and it is far superior, in my opinion, to the oft recommended ""three stage"" method. It's possible though that in only works properly with ribbon cut tobacco. I haven't tried it with flake or other cuts."
PipeTobacco,39pmlw,blenheim45,2,Sun Jun 14 03:52:44 2015 UTC,"Hey fellow Pipers, I have a few newbie questions here; 1. How dry should aromatics be when I pack them into my pipe? 2. What are good newbie non-aromatic blends. 3.My pipe tobacco taste really sour when smoked. I use PS ""Peaches and cream"" It tastes really good for the first few puffs then tastes really sour."
PipeTobacco,39pmlw,tennesseean_87,3,Sun Jun 14 04:32:58 2015 UTC,"Dry enough that it doesn't stick together when you pinch it, but not so dry that it crumbles. This goes for all tobacco, not just aromatics. It can be a little harder to achieve with aros since they often have syrupy toppings. Start with a drying time of about 30 minutes and then adjust as necessary. I think Dunhill My Mixture 965 is a good intro to Englishes, Newminster Superior Navy Flake is a good, no fuss, no muss intro to Virginia Flake, and Peter Stokkebye Luxury Bullseye Flake is a decent VaPer intro. Slow down."

(I say probably because Peretti's burley blends give it a real run for its money).  ODF is one of the all time greats, and I definitely recommend pulling that trigger, but it's not one that I would immediately think of as giving a ton of insight into what burley is all about. I haven't had the other two, so I couldn't say."
PipeTobacco,39ny2f,PipeBeard,2,Sat Jun 13 03:23:33 2015 UTC,"I think you should differentiate between Burley and DFK. Most Burley is air-cured, and the fire-cured variety has a distinct taste that sets it apart. It would be the same as not differentiating Latakia from other oriental varieties."
PipeTobacco,39ny2f,tennesseean_87,2,Sat Jun 13 15:53:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good point.  This articulates what I was trying to say a bit better."
PipeTobacco,39ny2f,PipeBeard,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:18:16 2015 UTC,I was going to grab the Solani but it was on back order. I will for sure be getting some in the future. The Potlatch isn't particularly burley forward ...at all really. I just really wanted to try it because I love their Deception Pass and wanted to try more of their blends. It does have burley in it though.
PipeTobacco,39ny2f,carnesy,2,Sat Jun 13 03:38:28 2015 UTC,Sorry to be off topic but I don't really have much experience with Burley blends. However I am reasonably educated in English/Balkan blends so I'll give my unsolicited (and maybe unwanted) advice and tell you to throw a tin of Mac Baren HH Vintage Syrian and a tin of Ashton Artisan's Blend either in addition to/instead of some of those English Blends. Or keep them in mind for your next order.
PipeTobacco,39ny2f,Comintern,2,Sat Jun 13 03:32:42 2015 UTC,I recently branched into burley with some Haunted Bookshop and Three Friars. They're bulk blends from C&D and I can't recommend them enough. I've been puffing them nonstop they're really nice. Three Friars is a sweet nutty blend that's a nearly even mix of virginias and burley. And Haunted Bookshop is a spicy and nutty mix of Burleys Virginia and some perique.
PipeTobacco,39ny2f,tennesseean_87,2,Sat Jun 13 06:09:54 2015 UTC,"From the few bowls of Three Friars I've had, it's way more VA-dominant with a little help from the Burley. Pegasus is more of a Burley blend with a little VA and a pinch of Black Cavendish."
PipeTobacco,39ny2f,Comintern,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:18:37 2015 UTC,Yeah I've heard it's nearly a 50/50 mix of the Burley's and Va's. I think that would make it an easy entry into the genre of Burley's for someone.

I know a lot folks look down on it as just another OTC blend, but it been around for ages and with good reason!  It's a simple unpretentious smoke that is mild and packs a decent nicotine punch.  Or Carter Hall for that matter, Burley and Virginia mixed. Nice mild smoke as well.   Edit: spelling, Damn you auto correct!"

PipeTobacco,39nsii,Alligator_Gar,6,Sat Jun 13 02:05:22 2015 UTC,"One of the best   trades   ever.      /u/SmokinLogan and I undertook a modest five stick trade with an Esoterica swap and a little of this and a little of that.  He expressed concern that he was kind of boning me on the trade, which couldn't have been farther from the truth.  Looking back on it, that was an early warning sign I was about to get my ass blown out of the tub.  I could list all twenty four tobaccos he sent, but I'd rather spend my time telling you how meaningful this trade was.  I could spell out the cigars but I'd rather talk about what they represent.      All the things that make up a meaningful trade were present with Logan:   Writing back and forth about ourselves and our tastes before the trade.   Prompt shipping and pinpoint communication.   Three page letter of unbiased, honest evaluation and detailed info about the contents.   Two of his personal blends for evaluation and bags of every freaking kind of base tobacco known to man so I can learn the flavors and cook up my own blends.  Amazing.   Many outstanding up-my-alley blends like Balkan Sas and Sob, Frog Morton, SG Balkan Flake, Lancer's and Fusiliers, 8 oz of Margate, etc.    Lost and Found Pepper Cream Chocolate Crush and five other hot, limited availability, unknown (to me) or personal favorite cigars.  Which pretty much describes everything in the large flat rate that came in the door today.      The time and thought Logan put into this trade is going to pay dividends for years to come.  He has given a new piper the gift of learning and defining my tastes without having to make costly, disappointing blind buys.  I have many nights of fine smoking and crazy blending to look forward to this summer because of one stellar trade.  Bravo, Logan, and thank you so much!"

My roommate and I did this a while back and we were both surprised by many of them. Vanilla custard and celtic being mutual favorites between her and I. Give em a whirl and you might be surprised.

PipeTobacco,39n5q0,BrackGin,4,Fri Jun 12 22:51:31 2015 UTC,"Regular pipe cleaners: Daily use general purpose cleaning. Use them to swab out excess moisture or dampen them with alcohol and use them to break down tar build up and sanitize the pipe.  Fluffy cleaners: Same as above, except the fluffy cleaners can swab out more moisture per cleaner or deliver more alcohol if necessary. Also, the slightly wider diameter is useful for swabbing out large bore airways.  Bristle cleaners: Used as a mild abrasive to break down solid tar deposits and scrub off bits of tobacco that may have adhered to the walls.  Tapered cleaners: Available in the varieties above, but they are slimmer on one end than a regular cleaner and about as wide on the other as a fluffy cleaner. Best used when heavy deposits, narrow slots, etc. prevent easy access with a regular cleaner. Insert the small end and scrub until the channel opens up enough to get a non-tapered cleaner in."
PipeTobacco,39n5q0,Piffyr,2,Sat Jun 13 01:39:04 2015 UTC,"This is very very helpful. It seems a regular will do most of the job if persistent on solid or tough deposits. This should be added to the wiki page IMO, if it's not already there. /u/crimsonrat"
PipeTobacco,39n5q0,Piffyr,2,Sat Jun 13 02:29:50 2015 UTC,"It seems a regular will do most of the job if persistent on solid or tough deposits.   True, but bristles are really the way to go with those type of deposits. Without the abrasive action you're going to be at it for a very long time and use up a lot of cleaners. Once the cleaner loads up, it's no good. You're just spreading the gunk around at that point. One bristle will do the work of four or five regulars in that case.  That said, I try not to use bristles inside stems unless they are acrylic, Bakelite, or something similar. Vulcanite, ABS, and other ""soft"" materials will scratch and score easier than you might think. If it's an old, well-smoked estate you might not have any other choice though."

I was hoping to get your opinion. Or maybe someone that has bought a few of these. Consider that I am still starting out and the pipes I want to work with were my grandfather's and not really 100% on whether this is for me, so I'm a bit reluctant to overspend on something that might not last."
PipeTobacco,39n5q0,Piffyr,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:07:05 2015 UTC,"The only cleaners that I've used are B.J. Longs and Brighams. I stick with the B.J. Longs now. They lose less fluff and are a little thinner than the Brighams. So, it's easier to get into tight slots and such. Regular and bristle cleaners are going to do 95% of what you need done. So, concentrate on those. They'll do the other 5% too. It just might take a little more work.  Here's a piece of advice though; don't start with your grandfather's pipes. Pick up a couple of cheap, cruddy beater pipes from eBay to practice with. The brand and shape doesn't matter. You just want some pipes that you can get a little experience with before tackling something that you have a personal connection with."

PipeTobacco,39n5q0,crimsonrat,2,Sat Jun 13 05:25:51 2015 UTC,"You're right. I guess I should clarify. If all you are planning on doing with the pipe is cleaning it out with pipe cleaners, then correct, there is very little risk. Not 0, but close. If, however, you're also planning to remove the oxidation from the stems, get the tar deposits off of the rim, etc., then the risks increase. The choice is always yours, of course."
PipeTobacco,39n5q0,crimsonrat,2,Sat Jun 13 05:38:40 2015 UTC,"I got some tar off the top by just wiping it down with water, another seems to have shed some waxing so I haven't worked it yet, but the only issue I encountered was loss of color. The plastic part of the stems have almost no oxidation, metal part are a whole different story but it should be pretty straight forward, not planning on using heavy abrasives and giving it the good ol' hand power treatment to scrape it out. They have been well cared for while they where used, so I am up to the challenge of pushing it a bit forwards."

PipeTobacco,39lpg8,talltree2011,5,Fri Jun 12 16:56:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the kind words!  Creating Ligne Bretagnes is straightforward  The shapes are already rough cut by the factory, so they're more or less pre-set, though I can and do tweak them a bit.  The bulk of my labor time with LBs goes into blasting, applying unique finishes, detailing, etc.  For Goblins, I tend to specifically pick out plateau blocks with unusual or dramatic grain patterns and surface contours, and then let the flow of the grain shape the design of the pipe.  For Talbert Briars, I do a lot of that too, but am usually more technical, working from design sketches and experimenting with different shape ideas.  Once I've got a style I think I'll like, it's all hand work from there, and often I even mix and cast my own stem materials."
PipeTobacco,39lpg8,scriptonic,4,Fri Jun 12 18:10:20 2015 UTC,What made you want to do the ligne line and how do you feel that now there are so many  pipe makers following suit and doing something similar?
PipeTobacco,39lpg8,mikeymongol,7,Fri Jun 12 17:39:06 2015 UTC,"When we bought the business in France, it came not only with an installed pipemaking workshop full of equipment but also with a stone barn filled top to bottom with old shaped factory stummels.  A number of factories in St. Claude closed down over the past several decades and the prior pipemakers in our location had bought up tons of post-war stummels in roughed form, and basically just stockpiled them.  They were part of our purchase so we essentially had to do something with them.  At the time, hardly anyone was catering to the pipe folks just entering the hobby - Everyone wanted to be the new Bo Nordh.  Plenty of new makers all charging $500+ for their pipes but nothing down around the $100 range but factory lines, mainly.  I saw an opening for a more individualized, more unusual brand that could appeal to the guy looking for his first quality artisan pipe, yet who was in no way going to be shopping for something that was $400+.    Regarding all the pipemakers that are now diving into the entry level market, I have a few observations.  Most of the ones I've looked at are priced too low to survive, for one.  Those kinds of sales rely on bulk product movement to make money.  It took us around 4-5 years before Ligne Bretagne really started to make profit, and it took a lot of work to establish the brand via word of mouth and lots of good reviews.  My guess is that two years from now, 80% of the entry level brands that are appearing today will be gone - The makers will discover it's a lot of work, it has a lot of extra side costs, and they're competing with too many other guys for the minimal profits.  Basically, it's only worthwhile as a business if you can sell a lot of lower cost pipes because it takes a lot of sales to make up for the extra costs.  With so many makers all competing now, the sales slices for each are going to be too small for most to want to continue bothering with it long term.  That's my prediction, anyway.  For my own part, I'll probably scale back Ligne Bretagne sales for a while, and ride it out.  Ligne Bretagne already has a great history and a well established name, and it won't be going away but I most likely won't be producing as many of them until the current market glut has thinned out some."

I wish Heaven Forbid had been a bigger hit for them.  Hell, I even love Imaginos, even though it's not a ""real"" BOC album.  Trivia - I met lead singer Eric Bloom at the 1990 DragonCon in Atlanta, where I won the ""Best Amateur Artist"" in the art show.  Eric did a concert with the house band, with Michael Moorcock singing backup on ""Black Blade"", which was an experience to see."

From your other comment I see that you are planning on scaling back the Ligne Bretagne for a bit, but I am looking forward to having something from that line eventually, especially if you do more horn stems in the future. Anyway, could you tell us about the different moves and the challenges involved? What was the reason for the move back to the US and were you able to move any of your equipment with you? What was the procedure to bring back all the stummels with you?"
PipeTobacco,39lpg8,LegesAequitas,6,Fri Jun 12 18:27:51 2015 UTC,"Moving from country to country could be the subject of an entire book (I'm writing it now!) so this is going to be a very abbreviated reply.  Moving from the US to France was a nightmare of technicalities.  We had to sell off most of what we owned and wrangle the crazy French visa system, which essentially believed that we could not buy property unless we had a working visa, but we could not get a working visa unless we had a salaried job, never mind that the property purchase WAS the job.  Challenges included international shipping, dealing with the French and US consulates, doing everything in two languages, filling out a million forms, making up many things out of whole cloth (What exactly does the French consulate think it wants when it asks for a ""non-arrest record""?), and coping with horrific culture clash.  We were essentially forced to move back to the US because it became impossible to make a living in France.  The taxes were egregious, getting anything done took forever, and in general it was a terrible place to try and be self-employed.  Fortunately, I was able to bring a lot of our tooling and equipment back with us, as well as our stock.  I cherry-picked about 20,000 of the Ligne Bretagne stummels from our inventory over there.  US customs was typically bizarre - They handwaved through a couple of crates packed with exotic pipe drilling machinery, but insisted on opening and examining a box containing our underwear.  Then again, I have deadly shorts.  Here is an excerpt from my book, about the exact moment of getting on the plane to fly to, and move to, a foreign country -     “Houston, standing by.  I need a Go, No Go, for launch.  Packing?”  “Movers have everything in a shipping container; it’s crossing the ocean now.  Go, Houston.”  “Visas?”  “In hand, we have the right to work.  Go, flight.”  “Plane tickets?”  “Packed in our travel clothes. With our visas, but not in the same pockets.  Got travel money, a wad of euros, suitcases loaded and buckled.  Go, Houston.”  “US property?”  “Cars sold, possessions liquidated, house with realtor.  Go.”  “Arrival schedule?”  “Planned for the first three months, including house and workshop renovations needed for our sandblasting equipment, electrical upgrades, language lessons, and business license on that side.  Go, Houston.”  “What about the cats?”  “They’re staying behind for the time being with parents.  We’ll fly them over in a month or two once things settle down.  Go, flight.”  “Contacts?”  “The notaire, the seller, English and French translators on both sides of the ocean.  Go for launch!”  Under me, the plane rumbles as the giant wheels lift off the tarmac.  We’re hurtling up into the air at speeds our ancestors could never have imagined.  I look out the tiny plane window at the US dropping away below me.  Ahead of us is an overnight flight and a morning arrival in Paris.  Behind us is… Everything we’ve ever known.  We have no idea when we’ll return, or even if we will.  I realize I’m experiencing something not many people do - Stepping cleanly out of one life and into midair, suspended on hope and faith.    Far below me, the ground is already out of sight."
PipeTobacco,39lpg8,LegesAequitas,2,Fri Jun 12 18:45:06 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot of sense. I'm currently a US citizen living for an extended period of time in Europe and the visas, paperwork, bureaucracy, move, etc. can be a massive hassle. I'm really liking the style of the book as far as I can tell from the excerpt. I'm a big fan of Anthony Bourdain's writing and the little piece you shared sounds a little like his style so I'm sure it'll be an interesting read. I have another question. If you chose only 20,000 stummels, about how many do you estimate were left behind? What happened to those that remained in France?"
PipeTobacco,39lpg8,e_allen_talbert,5,Fri Jun 12 18:54:30 2015 UTC,"We found out very quickly when we began to sort out the contents of that garage that we had seriously underestimated the amount of supplies in there!

PipeTobacco,39lpg8,LegesAequitas,2,Fri Jun 12 19:12:55 2015 UTC,That's really fortuitous! You must have had a massive storage space in France then if only a tiny portion of the stems fills up your current space.
PipeTobacco,39lpg8,hedonaut,3,Fri Jun 12 19:14:24 2015 UTC,"The space in France was a cavernous outbuilding attached to a house across the parking lot from where we lived and worked. The owner had rented the space to our predecessor and was happy to continue the arrangement with us, which was a good thing because I have no idea where we would have put all of it if we had been forced to move it out. If the space had been empty, it would have easily held three of our little Renault Clios, which may help give some idea of how large it was. It also was home to the greatest collection of spider webs I've ever seen!"

When I took 20,000 stummels out of that stone barn, you could not tell that ANY had been taken out, there were that many.  A lot of them were largely unmarketable - Too small, mainly.

PipeTobacco,39lpg8,IUseExtraCommas,2,Fri Jun 12 19:22:58 2015 UTC,"Most of the Ligne Bretagne stummel shapes tend towards small.  There's one on the site right now that's pretty typical of bowl size of about 65% of our shape range.  If anything, folks tend to complain that Ligne Bretagnes don't have enough large bowl shapes, but I've managed to cultivate the smaller bowl aesthetic into part of the brand's image.  The smaller bowls we left behind were WAY small, like thimble sized.  Lots of pipes that I looked at and knew, no one's going to pay $140+ for a pipe of this size, even though they'd be as labor-intensive (and sometimes more so) to finish as larger bowls.  And I can't reveal the buyer, sorry."

PipeTobacco,39lpg8,Baragonfan25,5,Fri Jun 12 18:36:26 2015 UTC,"Nah, not really.  It's basic economics - Right now a lot of guys see pipemaking as easy money and they're jumping on the bandwagon.  When they inevitably find out it's not easy money, they'll go do something else.  In the 18 years I've been in the biz, I've already seen many come and go.  I do think it will make it harder for the established brands in the short term, but that's just the nature of competitive business."
PipeTobacco,39lpg8,IUseExtraCommas,3,Fri Jun 12 18:48:51 2015 UTC,What was the market when you started 18 years ago?  Same basic demand for pipes and less small shops marketing?
PipeTobacco,39lpg8,IUseExtraCommas,5,Fri Jun 12 19:16:33 2015 UTC,"Actually there were way more small shops, B&Ms at least.  In the 90's, most towns had at least one tobacconist of some sort.  Back then, if you wanted to sell pipes, you sold them through a B&M.  If you wanted to sell a lot of pipes, you got with a distributor who carried your work around and put it in lots of B&M shops.    I wasn't really interested in that because it seemed like giving up a lot of control to me, and I am a control freak (I wrote my own website, did all my own graphics, do all my own marketing, etc).  At the time, the idea of selling anything via the internet was unheard of, and numerous guys were always saying on alt.smokers.pipes that they would never buy a pipe from the internet, that they couldn't examine in hand in a shop.    I tried selling in a local shop at first - I put three pipes in their display case where they sat for a week until the owner called me and said come get them, no one wants them.  So, I brought them home that day and wrote my very first website, photographed them in detail, posted them, and sold them direct for twice the pocketed profit on the same day I posted them.  That was how I got started."
PipeTobacco,39lpg8,IUseExtraCommas,2,Fri Jun 12 19:22:39 2015 UTC,"wow.  1 week and he gave up.  :)  That seems like pretty high expectations, unless pipes were really selling fast back then.  But it sounds like it worked out better for you in the long run."
PipeTobacco,39lpg8,bonehed,3,Fri Jun 12 19:27:55 2015 UTC,"It did indeed.  There are some really damned good B&M shops out there, who do a great job of promoting their pipes.

My honest-but-harsh opinion is that the only way right now to secure a longterm future for yourself is to REALLY stand out from the crowd - Nate King's steampunk pipes are a great example of this.  At the moment, ""decent but not masterful"" pipes are a dime a dozen.  The only other thing I can stress is just to dig in and stay - Keep going to shows, keep working, keep posting stuff, and over time, you will build a buying audience by word of mouth if you do good work.  That's the best way to make a lasting business, but it's also the slowest way going in."

PipeTobacco,39lpg8,Baragonfan25,5,Fri Jun 12 21:13:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks Trever (and Emily) for taking time to do this!  I've been waiting for it since you first brought up the idea earlier this week.  What makes a pipe a good smoker?  If you have a clear draft hole that starts at the bottom of the bowl, and runs straight through the stem it should be sound.  But what other factors in the mechanics make one pipe superior to another?"
PipeTobacco,39lpg8,Baragonfan25,4,Fri Jun 12 18:54:39 2015 UTC,"Some is controllable, some is luck.  Quality briar is a big factor.  Often I can actually smell the different when shaping a block, whether it's going to be an exceptional smoker or not (I think really excellent briar gives off a scent like warm bread, FWIW...).  For Talbert Briars, I'll sometimes boil the stummels after they're shaped, repeatedly, to extract any final tannin from the wood.  But the hard truth is, a big chunk of smoking quality is a roll of the dice and it's down to the specific block - Some will be great, and some won't.  I can control about 70% of the final result by making good airhole internals and especially stem internals, but the rest is down to nature.    Also, it's worth mentioning that ""good"" is a pretty subjective term, because a pipe that might be good for one tobacco might not like another, and the opposite could be true of another pipe.  Flavor differential between briar sources and individual blocks doesn't really make one pipe ""better"" than another in many cases, it simply means it requires a different sort of tobacco to shine."

I have a Brigham that makes Latakia Blends taste fantastic, where I hadn't cared as much for them in my other pipes.  But I had been attributing that 100% to the mechanics, and hadn't considered the briar itself.  That's an interesting factor that I hadn't thought about.  Do you boil the stummels in water to remove the tannins, or some other brew?"
PipeTobacco,39lpg8,IUseExtraCommas,2,Fri Jun 12 19:45:50 2015 UTC,"No, a lot of it is the bowl material.  Briar does vary, sometimes a lot.  I had a box of old Algerian blocks a while back that would produce the richest, deepest flavors - They were the polar opposite of the ""bright"" flavor characteristics of some Italian briar, for instance.    Stummels are boiled in distilled water with a few natural acid additives.  It can be a handy way to test briar sometimes - A good block goes into boiling and produces a clean bin of water.  Briar that needs more work can turn the water as dark as wine, almost."

On the one hand, the dude is one of my idols from childhood and now that he and Peter Cushing and Vincent Price are all gone, the world is a poorer place.  OTOH, his work pretty much commemorates itself, and I don't know that any sort of pipe wouldn't just come off as a cash-in.  I hate stuff like that, cheap ""commemorative"" money grabs that attach themselves to popular trends like lampreys.  I made a lot of LOTR pipes in the late 90's out of love for the books, but stopped doing them when the movies came out, right before everyone and their cat all started selling ""wizard"" pipes and LOTR rip-off tie-ins."

PipeTobacco,39lpg8,xDemagog,3,Fri Jun 12 19:32:42 2015 UTC,"We also don't want to get crossways with anyone over copyright - it's one thing if we, as a low-volume producer, create a few pipes that are inspired by a book or movie. It's another entirely to start making an entire line of knock-offs that mimic the pipes from the LOTR movies and derive their value from that similarity. It's ultimately not very satisfying to us, either. Personally, I'm a bit daunted by the idea of trying to come up with a pipe that would commemorate Christopher Lee's career - but there's certainly plenty to be inspired by!"
PipeTobacco,39lpg8,xDemagog,4,Fri Jun 12 19:38:32 2015 UTC,"I bought a Goblin from you a while back - this one. (Forgive the awful pic.)  It was a glorious bright green. But now that I have been smoking it semi-frequently, I have noticed that the outside and the top of the bowl is turning brown. Is that normal, or am I smoking it too hot/frequently?  Also, can you explain the green coloring? I don't see that often in pipes, so I'm guessing that it's not a naturally occurring hue. Is it dyed?"
PipeTobacco,39lpg8,xDemagog,3,Fri Jun 12 19:31:50 2015 UTC,"Smooth pipes and green stains have been an ongoing point of contention and challenge for me.  Basically, to answer your question, yes, browning is normal.  The briar of a pipe darkens over time with use, and what happens is that the darker brown wood color tends to show through the transparent green stain tints more.  So, the short reply is that yes, it's a natural process and you're not doing anything wrong.  The longer answer is that this is something I've been steadily improving over the years, in the eternal search for ""greens that won't fade"".  The only real ultimate solution is the unpopular one - To stain the pipe green and then apply a thick coating of lacquer all over it to keep it from rubbing off.  I don't like that solution so I've gradually refined the process in recent years and am still tweaking it today.  These days I usually bleach the exterior as close to white as I can, to start with, because pale grey/white makes a better base for green stain than tan.  I also work with stains that have their own setting agents to lock them in place better, since aniline dye (what's normally used in pipe stains) has no binding agent of its own.    The overall answer is that green-to-brown transition is ultimately unavoidable, but I've learned a lot more ways now to delay it and minimize its effect."

Was it the availability of a pipe workshop in Bretagne that made you move?  Or was that a coincidence?  How much of the work does Emily, a.k.a. Igor do?  When does the Igor line of pipes launch?  How much of a difference does the need to streamline the Ligne Bretagne process make over a higher grade Talbert?  What's your take on the smoking qualities of morta?  Is it just pretty?  Or does the higher mineral content have a real effect?  What would Baragon and the codger kaiju say about the recent pricing disputes, a.k.a. the ""turd pipe debate""?  How can I get a Prugnaud without paying more than the pipe costs for shipping?  Do you ever do a commission?  Or maybe a waiting list with a reasonable pre-payment and layaway plan ending say Octoberish?  Just asking, sheesh.  What happens when all the stummels run out?   I have more.

PipeTobacco,39lpg8,dnemets,3,Fri Jun 12 19:40:25 2015 UTC,"The LB stummels vary wildly. Although some are almost ready to be stained or finished once they have a stem, most require a fair bit of sanding to remove roughness left by the machine-turning process. And some are so chewed that we can only use them for sandblasts - there would be no way to make them smooth without changing the shape. The pipe workshop was the reason for the move. It was a chance to work with a material we'd never have had access to (although the increased availability of morta/bog oak has pretty well knocked that on the head now) and also to use tools that were twice our age and made for the pipe fabrication industry. I make pipes, box and ship them, do the bookkeeping and taxes, try to keep tabs on the inventory, pitch in where needed and offer opinions whether desired or not.  One difference is that an unexpected flaw in a handmade pipe (or a partially handmade LB Collector or Goblin) may lead to an inventive solution and a more dramatic shape than originally planned. Or the whole thing may have to be trashed. With the Ligne Bretagne stummels, there's not much room for working around a problem; we can shorten a shank or cut a bowl down, but if the solution is much more involved than that it's not worth the time. We are fairly ruthless with LB stummels. Convince Gerard Prugnaud to move to the US? :D When the what? At our current rate we have enough stummels to last until we're both about 150, so unless life expectancy jumps radically in the next few years, we'll be bequeathing them to some lucky person at some point.

It's silly to try, because ultimately, what we get known for is not the work that we try to force getting known for, but rather what rings the loudest bell for the buying and collecting audience.  Strictly IMO, going at the work trying to develop a signature shape is way too ""Try-Hard"" - It's putting the focus on the wrong thing, when it ought to be on making a good pipe that's going to be cool looking and a good smoke.  What gets associated with you is what happens along the way.  I started with pipes in 1990.  In the mid 90's, I bought my first kit and carved a pipe.  Via AOL, I connected with master US carver Paul Perri, who taught me how to make pipes via lots of copious instructions and drawings in longhand on yellow office papers he would mail to me in reply to my questions.  I prefer 1792 and Black XX Rope.  I generally prefer Gawith blends.  Em smokes on occasion, though not regularly.  She's too cute.  Some pipe shapes, or more specifically bowl interior shapes, definitely lend themselves more to some tobaccos than others.  Baragon  I just work till the bills are paid, then I put on loud Manowar and jump up and down in the shop until new bills arrive.  I've done plenty of classical Talbert Briars.  You can see a couple of Talbert billiards on this page - http://www.talbertpipes.pair.com/gallery/2000.shtml  If I had to start churning out pipes as quickly as possible, I'd get a job at Home Depot.  Seriously.  FWIW, though, my first several years of pipemaking were entirely done using a bench grinder motor mounted on a 2x4 ""bench"", with a power drill for buffing and a Dremel for all shaping, fer realz.  I don't keep up with the international scene that much.  I have a feeling Marinne Le Pen will be the first female president of France.  I find their political situation fascinating, especially from the other side of the ocean."

On the subject of bowl interior shapes.  Do you grind your own bits to affect different shapes?  What blends would you reach for a tapered bowl on? On the subject of Manowar, is it always metal?  Is there a specific genre or album you prefer in the shop? If you were going to collaborate with another pipemaker and you had open choice, who would it be? If you were going to mentor a younger pipemaker and had open choice, who would it be? What makes a pipemaker change style over time?  Is there a noticeable change day to day?  Or is it just a progression? Do you check eBay for your own pipes?  When you see older pipes you've made what's your reaction?   Are you a former cigarette smoker?  Did the pipe help you quit if so?  I ask given your predilection for high nicotine blends. Kaywoodie?  Grabow?  Medico?  Mastercraft?  Or no, they were all crap.

Goblins are all about nature and letting capturing the feel of wild thickets, and what's at the bottom of the garden.  Halloween pipes are my attempt to inject a surrealist psychological element into a piece of wood that we smoke out of. We moved for several reason.  The workshop was full of custom machinery we couldn't get in the states.  We had the chance to be the first popular makers of morta pipes.  I'd always wanted to live near the ocean. Emily does a lot of work.  We trade pipes back and forth and complete each other's processes and steps all the time.  The Igor line is up to Igor. All the difference.  I can make $600 of Ligne Bretagnes in the time it takes to make one $600 Talbert.   It varies with the morta.  I've had some that were as neutral as meerschaum.  The stuff I use from the Briere has a very distinctive flavor of its own, with a totally different smoking personality from briar.   Baragon says his corncobs are just as good as all those overpriced artisan pipes, and anyone who thinks differently is a snob.  The codger kaiju (Love this term) don't grok pipe flamewars, they're too busy talking about which pipe is best to smoke while watching ""Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"". You can buy one of mine and pay three times what I paid for it, except that I won't sell mine anyway :D  I've considered putting together a group buy of some sort for these, but I'm too damned busy. I usually hate commissions.  I do them, but tend to be very picky about who I do them for, and prefer to stick with established buyers that I've got good rapport with.  A whole lot of pipe commissions go exactly like this - http://lizardsandpipes.thecomicseries.com/comics/2/ Yet to be determined.  Given that I've got 20,000 and I make around 120-150 a year and I'm nearly 50 now, the math says I have a lifetime supply.  I may supplement them if I find other sources that I believe are of equal quality, but that's a problem for years to come.

You talk on your website about injecting humor into a pipe, how do you manage that with somewhat mostly sometimes preformed stummels?  Are you having to redrill airways in each stummel?  Or were they not drilled initially?  Any issues with off drilling from the original makers if so?  Any guesses where the briar is from?  Does it seem softer or more resistance than other briar under blasting?  Didn't you miss the food?  At least sometimes?  What's the difference to the smoker resulting from the time change between a Talbert and an L.B.?  Are those thingies on the goblins sometimes fragile?  The floating plateau wing thingys?  I'm afraid I'd break one if I had one.  If you made a line of clays, how would it be different from the usual ones you see?  If they would be.   I have more.  I will go away as needed."

""Beast"" requires something like a Kirsten for proper 50's ambiance.  http://www.talbertpipes.pair.com/bretagne-catalog/1559lb.shtml  Sometimes.  Many are already drilled.  Occasionally there will be one that's way off, but they're rare, and those just go in the bin.  Probably Algeria and North Africa, French colonial territories in general.  It's much harder under blasting, but that's a factor of age.  Older briar hardens like a mofo.  I miss crepes and gallettes.  A TB is 100% handmade, better looking, better detailed, more creative, and more personal.  It will also often have a bit fuller flavor due to extra work in the airway internals, especially at the bit.  I try to avoid making anything fragile.  I usually test by seeing if I can break bits off with my fingers - If so, I redesign.  If someone drops it on a concrete floor, that's not something I can help.  They would be a cross between Heather Coleman's handmade clays and Gerard's traditional stem pipes.  Ideally, I'd make handmade clays with handcut stems and put as much work into them as I would for a Talbert Briar, but the market would probably never buy a clay pipe with $400 of labor in it, so I'd have to make changes somewhere."

I've never  understood it, and figure I can ask a stupid question more easily with 30 around it.  Is there a bubble?  Was there a bubble?  Why?  Is it over?  It is still happening?  Which pipes will be immune to it if so?  Do you ever feel stifled by the ""hand finishing"" process?  What trend are current pipe buyers going to regret in a few years?  Is the online pipe community ever going to come close to the pre-ASP community?  Are pipe shows dead because of it?  Where did all the drama come from, and is it going away?

Right now there's a bubble in $100-ish pipes from artisan workshops.  6 years ago there was a bubble in $1200 pipes from artisan workshops.  Nope.  Audiobooks are the thing.  Interesting question!  I know there are some guys who regret buying $1500 pipes a few years ago from guys who have since folded up shop.  There's less of that with a $100 pipe, though - Even though I doubt most of the current glut of $100-ish pipe brands will survive, when it's all over, the buyers still didn't lose a lot of money.  Probably the guy with the biggest regrets will be the guy who fixates onto one new artisan shop brand and buys 25 of their $100 pipes, and then has to explain to everyone what the brand was 6 years from now when the brand is gone and he's trying to trade or sell them as estates.  The drama has always been there.  I have yet to meet a drama-free pipe forum, except for the private one that I mod, which is Super Extra Secret.  No, I do not miss those days!  If I start to, pour some wolverines over my head and set me on fire.  I collect unusual pipes.  I don't fixate on makers or eras or any of that.  I'm more likely to go for one of every style of Kirsten, calabashes, weird expansion chamber designs, unusual clays, and other oddities.  I've got enough good briar pipes that I'm content, but I'm always ready to grab up a handmade clay calabash with a morta bowl and a resin stem.  Sometimes, yes.

If you're not wild about keeping that stuff, maybe don't bite. The Trevi is less than $80 new, for instance. I guess if you're nervous you could always wait to see if he drops the price or offer something lower. It's not something that I'd bite on personally."
PipeTobacco,39nllm,tennesseean_87,2,Sat Jun 13 02:12:12 2015 UTC,80 a pipe is below their retail so its not that bad of deal I guess.  If you search ebay for some of those pipes you can get a good idea - most run around 90-120 new.
PipeTobacco,39nllm,pylorns,2,Sat Jun 13 01:37:28 2015 UTC,"I am not overwhelmed with the deal.  Figure to sell the pipes, even if unused you are going to discount them at least 1/3rd or even 1/2th to sell them.  The lower the original price, the higher the discount.  So the Trevi  would probably fetch $40.  Almost anything you do is likely to end up with only a partial sale on the tobaccos... or it will have to really be cheap.  YMMV  Naw... I would not pull the trigger with the thought of re-selling them in mind.  Not unless something in the accessories has more value than I see off hand.  If  you liked that style of tobacco it might make a difference... I certainly don't."

I'm not a huge arro smoker but there are a few there I like and if you look at the tobacco as a value added instead of part of the package then your still getting those pipes for about 20 bucks a pop.  Not a bad deal from that perspective. However if your looking at reselling most of it it's probably not worth it.  By the time you list everything and pay for shipping you might break even if your lucky. I'd say unless you really want the pipes for yourself to pass.
PipeTobacco,39nllm,BrackGin,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:58:02 2015 UTC,I'd be down for a honey and chocolate and CAO black if you're not up to keeping them. $2 per oz + shipping sound good? I don't mind if you keep some of it since I just started pipe smoking. Let me know if you end up acquiring the lot.  In regards towards the deal try getting a lower price. The only one that seems worth the $80 is the Dracula uness you are certain they are going to arrive in good or even ready to use condition.
PipeTobacco,39nllm,BrackGin,2,Sat Jun 13 02:41:39 2015 UTC,They are all in new/next to new condition. I have seen pictures. I'd be picking them up in person so I would be able to double check before I pulled the trigger.

Semois, to my taste buds, is like a crass between white and dark burley with some stoving going on. If I had to put it on a map, I'd place it the burley family easily. I think the toasting process is the main thing that makes it so different."
PipeTobacco,39l73r,hedonaut,2,Fri Jun 12 14:56:51 2015 UTC,"It's more than the toasting, but the relation to burley could well be that the initial crop planted in the Semois area was burley.

PipeTobacco,39l73r,hedonaut,2,Fri Jun 12 15:43:41 2015 UTC,Oh indeed. It's very special stuff. It just seems to me to have the flavor profile of burley. It also handles like a straight dry burley in the pipe. Those floral notes are something unqiue though.

And this is why it's producing a proper flame when coming out the side but not the top."
PipeTobacco,39kydk,naughty_corner,2,Fri Jun 12 14:15:50 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking this is the case, too.  The chimney is sucking in air from the side holes and causing the flame to shoot up.  Similarly when held sideways, the open top is allowing too much air in and forcing the flame higher.    I don't think this would have much impact while lighting a bowl, but makes for a weird effect otherwise."
PipeTobacco,39kydk,BriarBoy,3,Fri Jun 12 15:01:42 2015 UTC,"It is a liquid fuel lighter not butane isn't it?, looks like the wick is too long, shortening it to ¼"" to 5/16"" should eliminate the flame problem."

You can easily and cheaply obtain isopropyl alcohol (99% isopropyl ideally--can be found at drug stores, department stores, on Amazon...) It's not meant for consumption but is safe to use on pipes.  A pretty sizable and pretty vocal group will swear you should never use this and are only safe with potable booze, and while I do get where they're coming from (I myself prefer Bacardi 151), it just doesn't line up with the facts. I've used isopropyl with no ill effect on countless pipes. Also, Google rebornpipes--the guy who runs that blog knows his business and uses isopropyl almost exclusively."
PipeTobacco,39kphc,Ciceronian,4,Fri Jun 12 12:45:31 2015 UTC,My only worry is what do i do after cleaning it out with the isopropyl alcohol? would there still be residue of alcohol in there?

OP just seemed like he may actually want to use drinking alcohol, but ran into barriers at his house. But yes, isopropyl works just fine. You just don't want to be using the 91% stuff because that WILL dry out the wood too much. I personally keep the 91% around my house, so when it comes pipe cleaning time I dilute it 50/50, maybe a little less, putting it somewhere around 50-60%, same strength as the liquors you'd be wanting to use if you went the more traditional route."

PipeTobacco,39kphc,raizel_234,2,Fri Jun 12 19:57:36 2015 UTC,"You can use the ultimate compromise. Denatured alcohol. It is grain (ethyl) alcohol denatured (rendered undrinkable) by the addition of a small amount of wood (methyl) alcohol. You can get denatured in hardware stores, Home Depot, etc. for dirt cheap and works better than isopropyl for dissolving goop and gunk. It evaporates quickly and leaves no harmful residue. Party on."
PipeTobacco,39kphc,Kofcandre,3,Fri Jun 12 14:10:18 2015 UTC,"You need to bend the rule and get a small bottle of 100 proof vodka. You don't have to consume it, just look at it like a bottle of cleaner. You wouldn't drink Pinesol, why would you drink pipe cleaning fluid? Put it that way when talking to other people in the house about it. If you have kids you're worried about you can always keep it locked away. If you ARE the kid and your parents won't allow it ask if they would hold onto it for you and only pull it out when you need to clean the pipe, under their supervision, or whatever. If it's for religious or moral reasons, like I said discuss it with the house, and help them understand it's not for consumption, but for cleaning."
PipeTobacco,39kphc,Kofcandre,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:15:52 2015 UTC,Isopropyl alcohol like you can get OTC at a pharmacy should he just fine for cleaning an pipe. Don't get it on the outside of your pipe or bad things will happen.  You definitely want the 91% or stronger stuff tho. I've used whiskey a few times when I had it on hand and to be honest I didn't see what the big fuss was. It did impart a little flavor to the next couple of bowls but that was it.  Functionally speaking the ethyl alcohol in booze and the Isopropyl alcohol will work about the same way as far as a solvent. Yes the are different chemicals (two carbon atoms vs. Three per molecule) but they will both break down the deposits that build up in the stem of a pipe just fine.  I do suppose if you used enough of the Isopropyl stuff you could dry out the Pipe to much. But you shouldn't be using more than a couple of milliliters per cleaning anyway.

PipeTobacco,39kphc,Kodomachine,-3,Sun Jun 14 17:04:40 2015 UTC,You need (consumption grade) alcohol to break down the tars and residue from the tobacco. I don't know how you'd be able to do it otherwise. Do NOT use rubbing alcohol on your pipe. That stuff is not meant for consumption and will be terrible for your pipe.
PipeTobacco,39kphc,soymilkisgood,5,Fri Jun 12 12:10:09 2015 UTC,"I've often wondered why this is true. 100% isopropyl evaporates completely, leaving no residue. Less than 100% alcohol is usually diluted with distilled water, so you'd still get no residue, not even water spots. There's nothing else in it but those two ingredients, so what would be left behind? Big caveat: provided you let it completely evaporate before using it.  I'm not discounting your knowledge though, just interested in an explanation beyond what I can reason with my stone of a brain."
PipeTobacco,39kphc,Kodomachine,-2,Fri Jun 12 13:46:41 2015 UTC,It's more about the process of using it - spilling some on the outside of the pipe (it's very caustic for the pipe finish) and if you don't let it dry enough it can ruin the bowl. Much safer especially for beginners to use drinking alcohol. But honestly if someone wants to use isopropyl that's fine with me - they can do whatever they want with their pipes. I just would never do it to mine.
PipeTobacco,39kphc,Pwag,3,Fri Jun 12 14:04:58 2015 UTC,"I have used rubbing alcohol for years. I have not yet died. Remember a few things: A. We are using an exceedingly small amount of the stuff. B. Consuming a small amount of denatured alcohol (but significantly more than you would use to clean a pipe) will not have a noticeable effect one ones health - mouthwash is denatured alcohol and who hasn't accidentally swallowed mouthwash. C. Once the alcohol has evaporated it is gone and poses no threat to ones health.   And lets be honest here - the whole point is to smoke one of the worlds worst known carcinogens so worrying about a little denatured alcohol is a bit silly, in the grand scheme of things."

It's a great flavor, but once you smoke it in a pipe, it's almost impossible to get that flavor back out again. I recommend cobs for these to guys over here when they start out simply because they can be had for less than $10 so it's no big loss if you hate them."

That tree is native to Central America and northern South America.  Its seeds are known as tonka beans (sometimes tonkin beans or tonquin beans). They are black and wrinkled and have a smooth, brown interior. They have a strong fragrance similar to sweet woodruff (Galium odoratum) due to their high content of coumarin.  The word ""tonka"" is taken from the Galibi (Carib) tongue spoken by natives of French Guiana; it also appears in Tupi, another language of the same region, as the name of the tree.

PipeTobacco,39g7is,arterianSanor,9,Thu Jun 11 14:43:56 2015 UTC,"I will start from the beginning. I've joined this subreddit not long ago and then decided to start this hobby. At first I was lost, but finally got my way around the basics of pipe smoking, including the different type of tobaccos. Being a newbie I wanted to try every single kind of tobacco, but I don't have a lot of money because I'm still studying. The only way I could buy tobacco was waiting until the end of the month to receive my allowance from my parents. While browsing through this subreddit I've found a lot of posts about people receiving samples from other users. How cool is that? I thought that in my case it would be impossible to receive tobacco from across the pond (I live in Spain) so the idea of receiving tobacco is almost impossible. ""No samples for me"" I said to myself. I will fast forward. So... Two or three weeks ago, by some awesome coincidence, I've met another redditor pipe smoker who lives in Spain. His name is /u/Currucho We started talking about our pipe smoking adventures. (When we started pipe smoking and all that stuff) So... He suddenly asked me if I wanted some samples, but at first I was a little bit skeptical because I did not know if we were going to be able to send tobacco through the National Post (Called: Correos) and I did not have anything to send him back. But he kindly insisted and I finally said yes. I was a little bit afraid about Correos discovering that he was sending some tobacco. (You can't buy tobacco online here) But today the samples arrived and I was a little bit happy. I've just wanted to share this little story... Because at the time I've met him, I was about to give up this hobby. But he showed me how awesome this community is, and how wonderful thos hobby is. Because sometimes, it's not about the tobacco or the pipe, but about the people who you share this hobby with. Muchas Gracias amigo.  The tobacco samples are: -Mac Baren Vanilla Cream  -Mac Baren HH Vintage Syrian -Rattray Red Raparee  -G&H Bob's Chocolate  -Bulldog Ropel's Roundels -A Misterious Tobacco"

Most of us are in on both ends of that thread at one time or another, if we stick with it.  i know I have been, and it doesn't stop with age or income.  There are bad apples in every barrel, of course, but by and large I have found fewer scoundrels in the pipe community than in any other group I have been associated with.  YMMV  You might want to ask your amigo how he obtains his tobacco.  Frequently there are ways around various prohibitions, skirting the regulations, without actually violating them.  by keeping my orders from the US modest, both in value and in weight, most orders come through un-taxed, although openly declared as to contents.  Here if the amount is low enough they generally don't feel it is worth of their effort to collect a relatively small amount. [Others opt for trying to hide the contents by various dodges, but my experience is that when you do that you pay a lot more on the ones that are taxed.  Like triple the duties and taxes.]  That is a nice selection of samples he has forwarded to you, with a range of tastes, the Red Raparee and the HH Vintage Syrian are two I particularly like myself."

PipeTobacco,39hvzb,crf_meyerssa,13,Thu Jun 11 20:44:49 2015 UTC,"Woo! I can dig into this one pretty well...  The reason you don't see a lot of burley/latakia blends is, you just don't see that many burley blends. Burley is kind of the forgotten leaf. A few blenders do great work with it, but it doesn't have nearly the devotion heavy latakia blends or virginia blends do. Burley was the mainstay of all of the old over the counter tobaccos. Prince Albert, Half and Half, and Carter Hall are all burley blends, and the tobacco world doesn't always want to shake those humble associations off. The other reason is burley's a hard plant to blend. It's bitter, and the flavors don't reach out and grab you like a bright, sugary virginia does. It's really hard to mess up a Va/Per. Take 15 ounces of good, quality medium virgina and add a dose of perique and you;re guaranteed to get something smokable. Make that same mix with burley in place of virginia and few people will want to smoke it. This point leads to...  Burley without virginia is very much like steak without salt. Burley can be smoked straight, and I've smoked plenty of burleys just that way and loved them, but when you pair up a stout, bitter burley with just a little bright leaf, all sorts of unexpected things come tumbling out. That little dose of high sugar leaf wakes the complexities of the burley up, bringing out the nuttiness, hints of chocolate, leathery cigar, loamy earth, and woodiness that would have never been detectable on its own. You may find once you order some blending components that you really like burley unsweetened, and that's cool. It's just not the way most burley fanatics do. Another important note here. A lot of blenders try to use some ""subtle"" (almost never subtle enough) casing to bump some sweetness in, but that's even harder to pull off well than a pinch of VAs. VAs are important for Latakia blends for similar reasons. There are blends with Latakia devoid of VA, but it's rare and hard to pull off.   Now to answer your questions more directly:  1) Burley Flake #4 by Cornell & Diehl: The perique is much lighter than you'd expect. This blend is all about the interplay between burley and Latakia.   Bill Baily's Front Porch: This blend kicks in some black cav for a little more sweetness, and is more burley forward.  Crowley's Best: More Latakia than the others for a more English feel, with a sweeter, amped up blend fo burleys  2)You're not wrong at all, just watch out for the bitter. Unsweetened iced tea is awesome. Unsweetened lemonade isn't quite so much, and it's going to be a very delicate balance. There are a lot of burley blends that taste like pure burley despite being 3/4 VA, but even that pales next to how much you'll taste just 2oz/pound of Latakia.   3)Buy really good blending components and research your sources. Good blending stock typically comes bone dry. Mix by weight and hydrate after. This keeps things easier to keep track of as your measurements don't get thrown way off by one component being wetter than another. Take LOTS of notes and have fun with it. Share samples with us when you get there."

PipeTobacco,39hvzb,hedonaut,2,Fri Jun 12 13:17:17 2015 UTC,"I have found that I like burley-forward blends sweetened with VA better than those without, speaking mostly of C&D."
PipeTobacco,39hvzb,tennesseean_87,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:28:26 2015 UTC,Indeed. It really is like salt and pepper on a steak. Some burleys are so flavorful that a blend can be 3/4 VA and still taste like a burley forward blend.
PipeTobacco,39hvzb,hedonaut,2,Fri Jun 12 13:18:13 2015 UTC,"Any recommendations on where to get blending stock?   I have some slotted over at P&C,  however if there is a more reputable location for blenders materials for experimentation then please advise us."
PipeTobacco,39hvzb,Chuzordie,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:24:11 2015 UTC,"It's all a matter of source. I know P&C sources their own blending stock from different places, but I'm not sure where. I don't think I'm being a corporate putz by saying C&D has some of the best burley, but the other components should be experimented with. Given the avid following the Hearth and Home tobaccos have, I don't think there's any doubt they're blended with good stuff. As long as the bulk blenders are the same components, you should be on the right road.   I was mostly warning against any whole leaf sellers that you haven't properly vetted. I've seen a lot of bad bad leaf out there from small whole leaf resellers that don't store their tobacco properly and end up with dusty, super dry, bug-ridden product."
PipeTobacco,39hvzb,hedonaut,2,Fri Jun 12 14:47:53 2015 UTC,"Came here to say Burley Flake #4 - what a great tobacco. It is strong and flavorful. I also had no idea there was perique in it - haha.

PipeTobacco,39fbkt,star_boy2005,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:54:31 2015 UTC,Hi. You into RC? Just maidened my 2.5m ASW-28. Prettiest bird in my collection! Even caught some thermals and hung around for about 20 minutes.   Then I made the mistake of flying my new AXN Floater instead of going back to work like I should have. Its tree line detector works just fine.
PipeTobacco,39fbkt,mocktheweakforfun,2,Thu Jun 11 16:34:27 2015 UTC,I've been meaning to get into RC. just never found the time. I'm an airman and actually got my students glider pilots licence but never got my full

I've had the controls of a Cessna 152 for a few hours years ago and fell in love with flying. My health won't permit my getting a real license so I do the next best thing. Anytime you want to talk planes or pipes or anything else, give a holler! I could listen to people talk gliders and powered flight all day long. Cheers, friend!   p.s. my new main glider is an ASW-28 and I've got an AXN floater which is also a lot of fun."

I admit that the American made crumble cakes I've had in the past do come quite moist and so I dried them for about 30 minutes to an hour before smoking and everything was just fine. With this particular crumble cake I didn't even give it trying time and it lit just as well as a normal ribbon cut for me. I just cut it into almost a cube cut and it was perfect."

I just had my latest splurge arrive, but I promised myself I would smoke - and review - all of my samples before I get to open any new tobaccos.

PipeTobacco,39d8mm,SupraMario,2,Thu Jun 11 00:44:13 2015 UTC,"Well so far. It is now sensitive to moist tobacco though. Being small,  it will heat up and gurgle if the flake has not been properly dried. When done right though, the p lip really concentrates the sweetness of the Dunhill Flake which is amazing."

PipeTobacco,39auph,PipingaintEZ,11,Wed Jun 10 14:28:26 2015 UTC,"I love fine dining. On a recent business trip, wining and dining customers, I had the opportunity to try an Italian bone marrow dish, beef tartare, and some elegant dim sum, among other things. The food alone on that trip (NYC) was an experience unto itself. You know what I also love, though? A breakfast sandwich from a bagel place near my house. They make great bagels, cook everything fresh, and really put it together well. The service is fast, the prices great, and the staff all remembers my name and what I like. Is fine dining in the city inherently superior to my favorite bagel place? Certainly not. Does that mean breakfast sandwiches are, on average, of the same level of quality and preparation as the steakhouse I got to try on my first night in town? Certainly not. Most items found in finer restaurants take a level of skill and preparation that makes it hard to do cheaply, and therefore, it's harder to find those items prepared poorly. On the other hand, step into any grease-ball fastfood joint in these United States, and you'll have plenty of options for a colon clearing, lukewarm breakfast sandwich.   Similarly, it's a lot harder to hide cheap, low quality tobacco when you don't have heavy casings to fall back on. Just about any tobacco will do if you're going to steam all the flavor out of it and replace it with a gallon of sticky, artificial vanilla-laced humectants or the gasoline flavor of that passes as 'bourbon' to all too many companies. There are some fantastic aromatics out there. Like my beloved bagel joint, they put care and thought into their preparations. There are even aromatics that take the blending and casing process and elevate it to an art form, complimenting the flavors of their base tobaccos rather than obliterating them, and presenting unique and fascinating smokes. Blackpool, by Esoterica comes to mind. The sweetness and licorice topping melds with the stoved VAs to produce a flavor not unlike rich, strong black tea. It's a great smoke, and a smoke that wouldn't be half as good without that topping.   That having been said, I don't think I would have been able to appreciate things like Blackpool and Old Grove (for another example of a topped blend I really like) years ago when I started with the pipe. I think I had to really understand what tobacco is all about before I could appreciate the difference between a skillful alteration and a ham-fisted, low-quality offering. It takes just as much skill on the part of the blender and the folks actually working the machines and preparing the tobacco to produce a world class aromatic as it does a non-aromatic. Unfortunately, however, it much easier to pass a terrible aromatic off to the market than it is a terrible non-aromatic. The market is flooded with cheap, floor-sweeping-quality tobacco sprayed with all manner of flavors, coloring the opinion of more veteran smokers and biasing them against aromatics in general.   There's also a lot of baseless pretension. If some convenience store cherry goop makes a person happy, I'll certainly not criticize them for it. I will criticize someone who says that cherry goop represents the same level of quality as one of the boutique blenders out there crafting hand made blends with care. I'll also criticize anyone who says your insight or knowledge as a pipe smoker and the respect it deserves is determined by wherever you prefer Full Virginia Flake over Boswell's Christmas Cookie. I think people have a need to feel pretentious about things. Looking down on someone else means you must somehow be better, more, or superior. It's no doubt a symptom of bad character. Humility doesn't mean you should subject yourself to garbage you don't like, it just means you don't judge people who do. In the end, good aromatics deserve every bit the same level of respect as non-aromatics. Bad aromatics are just very, very prevalent.   Tl;Dr: People like having things to be snobby about. Smoke what you like, even if it is shit."
PipeTobacco,39auph,hedonaut,6,Wed Jun 10 15:33:57 2015 UTC,Well said!
PipeTobacco,39auph,tennesseean_87,3,Wed Jun 10 17:44:25 2015 UTC,"After reading this, it makes me want to get into some more aromatics since I have long outgrown Lane's 1Q and BCA. Could I bother you for some suggestions?"
PipeTobacco,39auph,jonmon22,5,Wed Jun 10 15:54:39 2015 UTC,"Following on what /u/hedonaut said, I've found that many aromatics are ""meh"" precisely because they ""steam all the flavor out and replace it with a gallon of...artificial flavor"".  The flavor doesn't even come through very often, and you're left with hot air.    I think that's the ""snobbish"" appearance of telling new smokers to avoid aromatics.  They are simply hard to smoke well, and by ""well"" I mean it's difficult to keep them cool, with no bite, and to smoke gently enough to get the flavor out.  I still tend to puff too hard.  But thanks to the wonderful people in this sub, I have found a number of aromatics that are better, I think simply because they use a quality tobacco base and gentle, more natural flavors.    I think something else to consider is that new pipe smokers might shy away from ""tobacco flavor"" because they equate that with cigarettes.  I know I was concerned about straight virginias because of that, but I got over it once I tasted some really great blends, and I realized how sweet and nutty good tobacco could be.  Adding a light flavor over that makes a wonderful blend.  Macbaren Vanilla Cream is my go-to vanilla now, and I haven't even tried the flake version, which is supposedly even better.  Gawith Firedance is an excellent virginia topped with tasty blackberry brandy.  Cult Blood Red Moon does cherry/chocolate very well.  It's not candy or cough medicine cherry, it's cherry liquer.  And by the way, thanks to my recent exchange with /u/TurnerJ5 at LDG, I tried some Autumn Evening, and it was very tasty as well, with nodding approval from my wife.    Also, thanks to /u/tennesseean_87, I got some lakelands.  That flavor isn't for everybody, but I enjoyed it enough to get some more, and it's a heavy floral or pleasantly soapy room note that's not too objectionable unless your grandmother happened to bathe in perfume like it.  :)  But ultimately, you'll find what you like.  Aromatics are a huge percentage of tobacco sold for a reason.  Lane 1Q is one of the most popular blends ever, again for a reason.    The great thing about having so many thousands of blends is that there's something out there for everyone, and if you don't like something you got, someone will definitely trade you for it, and that's half the fun around here."
PipeTobacco,39auph,levins0,3,Wed Jun 10 19:25:21 2015 UTC,"Sure. If you want something heavily aromatic, check out Autumn Evening by my own C&D. It's a Red Virginia Cavendish base with a very strong maple and spirit topping, very rich and creamy with some good tobacco notes poking through. If you want to try something less overtly aromatic, Old Grove is a pretty big, sweet Va/Per with a neat pomegranate topping. If you're curious about floral flavors, I can't recommend Gawith, Hoggath, and Co's Lakelands enough. Ennerdale flake is really in your face with it, and Grassmere Flake much less so. Both offer a really pleasant tobacco profile that blends well with the aromatic components. At the other end of the spectrum, Bob's Chocolate Flake, also by GH&C is also really pleasant. It's a Va/Lat blend with a touch of burley and a fantastic chocolate top note. The chocolate comes through like a spice, subtly enhancing the tobacco flavors rather than getting in the way."
PipeTobacco,39auph,hedonaut,2,Wed Jun 10 16:02:11 2015 UTC,"I don't like most Aros, but I have been loving the GH&Co. stuff. I think Brown Flake Scented has been my favorite, and the u/s version is really good, too!"

PipeTobacco,39auph,Kofcandre,5,Sun Jun 14 09:46:28 2015 UTC,"You've got some great points in your OP and there are also many great points in the various comments. A great post.   I do want to point out one thing though. You state: ""Granted, over time your pallet WILL develop a taste for English blends that at first may have seemed harsh to novice..."" (emphasis mine). Maybe this was a typo or you didn't mean it how I took it, but I think this subtly contradicts the point you made so well in the rest of your post. Not everyone WILL necessarily come to like English blends. While it's true as a generalization that many (most?) start with aromatics (perhaps because they smell so good and are widely available in most B&M store jars), not everyone leaves aros, not everyone arrives at an appreciation for English blends, etc. There may be trajectories that are generally true of many smokers, but they are not iron-clad rules, however they are very often presented that way. I don't think you or anyone else is necessarily meaning to do so (obviously the point of your post is the very opposite), but I think statements like the one I highlighted subtly perpetuate the 'aro for n00bs, English for veterans' narrative.   I probably took that way too seriously, but it is something I've seen numerous times from people who didn't even really mean it. Smoke what you like, everyone!"
PipeTobacco,39auph,tennesseean_87,4,Wed Jun 10 18:19:50 2015 UTC,I see your point and perhaps my self reflection I mentioned in the post was from a guilty conscious LOL:)
PipeTobacco,39auph,LegesAequitas,4,Wed Jun 10 18:27:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with you in saying that you should smoke what you enjoy the most. But I would still characterize aromatics as being rather lackluster for the most part. I think a great number of people here are like myself in that they started with aromatics. When I started smoking I thought they were generally okay enough to smoke them a bit, but if I'm honest, I was underwhelmed. They are normally lacking in quality flavor. When I encounter new pipe smokers I will first gauge their history with tobacco. Have they smoked cigars or cigarettes? Do they like peated whiskies or do they prefer sweeter things? If so I can feel comfortable making a recommendation for solid Virginia and English blends. If they haven't then I will steer them toward the lighter non-aromatic blends, Orlik Golden Sliced, Dunhill EMP, etc.   In the end there are a handful of aromatic tobaccos I enjoy on occasion, but that is rare. I think there is a general consensus that aromatics are generally a bit under-par for many reasons compared to non-aromatics. I think starting with aromatics has really turned a lot of beginners away from the hobby due to tongue bite, poor flavor, difficulties in lighting, etc. so I don't think it's a snobby thing to steer people away from them for the most part (Although there are definite snobs out there)."
PipeTobacco,39auph,SupraMario,3,Wed Jun 10 15:08:43 2015 UTC,"Just went out and grabbed a big tin of orlik golden sliced from your suggestion lol and I am blown away by how good it smells, its like the country lol"
PipeTobacco,39auph,LegesAequitas,2,Thu Jun 11 00:37:55 2015 UTC,That's good to hear. Like a lot of Virginia based blends it will smell a lot like hay and have a bit citrus in the mix. It's a pretty excellent tobacco and it's about the cheapest stuff you can get in a tin which makes it a rather good deal. The price and its smokability are why I so often recommend it to newer pipe smokers.
PipeTobacco,39auph,SupraMario,2,Thu Jun 11 07:52:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wanted to try it yesterday but didn't get a chance, hoping to give it a shot tonight after work, as I'm loving the smell of this stuff."
PipeTobacco,39auph,tennesseean_87,4,Thu Jun 11 13:29:00 2015 UTC,I agree with you too. I have really found my tastes to be cyclical. Over the past 5 or so years my tastes seem to change and even seem to come full circle. When all of the latika blends get lackluster and all taste the same I find myself smoking aros for a week just to change things up. Variety is the spice of life :) Although I have yet to tire of good old VA.
PipeTobacco,39auph,LegesAequitas,4,Wed Jun 10 15:43:54 2015 UTC,"I go in cycles, too. I thought I was over English blends for a while, but I loved them again. I never go for mild Aros, but the lakelands are great and even MacB Vanilla isn't too bad once in a while. I bounce around between straight Ginny-weed, VA-KY, English and orientals, a little Burley now and then, and just about anything!"

Compare that to cigars which can cost $1/stick or $30+, and wine which can cost $5/bottle or $100+. Besides going after discontinued blends or Penzance, it's pretty cheap to be a pipe tobacco snob!"

Those who smoked primarily Virginias and Va-Pers did the in through the mouth and out through the nose routinely.  The lat smokers found Virginias cigarette-like (Canadian cigarettes are primarily Virginia tobacco) and flat tasting & bland.

As to the Latakia blends I am sure you will find someone who will gladly work a trade when you figure out what you actually like, and they won't deteriorate in the tin, especially if you over seal them with an air tight plastic wrapper.  Worts that will happen is they might dry out a little."

If you want to try a high quality Virginia, I can recommend you Dan Tobacco's Roper's Roundels: round slices of tasty Virginia with a sweet Cavendish core. It is not a cheap tobacco though. If you want to try an aromatic, they released Choo Choo Train, celebrating their anniversary. I found this aromatic tastes while smoking very similarly to its tin note. It preserves its honey aroma and is really enjoyable."

PipeTobacco,399kje,PerspicaciousPiper,4,Wed Jun 10 06:11:05 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the show mate.  The general consensus for crossing over from Aro's seems to be Frog Morton blends from McClellands, in particular Frog Morton Cellar.  A nice place to start for VaPers is Escudo Navy Deluxe, which is fantastic, very easy smoking with amazing tobacco flavor.  Full Virginia Flake is a great VA, but maybe not your best friend if you arent confident with preparing and maintaining a bowl of flake, but it does taste great.  I'm actually smoking Firedance Flake right now which is an Aromatic Va flake which may be a nice departure from typical Aro's for you, I'm no Aro guy but im really enjoying it."

PipeTobacco,399kje,ijustreadidontpost,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:19:59 2015 UTC,"C&D Captain Bob's Blend is an English/aro hybrid.  Might be good if you think grape soda and tobacco should mix.  C&D Autumn Evening is just a damn good aromatic, as is MacBaren Vanilla Cream.  I like these aros because the blenders did not attempt to cover up the natural tobacco flavors.  Lane HGL is vanilla custard-y with some latakia.  Kind of interesting if you enjoy Lane and haven't tried latakia before.  Mixing natural tobaccos with aromatics is fun, too.  McClelland 5100 Red Cake and C&D Old Joe Krantz are a couple I use to mix with aros.  Due to a grievous error in judgement, I purchased a pound of McClelland Georgia Cream a few years ago (I used to go through a ""pipe phase"" every year or so for a few years until I finally picked it up full-time...and I did absolutely NO research...live and learn!).  It's sickly sweet on its own, but cut with something un-topped, it's not so bad at all.  Same goes for cutting my cheap, shitty Borkum Riff with 5100 or OJK."
PipeTobacco,399kje,blenheim45,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:25:14 2015 UTC,"IN ""Our Wiki"" there is a section of the ""Beginners"" segment on the types of tobaccos with suggestions culled from the readership here.  this is updated periodically to keep it fresh and reflective of current tastes.  when you hit on blends you like you can refer to tobaccoreviews.com and check out which reviewers agreed with your taste on a blend and then search out their reviews for similar reviews on related blends.  ""tobacco reviews"" is a great resource, as you can often get a much better idea of a blend than the write-ups that the blenders prepare, and which are pretty much pasted in to any e-tailers web page.  In the search mode you can by using ""additional search items"" look for a blend with any characteristics you might think of.  Think you might like a blend that has the taste of Kirsch?  There are two listed, only one of which has been reviewed, and it is a tobacco from Turkey. LOL"

My personal favorites there are Tashkent (balkan) and 333 (burley).  You should at least get some #8 slice, which is ""upvote"", which they blended for us. It's a VA/Bur/Per crumble cake, and it's really good.  Just an FYI, their flakes are bulk blends, in case you want to stick with something house blended.  Leavitt and Pearce is a pretty cool shop. Their pipe blends are more geared towards aromatics, but they do them well.  A lot of their blends are the old Ehrlich recipes, for instance Judge's Mixture, which is my all time favorite black cav mix.  They also make a really nice balkan."
PipeTobacco,3996j1,PipeBeard,2,Wed Jun 10 10:10:40 2015 UTC,Well the wonderful /u/bonehed just recently gifted me a sample of LJP Cuban Mixture and the stuff is pretty damn good. It's def an odd blend but the amount of different tobaccos in it make it one hell of a ride.. Get an oz or two and try it!
PipeTobacco,3996j1,Slamfrankel,2,Wed Jun 10 04:18:31 2015 UTC,If you like aromatics 432 smells really nice. I like their blend 101 it's a burley blend. They have some good flakes like Scottish flake and Boston slice. Prices will be like 4 or 5 bucks an ounce. I don't really like Leavitt and Pearce tobacco that much. To be fair I have mostly just tried their cigarette tobacco.   A place to go smoke is stanzas in the north end near Mikes pastry. I think they charge you a cutting fee but it's nice in there.
PipeTobacco,3996j1,_Madrugada_,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:28:31 2015 UTC,"Park Square from LJP (actually near the Commons and not in the North End). It was supposedly specially made for some British politician back in the day, so the recipe is a few hundreds of years old (I love historic tidbits). It happens to be really good and I think one of their most popular blends. The description from LJP:    Red Virginia, matured Virginia and stoved Virginia are delicately spiced with just the right amount of Perique to create a rich and complex blend whose character evolves and emerges through out the bowl.    Levitt and Pearce is alright, but is mostly cigars and loose cigarette tobacco. Not much in the way of pipe tobacco - most is okay aromatic blends but they do have some nice pipes there."

PipeTobacco,3982ay,Cobwarden,2,Tue Jun 9 22:50:06 2015 UTC,I saw that pipe last weekend when I was up there. Picked up 2oz of Blatter Reserve but it's much too mild for my preferences. I'm sure it's a great aro but they shouldn't label blends with such a small amount of latakia as an english

You might give a try to H&H Anniversary Kake.  It's very good, and several people on here who don't care for perique have enjoyed it.  I haven't tried Haunted Bookshop.  You might also want to look into blends that have dark fired kentucky in them.  There are a number of burley blends that include it, and it might be more to your liking.  Maybe try some Stokkebye Luxury Bullseye Flake.  It's very affordable and good quality, tasty tobacco.  Luxury Navy Flake is also good, with a bit of a perique hit, but not too heavy."

I don't know what you could do with it, but don't throw it away or anything, at the very least give it away to other smokers or something.  As for the pipes, there is a subreddit (in the sidebar) that is dedicated to selling pipes so you could try there first, see if any one wants them here then start trying other places.

Hopefully I don't ask something that might be already in the depths of your previous AMA. What's the most expensive bulk buy, pipe, or merch that you've done for a single client in one go? $100000 pipe maybe? Who knows?  I live in Puerto Rico and there are no pipe clubs and no 'real' tobacco shops that stand out to a crowd like this one. I know, it's a shame right? What would it take to would it take to grow a business and/or a community in such a place?  In my opinion this is a bizarre question, since traditionally people here are not commonly open to pipe smoking but tobacco cigarettes are consumed massively. I believe it is mostly marketing and the convenience of cigarettes i general.  What is the weirdest thing you've found in a batch of tobacco or in a pipe?  I'll stop here and go back to reading the other thread. Once again thanks for stoping by."

We've have customers that come internationally and spend thousands at a time (3-5K) on cigars and a few that will spend nearly as much on pipes and tobacco that they can't acquire in their home country. There is one fella right now who calls and will buy up a lot of our Dunhill estates and new pipes, 3 or 4 at a time. At the moment, he calls every few weeks. We haven't got any $10,000 pipes. The most expensive thing we have is probably an $1,100 Castello. We recognize the beauty in certain items but we also keep our eye out for exceptional value when we buy things for the store.   I live in Puerto Rico and there are no pipe clubs and no 'real' tobacco shops that stand out to a crowd like this one. I know, it's a shame right? What would it take to would it take to grow a business and/or a community in such a place?   That's a tough one. But, I would say It's like growing any business. You need to know your market and cater to it. I can't comment on the number of cigar and pipe smokers in Puerto Rico, but if they exist, there will certainly be a market for quality product. You can't expect to convert cigarette smokers over to a pipe, although it happens from time to time. In this day and age, it would certainly be a big challenge to start from the bottom. You're dealing with a world that is becoming increasingly unfriendly towards tobacco. The government sure doesn't make it easy to start up, either.    What is the weirdest thing you've found in a batch of tobacco or in a pipe?   The odd gigantic stem here and there. Nothing unusual!"

Repairing leaky lighters was dangerous at times. Had a Colibri (the devil's brand) lighter come in that had an internal leak that was a bitch to find. After about 30 minutes of trying to find the leak I thought I found it. What I didn't realize was that the entire time butane had been building up around my hands, and as I attempted to light it up the butane was ignited.

The deeper you want to cut, the harder it is to mitigate the burnt look. You can overcome this by making more and more passes in the same spot after letting the surrounding area cool down.  FreeCAD will get your feet wet in the CAD side and I imagine Slic3r can make gcode for a CNC, but I've only ever used it for 3D printers. Inkscape should get you SVG paths for laser cutter."

PipeTobacco,3983uj,TheWierdAsianKid,3,Tue Jun 9 22:59:16 2015 UTC,They would probably work. I don't use filters with my pipes but that's a personal choice. If it's a filtered pipe it will come with one in the pipe and I think Missouri Meerschaum uses Medico Filters like these.
PipeTobacco,3983uj,CaptainDickPuncher,3,Tue Jun 9 23:09:15 2015 UTC,"It should fit any 6mm pipe filter, Medico, Dr. Grabow or the Savinelli balsa.    I have both Medico and Grabow, they are interchangeable.   You can also choose to leave the filter out, or pick up a little adapter that replaces it with a regular draught hole.  The adapter is just because some people don't like the extra airflow from leaving the filter out.  They are less than a buck IIRC at P&C & SmokingPipes."
PipeTobacco,3983uj,IUseExtraCommas,3,Tue Jun 9 23:19:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, those will work.  As has been mentioned, Grabow or Medico 6mm paper filters are interchangeable.  I have heard people say that the Medico tend to be better quality.  I have not tried them yet -- I've been using a case of Grabows.  And yes, the Savinelli balsa filters, which are about as cheap, will also fit.  They are triangular solids of balsa wood, and rather than filtering the smoke the way the paper does, they focus more on absorbing the moisture.  The stock filters that have come with my cobs have appeared to be no-name, super cheap filters.  If those are indeed the Medicos, I'd stick with the Grabow filters, but I have a feeling they're just very basic no-name filters."
PipeTobacco,3983uj,levins0,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:55:22 2015 UTC,"The only thing missing in This picture, are the Savinelli Balsa 6mm.  I don't happen to have any right now;  The 3 paper filters are Grabow, Medico and P&C ultra cheap.  If they were a little longer, I'd probably use them, but I don't like having to dig them out when they are damp and I can't grab the end.  The little black thing is a 6mm adapter.  Looks like a plastic filter, but it just lets the air flow through.  The big ones are 9mm, Big Ben charcoal filled, and the Savinelli 9mm balsa, they are shaped different than the 6mm balsa which are triangular.  Finally, I threw in the Brigham filters."

You wont need a reamer yet as you will take a while developing a cake, if you want to ream it after a while, just use some medium grit sand paper wrapped around something cylindrical.  Plenty of packing methods, there are heaps of guides on youtube to help you out, check them out and try a few methods and see what works, I find the Frank method the best but I bastardised it a little for personal preference.   Clean the stem and shank out with a pipe cleaner dampened with alcohol, then run each end of a dry one through it until it comes out clean. Double that over into a U shape and wipe the bowl out with it after a smoke.  Pipes come up nice with a bit of wax and a buff, Carnauba or bees wax is best, I just use an additive free glossy shoe polish, a wide over with a few drops if olive oil on a paper towel works wonders too.

But I've bought some estate pipes, and I've reamed them with a combination of two reamers, both very very cheap.  You can get a buttner reamer for 99 cents on eBay frequently: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Stainless-Steel-Smoking-Tobacco-Pipe-Tools-Reamer-Cleaning-Tool-CL15-/321775123802?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item4aeb4abd5a    That one is 5 bucks, but I have two, and I've paid less than .99 for each.   I have several pipe tools with a reamer, but this one, with the wide blade is the one that is the most effective IMO:  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Tobacco-Pipe-Cleaner-Stainless-Steel-Long-Style-Cleaning-Tool-Reamer-Tamper-Pick-/171638633999?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item27f675b60f  (I'm not selling either, I just gave the links for the pictures.)  A knife also works, but if it has a sharp point on the end, be careful not to mess up the bottom of the bowl.    I really can't do better than this set of links for packing techniques:  http://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/wiki/packingtechniques    AsIfThatWouldHappen pretty much describes my pipe cleaning ritual, I happen to like Whiskey as my alcohol for pipe freshening, and currently use Maple Whiskey. :)  For keeping it shiny, I use a microfiber buffing cloth I got from 'Dollar Tree' a (local everything $1 store), and a dab from a more expensive little jar of 'Halycon II' wax occasionally.   The wax is available from most pipe stores on the web.  It will last forever.  A slightly better option for smooth pipes is 'Paragon wax' but I just bought the one so far, because I have both smooth and rusticated pipes.  http://www.4noggins.com/halcyon-wax-pipes.aspx    http://www.4noggins.com/paragon-wax-pipes.aspx  But you don't need either to start, a good buffing goes a long way."
PipeTobacco,3951qp,JCelsius,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:57:06 2015 UTC,"Once in a while I have to ream out a pipe but I'm not big on such uni-purpose tools as a reamer, so I use a pocket knife. Carefully I might add. But you shouldn't have to worry about it for a while. The only pipes I've had to ream are ones I smoke every day and I'd say I don't do it more than once or twice a year.  You may be packing it too tightly or not tightly enough. It's hard to tell. If the draw is really open and you're having this issue, maybe you should pack it down some. If the draw is sort of stifled, you might be packing it too much. Another thing to remember is to light your pipe once thoroughly and then light it again. Not everyone does this, but I believe it helps to get a solid foundation of coals. Also remember to tamp regularly.   As for cleaning, use a pipe cleaner right after you smoke and you should get any gunk before it sours your pipe. I usually push one end through the stem and into the bowl, then the other end, and then I fold the pipe cleaner in a U shape and swirl it around the bowl. If you want to clean it thoroughly once in a while, dip the pipe cleaner in whiskey first and let it sit for a while. Be careful not to get any alcohol on the finish though. It's not good for it.  I don't keep my pipes looking too nice, but I do shine them up a bit with some Burt's Bees once in a while. Good luck!"

PipeTobacco,39373o,imdakota,28,Mon Jun 8 22:47:24 2015 UTC,"Many blends on the market today are the same recipe as have been used for decades even centuries. C&D still makes a blend helped developed by Bing Crosby. Prince Albert, Capstan, these back to the first world war. People have tried many times to recreate the blend Einstein smoked, Revelation I think. Both Gawith's have been blending the same tobaccos since the Napoleonic Era. Grousemoor proudly puts on their label that they have been using the same recipe for 200 years. Fribourg and Treyer were established in 1720. Semois is basically the same rich Burley they have been growing and smoking in France since Catherine de Medici put her blessing on tobacco. Navy flakes and ropes are approximations of what sailors smoked in the heyday of the masted ship. And pure Virginia, maybe with a touch of sugar casing, is what made America sustainable back in the 1650s. Even the use of latakia and perique go back nearly two centuries.  So, almost everything you smoke is a historical blend, either from a recipe spanning generations or within the tradition passed down from blender to blender.  Oh, and nazi germany banned tobacco, so yeah, your closest option is some meth."

PipeTobacco,39373o,Terence_McKenna,16,Tue Jun 9 03:18:49 2015 UTC,"As it should (love your work btw, mr. McKenna!)  Here goes:   Many blends on the market today are the same recipe as have been used for decades even centuries.   Well the marketing departments would certainly like us to think so.  Three Nuns, for example have been sold at least four, completely different  versions even during my short pipe smoking career. The only firms that might have some  blends mostly unchanged for longer period of time are indeed the two Gawiths.   C&D still makes a blend helped developed by Bing Crosby.   Yea, kind of, sort of, but not really at all. He absolutely didn't personally  help make a blend for C&D.   About ""Crooner"" on smokingpipesdotcom:   C&D was contacted a number of years ago by a gentleman who claimed to be a friend of famed pipe smoker Bing Crosby who said he had the recipe for Bing's private blend. After hearing the recipe it was decided it would make a good blend whether the story was true or not. In 2006 or '07 (our memories aren't what they were) the IPCPR Convention was held in Las Vegas. Sure enough, every restaurant or hotel confirmed that indeed this individual and the Crooner were inseparable whenever Bing was in Vegas! This has specially cut cube Burley and Deer Tongue. An authentic copy from one of Bing's friends who blended it with him.  People have tried many times to recreate the blend Einstein smoked, Revelation I think.   Yes, Revelation. I don't know what's to recreate. I've tried two versions. It was an OTC burley topped with some kind of perfume. People like to say say that Einstein smoked Revelation, and perhaps it's true. Maybe he smoked other tobaccos as well. Every historical pipe smoking figure seem to have smoked only one blend. But then again those were the times when people only had one pipe -- because in the olden times were simpler and also awfully poor.   Both Gawith's have been blending the same tobaccos since the Napoleonic Era. Grousemoor proudly puts on their label that they have been using the same recipe for 200 years.    This could actually be true! I'm sure the there has been quite a bit of variation in the leaf source and quality along the years. Empire is no more and the ""empire tobaccos"" have changed as well. What does Napoleon has to do with the era, i do not know. I've read he liked snuff, fwiw.   Fribourg and Treyer were established in 1720   Indeed. It was  a company famous of their snuff. I'm not sure who manufactured their pipe tobaccos in the olden days, but company F&T hasn't manufactured pipe tobaccos in decades. It appears to be a well liked brand, though.   Semois is basically the same rich Burley they have been growing and smoking in France since Catherine de Medici put her blessing on tobacco.   Semois grows not in France but in Belgium. Today's Belgium.  Not a big deal from the Norteamericano perspective perhaps, but there's actually a difference. Arno's article here says the first note about tobacco grown in the area was from 1650. It is possible that it was grown there in Cate's times already. She took tobacco as curative for headaches, insufflated ze snuff.    Navy flakes and ropes are approximations of what sailors smoked in the heyday of the masted ship.   They are (and have been for decades) also approximations of tobacco firms' marketing departments. ""Navy Flake"" or ""Navy cut"" can mean almost anything. Those big ol sailing ships are cool!   And pure Virginia, maybe with a touch of sugar casing, is what made America sustainable back in the 1650s.   Thomas Rolfe (he was Pocahontas's hubby!) imported and cultivated the Orinoco seed in Virginia and exported the first tobaccos to Britain in 1615. Whether it was  cased, I don't know.   Oh, and nazi germany banned tobacco, so yeah, your closest option is some meth.   But they didn't actually. For example wermacht supplied pipes and tobacco to troops. You still see NOS pipes from that era on the German ebay. They did a lot of meth, that's true. They even have special speed chocolate for the panzer troops.

PipeTobacco,39373o,jarvis400,4,Tue Jun 9 04:35:36 2015 UTC,"The best answer would be to pick a period and research. There are so many tobaccos that are still made with ancient techniques. Samuel Gawith has a snuff mill made by monks to grind gunpower from the 17th century... still in use. Some 100 year old Prince albert Came into the market a while back. Several people tasted it and remarked how it hardly differed from the new stuff. I'd pick a place and explore from there. An easy one would be Einstein's tobacco, Revelation by Phillip Morris.

PipeTobacco,392qy1,ProphetOnandagus,4,Mon Jun 8 20:52:54 2015 UTC,"Hello! I am a longtime lurker recently turned participant myself.   That Grabow is probably starting to get some decent cake if you have 7-8 smokes on it. You definitely want to stock up on pipe cleaners (I always buy at least two packs with any order I place because I use them like crazy and they're cheap.) After that, if you really haven't cleaned that sucker after 7-8 smokes, twist off the stem and run some pipe cleaners through the shank and stem until they come out clean. With that many smokes and no cleaning you might also want to dip them in some alcohol to sweeten the pipe--could be grain alcohol or 91% upward isopropyl (there's an endless debate about using the latter; I've used it with zero ill effect) and run them through. Then I'd double up one of those cleaners and gently swab around the inside of the bowl--I say gently because you're probably just getting to some good cake and you don't want to rub it off (IMO you should keep the alcohol away from the bowl at this point.)   Also, if you're wanting to stick to cheap, over the counterish blends for now, you can't go wrong with Carter Hall or even better, Chatham Manor."

PipeTobacco,392qy1,Ciceronian,4,Mon Jun 8 21:26:43 2015 UTC,"Not pathetic at all. Frankly I have far more experience with alcohol than anyone should, grown-ass man or otherwise.  Isopropyl alcohol is the sort that can be found at any pharmacy or a Wal-Mart or Target or what have you. You can also order it on Amazon. I would recommend 99%, but anything 91% or up. This is medical grade stuff not made for human consumption.  The other option is any sort of grain alcohol (basically, extremely strong liquor)--namely Everclear, though Bacardi 151 rum or other liquids of comparable alcohol content are also used.

Just clean it now. You want two kinds of cleaners, bristle and soft. Use the bristle to scrub and the soft to wipe.   I like to use rum to clean with. Regular is fine. I use overproof white rum. Some people use whiskey or other spirits.   Wet the tip of a bristle brush lightly (not soaked) and gently scrub from the bit towards the bowl. Do that until the pipe cleaner comes out clean, then wipe with a soft.   Gently wipe out the bowl with an alcohol moistened soft cleaner.   Oh, and change the filter or remove it if it has one.

Half & Half is considered by many to be a decent smoke, so if you enjoy it, keep smoking it.  (I haven't tried it yet, but I enjoy the occasional Prince Albert.)  Here's my pipe cleaning routine, everyone has their own;  After each bowl, I wipe the inside of the stem with a regular pipe cleaner. (Don't remove the stem while it's hot.  never ever.)  Then I fold the pipe cleaner in half, and run it around the inside of the bowl to get the moisure, dottle and loose ash all out.  (I think it keeps the odor down, from my pipes stored in the house this way too.)  Once the pipe is cool, before I put it away, if it has a filter, I take the filter out and toss it.  Then I dip a new pipe cleaner in some whiskey (you need to get some if you haven't picked up that bad habit yet. :) ) and clean out the inside of the stem again.  That makes it nice and fresh for the next time.  Don't get any alcohol on the outside of your pipe.  I don't always take the stem off, but if I do, I do the whiskey treatment in the stem where everything fits together.   I only use the prickly bristled pipe cleaners when I'm cleaning an estate pipe.  My own pipes are kept clean by my usual routine and don't think they need the extra scratchy."

The tobacco arrived well too as well as the czech tool and the pipe cleaners, but since the pipe is the part that is different from each starter kit I decided to take a picture of it by itself. I am thinking about giving it a try today at night after my first exam from finals.   Some more pictures here: 1, 2, 3, 4  EDIT: I also took the filter out of the pipe already, ain't nobody got time for that."

I'm glad to see it finally got to you!If you've been reading up around the web and on the subreddit, then it should be quite a passable first session at least, but don't be too worried if everything doesn't seem to be going well either. The first time I smoked a pipe it certainly wasn't perfect, but it gets easier and better with a bit of practice. Cheers!"
PipeTobacco,391cob,IUseExtraCommas,3,Mon Jun 8 16:23:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, thanks! I am so glad that I finally have it, since thursday I had been calling each god damn day to the postal service offices but those guys seriously suck and most of the time didn't even answer the phone so today I got up early and went straight there and asked for my package, the lady who was there went looking for it and gave it to me in less than two minutes... I mean they obviously had it right there and were just taking their time with it, I hate them now."

PipeTobacco,391cob,shavinghobbit,2,Mon Jun 8 16:27:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks! As /u/LegesAequitas said I got those tobaccos that came with the reddit starter kit, I am thinking about first trying the straight virginia (5100) today, then in the next days try the VaPer (Stokkebye Luxury Bullseye) to try to distinguish the taste of Perique, then going with an aromatic in any given order (1-Q, Classic Burley Kake, Mixture Scottish), and after having tasted one aromatic or two, go with the english blend (my mixture 965) cause I've heard it is a great blend but it has the strongest tobacco flavor out of all the others so I want to taste it after tasting all others so to go easy on me haha"

I get gifted a lot of owl related things since I am studying law school and people relate owls with law here (I'm not sure if they are related everywhere) cause as far as I know owls are a representation for wisdom and not law, but perhaps it has something to do with lawyers and judges being wise people.  The wooden one is made from ""palofierro"", I think it's called desert ironwood in english which is a pretty hard wood as the name would suggest and it is used by indigenas here in México to make artesanías (artistic carvings from the wood in the shape of animals or any other thing)."

PipeTobacco,392l61,hvywldrnss,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:07:51 2015 UTC,Is this a general truism about pipe tobacco? The dryer it is the tighter one should pack it?
PipeTobacco,392l61,star_boy2005,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:40:46 2015 UTC,"Hmm... Well, I'm not really sure. I mean, when you think about it, if it's very dry and loosely packed, it'll burn quite hot and fast, as opposed to smoldering if it's tightly packed or more moist.  So just based on the rules of making fire, I would think it would be generally true."
PipeTobacco,392l61,levins0,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:58:16 2015 UTC,"That may be the explanation I've been looking for, for why my new favorite pipe packing technique, recently demonstrated by u/briarboy, which results in an extremely loose pack, has been working so successfully for me, given the fact that I tend to smoke very moist tobaccos."
PipeTobacco,392l61,star_boy2005,2,Wed Jun 10 22:23:54 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm not packing it tight enough, 'cause when I'm at the dog park, I light it up, step outta the truck, get the dog, and it's finished...pack tighter I guess...."

Twist: instead of borrowing my pickup truck he asked for help cleaning out his cellar.  Needless to say, he got plenty of offers to help.     Today a small flat rate arrived absolutely bulging with fine tobaccos.  All nicely labeled and accompanied by a friendly, informative letter.  /u/rkdc rejected all attempts by participants in his housecleaning to send shipping money, tins, housewarming gifts or flowers.     Let's keep an eye on Keith.  When he settles into his new home we need to organize a little Welcome Wagon basket.     Thanks for the excellent smokes, my friend."

He sent me a generous portion of 10 tobaccos.  8 were ones I had never tried. the other 2 were ones I'd tried and liked, and didn't have any more of.  I was chortling gleefully through the samples this morning, trying to decide which one to try next."
PipeTobacco,3912xa,lightningserpent,4,Mon Jun 8 14:38:25 2015 UTC,"Count me in.

PipeTobacco,392kti,PhysicsNovice,5,Mon Jun 8 20:12:33 2015 UTC,"Organizing is not my specialty.   Time to git gud. :) I know this'll sound cheesy... but, I'd start by writing a quick ""mission statement"" to really clarify what I'm trying to do. Write down your goal in a single sentence that will explain to anyone what you want. From there, start writing a list of things to do that help accomplish this, including gaining support from fellow smokers; different ways of getting the word out; how to turn that into leverage; establish contacts in the student body government; etc...  As for contact, reach out to the Seattle Pipe Club:   http://www.seattlepipeclub.org/  ... along with every little bit that social media, esp. Facebook, can turn up. Start a Facebook group, or website, or anything online that helps you organize people.  Recruit all the smokers you can: pipe smokers, cigar smokers, cigarette smokers, hookah smokers, and pot smokers. While I'm sure some would look on pipe and pot smokers as an unholy alliance, they might be appreciative of the notion of fighting against a general smoking ban, which may make their future endeavors more difficult to accomplish.  Know of any hookah or cigar bars? Hit em up and talk to people, find students, hand out cards or fliers. Post fliers on campus, if you're allowed. Know of any smoking faculty? Talk to them.  Turn these people into resources for further recruitment; research into the campus political process; gaining leverage (i.e. something you could boycott?); make a honking huge petition; set up a rotating schedule for people to contact those who've decided to exercise control on your personal life (with civility, yes? redddit != IRL), create propaganda... and, importantly, because all of this starts to look staggering, they better help with organization, your admitted not-quite-specialty.  tl;dr: write down what you want -> sell it to people -> get those people to help you do everything  Good luck.  Oh, and do be ready for the hate. Hopefully reddit has somewhat prepared you for that. :)"

PipeTobacco,392kti,levins0,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:43:48 2015 UTC,Im not sure. Organizing is not my specialty. There are no forums for UW students with any traction.

PipeTobacco,392kti,levins0,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:00:56 2015 UTC,Yeah that's a tough one. Even an unofficial club would help I think. Maybe try to hang out in the DSA's and talk to like minded people? Then you can start an email list or even a petition.

If you plan on smoking them, clean out the stems and shanks with pipe cleaners, cotton swabs, and the alcohol of your choice (only damp not wet). Then, slap a softie bit on there and have at it."
PipeTobacco,38zjla,blenheim45,3,Mon Jun 8 06:03:26 2015 UTC,"Even if you splurge, and buy new stems, they don't actually break the bank. 4noggins lists them for 89 cents each.  great care has to be taken if your try to ream them, as you can easily go through the bottom of cobs.  And they should not get the alcohol and salt treatment."
PipeTobacco,38zjla,Piffyr,2,Mon Jun 8 06:40:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'd suggest reaming with a pipe knife rather than a reamer. These old cobs can be brittle and the outward pressure from even gently reaming can be enough to shatter it. Ask me how I know. No, wait. Don't."
PipeTobacco,38zail,FredBassdrop,4,Mon Jun 8 02:36:39 2015 UTC,"I hear ya, man, and good on you for not sticking with the sticks, but I can tell you as a guy with a former pack-a-day, better than 10-year-long cigarette habit, that six months of cigarettes did not make you a nicotine addict. That's a whole different monkey on your back."
PipeTobacco,38zail,Piffyr,2,Mon Jun 8 06:25:29 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I dropped it when I did, it's difficult when a lot of people I work with and in my family smoking cigarettes"
PipeTobacco,38zail,Piffyr,3,Mon Jun 8 10:56:48 2015 UTC,"I was raised in the tobacco belt. Everybody smoked cigarettes. It was almost a rite of passage. Like you weren't really a man until you started smoking sticks. Switching to a pipe and not inhaling the smoke was one of the hardest things that I have ever done, but sooooo worth it. I wish I had done it years before."
PipeTobacco,38zail,mocktheweakforfun,3,Mon Jun 8 13:16:04 2015 UTC,back during my basic training I dropped the pipe and picked up the smokes so I could still do smoke breaks(we'd have 5 minutes if we were lucky). they made me feel like crap and that I needed the nicotine. picked up a cheap cob at a local shop and smoked it during the field training dropped the smokes for good.
PipeTobacco,38zail,naughty_corner,3,Mon Jun 8 12:15:25 2015 UTC,"I've been a filthy cigarette smoker for most of my life now and still am.  I picked up the pipe about 5 years ago (not counting that time I tried pipe smoking in college with no idea what I was doing... it didn't turn out well).  I initially had trouble not inhaling, but soon got over it.  Now I smoke a pipe because it keeps me from chain smoking cigarettes and it tastes wonderful and is just overall a more relaxing experience.    The interesting part for me, was that pipe smoking ruined a lot of cigarette brands for me.  When you smoke quality pipe tobacco, you tend to notice how shitty and awful cigarette tobacco is.  So now I can only smoke mostly brightleaf Virigina blends (like American Spirits or Winstons) because even a crappy Virginia isn't all that bad.  But crappy burleys are disgusting (and most US cigarettes are burley based).  My Father-In-Law smokes Marlboros and I have to keep my distance from him, because the second-hand tastes/smells like dog-shit to me now."
PipeTobacco,38zail,raizel_234,2,Mon Jun 8 14:43:29 2015 UTC,2nd this wholeheartedly!
PipeTobacco,38zail,tribial,2,Tue Jun 9 00:03:33 2015 UTC,"totally true.  I have been smoking about 3-6 cobs a day of various tobaccos, or less if I smoke out of a bigger briar, and I have not bought cigs for about a week or more due to this. However if I am out drinking and a friend lights up I end up begging. Step in the right direction I guess."
PipeTobacco,38zail,tankbuster183,2,Tue Jun 9 13:10:34 2015 UTC,Yes....I smoked cigs for anout 10 years and pipes for 2 or so.  I used to bum a smoke from coworkers on stressful days; it tastes so disgusting to me now I don't even bother.
PipeTobacco,38yovd,Hornberg,6,Sun Jun 7 23:37:26 2015 UTC,Definitely worth a restore just to display it. That's a beautiful piece.
PipeTobacco,38yovd,carnesy,2,Sun Jun 7 23:40:04 2015 UTC,"Awesome! He was much more of a cigarette smoker during my lifetime so I wasn't sure if it was a decent pipe for either purpose, but I've been hoping that I'd be able to have an occasional smoke out of it. Thanks!"
PipeTobacco,38yovd,blenheim45,6,Sun Jun 7 23:47:47 2015 UTC,"Yes worth restoring, and not a pipe to start restoring on your own.  I have been reconditioning briars for my own use for decades and i would send that one out.  Meerschaum is great to smoke, but easy to screw up if you don't know what you are about.    Just as a general hint, when you see metal hardware on a pipe and it is stamped ""sterling"" or something similar you know it is a cut above the average.  When you see gold it is even a cut above that, and we are looking at gold here I believe.  Now not all makers were or are equal, but this pipe would have been marketed as the best this manufacturer was offering, and that is a good sign.  and i would also guess from the styling, that the pipe is pre-WW2, and possibly a good deal older than that, so that stem may be amber, another expensive ""frill"", and another item that can be trickly to work with.  when you have it refurbished i would suggest also getting a modern stem for every day smoking, given the fragility of amber.  As a note from my personal experience, i recently offered an old Dunhill for sale to SP.com, with a replacement stem.  I was told that the replacement stem lowered the price in half.  I suspect if you ever wished to sell this pipe in the future and you had to replace that amber stem you would have the same sad news.  So the investment of $20 to $30 for a lucite stem to give the same appearance for using today, and preserving the old stem, would be a good investment."
PipeTobacco,38yovd,Piffyr,5,Mon Jun 8 04:04:24 2015 UTC,"That's not an amber stem, Blen. It's bakelite. Definitely pre-WW2 though, and also definitely worth restoring, and definitely shouldn't be a first restoration attempt.  Oh, and definitely a damn good looking pipe!"
PipeTobacco,38yovd,blenheim45,3,Mon Jun 8 06:09:02 2015 UTC,"t.y.  ""Too clear"" to be amber? or are you using another tell tale for that positive identification of the material.  I have seen clear amber, although my amber stem is a milky yellow orange, but then so are most of my old bakelites.  [See folks even old farts can be seeking to learn more, and i am not a ""know it all"", just a ""know a fair bit"" guy. LOL]"
PipeTobacco,38yovd,Piffyr,3,Mon Jun 8 06:35:37 2015 UTC,"Mostly from the color, Blen, but also the clarity as you said. Cherry amber exists, but it is extremely rare and almost always forms in pieces too small and impure to carve a stem from. Even if you were to find some, it wouldn't have that amount of clarity for a pipe this old. It would be more opaque with a brownish patina. As I understand it, it was popular to pass off red Bakelite as cherry amber around the turn of the century. Since then, a whole mess of confusion has set in."
PipeTobacco,38yovd,blenheim45,4,Mon Jun 8 06:53:36 2015 UTC,"From the point of using the pipe i would prefer almost anything to amber, given how prone to breaking it is.  however from point of view of value for selling at some later date amber is of course a horse resin of a whole different color. LOL"

PipeTobacco,38yp8m,tochrais,3,Sun Jun 7 23:43:59 2015 UTC,"I'd stay away from anything spiced or swampy. Try your hand at some burley or virginia that's about as raw as they come... I'd say maybe same gawith Full Virginia Flake; it comes super moist and it's sweet but not overly sweet.   Honestly though, you're probably best off just sticking to actual chew."
PipeTobacco,38yp8m,Mordenkrad,2,Sun Jun 7 23:52:21 2015 UTC,Kendal twist is a rope that was originally used for chewing. Stuffs strong though and not to my taste but you might enjoy it. Same/similar taste to 1792 flake since both kendals.

PipeTobacco,38wgyo,trymeout,3,Sun Jun 7 15:05:10 2015 UTC,"Seems to me like an ""in a hurry"" version of the frank method. You just discard the first step, which consists on filling the pipe using gravity only. In both methods you end up having this almost-empty chamber beneath the tobacco, though in the Frank's method there's supposedly a bit more tobacco in there.  Question: can we consider this method as an approximation of the reverse calabash effect. It kinda follows the same principle, no?"
PipeTobacco,38wgyo,mastercylinder1,2,Sun Jun 7 15:17:19 2015 UTC,It's funny you mention the reverse calabash effect bc Fred Hanna says the same thing in his book The Perfect Smoke.
PipeTobacco,38wgyo,trymeout,2,Mon Jun 8 21:18:29 2015 UTC,"Funny indeed :) How do you rate the book by the way? I never indulged myself into pipe-related literature, but it might be interesting actually."
PipeTobacco,38wgyo,mastercylinder1,3,Mon Jun 8 22:25:33 2015 UTC,"It's certainly worth the read bc it's just a compilation of some of his published essays. I will warn you though; I spend about $50 on tobacco after I finished reading it. I'm actually glad for once that I can't afford a fancy pipe bc would have spent money on those too. I feel like Hanna tends to brag or talk himself up sometimes but there's no real harm in that haha. However, the man did make the Legends and Wilderness blends from McClelland (haven't tried them yet but I hear and see nothing but good things) and was given the Doctor Of Pipes award by the CPCC."
PipeTobacco,38x17r,myrden,8,Sun Jun 7 15:48:15 2015 UTC,I always bend a pipe cleaner in half and swab out the bowl when I finish.  Goes a long way towards alleviating stinky pipe syndrome in between smokes.
PipeTobacco,38x17r,ilikelissie,5,Sun Jun 7 17:56:40 2015 UTC,"Totally normal. If you let it rest for a few days, it will most likely smell like the blend you smoked. You should at least let it rest until it's cooled before smoking again - unless it a cob, in which case, have at it :)"
PipeTobacco,38x17r,PipeBeard,2,Sun Jun 7 15:54:58 2015 UTC,"ok cool, the blend I smoked was really nice smelling and I was just making sure I didn't fuck up somehow, so far I'm absolutely loving everything about pipe smoking though"
PipeTobacco,38x17r,levins0,4,Sun Jun 7 15:59:53 2015 UTC,"Yup, totally normal. After all, what's left in there after a bowl is... Burned up tobacco, aka ash.   You can just leave it, let the pipe rest for a day, and then smoke more.  Or, you can clean it. I like to clean my pipes after each bowl, but it's not a long, serious scrub. I take a pipe cleaner, dip it in alcohol (I use overproof rum), and run it through the stem from the bit to the bowl. Then I fold the other end, dip, and gently wipe the bowl. It takes 10 seconds, but it keeps the pipe sweet.   I also change the filter if the pipe has one. I like them, and they are cheap. A lot of people just toss them and don't use filters.   Note that you don't want to fully clean out the bowl. You want some cake to build up in there, but not too much. About the thickness of between a US dime and nickel works well for most bowls."
PipeTobacco,38x17r,ITthisIsBen,3,Sun Jun 7 20:07:28 2015 UTC,"Just got the Starter Kit you did about a month ago and had the same experience with the ashy smell and taste. If you got the Cob, the cornish flavor will fade as well. I left the cake after smoking and did not scrape out the bowl, cleaned everything else, this REALLY helps out. About 8-10 bowls in, you should not experience that smell/taste at all. Stay with it, you'll be glad you did."
PipeTobacco,38x17r,arterianSanor,2,Mon Jun 8 00:31:37 2015 UTC,"It is normal! I remember I asked myself the same question, but I thought it was normal, (my first pipe smoking experience was in a cob) but you are lucky for having a really nice first experience. Because mine was horrible, and almost turned me away from pipe smoking."
PipeTobacco,38x17r,jelbert6969,2,Sun Jun 7 16:23:18 2015 UTC,Will smell ashy at first. Just use a dry paper towel and pipe cleaner to clean. Do not take apart when it's warm. After a few ounces it will stop smelling ashy and smell neutral or good if you smoke aromatic.
