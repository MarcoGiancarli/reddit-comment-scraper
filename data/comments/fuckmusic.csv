fuckmusic,3dstnr,WhoSaidOctopus,4,Sun Jul 19 03:00:24 2015 UTC,"Something I find funny about this song is that when asked about it recently, Jello Biafra said that Jerry Brown wasn't actually that bad."
fuckmusic,3doexi,spicedpumpkins,2,Fri Jul 17 22:48:11 2015 UTC,Still have no idea what this song is about... But damn..

fuckmusic,3d86pq,natearchibaldy,3,Tue Jul 14 07:04:50 2015 UTC,"The Cramps were the kind of band that inspired intense reactions. Some people thought they were absolutely the worst band they ever heard. Others, like myself, appreciated their demented, primitive, unique sound. The Cramps: You either love them or hate them. The members of the band did not give a shit. That's how they rolled."

fuckmusic,3d51mc,-Pelvis-,3,Mon Jul 13 16:08:49 2015 UTC,"OP here. Hmm, I just found this sub. I might have misinterpreted the theme as ""music for lovemaking"".  I just read the rest of the sidebar, and discovered ""/r/MusicToFuckTo"". I'll take my sensuality over there if I'm making it a little too steamy in here."
fuckmusic,3d5km3,natearchibaldy,3,Mon Jul 13 18:23:06 2015 UTC,"This song was written and produced by the ""Godfather Of Soul"", James Brown. Parts of this song have been sampled in many rap/hip hop records."
fuckmusic,3d0apx,spicedpumpkins,2,Sun Jul 12 12:18:38 2015 UTC,"+44 was formed shortly after the 2005 breakup of Blink-182, and the band's name refers to the international dialing code of the United Kingdom."
