Secondly, I'm tired of all the expats who move to Dubai and decide to buy a F150 et al, simply because they can and bigger is better. This should force people to make more sensible choices when buying cars (from an environmental point of view). Finally, it may also bring down the price of second hand luxury cars as they be less in demand.  p.s. This may double the price from the current 0.46usd to 1.10usd per litre"

dubai,3e66kj,codydodd,2,Wed Jul 22 06:54:35 2015 UTC,"I always wanted to know how a 'jam' session actually works - do you all just play a string of chords and bounce off each other adding different bits and pieces? Or do you pick a song that you all know and play a different arrangement? I can just about dabble on piano/organ, but I play by ear and can't read sheet music..lolz. Would be an interesting thing to try!"
dubai,3e66kj,theregos,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:06:40 2015 UTC,"Cool questions! There is no right or wrong way to jam :)  Playing complimentary chords works great.  This is my preferred method. Although playing songs both already know is a good way to warm up of course!   I usually just turn on a couple of drum machines or throw down some simple kicks and we just sort of play around with chords until someone says, ""woh, that was cool"". We save it, clean it up, (on the DAW, in my case Abelton), and then we build on top of that. It's actually quite common to walk away from a jam session with a cool sounding mini-song.  Sitting on it over night or over a week sometimes leads to, ""hey, I thought about that song, we should do this, or add this, or sing this"". Or, the next time, we just start all over again.  After a month or so of this a crew can start to read each other pretty well. Or not, and it was fun once or twice, and was still worth it.  This is generally how i've always done it.  For better or worse, it turns out fun.  I do have a Midi-controller, which is essentially a light keyboard (unfortunately not weighted though), but I connect it to hundreds if not thousands of samples and virtual instruments, from piano, to organ, to hell, string instruments and ambient effects and more.  So if you don't have any equipment you can jam on that.  But a good quality keyboard of course is better for dedicated piano/organ jamming.  Midi-controllers are more for effects, hit-sample, and producing.  As for sheet music, plenty of famous musicians who don't know how either.  Over time though, jamming with a crew sometimes leads to them learning it faster/easier.  Otherwise, playing with chords is easy.  Pick a root key, pick a key signature, and have fun.  And using Ableton allows us to record as we play (including keystrokes) so we can manual move them and change them later if we want to get creative.    My two cents. Cool!

dubai,3e2bn1,walloon5,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:17:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it's really fun and rewarding to get to talk to you --   Is your company the company that was victimized here? (Or are you just the reporter?) Or are you just an ordinary citizen of Dubai and you truly cannot comment on it because ... people just don't talk about things like that?  The cultural divide between here and there in ""how things work"" must be really ... larger than I thought.   In our country, people try to sneak in and in yours it's like they try to sneak out :) I laugh because it's all so absurd when you think about it.   Hope your day is going well."

dubai,3e44sc,dadis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:04:40 2015 UTC,In bur Dubai- bank street you can find many Wholesale and retail stores for computer spare parts
dubai,3e44sc,sulthanr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:14:29 2015 UTC,"Some of the shops that you can buy parts and even whole PC's online and get it delivered to your residence.  1- http://gear-up.me/  2- http://computerpad.ae/  3- http://uae.dtcae.com/  the prices are different from site to site, but they often are nearby.   However, I do recommend Al Ain centre in Dubai if you can go over there in person, the prices are often lower than these sites and you can take it back yourself to them if there are any issues.  These sites do offer fixing, but for example the 3rd one I believe asks you to bring it to him, not him picking it up. I didn't try the 1st and the 2nd in term of returning a product, however I did order from them many times and their stuff work. Didn't have any issue.  If you're worried then stick to Al Ain Centre, that way you probably got nothing to worry about, but if you can, try out the sites. Talk to their respective live chats if you need more info or help.   Good luck!"

dubai,3e1rzc,mooderdxb,4,Tue Jul 21 09:02:08 2015 UTC,Yes it is a sales tactic. The fuel tank cleaner does not stop fuel tank bubbling. That tends to be caused by a hot exhaust under the fuel inlet. Mustangs suffer badly from this.

dubai,3e1rzc,techie825,2,Tue Jul 21 19:21:52 2015 UTC,If you had no air in your fuel tank you'd have a vacuum and wouldn't get any fuel to the engine.  They are talking shite and yes some work slightly to clean the injectors but it's brand and damage specific so basically not even worth trying

dubai,3e1rzc,el7delasuerte,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:12:30 2015 UTC,If you are sending your car to the regular service then no real need for it. You can always tell them that you've already used it and that the guy selling it to you said not to use it before another 5000 KM else it will damage your engine. That will put an end to this dilemma.
dubai,3e1rzc,Alexandria1970,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:06:28 2015 UTC,The fuel injection cleaner is actually good for your engine. I'm all for them conveniently selling it at the pump.

I'm just at a time in life when I'm lucky to get 30-40 minutes to play on any given day, and it's just not enough time to get into the game. I don't have the inclination to wander the world in those short bursts. The Witcher definitely needs longer sittings to enjoy it fully.

I've already had Fifa15, Shadow of Mordor, and CoD. I used to be like OP ""I will never find time for other games, but I can always play Fifa"". But I told myself, if I have time for Fifa, I can surely squeeze in another game. And it worked.  I started by limiting the number of games I play on Fifa, for example, I could play for 2 hours straight. But I would end up getting bored. Like really bored. So I limited it to 1 hour, and forced myself playing another game, whether it's RPG or Adventure, etc... I found that very helpful. I got to enjoy booting up my PS4 and having a rhythm of playing. Even if it's to play a few hours on the weekend.   I love every game that I own right now. I finished MGS and Shadow of Mordor, and now I have more time to play other games. It feels good."

dubai,3dy27m,BrandSeph,4,Mon Jul 20 15:04:04 2015 UTC,"Been here 20 years in total. Was abroad for few years. Changes- loads of them.    Dubai has really risen up on the global stage. From being another city in the gulf to a trading hub. Everybody now knows dubai compared to when it wasnt as popular. Lots of new developments. I was outside dubai from 2006 to 2012. In that period alone, the metro, burj khalifa, dubai mall, festival city, jbr, marina, jlt etc all came up. Plus loads of new communities were built. And the city expanded. Population grew and so the traffic.  Its become a lot lot more expansive to live in dubai. At one point of time healthcare was cheap and readily available at govt hospitals. You had very few private hospitals. Except for Iranian hospital, I cant think of another private hospital in the 90s and even Iranian hospital was cheap.

Funnily though, it was Dubai-Shj highway then and not just 'Ittihad road' Unikai Strawberry Milk. Yazoo milk. Pumpys AED 1 pizza.  Before Carrefour there was Continent. Shoutout to everyone who's watched a desi movie at the open air Rex Cinemas in Rashidiya! Coolest way to watch a movie back then. Movie tickets were AED 20. Etisalat's logo was horrifying Riqqa-Muraqqabat streets used to come alive during DSF That reminds me, the DSF was not reduced to shopping discounts at the mall, we went to the night souqs at the Creek, the rides on Riqqa-Muraqqabat, and Global Village kept changing it's locations yearly.

dubai,3dya3o,SupremeHumanBeing,3,Tue Jul 21 05:34:55 2015 UTC,"Only talking about Investment banking, Mgmt Consulting, general Corporate finance internships here.  Two ways you can get an internship:   Ask your pops if he knows people in the industry. If you're lucky, he knows a partner/MD in which case you will very likely get an internship for a month or so. You ask around yourself. That's going to be hard. Look at efinancialcareers or stalk the recruitment officer and give them a call/personal email if they have that info posted on LinkedIn (surprising number of people do) and sacrifice a goat because chances to land an internship this way is slim at best.   Even if you land an internship here, unless it's with a very good company (read Booz, McK, a boutique I bank) your internship is very likely going to be bullshit. I know firsthand because I've interned at ""good"" companies on paper, who just didn't do much work, or didn't know how to delegate work, or didn't have any sort of internship programme so they didn't know what to do with me.   Finally, because of this crappy internship, you wouldn't have had a chance to prove yourself, so you can't show why they should hire you. You leave in a month's time with nothing but a paltry monthly ""salary"" and a nice name on your resume.   I apologize for pissing on your bonfire, but that's the way it is around here.

dubai,3dxv3p,blitzik,8,Mon Jul 20 12:49:33 2015 UTC,"Ultimately it is your own responsibility that you are not illegal in the country you reside, no questions about that. Never assume that anybody in this country is doing things not asked for. Always be on top of everything important for you, and don't let a HR department or manager stall things like visa.  If you cant convince the company yourself, i dont see any other options - you can go to MOL, but they will not do much more than report it and then you might end up with a beef with your company, which could end to you loosing your job.  My advice, go to your manager and/or the one that decided to hire you and let them know how this has been handled, if they cant help you, then pay the cost yourself, move on and consider looking for a new job.  Is your company a freezone company ? (where is it based?)"
dubai,3dxv3p,EsbenB,2,Mon Jul 20 13:19:58 2015 UTC,"If you cant convince the company yourself, i dont see any other options - you can go to MOL, but they will not do much more than report it and then you might end up with a beef with your company, which could end to you loosing your job.   yeah, that's pretty risky considering the fact that working while on a visit visa (which is what you were doing visa runs for) is illegal. work it out with your company or leave them. /u/EsbenB is right - it is your responsibility"
dubai,3dxv3p,sharleygood,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:30:39 2015 UTC,Mainland. I am interested in seeking free zone work if this is not resolved in my favor though. Any advice on how to seek employment there?
dubai,3dxv3p,spcman_spiff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:26:53 2015 UTC,"EsbenB's spot on. ultimately (if I've understood correctly), you were on a personal visit visa, which is your sole responsibility. If the company has covered others' fines in the past, I'd say you still have a chance at getting them to pay up.    And when I received my work credential, I asked wether or not I would have to leave the country to renew my visa. I was told no, and that I would be fine.   Who told you this? If it wasn't the same HR person I'd petition them first, then move up the chain if you don't get the result you need. I'm sure you already know this, but it's best to be tactful about it, so as not to start your new job off on the wrong foot. Good luck!"

But to to give you an idea of what I do. I was one of the first people in the UAE to start using a fork at the tender age of 13, I took using a fork so serious that I became a master at using forks. I went onto work with the manufacturers of forks, and now when a place wants to start selling forks, using forks or someone simply wants to see a fork, I am the person everyone goes to. When the store wants to sell a fork, they not only get me in to show them how to use a fork, but they get me to show them how to build the product display for the forks, market the forks and ultimately sell the forks. I work with governments, companies and individuals for all their fork needs, of course there is a few other people that claim to be masters of forks but they feed of my scraps and they only know how to use sporks made for toddlers and they don't have access to the big boy forks.  *edit: forks are a metaphor."

You mention interracial marriage but don't mention where you are from. I would say for something that would basically be an arranged marriage finding someone from a similar culture background is kind of important because you don't have the whole madly in love thing to help you deal with the cultural differences.  I know some girls that would be for arranged marriages (ok i might know one possible girl) but girls like that usually depend on their parents to find them a suitable match and want to marry up not down.  Why not ask your parents to find you a girl back home that understands that you can't pay a large dowry?

Most people I know got their jobs through wasta. Try adding the HRs of the companies in linkedin. It might help.
dubai,3dtj1w,gutterandstars,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:42:58 2015 UTC,Yeah - skype id was missing. Will try that way to reach as well. :)

dubai,3dtj1w,gutterandstars,-1,Sun Jul 19 09:53:33 2015 UTC,"This is very generic to me and may not be applicable to me given my experience. With due respect - Your advice would have worked best for an intern level candidate and to the position mid or above level positions I guess there need to be a better way - first, find a way to source the jobs and next to apply and then follow up. Fine tuning to your suggestion may work as per the comment of greenleaf in the comments..."
dubai,3dtj1w,gutterandstars,5,Sun Jul 19 10:19:13 2015 UTC,"ok but you've already applied online to 640+ positions over the last 6 months...if you're profile is ~85% matching with the JD, why isn't HR making the first call? You gotta get past 'em and the only person in your case is ze hiring manager...share your resume with dem and make em pass your resume to HR. How senior are you?"

Just beware of rip off merchants and make sure you detail the condition of the jet ski before you head out.

dubai,3dt73e,arcadian10,6,Sun Jul 19 05:34:46 2015 UTC,"From my limited understanding, it depends on what your contract states. The ones that I have had in previous occasions states either party(employer and/or employee) is free to terminate employment contract for any reason if it's still within probation period (usually 6 months) within a day. After that, stipulated notice period must be given (standard is 30 days, although i have seen much longer too). Hope that helps."

But do yourself a solid and call MOL - they are willing to help, but call them a few times, you will not always get the right answer the first time. My approach is to call them until I have gotten the same answer twice - Normally it takes 3 calls :)"

The most basic thing to do would be take the metro down to Burj Khalifa/Dubai Mall and wander around for a few hours then head back, this way you'll get to see some of the city from the metro and then the Burj Khalifa up close, and there's a bunch of stuff to do in the mall (ice skating, gold souk, good food, etc).

dubai,3dlshh,Najibthegreat,2,Fri Jul 17 13:32:06 2015 UTC,"I would sugggest to look a little bit far from dubai for exmple, Sports City, silicone oasis for studio 35-45k per year, if you plan to take a place in a dorm I think it's more expensive but you can check.  I am not sure where you exactly you study but there is a 90% change you need a car."
dubai,3dlshh,Thief_Extraordinaire,2,Fri Jul 17 13:53:47 2015 UTC,"Dorms are actually cheaper here, at least compared to apartments.  Its usually better to have your school nearby, but to my experience things might not be...private for you. Some of the dorms of schools dont allow girls in boys sections, others could say a visitor can come and see you till 1am and so on.  Per semester you might end up paying from 15000 to 30000 dirhams (4084 to around 9000 dollars) depending on your school, if you are sharing the room with someone, how many people you share it with (usually 1, or 2 people can share a room but sometimes 4) etc. If its a room for 2 people and you dont want to share you can ask to pay for 2 people (dont know if they'll allow it).  Silcon oasis is far cheaper but is so far from knowledge village you need a car. It ultimately depends on how much you want/have to spend and how ok you are with sharing a room.  My suggestion is to stay in your school's dorms (for at least the first semester), and its way easier for a newcomer to settle to a place owned by your school, so you'll get to know the place well and take your time searching for apartment REALLY look at them before the semester is over, this way you'll have chosen the best choice before the semester is over.  And you should check dubizzle when you are in dubai looking for apartments, call the number of the apartment you like and go and see them (though you should know the good apartments are taken in less than 2 days that they are posted, because other people have more time to check for good apartments daily)"

dubai,3ddo2g,zaugnakhaldun,3,Wed Jul 15 13:31:11 2015 UTC,I got my open water padi license a few weeks ago over in Oman. I really can't help you with your questions specifically but I do know that there are a fair few scuba divers here in Dubai. Google nomad dive school in Dibba Oman and ask them some questions. There are some awesome people there and they may be able to point you in the right direction here in Dubai.
dubai,3ddo2g,yourefunny,3,Wed Jul 15 13:37:14 2015 UTC,Diving in July is fine. The water temperature is comfortable. It can get a little hot waiting on the boat but nothing too bad. Most of the instructors speak reasonably clear English in my experience.  You will often meet regular divers. Best places to dive locally are Musandam and Daymaniyat Islands IMO. Visibility in Dubai is not great but there are some interesting wrecks.
dubai,3ddo2g,frillytotes,2,Wed Jul 15 14:19:41 2015 UTC,"Check out Al Boom Diving located on Al Wasl in Jumeira. They run trips to Fujairah including transport there for about AED 1500 I think. All trained and English speaking instructors and know where to find the best sealife, including sharks, squid, eels, lionfish and more."
dubai,3ddo2g,ifonlyitwasyou,2,Wed Jul 15 15:44:05 2015 UTC,you may want to check sky and sea at sheraton JBR. they have a few turkish diving instructors. they also have a branch at fujeirah.

dubai,3ddfio,TaigaBlitz,3,Wed Jul 15 12:06:16 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if many would understand what yakiniku is
dubai,3ddfio,fobb94,2,Wed Jul 15 13:25:47 2015 UTC,Yakiniku is grilled meat and Sumibiya is a Japanese restaurant in Dubai that serves Yakiniku.
dubai,3ddfio,will_code,2,Wed Jul 15 18:41:46 2015 UTC,Not Japanese but the Korean restaurant at the Asiana hotel offers similar style self cooking.

dubai,3ddfio,daddydidncare,2,Wed Jul 15 16:08:28 2015 UTC,Wouldn't Yakiniku self cooking lead to issues with the health authority? Placing uncooked meat at the table would mean that somebody unaware of Yakiniku would eat it as-is and suffer from some kind of infection.

Why not go to a Shabu Shabu restaurant instead if you're on a budget? Much cheaper and still fun to all cook around a hotpot?

dubai,3dcowt,PlzDontBreakMyArm,4,Wed Jul 15 06:09:39 2015 UTC,"My initial salary for an entry level bank job working in the UAE was about 8,600 AED. I rent a flat in Sharjah and commute to work by crossing the border on foot and taking a cab, the bus, the metro, etc.  I'm not big into clubbing, shopping, or festivals and only go out once or twice a week to restaurants or net cafes with my friends. If you're frugal enough or a homebody you can save a good 1,000 AED a month and live a comfortable life.  I could save a lot more money if I shared a flat with someone, or rented further in Sharjah and had a car and didn't mind the commute, or rented a room in a villa in Dubai but I don't like to share my living space and hate driving/owning and paying for a car so I pay extra.  Monthly Expenses are: 3600 rent, ~170 utilities, 450 internet/mobile (can be cheaper if you use prepaid), ~1000 for transportation, and 500-1000 for food depending on how you eat.   That leaves you 2380 AED to spend for other things besides basic necessities and That's good enough for me. I received a decent raise after a couple months of work and this job is simply entry level stuff, so I don't plan to stay in this position for long. Health insurance is provided by your company here as well.  Your best bet for entry level work here is to either have connections, be local, or just get lucky. If you have family here who can provide for you while you search, it might be a good idea to experience Dubai and look for work in person at your own pace for a couple months."

Dubai used to be rely on oil and gas, but currently it only provides 2% of its income. [1]  Granted that there are other sectors such as transportation hubs and ports, but they're nowhere near enough to carry the whole country forward. Even other sectors like real estate on dependent on Dubai being a tourism hub.  How long have you lived in Dubai?"

But here's your mistake: ""Today, Dubai has focused its economy on tourism by building hotels and developing real estate"". 'Focused' just means they're spending more on the tourism sector. As for actual ""source of income"", it is by no means solely tourism, please see: http://www.capmresearch.com/reportfiles/image/dubai_chart.jpg"

I know this woman, and I can assure you she's not that kind of person who'd rage on social media and swear around like how you put it. Even if she did, that isn't enough reason to throw someone in prison. You know what is a good reason to throw someone in prison? Shoving a cattle prod up somebody's ass, with enough video evidence. You know what was the judgement passed for this case? That the guy shoving the cattle prod and torturing the victim was under the influence of supernatural/unexplained events."

However, going for a wage as low as 7000 AED/pm for a masters degree holder from USA is an understatement imho. With this salary, you would barely have a decent lifestyle here which means it would be difficult for you to have your own personal accomodation and good social life. Think about the fact that a cab driver in Dubai makes around 4000 - 4500 AED/pm and you would know what I am trying to convey here. So I would highly recommend you to set your bar higher before settling down in UAE. Best of luck with the job hunting! Cheers!"

I am not sure why you aren't getting job offers. You should gotten quite a few by now."
dubai,3db6tb,Safwanish,2,Wed Jul 15 10:35:18 2015 UTC,"What matters more than your skin colour and nationality is the quality of the education and training you have received. You are more likely (but not guaranteed of course) to have had the privilege of good education and training if you are from a developed country. You can get good education and traning in developing countries but it is more accessible if you are in a developed country. It's unfortunate, but that's the way of the world - rich countries can afford to educate and train their youth to a higher average standard. It's no surprise that many of the brightest and best from developing countries move to USA/UK/Europe/etc. to get their education if they can afford it.  This is often why there is the impression that people from Europe/USA/etc. get better jobs; it is not simply the colour of their skin (and bear in mind of course that people of all skin colours live in these countries), it is the fact they have had better access to the world's top universities and training from respected employers.   Unfortunately people from developing countries such as India, Pakistan, etc. are much less likely to have had the same quality of training. There are some who get access to these opportunities, either through luck or wealth or connections, and they do just as well as their peers from developed countries. They are the privileged few however."

If you get stopped show them the copy and tell them you lost your license and the police asked you to report it after 7 days of going missing and you are on day 3 or 4.   They will accept this as there is no way to verify when you walked into the station to report it and the current procedure is to wait 7 days in case someone finds it and returns it.  I once went through almost a year after having lost my license and was stopped quite a few times and this always worked.
dubai,3d9flg,Erik_TL,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:16:03 2015 UTC,"Law states it is absolutely necessary to have the original license on you if you're driving. Giving them a license number will definitely not work. Showing a picture of the license might, but there is a very less chance. Either the cop has to be in a really, really good mood, or you've to be a local with good wasta (not just any local). A friend of my left his wallet at home, had someone bring it, and the cop let him go. But this is definitely one off. Penalties, from what I've heard, include nasty fines and jail-time.

dubai,3d2f8k,will_code,3,Mon Jul 13 01:56:37 2015 UTC,"It's tough to specify key differences between us, as we are all almost the same. However, we can tell each other apart. First, the dialect is different in these areas. Just by their speech, we can tell what area they are from. Second, there are slight differences in the clothes we wear, especially the kandoora. For instance, saudi people often wear black leather shoes, while we wear the flipper thing we call ""na'al"". Even the collar popularity differs. Of course, we cal also tell each other apart by our last names, or even our looks sometimes."
dubai,3d2f8k,topscorrerwinkwink,2,Mon Jul 13 10:29:51 2015 UTC,"Yea, this is a tough one. I would say not much."
dubai,3d2f8k,sageandonion,7,Mon Jul 13 06:46:30 2015 UTC,"I suppose that really Arabian tribal culture is not constrained by borders. Northern Emiratis are very Omani in dress style, where as Abu Dhabian Emiratis tend to be closer to Saudi/Qatari influences. A Saudi living in Qatif is likely to be very Bahraini compared to one living in Jizan."
dubai,3d2f8k,3gaway,2,Mon Jul 13 07:01:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is the best answer. I can point out differences but it's difficult to separate them by country. The cultures are more similar than different, but i'll add some examples of differences.  Northern Oman and UAE both have a Shehhi (mountain dwellers) influence who have a different cultural background and a very distinct dialect.  Different levels of conservatism shape  the culture in small ways as well. Najdis are generally the most conservative in the region so their culture is much more religion-centered, while Kuwaitis are the most liberal.  Like everyone said, there are differences in clothes. Another lesser known example is the Burqa (not the Pakistani Burqa), which is worn in Oman, UAE, Qatar, and few parts of Saudi Arabia. The Burqa style even differs in each of these regions. The Burqa is mostly common in the older generation and isn't worn a lot today.  I've only been to Oman once so I don't really know much about it, but their culture is pretty different. The parts where I could see a difference were their clothes, accessories (such as the Khinjar and their strap), dialect, some of their food, and some parts of their lifestyle. Hejazi culture is a little different too."
dubai,3d2f8k,3gaway,0,Mon Jul 13 18:57:21 2015 UTC,"The khinjar (if you're referring to the dagger i believe you are) is a yemen thing more than a oman thing. Also im not sure what you mean by Shehhi, but that's a family name in the UAE, dunno about the mountain dweller part."
dubai,3d2f8k,3gaway,2,Mon Jul 13 19:14:53 2015 UTC,"The khinjar (if you're referring to the dagger i believe you are) is a yemen thing more than a oman thing.   Not really. There are different types, but the Omani Khanjar originated from Oman and it is even their national symbol. Read about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khanjar  It is very much an Oman thing. Go there and you'll see many wearing it.   Shehhi   The Shuhooh are Arabs that lived in the top of the Musandam region (a mountainous region) or commonly رؤوس الجبال. Most of the Shuhooh moved to the UAE (mostly RAK). I'm not sure if you've heard people speaking Shehhi, but it's very different. unfortunately there isn't a good video online that shows the Shehhi dialect, but here's a video that shows the Hebsi dialect (another mountain dweller tribe) which is similar to Shehhi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_Dt6vvkr4 Tell me if you understand it lol."

I just hope our culture isn't entirely lost. The traffic sucks tho :(  2- Is that a thing happening? non-muslims are free to eat whatever they want, ramadan or not. Nobody has the right to restrict others from eating.   3-Depends. I don't really think so, since i have many foreigner friends, but it really does depend. The biggest deal is language. If they don't speak arabic, they will get segregated solely because of the language barrier.  4- Definitely not. While outsiders might see that because of the differences between them and us, i definitely think dubai is very alive and active. And don't get me started on the misconceptions about dubai i see on a daily basis on reddit.  5- Showing intimacy in public, and not covering their bodies properly.  6- I hate questions that generalize Emiratis, as there are way to many views to consider. But for the most part, yes, we know how much the UAE has grown, and realize how lucky we are to be in this country."
dubai,3d2f8k,3gaway,3,Mon Jul 13 11:02:33 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that english is pretty much the first language here makes it harder to learn arabic. I myself have a knack for languages, but still dont speak arabic as I am not exposed and immersed in the language every day. If you are forced to speak a certain language to get by , you will learn it. Sadly, many become lazy simply because they can get by in English.   I think more govt programs should be availabe for foreigners who want to learn arabic, khaleeji style. The only one I know of is at Eton, and its crazy expensive."

dubai,3d2f8k,xandrosss,2,Mon Jul 13 12:39:59 2015 UTC,"Befriend some arabs :P Also, when learning arabic, one very important factor is knowing where each sound is supposed to come from. This goes as far as from the tip of your mouth to the back and deeper parts of your throat. Arabic is a VERY old and VERY complex language. i'd say it goes back to being one of the first languages, if texts are to be taken into consideration."

There isn't even the tiniest chance that you'll be able to get into these tents, let alone talk to anyone without knowing how to speak arabic.

I've been at the malls in Dubai and there are signs saying that you will be fined or legal action will be taken against you if you eat in the malls' corridors. There are designated eating areas for non-Muslims and kids though. I have photos of the signs. I respect the UAE's laws and I'm not a fan of being fined, but I've always wondered if Muslims think it's disrespectful for non-Muslims to eat in public during Ramadan.  3 - I guess that's a major factor. As a visitor I've always wanted to speak to a local and get a better understanding of life in the UAE, but I only speak English and a hint of Spanish.  4 - Agreed."

dubai,3d2f8k,sageandonion,2,Tue Jul 14 20:14:41 2015 UTC,"1- No.  2- I don't think anyone should be restricted.  3- Yes. There are two parts of this question. First there is segregation due to racism. Awareness will help, and it will naturally improve as education becomes better. Second, there is segregation due to difference in class. The UAE has a very strong upper and lower classes, and people are naturally more likely to interact naturally with people in their class. While this dynamic is probably not going away for a while, I think people are getting used to it and they're starting to adapt. In other words, I'm optimistic.  4- I agree that the tourist experience can be soulless since a lot of the attractions and advertisements don't really reflect the Emirati culture, and interaction with Emiratis is also rare. However, I don't agree for myself as an Emirati at all. If anything, I wish our culture wasn't this strong to the point where it's such a time-wasting thing. Yes, the UAE might not have much culture to be shown in old architecture and art, but the culture is inherent in the Emiratis' lifestyle itself.  5- Nothing.  6- You won't see people more proud of their country. We may have not seen the complete transition from desert to city, but our parents and grandparents lived the primitive life so we can understand the significance of the change, and most parents did a good job in teaching their children to appreciate the development of the country."
dubai,3d2f8k,investaquest,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:20:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Agreed 100%. You have to dig a little deep to get to the true Emirati culture as a tourist. The malls and high end luxury stores are thrown at you as soon as you land in DXB, as well as the skyscrapers which most of the time aren't architecturally Islamic. Glad to know. I've always wondered if Emiratis think that the UAE has become -too- Westernized."

dubai,3d2f8k,3gaway,4,Mon Jul 13 08:28:56 2015 UTC,"Yes it does vary by emirate. Well, to get started, we have free healthcare at designated government clinics, we pay less for electricity (i think) and have free water to a point. If we use too much water,i.e past that point, we pay for more water. we get varying financial support if we ask for it in certain areas, can't really specify anything off the top of my head other than money for building houses if you qualify. Gotta pay it back tho. Also free education, but it's not the best education. You can go to government schools and even college/university without paying money. For the best education though, we also have to pay the private schools. There are also many small things which the government will help us with if we ask, like help with debts and so on."
dubai,3d2f8k,3gaway,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:49:11 2015 UTC,"In addition to what OP said, I also talked about benefits in a previous similar thread:  https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/34q3xp/ask_an_emirati/cqx588i  And yeah benefits vary by each emirate."

Not in Dubai."
dubai,3d2f8k,sageandonion,4,Mon Jul 13 14:10:02 2015 UTC,Its the same in other Gulf countries like Saudi and Qatar. I have a friend who was born and brought up in Dubai. His job took him to saudi where he worked for 2 years. He speaks Arabic pretty well compared to when he was here. Another factor is how arabic is taught in private schools here. There is no writing exercises neither any grammar classes. All you have is some pictorial exercises which are memorised and reproduced to clear an exam. Sadly this curriculum and the textbooks are prescribed by the Ministry.this is how they teach Arabic in schools here. It isnt surprising that the poor standards of arabic we see here among expat students.

dubai,3d2f8k,sageandonion,7,Mon Jul 13 17:05:09 2015 UTC,What is your opinion on giving Wafideen (non locals) who did not come here by choice but are born or raised here and UAE is the only place that feels like home them and share a very similar language and culture with the locals some sort of permanent residency. A lot of us love the country to bits and would rather stay and keep contributing to it but since its hard to feel stable here with the competitive and dynamic job market and also hard to stay after retirement a lot of us resort to immigrating abroad. Cheers
dubai,3d2f8k,uaq24,10,Mon Jul 13 00:47:45 2015 UTC,"As an Emirati, I don't only think they should be given permanent residency but if they choose to, they should also be given a citizenship."
dubai,3d2f8k,lahsim,8,Mon Jul 13 00:56:31 2015 UTC,"Wow few Emeratis think this way. I've lived all of my life in UAE but I had to leave to continue my studies. Now I should apply for a visa every time to visit which is not fair. I speak the language and I am very familiar with UAE's culture, it even reached to a point where it influenced my own accent. Still I think permanent residence or something like it is more than enough. رمضان كريم خوي"
dubai,3d2f8k,sageandonion,2,Mon Jul 13 01:18:09 2015 UTC,"I also support people like you getting citizenship. I know many people born in Dubai that no longer identify with their original nationality. I noticed that this makes it very easy to get an identity crisis. When I went to uni in the US, many non-Emiratis there identify themselves as being from Dubai, and I felt proud of that. But it feels sad that those same people can't identify themselves as from Dubai when they're in Dubai itself."
dubai,3d2f8k,sageandonion,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:35:33 2015 UTC,Maybe in the far future we would see Emiratization of wafedeen. Sometimes you can't distinguish between lots of Arabs wafedeen and UAE locals.

I have always believed that if someone is born and raised in a certain country, they are the same as the indigenous people of that country. However, not many Emiratis think in the same way, especially since we are the minority, and our numbers are dwindling very quickly. It's a very tough question that i can't honestly answer without sounding like a hypocrite, but i feel like it shouldn't be easy, but not impossible either.

dubai,3d2f8k,BubbleBubbleWrap,3,Mon Jul 13 10:36:54 2015 UTC,This is why I think permanent residence is enough.

When I asked about those people I found out they were bedoons and some still exist without legal status in the UAE. Tbh if UAE don't want to deal with them then I don't see a possibility in the near future were UAE gives passports to wafideen or even permanent residence.
dubai,3d2f8k,Samsamurai,3,Mon Jul 13 16:37:46 2015 UTC,Good Question. a lot of people after living here for 40 years have to leave to a place where they have never lived before

Think of it in this way, if the foreigners country and the UAE were to go to war, the foreigner would most definitely be considered an enemy. It's not that easy to just consider him an Emirati, morals aside."
dubai,3d2f8k,Samsamurai,3,Mon Jul 13 11:13:53 2015 UTC,"But given that much of the UAE armed forces (and wider GCC militaries) is staffed by the Alkhabi tribe, is that really such an issue here? The Alkhabis originate from Persian Arabistan IIRC."

Don't forget that many Emirati's originate from persia."
dubai,3d2f8k,DaedalusMinion,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:28:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm an ex British Army guy myself, and while I wouldn't agree with national service in the UK, I think it is a good thing here. It will give young Emiratis a good work ethic, and it will provide a bastion against Iranian aggression.  I am not sure how to write it in English, but Al'Kaabi sounds about right- I am working off my spotty memory of Sandhurst lessons here, so if there are any Gulf historians here I would appreciate any corrections - They are a pretty major family in the UAE (as a result of their early settlement here as part of the Trucial Scouts), but on a wider scale tribally they formed much of the British Empire's Trucial Scouts and following that, they integrated into many GCC militaries. If you look at the senior officers of many regional states, you find a lot of Al'Kaabis. They are kinda like the Druze of the GCC in that regard.  And the fact that many Emiratis originate from Iran adds to that point- despite ancestral roots crossing the Gulf, in a GCC-Iran conflict I have no doubt that Persian Emiratis would remain loyal to the UAE. They have a better life here than they could ever hope to have in Iran."

Not all Dubai travel agencies offer this, but most of the bigger ones do.  Just apply it asap since it can take 2-3 working days for you to get the visa and we got the Eid holidays + weekends coming soon.  All you need is his 1 passport sized photo, his color passport copy and that is it. Any travel agency will apply the visa on his behalf. Some travel agencies require a security deposit such as ID or 5000 AED cheque if your friend tries to abscond. But since he's got UK visa (i'm assuming) show them that and tell him he's got UK residence he won't run away. So that shouldn't be an issue.  Let me know if you got anymore question.

dubai,3cxvw1,investaquest,3,Sat Jul 11 19:34:33 2015 UTC,"Don't stay at the Amaya hills in Kandy- total rip off ($140 compared to an average of $20 a night elsewhere) and really not great. The staff were useless, they hosted insanely loud private parties every night, and the room wasn't that comfortable. Stay at the Piumara Residence (Address: Rajapilla mawatha, Kandy) instead. Cheap as hell but unbelievably lovely. The owner and staff were really helpful and attentive, and the room was crazy nice! Much more convenient location than the Amaya hills too, and if you ask for a room overlooking Kandy you will have some perfect views. Worth going up to Amaya hills for a drink at the bar though, as the view is nice, but seriously, you are throwing money away if you stay there.  Travel by train- it is mega cheap and you get amazing views of the countryside. 1st class is lovely, but second class is grim. If you can get a space by the door in second class, you can sit out of the door, get some good photos and enjoy the breeze. It's a great way to meet locals too.  There is a bar in Kandy called the ""Slightly chilled lounge""- the views are awesome, especially at sunset) and the Chinese food is genuinely outstanding (the owner's wife is Chinese and cooks), and it is a good place to socialise with other travelers and a few locals.  The temple of the tooth is nice to walk around the free areas, but absolutely 100% not worth paying to go into the actual temple. It is 1000 rupee to see a single room that looks pretty much indistinguishable from the rest.   Galle fort (South coast) is really pretty, but there isn't a huge amount to do. Lots of tourist shops, but I did have the single greatest banana pancake I have ever had in a little cafe called ""Spoons"".  Colombo isn't that interesting, as it is just another big city. If you get a chance, head north to Jaffna and see the undiscovered side of Sri Lanka as it recovers from the war. There is some minor UXO risk if you travel too far from the beaten track, but in the populated areas you'll be fine. You can fly up there from Jaffna on a military plane for about 500dhs with https://www.helitours.lk/  Have a good trip! Watch out for pickpockets and scammers, but by and large Sri Lankans are mega friendly and hospitable!"

dubai,3cvb8v,MunchmaQoochi,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:26:48 2015 UTC,wow i remember there's only 30 classes for complete noobs and 20 for experienced drivers before.
dubai,3cvb8v,linux_n00by,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:46:32 2015 UTC,I have not done it myself but my friends have. The deal saves you a bit more then 500 and thats it really. Cost for a class is 60-80 and you have about 40 classes (20 Class should Cost about 1200 if its 60 per class. This way and you are paying 550 instead of 1200 and the amount you save is 650)   However Most of the cost are not about the class. I Took my license from EDI and The classes cost me 2600 but other Charges were 3535 Which made the cost 6k.   If you want to send you the cost classification just hit me a message and il reply with my invoice/charge sheet.
dubai,3cvb8v,Aussi245,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:47:22 2015 UTC,"I already have a driving license from another country which allows me to cut down the classes to 30 total.

But of course, I'm wary of the fine print and will confirm everything with them before buying it."

dubai,3cuqi4,ss6sam6,0,Sat Jul 11 07:32:12 2015 UTC,This is highly debatable. Across Arab countries I've been welcomed with open arms in some and in the worst case I've had men form rows in front of the door to block me from entering. This prompted a verbal altercation with another group of men who did not agree with the door blocking.
dubai,3cuqi4,yopla,2,Sat Jul 11 15:50:17 2015 UTC,How would the men even know if you were muslim or not? wear pants and not shorts (since you cant pray with knees showing) if you're a guy or long sleeved clothes and a headscarf if you're a woman. Nobody is going to stop you and ask if you're muslim. The most interaction you will probably get is a person smiling and saying assalamu alaykum. and you respond alaykum salam and thats it.
dubai,3cuqi4,6aff,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:16:33 2015 UTC,I suppose because I am white and I didn't speak Arabic so they made a guess.   Another time I was told I could enter but I had to stay by the door and not go too far inside.  Another time I was told I should not only go in but also to stay for prayer and that it was OK if I didn't know what to say; just do like everyone and think of God.  It just random
dubai,3cuqi4,yopla,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:24:40 2015 UTC,"Plenty of white dudes go to mosques. I think you maybe did something that made you look extremely out of place like you started taking pictures or walked in front of people who were praying. Generally speaking if a mosque has a ton of tourists the tourists are given a certain section to visit and arent allowed to enter the section where people go specifically to pray. Thats more for practicalities sake. That could explain why you were asked to not go to far inside, so you wouldnt disturb peoples prayers."

They must get a local advocate when dealing with criminal cases to do the work in court etc. Most are involved in shipping, mergers, finance etc. They all work for large international firms and it seems to me that the environment is very similar to western firms. One important note is that the weekend here is Friday and Saturday. Often when I am with them on a Friday they will still have their work phones with them and have to some emails or calls throughout the day. This gets problematic when getting drunk on a Friday ha.

Just staying at my company a little longer to gain all the experience I can."
dubai,3cu1fy,Arbalezt,7,Fri Jul 10 19:45:58 2015 UTC,"The most misconception about Dubai is this:   And it is mostly the oil sheiks whom build/create all the opulent landmarks/things that are found there?   No, Dubai isn't rich with oil anymore, less than 2% of Dubai income is from Oil, the majority of Dubai income is from tourism and trade.  What I hate about this misconception is when people use it to underestimate the great efforts and the wise vision of utilizing the oil money properly.  When oil was discovered the ruler of Dubai didn't take all the money for himself, he had a vision to make Dubai a regional hub for tourism and trade, he invested the majority of oil money for the future, because he knew the oil will runs out eventually, obviously he succeeded."
dubai,3cu1fy,Armstrong1889,9,Fri Jul 10 21:55:36 2015 UTC,"look, resident is not the same as citizen. There are millions of UAE residents that make around 1000USD or less per month, drive nissan tiidas, eat biryani for 5 usd a plate, smoke golden leaf for 1 usd a pack, etc etc.   Just because youre a resident doesnt mean youre well off . NYC is obviously home to wall street and super rich bankers, but you have lots of residents in NYC that live in almost officiall poverty.   Dubai is a normal city, where people live normal lifes. Sure, something are ""only in Dubai"", but the normal person just finds them amusing or rolls their eyes at them and goes on with their daily life."

I'm not sure why you assume we have stacks of money flying over. If it is indeed, I didn't get the memo.  There are much more super-cars in a whole lot of countries outside the UAE. Apartments too, of course. You should like you get all your information about the UAE from either rednecks, or /r/worldnews, or Vice. And honestly, that is as disconnected as it can be. There is literally no way of finding the mean financial state of the average resident of Dubai - other than summing up everyone's income and dividing it by the number of people that live here. What is the financial state of a resident in America, and the UK?  Also, Dubai is a city, not a country - so we cannot compare it to America or the UK or any other place. Unless of course you want to compare UAE on a whole. America is a much bigger country, a much older one, and it wouldn't make sense at all to compare it with the UAE. We have like two prime cities whose skylines people see as too fancy and shit all over it for overspending. Let's not get ahead of ourselves here. The number of major cities and the amount of money spent on construction there is too high, and unreasonable to compare. Oil production is controlled by the government, so 'Oil Sheiks' would be ridiculous terminology.  You have people of all kinds of financial backgrounds here, just like everywhere else in the world. So yea, I'd say it's pretty much the same as everywhere else. Also, the 'opulent landmarks/things' are built by those who can afford to (real estate tycoons), doesn't necessarily have to be an 'oil sheik'."

However, the image of extreme luxury is still there, perhaps I am biased due to what I've seen in the media, which is why I made this thread in the first place.  I don't think it is wrong to compare a city to a country, however I do agree that it gives inconclusive data due to the fact that a country has a wider range of possibilities.  The main point of the question was: Are people in Dubai living at a higher standard of life than people in the western world? Thinking more or less about the middle class.  To which it seems the answer is: Not really."
dubai,3cu1fy,oceangoing,3,Sat Jul 11 02:53:11 2015 UTC,"i think instead of comparing to the western world standards, you should be comparing to the standards of people's home countries. i know lots of people who live much better a life than they had back at home. but they might still be behind if you compare to switzerland for example.   on the other hand, if you really would like to compare to usa or uk, then the thing you should keep in mind is that uae is a tax-free country. no taxes on your salary and on what you buy. maybe this could explain why people ride better rides here. because they are cheaper and banks provide endless possibilities if you would like to go with a loan. and this country is booming for the last 15 year or so, so most of the residential buildings are built within the last 10 years making them modern and nice and have a gym or pool, mostly both.   one other thing is, companies provide better conditions if they would like to keep professionals in the middle east. not all but decent companies provide education for the kids and accommodation (or good allowances for accommodation). with them being taken care of, you have more to spend on other luxuries, like having maids, a driver or a gardener. you can have a full time maid and a driver for a total of aed5k. in my opinion that alone brings you well above average."

dubai,3cu1fy,Glays,-4,Fri Jul 10 20:44:32 2015 UTC,"You just described it. Extremely rich people are either a) locals who have connections with sheikhs and higher-ups in companies b) foreigners who have connections OR ones who are just qualified to get a proper job.  I suppose ~35,000 AED is the middle class average. With this salary, you could get a pretty sweet car with loans. Loans are an easy thing in Dubai, which would explain the high number of fancy cars around."

dubai,3cpi77,Icamequicly,6,Thu Jul 9 19:02:33 2015 UTC,"To be honest, it all depends on your life style and number of dependents living with you. Being a single guy, I could get a very decent lifestyle with 10k+ and get a high-end luxurious lifestyle if I am earning 15k-20k+ AED. But for families, that number can go up dramatically. Wife, children, school fees and all those can mount up huge amounts.  11k is more then do-able in my honest opinion. You can find a decent studio in Barsha or other areas for around 4-6k a month and eletric bill and internet can add up to another 1k a month. Food and petrol cost shouldn't be more then 2-3k if you are cooking for yourself. It wouldn't be the most luxurious lifestyle, but it'll be somewhere in the mid-end life spectrum. You'd be doing decent."

Make sure to get a flat somewhere close to the metro station and make sure your office is close to one as well. I came to Dubai as a fresh graduate as well, you're either going to love it or hate it. It's been 5 years for me and I still love it :)"
dubai,3cpi77,Nounoon,3,Sun Jul 12 05:27:30 2015 UTC,"Living with 11kAED a month, in a rent free environment, you will be able to have a pretty good lifestyle.

I go out in restaurants and bars every weekends with friends, I am very reasonable during the week, and I manage to put aside about 3kAED per month. Above that I bought with my salaries a 2nd hand Porsche to live the Dubai dream!  With your own rent to pay, it would be better to forget about the car, to be able to enjoy your time here while still putting some money aside.  I would say rent with flat mates with shared internet about 5500AED a month, 500 for your phone bill + depreciation when you want to buy a new phone, 1000 for food, 500 for transportation, 1500 for fun and 2000 to keep for your bad days or retirement."

It is a very fun can, but if you were looking for an even remotely practical car, mine would have been a stupid choice. With 204hp, it's probably not quicker than your SantaFee. The most enjoying thing and I quite like it, is to drive with the top down (with AC on full blast in those hot times). It is also nice to have one here as it is a relatively uncommon car to own, and is quite affordable here.  The main drawback is having only 2 seats. I have an old 2+2 Ferrari in Europe, and until now I didn't realize how those +2 seats meant the car was actually usable in much more situations. When friends are visiting, we have to rent a car.

The SantaFe i have is the full option and has 7 seats, which is great for me. Means that I dont have to hire a driver but can save cash.   I've driven a few Ferraris and Lambos while in Dubai (again due to work) and while the cars are nice and awesome to look at, they're just very impractical as normal day-to-day cars.

Use that time to get your D/L or if you already have a G2, just transfer it. My niece got her Omani licence based on G1 :$. Getting a D/L in Dubai is super expensive...maybe $2-$2.5K...G2 would probably set you back by $500-700 inc. some classes...? Anyways, the point was that jah, use the metro to commute to work and rent-a-car when you really, really need one...there's no ZipCar or Car2Go here so you'd have to rent for an entire day at least. The cost of keeping a decent, nothing fancy, reliable Japanese car will be around AED 1500 (700 for monthly installment, 500 for maintenance, rest for fuel, toll gates). Packing your lunch from home will save you a few hundred $ per month. It's a great way to budget. Depending on where you end up working, grabbing a bite at work can easily set you back by AED 40-50. Get a Russell Hobbs slow cooker for $50 and you'll be able to make 3-4 meals out of it while you're at work. Note: Hamilton Beach slow cookers aren't sold here. These have timers in 'em so you can truly set and forget. Should find 'em on Amazon. Check our /r/slowcooking. They love Hamilton Beach.

With that being said, I know that the temperatures in Dubai will be temperatures like we've never experienced before, so we will be sure to take our precautions. As mentioned by WeAreGlidingNow, we will arrive in Dubai during Eid al-fitr. Do you guys know if anything special is going to happen in Dubai doing this time? Like firework shows or something like that? Or other events maybe? Thanks! /Mads. P.S the weather is like this here in Denmark (Scandinavia) at the moment.

Don't walk. Don't go down to the old parts of town along the Creek (Dubai Museum, Gold Souk, the markets etc) until after 7-8 when the sun's set. It's definitely doable. Forget about the beaches, by the way. Hot and dry during the day and humid at night. You can still do what I described for scenario 1 except you'll sweat buckets.  Hot and humid around the clock. The worst of the three options. You won't want to spend any time outdoors, even at a chilled pool.    Regardless of the weather two weeks is a long, long, long time to spend in Dubai in the summer."

The reason they had to make it fake and all, while only saying the name is that the Govt didnt want a movie called ""Sex and the city"" shot in Abu Dhabi. I personally believe that it had nothing to do with the title, they just didnt want a shitty movie taking place in their city.   Thats why they altered the city in the movie and the emirates palace, etc. The point is that anyone who has ever been to Abu Dhabi would instantly realise that the movie does NOT take place in nor represent Abu Dhabi.   There is one scene in it where the chicks are running away, and dressed in Abayas, and they cant get a taxi. So one of them lifts up the abaya to show her naked leg and suddenly boom, taxis stop.   It's a really really really stupid and culturally insensitive movie. I suggest everyone watch it just for a cheap laugh and the cringe factor.

Permanent non-dom tax status will be abolished from April 2017, Chancellor George Osborne has announced. The reform does not eliminate the tax status, but individuals who have lived in the UK for 15 of the past 20 years will lose the right to claim it. The non-domicile rule allows some wealthy UK residents to limit the tax paid on earnings outside the country. The chancellor said changes to the non-dom rules would bring in an additional £1.5bn in annual tax revenue. 'Not fair' The changes to the non-dom system would also mean that, from April 2017, somebody who is born in the UK to UK-domiciled parents would no longer be able to claim non-dom status if they moved away from the UK but then returned and took up residency in the UK. The government also announced that from April 2017, new rules would be introduced so that everyone who owns UK residential property and would otherwise pay inheritance tax on the property cannot avoid the tax by holding it in an offshore company. It said this would limit ""abuses"" of the rule by some who have non-dom status. ""It is not fair that non-doms with residential property here in the UK can put it in an offshore company and avoid inheritance tax. From now on they will pay the same tax as everyone else,"" said Mr Osborne. The chancellor said he had decided not to abolish the non-dom tax status completely because it ""would cost the country money"", adding many individuals that took advantage of the tax status ""make a considerable contribution to public life"". But he added: ""It is not fair that people live in this country for very long periods of their lives, benefit from our public services, and yet operate under different tax rules from everyone else."" Separately, the chancellor said HM Revenue & Customs would also receive an extra £750m to pursue tax evasion. Mr Osborne said the additional funding would help HMRC officials raise £7.2bn in extra tax by 2020."

Depending on if it is aggressive or protective or playful. If the dog was not socialized while a puppy or was not around its litter for long enough then it did not get the playful reinforcement of other puppies playing and learning how far is too far- usually expressed through noise, bark, whimper, snort of the nostrils. Try making noises as soon as the dog is in the act of biting or correcting the dogs actions if you can read their body language before they bite. PM me if you have any more questions or want me to put you in touch with some people (sorry don't know anyone trainers in the UAE).  If they are chewing items its kind of same same but different with correcting the action as it happens.   Ps: huge fan of positive reinforcement, I suggest you look into it as well as read up on some basic training for your pup. Excercise plays a huge role and walking together is a great way to assert yourself and practice dicipline with your pup.  If you ever want me to walk your dog let me know- I have worked with hundreds possibly thousands of dogs over a 10 year period and am great with K9 body language."

I do recruitment and Finance/Accounting is probably the least paid qualification in the start of a career. I get 5-10 People almost everyday trying to find a job in Finance or Accounting (Mostly Indians and Pakistanis)   However with good experience, Soft skills and client handling you can work your way on one of the best careers in long term prospective. Having qualifications such as ACA, CFA,CPA are in demand and as you do these, your salary and job prospective both improve. Eg A company may increase your salary for every paper you pass. With Good qualifications and Experience you can stand out in the market.   In short... ^ Its a long term thing and you have to be patient through it. Keep learning and you will make it.  PS: Want HIGH Salary, Guaranteed Job with Best Possible packages. Just do Actuary. Most of you might not know what is is. It  is mostly about calculations which required veryyy skilled mathematical knowledge (Stats in particular) knowledge of Economic and Finance helps.

I was flitting from internship to internship, studying for the CFA for two years before I got my first job, and its in an industry which is one of the toughest to get into. A month into this job and I got a call from the investment management of a large oil company, asking if I was interested in interviewing for a Senior Financial Analyst role. Just some perspective.

What I did every day was buy a coffee from Caribou, spend about an hour there studying(its much quieter than the other coffee shops in the place, apart from maybe Gloria Jeans, and has pretty decent ambience to study) , then walk down the hallway and find a seat at the lounge.

dubai,3c9zys,Traffic_Spiral,11,Mon Jul 6 11:38:20 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, but unfortunately this problem has been deeply embedded in modern Emirati culture by an environment of overly generous government subsidies, local content laws and cheap overseas labour.

Also, UAE's cultural identity is very closely meshed with the country's religious identity, which the locals aren't very interested in modifying."
dubai,3c9zys,east-india-company,0,Mon Jul 6 14:16:12 2015 UTC,"Not true. Firstly in european countries to this very day native populations of thise countries are reluctant to take up menial low pay jobs. In 2012 (IIRC) when there were riots in england, a bunch of rioters were interviewed on TV. All of them were unemployed. They were asked why dont they take up jobs as cleaners etc. Their response was its beneath them. The same attitude was displayed in post world war 2 in britain and germany also. The germans were unwilling to do menial work. To solve it immigrants from turkey came and picked up those jobs. Nowadays its eastern european workers who take up these jobs. Secondly the cultural point you make is again incorrect. The bahrainis, omanis and maybe even Saudis have similar cultural traditions to the emiratis. If you've visited those countries, you would find many omanis, bahrainis etc who work low paid jobs. It isnt cultural. it is simply there is not much need for it. You have plenty of govt jobs that dont require graduate level qualifications. A high school diploma and even in some cases school drop outs are eligible for certain jobs. Moreover there is govt aid. And even if this doesn't exist, the emirati community is very close knit and there are always people to help you out.So why go for a low paying job when you can get a desk job in a govt office which pays better? Also to open a business like a shop, grocery etc you need a sponsor and they get a monthly income for the same. So there's that source as well. So you find very few working in such jobs. Even if many emiratis turned up for these jobs, companies would still find it cheaper to hire asians (http://www.thenational.ae/uae/emiratisation/kitchen-owner-willing-to-hire-an-emirati-but-accommodation-is-a-problem). Lastly, the ""beneath me"" argument is not something you only find over here. Having lived in India, I know of so many instances where I have heard this same argument. I knew a bunch of college students (from middle income families) who joined our organisation for a field trip to a rural community. When they were asked to clean toilets, many of them outrightly refused. And these were people who volunteered for a rural upliftment programme. Maybe they had some fancy ideas in their head and thought it did not involve hard labour."
dubai,3c9zys,Zizoudxb,3,Mon Jul 6 18:15:31 2015 UTC,"Wait, that's huge historical revisionism. The Germans weren't afraid to do menial labour. They'd just fought a world war doing nothing but menial labour.   The Turkish immigration wave occurred in the 60s and 70s during the Wirtschaftswunder, when the German economy was growing so quickly they needed to import labour from everywhere. It has nothing to do with the German attitude towards being prejudiced against hard labour, they didn't just magically save their own economy for 20 years and then suddenly decide not to work."

I'm sorry but the reason why we emirate people that live in dubai don't undertake ""low-paid jobs"" is exactly that; we don't have to. we have oppurtunities to get proper education so that we get goverment jobs or other jobs that pay more than a ""petrol jocky"". It's not about the culture, it's the fact that there is no way working at a petrol station or a mcdonalds would support our living expenses. My grandfather used to work on making boats for fishing day and night. I don't have to do that because i was lucky enough to get proper education. I have this notion that all emirates are born into a tub full of money, i remember a time where we lived in a house with no curtains to block the sun, and only overcame that because my father worked hard to provide a better lifestyle to us. This is just a load of crap."

I've found the ASUS routers to work great but they're really finicky to setup and work.  Mine used to drop the WAN connection randomly because it was connected to WAN via the Ethernet port in my wall.   I connected it directly to the Etisalat Modem via the supplied Ethernet cable and it stopped dropping the connection. Took me days to figure that one out.

dubai,3c6ch7,karamazzz,2,Sun Jul 5 09:55:03 2015 UTC,"The US->UAE license conversion is trivial at best.  You actually do NOT need the eye-doctor crap either (Just tell the doc you are US citizen).. and they skip it (or at least have for everyone I know, including myself).  You'll get your license while you are at the ""DMV"" (Road and Transport Authority--RTA).  Bring like 200-300dh (Less than <$100 USD) for any fees (doc/license).   One thing to mind-- if you have a license with more than car (say, for example, CAR+Motorcycle), make VERY sure they convert everything over.  And they will (although I don't recommend driving a motorcycle in UAE unless you're a delivery guy)... but anything else, like heavy-vehicle..etc..  Make SURE they convert everything.. they printed several licenses for me before they got it right.  I say this so you maintain your license status, in the event your USA license expires and you go home, you still retain all your certificates.  Other than that, its trivial, easy..simple.. totally not a big deal.  And yes, ride everyones ass in the left-lane and flash your lights non-stop... And don't go more than 60kph over the limit... but definately speed until you see a speed-camera then slam on your breaks and try not to get rear-ended.  On the plus side, speeding upto 60kph over, is only a fine.  Doesn't increase insurance rates or anything..and Abu Dhabi is 50% cheaper fines than Dubai...  Also, you can always go 20kph (but not 21!!!) over the limit and not get a speed camera ticket...  20-30kph in Abu Dhabi is 300dh, 30-50 is 400dh (about $120usd)... Over 60kph is bad idea-- impoundment, black-points, and MUCH more money.  Dubai prices for tickets is 2x (so..600/800dh for same infraction)... Just keep that in mind."

I checked the RTA website, the number of lessons I need reduces but otherwise, no clear way to just get the license. I'll sign up one of these days when my budget agrees, for now, I fortunately don't have any crucial travel-based obligations because I live next to work/the metro station...so yeaaah.

dubai,3c37ao,nor_iqhwan,2,Sat Jul 4 17:52:56 2015 UTC,"Most likely. It mentioned she's Khaleeji, anyway. The thing that gets me is her age. At sixteen, she met and flirted with guys (whose ages aren't mentioned) when this behavior was forbidden by her family or society at large. Sixteen year old kids are going to do risky, dumb shit. Should she be punished by going to jail instead of college? It seems like a more appropriate punishment would be taking away her phone for a while, or disallowing her to go out with friends for a few months. Not losing a significant portion of her youth."
dubai,3c37ao,nor_iqhwan,2,Sat Jul 4 20:28:05 2015 UTC,"I believe that she's risking jail time because well, she's a repeated offender. Some teenagers these days are as perverted as fuck and will do anything to be a fool and fuck around."

I've never been a Muslim teenager in this country, but do minors know they risk jail time for being fools and fucking around? The jail time wouldn't surprise me if she were caught with drugs at that age, because the drug laws are cut and dry. The ""don't be perverted"" laws seem far more nebulous."
dubai,3c37ao,nor_iqhwan,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:47:22 2015 UTC,"The ""don't be perverted laws"" applies to the locals and to an extent Arabs though. This is because the government doesn't want locals teens to be seen sex crazed like teenagers of other nationalities. The police and court doesn't really care about teens of other nationalities, Muslim or not, literally fucking around unless they were reported.  So basically most minors are not aware or pretend to be unaware that they can go to jail for giving/receiving a blowjob the other day at some party if they were caught."
dubai,3c37ao,gutterandstars,2,Sun Jul 5 10:30:20 2015 UTC,"That's really sad for the teenagers who get caught. There are co-ed schools and the sexes aren't segregated here, so how would the teens be aware they could go to jail? I mean... jail. When you're still a kid. For doing the things teenagers everywhere do, as a natural part of growing up. I feel for these minors who are made into examples."

One of my friends simply changed schools when his parents found out, he was Muslim and quite conserative too.

dubai,3c3tqv,theregos,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:17:52 2015 UTC,The apartments are bigger even considering studios and the layouts are way better than the boxy studios in IMPZ – all for nearly the same range. The buildings actually look nice which is better scenery than the towers of IMPZ. You'll end up paying the same rent in Remraam but for greater value. The community is really nice with 2 swimming pools and parks and tennis courts all around.  The only disadvantage I can think of now is the commute but it's really just 25 mins from Mall of the Emirates if not less. Edit: Also regarding parking some towers in IMPZ did not offer parking with the apartment and you'd have to park your car on the dirt.

E-Savings is done through your online banking and can't be accessed through an ATM machine, card, or tellers.

There is likely some kind of FRACAS (Failure Reporting Analysis and Corrective Action System) system being used for law enforcement too. For instance, when you see the parking inspectors walking about with handheld devices, they're reporting failures to comply and there's most likely a report somewhere to analyze the data and print a list of abandoned vehicles... that can then be given to the guys with tow trucks to have the vehicles moved to an impound lot."

With your processor, why not go with a GTX 960 or an R9 280X/380X? Kingston SSD I must advice against that, better go with another brand. If overclocking is not needed, go with an H97 Motherboard, Z97 is only best for intel unlocked CPUs like 4690K and 4790K. Mech KBs here in the middle east are waaay to overpriced mind you. PSU has to be at least 80 Plus Gold certified. at least Corsair CS or RM series IMHO. I can sell you my GTX 970 for AED 1200 complete with box and receipt, otherwise it will cost you AED 1600."
dubai,3bt1xo,will_code,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:24:59 2015 UTC,"I'm going with a Z97 mostly because they have more features besides overclocking and it fit my budget.

I already calculated my wattage, and my PSU can handle my rig plus it's modular, and the difference between Bronze and Gold is only in the efficiency. Thanks!"

I had my graphics cards and CPU shipped here from the US and saved money even after shipping (Shop&Ship.)  In the way of motherboards/mainboards there was decent selection and I could find something comparable to what I wanted for a similar price.

Most hotel restaurants will include it in the menu prices with a note at the beginning of the menu or on each page. This an old law, I think at least 10 years. Some/most hotel restaurants also include 10% service fee (which is why people don't usually tip much on hotel restaurant bills).   I guess since coffeeshops have standard pricing inside and outside hotels, they add the 10% at time of payment.

dubai,3bnqd1,kushari,3,Tue Jun 30 19:09:25 2015 UTC,Still no where close to most of the world
dubai,3bnqd1,sageandonion,5,Tue Jun 30 19:46:03 2015 UTC,well that's how it appears superficially when the taxes are basically included indirectly
dubai,3bnqd1,yopla,-1,Tue Jun 30 22:27:36 2015 UTC,"bullshit. try living in Europe where 50% of your salary goes to income tax, then cars have an 180% tax, plus an annual green tax and a weight tax, everthing you buy, be it goods or services, has a 25% sales tax, etc etc etc..   People who claim theres too much ""tax"" in the UAE have shit for brains."
dubai,3bnqd1,EsbenB,-4,Wed Jul 1 16:39:43 2015 UTC,"Wrong. You pay Salik everyday probably. I never pay to get on the main highways in Toronto. You pay fees for many things. I don't. The whole ""tax free"" thing is so stupid and only the people that aren't aware of where their money actually think it's actually cheaper than paying taxes. It's the same thing if not worse."
dubai,3bnqd1,sageandonion,6,Wed Jul 1 02:01:33 2015 UTC,It really isn't. I pay 500dhs a month on Salik (I have a long commute). I also pay maybe 1000dhs a year in miscelaneous feed to the government. Tax in the UK would take 30+% of my income. 7000dhs annually is significantly less than 30% of my income.
dubai,3bnqd1,kushari,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:09:35 2015 UTC,Don't forget 5% of your housing paid on dewa bills. 5% import duty on pretty much everything you buy that is not local. 30% on alcohol. x%(?) on cigarette  It's still way less that in Europe of course. Just in France there's a 20% VAT that would cost me more per year than all the tax in Dubai combined.
dubai,3bnqd1,sageandonion,2,Wed Jul 1 06:49:25 2015 UTC,"most countries have import taxes, that has nothing to do with my personal tax level.  But if import taxes should be counted as well, i can raise my 50% personal income tax with 25% VAT on most items   and 180% energy tax on cars.  Dubai will never come close to the Danish tax levels (and most other countries for that matter)"
dubai,3bnqd1,pinkyponk,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:45:41 2015 UTC,"Of course there are costs, but comparing it to outright taxes would just be dramatic."
dubai,3bnqd1,kushari,-4,Wed Jul 1 06:51:27 2015 UTC,And every time you go out to a restaurant you're spending minimum 100$. Add those up and you'll get a lot of your income. I've already done the math.
dubai,3bnqd1,DXBtoDOH,12,Wed Jul 1 02:12:01 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, how could I forget about the free restaurants in the UK..."
dubai,3bnqd1,dharmabird67,3,Wed Jul 1 02:30:21 2015 UTC,"Oh, I do miss them."
dubai,3bnqd1,kushari,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:01:40 2015 UTC,"Not free, but way cheaper and I'm comparing to Canada."
dubai,3bnqd1,DXBtoDOH,2,Wed Jul 1 07:15:26 2015 UTC,A minimum of 100$ USD? Don't be ridiculous.  And even 100 AED is a ridiculous assumption.  A few nights ago I had a brilliant Indian meal in one of the better Karama joints. My share came to 75 AED. Pretty cheap.   I find most restaurants here cheaper than in the UK.
dubai,3bnqd1,EsbenB,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:19:12 2015 UTC,"I ate with a friend at this Nepali place in Bur Dubai and it was around 50Dhs - that's only 1 zero- not much more than McDs, and the food was as good as stuff I have eaten in Nepal - great momos."
dubai,3bnqd1,kushari,-1,Thu Jul 9 08:21:22 2015 UTC,Every time I went out with friend's I paid over 100$. It is ridiculous. Going out here in Canada at the same level won't cost you anywhere near the same.
dubai,3bnqd1,EsbenB,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:14:44 2015 UTC,"That seems to be your problem and one not commonly shared by others unless you only eat at, say, the Atlantis.  I eat out a lot. It's a great pleasure. And I eat out at all ranges in Dubai and in the UK and US and elsewhere.  On the whole food ranges from comparable to slightly cheaper (higher end to upper mid range places) to ridiculously cheaper (hole in wall joints).   $100 is 367 AED. That is a nice meal out in Dubai. Even at Gaucho and La Petit Maison. For the bill to get substantially higher you'd have to be buying booze too. I can eat pretty well in London for less than that."
dubai,3bnqd1,kushari,3,Wed Jul 1 08:45:37 2015 UTC,"Thats BS Maybe tax in Canada is extremely low. But would i still be in Denmark i would be paying around 50% in tax - tell me again how Dubai is more expensive tax/fees-wise than 50% of my income ?  And yes, I also pay for food when i go out in Denmark... the welfare system is good, but food is not free ;)"
dubai,3bnqd1,MikeBruski,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:22:25 2015 UTC,The equivalent restaurants are way more expensive in Dubai than in Canada.
dubai,3bnqd1,kushari,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:16:26 2015 UTC,"Ok, for me the prices here on food or more or less the same as back in Denmark.  Chains like nando´s, chilies and so on compared to similar in Denmark is more or less the same and so goes for high end places. Fast food like McD and so on is cheaper here, but we also have a ""fat tax"" in Denmark where fatty food is hit harder by fees..."
dubai,3bnqd1,EsbenB,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:25:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking cheap restaurants. Think of restaurants you'd actually take a date to, or eat out with a bunch of friends. Every time I've been out I've paid close to, or above 100$ in Dubai."
dubai,3bnqd1,dharmabird67,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:25:42 2015 UTC,plenty of those for less than 100aed per person. You dont know Dubai very well it seems
dubai,3bnqd1,kushari,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:41:13 2015 UTC,"Or it seems I know Dubai very well, and the people I hang out with go to fancy places."
dubai,3bnqd1,mayed_a1_falahi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:32:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe we go to different places then :)  Just an example, I had a great meal not that long time ago at Pai Thai, came in just under 200 aed per person which is around 55 $.  It might be the ideal date place and food wise its been in the top 3 of thai places in Dubai for years now.  There are a lot of places out there"
dubai,3bnqd1,fluffy_beard,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:41:13 2015 UTC,This is a big reason why I plan on staying in Al Ain for the time being even though I would much rather be in Dubai. We don't have all these crazy fees right and left like my Dubai friends tell me about.

dubai,3boekt,ballisticbanana999,7,Tue Jun 30 21:04:14 2015 UTC,"To me, this seems like the most enormous expense and inconvenience   To me, water dispensers are the inconvenience.  Water bottles are just more versatile and practical.  I grab one with me when I'm leaving the apartment to drink in the car. I throw one in my gym bag to drink at the gym. I keep one beside me when I'm sat at my desk. I easily drink 5-6L of water a day.   A water dispenser just wouldn't work for me.  Also, a lot of  apartments can be pretty small and a water dispenser can take up valuable space in, already small, kitchens. Especially if you're talking about some giant plastic drum sitting on your countertop..  I pay 40AED for 24, 1.5L bottles of Al Ain delivered to my door. How much are you saving with your water dispenser?"
dubai,3boekt,DownRUpLYB,2,Tue Jun 30 21:29:21 2015 UTC,"This is some good food for thought. Well, I pay 10 AED for what it says on the side of the drum 18.9 liters of water. Meaning I pay a little under 50 fils a litre. Meanwhile, you are paying close to 1 AED per liter.   But is that really significant? Well, according to this article, the average man should probably drink 2 liters of water per day. We in the UAE should probably be drinking more, but for the sake of argument, let's assume that if 2 x 365: 730 litres of water per year. Now of course, if you're like me, you drink water in the office, which is free, so probably only half of the water consumption is at home. But to stick with our calculations, currently, I'm spending roughly 350 AED on drinking water per year, whereas you're spending 700 AED.   Although, for what you might consider the convenience, it's not a big saving in the long haul.   *Edited to add that I forgot the cost of the dispenser, which is roughly 300 AED (power bills don't count, because I don't plug mine in).   ** Edited again to add that for you, with your above average water consumption, you actually might make significant savings switching to a dispenser and one of those non-disposable bottles for when you hit the gym. :)"
dubai,3boekt,6aff,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:01:06 2015 UTC,"so basically the hassle of dealing with a dispenser (that isnt even plugged in so no cold water) saves you 350dhs a year? Not worth it dude. I honestly prefer my water bottles, i can just grab it and take it with me to work, outside, whatever. Even inside the house i prefer a closed water bottle to an open cup which i might spill. Especially if im near my computer."
dubai,3boekt,mldl,7,Fri Jul 3 10:15:23 2015 UTC,I don't drink water. Fish fuck in it.

dubai,3boekt,Shivadxb,2,Thu Jul 2 17:39:58 2015 UTC,Do you deep clean your water dispenser?  Do you run sterilising fluids through the mechanism on a regular basis?

dubai,3boekt,jenthesilly,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:30:52 2015 UTC,I use a non-electric countertop dispenser and wash it every time I change the bottle. It understand that bottles are more convenient but it just seems so wasteful.

Do your research on a couple models and when you feel you have enough knowledge to inspect go hunting with cash and come home with a car.

Although it's an upscale hotel, the shisha is reasonably priced given the atmosphere. It's also some of my favorite shisha in the city. Also, I would highly recommend Siddharta Lounge located at Grosvenor House. It's a super elegant place, and the shisha is also well worth the price.  For a restaurant, I'd say that Reem al Bawadi is pretty good (they have a couple locations, you can google to see which will be closest one to you). Their food is great, and they also have a decent selection of shisha too (although, depending on your taste, the atmosphere is not as fancy as you may prefer). It's a pretty cozy atmosphere and it's definitely worth a try.  Edit: typo"

Get a family room, sit on the floor and eat with your hands.  It's not fancy but Al Yemen in Hor Al Anz has great mandi and whatnot. Maraheb Mandi is also decent but they tend to be out of the majority of stuff on the menu whenever we go there.  Can't suggest anything for shisha because thats not my bag. There are a few local places around Al Yemen but they're not fancy at all."

For 20k you can look at a Yaris/Tiida, or if you're pushing 30k you can look at Altima/Mazda6. Check out some cars on Dubizzle.com. I recommend you stick with something 2011 and newer, and focus on lower mileage. Anything below 50,000km is excellent, 50-80 is reasonable. Anything over 100km maybe look elsewhere"

dubai,3bjl9i,mangochutney63,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:36:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's a bit underpowered but it's not a big issue for my taste. As for a car in its condition, would it be absolutely necessary to do a checkup on it to ensure it's in the warranty?"
dubai,3bjl9i,DownRUpLYB,2,Mon Jun 29 19:55:41 2015 UTC,"Let me add that the criticism of this model that you see in here becomes your problem when you buy the car, as that is likely to hurt the resale value. Consider it when figuring out what you're willing to pay."
dubai,3bjl9i,will_code,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:00:10 2015 UTC,"I have noticed that it's a very fuel efficient car but I don't know how it compares with the bigger engine variations of it. I assume this would actually help with its resale value later, no? But my actual question here: would a car in this condition be good to go after a VIN check with AGMC or is it necessary that they physically check it to avoid possible issues after buying it?"
dubai,3bjl9i,desertsardine,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:15:25 2015 UTC,Fuel efficiency goes out of the window if you have to constantly accelerate hard just to get the car to move!
dubai,3bjl9i,DownRUpLYB,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:01:39 2015 UTC,"You have to choose between more miles or more smiles. Bigger engines can't match the fuel efficiency of smaller engines if you are stuck in traffic. Small engines feel anemic. Resale might be lower because the factory-fresh models with smaller engines are more affordable. For a 2015 model, you are not likely to find many problems... get an OBD check for them to read the diagnostic codes, if any."
dubai,3bjl9i,EsbenB,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:33:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your advice. I eventually am going with it, after a test drive I'm impressed with it as it's my first BMW and it's condition is flawless. I think buying factory-fresh models gives you the advantage of an as-new condition without sacrificing the initial loss of the value when buying a new car so it depreciates it slowly. As for the engine I found it to keep up nicely with the roads in Dubai and honestly all the speed limits around here make it pointless to buy a bigger engine 3-series unless you're really enthusiastic about it."
dubai,3bjl9i,derpster101,0,Sat Jul 4 17:42:31 2015 UTC,"I¨m not the car guy - but I do know that you asked about the car in here and your first two responses were ""are you sure you want that?""  That's not a good sign, so I'd say go look for something else."
dubai,3bjl9i,bx8,2,Mon Jun 29 22:00:21 2015 UTC,"Other than checking with AGMC about the service / repair history, you don't need to do much more other than test drive, after all, the car has a minimum 3 year mechanical warranty (which can be extended). So any faults you discover should be fixed at no cost. I would ask why the seller is getting rid of it after less than a year, that strikes me as odd more than anything else so worth investigating.   As for the car itself (and as a 335i owner), I would personally go for a '13-'14, bigger engine model which is still under warranty. It's win win."

My grandfather always contacts the Awqaf when he has an issue with the mosques or imams in our neighborhood, and he does it a lot since he's very involved with the community.  OP I will recommend going to the mosque and try talking to the imam. They usually listen to suggestions and complaints. As soon as he finishes one of his prayers, he will leave the mosque to go to his room. That's usually the best time to try to talk to him. If you aren't going to bother waiting for him, just knock on his door any time during the day (they usually don't mind) or just leave a note. Imams live in the mosque. If it doesn't work, contact the Awqaf/IACAD."
dubai,3bfuy4,3gaway,6,Sun Jun 28 23:10:54 2015 UTC,"IACAD used to be called Awqaf back then, it was divided to two authorities, IACAD & AMAF.   People still use the name Awqaf for the authority that supervise the mosques (IACAD)."

My neighbor went to speak to the imam and the imam wasn't convinced. He said he sticks to the allowed levels and asked for a recording of the sound from my neighbor's apartment to judge for himself.   The call to prayer is not the problem. Broadcasting the entire prayer loudly is. I don't understand how people can follow from home.  It's loud enough to know that something is being said but not clear enough to hear the words.  I've lived in the Arab world my entire life. Never heard mosques broadcasting prayers except here. I heard they don't do it in Abu Dhabi. I wonder if that's true.   Good luck and let us know how it goes.

There are lots of reasons one wants to participate in prayer but is unable to. This is why the prayer is broadcast.

dubai,3bhm7x,thedustsettled,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:33:58 2015 UTC,"yes, photo is a must here. Your cv is nice. Thank you for the points. ill follow them"
dubai,3bhm7x,pinkyponk,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:13:24 2015 UTC,Depends on the company.  I never once had to put a photo on a CV and didn't hurt my chances at finding work out here.  If you're applying to major western multinationals they won't ask for photos. Crap local companies will.
dubai,3bhm7x,pinkyponk,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:33:30 2015 UTC,Understood.

Please note that the feedback here is meant to be constructive, not malicious, so please focus on the advice and not the ‘tone’     This is not a visual person’s resume. Its boring esp when the first thing you want people to know about you is that you are a master in graphics design.   Similiarly, why not use the google adwords certified logo instead of text to illustrate the achievement?    No one cares about the languages you can speak unless that is a mainstay of the job – either loose this section or move it to the bottom.   Focus on what you did, not necessarily the tools you did it with. You want to be known as the marketing guy, not the google ad words, SEO white hat tricks guy. So under Freezone software company – digital marketing, I would change the language to says ‘launched successful marketing campaigns which increased our product awareness, increased revenue by x% ‘, similarly you could say something like ‘improved our visibility on google search which led to increased traffic on our website and resulted in an increase in sales’ - now you’ve gone from a google ad words / SEO guy to someone I can hire to increase my presence and make me more money. In the end, I don’t care what tool you use as long it results in me getting $$$$.   Your points need to be more fleshed out     a.  Investigated on what the client wants to achieve – what does that mean? I know what that means, you met with clients to translate their needs into a tangible work product by conducting meetings, gathering requirements, developing prototypes, soliciting feedback and ultimately producing and being paid for an output. Say that. Don’t be shy.     b.  That makes the remaining PM points moot.      Software sales executive   a.  You were there for five months thus you generated ~ 130k worth of business – say that!!!! Sounds a lot more compelling than 20,000 aed each month.      American debt collection agency – this is longest job and you have three bullet points to say about it. Think about the narrative. You spent seven years dealing with people who don’t want to or are unable to pay their bills. They think you’re scum and it’s your job to be persuasive and extract money out of tight pockets. Those are invaluable skills – the ability to be persistent, the ability to not demure in the face of pressure, to look beyond the verbal assault and still bring home to check. This represents tenacity and a mindset – it’s what’s helped you become who you are today.   Technical skills – identify the software but loose the ranking. Its subjective and it basically paints you as google jockey   Education     a.  Your CV does not represent what I would expect from a ‘right brained’ individual who graduated with a master’s degree in graphic design. Also, as others have said, loose 11th best university in the country    b.  With 10 years of work experience, no one cares about the relevant coursework – its irrelevant now given how fast the market moves.    Best of luck to you."

dubai,3bhsmm,Glokta_,3,Mon Jun 29 09:41:47 2015 UTC,"Yes you can   You can get a good 1 bedroom apartment for 45,000 -50,000 a year in Al Nadha Sharjah. This place is located  at the Dubai-Sharjah border so easy access to Dubai. Utilities are cheaper in Sharjah as compared to Dubai.   Metro is not at walking distance, but a 10 min bus ride will get you to the nearest metro station, Stadium/Al Nadha.  However if your work place is in Jebel Ali then it will be a hassle to travel from one end of Dubai (Sharjah) to the other end at peak hours."
dubai,3bhsmm,YamaDev,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:45:13 2015 UTC,"Is it accessible via metro lines? I won't be having a car. As long as I can move around using public transport, good for me. I'll be working in relative proximity to the airport / City Center Deira."
dubai,3bhsmm,YamaDev,3,Mon Jun 29 12:05:30 2015 UTC,Not directly but through a feeder bus. If you are willing to spend a few thousand more than you can also stay in Al Nadha (in Dubai) which has direct access to metro green line.

dubai,3bhsmm,ESBUK,3,Mon Jun 29 12:46:51 2015 UTC,I live in al barsha. It's next to metro and malls. Rents would be 70 ~ 80 k per year so say 6 - 8k a month. Dewa is around 500 per month because of the tax. You wont find much cheaper unless you go for a studio. Tecom jlt Dubai marina will be similar or more. Maybe out near the airport or gharhoud.  Not sure.
dubai,3bhsmm,ESBUK,3,Mon Jun 29 13:18:09 2015 UTC,"Personally if you are living here then I would recommend you get a car, 12500 is enough, you can look at places like sky courts, sports city, motor city for a 1 bedroom or 2, hence you will need a car because these places are a good 20 mins drive from mainland Dubai.   Look for a apartment with chiller free so that will cut your dewa costs especially during summer.   It's a given that your first 3 months will be tight, there is a lot of deposits to be given as well as agency fee for apartment etc."
dubai,3bhsmm,MunchmaQoochi,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:35:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I have a car in my home country, but I believe it would be too much of a hassle to transport it. I will look into these areas you mentioned. Any website for searching you might recommend?   Thanks!"

dubai,3bfbcd,daddydidncare,3,Sun Jun 28 18:39:17 2015 UTC,That companies never pay on time and you need to know the insiders who can help you win the project. Its also really hard to bring in new technologies inside  an already running organization and again if you know insiders it'll be a breeze.  I have a successful Internet company here.  Ask me more questions if you have
dubai,3bfbcd,insainty,3,Sun Jun 28 22:01:02 2015 UTC,that's not just online. Nobody here likes to pay on time. Everybody wants work done by yesterday but payment inshallah
dubai,3bfbcd,Shivadxb,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:22:06 2015 UTC,"what's dealing with payment processors and delivery companies like? who do you have accounts with, and do i really need an e-commerce trade license with a hefty sum to just do a little bit of business?"
dubai,3bfbcd,insainty,2,Tue Jun 30 13:41:58 2015 UTC,"I tried dealing with all the processors here. There are some good options but with some stupid restrictions.   Payfort - Long process but Good pricing. They don't accept service business. If you are doing physical products, This is a very good option. PayTabs - Very cheap and easy setup but they don't accept AMEX and do not accept credit cards that do not have master or visa secure code. Its stupid but works well if you have only GCC customers. 2Checkout - super easy to setup but very high fee. They charge about 6.5% and hold 5% for 6 months. Can be the last resort.   I am not very sure about the e-commerce license. You can get a license from DTEC and start selling product."
dubai,3bfbcd,will_code,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:22:39 2015 UTC,you need to know the insiders who can help you win the project   I've seen sales personnel with experience in an overseas branch of HP or VMWare and fail miserably when it came to selling here simply because they didn't know anybody and they didn't go about networking quickly enough with tech folk.

dubai,3bfbcd,will_code,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:25:03 2015 UTC,"If you want to have any software development done locally and aren't too tech-savvy, you will have a hard time recruiting somebody. The average tech salaries are quite low compared to the living expenses here so we don't attract the best of talent in this part of the world. When outsourcing to India, be wary about outsourcing to firms that aren't well-known. If you are outsourcing, insist on being able to interview whoever is being assigned to your project."
dubai,3bdvfj,indebtandworried,11,Sun Jun 28 07:57:40 2015 UTC,"Good luck OP. I've been lurking in /r/dubai for 2 years and have loved every second of it. First time I asked help to send flowers to my mom since I live in the US now, and /u/localmode helped pro bono. I owe ya a beer bud. :) My Pakistani friend lost his job 3~4 years ago and has been looking for work ever since. I tried helping him, but he's an EE and I got no wasta in that field.
