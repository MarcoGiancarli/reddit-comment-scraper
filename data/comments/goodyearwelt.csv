goodyearwelt,3e2sq8,calceamentum,2,Tue Jul 21 14:56:31 2015 UTC,"Hey, looks awesome. How did you size it?"
goodyearwelt,3e2sq8,SaloonLeaguer,5,Tue Jul 21 15:17:10 2015 UTC,"Ach, I knew I was forgetting something!  Sizing  The olfe last runs TTS. I sized down one from brannock. I typically wear an 8.5D but have high arches, so have problems in the waist of the shoe, making things like the AE 5 last impossible for me. The Olfe last fits great in a 7.5D. Someone with normal arches won't have any problems in the width, if you look at my pictures you'll notice there's some slight splitting but within acceptable limits, even on my high arches. My left foot is also more like an 8.25D, so I get some ever-so-slight heel-slip on the left shoe, but it's not really a problem.  So, in short, OLFE last = TTS Brannock, wider than the AE5 but filling the same aesthetic role while looking much less ""bulbous"" (my problem with the 5 besides the sizing)."
goodyearwelt,3e2sq8,rogrogrickroll,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:35:19 2015 UTC,Nice review. Their antique chestnut calf has been on my radar recently. Is it really that dark in regular light? How much lighter does it get under sunlight? Would you mind taking some pics under different conditions?
goodyearwelt,3e2sq8,rogrogrickroll,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:44:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah sure! I won't be able to take any natural light photos until tomorrow morning, if that's okay with you.  I'd say the last two (first two) pictures are good indicators of their overall color when indoors. Outdoors / more light they'll appear a shade lighter!"
goodyearwelt,3e2sq8,iezacu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:04 2015 UTC,That's fine just keep me updated. Do you know if all their chestnut calf look the same way or do other customers have shoes that are darker/lighter than yours?

goodyearwelt,3e2naq,makemewaffles,3,Tue Jul 21 14:26:40 2015 UTC,Imo alden is just very overpriced compared to what you can get in britain and europe. I guess these might be worth it if you really value alden's designs.

goodyearwelt,3e31s3,ArtofExpression,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:26:29 2015 UTC,There's Meermin Classic Line and Meermin Linea Maestro. Classic line is stitched and lasted in China and then shipped to Spain to be finished. Linea Maestro is handwelted in Spain and general has better materials and finishing. Linea Maestro and Carmina are very similar in terms of quality. I personally wouldn't buy anything from the Meermin Classic line but that's only because I value quality over price. I think the Meermin Classic Line is still a good value proposition compared to the likes of Allen Edmonds.

goodyearwelt,3e31s3,havingaraveup,4,Tue Jul 21 17:02:56 2015 UTC,"For 100% cotton, Procion MX fiber reactive dyes are great. Dharma Trading sells the dyes and supplies, and has well written tutorials. It won't bleed or chock at all if properly prepared and rinsed (the dye chemically bonds to the fibers). The downside is that it won't dye nylon or synthetics, so sometimes threads, if not 100% cotton, stay white. This can be a nice look, or annoying, depending on your project.  In general, home dyeing is a cool project that I recommend, but remember that all dye projects are experimental - you need to be willing to fail, or at least to end up with something a little different than you intended, but that you still like."
goodyearwelt,3e31s3,havingaraveup,3,Tue Jul 21 17:06:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the recommendation. The oxford is a uniqlo oxford, so I assume the thread is probably some sort of synthetic. Do you have any advice for that?   My grandfather used to own a dyeing plant, so it's something I'm very interested in but have never really been able to do in an NYC apartment without making a mess."
goodyearwelt,3e31s3,rev_rend,2,Tue Jul 21 17:13:58 2015 UTC,"I just looked this up and unfortunately it's too impractical for my space.

goodyearwelt,3e31s3,havingaraveup,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:24:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, and like /u/phidauex said, Procion fiber reactive dyes work very well. Follow the directions and you'll get a good result (though expect your thread not to dye...).  IRT your worry about a mess, last time I did this was in a 5 gallon bucket from Lowe's. No mess at all."
goodyearwelt,3e31s3,rev_rend,3,Tue Jul 21 17:58:46 2015 UTC,Do you think there's a dye that will not bleed but will also stain threads?
goodyearwelt,3e31s3,havingaraveup,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:04:42 2015 UTC,"There might be, but I'm not aware of one. AFAIK, almost all dyes will color each fiber differently. So the thread will always dye differently unless it is made from the same fiber as the garment."
goodyearwelt,3e31s3,rev_rend,2,Tue Jul 21 18:15:01 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with some variation, but if I'm dyeing a white oxford olive, I don't want white threads all over the place haha. I'll look into it and see what I can find."

I would love to have seen teak as an option but pulled the trigger on the cotto ones, as it seems really wearable. However, when I Googled cotto shell later, all the images I found were way, way, redder. Like, really red. I’d love to have the shoes as pictured on Superdenim, but I don’t think I’d be happy with actual red footwear.  And while it would be cool to have navy or green boots, it’s not something I’m going after with this purchase.  Further complicating my choice, I’ve got some Enzo Bonafe jumpers coming in dark cognac, which seems really close in color to Trickers’ mogano, which I’d be happy with otherwise.  I’ve also got some #8 colored boots, which are similar to burgundy on Superdenim.  I’d rather not have similar boots in similar colors.  Aarrggh!  The advice I need from people who have experience is 1) which is the real cotto? The brown with a bit of red from the product page or the red with a bit of brown that I see everywhere else. 2) The orange might be an option for me—it looks kind of tan or whiskey colored—but I’m naturally worried about the color accuracy now.

So, after thinking about /u/stevenkmason's idea yesterday for a month-long WSAYWT/WAYWT challenge, I decided I wanted to be more conscientious about my wardrobe and style in general. I started thinking about what I like to wear, what I feel comfortable wearing, and the aesthetic I like, and purging anything I own that didn't match up with those things. In this thought process I decided to document, by day, what I wore and details about the items in an excel doc and then analyze the data with a pivot table. Then I reevaluated my life. After that I decided that it would still be interesting if I stuck with it, so now I have an excel doc that has the sole purpose of analyzing patterns of how I dress. If we do the WAYWT challenge maybe I'll post it at the end of that for shits and gigs.   Anyway, my Kent Wang sunglasses came in from the Massdrop order and so far I'm really happy with them. Construction is pretty great and the feel nice on my face. Only complaint is that I was hoping the lenses would be a bit smaller in proportion to my face. Other than that I would recommend them   AOTD: This, no that...fuck it"
goodyearwelt,3e31s3,havingaraveup,2,Tue Jul 21 16:12:56 2015 UTC,"This is cool dude. I've thought about doing the same thing because I'm analytical by nature but just don't care enough yet.  I'm excited for the month long challenge. I cleared it with the mods, I'll be making an announcement post in the next couple days."
goodyearwelt,3e31s3,Micrafone_AssAssin,2,Tue Jul 21 16:23:02 2015 UTC,I guess I'll have to actually wear some shoes for a month.
goodyearwelt,3e31s3,havingaraveup,2,Tue Jul 21 18:27:13 2015 UTC,"I had a similar moment of clarity last night. There's a large bag in my closet right now of stuff to be donated, including a milspec leather bomber that NEVER fit me right. I've had it for the better part of a decade and have worn it maybe 30 times, never really loving it any of those 30. I think part of my wardrobe crisis comes from the fact that I haven't really purged over the years, so I've got so much stuff from times when I was still figuring out my style that there is no cohesive wardrobe, and I feel lost. My closet is full of stuff I love, but also of impulse purchases and poor sizing choices. I'm not counting the billion dress shirts I don't wear any more due to the current state of my work, as I anticipate I'll have to wear those SOME day again, I hope. Those I'm gonna keep."
goodyearwelt,3e31s3,havingaraveup,2,Tue Jul 21 17:08:08 2015 UTC,"so I've got so much stuff from times when I was still figuring out my style that there is no cohesive wardrobe   The cohesiveness is the main issue here for me as well. Mostly everything that I'm working with fits me well, and even looks good to some extent, but I really don't like the way I look in it and I feel that it doesn't represent me well, and doesn't match up with the type of aesthetic I like. I really like the idea of a minimalist/simplistic wardrobe, just not to an extreme extent. I also like the idea of having an undefined ""uniform"" or personal style. I feel like I'm almost there, but my own wardrobe is getting in the way of this. So moving forward I'll be phasing anything that doesn't jive out, and carefully considering what I want to bring in. Quality over quantity is another thing. I have to get over buying shit just because its on sale.    I'm not counting the billion dress shirts I don't wear any more due to the current state of my work, as I anticipate I'll have to wear those SOME day again, I hope. Those I'm gonna keep.   Keep grinding my friend, I have faith in you"
goodyearwelt,3e31s3,havingaraveup,2,Tue Jul 21 17:18:30 2015 UTC,"Why don't you like the way you look in certain articles?  What about it doesn't represent you well?  Any idea what your ""uniform"" or personal style may be?  I'm really interested to hear your thoughts on these.  I've given away some fire ass clothing that I should never have, so I'd say maybe store it away (if you can) for some time and if you never re-find anything you like then maybe sell it/give it away."
goodyearwelt,3e31s3,havingaraveup,2,Tue Jul 21 21:48:45 2015 UTC,"This will be a bit of an incohesive brain dump as im at work now and typing from mobile when I can, so feel free to ask me to elaborate on anything and clarify anything.   I guess what I really mean is I want to wear my clothes, not let them wear me. I want people when they walk past me to think to themselves ""hm, he was well dressed,"" not look at me and do a double take. I want people to make their assessments of me based on my character and integrity, not what Im wearing. However that does lead me into wanting a certain aesthetic that represents how I want to be portrayed. Which is well put together, semi professional but not stuffy, tasteful but not over the top. Really at the end of the day its about the man, not what he wears, but I think a picture can be painted about him in how he chooses to dress. I enjoy many different types of looks, just as i enjoy many different types of music and different types of foods. And id like my wardrobe to be more or less of a fusion of my favorite aspects of where I draw inspiration combined with my idea of what I want to look like. I like organization, clean lines, and flattering siloetes. I found a rain jacket on sale a while back that looked pretty awesome on the rack. It was my size so I grabbed it. Haven't wore it once, not even in the pouring rain. I just didnt like the way it draped and hung off of my body. For a while I was buying shit I thought looked cool because it was on sale without considering how it would fit into my wardrobe. I bought some shirts for work in various colors for the sake of variety and still found myself reaching for more toned down, less loud pieces. I didn't like the busyness of the checks on one and the colors of the others I felt were just too jaring and noisy. When I say some articles didnt represent me well I guess i mean I didn't feel comfortable in them because there was really no thought at all behind them. They were just random pieces i decided to buy because they were on sale. In other words the clothes were wearing me. Its not that Im worried about ""pulling it off,"" it just didnt feel genuine. As far as ""uniform"" or personal style goes, i feel like Im just starting to find it. It took some time, but im happy with where wardrobe is going. I dress differently based on the context, which I think is important. But it's not so much of a style difference as it is a difference in formality. I like the idea of having some key pieces (Ex: Bedford jacket ;))  or staples in my wardrobe, complemented by the rest of the look. I like the norse projects aethetic and Napoli a lot right now. When I first started getting into ""fashion"" i was really drawn to the americana/workwear aesthetic. So I started to tailor my wardrobe towards that. And i just wasnt comfortable wearing those pieces, it wasnt genuine, it wasnt me. It also wasnt working contextually. I have to dress business casual at the least when I go to one  of my jobs,  and also when Im out working on consultative projects. So I was buying shit that I wasn't even getting the chance to wear. My other job is in operations, so I wear kohl's slacks and a polo, no big deal. This is all not to say that Im against waking up, going ""fuck it"" and throwing in my jeans, some boots, a tigers hat, and WMU hoodie for class. Im not necessarily trying to over emphasize the way I dress, but rather im trying to go through a consolidation phase that will leave me with pieces I really enjoy wearing, and expanding my wardrobe from there in a manner that aligns with what's left.   I hope at least some of that made sense.....I might re read this later just to be sure haha. But Im curious to hear your thoughts"

This is 100% how I feel. I like the idea of minimalism in wardrobes, but not to the extent that some people take it. For one thing, I hate doing laundry haha. But also, yeah, I feel like there is ALMOST some greater identity in the way I dress, but ultimately the concept is still a bit of a mess. I also bought a lot of shit because it was on sale, and don't wear most of it. Like you, I want to start actively getting rid of a lot of stuff, and only introducing objects I really love. That's going to take a lot of work.   As for work clothes, right now, I'm pretty happy with where I am. I've been working for myself for a year as of last week, and have loved it.

Working for yourself sounds amazing, its something Id like to do eventually. Sometimes I feel wayyy to stressed out about my job than I probably should be"
goodyearwelt,3e31s3,akaghi,2,Tue Jul 21 17:58:39 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's a lot of work to find a through-line in your wardrobe, or establish one. One of the the biggest clothing compliments someone paid me was actually meant to be a of a jab, but in college they said ""It looks like someone just puts a ton of clothes from barney's in your drawers and you wear them without really caring."" It takes a lot of work to make it look like you don't really put too much thought into how you dress, because you often need to embrace form over function but make it look like you go ultimately shoot for function over form, I suppose. It's something I'm still working on.  Working for myself has been wonderful, mainly because my job before this was so suffocating and stressful and borderline abusive that I was having full-on breakdowns multiple times a week. Part of the problem with many corporate jobs is that we don't allow ourselves to not feel like a total wuss for being stressed. A lot of the time we don't allow ourselves to address stress because we think it's illegitimate. What sort of work do you do?"
goodyearwelt,3e31s3,ArtofExpression,2,Tue Jul 21 18:14:28 2015 UTC,"What I'm really striving for is versatility, because I think that plays a huge part in the minimalism and simplicity aspect. To me, function and form can often co-exist and I would like my wardrobe to be rooted by pieces that look really nice but also accomplish what I want them to accomplish. I would even go as far as to say that in some cases what I want pieces to accomplish is to fit well and be cohesive with the rest of my wardrobe, which accomplishes both function and form in way, and by striving for quality, well-made pieces, their longevity is also a form of function.....hm....that was a bit of a brain dump. Hope that all made sense.   Yeah man that's no good, congrats on getting yourself out and making some changes. For myself, sometimes the stress is self-imposed. I put a lot of pressure on myself to do well and do better than my predecessors (and superiors). Which is unhealthy at times and borderline unnecessary. I work in operations as a supervisor for a transportation company. The job is inherently stressful, and other things constantly factor into added stress"
goodyearwelt,3e31s3,collapsedgovernment,2,Tue Jul 21 18:39:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah that actually makes a lot of sense. For example, the pleasure I get from wearing a well-made shirt that costs 2x as much as a whatever shirt is probably more than 2x as much. I'd like a little more uniformity. It means fewer impulse purchases, and it means spending a really long time planning out each purchase, but ultimately I'm okay with that.   I think ambition puts a lot of stress on people, as you have clearly experienced yourself. Juggling the stress demands of the actual job, plus the stress you put on yourself has got to be tough. Is it the sort of work you could do from a self-employed consulting position down the line?"
goodyearwelt,3e31s3,ArtofExpression,2,Tue Jul 21 19:07:17 2015 UTC,"The planning is also gonna be huge for me, thinking about mot only how it interacts with what I will be wearing with it at the time, but also how it interacts with the rest of my wardrobe as a whole.   Is it the sort of work you could do from a self-employed consulting position down the line?   That's kind of the ultimate goal, or at something I would like to least experience down the line. My job right now lines up with me degree fairly well, from an industry and management perspective, but with far less technical aspects. I will hopefully be taking a position soon that will give me some experience in those more technical aspects, and the plan is to continue to progress whether it is with my current company or not. I'd like to do consultative type work, but more in the private equity sector. Then maybe when all is said and done, work for myself. It'll just take time really, which I have recently come to terms with. What line of work are you in?"
goodyearwelt,3e31s3,collapsedgovernment,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:35:42 2015 UTC,"That seems like a really reasonable goal. It would be hard to go right into consulting without a lot of industry-specific knowledge, so it's good that you're willing to give it time, and yourself time to develop.   I'm a writer, which is a lot easier to do on my own. I worked at a large magazine for a year and a half, and finally quit last july when I couldn't handle it. I've been writing a bunch of stuff to sustain myself financially while I work on a manuscript for what I hope will become a book. Fingers crossed.

I’m not comfortable enough to try and go D width on the rain last, and in jamie’s opinion it’s not likely to work. Unfortunate, since I really like some of the final makeups, particularly the suede jodhpur. I’m not going to lie, it is disappointing, it seems there’s always something that’s off, be it sizing or style or color. It looks like Crockett and Jones US have added two styles I like/have wanted, a dark brown suede Chelsea and a black double monk. Of course it means not getting the nice euro discount and having to pay 8.875% nyc sales tax (unless they’d ship it to new jersey for me), but the advantage is trying on in person. Sorry if I sound whiney but it’s just so frustrating that not only is finding something pretty basic a whole ordeal, I also have to pay more for it (since 3rd party stockists who might offer promos are nowhere to be found). I was sorta hyped with the gmto to buy something nice for myself after going on an inadvertent cop freeze, now I’m just bitter, since I don’t think another pair of C&J in US dollars is in the “nice” budget, I'm afraid to even go in and see what the damage would be.

Trying to figure out a pair of shoes that would look good with my navy suit and something that is casual enough for me to want to wear later.   I think I have decided that snuff suede is too light in color to match well. Stands out too much in pictures.  I tried on the Alden Dover's and they are awesome, but none of the stock colors work well (too light suede don't want dark brown chromexcel). I think something like this would work well Alden Dover Calf, but of course it's not in my seize (10d - probably the most popular size) Although it might be too light?  Any just general recommendations for shoes / styles I should look for. I don't know all that's out there but have just been sort of spinning trying to figure out something.  Shape - I really like the unstructured barrie last shape. They are sleek with out being too long or pointy. Hoping to find something similar to that."

goodyearwelt,3e31s3,soarin_,2,Wed Jul 22 00:56:17 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering is how the half-sole lifestyle works out over the long term.  The Topys thread in the basics section touches on this, but is not exactly what I'm after. There are also plenty of threads about putting half-soles on leather-soled boots to solve a particular problem -- slippery on ice, leather wearing too fast, etc. I've put a pair on some old White's and it worked out nicely.  I'm thinking of getting a pair of Nicks packers, and I'd like to wear them for decades, ideally. With a stitched-on rubber sole, I gather I'd need to resole every ~ 3 years, and the boots can take ~ 5 resolings if I throw in a complete rebuild at some point. So a lifetime of 20 years or so, with significant expense in upkeep, especially since no one local can do the work.  On the other hand, if I got them with a leather sole, there might be some pros over resoling a stitched-on rubber sole. The upkeep expense would be less, and since there is no stitching or anything messing with the upper, there shouldn't really be a finite number of times they can get resoled, so they might last longer?  The main down-side that I see to the half-soles seems to be that they can start peeling away at the edge of the sole. I could live with that issue. But are there any longer-term concerns?  So is it a completely stupid idea to order new boots with leather soles, with the intention of diy half-soling them for the next ~ 20 years? I'm suspicious that there is a reason people don't do this."
goodyearwelt,3e31s3,oOoWTFMATE,3,Tue Jul 21 16:17:52 2015 UTC,"I would go rubber.  A lugged sole will last ages and getting a resole isn't that expensive. Long-term, the costs won't be all that much amortized over the lifetime of the boots. It's also more of a set it and forget it approach."
goodyearwelt,3e31s3,calvinari,2,Tue Jul 21 18:38:37 2015 UTC,The leather sole will degrade from the removal of the half-sole. It will also degrade internally from moisture making it into the boot. I don't think you would get 20 years of peeling and reapplying half-soles without having to replace the base sole as well.
goodyearwelt,3e31s3,Skell6009,2,Tue Jul 21 16:27:24 2015 UTC,"Can you clarify your concern at all?  Are you suggesting wear on the leather distinct from the familiar debate about topys being bad because they trap moisture?  I don't imagine they would trap more moisture that a full rubber sole would.  If it meant resoling the leather every 5-10 years due to ""normal"" degradation, that might be fine."
goodyearwelt,3e31s3,calvinari,2,Tue Jul 21 17:16:31 2015 UTC,"I'm actually thinking more from the process of tearing the half-sole off and reattaching a new one. Since you should really be scraping off the old adhesive and exposing a fresh layer of leather, you lose some of the sole each time.  I think if you want your boot to last as close to 20 years as possible, do what the workboot owners of Nicks and Whites do, which is to use the full stitched on Vibram sole and replace it every few years. You may get more time out of the sole than you think - my brother in law is a wildland firefighter (working a fire up in Idaho right now), and even he only resoles his Whites every two years, and it is hard to imagine a more brutal environment for boots."

goodyearwelt,3e1n2d,pirieca,5,Tue Jul 21 08:00:22 2015 UTC,Carmina actually suggested Detroit because that's the last their blucher pattern is based on.   Also how is a waxed kudu frankenstitch and a mixed leather jodhpur boring?
goodyearwelt,3e1n2d,MatterChannel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:24:09 2015 UTC,I already bought their black boxcalf jodhpur on rain last in their outlet sales at a very good price so i'm out when it comes to jodhpurs. I do like the way this strap looks better though :(

goodyearwelt,3e1n2d,MatterChannel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:49:06 2015 UTC,I have both 11UK and i just ordered 11.5UK...The 11UK for some reason pinches the top of my big toe and bruises it if i walk a lot in it. So i messaged Carmina and i showed them pictures and they figure i should go .5 size up. It's a jodhpur boot also so i figure a bit bigger can't hurt at all.

I'm confused about why so many people seem to be complaining about not enough dress shoe makeups. Only a handful of shoes were suggested, and very few of those were dress shoes (and all of them had little to no support). A couple of dress boots were suggested as well. Carmina and their stockists have a ton of various dress makeups regularly available.  Besides, this is a special opportunity to do shell makeups. Carmina shell is exceedingly rare right now (read: totally unavailable except for single MTOs). Why waste slots doing GMTOs that can be done elsewhere if necessary? If, for example, a suede chelsea has enough support, the organizer can take it to Skoak or Gentlemen's Footwear and do a GMTO very easily. It's not a hassle to do so, but you can't do it for shell, hence the high demand for shell."

You can use the previous, this, and next year's points when staying at a Disney property (unused points are forfeited). Different resorts have different values as do different seasons.  Basically, for $15,000+ you have a guaranteed vacation for 57 or so years.  Also, you're not limited to Disney World. You can go to any Disney property (and some that aren't Disney owned I believe).

goodyearwelt,3dzc9d,burlyarab,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:46:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, 9.5E, but that was measured with medium wool socks. Probably more of a 9E in dress socks though."
goodyearwelt,3dzc9d,kjart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:48:05 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks. I'm somewhere around 11E/EE (probably a bit under 11, length wise) and was wondering if a 10UK would be wide enough (I figure 10.5 in a shoe would be too long). Since I tend to get discomfort in the waist in narrow shoes I think this last might have a chance of working."
goodyearwelt,3dzc9d,makemewaffles,2,Tue Jul 21 02:57:40 2015 UTC,10 UK sounds about right. Do you know any other sizes in other brands/lasts?
goodyearwelt,3dzc9d,makemewaffles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:59:42 2015 UTC,"AE 5 last in 10.5EEE is pretty good and spacious. AE 1 last in the same fits like a glove (a bit snug at end of the day on my feet). Viberg 1035 in 11 good with heavy socks, 10.5 might work better with thin socks. Viberg 2030 11 is good, 10.5 would probably be not enough room for pinky."
goodyearwelt,3dzc9d,makemewaffles,3,Tue Jul 21 03:03:08 2015 UTC,You fit just like me (5 last 10.5ee/eee or 11 e) and Rui in 10uk works perfectly.

goodyearwelt,3dzc9d,cobashk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:19:02 2015 UTC,Yeah sounds like 10 UK in thinner socks would be ideal.
goodyearwelt,3dzc9d,cobashk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:10:17 2015 UTC,"I think I might actually sell my Meermin LWBs and get the Carminas.  The shape of the RUI last doesn't bother me, but the last doesn't really seem to work on my foot.  Worried about the Detroit last though, since there seems to be a lot of different recommendations for sizing that."
goodyearwelt,3dzc9d,KaiW,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:22:43 2015 UTC,The RUI seems better for wider feet. It feels good walking around the house but I'll have to see how it feels over the course of an entire day outside.  Detroit scares me too but I see most people tend to go a half size down from Rain. I'd probably stick with that advice if I were to get a pair.
goodyearwelt,3dzc9d,KaiW,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:31:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have normal width feet went 1.5 down for my pair and they work well, except for slight pressure on my pinky toe.  I think that bothers me enough though that I need to move on from them.  Just one size down would likely be too large since I only wear thin dress socks with shoes like these.  Don't have anything in Rain, but assume that would mean going down 1.5 from Brannock for Detroit also.  There's actually a shop in Pittsburgh that has some pairs of the Carmina LWBs...trying to decide if it's worth the trip out there to try them on and buy them there."

I'm in philly, so not that far...but I don't have a car so the cost of renting a car might not make it any cheaper than ordering 2 pairs from Carmina and eating the costs of returning one.

Also, I've heard Alden's recent QC come up as questionable from time to time. Is there any reason behind this aside from an increase in demand?  Lastly, is there any part of production that is started well before there is demand for the exact model. Such as stacking the heels for example?"
goodyearwelt,3dyfkv,Lost_boy_,2,Mon Jul 20 16:10:45 2015 UTC,What am I looking at in the last photo?   This photo? It looks like a place where they store all their cutting dies.

goodyearwelt,3dyfkv,akaghi,2,Mon Jul 20 17:01:41 2015 UTC,"The last photo shows some of Alden's cutting dies, which are used in combination with a hydraulic press to cut out panels for various models.  I can't really comment on the QC question.  I don't know if Alden does heel stacks prior to any exact model, but they're also running wait times of 6+ months. I'm sure they're not doing a ton of advance work with that long of a backup. They likely precut their insoles, if they cut them themselves, but there's not much else they likely do ahead of time."
goodyearwelt,3dyfkv,Lost_boy_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:16:34 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thanks. Artisanal work is operationally at the opposite end of the spectrum of what I'm used to, so I always find their manufacturing practices interesting."

goodyearwelt,3dyfkv,Deusis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:54:30 2015 UTC,It is hard to be efficient (or implement more efficient processes) when you can't keep up with current demand in the first place.
goodyearwelt,3dyfkv,akaghi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:55:56 2015 UTC,"They've had like 100 years though.  Given the automation, they could certainly be quicker.  I imagine their work force is aging, though."

goodyearwelt,3dyfkv,Lost_boy_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:12:57 2015 UTC,"I guess that's why it strikes me as peculiar, because if they're rather large it would seem like they would have resources for good QC in the case of an increase in demand, and their lead times are out there enough to ensure this"
goodyearwelt,3dyfkv,akaghi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:58:16 2015 UTC,"Depends how many shoes they make and at what speed.  Wolverine makes tons of shoes and has terrible QC. They're the largest shoemaker there is.  Their lead time could be to give them cushion (they refuse to give estimates), it could be volume and demand, or any number of factors.  But you are right. Their QC should be better."
goodyearwelt,3dyfkv,JOlsen77,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:04:00 2015 UTC,What motivation do they have to improve QC when they already sell out of everything?

There are options and alternatives out there for competitive prices, but their foothold is too strong in the industry for this to worry them.

goodyearwelt,3dyfkv,JOlsen77,2,Tue Jul 21 01:15:09 2015 UTC,"Pressure from brands like Carmina and Meermin does force Alden to at least keep up.   I respectfully disagree..   Alden appears to have made a conscious decision to not expand their operations, perhaps wary that ""menswear"" is a fleeting trend. They haven't introduced new lasts or new models ( I don't count mix-matching existing elements). This strategy has kept them alive while so many others have fallen, and I suspect that many more will fold before Alden does.  There will always be some people (not me) who place a high premium on buying a MiUSA product. Couple that with their unique treatment of shell (whether an individual actually prefers it is irrelevant--that shit sells), and I really don't see anyone or anything compelling Alden to improve.   I enjoy clean welt seams and better QC as much as anyone, but they literally can't keep production up with demand. As long as that holds true, they're not gonna change."
goodyearwelt,3dyfkv,Spicy_Poo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:30:00 2015 UTC,"I think any hand made product is going to have it's inherent inconsistencies, and Alden is no exception.  Some people expect perfection, and I think that's unrealistic.  They have a high volume which is going to mean higher number of QC issues as well.  Personally, I've found better overall quality in the shell offerings than the others, which makes sense as they'd probably have their more experienced people working on shell since it's hard to work with and mistakes are much more expensive.  I ordered 3 403 CXL indy boots before getting a pair that was acceptable.  The first had great uppers but the heel stacks were very different and it was very uncomfortable.  The second had such terrible loose grain that I didn't even bother trying them on."

Some people expect perfection, and I think that's unrealistic. They have a high volume which is going to mean higher number of QC issues as well.   I agree, however I think that nonconformaties should be consistent, and directly related, to production. It seems at times that given the size of the company there are arguably more issues with QC than there proportionally should be.  No one expects perfection from anyone but I think the key variable here is price. I personally am going to feel more comfortable  about QC issues from a lower tier company opposed to a higher one, and usually expect them to some extent. Quality issues, in my mind, should diminish as size and prestige of the company go up (often correlated with price).     I ordered 3 403 CXL indy boots before getting a pair that was acceptable. The first had great uppers but the heel stacks were very different and it was very uncomfortable. The second had such terrible loose grain that I didn't even bother trying them on.   For the price of Indy boots I think it is unfair to the customer to expect them to buy and return a pair of boots more than twice to come across a pair that is satisfactory. They should get stopped by QC and sold as seconds. This might be unreasonable, but for the price and size of a company like Alden, I'm not sure that sits well with me"

Here is the kicker.  It turned out that the 11D I had originally ordered was too small.  I tried the 11.5D and it ended up being too wide.

They have lining in the toe and around the heel / ankle.  The toe sweeps back pretty dramatically (similar to Viberg). The PTBs have a much more structured toe that raises up more before it sweeps back.  So, the dover looks a littler slimmer / sleeker."

goodyearwelt,3dzee9,romanomnom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:18:08 2015 UTC,"IMO the Hiro is not a nice PTB or LWB last. For a monk strap or an oxford it's okay, but it's not a flattering non-dressy shape."

goodyearwelt,3dykt0,Nareshiyengar,4,Mon Jul 20 16:15:09 2015 UTC,"Introduction   I have always been enamored by the idea of Chelsea Boots but never really pursued them. I don’t know what caused the switch in my head to ‘flip’ but all of a sudden I found myself looking around for different brands to look into.  This review is based on one day of wear, so I’ll have more solid remarks in a few weeks.  The Acquisition  I didn’t know if I could pull off Chelsea Boots the way I wanted to, but I decided that I wanted to try. I didn’t want to spend too much on a pair.  I looked into Bexley and I also looked into Jack Erwin before realizing that I definitely wanted mine to be suede (in true Yeezy fashion). I then looked at Carmina  reviewed here. I love these boots, but I wasn’t quite sure I wanted to spend that much yet since I didn’t know how I would like them (they didn’t have my size). After looking around, I settled decided on Meermin.. These cost me $246.75 USD through PayPal and arrived exactly one week after ordering.   Closer Examination   I didn’t really include many photos of my inspection, but the stitching at the welt seems solid. I’d say it could be better, but I’m happy for the price I paid. There’s one nail on the right heel that isn’t as far in the sole as the rest, but I’m pretty sure it won’t be an issue. There’s one spot right here that I’m not terribly happy about, but it’s not a huge deal.  The boots look a bit lighter in person, I’d say, as opposed to on the Meermin website, but it’s pretty close.  The Fit   These are on the Hiro last which is a single E width. I had emailed Meermin asking about sizing, and they sent me insole measurements (length, width) which I compared to my foot tracing measurements and decided on TTS UK, meaning I am a US 9 and ordered an 8 UK. I’d say the fit is pretty immaculate. The idea of laceless boots is going to take some getting used to, but I love just being able to pull them on a lot. I have a feeling these will be my running errand boots.  Like I said, the boots fit well, but the soles are quite stiff right out of the box, but I’m confident that when the break-in process is over these will fit like a dream.  Conclusion  I’m very satisfied with my decision with these boots. I love the Fox Suede that Carmina has, but I think that at the end of the day I prefer the Rapello suede.  I love the way the color varies depending on light. They’re darker in low light but look quite light in bright light (don’t mind the water jug, lol).  At the price point, I’d recommend them, but if you could be persuaded to up your budget I would probably suggest Carmina. They have a Polo Suede pair that's up for preorder on Skoaktiebolaget, and I have no doubts that they will be fantastic.  What’s Next?  What’s next for me? Hopefully nothing in the near future, but we all know that’s not happening. I’m gonna take a step back and look at what I have and go from there. Maybe a pair of Rancourt/Alden Loafers.  Thanks for reading, and let me know if you have any questions!"
goodyearwelt,3dykt0,Lost_boy_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:15:13 2015 UTC,I've been looking for these from Meermin's eBay seconds page religiously for about a month and a half now. After your review I might just toss in the towel and order from Meermin directly. They're really awesome. And a week from ordering to arriving at your door is pretty damn good. How do you like the Hiro last? At first I wasn't fond of the shape towards the toe but as I wore it more it grew on me exponentially and now I'm quite fond of it
goodyearwelt,3dykt0,bonersaurus-rex,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:29:42 2015 UTC,"Like I said in the body, I've only worn these once so my opinions are limited, but I like it. It accommodates my wide foot well enough and the shape looks pretty damn good on-foot, imo."

I have had them for over a year now and abuse them regularly but they clean up perfectly.   People that say suede is not as hardy could not be more wrong. I have worn these on the beach, dirty cities, and hiking including a five mile hike in the Sierra Nevadas. I have spilled beer, red wine, and olive oil on them, vomited on them, gotten them wet, dusty, and muddy and every time water and my Kiwi suede brush have cleaned them perfectly.  I wear them with shorts, athletic shorts, jeans, and chinos in the summer and winter.   I really need to take some pictures and do a review.  They are a half size down from brannock so a little tight for Quoddy sizing but they have formed to my feet like a glove. My only regret is they are too tight for socks."

I'll skip the sneakers for today though.   Carmina captoe derby boot in cogac shell: tough, can handle any conditions, yet also a boot that strikes a nice balance between formal and casual. Also, shell. Carmina jumper in natural kudu: such an amazing leather. Lots of character, supple and strong. They look even better after a bit of darkening through wear/a round of conditioning.  Dayton Service Boot in charcoal nubuck: these boots are so sexy. Seriously, they are hot (old pictures). Do I really need to say anything else? Rider Boot Co Dundalk in light reverso: such a fantastic leather, gains character extremely well, and these things are slipper-like in their comfort level. White's Smokejumpers in red dog roughout: Beautiful roughout, sturdy as can be, 7 inches. Just a burly boot and different styling from most of my other footwear Quoddy Maliseet in olive chromexcel: These things are seriously so comfortable. So incredibly comfortable. Chromepak sole is holding up well, and the cxl looks fantastic (shoutout to /u/stevenkmason, I know you're obsessed with this combo) Trickers bluchers in black shell cordovan: such a well fitting last, such a versatile pair of bluchers, and still so incredibly attractive. I've been trying not to wear these every day and still give my boots some love. Yuketen Sami moc in tan latigo: I might get these resoled on a honey crepe eventually, but these are such a wonderful change of pace shoe, impeccably made, and the leather is gorgeous. Practically no creasing on the vamp whatsoever."

No real opportunity to do so, although I should just say fuck it and wear them to drinks some time. Probably won't sell them for now though, but it annoys me to own something that gets no use."

I love this pair, my first pair of Alden, got them used from Ebay. Alden Dover #8. This is one of my grail. Technically my first Alden but since they are pre-order, the Dover snuff suede arrived before this pair. Viberg Derby black matte calf. From Viberg's sample sale last day. Love the leather, they are not dressy at all but they are passable as 'work appropriate shoes' at my office. Allen Edmonds Neumok brown. My oldest pair on this list, got them during 2 for $250 event, still going strong and the leather aged nicely.

goodyearwelt,3dyriw,Micrafone_AssAssin,3,Tue Jul 21 04:25:54 2015 UTC,"I kinda touched on this in the future purchases thread the other day but I am finally settled into my second line up and I'm extremely happy with the options I have: White sneakers, two PTD's (patent black and taupe suede), a cropped jodhpur in oiled black suede, and dark brown work boots.  Between these five pairs I should have a tremendous amount of versatility given my wardrobe.  I think the biggest factor here is that I have multiple pieces of footwear that will work for most outfits, and there isn't too much overlap between the styles.  I could have worn this today with, potentially, either of my plain toe derbies.  This could have been suede PTD's, white sneakers, or the work boots and all would look good.  I feel better that I now look at footwear in the context of my potential outfits vs the mindset I had during my Viberg era when it was ""I have Vibergs, every outfit is good now.""  I don't think that was very conducive to growth.  I consider myself extremely fortunate to be able to be so comfortable with my clothing and style in general, and I don't mean this in a bragging sort of way.  More of a ""thank goodness I'm finally where I wanted to be"" sort of way.  I've had some severe ups and downs with footwear (and some clothing purchases) in the past year, that were frustrating to say the least, and it's good to be somewhere not so volatile with what's coming in and out of my line up.    Thank god for my Buttero Tanino's... These deserve a special thank you.  They literally held the fort down during a dark time of low tier sneakers, figuring out split sizing options, and some shifts in my style.  So versatile, so comfortable, so simple and accessible.  At this point they are very well broken in and the padded leather insert has become the most comfortable insole I have ever used.  Probably one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I have ever worn consistently.  You da real MVP <3"

I went through exorbitant shipping and customs costs for these (almost 40% extra!) that made me hate these shoes at first, but they just feel so good on my feet. I've spent 3x as much on shoes that definitely did not feel nearly as good. Also, the suede is rather handsome and I do like the rolls it is developing. It has quickly become my go-to shoe, even though it is one of my cheapest.   As a result, I've decided to size up to 10D on all my future shoes b/c of how good I feel in these bad boys."

Hide and Leather adds to this the following comment:    　Edward L. White was the originator of ""Box Calf."" He was head of White & Co.. tanners, Lowell, Mass., afterwards merged into tho American Hide and Leather Co. organization. ""Ed"" White, far from being dead, is very much alive, and is superintendent of Barnet's big tannery at Little Fulls, N.Y. If I remember rightly. Mr. White told me, many years ago, when visiting him in Lowell, that when casting about for the best name for his new leather, he very wisely consulted his wife. Mrs. White recalled buying shoes in London, England, from a shoe retailer named Box. The shoes were so good she remembered the quality and suggested that ""Box"" sounded well, and it was promptly adopted by her clever and enterprising husband, who was a master hand in manufacturing ooze and other high-class calf leathers. It was an inspiration, and when the leather achieved fame, the name was adopted by so many other tanners of leather made to imitate the Ed White output that after a brief season of ineffectual legal warnings and remonstrances the word ""Box"" was generally applied to all light leathers bearing the well known ""Box"" grain. 　Charles Grammar, a cousin of Ed White, died long ago. He, was manager of the Boston office of White & Co. before becoming manager of the Boston office of the Ohio Leather Co., Girard. Ohio, which has grown to be a large and flourishing manufacturer of light upper leathers."

goodyearwelt,3dvaww,jso1,8,Sun Jul 19 20:38:53 2015 UTC,"The Horween color spectrum!  I've been on a bit of a ""shell kick"" lately. I've tried to collect as much of the spectrum of shells that Horween offers as is feasible (and reasonable). I decided this afternoon to take out my shell shoes and boots and take a few photos. Perhaps this will help those of you who are interested in the various colors of shell, and to see the differences between them.  Using the first photo as a reference, here are the models/colors:  Top row (left to right):   Black shell - Alden Plain Toe Boot, leather sole - 379X last (TheShoeMart irregulars) Navy shell - Allen Edmonds Dundee, Dainite sole - 511 last (MTO, trunk show)  Color #8 shell - Alden Wingtip Boot, leather sole - Barrie last (Alden DC) Cigar shell - Alden Cap Toe Boot, leather sole - Barrie last (Alden of Madison) Dark Cognac shell (called ""Brown"" by AE) - Allen Edmonds Strand, JR sole - 65 last (Altman's in Chicago) Walnut shell - Allen Edmonds Dalton, JR sole - 511 last (MTO)   Bottom row (right to left):   Ravello shell - Alden Longwing Blucher, leather sole - Barrie last (Leffot) Cognac shell - Carmina 922, leather sole - Rain last (Carmina direct) Whiskey shell - Alden Plain Toe Blucher, leather sole - Barrie last (Alden SF) Natural shell - Allen Edmonds MacNeil, JR sole - 97 last (MTO, trunk show) Color #2 shell (called ""Rubi"" by Carmina) - Carmina 80105, JR sole - Simpson last (Carmina direct)   As you can see, some colors overlap quite a lot (like Walnut/Ravello and Whiskey/Cognac), while others are very different. I have a few other pairs of shell shoes, but they're the same color (another Alden LWB in Ravello, and an AE Cambridge in Color #8), so I didn't add them to this lineup.  At this point, I'm pretty satisfied with the collection. I'm thinking to perhaps replace the Cigar captoe boot with a Cigar LWB, and to acquire a Carmina derby in green shell. If AE does another trunk show, I might try to get another color that I don't have, but for now I'm pretty well satisfied.  Anyway, hope this color comparison is useful to some of you."

goodyearwelt,3dvaww,Nareshiyengar,2,Sun Jul 19 21:05:20 2015 UTC,Thank you - they are the latest acquisition! I wore them for a test fitting but haven't flexed them yet! Definitely keeping them.
goodyearwelt,3dvaww,300andWhat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:07:39 2015 UTC,Excited to see them age! I think that I'll look into some Alden Suede PTBs down the road
goodyearwelt,3dvaww,300andWhat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:28:33 2015 UTC,"I recommend the Dover PTB. It's a slightly better pattern for suede, in my opinion. I believe Leffot and many other retailers carry it. I have a pair of snuff suede longwings (9794) and I adore them."

goodyearwelt,3dvaww,pints,2,Sun Jul 19 21:42:07 2015 UTC,Just under a year or so. I sold off most of my calfskin shoes over the course of that period to make room for these. I try to keep my total shoe count below two dozen.

Nearly everything, including the weather, affects the color, so just keep in mind that your shell may vary from these somewhat."
goodyearwelt,3dvaww,JOlsen77,3,Sun Jul 19 22:18:51 2015 UTC,"agreed. The Ravello posted, while beautiful (I own two pair in that shade), is quite a difference from Ravello of the past (and more recently, thankfully, the future)  http://i.imgur.com/ilbo575l.jpg"
goodyearwelt,3dvaww,MatterChannel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:17:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, agreed. The color variance seems to be strongest with Alden's special shell colors like Ravello, Whiskey, and Cigar."

goodyearwelt,3dy2xi,stevenkmason,44,Mon Jul 20 14:00:44 2015 UTC,"Soooo I had the best weekend ever.  THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ALL OF YOU GUYS FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND CONGRATULATIONS! I always talk to my girlfriend (fiance!) about my ""Internet Shoe Friends"" jokingly but you guys are so awesome and I'm glad to call a lot of you friends.  First of all, she said yes!  If anyone is interested in the story, here we go!   First, Friday was my girlfriend's birthday. She thought I was going to work and she was off and sleeping in but I woke her up and told her to get ready because we were going on a birthday adventure. So I told her what to pack (and I packed her swim suit without telling her. Actually I packed 6 so she would have one she liked) and after a stop at Starbucks, we were off.  We drove a couple hours to Ohio and made our first stop at a drive through African Safari Park. She is a huge animal lover so this was fun. We hung out with giraffes and elk and other cool animals.  After that we went to Kalahari, which is a cool indoor water park that we've been to a few times before. For various reasons, it's a special place to us. We checked in, PET A BABY TIGER, went to the waterpark and went on slides and in the wave pool and lazy river and stuff. Then I had a nice massage booked for her. Then we had a nice dinner.   After dinner we went up to the room and sat on the balcony with some champagne for her and chocolate covered strawberries and I gave a nice lil romantic speech and asked her. She said yes and it was great. Called a million people then went to bed and had awesome breakfast buffet Saturday morning before heading back to Michigan.  Saturday we went to dinner in Greektown and to a Tigers game with some family and friends to celebrate her birthday and the engagement. Had to take a Tigers fit pic.  My FIANCE and I both wore white Vans to the game. Mine are size 16 and hers are women's 5 or men's 3.  Someone got us a shoe related card for our engagement, knowing my love of footwear.  Sunday we slept half the day and had a nice dinner and now it's back to reality, but with the added fun and excitement of wedding planning.  WSAYWT: AE Daltons in Dark Chocolate with Luxire chinos and BR polo. Fit pic.  GD: Would anyone be interested in doing a month long WSAYWT challenge? With an album of all your fits for the month?  AOTD: White's Bounty Hunters in Brown Dress, NEOC Mohawk Trail Boot in Navy Chromexcel, and a RM Williams chelsea in a dark brown suede. Hopefully it will happen like this. I've made a lot of ""random"" purchases in the past couple months. Need to get back to being more strategic."
goodyearwelt,3dy2xi,Micrafone_AssAssin,7,Mon Jul 20 14:02:13 2015 UTC,Amazing... thank you for sharing this!  That baby tiger is so freaking cute holy crap I'm jealous.   Hung out with... elk   You hung out with a future Viberg service boot?  :D Too soon?   Actually I packed 6 so she would have one she liked   hahaha I actually laughed out loud at this.  And btw your feet look outrageously huge compared to hers.  GD - I would definitely be interested in this.

I think my pair is the light brown, but in googling looks the same as biscuit. It's a beautiful orange brown that feels great. I think it'll age well, in both if you beat them up or baby them. Dusty is quite a cream colour that would be hard to pull off imo."

goodyearwelt,3dy2xi,Micrafone_AssAssin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:21:07 2015 UTC,"I started wearing my ISC's with some break while cuffed when I first bought them.  I think it looks fine but it was stupid that I did it because now that they are hemmed you can see the fade lines from the inside of the cuffs prior to being hemmed.  I'm with you though, sometimes I flake between double and triple cuffs which is basically some break or no break.  I think that either looks fine in reality though.  Full break will probably be easily to deal with though because if you cuff again for no break I bet your pants will get caught on the pull tab a lot."
goodyearwelt,3dy2xi,Bergolies,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:28:36 2015 UTC,"They already get caught pretty frequently (as in pretty much every time I stand up from my desk). The pull tabs are super convenient for getting the boots on, especially when they were brand new, but they are frustrating when it comes to keeping my pants flat."
goodyearwelt,3dy2xi,bonersaurus-rex,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:30:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I absolutely love them on my Daytons when putting them on.

goodyearwelt,3dy2xi,Deusis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:40:39 2015 UTC,Mid length wallets definitely aren't for the standard wallet user. It is definitely for a more specific aesthetic. They aren't really intended to be super thin but I'd say this is pretty thin for a mid-length wallet. It fit into my back pocket stuffed with cards and cash.

goodyearwelt,3dz20x,Devon8822,5,Mon Jul 20 18:14:44 2015 UTC,"Would you guys rate Iron Rangers as one of the lower quality handmade boots?   The answer and the whole discussion really have to be caveats around price categories.   In the $200-$400 range, Red Wing is probably the best of the bunch. Yes, things go out that probably should be rated as seconds. But there's a lot of bang for the buck with them.  Once you jump up into the White's price range, I think you get a lot more for your money. There are plenty of mistakes made by them, Nicks, and the others in that range. But it's generally easy to get them taken care of since you're usually able to communicate exactly what the problem is and what needs to be fixed."
goodyearwelt,3dz20x,rev_rend,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:50:17 2015 UTC,"I would also not consider Red Wing any more handmade than Nike or New Balance.  It's semantics, to be sure, but when I think of handmade boots it generally only includes a sewing machine for closing the uppers.  Maybe I'm being a bit pretentious, and —honestly— I am, but RW, Chipp, Corcoran, PW Minor, Wolverine, etc are an elevated version of basically every other RTW shoe you come across (IMO).  I agree with everything you've said, though.  I would go with White's if I were OP. I think no matter what he gets from any brand in this tier will have issues out of the box or soon after that bug him.  Not that White's will be perfect, but a speedhook issue could be easily remedied."
goodyearwelt,3dz20x,akaghi,3,Tue Jul 21 02:55:21 2015 UTC,"Then so is everything else. Alden uses machines for basically everything, Carmina does as well, Viberg, etc. They all machine last, machine rapid, etc. Only pure hand lasted hand welted shoes are handmade in your book"
goodyearwelt,3dz20x,sklark23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:30:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I pretty much admitted that.  I would say some shoes are more or less handmade than others, yeah.  It's purely descriptive to me though and makes no judgement on quality, which is probably why I loathe companies and Kickstarter proclaiming their shoes are handmade.  What shoes arent made by hands? Nike are made by hand, but I don't think people would consider them handmade.   Dayton's boots are more handmade than Viberg, but not better; it's just that their machines are broken for instance.  My point was that as you automate things, they become quicker. Mistakes are easier to make, so you need people there to spot them.  If Alden really has a six month lead time, they need to hire people, unless they view this as some bizarre fad and don't want to overextend themselves hiring new union employees that could sink them in five years."

goodyearwelt,3dz20x,akaghi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:03:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like I said it's a personal semantic distinction, so it's basically worthless.  White's makes a good boot.

Up until now, I had a cheap pair of black shoes for formal events like interviews and career fairs. I had been researching Allen Edmonds for a while. When the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale started, I ordered them direct from Allen Edmonds, as they price match Nordstrom. I also used the American Express $50 off on each, which made these $229.05 each. I am extremely happy with my purchase; they look absolutely stunning in person. The pair on the left are black Park Avenues and the pair on the right are walnut Strands. I am usually an 8.5D-9D, but I was sized into an 8E at the store, since this last runs long. I plan to wear the Park Avenues mostly with suits for formal occasions, while the Strands will be my fun around town shoes that I will most likely wear with a button down and chinos."

goodyearwelt,3du50n,Balloonicorn,3,Mon Jul 20 01:42:32 2015 UTC,Went to the bk museum yesterday to see a sneaker exhibit. Also stumbled on what looked like a post apocalyptic arcade game room.   From the exhibition (sorry for bad quality pics)  These Adidas are coming out next year and are fire.   These sneakers are about a 100 years old. Still in pretty good shape.   Its a little hard to tell but up to at least 1939 running shoes like these had a stitched outsole.   OG Stans from the 70s look great.   RO dunks just hanging out.   Most of the other stuff was rare nikes that I didn't really care about.   GD: went a birthday party last night and was surrounded by bros. I don't miss that part of college. I can't remember the last time I had to make such mundane conversation.   Going to see The Wolfpack later on and I'm very excited about it. Should be a stellar film based on what I've heard.

It wasn't supposed to rain until today but the storm came early and I got totally soaked, then had to walk around in the mud most of the day.  Any advice on how to clean them up well? They got soaked pretty much through, and they have a good amount of mud caked on there. I got home late last night and put them in shoe trees but I haven't touched them since then.  I'm thinking I'm going to use a wet cloth to get as much of the mud off as possible, then spend a lot of time with a suede brush trying to get any remaining dirt out. Think that will be enough? Should I put some leather conditioner on the outside as well? I know you're not really supposed to put leather conditioner (I have lexol and AE conditioner) on suede, but I just want to make sure it doesn't get dry and crack.  Any tips?

Wanted to dress rather conservatively for my first day... navy blazer, blue button down, olive Jomers, linen Anon socks, and these derbies.  I need to get a feel for the place before I show up in my usual Hawaiian get up or some cray cray out there shirts I have.  GD: Best first day of work ever.  Turns out IT didn't have my access/permissions to the EMR set up correctly so I couldn't access what I needed to in order to do my job.  Physician told me to go enjoy the beach and be outside or something.  Now I have more time to work on my applications, yay!  The studs on my Ithside Commando sole have begun to rip off after what I consider to be little to no wear.  The middle left lugs and the right lug second up from the bottom are either ripped off completely or beginning to rip.  Don't remember this with Dainite...

goodyearwelt,3du50n,makemewaffles,2,Sun Jul 19 18:13:40 2015 UTC,"I think the factors at play here are brittleness vs ductility.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittleness  What is happening (IMO) is that the itshide is more brittle then dainite. So fracturing occurs rather then deformation (flex).  What that means is that the itshide is ""stronger"" -> can take more acute stress but can not absorb as much energy as a more ductile material. So chipping occurs.  People tend to equate hardness with brittleness even if its only part of the story...  # alsonotamaterialengineer  If anyone knows better please correct me!"
goodyearwelt,3du50n,Micrafone_AssAssin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:50:20 2015 UTC,best answer I've heard so far.
goodyearwelt,3du50n,akaghi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:58:37 2015 UTC,Thank you for the vote of confidence...  Unfortunately its really only glossing over the possible differences.  It could just be bad grain structure from the moulding process. It could be a combination of that with poor creep. It could be a really terrible glass transition temperature.  I think at the end of the day we can safely say itshide is going to chip but its not going to fail before dainite (overall as a unit).
goodyearwelt,3du50n,Micrafone_AssAssin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:13:48 2015 UTC,"Might help a bit, but likely would wear off pretty quickly.  Wax or something like snoseal might work also, you might be able to work that up into the stitch holes a bit."
goodyearwelt,3du50n,akaghi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:46:13 2015 UTC,"That was one of my concerns was how long the scotch guard would actually last, even if sprayed directly into the stitches.

goodyearwelt,3du50n,Micrafone_AssAssin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:52:32 2015 UTC,"I think water working its way up is unlikely, but I'd probably use something more waterproof and solid, like Obenaufs LP or snoseal.  I did that on my Bean boots for the winter and I don't think it made a difference."
goodyearwelt,3du50n,akaghi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:59:20 2015 UTC,"Isn't that one of the notable flaws of blake construction?  That water can get all up in those stitches into the inside of the boot?  What if you step in a puddle, or get caught in the rain?  I HATE soggy socks or wet feet with a passion, so it's something I'd like to avoid at all costs if possible.  Bean boots are completely different than my blake jodhpurs though.  Water isn't going to get in the rubberized/sealed bottom, and much more unlikely to get in through the uppers just because of the leather being so high up."
goodyearwelt,3du50n,makemewaffles,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:03:09 2015 UTC,"I meant where the rubber is stitched to the leather upper, and I stand in water and snow so it was an insurance policy.  As for your first comment, yeah. But it may be more of a theoretical flaw than a real world one. I think it depends on the maker too. I believe people have had issues with Rancourt's Blake boots, for instance.  My guess is regular wear won't cause an issue (I could totally be wrong, though).  Thread is waxed, so it should protect some. GYW are technically also susceptible to water too.  To get your foot wet with Blake, I think you need to have your foot in water for an extended period. Not just regular puddles and rain."

goodyearwelt,3du50n,oOoWTFMATE,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:40:47 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you suit up for work based on those models. What about chukka boots? Are you sticking with AE or willing to explore other brands?   Three that came to mind:  • Alden 975 (burgundy shell cordovan longwing bluchers), would look great with navy and grey suits, odd trousers in a range of shades, and they can do double-duty with jeans on the weekends. They're the most-used shoes in my collection.   • AE Dundee chukka in brown or burgundy shell. Can definitely be worn with suits, odd trousers, etc, and also work great with jeans.   • Alden PTB in burgundy shell cordovan. There's something to be said for the simplicity of this style. I have these in Ravello shell and they are exceptional. Work great with odd trousers and jeans as well. I have never worn mine with a suit but imagine they would work fine with a suit with some texture or variation in the color (tweed or a heathered wool, etc). Since they're a blucher and have a double leather sole, they're a sturdy/substantial shoe and wouldn't work great with an ultra formal suit."

I read some of the guides here and this statement stood out:   Do not apply much polish to any area that gets wear, such as the vamp.    How much is ""much""? Will I get uneven wear if I add polish to the vamp when they're new?"
goodyearwelt,3du50n,pirieca,0,Sun Jul 19 15:59:30 2015 UTC,"Polish on the vamp will crack in flex areas and leave an ugly but removable residue. I would recommend letting the color even out over time, and if you must try to fix it, use a cream polish instead of wax."

I'll need whichever one I choose by the end of November. I put money down for the Daytons at the end of June but it was timed with the Anniversary sale as well, which means the upper quote Andrew gave me was 5 months, giving very little leeway (Which, since people here seem to have bad experiences with the waits going longer than Dayton quotes, is bad). Truman, on the other hand, seemed regretful about wait times going up to 5 weeks... so that's not a problem.  In addition, I'm starting to second guess how well the Daytons'd work in outfits. I can't say I really like them in any of the fits I can find them in on old waywts, though they look great by themselves. The tan roughout just seems a lot more versatile (Not to say the Dayton's wouldn't be, all the pants I tend to wear would work with either).  What do y'all think?

Sold the new pair at a loss (didn't fit), and ended up with a slightly worn pair for the equivalent cost of about $220. After a few months of ownership, I'm satisfied, and happy with the results.

I don't think the wrinkling is worse than what would happen with a few wears anyway, but these were too small so only ever tried on for size and never really worn.  There was a lot of excess black polish on the shoes so when I touched them it got all over my fingers.  I cleaned most of it off but there may well be more on them so a good clean and polish wouldn't hurt these things."

The shoes are on the Forest last.  I love the look and feel of these shoes, but after wearing them twice, I've decided that they are not the right size for me.

My right foot (the problem foot) is a 9.5E and due to an old sports injury, these shoes don't work for me.

For reference, I am a 8.5D/E on Brannock with a medium/high instep, 8E in Allen Edmonds's 65 last, 8E in Alden's Barrie, 8.5E in Alden's Leydon, UK7.5 in Carmina's Rain last, 8 in Clark Desert Boots, and a 9 in Vans, and I found these to fit comfortably both length and width wise.

Unfortunately, I got rid of the box, so the sale includes only the boots.  These were purchased new in August 2014 and were worn about 2-3 times a week during a Northeastern US winter. They were always very well taken care of; brushed with a horsehair brush after each wear and stored with cedar shoe trees when not worn, and never worn on consecutive days. The heels have wear (see pictures), but otherwise, they're in very good condition with plenty of life left.  These boots are not meant to be babied; not only are they durable, but they're the most comfortable pair of shoes I've ever owned (though breaking them in certainly wasn't fun...). Red Wings do tend to run large, so something to keep in mind when determining sizing. If you need some sizing help, let me know and I'll be happy to help as much as I can."

goodyearwelt,3dqoq8,usedtobeneverwas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:10:45 2015 UTC,"NIB Edward Green Kentmere Boot w/ EG shoe trees - 12UK  Hey folks -  I'm trying to get out of my preorder for what I think will be an incredible Edward Green boot at what will ultimately be an incredible price. If you have a large foot (I wear 12D Barrie), this is a great opportunity to expand your collection and pick up a unique EG model!  These boots are simply too similar to a couple of other grain/captoe boots I already own so I'm trying to get out of my preorder. I paid approximately $300 in January and have another 6800 SEK (approx. $785 right now) to pay in October when the boots are ready for customers. Buy me out ($300 to me now and we'll work with Skoak to just switch the order to you) and enjoy these! (I can also be interested in a trade or some combination of shoes or boots and money.)  If anyone has followed Skoak's SF affiliate thread, too, they know that EG prices for NA customers are about to increase by about 50% (to match Leffot, Gents. Footwear, Khaki of Carmel, and the rest of the NA retailers). This again is a really great price for a really great boot that can be delivered straight from the retailer to you. Have you never tried EG? This could be your best chance!   Model: The Kentmere is a unique EG model; It's an anniversary edition (per Gabriel at Skoak) which I think will only be available via MTO in the future (at least via Skoak) Last: Crafted on the new 72 last; rounded toe model most similar to EG's 202 last (I took my Barrie size) Leather: Brown Utah calf, perfect ""country boot"" texture Sole: Ridgeway rubber sole Size: 12UK Width: E (standard width in UK sizes)"

They're black engineer boots, the model is called ""Stockton"".  I'm not sure Wolverine is running them in season right now, but the MSRP is ~$300-$500 when they're in stock.

goodyearwelt,3dr1ex,Callusing,7,Mon Jul 20 01:43:53 2015 UTC,"I've got two groups, and two specific boots, on my to-get list. The latter I'm hoping to fill as the opportunity arises, the former I'm hoping to sit back and think and figure out the perfect purchase.     The two specific boots are both Butteros. (I can't believe I still don't own any Buttero)     I've been eyeing the Burnished Leather Tolfas at Barneys for ages...I actually ordered them once, canceled my order, and have regretted canceling ever since. Next 40% or 50% off sale, I'm hoping to nab them. The leather is incredible...you can see it up close on these and these and just...wow. I also want a pair of hikers, now that I've convinced myself that I can make them fit in with the rest of my all-skinny wardrobe. There's been a pair in my size floating around on eBay for ages, though it might have finally sold.    And on that note, Buttero's new collection is pretty much fire top to bottom...I love these black laceups and their phenomenal take on the chelsea boot. And the shape on these other black boots is to me, pretty much perfect. And finally, they might have out-Marostica'd Diemme.     The two categories I'm hoping to fill are: One pair of dope black/grey boots Something really aggressive. Current front runners are:     Dayton Service Boots (obvi) The Last Conspiracy Surla (I'm still a bit salty I let a pair of Surveyors on sale slip away) Peter Nappi Roccos (I hesitated and let somebody beat me to both Roccos and Juliuses in my size this past sales season, and have regretted it ever since)  Guidi 995s Hoping Diemme might have a good Firenze come AW15 Maybe something from Marsell or Plokhov, but I think the latter is too aggressive and the former too expensive. (Marsell is just expensive at MSRP as Guidi and Nappi, but both go for much lower prices on sale/used)  And, in a perfect world, I'd love to get some A1923s (those are perfect) or Individual Sentiments, but those are a country mile outside of my price range.   I've got half a mind to just settle on the DSBs, start saving, and call it a day. I know they were just on sale, but I don't have the budget for it at the moment, and the sale wasn't huge enough to justify violating my budget.    One pair of chunky chelsea or zip boots I used to think I wanted something from Story et Fall, but now I'm convinced I want something more substantial. I'm still deciding on color, but a dark and relatively thick sole is important, so no SLP or anything like that.  Front-runners are:     Mr. Hare Toussaint (just missed these at $262 and kinda regret it) or Sonny RL Our Legacy Cuban Boot (gotta look for these used...made by Sanders, though.) Sanders And even though they totally violate the rule, I'm still intrigued by these MMM sidezips, though I'm guessing they'd be disapponting in person.   ...and other than that, I'm still looking.

goodyearwelt,3dr1ex,Lost_boy_,5,Sat Jul 18 18:22:37 2015 UTC,"That's usually the logic I go through before making a move on most stuff. Yeah I have impulse moments but for the most part I'd like to think I'm pretty reasonable. What it comes down to is I have a kind of 'budget' for purchases such as clothing, footwear, anything I don't need really. I won't let myself consider it if it's really going to put me out after my other expenses. As far as sacrifices go, given that I have allowed myself to consider it usually means that I know that it's really not going to put me out if I go for it. So any sacrifices made would fall into the same ""I don't really need this"" category and therefore wouldn't make a large difference on my standard of living. I then ask if I would get as much enjoyment and use out of that thing over the things I would be putting on hold. If not then no worries, I'll pass. Lastly, my weeks are generally filled with work and class from morning until night, so I think in some way I can justify some superfluous purchases given that I ask myself the right questions and keep these purchases within the 'budget' that I set for myself. Buying the Lindricks would definitely mean no Carmina GMTO but I might be ok with that.   Damn, that got way more long-toothed than I expected. I appreciate you forcing me to think logically though"
goodyearwelt,3dr1ex,akaghi,5,Sat Jul 18 18:35:29 2015 UTC,"It's what I do.  I usually mull over large purchases for a month or more. If I still want then, it moves into the yes category. Then I just need to budget for it."
goodyearwelt,3dr1ex,Vystril,3,Sat Jul 18 19:49:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I like to do that too.  But then things like somewhat unique GMTOs show up without much time to mull them over (I'm looking at you viberg alternative district!). :("
goodyearwelt,3dr1ex,akaghi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:01:36 2015 UTC,"What's the Viberg?  I definitely did that with the Rider shell Dundalks, but I tend to use that plan more abstractly.  Like: am I still into shoes after a year? Okay, I can justify a $200 book on shoes.  And not so much, have I been lusting after X makeup for a year?  For the riders, I hadn't bought any shoes yet this year and was opting against Nick's for various reasons. The NEOC WF was a total impulse, but the price was good and I could use another handsewn. Olive was hard to turn down. Plus Greg is awesome.  With the Viberg sample sale someone messaged me asking if anyone proxied me anything and basically told me they were getting me boots and knew I liked the tan horsehide, but if there was anything else that interested me."

Trickers x Super Denim Shell Cordovan in either cotto or burgundy Brooklyn Clothing Co Viberg Colour 8. Trying to get confirmation on whether it's a commando sole or Dainite sole... BCC has been known to have inaccurate descriptions and I really don't want a commando sole. Carmina GMTO - Really excited to see the options, hoping before the Trickers preorder is up as that will effect my decision. Hearing rumours of a Viberg shell releasing this fall so wait for that.   I love the trickers shell in Burgundy and it's probably my favourite of the bunch with the Viberg No.8's being my 2nd favourite but I probably won't choose both of those being that they are so similar in colour."
goodyearwelt,3dr1ex,Micrafone_AssAssin,3,Sat Jul 18 17:33:04 2015 UTC,I would say go for the Trickers in burgundy over the Vibergs no doubt.  Isn't Trickers x SD doing a pre-order for all their shell boots right now too?

goodyearwelt,3dr1ex,Micrafone_AssAssin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:35:31 2015 UTC,"IMO it's a much more coherent and better styled version of a burgundy boot than the color 8 Viberg service boot.  I've always disliked most brogue captoes for work boots (especially Cxl) but the Viberg color 8 in Cxl is the only one that flys for me.  Either way... the shell with the reverse welt and straight cap is better in just about every way, and worth that price.  Idk if Viberg is worth their retail, regardless of whether or not people are willing to pay for it."
goodyearwelt,3dr1ex,grizzly_giant,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:38:28 2015 UTC,I'm so impatient though. The idea of waiting till October kills me and I like paying and receiving within the week. I also have slight concerns with sizing as I've never had a pair in this last before and I know the bergs will fit perfect. That being said I don't think I can pass on the burgundy shell. Will be my first pair of shell in my favourite colour. I think I'll put my order in tonight.
goodyearwelt,3dr1ex,Micrafone_AssAssin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:45:33 2015 UTC,"October isn't that bad of a wait for these boots, perfect in time for fall I'd say.    Sizing is huge though.  I'd say find somewhere like STP that sells boots in that last with free shipping/returns and order a couple and see how which is best.  As someone with a ton of sizing issues, I can tell you for a boot like these shell trickers, having the sizing nailed down will make you so much happier.  Very worth it even if you have to pay like 20-30 for shipping costs.  That's awesome, can't wait to see how they look!"
goodyearwelt,3dr1ex,calvinari,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:53:23 2015 UTC,whether it's a commando sole or dainite sole   Are you meaning the ItsHide soles (heard them referred to as commando) or an actual lugged sole? I was in there two weeks ago when I bought my brown cxl service boots and all of their bergs looked to have dainite soles. I have seen some of their online images with ItsHide though.
goodyearwelt,3dr1ex,grizzly_giant,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:31:46 2015 UTC,Yes. I was referring to itshide. Some of their listings say dainite and others say commando so I was assuming it would be different. Great to know its dainite though. Thanks for the info!

goodyearwelt,3dr1ex,ghosty06,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:24:36 2015 UTC,PTB makeup is one of my grailed   Just curious why?  The detroit isn't the most flattering of their lasts and I think it'll be tricky for those with normal or thinner widths.
goodyearwelt,3dr1ex,figwitfan,2,Sat Jul 18 19:01:08 2015 UTC,"I think the Detroit last works great for what a PTB fills in a rotation. I have a couple of their sleeker lasts, such as a Simpson and Rain shoe. I don't have a PTB, so the shoe fills a hole for my business casual needs. The less sleek shape of the shoe gives it a prominently more casual feel. I also like Carmina's work more than my other options in the range.   The Detroit last can be tricky for sizing, since it is already one of Carmina's wider lasts. Even then, they only offer an even wider version, but not a more narrow version. I have played around with Carmina lasts enough, that I have a good idea of what size I'd need, but I am acknowledging it will be a looser fit than my other Carmina shoes."
goodyearwelt,3dr1ex,ghosty06,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:11:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed on all points and sounds like you know your sizing.  I'm just a bit worried if this gets picked in the gmto, a lot of people could size incorrectly.  I'm pretty surprised this is one of the top picks for the gmto because it's been offered on skoat for so long.   I could be wrong and maybe they won't offer it in the future."
goodyearwelt,3dr1ex,cobashk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:15:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, skoak has been out of stock forever on those. I remember getting my pair through a third party back in August and there were only like two pairs left on Skoak. Patrik on SF (Leaves) has said a few times on the affiliate thread that they don't know the next time they'll get any shell.   I'm a big fan of the Detroit last for casual shoes. It fits my wide toes pretty comfortably too, so I've wound up with the LWBs and 3-eyelet chukkas on it as well. For anyone who is trying to figure out sizing, Detroit is very wide- my 7 UK pairs are about as wide as 8 UK Hiro last in the toe and heel, although Hiro has a higher instep at that size. Detroit is definitely wider in the toe than any Carmina last other than Llubi."

With my new job I probably won't have many instances to wear these, so I think I'm going to hold off on these for a while.   With the recent acquisition of the taupe suede PTD's and my brown service boots, I rounded out my mostly black footwear (and one white sneaker) line up substantially.  I'm extremely content at this point tbh and as far as number of main options I have to wear, I'm more than satisfied.

The reason why it fell through for me... First questions I asked them was ""are you able to accommodate split sized boots?"" to which their answer was yes. Because if it was anything else obviously I would not have organized the whole order. After all the details were ironed out and everything set to go, I email them to discuss my sizing. I mention the split sizing thing and they say ""Oh no we will not do that for a GMTO, only a mto"". Basically I gave them some shit, cited their first email, and they chalked it up to ""miscommunication"" which I think is horseshit.   They just got me to get 6 orders for them and then said yea too bad basically. So...

Mine are the skinny fit, so I can't help as much with sizing, but JB's tend to be tighter in the top block so sizing up over Levi's was probably smart.

That said, since you are just starting you buy dress shoes, it's up to you on your direction. One mistake a lot of people do when starting is to dive in too quick. Getting 2 calf shoes to start, to get a good rotation of shoes would be smart, but the problem is rushing in to quick.   This isn't really answering your question directly, but I suggest that since you have 0 dress shoes so far, you should get 2 shoes so you can actually rotate them at work. However, you should think very hard about what those shoes will be and if you will still enjoy them down the road, whether you end up getting a shoe in calf or shell."

I really like my RM Williams, and I'm itching for another pair from a different brand + suede for variety. Never owned suede before.   I have my eye on a pair of Meermins but would love some more recs. I know about RM, Story Et Fall, Scarosso, Meermin, Carmina. Ideally, my budget is around $200 USD.   Also, anyone have pictures of Meermins Snuff Suede? Every picture I see the suede is a slightly different color or hue. Also is the Meermin snuff suede always Rapello Snuff Suede or is that a specific one? Such a simple question but googling isn't helping me here."

They'll send swatches if it's a stock fabric if you're unsure.   Even though the prices for outerwear or shoes are high, they're really not bad in the scheme of things. There are a handful of coats I'd love.  Even better for people like me (and maybe you? You are a 7.5 right? Are you also short?) Where everything is always too long, or with weirdly shaped bodies.

Basically, I have gotten some fungus/mold in my iron Rangers a couple times. It generally happens when I wear them for long hours (like over 14), for multiple days in a row. I have noticed that this only happens as well when I do use a shoe tree. Mine is cedar wood and should absorb moisture, but maybe I should let my boots air out over night first? Has anyone had this experience/can help with this issue? I dont think my feet are overly sweaty either, but maybe they are?"
goodyearwelt,3dqkij,babyhands1,2,Sat Jul 18 16:21:54 2015 UTC,"Yep this is where you ask simple questions!  I had this happen to me a few times with some footwear I owned, it's a simple fix and things to remember so it doesn't happen again.  You should get some white vinegar, dilute it (however much you want, doesn't really matter bc sometimes I don't even dilute), put it on a cloth and go into your boot to wipe it down. Undoing the laces helps your reach.  Then get a damp cloth and go in and re-wipe the area so that you're removing some of the residual vinegar.  Then get a dry cloth and wipe around.  Make sure you hit all the mold in the toe box though, or else it'll come back.  Just look in with a flashlight or something.  From now on when you come home after a long day, let your boots air out for a few hours first.  I will normally take my shoes/boots off right when I get into the house, let them sit for a few hours while I work out or something, and then once I'm done I put the shoe trees back in.  If you put the trees in right after, it traps all the moisture in the toe box and doesn't let it escape.  The wood can only absorb so much, and I wouldn't be surprised if you see some mold on the trees as well (I did).  Letting them air out a bit should stop the mold from growing."

I have this stuff called mycomist that i put on a paper towel and wipe down the boot with, though I have heard white vinegar works well (as you have experienced). Thanks for the response!"
goodyearwelt,3dqkij,babyhands1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:07:19 2015 UTC,"I just recently picked up a pair of Wolverine 1k's for really cheap but I'm unsure as to whether it's a good fit. I read the fit guide and the widest part of my foot aligns with the widest part of the boot, but I find that I have a decent amount of toe room left. Is this normal for 1ks? For reference I bought a pair in size 9, and I wear a 9.5 in Vans, 10 Nikes, 9 in dress shoes and 9 in CDB's.  Edit: Might note that it's sold out everywhere I got it from, so I can't exchange it for a smaller size. It's either keep them or return them at this point."
goodyearwelt,3dqkij,Monk3y19,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:24:45 2015 UTC,That is usually what people say. I know you can go up a width and size down another half
goodyearwelt,3dqkij,ArtofExpression,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:29:28 2015 UTC,"How much room in the toe? 1k's, IR's, and Beckmans are considered (or at least modeled after) ""work boots."" So generally speaking there will be a bit of room in the toe, but you shouldn't be swimming in them."
goodyearwelt,3dqkij,Lost_boy_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:32:42 2015 UTC,Depends how much you mean by a decent amount of toe room but yes it is normal to have a bit of room in the toe. if you aren't having much heel slip and it's comfortable to walk you are probably good to go. How much did you size down from Brannock?

WSAYWT viberg olive guidi service boots   GD win an auction for a pair of lightly used meermin dark brown oxfords for $80 and stocked up on some new shoe trees. $85 for 6 wasn't too bad at nordstrom rack.   Headed into DC to see the fake beach in a museum.

goodyearwelt,3dqkij,Immiscible,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:10:24 2015 UTC,"AOTD:  Oh boy.... choosing one for the summer?  That'll be tough.  Here's a few from different genre's I've dug so far this summer:   Bermuda - Kisses  Easy going. Lost - Frank Ocean Uhh Frankie baby... a living legend among mortals.  Can't wait for his new album. Research - Big Sean Hah don't judge me but this song is a jam when driving. Outside is the Right Side - Pond This whole album is fantastic. Sunshoweres - M.I.A. While I'm not a huge fan of her music normally, this is from her first album and is pretty neat.  Doesn't sound like anything else I listen to either, so that's fun. Smuckers - Tyler the Creator Also not normally a fan of Tyler but his recent album has some good songs.  Fuckin' Young is hilarious, he's such a clown. Judo Chop Freestyle - Riff Raff aka Jody Highroller Haha I love/hate Riff Raff so much.  Ignorant af is all that needs to be said about this song. Dream - Young Thug #FreeThugger, this album has grown on me a lot.  As something in /r/hhh put it, it's a ""slow burner"" The Valley Wind - Tyler Ramsey Loved this album last year and just recently picked it up again. Tough to find streams online, but it's on Spotify.   GD: So happy with those taupe suede PTD's, they really grew on me a lot.  Also starting my new job tomorrow morning so that's fun, got so much to do between that and getting 20 secondaries done for med school apps -_- see ya never."

goodyearwelt,3do5gg,M3tatron,13,Fri Jul 17 21:30:52 2015 UTC,"I was in Barcelona for a couple of days so I naturally went to visit Carmina. I walked in with an open mind expecting to buy something but nothing specific. These boots looked incredible on the shelf. It had a darkish green color, but when I tried them on near a window the sunlight made the green stand out. I can't remember exactly the reason but I think the boots were made for a grand-opening or anniversary of the Barcelona store.      Model: 80092 Balmoral Captoe Boot Size: 8 UK Leather: Loden Green Shell Cordovan Last: Robert Sole: Rendenbach     I've been wearing them for two weeks now to break them in. I took a size 8 UK which fit a bit tight but comfortable. The Robert last is quite narrow which added to the snugness. They are solidly built and lightweight.   I'm a bit worried about versatility. Otherwise, they look beautiful and I am extremely happy to have gotten them (even though they took up 25 percent of my suitcase space for the way back home). It's my first pair of shell boots so I can't wait to see how it ages, especially curious to see how loden ages."
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,Neurophil,6,Fri Jul 17 21:31:13 2015 UTC,what was the cost?
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,feylanks,5,Fri Jul 17 23:05:14 2015 UTC,I paid exactly 735 euros. Which is the same price for the other balmoral boots such as the cognac and navy ones.
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,Madrun,9,Sat Jul 18 00:09:26 2015 UTC,"Forget versatility, Rock the shit out of those"
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,Vystril,10,Sat Jul 18 00:13:36 2015 UTC,"Wow, the depth of color in the green is incredible. Not sure how versatile it is, but damn that makes me want a pair"
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,akaghi,4,Fri Jul 17 22:18:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not sure about the versatility, but damn it's pimping.  I feel like you'd need to have a nice cane to go along with them. :)  I do really like that last fit pic though, nice and casual."
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,Vystril,4,Fri Jul 17 22:20:29 2015 UTC,"I can't fathom the number of shoes I'd need to own before this became a viable option.  It's pretty, though."
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,akaghi,3,Fri Jul 17 23:08:05 2015 UTC,"I don't know.  I feel like I basically have a boot or shoe in natural/whiskey/walnut, brown, burgundy and black basics, not to mention blue suede.  So I guess that just leaves green."
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,Neurophil,2,Fri Jul 17 23:26:54 2015 UTC,And carmina's Ruby shell.
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,Vystril,3,Fri Jul 17 23:54:48 2015 UTC,here's a pic of a ruby shell monk that I took to convince you you do need this /u/Vystril   and a navy shell wholecut brogue for good measure
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,Neurophil,2,Sat Jul 18 00:14:50 2015 UTC,"here's a pic of a ruby shell monk that I took to convince you you do need this /u/Vystril   You know, that picture makes me think that my Carmina shell wholecuts are actually ruby and not burgundy.  So I might have that base covered. :)   and a navy shell wholecut brogue for good measure   I do need some navy shell in my life.  I'd love a navy shell frankenstitch or jumper... or wingtip boot."
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,Vystril,3,Sat Jul 18 00:22:40 2015 UTC,way too red to be burgundy. I'd bet money those are ruby shell
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,Neurophil,2,Sat Jul 18 00:30:06 2015 UTC,Yeah I think so too.  So I dodged a bullet there!
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,UUBBBRR,5,Sat Jul 18 00:33:55 2015 UTC,But now you need burgundy shell
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,thatisgrossman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:41:04 2015 UTC,I would love a navy frankenstitch. I'm hoping a navy or natty shell frankenstitch happens for the gmto. It doesn't seem like many people really want navy though.
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,Vystril,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:44:15 2015 UTC,Those are definitely ruby (color 2). I have the color 8 ones and they are much darker. So jealous.
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,Vystril,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:27:58 2015 UTC,"Awesome, that makes them even cooler. :)"
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,akaghi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:34:37 2015 UTC,I think these might be ruby...  I got them used so not quite sure.  They're definitely redder than my other burgundy shell.
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,Vystril,2,Sat Jul 18 00:23:51 2015 UTC,Get some stingray.
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,akaghi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:32:46 2015 UTC,"I think I'd rather do some lizard, croc or alligator before stingray.  I think it'd be more versatile.  Although these are really cool.  But I think now bison and kudu are probably the 'exotics' I'm most interested in.  I'd love to do a kudu galway (if that's even possible)... And the thing I'm most jealous of at the moment are these mountain ram thorpes."
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,Vystril,2,Sat Jul 18 00:43:06 2015 UTC,"Carmina had/has a really lovely lizard shoe I was looking at recently. It s brown and very subtle for an exotic.   The stingray facing shoe is really interesting. Really nice pattern work there.  The ram looks like a badass version of bison. Kudu OK s great too, of course."
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,DrTommyNotMD,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:18:32 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of two minds when it comes to lizard.  Part of me would want it to be subtle so I could wear it more often and have it be more versatile, but the other part of me would want it to scream ""look at these awesome lizard boots/shoes!"" and be all gaudy (like a green lizard chelsea or something like that).  I'm pretty torn in that regard. :)"
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,Vystril,7,Sat Jul 18 01:24:04 2015 UTC,"These are absolutely stunning.  Probably one of the prettiest, most unique pairs of shoes I've seen on this sub.  They'd be really hard to pair, but when they work, damn do they work."
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,DrTommyNotMD,3,Fri Jul 17 23:16:50 2015 UTC,I'd love to see them paired with something like a very light (almost white) linen suit.
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,Micrafone_AssAssin,4,Sat Jul 18 00:25:09 2015 UTC,"A cream linen suit would make an amazing summer wedding outfit, but boots with linen is a bit of clash in seasonal attire."
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,akaghi,3,Sat Jul 18 00:34:48 2015 UTC,"Wow... the color of these is simply gorgeous.  I love the first and last shots with you standing in the green grass.  At a glance I feel these would be hard to pair with, but honestly I bet you could find a lot of pants that would work with these."
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,Vystril,3,Fri Jul 17 22:36:22 2015 UTC,"I have a hard enough time matching anything that isn't dark brown, I'd be totally lost with these boots."
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,Micrafone_AssAssin,3,Fri Jul 17 23:09:04 2015 UTC,I think all the earth tones would be great. Add a matching green belt and you're good to go.
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,akaghi,2,Fri Jul 17 23:37:43 2015 UTC,"Gotta think outside the box!  I'm sure you could pair it well with: denim, navy chinos, certain khaki's/browns, maybe natural?, black potentially but idk."

goodyearwelt,3do5gg,Vystril,3,Fri Jul 17 23:47:47 2015 UTC,"Whoa.  I don't think I need green shoes, but I'm starting to think maybe."
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,darbykp,2,Sat Jul 18 00:20:23 2015 UTC,Hnnng.  I don't have any green footwear and this really makes me want to snag some.  Those are really lovely.  That green is great!  I really love that style balmoral boot with colored shell.
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,cobashk,2,Fri Jul 17 22:05:21 2015 UTC,Those are amazing! I saw the navy ones posted on carmina's IG and was blown away. There's something really cool about bal boots and something even more cool about green bal boots.
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,cbtaylor23,2,Fri Jul 17 23:49:35 2015 UTC,"Absolutely bonkers. They're dark enough to be wearable without it being St Patrick's Day, too."
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,Vaeltaja,2,Fri Jul 17 23:57:29 2015 UTC,Holy shit those are beautiful

goodyearwelt,3do5gg,MatterChannel,2,Sun Jul 19 02:56:22 2015 UTC,I lusted after the Rain derbies in the same green shell but they sold out in my size before I finally got ready to purchase them. Gorgeous color. Enjoy them - I don't have any balmoral boots but have always wanted a pair.
goodyearwelt,3do5gg,MatterChannel,2,Sun Jul 19 13:16:21 2015 UTC,Pretty damn jealous. Is there anyway to contact the store and ask for my size?
