You'd just be starting out like you just bought a phone that came with CM 12.1 and you never put a single thing on it yet.

cyanogenmod,3e3icr,jld2k6,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:14:33 2015 UTC,"If you did a factory reset and didn't restore your backup, you would be starting fresh. A normal factory reset won't wipe the contents of your SD cards normally unless you choose to do that manually. Normally people don't do this because they keep things like their pictures and other important things on their SD cards, but you could format those too if you wanted to. The SD card portion on your internal is seperate from the system so you will just be deleting your own files you put there. If you restored your backup, you would just be reverting your phone back to exactly how it was before you did the factory reset. It would effectively make the reset pointless. Recovery backups are literally just taking everything about your phone and freezing it in time. When you restore that backup, every file and setting in your phone will be reverted back to that exact moment when you made the backup. Even all of your texts and phone calls will be there only up until the point when you did the backup."

cyanogenmod,3e3icr,jld2k6,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:31:43 2015 UTC,"A good way to organize and clean up your SD cards is to get ""es file explorer"" from the play store. It has a tool called ""SD card analyst"" that will sort all of the folders on your SD card from biggest to smallest. You can start with the bigger stuff and see what's in there and if you can do without it you can delete it. It's a nice quick way to clear space when needed.   You can also use the app called SD maid to do more powerful cleanup functions but you will want to read exactly what they do before using them since it is a powerful root app."

Before you can do that you have to Flash the Real Stock rom which you can find online via Odin before you put in a custom recovery. Once you put in the custom recovery you can flash CM via recovery.

Clear cache and downgrade, Assuming you have an older update on storage, or reset to default.  As a tip I suggest always creating a flashable backup prior to flashing updates. If the update causes an issue like this you can roll back to your last good config.   I still see so many people create threads because of problems like this. And very few of them make backups. A situation like this is avoidable. Backups literally save hours of frustration and work."

My M8 always boots into recovery if it is off and gets connected to power. ( I don´t know if this is normal) There was no way of downgrading or flashing an other version to get it to work. But luckily i made a backup when i installed CM initially. By restoring this backup i was able to fix my phone. Again thank you! :)

It was just a flashable zip via recovery that contained only instructions to delete every Google related app on the phone. I made note of the contents and tree structure of the gapps zip and simply wrote a custom update script file. Flashing rom updates would cause bugs occasionally and this method saved a lot of time.

cyanogenmod,3doj4h,theworstoftimes415,11,Sat Jul 18 01:05:45 2015 UTC,Currently on CM11 cyanogen. Its terrible. Good for a while but highly unstable. If you do the one click installer you get CM11 which is not an RC. You blow out efuses and can't downgrade. Hate it. If you go with an s3 try the latest RC only. Camera constantly crashes as well. Loves to hang when answering phone calls... Every time you need to do something urgent. 6.5/10
cyanogenmod,3doj4h,thegreatzack,2,Sat Jul 18 01:46:55 2015 UTC,I would have to disagree I'm running a d2spr with (almost the) latest AICP and the only real issue i can complain about is the front camera crashes on stock camera apps. I would recommend an s3 if you would like to go for an old flagship phone.
cyanogenmod,3doj4h,TMGreycoat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:48:37 2015 UTC,"Had the exact same experience on my S4 mini with CM12.1 (although more forgivable since I was on nightlies).   The camera wouldn't work 90% of the time, and when it did it would only take one photo. Recording video drained the battery in 10 minutes. Using location services did the same in 5. Every nightly an issue would be fixed only for 2 more to arise. I'm on stock, and despite the lack of customisation and Lollipop I'm finally content"

cyanogenmod,3doj4h,Isaiaher,3,Sun Jul 19 10:52:36 2015 UTC,I do not recommend the S3. I have an old one I flashed cm11 on and its fine but nowhere close to stable and daily driver worthy in my opinion. I've just had too many problems with it to highly suggest it capable.
cyanogenmod,3doj4h,Sarcism,2,Sat Jul 18 05:41:57 2015 UTC,CM on S3 is trash tier. Used it for about 2 months and ended up flashing Slimkat ROM.

cyanogenmod,3dobw0,Livin_La_Vida_Quokka,5,Fri Jul 17 22:22:55 2015 UTC,"Mainly because Replicant is made by one guy, while getting help sometimes from others. CyanogenMod is extremely big project in comparison. Most devices have file named blobs.txt or proprietary-files.txt in their cyanogenmod repository.  Also, I think many consider Replicant project not worth effort, cause android bootloader is still proprietary, whats the point of going full libre. Though I like the idea. Dunno why you are downvoted, imo its important question."
cyanogenmod,3dobw0,Roshless,2,Sat Jul 18 00:58:37 2015 UTC,"Exactly, its an interesting project. You could argue its ""forking for the sake of forking"", as many linux distros and other open source things are facing. But in this cae I feel like the more open source code there is the better. Closed source code is not as useful in blob format as if it was out in the open. Aside from the obvious privacy concerns related to running executables without knowing or trusting the code, there is the question that with open source code, you could arguably do a hell of a lot more as far as little tweaks or modifications. I don't know, just food for thought. I haven't heard about Replicant yet but I hope the project grows."
cyanogenmod,3dobw0,Grippentech,3,Sat Jul 18 03:23:29 2015 UTC,"CyanogenMod requires proprietary per-device libraries. It doesn't really have an inherent requirement for proprietary code, but there aren't yet any devices where it's not the case.  Replicant doesn't have proper support for any devices, only half-working support for a few. It does run without proprietary code, which is more than can be said for CyanogenMod. You won't have things like OpenGL though..."

cyanogenmod,3dot7z,Remo_253,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:55:44 2015 UTC,The installer installs a somewhat older version of cm11 from August and at this point (especially if you've already got a custom recovery) it's much easier/better to either use the built in updater to get the latest on your branch or manually update to e.g. cm12.1 nightlies. Also the installer would have wiped everything when installing its version and you wouldldn't have been able to go forward to nightlies from there without another wipe.   I upgraded from cm11m12 to a 12.1 nightly a few months ago on d2tmo (the unified d2lte was split back apart after cm11) and it's been fine since.
cyanogenmod,3dot7z,PsychoI3oy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:14:49 2015 UTC,"Tried using the upgrader, didn't work. Hung on ""rebooting"", just sat there.   One of the issues I was hoping an upgrade would fix is the inability to turn it off. It says it's shutting down but just hangs there. I have to pull the battery. Apparently whatever causes that also is preventing it from rebooting.  Curiosity question, there were 5 updates listed, I chose the newest. Do they have to be done in order??  I'm going to try with Odin and the latest build next."
cyanogenmod,3dot7z,PsychoI3oy,2,Sat Jul 18 05:35:19 2015 UTC,"all CM builds are full installs, you don't have to install any previous versions.   Odin is for installing factory images; all cyanogenmod zips should be installed through a custom recovery like clockworkmod, twrp, or cyanogen simple recovery.   note that if you use google apps and are moving between major android versions you will need to find updated gapps."

cyanogenmod,3dhslk,wfoed559,2,Thu Jul 16 11:30:16 2015 UTC,"CM doesn't do stable builds. They only do Snapshots now. Difference is that a snapshot isn't assumed or guaranteed to be bug-free, it just has relatively few bugs (and no major ones) compared to nightlies and other builds, so is safer to use.  The first snapshot will come when it's ready, the team goes through waves of fast development vs bug fixing, so it'll come out after they clean up some bugs, but nobody really knows when that will be."

Snapshots are the same as M-Builds, which are meant to be monthly builds that are as stable as possible. That being said, when we do a call to maintainers about m-builds they have to respond on the readiness of their device builds to be included. If there is no response or they give a no-go, then an m-build is not released for that device."

Cm downloader has a couple extra features that aren't exactly needed but save you a couple presses here and there if you want to use them.  It has like auto backup etc which will probably be helpful if I flash a bad nightly. It also will delete the old backups after x days etc.  Perhaps the fact that it's actively developed means we'll see more features.

Two good phones which are easy to get CM12.1 up and running on:  If you truly don't expect to need mobile service, get a Moto G (2014) (it doesn't have LTE). You get a decently spec'd android with a pretty good display and front facing stereo speakers. You can add a 32 gig microSD card for music and video.

cyanogenmod,3cy5w5,joshnoodle98,3,Sat Jul 11 21:07:27 2015 UTC,How do rom developers make there roms without bricking a ton of phones? They must make mistakes that break things sometimes.  And is there any way to fix a bricked phone? Can you plug it into a PC and reflash everything?
cyanogenmod,3cy5w5,Ninja_Fox_,8,Sun Jul 12 00:07:43 2015 UTC,As long as you can boot into recovery and restore a backup the phone is not really bricked.
cyanogenmod,3cy5w5,cat_in_the_ass,2,Sun Jul 12 00:15:20 2015 UTC,Is the recovery mode separated from the os? How likely am I to fuck it up?  I would love to play with this stuff and find out how it all works but I'm too scared that I will ruin hundreds of dolers of hardware.   On a desktop the bios is totally separate to the os so no matter how bad I fuck up I will never brick the computer.
cyanogenmod,3cy5w5,Ninja_Fox_,4,Sun Jul 12 00:29:37 2015 UTC,"Unlike the BIOS the recovery is not responsible for preparing the hardware for the OS to load (that's what the bootloader does).   The thing that a recovery is responsible for is making sure that you always have a minimal OS that allows you to flash ROMs and recover without using a PC.   You can overwrite the recovery partition, however on many devices there is a ""fastboot"" or ""download"" mode that allows you to flash a new recovery from your PC (if you manage to screw up that badly, which I personally never have)."
cyanogenmod,3cy5w5,cat_in_the_ass,2,Sun Jul 12 07:33:06 2015 UTC,So with fastboot even if I cleared every file off the device I could still fix it with my pc? That sounds alright.
cyanogenmod,3cy5w5,Ninja_Fox_,3,Sun Jul 12 07:38:01 2015 UTC,"yes, boot into fastboot and you can reflash recovery, kernel etc. and if you can reflash recovery, you can do everything from there.   i've flashed a hundreds of times, got bootlooped a few times, got unresponsive once, but fastboot worked every time on every device i worked with and you're up again in five minutes.   allthough i believe you could really burn the device and got it destroyed somehow (there is a way for everything ;) but the whole buzz about bricking the devices is overblown. if you read the wiki, if you care what you're doing, if you visit xda occasionally, you won't blow anything. there are people who think cyanogenmod is just another theme apk so they will install it today and uninstall it the next day just like game from a play store. but it isn't like that, they go into some sort of trouble and then scream around ""i've bricked it"" although there is a way to restore recovery or just reflash the correct zips and boot it again. but from that lazy ass kind of panic, the community have the buzz about bricking is so easy and often.   im kinda sure there are people who end up in a bootloop because they mixed the zips they flashed and call that a bricking.   you have to be dumb to brick it and have it unrecoverable.   just read the wiki, go step by step, mind what you're doing and it will be okay."
cyanogenmod,3cy5w5,rzlatic,2,Sun Jul 12 08:14:41 2015 UTC,That's awesome news. For years I have been scared to touch Android. I was even stressing out using the easy install thing for CM.   Guess I'm gonna play with everything and find out how this all works.  Just one more question. Do all devices have fast boot? I have a nexus 7 and a galaxy s5.
cyanogenmod,3cy5w5,Ninja_Fox_,3,Sun Jul 12 08:31:29 2015 UTC,"most often its power + vol down and plug the usb in.  be sure to have android sdk on your pc. here, the nice resource http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2277112  keep in mind that flashing roms isn't about fastboot so much ;) you're mostly using the recovery (twrp or cwm) while fastboot is rarely seen. have a happy flashing, its endless fun :)"
cyanogenmod,3cy5w5,rzlatic,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:43:52 2015 UTC,"Well... kinda. If you through some act of magic manage to wipe the bootloader it will be necessary to open the device and flash a new one buy connecting directly to the storage chip.   I have never heard of anyone who managed to accidentally wipe the bootloader. The only way I have ever seen someone do it is by intentionally running the ""fastboot erase bootloader"" command."

cyanogenmod,3cy5w5,aww-yisss,6,Sun Jul 12 10:42:06 2015 UTC,"The worst thing that could possibly happen from Installing Cyanogenmod, is your phone bootloops, so you'll have to reboot into your recovery through the use of your hardware buttons and restore a backup to get your phone back to normal. I can't think of a way that flashing a ROM will brick your phone. If you mess up while installing your Custom Recovery, which is a prerequisite for installing CM (Cyanogenmod), there is a tiny chance your could brick your phone. I've installed custom recoveries on about 15 different devices in the last 2 years and have never bricked one. Make sure you follow the instructions and ask someone if you don't understand a step and always make sure your device model matches the model from the instructions. You'll never have a problem if you follow those steps."

cyanogenmod,3cy5w5,billysea99,5,Sun Jul 12 04:07:36 2015 UTC,Basically the worst that can happen is your phone goes in an infinite loop because you forgot something or you broke your warranty. What phone you rooting BTW?

cyanogenmod,3cy5w5,spaghetti_emissary,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:38:58 2015 UTC,"There are generally two steps you need to follow.  1) install custom recovery. This is the rooting process, more or less. You put your phone in a really low level mode and push some files to it. Do not fuck this up. You only ever have to do this once.  2) install operating system, etc, through the custom recovery program. This you almost cannot screw up, it's pretty robust, and you can always just reboot back into custom recovery to reformat and reinstall.  The only real critical part her is #1. As long as you can boot your phone into the low level mode where it waits for files over the USB cable (for me, hold home, power, and down volume), then you have full working control over your device."
cyanogenmod,3cy5w5,TNSGT,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:31:57 2015 UTC,"I can't stress it enough to use websites like XDA to fully understand the process before proceeding. It's boring and it takes time to go over it but everyone really should do it.  You need to know exactly what phone model you're using, what software you're on, and the firmware you're running to determine if the ROM you want is compatible with the phone you have. These factors can take you down different paths, for instance I had to flash an updated firmware to jump up to CM12 from Sense 6 on Android 4.4. New firmware can mean achieving S-Off, or flashing an RUU that would contain said firmware. That can begin leading to things like using ADB, which is simple enough but can be daunting for the first time user.  It's unlikely you're at any real risk of completely bricking your device, but there can be a lot of steps involved in flashing a new ROM, and a few missteps can result in bootloops, soft-bricking, crashes etc and it's imperative that you know how to react to these scenarios. That's where you're more likely to totally brick your device. Installing a new ROM isn't as simple as booting up Windows for the first time; a little bit more research and/or patience is needed I'm afraid.  Try and avoid all-in-one installers because they're essentially automating the process of voiding your warranty. It's like handing over the keys of your car to someone without a licence, and hoping they don't crash it.  One more note, please try and provide a lot more information to the community when you come asking for advice. Your device make/model/software make a huge difference with what advice the community can possibly give you."

cyanogenmod,3cvmxm,LimblessWonder,6,Sat Jul 11 04:05:16 2015 UTC,"Yes! Me too! I woke up this morning, a half an hour after I was supposed to be at work, all because my phone had powercycled and was stuck on the boot-up splash screen. Ergo my alarm didn't go off.  Had to hard reset anyway, had enough of Touchwiz at this point, figured I might as well finally flash cm12.1 on, and have been LOVING it so far.   I've had cm12 flashed on my old Note 2 for quite a while now, seemed to use the phone more than the S5 before today.  So happy.  Do it!!!  You'll take a slight hit on camera quality and maybe battery life but the overall experience is well worth it. AOSP (and CM in particular) is just so much better than TW, even as much as it has improved, to give Samsung SOME credit. =D   No need for an S6 as tempting as it was. Love my S5 I feel like I got a new phone today.  Admittedly you do lose the fingerprint scanner but android m and cm13(?) should solve that as fingerprint scanners are being built into the OS system wide."

cyanogenmod,3cvmxm,obeseclown,3,Sat Jul 11 21:20:17 2015 UTC,Great! Battery life was one thing I was worried about. Battery life is terrible on my nexus7 but that's because of a bug in cm11.

cyanogenmod,3cvmxm,jmonday7814,2,Sat Jul 11 04:18:45 2015 UTC,"You're the guy I need to talk. Just picked up a used S5 on Craigslist on updated it to Lollipop. I didn't know at the time that TowelRoot only worked for KitKat prior to June 2014 so i can't root it. I found the firmware to flash back to KitKat but when I put the phone into download mode Odin won't recognize it so now I'm stuck.  If you could please provide me the links to every step you did, I'd live to get CM on the S5."
cyanogenmod,3cvmxm,LimblessWonder,2,Sat Jul 11 21:55:07 2015 UTC,I can try to help but I'm no expert.  I used This as a rooting guide   And this to install CM   A couple things I read over and over was to use a usb 2.0 cable as apparently odin doesn't play well with the 3.0 and to make sure that you have Samsung USB driver.  Another thing is that the rooting guide links to a version of SuperSU that won't work on lollipop. I learned this the hard way and had to flash Samsungs stock android onto the phone and start over. If you're on lollipop grab the latest beta of SuperSU from xda forums.  Otherwise I followed the tutorials exactly. Definitely do a backup first.  I hope this helps

cyanogenmod,3cvmxm,ClutchExperience,2,Sat Jul 11 05:15:25 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure im gonna go with CM but I have a few other questions.   How should I install it? Last time I used the app on my laptop and tablet to do it but that only works with windows and I dont feel like digging up an old windows laptop again to install it. Is there any way to do it on linux? I also saw on the play store there was a thing called clockwork rom manager. Is this any use?  Also is it possible to completely ruin my phone beond repare with roms? I know installing one by following the guides is pretty safe but I like to tinker with things and find out how they work. I am pretty confident doing this on my desktop because I can always reinstall if things go wrong but playing with andoid kind of scares me because I don't want to brick my phone and leave it unusable. If I do mess something up and leave my phone unbootable it is possible to just wipe everything off and start fresh?
cyanogenmod,3cvmxm,_taijitu_,2,Sat Jul 11 10:27:41 2015 UTC,Been on cm12( and 12.1) since the first builds. Always stable and snappy. Latest nightly is great. :)  MUCH better than Touchwiz.

It is very similar to CM and they only release weekly, at most. You would have to check to see if they have a version for your device."
cyanogenmod,3cnz3a,noahsark3,5,Thu Jul 9 11:54:56 2015 UTC,I find PA to have much fewer features with all the same bugs.  Personally I wouldn't recommend switching.

cyanogenmod,3cnz3a,0x0001111,2,Thu Jul 9 14:15:19 2015 UTC,Don't clear the cache. You'll still have to wait sometimes; it depends on what's been updated. It's 50/50 in my experience.
cyanogenmod,3cnz3a,celluj34,4,Thu Jul 9 14:18:07 2015 UTC,I find it doesn't make a difference when I dirty flash.  It still has to optimize the apps.  But like others have said...I try to do it when I don't really need my phone.  I mean to do it at night but usually forget.

cyanogenmod,3cnz3a,linux_noob_,2,Thu Jul 9 17:56:41 2015 UTC,"Don't think so. The brightness changes according to ambient light levels once you are done with last app optimization and when it says ""Android is starting up"". Before that it stays at the default boot brightness of about 80% (I think)? Didn't find a way to decrease that. May be boot up parameters if your bootloader supports it.

Notice however that during that time other devices did still get their respective nightlies (which means it must have been some OPO-specific problem).

My android wear device will frequently disconnect / reconnect.  Several times an hour, some times! sometimes, pairing / unpairing of a BT headset will either crash the phone or FC the bluetooth sharing service.  This appears to have gotten better, lately. Randomly, BT will just stop working.  If i am not listening to music, I dont notice.  The only fix is to restart the phone.  Some times, the phone will still have BT disabled after a reboot.  Turning BT on will immediately crash the phone.  At the end of the second reboot, things usually work. I consider myself BLESSED when i am able to listen to audio over BT w/o issue for more than a few min.  Typically, BT Audio will randomly lag, stutter for a few seconds every few min unless WiFi is also in active use... then the BT audio is literally continuously choppy.  This means streaming music is impossible.  Playing back downloaded content is bearable if you can tollerate every few seconds of audio being mangled.  I suspect that the WiFi and BT radios share the same antenna, but the driver that's supposed to make sure that both radios don't interfere with one another is not working.    I have no idea how to bring these issues to the attention of the phone's maintainer.  I was hoping that the recent OEM 5.1.1 firmware images would be disected so the updated drivers could be used in the CM 5.1.1 builds.... but so far, this does not seem to be the case."

I tried several of the newer nightly builds and there were too many issues (mostly just couldn't get phone/data/etc, and just general issues that have been described here before).  If there was a stable build for the S4 I'd possibly use it, but I ended up giving up and just went to SlimLP which has been fucking baller - They did an amazing job IMO, but I cant compare it to cyanogen because I have little experience actually using it..  I really wanted to use cyanogen because of all the hype and because it looks great - but on the S4 it was just too hard to get working, and I'm not really keen to flash roms once a week (or even once every few months)."

What I will say to you is that while you are free and welcome to use the one-click, the builds that the one-click uses are different from the community builds, and as such are on a MUCH slower release pattern. The one-click builds are still pushing CM11 and not lollipop.

Reboot the recovery via advanced. Perform a factory reset, flash CM version, flash Pico Apps and then clear cache and dalvik cache for good measure. Then reboot the device.

A completely open source version run by community members (Cynanogenmod) and an ""Enterprise"" grade version of the software that is polished for use by phone carriers with support from the company for porting and any issues that occur within the software. Their declaration that they ""want to separate Google from Android"" means they intend to make an application equivalent for everything Android requires Google to fill in. Clocks, Appstore, Playing Music, Calculators etc etc. This is something that is done over in the Linux world quite often. The Gnome Foundation tries making an application for almost everything as part of their Desktop Suite and nobody gives them shit for it. Cyanogen Inc is trying to create an entirely Open Source platform that gives the same performance as the Gapps equivalents and they get nothing but shit on."

I use it to install firefox, document viewer, adaway, and some other stuff.  I installed amazon app store to get a little bit more apps.  To your question:    for app stores, use the ones I listed above GPS, sync, everything will be fine. You lose wifi based location, tho. This may or may not be a big deal for you. Just means GPS will take longer to lock on (wifi based it locks by querying google's server, and then eventually gps will take over). Major downside:    lack of the play store means a lot of apps may be unavailable. The amazon app store gives you some apps back but it's far from complete. Google apps will be unavailable.  For my tablet the only issue is the lack of the Youtube app, as the web app is far from ideal. I use it anyways as I have no choice. For me personally I don't miss Google apps as I see no reason to use it on my tablet, as it is already shared. If you enjoy things like Google Now or whatever, that might be a big downside for you.    I got rid of Gplay from my tablet but I also want to get rid of it from my phone. Right now the apps that I do use from them are:   Gmail: Need to switch off of Gmail to switch. Built-in email app will become good enough as it gains push. Maps: not sure what has bike routes... Sideloading it without google play services will not work Youtube: Can live with the web app. Certain playstore apps: sideloading... not ideal, not sure what solution I have. Youtube"

cyanogenmod,3bw1t9,PsychoI3oy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:41:11 2015 UTC,Snapshot builds won't show nightly updates and vice versa.   This is to prevent breakage when you are on a nightly and install a snapshot released the next day but actually branched several days prior. Android hates downgrades and tends to crash a lot of things trying to access databases (e.g. all your settings) if you try.
cyanogenmod,3bul60,krautchanner,3,Thu Jul 2 07:29:13 2015 UTC,Use TWRP instead?  https://twrp.me/devices/samsunggalaxytab2101.html

Replaced screen once and the second time I upgraded to a note 4 instead of hassling with performing surgery on it.   Tl;dr: not anything to do with software. It's a common hardware issue."

Rooting simply put means gaining root system level access to the device so you can make changes. Device manufacturers like to lock this out because they don't want users breaking the builds and causing huge headaches. What build are you trying to flash to the device? What Gapps package?"
cyanogenmod,3bqw6e,Stubbo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:38:32 2015 UTC,If there is a feature discussion thread would it be the top voted are taken into consideration or implemented?  Or is it merely a brainstorming session for what could/couldnt be done?  I've got a couple that i'd like to put forward :)

The M8 is not supported by the one-click installer, nor is it going to be added in the near future. This may be why you are hitting the issues you are.  As far as a recovery, I would not use CWM myself, I would use TWRP (if available) as it is updated and active where CWM is a bit stale."

I have a feeling that it has something to do with my computer as well, because I'm running 10.6.8 and I can't get the latest version of Java. So I'm not sure what to do. I feel like I keep running into issues and im positive its my own fault, like the tutorials out on the web aren't working for me, because they say ""do this and you'll get a number"" and I do the thing and terminal doesn't return a number at all. Since Android released the standalone app instead of the toolkit, all of the tutorials are like....not right. I'm considering just hopping on Craig's list and offering 50 bucks to someone in my area to flash it for me. Do you have any tutorial recommendations? I can't for the life of me understand the wiki, the terminology and way its explained is just over my head. Thanks again."

How do I install clockwork mod on my phone? in order to install you need to root, yes?

It installs a custom recovery then installs cm If you already have a custom recovety (i use trwp) i download cm to my phone the reboot into recovery and flash it.

The plan for a final 11.0 and one 12.0 snapshot build was established months ago but stuff happened and things and a lot of work was concentrated on 12.1.   Some maintainers opted to make sure 12.0 was stable on a given device to give it a snapshot, and some were already so deep into 12.1 work that they opted not to. Some devices skipped 12.0 entirely, going from 11.0 weekly to 12.1 nightlies.   It is admittedly a bit of a clusterfuck, jflte* suffering also from the de-unification and new requirements for maintainers to actually own a device they sign off on.   Also 'stable' is no longer used, you'll want to keep an eye out for 'snapshot' releases."

It sounds like I followed a similar guide had no luck getting init.d to run after boot.  In CM12, init.d isn't turned on by default.  There are very few answers on how to turn it on.  The one answer that did work came from @techtrickz.  You can follow his First Method at http://techtrickz.com/how-to/fix-xposed-framework-installation-issue-on-nexus-6/.  Here is what I did:   Download this script by my95z34 from Xda. Extract it and push it to /sdcard/ on your phone. Open a terminal window on the computer your device is connected to and issue the following commands:  adb -s deviceid shell su cd /sdcard/ sh initd.sh  The script will tell you what it is doing while it runs.  Reboot 2-3 times after the initd.sh script ran.   You will find a few new files in /etc/init.d/ on your phone.  00test outputs a file named Test.log to /data/.  I added crond -b -c /data/crontab to that file and cron is now starting at boot.  I hope this helps!"

cyanogenmod,3b8qti,Gjallarhorn331,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:26:41 2015 UTC,"Well, the power your phone consumes needs to go somewhere. And that somewhere is heat. So anything that saves battery will also dissipate less heat.  From my experience it actually makes a noticable difference, to the point my phone litterally freezes during winter when I lower the voltage because the CPU can't keep itself warm enough to function. So either way you can't really lose by doing that: you can only reduce heat even if so slightly, and save battery. The manufacturer sets it way higher to be safe under all conditions (like my winters or more magnetically noisier places) and account for per-chip variations (some chips support under/over volt/clocking better than others)."

cyanogenmod,3b4wm8,corppneq,5,Fri Jun 26 00:14:47 2015 UTC,"AKA “The Phantom Release”  As we look forward to Android M’s release later this year and continue work to integrate the latest from Android 5.1.1_r5 (released yesterday), we are finalizing the branches of CM11.0 and CM12.0. They have seen improved stability and security fixes over the past few months, but little in the way of further development as the focus shifted to CM12.1.  Tonight, the final snapshot releases of both 11.0 and 12.0 are going live – available in sequence as they are built out by our Jenkins instance.  Why another CM11 build? Rather surprisingly, many users have been slow to upgrade to L – whether due to the lack of a snapshot release or adverse reaction to the Material design, we don’t know. The meager stats that we have show that there is a rather large contingency of users who are sticking to CM11 as their release channel of choice, so we felt compelled to give a release showcasing all the work that went into that branch to make it ship ready.  There shouldn’t be any ‘gotchas’ with regards to flashing these builds for CM11 or CM12 users (minus the obligatory warning to make sure your gapps and etc match the Android version you are using). Upgrades should go through without issues, though many 11.0 users updating to 12.0 are advised to update their recoveries as well to ensure that SELinux support doesn’t give you a headache.  12.1 nightly users should not be compelled to downgrade to these releases.  Nightlies and weeklies for 11 and 12.0 branches will be slowly phased out, most likely shut off come M’s entry to nightlies. CM12.1 nightlies will continue as we prepare a release build for 5.1.1 as well (no ETA, sorry).  As always, bug reports can be submitted via our JIRA instance – though in all honesty CM11 issues are unlikely to see massive work, unless they prove to be ultra critical. CM12.0 bugs are fair game, as the code base between 12.0 and 12.1 are similar enough, and the bug likely impacts both branches if present.  Happy Flashing,  The CyanogenMod Team"

I don't need my texting or data or WiFi to get borked at any time, ever. So many important things go through my phone not only on a personal level, but a work level as well.

So if there is a nightly update shown on the phone via the CM Updater, which is the same for all CM12.1, then how do other people's builds send out nightlies that they claim they do?  In other words, are nightlies offered by people on xda must be ""manually"" downloaded from xda forums and the nightlies on the CM Updater are not the same as the ones promised by  the xda builders on their forum threads?

The OS is doing things with root access - after all it's your OS. If Windows Vista/7/8 asks you to run things with administrative rights it is not asking you to have administrative rights for itself, but for a another program.  Before you ""root"" your phone your standard Android is the only thing that has root and decides what can have root - so no apps that you install can have root. If you root your phone you have the ability to grant other apps root - but you don't have to! You can deny or grant root as you see fit. You can set apps to allow or deny it forever, or you can decide to have apps ask for root every time they want it."

Of course CM updates more frequently - they are a bigger team after all - and all in all PA has a different philosophy in that regard. Personally I do like frequent updates and new features regularly, but CM nightlies that made my phone crash or stuck in a bootloop have happened a few times already. It's never that big of a deal to fix and revert, but it's nothing I have encountered with PA (yet).  What I really like about PA is innovative features; they're afaik the first ones that had a global immersive mode, and integrated privacy controls for apps. But CM has integrated a lot of these features now as well, so you should probably try out both and see which one you personally like best."

TWRP is a popular replacement for CWM but Cyanogen recovery will also work, though it lacks a lot of TWRP and CWMs extra features.   As for the actual bootloader, you probably won't have to update that to run newer CM but if it is needed the CM installer file will tell you and error out of installing (look for ""error in updater binary, this file is for bootloader XXX, YYY, ZZZ, and this is QQQ"") and then you can search somewhere like xda-dev for a new bootloader and updating instructions."

cyanogenmod,3aw3s4,schizolingvo,2,Wed Jun 24 20:51:52 2015 UTC,Those nightly struggles.  Reflash yesterday's build if it worked.
cyanogenmod,3aw3s4,silvertondevil,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:21:40 2015 UTC,"""if it worked"", every bit of confidence! just flashed back to the 20th, still had it downloaded... i might be crazy, but i swear some of the first initial releases were a fuck ton more stable than the recent shit. ive only gotten more problems by updating"

cyanogenmod,3avsjk,kbblradio,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:45:49 2015 UTC,Some apps have a setting to have a time felt before actually sending the text. For example I know texted uses that.

cyanogenmod,3avmyl,abletondummy001,3,Tue Jun 23 21:31:14 2015 UTC,I've used https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riteshsahu.SMSBackupRestore with success before. It backs up your SMSes into an XML file you can restore afterwards. I just save it straight to Google Drive.
cyanogenmod,3avmyl,inso22,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:20:25 2015 UTC,Thanks. Perfect app for what I need.
cyanogenmod,3avmyl,xAmorphous,2,Tue Jun 23 22:22:03 2015 UTC,I think titanium backup will do it if you backup the system.

cyanogenmod,3av2sa,rafe101,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:16:08 2015 UTC,"Changing between ROMs is simple once your set up to do it. The procedure will be the same for those others as well. You need a custom recovery on your device to be able to flash zips. I'm guessing this automatic updater attempts to do everything automatically, but I've never used it myself.  Look into how to install either TWRP or CWM. They're the two most common ones and pretty similar as far as features go. Once you have that in place you can try out any custom ROMs. It's just a matter of downloading a zip and installing it in your new recovery. Takes all of a minute or two, from boot to boot."

cyanogenmod,3auymz,tharosbr0,3,Tue Jun 23 18:42:02 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering the same thing. The Nexus 5 and Galaxy Nexus haven't even had a milestone since October.   It's not the worst thing- like, CM M12 is good for everyday use, but it's making me hesitant about using CM in the future. If there won't be updates, what's the point?"
cyanogenmod,3auymz,Burnaby,0,Tue Jun 23 19:01:04 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, the developers said somewhere that they will shift their main focus to CM12, so 11 will get updates very slowly, if at all (given the pace of current 12 snapshot releases at least)"
