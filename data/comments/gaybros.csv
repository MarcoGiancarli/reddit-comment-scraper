Friend drops me off at Starbucks close to where date is supposed to happen. Hang there for like 20 minutes. Walk to restaurant where date happens.  Do not give me a broad time frame for when you will arrive. 12-1 is not acceptable.  Do not still be 30 minutes late.  Do not ask me to order for you because you are going to be late.  Do not then spend the first 20 minutes apologizing for being late. Once is enough, let's actually talk now  Do not proceed to ask me one question, and then spend 20 minutes talking about your answer, only allowing me to talk for 10 seconds at a time.  Especially do not do the above while also having your mouth full of food.  Do not insist that because you paid for food, that I will pay for the movie, before I even get the chance to offer. I know how this works.  Do not... I repeat... DO NOT talk through the movie.  Especially if it's every 5 minutes asking me if I am okay.  Do not offer to take me back to base, and THEN tell me, that you would have to drop me off in front of base, because you have weed in your car.  Especially because the gate is still 7 miles from where I live  AND DO NOT BACKTRACK AND TELL ME THE REASON THAT YOU WERE LATE IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS BECAUSE YOU WERE GOING TO PURCHASE THE WEED.

He then offered to take me to his place to watch a movie. I had already thought about giving it up, so to speak, so I went with it.   When we showed up to his place, he had three of his friends there. Then he confessed to me that he was shy about asking me for a group hookup and thought I'd go along with it once I got there.   I wasn't allowed to leave. I won't say I was raped, because eventually I consented to it just to get out of there. It wasn't rough or sadistic at all.

Obviously you shouldn't be like, ""Yeah, this food is great... so like sometimes I get super depressed and have to take meds, it's so weird right?!""  But sometimes it fits naturally into the conversation and I've had some really great bonding moments with guys when we talk about some of the stuff we struggled through with our sexuality/coming out/etc. I wouldn't want to miss out on those moments, because connecting on something so deep can be great for a relationship"

A polite ""I had fun, but the chemistry just isn't there."" Or any variant thereof, is better than letting him think a second date is in the horizon.

I have a security clearance, i don't have to, at all, talk about my job if i don't want to. Actually i can think of a lot of other things to talk about besides my job.   *3. I hate guys the respond with ""yeah"" ""okay""  ""that seems cool"", because if you are not really interested, just say so, don't play cool just to get laid.  *4. If after the first 2 or 3 dates and a guy flakes more than twice, then talks about making it up but never does, is not worth the stress, and is actually pretty shitty.   *5. Don't get me drunk, try and have sex, then call me a little boy when i walk off because i ain't about that shit.  *6. Ask about my tattoos, don't make fun of them or say something snarky about how they are bad for you."

Do not pay for a taxi for a 10 minute walk. Do not praise the French Academy in front of a linguist.  That would be like praising creationism in front of a geologist.  When you informed about this, do not inform the linguist that he is misinformed about how language works. Do not continue said conversation with said linguist by switching the conversation to ""Ebonics"".  Do not keep calling it ""Ebonics"" even after you are told that this is an out-of-date and somewhat offensive term. Do not start a sentence with ""Not to be racist, but..."" Do not fail to tip the bartender, especially after you noted that you were a bartender in the past.  You know how rude that is.  Yes, the service was bad, but it is never that bad. Do not stop on the way out to harangue the (female) manager about how terrible the bar service was. Do not continue this for 10 minutes while your date is awkwardly standing there. Especially do not explain to the (female) manager that, having been a bartender yourself, you understand that sometimes male bartenders have to flirt with the female patrons in order to get them to tip an appropriate amount (females are usually so stingy, you see), but that that was no excuse for ignoring us, even though you totally understand, because sometimes it has to be done.

gaybros,3dymex,WJ90,21,Mon Jul 20 20:06:24 2015 UTC,"To me, one of the greatest aspects of being gay is the freedom to be who or what you want to be. You can be masculine yet acknowledge the aspects of femininity within yourself (which every man, gay or straight, I believe has). I call it faggotry, it's an empowering thing for me. I have to tell others I'm gay, yet it's not something I hide. I was raised a certain way I guess, with two brothers and we are a lot alike. So I am masculine per say, but that doesn't mean I can't sissy that walk and be a glamazon bitch ready for the runway (in my mind). It's almost as if you're in on a joke that only a select few get, and not necessarily all other gay guys. When you do find others that get it and you, there's no better feeling. It's a universal truth that being yourself will surround you with other positive like minded or understanding people, your tribe."

Like, I know I'm a bit effeminate in my bearing. I'm obviously a dude and all, but, mostly, I'm not super macho.  But I don't have anymore interest in drag shows than I do in comedians. I like them okay if they've got really funny stand up act. I don't get the point of lip syncing. So, you've got a good message - but if drags a big part of your life then we'd probably spend a big part of that apart if we were dating. Which isn't inherently bad. Like, my boyfriend spends 12 more hours in the gym than I do each week. And that's his me time and my time to binge of League and German TV. You being into drag doesn't reflect your personality anymore than my not.  I don't know, I guess I agree you can be a bro who likes to dress up as a drag queen. But not everyone will be pumped if you're super into drag/specific video games/lacrosse/other more niche things. And you just got to shrug that off and not take it as an insult to your character and masculinity.   PS: Also how the fuck isn't it masculine to care about old ladies?

gaybros,3dymex,ok2nvme,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:19:58 2015 UTC,"For a sub specifically about masculine interests there's a huge emphasis on discussion about feminine things, and what constitutes ""masculine"". And that's fine, and important, but it just seems like there's a whole lot of self conscious going around. How hard is it to just talk masc stuff here? I only just noticed they removed the bit about ""guns, gear, and grub"" from the sidebar. When did they do that? We all have masc and fem interests, why is it so hard to accept that and move on? It's like people are so obsessed with being okay with their feminine sides that they don't actually say much relevant to the sub.   Edit: I'm not sure if any of that is offensive and there's a lot of different opinions running through this thread so I don't want to offend people. This is an awesome community and people flock here because of the alternate representaion of gay men which is a really great thing IMO. But it's just that there's a disparity between ""bro"" and ""masculine"". ""Bro"" is it's own specific thing. You can be masc without being ""bro"". This comes a little too close to trying to push my own idea of bro onto other people so I'm not saying other peoples opinions are wrong. It just seems like a lot of guys come here looking for a community of gay men that isn't focused around traditionally feminine things, and they get that, but not in the most open or accepting way. Because this isn't exactly a sub for that ideal of gay+masc, it's ""gaybros"", with a specific concept of community and content in mind, which doesn't really involve those more feminine interests."

All I'm saying is realize people like different things and just because they're not interested in a guy with feminine interests doesn't mean they hate you.   Here's one (of many) reasons why I avoid guys with feminine interests. First, like I said I'm not attracted at all to femininity, its an instant turn off. I can't help that, its just how I am. Many other guys are the exact same way, people like different things.  Story time: I went on a date with a guy who listed himself as a masculine guy, stated he had all kinds of interests like snowboarding, kayaking, swimming, etc.   We go on a date and I find out he wasn't exactly truthful. He spent the whole night talking about celebrity gossip and Beyonces Drag Race and stuff. He then wanted me to stop at a store with him really quickly where he was looking through womens underwear, picking out purses, and as soon as some song he liked came on the radio he screamed across the store ""tiki_torch, open up your inner fag and dance with me!"". I wanted to crawl under a rock.   He's not the only date I've been on like that. I, and many other guys have stories of dudes like that, which is why we generally avoid guys with more feminine interests because it always ends up turning out that way no matter how many chances you give. Its not that we wish them any ill will, its just that due to experience we know it probably won't work out and why waste our time and their time?"
gaybros,3dymex,erock82,11,Mon Jul 20 21:19:02 2015 UTC,You really shouldn't even have to be explaining this. Gay guys can be whoever they want to be and gay guys can like whoever they want to like.

Project your bad dates elsewhere and not on others by stereotyping all guys who like make up as flamers. Tell special effects make up artists that they're girly, go ahead. There are men who fall in between the lines. I stated I'm not like Jack from Will and Grace, nor am I Paul Bunyan. Some of us aren't one of the other, we just are who we are without interests.

The other person's perception of ""gay"" completely subsumed Amelorn's (James, irl) personhood, to the point where it's easier to ""give them what they want"" rather than go to the trouble of meaningful interaction.  Being a naturally private/reserved person, being (effectively) defined in public by my most private (and infrequent -_-) bedchamber sport has been very jarring.    *By the time I came out, my sense of masculinity was already as fragile as a Ming vase held together with Scotch tape following repeated smashing (bullying, intellectual > athletic prowess, spending half of my life fat, not being acknowledged as an adult when that arrived, and so on).    I sense that a gay man's ""relationship"" with his masculinity is a significant issue, judging by the posturing, factional divisions, affectation, language usage/commentary etc.  One group's ""point"" on the masculine/feminine continuum (crude, but useful enough for this discussion) will freely disparage another point: ie not being ""gay enough"", too catty/queeny, ""pretending to be straight"" - I've heard it all.

gaybros,3e1vzm,m_fz,12,Tue Jul 21 09:06:01 2015 UTC,My first boyfriend and I were together for 8 years. I was 21 when we decided to be together. 8 years later I found out he was cheating on me with other guys. I hated him for what he did to me. I almost became numb to the feeling that I would ever find someone to trust again.   4 years later I have learned to get over hating him and come to terms that I was over him. Within those 4 years I became more independent and more in control of my own life. I did run into my ex once while I was dining out. I was by myself and he was with his current boyfriend. I just smiled and nodded he gave a little wave. it was a great feeling knowing he wasn't part of my life anymore nor do I hate him.

gaybros,3e1vzm,guyhabit,7,Tue Jul 21 17:59:28 2015 UTC,"Well, I can't exactly say I'm in the spot you are looking for, but I am one who doesn't even think of trying to date someone if there is no chance of anything happening. I kinda came up with this way of thinking:  We meet people we are supposed to meet, and our interactions with them are that which we are comfortable with.   I personally have had chance encounters with guys who I honestly thought could be good partners. They did not work out.  With my now bf, I've stumbled upon the idea that our hearts are made of a bunch of puzzle pieces. When we are 100% innocent, we have only our own pieces. And every person we meet that we think is worthy, we give a piece of our heart. Whether or not they return it is up to them. For most of us, that leaves us with only a select few pieces of a heart. And we search and search for someone to finish our puzzle. Only it is the other person who we complete - in terms of their puzzle. And they are the same way to us. So we end up creating one combined heart of love.   Only then can we really realize that it was never love before. And that while we may have made mistakes, someone else had as well.  So we complete them, as they complete us.   And those who we never really loved, well, we learn a new level of loving which surpasses them. And is much more worth it.   TL;DR:  those who fuck us over only pave way to better people."

He cared for me and was understanding, and I will never be able to thank him enough for all he did for me.  he was a good chapter in my life, one filled with cheesy romantic gestures and lots of really good sex, and he helped pull me out of that shitty dark hole that is depression.

I try not to regret having been with him, because now I feel like I'm finally understanding what love is and isn't. Someone who ignores me and tells me to just get over my problems isn't someone I can love. He hasn't taken the break-up so maturely, but I think I can deal with that even if seeing each other will still hurt.  Besides, now I get to think about the guys I turned down for him."
gaybros,3e1vzm,page_one,4,Tue Jul 21 14:16:32 2015 UTC,LOL.  that's how i feel.
gaybros,3e1vzm,eljacobito,3,Tue Jul 21 15:15:56 2015 UTC,"He's reached out a few times since we last had civil contact, but I've not responded to his last two emails. The end of our relationship was horrible and the recovery period tumultuous at best. While not my first love, he was the man I thought I'd live out the rest of my life with, and there's just something in me that can't forget how he treated the guy he had wanted to propose to."
gaybros,3e1vzm,findingphilly,4,Tue Jul 21 13:25:57 2015 UTC,"Although it's not my first love, the only other guy I've fallen in love with cheated on me, strung me along with an open relationship, then ultimately left me for the guy he cheated with. Am I still a little bitter about it? Yes. Only because he hurt me and I never got much closure from it. After we broke up, we wanted to remain friends. I just couldn't have him in my life while trying to heal, so I cut him off. I ended all contact and blocked him in every way possible.   A few months later, my first love/first boyfriend and I started talking again and realized how much of a match we were. Eventually, my second ex got wind of my new relationship and contacted me via email (out of jealousy, curiosity, who knows?) and I let loose every single negative aspect I'd held in during the relationship. I ended everything saying ""I'd like to be friends with you down the line, but you're not going to be a part of my present. You've done too much damage and I can't waste any more time on this."" He hasn't contacted me since and a mutual friend told me he became somewhat self-destructive afterwards. I don't feel bad about how things ended. He has his life, I have mine.   My first love, however is a better story. We dated when we were young, broke up but still kept in touch and he swooped in when I was at my lowest. I ended up marrying him a few years ago, ya know because he's fucking awesome. :-)"
gaybros,3e1vzm,knickerblocker,3,Tue Jul 21 15:13:13 2015 UTC,"Funny that we should be talking about first boyfriends, because I literally just spoke to mine on the phone this morning. He's job hunting here in the City and I offered to forward his resume to contacts of mine. He's into design; I'm into development. We had stuff in common.  Your first serious boyfriend is such a trip because everything is intense. Holding hands on the street and going to places together as an ""item"" just pumps serotonin in every part of your brain as you eventually begin to discover that you can date. ""It gets better."" It's almost as if the two of you have a big secret; that you two can chuckle at the lost souls in search of only sex.  In the end it didn't work out because we were young and we both had some problems to work out. It was a bad breakup. It was also a learning experience. With time, you'll understand how liberating forgiveness can be both for him and for yourself. Relationships are always 50/50 and you get what you deserve when you commit to dating someone. You subconsciously know what the other person is like. Are you angry because you dated a cheating asshat? Don't be angry at him when you figure out that the leopard has spots. People are human beings, with foibles and flaws, not projects.  Having said that, I also learned that once you really love someone you always have a little piece of your heart reserved for them. I think that's very special. I certainly don't hold any malice towards my first boyfriend and I genuinely hope the best for him: I want him to meet someone nice and I want him to have a good career. Time really does heal everything and with some perspective you'll forgive both him and yourself."

He's in China now getting and met a girl to feed into his masochism fetish while teaching English.  My most recent ex currently hates me, because I broke off the relationship after 3 years.I knew I wouldn't be able to give him what he wanted in the long run and felt that I'd be wasting his time if I kept going along in the relationship. I'm holding out hope that in a few months I can contact him and talk, but know there is also a possibility he won't forgive me."

We had always appreciated most how our walks of life were so different and resulted in similar values and goals.   After we broke up we both continued on our own paths, paths that neither of us would regret, nor do I fault him for his, but after we reconciled after a few years just 'ew'. I see the kind of people he is interested in, I hear the reasons why he doesn't want to be social, and I just can't. We just don't sync up anymore.

A fwe months ago, a mutual friend of ours was married and I knew he was in the wedding. Strangely I didn't see any pics of him at the wedding when they got posted on FB. Not that weird, he's not on FB, but I was surprised not to see the best man pop up in any pictures...until I looked again. Full mullet and creeper mustache. Totally unrecognizable and not in a good way. I spoke to another friend of ours from college and was told ""thank you for showing me this.

I dealt with his intimacy issues, I tried to be understanding when I found out his drinking was a lot more serious than I initially thought (its so much easier to hide things when you only see each other on weekends) and I dealt with his crazy family and occasional breakdowns from stress at work.   I was never able to voice any of my concerns or desires because he was so sensitive he'd almost immediately burst into tears. There was never any room in our relationship to deal with my feelings because his issues were always primary.   He also never seemed to notice the sacrifices I'd make for him. I left the wedding of a very close friend early because he wasn't feeling well. His brothers wedding was the following weekend and we were out all night. This sort of thing happened multiple times.   He'd accuse me of making him feel bad when I was merely suggesting he do things that adults with full time jobs ought to be doing, like seeing a doctor because he was experiencing recurring stomach pains etc.   I also found the apartment he now lives in after he got in a huge fight with his alcoholic mother and was living on a friends sofa for a month. He watched me buy hundreds of dollars worth of stuff to move in together and then ended things via a text message when a conversation we were having got out of hand and he'd been drinking.   For a few months after that he would message me saying he wanted to get back together but made absolutely zero effort (not that I would have anyway). He also never allowed us to really have a face to face conversation and began dating other people immediately despite being together for almost two years.   He really wanted to be friends after we separated but I refuse to have anyone that cowardly and rude in my life. His new boyfriend is like 12 years older and seems like a loser so whenever I feel bad about it I just imagine them sitting in his tiny apartment unable to make plans for the future because they both lack drive."

gaybros,3e2x44,emcee_gee,2,Tue Jul 21 16:50:58 2015 UTC,"I'm in IT at a university. We're switching user management systems this week, so everyone (~12,000 accounts) has to change their password. So I'm spending hours upon hours putting out a bunch of nearly-identical teeny-tiny fires."
gaybros,3e2x44,emcee_gee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:06:48 2015 UTC,"Fun stuff.   Hey, question-  If somebody's password is ctrl+backspace five times (yes it makes a character on Windows 7's login screen)  What if that user forgets that password? What does the computer even store to keep track of that?"
gaybros,3e2x44,Withoutthescheibe,4,Tue Jul 21 16:52:46 2015 UTC,"In any reasonably-secure environment, passwords are not stored in a way you would recognize. They're run through a specific series of mathematical equations that make it easy to get from plaintext password to consistent gibberish, but nearly impossible to go from that gibberish back to the plaintext password. (For an example of what I mean by gibberish, try typing something here: http://www.miraclesalad.com/webtools/md5.php). So, regardless of what your password is, as long as every time you enter it, that series of mathematical equations produces the same gibberish, you can log in.  The character you've described is called a ""control character"". Basically what that is is a character just like any letter, number, or symbol in many ways, but it's one with some amount of special meaning to the computer. This presents an interesting issue with using that in your passwords: not every password field can send that character to the server to run those mathematical formulas. Some can, for sure. But in applications that rely on that character to mean something else, it might not work.  So, for instance, the system we're switching our campus to this week will allow people to log in through the Windows login screen, but it'll also allow people to log in to a few of our webpages. If the character you're describing isn't handled properly by your web browser in sending your login request to the server, it's very possible that you'd be able to log in fine at a desktop but not through a web browser.  Long response, I know, but, hey - sounds like you've got time. :-)"

Because the societal struggles we face are similar, as in they're based in non-conforming to an heteronormative model. The rest of society generally views LGBT people as ""outside of gender norms"" but doesn't distinguish further than that. Homophobia and transphobia kind of mix together as they are about gender roles, like people who hate on effeminate guys (sleeping with men being considered ""effeminate"") will lump trans women in with them and in the end, both groups will face the same hate for not being ""man enough"". Take straight guys who feel ""tricked into being gay"" if they sleep with a trans woman. That's a mix of transphobia and homophobia.   A lot of people also seem to think trans man are ""super lesbians"" and trans women are ""super gays"" and think we transition to get into hetero relationships because they're better and easier to get into than homosexual relationships. Homophobia (straight = better).  Plus, trans people need allies. There's really not a lot of us (something like 0.3% of the population?), not enough to be able to change things positively for us by ourselves. And since LGB people live struggles pertaining to not adhering to heteronormative roles, they're the closest allies, especially when part of society sees us all as the same thing.  And lots of T people are also LGB so we hangout within the community anyway.   It just seems like a term that people would use while they are transitioning but would want to drop once they ""become"" the gender of which they identify?    Yes in the sense that you just see yourself as your actual gender after a while, but it doesn't change the fact that you were assigned at birth the other gender and you had to fight that. I see it just as a medical condition when I say I'm trans. No matter what I do, I was born female and raised as a girl and I can't erase that so that colours my experiences and also had consequences on my body. It's a part of my baggage."

To my knowledge there is increasing evidence that just like sexual orientation, our gender identity is strongly biological and innate and cannot be controlled.  Difference to sexual minorities though is that gender dysphoria is a diagnosable condition where the clash of gender identity and the sex of your body causes severe distress. And because gender identity is largely seen as an innate property which cannot be changed, and it is a substantial and defining property of the person, the treatment is to surgically re-assign the sex to mach the sex of the brains to reduce the dysphoria (as the brains cannot be re-assigned)."

It kind of irks me that as a gay guy, i'm constantly fighting peoples conceptions of masculinity and femininity - just because I like dick and am a little limp-wristed, doesn't mean i'm any less ""masculine""  But with trans people it's like ""oh I am 'feminine'/have 'feminine' qualities, so that must mean that i'm a girl.

gaybros,3e1ak3,OnPoint5,0,Tue Jul 21 06:18:45 2015 UTC,"But hey, that's just my view, feel free to challenge it.   Sure! The thing is that you have this inner identity that tells you you're a man. Even if you do things that are stereotypically female, like be attracted to men, or crochet, or bake, or whatever, it doesn't diminish your masculinity. It's the same for trans people, only instead of fighting against societal stereotypes they're fighting their own biology. The fact that they have the opposite gendered body doesn't diminish their internal sense of their gender.  This leads us to another important part of trans people's lives. Trans people generally suffer from some amount of gender dysphoria- a powerful kind of psychological pain brought on by the mismatch between their gender identity and bodies.  Transitioning, in whatever manner each trans person chooses, is not so much about 'I have '<gender> qualities' so I must be <gender>' as it is about matching an innate sense of one's own gender and reducing dysmorphia.  Admittedly, I'm not trans myself, this is just the way it's been put to me, so if I'm off base, I hope someone will correct me."

For a really long time I lived as a very masculine woman, and the more masculine I presented, the better I felt with myself, but the worse I felt socially. Eventually this turned into transitioning, and I've never been more comfortable in my own skin or happier. And I don't give a shit if my voice sounds a bit feminine, or if I like colourful trousers, or whatever. I lived for 37 years as a female, and it's had a huge influence on me, and I'll always have some of that in my personality. Being trans is often not about upholding a binary at all."

I'd rather people went around challenging and changing conceptions of what gender roles and constructs are, rather than just going ahead and deciding that they are/feel like some binary gender.   Trans people do do this too though.  Plenty of trans people don't fit gender stereotypes (tomboy trans women etc).  It's not uncommon at all.  It's not to do with gender roles or stereotypes, gender identity is not about being feminine or masculine it's about an internal sense of what gender you are.

Someone at some time expressed a purely stylistic preference for using 'amount' with uncountable mass nouns and 'number' with countable plurals. Someone, possibly the same someone, mistook that preference for a grammatical rule. However, there is no semantic justification for the distinction to be found in the definitions of either word. The only time you would be required to use 'number' is if you cared about the value of the actual count.  The English language is complex enough being the mongrel child of Romance and Germanic languages. It really doesn't need utterly arbitrary rules for the sake of having rules. This distinction doesn't help in comprehension or aid understanding. It's only purpose, as far as I can tell, is so arcane grammarians can correct others."

You get wildly different statistics depending on which study you look at it; so it's really hard to pin down exactly where it's at;  I guess here's the CDC's info.    So gay male relationship violence is lower than bisexual male relationship violence; and both are lower than lesbian and bisexual female violence;  Heterosexual relationships are probably slightly lower, or comparable, to the rates of violence in lesbian relationships.    Heterosexual men are the least likely to be victims, and gay men are a bit lower in terms of violence rates than the other types of relationship.  Most of the data collected is for lesbian relationships; there is not a whole lot on male victims of violence, regardless of sexuality.   But what data does exist typically shows male-male violence in relationships to be lower, either slightly or greatly, than other demographics; though LGBT organizations don't frequently point that statistic out for some reason...  Though it is possible lower rates of reported domestic abuse in male-male couples are in large part due to men being less likely to report being abused--a problem that exists among many LBGT relationships (for fear of discrimination due to LGBT Status from authorities), but is typically more of a problem for males than females (not including transgender persons, who are more likely to be victimized across the board, regardless of gender identity)."

Please, please, please speak up about it if it happens to you, and have enough self respect to leave. If there is abuse in your relationship, it isn't love. It's dysfunction. The likelihood of it happening again if it's happened once is very high. No one should ever, ever, ever cross the line and be physical with you, for anything you do. It doesn't matter if you're in the wrong, if you cheat, if you're being an asshole. There is no reason anyone should violate you physically. Love does not leave bruises.  I've been in abusive relationships in the past. I remember one fight in particular (the last one I had) where I was almost the kid who was killed. This is scary and so sad to hear about. Such an unnecessary death, and now a guy in jail for killing someone.   If you are ever in an altercation like this with someone you're dating, leave the vicinity immediately and go to a safe or public place and call the cops. If there is someone else in the apartment/house/building besides the 2 of you, go find that person. Go to a neighbor's. Go to the RA. Stuff like this happens way too often."

This has been the subject of a lot of discussion and research in the Forensic Science community and they've found that most drugs, including alcohol, do not cause autonomous (non-voluntary) behavior. Also, they've found that a person under the influence of alcohol (as well as most other drugs) is fully aware of their actions as they are committing them, even if they may not remember after the fact. This means that certain actions and behaviors, including this homicide, cannot be blamed on the use of intoxicants.  Some drugs that can possibly cause autonomous behavior include hallucinogens like LSD or deliriants like bath salts."

Sorry but im not buying it, anything this guy did is on him, not the substances he may or may not have ingested, show me a single case where violent conduct was attributed entirely to drug use and not the offender (unless you're arguing drug psychosis etc, which is a slightly different story but still doesn't usually result in a calculated, violent fucking murder)"

But the documented facts are irrefutable.  Also, remember, the effects of drugs are cumulative.  They are slowly rerouting the neural paths of your brain signals, and they are deteriorating your brain cells.  Neurologists can detect chronic drug usage by glancing at a catscan and EKG.  Doesn't that tell you anything?    Protracted usage of anti depressants cause the brain to shrivel in on itself.  Imagine what the high powered stuff does.  And anyone who has lived around an alcoholic family can tell you about the severe and rapid deterioration of the drinker past the mid 30s."

Im not saying they don't have many deleterious effects on the mind, im not saying drugs are good or that they can't play a role in crime, im saying that either you're capable of these things or you aren't and drugs don't sway that distinction, stop justifying murder. edit: the murderer was 20, there's no indication of excessive drug or alcohol use so i completely fail to see how your experience with antidepressants (SRIs don't 'shrivel' your brain just fyi) or old alcoholic family is even halfway relevant."

gaybros,3e19oz,Pabasa,3,Tue Jul 21 08:02:52 2015 UTC,"I loved Ant-Man! I thought it was one of marvel's better movies. It was a lot of fun and had great humor. And to be honest, I enjoyed it more than Age of Ultron. I'm still a little pissed with how they made Ultron, but it's whatever. But Ant-Man has a great cast, and I really liked Michael Douglas' portrayal of Hank Pym."

It still retains a lot of his influence though, some scenes are very much in his style and the writing feels like his. It does have a lot of the Shawn of the Dead/ Hot Fuzz vibe to it."
gaybros,3e15hv,garrus93,12,Tue Jul 21 03:56:43 2015 UTC,"Yours is a classic case of neurosis. You ought to get therapy. I don't have much to offer you besides sympathy, but here's a few points. Your case is one where you set roadblocks up in front of yourself by your hasty conclusions and generalizations which impede your growth.  --The whole wanting str8 guys exclusively is not only self-defeating but juvenile. Emphasis on juvenile. I used to think I only was attracted to straight guys too, but then I realized that's only a trick of statistics: most men are straight or mostly straight, therefore most hot man are also. It took me a while until I met hot gay guys.  The only universal difference between straight men and gay men is that you get to have sex and form relationships with gay men. Everything else is superficial variation; straight men don't have some magic sauce that makes them extra attractive. Get over this silly infatuation so that you can start coming to terms better with your sexuality.  As for finding gay sex gross: how much have you tried it? Hygiene is your friend. Plenty of gay sex is had that is clean, enjoyable, and   fun. And there is more to it than just anal. You forgot probably the main attraction: dick. Do you not like dick? Lots of fun to be had in that department, and it doesn't need to involve the backside.   Honestly, when it comes to your reservations about gay sex, I think you're just not doing it right.  It sucks that you come from a homophobic country. That culture has probably added to your neurosis and confusion. It certainly isn't helping you. You've got to compartmentalize yourself and that's not fun. It might make you a more devious and ingenious talker, but it's not good for your mental health. I don't have much to tell you here, other than that if you must get out then get out. As an added bonus, you get to see the world.  As for not liking gay culture, big deal. I don't think it's that great either; I have no particular reaction to drag queens or anything of the sort, but I don't shy away from it either. You just accept it as a backdrop. You don't have to participate. Gay culture is an tiny part of my life as a gay dude and I'm fine with that. The boundaries are negotiable.        You sound like a pretty cool guy. Don't be so hard on yourself. My hunch is many of your complaints about your gayness stem from deeper frustrations and psychological blockages which, once removed, would allow you to enjoy your sexuality and be liberated.  Hang in there!"
gaybros,3e15hv,justadude9010,2,Tue Jul 21 05:11:12 2015 UTC,"I do think that the first part is right and that maybe I could use some therapy. Not ashamed of admitting it.   And about the str8 guys... I really don't think about it. It just happens. I just never meet gay guys that I find attractive or want to make connection with. It is always some random friend from my neighborhood, faculty or friend of a friend that I get attracted to and they are ALWAYS heterosexual. It's just a random, natural thing. It's not my psychological blockages because even when I don't know a thing about the guy (his preferences) it is always the str8 guys that I end up liking. There is a difference. I met MANY different gay men - no matter what, can't feel the attraction.  Sex... well, I tried it, believe me. With a few guys. It just hurts. I want to have it, very much (i have needs) but as soon as It starts I just want it to end. It feels sooo bad. And no, oral sex is not enough. I am human being, I have my needs and I want to have good sex... It's not much to ask and yet it is so impossible for me.  I hope that I can somehow leave this country and go to a better place where I can enjoy my life. I hope everything changes.  Thank you so much for you comment... I really wanted someone to hear me out.  (again, typing in English is really tough)"

I'm not sure I like the dutch oven cooking though. I would suggest learning to free form bake your loaves. Proof your loaves in a banneton first. Turn out onto your pan, slash with a lame, then bake. What I do when I'm home is crank my oven to 500 and put an empty cake pan (metal) in the oven during the preheat. Put my loaves in, pour 1 cup of water in the pan. (You can also use a spray bottle to spritz your oven.) Or both at the same time. Close the oven door cook 2 minutes, spritz again, cook two minutes. Repeat for 10 minutes total, then turn your oven down to 400 and remove the steam pan. The steam helps keep your crust moist so it expands better and also helps to caramelize it so it gets more brown, crispy, and shiny.   Not sure if this will be viewable by you, but should be public. This is my food portfolio; what I've made at work."

Here's some tips for you: use higher gluten flour, make sure your yeast is not old, knead it for a while it should be really smooth and springy, don't use all the flour recipes say it can sometimes be too much, let it rest after you knead for about 30+ minutes, then punch it down to a rectangle shape. Fold it in thirds and tuck the ends. Then let it rest another ten minutes or so. When baking you can use a loaf pan if you want but it makes it harder to tell when it's done. To tell when it's done you tap the bottom of the loaf it should have a nice hollow sound. And voila you have perfect bread."

gaybros,3dumip,andymac89,3,Sun Jul 19 21:14:28 2015 UTC,I love Pride! I was lucky enough to go to London and Wales to see the filming locations. I still have my LGSM pin.
gaybros,3dumip,MoleMcHenry,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:43:37 2015 UTC,"I seriously don't get why people like The Normal heart. That movie was 100% Emmy bait. Yeah it's sad and tells the story about the AIDS crisis, but that's not the only thing that makes up a movie. It was SOOO over the top and SOOO dramatic. Me and my friends were waiting for each actor's ""Emmy Moment."" It's that moment when the character shouts and gets angry. People seem to think if you yell and get mad then you're suddenly an award worthy actor. Now don't get me wrong, Ruffalo and Bomer are great actors, but Parsons seems to act the same in everything he does. And everyone else was just meh. God, everytime Ruffalo yelled ""WE HAVE TO FIGHT"" it just felt so stagey. So forced and obvious.   With that said, Pride was WAAAY better than I thought it would be. I expected a heavy handed (like the normal heart) story but it was really good and really funny."

gaybros,3dumip,MoleMcHenry,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:58:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know that. But plays and movies aren't the same. Both are made and performed differently. I go to see a movie to see a movie and not a stage play. That's the problem with producers who go from the stage to film. They often don't know how to turn their plays into movies. The problem is Ryan Murphy knew that everyone would respond to the drama and not the movie itself. It's not me being cynical, it's me wanting to watch a movie and not a broadway show."
gaybros,3dumip,parisinla,-1,Mon Jul 20 00:06:11 2015 UTC,One doesn't simply do a Larry Kramer movie.
gaybros,3dumip,chuckduck253,25,Mon Jul 20 00:09:58 2015 UTC,You should check out the film C.R.A.Z.Y. It's a really great film and one of my favorites that I can actually relate to.
gaybros,3dumip,MoleMcHenry,3,Sun Jul 19 20:04:42 2015 UTC,This is legit my favorite gay themed movie. It's already a great movie. But what makes it more amazing is that the kid isn't his sexuality. Gay movies focus way too much on being gay and gay stuff. This movie is about a family and one of the kids happens to be gay and trying to deal with it. Story first. Sexuality second.
gaybros,3dumip,blueredgreen567,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:25:06 2015 UTC,I'd disagree about that movie. Zac's sexuality (and how he and others perceive his sexuality) has a huge impact on his story.   Zac doesn't have a conscious identity as a Gay Mantm until the very end. But everyone's perceptions of his sexuality impact his relationships. It's kind of impossible to separate his interactions with his family and friends from those perceptions.
gaybros,3dumip,MoleMcHenry,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:04:05 2015 UTC,I kind of explained that oddly. the TL;DR should just be the movie focused on story first and sexuality second instead of making it all about sexuality and gayness in general.
gaybros,3dumip,blueredgreen567,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:22:13 2015 UTC,"I guess I feel like his sexuality (and, I know I keep repeating this, how characters perceive his sexuality) impacted so many of his experiences that it's impossible to separate his coming-of-age story from his figuring-out-he's-gay story.   You can't describe his relationship with his father, for instance, without mentioning his sexuality. Zac's perception of himself colors his response to his dad's behavior. Zac's dad's perception of Zac influences HIS behavior.   It feels a bit impossible, to me, to try to differentiate ""a gay story"" from ""a story about a guy whose life is heavily influenced by the fact that he's gay""."

gaybros,3dumip,throwaway_away_away,4,Sun Jul 19 20:23:34 2015 UTC,It should be noted that Mysterious Skin is about child sexual abuse...very different from the romance/coming of age themes in OP's list.

gaybros,3dumip,Godrics,2,Mon Jul 20 02:06:36 2015 UTC,Many on the list is more on the light-hearted side or more easy type of film. Mysterious Skin the kind of movie that gives an uneasy/disturbing feeling linger around long afterwards.

It's not the highest quality in terms of writing/acting; you can tell it's somewhat low-budget, but I promise you'll enjoy it.   My absolute favorite moment from this film is the mother's little speech near the end, when she and her son are finally talking openly about his sexuality.

The film has no sound-track and apart from the parking lot and the camera never leaves the lake, yet he creates such a complex film.  Some have even argued the film is satirical. The society in the film is completely anonymous and the French word for corporation is société anonyme (anonymous society).

Well, as for Rio, remember to keep low profile and try to hide you are a tourist as much as possible while on the streets, don't  be a fool  walking by foot at night.  As for Salvador you really can't hide you are a tourist if you're white, but being low profile is still very important for your safety.  Don't go to sketchy and poor places period. Talk to your hotel staff about other tips.  Don't appear gay while on street to avoid having to deal with rude people, the irony is that Brazil is a very conservative country.  Consider visiting the Magic Island of Florianópolis and the rest of Santa Catarina's state coast, a SHIT-TON more safe and gay-friendly."

The best way to do this, IMO, is to take one of the bus trips that leave from the Praca do Lido (it's a park/square with a kiosk that sells tickets for white minivan trips). It's the cheapest and fastest way to get there! Also, climb the Dois Irmãos! It's a super fun experience, and you get to go on motobike through a pacified favela and the see Rochina from the top!  If you're in Rio on a Sunday, DEFINITELY check out 00 (Zero Zero). It's a sexy-ass bar in Leblon that's gay on Sundays and it's where all the hot rich Cariocas will be! The Week is fun as well, if not pretty INTENSE (circuit party).  If you like all things gay, like I do, Posto 9 will be heaven! So many beautiful Brazilians just soaking up the sun. It's also near one of the saunas and the gay bars/clubs on Farme de Amoedo!  One thing about Brazilian guys, making eye contact and maintaining it is an invitation to make out and they may start making out with you at any moment (YAY!).

If you want take good pics/have a nice view, the arpoador's stone is a must. It's located on the left side of Ipanema, between posto 7 and Praia do Diabo's beach. It's the best place in town to see the sunset. And don't buy water on the beach. It will cost 4 reais, while in other places you would pay 2 or 2,50 reais. ( These values  are what I pay as a Portuguese speaking person. If you don't speak Portugese, people will try to make you pay more. If you speak Portuguese, but have strong accent, say that you're from Porto Alegre. People from there   have an weird accent and they all look American.)"

During the week you should definitely go to Porto da Barra or Buracão in the afternoon: these are the only safe urban beaches and with a huge gay crowd. If you're staying for the weekend remeber to hang out at Rio Vermelho. Common's bar is the best club: not strictly gay but completely friendly. Pay atenttion when visting the historical center (Pelourinho, Carmo, etc) as they are kind of dangerous if you're distracted. In Lençóis the rhythm is different: lots of walking through the caves and tracks and beautiful waterfalls. Very hippie vibe and not that gay friendly after all."

So many amazing fruits that we don't have in the U.S. or other countries.    Also try food from street vendors.  I never got sick from them and I lived in the poorest two states in Brazil.  That's no guarantee that you won't get sick, but I don't think that's likely.  You can get some interesting food on the street.  You can also try padarias (bakeries) for similar items as street vendors.  Try coxinhas.  Again this is my experience coming from living in the northeast so YMMV."
gaybros,3dwc6g,Sakeofanonymity,5,Mon Jul 20 02:02:59 2015 UTC,"Hey, sorry to hear things aren't great at the moment. I've been there, it gets better. Sex is the canary in the cage, an early signal that intimacy and communication is degrading. Consider just talking to him. ""Hey, I love you. We haven't had sex in a while. What's up?"" Try to be non-judgemental and talk to him like a friend. Try not to argue any points he brings up. Listening skills are key."

Say you are still in love with him. blah blah blah, but if he isn't you'd rather him be honest and end it then, because again, you aren't his property(not in a feminist way), you aren't to be used for anything whether it's company, or just to fill the void of his own insecurities.  Some people can't stand to be alone, I always let the guy I'm dating to end it the second they don't feel it anymore because the last thing I want is someone being with me when they don't want to be.  I can't stand it when people use others for their own insecurities/fulfillment, especially when they aren't reciprocating the same role.  Not saying he is, but being honest is the only way, brutal honest is what helps real relationships sustained, holding stuff in ultimately will lead to a problem down the road."
gaybros,3dwc6g,wooeee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:11:56 2015 UTC,"I agreed.  Talk to him openly and find out what's on his mind.  Communication is required in all relationships.   Love is a feeling that could come and go.  You are still in love with him but he might not feel the same any more, be prepared to find out the truth.  It doesn't mean he didn't love you two years ago.  People go through different stages of life and want to experiment different things/feelings.  He might feel trapped and want to move on and you wouldn't know the truth unless you ask him.   Sometimes people treat their partner cold and distant and the purpose is to have their partners to get the signals and leave on their own so they can pretend that they are not the ones who want to end the relationships.  It is a very immature thing to do but people do that.   Relationship takes two emotional mature people to make it work.  If one of them changed his mind about staying together then it is hard for the other person to change that.  Being brutally honest is the key,  you are hurting but not knowing if he still loves you hurt even more.    If he doesn't want to go on then end it sooner rather than being tortured.  Pretending to be happy in front of other people would make it even more difficult that it is.  Please do not feel embarrass and go seek supports from close friends.  That's what friends are for.  Time will heal everything and you will find someone who treasure you instead of torture you."

It sounds like you both have stopped putting effort in and it's coming to a head for you.  I've been in this spot in past and to a certain extent my current relationship.   I know you said you don't feel he'll listen, but nothing will change unless you talk to him. Be open to listening, don't be judgmental and really, be the bigger person here when listening, even if it hurts. You want to understand what he's going through, not push all your feelings onto him right now. It sucks, but its part of making relationships work.  If you can, find some couples counselling, I've found in the past that helps quite a bit, if not there are a few books on the subject of relationships that have helped me, pm me if interested.   You stated that relationships are 'supposed to be' a certain way... they aren't.  Everyone is different. Drop the mentality that your relationship needs to hit certain markers and milestones.  It's up to you both to determine where it goes and how it looks.    In the end it really does boil down to talking to him, being honest with yourself and him and truly listening to his side of things.  For all you know he's in the same boat or maybe even further ahead and is feeling bitter and alone as well.  Good luck, I hope things can be worked out."

My advice to you, don't keep quiet (like my boyfriend), initiate dialogue and be prepared for the truth, don't get defensive, just try to understand and have a constructive dialogue."
gaybros,3dwc6g,bipolar-bear,2,Mon Jul 20 12:54:53 2015 UTC,Whoa I feel you're talking exactly about me. FYI throwaway obviously. As someone on the other side I'll be bluntly honest. Things get ... Boring after a while. Does not mean he doesn't love you. Ok get this straight he loves you but things at times can get boring. Now also o he's like me doesn't mean he doesn't enjoy sex but he sometimes needs that push or warm up. Another thing too is I know you might hate this idea but how about opening it? Just to recharge those batteries. Another thing you could do that def caused me to realize what a great guy I was losing was take a break. My S.O. had had it enough of me acting this way so he ended up making us take a break. Made me think stuff over and realize I was a loser for acting how I did. It also helped up rehearse those sex batteries back up. If you need to talk to someone that's acting like your bf don't hesitate to contact me

When you think of perceptions, her world at the time was seeing people's legs, and having to look up to see people's faces, a sense of smallness, then here she is, in the mind of Ganesha, seeing everything from above. Seeing it all at once. I can't pinpoint a specific moment in my life where I had that kind of breakthrough in perception, but I know that feeling."

gaybros,3dt2fq,alan713ch,0,Mon Jul 20 20:12:48 2015 UTC,"Netflix hasn't announced whether there'll be a second season yet, though the creators have a five season story arc planned. It's gotten very good on-site reviews from people who've watched it, but very mediocre reviews from professional critics. That leaves things uncertain, and we don't have a very good idea about the future of the series until it's announced.  It's been funny watching people try to work out who the ""main character(s)"" is/are, and their opinions have mostly been pretty predictable based on who they personally identify with. I'm fairly sure it's an intended part of the viewer experience to eventually ""wake up"" and realize that there's no ""main character,"" and attempting to identify one goes against a large part of the show's ""I am also a we"" theme. :) That seems to be the consensus whenever ""main character"" discussions pop up on Sense8 discussion boards.  I think the thing with Wolfgang was more complex than that. His dad was a bloody-minded individual, who ended up making a bloody-minded individual of his son, and that had unforeseen consequences. Was Wolfgang an abused kid? Probably. Was he sexually abused by his dad? Probably not, as the show creators aren't the sort who'd be shy to make a point about that.  The thing with Will and Lito was slightly overdone. Yes, viewers understand that Will had a sexual experience which was way outside the norm for him, not the least because it involved telepathy. I did find Nomi indirectly telling the both of them to grow up about it to be chuckle-worthy though. (In fairness, from the point of view of a bisexual guy in a poly relationship, I'd still find that exact same situation disconcerting purely because of how it came about.)"

Someone got knocked unconscious and we were digging through the leaves to see if anyone was under. The organizers rushed us away.   After we left I noticed my wedding band was missing. I ran full speed back inside and they had the area blocked off. The organizer basically told me ""Sorry but we can't do anything.""

It's a celebration of being able to be who we are without impunity and for some people, it is letting their hair down and going crazy.   Don't get me wrong, I too hate how some Pride Parades have gotten a bit not my style. For example, I'm seeing some of my students march in nothing but wings and the smallest undergarment ever; however, I think it's a good experience for a mass populous. My mother recently attended a Pride Parade in Seattle while she was there and our relationship has never been the best, especially after me coming out of the closet, but on her road to accepting that I'm still her son, she learned so much from this simple Parade. She enjoyed the experience and the liveliness that is our culture, and even though our aunt, bless her, asked what a condom was (to be honest, they were handing them out attached to pamphlets so they didn't look like condom packages), the whole experience was a great lesson. Deep down we all just want to be proud of who we are."

The Beatles were pop (and were known as such), as were countless artists before the post-disco switch. I'd argue that post-disco Madonna-esque pop is a completely different beast to current pop anyway.  It's a pretty meaningless term (as are all of the 'big 4' marketing terms of popular, jazz, classical, and folk/world). Almost nothing exists purely within these four, and that which does tends to be pretty old."

gaybros,3dqabq,someone_like_me,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:33:53 2015 UTC,Yess! Weekend is by far my favourite gay-themed movie and I've seen a few. The amount of emotion that's packed into the short two-day time frame of the movie is astonishing. The movie is also so muted and placid so as to present all the emotion without any unnecessary drama.  It just makes for such a pleasant viewing experience and really leaves a person thinking about the movie because of how transient all the events unfold.
gaybros,3dqabq,thelowcrows,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:36:59 2015 UTC,"Weekend is really one of my favorite movies ever. It was pretty unforgettable when I first watched it because I was studying overseas then and was also going through something that is quite similar to the story in the movie. Till today I still watch it during sleepless late nights, sometimes just to purge the emotion out of me. What I love about the movie is the subtle yet powerful storytelling and a plot that is relatable to my circumstance."

At the worst of it, I came across an article on the Lincoln Highway, a disjointed route that connects Times square in NYC with Lincoln Park in SF. I hadn't been on my bike in a while (Brooklyn is no place for antique beemers) and suddenly that became my center of peace, slacking off and planning a trip - if not on that highway, at least on as much 2 lane road as possible (an interstate is no place for antique beemers). I got obsessed. Very understanding husbro saw that it was breaking up my depression, so he was (and still is) totally supportive. As a couple though, we're happily codependent. I just spent 3 days away from him, you'd think we'd been apart for years. I dunno, I need a grand adventure for sure, and I think that's it (dependable bike, camera, sleeping bag, atlas, faintest whisper of a plan, gas money), but I know we'll both spend te time apart with an element of melancholy. For isolation on a bike, that's ideal. Home, going to work, cooking for one, not so ideal. Though the reunion sex will be spectacular."

You see, I felt awkward in college, not sure who I was, not sure how to dress, act, be. I thought if I dressed 'gay' I would be sending a message to other DL or gay dudes that I was gay. After two days of dressing up, I realized that it wasn't' me. I realized I didn't have to be someone I wasn't. I was still me. I was still the same person. The ONLY difference was that I enjoyed the company of men. I didn't NEED to like disco, or 'look nice' or be neat, or any other stereotype. I only had to be me. The same dirty, disorganized, scruffy, chubby, regular, normal me. The only difference is that I liked dudes. SO… please don't wake up tomorrow and feel you need a pair of tits or a wig. Go through the next year being the same person as you are now. Just the same you who likes dudes. If after a year you feel the need to change, then do it.

I want a relationship, but don't know where to start. I don't have any experience dating, and am not into the hookup scene. Clubs and Gay Bars are super scary to me, crowds and loud music, not my thing. I just want someone who I can go to Lunch and a Museum, or antiquing, or to the mall, dinner and a movie or a day trip to St. Augustine or Tampa, or a bed in breakfast, or just cuddling together on a rainy day.   I think my perception of gay guys my age has been skewed the internet and TV.  I know it gets better, but I just wish it did sooner.   Sorry for the wall of text, I just needed to get a few things off my chest."
gaybros,3dooin,jetlags,4,Sat Jul 18 09:07:16 2015 UTC,"For the more backwoods areas, it isn't easy to meet gay guys that don't have a complex about it. CL is for closeted guys who pretend to be straight and hate themselves after hooking up with guys, Grindr will be filled with headless torso pics and is also just for hookups, but is slightly better than CL. Tinder may find you some guys, but depending on your population density (and redneck conservative density) the pickings may be slim, but at least the guys on Tinder are generally out and okay with themselves. Your best bet to meet well-adjusted guys is definitely OKCupid, since it requires much more effort and commitment to make a profile. There you will be able to find dates that don't end in sex, if that's what you're looking for.  The sad truth of it is that you pretty much have to turn to the internet to meet guys. You can get lucky in real life but it's rare to organically meet a guy where there's mutual interest and compatible personalities."
gaybros,3dooin,dylanus93,2,Sat Jul 18 15:28:35 2015 UTC,"I'm a little wary about online dating, but I think I'll give it a shot. I just need to get over the initial anxiety.

Of course, it may not be as easy for you to find that person, and I get that. As for being assumed straight, that's something I get a lot. It make sense.  Remember, it's not like other people are purposefully trying to identify you as such, it's just a reaction to people who don't seem as gay. I just started identifying as gay when asked. No big deal (I hope). It's fun to see the surprise on people's faces, but I guess that'll probably get old after a while.  I get the rhetoric of ""gay is bad"" when you're growing up.

They have the right idea and a good bullshit detector that will take you places.   I do think the more narrow-minded heterosexists of the world will never understand how wonderful the homosexual bond is. The feeling of invincible strength of male love far outpaces what a brother feels for his brother or even what a father feels for his son. It's on another level. Embrace it as the important part of you it is, and defend it from the spiritual creeps and ghouls who act like what they think about it matters."

The fact that after a break up he's mature enough to be able to forge friendships from these broken relationships says a lot about how he treats people.
gaybros,3dqoq0,Beef_muffin,7,Sat Jul 18 17:15:59 2015 UTC,But he fucked those guys. They shared something intimate. It never crosses your mind what the intimacy could mean?

gaybros,3dqoq0,iknighty,4,Sun Jul 19 06:41:40 2015 UTC,It just doesn't bother me. I think this thinking is the reason why.   Sex is a very intimate thing.  It can make or break a relationship so I can see that my boyfriend sharing that with boys before me could be an issue for the security of my relationship particularly the ones that he's still friends with but in reality sex is just one piece of a working / healthy relationship and if the rest had worked then they'd still be together. It didn't and they're not...  I realise that to keep the thinking this clear cut requires a small leap of faith but it's that or let each new relationship be weighed down by the mistakes of previous ones...
gaybros,3dqoq0,Beef_muffin,3,Mon Jul 20 07:11:41 2015 UTC,This is a really helpful view. I just ended a relationship with someone who has been a close friend for years.

Exes are exes for a reason."

gaybros,3dqoq0,ThatSBKid,6,Sat Jul 18 23:28:09 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, you have to accept that people you enter into a relationship with will have had a past, whether you like to think about it or not. All of those people will have meant something to your SO at some point or another in their life, and they've made your SO into who they are today. Personally, I find it a little immature when people are like ""oh I don't want to hear about any of your exes"". If anything, conversation about them is probably good, as it can identify areas where relationships went wrong and you can make sure not to do the same things."
gaybros,3dqoq0,Maxpowr9,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:45:55 2015 UTC,Exactly. It's more important to know why they broke up with an ex than if they're still friends with an ex. I could go through many hypothetical situations and/or red flags of why people split up but it's important to have that conversation at some point in the realtionship.

At first it stemmed a bit from my own insecurity and my own inexperience. I'd never really had a boyfriend for any long period of time.   But eventually my jealousy died down a bit, and the more I met the guys, the more I knew that whatever there was is now over, and that he had a good reason to stay friends with some of the guys he's dated, to the point where I've become friends with them as well.  Also, the older you get, the less reasonable it becomes to not expect your boyfriend/SO to have past experiences. You just hope that you both have learned from these experiences and use them to further your own relationships."

Over the years, I have liked some and disliked others, though I am generally indifferent about them to begin with.   If my SO chooses to remain friends with an ex, I assume that he has a reason for doing so. I am not an overly jealous person (don't read that as overly trusting... I just don't get terribly jealous about stuff like this) so I don't have an issue with him hanging out/seeing exes. I have found that I have dated people who get jealous/insecure/weird when it comes to talking about exes — more so if a relationship is maintained with one. I am not sure where that insecurity comes from but it is not a viewpoint that I can relate to. I feel that our exes and previous relationships help mold us into the people that we are today.

I saw a picture and instantly wanted to fuck him - he was super, super cute. There was a moment of insecurity because he was so much more petite than I, but from what I've heard he's very immature and materliastic. His other ex was 41 when he was 23. So weird / fascinating to me; the idea of an older man dating a younger top. I give my partner shit about that all the time, but he doesn't like to talk about it too much because I believe they ended on very bad terms. I'd have no problem with my exes meeting / talking to my current partner,but he isn't interested at all. He's not opposed it just doesn't cross his mind. Edit: OH, totally forgot - I'm actually sort of freaked out / uncomfortable about his first ex - since it was a girl. His longest relationship was with his high school sweetheart, who I guess he dated for 8 years. Since I'm a ""gold star gay"" (never gone past first base with a girl) it sometimes creeps me out knowing my partner was in a monogamous relationship with a woman."

That was my first relationship so it had a really profound impact on me and how I perceive relationships in general. However I do realize that not everything and everyone is bad.

gaybros,3dnrfh,vagenda,7,Fri Jul 17 20:26:20 2015 UTC,"No, that song is just a classic of our times.  Actually, apparently she's just finally sorted out a lot of issues with her label where they were refusing to release her music and also not letting her go from her contract, so I wouldn't be surprised if her new label was trying to give her a bit of a push before a comeback attempt soon."

gaybros,3dnrfh,tescocola,11,Fri Jul 17 22:13:59 2015 UTC,"But the more I thought about this - what happens if the guy's wife was ok with this? What happens if he's Bi and allows him to do this with other guys? The basic fact is, we don't know what's going on in their relationship.  So that means the only bit of Gawker's defence is that extortion was involved, but it was by no means of great proportions at that stage. By exposing, and therefore stopping the extortion by basically ruining the guy's life is a terrible defence - anyone with a brain cell could see that would happen.  Which leaves me to conclude that Gawker knew someone else would publish it if they didn't (because someone else would've done that), so they didn't want to miss a story that might've gone their way."

We only see these types of situations in small spurts. There are many many guys out there that are know figures and sleep with others. only a very small percent get found out. So while an open marriage may not be the case, it's completely plausible. And truth is, we truly don't know the situation. Could be an open marriage or they could be separated or he could just be a scumbag. But it's not our place to decide for him and then tell the world."

gaybros,3docmw,mooglesama,11,Sat Jul 18 03:03:21 2015 UTC,"When my special gaybro and I started flirting with each other, he was a very different guy.  He had this pair of really ugly worn through Vans which I always used to criticize.  There was a certain charm to his sloppiness–he was unkempt, but forgiveable since we were both grad students.  While writing our papers at school we would take breaks by walking out to Lake Michigan.    Eventually, we stayed together, graduated, and we each got better jobs than in grad school.  He started making a little bit of money, and gradually worked on his appearance.  I guess a little bit of money went a long way for both of us.  About two years ago, I was amongst the finalists for a job.  Oddly enough it had come down to me and another fellow colleague of mine from the same school and program.  When I received the news that I didn't get the job, my immediate defense mechanism was to become stoic.  The rest of the day, through dinner, I was quiet, didn't speak much, and was pretty irritable.  I cleaned the kitchen, and he asked if I wanted to take a walk through the park to vent a little (I guess we've always taken a lot of walks, just realizing this now).  When he came down the stairs, he was wearing his old jeans and those same ugly Vans that I always criticized and made fun of.  As he approached me, I immediately broke down, hugged him, and started crying my eyes out.  I don't even know where he kept those shoes, but in a single gesture, he said so much. He pointed to our years together, our struggles together, and to how far we'd come since we first met.  I understood it as his way of saying he wasn't disappointed in me for not getting the job, and for how much he was willing to still be with me.   To this day that moment plays in my head and I get a little teary-eyed.  Through thick and thin, that guy still wants to take me out on a walks."

We broke up over something petty after a few months. We remained in touch over the next 4 years. I dated and fell in love with someone else who broke my heart and left me. Literally two weeks after that, on my 23rd birthday he sent me a 'happy birthday' text at the stroke of midnight. Right then and there, I knew he still loved me after all this time. So I reached out to him, we started talking and we were married a year and a half later. He pisses me off to no end, but he's also the most wonderful man and my best mirror. I can't imagine what life is like without him and I really don't want to. But yeah, I knew when he texted me on my birthday. :-)"

They embody the typical gender roles of women, hence why they wouldn't be seen as attractive to a majority of gay men.

gaybros,3dogsm,thomthom93,10,Fri Jul 17 23:04:07 2015 UTC,"my secret is actually myfitnesspal...  I can keep track of how much I eat and it tells me how much I can eat to lose how much weight. I've actually logged pretty much every meal for nearly the last two and a half years.   Other than that, I currently try and get around .85 grams of protein per pound of body weight, and I do a strength training routine called Stronglifts. I highly recommend it for beginners, but I also have a gym that's right near me which is really convenient. At the end of the day if you can't work out you can still drop some pounds by strictly food, but doing a strength routine when you're a beginning lifter has the amazing ability to build muscle AND lose fat at the same time.  for motivation, I truly believe that discipline is what's more important than motivation. It's important to have the discipline to get things done, because it's impossible to be motivated every day. That way, when I do feel motivated it just means I'm going to go extra hard during my workout, but I do my workout no matter how motivated I am.   Specific food wise, there's no better meat for you than chicken. It's super lean, super protein rich, and has truly been my key to success. Unfortunately it's expensive, but while living at home I make my parents by it for me!!!"

I'm not suggesting that you starve yourself. However, exercise alone will not do much if you don't pay attention to what you're eating as well.   Watch out for ""health food"" labeling and jargon foods. This is stuff like fruit smoothies, restaurant salads, health bars, protein shakes. A lot of people mistake these ""healthy"" choices for low calorie. Putting a cucumber in something doesn't make it healthy. Unless it's a gin and tonic - that's just fucking delicious."

gaybros,3dogsm,sjsalazar,6,Sun Jul 19 21:45:44 2015 UTC,"I realize I am repeating what others have said, but diet is probably the most important part of weight loss. I am 22 years old and also 5 ft 8. I went from 230 to around 137 over the course of a year and a half mainly by changing my eating habits. You have to relearn how to eat. I had absolutely no idea how much I was eating until I wrote it all down one day. It was eye-opening. I used to equate feeling full with being satiated, which is a dangerous mindset to have. Now, I treat calories like money. I have appx 1500 dollars a day. If i spend more than that, I have to ""pay it off"" the next day by eating less. It's amazing what changes once you start losing weight. There are other, less-surprising victories than wearing smaller clothes. I remember how thrilled i was when I realized I no longer needed clinical strength antiperspirant. Oh and one last thing, taking into account your height, 180lbs will still classify you as medically overweight. Aim for 160! It's important to have a truly healthy weight as your goal. I suggest you discover your reason for embarking on this journey. ""I want to look good at the bars"" might not be enough to get you through the days when you want to say fuck it/go on a food binge. I received an emotional kick in the ass in the form of my grandpa, a former athlete and military man, losing his battle to Parkinson's.

I started losing weight because I finally realized that I can't rely on other people's view of me to be my drive. I'm eating healthier and exercising more because I don't want to run out of breath while playing ultimate with friends, climbing up a mountain, or missing out on making new friends while running 10k's or (gasp) marathons!

gaybros,3dogsm,Humanunkind,2,Mon Jul 20 17:14:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just wanted to chime in with everyone else, definitely diet.  So far I have lost over 150lbs (need to lose at least that much again to be near a healthy weight, but I might be able to do that by this time next year), I mainly did this by eating better foods, eating around 2000 calories or less (I'm aiming for 1500), and I also go for a 60 minute walk with my german shepherd 5 days a week."
gaybros,3dogsm,zap283,2,Mon Jul 20 21:45:28 2015 UTC,"I lost about 120 pounds 7 years ago.  I was about 320 pounds and 6'2"".  These things really helped me in the long run:   As much as you read - there is no magical formula for weight loss, muscle gaining, and whatever.  If you want to loss weight, eat less in total.  If you want to gain size(muscle), you need to eat more(note: this is in tandem with a proper lifting routine).  As for what to eat - eat clean.  Try Keto or Paleo if you need a guide.  Get up and do something for an hour every day.  Sitting on that couch can only do so much with a calorie loss.  In the beginning I walked 3-5 miles a day.  After some time, I started to jog, then sprints, then the rest is history.  It is okay to cheat every once in a while.  Don't get so bogged down about every freaking calorie.  If you really want that bagel... have a little bit of it in moderation.  I usually have a cheat meal once a week.  Nothing crazy but every Saturday night when SO and I go out to eat, I don't need to stress about what to get.   Stay off the scale.  Just take my advice.  Getting on that foul thing will cause you to go mental.   Motivation - stay motivated.  Find something to work towards.  For me in the beginning it was fitting into a pair of jeans I fell in love with.  Every two weeks or so I would try them on, noticing I was getting closer and closer to a proper fit.  Then when they finally did fit...holy space balls, I was so happy.   Good luck and have fun with the journey!"
gaybros,3dogsm,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:32:47 2015 UTC,"As has been mentioned before me, weight loss is built in the kitchen.  Plenty of people will offer you diets, tips, tricks, and so on, but really it's just calories in vs calories out.  My fitness Pal is a great app for tracking what you eat.  If you track your calories and still aren't losing weight, you're either underestimating how much you're eating or overestimating how many calories you're expending.  Resistance training can be helpful, but its main function during weight loss would be to help you minimize the loss of muscle tissue. I'm not sure about Planet Fitness, but many gyms will offer a basic plan, usually based on using the machines.  The machines aren't quite as good as free weights, as they don't work as many muscles (especially what are called 'stabilizer muscles), but they're excellent for getting started and forming the gym habit.  Also, unlike free weights, it's almost impossible to hurt yourself with machines, and you can't get the lifting form wrong.  If Planet Fitness doesn't have anything like that, check with your health insurance to see if they have any subsidized memberships."

gaybros,3dogsm,joealexjohn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:30:25 2015 UTC,"180 lbs at 5' 8' would still be unhealthy unless you were jacked beyond belief.  At your height you should be 140-160 lbs.  Being super big doesn't make you healthy anyway, a lot of guys use protein shakes which aren't the greatest for you health and can be damaging on the liver.   You are lucky you are your size though because in the process of losing weight you can gain muscle mass, and since you already have fat your body can convert that in muscle mass. It is a lot hard for someone like me (5' 9"" at 155 lbs) to gain mass because I have to eat a shit tonne of food to do so; I refuse to use protein shakes.  Best thing you can do is count your calories and makes sure you aren't going over what you NEED, and that should be around 2,500-3,000 calories, but since you are already large I'd be eating 2,500. That includes counting your DRINKS, ALCOHOL, and everything from KETCHUP you put on things. 2,500 calories is still a lot of food if you are eating the right foods.  Fruits and vegetables are the best way to keep yourself satiated so you dont wanna eat more, and you can actually loose weight feeling full all the time by doing this. I personally eat too many fruits and veggies; by choice I don't want to be as thin as I am but I just don't like most fatty and sugary foods, , and it's the reason I am so thin, I hate it because I feel full all the time but I know I'm not getting enough calories. So take it from someone who is trying to gain weight, do what I do, and eat lots of veggies/fruits, they will thin you out pretty fast.  When I say eat fruits and vegetables, I mean eat like two whole cucumbers in one sitting, you will feel full from that and it's like 120 calories.  Also foods high in protein will make you feel full quicker.  I also only eat when I am hungry, I never eat if my stomach is not starving; which could be why I'm so skinny again I hate being this skinny but its what I am naturally, so try to listen to your stomach and not your brain when it comes to eating.  Don't let those guys get to you! You can do it, and it's good you are deciding to do this now. I think it could be worse, you could be me and be unable to gain weight. I once ate 3,500 calories worth of food everyday for a month(I didn't count my drinks or alcohol at all in this) and I still somehow managed to only gain 2 fucking lbs, it is frustrating as fuck(could be the fact I'm really active though), I wish I was your size and could have the potential to be jacked, because like you said, seeing all those fit guys does make you feel bad(I'm not in bad shape I'm just not jacked, and could outrun most of the ""gym"" giants)."

gaybros,3dlf0h,iongantas,3,Fri Jul 17 21:33:55 2015 UTC,"They can, but in this case the courts have been reluctant to accept the argument (that discrimination by sexual orientation is a form of sex discrimination). It was one of the primary arguments in Obergefell v. Hodges recently, but Kennedy chose to protect gay identity more fundamentally rather than on such a technicality. Since Congress refuses or is unable to act, the Obama administration has been putting a great deal of effort into reinterpreting existing statutes wherever possible. The downside is that future administrations are given the same leeway to reinterpret them less broadly. At the same time, there's SCotUS precedent preventing individual liberties from being revoked without just cause or rational basis, and the argument the EEOC relies on has gained legal steam and recognition, but it's likely that the courts would overturn such a reinterpretation since Congress has tried (and repeatedly failed) to legislate the issue, which is strong evidence they never intended for the statute to be read in this way. However, because an overwhelming majority of Americans believe you shouldn't be able to discriminate against gays in employment (even more believe you already can't, even though you currently can in most states), it's very unlikely that a future administration would touch the issue (especially if we have 4-8 years of HRC between now and the next Republican president).  TL;DR: They can, but they haven't; they probably wouldn't, but chances are nobody will ever give them a reason to decide either way. So it's up to Congress and the agencies who enforce the statutes."
gaybros,3dlf0h,neofreakx2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:48:17 2015 UTC,"This is true, and I agree with it. I'd just add that employment law (unless the employer is the government) is NOT protected by the Constitution. It's protected by a statute called Title VII.   You're right about Congress debating adding sexual orientation to the ""protected classes"" of Title VII and explicitly refusing to do so. Because this is purely a statutory issue, if this were to go up to the Supreme Court, I think they would probably resoundingly overturn the EEOC -- wouldn't even be close.   BUT, Obergefell does lay the foundation for finding sexual orientation to be a so-called ""suspect class."" My guess is that in the next two or three terms, we'll get a case ruling that discrimination based on sexual orientation is subject to ""intermediate scrutiny"" -- that means the court will review it like it would review discrimination based on sex.  You have to remember though, that the Constitution only protects people from the government, not their scumbag employers. That's why we need an act from Congress expanding Title VII to include us!"

On one hand I want to celebrate it solely as a cultural festival but on the other hand, considering how genocidally homophobic Islam is, I don't want to do anything that has Islamic undertones. I haven't bought new clothes yet as a result and Eid is tomorrow. What to do, what to do?  Edit: I've given it some thought and I've decided to go celebrate it with my extended family.

I'm not out to anyone else though because leaving Islam carries the death penalty in my country (plus there's also the chance of getting murdered by a religious person; I wish I were kidding).  When I was in my early teens Islam's homophobia was the main thing that made me doubt Allah's existence and Islam as a whole. Over time, as I developed a more detailed understanding of the religion, things like its contradictions with science, sexism, condoning of wife-beating, sex with slavegirls and children, finding out about Muhammad doing immoral things, etc. all sealed the deal for me."

gaybros,3dj6nx,shzadh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:17:46 2015 UTC,"Well there's the fact that Muhammad had sex with Aisha when she was just nine years old, he had all the dogs of Medina killed out of superstition, he approved the mass murder of all of Banu Qurayza's men (even minors if they had pubic hair), he owned slaves and even fathered a child with one i.e. Maria Al-Qibtiyya (even though Islamic apologists these days try to pass her off as one of Muhammad's wives), etc.  Muhammad also commanded this (though I'm willing to assume that this was an eye for an eye punishment, but it's still not something you'd expect from someone purported as a 'Mercy to the Worlds', you know?).  In b4 someone tries to use Islamic apologetic arguments, I'm well aware of them. They weren't convincing even back when I was Muslim."

And according to Islam, Muhammad is the exemplary, perfect human being that Muslims of all eras are suppose to imitate. So this action of his is even more unforgivable than a random 7th century person marrying a child."

gaybros,3dj6nx,SurfingTheCosmos,2,Fri Jul 17 18:22:54 2015 UTC,"But millions of Muslims do not believe he did those awful things you mentioned.   [citation needed]  From my own experience most of them are well aware of at least the massacre of Banu Qurayza, his marriage to Aisha when she was six years old, the fact that he permitted slavery and that he had a son with Maria (and that he commanded the death penalty for men who have sex with other men). We were taught all this at school (Islamic studies is a compulsary subject). A fair number also seem to know that he had sex with Aisha when she was nine (though I've noticed many young people go into denial about this now that the view that pedophilia is wrong is becoming dominant).  But anyways, what is your point? I do not see how their personal ignorance of their Prophet's life is an excuse for him to commit those immoral acts. It seems you think I'm beseeching you to form an opinion on Muslims via my comments whereas I'm not."
gaybros,3dj6nx,habitushabitat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:26:06 2015 UTC,"Muhammad married a 6 year old child named Aisha, and consummated the marriage when she was only 9 years old. I'd say that's pretty immoral.    From the hadith of the Sunan of Abu Dawud, volume 2, #2116  ""Aisha said, ""The Apostle of Allah married me when I was seven years old."" (The narrator Sulaiman said: ""Or six years.""). ""He had intercourse with me when I was 9 years old.""    From the hadith of Bukhari, volume 5, #234  ""Narrated Aisha: The prophet engaged me when I was a girl of six. We went to Medina and stayed at the home of Harith Kharzraj. Then I got ill and my hair fell down. Later on my hair grew (again) and my mother, Um Ruman, came to me while I was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became all right, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said, ""Best wishes and Allah's blessing and a good luck."" Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage). Unexpectedly Allah's messenger came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to him, and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age.""    From the hadith of Bukhari vol. 7, #65:  ""Narrated Aisha that the prophet wrote the marriage contract with her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old. Hisham said: ""I have been informed that Aisha remained with the prophet for nine years (i.e. till his death)."""
gaybros,3dj6nx,SurfingTheCosmos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:41:03 2015 UTC,"Could you elaborate on this comment? You say in another comment that you're from Pakistan, but practicing other religions is legal there and I've never heard of legal killings for leaving Islam. Am I misinformed or am I not understanding your comment correctly?"
gaybros,3dj6nx,habitushabitat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:03:22 2015 UTC,"I'll be happy to elaborate. In Pakistan you can practice religions other than Islam freely[*] and you can convert to Islam but you are not allowed to leave Islam for another religion or atheism (that carries the death penalty). Pakistani law is basically a mixture of British colonial law and Islamic law (Sharia). Our constitution itself does not have any laws against apostasy but:   Pakistan's constitution defers gaps in its penal code to Sharia, and the lack of law on apostasy and lack of right to convert from Islam to another religion in Pakistan's law implies apostasy defaults to Sharia.  Further, Pakistan has blasphemy law that carries death penalty, but the law does not define blasphemy. Under Article 295-C of its penal code, any Pakistani Muslim who feels his or her religious feelings have been hurt, directly or indirectly, for any reason or any action of another Pakistani citizen can accuse blasphemy and open a criminal case against anyone. (Source)   Our constitution also recognises the supremacy of Islam, says ""all existing laws shall be brought in conformity with the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Qur'an and Sunnah and no law shall be enacted which is repugnant to such injunctions"", support for killing apostates is high, as is support for making Sharia the law of the land, so the situation isn't going to get better any time soon and even if apostasy does become legal by law somehow, there's still a fair chance that someone might kill you extra-judicially if you're open about it.  Here's a map of Muslim-majority countries that have penalties for apostasy.  You might find this useful too.  Sidenote:  [*] Ahmadis are a religious minority that claim to be Muslim but are considered to be non-Muslims from the point of view of mainstream Islam and most Pakistani Muslims (because many Ahmadi beliefs are different from regular Islam). Their religious freedom is restricted by Pakistani law."

gaybros,3dj6nx,amkamins,-1,Fri Jul 17 02:33:29 2015 UTC,"The same way Christian gays reconcile sexualised and faith I suppose.   I acknowledge that under my religion gay sex is a sin.  On the other hand it is a sin just as slander, wife-beating (sadly common), idle gossip, premarital sex, etc is. No man is free from sin and I just list being gay as a constant issue. Which fortunately harms no one.   I Pray five times a day, I fast, I pay my alms, and just last year I went for umrah in Mecca. In fact it was there that I felt like me being gay would not stand in the way of my faith because in religion there is no right answer.   Islam is divided into so many sects. We have the big Shia and Sunni divide. And even under Sunni there are four schools of thought, and theres just subtle differences in practice of faith.   For example a woman doing the umrah is explicitly forbidden to cover their face under the Syafie school, but it does not apply to the other schools. I doubt God would be so tied up with this difference and will accept your devotion to Him regardless of the way you do it.   TLDR I'm gay but still devoted Muslim because I acknowledge my flaw but I beleive Allah would look to my faith rather than my imperfections of which everyone has."

I generally agree with your comment (though a slight clarification: Islamic architecture is just a catch-all term though for the local architectures of places where Muslims live. As you know the Islamic faith itself doesn't have any guidelines for what style of buildings to build).  I even admit there are some practices that Islam promotes which are good (e.g. charity, respecting your elders, etc. though these aren't unique to the religion) but overall I think the ultraconservative culture that Islam's teachings promote isn't good."
gaybros,3dj6nx,SurfingTheCosmos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:38:07 2015 UTC,"Islam teaches that men who have sex together (i.e. do what Lot's people did) should be killed   That depends on who you ask.  The Hanafi school, which was dominant in the Ottoman Empire, did not believe in execution for homosexuality. (However, there may have been other punishments, depending on the judge, including prison or whipping. And other schools, like the Hanbali, did believe in the death penalty for homosexuality.)  Amongst today's Muslim-majority countries, 20 have no law against same-sex intercourse. (However, in 10 Muslim-majority countries, it's punishable by death. A further 17 countries are somewhere in between.)  The Quaranist movement, though not large, doesn't believe homosexuality to be a sin at all.  I'm not saying the situation is great, and nor am I trying to persuade you to remain a Muslim. But I also don't think it's quite as black-and-white as you say. Seeing things in black-and-white is the way of extremists, and it would be a shame to let their view become dominant."
gaybros,3dj6nx,mahbio,-1,Fri Jul 17 03:59:10 2015 UTC,"It's underhanded that you're trying to portray mainstream Islamic opinion as an extremist point-of-view and claiming the issue isn't black-and-white when Islam is clear on this matter (I linked to ahadith from two of Islam's six most authoritative books of ahadith). I hope you realise you're whitewashing Islam's human rights record and denying the experience of gay Muslims and ex-Muslims alike who go/went through hell because of their belief in Islam by claiming the religion isn't as homophobic as it actually is.   The Hanafi school, which was dominant in the Ottoman Empire, did not believe in execution for homosexuality.    The Hanafi school of jurisprudence is dominant in Pakistan too, where I live, and I do not know of any scholars that say homosexuals should not be executed. From what I read back when I was Muslim, it does permit the death penalty for repeated 'offenses' if not the first homosexual offense. Indeed, Imam Abu Hanifa (the founder of the Hanafi school) himself stated in his book, Kitab al-Athar, that ""sodomites"" have the same status as adulterers. And we all know (I hope) that adulterers are to be stoned to death according to Sharia.  It's common to see fringe opinions being passed off as mainstream ones on Wikipedia articles on Islamic topics. It's peculiar that out of all the scholars, they've mention only one (Abu Bakr Al-Jassas) who claimed the relevant ahadith aren't reliable while failing to mention the other scholars that have graded those same ahadith Hasan Sahih (i.e. they're reliable). However, they did mention that Muhammad's companions (who hold more authority than scholars) believed in execution for sex between men, I'll give them that:   There were varying opinions on how the death penalty is to be carried out. Abu Bakr recommended toppling a wall on the evil-doer, or else burning alive,[30] while Ali bin Abi Talib ordered death by stoning for one ""luti"" and had another thrown head-first from the top of a minaret—according to Ibn Abbas, this last punishment must be followed by stoning.[27]  Amongst today's Muslim-majority countries, 20 have no law against same-sex intercourse.    20 out of 57. FTFY. Muslim countries do not necessarily follow Sharia (Islamic law). In places where Sharia is followed, homosexual relations are punishable by death.   The Quaranist movement, though not large, doesn't believe homosexuality to be a sin at all.   You do know that Quranism is only fringe movement that purports to be Islamic, right? It makes no sense. The ahadith are the second source of Sharia after the Quran. How can they follow Sharia, make sense of the Quran, the contexts of the revelation of its verses, the exegesis of the verses, etc without referring to the ahadith?  The Quran permits men to beat their wives if they disobey them. But the severity of the beating and the body parts that can be struck are outlined in the hadith, not in the Quran. Do Quranists go on beating the crap out of their wives then? How do they even offer obligatory daily prayers because the method of prayer is found in the ahadith, not the Quran?  And how do you kniow homosexuality isn't a sin in Quranism? And by ""homosexuality"" do they mean the orientation or the sexual activity? Judge for yourself, from the following verses, does it seem like the Quran seems to views homosexual activity as anything other than sinful, immoral, unnatural and a transgression against Allah's law:   And [We had sent] Lot when he said to his people, ""Do you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds? Indeed, you approach men with desire, instead of women. Rather, you are a transgressing people."" (Quran 7:80-81)  The people of Lot denied the messengers. When their brother Lot said to them, ""Will you not fear Allah ? Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger. So fear Allah and obey me. And I do not ask you for it any payment. My payment is only from the Lord of the worlds. Do you approach males among the worlds. And leave what your Lord has created for you as mates? But you are a people transgressing."" They said, ""If you do not desist, O Lot, you will surely be of those evicted."" He said, ""Indeed, I am, toward your deed, of those who detest [it]. My Lord, save me and my family from [the consequence of] what they do."" So We saved him and his family, all, except an old woman among those who remained behind. Then We destroyed the others. (Quran 26:160-172)   Edit: Added links about ahadith."

Sometimes ideas that seem ancient can be surprisingly modern.   The Hanafi school of jurisprudence is dominant in Pakistan too, where I live, and I do not know of any scholars that say homosexuals should not be executed.   I don't actually know what Hanafi scholars wrote, and I admit that I'm relying on Wikipedia's (possibly unreliable) version of what took place in the Ottoman empire. But what I do know is that most countries that were formerly part of the Ottoman empire do not have the death penalty for same-sex activities (most of them have no laws about it at all), so I suspect Wikipedia is correct that such acts were not punishable by death in the jurisprudence of the Ottoman empire.  Of course, Pakistan was never part of the Ottoman empire.   20 out of 57. FTFY.   Yeah, I can add.   Do Quranists go on beating the crap out of their wives then? How do they even offer obligatory daily prayers because the method of prayer is found in the ahadith, not the Quran?   Okay, what you're saying is that the hadith are valuable, and are fundamental to the religion, and I agree with that. I'm not here to defend Quranism, and I'm not here to defend the idea of throwing out all the hadith.  But there is a more general movement which believes the hadith should be disregarded when they contradict the Quran, and I think there's a lot of merit in that idea. Specifically, it would mean eliminating the death penalty for homosexuality and apostasy.  (The laws against apostasy in countries like Pakistan are especially troubling because they stifle discussion and debate about Islam in those countries. It makes even the slightest reformers afraid to express their views.)   does it seem like the Quran seems to views homosexual activity as anything other than sinful, immoral, unnatural and a transgression against Allah's law   Look, my opinion on that doesn't matter.  What matters is the fact that there is no prescribed punishment for same-sex activity in the Quran, which is good scriptural grounds for not executing gay men."

Why is the race of his potential partner so important? Honestly, it really doesn't matter to me at all.

Unfortunately, we live in a world where public displays of gay affection are political, not personal acts, so I think a certain degree of pre-established intimacy is needed before you do it.  For first dates, you want everything possible to go right, and when you hold hands, you basically open yourself up to all kinds of things that could spoil that first night: homophobes shouting faggot at you, ""allies"" commodifying you and saying ""oh you're so cute!,"" shit like that.  This video explains it really well in basically the most eloquent drag queen TED talk I've seen.  Basically, for first dates you want to keep things light and feel out how comfortable the other guy is with PDA.  Start off with careers, PG interests, funny anecdotes, and if you hit it off, you can delve into the inevitable ""How out are you"" and ""How did your parents take it"" conversations that I find always brings a sense of intimacy between the date and me.  Holding hands in private spaces, like in a car or body language like leaning forward or brushing legs against each other is more effective first date flirting, I feel.  And don't necessarily attribute your date going badly as you being insecure about your homosexuality.  Every gay guy experiences this so they can sympathize.  I draw the line at self-hating or shitting on other types of gay men.  So long as you're not doing that, just be as expressive and open as you're comfortable being on a first date.  Good luck!"

gaybros,3dinhf,crmd,6,Thu Jul 16 19:06:16 2015 UTC,"I may have some insight for you, but I believe you will find your way.  I was raised Christian. Went to church 3 times a week and such. Long story short, my parents were very understanding when they found out but my extended family not so much.  I was fairly religious myself growing up and also tried to change, and even get minor help from my church. Always felt guilty when I couldn't change my attraction. Lied awake and cried all night the first time I kissed a guy. Eventually got to the point where I would start to lose my composure the second I walked into my church.  For me, a part of it was my falling out of religion. It's not my place to guide you on this one, but it did help me. I wouldn't be the person I am today without that aspect and I feel like I am fully comfortable with nearly every aspect of my life, especially the queerer aspects.  Another part of it was throwing myself in those positions and making myself uncomfortable. You can only experience those ""reactions"" (as you put it) for so long before it becomes a normal aspect of your life. Less than two years after losing sleep over a kiss, I was going to prom with a dude. It was pretty much downhill after that.  There will always be times that you will need to step out of your comfort zone to effectively change the ""nurture"" aspect of your mentality but it seems like you are already well underway.

If you're not sure how the call's going, just ignore it / mute it. If the date's going well, pick up and say, ""hey, gonna have to call you back - kinda in the middle of something important right now"" then apologize profusely once you get off the phone.

gaybros,3dinhf,Hussain1993,2,Fri Jul 17 12:48:25 2015 UTC,"My advice: be patient with yourself!  Your inner outing seems out of step with your outer one. This has happened to a lot of us! You internalised all this right wing, religious homophobia in your childhood and youth. Your emotions and your conscience need time to get rid of it. Your disgust, self hate and negative feelings will fade away, the more you confront yourself with other gay guys, gay movies, gay porn, homosexual intimacy, love and sex. Just be patient and don't stop. Watch some good gay movies and read some gay love stories. If you watch porn (and who doesn't?), observe your feelings. If you feel disgusted or ashamed, tell yourself, there is really no need for it. Tell yourself to relax and enjoy it instead! This won't work immediately, but over time. Your first date doesn't have to be perfect! Sometimes people need a little time to adjust. :)   Here are some good romantic gay movies, I liked: Shelter, Beautiful Thing, Weekend, Free Fall."

I've learnt that I should just do what I want to do and not care about my religious upbringing and what other people think.   I think you need to truly accept yourself before you can comfortably go out on a proper date. I looked myself in the mirror and said ""I am gay and I love you"". Its going to be a tough journey but at the end of you're going to come out as a stronger person.  In what way did the date crash and burn? Awkward silences?   Hussain"

He criticized my height, build, and outfit. He told me he could tell I was nervous and that it was awkward. I didn't wanna be creepy so I offered to drop him off anywhere he wanted instead of specifically saying his house and he told me some open lot.

gaybros,3dinhf,Waywardshrink,6,Thu Jul 16 18:00:44 2015 UTC,"When I read the post, I was thinking about how awkward my first date with a guy was after coming out at age 30, but this guy was just a jerk.   I don't know how old you are, but what I found out pretty quickly was there is little patience for guys who come out later in life and are figuring out how dating works again. It really is like being an awkward teenager at first. But I will also say that the learning curve is so much easier and things tend to smooth out much faster because a) being older and wiser has benefits and b) the comfort level of being with someone you are attracted to is so, so much higher than when you are with someone who you think you should be attracted to because society and family pressure.  I would say please don't let the first bad date cloud the others in your future. Every person is different. Every person has their baggage. The first date should be about seeing if you and the other person connect and have similar interests, sense of humor, and of course if you find each other physically attractive. But that doesn't mean it has to get physical. Like the others here said, just hang out and have fun. Create a happy memory. Get a second date."

gaybros,3dhsjt,YourFairyGodmother,2,Thu Jul 16 17:35:07 2015 UTC,"Story time!    In the 90's my company's Europe (and ME and Asia) HQ was in Amsterdam.  I would go to Europe on business three or four times a year, always preceding the working week(s) with a weekend in Amsterdam (after the first time, that is, when I flew out of PHL  Sunday evening to arrive at LRH seven or eight hours later early Monday morning then proceed to work through the day then have to go out drinking and dining with customers, ...).  My (now-official but at that time of course unofficial) husband was certain I was spending those weekends stoned out of my gourd in brown cafes.  I assured him that I was not, I just toked up a very little.    A couple of years passed before we finally hit Amsterdam together on a Europe vacation trip.  We walked out of the train station, down the Damrak toward our hotel. ""Oh wait,"" I said, ""Lets pop into this 'coffee shop' (brown cafe) - it's my favorite."" As soon as we walked in the door the proprietor called out ""Mr. _____! So nice to see you again!""  Busted, big time.   The boy brothel made for an amusing story too but I'll save that for another time."

gaybros,3dhsjt,FridgeParade,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:17:45 2015 UTC,"Dutch native here!  Couple of touristy things you probably want to try out: -Go on a canal tour. -Visit the Rijksmuseum, especially the dutch masters gallery is stunningly beautiful. -Visit van Gogh museum. -Eat dutch Pancakes at The Pancake Bakery (near Anne Frank House), order one with apple & cinnamon. -Walk around a lot starting at the Dam Square, the city is basically one giant museum so whatever direction you choose you will discover new things. -Take a stroll along the flower market. -If you want to go out there is the Reguliersdwarsstraat which a street with lots of gay bars and shops. -Beware of bikes, the dutch learn to ride them around age 5 and it is one of the main ways of getting around. Speeds can be high and people will get very angry at you for not paying attention. Nobody wears helmets as it is considered lame.  And this is one that many tourists don't do but I do recommend it if you really want to see the Netherlands instead of the touristy experience that is called Amsterdam: Depending on how long you are in the Netherlands, get on a train to Utrecht from Amsterdam Central Station. Be sure to get a seat next to a window as you will be crossing polders, windmills and dykes during the 30 minute journey. Once in Utrecht, walk into the city center and enjoy a completely non-touristy authentic dutch city. For a view of what to expect, here is a photo. The Hague (seat of government) is also really pretty. If you have the time, go there take a tram to the beach at Scheveningen, walk the dunes a bit and if you look back inland you can see the city lying lying lower than the sea. Trains don't cost much, every big station has an information desk that can help you out and travel time between dutch cities (excluding Groningen, Leeuwarden and Maastricht in the far north and south) are almost always below 70 minutes. Almost everybody here speaks English, young people especially are fluent and especially outside of Amsterdam people like to help tourists to find their way.  Have fun!"

It's really near Utrecht and The Hague. Rotterdam has lots of interesting and quirky architecture. Food wise, don't forget to try Kapsalon. It's kinda like a Doner Kebab but Lasagna style. I studied in Rotterdam on exchange for 6 months (I'm Singaporean) and really fell in love with Rotterdam and The Netherlands.  EDIT: and of course for London, a musical or two will be a fantastic experience. And don't forget to walk the bridge that goes to Big Ben during the day.

gaybros,3dbdly,nightpanda893,17,Wed Jul 15 02:59:46 2015 UTC,"The second season is getting a fair heaping of internet ridicule because apparently everybody wanted a reprisal of Mathew Mcconaughey's brooding freshman intro to philosophy musings from the first season . I might be in the minority but I find S2 to be way more watchable than season 1 mainly because the subject matter is not about the most heinous crimes imaginable but rather seedy government corruption. Season 2 is more classical and less up its own ass. Who knows, maybe they'll save the mystical bits for the end.   Season 1 had some truly beautiful landscape shots that had a genuine painterly feel to them. Season 2 in contrast seems to repeat the same industrial landscape shots each episode to mechanically change scenes. It's just not as inspired.   That said Colin Ferrell is great in it . I don't care what anybody says. People say he's just playing out the washed out corrupt wino detective with an unstable personal life and inner demons trope, but something about how Velcoro is acted and his mustache seems quintessential to me. If TD was a videogame I would totally play as Velcoro.  Woodrough and the actor who plays him is a total babe obviously and I can appreciate LGBT main characters. What I don't understand is why he is being such a bitch about accepting his sexuality. Does he not live in LA? Is it that hard for him to fit his manly-man CV with his sexuality? You would think he would have discovered /r/ gaybros by now and found some common ground :P It seems to me the writer was just fishing for something to add more tortured angsty drama to his characters lives, and OF COURSE it had to be Woodrugh's conflicted man-feelings about his tortured love for cock. smh."
gaybros,3dbdly,justadude9010,7,Wed Jul 15 02:30:19 2015 UTC,I just think he hasn't come to terms with it and he feels he needs to live up to the macho alpha male stereotype.  Hense why he proposed to his gf after railing on a dude the night before.
gaybros,3dbdly,MrBrawn,7,Wed Jul 15 02:50:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think it's important not to make any judgments about why he struggles the way he does. If, that is, the writing ripens by the end of the season. My guess is he has some kind of issue with his weird ass mother, who might show herself to be homophobic at some point. So long as the show reveals deeper reasons for his self-loathing I will accept it as more than a cheap trick to add drama."
gaybros,3dbdly,justadude9010,3,Wed Jul 15 03:55:18 2015 UTC,Let's hope but so far I just see it as him not being able to deal.  I'm absolutely curious about what this turns into and hope it is more than just angst about his sexuality.  I thought the exchange with the hookers in the club was pretty good and you can tell they knew what he was about.
gaybros,3dbdly,MrBrawn,4,Wed Jul 15 03:59:57 2015 UTC,"If it turns out he just can't deal I will be disappointed with a series I thought had true artistic potential. That's a lazy tactic. All that his inability to deal with his homosexuality would communicate is that in general being male and having same-sex attractions while living according to a certain code is a status which naturally tends to cause anxiety and mental breakdown, which is an incredibly regressive idea that the people making this show would know better than to recapitulate in front of millions of viewers as if it were some kind of shameless minstrel show. It would just prove they are grasping at straws and haven't thought through all the variables. If on the other hand there is more psychological depth behind his trauma, for instance, a homophobic mother who keeps him on an emotional tether, I might see what they were going for as authentic rather than some kind of damaging stereotype.  My call: Maybe it will end with him riding off into the sunset with his future hubby, but more likely he will end up dead. The show has too many protagonists--Ray, Ani, and Paul--and it would be unthinkable for all of them to survive. If you're looking for happy endings look elsewhere."

I think that reinforces LA. it's a dirty distopia built in a desert. Woodrough is hot, yeah but I really want to see some dimensional gay characters that aren't just coming out. His boyfriend just got some D, he has waffles, watching the game. These are priorities I can relate to."
gaybros,3dbdly,amarant88,3,Wed Jul 15 06:26:02 2015 UTC,"I think my biggest beef about it is that he has the weakest (as in, typical ) storyline out of the main cast this season. Still, I get it, and since masculinity is a running theme in this show, and I'm military and have unfortunately run into...too many guys like this (that want to be straight so bad), I can see why they would explore sexuality this season."
gaybros,3dbdly,justadude9010,4,Sat Jul 18 14:59:53 2015 UTC,"His character is metallic. All surface. He doesn't seem to have interesting opinions of motivations for doing anything that he does, but instead follows out some kind of robotic inner routine. I'm hoping the show is self-aware of this fact and is trying to make a statement, and that he slowly breaks out of it. My guess is that's too generous and he's just lazily written."
gaybros,3dbdly,amarant88,3,Sat Jul 18 17:11:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of this. I hope the writers are aware (and a few are gay so the dialog isn't cringe inducing ) and give and his buddy , who's a lot more interesting in my opinion some much needed character development."
gaybros,3dbdly,donwhitman,2,Sat Jul 18 22:02:11 2015 UTC,I like that his character is having a hard time accepting in sexuality in the time/place that he lives. To me it shows a lot of other factors that go into hiding one's sexuality. Also the relationship between him and his mom is groody 5000 so that probably has a lot to do with it too.

Through a series of comic mishaps, Zachary Quinto thinks that Hugh Jackman was hitting on him and goes on a quest across Australia to find him, while simultaneously, Hugh Jackman thought he would be a great guy for his son, Liam Hemsworth, so Hugh dispatches Liam across Australia to find Zachary Quinto. Stuff happens, the confusion is cleared up, Zachary and Liam live happily ever after.   The best part of the movie, though, is the part of the DVD commentary where Amy Schumer and Zachary Quinto have an argument over whether hers or Liam's full-frontal nude scene was better."
gaybros,3ddf9a,Dzukian,6,Wed Jul 15 23:40:35 2015 UTC,"I love the cast! I'd use the same one, except my story would be more like: Colin Firth and Victor Garber are life-partners and academics living together in a nice suburb with their protege, Zachary Quinto - a bright student of theirs who they take turns with throughout the week. Rentboy sounds so tacky but it is what it is. At fear of his disillusion, and sensing complacency in his life's station, especially since little Zach hasn't been paying any attention to his dissertation, Dads give young Zach a broken down Winnebago, a pound of hydropaunic weed and a moleskin journal and tell him not to come back till the book is full. Best friend Amy Schumer co-pilots the mission as they make their way from Washington to Texas, they cross paths with Handsome Hugh somewhere east of Utah, The sexy Aussie, a local fixture in the underground leather scene. After a hot dance on the floor, Handsome Hugh is gone around the same time that Amy returns with Liam, a cute dude who's looking to come back to the Winnebago and blaze a blunt. Zac, Liam and Amy return to the Winnebago to hotbox it where Zac waxes on about how he's gotta find Hugh. Liam say's Hugh's a friend of his and mentioned he was gonna drive to New York to start a new life in the city. Zac, Amy and Liam change course and chase down Handsome Hugh. As the trip lags on, Zac is blithely unaware of Liams intense crush on him, and Liam is also withholding the fact that Hugh is actually a closeted Mormon who leads a double life as a married man in New York, but doesn't have the heart to tell Zac. The weed disappears surprisingly fast between the three of them, and Amy cuts ties and leaves with a biker gang shorly after .In a night of drunken tomfoolery, Zac tops for the first time, with Liam and the two make passionate love the whole night. The next morning Zac still can't stop talking about Handsome Hugh, causing Liam to blow up and finally confess that he had feelings for Zac, but he can't waste any more time on a guy who can't even appreciate what's right in front of him; can't respect a man who can't see the forest through the trees. Liam doesn't tell Zac about Handsome Hugh and gets on a bus back to Utah with his tail between his legs and a bottle of Jack in a paper bag. Zac realizes Liam was right, when, beneath the condom wrappers is the moleskin he got from Dads which hasn't got more than a couple quick notes in it, and he's nowhere near Texas. Even though he's practically in New Jersey, he gives up on the idea of Handsome Hugh and in a symbolic act, lights the wristband from the club they met at on fire. In a montage showing Zac going back across America, visiting the parks and cafes and streets he'd spent with his friends but had been too blind to really see, he eventually ends up in Austin, having resorted to scribbling in the margins and on the back cover of the book, having run out of space. In celebration of finishing his journal, he goes to an underground leather scene (this part he leaves out of his book) under the alias Handsome Hugh and seduces a young hippy boy, hoping to set him on the same path of self discovery that lead to his awakening. He sells his Winnebago the next morning and buys a ticket back home to Dad's. Fast forward 2 years later, Liam's sitting at a cafe when he notices everyone in the cafe reading a book called ""What I learned on the road"" with a picture of a broke down Winnebago on the front cover with a trio (two guys and some chubby blonde girl). Liam runs out to buy a copy and realizes that Zach had his spiritual awakening, he never went to see Handsome Hugh and that Liam was the love of his life right before his eyes. The movie concludes with him closing the book at a cafe and hearing an obnoxious, hungover woman counting out change at the counter for a coffee. It's Amy, tired of a life of simple whoring and scoring on the open road is down to her last pennies, hitchhiking her sorry ass back to Washigton. ""Wanna ride?"" he says, swinging keys around his finger. (sorry I didn't meant for that to be so long - I just started writing and couldn't stop!)

With the exception of a few people, everyone gets drained from extended interaction with people.  Everyone needs their alone time, and I don't know anyone that goes to a bar to relax and clear their head.  What I'm trying to get at is that although charismatic gays can be intimidating, it's not like they're exclusionary of introverts, or don't understand what it's like to be socially drained.  I myself could never dance up on the floats in the pride parade because I don't have the body for it but I never felt unwanted at parades.

gaybros,3db8ps,a_faget,11,Tue Jul 14 23:51:48 2015 UTC,"I feel like most people, especially online, tend to identify with introverts.   You may be succumbing to sampling bias (always beware when you start off with a phrase like ""I feel like [...]""). Extroverts, being extroverts, enjoy social situations like parties and bars and, therefore, don't complain about them. Introverts, being introverts, will definitely prefer discussing such matters online or in written form.  Also, the idea that socializing is a source of energy for extroverts while it drains introverts of energy is not really accurate. Aside from the very vague concept of ""energy"" or ""social energy"" that's never really defined...anywhere, I think the anecdotal observation that extroverts appear more energetic makes this explanation satisfyingly intuitive to people. The introversion/extroversion continuum is much more about the most conducive means for a person to interact with other people.  It's not that extroverts are actively excluding introverted people. It's that social gatherings are, by definition, extroverted affairs. There isn't really much anybody can do about that. As an introvert, I don't feel unwelcome at parties. I just want to be there for as short a time as possible and then leave because it's unpleasant for me. It's somewhat akin to sitting through an August graduation in an unairconditioned auditorium. It's not that you're unwelcome at the ceremony, it's that it's hot, muggy, there's no breeze, and you're just kinda there with nothing intellectually engaging to do. And, as with graduation ceremonies, sometimes, as an introvert, you just gotta suck it up and socialize. However, that doesn't mean an introvert can solve all their problems by just forcing themselves to be more extroverted. For example, if you're introverted, forcing yourself to be extroverted and trying to meet someone at a bar may not work out well because you've selected an environment which favors extroverts meaning they'll be in far greater abundance, and you'd probably get along better with another introvert.  Personally, I find the shell metaphor problematic. It very much confounds introversion with shyness and implies that introverts have a problem they need to resolve. It subtly suggests that desire to socialize is normal while preference for solitary and/or intimate activities and gatherings is abnormal. In short, it implies introverts have to change something about themselves to be successful. I prefer to think of being introverted as ""still waters run deep""."
gaybros,3db8ps,travis_zs,3,Wed Jul 15 08:07:47 2015 UTC,"Extroverts loving large parties is one of those, for lack of a better word, stereotypes that I feel gets played up way too often.  I'm an extrovert and I'm actually not that big on parties.  Or I should say I don't enjoy large or loud parties.  I will absolutely complain about parties.  I will never understand why people enjoy giving themselves hearing damage for entertainment nor do I enjoy drinking alcohol enough to get drunk.  It tastes nice but not that nice.  It's important to remember that extrovert-introvert isn't a black and white issue, it's more like a color wheel.  A person could be very dark or light indicating how introverted or extroverted they are but that's only a small part of their color, dark red isn't dark green.  They're both dark but they are not the same color.  So you can have someone like me who loves socializing in groups but not in environments that are painful for my ears or just boring because everyone is drunk.  On the other hand you can have an introvert that just doesn't like books but they love watching movies alone."

I think it may just be a difference of opinions on what constitutes a large party. Introverts probably have a very different idea of what a large party is than extroverts do. For example, I would say 10-15 people constitutes a large party."
gaybros,3db8ps,travis_zs,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:53:12 2015 UTC,"I would say a person's definition of a large party probably has more to do with their social upbringing than anything else.  Like I said, it's not always about shading it is also about coloration."

gaybros,3db8ps,Dallasbro,5,Fri Jul 17 17:05:15 2015 UTC,"For me it's not a problem of ""peeking out"" of our shell, it's about leaving some space to allow each kind of people to express themselves. I don't know where you are, but around here every single gay ""bar"" is just an excuse for a dancing hall, making it juste hard to discuss with people and meet them :) The end result for me is that it's impossible to enter a bar without already being totally drunk.  And while it's perfectly possible to peak out, I also think that bot introvert and extrovert should be able to express themselves and find a common ground. There's already waayyy too much work done on the introvert side of the plate... And you would be surprised by how much people don't understand introversion and saw the introverts as shy / anti-social (several links in the articles on that point)."
gaybros,3db8ps,a_faget,10,Wed Jul 15 00:15:16 2015 UTC,"I guess I haven't been to any bar, gay or straight, that really oriented themselves around a more relaxed atmosphere unless you go during the day.  I think that bars, regardless of target demographics, are places for quick and dense socialization, and I totally get how that can be difficult to break into.  But, yeah, I get that bars are the primary spaces for LGBT to interact, and one of the causes I think is the LGBT's development around bar culture, because for much of our history we had to be hidden about it.  Nowadays we don't have to be in the shadows but that hasn't dislodged gay bars as the central gay hubs.  I understand what you mean though.  I think gay coffee shops, or gay bookstores are kind of what you're looking for, although those are far less common than bars.  Online though is great.  I know that doesn't beat in person interaction but that doesn't mean that online interaction isn't meaningful.  All of my steps to self-acceptance came from lurking and participating in online gay forums, and I value /r/gaybros and other places I posted in for that.  Also I'm of the opinion that introverts and extroverts aren't mutually exclusive types of people.  People can have introverted days and extroverted days.  I think those two things are more akin to moods."

Like this:   While the extroverts may find it useful to be quite flamboyant, go march and things like that, I prefer to change minds by writing, talking, engaging with people in a one-to-one way, not in those kinds of celebrations.   As an extrovert I also prefer to change minds by writing, talking, engaging with people in one-to-one way (and also speaking to groups). The fact that I go to pride as a statement does not mean that I somehow keep writing and talking as inferior methods of changing the world.   Growing up and discovering I was gay, it was also easier for me to find informations in books instead of the bars, where I couldn’t relate to all those flamboyant and loudy guys.    If he's speaking about ""rainbow extroversion"", does he really equate gay extroverts being ""flamboyant and loudy guys""?   I prefer having a drink at home with some friends than going to the super-fancy-nightclub surrounded by half naked bodies.   Again here it seems that he equals extovers as people who enjoy those things. As an extrovert, I do not like ""super-fancy-nightclubs"" where I am surrounded by ""half naked bodies"".

I do best when I can have my alone time, but also when I can go to friendly and familiar social places: places where I'm likely to see someone I know, or can stay just a short while, greet some friends, and then go back home.  I don't like the hours-long investment of getting ready, driving somewhere, and spending hours at one place.    I was happiest when I lived above a coffee shop (and it was a gay-friendly coffee shop) and down the street from a bar that I liked, because I could just stop in anytime.  Often, but never for too long.    I like small social gatherings where people just come together, and you can stay a while, or leave whenever you want.    I moved to a bigger city last year and I'm honestly thinking of packing it up and going back to the smaller city where I really enjoyed life the most.  Less people, less opportunities I guess to find a date or a boyfriend... but I was comfortable there, and I felt supported there.

gaybros,3db8ps,JHFranke,2,Wed Jul 15 08:00:27 2015 UTC,"For me it's not so much the difference between extravert or introvert but more what you like to do. I went to a gaybar once, with a gay coworker, and just didn't like it that much. I just felt like I'd rather go for drinks with my straight friends, to beerpubs or at home, than to surround myself with fellow gay guys. Although I'm building on friendships with others, I discovered that I'm not alone in that. Either you love to go to those bars and prides or you don't.   My guess what the writer also meant is that it's also the non LGBT-people who think it's strange you don't go to those occasions. At least one of my friends (or more acquintance) finds it strange that, when on citytrip with the group, I don't want to go to a local gaybar. For him, and some others, it's just: You're gay so you must go to gaybars.   But sure when you just want to have a normal convo with fellow gayguys there aren't many places to go to. In my town there's a gaybar four the young people (with the loud music) and one for the older ones (so none of my age).    Guess it just all comes down to whether you like to surround yourself with fellows or not. When I came out of the closet I already had build up two fantastic groups of straight friends so I didn't had the need for more friends. While I turned my opinion about that (it's nice to be able to talk about intimate stuff without feeling awkward) I'm still not changed about the bars etc."

I like quiet stuff, one-on-one conversations, just hanging out, casual group activities, and it doesn't matter if I'm doing it platonically or (hopefully) romantically - 'cause it's exhausting and stressful to try to deal with interacting with crowds of strangers no matter who they want to sleep with.  you don't have to be a party-hearty twink or bear to be 'fully' gay. as ever, all you really need to do is want to fuck around with other dudes."

People tend to shy away from it because they hear high fat and think fat=makes you fat which just isn't true.

For when I'm working more on conditioning, I stay on paleo with sweet potatoes and other carbs(cauliflower, etc).   If you plan on lifting most of the time, keto is fantastic. I've had great results when I'm in more of a lifting phase pairing it with a keto eating style.   The first two weeks is hard for both.

Don't tell people you are doing this until you are a few weeks in. If you have to explain why are eating differently, just say you are experimenting and avoid any confrontations on what is healthy. Start small. By that I mean that you should do Lazy Keto (just generally track carbs) till you get used to it, then start weighing everything, then start intermittent fasting, and if you want 20 minute cold showers (to optimize weight loss). For a quick (two hours, use double speed)  intro, I recommend you listen to a podcast interview of Dr Peter Attia with Tim Ferris."

gaybros,3dcufy,josiahpapaya,2,Thu Jul 16 02:01:17 2015 UTC,"In contrast to the people here with success stories, I know 2 people who are doing keto. Technically 1.5 since one of them cheats all the time, but despite how much weight they've been claiming to lose, they've been doing it for 2 years and I can hardly see a difference in either of them. One guy was easily well over 250lbs and still looks pretty stout to me. The first major problem is that in order to initiate and maintain ketosis, the engineering of your body has to switch. There's no cheating or cutting corners... if you're not eating exactly the way you need to be, then you're not in ketosis and you're not eating very healthily. If you don't do the diet properly you're at risk of kidney stones, constipation AND diarrhea and the low carb threshold means you may end up crashing throughout the day from lack of sustainable fuel. My opinion is that the keto diet is for people who are disciplined by also physically quite lazy and also people who enjoy eating. Most people I know who stick to it are self-employed and highly motivated people, but are the types to prefer watching Netflix or web surfing rather than going to the gym. It's possible to do Keto and go to the gym (and some people even swear by it), but I think it's better to just eat better an exercise more; keto seems like the diet for people who want to lose weight without the exercise."

I fluctuate between 150 and 160 now, depending on whether or not I'm following the diet hard that week. I actually prefer to avoid carbs now, because the bloat that comes with them. I also think that my BMs have been a lot more regular ever since getting rid of carbs.   As far as tips go - the first few weeks are the hardest! I'd recommend not having one cheat meal at all for the first entire month. The reason for this is that starches and sugars are heavily addictive. As soon as you have a cheat day, you are not going to want to go back to your diet the next day. Once you get your cravings under control, it'll be ok to have a cheat day/meal once every 2 weeks or so. During the first two weeks you might feel nauseous or light headed randomly. This is normal, and will go away once your body has become accustomed to the diet. You can alleviate these by drinking chicken or beef broth. Really anything with a high fat/sodium content.  The worst part about keto is the pressure to eat carbs from your friends and family. You'd think that wouldn't be an issue, but it is. Your friends will want you to eat out with them, but you'll look at a menu at a restaurant and there will be nothing you can order. Or you'll be at a birthday party and somebody will be offended that you didn't have a piece of cake. Or your mom will decide that it isn't healthy that you're not eating any carbs and try to force you to eat a bowl of pasta. There is so much pressure to eat unhealthily, and you never notice it until you start a diet.  Also, the weight will totally come back once you stop. Dieting has to be a lifestyle change forever to stick. But really, you can gain back like 10-20 pounds in 2 weeks if you start eating like you did before keto (although most of it will be water weight.)"

I'm now around 150 on average and do a lot more walking and moving around and absolutely love how much energy I get from both of the diets.

gaybros,3db2vd,Knock-Off-Nigel,32,Tue Jul 14 22:04:58 2015 UTC,"I like your comment about the eyeballing thing. For me it was pretty intimidating the first time I went to a gay bar. Prolonged eye contact insinuates that you are mutually interested. I didn't know that and it lead to a couple of awkward conversations. Afterward, have a couple of drinks and see where the night takes you."
gaybros,3db2vd,howdyhooah,12,Tue Jul 14 22:20:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know what you mean. Glanced over at a few people, and probably stayed looking a bit too long and then realised what was happening. Thankfully no conversations were started"

I was there to drink and chat with some friends - whether they were looking is down to them.  Got to remember, this was my first time in a gay bar, and I was looking around just to take it all in.  I'm all for talking to people, just not yet confident enough to make a first move to converse"

gaybros,3db2vd,indomante,13,Wed Jul 15 23:03:56 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much my issue. For one, I'm way too shy to keep staring at someone or maintain eye contact with a stranger at a distance. I look immediately away if we meet eye contact. Not to mention I silently panic and try to focus on breathing and walking normal. And another thing, it (to me) feels disrespectful when I'm staring someone down. Then again, I did live near the ghetto. Looking or maintaining eye contact sometimes meant trouble or having someone ""watch your every move"" as you watched their move."
gaybros,3db2vd,blowhardV2,54,Wed Jul 15 05:22:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, eye contact is your bet.  He'll shrug or look away if he's not into you, and if he is he'll keep looking at you.  One of you should then approach the other with a smile and then talk to him like he's a human being.  Hey how are you what's up? Name's ______, how's your night going?  And go from there, you'll know pretty soon if you wanna go home with him that night, and whether that feeling is mutual."

He's not above playing match maker, and if he likes you and is aware that you're kinda shy he will introduce you to someone nice. Don't expect this on a Saturday night when the place is swamped, but come in on an off night when the crowd is reasonable and chat him up, and remember to Tip him.  I was sitting at the bar, minding my own business when a guy came in and sat at the bar: bartender poured him a beer and pointed out that it was from me. We dated for a month."
gaybros,3db2vd,romanholidays,20,Wed Jul 15 05:00:02 2015 UTC,"If your especially attractive, and/or very outgoing walking up to people at gay bars can work quite well but it's not for everybody. Walking up to someone and generating a conversation out of thin air isn't easy.  I've found its most effective to meet people through friends and friends of friends. People are more receptive, it's as lot lower stress as the common friend(s) start the conversation and they might even be able to point out a mutual interest. Several times moving to new cities I've ended up becoming friends with people who where regulars at the local gay bars and introduced me to tons of new people some of which also became friends others I dated and some just  acquaintances. It's also nice because you get an opportunity to know people beyond their physical characteristics, which can save you a lot of time from being hung up on someone who you find physically attractive but are completely incompatible with for another reason."

gaybros,3db2vd,justsomeguyinla,3,Wed Jul 15 07:52:18 2015 UTC,"I sat at a bar one time in Toronto, waiting for someone to come hit on me. I looked fucking good - I was mysterious, I had it all going on. Plus I was drinking beer, from the bottle, like a dude, amongst a sea of martinis and vodka-crans. But I sat there for hours, making idle chit chatter with the bartender who was this gorgeous 6'4, jacked as fuck blonde dude with perfect teeth who had absolutely no interest in me but I tipped him good anyway, cause I'm a dickpig like that. I sat there all night and got pretty much wasted and not a single person has come to say hello to me. I even took more trips to the john than I needed to in hopes someone would cat call me in the hallway or grab my ass or something. No dice. I've been making eyes across the bar at this older, daddy type. Looks to be mid 40's, tall, otter build... the vague appearance of maybe a former rocker or something. I probably stared at him for 2 hours and he never once looked my way and he never got up. That's when I realized that everyone at the bar is waiting for someone else to talk to them. It wasn't just me, or that nobody likes me or anything, it's just that in the Grindr era, where people are used to having relative degrees of separation  and protection, gay dudes have become socially retarded at dating. I checked the time - it was 2am. Whatever, fuck it - I get up off my chair and walk over to the guy and say, ""Look bud, I was over there staring at you for 2 hours but you haven't even looked my way. Now, I was hoping we could get to know each other, but now it's 2am, I'm drunk, and I'm sick of waiting so buy me a drink before I catch a taxi out of this fucking dump."" He sized me up, smiled, ordered me another beer and within an hour we were in his bed. Bam. So simple. Tl;DR: Have balls. Force yourself to make the first move. Everyone in a gay bar is waiting for someone to talk to them / dance with them."

gaybros,3d8rn1,believeblycool,22,Wed Jul 15 12:22:31 2015 UTC,"Think about it from the perspective of a closeted guy. That guy's outlets are:  a) any friends he has come out to,   b) visible, out gay guys who he would want to know,  c) online dating.   I graduated from Berkeley* in '07 and did not date online throughout college. The guys I met of any seriousness were:   At a frat party, a guy talked to me because he recognized me from Model UN, where I had given a speech (and was out). A friend set me up on a blind date with another gay guy she knew. I talked with a guy in my math class and tried to feel out if he was gay. Eventually, he asked me. I was an exec in the student government and one of the senators was out. We had mutual friends who recommended I ask him out, and I did. We have been together ever since (8 years).   Nothing here should be mind-blowing. If you're outgoing, confident and out you have a higher chance of meeting other guys - both closeted and out.   *(And, yes, I recognize Berkeley is an outlier on the openness spectrum. But, if anything that makes this advice more critical.)"

For example, if you listed yourself as ""men"" interested in ""men"", you could click on the second hyperlink for ""men"" and it would show you all the gay people in all of your networks. This wasn't very useful for straight people, but for gay guys, as soon as you joined a large network (like your university, or a new city) you could see all the other open gay dudes show up in a list.

It's not that the coffee is super special, but they already exist for like 200 years or so and Vienna is realy famous for their little cafés.   There is also Prater, which is a huge amusement park. It's also a very old place and back in 18th century it was opened for public. Before that, only nobles where allowed to go into parks. But the amusement thing started later. There is also the ""Wiener Riesenrad"", which is a tall ferris wheel.   Donauturm is a 250 meter high tower and you have a wonderful view of Vienna there.   Vienna also hosts some branches of UN in ""UNO-City"" (it's near Donauturm). You can visit that if you'e interested.   If you like horses you can visit ""Spanische Hofreitschule"" (Spanish Riding School). They train Lippizzan horses there.  You can also explore the city on a coach - there are quite a lot of them in Vieanna.   If you like animals in general, you should visit ""Tiergarten Schönbrunn"". It's a huge zoo.   If you like dead monarchs, you should visit ""Kaisergruft"". It's a place where all the dead Habsburger (The family which ruled Austria for hundred of years) are... located? I don't know how to explain - it's a bit bizarre. Have a look here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Crypt"

gaybros,3dbg57,fancybernd,2,Wed Jul 15 19:11:11 2015 UTC,"I went to Vienna directly after two months in Berlin and found myself comparing them a lot.  Both were largely destroyed in WWII, but they rebuilt and moved forward very differently.  In Berlin I found old and new and communist freely mingled.  People went about their lives being interesting, modern, IDGAF people.  There was variety everywhere in people, interests, architecture, speed of life, etc...  The only person I saw who turned heads was a lady riding her bike home at 9PM through former East Berlin in a wetsuit, leather corset, and fishnet facemask.    In Vienna, I couldn't tell which buildings were new and which were pre WWII.  They rebuilt just like before, the built to create a cohesive city, and their attitudes are still a little old.  They will stare if you don't fit and, and the only way to actually fit in is to have lived there your entire life or dress like them and never speak.  Shorts are for children ONLY.  Jackets are for always.  Staring if for everybody who looks slightly different.  The only place(s) this seemed to be relaxed were Donauinsel, where people hung out, tanned, played sports etc... and (to some extent) the University.  Vienna chafed at me, especially since I've been growing from a ""fit in, don't make waves"" sort of person into a ""fuck off, I do what I like"" one.  It's still nice, pretty, a good place to visit.  I just can't live there."

gaybros,3dbg57,meatb4ll,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:53:21 2015 UTC,"I just got back from three months there.  I don't know too much about bars and partying (not a big partyer, was really feeling the language barrier), but there's still a ton to do.  First a couple of huge tips. 1. Google maps doesn't have public transport.  You need to access wienerlinien.at for that.  There's a dropdown menu and you have to confirm addresses. 2. If you're flying in, you can get a €4,40 train pass into the city center.  Take the S7 to Wien Mitte/Landstraße.  Then you can take the U-Bahn wherever you need to go.  The City Airport Train is simpler but way more expensive.  MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A €4,40 TICKET INTO VIENNA AND BACK TO THE AIRPORT.  They will check, and they will fine you €60 for it. 3. If you have an android phone, topobyte.de has an offline Vienna/Wien map.  Get it, it's great.  Unfortunately it's not on iOS.  Outdoorsy things - Donauinsel.  Get off the U-Bahn (U1) at Donauinsel station, walk north (turn right) until you get to a bridge (and the U6) to Neue Donau.  It's a really nice walk, and if you're with friends, you might see some pontoons at the east side of the island from which you can swim.  For another walk, you can take the U4 to it's eastmost station (Hütteldorf, I think) and take the 52B to Hänflingweg.  From there it's a short walk to the tower, you can climb to the Jubiläumswarte a tower on top of the hill and it has great views of the city.  A little farther afield is the Weinviertel (Wine Quarter).  It's a pretty quick drive from Vienna if you have a car (which you don't if you're just in Vienna).  If you do end up around there, Josef Regner has a restaurant run by his family.  His son studied in California for a while, so he has good English and the food is excellent.  He's a weinbauer (vintner), and I like his wine.  Try the Döner.  It's a german-speaking world specialty taken from Turkey.  My favorite place was this little shack at the start of the the car-allowed part of Mariahilferstraße.  You want a ""Kalbfleisch döner mit schafkäse"".  It's really good (and if you don't ask for kalbfleisch, you'll get chicken döner.  Still good, not so good).  The pedestrian part of Mariahilferstraße is beautiful and well worth a walk, even if it's basically a huge strip mall.  The Zentralfriedhof (Straßenbahn 71) is nice to visit too, if you don't mind a cemetary of 4+ million.  Lots of people there like Schnitzler, Hedy Lamarr, Udo Jurgens and Lueger (noted racist and antisemite, dragged Vienna into the modern era, is still a hero to many there for that)  You should go to Schloß Schönbrunn, but others can tell you more about it than I can.  Same with Belvedere (Obere and Unter) and Stefansdom and the roman museum and Schottenkloster and Museumsquatier and so much more.  atlasobscura has some ideas too.  Clock museum's a little overrated.  There's also the Ringstraße.  The main building of the University is there, the Rathaus (city hall), the Burgtheater (Austrian equivalent of the Globe Theater), parks, the Opera, etc...  It's well worth a walk for a while.  Near the University's main building is Der Wiener Deewan .  They do decent Pakistani food and are pay what you like if you eat there.  I forgot a lot of what I did, but kept pictures here.  There's also Berlin and Dubrovnik and Dublin and other places, but a ton of Vienna.  The tone's a little gloomy because I grew to dislike Vienna after a while, but it's fantastic for visiting, not for living.  EDIT:  Tickets to Bratislava are €16.  Trains leave regularly (it's an hour there) from Hauptbahnhof (the main station, near the Heeresgeschichtliche Museum and after Belvedere on the Straßenbahn)  The ticket is valid the entire day and works on Bratislava's buses until around 11PM.  If you go, look up a bus map before you go.  Their English is worse than in Vienna and it's a little postsoviet.  Definitely a favorite day trip of mine."

So they need to put a picture in there. What is the picture that will simultaneously grab the most views and is applicable to the story?  Manning. There were national headlines about Manning when she announced she was transgender, so it only makes sense that they'd choose her photo to use.  Regardless of your opinions on what she did, the face is instantly recognizable and draws your eyes in for whatever reason whatsoever. That's why they chose Manning.

gaybros,3d6gyy,admiral-halbert,3,Tue Jul 14 18:11:10 2015 UTC,"All throughout history all of the individuals in this community(lgbt) have had to work together to get stuff done. One example was the passage of marriage for everyone in all 50 states. I know people from all walks of life(gay, straight, pansexual,white,black,asian,mixed, old, tall,middle class, poor etc) that believed, all Americans should be free to find and marry their true love no matter the gender.  I never hear anyone having a problem when people post stuff about gay issues, random pics of hot guys for no reason, etc. Let someone post something about Bisexual, lesbian, transgender, or intersex and lots of people lose their minds.   I know this is called gaybros but the mod includes more than just gay guys. I have seen straight guys and gals, bisexual and others posting on here too."
gaybros,3d6gyy,ShikiGamiLD,7,Wed Jul 15 02:57:13 2015 UTC,"What constitutes a fundamental imbalance in mental health is pretty much arbitrary. There are people who are, for example, inter-sex, that means that they were born with a biologically ambiguous sex. There are many people in the trans gender community who are actually inter-sex, and they don't even know it, because most inter-sex people have a aesthetic operation done soon after being born, for mostly the sake of the parents, and they alway feel like there is something wrong with them.  The transgender definition just also include people who have this sexual ambiguity on a lower lever that do not reflect on any sexual dimorphism trait, but it is still genetically determined in most cases."
gaybros,3d6gyy,MonkeyRugger,2,Tue Jul 14 11:21:17 2015 UTC,"Okay, story time. I was born intersex (ambiguous external genitalia and internal reproductive organs) raised as female and did not know that I had been operated on at 8 months and again at 4years to feminize my genitalia. The doctors told my parents to at all costs raise me as female and to confirm to me that I was female so that I'd live a normal life. I never felt like I was a girl, this is very evident in a lot of my childhood photos. After years and years of personal struggle and 2 suicide attempts my mom finally broke down and told me at 13 years old of my birth and allowed me to fully transition.  Besides my past I'm still just an average gaybro. I think an article like this is very relavent to this sub because there are a lot of us gaybros who happen to be Trans. The T is alive and well within every aspect of LGB...because we can be in T and be in any of the remaining 3 categories. Also, they allow for open discussion and further enlightenment of issues and struggles Trans* gaybros still face that other gaybros might not have to deal with it binds us together more as a group"
gaybros,3d6gyy,Kichigai,4,Sat Jul 18 09:20:48 2015 UTC,"LGB may be different from T, but that doesn't mean there aren't LGB T's. It's a historical association, from an era where homosexual activity, cross-dressing and transgender identity were all considered a family of metal illnesses. They were all corralled into the same kind of social ghettos, which inexorably fused them together.  That being said, that doesn't mean there aren't transgender folk here in /r/gaybros. In fact, I'm fairly sure there are at least a couple as we've seen in some past threads. Therefore I would say this isn't inappropriate to the subreddit.  Now, as far as ""fundamental imbalances in mental health,"" I think the American Psychiatric Association would disagree with you there. There's been a fair amount of scientific research that has gone into studying transgender folk, and it seems that there are actual neurological differences that can be measured. However, like Autism/Asberger's Spectrum this isn't something that can be resolved with a pill.  And even if this was treatable with some kind of chemical, would it even be right for all people to use it? What about side-effects? How far should one be expected to go in order to conform to societal expectations? Should they even be expected to conform? Gender is a huge part of peoples' identities, and many folks might not feel quite so comfortable in changing it so radically. I can't speak for transgender people, but it does raise some interesting questions."

There are people lifting way too much weight with absolutely terrible form. Then I see trainers walking around noticing these terrible lifts and ignoring them. Why? Because they aren't paid the ridiculous amount of money they want to teach these folks how to lift properly. I'm surprised more people don't die from going to a standard gym.   Good crossfit gyms have trainers that are supposed to coach you on how to lift properly. It comes with the cost of membership that I'm sure you've heard about. The community around crossfit is truly amazing and I've made some great friends that are motivated about all aspects of life.   The overhead lift you're talking about is an Olympic lift.

Most of the poly couples and individuals I have met and spoken with are highly evolved, highly self aware, and highly intelligent men and women. Monogamy is a choice, and it's a perfectly fine choice for some people, just as it's perfectly fine for others to choose non-monogamy. Consider your judgement and privilege checked."

I will say this much about our business; it is bad, but it is improving.  I knew of 2 openly gay Union workers on my site and I never once needed to step in or do anything to protect them.  Is it easy? NO. Should it stop you from pursuing an awesome career? Hell NO!  I would encourage you to learn as much as you can in school and then try and specialize. There are companies that make gear, VFD's, motor starters, etc that all need good electricians. Typically those guys are one man shows and spend time fixing or starting up equipment.  The pay is good and you generally interact with ""slightly"" more intelligent people.  I would like to give you one personal story of encouragement, I couldn't be out on the project I worked on because our client was Mormon and we all new that it could cost me my job if he found out.  That didn't keep me from singing Taylor swift in my office or change who I was.  All it did was keep me away from a shitbag owner.   No matter where you go, haters will hate.

So what, Hitler's right-hand SA man had been gay.  Faggots are some of the toughest men who have lived!  I could still breed and pass on my genes once I secured power and prestige for myself.  Like a lot of reactionary types, I was a fervent believer in a variant of the Great Man Theory.  That history was driven by the force of will, that strength of will could reshape the world no matter the odds.  Of course, I was going to be one of those great men.  Now when I got outed, I got disowned and ended up homeless, during which I developed a drug addiction.  So here I was, one of history's great men, living on the street and sucking dick to get high.  At the time I still clung to reactionary and racist beliefs, mostly because they were an outlet for my anger, I think.  But with time, during my healing process, I came to realize that people are predominantly shaped and driven by their circumstances.  You can play a really good game but you're stuck with the cards you were dealt.  All the strength of character in the world cannot change simple realities like not having enough money for bus fare.  Take the strongest-willed person on Earth, fuck up their sleep, give them lice, give them staph and jock itch, let them go hungry for days, let them go cold, let them be stepped over and spat on by men in suits with jobs and purpose in life, let them constantly be glared at and thought of as garbage by the rest of society, let this drag on for weeks then months and then years with no end in sight, and I guarantee you, dollars to donuts, that if you give them access to drugs you will make an addict out of them.  So much for strength of will.  No one in the developed world with money and success can honestly say, if they were born in rural Tanzania, that they'd be just where they are now.  And yet that's basically the belief we cling to, when we think we worked for or deserve what we have.  We are all victims of circumstance, for better or worse.  I also started to question my supremacist beliefs.  Blacks were inferior because they were poor, violent and uneducated and did lots of drugs.  But put noble white indomante in their social context and he was poor, violent, uneducated and doing lots of drugs.  Maybe ghetto thugs weren't genetically inferior, maybe our society made them inferior, just like it had done to me.  While it was more the way I was treated because I was gay rather than because I was gay in itself, In the end I think I'm a lot more tolerant, non-racist (though I still struggle with deeply internalized stereotypes and racist patterns of thinking), and sympathetic to the plight of marginalized people than I otherwise would have been."

The thing that probably helped me be so empathetic, more so than I can probably recognize, is my childhood and how my sister and I turned out.   I lived in a single parent home with my mother and sister, and my father was frankly a deadbeat. I saw my mom struggle and work hard for so many years until she got a well-paying job. Even then, she of course still had to work incredibly hard, and my sister didn't help with that.  My sister and I were like polar opposites in many respects. I was the logical, analytic one who would always think things through and rarely give in to impulse. My sister was creative and impulsive. How we felt about our father was also opposite. I, for many years, resented my father for not being in our life and not contributing at all. I've stopped wanting to have a relationship with him a long time ago. My sister on the other hand always held out for a relationship with him, which he took advantage of. This piece of shit man saw that he could spew his bullshit to my sister but not to me and used my sister in ways to undermine our mother.  It wasn't until after my sister dropped out of college during her second semester, lived with our father, and saw exactly what kind of man he was that she began reflecting on how she thought of him and how she acted toward our mother. I always knew from even a younger age that most of her problems growing up were daddy issues. I saw what it did to her, what it caused her to do. I'm just lucky that whatever genetics and circumstances came together for me allowed me to have the personality and perspective that I have. I have my own issues that stem from my father's absence, but those have deal with how I view people in general, my use of objectivity to avoid emotion, and refusal (which has now evolved into mere hesitance) to emotionally invest in anything or anyone.  To bring it back to the point, I think witnessing how two people perceived and handled the same situation, a situation that honestly could have been worse if my mom didn't catch a lucky break in the job market, shaped my understanding of how events in life affect people differently, and watching my mom work so hard and struggle with various things by herself showed me that hard work can pay off but only if someone gives you the opportunity, and even then other life events and circumstances cause issues that can run you ragged."

Prior to coming out and dating men I always assumed the tropes women complain about so often were based on stereotypes.   While some certainly are there's truth to quite a lot of them. Given the way boys tend to be raised in our hyper masculine culture many grow up horribly emotionally stunted.   In a heterosexual relationship the woman, assuming she was raised the way we traditionally raise girls in American culture, is there to balance these traits out.   Dealing with two men who were raised not to talk about or otherwise acknowledge their feelings is damn near impossible. It's even more frustrating if you're someone who isn't like that since you then basically have to play a very long waiting game as the men around you finally mature and realize they can't go through their entire lives avoiding vulnerability and intimacy.   It's made me more empathetic and compassionate with myself though since I used to feel like I didn't have myself figured out in the slightest until I got older and realized I was actually ahead of the curb."

Aside from this, there is no magic solution. Distance sucks and nothing can change that. To be honest, I find it most helpful when we are both distracted by work/studies/other obligations.

I was riddled with crippling anxiety and low self esteem. He went through addiction and depression. We used to fight a lot. We even beat the shit out of each other on multiple occasions. We were extremely dysfunctional. There was no reason we should have stayed together. But, no matter what, we always stayed by each other’s side.  He got sober, we both entered personal therapy - this helped each of us grow individually A LOT. I had a lot of issues with shame and guilt that caused issues between us. I did a lot of dumb shit like fibbing about small things and hidings stuff due to shame like looking at porn. His issues included bad connections with his mom and being abused by his stepfather as a kid. He didn’t tell me he loved me for the first couple years we were together.  He's done a 180 since I met him - he's a totally mature adult, going to school to be a clinical psychologist. He's no longer ""sober"" but he also doesn't drink to numb pain anymore. He learned to like himself. He started taking care of himself - going to the gym regularly. His self esteem is through the roof. He has an amazing relationship with him mom now. The biggest thing I think that changed with him is he learned to accept the the things in his past and life that he could not change and then change the things that he had control over.  I had to deal with anxiety issues (stemming from how I was raised) that really made me intolerable to be around a lot. I was a control freak, down to how he drove the car. The therapy I went through helped me deal with the guilt and anxiety. I really recommend personal therapy to everyone. Find a PsyD (not a psychiatrist) who will work with you. I went through cognitive/behavioral personal therapy to basically re-train myself how to think and therefore how I acted. I hold down a regular job, I lost the crippling anxiety, I’m a responsible adult now.  Fast forward many years and we broke up last year. We stopped communicating our feelings. We stopped validating each other’s feelings. He cheated. I closed up more. I cheated. We basically undid everything we learned. We made it through somehow, after being broken up for 5 months. We decided to try again about 9 months ago and got engaged in March. We realized everything we did wrong. We’re going to couple’s counseling now to re-learn how to be together, because we love each other so much.  My biggest recommendations is always communicate everything. Do not hide anything. If you feel frustrated or resentful it’s more likely that you are not communicating properly than that your partner isn’t fulfilling their end. Once you talk, if they aren’t fulfilling their end I really recommend couple’s counseling. It really helps.  If your partner loves and accepts you as they should, they will accept everything you need. We are currently in an open relationship which has eased us both enough to have the option to have fun while keeping each other in the know. The jealousy doesn’t really exist at all, because we don’t try to control each other due to personal insecurities. The biggest thing that helps with that is communication and validating each other’s feelings. You’re in it together. I honestly have never felt so free with someone before. I am free to be me totally. We both accept each other as thinking, feeling adults. He doesn’t put his own insecurities on me, and vice versa. We accept each other sexually. We don’t try to control one another. We’ve dealt with all the resentments that made us passive aggressive and frustrated with each other. ""It is what it is."" :) No pressure (haven't even set a date to be married).  Anyway, I really don’t know if that helps at all, but maybe it will.  Not all relationships are easy. If it’s worth it to you, that’s all that matters. Don’t let others tell you what to do. I’ve found out over 10 years that a friend who always has advice on what to do is not always really a friend - just someone putting their own bullshit on you. You just need people (friends) to listen to you.  OH! Have your own stuff. You need to exist as a couple but also as individuals. This is important. I'm a computer nerd who loves science and writing and art - he's a photographer who is going to school to be a doctor. We have separate friends and mutual friends and that's ok. We don't always do stuff together but carve out time everyday to be with each other. Etc etc."

Unfortunately the fact that I may have to worry about holding my bf or significant others hand in public anywhere is really sad.   Everyone thinks that the USA is the promise land of freedom but even here homosexuality isn't accepted everywhere and you have to be careful where you are, when being so open about your sexuality. My state was one of the first to legalize gay marriage and I have seen gay men holding hands in public many times and reactions are mixed. Mostly nothing but some people won't shy away from yelling ""faggot"" or something else derogatory.   My advice is to always be aware of your surroundings. There is no need to invite trouble when traveling or being in an area you don't  know. Being a gay male I hope one day seeing two men holding hands in public or showing any affection will be the norm. For now whenever I see it I usually gawk one to check them out ;) and two to offer kudos for helping change social norms as what is perceived to be acceptable."

That suburb has a lot of Muslims, and immigrants from super-homophobic nations like Jamaica, where they cluster makes for some very unfriendly areas.    It's funny when you fire up Grindr out there, all young men of colour with not a face pic to be seen, just row after row of headless shirtless dudes.  Only the white guys will have face photos.  I've chatted with a few of them, they are all ridonkulously deep in the closet.  So sad.

gaybros,3d3vus,proudbreeder,6,Mon Jul 13 17:28:11 2015 UTC,"Canada is pretty good at assimilating, and it does go away after two or at most three generations.    But with 300,000 newly landed immigrants every year, there's no shortage of communities made up entirely of recent arrivals cut-off from the values of mainstream Canada: ""It won't be bad for your children"" is no comfort for a young man or woman born here into a family and ethnic ghetto both roiling with vicious homophobia.  I grew up in a small town in rural Ontario that was viciously homophobic, it saddens me that 20 years later the same thing is playing out right here in ghettos in our most cosmopolitan city.  The culture shift in Canada about LGBT rights has even reached all the way back to my hometown, and yet has not penetrated into communities but a few kilometres from downtown Toronto.  I don't know what the answer is, better integration of newcomers I suppose but I don't know how we could achieve that."

That's like the first place you go to buy an apartment once you hop off the plane at Pearson, I guess.   They're pro-LGBT, so I'm glad for that.  I feel rather than addressing ""immigrant communities"", we address homophobia as a whole in Canada.  When you single out people, let me tell you, there are a lot of unintended consequences to that. A lot that the majority just doesn't understand and refuses to.  We should maintain a welcoming attitude to immigrants and keep the ""us vs. them"" to a minimum. That's how you get crazy radicalized 2nd/3rd gen Muslim youth bombing and beheading people."

Not a single multi-generational Canadian was there. I'm from rural Ontario and even out here, people in their early 20s are pretty chill/dont care about gays.

Do you think what you wrote is going to make them feel welcome in Canada and like they're Canadian? I'm a child of immigrants. I feel like you might think my family is homophobic because we're immigrants.  Do you just group together all immigrants like that?  If we do focus on homophobia in immigrant communities, you're a good example of exactly what NOT to do.  Some people view it as ""PC run amok"". I view it as don't fuck shit up more than it already is and plan your words carefully."
gaybros,3d3vus,MyAssTakesMastercard,2,Mon Jul 13 20:34:01 2015 UTC,"There is absolutely no reason a pro-lgbt immigrant should feel bad about what I said, nor should they take it personally. If anything, they should feel Canadian-- more Canadian than most in their community-- and that should make them feel good.   They should be proud that they hold Canadian values and should work hard to promote those values to the people they know in their communities who ignore and actively disrespect Canadian values and norms.  edit: furthermore, the 'us' vs 'them' scenario is sadly created by the immigrants. Canadian culture exists first, if you come to this country with a contrary values system and are unwilling to change then you create an 'us' vs 'them' situation. As the newcomer, you are the creator of that, and you are creating it out of selfishness.  Those who come here with anti-lgbt feelings should simply not come here because unfortunately they do not hold the same values on morality and liberty as we do. If they do choose to come here despite that, then they are doing so selfishly; and for that they do deserve to be singled out, and they do deserve to shamed. Immigrating to this country is a privilege, not a right."
gaybros,3d3vus,tylertgbh,2,Mon Jul 13 23:22:11 2015 UTC,"If you come here, you have freedoms and rights.  Among those, you have the freedom to hold whatever beliefs you want.  There is no one Canadian culture. That is anti-Canadian and goes against the concept of Canadian multiculturalism.   Yes, anti-LGBT views in Canada is unfortunate and it would be more favourable for all Canadians, immigrant or otherwise, to be accepting of LGBT individuals.   But, above else, the Canadian values we should uphold are our Charter rights and freedoms.   You're applying stipulations on immigrants that are just going to be ignored anyways, and also have the unintended consequence of making enemies. Why not the same stipulations to native born Canadians?  When you say things like that, it really colours people's perceptions. It's not a simple ""if you don't like it, get out"". People that you don't like will come here regardless of what you say. You might as well say things that will have a better outcome than just that.   I don't want Canada to be that sort of country.   Immigrating to Canada is a pretty difficult process anyhow. The people that are here, want to be here.  We should be welcoming to everyone and uphold their rights the same as anyone else. No sensationalism or fear-mongering. That's what I'm afraid of.  I feel very welcome in this country and am not afraid because of my ethnicity, religion, or sexuality.  Everyone should feel that way.  My point is: we should be careful when speaking about these immigrant communities."
gaybros,3d3vus,MyAssTakesMastercard,2,Tue Jul 14 02:19:07 2015 UTC,"You don't seem to understand. You also seem to have the same selfish and entitled mentality I described.   People that you don't like will come here regardless of what you say   I know that, but what I am saying is that is wrong. The people who do that are wrong, and they do it selfishly, to take advantage of the social and physical security offered in this country while disrespectfully and selfishly ignoring cultural norms which already exist here.   You're claim to protection of the Charter for barbaric and uneducated belief systems is pathetic and laughable. The Charter does not give you ""the freedom to hold whatever beliefs you want"". This is not the United States. Hate speech, and hateful beliefs are not protected by the Charter (there's a reason why the KKK is banned in this country).  You continue to misunderstand my statements.   The people that are here, want to be here.   Ya, sure they do. I don't disagree. The problem is that for far too many immigrants, their desire is selfish, and act selfishly while here. The reason the Ontario sex ed carriculum is an issue is largely because the muslim community expects to be able to press it's primitive beliefs of sexuality on everyone else in the community. Because these weak-kneed troglodytes think educating youth on sexual health is wrong (based on their 2000 year old book of lies) they fight to take that education away from everyone in the province.  I will not ""be careful"" when speaking about this immigrant communities. Your apologetic sense of entitlement for these groups is sickening. My family didn't help build the institutions of education, liberty, and progress in this country over the last 200 years for me to have to ""speak carefully"" about the barbaric and savage beliefs of newcomers.  You are also a blatant hypocrite as a self proclaimed homosexual muslim. I'm sure the logical gymnastics you perform to rationalise that hypocrisy is what gave you the experience to rationalise the hatred and ignorance of some immigrants as being entitled to respect and legal protection.  This is not fear mongering or sensationalism. It's a fact based fight against ignorance and those who seek to destroy the progress that has made this country so great. Honestly, after seeing the primitive entitlement of the sex-ed protests, I have no pity or niceties left."

The more you treat an other like an ""other"", the less they will identify with the rest of society.  I am Canadian and I'm proud of that. Terrorists do not think they are Canadian. They don't feel Canadian. They are an other.  Plus, children are really manipulable. If all around them they are given this one image of themselves--that Muslims are homophobic or violent or whatever--they're not going to better themselves because there's no point. All the time you are told what you are by people that don't even know you, why would get along with those people?  It's a vicious cycle. Young Muslim Canadians need better guidance and above else to be considered Canadians first.

We don't hold back on criticizing anti-native racists in Manitoba or sex-specific abortions in the Chinese and Indian community or any other undesirable traits in the community fabric of the nation.

I can't even blame the homophobes on the street. They are bullies that are present in every country. Except in this country almost every newspaper and every TV channel keeps telling them how dangerous the gays are and how important it is to cleanse the country of the abominations that they are. Their anger, insecurities and lack of information about gay people mixed with state-enforced homophobia are what causes this.  The worst thing for me (as it so often is on youtibe) are the comments under the video. Many years ago I'd started spending more time on the Internet to spend less time IRL around people like that.

Not everyone supports us, but the fraction that doesn't is smart enough to know it's outnumbered, and most of them keep their mouths shut.  Back in the '80s when my aunt went to the same university, it was a completely different story. People were very openly hostile to the LGBT community, even writing death threats in chalk on the sidewalks. That was considered normal enough that it didn't even get media attention. That was only 30 years ago.  Is Russia frighteningly homophobic? Yes, that's why I chose not to study abroad for a semester while I was getting my Russian minor, even though my university and scholarships would've paid 100% of the bill. But here we have people openly defying a Supreme Court order because they don't like gays. There are a lot of places where it's not safe to be open (where you get more than just taunts and insults). And just think about how big a deal school bullying still is.  Pretending we're all treated like normal over here in the US while Russia can't stand gays is grossly oversimplifying the situation."

There's a great walk which will take you between Clovelly and Coogee along the coast. There's tonnes to do in Sydney depends what your into. I would recommend going on the 'Bradley's head to chowder bay' walk (another walk I know but simply beautiful if natural Australian beauty is something you want to see). It's an amazing walk. The bush on the harbour, it's easy to forget your still so close to the city until it pops out between the trees sometimes and gives some of the best uninterrupted views.

gaybros,3d7sew,RetreatingOx,3,Tue Jul 14 12:15:07 2015 UTC,"Hey, Torontonian living in Brisbane here. It really comes down to how much money you want to spend on accommodation. I usually priceline a hotel in Sydney a couple of days before and it works out fairly cheap as long as you aren't doing it on a public holiday etc. Alternatively you can look at getting a hostel as well. The YHAs are really good and usually in good locations. If you want to hang around the gay district of Sydney, Oxford Street is the way to go for bars, clubs and even accommodation. For gay bars/clubs, check out the stonewall and the midnight shift. For some other cool bars/clubs, check out The Ivy, Soda Factory, The Baxter Inn and Argyle.   Going to the opera house would be a good idea. I'd recommend seeing a show. My friends and I just wait till 6pm the day of to get rush tickets for 25 bucks. It's a pretty sweet deal as long as you aren't fussy about seats.   Check out Bondi Beach for a swim and some good breakfast. There are a few nice breakfast spots along the beach which I think you may like. Australian breakfasts are definitely the best meals of the day. I'm from Toronto and Cora's is the McDonald's version of breakfast in Australia (although I do like an occasional egg mcmuffin now and then).   Hope it helps man. If you have any other questions, let me know.   Cheers."

gaybros,3d7sew,oldjoe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:02:20 2015 UTC,"Will also give my two cents on the brunch thing: There's like 15-25 places that do great brunch in Sydney (way better than most things in Bondi. Bondi does have bills but it's overpriced and not much else that's innovative comes to mind there). Brunch is fuckin good here.   In Bondi, Sensory lab is one the best places in sydney for a bagel though and it's coffee is pretty great. They may have changed their bagel provider which is a bit bullshit... can't remember what the lady there said about it).  Here's a decent list of brunch places: http://www.theurbanlist.com/sydney/a-list/20-sydney-s-best-all-day-breakfasts.   Personal favourites are the Shakshoukka at Shenkin, the beans at Gnome (but gnome isn't that famous). Three Williams has chilli salted bacon+eggs in a few meals which is great - redfern is a great up and coming suburb, where this place is. Brewtown Newtown is great and it's in Newtown which is a fun place to dawdle around in the morning on a non-weekend day. Devon on Dank (kind of out of the way from the city centre) is well known but maybe over-pricey. Kepos St kitchen nearby to devon is good if you like Israeli slants on staple brunch items. Definitely less beloved, but Madde Spuds in surry hills (opposite Gnome) does a great in-pan breakfast for hangover cures. Also lots of these places do really great museli with poached and good fruits.   Can't remember anything else at the moment. Generally you'll find the most interesting food places outside the core cbd, with a few exceptions. Urban List will help you on that one. They update all the time.  Overall, I'd be surprised if you could fuck up brunch here, but be sure to go somewhere good. I'm not an expert on anything else in Sydney apart from brunch, which I spend half my life doing."

My favorites are Good Eats (which has sadly ended its run, but is on reruns on the Cooking channel), America's Test Kitchen and Cook's County. The later two are done by the same company, featuring mostly the same people, airing on a lot of PBS stations.  Like Good Eats they explain the how and the why of certain things in cooking, as well as relatively easy and idiot-proofed recipes (which is why it's called America's Test Kitchen: they have random people throughout the country testing every possible variation on their recipes to ensure they work in the real world). And unlike Good Eats they also test individual brands of different foods (like egg noodles or orange juice) and equipment (everything from cookie sheets to ice cream makers) with their top pick, and if it's expensive they also have a budget recommendation too."

Once you get the hang of cooking and learn the basics, you'll get more confident in changing recipes to suit your tastes better, or just inventing your own altogether.

It takes an incomprehensible amount of strength to put up with the situation you've described.  While I'm not advocated drug use for everyone, I do agree that taking psychedelics can be somewhat of a wake-up call for people, a small jolt of self-awareness that allows you to take control (this is me speaking from experience).   Dude, just keep on keeping on. Your safety and security are your first priorities, so do everything it takes to attain them while you slowly garner the financial and psychological strength to fly the coop if that is what you think is necessary. Best of luck!"

Psychedelics can be a lot of fun, but they can also be deeply troubling. They can make you confront repressed emotions and memories and , IMHO, a lot of people write them off after a bad trip. In my experience, when reflected on properly, the bad trips are the most life changing. As a matter of fact I don't think I would have ever come to grips with my own sexuality if it wasn't for a particularly intense mushroom trip last August . Your mind was telling you something on that trip, whether you wanted it to or not. Let the bad experiences make a better, more compassionate, and loving person (not that you aren't already!).

I'm sorry you've been going through this crap, and I wish you lived closer so I could help you out a bit! Have you looked around for a YMCA or similar young person's shelter? Major cities normally have a shelter or two for young men and women who feel unsafe at home. Is there a local LGBT hotline you can ring for advice or support? Do you have any friends or relatives that can accommodate you, maybe in return for doing handiwork or chores, or even for free?   Just please look after yourself, and don't feel forced or pressured into doing anything unsafe. Also, not being judgmental or anything, but it might be worth avoiding mood-altering drugs until you are in a better place emotionally.  It's so weird that I stumbled across this post right now - I'm a trainee counsellor, and I'm just in the middle of a gender & sexual diversity course (I'm on the train and the wifi connection won't support the online training) - and I really want to work with LGBT teens and young adults, and their families, especially mediating situations like these where the young person is in danger of homelessness. I'm so sorry that you had to go see this 'counsellor'. I hope you aren't put off by therapy in the future, as it's a really good thing, it's just you've been sent to one of these awful 'therapists' who just try to make you feel as though your sexuality is wrong.

I know it's painful and awkward right now, but time heals these things.   I came out to my family about 7 years ago, and they're just now getting to what I would consider 100% acceptance.  it's sounds like a long time from your seat, but from mine it's a blur of time and memories all from my own life out from under their roof.    it gets better, but you have to stay true to yourself and do the best you can for you. pm me if you need to, we've all been there."

My advice, for what it's worth, is don't be homeless. Priority number one is to be safe and healthy. Maybe there's a family member you can stay with? If you need to stay with your parents until December, remember you can come here anytime and find support. You can also DM if you need to talk one on one. I'll share a Rupaul quote I always share in these situations because it never fails to make me feel better: ""We love you, you are so welcomed here. You know we as gay people we get to choose our family. We get to choose the people we’re around. I am your family, we are family here. I love you."""

The fact that you've been toughing this out for so long while taking into account the future is amazing. If you can't take it anymore, just ask for more time for work and keep acquiring that money. Make sure you're accepted into your other school and that you can afford it. Other than that, if you can't stand going to church and appeasing your parents anymore, it's time to fly brother.  Honestly, I know of people who have paid for school on their own without loans or helps with parents, but just by working at restaurants while going to school for undergrad. Navigating this is part of life is in fact life. It's probably when you'll feel so alive and motivated to succeed because you'll never want to return.  If you really want to stick it to your parents, just go get laid behind their back and then come back home. Pretty satisfying knowing you just got some and your parents don't know shit lol.

Usually I encourage people to look North for summer month vacations and look South for late season/winter vacations. Especially for people who live in the North, getting to toasty beach in February is a nice break, and you don't have to worry about getting fried if your sunblock washes off early. My favorite North destinations are the great open parks, but you seem set on urban places, and you've probably already been to Algonquin.   So for August, I would be thinking about Berlin and Amsterdam (sex, no beach), Vancouver, and Chicago (actually has a beach). For shoulder season (Sept/Oct) I would send you to Sitges (gay sex, beach) and Greece. For Dec/Jan, Mexico and Hawaii."

I'm not against non-urban areas for vacations, but I'm already doing 3 different back country hikes in the interior at Algonquin, during the long weekends, so am looking for something a bit different.

The first major hurdle for me growing up was my mother, who knew something was up. Her ""solution"" was to be overbearing and controlling. The result was it just drove a wedge between us and inadvertently encouraged me to seek out all the things she was trying to ""protect"" me from.   My second hurdle was an overly religious circle of friends in HS that temporarily forced me back in the closet. Until I ultimately politely distanced myself from them senior year. I realized their way of dealing with stuff was to ignore and hide from it.  Edit: fixed phone's auto-corrections"
gaybros,3d4hr5,zestypurplecatalyst,2,Tue Jul 14 14:58:29 2015 UTC,"I wasn't pressured other than typical boys' pressure that gay is a synonym for un-cool or sissy; and you never want to be un-cool.    I really wasn't aware that I was gay.  I didn't know what I was.  I knew I wasn't like the other kids.  I just never even considered being gay as an option.  I didn't know any out gay men.  Gay men were like TV characters, like Liberace or the character Klinger from Mash.  I knew that I wasn't like them.   In junior high and high school,  I still did not know what was wrong with me.  I was scrawny and not good looking. Other guys were growing up and getting muscles and deeper voices and looking more like men than like children.  I got upset thinking about or looking at the muscular cute guys.  I got a twisted feeling in my stomach; but I identified it as jealously.  I wanted to be them.  Why can't I have muscles?  Why can't I have a handsome face?  Why can't I be popular?   But I was also, worried about why wasn't I going berserk over girls?  Shouldn't that have happened by now?  All my other friends became girl crazy, one at a time.  When would that happen to me?  (I guess it was just as well I wasn't obsessed with girls because girls didn't want me.  But I knew that I should be obsessed with girls at my age.)  Looking back, the signs were everywhere.  How could I have not known?  How could everyone around me not known.  Why didn't someone tell me?    (edit to fix spelling and punctuation, and add tldr.)  tl;dr - I was not pressured to be straight. I just was clueless about myself."

gaybros,3d4hr5,Kichigai,5,Mon Jul 13 15:58:46 2015 UTC,"My own personal opinion is the same as most of my opinion whe nature V. nurture debates come up. After my initial groan and eye roll. I usually say ""probably bigger nature, with nurture factoring in (or vice versa)"". We learned a long time ago we should not try and pin it down to one or the other, becuase it's almost always at least a bit of both.  However, my point on sexuality is that it's ""Nature, with nurture influence"". I believe that your sexuality is inherent, it's nature in the fact that your base is determined from birth, but I also believe that nature can SLIGHTLY alter it. That may sound confusing, but let me put it like this, say you're a Kinsey 2, but you grow up in a very baptist, conservative family who thinks homosexuality is evil and a sin. By the time you're twenty or thirty, that may drop to a one, because of conditioning, but I don't think you can ever get rid of it fully. On the reverse side if you're a Kinsey 3 and grow up in a very liberal, open family, you may find yourself experimenting with the same sex, and liking it, and end up a Kinsey 4 by the time you're thirty.  Sexuality is really only black and white for those VERY rare people who are perfect kinsey 7's and 0's. Even with them it can be fluid. For most people it's probably influenced slightly by outside factors, but cannot be greatly swayed from it's original point. Sexuality is a very complex and fluid thing, for it not to be influenced by outside factors would be the odd thing IMO, but I also don't think it can be so heavily influenced to the point where we could ever say nurture is the defining factor."
gaybros,3d4hr5,Cendruex,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:13:07 2015 UTC,"We learned a long time ago we should not try and pin it down to one or the other, becuase it's almost always at least a bit of both.   Did we really? There's still a ton of folks out there trying to prove it's exclusively one thing or the other. Look at all the religious conservatives who are trying to prove that homosexuality is the result of molestation at a young age.   I believe that your sexuality is inherent, it's nature in the fact that your base is determined from birth, but I also believe that nature can SLIGHTLY alter it.   I'm actually with you on this. You have certain natural inclinations, but the environment around you can influence how you feel and act. If everyone around you says eating grapes is an unacceptable thing, then you're probably less likely to consider grapes while around those people. At an unconscious level it probably won't even enter your mind. But if you end up around a bunch of grape farmers then grapes are probably going to seem more appealing.   Sexuality is really only black and white for those VERY rare people who are perfect kinsey 7's and 0's. Even with them it can be fluid.   A very important point."

gaybros,3d4hr5,HerrBoltzmann,4,Mon Jul 13 16:23:24 2015 UTC,"I'm firmly on the nature side of the argument. Homo sapiens is just one of more than a thousand species in which a sexual spectrum has been observed, and the overwhelming majority of those species lack the higher intellectual capacity to deviate from standard instinctive nurturing practice, yet still produce offspring with varied orientation. The idea that human sexuality is somehow different because we can create ideological constructs to try and explain our existence strikes me as mere hubris - biologically, we're still just another species in a collection."

The nurture argument has no basis as far as I'm concerned. It's in you from day 1, what you choose to do with it is another issue.  Honestly though, I find these discussions to be entirely futile, and even dangerous. It shouldn't matter in the least whether it's nature or nurture, and it kills me to see activists and supporters talking about how we were 'born this way' or how we 'didn't choose our sexuality' in the pursuit of acceptance and equal rights."

It was made clear to me from a young age that being gay was not normal, natural not acceptable. Yet here I am.   So am I just being rebellious?   Looking back I think I've always known I was gay and certainly sought out opportunities to ""experiment"" with other boys. We used to play the ""tieing up game"" as a 9/10 YO and this obviously meant that the lads I tied up had their trousers pulled down. This isn't ""hetronormative"" behaviour I'm sure. However why was I interested in doing it? Out of the boys I 'played' with I'm the only one who is now gay. I'm not sure that this lends itself to either argument in honesty..."

gaybros,3d4hr5,avian_buddha,2,Tue Jul 14 05:53:30 2015 UTC,"I'm going with nature on this one. I never really saw any issues with same-sex sexuality, even just around the time I hit puberty. It had never been a topic my parents ever mentioned at that time, so outside of the fact that it was two men having sex I didn't even know that ""gay"" was, let alone any cultural stigma around it (I grew up home schooled, so my exposure to the world was somewhat limited at that time). However others I knew who had also grown up in more sheltered, yet more liberal, households had absolutely no inclination towards same-sex sexuality. They had no issues with it, but absolutely no inclination towards it.  However I will concede that there probably are environmental factors that may influence our desires at any given time. As someone who identifies as bi I can say with a fair amount of confidence that sexuality is indeed a fluid thing. In high school I felt a bit more interest in other men than I did in college. Since college I've had more interested in men than I have at any time prior. Before college I had no sexual experience with either sex, and in college I only had experience with women, and yet here I am.  Therefore I feel I can say pretty securely that it is not ""nurturing"" that, for lack of a better way to put it, enables one to have proclivities towards the same sex, though it may enhance it or mask it."

Ex-gay camps have a long term success of practically 0% (""practically"" because of a few anomolies who almost always come out as repressing it, eventually). There seems to be a complete lack of any consistent evidence for nurture, yet there is some evidence with nature, so I'm assuming it's natural."
gaybros,3d4hr5,cortex112,2,Mon Jul 13 18:25:08 2015 UTC,"I don't buy into the nurture thing at all. I knew I was gay deep down before I even knew what gay was, or have even seen a gay person in real life. I knew I was gay long before I did anything with another man.

Nurture is used by homophobes to try and claim that gay people are ""trained"" to be gay."
gaybros,3d4hr5,cortex112,2,Mon Jul 13 21:19:52 2015 UTC,"Probably both to some extent. But really it's irrelevant. It's not something you can change, regardless of why you're gay. Most people care about the debate for religious reasons. It's irrelevant to that, too. ""Hath not the potter power over the clay to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor?"" - somewhere in the book of Romans.  Which is to say that God could totally make you a certain way and then send you to Hell for it. Not that this is the viewpoint I'm advocating. I'm really just saying that in Christianity, whether you were born a certain way or not doesn't determine your favor with God. Really that's not up to us. If God loves us he'd probably show us somehow.  I bet if God loved us he'd pay nearly any price to show us his love. And if we're his purchased possession, then something small like being gay isn't going to separate us from God.  But yeah, other than religion, it doesn't matter why we're gay. And in religion it doesn't matter either because God is all powerful and we don't win favor by our actions. God either cares about us or not.  And then there are other religions where it also doesn't matter."
gaybros,3d4hr5,gixmo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:48:36 2015 UTC,I'm no expert on God's will. However if he is truly an ever loving God then he loves us regardless of sexual oriental.

gaybros,3d4hr5,night-shark,2,Tue Jul 14 17:10:15 2015 UTC,"I think you will definitely find that in more open and loving communities, it is more likely that children will grow and be openly gay, but this isn't because they were nurtured to be gay. It is because they were nurtured to feel more comfortable to be who they are and are simply more likely to come out of the closet. That is my opinion anyway: Nature all the way"
gaybros,3d4hr5,TheIronGoat,3,Tue Jul 14 11:33:25 2015 UTC,"I am right there with you on this one. I believe it can be both. I used to think that I was born gay, still do really, but I realized that my first homosexual experience was at like 6 years old with the neighbor boy who was like 9... I thoroughly enjoyed it but sometimes wonder if that Is the reason I like men today. After that I tried to go after girls but I knew deep down I wanted a man. A lot of my friends say that they were born gay and when I ask them their story it's usually similar to mine or something more tragic in their past. Now I hate to say it but a lot gay guys I know personally were molested by men at a young age. Not saying that is what made them gay but it's a scary common trend I've picked up. I know there are millions of guys who were never touched and even didn't have a gay experience until after puberty that say they were born gay and I believe them whole heartedly but I think some of it has to do with the experimentation or sexual contact with a male at a young age. I probably sound like an idiot for saying all that but it's just like my opinion so please don't judge me for it."
gaybros,3d4hr5,blowhardV2,2,Mon Jul 13 13:47:01 2015 UTC,"No judgement here. In my misguided youth (16?) I had a ""boyfriend"" of sorts, who I now see was questioning his own sexuality. My biggest fear is that I ""made"" him Gay by having a relationship with him at such an impressionable time. Especially as I was so secure in my own sexuality at the time.  It is a pattern that I have picked up too - a lot of fellow GayBro's have had similar experimentation with a lad at an early age."

gaybros,3d27z7,rufusadams,2,Mon Jul 13 02:34:31 2015 UTC,That's apparently a part of the rules. You wrestle until you can get your hand down the other guy's pants. Turkish wrestling in Turkey is like baseball is in America.
gaybros,3d27z7,gaslodrach,2,Mon Jul 13 06:40:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is quite erotic, but what is the point? In (USA)wrestling you need to pin someone but I didn't see any pinning happening. How do you win?"
gaybros,3d27z7,gaslodrach,3,Mon Jul 13 01:21:36 2015 UTC,"How a Winner is Decided  The essential pin in Yağlı Gűreş is similar to that in Greco-Roman wrestling (which, incidentally, is neither Greek nor Roman, but a modern European adaptation. Except for covering their nakedness with a kispet – which is an act of male modesty commanded by Mohammed – the Turks claim that theirs is closest to the classic Greek style). The first wrestler whose “umbilicus is exposed to heaven” loses the match. Holding of the shoulders to the ground for a period of time is not an element in the pin.  There are alternatives to this basic pin which also constitute a victory:  (1) The “crush.” A fighter may maneuver his opponent onto his stomach and then trap him by sprawling on top. If he can keep him down with his face buried in the grass he can then turn his exhausted opponent with a half-nelson for a pin. This is a dangerous move, and the referee monitors closely to see that the bottom man is not suffocated. If the “crusher” is not successful after a given period the referee has them begin again from a standing position.  (2) Submission. Occasionally the match under a hot summer sun is so long and arduous that one fighter will simply signal his submission to the referee. Pin.  (3) Since a wrestler is not restricted from placing his hands inside his opponent’s kispet (he may not grab his balls or invade his rectum, however), he can also use the waistband to hold the other man in place. Occasionally the kispet is yanked so far below his hips that the fighter being held cannot rise without exposing himself. Having lost his trunks he also loses the match.  (4) If a fighter is able to lift his opponent entirely off the ground and carry him five paces in any direction, that is a “carrying” pin.  (5) A running “flip” is sometimes employed, in which the wrestler causes both his opponent and himself to expose their navels during the roll. The loser is the one whose navel is first to be exposed. Unless the initiator of this move is careful, he may find himself the loser even though he was the “flipper.”  Source: http://www.turkishwrestling.com/rules-and-customs/"

gaybros,3czsum,highgarden,59,Sun Jul 12 07:17:17 2015 UTC,"I remember seeing my husband hold our new baby for the first time and the tears just flowed. It made me love him so much more to see him love this new life we created.   Having kids also really improved our relationship with our families-- straight siblings and parents tend to get over all their hangups pretty fast when you're in the parenting trenches with them. They start to see you as more like them.  Kids do strain your relationship with friends though. As gay atheist dads, it has been hard to find a place we fit well. We miss out on a lot of stuff our gay friends do and enjoy (they are all at bear week in Provincetown right now and we are a little jealous). But even more common things like pool parties and dinners you miss a lot of. We still get babysitters and get out with our friends every couple of weeks but it's a lot less than before. The flip side of that is trying to find friends you can hang out who have kids-- we live in a suburb in Texas and our kids friends from school all come from straight religious homes. Now we've never felt any real exclusion just because we are gay, but it's tough to find a family where all 4 adults plus the kids all click well.   Having babies also has made us spend less time with each other just out of necessity. We used to lift weights together and now we have to do it separately. The more kids you have the more likely it is to happen too because they are not always on the same page as each other and so you have have to split up to accommodate them.  Our kids are a blast though. Funny and creative and we love to be with them.  We laugh a lot with them. There us a huge joy in everything when experiences are new-- there is something so human about showing the world and teaching concepts to your offspring. Its hard to describe but it makes life more exciting because everything is new to them. It's drawn us closer together emotionally with a common purpose too.  There's a book out that I haven't read but the title, while maybe hyoerbole, applies especially to gay dads: ""All Joy and No Fun.""   I don't agree completely, because it is fun to have kids, but in a lot different way than gay men are used to."

So by the time our daughter was born, we had already gone through many of the transitions relationships go through. We had already moved from the initial ""honeymoon"" to the comfortable routines.   I guess the biggest changes are that there are some different tensions. We do not always agree on child-rearing. We mostly do, but he is stricter than I am. I am more willing to let her make her own mistakes (and deal with the consequences) than he is. But we are not all that far apart on most things.  What we actually do together has changed. Where and how we eat meals has changed; what movies we watch has changed; sleeping arrangements have altered (now that there is a little girl in our bedroom); and a host of other details of our lives. But our underlying relationship has not changed all that much, at least from my perspective. Except, of course, that there is now someone else in this world who rivals his importance to me. I suppose that is something. I should add, however, that I have anything but an objective perspective on this.

gaybros,3d0j5p,super__sonic,2,Mon Jul 13 13:25:40 2015 UTC,isn't that 3.5/3 then?
gaybros,3d0j5p,JoseCorazon,0,Mon Jul 13 18:03:19 2015 UTC,I no longer give a flying fuck.
gaybros,3d0j5p,secondaccountforme,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:10:04 2015 UTC,Explain..?
gaybros,3d0j5p,JoseCorazon,8,Sun Jul 12 16:14:45 2015 UTC,"I find women very, very attractive: their hair, body, smell, clothing, the way they hold themselves, their smile, facial features, curves etc. I love flirting with women; frequently have to come out as gay or tell new acquaintances - when I mention my other half people immediately use the pronoun ""she"" or ""her"" to ask further about my supposedly female partner. I don't have very gay vibes at all I guess; I slept with girls throughout secondary school, loved sports, in particular rugby, and still do.    That said, I am a gay man. I love putting my dick in men. I don't find gay men anywhere near as attractive from an objective point of view, very rarely flirt with men etc.    Hope that clarifies but if not oh well."
gaybros,3d0j5p,dhicock,11,Sun Jul 12 17:40:47 2015 UTC,"So you find women beautiful, but do not want a sexual relation with them. You find men handsome, but do not find them as attractive as women, but prefer sex with them?   I may be a little more confused after your explanation honestly."
gaybros,3d0j5p,Deefian,16,Sun Jul 12 19:09:51 2015 UTC,Probably something along the lines of heteroromantic homosexual. Romantic and sexual orientations can be two entirely different things for some people.
gaybros,3d0j5p,Fidget6,5,Sun Jul 12 21:18:28 2015 UTC,"This is why labels are good for generalizations,  but don't completely work.  Sexuality is too complex and unique to each individual."
gaybros,3d0j5p,secondaccountforme,2,Mon Jul 13 03:30:47 2015 UTC,"I mean I like putting my dick in men, but that alone doesn't make me a gay man. I'm attracted to women too, which makes me bisexual."
gaybros,3d0j5p,broaway999,20,Sun Jul 12 19:10:14 2015 UTC,"I'm a 4. I fucked a LOT of girls in high school before I figured out that my attraction to boys wasn't ""a phase.""   I don't think vaginas are gross, I just think they are boring. I'd way, way, way rather fuck a cute boy's ass. In the last 10 years I've had 2 sexual encounters with women.   If I'm on a desert island and the only way to get off is to fuck a chick, I'll do it. But short of that, I'm all about that (boy) ass."
gaybros,3d0j5p,jaycatt7,11,Sun Jul 12 16:42:23 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure if I was on a desert island, I'd want to get off on a boat."

gaybros,3d0j5p,zestypurplecatalyst,7,Sun Jul 12 16:36:47 2015 UTC,"Solid 6.  Maybe 5.5.  Sometimes I unconsciously notice an attractive woman.  But I don't really want to put my dick in her.  Could also be old habits of years in the closet.  Any time I was around guys, I would consciously be scanning the environment for hot girls.  Must blend in; can not be detected.  I actually got pretty good at ""Check out the tits on that girl.  2 o'clock.  Red top."""
gaybros,3d0j5p,ButtSexington3rd,7,Sun Jul 12 19:24:21 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, 4. I identify as bi, but I tend to be a little more into men sexually and a little more into women emotionally. It tends to shift either way for months/years at a time too. I tend to get more of a derp face from women, that stupid ""Ohhhhh she's so pretty I don't know what to do with myself"". I've learned to just go with the flow and go after what I'm feeling at the time. But all in all, I'm pretty equally open for business :)"
gaybros,3d0j5p,comic_serif,4,Sun Jul 12 21:48:40 2015 UTC,"Probably a 5, but sliding down to a 4 recently."
gaybros,3d0j5p,u_got_a_better_idea,3,Sun Jul 12 14:34:28 2015 UTC,"About three. Maybe 2.9 if I'm honest. Doesn't mean I'm any less attracted to men, women just catch my eye a little more."
gaybros,3d0j5p,USplendid,3,Sun Jul 12 16:40:04 2015 UTC,"4.  I do find women physically attractive. I just don't find them intellectually or emotionally attractive.   Women can be ""hot"" just like a guy can be hot. But I rarely take it further than admiring the view. Because I'm not interested in them past their looks and my sexual desires. But I get ""it"" and understand why straight guys enjoy being with women."
gaybros,3d0j5p,USplendid,2,Sun Jul 12 21:12:27 2015 UTC,"Sure thing.....  Paralleled interests, shared hobbies, commonalities, mutual experiences, etc.   Maybe it's just the way I'm hard wired, but I lack that desire/drive/motivation to invest in deep relationships with most of the women I meet. Growing up I had next to no female friends nor the drive to seek them out."
gaybros,3d0j5p,jaycatt7,7,Mon Jul 13 02:23:26 2015 UTC,"I want to say 6, but I keep having this reaction to college-age women in tight shirts. It's kind of freaking me out."
gaybros,3d0j5p,skibbz,4,Mon Jul 13 02:49:22 2015 UTC,What kind of reaction. Maybe you should have a doctor check that out. Or I could take a look if you liked.
gaybros,3d0j5p,jaycatt7,3,Sun Jul 12 15:50:52 2015 UTC,"It's like, my eyes get drawn and I feel all tense and excited? Stupid bisexuality. Why does everything have to be complicated? Or maybe it's just anxiety about the cultural import of tits.  But, anyway, yes, I think I might like for you to play doctor..."
gaybros,3d0j5p,ncc1776,3,Mon Jul 13 13:52:19 2015 UTC,Probably a 4.75
gaybros,3d0j5p,throwaway43894389,3,Mon Jul 13 14:06:23 2015 UTC,"A 4 to a 5 I would say. I don't get attracted to the Female physique, but I usually fantasize about having romantic and/or sexual relationships with women. I've only ever been with a girl sexually. Never been with a guy or had bfs/gfs.  I think being married to a woman and having kids is ideal, but the problem is I get attracted(romantically) more often to men than women. I'm very open to being with a guy if I'm attracted to them, I just don't think it's ideal as being with a woman. It's so complicated lol."
gaybros,3d0j5p,Whirlspell,2,Sun Jul 12 14:57:42 2015 UTC,Solid 5.
gaybros,3d0j5p,Bullstang,2,Mon Jul 13 01:20:36 2015 UTC,"Thought I was exclusively men until on two seperate occasions I was cuddling with straight girl friend and got a boner that I actually had to fight to go away lol. This girl knew how to act and be flirty even tho I'm gay..we had many hang outs that ended up feeling like date nights. So idk if I could get with just any hot girl and say hot is hot, but if she was attractive inside and out, maybe I could give it a go. Guys are still pretty much my thing tho it wouldn't be hard to swing me back over to gay. Not sure where this puts me on Kinsey scale."
gaybros,3d0j5p,throwaway43894389,2,Sun Jul 12 14:14:27 2015 UTC,"I get that. I think I'm the same way for the most part. When I was in high school I got an erection because a girl who was a friend of mine wore some tight basketball shorts. I don't know what it was, but we were on a bus for a church trip, she stood up in the isle, and nature did it's thing.  It was really just an isolated incident though. I never really felt anything for her, and she never turned me on like that again."
gaybros,3d0j5p,LimesKeepOnDrippin,2,Sun Jul 12 15:05:07 2015 UTC,4 probably.
gaybros,3d0j5p,dhicock,2,Sun Jul 12 15:31:49 2015 UTC,"6 , Never had a thing for girls sexually Edit: numbers are bad"

gaybros,3d0j5p,EnForgeant,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:58:06 2015 UTC,Apparently I subtracted 5 somewhere along the line haha. 6. I meant to say I am a 6
gaybros,3d0j5p,katycat737,2,Sun Jul 12 19:08:26 2015 UTC,"I would say pretty close to a 3. Maybe slightly more homosexual if I had to pick. Happily dated lots of girls in high school and only really realized I was bisexual near the end of college. I guess I just assumed every straight guy also thinks about hunks occassionally haha. I generally like being dominated though, which has been easier to fulfill with men, so I've been on a male streak for a while."
gaybros,3d0j5p,InsanelyIncredibly,2,Sun Jul 12 19:25:47 2015 UTC,"Probably 6 or 5.75... There are 2 girls that I admire a lot, sometimes I get dreams that I would marry them but maybe not have sex with them if that makes sense"
gaybros,3d0j5p,carcrash27,2,Sun Jul 12 18:47:22 2015 UTC,"Fooooour. Boobs being stuck everywhere, from ads to speedway, don't do anything for me, just like straight porn (why only she has pleasure?), but it doesn't mean that I'm not interested in women. Men - it's easier for me to get aroused, although public displays of men being sexual don't do anything for me as well."
gaybros,3d0j5p,vanisaac,2,Sun Jul 12 19:30:32 2015 UTC,about a 6 or 7
gaybros,3d0j5p,brushwood_dog,2,Sun Jul 12 20:28:41 2015 UTC,"I'm at least a solid 5. If it weren't for my emotional attractions screwing with me, I'd be a full-on 6."
gaybros,3d0j5p,josiahpapaya,2,Sun Jul 12 20:32:55 2015 UTC,Absolute 6.  Bearded clams have never really been my thing.
gaybros,3d0j5p,microwavedHamster,2,Sun Jul 12 22:21:08 2015 UTC,"I'm probably more of a 6, but if the stars aligned right, I might want to see what the fuss is about. I've made out with loads of girls before, but that's just for fun when I'm out drinking."
gaybros,3d0j5p,CoastalCity,2,Mon Jul 13 00:02:47 2015 UTC,"I don't really like the Kinsey scale. It doesn't seem to adequately reflect reality. An attraction toward males doesn't automatically translate into a repulsion of the same amount toward females. Also, asexual people are not taken into account in the Kinsey scale.  What would be more accurate to me would be a two-dimension graph, with one axis being attraction toward males and the other attraction toward females.  With that in mind, here's where I would fit on such a graph.  M                                                    x                                                                         F"
gaybros,3d0j5p,microwavedHamster,2,Mon Jul 13 04:02:34 2015 UTC,"The issue is that the Kinsey Scale is just a metric of someone's sexual history. 0 being exclusively hetero, 6 being exclusively homo, 3 being perfectly bi - and X for no experience.  So a gay can be 100% gay, but have a rating of 0, because they fooled around with a girl in high school and have done anything else.  Or an asexual can have a rating of 3, because they experimented with one of each."
gaybros,3d0j5p,CoastalCity,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:02:14 2015 UTC,"Hmm. In that regard, then yes the Kinsey scale makes sense. I'm not sure people are interpreting it that way though."
gaybros,3d0j5p,joeydball,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:04:46 2015 UTC,Ignorance and oversimplification. Though others might see it as intentional misunderstanding to promote snowflake-ism.
gaybros,3d0j5p,throwaway43894389,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:33:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, according to the Kinsey scale I'm a 3, but I'm fully gay. I just had some girlfriends before I came out."
gaybros,3d0j5p,microwavedHamster,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:54:31 2015 UTC,So the vertical axis(y) represents your attraction to Men and is a 3 out of 7? And the horizontal axis(x) represents your attraction to women and is a 5 out of 7?
gaybros,3d0j5p,throwaway43894389,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:14:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I guess so. I arbitrarily used the same amount of units than the Kinsey scale. Don't really how he came up with 7 units on his scale though. I wonder why he chose this?
gaybros,3d0j5p,microwavedHamster,2,Mon Jul 13 01:11:05 2015 UTC,"Not sure either. But let me take a guess: It definitely has to be an odd number of units. With the middle being equally attracted to both men and women. In the kinsey scale that's a 3. 0 being 100% heterosexual and 6 being 100% homosexual.  With this scale, 2 levels separate being a 50/50 bisexual and a 100% homosexual. The same is true from being a 100% heterosexual to being a 50/50 bisexual. 2 levels is pretty flexibile from the extremes to the 50/50. If he made it a 5 unit scale only 1 level separates the extremes to the middle and that is pretty limiting. Having a 9 unit scale has 3 level separation and that might be too much. I don't know, I'm just guessing lol."
gaybros,3d0j5p,dommitor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:15:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah it makes total sense, but only if you see the degree of attractiveness as being a fixed percentage. I think it's not the case in reality. I think sexuality is fluid and can be influenced by a person's surroundings (to a certain extent of course), like if a straight guy is working with hot and attractive coworkers, or if there's a certain event in the past that deeply affects him or her.   Come to think of it, it should be a range, not a single number. I think the two axis graph I did was a better representation of sexual desires than the Kinsey scale, but still not accurate enough. With a third axis with time on it, we could have this data.  Sorry I'm thinking outloud here haha"
gaybros,3d0j5p,indomante,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:31:46 2015 UTC,"0 is meant to be no attraction to the other gender whatsoever. For this kind of scale when you're measuring attraction to both men and women the zero is pretty mute.  The Kinsey scale isn't mean to be an end-all sexual indicator, it's meant to measure how attracted one is to the same sex."
gaybros,3d0j5p,southernliberal,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:16:36 2015 UTC,Good response :)
gaybros,3d0j5p,Fortinbros,3,Mon Jul 13 02:19:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but if I may get all mathy, one could easily take this graph and project all the points onto y=6-x and you'd have your Kinsley scale once again. Although, if you did that, asexuals would be threes."
gaybros,3d0j5p,Canines_and_Cards,3,Mon Jul 13 02:10:58 2015 UTC,"Just sayin' but this is a bad question  You're just gonna get a bunch of number responses.  If you wanna poll, run a poll."

While I certainly wouldn't turn down a muscle-bound Adonis under normal circumstances, if I had a choice between Adonis and a guy without much meat on him, I would probably choose the latter.  Eddie Redmayne, Cillian Murphy, and especially Ben Wishaw are my celebrity crushes.  And not all skinny guys are twinks--in fact I don't even consider myself attracted to twinks.  Twinks are young and stupid and maybe a little feminine, my type of guy is more masculine.  So if you're skinny, don't feel like you have to force yourself into the twink label.  All this is just to say that, trust me, we're out there.  Of course there are probably more people who prefer perfect muscles, but that's only natural, much like straight guys usually go for girls with big boobs.  There are still plenty of straight guys who love small-boobed girls.  TLDR I love skinny guys"

I look very much like he did in his ~320lbs pic.  I'd say you don't have much to be worried about if you describe yourself as thin, skinny, slender, and/or slim. Take a walk in my shoes for a day and see the hatred that gay men have for an overweight gay, and you'll appreciate the situation that you're in.   I've developed a strong aversion to gay men because of it.  That said... not unhappy, despite how the post makes things seem. Down ~20lbs, aiming for ~240 as an initial big goal. Ideally I'd like to get under 200, but I'd be thrilled if I could hit 220. I caused my own weight gain and don't blame anyone else for it, but being overweight... especially in the lgbt community... makes you sub-human and deserving of abuse. That goes for in-person and online, with reddit being no better. Hence the throwaway and constant lurking in gaybros, /r/ainbow, etc."

I've been a subscriber on /r/broslikeus for a while on different accounts and I've seen quite a few top posts of gay men of different races. So maybe /u/habitushabitat just isn't as addicted to porn as I am lol. Anyway, I clicked on the link and it looks like you have already made some changes. I wasn't offended by the previous banner, but I appreciate the fact you listened to the concerns of the guys here and actually added some color to the banner. It means a lot."
gaybros,3cypyk,indigolalafell,3,Sun Jul 12 22:00:56 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest. I didn't listen to /u/habitushabitat, the 50+ private messages calling me a 'nazi' or a 'racist' (holy hyperbole batman) or anyone else who was pretty hateful in their responses. I listened to /u/pangelboy. He's an active member of the subreddit, he had a legitimate concern and he brought it up without any vitriol or unnecessary drama. I'm not unreasonable. I just ask that people be respectful. While I didn't agree with it at first, I did think about it and there is a lack of diversity from the top rated comments of all time, which is what I used for the first banner. The next banner to be made, which might come out in the next couple of days, will be entirely new. I'm considering not using any of the posts from /r/BrosLikeUs at all and just picking out x number of random images that would fit in. However, images that would represent the different areas and things people are into, as well as different categories. Everything from snowboarding to golf. Just a slice of something for everyone, rather than the same generic images.  I do appreciate the feedback though man. I appreciate being recognized for at least listening to people. If anyone wants to tell me anything, I only ask that people bring it up calmly and respectfully. I'm a moderator, but I'm also a dude and I got my own shit going on in my life. I don't need random people yelling at me. Just treat me like a person and I'll treat you like a person.   So, I'd like to apologize to anyone who did take offense to the banner. I don't understand why you did, but I don't need to. It was generic, it was all white guys, so I switched it up a bit. I'll switch it up more later."

gaybros,3cypyk,dhicock,2,Sun Jul 12 22:14:56 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing I hope you can understand. I'm able to recognize the clear distinction between an unintentional mishap or oversight and actual racism or discrimination. Although all gay men face forms of micro-aggressions and discrimination, gay racial minorities often face an extra form of racial biases from the gay community that whites don't. We often feel alienated from both our racial communities, society at large for treating us as second class citizens, and the gay community, which is one we are falsely told is one of acceptance (though there are definitely some safe places for us).    It is incredibly easy to become bitter, jaded, and easily offended because of these abuses. I understand why some well intentioned white gay men (I'm assuming you are white, so I'm sorry if I'm wrong) will feel attacked, but then there are too many white gay men telling us to shut up and that our voices do not matter. It's easy to let our anger blind us and it was something I've had to deal with myself."
gaybros,3cypyk,pangelboy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:12:53 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm glad that you were able to. This was in no way an act of discrimination or racism. To be fully honest, I made the banner while stoned as fuck. I'm still stoned as fuck. I just went clicking and dragged in images, without paying attention to what they were until after the fact. When noticed, I changed the banner. I didn't notice until someone pointed it out while not being hostile. If I feel like a comment is attacking me, I won't care what's in it. I'll dismiss it. We all get attacked for a variety of things, whether that's racism or not. In my case I had a dream recently of cycling across the country. When I proposed that dream, and asked for help, I got over 800 emails and facebook messages telling me to kill myself, that my idea was shit, that I was a scammer, that it was pointless, etc. I'm still kind of reeling from that, and when I got an overwhelming amount of private messages just screaming at me, I sort of mentally shut down and didn't pull out of it until I read /u/pangelboy's comment. When I did, I read everything and saw what people were talking about. It just took someone to be polite and raise the concern over being relatively hostile.   So I am sorry if I came off as a cunt or rude or discriminatory. It wasn't meant to be. Just have a life and my own things going on that skewed my response and reaction."

He thinks that the banner lacking in diversity is a problem. He's well entitled to use problematic here as he sees fit.   You didn't really respond to him. You just bashed the word problematic without giving any credence to what he said otherwise. That's the definition of an ad hominem attack."
gaybros,3cypyk,cortex112,-2,Sun Jul 12 18:34:29 2015 UTC,"That's not insulting him though. It's just stating that the word is misused, and overused, to the point it is meaningless.  He is fully within his right to be upset at the lack of diversity, but to blame you, mods, users, etc is far from the root of the issue. This is a lot bigger issue than a banner on a small subreddit. (No offense, but 17k users is relatively small for reddit)  If we use problematic for every trivial issue, it waters the word down. It's the same as using ""critical issue"" when your email doesn't work in the office. If you say everything is a ""critical issue"" it makes it where nothing seems to be ""critical"" so when something actually critical happens, you are apathetic to it, assuming it on the same level as ""I forgot my password""  Same concept as ""boy who cried wolf"""

If peopl have grievances, to let me know and I'll try to fix them. What I had a problem with were people telling me to lie. As I've said, those banners were made with the top rated posts. I had to go to page 11, and post 300, to get an image that was of a guy who wasn't white. That guy you called hot as fuck? Has NEVER been posted to /r/BrosLikeUs. That makes me extremely uncomfortable because I'm pushing images on the subreddit that they didn't vote on. Which is why the next time I make a banner, I'll be making a text post and asking for people to vote on the images there.  People posting more photos of dudes who aren't white will fix the issue. Hell, people posting at all. I can count on two hands the amount of active posters on the subreddit. We have 17,000 subscribers but only about 10-15 active posters. Everything comes from them and their personal taste, so of course it's going to be biased. If we actually encourage more people to vote, we'll have more images to choose from.   I get the issues, but I just don't see how it isn't on the subscribers themselves to fix the issue.   I'm sorry if I've come off as a dick or abrasive, it wasn't my intention. I am a bit defensive right now but only due to the landslide of responses I got in my personal inbox. I have gotten attacked all day, being called a racist scummy piece of shit, all because I made that banner. That's all I did. Took the images and made it. Diversity was the last thing on my mind, I just went looking for images that would fit in the banner and ones that were upvoted. I didn't expect... this.  I'm just grateful you actually post. So far you're one of the only people here who I actually take seriously. You're an active member of the community. Your opinion has weight. People who never post mean nothing to me. I'm uncomfortable with being pushed into changing the banner, but I did just to shut everyone up. I get the problem, but it's not one I can fix as the banner maker."

gaybros,3cypyk,habitushabitat,18,Sun Jul 12 20:52:11 2015 UTC,"Although I wouldn't mind seeing some diversity, it is not at all uncommon for most subs to make a header using the highest upvoted submissions. Quite common and unless the guy who made it was specifically thinking about races I wouldn't be pulling the race card. White guys are not all that is posted there. I suggest you go to the mod message posted in the sub and leave your feedback there like the guy asked. Banners are not permanent and frequently change. Demanding every banner represent every race is just silly."

This is not the first time we have been accused of racism in the past because of the banner. I used to make a BrosLikeUs banner that had guys in the letters. We got lambasted for racism because I didn't have 'diversity' in it. We had to explain then that it was from the top rated posts. That's all it is. It's a representation of the most commonly upvoted posts on the subreddit. There is diversity, it's just not as obvious. Even then, diversity is on the posters. It has nothing to do with the moderators and everything to do with what people want to post. We have 17,000 subscribers. We can't be plugging in all content there, we have subscribers who do that for us. If people want to see more diversity, they're suggested to post as well."

But way to completely absolve yourself of any responsibility for the culture you've created in your sub by putting the onus on posters, as if they weren't responding to the overt and covert messaging you set by your sidebar, the moderation actions you take, and the choices you make about how to present your sub to the rest of the reddit community. Maybe instead of victim blaming, like a rapist who excuses his own evil because his victim was wearing revealing clothing, you should start acting like a man and take personal responsibility for the choices you make. For example, there is no law that says you have to make your banner image a collage of the highest ranked posts - that's a choice that you made, and you are responsible for the message your choice sends, not anyone else."

I've even got rules over in the sidebar saying that you can't post anyone who isn't white. They're right there and I make sure they're upheld. I also make sure to take posts from all over the internet and incorporate them into the banner, even though the subreddit themselves didn't say if they liked it or not. Sure, I want to push things on them that they didnt chose and pick images to reflect something they havent voted on.  You want change? Be change. Stop sitting behind your keyboard and calling me a racist. You have NEVER posted to /r/BrosLikeUs. Forgive me if you I think everything you say is horseshit until you do something instead of screaming at the top of your lungs.  Feel free to post to /r/BrosLikeUs. I'm extremely tempted to ban you just because of how utterly crass, insulting, belittling and vapid you're being but I am not an asshole.

Is it because someone can't afford their own place without roommates? Is it because ""we spend so much time together anyway that is just makes sense?""Those are the big first steps to get past. The answer to all of those questions should be NO, by the way.  Can you poop at each other's places? If yes, continue on.  Have you seen each other at your worst, I mean your absolute soul-crushing worst? Do you still love each other knowing that the person you're moving in with is capable of that? If yes, keep going.  Can you or he afford the places you're looking at solo or would you need roommates? Good info there...associated with that,   What is the exit strategy? If things go south, who goes and who stays?  DO YOU KNOW EACH OTHER'S FINANCES? How much debt does he have and do you know? How much do you have? What does he make annually and per paycheck? How much of that goes to bills? What bills? What's his credit score? What's yours? Do either of you have retirement, 401k or savings accounts? How much do you contribute? Do either of you get money from Mom and Dad or other family and how long will that continue? THIS IS HUGE. If you don't know this and/or can't talk about it, don't move in. Period.  Food and Cleaning, are you two compatible roommates? People moving in forget that there's all the relationship issues you encounter when you move in and can no longer ignore little things, but there's also the basic roommate issues that have to be dealt with. Does he eat out or in? Do you? Who cooks and what do you both like to eat? Who will clean and who does what? How often do each of you go out and how often do you have people over? How important (very) is personal time for just the two of you and for each other as individuals? How will you get that?

gaybros,3d0fhs,broaway999,2,Sun Jul 12 17:00:35 2015 UTC,"You do what works for you. There's no right way and it is affected by previous relationships, previous living arrangements, etc. If you have both always had roommates, it's probably going to be easier than if you have lived alone for years.  If you're moving into a new place it makes things a little easier, as there isn't the feeling that you're either taking over their home or have had your home taken over.  You may want to split everything equally, but that can be hard if one of you earns more than the other.  When I moved in with my bf, we decided that since we earn similar amounts, we would split everything equally, but we wanted to keep our finances separate.  We set up a joint account for all shared costs: the mortgage, household bills, holidays, groceries, eating out, furniture and other joint purchases. We each have a standing order to pay a fixed sum into that account each month.  This avoided the problem of each paying separate bills or deciding who pays for what, or splitting the bills each month. If neither of you relishes the idea of reconciling your expenses every month, but you want to keep things equal, this works great. All we have to do is top up the account every so often when we get a text from the bank saying we've spent more than usual.  Note that I'm in the UK where bank accounts and transferring money is free of charge, so it doesn't cost us anything to have this arrangement; I realise this isn't necessarily the case everywhere."
gaybros,3d0fhs,chronug,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:02:12 2015 UTC,"First off, congrats! The only person I ever lived with aside from my immediate family is my husband. It was one of those situations where he was looking at an apartment and said ""I'm moving here whether you are or not."" And I said ""well then, I suppose I'll move in since I'll be here all the time anyway."" And that was that. Little dos I know how different it would be.  What to expect:  -Your bf will always be there. It's great when you're happy, but when you're fighting and need some space it's a definite eye-opener. - You work better as a team. - Possible personality clashes. Example: My husband is very OCD, so when I would clean the apartment before he got home, he would come in and re-straighten everything. At first, I was offended. But now I just chalk it up to the disorder and don't let it bother me. Either way, the surface is clean. He just worries more about placement.  What not to expect: -Who handles the bills, who pays for what? We got a joint account and left it at that. Some couples have their own accounts and they pool together for bills. But for us, it was easier and feels more like a unit.  -Furniture: Decide on pieces together. Go cheap at first since you're just starting out, but if things don't work out, you have to be amicable in who gets what. Or, just go halfsies on everything and call it a day.  Chores: Just split them. You may have a chore you hate so you might make a compromise like ""ok, I'll take out the trash if you scrub the sink.""  Clothing: Some (a lot) of gay couples end up sharing clothes. I find that to be a little weird, and lucked out since my husband and I are completely different sizes. The only thing we end up sharing are socks because they're a bitch to fold and separate. Other than that, he's got his and I've got mine. But if you are the kind of couple that shares clothes, then more power to ya."

gaybros,3d0fhs,bernie16wb,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:21:07 2015 UTC,"Keep everything 50/50, I'd say. My partner is a househusband so he pays the bills and buys the groceries and makes the dinner and gives me the receipts and we split it down the middle. Sometimes we sort it out by me taking him out for dinner on the weekend or sometime during the week. I personally think that when you divide up the labor so each of you has shit that you do it works better than taking turns doing things. He always washes the dishes and tidies around the house. I take the garbage out, walk the dog etc. I would say if you can afford it to definitely move into a 2bdrm place where you can spend time away from each other. Also, I don't know your relationship but I definitely don't think you've been dating long enough where you should move in with each other. I think you should date someone for a bit longer before you take that step, especially since the first 3 months of living with your partner is hell. My biggest piece of advice for bros moving in with each other is to always be gracious and voice your appreciation for things. It will make you both strive to please each other by making a nice home for yourself. I always make sure to notice how hard my man works to keep the house in order, make special care to compliment his cooking (even if it's shit) and throw in a ""god, you're handsome"" for good measure."

I started with a process blog to develop my eye -- just a starting point so you can see which of the photographs you take jump out at you, forming a pattern or a style, or just a preference. I myself own a Fujifilm XT 1 with 18-55mm and 16mm wide angle lens (hoping to change the zoom lens to another fixed lens soon; these lenses are expensive).  Grab a big tumblr theme, scrounge a version of Lightroom and get started with a Fujifilm X100T or one of the Sony mirrorless cameras -- these are considered the best starting points, bit there are many others. Just do some research.   My own process blog: commonwealthy.tumblr.com -- It provides peeks into the spaces I occupy and things I'm doing. I find that, years later, looking back on the first things you posted and seeing how you've improved organically is a very satisfying experience.  Good luck to ye :) Share your photographs.

gaybros,3czto0,commonwealthy,2,Sun Jul 12 09:07:34 2015 UTC,"Fellow designer/photographer here.I agree with this. Don't try to live up to someones standards when it comes to taking pictures. Just do it for yourself. Sony is a good place to start if you're looking for a cheaper mirrorless alternative, just bear in mind that you will need to purchase a lens (those can get expensive). Start out with a zoom! If you're looking to train your eye, I suggest getting a really cheap analog camera. It will make you think about each picture you're taking, before just randomly snapping away."
gaybros,3czto0,boxx_box,2,Sun Jul 12 09:59:18 2015 UTC,"As a photographer who sidelines as a designer, I completely agree with this. Find a camera that fits your lifestyle and budget, one that you can feel comfortable taking anywhere.   My friend uses wal-mart disposable cameras but ends up with these stunning compositions, and has recently just won a local photography award. At first it might seem like the photography world only cares about the newest high-tech gadget; and in many cases that's true. But in the end it's the photos that last, and that you'll be the most satisfied with.   For mirrorless suggestions Olympus has actually served me fairly well so far. It's pretty sturdy for hiking/canoeing/day trips/everyday events rather than lugging my DSLR around.  Fujifilm and Sony are also great bets.   Make sure you find a platform to display them, and link us once you start going!"

I have an Olympus E-PL2 (due for an upgrade) so I'm invested in the Micro Four Thirds system (basically Olympus and Panasonic bodies).  It's true that the Fuji and Sony bodies have an edge due to their larger sensors, but the Micro Four Thirds lens selection outclasses both by far, and that's something you should consider when picking a system.  Regardless of which route you go, I highly recommend getting started with a reasonably-priced bright prime lens of medium focal length. This is a great way to train yourself as a photographer while also getting usually sharper images than with zoom lenses. In the Micro Four Thirds system which is what I'm familiar with, this would be something like the Olympus 25mm F1.8."

gaybros,3czto0,r4ptor,2,Sun Jul 12 13:02:22 2015 UTC,"I am not into it anymore (I moved from Photography to 3D art) but I can tell you lots that you need to know. Some advice:   -DONT...I repeat DONT get caught up in brand wars. (Canon vs Nikon, etc). There is something important here though that I'll come back to.   -Start small, but not too small. Buy a camera body, get a 50mm 1.4 or 50mm 1.8 lens with it, and practice the crap out of learning how to shoot manual. Know your aperture, shutter, and ISO.   -Practice getting the best shot you can through the lens by thinking about your composition. When shooting, think to yourself ""Would I hang this on the wall?"" If not, rearrange your composition or find a new interesting subject.  -Don't go off and start shooting weddings/events. These are huge beginner mistakes and can get you sued. You also will not have the gear for it starting out, (Wedding/Event photographers often carry insurance for this reason).  Now, back to the brands: Don't get caught up in the brand wars, but also realize when you choose a brand, you want to look at a few things:   -Lens selection. Camera bodies will change over time, but your lenses will be good for a very very very long time. You want to choose a brand that has the lenses you like to shoot with. I personally liked Canons lens lineup with lots of awesome primes when I was in to photography. Others like Nikon or Sony.   -Camera ergonomics. Go hold the cameras in the store. If its not comfortable to you you won't want to use it. Again, I liked Canons ergonomics, while my buddy hated them and liked Nikons ergonomics. Go hold the camera you want to get (or a similar series).   The biggest thing is to start small. Too many people want to rush out and buy all kinds of gear at first, don't make that mistake. A camera body and a 50mm 1.4 or 1.8 lens is all you need to start your hobby. Get good and reward yourself with a new lens."
gaybros,3czto0,Tiki_Torch,2,Sun Jul 12 16:49:51 2015 UTC,"Another gaybro photographer here. I do sideline product work for Jeep parts and products, and as a hobby wilderness and landscape work since I'm often out there given its Jeep. I also have worked under Sony as a mirrorless specialist for their sales, so I'm obviously biased, but if you have any questions about Sony mirrorless cameras or lenses, I can answer them. Great cameras and portable to boot.   Like most have said though, start simple. Get a body, a kit lens with a zoom lens as well and maybe a good 35 or 50mm prime with a 1.8 fstop for artistic work. Good place to start.  A good teaching app that is free is called ""Sololearn Learning Photography"" available for Android and apple devices (free to download!) It covers all photography basics and shows video clips to explain things, I extremely recommend it for casual learning."
gaybros,3czto0,JSSJeepin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:09:32 2015 UTC,"Cool! Would you recommend I start off with just a kit lens? I'm thinking about buying 50mm f/3.5 kit lens, but I also want to buy a f/1.8 lens. The f/1.8 lens would be another $300, but do you think this is necessary for a beginner? I mostly want to take street and food photography."
gaybros,3czto0,JSSJeepin,2,Sun Jul 12 17:17:07 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you're willing or wanting to do from the get-go. Kit lenses are always a good starter lens because they're basically a decent all around use lens with a wide side to allow family events and most casual encounters to fit into the frame. If you're talking about the 16-50mm kit lens included on Sony mirrorless, they're decent, but at 16mm they do have what's called barrel distortion at the edges, so take care not to have important subjects near the edge, but all other focal lengths on this lens are fine. The first 2 photos I ever sold were taken with this lens (official model number is SEL1650PZ) and the NEX6 body (older version of the A6000) which I still utilize today. As for the Prime lens, I know it's more money, but that 1.8 will produce some gorgeous photos that will really impress you. The increased aperture of 1.8 will do 2 things for your photos; it will let in more light so those darker restaurants won't be an issue, and the extra light within the lens will also scatter more which produces, as a side effect, a narrower or shallower depth of field which is what most people associate with 'professional' style photos (think blurry background) the larger the fstop (numerically lower, though, so it's inverse which confuses most people) the more this effect is amplified, so a 1.8 lens can produce brighter and blurrier backdrops over a 3.5 lens. If you're isolating a subject with blurriness, the 1.8 lens will work so much better over the kit 3.5. Even in bright daylight, this effect is just as apparent."
gaybros,3czto0,bernie16wb,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:43:29 2015 UTC,Could I just get the body and just the f/1.8 lens?
gaybros,3czto0,MattHardwick,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:49:01 2015 UTC,You could though you might find it limiting (or you could enjoy the restriction) to only have one focal length.
gaybros,3czto0,tommysboy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:01:43 2015 UTC,"Getting just one lens will limit the kinds of pictures you can take, spending a fortune on good lenses is pointless until you understand what you are getting and differences all the different numbers will make.  If you want a low f stop lens, I recommend the Canon EF 50 mm f/1.8 II Lens if you can still find one, or the updated version Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM but the latter is a little more expensive. Often it's called nifty fifty or plastic fantastic by those in the biz. The price is insane given the quality and f/stop but it gets that low price because it's a plastic lens instead of glass. Obviously this recommendation is based on a Canon body.  If you get something like this I would heartedly recommend that you get something with a longer and adjustable focal length too. A lot of Canon cameras come with a good 55-250mm lens, that's usually around f/4 which is good enough for most things. I am sure that if you are a Nikon man, that they'll have something similar also.   I would recommend Canon because they offer the most flexibility going forward as all Canon cameras support the same lens fitting and Canon lenses also work on Sony Cameras and are supported too with a cheap adapter so your lens investment isn't wasted if you upgrade your body or if you jump to Sony bodies for say Video work if thats your thing, as they are excelling in that market at the moment.  Full disclosure though ! I work for Canon.  I was discussing  only today - a lot of people can be snobbish about kit lenses, but there is no need to be. For someone who really wants to get into it, get a kit kit with a couple of kit lenses and get used to the camera first, then start upgrading the lenses. If you don't believe me, I have all the Canon lenses available at my disposal and 4 out of my 5 top photos were taken with kit lenses on a 600D (think the US model is T3i). If you are interested I can send you some good shots to prove how good kit lenses really can be."

He handed me ""photography for dummies"" and a disposable camera and said ""when you make a great picture with this, I will give you a real camera"" Let's say it took 3 years but I think its a great tactic for anyone who thinks they want to get serious about this.

gaybros,3czto0,findingphilly,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:25:41 2015 UTC,"Avid amateur here with a slightly different approach for you: don't ""buy into"" a system whether mirrorless (M43rds (Olympus/Panasonic), Fuji X, Sony) or traditional (Canon/Nikon) until you have a better sense of what you want to shoot and how you want to shoot it. Photography is/can be a hideously expensive hobby; choosing the wrong ""platform"" could end up really costing you.  Buy yourself a decently featured superzoom camera. Cap your spend at, say, $500. Make sure it captures RAW photo files and has a full manual mode, so you can learn about aperture, speed, ISO. I'd also look for the smallest product possible so it can live on as your ""throw it in your pocket"" camera, which just about every serious photographer has.  There are a zillion reasons why the products these other guys are recommending are great - but until you know how to use them, and what you want to shoot...? You're buying blind."
gaybros,3czto0,AcidicR,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:37:01 2015 UTC,"I'm only an amateur photographer, it's only a hobby, so I just do it for the love of doing it is all.   I like shooting in RAW or DNG (digital negative), which gives me a nearly unprocessed data file, directly from the camera sensor to work with rather than let the camera process it to the manufacturer's generic idea of what the photo should look like.  I then use Adobe's Lightroom to develop what I shoot, crop and do other finishing touches before I save high quality, smaller jpeg file images of what I shot.  I prefer a DSLR camera myself since it's a lot more versatile, with more lenses and other available add ons that I can use for different purposes.   Edited because I forgot to add;  Check and see if there are any photography clubs in your area that will let you attend the meetings and check them out before you join. I belong to one and have learned a great deal there. There are some that can be kind of snobby, so you may have to check out a few and see which one you feel the most comfortable about joining."

Also what do you weigh/what weight class do you think you'll want to compete in?   As far as what you should do to prepare it's going to depend on what your current fitness level is as well as your experience level with wrestling in general.   Care to give a little bit more info on those?
gaybros,3d009o,bernie16wb,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:35:35 2015 UTC,College club Only experience was a 3 day camp when I was in elementary school. To introduce kids to the basics before we hit middle school.  I plan on wrestling at 125 or so. I weigh 160 right now post surgery from a bad accident.
gaybros,3d009o,bernie16wb,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:15:41 2015 UTC,Did you accident leave you with any injuries that are going to limit your mobility?   Also what kind of shape are you in at 160? If you're not fairly soft I'd suggest maybe bumping up the goal weight class a bit.
gaybros,3d009o,kcos,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:21:08 2015 UTC,"What's your cardio look like? Honestly it depends all on your cardio not so much your strength. What style and weight class? How much are you having to cut or are you maintaining?   Wrestling is a 100% lifestyle not a sport. I would be up 3 hours before class to eat and work on conditioning then midday was strength with more conditioning. Afternoon was spent on the mats working techniques and strategies for meets.   There are a few strength exercises I'd recommend. Cleans, dead lifts, and sled work. Make sure you actually keep yourself limber and stretched. Building muscle mass can make you tight and cause you to risk strains and pulled muscles."
gaybros,3d009o,kcos,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:01:18 2015 UTC,My cardio will include sprint work and distance runs. Right 160 but looking to wrestle at 125 or so. I don't know what style yet but can tell you this is college club
gaybros,3d009o,HurrandDurr,2,Mon Jul 13 18:18:20 2015 UTC,"So freestyle then. If you're going to cut down to 125# I would seriously just work on cardio over strength. The hardest thing you're going to deal with is maintaining your weight. I was at 163# and my normal walk around weight is 220 so during the off season I'd jump to 200# and have to cut down to 180# before the start of the season and then before the first meet I was already at 160.   As far as strength training I'd skip it and go straight for cardio. The problem is people don't understand that wrestling and jiu jitsu aren't the same as running. You'll go from aerobic to anaerobic and constantly changing back and forth. My suggestion os if you're going to be a walk on is to get to the mats and learn some technical knowledge of the sport along with running, biking, and stairs.   There is a reason wrestling is a grind."

I realize masturbation an important part of your life, and you love wrestling porn. But for some of us, combat sports is a big part of our very real lives.  The whole point of /r/gaybros is that gay man can become anything they choose. They don't have to be limited to the ""gay professions"" of 20 years ago. They can be engineers, or farmers, or join the military. In their spare time they can play ball or do MMA.  So you've now got five guys on this thread who do combat sports. We are telling you that when you are on the mat, you don't think about sex. And you keep going on turning the whole thing into a pervo fantasy. Are you trying to be a troll, or are you just not willing to accept that there are gay fighters out there?  All of us who do these sports have to deal with the judgements of guys like you. I was teaching martial arts to college and high school students possibly before you were born. I had to come out to my fellow blackbelts one by one, introduce them to my boyfriend, and make sure we had enough trust that they didn't think I was out to grope them on when we were practising take-downs. I kept my sexual identity secret to the public to avoid exactly the kind of creepiness that you are oozing all over.  Get to a martial arts class and give it a try for three months. You might find that it changes your life. Hopefully it would make you less of a creep, if nothing else. Or don't go. It's no difference to me.

A shaved and not maintained hole feels like fucking sandpaper when the stubble comes in.   I bareback my husband but use condoms with everyone else. I've posted on /r/topsandbottoms about this a lot. I think shaved is super hot if you're gonna keep it constantly shaved, but if you won't realistically keep it that way, go for trimmed. That's why a lot of mega-star porn bottoms like Dawson have a trimmed hole with a little bit of hair. Hot, and easier to maintain"

It's probably going to be a lot more collectable than the M235ix, just like the M-version of the previous 1 series.  However, from what I've heard, the M2 is going to be manual only.   If you're in legal, I'd recommend stepping up to the 435i instead. It's a lot more classy looking, and also, the interior doesn't feel as low rent as the 2-series. Also, in my opinion, the 3/4-series drives just as well as the 1/2-series.   A lot less practical alternative would be the Alfa 4C. The base price is not much higher than an 235ix with tuning would cost. I haven't driven that one yet, but I imagine it's even more of a drivers car than the 2-series (that's a bit soft imho)."

gaybros,3cz2lp,indomante,4,Sun Jul 12 20:38:10 2015 UTC,"Couple of things just so you've got the right info :-)  All BMW M-cars with two pedals have a DCT now - dual clutch, automated manual. SMG was a single-clutch automated manual, it was absolute trash, and it died out after the E46 M3 and E60 M5. Be thankful for that.  All BMW non-M cars with a two-pedal trans have the ZF 8-speed automatic. It's a fantastic transmission as far as slushboxes go, but it has a torque converter and should not be considered a ""DCT"" or ""automated manual"" at all.   What will you be doing with the car? The M235i is basically an ""M-Sport"" 2-series. It's not a true M car, but it's still damn good. Given we don't have any huge details on what the ""M2"" will be, I'd say get the 235i and use the money you save vs. the M2 to add some mods to make it ""your own"" i.e. wheels, better tires, intake, exhaust, whatever.  The big thing that you'll miss out on with the 235i is a limited-slip differential - but it's an option if you order the car to your spec at the dealer. I'd prefer RWD with the diff, versus AWD... but I'm a purist/snob/whatever and think that all BMWs should be non-turbo, I6, three-pedals, and driven from the rear wheels..."

gaybros,3ct1vq,megustadotjpg,21,Fri Jul 10 17:38:05 2015 UTC,"I think that nowadays the church is mainly a problem from a political point of view, I.e. the fact that Italian politicians are afraid of disappointing the Church (we even have a gay political leader who is always around cardinals). The biggest problem is, IMHO, the ideas that the Church has put in Italian society in the past.  There are some nuts who use religious arguments, but the majority of homophobes are not really religious. They just find homosexuality disgusting, unnatural and unmanly, hence should be hidden if not repressed. I have childhood friends who go to the church once a year and always talk bad about the Church, but are very homophobic."
gaybros,3ct1vq,valtomas,5,Fri Jul 10 18:02:28 2015 UTC,"I assume you are Italian, i got a question for you. Do you see any chance of gay marriage being passed in the foreseeable future?     I am from Argentina and we share very similar cultural roots and religious views. When gay marriage passed down here,  politicians made it abundantly clear that this was not an issue where the church should have a say.  Sure they were detractors but the society as a whole understood this concept and that it why the law passed.     I also have an Italian citizenship,  and i plan on living in Europe some time in the future, but i would love to know if, when i eventually get married with my bf,  the state is gonna recognize the union or not."
gaybros,3ct1vq,Andaru,9,Fri Jul 10 20:37:07 2015 UTC,"I think that something like a civil union (as in Germany) will be approved soon. The Church seems more interested in attracting young people than going after these topics (for instance, the Church didn't officially supported a recent ""pro traditional family"" rally while in the past they did), so politicians feel more free to carry on the idea. If some politicians don't chicken out or take stupid positions, it is just a matter of time. ""Marriage"", however, still sound like a big word here.  Another issue would be your life as a gay couple in Italy. In the big cities of the north, probably you would not have problems. But, honestly, I have never lived in Italy as an openly bi/gay guy."
gaybros,3ct1vq,unsureguy2015,4,Fri Jul 10 21:18:15 2015 UTC,"Recently individual cities have been skirting the law by recognizing same-sex marriages celebrated abroad despite the lack of laws and the opposition of some government figures. This is generally only a provocation to force the issue and start getting lawsuits going, but it did indeed work to get the supreme court sentence that it is a violation of equal rights and it must be fixed with a law.  The parliament is bickering on it, but something should come out by the end of the year. Not marriage outright, but something akin to what Germany has."
gaybros,3ct1vq,ruaidhri,6,Sat Jul 11 09:26:50 2015 UTC,"You cant entirely blame the Church. Ireland is far more geared towards the Catholic Church eg you must baptise your child to get a place in the local school. Catholicism is still the corner stone of rural Ireland. But it didnt stop the country legalising SSM. If anything the oppressive nature of the Catholic Church has polarised people in Ireland, against the Catholic Church and its values. However Ireland is now pretty much super liberal eg there is talk about legalising drugs in Ireland, when most old people believe alcohol is a horrific sin in the eyes of the catholic church  I think its just Italian Society in general. They are not considered the most Liberal people in Europe. They dont have the best respect for people depending on what part of the country, they come from eg there is north and south beef.

gaybros,3ct1vq,YourFairyGodmother,5,Fri Jul 10 21:24:30 2015 UTC,To be fair to the Italians they do have the Vatican right on their door step so that's bound to give the Church a stronger influencing position in Italy.

gaybros,3cwh8b,Das_ENGINER,6,Sun Jul 12 00:11:05 2015 UTC,"This is an opinion, I'm no doctor, take it for what you will.   I think it depends on how you define ""can't live without"".   If you're speaking in a more literal sense, I wouldn't say it's ""wrong"", but I don't think it's healthy. Feeling like this may just be a gut reaction, and not how you really feel. If you really feel like death or self-harming would be a real outcome of a separation, I would encourage seriously talking through it with one or a  few close friends, and a therapist if it's really serious.  If you're not speaking literally, then I don't necessarily think it's a concern (hyper-extreme cases excepted). I would view this (non-literal interpretation) not as ""I can't live without"", but more of a ""I really really really don't want to know or experience the loss associated with separating or what my life would be like without him"". I look at this as more of a very strong cherishing of the emotional and physical bond one has with their partner, and something that should be a part of a strong relationship at some level. If one or both of the partners doesn't feel this way at all (eg ""I'd be okay with losing you""), then I don't feel that's a healthy or sincere relationship either."
gaybros,3cwh8b,Das_ENGINER,5,Sat Jul 11 14:22:53 2015 UTC,Exactly. Why be in a relationship if you don't feel the person is extremely valuable and essentially irreplaceable?
gaybros,3cwh8b,funchords,4,Sat Jul 11 14:26:10 2015 UTC,"I'd even take it a step further and say that no one is replaceable.  One could argue that by ending a relationship and starting another one, you're effectively replacing the old with the new, but I think that's bunk. Yes someone new now fills the title of ""boyfriend"" or whatever, but people are far more than a title. I think new relationships are in addition to the old - the whole ""when one door closes another door opens"" mentality. The door that is now closed is still there, it still exists, it still has value, it still defines part of your hallway.  Not to say that some don't try and replace a lost one, just that it's a futile effort. They may replace aspects of them in so far as they have love/sex/etc in their life again, but anything more than that is a delusion."

gaybros,3cvfg0,Rikikato,7,Sat Jul 11 02:36:42 2015 UTC,"I'm living in the Northern Virginia area, but a little bit closer to the city.  Basically, when you are out around Reston, Chantilly, or Herndon, it's pretty much a suburban area, meaning lots of strip malls, lots of neighborhoods, and pretty tame.  The city, which would be a decent taxi/uber drive from you, has a lot to offer in terms of gay culture, nightlife, entertainment, and food.  There is always something to do if you can find your way into the city.  If I were you, I would try to maybe live closer to the city if you are looking for a more exciting experience.  Life here has its pros and cons - people accept you for being gay, tons of gays to date or have fun with.  There is a stigma that DC gays are stuck up and rude, and a lot of them are, but there are tons of good guys out there as well.  You just have to weed out the superficial egotistical types.  Good luck on this exciting time! It's hard moving somewhere so far from family, but it will be a great adventure and I'm sure you'll have a great time here.  And congrats on the job offer!"
gaybros,3cvfg0,Spang_alang,2,Sat Jul 11 03:09:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the words of encouragement!   I'm good with tame, but I'm also looking for excitement. Guess I'll take your words into consideration. I've been checking places to rent these past few days.   If you don't mind me asking, how's the public transportation system? Have you ever taken it? My biggest concern would be that it's not reliable."
gaybros,3cvfg0,Spang_alang,6,Sat Jul 11 03:39:12 2015 UTC,"Ah yes. Having to rely on public transportation terrified me when I first moved to DC, as I'm from the midwest where I never used it.  Overall, most of the time it is reliable, and only sometimes it's extremely frustrating.  It honestly depends on where you live, where you're going, and when you're using it.  I currently work in a weird area where I have to wait 10-12 minutes on a train sometimes if I just miss one, which can be frustrating.  I just deal with it by reading books, which I've actually learned to enjoy the time to read.  I kind of look like public transportation as like traffic.  Some days it's fine and somedays it's frustrating.  The great thing about DC Metro is it is VERY clean and from what I've heard, it's way better than any other metro lines.  If you are working in the places you mentioned, I would vote to look at places closer to the city along the orange or silver line.  I know a bunch of people that live in Ballston and like it, Clarendon and Courthouse are a little more expensive and closer to the city.  If you ever find a place you are looking to live at, you can comment or PM me and I'll answer any questions you have."

gaybros,3cvfg0,jm1872a,4,Sat Jul 11 18:15:15 2015 UTC,"Actually made an account just to respond to this. My years of living in NOVA suburbia can be useful! Here are the main points.  (1) As Spang-alang said, it really is suburbia. Public transit is mediocre that far out of the city. You will probably need a car for day-to-day.  (2) DC is way farther than it seems on a map. I worked in DC one summer while living in Herndon, and the commute was truly hellish. 40 minutes or so in morning traffic to the nearest metro (this is pre-silver line days), then a long metro ride down the orange line to downtown---and that's just one way. Not to mention how the metro shuts down pretty early compared to the rail systems in other cities, so it can be hard to ""spend a night out in the city"" from out there. When you can, it's great though---go to Nellie's if you like gaybros.  (3) I have high praise in particular for Reston. Reston is a planned community, and it shows. Lots of pools / tennis courts / parks all within walking distance. Never too far from a grocery store, etc. Well-maintained public spaces. Reston Town Center is a fun big open shopping space, with a few decent bars. It's suburbia, but at least it isn't pure ungodly sprawl---there's some thought behind it.  Final note: Fairfax County has one of the best public school systems in the country, if kids are anywhere on the horizon!"

I work in Reston and live closer to DC and it is a very long commute, whether by public transit or car (due to traffic). It should be better once the Silver Line is extended to Reston and Herndon, but that's still a few years off.   Not sure if you're planning on having a car or not but public transportation around there isn't horrible if you live in the right place. Getting by without a car probably wouldn't be too bad if you live near Reston Town Center and commute to Herndon or Chantilly, or if you live closer to DC and commute to Reston."

My biggest qualm about the area is the urban sprawl which in turn leads to traffic at any time but especially insufferable at rush hours. Being single, I would recommend living closer to a metro stop though you will pay more for it. It'll make going out much easier. However, the metro closes early even on weekends (like 2am or something; definitely check that). You will need a car to get to your job but thankfully if you live closer to the city you'll always be traveling against the weekday rush.  As for the cultural stuff, suburbs are not super great for single social life and unfortunately I have not experienced much of the LGBTQ side of things up that way, but there are plenty of other things to do in that area too."
gaybros,3cvfg0,Brake_L8,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:57:31 2015 UTC,"DC gay here who works in Court House (Arlington).  If you value your sanity, stick around the major ""urban villages"" like those in Arlington or closer to Metro stations.  This will be a major help when you want to go out into DC, which has a great gay scene.  The Metro shuts down at midnight on weekdays and 3 am on weekends, so be prepared for taxi/Uber rides back home, which can be costly if you're living out in Herndon or Chantilly.  Reston just got the Silver line, so it's a (long) subway ride into the city.  If you're looking for something sports-related to get into, check out the Stonewall league, which hosts things like kickball, dodgeball, bocce, etc.  Great way to meet new people in the area."

He very much enjoyed the clusterfuck, but his flaccid penis shows that he has tremendous amount of self control, which is a demand his history and culture required him to have. It shows character.   darkvstar's comment explains it better:   Wolfgang's reaction to the mindorgy is very important. Wolfgang calls himself a monster. I think his father sexually abused him. Did anyone else catch that? Wolfgang is not just ""in control"", he is a cold motherfucker who can disconnect when he wants to. The more I think about his character, the more I become convince that he is a stone cold killer. Will thought so too and used him to escape the Whisperer.

gaybros,3ctsku,thelowcrows,3,Sat Jul 11 02:50:11 2015 UTC,"Copying from a friend in a Facebook discussion:   So, to my point: Wolfgang repressed all signs of arousal despite orchestrating the whole thing - he's cerebral, curious, and was testing to see what he could do with the link when the others were in the right mood. Lito and Nomi channeled their arousal into their partners, the anchors of their lives, to the exclusion of everything but the Cluster. Will sublimated it into his workout, just like he pushes his savior complex and troubles with his dad into his job. And poor Capheus was in the wrong time zone, but more importantly isn't very sexual: he channeled the arousal into his admiration of Van Damme, almost perplexed (compare and contrast the public's belief of Africa/Kenya as sexually uninhibited because of HIV transmission rates - after all, his own mother and likely sister are positive)."

Harsh lighting, variable climate control (being wet in a cold room), noise, dozens of film crew members, multiple retakes and a corporate Human Resources department all have a way of rendering such scenes rather unsexy for the actors involved.

But if you're young, it might just be a case of performance anxiety.  I'm not an expert, and this is a simplification, but your nervous system is divided into two parts, sympathetic and parasympathetic.  They work together to allow you to orgasm.  Unfortunately, if either one is overactive, it can interfere with your sexual response.  When you mention how attracted you are to this guy, but then how you're shocked and embarrassed at how you aren't cumming, it actually makes a lot of sense with how your body's physiology works.  The more you worry about it, the more likely it is that you won't finish.    But that's okay.  Not everyone has to cum every time they have sex.  You can still look back and savor an experience, even if those few seconds at the end weren't what you wanted.  You can also communicate with your partner what feels good and what doesn't, ask to try something new, and even mention before the act that you think he's really sexy, even though you're not sure you'll cum tonight, but ""want him to cum all over your chest.""  Or something to that effect.  Use your words.  And if he's worth dating again, he'll put up with it.  And eventually, when you're not feeling so anxious, it'll just happen like that."

ArcticSky is going to tell you that he once had the same symptoms as you and that he died once from it.  If you run across Somekook he's going to tell you that you need to come out to your parents all over again and get yourself out of the closet and head straight to the doctor.

gaybros,3cuuhw,Jaybro93,2,Sat Jul 11 01:40:09 2015 UTC,"Hey there. Your story sounds very familiar to mine! I was the same - I used to masturbate to porn once a day or so, and had done so for a few years until the first time I slept with a guy (20 years old). Like you, I was pretty surprised to find that I just couldn't keep it up or cum, no matter what the guy tried.  Eventually (and after hearing someone else's similar experience) I realised that I had a porn addiction which may have been a part of the problem. I tried to stop watching porn/masturbating several times but just couldn't go without for more than a few days (which pretty much confirmed that this was a problem).  Fast forward a bit to a few months ago, I decided to get serious about sorting out this problem as it was really stopping me from wanting to pursue any sexual relationships whatsoever. I did a bit more research and found out that porn-induced erectile dysfunction is actually becoming a very common issue, particularly in young men. Many guys end up conditioning themselves to porn, to the point where their brain just doesn't identify being with a real partner as sexually arousing.  As it turns out though, there are a lot of people who have managed to overcome porn-induced ED by temporarily quitting porn/masturbation, and there are a lot of resources out there to help you do it. www.yourbrainonporn.com is probably the best site to find out more and read about others' experiences, and it's certainly helped me a lot. I've heard stories of guys who have quit porn/masturbation for a few weeks and found their ED cured, whereas for others it might take over a year. Personally I've been going for 50+ days now, and while I'm not able to get it up with a guy yet, I feel like I've made some progress.  Of course I'm not saying that this is definitely your issue, and if you're not sure, it never hurts to talk to a doctor. There are also other factors that can influence ED such as performance anxiety (and having ED once can make you more anxious about it in future). But the site I mentioned above is definitely worth a read in any case."
gaybros,3cuuhw,Scroticius,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:02:14 2015 UTC,Either you like a particular kind of porn and being with him did not match the type of porn or you have hangups about expectations or something that is interfering with your sexy mode whenever another human touches you.  Monitoring your thoughts for any changes may or may not help you depending upon how introspective you can be.    Try jacking off and mid-session switch to thinking about him jacking you off and see how your boner responds.  Lemme know what happens =O
gaybros,3cuuhw,ThreadonIt,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:24:23 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem once, I was in a relationship with a guy (didn't last long for this reason) and I could never get hard around him even though I really liked him and was it really embarrassing, especially being 20 at the time... I was fine using my hand and even with other guy, it was just him.  I just guessed it was nerves/anxiety of finding someone I liked and not being that confident at the time. 2 Years later and it hasn't happened since so fingers crossed."

gaybros,3cuuhw,kinsey3,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:19:42 2015 UTC,"Your first sexual relationship? Sounds like nerves/stage fright. The sooner you both accept that you won't necessarily cum every time, and that that isn't a failure or dysfunction and you can still fool around and have a good time, the more often you're likely to come in the future. If you're literally feeling nothing, then you probably want to change your masturbatory style or cut it out entirely for a while, as others have suggested, but my money's still on performance anxiety."
gaybros,3cuuhw,DarkArts13,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:02:42 2015 UTC,"So I'm probably saving you some time and money by telling you you don't have a medical condition, at least with what you've just told here that could hint at it. How old are you? If you're young, booze doesn't really make too much a difference (unless you're passed out drunk, or you're an alcoholic). Any medications you're taking? That could also be a factor to consider. If you're taking SSRI anti-depressants or Tricyclic anti-depressants, even anti-histamines like diphenhydramine, prescription pain killers (opiods) like vicodin, oxycontin, and of course everybody's favorite Marijuana, these can all cause decreased libido. Stop taking those (with your doctors knowledge of course) and you may get your mojo back.   Could it be you're just not in to this guy? You may ""like"" him a lot and you may even care about him, but that doesn't automatically mean you're sexually attracted to him. Or maybe it is anxiety, in which case you'd need to be evaluated by a professional. You don't have to take medication for that, maybe just change your way of reacting and thinking about the situation.   Hope this helps."
gaybros,3cs9rg,Porygon-2000,6,Fri Jul 10 10:44:12 2015 UTC,"I am not normally one to be a debbie-downer, and it's definitely a massive progress for Aussie sport considering our backwards ass government... but this doesn't necessarily trickle down to the players themselves. TL:DR at bottom.  I had the opportunity a year or so ago to have dinner and a few beers with a very well known top-tier football player, who happened to be friends with a coworker of mine at the time and also played for the team I support. I'm not sure how the topic came up, but my colleague started talking about another work mate who is gay and quite camp. Them not knowing I was deep as hell in the closet started making horrifying remarks about how disgusting gay people are... the footballer stated quite clearly that if any of his teammates were gay he would ditch the team and transfer to another because ""having a fag on my team is fucking wrong"".  Admittedly this is only 1 player, but this guy is a fucking hero to his supporters, and his attitude can have a negative effect. Interestingly enough he transferred teams less than a year later...  TL:DR - it's great that the football organisations support it publicly, but the players that have the most influence over their supporters can still be fuckwits."
gaybros,3cs9rg,jobentank,3,Sat Jul 11 01:29:36 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, that's true. But then again, players have always been failing to live up to standards, in any sport.  I mean, how many times have you heard of role models arrested for drunken disorderly conduct? Or drug abuse, or domestic violence or what have you?

gaybros,3crjj7,lilmeatwad,8,Fri Jul 10 15:57:36 2015 UTC,"It's interesting to think about this history of fashion. It's actually incredibly hard to define a singular ""men's style"" when you consider how many subcultures exist within fashion. As a history of the middle to upper class white male fashion, I'd say this video seems pretty accurate, despite the fact that the decades seem to jump between income levels.  Throughout the decades we view previous eras in a completely differently lens. The video implied that 2015 was sort of a combination of 60s and 80s nostalgia, and I'd agree. Right now, the standard well-dressed young man wears clothes that have slim, clean silhouettes, with a modern aesthetic that takes inspiration from preppy, ""vintage"" styles. Basically J.Crew and Uniqlo.  I think we're moving towards 30's, 50's, 70's and 90's era nostalgia. We are beginning to see more fashion-forward designers introducing new silhouettes; ones that feature higher waists, looser pants with higher hems, and tight fitting shirts and over-sized jackets and coats, and, alternatively, ones that feature the opposite (low-rise, slim pants with loose fitting tops). Arguably these were styles we saw at the end of the 80s and 60s, so it makes sense that our current trends are heading in this style. I'd argue the clothes seen in the film Her are probably a good prediction of how men's clothing might look in the coming decade.  It's just interesting to think of what this video would look like if 90's and 70's styles were more in. Right now we look back at those eras as disastrous and unattractive, but I would hedge my bets that this video would have depicted them drastically differently had been made 10 years from now."
gaybros,3crjj7,Fuckledore,3,Fri Jul 10 21:25:13 2015 UTC,"I didn't notice the jump between income levels when I first watched it, but after reading your comment I watched again with a more critical eye.  The '50s and '90s seem to be outliers; the rest are upper class looks, but the '50s and '90s looks they sampled seem like intentionally middle/lower class choices.  Maybe that's just indicative of where society got its fashion cues during those eras (aspirational fashion, trying to emulate the upper class, or rejecting that notion and going with a more ""working man"" look)?  It's interesting to view that choice with the economic and political structures in place at those times in mind.  2015 seems to be a middle of the road option: it's the uniform of wealthy, white, silicon valley tech workers, but it's also decidedly ""dressed down"" and casual.  It seems like the pendulum is swinging away from a rugged ""lumbersexual"" look to a more clean-cut, urban feel.  Just my thoughts."
gaybros,3crjj7,SFesq,3,Fri Jul 10 22:11:38 2015 UTC,"It seems like the pendulum is swinging away from a rugged ""lumbersexual"" look to a more clean-cut, urban feel.    Absolutely. ""Lumbersexual"" had jumped the shark by the time the descriptive term came into vogue; hipsters have looked like that since the mid-2000s. The clean-cut, urban look was flamboyant and foppish several years ago. Now it's the norm: not fashion forward but still tasteful.   The '50s and '90s seem to be outliers; the rest are upper class looks, but the '50s and '90s looks they sampled seem like intentionally middle/lower class choices.  Maybe that's just indicative of where society got its fashion cues during those eras (aspirational fashion, trying to emulate the upper class, or rejecting that notion and going with a more ""working man"" look)?    I personally think it's indicative of the how society, specially fashion subcultures, has nostalgically remembered those eras. I would think that this video's outfits were created by a stylist with a great deal of knowledge regarding fashion history. To her/him, those eras were defined by their lower-class styles. I would argue that the 90's look is more of a stab at how ""awful"" the 90's were for fashion. I'd say it's the most inaccurate depiction of a period they have; style's defined in 90's fashion continue to influence contemporary style. It's not really fair to remember the 90's for how suburban dads dressed, a demographic that has given little interest to sartorialism in modern history. The 90's was very anti-fashion in the sense that there was a mainstream rejection of 80's yuppy culture that took inspiration from conservative styles in the past (specifically the 50's). However, it's not as if there wasn't great, beautiful clothing being made that expressed this rebellious attitude."

Sure, a few don't, but either way that is not really an indication that a school is bad. Some of the best schools still use them. Why? Because they're just as good as whiteboards. Maybe a little messier, but private schools usually have cleaning people anyway. For me, the exceptions were language schools and labs, which always had whiteboards. One thing I always liked about blackboards is that if they're directly hit by sunlight, they don't blind you.  Oh yeah, about the old cars: it's real. Many poorer people have them. In the big cities public transportation is often not well-distributed enough and you just need cars. But cars in Brazil are comparatively extremely expensive. So the poorer people buy those incredibly old cars, because they cheap. Often they're actually illegal, unless you have a collector's plate, but yeah."

Can confirm, I do research in Cuba.  Many people have cell phones with touch screens, yet the infrastructure of buildings is pretty deteriorated. Economic policies (read: American business) has made it so that the influx of resources is directed at benefiting the company rather than actually improving the country's economic welfare. It's interesting that you connected the chalk board and the cell phone as parallel objects, as educational components, yet only one is actually a foreign supported object."

gaybros,3cpunt,untouchedURL,7,Thu Jul 9 20:31:24 2015 UTC,"I think a compelling hypothetical to bring up when it comes to ""personal beliefs"" and handing out licenses is interracial marriage. It's strikingly recent when you look at when interracial marriage prohibitions were officially removed from every state. Even as a teen around 2000, I had conversations with Southern Christians who had strong convictions that the Bible was against interracial marriage. Even Bob Jones University had a ban on interracial dating until G.W. Bush gave a speech there and they got flack for it.  So, with that in mind, would the same people include clerks who have strong personal beliefs that interracial marriage is wrong when it comes to doing a job against your beliefs? I think in that scenario, defenders would be more likely to take a pragmatic view and say the clerk should just hand out the license and let God sort it out."
gaybros,3cpunt,SlateHardjaw,5,Fri Jul 10 00:33:49 2015 UTC,"Glad Gov Beshear is doing the right thing. These county clerks are not doing their jobs and should be FIRED immediately if they don't start doing them. There's no middle ground here - the state and the Supreme Court are ordering this to happen, and you're defying them. If you said to your boss ""I'm religiously opposed to this thing here"" that has already been decided in a court of law, your boss could and should fire you on the spot."
gaybros,3cpunt,plz_pm_me_ur_dickpix,3,Fri Jul 10 03:39:02 2015 UTC,"should be FIRED immediately if they don't start doing them   No. I completely disagree. They should have been fired the second that they said no. It is not their business to say no. They have no right to say no. Yes, you can refuse work based upon religious reasons in certain cases. This isn't one of them. This is like an orthodox jew going into a butcher, asking for a job, and then refusing to do any work because there is pork around. Well, yes. That's sort of your goddamned job. So either drop the job, or FUCKING DO IT. If you don't do it, and don't drop it, then there are pink slips easily filled out.

And you could possibly consider one for you too, because it sounds like you might could use some guidance or a safe third party sounding board on your side, no matter how well adjusted you are.  Your folks have a journey in front of them, should they choose to take it.  Hopefully they will take that bumpy and frightening journey and exit at the station marked ""full acceptance"".  But it won't be easy for them and they need help.  It's critical they get quality help from someone like PFLAG or endorsed by PFLAG and not some backwards hateful fundie freak.

Such evidence actually tends to have the opposite effect, resulting in such people doubling down on their own belief to the contrary (we often see this with anti-vaxxers). The more you attempt to show someone that a closely held personal belief is objectively incorrect, the more they will resist, because no one likes to admit to having been wrong all along.  It is not your job to change their minds. If they are going to come around, it will be on their own terms and in their own time - anything you do to try and actively facilitate the process is more likely to be seen as pushing an agenda at this early point in the process, and runs a high chance of being resisted."

I was about 11 or 12 and knew all about jerking off, which I shamefully did to straight pairings in fanfiction just because it never occurred to me to look for ones involving two guys. Figured I'd take advantage of my mom and stepdad being away for the weekend by taking my time with browsing the fics for once. And then it found me.   I started reading one involving Goten and Trunks, thinking it would be weird if it got sexual (Like really, all guys can do is blow each other. It couldn't get too weird, right?), but I was interested enough to see where it went. I just remember it getting sexual, they blow each other a bit, at which point I expected it to be over, but then there was some vague sentence about Trunks inserting himself into Goten. For the life of me, I could not figure out exactly how one's penis opened up wide enough to take in the other guy's penis. I've never been confused to that degree again in my life thankfully. Long story short, I then did some more research on exactly what gay sex entailed. And that, kids, is the story of how I came for the first time."

This church group from the local college came in and were performing songs and dance to the music of the backstreet boys and 98°.  One of the skits was about using condoms, just in case praying didn't work.   My friend was sitting in the isle seat because she was a quite overweight and the armrests were bigger. During the condom skit, the actors tell us that gay men especially need to use condoms.  I turn around to my friend and ask her why the hell would gay men need them, they just make their pee-pees kiss!   She whispers softly in my ear: ""Really, you don't know? One dude sticks his dick up the ass of the other dude."" My reaction said it all. She laughed so hard she had an asthma attack and they had to stop the assembly and take her outside. For the rest of the day I had to come to terms with the fact that my Ned Flanders look-alike shop teacher's and my pee-pee would never kiss."

gaybros,3cod3o,JamesTor,16,Thu Jul 9 22:25:06 2015 UTC,"Before I even knew what ""gay"" or ""homosexual"" meant. I tried to have gay sex when I was like 9 years old with my male friend of the same age. First we found porn stash of his parents and got exited, then we did some frotting with our clothes on (I don't know what it's called, when you rub your bodies while clothes on) and ""only pretended"" we are a couple having sex, and we moaned like people in porn films scream and recorded it and I enjoyed the ""pretended sex"" in a way which was new for me. Then we thought we should try sex and my friend took his pants off and went laying his butt up and I tried sticking my limp kid-dick in his butt, but it didn't work and I said it was his fault.  I never really thought it as attempted gay sex, I just enjoyed the idea and trying it. Only years later did I learn that gay sex is a thing but I didn't connect the dots on what I liked sexually and what homosexuality is until I was like 14 years old. Then I started realizing my desires pretty much mean I'm gay. This was in the latter part of the 90's when also internet became more widespread and porn with it.  EDIT: I also like to think this as an example how even children already start showing sexual interest innately without previous knowledge about sexual orientations. I never had any interest like above towards girls. Even when secretly watching playboy softcore porn at late nights in TV I always was drawn to the men, and at that time I thought that that's the point of straight porn, that men like straight porn because they can see other men having sex (with women) and empathize with the men. Without previous knowledge about homosexuality, I didn't realize my approach to straight softcore porn wasn't empathizing but attraction towards the men."

At an age of 10 I had a feeling that I was gay (and through my education, I was okay with it), strongly believed in parcifism, knew that we all should eat less meat and had knowledge about how to avoid getting hemorrhoids.

Of course I didn't mention which books I had already picked out...  I ordered The Joy of Gay Sex (Volume II!), two books on erotic massage, a book about a prostitute living in New York, and a book of American Folklore (I wasn't a complete perv...just mostly.)  I learned about all kinds of things, like bdsm, watersports, how to have anal sex, cruising, public sex...the pictures were so hot, I jacked off to them so many times before my mom discovered exactly what books I had ordered.

So I'm guessing my optimal solution would be us being cuddle buddies. (of course, in this sort of arrangement, all cuddling/fucking stops when I find that certain other special person).

Most of the studies I'm finding (http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~delamate/pdfs/JAH308342.pdf) suggest that after the body starts to go, you're right. There's a fair bit of research in the UK on geriatric sex - it looks like 70 seems to be the big cut off - it drops from high 50s to mid 30s in terms of sexually active elders (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/behindtheheadlines/news/2015-01-29-a-third-of-over-70s-report-frequent-sexual-activity/ and http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/28/older-sexual-activity-ageing-survey-manchester)   I admit I can't find the works I'm looking for on the frequency of sex in younger ages, but generally speaking, most of the sex you will have in your life happens from 40-60. 15-25 is relatively infrequent (with some exceptions in the college years). Generally this is explained/associated with concerns over sex, sexuality, and relationships. There are obviously exceptions, but most people will have the bulk of their sexual partners and experiences after 30. I'll spend more time looking when I'm not at work (cause I already have awkward enough search results to be looking for teenage sex statistics...)"

Most people are more sexual than me, which puts me in the awkward position of caring about them very much, but not necessarily wanting to have sex.  Its very difficult when the other person starts thinking that its just them you aren't attracted to as opposed to not being very sexual.  I say I'm pansexual and lean towards men.

gaybros,3cnzhw,ThatSBKid,8,Thu Jul 9 13:31:52 2015 UTC,"I am first off curious to why you are asking.

I do not need sexual release for myself, i can do that no problem. but one thing i love is being able to help my partner release, it's a mental thing where i feel like i have helped my partner out some way no one else should be able to..  I think i would understand and TRY.. but it would be really hard.. i guess I would expect a compromise... because it would be unfair for said person to expect me to give up all sex. they would have to give in one in a  while."

Think of it like fried chicken and steak are your favorite foods, then you start dating someone who's a vegan. You love them and everything else is right; but now you can't eat meat of any kind even though that's your favorite food. No, it's not going to kill you and you can live without it; but it's something that you really really enjoy and are probably going to miss for the rest of your life.

gaybros,3cnzhw,theconor55,4,Thu Jul 16 23:39:40 2015 UTC,"I actually had to come up with an answer to this relatively recently. I ended things with my significant other of five years a year and a half ago partly because he wasn't interested in sex with me anymore. I realized that while sex wasn't terribly important to him for whatever reason, it was incredibly important to me. That sort of disconnect created a dead bedroom situation that made all the otherwise excellent aspects of our relationship dim. We loved each other dearly, but it was the right choice to end things."
gaybros,3cnzhw,jinkazetsukai,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:20:27 2015 UTC,Did he ever explain why?

gaybros,3cnzhw,Krevgin87,6,Thu Jul 9 21:54:22 2015 UTC,"Define ""sex"".  My last relationship (it was with a girl) wasn't very sexual.  We dated for about a year, but never had oral sex or intercourse.  (Long story, short: her biological father had an inappropriate relationship with her when she was very young, and--despite it being 15 years later, she still had emotional issues to work through, especially when it came to sex.)  That's not to say we didn't have intimate times, though.  We made out, took showers together, cuddled in bed naked, and even engaged in what I would term mutual masturbation.  (TMI?)  I had hoped that over time I could help her overcome these issues so we could have a fulfilling sex life.  (Alas, we got into different grad schools and broke up last year instead of trying the long distance thing.) I have no regrets about that relationship, other than it ending.  It was very fulfilling (not completely fulfilling, for wont of a better sex life, but fulfilling nonetheless)."
gaybros,3cnzhw,jplivecmh,2,Thu Jul 9 12:30:52 2015 UTC,Would you be able to do that longterm?
gaybros,3cnzhw,jplivecmh,12,Thu Jul 9 13:34:07 2015 UTC,"A year isn't long-term?  But, yes, I could (and would).  I was in the relationship because I cared about her and because I loved spending time with her, and--really--just enjoyed the fact that she was in my life.  Sex, for me, is an enjoyable benefit of a relationship, but its not the point of the relationship.    What about you? What's your answer?"
gaybros,3cnzhw,AvatarJack,6,Thu Jul 9 14:06:55 2015 UTC,A year is short :)  I could. I'm mostly asexual. Kisses and cuddles are enough for me.
gaybros,3cnzhw,heimaey,6,Thu Jul 9 14:15:12 2015 UTC,"That's what I figured.    I also figured that you might be in a relationship where the other person is wanting more, but you're not able to deliver, and they might be asking to open up the relationship to find sexual release elsewhere.    If that's the case, I wouldn't bother with what other people are saying/thinking.  You've got to do what you think is right for you."
gaybros,3cnzhw,heimaey,3,Thu Jul 9 14:29:03 2015 UTC,Would you caution against opening up the relationship?
gaybros,3cnzhw,Spartanza,8,Thu Jul 9 14:46:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you and I are different people.  I don't even know you as a friend.  I have no idea how opening up a relationship would impact your mental and emotional psyche.    If you're going on an internet forum and asking for advice, I would interpret that as--at the minimum--some trepidation on your part.  However, you are also contemplating the idea, which means that you're willing to make the sacrifice, if you think it will work out in the end for you (i.e. your partner gets the sex he wants, but you still get everything else).  As I said, no one can make that decision for you.  But if I had to make that decision for myself?  I'm a monogamous guy.  If I were in your partner's shoes, and I truly loved you, I would make the sacrifice (to have little or no sex) to spare you from having to make the sacrifice (of having to open the relationship). (I've been masturbating since 12; it gets the job done.)  If I were in your position, I would ask him to remain faithful, but I would also try to be a better lover.  If not for my sake, then for his."

gaybros,3cnzhw,mathemagicat,3,Thu Jul 9 19:25:13 2015 UTC,"Sex isnt just about physical release. It strengthens and maintains the bond with your partner. Although such relationships are possible it will never be as strong as it would be if sex was at least an occasional event.....this is hugely dependant on the individuals involved but i think my minimum would need to be monthly. Why is there no sex? physical ailment, depression, no genitals/non standard? or just zero libido?"

gaybros,3cnzhw,randomblue86,2,Thu Jul 9 17:28:52 2015 UTC,"The timing of this question seems accidentally appropriate - my view on this subject matter has changed drastically in the past few weeks. Sorry for the long post.  Had you asked me 6 months ago, my answer would have been an unequivocal yes. I would still want TONS of affection and contact (cuddling, kissing, hugging, etc), but I would have responded I could go without sex. I was in a wonderful 5 year relationship with a man I intended to spend the rest of my life with (proposed almost 3 years ago), and largely due to my own mental inhibitions, sex was fairly minimal. About a month and a half ago, I realized through discussions that he truly did need more from me sexually to be happy, and finally started working adamantly on getting over my inhibitions. Long story short, he ended our engagement around a month ago – while I know there was way more to his decision than just sex, I didn’t have enough time to really make an effective change in that arena.  Over the past 6 weeks, I’ve done a shitload of introspection, and have realized that sex is important to me. I still view sex the same as I did before - it's a benefit that comes with a relationship, not the defining aspect, and not something I will seek outside of a relationship. I’ve realized that while I’m well equipped to be a top, a large part of me also desires the experiences of a bottom; something that’s hard to fulfill when you’re with a self-professed ‘power bottom’ and something I think that also diminished my overall desire for sex. I’ve opened up to my kinks, and while I’ve still got a long way to go, have made a strong dent in my inhibitions.  Now, I wouldn’t give a yes or a no answer to your question – I’ve realized that it’s way too fuzzy. “Sex” is a large embodiment of intimacy that covers many avenues and styles. It’s also very dependent on who the significant other is – what sex looks like in each relationship may vary greatly, with equal levels of happiness possible.  This is a long response to a seemingly simple question, but part of the reason I want to share is to point out that people can change and something like sex is way more complex than a yes or no. Change can include you as well – I used to think I just wasn’t that into sex, but I wasn’t being honest with myself – I thought I wasn’t into sex because I wasn’t getting what I really wanted from my partner (which was my own fault). Your question feels like you may be in a relationship right now, and worried about having a mismatched sexual drive with your partner. If this is the case - I urge you to have an honest and thorough discussion with him sooner than later (or multiple for that matter). When I say honesty, I’m including you being honest with yourself – if you’re not sure what you really want, take the time to at least try and figure that out sooner than later – and let your SO know and see if he’s okay with experimentation as you try to figure it out. You may truly be someone who is completely okay with cuddling and stopping there – there’s nothing wrong with that and you deserve to be as happy as anyone else and in a wonderful and loving relationship. But unless you’re honest with yourself and your partner, it’s likely to cause problems one way or another.  I waited too long and let my inhibitions sit unattended, and lost the most important person to me because of it. I’m not saying that knowing what I know now and acting on that sooner would have saved the relationship, but it certainly wouldn’t have hurt. I can also say from experience it’s easier to separate after a single year than five, so if this is related to a relationship, working through it sooner will either lead to a more meaningful relationship, or it may just save some heartache by ending it sooner than it would have otherwise.  TL;DR – It depends on how you define sex, and who you and your partner are. Being honest about it with each other and yourself is critical if you’re looking for a lasting relationship."
gaybros,3cnzhw,Full777Metal,2,Thu Jul 9 18:42:22 2015 UTC,Do you think that more sex alone would have changed everything?
gaybros,3cnzhw,Mkidkap,2,Thu Jul 9 22:16:40 2015 UTC,"No, absolutely not. I know that sex was part of his decision to part ways, but I think it would have only prolonged things - I think there are things that he needs to figure out still that aren't sexually related which he needs to be single to figure out successfully. If it was strictly sexual, I have trouble believing that it would have lasted 5 years in the first place.  Even so - I still regret not working on myself sooner. I've never been a bottom, and would loved to have had that experience with him. I've never tried puppy play, and would loved to have had that experience with him. There are more of course, and all of these are in retrospect now. He was someone I could trust, someone I genuinely loved as hard as my heart is capable (still do to be fair). Being able to have these experiences with him would have been amazing, and is really the only thing I regret about the relationship.  I also wanted to comment on some of the other responses herein, but didn't want to get into an internet argument since there's hardly adequate and solid data to prove either way - I think it's fairly safe here. There are a few posts that are very binary, suggesting that if you don't want sex you're emotionally damaged and need to 'fix' that before dating or getting involved - end of story. Personally I think that reducing the human psyche down to something that simple is extremely naive. Our mental processes and our hormonal processes are extremely complex, and to imply that lack of sexual appetite is exclusively representative of mental (emotional) damage seems incongruent with the complexity of the systems and a very medieval perspective. I can't say it's never true, in my case it applies at some level, but to state that it applies in all cases seems wrong. I do think that truly asexual people exist, and that a number of them are likely pushing themselves to be sexual to appear 'normal'. Additionally, I reject the notion that you need to 'fix' yourself before dating. As long as you're open and honest with your partner, I see no reason why a couple couldn't work together to work through issues like this."
gaybros,3cnzhw,Werepup,2,Thu Jul 9 23:40:54 2015 UTC,"I actually have been in this situation, though I provide evidence that it is possible I am here to tell you that it should be avoided. It was pretty damaging. While I knew that we loved one another the 6 months I spent without sex (due to a combination of depression and OCD medication) had done its work. My libido was shot, I had a very hard time believing that anyone was actually attracted to me, and I entered a depression all my own.       I am not suggesting that this will be the case for everyone in this situation. Though if you aren't already head over heels with someone try and find them help as ""just friends"".   ***The ex in question now functions fine, he spent a while with his doctors working on different combinations while we were together and right at the end things seemed to be coming around."

gaybros,3cnzhw,thebokobear,2,Thu Jul 9 23:28:46 2015 UTC,"Sex is extremely important to me. It's a major part of my connection with my partner. I would never start a relationship with someone who was asexual or unable to have sex.  If my partner decided he didn't want to have sex with me any more, I would consider that to mean he was dumping me.  If he became unable to have/enjoy sex as a result of a medical condition or as a side effect of medication, I would stay with him, but I would feel a profound sense of loss and grief."

No.  I'm really quite good at keeping myself physically satisfied. Sex for me is about sharing pleasure with my partner. If he didn't want me, I'd rather go take care of myself than get some sort of perfunctory handjob. And if he never wanted me...that wouldn't be the kind of relationship I'd want to be in."
gaybros,3cnzhw,indigolalafell,2,Thu Jul 9 22:29:21 2015 UTC,"At this point in my life, I would have to say ""no.""  Not just because ""hurr durr, sex feel good, do want,"" but because I'm also fairly insecure.  If I was with someone who seemed to care for me but didn't really want anything physical, I'd interpret that (either correctly or incorrectly) as something was ""wrong"" with me.  Say what you will, but there's something that makes you feel so good about being ""wanted"" by someone.  Okay, people, gather round for story time.  I recently got out of a long-term relationship.  It was, like most relationships, very hot and heavy in the beginning.  As time wore on (we were together for eight years) things cooled down to the point where it was almost non-existent.  Full-on penetrative sex was rare, generally happening on birthdays or Valentines' Day.  We'd make the effort to fool around, but there would be long stretches of nothing.  After a very painful break-up and a lot of time by myself with the worm hole of porn the Internet is, my libido has become pretty reawakened.  I want sex.  I don't begrudge anyone who feels differently, but I'd need someone who is going to return the physicality."

gaybros,3cpw3v,SlateHardjaw,4,Tue Jul 21 04:48:49 2015 UTC,"Friendships usually take repetition of positive time with people and consistency to develop. Along with that, shared trial and achievement tends to bond people as well.  This kind of stuff happens easier in school and college life since we're forced to be around people longer than our first impression of them. A lot of the people we become good friends with were people in the group that we didn't really notice or get to know that well at first. However, over time, we had small conversations where we found out we shared interests, laughed at something funny we both realized about the situation, and gravitated to each other over lots of situations that allowed us to start to band with the people we got along with better. Eventually, there's an all-nighter, or a time where our car breaks down together, or a road trip to a concert, something else like that where we bond more and accelerate those loyal feelings for each other.  So, with that in mind, your starting point is finding a place or situation where you can consistently be around people enough for those friendships to develop. This is why a lot of people recommend sport leagues, gym classes or hiking groups. Volunteering can be good too. You'll have to do some investigation to find opportunities like that that overlap with the kind of people who share some similar interests. It doesn't have to be your favorite hobby, just something where people will align in temper or values.  You might have to try a lot of things, but the big mistake most people make is being turned off too quickly if they feel like they don't fit in with a group. If a group is established, you just have to keep showing up, being positive, and getting to know people for a while. Eventually, they'll see you as one of the people that's always there and is now part of them. It just doesn't happen overnight. If you can find a group activity where everyone is new at once, that's a bit easier to bond quickly. However, you get more drop outs in that situation and the crew might not be as consistent. It's just a trade off."

I have a similar but slightly, slightly different problem.  I have many friends who are gay - none of whom are over 25.  This doesn't sound like a big deal except that I'm 35.  I've met most of these guys in Uni, as I'm a PhD student.  I'm in a weird space where I'm sort of still living the life of an undergrad (PhD only effects your academic life - otherwise, I'm still poor as ass, living with roommates, and living the student lifestyle).  I have lots of friends - enough that I can pick and choose among them - but I've somehow not at all been able to find any peers.  I'm sure the OP can find plenty of gay friends beyond his own demographic, but it sounds like you're struggling to find a peer, much like me.  Not just any gay man, but a gay man who's ok with having gay friends without trying to date or screw them, who's more or less the same age with similar interests and and analogous life experiences.  This, I have no idea how to achieve.  All I can say is that making gay friends is easy, so long as you don't care how much you actually have in common.  This is no way to make gay friends who fully empathize with you, however."

I have an older brother and we get a long but never talk about manly things. I am also not out. I know how that sounds. I'm old. I get it. I made an attempt at 25 but was crushed, scared, and retreated because at the moment I was going to reveal how I felt to my mother, she went of on a tirade about Christianity and how being gay is sinful and shameful. Yeah, my family is really religious. Truthfully, I don't even know if I am 100% gay. I've had no real relationships....  But anyways, I did get very close to another male co-worker a few years back, like exchanged numbers and all that, and would frequently go out to lunch at work. I actually made friends with him because I thought he was gay. I judged. But he had a girlfriend. We surprisingly had a lot of interests in common and we got along. I was so sad to see him go when he moved. I could never really open up to him because I was scared he would freak out, and I regret that for a while because we just clicked as human beings... But other than that, we haven't spoken in over year.  At my current job, there are a couple of guys around my age. One I see regularly and he's a nice enough guy, but we don't really get on like compadres the way he does with other guys at work.  So yeah, I have no idea how to make guy friends. Also, I feel as if I'm a bit of misanthropic as a guy. Sometimes, other guys just irk me. I can't explain it. I can get along with guys older than me, but just not my own age. It freaks me out because I think they only thing they want to talk about is women or guy stuff, which I do neither of...   I do have a lot of female friends though. I love them. They are the best. I'm not effeminate, or at least try not to be. I don't judge people who are, but at 27 I honestly just act like a dude. I don't really give a fuck what anyone else thinks anymore..   Wait where am I again... Right. I just don't have any guy friends, but I've always wanted a guy best friend... Besides family members of course.  Forgot to add one more thing - was invited to do an activity with guys (and girls) but freaked out and didn't go because of anxiety. Maybe I can make guy friends, but I just can't will myself to..."

Some do, but most don't.. from what I've seen at least. Make yourself available and that opportunity to 'be there' for them will eventually arise when they wanna talk about stuff.  In any case, having some stuff in common helps. As weird as this sounds, if you find someone you want to be your friend, you gotta take active steps towards it. Like saying hi everyday to them at work. I mean after a week or so you'll probably say ""oh by the way my name is _______"". Conversations usually carry on itself to pass time, but you have to be willing to talk. This is kind of assuming you see them kind of regularly at work or something - which would then be 'something in common.'  I made one of my friends (straight, and who I thought was homophobic) like that 6 years ago, and I recently came out to him because I needed to know if he was cool with it...and he was actually really happy about it because he said that it meant I wouldn't be scared to find someone to make me happy (I never dated anyone yet.)"

On the way back, when it was just us two, I said  ""So, I don't want to steal your 'coming out' thunder, but I'm... kind of... mumble mumble too.""  She looked at me for a moment and then it clicked and she said, ""no, that's cool!"" Then we had a discussion on the topic in general.

Later that night I called and told my mom. Her response was very muted, for lack of a better term, so I called my wife who told me she had talked to my mother who said that ""it was just a phase"" and that ""I was only saying that I was gay to push her away"". When I heard that I got pissed off and didn't tell anyone else, and didn't talk to my mom for two weeks. A week after that conversation I told the rest of my family and had planned to not talk to my mom until she apologized.

Over the last 48 hours I had probably collectively gotten six hours of sleep because I was studying for finals. All my classes were finally over and I was chilling on the couch watching some boob tube just unwinding after several hard tests.  Well in come my parents. They see me sitting there in my lazy, liquified, semi-vegetative state and they ask if I want to go to youth group. Now I had been pulling away from the church just because I didn't like the practices anymore and didn't really care to worship a God of any kind. I had been using my studies as a fake time hog so I would have an excuse to miss youth group. Combined with the fact that I have the movability of a rusted Tin Man, I say ""no thanks""   Well my parents have been noticing I've been distancing myself from the church and decide that this is the most logical of times to start a discussion with me about why I'm doing so. Sentences such as ""Where's my little boy who loved Jesus?"" and things of the like were being said.  Being sleep-deprived and a recovering stress junkie, the conversation was driving me up the wall. Now, I honestly wish I hadn't of done this. I wish I could take it back and do this a lot less matter-of-fact and in a nicer way, but c'est la vie...  I say ""You know why I'm leaving the church? It's because I'm gay. And I want to get rid of them before they get rid of me.""  Silenced.   If a voice could give whiplash my mom's neck would be spasming for months.  So this spawns a whole NEW topic which includes ""Where's my little boy who loved girls?"" and her listing off every single one of my playground crushes. But again, way too tired to even care. After an unchanging expression and monosyllabic vocabulary on my part my parents realize that I am slowly imploding due to my own lack of rest and I should not be having this conversation now. I was told that we would be continue it later.  My body rejoices. FINALLY. I CAN GO TO BED. So I hop into my bed and sleep from 7:00PM to 12:00AM  And that, kids, is how I slept for seventeen straight hours.  TL:DR I was tired, parents wouldn't shut up, I shut them up REAL good."

I came out to my friends over the past year and then to my parents about 2 weeks ago. My friends couldn't have cared less, but my family flipped out. They went through every negative emotion you can think of. They said I would get AIDS. They said I would be lonely forever. They said I would go to hell. They said it was a phase and that I was just confused. My personal favorite was when my mom told me I was going to drop out of med school and use my loan money to move to Portland to become a prostitute. Ok mom.   Eventually they realized that I'm not going to change. So their current operation is to convince me to live a single, celibate life in line with the church teachings (my family is uber Catholic). I said I couldn't do that and would not stop talking to my bf of 1 month. So, they told me not to come back for dinner one night after work and that my dad would collect my things for me and that I could pick them up late at night out of the trunk of his car. So since Monday I've been living with my incredible bf until I can move into my apartment for school.   So clearly the story is not completely over, so I don't have advice for people on how to deal with a difficult coming out. It's been a terrible whirlwind of emotions and had only made my depression worse. I'm going to start talking to a therapist soon, but for right now I think the distance from my family is actually helping me be at peace with everything.   Overall, I'm very happy I can be honest with myself and those around me. I started to feel like I didn't have any real relationships because they were all built on the lie that I was straight. The person my friends knew was not the person I actually was. That disconnect between who I was pretending to be and my true self was why I decided it was time to come out of the closet, come hell or high water."
gaybros,3cp84r,LionLuke,2,Fri Jul 10 16:19:01 2015 UTC,"I was raised in a relatively conservative family and intolerant town. It took me quite a long time for me to accept that I was gay as well.   When I was 17 and just out of high school I decided I was going to tell my mom (my dad had just passed away), and I finally worked up the courage to do so. We were spending some time with my Aunt and the topic of me not / never having a girlfriend came up... I just said I hadn't really worried about it and my mom mentioned that my brother thought I was gay, which I just kind of brushed under the rug. I'll never forget what she said next...  My Aunt: Well, I wouldn't care if you were gay or not!  Me: Hah, well, thanks.   My mom: Heh, yeah, but please don't be gay...  That comment alone sent me back into the closet for 5 years. After I left my hometown and was in a more tolerant area I was more confident about it and started coming out to my friends (over the course of a year or so)... After I had come out to nearly everyone outside of family I was out to dinner with my mom and she asked if something was wrong and I just blurted it out. I couldn't keep myself from doing it any longer.  She seemed surprised and we had a kind of uncomfortable conversation about it (in which she said she wasn't comfortable with same-sex couples raising children... Thanks, mom). She still seems a bit uncomfortable with it, but that's her problem to deal with."

I was reallly drunk so i thought fuck it, i'm doing it.   I pulled that girl on the side and told her i wanted to tell her something, being scared of the reaction i just started to cry and i couldn't speak at all. So i typed "" i'm gay "" on my phone and showed her. I started to cry even more and she told me it's no big deal and hugged me, then she told me about one of her cousins who is bisexual and that it's no big deal, i guess she did it to comfort me. We talked for 5min and then we went back to other 2 friends.  I was still crying a bit and other 2 friends were worried about it, so i told them too, this time i was able to speak :p. I was expecting them to stop hanging out with me or be uncomfortable around me, but they just looked at each other for a second and told me it's no big deal. I calmed down and we went back to drinking.  Few minutes later i was even more drunk, and i just wanted to come out to the whole world. I texted my mom that i'm gay, she called me right away telling me that she loves me and that she's proud of me and stuff.   Went back to drinking and chilling with my friends, then we went home. When i got home my mom was waiting for me just to make sure i'm fine and all. We talked some more and she went to sleep. Being overwhelmed with acceptance and adrenaline i decided to come out to my sister, i passed her on the hallway and i just said i'm gay, she said okay, like if i'd tell her i bought new shoes. I stayed up for few hours crying from happiness and weight lifted off my shoulders.  From then on, i slowly came out to more friends whenever topic about relationships came up, now 10 people now and they all accepted it great. I'm lucky for that.

I broke up with her and made some excuse as to why.  A couple months later I told her and our other really close friend that studied abroad with us. I called one of them up and drove over and told them that I had to say something and to sit there and shut up until I'm finished. I was really intense and emotional.

The big tech overlord company is named Google Evil Corp so there's no question of where this show is going. The main character doesn't just bitch about the world–he copes with his perception and knows he has a problem with his personal relationships on top of some glaring social anxiety. The overlay of New York's ever growing skyline adds to how towering the rich are in a city drawing in post-grads crushed with debt and making it all the harder to get a footing in society's pace. The show isn't trying to preach at the audience, it's visually representing a problem that's relatable to the generation who will be streaming it on Netflix before the year is out. Clearly most aspects of the fundamental premise of Mr. Robot were solidly laid out well before production began, and it's paying off in the first few episodes.   The cinematography is just fantastic, and the stylisation decisions add soul to an otherwise fuck-up-prone genre. I always look forward to the bold title sequence with each new episode. Highly recommend this series for the visual choices and engrossing plot potential.

gaybros,3cn7wz,BillyIsUnstuck,12,Thu Jul 9 11:37:43 2015 UTC,"Trust me, it's just as bad in Canada but in a different way. America's a ""melting pot"" and a ""republic"" whereas Canada is a Multiculture. There's a huge difference. Melting-Pot cultures encourage everyone to be proud to be American first, whether you're black, hindu, gay, whatever. Canada has a mosaic approach where they believe your identity and culture should be respected and that ""Canada"" is made up of all the cultures etc. that reside together in the same place. This creates a lot of its own problems, especially in the 21st century as sex education, gay rights etc. have all been reaching their zenith. While things like Islamaphobia exist in the U.S, in Canada there is a very real fear among many ""Canadians"" (secular, middle class) that they are being erased because the way a multi culture exists is that people can sue for their religious freedom for certain things. This means girls in Sharia households suing their way out of gym and music classes and all manner of religious zealots stopping the inclusion of homosexuality in public schools. The friends I have who concern me are the ones out there fighting against racism, and islamaphobia and sexism etc. but in doing so, they see gay rights now as just a victory for gentrified, cisgendered white men and it irks them because they take a victory for that group as a spit in the face. A gentle reminder than white men will always flourish while everyone else doesn't. My personal favorite was a friend of mine shared a meme which said ""While you were celebrating gay marriage in America, Palestinians still can't marry Jews. Fact. Hashtag, end Apartheid"" or something. Uh,talk about a red herring? that completely ignores or glosses over the fact that not only can Jews and Palestinians not get married, heterosexual or otherwise, but that being gay in Palestine may often be a fate worse than death. It bothers me because people will share pictures of the white house lit up like a rainbow christmas tree and my activist friends who hate that the spotlight has been taken off Ferguson and the BlackLivesMatter campaign will share the picture with something like ""Fucking Pinkwashing. Don't forget (inserthashtag)"". ughhh"

I don't see any evidence for this so-called friend who's projecting their issues? In OP's post, they basically sought out people's profiles to read their status updates, and then was upset that some of those people thought that marriage equality passing did not mean other forms of inequality no longer existed.  So, fuck, man, what is OP bitching about really? They don't want people to acknowledge other inequalities in their own spaces so that even if he goes looking for it, he won't find it? Fucked.  No one's asking you to feel empathy for every struggle at every moment of the day, but an acknowledgement that other struggles exist and are allowed to take up room in the world costs little.  I don't totally understand your hypotheticals about my coming out, but I was referencing that to say that if I thought comfort was so important, I wouldn't have risked causing my parents discomfort by coming out to them. I'm sure they would have preferred if I didn't ""project"" my issues onto them.  All that to say, I think marriage equality is awesome, I'm incredibly happy about the culmination of the hard work and sacrifice the LGBT community put behind it, but I also acknowledge that marriage equality being the preeminent ""issue"" meant that a ton of dire issues surrounding LGBT people of color, and trans people in particular, were backburner-ed. I celebrate marriage equality while being equally fucking pissed off about black churches burning, Charleston, etc. What's the big deal.

There are billions of people in this world and saying that everyone can only be activists for the absolute worst kind of oppression in the world is stupid.  People have a hard time recognizing their privileges in general, especially when they're a minority in some way.  I know that being gay makes my life a little more difficult than being straight.  I also recognize that being a man makes my life easier than being a woman.  Those two things exist at the same time, and a privilege isn't something that cancels out oppression, and vice versa.  In the end it IS possible to care about both causes at the same time.  In regards to your fb friends, they might not have been as affected by it as we have, so maybe they felt kinda left out in the celebration."

That's my problem - I always feel as though many people treat me as if it does. Being a white, ""cisgendered"" man certainly starts me off in a pretty good spot, but that's not my whole story. I've grown to resent that oppression against me, as a homo or even as someone who grew up very poor should mean less, or that energy spent in advocacy for my rights is a distraction, or a waste, or ""pinkwashing""."
gaybros,3cn7wz,mfact50,13,Thu Jul 9 17:25:23 2015 UTC,"Well, to their credit, there are situations where some gay men do use their oppression to excuse themselves from facing or discussing other forms of oppression that doesn't necessarily affect them, like racism in the gay community or, which makes even less sense to me, throwing trans people under the bus.  You shouldn't feel bad about celebrating 6/26 but at the same time don't be so quick to dismiss concerns about other causes because ""they kill the mood"" or whatever.

So I certainly live my life this way and intuitively agree but is there a logical reason we shouldn't be working towards the highest level of global utility? More of a philosophical question, but it is hard to argue that we shouldn't find the biggest injustice/harm that we can find/ impact and dedicate all our energy to that cause. Some issues are naturally more salient (such as those that touch our lives) but technically maybe we should try to find the absolute worst harms that we can find.   The other utility question that bugs at me is if any leisure expenditures are immoral. I think a case could be made for not driving myself destitute for those less fortunate (I need to not drive myself mad for one) but certainly there is a bunch of money/time I spend that could be saving live.

gaybros,3cn7wz,bmoreSpiff,10,Fri Jul 10 12:29:11 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm glad this is being brought up.  I'm a gay black guy and my sister converted to Islam a few years ago and I brought this very same conversation to her this past weekend, because I wanted to hear her take on it as another double-minority.  Last year, when the Michael Brown shooting first occurred, the hot shit on my Facebook feed was The Ice Bucket Challenge. Now, I noticed that pretty much all my white friends did not make a single remark about what happened, while all my black friends were following the event very closely. Once the IBC started to die down, attention turned to Robin Williams, still nothing about Ferguson. Suddenly, once Wilson got acquitted and the riots broke out, suddenly, all my white friends had an opinion on how they should be acting, how if they only followed the law they'd have nothing to be afraid of. These people knew nothing about what happened, nothing about the shooting, the historical significance of the decision to not indict, nothing about the trend of mistreatment of black people in that town, they didn't know shit. But they sure suddenly had an opinion about some chips spilled on the floor because a convenience store got broken into. Then, the decision came to not indict the officers involved with the murder of [correction: Eric Gardner], another case my black friends had been following closely. More protests, suddenly, more opinions from my white friends.  Now, the tables have turned. Marriage equality for me. Great support from a lot of my friends of both races, a few posts about exactly what you mentioned, suddenly some black people having an opinion about marriage equality and how we should be concerned about the trend of black churches being burned. Um... Aren't there black LGBT people too? Are we invisible? Have we not too been fighting for equal rights in more facets of our lives than either side? I was very frustrated at those trying to #alllivesmatter marriage equality. How hypocritical!  Quite frankly, I feel isolated, like there isn't any place I can completely be understood except with other gay black guys. That's fucking crazy.  It's also insulting to insinuate that any person can only be focused on giving attention to one thing at a time. I can be sad about Robin Williams and still follow the news about other topics. I can be happy about the President's speech after the SCOTUS ruling and feel an equal measure of emotion during his eulogy for those lost in the Charleston shooting the very same day.   At the end of the day, I pity these people that are so one-track minded. In today's world we have the ability to know something about everything. Why anyone would want to limit what they focus on when everything is related is beyond me. Especially when it comes to equal treatment and mistreatment for and of minorities.   You are not alone, OP."

gaybros,3cn7wz,blue_surfboard,2,Thu Jul 9 14:55:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your feedback, I really enjoyed reading that and I think you echoed a lot of what some of the people I've associated with were on about - with the black churches burning and all anyone cares about is Rachel Dolezal and Micheal Brown being killed around the same time Robin Williams dies. However I think that you should take into consideration that talking about race is very difficult for a lot of people to do these days. I see some of my cousins take that whole stand about ""if people can say they're proud to be black, why can't I say I'm proud to be white?"" and I run so fucking fast in the other direction. I don't want to be associated with that sort of person. I think there's a lot of white people who sort of just zip their lips when those sorts of discussions happen, and unfortunately it looks as if all white people are like that. I get uncomfortable talking about race with white people or black people because I've been trained for so long throughout university that as a white person, my views and opinions on race don't matter or are inherently flawed. It's a hard line to walk, because I see some people who are ""activists"" in communities they're not a apart of by default - like straightbros in the gay community and white people in black advocacy (i.e. ""allies"") and they are never really treated with the full modicum of respect that people who are the ""Same"" as them do. Does that make sense?"
gaybros,3cn7wz,manjimmyo,2,Thu Jul 9 15:18:33 2015 UTC,"However I think that you should take into consideration that talking about race is very difficult for a lot of people to do these days.   It wasn't very difficult to run to defend the police officers and somehow turn the people who died into the perpetrators.   And although I'm aware you mean in a general sense, it's difficult to talk about it because no one talks about it. Repetition breeds familiarity. Ignoring the big elephant does not make it go away.   I've been trained for so long throughout university that as a white person, my views and opinions on race don't matter or are inherently flawed.   This I do get. I do not agree with some mindsets that white opinions don't matter and that they need to shut up. What I do agree with is that your views may come from a place of naivety.   There was a study done earlier this year that found the majority of white Americans have zero black friends, and those that do have them only have one. I thought really hard about this...and my experience perfectly lines up with the findings. This means that for most of my friends, I am the single point of exposure they have with the black community. How can they possibly have any sort of comprehensive idea of what black culture and struggles have been like when they are only getting it from me, a gay black guy with a military brat upbringing that came from a high-middle class household?   So then the question becomes how do you go about remedying this? One of my best friends is white and grew up in Queens. He...tends to have polarizing views on black people to put it lightly. But we discuss these current events and his viewpoints. I give him liberty to say exactly what he's feeling and thinking without fear of being labeled or judged. Sometimes the discussions get...passionate, but through the honest discussions he's really been able to see that he definitely does have a prejudice he was not previously aware of. That is incredible! It means that by taking this uncomfortable bull right by the horns we can at least begin to understand where the feelings are coming from."
gaybros,3cn7wz,dcjosh,6,Thu Jul 9 15:36:03 2015 UTC,"What's interesting to me is that I noticed this type of ""hijacking"" from both ends of the political spectrum. Some friends on the left giving pretty bold reminders about the Black Lives Matter movement, some more conservative family members using that time to ask about the work needed for immigration reform. It's frustrating, to be sure, but as u/a_faget put it, people do love to play the ""Oppression Olympics."" Some people are always going to feel that their cause warrants more immediate attention than others.   However, throughout all of this, it's important for both sides to listen. On one side, yes we should absolutely celebrate the SCOTUS ruling- it's a huge victory that many have been fighting for. On the other side, it's important to acknowledge and validate the issues that other groups still face. So many of these issues are interconnected, and none of these people are inherently wrong for wanting their voices to be heard.   If only our country were a tad more unified, this would go a whole lot easier..."

People are passionate about the issues that effect them on a daily basis and if it felt like their cause or livelihood was at a stand still because some other cause was in the lime light I can definitely see why they'd be upset and say some of the things that have been said.  I feel like we're at an interesting point where all these issues are swirling about, being talked about argued over and discussed in almost every facet of our day to day lives.   I try not to care (horrible I know), because I get too upset in wanting to be right, and converting everyone to my way of thinking.

But you're right... last week, even here in Canada I knew people who were talking about how gay marriage in the 'states was irrelevant because of blah blah blah instead of having, as you called it, a day of high fives.  And yes, there is much more to be done, but could it not wait at least a day or two before we hear the bitching?"
gaybros,3cn7wz,blue_surfboard,11,Thu Jul 9 10:34:03 2015 UTC,"I think this comment gets at the heart of a lot of the issues people have with the marriage equality movement, and more broadly, ""LGBT"" movements which ultimately focus on benefitting white, middle and upper class, cisgender, gay men.   Most people aren't saying that marriage equality isn't an important issue or claiming that the recent victory wasn't a cause to celebrate. That said, at least 14 trans women have been murdered in the U.S. since the start of 2015 alone, and so many who claim to be ""dedicated to LGBT rights"" couldn't name one of them. Black Americans are being murdered by police officers on a near daily basis, yet many people, including passionate activists for marriage equality, remain completely silent on issues of police violence and refuse to educate themselves on movements like #blacklivesmatter.  Claiming that ""gay issues"" are being ""hijacked"" by issues like these completely erases the presence of queer trans people and people of color. The marriage equality movement and many gay activists want total support from other marginalized groups, but then claim that those marginalized groups are ""bitching"" when they ask for support in return. It's not hard to see why a lot people aren't 100% thrilled with ""LGBT"" movements like marriage equality, when people are dying in the streets and so many gay men stay silent while demanding that others celebrate victory with them."

It's helpful when you're working and can't find the time or motivation to go to some globo-gym. A crossfit gym usually has scheduled classes with instructors. So there's someone telling you what and how to do it. You pretty much just have to show up, do what they have planned and youre out in an hour.  It's often criticized because  crossfitters are known to be insufferable and talk only about crossfit. Which, as a crossfiter myself, I've found to be true and it can be annoying.

Always wondering whether or not people really think of you as an equal even if they say and act like you are. Sometimes there are weird moments where you suddenly become hyperaware of your sexuality even though 99% of the time you never think about it. Like I'll be having a conversation and all of the sudden I start wondering if a friend is thinking about how gay I sound. It's like a switch flips randomly and I subconsciously start trying to overcompensate for something that isn't even really present or obvious to other people. Lots of fragments of internalized homophobia and the closet you thought you were completely rid of sometimes show up. It used to be a huge mood killer for me when I was hanging out with other people, and I would go retreat back home to hide. I haven't reacted that extreme in a while. Sometimes I still find the subconscious urge to turn down social invitations because that fear of being found out is still there, even though everyone already knows. It messes with your mind sometimes!  I'll have oh shit moments where my mind starts going crazy. Did I mention my boyfriend too many times? Do they think I'm shoving it in their face? I haven't ever talked about it with this person, do they think I'm hiding something? Oh shit, was I too nice and friendly to this person, do you think they think I'm making a move on them? Oh now they're talking about their girlfriends, am I being too quiet, did I mess up by not being quiet?   I do this whole thing even with someone who I consider my best friend.  I am ok though =)"

Of course there are stereotypes, but thats not your friend. He is an individual.   Ask him all these questions yourself. Be supportive.

Experiences vary from person to person, but one of the major things that really can fuck up a person who is gay or bi is repressing it.  Those of us who grew up on conservative households (note I say conservative, not religious) generally spend years lying to family and friends about their sexuality, and that takes a toll.  It can make us uncomfortable not only with meeting new people, but also with ourselves.  For me, at least, there was the fear of getting sent off to some ""conversion therapy.""  It happened to a kid in my high school and he never was really the same person afterwards, and not in a good way."

It pains me to think people will adopt the saying to enact laws against other people b/c their views don't align with their own.  But the majority of people want to choose a side before they ""thoughtfully"" research the issues.

How can handing out a legal paper infringe anyones religious freedom?"
gaybros,3cj1tn,vladraptor,2,Thu Jul 9 06:37:03 2015 UTC,"Once you have both signed your marriage license you are considered legally married. The signing must be witnessed by an authorized representative of the state. This is usually the county clerk. Once legally married, you are bound by the same contractual rights and obligations as any other legally married couple, of which there are thousands. Simple legal stuff such as filing joint taxes to more personal right such as legal power of attorney (right to represent your spouse), and medical visitation rights."
gaybros,3cj1tn,popstar249,2,Wed Jul 8 22:28:26 2015 UTC,"Before we get too up in arms, while clerks doing this because they doesn't want to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, some of them also have been refusing to issue marriage licenses to straight couples too. Edit: making this more likely to blow up in their face, IMHO. From CBS:   [Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis] has said that her Christian beliefs prevented her from complying with the Supreme Court decision, so she decided to issue no more marriage licenses to any couple, gay or straight.   Another clerk refusing to issue marriage licenses did this:   Monday, [Casey County Clerk Casey Davis] tried to meet with Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear to ask him to call for a special session of the state legislature so it can pass a law allowing people to purchase marriage licenses online, similar to the process of purchasing a hunting or fishing license.   (Interesting that they're both named Davis, eh?) This seems like an interesting solution to me, since a marriage license is a relatively mundane thing. It's not like a driver's license where they need to ensure you can see, and obtain a photograph for the ID. I know that there are some people who will want to go down to the courthouse and have a marriage ceremony there, but in this day and age when you can be ordained to legally perform wedding ceremonies online, why shouldn't you be able to get a license to be married online as well?"
gaybros,3cj1tn,Kichigai,39,Wed Jul 8 21:40:12 2015 UTC,"Her beliefs should not affect her performance of her state ministerial duties.  Issuing marriage licenses is part of her ministerial duties.  Therefore, she is not performing her job. Whether she has stopped for straight couples too is irrelevant except to provide more extensive proof that she is not doing her job.  Forcing an official of the state to perform the duties commensurate with their responsibilities as an agent of the state is exactly why the writ of mandamus exists.  She has abused her discretion by allowing her religious beliefs to conflate with her ministerial state capacity."
gaybros,3cj1tn,rewlor,18,Wed Jul 8 22:24:38 2015 UTC,"some of them also have been refusing to issue marriage licenses to straight couples too.   Again, its their fucking job to issue marriage licenses to both straight and gay couples.  Not issuing them to straight couples doesn't make it ""OK"" that they're refusing to do their job.  If they want to make policy, they can run for an elected office.  If they want to sit on their cushy government job and collect their pension, then they need to do the damn job.   why shouldn't you be able to get a license to be married online as well   You probably should be able to.

That makes it more likely it'll get more widespread attention and piss off more people. It's kind of the ultimate culmination of obstinance that blows up in these people's face.  Perhaps I phrased it poorly, but this is kind of the best possible way they could be protesting against same-sex marriage: the kind that is most likely to cause an implosion and get broad public opinion against them.   Whether you can [get a marriage license online] or not isn't the business or concern of some dumb clerk.   I don't think it's out of line for a clerk to propose it, however.

Behind closed doors they are probably telling them to come back at a later time/date and providing them the service they are requesting. Why trust what they are saying?

People that have tattoos or piercings due to their own life choices (religious or personal) get the same treatment. Cover them up/replace them with plugs during work hours. But Refusing to do your job because it goes against your religious beliefs? Sounds like you need a change in career."

gaybros,3cj1tn,OurCreation,2,Wed Jul 8 17:27:54 2015 UTC,That's not a good solution... 'I don't want to play soccer with the faggots so I'm taking my ball home and no one can play'  We all know exactly why she stopped issuing licenses and the reason is bigotry.  She's just trying a shitty attempt to cover her ass. This should not be seen as an attempt at good faith.   Essentially she's reneging on her duties as a county clerk and should be disciplined or let go. This is completely unacceptable.
gaybros,3cj1tn,jrmax,2,Wed Jul 8 17:44:01 2015 UTC,"[Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis] has said that her Christian beliefs prevented her from complying with the Supreme Court decision, so she decided to issue no more marriage licenses to any couple, gay or straight.    That's fine, but the correct response to this is to lose your job if you are choosing to not perform it. I'd like to see what their reaction would be if a clerk refused to issue Fictitious Business Names to christians (or any other services, for that matter), thereby preventing them from starting any type of business, because it's against that clerk's belief system. You know for a FACT they would scream bloody murder because of that; also, I would bet that most  of those refusing would not bat an eye (might also start to), if a muslim were refused services... Then a jewish person, then a black & white couple... You see where this leads?       Another clerk refusing to issue marriage licenses did this:   Monday, [Casey County Clerk Casey Davis] tried to meet with Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear to ask him to call for a special session of the state legislature so it can pass a law allowing people to purchase marriage licenses online, similar to the process of purchasing a hunting or fishing license.    No, no, NO!!!!! NOT GOOD ENOUGH!! Denial of the right, as it was before the ruling (meaning, even if ALL marriage licenses are now no longer issued), is still discrimination. ANY changes or alterations made to accommodate those who refuse to do their sworn duty weakens the strength of the systems, gives positive reinforcement, validity, and possibly sets a dangerous legal precedence which would allow any & all present & future clerks the right to refuse to do any or all of their job if they have ""religious beliefs"". Why are we bending over backwards, and spending MORE taxpayer dollars to implement a solution, just to accommodate people who refuse to do their job, completely? EDIT: Marriage licenses are a legally binding contract, issued by the government, as part of the services of government. This is part of what we pay taxes for. If gay men & women are refused in any way, in any county clerks office, even if opposite-gender marriage licenses are now not being issued as well, that still reduces gay men & women to second-class citizens, and those who object due to personal religious beliefs now have special treatment, which then becomes a right they have, which is still inequality."

gaybros,3cktnl,litleozy,2,Thu Jul 9 19:48:08 2015 UTC,"I'm about half-way through Ready Player One, and I have no idea how I feel about it.  The dystopian future aspect is interesting, but it's certainly no 1984.  The virtual reality MMO aspect is interesting, but it's certainly no Snow Crash.  And both of those interesting aspects are kind of crowded out by the author's constant wanking over 80's geek culture references, which gets really old really fast.  Like i said, i haven't finished yet, but so far I'd say that it's an engaging story, but pretty shallow and pointless when you get down to it.  So I guess it's pretty good if you're pedestrian enough to read for pleasure.  (I stole that joke from Penny Arcade.) Does anyone else have any thoughts on RP1?"
gaybros,3cktnl,Dandamanten,3,Wed Jul 8 18:25:14 2015 UTC,"""...the author's constant waking over culture references, which gets really old really fast"". This is exactly how I felt reading RP1.

Even a grandiose Facebook post like this does not result in a state of ""fully out"". Coming out is something that does or does not happen with INDIVIDUAL people in your life and will or will not happen with each new person that enters your life. So I guess it's possible that OP ""fully came out"" if he did tell everyone in his life how he identifies and then immediately died. What I'm really trying to say is... Don't sweat it. You'll know when the time is right for family members, and for friends; and you'll know when it's just someone you probably shouldn't mention it to. Sexual identity is really one of the most boring things about a person, so why do we feel so compelled to mention it, other than to the ones with whom we're in an intimate relationship?"
gaybros,3ch2su,toxiklogic,8,Wed Jul 8 04:28:22 2015 UTC,"I always found it to be a completely personal experience. Sure, it involves telling others, but it doesn't necessarily have to mean that.

gaybros,3chry1,MoleMcHenry,54,Wed Jul 8 20:30:45 2015 UTC,"As usual, the pre-stonewall organizations are written out of the story. The gay rights narrative has been written mostly on the East coast, and mostly during the angry period. Stonewall fits that narrative.  The first public gay marriage was conducted in a gay church in Los Angeles. The church was established and weddings were held pre-stonewall. That would lead to the first lawsuit against a government.  The people having that demonstration where everyone had to dress conservatively was Mattachine Society. The doc doesn't even say the name, even though 15 years pre-stonewall they were defending gays in court against indecency charges. Again, that was happening on the West Coast, so it falls off the narrative."
gaybros,3chry1,Teotwawki69,20,Wed Jul 8 01:36:35 2015 UTC,"The black civil rights movement is the same way. Rosa parks wasn't the first (or the 2nd or even 5th) black person to refuse to get up from the front of the bus. Like Stonewall, she's just the one everyone talks about."
gaybros,3chry1,Teotwawki69,17,Wed Jul 8 04:07:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly, although, to be fair, she was the one that Civil Rights leaders felt would make the most compelling case to the public. Not a knock on Ms. Parks or the movement at all. I'm just pointing out how sometimes it takes political shrewdness to make a point for your side.   Remember: in the post AIDS phase of the movement, it wasn't groups like ACT UP or events like Folsom that made inroads and created straight allies. Those groups were the ""scary"" gays; it took lots of straight people seeing all the ""safe"" (i.e. straight appearing) gays coming out first to turn them to our favor. That wouldn't have happened if Stonewall hadn't happened, but the angry drag queens of New York would not have been the right media face to advance the cause. Too ""different"" from the mainstream.  This is nothing new, though -- the idea of creating a media friendly test case to overcome prejudice. You've probably heard of the Scopes ""Monkey"" Trial. This was the case in the 1920s that tried to overturn Tennessee's anti-evolution in schools law. John Scopes was not the first teacher to ignore the law and teach evolution. However, he was the right teacher (so the ACLU thought) to get through the prejudices of the press and jury at the time: white Protestant male in his 20s. In fact, they sort of had to draw attention to Scopes in order to get him charged under the law -- the equivalent, I guess, of a crack addict lighting up in front of a cop.   Ultimately, Scopes lost the case and was fined $100. The Tennessee Supreme Court upheld the law, but struck the fine on a technicality. Tennessee's anti-evolution law stayed on the books for another 42 years. So you don't always win with this strategy, but it's a very old one, and when it works it works like a charm."
gaybros,3chry1,twofirstnamez,22,Wed Jul 8 06:23:48 2015 UTC,"Wow. Did a little digging, found this on Wikipedia:   May [1959] — LGBT people clash with police at Cooper's Donuts, a hang-out for drag queens and street hustlers who were frequently harassed by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). Police arrest three people, including John Rechy, but other patrons begin pelting the police with donuts and coffee cups. The LAPD calls for back-up and arrests a number of rioters. Rechy and the other two original detainees are able to escape.   So... a decade before Stonewall, and on the west coast."

I felt that the documentary left a whole lot out, especially when it comes to details. They didn't name the Mattachine Society, they barely mentioned Act Up, and I don't think it touched on DOMA at all. I understand that it's a Canadian broadcast, but these things were mentioned in the interviews they were using from US sources.  Plus, it didn't touch on the current day issues like homelessness, depression, hate crimes, housing, etc. Let alone the issues in countries outside the US and Canada.  Watching this made me feel like a student watching a documentary about something that happened a hundred years ago, but everything is fine now.  I get it. Gay history is big and complex.

And it was a rejection of heternormative norms and an embrace of radicalism which energized the movement and brought people who felt like they could not participate in the movement before.

You may lose friends and family and that is, of course, tragic but you can still get a job (well, mostly...), not be imprisoned, find social acceptance elsewhere, live a happy life with whomever you chose to love, etc.  And not having those liberties is, at least for me, hard to imagine."

I think it's important for LGBT to know our history and our painful past, even though we're looking at a future where will hopefully not have to live through any of that.  I do get the concerns about the potential for loss of sense of community as we assimilate more and more.  The LGBT community was made of people who were rejected by their families, of people who had nowhere else to go.  It's a community that has no expectations or rules for you to follow, they were just glad to have you.  That freedom and acceptance is really what makes the LGBT community unique, and I understand the fear about losing that kind of community.  But still, I don't think the LGBT community is going to go away anytime soon now that it exists.  And it's much better now that LGBT people don't have to be conscripted into activism just for being gay."

Two parts carbs one part protein roughly. (some fats too, they should come from the food you eat anyway) Your body can make use of no more than 25-30g of protein per meal.

If you can eat right and plan meals and eat healthy, and exercise, you will gain weight. It might be slow. It might be difficult. But if you can do that...which it sounds like you can, you can do it. Your body is predisposed to be a certain weight, but you can change it with dieting/exercise. Look at people who lose 100+ lbs... gaining weight is probably just as difficult, despite the majority opinion. Being apprehensive about going to the gym because you're weak/skinny/afraid of looking stupid is a perfectly normal thought. It takes time to get used to. Realize that when you're at the gym, no one is watching you. For the most part, 99.9% of people are not concerned with what everyone else at the gym is doing. They're focused on their own workouts. Yeah it takes some time to realize this. If you go and just do it with confidence (watch workout videos to get an idea of what to do), you'll realize how much everyone just keeps to themselves and minds their own business. When I go to the gym... I'm worried about doing my workout, nothing else"

Not to judge everyone, but all of the ""eat more""  posts are at the bottom and the ""accept yourself"" posts are at the top.   Why is the body treated different than all other aspects of our life? If someone said ""I want to become a better swimmer, musician, lover, cook..., then people offer practical advice. But when someone says"" i want to become bigger (better at controlling my overall physique), people make it seem out of your control and to stop worrying.   There is nothing wrong with your goals. If you want to grow, keep asking these questions, and go to other subreddit such as fitness and bodybuilding which are great wealths of knowledge."
gaybros,3ck32y,ATBryant89,2,Thu Jul 9 04:09:42 2015 UTC,"I hear ya. The first time I went to the gym, I was shaking like hell. It felt like I was pulling my pants down in front of the crowd there. I think I did like one set on the free-weights and I was outta there. Didn't come back for months. Lol, I was a wreck.   After a while though, you start to notice that not everyone there is stacked and ripped. Some people are fat as hell, some are just ugly, some are girls... just like everywhere else. When you start to see these people, you'll see that you're neither at the top of the heap nor the bottom. Honestly, this is probably the main reason I like going to the gym. It really gives you perspective, and not just on physical fitness.   There's not much cause for social anxiety because the gym is not a social place. It's more like a library. People come in, get their work done, and leave. Sure, you might have an odd conversation or two, but it's pretty rare.   Kudos on gaining mass and definition. It sounds like you're on the right track, and doing everything you should be. The machines at the gym all have visual guides on how to use them. Just make sure you do every exercise as slow as possible (lifting weights fast is easy) and using as few of your muscles as possible.   The best part though is all the hot bunnies you get to discreetly check out. If you've only worked out at home you are really missing out. Obviously, hitting on people or openly staring is a no-no, but sometimes a few sideways glances give me just the ""pep"" I need to finish my set. Nothing like a little motivation!"
gaybros,3ck32y,analogbunny,2,Thu Jul 9 04:44:18 2015 UTC,"Not sure if anyone has mentioned this yet, but a big no-no for super thin guys (like myself as well) is too much cardio. I love to run, row, use the elliptical and for me they're easy to do. I can get my heart rate up and run for an hour without much difficulty. That doesn't mean I should.   So I cut back on my cardio, less running and biking, and put on about 15 pounds in the last year (including a time I wasn't actively working out). It's made me less uber skinny, and now I've noticed that working out is helping me build up some. I know my body type probably won't allow me to get as big as some other guys are, but having some muscle and good definition are my goals."
gaybros,3ck32y,analogbunny,4,Thu Jul 9 09:35:39 2015 UTC,"If you've been at it since 2008, then surely by now you've done everything you can do.  There are multiple theories as to what makes physique, apart from diet and exercise; there's genetics, obviously, gut flora and microbial populations, postural issues (i.e. some people just stand or walk with a posture that inherently burns more calories), metabolic issues like thyroid or insulin response... all of which are difficult if not impossible to change.  There are four categories of solution to all of life's problems:   change the world to align with your desired outcome change your desires to clash less with the world do both and meet in the middle do neither, wait it out, and let the situation resolve itself   You've been struggling with changing the world (i.e. your body), time to move on and change your mindset. Keep working out and eating well, of course, because skinny people are in a very high risk group for heart disease and stroke (mostly because they don't accumulate fat and therefore assume they're fine, when they may have as much plaque in their system as an obese person). Just stop fretting over it.  There's more than one way to be beautiful, and though right now there's a cultural emphasis on muscles and masculinity, it doesn't mean that someone 30+ years old with a teenage body isn't also hot to many, many people. So you're the wrong kind of incredibly attractive - I want you to consider how moronic a concept that is. The recent Sports Illustrated  spread that's been getting so much discussion, the one where they're putting top athletes from completely different fields next to each other, and more importantly the discourse surrounding it, should be inspirational to you.  Learn to accept your body, recognise and appreciate your own kind of physical beauty, get a hobby (not a pastime - a hobby), and nurture your inner game. And stop worrying what the other kids are writing on their tests... you'll be way happier."

Focus more on activities that are a bit more embodied and mindful, if you want to escape the crushing external forces of cultural and peer pressures. Read some positive existentialism (it does exist!), take a meditative tai chi course (good for posture, kind to booty, has combat applications, and is great for self-esteem and body acceptance), or look into mindfulness-oriented talk therapy or meditation. Much of gay culture and western male beauty standards is toxic, and lots of very attractive guys who don't fit the flavour du jour are made to feel ugly and it's unkind (""hot but can't grow a beard? then you're not hot, now are you?"").

gaybros,3ci3m7,midlift,12,Wed Jul 8 02:10:10 2015 UTC,"Much of it is hip flexibility.  Can you touch your toes without bending your legs?  Many, many, people ignore this area of flexibility and strength.  The people who can move well, like dancers and elite athletes, have the best hip flexibility - yet its always the grade school fitness test that everyone scoffs at. The other part is ankle flexibility.  How close can you get your toes to your shins, and how strong can you point them, like a dancer?  Here is a decent looking video running through hip flexibility exercises.  For ankle flexibility you don't need to do anything fancy, just work through some point/flex cycles and some ankle circles trying to get further every time.  These will make your shins hurt, especially.  Plus, flexibility in these areas - especially hips - helps with other activities too.  Like sex."

I went in for about 6 sessions and the pain in my lower back was gone.   The cause of my inflexibility was my desk job.

I started with air squats (no weight) , goblet squats(light weight) , and wall squats (no weight). You can google them to see how. Basically I'd practice at least one of those about 2-4 times a week at LEAST 20 total reps really focusing on form.   Once I could do all of those with perfect form I started working with a bar once a week. Then I started adding weight while still focusing on form. For the classic back squat I'd do 1 set of 5. Rest for about 90 seconds. Then do another set of 5. Rest. Then on the final set if I could do 5-9 reps I'd add 5 pounds the following week. If I could do 10 or more reps I'd add 10 lbs the next week. If I couldn't do the full 3x5 with perfect form I'd drop the weight (deload) by 20lbs. I just followed this cycle and got stronger and stronger.   Good luck!  I also did a similar process for progression for deadlifts, clings, and press.    Edit: I almost forgot.. Always stretch and warm up first!"

This particular gym was having a promo that waived initiation fees and I was lucky enough to be able to negotiate to get three 1-hour personal training sessions. I Used them on the first 3 Saturday mornings of my membership to get a comprehensive upper body, lower body, and core body ""basic"" workout regiment, one on each day. It was a great baseline and has been the core of my workout regiment for several years now.   Today, coupled with regular cardio on machines, I use my free gym in my office building 4-5 times a week. Handily enough, too, there are personal and group training sessions here every so often, and I sometimes do this to get ""free"" training from those classes without actually participating. Helps me add variety and new techniques to my workouts so they don't get boring.   If good looks are your motivation (sure is for me!) it doesn't hurt to do what your ""gym crush"" does.

gaybros,3cgffv,dabyathatsme,4,Tue Jul 7 19:20:39 2015 UTC,Don't do SS or these strength routines if you want aesthetics.  Do a 4 or 5 day split.  Increase reps every week and eventually up the weight for your progressive overload.  You can gain strength and learn movements doing a split.  I don't know why people assume you have to be on SS to learn a movement?  Yeesh.  It bothers me how much SS and the sort is glorified.  All it did to me was make me fat... more than once.  Volume > frequency.  Hit one muscle and kill it.  At least that's how it works for me.  Go on bodybuilding.com and look at peoples profile pics.  I've found most of the good looking guys do a split.  SS'ers are fat.

The benefit to the above is it starts out like SS (full body), then progresses to a split.  That way you can see what you like.  Not sure if you will notice a change each three weeks, but you can also see how your body responds to each phase.  One of the biggest things for beginners is progression.  When searching for a routine make sure progression is programmed in it.  Side notes:  The SS book is actually a good read for learning lifting technique, etc. And start light and get down form.

It wasn't until a couple years after I started that I finally started seeing real results. I didn't eat the right things at the right times and thought that just torturing myself at the gym would make me look like John Cena.  One suggestion I have for everybody who wants to start: For all that is holy, please look up proper form for each and every exercises. EVERY SINGLE ONE. For not just avoiding injuries but if you do proper form you will actually build the muscle you are targeting, and you will feel it. Helpful hint: Choose an exercise, perform a few reps using only the bar or the smallest weight. Again, focus on performing the full range of motion using perfect form. Then, select your desired weight. If your range of motion doesn't look EXACTLY like that of the motion using the lightest weight, then the weight is too heavy for you. Exercise your muscles, not your ego.   Also, start working on your posture. Simply adjusting your posture will make you look bigger. Shoulders up, then back, then down, keep your back straight, eyes looking forward."
gaybros,3cgffv,CSIHoratioCaine,2,Tue Jul 7 21:45:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly... If your want the aesthetics to last.  You need a foundation in actual strength.   Also change your mindset, expecting to look better takes too long and makes its hard to keep at it.  Just try to go week by week and focus on actually pushing more weight, doing more reps and in less time.  Then after a while other will notice your changes, much more than you will."

Enter: Personal trainer. Just a couple months with him and I could already see a difference in my form, posture, and overall outlook on fitness, nutrition, and personal health.

I'm a taller so landed on rowing after trying a ton of stuff because the semi-team environment is more fun to me and you get killer legs.

Seriously, you can gain all the mass in the world, but still not look healthy because of what and how much you eat. Tough lesson to learn. Took me while to learn too.

I know I definitely was, but back in the day I used daily burn (same concept of an app for MFP a.k.a. my fitness pal).  The easiest thing that works for me is making sure I get my veggies in via my protein shakes. Spinach I find doesn't dilute the taste as much. As some people call it ""brotein"", it truly helps reach your daily protein intake. It's not necessary and doesn't give you a leg up. You can easily get as much protein by eating egg whites or other protein dense food. Research macros, because diet wise, it's the only thing that's consistently has worked for me. 40/30/30 concept of 40 percent carbs, 30 percent fat, and 30 percent protein.  It's all about consistency and keeping up with it. The second you fall off, you will notice it. Life happens though, so just pick yourself up if you do. Other than that, learn how to cook lean meats and eat more veggies just like the doctor said.

The key to cardio is that you have to get hot and bothered to really make a good impact. If you don't, you're being too easy on yourself (caveat: learn max heart rate and pay attention to that for when to ease up).  For cardio that affects aesthetics, I highly recommend the step mill (the escalator treadmill) and the rowing machine. The step mill is usually free since it's a killer and everyone hates it. However, it will do awesome things for upper legs and glutes. After a year of making that my main cardio, the back of my jeans fit way better and BF was taking notice about ""doing something right."" The rower is just a good way to get upper body work in while doing cardio. I like those two since running and treadmill just seem to result in being super lean and don't provide much resistance other than mental.  Also, keeping weight training and cardio to separate days tends to result in better strength gains if that's a concern."

You want form over pushing heavier weights and full range of motion. You also need to know that change is gradual, but the first sign is that you feel a lot better over all (despite the muscle soreness) and fake it from there.

During the week, the plan is to go on Weds and work out a little easier than with him.  And there's twice weekly volleyball for fun.  I guess my advice is threefold   The trainer at the start is expensive, but he or she'll know what's up and give you a good start.   Keep/Start doing something for fun.  You don't have to be good, you just have to enjoy. Prepare to eat more.  You will be ravenous."

The weight room might seem intimidating but go in there and try out some basic curls etc. when you feel comfortable with the environment, I'd suggest getting a pre made workout plan. There are a ton on bodybuilding.com that will target exactly what you want to do (lost weight, build muscle, etc.) and start to do it!  Remember, everyone there is focused on themselves. They aren't paying attention to you. Don't be intimidated by other people."

gaybros,3cgffv,irishjerseybean,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:18:39 2015 UTC,"Cool thread, my experience at the gym has been a long long learning curve spanning nearly a decade, I'm 25 now and started at about 16. Started off doing aerobic warm ups followed by weight sessions that had lots of chatting inbetween sets and, usually 3 sets of 10 reps. I was quite overweight at this point and since then I have been tweaking and overhauling my workouts as I slowly learn what my body is responsive to. I recently changed it to 30 reps at a low weight followed by 20 with a medium weight followed by 10 with a heavy weight. I do this for most of my resistance training now and have also incorporated callisthenics and yoga :)"
gaybros,3cgffv,my_toast_sings,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:17:16 2015 UTC,"I lucked out; my coaches in HS and college sent us to the weight room with programs, and there was a dedicated strength coach at the latter.  However, once I left college and was on my own, it was rough trying to figure out a program on my own. I started by searching for intermediate strength programs, and tweaked from there.  I would say the best advice is to be consistent. If you pick up a routine, make sure you stick with it for at least a month, even if you feel like it's not doing anything for you right now. Sometimes it takes time to get results, and jumping around between workouts won't help."
gaybros,3cgffv,bynapkinart,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:31:50 2015 UTC,"I started going in April when a friend convinced me to hop on a group plan with him and his wife. I had broken up with someone 2 months before that, and was super depressed at the time. This is the first time in four attempts that I've joined the gym and kept going for 3+ months. First, if you want to look better you'll have to be lean, and you can really only get lean by adjusting diet. I cut out all added sugar and lost 45 lbs in about 2 months (depression assisted, I wouldn't recommend that rate of loss since it makes everything a little shittier), and starting with that level of loss meant I had to build back up slowly. I now lift more than I ever could before, but I attribute that to maintaining my gym presence...before I was going to the gym to both lose weight and gain muscle, and the improvement was impossible to see since I was still eating wrong. I'm 6'2"", and when I was 225 I didn't look huge but you couldn't see any muscle. This winter I got down to 180 by cutting a lot of excess crap from my diet and sticking mainly to greens and meats (natural stuff that your body can process into energy efficiently). I was still not fit, but 180 was a better starting point for the gym for me because now I can see the gains and can visually confirm that yes, it is working, so I keep going for more.  I feel like so many people make the mistake I made, which is go to the gym like a madman and try to lose weight while going crazy at the gym. I would recommend changing your diet first and getting near to what is a healthy lean weight range, then go hard at the gym and watch the improvement."
gaybros,3cgffv,josiahpapaya,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:31:23 2015 UTC,"Go to bodybuilding.com, and copy down their beginner's guide in the forums. If you're looking just for aesthetics, you're not going to last very long in the gym because there's no shortcuts for that shit, . It's going to take you at least a good year of hard work to get in the kind of shape you want. I did the beginner's guide for about 6 months, fell off the wagon for 2, went back on for 2-3 months, fell off for a couple. I didn't really notice any changes in my body, but I haven't been to the gym in about 4 months now and I feel awful. It's important to remember that even if you don't see the difference, other people definitely will. .. Don't confuse yourself with ""splits"" or ""leg day"" or any of that shit... at least not until you're no longer a ""novice lifter"". By Novice, I mean that you've been lifting steadily and consistently for more than a year or two with flawless form. Don't trust people when they tell you that if you don't ""mix it up"" your body will plateau. That's nonsense... at least for someone who doesn't have less than 10% body fat and isn't working out 4 days a week. These ""plateaus"" you hear of take a long time to actually reach, and when that time comes chances are you'll intuitively know what to do next. Do the full-body work out, including overhead press, bench press, squats, etc. Don't ""alter"" the plan. Just stick to it. 4 sets of 8 reps first week, 9 next week etc. until you reach 12 then up your weight and keep going. Drink your protein shakes and eat your meals properly and you should notice significant transformation within 2-3 months. Certainly by 6 months you'll feel a lot firmer all over your body and after a year you'll notice you're lookin pretty sexy. I cheated a lot on my workouts because I'm that rare bird that loves cardio, so I'd run 5k after every workout. I'd suggest not doing the cardio thing, or only doing it on your ""off"" days. Good luck."
gaybros,3cgffv,werqout,0,Wed Jul 8 03:05:39 2015 UTC,"Aesthetics take way more than a couple months to take effect. I'd stick with Starting Strength or Stronglifts at first, because it's really important to really nail down the main lifts technique-wise and build a good base of strength to work from. Once you've got the basics down, you can switch to a more aesthetics-focused program (this one is pretty popular).  Also, what are your main goals, aesthetics-wise? Are you trying strictly to build muscle, or do you need to cut fat? For both, diet is critical."

It seemed everyone in this town would boast and smack their bellies in satisfaction that this small city has the world's best collection of Millet's. Wtf? Why? I went to the museum and there were indeed some 20+ paintings from impressionists, mostly ""Millet"". I suggested that the paintings were copies and was met with bewilderment and rage (lol). I've searched online but it seems there's no real answer as to which paintings are real and which are copies - although to be fair, most painters in that era had their apprentices make several copies of their works to study, and would then sell them so they're practically indistinguishable. the museum's website claims that the paintings are all authentic, including some by Courbet, which I also saw... however the Wikipedia article on Millet states those paintings are actually at the Boston Museum of Arts. Cursory Google search tells me that the sister city of Boston is Nagoya, which is about 4 hours south of where I am, so perhaps they share the paintings? I don't know.

If I point out that it's acne scarring (ice pick scars to be technical), they say ""Oh, I see it now.""  Maybe they're being polite, but some days if I've cleansed, used toner, and moisturized, I catch people staring at me, and twice now in the last year I've had women approach me on the street, asking if I was available.  Then two weeks ago, I was dancing with a girl at pride, kinda bored, when she's grinding away and says ""This is so fucking hot.  But you have a boyfriend.  I can't do this anymore, or I don't know what I'll do.""  Out of my male encounters/dates, there's only one that I thought ended abruptly after he met me, and once where a cute guy made a negative comment (hamburger face) as I walked by.  He wasn't so cute after that.    And I recently turned 30, so it's a little weird for me.  I was expecting to be fat, bald, and wrinkly, in addition to having terrible acne scars.  But I keep at the gym regularly, do some lifting, wear sunscreen, and while it's certainly not an every day occurrence, have discovered people who find me attractive.  It's certainly not what I was expecting when I was 19, but it's a nice confidence boost.  I don't think I'll get surgery, though had considered it.  Not only do I have a boyfriend now, but I feel like when I was dating people that it was generally working or not working independent of my scars.  And many said I was more attractive in person.    I feel like I'm crossing into the territory of narcissism here, but hopefully have given you some perspective.

Few people have ever ""coveted"" me, and few have ever gone ""phwoar!"", but I try and not have a pity party and just get on with it.

I do think it was harder to catch the attention of certain guys, but I'd say I'm better off where I'm at without them.  I had one of the newer Fraxel treatments (the older ones were very unpleasant). It helped my skin tone and smoothed out some rough edges. I didn't expect miracles for my deep scars, but I was still disappointed. I had 8 total and I think the results peaked at 4 or 5. The aesthetician in my consultation recommended someone drive me so I could take a certain sort of pain medication afterward. Other than the numbing cream, pain management wasn't necessary. I was fine driving myself without medication.   Except for the first time, I did the numbing at home and it had done its thing by the time I got there.  The first session wasn't bad. It felt like a hot ballpoint pen on my face. The next time, she bumped it up a few notches. Add a slight static shocking feeling to that. It felt like sunburn afterward. By my last session... holy shit it hurt... We were almost as high as they would go. It was like searing, electric sandpaper. But I toughed it out. Guys have a much higher tolerance for the treatment than women (and will swear it isn't as bad as it really is). If you find some parts of your face like your temples and forehead are much more sensitive, they can dial it down for those areas. Also, err on the side of too much numbing cream instead of too little.  Some advice: Follow the before and after instructions. The first night after, SLEEP WITH YOUR HEAD ELEVATED. Seriously. The swelling will be far less severe. Drink plenty of water. Wear sunscreen everyday. They gave me Hydrovase to apply, which is acquirable O-T-C. Take a few ice packs in a cooler or those endothermic cold packs that you squeeze to activate. If you can rig up some contraption to hold them to your face using a hat or something for a while after, that would help. Or have someone drive you. You really want to stay on top of the swelling that first day.  There will be redness for a couple days, depending on swelling, then potentially a lot of peeling. Witch hazel was recommended to me and it definitely helps.  After my last session, they recommended a few Dermapen treatments. These are somewhat cheaper and far easier to tolerate. There are knock-offs on Amazon, so you can DIY at your own risk -- and safely, with some caution, IMHO. I haven't done many, but I wish they had been available when I started Fraxel.  As far as ongoing face care for myself, I do the ""oil cleansing method"" with castor, avocado, and grape seed oils daily in the morning. Look that up. I shit you not, it works very well. Remember ""like dissolves like"" from chemistry? That's what it does to the stuff clogging up pores. Not all oils clog pores, so use a recommended one. I avoid benzoyl peroxide and stick to an occasional wash with a salicylic acid product or Nivea exfoliant before the oil. My skin doesn't get excessively oily and breakouts are rare. Without some oil, your skin will be irritated and produce its own. That's when problems happen. Also, don't touch your face.   Good luck. At most, acne will probably just be a nagging annoyance and won't ruin your life if you don't let it. Maybe I'm biased, but with all other things being equal, I'd rather date a guy with a few skin imperfections than one who has never had to experience them himself."

gaybros,3cgve6,DTarkian91,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:37:18 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear you were left with scarring.  I got very lucky and avoided it despite some horrible cystic acne when I was younger.  In some cases, some minor scarring or pitting can add character to a guy's face and make him more attractive.  But I'm not going to lie, in many cases it can be distracting, at least on the face.  Other body parts not so much.  It wouldn't stop me from dating you if we were introduced and I found you interesting, but it might keep me from approaching you out of the blue.  I don't know what treatments are out there currently, but I know one of my old bosses had a wife with horrible scarring on her face.  She got something done and came back a month later with flawless skin.  So it is possible to fix, at least in some cases.  Consult your dermatologist if you are concerned about it."
gaybros,3cgve6,mystrilreddit,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:16:36 2015 UTC,"I promise this isn't a plug - my boyfriend has apparently dealt with acne issues for a long time and nothing worked for him. He started using products from this website acne.org. They have a whole regimen, and you have to do it to a T; but my guy has, and the results have been pretty amazing. He does it before bed every night, and if he skips nights, he'll get breakouts a couple days later, but when he's on it, it works really well. He swears by it.  And just as an fyi, I started dating him before he started using those products. I never really noticed his skin was bad until he pointed it out. This is all to say, you are your own worst critic - if you have a good personality, a decent face, and you're confident...you'll be fine."
gaybros,3cgve6,SlouchyGuy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:17:16 2015 UTC,I had pretty bad acne when I was younger and got left with some scars. I notice though that now a days people really don't care.  I had a friend recently got one tiny pimple and fussed over it when you could barely see it. So people are really insecure about their own personal flaws and worried about their own stuff.  Anyways if people judge you on scars you don't want to associate with such a vain person.
gaybros,3cgve6,shkaa887,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:22:07 2015 UTC,"Had acne since 11. Probably the worst acne sufferer in high school. You can imagine - I had no memorable teenage days, self esteem was in the closet.  Now I am 25, my face has turned much better. The key is water retention - where glycogen and protein molecules deposited in our muscle tissues & bloodstream retains water in our body pinching sebum canal. This leads to sebum unable to get out of our face, leading to infection from bacteria. I am the living example having experimenting tons of methods without success over past 10 years. This is what worked for me. Stopped the carbs (fall in glycogen and water retention) and acne stopped. Don't fall for medication etc, it's our diet that matters.  Fast forward, my acne scars have soften because I am doing derma stamping.   Dermastamp every 3-4 weeks Vacuum it daily for 1 week after session (to de-tether scar tissues) Rest and eat well Do not let skin dry or tan excessively Exercise and ensure diet is low in water retention (do not be afraid to drink water).   My mum said I improved by 80-90% in terms of scarring. That is with reduction in red spots. Facial tone consistency is a huge plus to my skin (meaning no red patches due to acne).  Scarring wise, scars will show out bad on the sides where photos are taken. To be honest my scars (like other posters has mentioned) made me looked rugged.  This can compliment to your masculine look (I know it's dumb but it's marketing)   Rugged look + flabby body = ugh Rugged look + fit body = Masculine   Manage your expectations well. Ask yourself how far will you go to improve your life? Eradicating scars is impossible (aiming for that porcelain skin) but to a certain point, scarring will not matter. It's about fitness, personality, maturity and stability.  tl;dr   Find out the food that breaks you out (chances are high carb diet - go keto if u like) Get exercise to boost attractiveness (just like str8 men like boobies, gay men r no different - muscles) Do dermastamping (more effective) once acne stabilizes (goal #1) Observe how your confidence is rebuilt trickle by trickle - it's a daily mindfulness - it's not easy"
gaybros,3cgve6,boss_electro,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:21:46 2015 UTC,My friend had selfesteem problems because of it and had trouble finding attractive guys to date (I think it had more to do with his confidence then with his skin). He went through some kind of laser procedure that made his face really smooth and now feels much better about himself. He is not so nervous when dating anymore.
gaybros,3cgve6,vvixx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:47:52 2015 UTC,"I used to have real bad acne but then it just kind of went away all by itself? I still have blackheads all over my face but you can only really see them if your face is approximately 2cm away from mine, so it's not a big deal.  Honestly gay guys are very shallow so it might affect your dating prospects, not gonna sugarcoat it, but make sure you have a great personality; be nice, polite, funny if possible and as cute as you can be, and it'll make up for any acne believe me.  Plus, why would you want to date a guy that was put off by you because of acne? Fuck that guy.  Peace."

gaybros,3cgve6,SilverWingsofMorning,0,Wed Jul 8 00:19:33 2015 UTC,"Without that dating angle you are referencing, I went to see a dermatologist about my acne issue recently.  Well it started off as a dandruff issue, but he pointed out the acne issue...  For the Acne, he recommended I use ""now"" over the counter available product that contains 5% Benzoyl Peroxide.  It used to be only available with a prescription.     I went to a pharmacy next to my house, that is known for not having the exact thing I am looking for.  But they had at least 10 kinds of products that contain Benzoyl Peroxide.  2 weeks in and my husband was commenting on how my skin cleaned up and was no longer red/irritated looking.  He did clear up the dandruff issue too.  Turns out I have an allergy to the bacteria my skin produces naturally.    TL;DR Benzoyl Peroxide worked for me."

Conservatism is the antithesis of progress, so it's not surprising that they are progressing on these issues very slowly…"
gaybros,3cc044,ok2nvme,7,Tue Jul 7 00:24:37 2015 UTC,"Schock's voting record certainly didn't bear that hope out.  You can hope in one hand and shit in the other, then tell me which one fills up first. People who don't pay attention (or can't manage to simply Google ""[X Politician's] voting record"") shouldn't vote."
gaybros,3cc044,josiahpapaya,7,Tue Jul 7 17:39:49 2015 UTC,"You compared being a republican to being a marginalized demographic. That's rich. I understand the comparison you're trying to make about painting in broad strokes, but speaking from the Canadian perspective at least, fiscal conservatives in political power have a disproportionate history of manipulating and lying to their voter base. My Grandmother and brother voted for the Cons in the last election because he promised to be tougher on crime and to ease the burden on senior citizens - my bro's a cop and my Nan has diabetes and needs cheaper meds and more social services, which were promised to her. What does ol' Stevie and his cronies do when he gets in? cuts funding for the police, freezes their salaries and eliminates all projects in place to aid the senior citizen demographics. Nothing he promised any of his voter bases he gave them - except tax cuts for the rich, and trying to sell our natural resources to China. Do Democrats or Liberals do this too? sure - but speaking from the experience of someone outside America who sees Fox News from time to time... Republicans are far and away the cray-cray side of the political spectrum and appear to most people to be far more disingenuous. You're allowed to be a Republican and you don't deserve to  have people be dicks to you for it, but don't try to deny that the Republican party has been the face of oppression for the past 20 years. They fight against gay marriage, they want to let the rich go without taxes, they're destroying the environment, they're taking away medicare for old people, trying to dismantle advances in women's and queer rights and they're fighting to keep the Confederate Flag waving high and proud in ""the South"". So, I mean, no offense buddy but if someone tells me they're a Republican (especially a gay rebulican) I wouldn't trust them either. I have very good, close friends who are Republicans  and some of them are gay, and my distaste for their political views is well known. that's fine, they think I'm an idiot too.

I think Sanders sounds cool, but I have to say that as a Canadian in 2011 I was devastated when the election results came back.

We still have AskGaybros linked on the sidebar as it's a great sub, but so many advice posts were getting through the cracks it made sense to be a little more lax on them. We ARE concerned about shitpost advice posts (Straight friend, bad hookup, etc.), so we are open to addressing those in the future. But lets see how this plays out.   As always, selfies on Monday only and hot guys and NSFW hot guys on Friday only."

They are a ton of fun and you are pretty much guaranteed to meet new people you'll get along with. We've been doing them since 2011 when we had like 20 people in my apartment and now we routinely get over 100 during the Summer meetups. I think 169 was our record.   Also... I completely get the sentiment of ""hey are all these people going to know each other - will I feel left out"". A lot of people do know each other because they've met through the meetups and formed friendships, relationships (lost count on how many couples have resulted from meeting at one of these), etc. But you are also walking into a really friendly and welcoming environment so don't be worried about everyone circling up in little groups and ignoring others.   So my advice would be to register (so you can get a badge) and then come.

Most of the guys we interact with on a regular basis, statistically speaking, are overwhelmingly straight. I don't know what to say other than your friends need to repeatedly pound into your heads that certain guys are just ""not a viable option"". They need to gain some mental fortitude and not allow themselves fall for these other guys. Being gay isn't the easy path in life, sometimes we need to be a little more emotionally and psychologically tough just to get by."

There is no shortage of straight guys who pine helplessly for some woman they will never have too.  Unrequited lust and love are human universals.

I disagree about telling them to stop, if they're driving you bonkers whinging about it, tell them to shut up (nicely).  Especially because there's never any new developments with this sort of thing.  It's just the same endless thought-loop on repeat.  Why should you have to listen to them belabour the same thing ""why won't he looooooove meeeeeeee"" over and over to the point of damaging your friendship with them?  Tell them they're being ridiculous and you won't be an outlet for them to indulge and re-enforce their delusions.  It's for the good of both of you.

gaybros,3cdj4r,smalleyed,7,Sun Jul 12 13:23:47 2015 UTC,I am in your friends situation.   If I was your friend and you were trying to talk to me about it I honestly don't know what you could say to me. My head knows exactly what the reality of the situation is but my heart wants to do what it wants to do. Every day it sucks and I will literally tell at myself in the car on my way to work to get the f over it and to stop being such a dumb ass. But the moment he walks in and says hi my heart takes over.   For me my feelings aren't just a disappointment but also a sort of grieving that I need to get through. It's almost like this weird break up im going through. If there's just a small bit of hope then I'm going to cling onto it. I just need time to get over it.
gaybros,3cdj4r,blazinblu,4,Tue Jul 7 05:34:15 2015 UTC,"I've been in that position a few times. I found the fastest way to get over it is to actually ask him or find out if he has a SO. If I know the guy is going around snogging girls or if a guy has a boy/girlfriend, I'll usually get over them after a lot quicker. Much easier said than done, but the problem comes when you don't know and you're always questioning and hoping. Better to get outright rejected than to cling onto something that doesn't exist."

I got over my crush...I mean more than anything I wanted a hook up, I knew a relationship wasn't practical lol. But my friends I mentioned above all want freakin relationships. I want to tell them that they are wasting so much time in their youth on guys who are actively chasing women! You don't get these years back I wish they would get it..."

gaybros,3cdj4r,ZhicoLoL,2,Sun Jul 12 13:19:53 2015 UTC,A couple times I was cuddling with one of my best girl friends at night and I got a boner. She slept on top of the covers so it was easy to hide. I've hardly ever thought about women sexually. That's why I say that we are all sexual but i think the most you can realistically want from a straight guy is a hook up. If you want a relationship I think that would be a very difficult goal because women ultimately offer things in the long term for straight guys that gay men don't have

gaybros,3cc6r4,robotboy98,14,Tue Jul 7 13:05:00 2015 UTC,"Part of it indeed is a numbers game.  Think of it this way, how many times haven't you heard straight people complain that they can't find their soulmate, now imagine taking that dating pool and removing 75-90% of the possible selection, add in those that society screwed up, those that hide behind walls of emotional defence and those that haven't developed a fully functional ability to seek, create and maintain relationships or express their sexuality due to not having role models and encouragement from family and peers.  The right matches certainly do exist, but they may just may not be bunched up close enough and in concentrations enough for you to easily cross paths with, and when you do the timing may simply be off (you're single, he's not; you're ready for a relationship, he's recovering from his last; you're looking for a relationship, he's looking to play the field;  you've settled on just what you want, he's still exploring and figuring it out; etc.).    Sometimes, too, it's a matter of trying too hard, seeking perfection (or the reverse, settling for too little), being too intense, or sacrificing your own individuality in order to be a better catch that gets in the way.  Try shifting your focus from finding the one (or many) that will complete you to being the best you that you can be and enjoy the hell out of life and it's journey and those that you meet along the way, and you might be surprised at how much more attractive that becomes and those that gravitate towards your sphere (as an example, lots of guys find that when they are in a relationship they are hit on with great regularity, but when single it's as if they are cast off and ignored.  A good part of that is when in a relationship and not looking they are simply being themselves, confident because they already have what they want, and not trying to reel someone in).  And too that I'd add, yes, surround yourself with those that you do seek out, but rather than trying to single one out and herd them off, try instead to develop a circle of friends from within that group as people tend to be attracted more to those that are commonly liked and have a following (though that's not to say there aren't those that are attracted instead to the hard to get individualist, but then we might be opening up that whole can of worms trying to figure out are men more inclined to want to be pursuers and more inclined to be turned off be pursuees or suck up all the attention being pursued and delight in rebuffing all that attention.  It all comes back to be yourself, have patience and life will have a way of sorting it out)."
gaybros,3cc6r4,werevole,15,Tue Jul 7 01:50:46 2015 UTC,"This is my hypothesis.   You're a member of one race that's only attracted to a member of different race You have one body type that's only attracted to someone with a different body type You are member of one age group that's only attracted to someone of a different age group Your mannerisms on the Masculinity/Femininity spectrum differ greatly from that of type of people to whom you're attracted You haven't met enough guys Combination of the above   Generally, gay guys, at least from my experience, seem to be attracted to someone who look/act like themselves. There's also the boyfriend twin syndrome.  Of course, this is a vast generalization, and there are tons of exceptions, but I think this may apply in your case.  Another theory is that some guys only want things they cannot get. Who knows.  At the risk of sounding shallow, it might be interesting to post pics of what you look like, the pics of guys you tended to be attracted to you, and the pics of guys that tend to be attracted to you.   If it's the personality/mannerism issue, that would be FAR more difficult to judge."
gaybros,3cc6r4,hoyaloya,3,Mon Jul 6 20:27:15 2015 UTC,"I think you have listed some good points. I have been wondering if it is possible to broaden the scope as far as the sorts of men one is attracted to. To me it feels as though it is set in stone, but I don't want to believe that's the case."
gaybros,3cc6r4,NedNickerson,5,Tue Jul 7 13:45:36 2015 UTC,"I think, for the most part, people's preferences change overtime. It may broaden/narrow for certain people. This is another conjecture, but I believe it may have to do with experience/exposure/availability/access.   Older people/people who are well traveled seem to have a broader spectrum of guys to whom they're attracted. It also seems to me that people who live in a well integrated, diverse communities tend to have a wider range of ""types"".   On the other hand, the attraction spectrum narrows in some cases as well. I think this part may also have to do with the access and availability of men around your area. For example, my ""types"" have narrowed and broadened at the same time. I'm more picky now when it comes to body and facial attractiveness, but my types are broader when it comes to race/age/mannerisms/hairiness(haha, it used to be a thing).  So yeah. What I wrote is a bunch of contradicting conjectures that's based on my limited anecdotal experiences, so take it as how you will."

If you know your type, look for guys who like it.  On a non-physical basis, consider looking for guys during activities that you like.  A common or mutual interest is often a good start."

gaybros,3cc6r4,admiral-halbert,2,Mon Jul 6 21:19:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know the magic answer, can only speculate.    Even if we all take a good look in the mirror and only go for the guys who look like us and have our same interests in common  there would probably still be some other problem, especially with guys who have low self esteem about themselves to begin with, who wouldn't want someone like themselves, but somehow think they should get the chance to poison someone else's life with their problems that falling in love with someone does not cure.    If you are using some app then you just have to accept that reality trumps your fantasy since the majority of guys on apps are not looking for the same thing you are, no matter how much you have in common, or how well you get along with them. Love just isn't as high on their priority lists as it may be on yours."

gaybros,3c92ir,BenBro,2,Mon Jul 6 18:56:16 2015 UTC,"As someone who also doesn't really like beer but is coming to appreciate them, my advice if you want to get into beer is to ignore the craft beer afficionados and just stick with something like Coors Light until you get to the point where it doesn't taste bad, then move on to the fruit beers suggested by /u/BenBro or a light Belgian.  My friends tried so hard with dozens of beers (""this one I think you'll like!"" ""ugh, tastes so bitter"" ""well this one is fruity!"" ""there's fruit in that crap?"" ""this one is chocolatey!"" ""do you mean burnt chocolate?"") and nothing was remotely good until I just got used to the taste of simple, shitty, macrobrews.  I used to make what my friends call ""beer face"" where my face twisted up into this awful mess with any kind of stout, porter, or IPA and most other beers, but lately I haven't been doing it as much and I swear, it was getting used to the shitty beers my friends wouldn't let me try that finally did it."
gaybros,3c92ir,ArekDirithe,2,Mon Jul 6 21:13:13 2015 UTC,"I...can't really agree with you here, personally. I can't ever recommend starting with the likes of Coors Lite, and in fact if you do start there you become so programmed to that archetype (which represents a very small segment of flavors are represented in beer) that it becomes difficult to veer off, though I'm glad this wasn't the case for you.  If you're suggesting a pilsner (the style Coors emulates), then I would suggest one by a craft brewery, which is more thoughtfully designed and tends to use better ingredients. Oskar Blue's Mama's Lil' Yella Pils or Avery Joe Pils are two of my favorite go-to pilsners and I often recommend them to those who are stuck on the mass-brewed trail.

No amount of pilsners or lagers with ""full"" flavor from a craft brewery acclimated me to the taste of beer.  Honestly, craft beer has too many flavors for me to be able to acclimate to, hence, starting with the ""shit"" beer that has a simple flavor that's easy to get over.  This is really something I think craft beer people have to get over themselves about.  Some people just really hate the taste of beer and trying to give them stuff that has more of that flavor they hate makes absolutely no sense, regardless of the fact that those beers are objectively made with better, fresher ingredients and more care is put into the flavor profile.  You don't get someone who hates spicy food to appreciate it by starting them off with habanero peppers."

gaybros,3c92ir,firefruze,2,Mon Jul 6 04:25:28 2015 UTC,"Kind of hard for organizers to do. I agree that many beer festivals/weeks are now a pain for people looking to expand their library (sorry, I'm also a whisky and wine guy). But organizers and brewers are trying to get as many people in to hopefully move product in the future. More exclusive tasting venues tend to be populated really by industry guys who can expense the admission or get their employer to do it (or university for food, wine and brewing majors). When shelf and cooler space in supermarkets, convenience stores and BevMo are dominated by InBev, SABMiller, Heineken and Carlsberg, festivals become a key marketing strategy.  The downside to the key strategy is the whole ""let's get drunk! Woo!"" mindset of a growing number of attendees. And it's not just beer festivals. I live in Napa, where all the tourists ""touring wineries"" pretty much means taking your mother in law to go get blitzed on over oaked cabs for $30 because you're all too cheap to buy bottles. If some people think they have a chance of getting as drunk as possible for as cheaply as possible, they'll do it. I like the tasting room at wineries. I get that chance to chat product with people who know it. And then I run into Mark and Amy from Jersey, who haven't bought a single bottle, but they're both on their fifth ""taste"" and trying to weasel another. Or when teaching a whisky ""masterclass"" on campus. I knew exactly who signed up just to drink as much scotch as possible in 3 hours. Those people are going to be inevitable."

The name is derived from the Flemish word for this type of cherry (kriek). Traditionally ""Schaarbeekse krieken"" (a rare Belgian Morello variety) from the area around Brussels are used. As the Schaarbeek type cherries have become more difficult to find, some brewers have replaced these (partly or completely) with other varieties of sour cherries, sometimes imported.  Traditionally, kriek is made by breweries in and around Brussels using lambic beer to which sour cherries (with the pits) are added.  A lambic is a sour and dry Belgian beer, fermented spontaneously with airborne yeast said to be native to Brussels; the presence of cherries (or raspberries) predates the almost universal use of hops as a flavoring in beer.  A traditional kriek made from a lambic base beer is sour and dry as well. The cherries are left in for a period of several months, causing a refermentation of the additional sugar. Typically no sugar will be left so there will be a fruit flavour without sweetness. There will be a further maturation process after the cherries are removed.  More recently, some lambic brewers have added sugar to the final product of their fruit beers, in order to make them less intense and more approachable to a wider audience. They also use cherry juice rather than whole cherries and are matured for much shorter periods.

I myself am currently in the ""beer hater"" category though on a trip to Colorado had some beer from Avery that I actually [gasp] liked, so I may be moving into a different category.  My husband has been in the ""explorer"" category for a couple of years and drags me with a couple of our friends to brewfests and breweries in the SoCal area from time to time.  I always tried stuff but it took a couple of years before I tasted a beer I actually wanted to get a bottle of (Avery's quad).  Anyway, just commenting to say that your BF has a way of telling an interesting story with his blog."

If you like the hipster scene, St. Claude street is probably your jam.  As far as gay bars go, I really enjoy good friends and golden lantern, they are more laid back and divey.  700 club is usually hopping, probably a little more hookup oriented (good bar food too).

If you're in the Bywater then Maurepas and Elizabeth's are good.  If you're uptown Superior Seafood has Frozen French 75's and Frozen Pomegranate Mojito's.  (there's a Mexican superior as well that has strong margs and ""ok"" tex-mex).  It's hot as fuck right now so frozen drinks are on my mind.  As far as Gay Bars, check out the Pub and Good Friends, unless you want to dance to club music, then Oz.  There are two Lafitte's, one is ""gay friendly"" and full of both straight and some gays, and has a frozen drink called the Voodoo that tastes like grape kool-aid, but WILL FUCK YOU UP; and there's ""Lafitte's in Exile"" which is a real gay bar and can get, let's say dirtier than the others, but has an awesome Bloody Mary in the morning...

However I don't think that jealousy is healthy to have.  You mention that they were dealt a really good hand of cards, but I don't think that's necessarily true.  Bodies like that take a tremendous amount of dedication with diet and exercise, so it's not like they just were granted bodies like that.  It may be shallow or whatever, but one of the motivators for getting into working out was to be hotter so I could stand a better chance with hotter dudes.  My thing whenever I'm rejected is that I'm not owed attention from anyone.  If someone's not interested, they're perfectly free to ignore me or whatever.  And also I wouldn't place those guys at the ""top"" of whatever spectrum there is.  I'm sure they have their fair share of problems too."

But I've never met them and I'm unlikely to ever meet them. Whether or not they're happy/attractive has no bearing on my life. What's the use in being frustrated that they have things when I could use that energy to work out more or otherwise improve my life. Getting dealt a shirt hand doesn't mean you leave the table and never come back. You'll never win that way. I've won plenty of poker games with a shitty hand because I played better than others.  If anything I look at people like this for motivation. I can be better than them. If they can achieve something that just means it's possible. And if that's possible than the only thing between me and it is going out and trying. I'm living now. No idea if I'll get another shot and life do I might as well floor the accelerator and kick ass while I'm here. No one's going to wait while I catch up.

Dude... WHY? I'm not being a hater in any way, I'm just baffled.  What is the appeal to you? That they're two good-looking men? Okay, fair enough... That if 1 of them gained 10 lbs, the other one would probably bail? That they seem to live for twitter followers and modeling themselves? That their happiness seems to come from the fact that they've both found someone whose narcissism vibrates at the same frequency as theirs?  Maybe I'm reading too much into their pictures, but so are you.  Try to take a moment to consider the fact that each of these ""easy, flawless"" moments required an hour of discussion, posing, light adjustments, multiple takes, filter tries, posting, and the constant phone checking to see the comments.  This isn't the couple that you see holding hands on a night walk, holding grocery bags, and that makes your heart hurt, wishing for the same thing; it's the couple taking selfies loudly and then getting.  They seem like props to each other's lives. Impossible standards + selfies. Which does not mean they're not a real couple (see Kanye and Kim) but it's a hollow vapidness, that I just can't imagine being anything less than exhausting.   I don't hate them, but I certainly don't envy them. This form of intimacy looks as plastic to me as a Norman Rockwell painting and it's partly why I've never felt super at ease in the gay world...

You can spend a whole day at the natural history museum, it's awesome, definitely go wander round the mammal room, they've got a fuckin' blue whale in there, two of them in fact. There's even some elephants and a bunch of manatees, who the fuck doesn't love a manatee? If you like warry shit then go to the imperial war museum and look at some guns and stuff. Definitely go to the British Museum, or as all the archaeologists call it 'the museum of stuff we stole from everyone when we owned them'; it contains a collection of some of the most incredible artefacts from around the entire world, literally priceless treasures that form the backbone of the history of modern civilisation that can't be seen anywhere else, all in one building.  Also go to Camden, it's awesome. While you're there go to the food market and try everything, you can try it all for free, don't even have to ask they practically throw it at you with no obligation to buy anything from them. Cyberdog is pretty cool even if you're not into the rave seen, it's just full of random flashing shit. Camden's a great place to buy gifts to take back home.  Wander round Kensington and feel poor, or pretend you're rich. There's a great place called the hummingbird bakery that sell delicious over-priced cakes. it's sandwiched between a shop that sells Lamborghinis and another that sells Maseratis.  Obviously go to westminster and look at all the fancy buildings. If you like history get into the tower of london and go round on a tour with one of the beefeater's; they're all retired soldiers with hilarious senses of humour who know all the fun history.  After you've pestered the retired soldiers go pester some serving ones and get a selfie with one of the queen's guard. Contrary to what many write on Reddit they won't shoot you and they're all happy to stand there for a photo, even if you accidentally brush up against them. Just don't touch them on purpose or you'll end up on youtube as yet another tourist getting yelled at and bayonetted.   If you want more history and want to feel fancy you can get a tour of buckingham palace, you won't get to see the queen though.  Kew gardens is a nice place to go for a wander if you just fancy a walk and want to see some crazy tropical plants.  Go to hamley's and pretend to be 5 again and play with all the toys.

Coming out is a process for the rest of your life and it is YOUR decision of whom to tell and who not to. If you want to reserve that information to close friends only or people that you have established a bit of trust with, then that should be your choice.

No idea where that is (I am a transplant to the colorful) and I can't find a link to the event outside Facebook :(  Out of what I've done, the most majestic was doing Fourteeners, including Grays, Torries, Bierstadt and Evans.

But if you're going to schlep up there you might as well keep going north and head to Nova Scotia.  The northern island cape Breton is spectacular.  I can put you in touch with a friend of mine who owns an outdoors store up there. He will tell you all the best places to go.   The white mountains and the presidentials are really nice too. That's New Hampshire.   I went backpacking in NY's Adirondack mountains. They were pretty fun. Some good topography with great views.   Also close to NYC is the Catskills. I've gone on a bunch of fun trips there too. You can actually hike from Manhattan all the way to the Appalachian Trail. I think it's called the long trail. You cross the Washington Bridge and head north along the NJ side of the Hudson.  Never done that but it always intrigued me."

Amazing view of the Mackinac Bridge from the beach, which is only a couple feet from the campsite. I'm probably 1/2 mile from the closest other campsite. Spend most of the time reading on the beach, hiking in the woods, and enjoying the campfire. Headed there in a couple weeks. I have yet to see a single person besides the friends I go with. There's some very gorgeous remote wilderness in Michigan to experience explore and enjoy. Definitely recommend spending some time here."

There's a canoe route across the island that I want to try.   Been to the Porkies quite a few times that is a good staple. I think my favorite thing to do there is rent one of those rustic cabins right on the lake in the fall. The wood stove keeps you so toasty.   And Sylvania wilderness also in the UP is an excellent BWCAW/Quetico alternative. My former gf and I spent some time up there and I don't think we ever saw another person the entire trip.   A buddy of mine is a wilderness guide and he swears by pictured rocks national lake shore. Ever been there?  Also not far from macinac island is Lake Superior provincial park. I guess canoeing the sand river is supposed to be awesome. You have to ride a train to get to the canoe landing. The train engineer adds an extra car to their train for your canoes....

Half the time I paid for him we just talked, and when his ""timer"" went off, we were mid-fuck and I was lie - oh shitttt, but he just smiled and said he didn't care if we kept going and let me finish, AND we chatted for a bit after. Getting a rentboy isn't as skanky as you might think. 3: I'm only 5'5, so I hooked up with this SUPER CUTE guy who was an inch shorter than me. Amazing body, amazing ass, and the faces he made when I was inside him haunt me (in the good way) to this day. 4: this one's not that nice, but when I was dating my first serious boyfriend we had a toxic relationship and I cheated on him quite often. One time actually turned into an affair.... with his professor. A young guy, only in his early 30's when I was 19-20. I had a dorm on campus and also lived with my boyfriend. When I stayed on campus I'd send him a text and he'd come to my room after he was finished teaching and we'd fuck. I went to his house a couple times. We hardly spoke at all, and it was very in-and-out. We both had wild sexual chemsitry."

If you have any special certifications or CE in the realm of critical care, talk about them. Also show that you understand the various flight nursing duties that could come up specific to fixed wing (such as low altitude ambulance scenarios), and that you understand how standard emergency procedures differ at altitude, how altitude influences equipment you'll be working with, and the unique aspects of patient transfer to an aircraft.  One of the most reputable and well-known medical air transport services in my country operates out of the international airport in my city, and they won't even look at a nursing candidate who has less than 12-18 months of full time emergency/trauma/critical experience.  If you haven't already, post your question to /r/nursing as well. There are a few flight nurses who participate there who might offer additional insight. Best of luck to you!"

As cliche as it sounds, try to sound confident and look relaxed (but professional) as much as you can. Make good eye contact with everybody you're interviewing with and practice your talking points ahead of time. Think up a couple of stories from when you were studying/practicing nursing that you can rattle off without a second thought and that show your passion for the job you're applying for. Don't force it, but throw in some terminology that comes up regularly in your coursework and that will demonstrate you know what you're doing. Think about what makes you unique compared to the however many other people there were in your class.  Finally, google ""nursing job interview questions"" or something similar and practice going down a list and thinking about what you'll say. Know why you want to work in this particular field of nursing and for this particular employer.  Kick ass tomorrow!"

I'd forget to breathe, I couldn't eat, I had to pee about 15x an hour, I'd break into a sweat. I tried to play it off like I was cool as a cucumber, because I love public speaking and I never get nervous... but I think it was the idea that I was trying to entertain strangers and that I took it really seriously. I used to talk to the regular performers afterward and get feedback on how to improve. I told the one girl I respected the most about my nerves and she just put her hand on my shoulder and said ""it's not nerves, it's adrenaline. Use it."" So that's what I'll say to you. You need to get into that frame of mine that you're on an adrenaline high because this is something that means a lot to you. You should try to focus on that, and good luck."

Hoping to be living away from home for the summer, just for the sake of independence, new experiences, etc.   This one did not work out the way I hoped. I'm helping out in the lab at my university, but it's unpaid, low hours, and I'm still living at home. Makes things look better for next summer though!   Run a marathon   I'm registered for the Nationwide Children's Hospital Columbus Marathon in October, but I'm still yet to really train for it. Gotta get on that!   Work on myself. Physically: start getting to the gym, I could stand to gain a few pounds of muscle, eat better; and in the abstract: spend my time getting to know myself, figure out what I want/need out of life and just start going for it.   As far as the gym is concerned, I've done great. I lift 3-4 times a week, and I've made visible progress. As far as the abstract stuff, I've done well with that! I spend time almost every day actively assessing my needs/wants, and I've started taking the necessary steps to attaining those ideals.    Relationships: No interest in romance at the moment, but focus on creating and maintaining healthy and valuable relationships with myself and others in any capacity.   I think I've done great on this one. I do my absolute best to make time for everyone in my life that matters to me, family and friends. I attempted a romantic relationship recently, but we mutually agreed after a few weeks that we weren't ready for it, and that despite mutual liking of each other, we were putting ourselves through hell trying to make it work with where we both are in our lives. I may not have a boyfriend, but from the experience I gained a great friend, and who knows what can happen in the future.   Stay the hell off those apps (Grindr, Scruff, etc.); they do nothing for me personally, I'm much better off without them.   I did relapse on this for a short time, but through Grindr I did meet the aforementioned boy, so it wasn't all bad that I did. No intent on re-downloading any time soon though.  And to close, I have a bit of a Mid-Year's Resolution: to beat my anxiety, and have it stop hurting me in my everyday life. I've begun to stigmatize myself based on my mental health, and what I've learned from that so far is that it's absolute horseshit to do that. I started going to counseling, I picked up a book on shame and vulnerability that I've been meaning to get back to, and I have an idea for a tattoo that will give me a reminder that's always on my person for when I need it.

I also had made the decision to pick up my life and move west for a new start. Also I planned to lose the 20 pounds I gained during my depression period last summer and fall.   I have completed 75 pages of the book. All those 75 pages were completed in January and February. The book just got put to the back burner. I'll be honest for a while I couldn't even open the file with getting really sad, because I missed him. I am starting to get back into writing now though.   As for moving, I got accepted to an arts school in Vancouver. I am now just waiting for my student loan to be approved before I make the 4000 km journey. I am incredibly excited for the next two years of my life.   Finally, I have lost 15 pounds (165-150) and I'm now looking to add on some more muscle. I used my parents' rowing machine during the harsh Canadian winter, and have been biking on the trails since the snow melted.    My life got a bit dark there in 2014.

gaybros,3c54d8,luirro,18,Sat Jul 4 22:18:03 2015 UTC,"First, that's tough, bro. Something similar has happened to me on more than one occasion, and it sucks. Sorry.  There are more than several reasons he might have indicated to you that he doesn't identify as gay.  First, he just might not be sexually attracted to guys. Period. He just may be almost flirtatious with them (especially since he almost certainly knows that his looks make him very attractive to men), but that doesn't mean he's interested in sex with guys.  Or he might be interested in guys but not identify as gay. Sexual preference isn't really a choice; sexual identity is. There's a possibility that he doesn't think of himself as gay but does like sex with men. He could identify as straight but like the occasional hookup with a guy. He could be bisexual. There are a number of possibilities in this range.  Or he could be struggling with the idea that he is interested in sex with men, and might gay, but is having a hard time dealing with it.  None of this makes it any better for you, I'm sure. But sexuality is not straightforward for everyone, and from your description of the events he sounds like he's maybe in a period where he might not be sure about how he feels about his own sexuality.  Better luck next time, bro. You're young, you've got lots of time to explore, and there's plenty guys, I'm sure, who would find you just as interesting as he did."
gaybros,3c54d8,EntoBrad,7,Sat Jul 4 22:24:35 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the club. I happened to me too and I found out why it happen because I have done it to girls too and totally unconscious. Both of you, you and him are secure and confident guys and it shows on how you behave and socially interact. So it was easy to the two of you to make a connection putting sexuality aside."
gaybros,3c54d8,guzaara,4,Sat Jul 4 22:18:09 2015 UTC,"Bi? Before I was comfortable with my sexuality I'd always say I wasn't gay if I was asked, but say bi if they pressed more."
gaybros,3c54d8,planification,6,Sun Jul 5 01:34:20 2015 UTC,It's quite possible that he just doesn't know he's gay yet. Or isn't ready to accept/admit it.
gaybros,3c54d8,tips_,3,Sun Jul 5 00:27:32 2015 UTC,"Some people are really good conversationalists.  But on the other hand, he didn't mention anything about not being bi.  And he may not be out of the closet yet, and didn't want to commit to the identity right there in public.  A better move may have been to get his number and ask him via text, or maybe ask if he'd ever thought about doing something with another guy.  Closeted guys are weird like that.  Are you gay?  ""No way, I just think about dick all the time.  But I'm going to get married to a woman.""  These are ideas I think many of us relate with.  The only lesson is to try not to pin down people so early."

gaybros,3c54d8,ryanpaul38,2,Sun Jul 5 06:47:39 2015 UTC,I sympathize with this so hard. :( Hugs!! But is he still going to be friends with you though? It's easy to be so choked about the missed opportunity for more that you miss out on the great benefits of friendship.

gaybros,3c54d8,chinchillin88,2,Sun Jul 5 13:30:57 2015 UTC,"Everybody gets turned down, and it's tough for gay people because the majority of people we'd be interested in physically are not even into us. Try to let your crushes be a fun thing, since it's usually a no-no-no-yes game anyway. I haven't had a serious emotional straight crush since I was in high school, but I still get straight crushes pretty regularly still, because I like to ogle. It's funny because I just won't talk to them since I know my number one goal would be to stare until I left the room. Instead, I talk to all the girls that walk past the presence of this good looking straight guy and laugh about how cute I think he is, but on the down low. It's better to let your crushes come and go, keep your eye out, and actively pursue things until you find out they're dead ends. It's not really a bad thing to be turned down, since it's so common, the feeling basically goes numb. By that point, you can't get hurt by a guy being straight, but you can benefit if you learn he's gay, so it really is positive to ask about it."
gaybros,3c54d8,HowIsYourDay,2,Sun Jul 5 00:19:14 2015 UTC,"1) take it as a compliment that he had such a great conversation with you even though you were strangers. That obviously means you are a nice approachable friendly person, regardless of sexuality.  2) you could end up being good friends.  Yes, so it might not be romantic. One of my best friends from college is straight - and super hot. I wouldn't trade the fun (non-sexual) and memories I have of us hanging out for anything. We live nearly 1,000 apart now but still call each other up and hang out whenever we're in the area.  3) you're 18 and will have plenty more opportunities with hotties. Yeah, you didn't get the outcome you hoped for, but don't let any of this change who you are."

gaybros,3c54d8,jofnj,2,Sun Jul 5 14:46:40 2015 UTC,"Had a similar thing happen.  Met a guy at a friends house warming; really charming, eyeing me a bit, great conversation. Seen him a few times after that, same things happened.  Told him I was gay about a week ago.  Last night while watching fireworks, he just randomly starts talking about his ex-gf that he was almost engaged to and another ex that was across the country.   Kind of a heartbreaker. Almost feels like I'm cursed with finding someone."

gaybros,3c2pke,technoanimate,9,Sat Jul 4 13:47:03 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I had no idea! Reminds of Jack Harkness. Will the deadpool in the upcoming movie be queer also?"
gaybros,3c2pke,MoleMcHenry,4,Sat Jul 4 20:22:42 2015 UTC,"Most definitely not, he's only had female love interests, even getting married in one of the comics. He's had no serious relationships with men, having only ever flirted with them."
gaybros,3c2pke,technoanimate,3,Sat Jul 4 20:59:58 2015 UTC,"I mean...I think he had a major thing for Cable during that whole comic run. I can't say whether or not if they had done the series today there would be anything more to it, but I think his continued fascination/pining/whatever you want to call what he was doing for Cable was well beyond his usual one-liner flirtations with guys. While obviously that's not a fully-fleshed out relationship, it's still...something to note, I think."
gaybros,3c2pke,TheLonelySamurai,2,Sun Jul 5 10:02:50 2015 UTC,"Their relationship could be described as a bromance. It would be very interesting if Cable appears in the upcoming film, they'd either acknowledge the comic sexual tension between the two, or (as I suspect) they'll completely ignore the homo-romantic nature of their friendship, typical Hollywood :/"
gaybros,3c2pke,technoanimate,2,Sun Jul 5 12:23:21 2015 UTC,"I feel like it was possibly bromance from Cable's side, romance from Deadpools, insomuch as Deadpool is really capable of having a solid romantic relationship that doesn't eventually fall apart. What really interested me was how many of the hints in that comic were less about Deadpool's snark, and more about others noticing the homoeroticism. The villain who uses her powers and forces Deadpool to see what he desires more than anything in the world (his ""deepest, darkest desires"" or something of that nature--I'm due for a reread) comes to mind, and of course it's that big ol' homoerotic scene at the beach with Cable groaning ""Yeah, that feels good Wade,"" while Deadpool rubs lotion all over his back.  I would kill to see Cable on the big screen, but I don't think it will happen. :/ If it did happen, they would completely ignore the sexual tension. Deadpool's big screen version is not going to be pansexual, you mark my words. The most we'll get is some tasteless lowbrow gay jokes, and I'm upset that I'm already bracing myself for it. :("
gaybros,3c2pke,TheLonelySamurai,23,Mon Jul 6 06:57:59 2015 UTC,"I feel like deadpool has always been about pushing readers' buttons. The sexuality has always been couched in jokes, not actually depicted as truth, but its definitely established that he hits on men, and especially Spidey."

I don't think it needs to be the super manly, manly sub (which it isn't). But i do think that others should know (or maybe be told via the sidebar) that this sub doesn't need to be 100% butch 100% of the time. Some guys get super mad when something not so ""bro"" is posted.   My biggest complaints (like /u/aj_reddit_gaybi said) are guys that post selfies with the caption ""just got a new tie"" for no reason. Those need to stay in /r/gaybrosgone mild. And guys that post random videos of gay youtubers talking about their day (as opposed to something relevant) just because he's hot. I think the former do get moderated pretty well but a few fall through the cracks.   I'm also not against guys posting questions here. The atmosphere here is a bit more...serious(?) than it is over on /r/askgaybros. It's kind of like asking a question in comments of a youtube video(/r/askgaybros) vs asking a question on reddit (/r/gaybros)."
gaybros,3c41a2,Captain-Steve,2,Sat Jul 4 20:13:22 2015 UTC,I agree that there's been a little bit of a serious tone here. I think on the moderation side it's because many gay jokes get removed (like most posts seeing the word top/bottom in every day contents. Maybe we should relax on moderating those?
gaybros,3c41a2,avian_buddha,3,Sat Jul 4 20:26:12 2015 UTC,"No, no need to relax. The words top and bottom exist on signs or wherever, it's not that funny."

I guess this is the part of /r/gaybros that has always confused me a little.  I was kind of intimidated when I first started frequenting the sub a couple of years ago (if intimidated is the right word, maybe too strong...) because I wondered if the sub was ""more butch"" than I was.  There's still a lot of ""brah"" and ""bros"" thrown around, which I still think is a little goofy sometimes (only because I'd never say something like that myself), but it's not like I have a problem with it either -- it's just been a part of the sub since it started and I feel like everybody is pretty accepting of one another regardless of where they fall on that spectrum.  Anyway, I guess that was a long-winded way of saying that I'm happy to have found /r/gaybros; overall I think it's a light, fun place that doesn't take itself too seriously trying to be PC but that still maintains a nice sense of community."
gaybros,3c41a2,Chris770,18,Mon Jul 6 00:17:24 2015 UTC,"The only thing I would suggest is a ""no obligatory 'gay spin' required on theme appropriate submissions"" policy. The whole ""sports, cars, grilling, military issues, working out, gadgets and gear"" thing makes very little sense, when you're fairly certain most posts on any of those subjects are just going to get complaints from people who feel they aren't ""gay enough."" (Usually taking the form of people growling about it not being a ""gay issue,"" or saying you've posted it in the wrong sub, even though the sidebar explicitly invites such stuff.) If you really want to encourage more communication, add an extra rule to the effect that it's not appropriate to be fussy about that."
gaybros,3c41a2,Captain-Steve,5,Sat Jul 4 18:08:11 2015 UTC,"There isn't an obligatory gay spin on submissions, the original idea was for gay men to have a space to discuss topics of interest that didn't always have to revolve around being gay. However content is user driven, and what you see on the subreddit is what people are interested in, which is why we're now asking the sub for their input."
gaybros,3c41a2,Chris770,5,Sat Jul 4 22:18:48 2015 UTC,"Some have vehemently disagreed, and went ahead to point out that anything which isn't specifically ""gay-related"" belongs in other subs, even when it involves topics which have been explicitly invited here. However, I'll go forward with the reassurance that they weren't representing the opinions of anyone other than themselves in the matter."

A guy who hunts and fishes is no less or no more statistically gay than any other guy who hunts and fishes.  But it's practically Newtonian -- if the pendulum swings one way, it must swing the other.    If a guy who hunts and fishes is finding it hard to find like-minded gay-brethren in /r/ainbow or /r/GayGuys  (only mentioned since they're in the sidebar), he might find them here.  If not for any reason other than that stereotype pendulum suggests they should.    We're the balance that makes the stereotype a whole picture, again.  Truth is, the stereotype is wrong.  There is no greater proclivity to certain activities and interests based on sexual orientation -- we're likely all into everything in similar proportion as is the rest of the sexual spectrum.

The ""gay community"" no longer serves any sort of social gatekeeping role, owing mostly to modern social networking technology. A couple decades ago it might have actually meant something to be rejected by it, but those days were largely over before many of us were out of diapers, or even alive.  Most of my involvement with the ""community"" has mostly been through direct action volunteerism, and people there keep their opinions to themselves because they can't afford to be picky."

gaybros,3c41a2,ThatBernie,4,Sat Jul 4 16:10:54 2015 UTC,"I think a big part of what makes r/gaybros so appealing is the middle ground that it occupies. It's not quite a gay subreddit, nor is it strictly a ""men's interests"" subreddit. It's somewhere in between, and while there is definitely a general theme and atmosphere, there is plenty of room here for people to go against the grain and make posts or comments that go against the majority, thus exploring the sometimes nebulous nature of what it means to be gay and have men's interests. So I don't really see much of a need for any major changes around here, to be honest."

Personally, I think all the coming out stories should have a better place to go, but I have no solution to that, especially considering that this subreddit seems to often be a source of inspiration for those coming out stories and that is not something I want us to turn our back on.  As mentioned by another poster in this thread (sorry, on mobile), we do seem to often get a snapchat and instagram thread going pretty often.

I know it will be quite hard given the fluid definition of gaybro, but it would be great if acceptable vs. unacceptable content could be better identified, perhaps with contrasting examples.  And follow it with consistent enforcement -- or, when an exception is made making it clear why.  Which brings up my next suggestion.  When posts get removed or unlinked, a moderator comment explaining why in the thread would be very helpful.  I know it adds extra work but explaining why will hopefully make it less likely to happen in the future.  Some people never realize their submissions have been de-linked.  I know you personally have been great about making notes in removed threads, but others frequently don't."
gaybros,3c41a2,jwax33,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:27:28 2015 UTC,"I agree that we as moderators should message more users on removed content. Sometimes it's easier to quietly remove, but you're right. I'm trying to improve that with myself, and have been slowly adding generic moderator messages onto my mobile app, so I can quickly tell users why a post was removed. We expanded the rules a few months ago to include what was and wasn't allowed, and maybe we can clarify them some more, but the hardest part is to get people to read the rules.  For instance, Advice posts aren't allowed. It's posted on the sidebar, on the rules wiki page, on the Submissions page between the text box and the submit content box, and, in the automoderator message to the user if it's caught by the automoderator (most advice posts are posted by throwaway accounts). Despite these four places, there are still mod messages asking why a post was removed.  I appreciate your feedback. If there's any other comments, or thoughts.

I'll try to moderate when I'm in line for a coffee, or something similar but we aren't always here. We implemented the automoderator to help with the consistency on some topics, but a human component is still very important a.  If you have any suggestions, we would love to hear."
gaybros,3c41a2,Captain-Steve,2,Sat Jul 4 19:22:40 2015 UTC,Well I've seen this sub change a lot but the posting guidelines themselves are complete trash to follow. Coming out posts at moderator discretion? General LGBT news yet I see a lot of it on the first page. I thought a lot of the live journal- type posts could better be saved for Sunday or even /r/askgaybros. That's the problem with a user generated community.
gaybros,3c41a2,kcos,2,Sat Jul 4 18:36:50 2015 UTC,"Coming out posts are important, and in the survey from a while back, many people said they like them. We added ""at moderator's discretion"" as an option for removing low quality coming out.  I'm sure quantifying the quality of one's coming out post is objectionable, but it was a way for us to point to the rules for those who 1). only shared their coming out video as a means to promote their YouTube website or blog and had no other interest in the subreddit (blogspam). 2). The cellphone screen captures or short blurbs of conversations that go ""I came out,"" that's cool bud,""  There's lots of great personal stories on this topic, but they have to be told. Knowing the mindset that I laid out above, what are your thoughts on the rule? Should we allow carte Blanche on any coming out story? Should we clarify the rules (and if so, how?) should we change the rules?"
gaybros,3c41a2,Captain-Steve,3,Sat Jul 4 19:19:49 2015 UTC,"I like the idea that if we're going to set aside a day strictly for coming out posts in an effort to generally be able to share or have people offer a suggestion for people coming out.   I really don't care for the live journal rants or stories people post about their dates or relationships that can be better suited for /r/askgaybros or /r/relationships. I will admit there are certain exceptions that members can share like weddings, ""Hey I'm going skydiving anyone been?"", or even a question for the community like suggestions for events.

I agree with the journal entry style posts (although, for the sake of the discussion about future content, that doesn't mean that content will be restricted).

gaybros,3c4ddq,kejosm,17,Sat Jul 4 17:41:37 2015 UTC,I imagine it's because someone at Reddit got fired and some other stuff happened and some people did some stuff and subreddits ended up private.
gaybros,3c4ddq,neilalexanderr,8,Sat Jul 4 17:46:32 2015 UTC,"As a long-time-but-now-ex MetaRedditor, you're skipping over literally years of managerial fuckups on the part of Reddit's owners and managers, culminating in the backdoor installation of the current ""interim"" CEO. Firing Victoria - which despite what someone below says, did in fact happen - was simply the tipping point for long held frustrations on the part of subreddit mods. If you understand that the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand was the event that started World War I but that the War was not about his death, then you understand what might be happening here..."
gaybros,3c4ddq,MadeWithaMac,2,Sat Jul 4 19:25:07 2015 UTC,Interesting. I've been hearing bits & pieces about that mess but did not think that subreddit would be affected. Especially since this one isn't.
gaybros,3c4ddq,wolf2600,4,Sat Jul 4 17:50:00 2015 UTC,"It's up to the moderators of each sub to decide whether to jump on the bandwagon.  Personally, I think it's stupid:  Management wanted an employee to change the format of AMAs, she refused, she got fired, and they'll end up bringing in someone who will run AMAs according to management's wishes."
gaybros,3c4ddq,jwax33,6,Sat Jul 4 17:59:29 2015 UTC,"Aside from the firing of Victoria, there's a lot of resentment and frustration over Reddit's lack of appreciation for the work thousands of volunteer mods do, and the piss poor tools it provides to manage subreddits with.  I don't think Reddit's software has been updated since it went live...who knows what all the HQ folks do.  It's not introducing new features or fixing things like search which has been horribly broken for years."
gaybros,3c4ddq,SmarmySalamander,4,Sat Jul 4 18:55:56 2015 UTC,"People keep saying that but no one has confirmed, from reddit hq or from Victoria. This is still hearsay."
gaybros,3c4ddq,wolf2600,6,Sat Jul 4 18:20:04 2015 UTC,"I understand, but getting bent out of shape (and setting subs to 'private') over a business firing an employee without knowing the reason behind it is also overreacting.  And being that it's an HR action by a business, it's really none of the users' concern over the circumstances."
gaybros,3c4ddq,Oshi105,2,Sat Jul 4 20:30:59 2015 UTC,"If that was all sure. However as clearly stated by many moderators the Victoria situation was more straw that broke the camels back. the incompetent behavior of admins, lack of communication and bad support in general for the community of people essentially running reddit on a day to day basis is why they did it. In context firing Victoria without ANY warning/attempts to accomdate/hell even 2 seconds of thought to oh this will probably fuck over a lot of people whatsoever completely derailed the running of one of the most popular subreddits."
gaybros,3c4ddq,wolf2600,4,Sat Jul 4 21:13:33 2015 UTC,"I dunno.... redditors are, by definition, drama-queens.  They look for any possible reason to be ""outraged"" and ""protest"".  Just a way to convince themselves that they're important/influential, I guess.   In context firing Victoria without ANY warning/attempts to accomdate/hell even 2 seconds of thought to oh this will probably fuck over a lot of people   I'd say that it was a business decision (if the rumors are to be believed).  When you work for a company and they tell you to do something (if it's legal), then you don't refuse to do it.   As for warnings/2nd chances/etc..... that's not the way business works.   If you refuse to do as your told, you're gone."
gaybros,3c4ddq,Oshi105,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:21:42 2015 UTC,Except then it means that the business made a shitty decision. In fact it a  made a decision that would in context seem to have been designed to piss of the base on which Reddit makes it's money. Firing someone is one thing but creating an environment in which the cow that gives you milk is no longer going to be fed? I'm not speaking clearly about it as I am not that eloquent. It was  a bad decision and the shutdowns reflect it. It's as if they treated the firing like letting go of someone from a barista position. Reddits business model depends on mods/end users. By ignoring this and following through with the firing without warning they are showing a deliberate choice to ignore this fact.

He also banned fapday Friday saying it made it awkward for him to explain that event to people like his grandma. When people tried having discussions about it he removed the threads and brought out the ban hammer. He also used it on anybody who tried to post FDF stuff.

gaybros,3c1rbx,timetide,0,Sat Jul 4 06:28:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Yeah it's unfortunate that someone got fired, but there are probably legal reasons as to why the admins can't actually explain the termination. It could have been handled, better, but over all shit happens.  It was a complete and utter hissy fit and gaybros wanted to be the cool kids and fit in."
gaybros,3c1rbx,Conflux,3,Sat Jul 4 13:19:08 2015 UTC,"I only wish the mods of r/gaybros had at least consulted the userbase before deciding to go private. Many other subs held discussion threads for a couple hours to see what the users' thought about participating in the blackout, and if there was a general consensus among users the mods would go with that. I don't think something like that would've been too hard to set up. And besides, the whole protest was about accountability, transparency, and engaging with the community."
gaybros,3c1rbx,ThatBernie,0,Sat Jul 4 14:40:54 2015 UTC,It wasn't just gaybros mods. Here's an explanation: https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/
gaybros,3c1rbx,honest_arbiter,5,Sat Jul 4 03:08:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you, this means more than you probably realize.   To those who are curious: we decided to join the protest because we have experienced some major issues with administration as well. There was an incident we didn't publicize where moderators here were having their real-life jobs threatened, family stalked, and continued and very elaborate harassment. One of them even registered the domain names of my real-life name to make websites about how terrible Gaybros is, and used hidden links to try to link my name's Google results to porn.   The admins response to this? First: silence. When finally called out on Twitter weeks later? ""We're sorry, wish we could help.""  Yet when a mod was being attacked in this same manner and used another account to vote on their own submission? Shadowbanned within hours. So they can respond if you manipulate a comment score by a few points, but not if you're actually being harassed in real life.   That all being said, creating and moderating Gaybros has been a highlight of my adult life, and has helped me in so many ways to grow up and learn about community dynamics, all while meeting lifelong friends and having once in a lifetime experiences. If anything, the thick skin you develop from moderating a semi-popular subreddit can be useful in so many aspects of life. I wouldn't change it for the world.   Again, thanks for your kind words and thanks for participating here."
gaybros,3c1rbx,rainbow_worrier,3,Sat Jul 4 15:38:13 2015 UTC,What do you think the admins could have done regarding your issues? This isn't a criticism I just have no idea what tools are available to combat that kind of attack.  I hope the admins start engaging with you more from now on and deliver the tools they promised.

The Way He Looks portrays the ""finding your identity"" story in a more realistic way (and more complex than the typical hollywood coming out story) that would really resonate with a wide audience."

The storyline with the cheating boyfriend who basically made his boyfriend sit back and watch while he tried to have both at the same time made me really mad while also hitting me really hard.

Secondly, I was just wondering why Hugo was in a relationship with Andrés if he was complaining that he was acting too feminine. They were shown to have been together for quite some time, so why did Hugo get into the relationship in the first place? Is it just the movie's cliché approach to showing a couple going through an obstacle in their relationship or can this actually happen?"

gaybros,3bwjoe,GabrielGray,7,Thu Jul 2 20:13:50 2015 UTC,I just started season 4 today. It's a teen show but most of the characters are fun (especially Stiles and Lydia). The first season was my least favourite due to the Scott / Allison stuff which I thought was super annoying. Scott is kinda boring to me. Allison got a lot better in season 3 though. Anyway there's a lot of eye candy and the stories are enjoyable.
gaybros,3bwjoe,Adjjmrbc0136,3,Thu Jul 2 19:33:44 2015 UTC,"I actually haven't seen season 4. I skipped right to season five. I definitely don't think it's a quality show by any means, I've just gotten hooked. Allison dying almost made me stop watching, but I absolutely love Stiles as a character.  And you can't forget the eye candy. Always been a fan of the Carver twins."

gaybros,3bw1zh,1gaybro,6,Sat Jul 4 03:23:27 2015 UTC,"Oh you are young and innocent. This 8-ep series is based on a movie called Wet Hot American Summer. It came out in 2001. It took place in 1981 in a summer camp at Maine, and it chronicles the events that take place on the last day of camp as everything comes to a close. Here is the trailer. What made it a cult hit was that it was ridiculous. It took a lot of tropes about summer camp and just went into left field with all of them, which was refreshing and hysterical. It also crammed a lot into one movie as multiple characters try to accomplish goals before the summer ends, and it all fit together very well. You had like Dungeons & Dragon fans saving the camp from space debris, a guy coming to terms with his relationship with a talking can of vegetables, sexual tension between two male counselors, wanton child endangerment..... and the weird thing is that it worked. Lots of amazing quotes in that movie.    The other reason it became kind of a cult hit was because of the cast. It had a great line-up and many names in that movie went on to have even bigger careers. It helped launch Paul Rudd's career, and Christopher Meloni soon became known for his work in Law & Order SVU. Not to mention Molly Shannon, David Hyde Pierce, Jeannine Garaffalo, etc.       It was a stupid fun movie you didn't watch with your parents. But then, Netflix made a TV series out of this. Statistically this was very unlikely to happen. But then they just upped the game and got like all of the original actors, which is VERY hard due to previous commitments and emotions about old work. It's like damn near impossible. This is like seeing a freaking unicorn. Then they just went and added even MORE amazing faces and everyone's kind of freaking out because it looks amazing. Now we're gonna find out what actually happened during camp."

Seriously though, get a hobby. Not a pastime; a hobby. Pastimes are just largely solitary ways of consuming which entertains and lets you pass the time. Netflix and the gym are not hobbies, they're pastimes.  Hobbies involve doing something expansive - something which involves going beyond the borders of mere consumption and into engagement. Reading is a pastime, joining a book club and analysing and discussing what you've read is a hobby. ""The gym"" is just a pastime (strictly it's actually just self-care - like brushing your teeth), though training for something is a hobby.  Why does this distinction matter? Because hobbies necessarily involve speaking to like-minded people. If you're good at your hobby and become known, strangers will seek you out for advice. It's no way of getting a bf in the first week, though you make friends quickly, and in the end people still mostly meet their LTR partners through mutual friends.  Toronto has dozens of clubs and hobby groups - sports, games, interests, causes... just think about what you're good at or want to get better at (self-mprovement, teaching, and learning are also part of a good hobby) then see if there's a gay version of that. If not, don't sweat it, just get involved in a pleb version and trust in the power of mutual friends."

I always had fun making friends on my smoke breaks at work. I would caution against getting too friendly with your new  coworkers though, especially if you're going into the service industry. It can get very incestuous if you know what I mean? It really depends on what you're into I guess. After living in Tokyo for the past 4 years I'm so excited to finally be able to blaze. There's loads of pot lounges in Toronto and I was DELIGHTED to discover that some of them even have board game and video game tournaments. I'm all about that. I would say to just keep positive and think of it all as fun. Every time I've been through it, I just say to myself ""this is going to be a really great chapter in my memoir. The readership's gonna love it."""

I started an internship right away and taking improv classes and both have been major sources for making plans and doing stuff with people. Moving flicked a switch in me that makes starting conversations with people so much easier because its a necessity. It's still pretty lonely being somewhere new, but each week is a little easier.  Also, I keep finding people I know from the past are here, either people i went to high school with or college or a summer program. It's been awesome reaching out to them to hang out and meet people.  And finally, Tinder haha. I've been on a few dates and we actually ended as friends. Tonight I'm going out with a guy it didn't work out with and I'll be meeting his friends and just getting to know new people. Don't underestimate friends-of-friends!"

Okay, so I interned here the past two years, and lived here last summer, and I have some friends here, but they're not always around and it's good to branch out. Anyway, I recommend meetup.com. I've found a lot of groups through them, and while I haven't made permanent friends that way, it's still nice to have a monthly group of people to hang out with and talk about atheism or Perl programming. :)  It's not the most social, but if you have a laptop and can sit and do work in a coffee shop, I've found it's a great way to feel like you're somewhat out being social without necessarily talking to anyone. If you can strike up a conversation, great, but sometimes just being out and about, even if you're not talking to someone, can make you feel more like you fit in."

He even did his A-levels on a fast track while being an international athlete and won his bronze medal within a year after his fathers death. Brittain also played him out as THE posterboy of the 2012 olympics and he still kept his cool. He looks absolutly gorgeous but is actually very modest about it. In one interview they asked him to rate his own body and he got really uncomfortable and tried to refuse. They pushed on and he rated himself a 6 out of 10. Even with all his money and fame, it's still his aunt who cuts his hair.  Sometimes I feel like he didn't really want to be a celebrity but that people fell for him so hard, he just went along and made the best of it. He got third place in the British championship when he was 12. Second place when he was 13. He was 14 when he actually won the British championship on the 10m, both solo and syncro and suddenly everybody in Britain knew who he was. He was 15 when he won the world championship and suddenly the entire world started to pay attention."

We decided to meet at a public place first.. and I pull up and see the car he said he'd be driving. He gets out and gets in my car.   He'd sent me a pic of a guy in his 30's. But he was actually in his 60's and looked nothing like the guy in the picture. The worst part was during the brief 2 mins of conversation.. I look down and see some type of bugs crawling on his arm. I honestly believe it was fleas.   I politely told him that I wasn't comfortable doing it and I left. I decided never again to meet a guy offline like that again.   FLEAS!!!

gaybros,3btdnd,superboy7787,8,Thu Jul 2 00:05:48 2015 UTC,"It's not that easy. Some people should really never have children. As a social worker I know some people who had very bad reason for wanting children. Let me give you a real life example. This is even from when I was a teenager and part of why I became a social worker. It still somewhat haunts me after almost ten years. Don't read on if you doubt you can take it.  I worked for seven years on a municipal summer day care, for children until they were about 14 at the oldest. There was a family of three children whose parents had died a year before I started. They got adopted by the neighbors, who had been good friends with the now deceased parents and also knew the children very well. Years pass and we notice more and more problems with those three children. We thought it was because they were orphans. That's probably what everybody around them thought. The youngest one had some kind of obsession with elephants since he was two. Somedays he was very happy. When you asked about it, he was happy because he could play 'elephant' with his adoptive father. We thought it was just a game. It wasn't.   Eventually it all came out. The man who adopted those three children had done so with the very clear intention of sexually abusing them. His wife had agreed to it and helped cover it up out of fear that her husband would otherwise go after their own two children. It went horribly far and went on for years.   That man should never have had children. That's where I draw the line. If people have children with the intent of loving them, taking care of them, then nothing should prevent them from having children. If the intent is to abuse children, they never should have them.  But there isn't a way of vetting people about their real intentions, especially if they have learned from a young age to hide them."

Even in comics, male superheros don't really have overdeveloped legs and ass. They have cuts in their legs, but they don't have mass.

Equal marriage was a huge win, but people can still be fired, refused to be hired, be refused service, be rejected from a housing purchase, and a lot of other forms of discrimination for simply being attracted to the same gender. Although businesses that try to pull these stunts typically don't fare well, there still needs to be a push for federal recognition of sexual orientation as a protected class (assuming the states don't do it all by themselves). It's completely unacceptable that this blatant discrimination is still legal.   The fight isn't over; at least not yet."

gaybros,3br4a4,snowace56,69,Wed Jul 1 13:57:26 2015 UTC,"I think you hit the nail on the head with either she'll come around or she won't. It really depends on the type of woman your mom is. I mean, even if she never fully accepts it, she should love you and want to be in your life. However, it seems too many parents are so fanatical that it makes them bad parents and they're totally ready to just cut out their children. Either way, you'll be fine dude. If she comes around, great, if not, you didn't need the negativity anyway.   My mom was super religious when i came out and asked me everything from do i want to be a woman to was i molested...yeahh... But, at the end of the day she loved me and wasn't willing to let ""it's always been this way"" ruin our relationship. It also helped that my parents are divorced and my dad and stepmom (and siblings) were 100% supportive so my mom basically knew she had to shape up or ship out. I'm happy to say, we're better than ever. I married my husband May 30th 2015 and when i danced with my mom she whispered ""I'm so sorry for how I acted when you came out. I couldn't love you more and I'm so proud of you""  tl;dr It'll get better with your mom or it won't. What's important is that YOU are ok, you deserve love, and you already seem fully capable of finding people who love and support you unconditionally"
gaybros,3br4a4,jrdnhrd,28,Wed Jul 1 14:33:20 2015 UTC,This made me cry. You have no idea. I really hope she comes around and I get to hear those words. Her words were filled which such hate and shame. She made me feel worse than I ever have before about my sexuality.
gaybros,3br4a4,jrdnhrd,26,Wed Jul 1 14:52:08 2015 UTC,"Don't sweat it right now. Sometimes people say things because they're angry or shocked or whatever. My stepdad said to me ""I don't care what you say, it's not right"" about 4 years ago. Sunday my husband and i brought him his Father's Day presents. People change sometimes. Sometimes they don't and that's just an indication that you have to change and cut them out of your life. I mean, your mom can stop being a bigot, you can't stop being gay. The sooner she learns that, the sooner she'll come around. And if she doesn't, you have your man, your friends, and us. Here's a RuPaul quote that I live by and I mean it to you right now ""We love you, you are so welcomed here. You know we as gay people we get to choose our family. We get to choose the people we’re around. I am your family, we are family here. I love you."""
gaybros,3br4a4,jrdnhrd,20,Wed Jul 1 15:20:06 2015 UTC,Before I left I told her that I loved her and that she will have to work through a lot of feelings. I told her how she wants to handle this moving forward is her choice. She can disown me or she can embrace the situation and be a family. I said I wouldn't permit her treating my boyfriend with any disrespect. I felt that's all I could really say as I left.
gaybros,3br4a4,jumperbro,8,Wed Jul 1 15:31:43 2015 UTC,"I think that was probably wise and mature. When i first started dating my husband, I had the following conversation with my mom (who was still working through issues) Mom: Come see us Me: OK we'll come down sunday Mom: Ugh is it so wrong that i want to see JUST my son? Me: ......  So, mostly to teach her a lesson, I dropped my now husband off at my dads house (where he road ATVs and looked at embarrassing baby photos of me) and went to my moms, the whole time being really bothered to be there (immature i know, but it worked). When I went to leave after about 2 hours, she asked why and i told her that my bf was with my dad, stepmom, and brother and I'd much rather be with people who wanted to get to know him. After that, she was more than willing to get to know them :D It sounds awful, but parents spend the first part of your life taking care of you and basically keeping you alive. After your an adult, however, you don't NEED your parents so much as you want them. When parents realize that you can survive and thrive without them e.g. you won't be celibate or unhappy just to see them, they come around"
gaybros,3br4a4,jrdnhrd,8,Wed Jul 1 15:56:08 2015 UTC,"My bf was confused by the whole thing because I was upset but he couldn't put his finger on it. Because I haven't needed my mom. I haven't needed her for a long time. It was the fact that I face the reality that she might shun me. I've been the ""golden child"", the rock in the family, and done no wrong. My sister was always the fuck up. I want my mom in my life and to love me for who I was. It was that rejection that hurt. If she doesn't come around that's her loss.   All day friends and family have been texting me. Today has been the hardest and one of the best days of my life. I'm not going to let her bring me down. I'm only surrounding myself around positive people."
gaybros,3br4a4,TuxGamer,3,Wed Jul 1 19:45:12 2015 UTC,"Hey bro, I totally feel you here, except now I'm worried about coming out to my grandparents. Luckily coming out to my mom went way better than it did with my sister (probably because I am the rock star child), but the first thing my mom said to me (after the usual awkward questions from mom) was that I should probably not tell my grandparents because they're hard core Baptists and they did shun my sister. It's a tough struggle, but I'm proud of you for having the balls to tell your mom in person. You've got a lot of courage. You also are willing to give her time which is awesome too, and I think that's the best thing to do is just give her time. Now that you don't have to stress about telling her, take the time to get to know your man better. But keep sending her love, it's the mature thing to do."
gaybros,3br4a4,jrdnhrd,3,Thu Jul 2 02:32:07 2015 UTC,Yea my boyfriend's grandmother is the same way. She's 90 and coffin shopping as we speak.

If your son told you he were gay, and you never thought about this topic or learned to know such people, who would you react?  You've done it right, don't let an temporarily angry or sad mom make you unhappy. Give it some time, give her a week or something and you will see her progress"
gaybros,3br4a4,majeric,5,Wed Jul 1 20:10:15 2015 UTC,"The whole ""gays shouldn't be parents"" comment hurt worse than anything else.  It captured her hatred and stance vividly.    In her shoes, I've always been more open even before I realized i was gay.  The best example is my aunt and uncle have an open marriage.  It's weird because I would never want that, but i never judged them. I loved them the same and our relationship never changed.  That's really all I wanted.  I very much want the traditional family in a sense of having a spouse with kids.  The only thing that has really changed is that my spouse is a man and somehow we will have kids.  Until you have been in those shoes every generates a position.  Now my mom is being forced to get outside in the world and experience a new point of view. I know she has the capacity to learn/grow...its her choice to do so."

I've gotten my parents to the ""lets just not talk about it"" stage but I am 100% sure if I ever had a wedding I wouldn't invite them lest they die of shame. It's hard, but that's life I guess."
gaybros,3br4a4,majeric,5,Wed Jul 1 17:02:32 2015 UTC,"It's a very real possibility. It's sad that my mom would turn on her own son because some book written 2000 years ago told her to. Ironically, her shunning me would be a punishment with an equal punishment to mine as defined in the book."
gaybros,3br4a4,thelowcrows,5,Wed Jul 1 17:40:27 2015 UTC,"The book didn't tell her to. A subconscious knee-jerk reaction born of a culture of misunderstanding about what it means to be gay is what told her to. She's just using the book as an inaccurate rationalization.

Be your own man and she'll come around. Or not--but that's her issue, not yours."
gaybros,3br4a4,bostonrxist,18,Wed Jul 1 18:12:45 2015 UTC,"I can honestly tell you my now husbands father took it similarly when he found out his son and I were more than ""friends"". The rest of his family and friends we're OK with it. The initial moment was hectic and harsh words were exchanged by both sides.  Like yourself, we left, and stayed with friends that night. It was even more hectic for us because I'm in the military and scheduled to deploy within a month, and now boyfriend had nowhere to live. We talked about him staying with friends short term, and though many people said I was crazy for it, I decided to rent am apartment for him while I was gone. Many of my friends didn't agree with this because we had only been together a couple months at this point, and we all know how quickly a relationship can go south. However, I felt partially responsible for the current predicament so went ahead with it.  Thankfully it turned out for the better. Eventually his father came around and while he never fully supported us, he accepted it. He even became friendly towards me and took me bike riding with him a few times.   In the end,  regardless of your mothers opinion you just have to live your life for yourself. Hopefully she will come around, but don't sweat it waiting for her to. Life is to short to live by the standards of others. Just know your not alone, and if nothing else your story can inspire others. Keep that pretty little head up and find your joy in life. You will always have support here."

Some people are just ignorant and learn to open up and stop being so fearful after a while. My hope for you is that she'll be the second type of conservative Christian.   Just, whatever you do, please, please, please don't stop being you. Don't do anything she says. There's nothing wrong with you. What's wrong is society. What's wrong is people telling each other what's right and what's not. ""An' if it harm none, do as ye will"" - being gay, you aren't hurting anyone. (Well, maybe your partner when you're banging his hole, but he'll get used to it.) Don't let anyone put shame or guilt in you for being you. That's all I ask of you.  Most of all, remember this - it is what it is. There is nothing you can do to change the way your mother is. All you can do is be you. She'll either adjust and become more open-minded or she'll continue to be a fearful pathetic person and ruin any chance at having a healthy relationship with her son.

I tried for years to rebuild what we had after I came out to her numerous times, was the good boy in church till 18, obviously left the church and now a confident gay man who's about to turn 27. I even support her financially (we're immigrants and us siblings take turns, it's my turn at the moment).   To much avail, she still thinks I'm in a phase. This helped me put it all into perspective:  ""Sometimes holding on does more damage than letting go"".  Do yourself a favor OP and let go. Focus on your family and who you want to include in that circle. Enjoy your partner and your lives together. If she wants no part in it, then I'd just cut her off."

I think many parents react in shock, some more elegantly and some have to grieve for a bit, as they ""come out"" of their ideas and dreams of what we will be,, just like we all had to.  Admittedly, we take a few years to get used to the idea that we are ourselves gay, so it makes a little sense that our parents take time to refocus their expectations as well.  the important thing is to make sure you and your man are always respected.

If you meant that she went figuratively psycho, I think Dan Savage's advice on this matter is sound: Don't fear your parent's rejection — make your parents fear your rejection.  Let Mom cool off for a bit and collect herself. Then tell her that you will not allow your partner or yourself to be abused or disrespected. Therefore, if she can't treat you and your partner with respect, you will no longer be available to her.  Sorry you have to go through this, man. Good luck."

Sorry man, unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. No matter what you do, there is always going to be a risk of someone finding out, however, I understand the want to be more discrete while you figure things out.  Your best bet will be a clothed body/headless picture shot. And then have some locked photos. If you're interested in someone, unlock your photos and wow them with your face or dick or whatever.  The part you need to get over though...is going to be understanding that once you step into the ""hookup"" ring, there will always be a chance for exposure. There really just isn't a way around that.

gaybros,3bt57a,i_respondWith_a_song,7,Wed Jul 1 22:55:18 2015 UTC,"Almost everything is in Capital Hill. Some stuff is off the hill, but the big bars are all on Capital Hill.  R-place – This is a drag bar/dance club. The best drag talent in the city is here (imo). Drinks are strong, $12 cover for the drag show and dance floor. They usually play top 40/edm stuff. This is my favorite bar to got, as I always have a good time.  The Cuff – Seattle’s premiere leather bar. It apparently used to be more lude, but the owners changed. I haven’t had a lot of fun there in a while because there have been an influx of straight people going and kind of killing the vibe. Music is a nice mix of everything, I always tend to end up when they have some unknown untalented DJ there. $5-$10 cover depending on the event.  Diesel – Seattle’s bear bar. You see a lot of the same clientele here as you would in The Cuff. Drinks are cheap and strong (if you make out with some of the bartenders). Lots of porn on the wall, over all always fun, though it can get very crowded.  Madison Pub – It’s a gay sports bar. Pool, darts, sports etc. Average drinks, no cover. I usually either wind down, or wind up at this bar.  Pony – Pony is weird bar. Kind of average, really nice patio, average drinks, always crowded in the summer, empty in the winter. One of the few bars with a glory hole in the bathroom if you’re into that thing.  The Eagle – Not as raunchy as other Eagles, but still out there. Fairly large, they never have good music. Drinks are strong, but fairly priced. They tend to hold a lot of theme parties, Underwear parties, lumberjack night, etc.  Neighbors – No gay guys go here, unless they’re underage. It’s basically been taken over by straight people. Some drag queens still come and preform there, but if you’re a local you don’t go, or need an excuse to go.  Julia’s – Another drag bar, but similar to Neighbors it’s been taken over by straight people. The drag show is good, but it’s not authentic. I think last time I went I was one of 3 gay men, and the rest were straight women.  CC’s – Another bear bar, again fairly cheap with strong drinks. It’s a lot of fun, but ends up being crowded too.  Rebar- Rebar is the newest towards the gay scene, it usually caters more to younger lesbians, but the gay boys have started to take over. I’m not too impressed, because it can take a lot of time to get a drink, but the dance floor is large and they just held Bearacudda there this year.  Purr- It’s kind of overpriced, and I’ve never really enjoyed going there.  If I had to plan a night out with friends, I’d start at Madison pub, go to R-Place or The Cuff and end at Diesel."
gaybros,3bt57a,Conflux,3,Wed Jul 1 23:18:54 2015 UTC,"I've never kissed anyone romantically, and I might be visiting Seattle soon. Which bar will give me the best chance of a first time make-out session? Great rundown BTW."
gaybros,3bt57a,alastairmcreynolds,5,Wed Jul 1 23:50:16 2015 UTC,"R-place or Cuff - but that'll require dancing.  It was pretty easy to make out with the dancer at Pony before, but that was after stuffing a $10 into the sock around his cock.  I don't recommend that as your first..."
gaybros,3bt57a,phanfare,2,Thu Jul 2 02:14:45 2015 UTC,"Hmmm.... If you're into bears, then Diesel.

Do come visit it's a blast of a city!"
gaybros,3bt57a,Conflux,3,Wed Jul 1 23:55:18 2015 UTC,You can avoid the cover at R Place by getting there before nine and getting a stamp.

gaybros,3bt57a,Ax2,5,Thu Jul 2 16:01:17 2015 UTC,"/u/Conflux gave a great summary of all of them, but I want to add my own opinions as a separate post without getting into a reply-war under his comment.  R-place is twinkier, and is also being ""taken over"" like Neighbors has been.  I see huge groups of straight people every time I go.  I go here if I'm with my straight and female friends.  Cuff is the club that I, personally, prefer. The caveat is that I generally like the grungier, more dive-y places.  I don't go often, though, cause I don't have gay friends who want to go out enough - and this isn't a place I bring my straight friends  Which brings us to Pony.  This place is the divy-est and I love it for that.  The drinks are strong and cheap, there's vintage porn playing on the TV (at Cuff too) and the walls are plastered in pics of naked men.  The patio is also one of my favorite spots on the hill.  I always start here going out with my gay friends.  And I've never walked in on anyone using the glory-hole...  Purr is okay, its definitely a 'cleaner' crowd.  If you go, go all the way to the back, down the hallway, up the stairs to the cocktail room.  It's a bit toasty up there but I like it more cause its less crowded.  Madison Pub is a bar, nothing special besides that its a gay bar.  I've only been there on a weekday where I was ~20 years younger than the next oldest guy  Neighbors.  Don't go here, just don't.  I made the mistake of going with my girlfriends when I first moved here, had a lot of tequila and one moment of clarity was standing in the corner making out with a guy probably >10 years older than me wearing a vest.  I haven't been to the other's he's listed, but I've heard good things about CCs and Diesel."
gaybros,3bt57a,phanfare,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:11:43 2015 UTC,"I would piggy back off of this.    My old favorite was Lobby, but it closed.  Probably Pony is at the top of my list now.  But I haven't gone out to the gay bars in probably close to a year."
gaybros,3bt57a,alanw8,2,Thu Jul 2 02:56:14 2015 UTC,I really enjoy pony in the fall and winter no one goes out on the patio. Now it's packed cause its summer time.

gaybros,3bt57a,phanfare,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:16:51 2015 UTC,"Gay friends:   Start at Pony (yeah, I'd say its my favorite) then head to Cuff for dancing.  Purr is also an option between Pony and Cuff if its still early (before 11).  Dance until close then go to Hot Mamas for pizza, about 5 blocks west of Cuff.   Straight friends:   Start at Linda's (this western themed dive bar - though it is a ""straight"" bar, its pretty good).  Go dancing at R-place til close.  Get Hot Mama's pizza across the street.  Moral of the story: whatever you end up doing, get Hot Mamas Pizza before you head home.  Its on Pine and Boylston"

I like a more chill experience where I can play pool with my friends and watch sports though, so it makes sense. I did have a ton of fun in R-place a couple weeks back when we got in before the cover started. Diesel is pretty fun too for a little bit, and their drinks are WICKED strong. Only bar I really don't like that I've been to was Pony. Small, hot, and just a little too intense for me. It was funny, however, seeing my straight friend's reaction when he saw the full blown porno playing on a projector screen."

gaybros,3bsu7d,SunnyWaysInHH,2,Sat Jul 4 04:12:52 2015 UTC,"I think, you don't have a problem.   A lot of guys don't get off by oral, topping or bottoming alone. They still need to stroke their dicks, but nevertheless enjoy all the other activities. We are all different. Some get off easily, some don't. You could try some things, though. Don't watch porn and don't masturbate for two weeks or so. That will make you quite horny and makes it easier to come. Don't stress yourself. If you need stroking, that's totally fine and everybody, who tells you otherwise is a drama queen."

gaybros,3bsu7d,harrisonishere,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:33:47 2015 UTC,"Also try not to over-think it. Because you've been focused on it for so long, it could be psychological, subconsciously ingrained into your sexual routine.   I agree though with much of what's being said, jerk off less and less vigorously, no porn, see what happens.   And as someone said earlier, many medications, specifically SSRIs, painkillers, etc can affect that. But seeing as you get off fine on your own, you're probably just jerking off too much and too rough.   Take a break and see what happens. And try to focus on pleasuring your partner instead of yourself, it takes the pressure off and lets your mind focus on something other than worrying about getting off yourself. Then you might be surprised with the results."

Also if you're traveling alone definitely check hostel.com so you can see each place's rating. They have a review for 'atmosphere' which will tell you how good it is for making friends at the hostel to go out with at night. I found this extremely useful while I was backpacking alone. Good luck and have fun!
gaybros,3bsh6k,cheapandeasy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:33:41 2015 UTC,"Plus Hostel in Berlin is cheap and central.  Nearest S-Bahn station is stairs only, but if you aren't packing for six months, it should be fine.  Curry 61 near Hackescher Markt does the best Currywurst in Berlin (you want it ohne/without).  The Fernsehturm has fantastic views, and you can walk down Unter den Linden from there to Brandenburger Tor, past the Reichstag and to Hauptbahnhof.  It takes an hour or four to do that, and I really enjoyed it.  Tempelhofer Feld (U6/S41/S42) is amazing - a downtown airport turned park.  Lots of little art galleries around.  Look up odd things to do - Berlin has endless weirdness.  Get a 72 hour pass - good on bus, U-Bahn, and S-Bahn and DON'T LOSE IT!  They check tickets a lot and can be sneaky about it.  Burgers at Burgermeister under the U12 between Waraschauer Platz and Hallesches Tor is great.  Lunch from the 20th floor cafe at the Technisches Uni (Ernst-Reuter Platz on the U12) gives fantastic views.  Blacklight minigolf under Görlizer Park (ignore the people selling drugs.  Some are police, the rest aren't worth being swarmed by the rest).  And you have to visit both the East Side Gallery (between Ostbahnhof and Waraschauer Platz on the S5/S7/S75) and Potsdamer Platz which was an empty meadow during the cold war.    Eat Döner and enjoy the graffiti, grunge, and ads for Dildo King.  :)  You'll love Berlin, it's such a weird wonderful city."

gaybros,3bpw5a,thisisusandme,22,Wed Jul 1 04:55:02 2015 UTC,"My parents want to talk to me tomorrow    I would recommend postponing this indefinitely. Don't sit down with them while you are in a weak position.  You've got your head together. This is a speed bump in your life. It's left you disoriented, but you will recover. And it's time to build a life where you don't need your parents for anything. Because they might or might not be there for you, and they might or might not attach conditions.   Here is why you leave: your father is abusive. I'm sure you love him, but lots of battered women love their husbands, and that doesn't mean it's OK or a good idea for them to go home.  You can have them in your life eventually, on your own terms. You will have a family again. It will be the one you build for yourself."
gaybros,3bpw5a,someone_like_me,3,Wed Jul 1 06:56:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. It doesn't sound like your parents place is a safe place for you to go home. Focus first on figuring out your basic needs first, then, only when you are 100% comfortable and in a good place, see if your parents will still sit down and talk."
gaybros,3bpw5a,econstud,9,Wed Jul 1 12:10:17 2015 UTC,"You may have to find a place to live and a new job that are close to school.  It is going to be tough to swing a car, insurance, gas, and your other basic support needs.  You need to identify ways to keep your expenses to a bare minimum.  Also, be prepared to support yourself alone.  It's hard to rely on boyfriends at your age.  Just don't get into a position financially where your world collapses if you find yourself single for some reason."
gaybros,3bpw5a,jwax33,3,Wed Jul 1 05:15:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. I don't know your relationship but when I was in college I ended up relying on my partner for a lot of these types of things. He eventually ended up holding it over me as part of his emotional manipulation. I got pretty messed up from that, and I refuse to let myself ever get in that position again.  But I know how hard it is when you are where you are right now. Cars are really expensive--look at ALL possible options, including finding a different job that would make public transportation a more viable option.  If you do meet your parents, go into it being ready to be calm and collected. Never let your own voice raise up. Anytime someone in an argument starts going off with ""You did this, you did that"" the conversation will devolve, so avoid it. Go into it having objective things you want to accomplish from the conversation--communicate those at the beginning. These will help you keep the conversation grounded and not so emotionally volatile. Finally, try your best to demonstrate to your parents you understand their point of view. You may not like it, but stopping a conversation and saying, ""What I understand you are trying to say is..."" shows empathy and maturity, even if you don't like/agree with that that is. There is a chance some of the bad feelings between you and your dad are a result of not completely understanding each other.  Good luck, keep your head up!"
gaybros,3bpw5a,mynameis_wat,3,Wed Jul 1 09:33:51 2015 UTC,"Cars are really expensive--look at ALL possible options, including finding a different job that would make public transportation a more viable option.   Or bicycling or walking. Public transit can be pretty awful in some areas, but if you add in a bike to fill in the gaps (or serve as a backup) they can be come useful. Just don't buy a cheap crappy bike, go to a real bike shop and put down good money to get kitted out properly so the bike is comfortable to ride, meets any cargo needs, can be secured, and is safe. Those cheap bikes you get pre-built in big box stores are usually assembled by someone who gets paid by the number of bikes they assemble, and thus have a higher likelihood of literally falling apart on you as you're riding it."
gaybros,3bpw5a,Kichigai,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:32:31 2015 UTC,Yes! I guess I consider my bike part of the public transit system--things mesh pretty well here in Minneapolis. Though not everyone thinks so!  I totally agree on the value of a great bike! I found mine used and saved a bunch but the frame is a dream.
gaybros,3bpw5a,mynameis_wat,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:56:52 2015 UTC,"Ahh, another Minnesotan! I'm actually out in the south 'burbs, but I work in Minneapolis. Using a bike cuts my bus commute down from 90 minutes to like 75.  I got my road bike from a neighbor. The thing was in his garage for 20 years and I had to put a good chunk of money into repairing it. Before I had only ridden cheap ass mountain bikes, and one heavily customized mountain bike. Oh man, night and day between those experiences. Before I'd be totally winded having done 30 minutes at full tilt, but on that sucker I could average 15MPH the whole time and still be ready for more. Even Nice Rides are better road bikes than cheap mountain bikes, and they only have three speeds, weigh like 40-45 lbs and catch the wind like a sail!"
gaybros,3bpw5a,Kichigai,7,Wed Jul 1 21:13:39 2015 UTC,"sadly I don't feel obligated to love my family   And honestly, that's ok. You know the phrase ""blood is thicker than water?"" The original phrase is actually ""the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb"" meaning that bonds of friendship and loyalty are stronger than familial bonds. You are born into your family but you choose your friends. And your boyfriend. By all means try to work it out with your parents. But give priority to those who don't make you work for their love.   Please be careful with your meeting if you choose to go. Maybe choose a public place like a park or something? Nothing wrong with trying to work it out but just be safe. And try to have some responses ready. Keep calm without going on the offensive."
gaybros,3bpw5a,nightpanda893,6,Wed Jul 1 05:56:59 2015 UTC,"Buddy, the biggest challenge you face is overcoming the years of emotional abuse you have faced. The particulars of your situation are tough but completely manageable--becoming more independent, find transportation, etc. But the hard work is changing your mental attitude. Unless I'm missing something from your original post, your dad blew up because you went to a gay club. And in this post it almost sounds like you're saying you deserve your dad's wrath for going to a club, like you agree with him for getting angry. If you were straight, this would not be an issue. So your first step has to be the healing process.   Your dad has spent your entire life emotionally manipulating you into thinking that you deserve to be shamed. That's fucking sick.  When you can accept that your dad does not love you and that you will be much better off without him (and probably your mom too) in your life, then you'll be able to start loving yourself."
gaybros,3bpw5a,JMCrown,3,Wed Jul 1 08:09:56 2015 UTC,"I've been my father's disappointment for a very long time,   I'm not disappointed in you.  You're currently attending community college for free, and working hard.  You're doing well for yourself at 19, and it's your right to move out on your own.  It sounds like you've got a good head on your shoulders, and you'd be ready for it were not for the finances.    I think your best bet for housing would be to see if you can find any roommates.  The more you find, the cheaper it may be.  If you've filled out a FAFSA, you can ask your school to recalculate aid based on your new housing situation.  Maybe you're eligible for more grants, or maybe you need a small loan.  But your aid should change based on the fact that you're not living at home anymore.  You can also save money on transportation with a bike.  I actually learned how to ride a bike just to save money on my commute.  Maybe you don't want to ride the entire way for whatever reason, so you take the bus part way, put the bike on front, and then ditch the bus when it's no longer reliable.  You can also string together side streets sometimes to avoid major thoroughfares, or ride only outside of rush hour.  Also reconsider your budget for food, and buy groceries where you can.  And if you're job isn't cutting it, maybe you can look for something else.    However you choose to handle this, I think you can do it.  I can just tell from the way you write that you're not going to end up living on the street, maybe on a couch for a while, but you sound like a smart guy, and will be able to figure out what you need to do."
gaybros,3bpw5a,planification,5,Thu Jul 2 00:36:31 2015 UTC,"I may sound crazy here, but I feel like your dad honestly loves you deep down....or at least he's frustrated because he can't find a way to reconcile  what you've done and who you are with how much he loves you......I don't feel like he totally hates you 100%. He's trying even though the way he channels his frustration is through threats and manipulation. If he really hated your guts, he'd kick you out and completely disown you, but he's not.  I think you're right about sitting down and having a civil conversation, a heart-to-heart, truthful communication, etc.   Tell him how you feel, acknowledge that you know he sees u as a disappointment but u still love him, tell him how u would like to not move away from the house but because of his threats and raging, you don't feel secure in your very own home and it's making you migrate for your own safety. Apologize for whatever u've done; i can sense that whatever u did was a grave mistake but I can't fully gauge how severe your consequences may be and what your dad is going through if i don't know what you did or what places exactly u went to that made him so mad."
gaybros,3bpw5a,FIESTYgummyBEAR,3,Wed Jul 1 06:01:39 2015 UTC,I agree with that. He would have just kicked OP out if he hated his guts.  He hates that he lied and he hates OPs boyfriend. Doesn't sound like he totally hates that OP is gay.
gaybros,3bpw5a,chinchillin88,2,Wed Jul 1 07:05:32 2015 UTC,"(taken from 1st post by OP)   He threatened to kick my ass and kill my boyfriend.  He gave me an ultimatum that I have to choose between my boyfriend and my family... ""A little fucking faggot who has his gay boyfriend do everything for him"" ""A worthless lying piece of shit"" ""A little pussy"" etc. etc...   That sounds a lot more than hate to me.  As a parent myself this is the worst way to go about solving a problem with an older child, especially a 19 yr old.  Screaming, yelling, and threatening are not going to help and will only make the situation worse.  Yeah he messed up, but to me this sounds like a parent who was already disappointed in their child and this seems to have sent him over the edge.  Its not right.  If his Dad was trying he'd have dialed back his anger and comments.  My oldest did some really dumb shit recently and I screamed and yelled at him.  Even got upset enough to tell him to grab his sparring equipment and lets settle this now.  All bad moves on my part.  This is a kid who can drive, he could have gotten into his car and left never coming back because I raged at him.  But after I calmed down and my husband had a heart to heart with me I realized my fuck up in handling this.  Since that incident I've worked at keeping my cool when my kids royally fuck ups and it has worked out for the better.  OP is 19, the dad has to speak to him in a way that OP doesn't feel threatened or else nothing will be solved.  Older kids will respond much, much better if you talk to them without berating them like some bully.  I'm not going to dispute that Dad loves OP, but I think OP is total justified in not wanting to go home or talk to Dad until he calms down a lot."
gaybros,3bpw5a,Whitedragon2,2,Wed Jul 1 16:56:20 2015 UTC,"Don't disagree with you. I previously wrote in that post that OP should leave.  I just don't think OPs Dad hates him completely just because he's gay. I think this is still a knee-jerk reaction just like you had your knee-jerk reaction with your own child.  In addition, I think someone with pure hatred for their child wouldn't give OP ultimatums. There would be one singular decision, which would be to leave. This is why I'm questioning the dad's ""hatred"" for just child-like buffoonery."
gaybros,3bpw5a,chinchillin88,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:01:19 2015 UTC,"My bad, I probably came off a bit too passionate in my post.  I just saw too much of a similarity to my issue with my son, but where as I learned from my mistake this Dad doesn't seem to.  I was bothered that even after the bully like comments and threats by the father that he hasn't seemed to cool off to have an adult conversation with his son.  I feel like that gives the impression to the son that he is hated by the Dad.  Even if Dad does love his son deep down, he sure is making his son feel hated and afraid which touches a nerve in me.  Could be a melting pot of son lied to him a lot, is gay, is dating an older guy, and perhaps other matters we are not aware of.  Too much for Dad to handle and BOOM, he blows up and just keeps burning.  As a parent though you have to cool off and come back to the matter more mature so the relationship between father & son can be mended, somehow.  I hope OP gets through this and comes out better for it, along with Dad too."

gaybros,3bolt4,ClinkyDink,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:56:50 2015 UTC,We are combining the American (mine) tradition of matching surnames and the Brazilian (his) of just adding surnames together.   He has two surnames so let's say I'm X and he's Y Z. Our new last name will be Y Z X.   Apparently surnames in Brazil sometimes get up to five names long.

gaybros,3bolt4,Epithemus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:56:38 2015 UTC,"My fiance and I have talked a bit about this. He likes his last name, although it is very, very generic. My last name is Portuguese and gets confused for Spanish all the time. We've basically talked about hyphenating it. I was ok at the time, but I've been researching family history, and I'm lucky if I have a quarter Portuguese in me. My dad is also a super religious asshole, so I don't really feel all that connected to my name anymore. I have tons of male siblings, so I'm not worry about the name disappearing, either.  So, as of right now, I'm actually starting to favor taking my fiance's super generic name, because I'm at least half, if not more, English-Irish, and I'm a British Traditionalist Wicca, so I just feel more of a connection with my Briton side, and his English name.    I may end up picking a brand new name with him, or something. I'm not entirely sure. All I know is I was for hyphenating, but now I really dislike my last name."

gaybros,3boghf,lemartineau,27,Tue Jun 30 21:17:57 2015 UTC,I've technically been in an open relationship for five years but neither of us have ever had sex with anybody else. We suck.
gaybros,3boghf,TygerPanzy,25,Tue Jun 30 21:32:24 2015 UTC,"Been together for ten years. Our relationship is best described as not strictly monogamous. To use wording from Dan Savage, our relationship isn't open, but the door is unlocked, and we can open that door together just a crack from time to time as a kind of pressure release valve. I have the best sex with my husband, but there's an element of excitement we can't give each other by the very nature of our familiarity, and that's the excitement of strange ass. There's no substitute for the exhilaration of having someone new shove their hand down the front of your pants the first time. And why deprive yourselves of that occasional thrill so long as everyone feels secure and confident?"
gaybros,3boghf,Anconia80,15,Tue Jun 30 22:07:34 2015 UTC,Intellectually I understand this and think it would be great.  Emotionally I'd be devastated if my partner went outside the relationship.  I don't think I could take it.
gaybros,3boghf,jwax33,15,Wed Jul 1 01:21:39 2015 UTC,"My experience is this - monogamy is easy for the first few years, then as your relationship matures and the endorphins die down, it becomes like the most intense and intimate friendship you've even known, and in that security, your emotions can handle the idea of someone else appealing to your partner sexually. You're so close to your partner that all you want to see is their happiness, and it's amazing to watch that sexual intensity in their eyes you haven't seen yourself since the first couple years of your relationship. Their satisfaction from it makes you happy as though you were experiencing it first hand. It's an amazing thing."
gaybros,3boghf,Anconia80,15,Wed Jul 1 01:30:43 2015 UTC,This sounds entirely theoretical.
gaybros,3boghf,habitushabitat,6,Wed Jul 1 02:11:35 2015 UTC,"It's certainly more nuanced and complicated than the principles I noted above, everyone has insecurities, and when people are militant about monogamy, it generally comes from one of two places - religion and/or insecurity. For the religiously based, I feel discussion on the topic is pointless because religion is like intellectual poison that undermines one's ability to have serious discussions. This leaves insecurity, which is just another way of saying that it takes time in a relationship to develop the confidence that the connection with your partner is genuine and durable. Once you have years of evidence that your partner is fully invested in your lives together, you tend to not be at all threatened by things that would've been unthinkable at the beginning of your relationship when all the endorphins basically make you insane.  :)"
gaybros,3boghf,Anconia80,4,Wed Jul 1 12:27:13 2015 UTC,"It's larger than religion I think.  It's a whole set of cultural factors and expectations, social norms and to some extent, the idea of what is 'normal' and acceptable."
gaybros,3boghf,Anconia80,3,Wed Jul 1 13:45:46 2015 UTC,"The reason I focused on religion specifically is people who advocate for monogamy from a non-religious standpoint at least have some ability to discuss the continuum between strict monogamy and a completely open relationship in earnest. Non-religious monogamy is actually a fair new concept with its roots in birth control. Before birth control, there wasn't much expectation for men to be monogamous, just women. Men having a mistress of girlfriend on the side may not have been openly discussed with their wives, but it wasn't especially unusual or taboo.   When women finally got control of their bodies with birth control, rather than everyone getting the benefits and open-mindedness of sexual liberation, men decided the idea of their wives getting some dick on the side was more than their fragile egos could handle, so it was culturally decided that monogamy within marriage would become the expectation, even for men.   I'll happily concede that most people tacitly accept monogamy as a social norm, but at least those who do on the basis of social norm have the capacity to honestly consider the alternatives if they're secure enough within their relationships, even if they ultimately opt for monogamy in the end. When someone comes from a basis of religion, the intellectual race is over before it begins."
gaybros,3boghf,Citizen1139,4,Wed Jul 1 15:16:57 2015 UTC,The humans that I've been have taught me that nothing is ever as clear cut as this.
gaybros,3boghf,Muscadine76,7,Wed Jul 1 02:49:42 2015 UTC,"My marriage has been ""open""/polyamorous for...at least 11 years now?  We've been together 14, are happy together, very much still in love, have a good sexual chemistry together, and live day-to-day under the assumption of a lifelong commitment.  I think ""making it work"" mostly comes down to trust and communication.  At the beginning there were a number of ""rules"" dealing with such things as when and how we needed to notify each other we were planning to meet someone, when and where we could meet other people, what we could do with them, veto power over potential partners, and so forth.  Over time those rules have become less formalized and I'd say the focus is more about clear communication (which it always was about really, the rules were just a facilitator for ensuring everyone was staying on the same page).   I think it's notable that both then and now most sexual interactions with others have been together, whether ""playing together"" or dating someone together, and even when seeing someone mostly separately they've worked best when there are positive interactions all around. That partially has to do with our long-term preferences regarding FWBs and/or BFs, but I do think that's something that helped it to work in the early stages (it can help facilitate trust and communication in obvious ways, for example), at least for us. At this point I think it's something we both feel a preference for because we've had good experiences with that kind of approach.  YMMV, of course.  Trying not to be Pollyannaish about it, another thing to note is that extra-relationship sex can be a source of conflict and, maybe just as or more often, can bring other conflicts to the surface. An underlying commitment and level of trust does have to be there that you're willing to couch any disagreements in the context of. I think a lot of people try opening up their relationships to try to ""save"" them and I think that is generally doomed to failure. To end on a positive note, though, if your relationship is on a solid foundation extra-relationship sex can also be a source of joy, humor, bonding, and other positive things."
gaybros,3boghf,MattHardwick,4,Wed Jul 1 03:15:21 2015 UTC,I am so happy to see open/poly relationships discussed so openly. Far too many people judge them and write them off as things that will never last.

gaybros,3boghf,Muscadine76,3,Wed Jul 1 04:38:12 2015 UTC,You mention you have been discussing your relationship at length.  What issue has precipitated the open relationship question?  Different motives may result in different outcomes.
gaybros,3boghf,Muscadine76,-1,Tue Jun 30 21:56:26 2015 UTC,"We spent a lot of time together lately and he has been coming to my family and helping out with stuff.  As a reference, we have been together for 7 months roughly.  We study in the same field, at the same school actually.  We had a few disagreements over the weekend, that is mostly what triggered the discussion.  We had discussed the possibility of an open relationship before.  At the time, he was completely closed to the idea.  This time however I felt more of an opening and he even started talking about what might some potential rules be.  The disagreements mostly stemed from some stuff I did while I was on vacation (nothing sexual) that he considered was risky behavior and for me I just saw it as I was partying and Im sortof adventurous and thats just the kind of shit I do.  And it partly it gets down to that, its in my nature that I am adventurous and like to try stuff and sexuality is a part of that.  I was also telling him how on so many fronts he basically has everything I want from a boyfriend.  Like we get along perfectly, we share a lot of similar interests.  We are acquinted with each others family and I feel like he has many positive repercussions on my personal and family life.  I also told him that physically he is not the kind of guy I am normally attracted to.  Like when we first met I wasnt really attracted to him physically speaking and it is other factors that drove me towards him.  At the end of the discussion we decided to give ourself a week of thinking, without seeing of talking to each other, to try and figure out what we want, like do we want to pursue this relationship or do we want to stop it before we get too involved with each other, which in a sense, I feel like we already are.  So in a way I feel really selfish because I feel like it gets down to me, I feel like I cant decide between building a future with a guy that I love and that provides me with so many positive thing but I feel like that compromises my need for adventure and sexual freedom and having experiences with guys that I am more physically attracted to.  Like on one side I feel like I am just selfish and that I feel like I just want everything, but on the other hand I have seen many guys who were together for years and years and who have just seem to understand that they can make the difference between enjoying their sexuality and building something sacred with someone that they really want as a life partner, and that both are possible if both parties are on the same page."
gaybros,3boghf,jwax33,6,Tue Jun 30 22:43:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure entirely agree with some of the other commenters (for example, I don't think there's a magic level of sexual attraction that makes a relationship work or not), but jwax33 is right that motives do matter and that 7 months is a relatively short time to be dating. It sounds like you two are still feeling out whether this relationship is ""going anywhere"" beyond dating (which I think is normal - lots of relationships reach this point around 6mo IME), so this means you don't have a clear relationship foundation yet.  On the other hand, it could be you're establishiping a relationship foundation that just takes open relationships as a given part of that.  I guess I'm not clear if the ""disagreements"" are a crisis and this opening of the relationship is an attempt to ""save"" the relationship, or if these were more mundane disagreements that simply opened up the conversation about whether an open relationship might work as the best long-term relationship form for the two of you. If the former, that's kind of a red flag to me, if the latter, that's healthy and normal, assuming you are both in fact onboard/on the same page (or are able to get on the same page).  Based on what you've said above, it does sound like regardless of how things go with this particular guy, you may have had a personal revelation that an open relationship is what would work best for you personally.  What is your bf's current position/feeling as you understand it (that something you'll presumably learn more about when you reconnect in a week)? Did he/you talk about it more as an option for both of you, or as something he could accept for you to do? Is he interested in doing things together with someone else?"
gaybros,3boghf,thisdude415,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:33:24 2015 UTC,"definitely the later.  he voiced that his main concern was that one of us, out of sexual attraction, may fall in love for another guy.  which I think is understandable.  we didnt talk about having a third party together with us specifically.  But if it were individually outside the couple I wish it was something that we could talk about openly and laugh about together.  And it's true that 7 months isnt much.  But for having been in other (some much longer) LTRs I know that what Im feeling for this guy is genuine and that he is someone I want to grow with.    edit: and thanks for the response it's amazingly well formulated"
gaybros,3boghf,DILFchaser,3,Wed Jul 1 04:31:15 2015 UTC,"Np!  I think concerns about falling in love with other guys are real, especially when you don't have a long history together to fall back on, so to speak. However, ultimately it's about choices and commitment - you can choose to be true to your relationship no matter how long the relationship has existed. Just being aware of how bonding hormones work helps - feeling ""head-over-heels"" and/or experiencing ""NRE""/New Relationship Energy with someone new you are flirting with and/or have had sex with is something mono-oriented people sometimes interpret to mean that they aren't ""really"" in love with the person they're with. But those kinds of feelings don't necessarily indicate that and certainly aren't the only basis (or perhaps even a particularly good basis) for judging relationships. Of course, from a more poly perspective, feeling love for someone new and exploring a relationship with them also doesn't preclude staying in love/relationship with the person you're already with, but that doesn't sound like the head-space you guys are in, at least right now - sounds like it's more about exploration and fun. So as long as you are both deliberate about keeping activities and feelings in that space it's something that can work for your relationship."
gaybros,3boghf,RideOnBart,3,Wed Jul 1 15:50:13 2015 UTC,"Tough one.  There are some wise open relationship folks here who may have better insight but it sounds to me like you two might be better off as friends.  You don't seem to have much sexual attraction to him at all, and I'm not sure you can really fix that by opening the relationship up.  And I'm not sure the relationship would be satisfying for your BF knowing he doesn't fulfill you sexually at all, essentially."
gaybros,3boghf,nailz1000,2,Tue Jun 30 23:02:32 2015 UTC,Thats not entirely true.  I do have some degree of sexual attraction for him.

Now the reality, a wedding is to celebrate you and your spouse, it is YOUR day. As such there is no right or wrong. Make the wedding personable for you. You said you don't need flowers, don't waste the money on them. You want mac-n-chees....then by God serve it up (by the way, this dish can be given grown up flair by simply adding lobster, crab, chicken, or whatever)  Bottom line, plan it how you see fit. My husband and I went to NY and got married in Central Park. We done tuxes, Cupcakes, and a handful of close friends and family, nothing big nor traditional. We threw our reception at a place called Whirleyball in Atlanta a few weeks later. (Whirleyball is really cool, combine bumper cars with lacrosse). The money was saved by not doing a lot of the big traditional wedding things we spent on our honeymoon."

Recruit your friends and give them authority to do things like set up a room with decorations/tables.  The best receptions I've been to focused on the food. Choose a popular food that packs away well, meaning it can cooked off-site and sit for a while and keep it's flavor. Choose a restaurant that you love and you trust and ask if they will cater a reception. Use a serving table with a few servers, rather than table service with waiters.  The single best food I've had for a wedding reception was also one of the lowest budget. A local Persian restaurant that they loved (and all their friends loved) showed up on site with trays of grilled meats, spicy rice dishes and so forth. The quality was insane and it was probably a quarter the price of wedding-industrial rubber chicken.  Second best was probably trays of Indian food. It was a dual-heritage wedding, and the Indian food was there for that side of the family. But pretty much all the guests ended up on that side because the flavor was so much better than the main table."

gaybros,3bmual,dunkelblaugrau,5,Tue Jun 30 15:17:32 2015 UTC,"Never been married but if you want simplicity just have a wedding in a courthouse with essential guests then just book a function room of a hotel for a huge party. Have an open bar and just get a buffet instead of worrying about a sit down dinner, flowers aren't exactly necessary so you may want some roses for the suit jackets and your best men/maid of honour and some centrepieces at the reception but if you're feeling low key just some balloons and confetti will do. It only has to become a grand, complicated thing if you want it to be."

gaybros,3bmual,gitismatt,3,Tue Jun 30 16:57:21 2015 UTC,"All weddings are pretty much the same. Everyone says they want to do ""something different"" but most weddings end up being similar because of pressure from family and friends. And that's before the photographer, venue staff, celebrants, etc who just want to do what they always do.  Make sure that whatever you decide, your friends and family understand what you have planned and why.  I was chatting to a straight couple that had gotten married last year and they decided they didn't want a photographer. The bride hates posing for photos and the groom wanted to enjoy the day, not do a photo shoot.  An uncle assumed this was because they couldn't afford it. Without asking, he hired a photographer to come to the wedding and take photos as a surprise. Cue distressed bride, pissed off groom, confused uncle and much upset."
gaybros,3bmual,chronug,3,Tue Jun 30 17:11:07 2015 UTC,"When we talked about weddings I said ""I personally don't care for parties, but this is your wedding too so I'll be happy to organize a reception if that is what you want to have"". We talked about it for a while, looked at prices for events and, at the end, decided that we had better uses for our money. So we scheduled a courthouse wedding, dressed up in suits, got married, and then went out to a fancy Restaurant to celebrate afterwards with a very short list of friends (4). Did people complain? Yes, many people complained that we didn't have a big reception and party. Did we care that people complained? No. It's our wedding, not theirs. Two years later I still have fond memories of that amazing day. It was just what we both wanted. Having said that, I've attended gay and straight weddings with a reception and a big group of friends and family attending and they were lovely and memorable. So talk it over with your boyfriend, see what you both would like, what you wouldn't like, see what your budget is (do not go into debt going into your marriage), and remember that it is your marriage ceremony, so do what you both want, and don't worry about what other people expect you to do. Congratulations!"
gaybros,3bmual,OsoCafe,3,Tue Jun 30 17:42:54 2015 UTC,"We got out girlfriend to drive us around the city and post as ""the bride"" at various hotels and venues where we got tours of the banquet halls, rooms and services, asked about fees etc. We saw 3-4 hotels and by the end of the 4th one we were both exhausted, but we also had a very clear idea about which questions to ask, what fees we should inquire about etc. The first meeting we had with a hotel event planner took like 2.5 hours, whereas the 4th one took about 20 minutes, including seeing the room and options for table-settings. We were on our way home, feeling only a little excited about our big day when I nudged my partner and pointed to the swanky hotel in town, the one we were too afraid to even look at. This giant, obsidian black glass building with bamboo encasing it. ""We may as well just peek in and get a quote"" I said. My partner and our friend kind of exchanged nervous glances and finally just sighed and shrugged and were like ""alright, let's go."" From the moment we stepped through the door we knew we had the right place. The lobby alone was 10x nicer than anywhere else we'd seen, it was decorated with old suitcases and photographs, fancy wooden furniture. There was a giant glass wall with a waterfall and the color scheme was red and black, with a dark oakwood bar. We asked all the right questions and when we were shown the room it blew us away. All the other places we'd seen there was always something wrong... like the carpet was super ugly, or the tables were oddly shaped, or the chairs were super ugly. Literally everything about this room was perfect. The website with photos of the venue is here, which you should click and not accept anything less than that... because there's some shit venues out there, bro. We sheepishly inquired about the price and were delighted to hear it was actually cheaper than other, much worse venues. We booked instantly. The nice part about getting married in Japan is that it doesn't have to be this big expense that puts you in the hole... since traditionally guests are expected to make a ""donation"" of either $150 or $300, depending on if they're family / close friends or just acquaintances. The man and I each forked out about $1500 of our own money and the rest was covered by charging each guest $80 to attend (we had 80 guests) which included open bar for 2 hours + a 5 course meal. Total cost for the whole party was around $7500 I think, and we got way more bang for our buck than spending say $10g at another place. Perhaps you think it's silly to charge people fro an ""open bar"" but there were a variety of fine beers, unlimited wine and all spirits. We explicity stated no gifts, no registry... just the 80 clams, which is 1/2 of what is considered the cultural minimum. Some people were offended we were charging to come to our wedding, and I understand.... but only partly. I think it's tacky to give less than $80 for a wedding gift. We kept the speeches and ceremonial stuff very short. I wanted people to be able to get the most out of the experience. I cried a lot, of course. Our ""Entrance Song"" (what Japanese couples play before they're ""presented"" to the audience) was ""Aint No Mountain High Enough"", by Diana Ross (without Marvin Gay - the one where she talks most of the song). We made our welcome board using items from the dollar store, as well as seating charts etc. I spent about 48 sleepless hours perfecting the seating chart. With 80 guests, there's always going to be at least 1-2 people who have to be sacrificed for the greater good. It was a practically perfect seating plan, but unfortunately one of my friend's had to sit at the geek table. I begrudgingly had to sign up for a Pinterest account (ick!) because all the good pictures I was using for inspiration were on there. I'd say it's a great idea if you're thinking up ideas on what to do. We had ""Bridesmaids"" which consisted of our 6 closest friends and assigned them all a different color of the rainbow. Having bridesmaids was, by far and away the most stressful experience of the planning process because they all had objections. They set restrictions on what kind of dress they would approve, what kind of makeup, etc. etc. Eventually we got them to agree on a simple black dress from H&M for $35 accessorized with pearls. We wanted them all to wear their hair in top knots but at the last minute gave in and let them wear it how they wanted. They walked into the room before us in order of their colors (ROYGBV) and the hotel made us bouquets which each of the flowers that we picked up on that day. We had a slideshow that my partner made which showed him growing up, me growing up (with baby pictures, pictures from middle and high school and uni) and then ending with our life together thus far, with ""highlight"" slides showing what we did for our various anniversaries - went to Okinawa, went to Fukuoka, got a puppy, etc. During this slide show we played ""The Rose"" by Bette Middler  and THAT was a showstopper. Absolutely everyone there, including big burly men were wailing in tears. It was beautifully done. After that was over, we threw an after party at a Jazz Bar across the street where we played music and got wasted, and then a 3rd party at another bar across the street from that. Here are just a couple pics: We took some photos in the castle-park before walking to the venue. We got lucky and the cherry blossoms a week early One Two And here's us at the Groom's Table. For the 2nd party we bought 3-4 disposble cameras and handed them out for people to use. The pictures came back looking really cool - they've got a really 70's feel about the quality as it's very matte and grainy. Loved that idea. This is me drunk as shiiiiit"

We paid attention to the things we cared about: invite list, food selections, the cake, DJ (for him), what the ceremony itself would be like. We paid little to no attention to things we didn't care about.  About two months out my mother asked if there were things she could do to help us. She had figured out that neither of us had spent our lives planning a wedding, and since I only have one brother who is straight, this was really her chance to get involved in a wedding. I offered her the stuff we didn't care about, but didn't mind if it happened - flowers and decor. She ran a couple ideas past us a week later and then organized flowers, centerpieces, and favors from two thousand miles away.  Basically, it's fine to not deal with things you don't care about. It's great, even. Do what you want. But in some of these areas you might be able to get a little help."
gaybros,3bmual,findingphilly,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:43:38 2015 UTC,"My husband wanted the courthouse, I wanted the big shebang. So we compromised on a small church wedding with 20 guests. No music, no flowers. We opted out of a reception because he HATES being the center of attention, so we had brunch in a private room at a restaurant. It was just intimate enough where we didn't feel awkward, and we saved a ton of money.   We originally planned for an October wedding, but my folks accidentally planned a vacation two weeks after we told them of the engagement. So, we bumped it up to June because we were going to be in DC for pride, we already booked our hotel room and all our friends were gonna be there, so why not?  Fun facts!:  -The marriage license room is the happiest room in the courthouse.   -The day will be a blur,  no matter how big or small.  -HIRE. A. PHOTOGRAPHER. I'm a photographer and back then money was tight. I couldn't photograph my own wedding, so I had one of the guests take photos. They turned out ok, but I edited them and now they look axing.

gaybros,3bmual,morgaes,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:41:01 2015 UTC,"I just got married 3 weeks ago (I'm the one in pink). We had to plan the whole thing in 10 days due to some issues we ran into. We had always planned to just go to a magistrate and then have a party afterwards, but there was a strike so we couldn't get the papers done. Neither of us are religious so we didn't want to go the church route, but then we found out that the secular humanist society could also do the paperwork. So we decided to go ahead with the wedding while my husband's mother was still visiting from the States.   We had a small ceremony/reception at my parent's house with only the closest relatives and friends (about 35 guests). The officiant met with us a week before and went over how we wanted the ceremony to be. We wanted it to be short and no fuss, lighthearted and not too sappy. She had us fill out a questionnaire about us which she then used to write a little speech about our relationship that she recited during the ceremony. Everyone agreed that this made the ceremony feel very personal and sweet. We had no traditional entrance nor exit, we just got into position and then the ceremony started. The ceremony consisted of the officiant welcoming everyone, talking about secular humanism, talking about the meaning of marriage/love, talking about our relationship and poking fun, vows, rings and then of course the kiss. During the ceremony we just had soft instrumental music playing in the background (we just found a playlist on Spotify). The ceremony ended with a toast which then lead directly into the reception. Two days before the wedding, my family started teaming up to make finger food and cakes. We also served red and white wine, soda and of course some bubbly to toast with. My uncle is a hobbyist photographer so he took pictures of the ceremony for us.   After the reception, we headed over to our apartment where we had an old school party with all of our friends. Nothing fancy, just punch, beer, chips and leftovers from the reception. It was a blast and the last guests left around 6AM.  Even though we never intended on having an actual ceremony, we're both very happy with how the wedding turned out. Small, short, sweet and intimate and ending with a killer party. Nothing extraneous, no stressing about guest lists/seating/DJs/caterers or anything like that."

The previous loosely organized, grassroots marches and parades were taken over by more organized and less radical elements of the gay community. The marches began dropping ""Liberation"" and ""Freedom"" from their names under pressure from more conservative members of the community, replacing them with the philosophy of ""Gay Pride"" [citation needed] (in the more liberal San Francisco, the name of the gay parade and celebration was not changed from Gay Freedom Day Parade to Gay Pride Day Parade until 1994). The Greek lambda symbol and the pink triangle which had been revolutionary symbols of the Gay Liberation Movement, which is headed by were tidied up and incorporated into the Gay Pride, or Pride, movement, providing some symbolic continuity with its more radical beginnings [clarification needed].

I like how supportive the cop is in this instance, and I think it really sets the mood for the event. However, a friend of mine on facebook posted how the ""hot white cop"" going viral ""epitomizes the divide between the LGBT elite and those whom are marginalized within the movement"" (friend is gay, white, very in tune with issues of social justice).   Now, I myself am a person of color, and I do know (and feel) the issues we face even in the LGBT community, but I can't say I fully agreed with my friend's statement. Whenever I saw this post (I think first time was on Buzzfeed), race was never mentioned. Thoughts from anyone??  And sorry if this was the wrong place to ask this question, but it's something that's been bugging me all weekend..."
gaybros,3bk38u,blue_surfboard,3,Tue Jun 30 15:33:25 2015 UTC,"Wow. I've never seen the cops race listed anywhere. I do think that the marginalization of people of color (and trans people, and poor people, and queer people, etc.) is a huge problem in our community, but I didn't see that here.   I think that the upset here is less a result of this individual instance and more a result of systemic problems in our culture that undervalue and under represent people of color and others marginalized in this movement. So, while I feel that the upset here in this specific microcosm isn't necessarily warranted, it is absolutely warranted as part of the macrocosm of representation and we should be cognizant of representing a wide spectrum of hot allies (and hot members of our own community, and members of our community that aren't traditionally hot and members of our community that are valued for things other than their attractiveness) instead of always gravitating towards white, masculine heteronormativity. As well as cognizant of how the subtle pervasiveness of passive racism, heterosexism and other various isms create an unwelcoming culture without us realizing we are complicit in creating that culture.   That said, anyone who feels the need to point out that the cop is white in order to appreciate his studly ally-ness is missing the point. And probably a butthead."
gaybros,3bk38u,blue_surfboard,0,Tue Jun 30 16:21:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I pretty much agree with your points. So just to clarify, and sort of play a devil's advocate, you don't think that this video going viral is an instance of ""subtle pervasiveness of passive racism""? Again, I do agree with you, just creating dialogue here.  And unfortunately, I wouldn't describe this particular friend as a butthead lol. Like I said, he's very in tune with issues of social justice, but he is sort of missing the point here."
gaybros,3bk38u,jwax33,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:10:49 2015 UTC,"Oh I wasn't saying your friend is a butthead. I was saying that anyone who is feeling the need to say mention that the cop is white in saying why they found the cop attractive is probably a butthead.   I would say that the video one small piece of an elaborate landscape that is, as a whole, affected by pervasive racism. Think about a Seurat painting. It's comprised of 15,000 tiny dots of paint. When put together, those dots, none of which is the Eiffel Tower in and of itself, become the Eiffel Tower when you step away from it and look at the whole instead of each part. Now suppose that the Eiffel Tower something detrimental to our society, like passive racism, or the whitewashing of the LGBTQIA community in the media. We don't want there to be an Eiffel Tower anywhere, so that painting is something that we don't want. But that doesn't mean that there is anything at all wrong with each of those dots.   As part of a different landscape of dots, that dot of paint could be Un dimanche après-midi à l'Île de la Grande Jatte, which is a fucking masterpiece, when you step away. Likewise, this video could be part of a media landscape that is a fucking masterpiece. It's not. It's part of a media landscape that is whitewashed and passively racist. That doesn't mean that there is anything wrong with the video, just the entire landscape that the video is part of.   In short, I don't think there is anything wrong with this video going viral. I think there is something wrong with the fact that the only videos we see going viral are ones featuring heteronormative, white members of the LGBTQIA community and allies or that the videos about non-heteronormative members and allies of color are about the fact that they are not heteronormative and of color, instead of allowing them to exist as hot allies who are of color or not heteronormative studs.   Pretty sure I just outgayed myself."

Feels like it's taboo to say it out loud, just like uttering the words 'I'm gay' for the first time out loud was really hard for a lot of us.   It seems like the perfect chance to lead the conversation around acceptance and correct them in a friendly way 'actually it's his/my boyfriend, I know it's sometimes hard to know how to address them but dont worry that's the right term!'. Give them both the impetus to not say friend again, and permission/guidance on what they should say. If 'friend' shows up again after that... then fuck em."

Finally I interrupted her from the couch, ""My friend?"" To which she replied, ""Well, what do you want me to call him?"" ""My boyfriend."" It was fairly light-hearted and given that she was talking to my grandpa it was fine. I think it was partially her still getting a hang of the situation, but mostly being cautious with my grandpa. I have no clue what his opinion on the matter is, and I'm sure she doesn't either.   I do remember her telling me he mentioned seeing I had a ""new friend"" on Facebook and asked my mom if I was happy and said something along the lines of that's what matters. It seemed kind nonetheless. (Except a few days later it sort of got brought up in person and it was awkward, so I really have no idea what he thinks but also don't really care).   Recently before I left to visit my parents for the summer I asked if my mom had said anything to my stepdad and brother about my new boyfriend and she  said, ""Yeah, I told them you have a new boyfriend.""

It's like I get all the sympathy for being part of a discriminated against minority, but I don't actually face any real repercussions from being discriminated against. Part of it of course has to do with guilt for feeling like I haven't done enough for gay rights myself. As somebody who only came out six years ago, and was scared shitless at the time that I was going to lose all my friends and family, it's hard not to be surprised by my own comfort, complacence even, with my sexuality.

But it really does make all of the difference.   Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth;  Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,  And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.  I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.  -Robert Frost"

Extremely passive aggressive ways of saying they didn't like the Supreme Court ruling.  I find the ""red revolution"" symbology pretty funny, though. You've got this young group of people who are carrying on the ""red revolution,"" meanwhile the older folks who espouse the same values were ones fighting against a red revolution.  Also if I remember correctly (and I admit, I'm no biblical scholar) but wasn't red typically referenced around death and violent acts, like war? Scarlet is also often associated with sin. I suppose they couldn't go with purple (which is associated with royalty) because of its connection to the LGBT movement (also the Minnesota Vikings; no one wants to be associated with them) but what's wrong with Amber? Amber is used to describe the light of God. Or blue (associated with hope and healing), or orange (which is associated with spiritual warfare)?  It really makes the whole thing seem really poorly thought out. Then again, look at the status itself. ""Some don't want to rep cuz who is doing it..but the rest of us show unity!!!"" I don't even know what the hell that means, but it's definitely trying to cultivate a blind, herd-like groupthink to unquestioningly support this idea, lest you be shamed for not being willing to ""rep […] for Jesus!!"""

There were curious people there, too I'm sure. Everybody lost because of Erdogan. Ramadan is supposed to be a peaceful, festive time, a perfect time for a Pride parade. This is not only disgusting because of the violence and hypocrisy, but it is disgusting because Erdogan and his ilk are misusing Ramadan as a political weapon. GLBT people, muslims, and others should be outraged over this."

This is just another example of how religious hardliners have seized control of Turkey. It won't be long before they slip into another religious dark age."
gaybros,3bey41,xMikado,10,Sun Jun 28 21:33:39 2015 UTC,"Though the religious right wing in Turkey is growing, it's far from an actual theocratic state that has religious leaders with actual positions of power in the gouvernement. It's currently going more in a Middle East Tea Party direction.  Edit: I wanted to add that there's also a lot of opposition to Erdogan's party and they didn't get a total majority which prevents them from making the position of the president more powerful. There's still a lot of democratic discourse and I don't like to see over-simplified explanations to the democratic situation of Turkey."
gaybros,3bey41,KrakatoaSpelunker,-16,Sun Jun 28 22:27:27 2015 UTC,"Ramadan is a peaceful and festive time, but the focus is already on something else. It's really a terrible time for a Pride parade.  If people tried to hold a Pride parade in the US on Christmas Day or even the 4th of July, there would certainly be objections.   Even from a pure logistical level, like providing security, it'd be really difficult."
gaybros,3bey41,turroflux,16,Sun Jun 28 21:59:08 2015 UTC,"Ramadan isn't a day, it's an entire month long celebration. If you want to blame someone for the two having an overlap (of a whole, single day)  direct your complaints to the NYPD. It's not the Turks fault pride falls when it does, chances are it would have fallen on someones holy celebration somewhere."
gaybros,3bey41,KrakatoaSpelunker,-3,Sun Jun 28 22:10:25 2015 UTC,"Even in the US, not all cities celebrate Pride this week. It's not like the date is completely inflexible.   There's no requirement to celebrate Pride in the last week of June. IIRC, Atlanta does theirs in October."
gaybros,3bey41,ThatBernie,15,Mon Jun 29 00:41:37 2015 UTC,"Ramadan is frequently used in other Muslim-majority countries as a pretext to crack down on ""immorality"" and political dissent. In Jordan, for example, bars and restaurants are not allowed to serve alcohol for the month (even if the owners and/or clientele are Christians, or non-observant Muslims, or whatever), protests are shut down harder and quicker, and places that tend to have a relatively high proportion of gay clientele (e.g. Books@Cafe) find themselves more intensely scrutinized and are sometimes forced to close. It's basically ""sit down and shut up"" month, and it's sad to see Turkey joining that trend. Gay Turks rescheduling Pride would essentially signal their acceptance of a situation in which, for one month out of every year, civil and political rights are diminished."
gaybros,3bey41,KrakatoaSpelunker,-5,Mon Jun 29 02:36:23 2015 UTC,Just like how you can't serve alcohol on Sundays in many places because of Christianity?

gaybros,3bey41,josiahpapaya,8,Sun Jun 28 18:58:33 2015 UTC,"When I lived in the West, most of my friends were Muslim and I found myself getting engaged in a lot of political activity... in particular, queer rights and also divestment campaigns for companies that supply weapons to Israel. Having spent 4+ years away now, being relatively divorced from whats' been happening I find myself less and less sympathetic to issues in the Muslim community and the ""yeah, but"" part of soul that bled for ""good"" Muslims has been reduced to practically nothing. I still have Muslim friends and I don't care if someone's a Muslim, but I've noticed that since the landmark GLBT moment in the U.S not a single one of them (my 50-60 or so Muslim friends) have liked a single status, or has shown support in any way for media championing the ruling. The only things I've seen shared relating to this huge moment for gay people in America are things like ""don't let that distract you from (insert something to do with another cause here)"". In the past few months, as a Canadian I've also seen tons of press from Toronto about the Muslim community actively mobilizing against our new sex ed curriculum because it now includes references to trans and queer people. They're distributing propaganda within the community saying that the new curriculum will confuse kids' gender, teach them how to masturbate and give detailed instructions on anal sex (all of which are not true). I was shocked when I saw some of my friends - who all know I'm gay and worked with me in the same social justice advocacy work, who are also Muslim, engaging in negative discussions on their FB about the new course of study and going so far as to pass along the propaganda themselves. Friends I knew in Canada calling for Sharia law to be an acceptable form of self-governance in ""Muslim communities"". It's heartbreaking to think that some people I fought alongside for years, trying to end their plight of discrimination and to help ""solve"" the conflict in Palestine... and they'd just as soon move to a legal system that prescribes (on a good day) imprisonment and flogging for my ilk, but on a bad day execution in the most abhorrent of circumstances. What I find the most frustrating about confronting my problems with Islam is that when I bring these issues up with my Muslim friends they pull the same shit that my Jewish friends pull when I criticize Israel and call me anti-semetic. My Muslim friends tell me I'm being Islamaphobic and then they try to bring up the whole ""oh, but what about Christians then?"" argument. What about Christians? That's a great point... because it seems to me these days that it's very easy to say you don't believe Christianity has any place being taught in schools, but to suggest that Islam also be completely divorced from the public purse then all of a sudden you're no better than Sean Hannity. I guess some of you still have that ""yeah, but.."" part of you going strong. ""Yeah, but not all Muslims are kill-the-infidel types from Saudi!"" Yeah, I know. But I don't really care anymore. I think all religions are inherently horrible and it's shit like this, as an adult man, that has made me pretty much wash my hands in fighting for any cause related in any way to religion. ""Yeah, but they were protesting during Ramadan, what did they expect?"" Yeah. Go fuck yourselves."

gaybros,3bey41,KrakatoaSpelunker,-11,Sun Jun 28 22:04:26 2015 UTC,"This is hardly unique to Turkey or Islam. If you tried to hold a parade without a permit in NYC, the reaction would actually be very similar. Even ad-hoc demonstrations like #blacklivesmatter have to have a special permit."

You use the words ""asked"" and ""request"" but in reality no one was asked to do anything, there were demands and a follow through with violence.

gaybros,3bey41,rainbow_worrier,19,Sun Jun 28 17:56:14 2015 UTC,"So what, everyone has to live like a Muslim during Ramadan? What is the reason the march wasn't allowed during that month? Not ignoring the request to me seems like admitting that LGBT stuff is sinful."
gaybros,3bey41,SexyWhale,-18,Sun Jun 28 18:07:31 2015 UTC,"96.4%-99.8% people there are muslim, you have to respect the culture and religion."
gaybros,3bey41,rainbow_worrier,27,Sun Jun 28 18:12:09 2015 UTC,During the Muslim's holy month of Ramadan they have to refrain from sinful behaviour; can you see why it's a problem to cancel the march if the only reason given when you are asked to is that it is Ramadan? What message is being sent there? Sometimes cultural and religious views have to be challenged a little so we can move forward and promote an environment of tolerance and mutual respect.
gaybros,3bey41,KrakatoaSpelunker,-3,Sun Jun 28 18:25:22 2015 UTC,"Muslims have to refrain from a lot of other things too, like food and drinking water. There's no reason to focus only on ""sinful behavior""."
gaybros,3bey41,rainbow_worrier,6,Sun Jun 28 21:56:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't think it was relevant here though because pride isn't about feasting but perhaps there is some forbidden activity that would conflict that I as a non-Muslim do not know about. As far as I know though the only reason it could be a problem is because it is seen as sinful."
gaybros,3bey41,KrakatoaSpelunker,-4,Sun Jun 28 22:25:01 2015 UTC,The more logical explanation is that it's logistically inconvenient to arrange for a large event (with security and all) when a large portion of the population is fasting.
gaybros,3bey41,rainbow_worrier,9,Mon Jun 29 00:42:41 2015 UTC,Why? Last I checked the Islamic world did not come grinding to a halt for a whole month each year.
gaybros,3bey41,SexyWhale,-9,Mon Jun 29 02:32:45 2015 UTC,"In my opinion it's still reasonable that they asked for the Pride to be held after Ramadan. Sadly a part of the muslims isn't that progressive in Turkey, Erdogan is mainly elected by this group."
gaybros,3bey41,u_got_a_better_idea,4,Sun Jun 28 19:05:02 2015 UTC,"It's definitely reasonable to ask its postponement, it's a lot less reasonable to enforce it through violence."

gaybros,3bey41,tescocola,11,Mon Jun 29 07:57:43 2015 UTC,I'm sure some of those protesting would have liked their rights to be respected too.  Some of the 96.4-99.8% might even have been LGBT and wanted to take part.

gaybros,3bey41,Josetheone1,-1,Sun Jun 28 21:42:04 2015 UTC,I have no argument. I'm just stating what has happened.
gaybros,3bey41,AbsentEmpire,7,Sun Jun 28 21:42:55 2015 UTC,"What happened was that a peaceful parade was violently dispersed by a religious hardliner bent on dictatorship. It didn't matter that it was Ramadan, he would have done it anyway. Also since Turkey's government is supposed to be secular it shouldn't have mattered that it was Ramadan.  Your position that the parade shouldn't have been held because the government was going to block it is equivalent to saying, that Ghandi shouldn't have marched to the sea because the British would shoot the marchers, or that Martin Luther King shouldn't have marched on Selma because whites would kick the shit out them.   Acquiescing to the demands of oppressors because of fear from violence is how the oppressed stay oppressed, giving in has won no one rights to freedom ever. The marchers did exactly what they should have, marched anyway."
gaybros,3bey41,Josetheone1,-3,Sun Jun 28 22:00:05 2015 UTC,"I have no position , You've completely misunderstood what I'm saying.   The Turkish government didn't ""block"" gay pride they have it every year in Turkey without much fuss it was just asked to be requested to be carried out at later date.

I also use a cast iron skillet (I don't have a different cast iron device for the bread).  This helps to get a good overall taste to it.  Also I get yeast at a local coop that is local (I dunno how it is but apparently it is,  I buy it because it's cheaper)  and then I allow about 2 hours of rising for the dough once I make it.  Then I shape it into the bread and allow another 20-30 mins to rise.  Your results might vary though.

The sad fact is that a lot of families will hold economic bondage over your head to keep you subservient to them. A lot of people have to weigh the pros and cons, which is why some people either don't come out til much later and/or after they have, allow their parents to treat them like shit. My ex boyfriend who I was with for 3 years was like this. His Dad paid his rent, bought his groceries and paid his tuition and credit card bills. The trade-off was that his Dad never wanted to discuss his son's homosexuality (their very own DADT policy) and if he came to visit, he asked that I not be in our home. At first I was angry with his father, but I quickly became to resent my partner for being spineless and allowing his Dad to purchase his dignity. That was sort of the beginning of the end for us. I heard all the excuses ""He's Catholic"" ""He's Italian"" ""It's a cultural thing"" ""he's still taking time to get adjusted"". Nah, boo. It's not about him. It's about you, and being too afraid of standing up to your dad. I'm not saying he's you, but what I'm saying is that he's manipulating both your economic dependence on him and giving you the ultimatum between him and your family to control you because for a conservative parent to find out their child is gay is very frightening. It's that variable they can't control, and parents like that are obsessed with control. You need to realize that no matter what they do or say to you, and make you feel like you're a bad son for chosing your boyfriend ""over your family"", that that's just them using very nasty rhetoric. None of it is true. The truth is, a parent's love should be unconditional."

gaybros,3bfls5,corathus59,4,Mon Jun 29 23:32:35 2015 UTC,"For ten years I worked in Harris county directing a program that was deeply involved in HIV prevention.  We were also involved in getting homeless teenagers off the street, most of whom were gay kids thrown out by their families.  Almost once a week I would wake up to parking tickets on my car in my own drive way because the cops didn't like us ""faggot activists"".  I was stopped a dozen times on the road by cops to harass me, and had them take my insurance papers, and tear them up in my face, and then ticket me for not having insurance papers.    One of my staff was arrested for ""solicitation"" late Friday night (he was arranging a homeless woman and child to get into a shelter).  They did it late Friday night so he would be in the tank all weekend long.  As they put him in the tank the police shouted, ""hey boys, here is a cock sucker from Montrose for you to play with"".   Twice bashers actually came to my home to harass me.  With my own eyes I watched two police cars sit there and observe a gay bashing.  They did nothing to stop the attack.  When gays came running out of the club to stop the beating the cops got out and arrested the attacked person for disturbing the peace.  I think you have some serious blinders on.  When a state votes more than two to one in favor of stripping gays of all their rights it is not bias to notice the fanatic views.  When a governor of the state addresses himself to gay veterans and says, ""if you do not like the well deserved contempt of your neighbors you can always move to another state"", and gets reelected by landslide, and cheered all the way, it is not a bias to note the fanatic state of affairs.  I'm sorry kiddo, but when it comes to respecting gays, Texas sucks.  You have some serious blinders on."
gaybros,3bfls5,i_respondWith_a_song,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:10:26 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear your story.  I truly am.  Texas is not a pioneer when it comes to LGBT like California -- that we can agree on.  But times a changing.  Three or four decades ago all states in this country were anti-gay, even California.  California didn't become pro-gay overnight, and same can be said with Texas albeit slower. The new generation is more progressive than previous ones.  I deeply wish for your fast healing."
gaybros,3bfls5,corathus59,2,Tue Jun 30 05:37:26 2015 UTC,"So people who disagree with you are wounded souls who need healing?  I was not aware of any need to heal, rapid or otherwise.  My best buddy and I made it through the plague years uninfected while all our friends died.  My partner and I are starting our 36th committed year together.  I serve my country in the military, and then in counseling arts, earning my keep through doing some good to my fellow man.  I took the cards life gave me, and I think I have played a half way decent hand at the game.  Of course none of the above is really relevant to the point we are discussing.  Which is the fact that in the 21st century Texas voted over two to one in favor of an amendment to it's constitution that stripped gays of their basic rights as human beings.  This isn't a matter of a state moving more slowly than the rest of the country.  This is a matter of a state moving the other direction, and getting worse.  I guess one condescension deserves another.  You have a serious attachment to a culture and to institutions that have nothing but contempt for who and what you are.  This speaks to a deep and hidden self loathing.  Perhaps you should seek some help in gaining some fast healing for yourself."

gaybros,3bfls5,King_of_Camp,13,Tue Jun 30 00:24:35 2015 UTC,"In Texas employment is completely at will.    However, last year in Lubbock, about as homophobic a city as exists in Texas,  a business fired an employee for being gay.  The response from they city was astounding.  Massive boycott of the business, public outcry,  etc.  The guy found new employment almost immediately due to the publicity of the story,  and the business that fired him almost completely collapsed.    If you are fired for being gay, or if they are threatening,  remember that you have the right to take them to the press and thump them just as hard.  If they openly threaten to fire you,  you have the right to let them know you will not remain silent and will make it known to the media just what bigots they are.    You are no victim.  You are a powerful person with a community of support behind you.  Even people who didn't support gay marriage or many gay rights at all can't stand the thought of someone not being able to work for such an arbitrary reason. For all its homophobia, when you mess with a Texan's ability to work and make something of themselves you cross a much deeper value this state holds dear, the bootstrapping worker looking to better themselves.    (edit: it felt amazing to be able to write about the fight for marriage equality in the past tense)"
gaybros,3bfls5,ANukeGuy,2,Mon Jun 29 06:31:06 2015 UTC,"Look into your company HR practices. Most large companies protect LGBT employees. If yours does not, you may be at risk. Then you will have to gauge how you think your boss will react (as well as future bosses). In general, I don't think most companies will fire someone 'just' for being gay, but it may lead to a bigot taking an increased interest and using it as justification for other reasons. If you have bigots in charge of you, you are going to have to tread lightly, sorry to say. If you have reasonable people that you respect and who respect you, I doubt there will be a problem. 60% of the country supports gay marriage right now and that number is increasing. And more and more companies are worried about the negative reception they would receive if they did actually fire an employee just for being gay (which is why you don't hear about it often). Without further information describing your employment culture it is impossible to say."
gaybros,3bfls5,pensivegargoyle,2,Mon Jun 29 20:57:52 2015 UTC,"It's certainly possible they could fire you when, say, you submit updated benefits information with a man's name as your spouse.

Christianity really didn't start to pick up any serious clout until the 300s, and even then the influence of the religion was pretty spotty. It's the state religion for Rome (which is falling apart at this time) and Armenia (which had a population of about three million). So we're only talking about 1,700 years, and the most part it was only dominant in Europe. Asia is still strongly influenced by Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, Shintoist, and Confucius beliefs at this time, and the Americas are still dominated by the individual aboriginal belief systems.  For the most part Christianity doesn't even start to seep out of Europe until the 1300s or so, with everyone too busy fighting intra-European conflicts and leading crusades into the Middle East (which is most certainly not a Christian region at that time). So we're really only talking about maybe 700 years of global influence, a lot of which was driven by imperial expansion, as opposed to being entirely driven by religious ideals."

I had to make the switch because of google hangouts/voice.  if grindr is your only gripe, try emulating it on bluestacks.   If you want a dirt cheap phone that will do the most basic of stuff, look into the Moto G. The iPhone is really simple to use, almost stupid simple. The only problem is that it's a bit overpriced for the experience it gives you. There's also a new one being announced in the coming months. So you can wait for the latest and greatest or you can just pick up last year's model for less.  What winpho do you have?"
gaybros,3bfk3j,fiftytwofeet,2,Sun Jun 28 20:14:49 2015 UTC,"Moto E is even cheaper than the Moto G. My sister has one and she's pretty happy with it, but she's not a power user."

gaybros,3bfk3j,WouldYouLikeTocuddle,4,Sun Jun 28 20:19:05 2015 UTC,"Apparently, MS is letting iOS and Android apps run more natively with Windows Phone 10. I'm not sure if grindr will make the trip over though. I'm kind of holding out buying a new phone until I can see what the app store ends up being like. If it still sucks, I'll have to stay on Android.  If you want the best camera, you can't go wrong with the iPhone. However, it's a bit more closed and even doing something as simple as getting your pictures out of there can be a task. Android is pretty great but you have to really know what phone you're getting. Try getting something that runs stock android, which is why I recommended the moto g, but something off the Nexus line is usually a safe bet."
gaybros,3bfk3j,tenpoundpen,2,Sun Jun 28 20:31:20 2015 UTC,The Moto G would be a good entry level Android phone that only costs $200 but feels like it should be more. It's a great value.

gaybros,3bfk3j,marvelscott,3,Tue Jun 30 01:43:03 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting post for me because I'm considering making the opposite jump which is from Android to Windows Phone. Mainly because Windows Phone devices are seemingly good quality in whatever the price range is. Contrast that to Android where most budget phones are not as future-proof and are really sluggish.   Nevertheless Android is the way to go especially if you want to put your own music on your device and getting photos off your device. Getting pictures and putting music on an iOS device is a pain in the butt (not the good kind of pain either). You don't mention what device you currently have but if you need a good phone with a decent price I recommend the Moto E or Moto G, the latter having the better camera than the former. The Moto E is fine but it does have less storage space for apps comparing to the Moto G. If you have the money go for a Nexus device and you'll definitely be happy."
gaybros,3bfk3j,marvelscott,3,Mon Jun 29 03:20:54 2015 UTC,"Mainly because Windows Phone devices are seemingly good quality in whatever the price range is.   Can confirm. I bought a Lumia 521 for $99 as a spare phone when my Nexus 4 took an unfortunate tumble and needed repairs. The system had obvious hiccups and issues (switching apps was slow) but for about 95% of what I used it for the thing worked great.  However I don't know if I'd put all this at the feet of Microsoft and Nokia, however, as any kind of engineering accomplishment. It's Microsoft's strict rules about how things work in Windows Phone that have a lot to do with it. For one, the OS doesn't really allow you to do multitasking. You can quickly jump between apps, but only one of them is actually running at any given time (except for things like music or navigation) so the app will have to reload and all that jazz.  It's also because Microsoft has forbidden any kind of skinning or futzing with the OS, like Samsung and HTC do with their Android devices. So it's always running on bare bones code.  Plus there's less competition. Pretty much the only companies making Windows Phones right now are Nokia and HTC, so the only Windows Phones on the market are from quality manufacturers who aren't being out-shouted or undercut by bargain basement manufacturers who are striking deals with carriers. And with fewer devices on the market Microsoft and Nokia can do a lot more testing of the OS on each handset. Meanwhile Kyosera isn't exactly at the top of Google's phone sheet, and Kyosera themselves might not really give a shit anyway.   Contrast that to Android where most budget phones are not as future-proof and are really sluggish.    Most, but not all. As you point out the Moto and Nexus series are pretty good (except for the Nexus S and the Galaxy Nexus; fucking Samsung).   I recommend the Moto E or Moto G, the latter having the better camera than the former.   I totally concur. One of my sisters picked up a Moto E, and my other sister and my mother both have Moto Gs, and they're happy with them. I just want to point out that actually buying these phones is a little pricklier than it looks on the surface. Motorola went and pulled a Google, and when they updated those models they kept the exact same name, so you need to do a little due diligence to make sure you get the second generation handsets. And while either model will function in different regions, for best performance on the cell networks you should make sure you get either the US or Global models, depending on where you live. AFAIK this also effects the warranty on the Moto X.   The Moto E is fine but it does have less storage space for apps comparing to the Moto G.   Both have microSD slots, though, so that helps out in that front. But the Moto E is also physically smaller than the Moto G. It also only has a dual-core CPU vs. a quad-core in the G (which is important if you do a lot of multitasking or are a power user). The Moto E also lacks a front-facing camera, which may be important to you if you do a lot of video calling.  Beyond that they're both pretty similar and are good buys.   If you have the money go for a Nexus device and you'll definitely be happy.    Again, good advice. Ever since I jumped from BlackBerry to Android I've been riding the Nexus train the whole way, and except for issues with the Nexus S and the tail end of the Nexus 4, I've been happy. The Nexus 6, however, is enormous and I'm not so sure I'd buy a phone that big again.  I'd recommend holding off if you can, though, as Google is rumored to be refreshing the Nexus line soon. This may mean a better phone for you, or it may push down the cost of existing models. Either way, it's probably a good idea to wait and see if possible."
gaybros,3bfk3j,0Maverick33,2,Mon Jun 29 17:39:46 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you. One correction though would be that the 2nd gen Moto E does have a front-facing camera. I'm quite jealous since  the 1st gen Moto E I have doesn't have that or auto-focus in the main camera. :/  A few weeks back I was looking for a phone for my brother since he had broken his Samsung Galaxy S4 and he needed a phone right away for his job interviews. The phone's screen shattered and the screen does not power on and also the wifi goes in and out. But no one was surprised since he always manages to break anything he touches. Anyways I was looking for a budget phone and saw the phones at the Microsoft Store. I saw a lot of phones that looked promising and I ended up buying him the BLU Win Jr LTE. It was pretty amazing that it had a camera with auto-focus, front-facing camera included as well, not too mention LTE, and the entire package came with a case all for only $120 CAD. His only real complaint is that there's no Snapchat app which I do feel bad since almost all of his friends use it, but his only requirement was to have a decent camera. If someone were to look for Android phones in this price range they would find cameras that didn't have autofocus or even a front-facing camera.   I'll definitely wait and see what happens in the mobile world. I'm also considering getting a BlackBerry device since all the rumours came out that they were going to install Android in a future device. My current virtual keyboard is Flexy, and the stock keyboard isn't bad either, but I personally miss having a physical keyboard. Also BlackBerry does seem to know what kind of hardware to put in a device. I'm also watching how well Windows 10 Mobile will do on it's roll-out and what the new devices will look like. I'd definitely buy a Windows device to encourage them not to give up. :)"
gaybros,3bfk3j,ugly_pauper,3,Mon Jun 29 20:05:57 2015 UTC,"One correction though would be that the 2nd gen Moto E does have a front-facing camera.   Huh. TIL. Been a while since I looked at the Moto E.   I ended up buying him the BLU Win Jr LTE   I've seen Amazon really pushing BLU handsets, but I've never actually heard of anyone owning them.   not too mention LTE   Eh, LTE doesn't mean much if the hardware can't really handle it. The Lumia 521 also has LTE, but its tiny little CPU can't really take advantage of it and it doesn't have enough RAM to cache enough data.   I'm also considering getting a BlackBerry device since all the rumours came out that they were going to install Android in a future device.   I've heard stories about Android being loaded onto a Passport, but unless they go full Android on a handset I don't know if I'd take the plunge on one for a daily driver. I do miss their physical keyboards though.   Also BlackBerry does seem to know what kind of hardware to put in a device.   Do they really, though? They've got a long history of using old SoCs in their devices, and the Passport is basically the first time they landed in the fairway among other flagships. Even the Blackberry Leap was caught using the Snapdragon S4 Plus, which hit the market when TI was still making mobile CPUs. That's like three, four years ago, in a phone they want ~$199 for today. Moto G just knocks that CPU out of the park.   I'm also watching how well Windows 10 Mobile will do on it's roll-out and what the new devices will look like.   I'm not really holding out much hope. I used Windows 10 on the desktop and I'm quite happy with it. I'm eagerly awaiting the launch next month. The problem with 10 is going to be the same problem with WP8: lack of apps and developer attention. The fact that they're making apps universal, between the desktop and mobile spaces, is awesome, but fact is that no one is developing for the platform anyway.  You can get Netflix and Hulu, but Amazon and HBO are nowhere to be seen. Crappy apps still show up as featured, and the Market still has ten tons of scammy, copyright infringing stuff. It's like Microsoft just doesn't get it: they need to clean up the app store before anyone will even bother to look at it.  Now, granted, we're far and away better than the WP7 days. I remember one of the first times I ever saw a Windows Phone device. Two apps in the top ten most downloaded were timers for performing Kegels (same app, actually, one just was ad-free) and two others just made your phone vibrate. So we're not there any more, but the Desktop marketplace is still almost that bad, and now the two are merging, so I have no idea where that's going to end up."

Not only do I feel better physically but I also feel like it helps my brain unwind and I have caught myself thinking, ""Calm down and breathe"" when I'm in stressful situations in the real world and it honestly helps. I've even had friends comment on me being more mellow.  I kinda love it."
gaybros,3bh5qe,JRATL620,2,Mon Jun 29 14:11:04 2015 UTC,"Some years back I read how you get a much higher calorie burn from your aerobics if you do a full stretch before the exercise.  There is also the fact that injuries from exercising and the pulling of muscles and straining of joints are greatly reduced by a full stretch before exercise.  In addition to this, stretch is one of the primary ways of dumping out the physical tension that stress stores away in our body.  When I do a thorough stretch I sleep much deeper, and much more soundly.    It can also restore the proper alignment of your intestines from the effects of bad posture, leading to much better digestion, and improved regularity.  Proper, complete, thorough stretch is the foundation all good work out programs."

Some thoughts (based on personal experience, no scientific claims here): i) The flexibility + core strength it gives you feels great and is so good for your sex game.  ii) I find it does a good job of naturally distributing muscle and strength over the body- avoid that lollypop body shape.  iii) Mental aspect of relaxing into your body is great. Yoga's origin is in meditating so I often find that at the end of a session I've worked through some shit running in my head. iv) Just to re-emphasize, increasing flexibility (and core) for me has had a big impact in the bedroom. Especially as someone who likes to bottom.   If you working out hard, do that yoga on a rest day.  It can be kinda pricey but pro-tip: go to 4-6 classes to get the basics. Then just watch Youtube yoga videos- its pretty good  considering they're free."

But Saturday night laying in bed, I decided that I absolutely had to go to New York for the Pride Parade. So I did. I'd never been to any kind of gay pride event before and when I came up out of the PATH station and saw rainbow flags as far as the eye could see, man it was the greatest feeling. Seeing hetero couples with their kids, all waving rainbow flags. People as old as my grandparents waving flags. It was the first time I didn't feel like I had to be defensive about the fact that I'm gay. Everyone there was accepting and loving, and the energy present there nearly brought me to tears. It was an incredible experience.   That, combined with the rainbows all over facebook from people and companies alike really just made me so proud to be who I am. :)"

I saw no remote possibility for same-sex marriage to become legalized- definitely not in Texas. To have gone from that to where we are now is just unbelievable. It seems like acceptance is the majority now and only a small minority is committed to making our lives miserable. I never knew how much of a non-issue being gay was until my first year of college. In fact, I feel like it only allowed me to make more friends. We are definitely in a new era of social change, and things are only getting better."

I don't think it is that controversial nowadays given majority of Americans believe in legalizing gay marriage. I am really surprised that 4 of them are on the dissent side though.

He was very effeminate and was a little gender confused, and said that he wanted to be a girl, but also sometimes wanted to be a boy, it just depended on the day. And he was constantly depressed (clinically) because of the way he felt about his gender, and did a lot of unhealthy things out of just sheer depression and frustration (copious amounts of drugs, and unprotected, promiscuous sex). He was an incredibly sweet soul. And he was cute too; he liked to dress in a way that left you guessing as to whether it was masculine or feminine, and he genuinely looked like he could be a pretty girl, unless you looked close and saw the stubble growing in. I legitimately fell in love with him, but the whole ""is a dude"" thing kept me from saying anything, I genuinely have no personal interest in having gay sex (I find the notion of myself touching a penis or having sex with a man vaguely repulsive in the way most people probably do, even if I don't have any problem with someone else doing it). So I guess it was a sort of platonic love? But not really, I found myself wishing ""I really really wish you were a girl, so I could marry you"". I still feel upset with myself for just not saying how I felt at all. Just in case you're reading, I love you, Love.   Oh my god my heart literally just shattered"

gaybros,3bfdi0,alwaysmidlane,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:49:21 2015 UTC,"I am done being fucking alone. But whatever I do I can't fucking find any guys at all.  First, found a cool (or so I thought) guy on grindr. Talked to him for a few days, flirted, even exchanged somewhat naughty pics. Then he fucking just blocks me out of the blue with no explanation. Thought it was going good but I guess not!  Next I tried other guys on grindr up to age 21 (I'm 18) only two responded out of like 10. One said he's not interested. Then the other one stopped responding eventually too.  Off to okcupid.  I messaged 3 guys. Only one responded. Then he stopped responding. The others haven't been on the site for weeks so I don't expect a reply from them.  I could call up an old friend who I assume had a crush on me since we always flirted and he admitted to me he was gay (right before I moved 2000 miles away!) BUT NO! He has no contact info, no social media, he could be fucking dead by now and I wouldn't know. So that's out of the question.   The last option is the worst. Go to a gay meeting thing which I assume is just a bunch of fems or trans which I'm not attracted to. Maybe I could find one guy at this thing but it would probably be lame and cheesy as fuck like all gay meetup club things are.  I probably can't go to a gay bar, don't even think I could get in since I'm not 21 (not sure though).  It's really not fair. My best friend can go anywhere and pick up chicks just by going up to them and he's not even that attractive. I only have stupid fucking apps to find gay guys since I don't wanna go up to a straight guy and be like ""yo, you suck dick"". Being gay is a fucking curse. It's a bad dream.

I would suggest that you learn to hang out with people and keep their company in spite of the fact that you don't want to bang them. Of my last four dates of consequence:   One came from being on a beach where a dude who was interested in me asked after me and found out I liked dudes. Then he walked up and introduced himself. Two came from being an an event where the majority of men were gay. One came at a monthly event of people I don't usually want to play with. Then halfway through the night, the dude walks in and I couldn't take my eyes off him.   Apps? I use them. But it's a numbers game. There are fakes, shut-ins, pretenders, drug addicts, and idiots. You throw it out there just in case, but don't expect anything back.  Bars? Well, it takes out the shut-ins and fake profiles. Then you've just got idiots to weed through.

The majority of guys on there I don't find attractive, and of the few that I do find attractive haven't responded to my messages (so I'm assuming they don't find me attractive).  I haven't tried Grindr...isn't that more for hook-ups?  I'm not into that; especially for my first MM experience, it definitely needs to be with someone that I know and trust.  Good luck!

gaybros,3beshf,BrandonDarr,2,Sun Jun 28 15:50:45 2015 UTC,"Edit: Hmm I might had had a few drinks when typing this the first time so let me clean it up  Boston is awesome in the Summer but can also be a bit quiet on the gay front as most of the locals head out of the city. If you have time and money I would plan for a weekend in Provincetown. It will give you a nice taste of small town Cape Cod with the bonus of being super gay. If you are interested I would Book a room soon because the number of inns and hotels there is limited. Also plan to take the Provincetown fast ferry over. Worth the cost and no need to have a car at all. Ptown can get expensive but it's a fun little place worth exploring.  As far as gay Boston goes, as someone else mentioned Club Cafe which is a good start. There are other bars around, but they are hit or miss with the crowds depending on the night. Also you can check chrisharrispresents.com which hosts larger ""club"" nights on a rotating schedule but these places are only busy from around 12am-2am. Honestly you might have good luck just asking around on Grindr or something once you get here.  /r/boston has a lot of information in their wiki on more touristy things to do and restaurant suggestions. -https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Boston - Anything in the South End area will be very gay friendly. There is certainly no shortage of local food and drink establishments to explore not to mention the historical aspects of the city."

If your in the business district, the Alley is ok. It's more for bears and older gentlemen but they are very welcoming.

My initial reaction is ""where were you almost 10 years ago when I was watching Brokeback Mountain, almost crying because I thought I wasn't even going to have a boyfriend, much less an on again off again life partner I'd see every time it was time to herd cattle?""  And then I found some crushes that had changed their pics.  ""Is he coming out?  No, that's his girlfriend off to the side there.""  But ultimately, even though I'm a little confused, and have lived in a state that's given full marriage rights for two years now, I'm happy at how far things have come.  I wish it had happened sooner, but I've still got a lifetime ahead to enjoy this new world we're living in."

Texas oral arguments, and that felt like an accomplishment when they ruled against anti-sodomy statutes across the nation.  Now here we are, 12 years later, celebrating this tremendous victory.  Here I am, an older man, just happy to have lived to see this day.  Appreciate this victory, younger gaybros; you have no idea how hard we older guys have fought over the decades just so you can have the choice we couldn't have at your age.  It's one thing to have the right in your state, but entirely another to have it recognized across the whole nation."

gaybros,3bboi8,SSJRanulf,15,Sun Jun 28 03:23:54 2015 UTC,"So surreal that the first thing I did when I woke up this morning was check the news to make sure it was real.   I can't help but imagine how much better this must feel to our older brothers and sisters who have been fighting this fight for decades.   I video called an older gay couple who have been mentors to me for many years now. They were already married in our state but have been activists for LGBT rights for a long time. I have never seen two old tough guys cry like that before. All their hard work, all their hopes and optimism finally come to fruition. It's hard to describe that kind of emotion.   For the first time in my life, I really do feel whole and equal.   Happy for you man. :)"
gaybros,3bboi8,expornregrets,6,Sat Jun 27 18:56:59 2015 UTC,"I'm feeling very similarly. There's this permanent smile plastered to my face. I feel like the world and I are finally coming into harmony.  With that said, there's still a lot to do before the LGBT community has full equality. In Michigan, we can still be refused housing and healthcare just for being gay. I'd bet this is the same in Texas. Sexual orientation is still not a protected class according to the EEOC, so we can be fired (or not hired) for simply being gay. Marriage equality will certainly help advance those laws quicker than before, but it's not over quite yet."

Thinking back to how hostile everything was for us 10/15-ish years ago to now is just surreal. I'm also living in Louisiana where we have the proud distinction of not yet allowing our same sex couples to marry due to our amazingly presidential governor Jindal so maybe that's why it hasn't really hit me yet. Very happy and proud regardless tho.

gaybros,3bboi8,PootyMaGee,3,Sat Jun 27 18:30:27 2015 UTC,"I didn't get too emotional or anything yesterday, but I suppose it's because I'd been sure it was going to happen for quite awhile and I've lived in marriage equality states since 2009.  But the surreal part for me has been the reaction. I grew up in a really conservative area and it's just been a universal outpouring of happiness and support, even from people I never would have expected it from. Facebook is a solid wall of rainbows right now. I think seeing my parents do the whole rainbow thing with their profile photos is what got to me the most."
gaybros,3bboi8,gwoodclone,3,Sat Jun 27 20:57:45 2015 UTC,"It's definitely surreal to know that the debate is over, that this issue—which has weighed so heavily on the hearts of many, and which more than any other issue came to define my social and political outlook—has been definitively won. I also grew up in Texas, and I was entering puberty around the time that the Lawrence ruling came down, before which we did not even have the most basic right to intimacy and privacy. It's sobering to realize that had I been born only half a decade earlier then merely acting upon my sexual desires would have been a prosecutable offence. Of course the social stigma against the very existence of homosexuality was still very pervasive after that decision, and even still is now for some people. But it is deeply gratifying to know that, even if you may be rejected by your family and fired from your job, that at least as a citizen the government now treats your love with equal dignity and respect. I can't help but feel envious of the kids of today's America, because they are growing up in a country that has become more tolerant, more loving."

gaybros,3bboi8,Xeust,2,Sat Jun 27 21:48:21 2015 UTC,"It still has t fully hit yet. I guess because I'm already married. But it was emotional none the less. I still get choked up today just thinking about how things have actually changed. After the ruling one of my friends said it doesn't really apply to me since I'm married, but it does: my mother-in-law lives in Michigan. Heaven forbid if I were to go to the hospital up there and got an asshole nurse, my husband would need my parents permission to see me. So I'm so ecstatic about the ruling, I've been going on for two days now how awesome it is. My family understands, but they'll never know what it's like to be considered a second class citizen and FINALLY have the same rights they've had their whole lives."

We have options, and now we have equal rights. So again. FUCK YOU!"

Hillary has the female-factor and a deluded media willing to sell her as a liberal to fend off an advance from Sanders. Even if Sanders somehow, magically, won the primary, he would lose the general. He's an old white guy, which negates the bump that Hillary will get from being a woman, and what Obama got for being black, thus putting him on a level playing-field with his GOP opponent. On a level playing-field, assuming the GOP put forward a moderate candidate, he will look like the extremist in the context of American politics, and the republicans would have no difficulty painting him as the Radical Socialist, anathema to the American people.  Given his unelectability, the institutional Democrats will ensure he loses the primary by putting their full support behind Clinton."

In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.   The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed.  It is so ordered."

They  fell in love and started a life together, establishing a lasting, committed relation.   In 2011, however, Arthur was  diagnosed with amyotrophic la teral sclerosis, or ALS. This debilitating disease is  progressive, with no known  cure.   Two years ago, Obergefell and Arthur decided to commit to one another, resolving to marry before Arthur died.  To fulfill their mutual promise, they traveled from Ohio to Maryland, where same-sex marriage was legal.  It  was difficult for Arthur to mo ve, and so the couple were  wed inside a medical transport plane as it remained on the tarmac in Baltimore.  Three months later, Arthur died.  Ohio law does not permit Obergefell to be listed as the surviving spouse on Arthur’s death certificate.  By statute,  they must remain strangers even in death, a state- imposed separation Obergefell deems “hurtful for the rest of time.”  App. in No. 14–556 etc., p. 38.

gaybros,3b6zqe,WJ90,3,Fri Jun 26 14:20:48 2015 UTC,"There were, iirc, 14 states that still had active bans. At this point, most states will simply follow the ruling and allow marriage licenses to be given to same-sex couples. However, it's not unimaginable that the most reluctant states will wait until lower courts officially order them to do so.  Technically, this opinion applies only to states under the Sixth Circuit: Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee. It does establish a clear precedent, however. That means lower courts across the nation will simply issue a summary judgement in favor of same-sex marriage, ordering the holdout states to immediately grant licenses to same-sex couples."
gaybros,3b6zqe,dhicock,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:19:32 2015 UTC,"Be default those bans are nullified.  While only the bound ruling is final, the change is immediate.

gaybros,3b6zqe,PastyJournalist,5,Sat Jun 27 15:25:48 2015 UTC,"While it's not a case about workplace discrimination, it could have been a precedent in workplace discrimination cases - because it could have been based on the theory that (a) homosexuality is a suspect classification under the fourteenth amendment, (b) homosexuality is therefore subject to some form of heightened scrutiny, and (c) therefore same sex marriage bans fail.

gaybros,3bb6zs,Akabutz,2,Sat Jun 27 15:28:37 2015 UTC,"Schöneberg is the traditional West-side gay district. It's nice. Honestly, I didn't go out there much. Just wasn't feeling the vibe. Many of the younger gays will be in the former East-Berlin, as this is where the rent bargains are to be found. Many of the clubs catering to them will be over that way as well.  Definitely rent a bicycle one day and ride from Schöneberg up through the Tiergarten. The entire area is beautiful on a nice day, but the scale is too big for walking. It is perfect for bike.  Most of the most famous museums are on Museum Island, or within a few minutes walk. Of these, the  Pergamon is the crown jewel and you should expect to spend several hours there if you are interested in classical history. The Cathedral is nice as well.  Tour the dome of the Reichstag. You will need to sign up on-line several days in advance to book an appointment, and remember to bring your passport. Totally worth the trouble. It is unique in the world-- not only beautiful, but also a massive bit of engineering, functioning as a heat-exchanger and providing light for the building.  Berlin is known for radical sexuality. Our modern concept of ""gay"" originated there during the period between wars, which was the Weimar Republic. Everything that would later come to New York and California that we think of as gay rights or gay culture....  Anyway, that period is mostly forgotten, but the radical sexuality remains. In fact, some of what goes on would be shocking to half the readers of this sub. And that's just Monday night. If you feel extreme, Laboratory is a club in a former power plant on the East side. Look it up and read reviews so you know what goes on before you step in (dancing, fucking, and fetish parties).   For something less radical, and fairly civilized, Der Boiler is a gay bathhouse. Consider going even if it sounds not-your-thing. European sexuality is much more open and less dark than American sexuality, and it can be very transformative to see it in person."

And I'm 100% fine with the fetish parties (Planning on going to Laboratory on Friday)... I've been to sex parties here as well, there's no shame in going to berlin for the crazy sex! If you've got more recommendations, Id love to hear them."
gaybros,3bb6zs,someone_like_me,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:26:40 2015 UTC,"Oh, shit dude. I just looked up the Pergamon and discovered that the main exhibits are closed until 2019 for some re-engineering. There are a few minor exhibits that might be worth seeing. The museum goes with your ""not art"" theme... It's reconstructed remains of classical ruins gathered by German archeologists during the days of the empire. http://www.smb.museum/en/museums-and-institutions/pergamonmuseum/home.html  Other ""not art"" museums might include the Stasi Museum, which is the headquarters of the East German secret police. It is definitely a museum for Germans as opposed to tourists. Only about half the exhibits have English explanations and the staff doesn't speak English. My German is less than miserable... it might be better if you have a good speaker (reader) along.  There is a DDR Museum tucked into a dock next to the river... It's mostly for kids (someplace for families to take the kids to show them the clothes they wore, the appliances, jobs and such). Worth a quick visit even for adults.

But they do leave an allocation for people who miss online. There is a little kiosk opposite the Parliament building, on the Tiergarten side, where you can book a ticket in person. You just line up with your passport and pick a day and time. I thought it was really worth the trip, it is an amazing piece of architecture.  Also check out the East Side Gallery, that is where the largest remaining pieces of the Berlin wall are located. The train network was really easy to negotiate even for a non-german speaking person. Across the bridge was a cool little neighbourhood, not sure of the name though, very arty/hipstery but had a great selection of restaurants.  You should definitely check out the Holocaust museum. It is located underneath the large monument to the murdered Jews just behind the US Embassy. Very sombering but a worthwhile experience.  I loved Berlin, had such a great vibe. Hope you have a great time there."

The amazing part of this ruling is what it represents at the nation-wide level. More and more people are realizing that homosexuality is not a choice and that gays and lesbians deserve equal rights. Sure, our respective families may not ever change their minds, but the views of those around them are changing. Children growing up now can perceive homosexuality as something that even the government doesn't recognize as a second class anymore. Once people begin to realize that giving gay people rights does not result in the downfall of society, they'll begin to start questioning their original prejudices."

gaybros,3b6zol,ubergeek77,29,Fri Jun 26 14:18:32 2015 UTC,"Yep, NOW, it's just like that! In the majority ruling, they decided that it is unconstitutional for states to ban same sex marriage while affording the same marriage to opposite sex couples, using a combination of prior rulings, notably the one that invalidated states' bans on interracial marriage. This means that each state ban against same-sex marriage is unconstitutional. This is part of the Equal Protections Clause (and the Due Process).  They also ruled that states must recognize marriages performed in other states, since this is directly related to the aforementioned clauses. I think they referenced the 14th amendment a few times.  It may take a little while to ""kick in"" fully, but this is it - SSM is fully legal, nationwide."

While their rights to practice their religion is protected, like wearing a yarmulke in prison (even if there are rules against head coverings) as part of their practicing of Judaism, they aren't protected from other people, including government officials and businesses, discriminating against them by claiming it is a violation of their religious beliefs."

gaybros,3b7w8l,GreatBallsOfH20,2,Fri Jun 26 22:52:47 2015 UTC,"I think the courts decision makes it quite clear that religion has no place when it comes to marriage.   Unfortunately, it does not.   The Court simply ruled that states cannot deny same sex couples the right to marry and must recognize those performed out of state, but the ruling in no way addresses conscientious objectors who may work at those clerk's offices. The court has time to clarify, but because the case they were ruling on was not about religious exemptions like these, it would be very unusual and questionable for the Court to answer a question it wasn't asked.  It's possible that it could require another SCOTUS case to answer that question, but more than likely a lower court will rule that public employees cannot claim such an exception and the SCOTUS will refuse to take up the issue and the ruling will stand.   Still, it's something that will remain unsettled for some time."

But they get exponentially more manageable because you can brush them off in 1 second instead of 10.

I kind of feel like every month adds another hour until your next urge. So at two months I would crave every two hours etc. It just gets easier as you go, and at a certain point you don't want to destroy the progress that you've already made. I still have light cravings maybe every other day, but i'd rather have that then crave every thirty minutes like I used to."

Getting rejected by them is like not sacking the football team's captain - it's no compliment, but join the rest of the vast majority. I know of a couple of my old colleagues that went to work for either ended up taking a pay cut (either actually or realized due to significantly higher cost of living) simply for the prestige of having that on your resume. If they can get someone with more experience for less or equivalent compensation, you betcha they're going to - it's not necessarily a statement about your competence.  I've also worked on a couple of Tesla projects through the engineering firm I work for - I've heard that burnout is a very real concern, so you may have been spared countless 60 hour work weeks (small consolation, I know)!"

gaybros,3b5aoy,aj_reddit_gaybi,5,Fri Jun 26 03:17:53 2015 UTC,"In many countries it is. In the U.S., it will be regular hours for regular work. But if you are hooked into tech, then there is no regular anything.   That's because your salary will be be partly in the form of stock options-- particularly with startup companies which have insane hours-- and also bonuses based on things like product launches.  If you are young and want to do weird stuff while maybe socking away cash, and you love the company, it can be fun to work long hours. But it can be tough for having a family life, or if you want a long vacation to travel someplace. So after a while, people look for exits from that lifestyle.  Some of the more advanced advance tech companies have realized the problem and have started giving sabbaticals. So you work crazy hours for two years, and then you run away for three months and chase your dream of Everest, or Chile, or whatever."
gaybros,3b5aoy,someone_like_me,3,Fri Jun 26 03:44:00 2015 UTC,"That, and/or they can afford to lose people? If it takes ~2-3 years for somebody to just burn out, then depending on:  -how fast they're growing,   how long it would take to retrain somebody, and whether the project is now more/less finished and the next project requires retraining anyway,   it seems like they could enjoy a fair amount of turnover in their engineers. It could even work for the employees, assuming that by the time they're finished at the company they want a different lifestyle and they now have the credibility/expertise that they can find a higher position in a lesser-valued company with more sane hours."
gaybros,3b5aoy,iceaxethrow,3,Fri Jun 26 03:56:15 2015 UTC,"Depending on the field, it takes a whole lot of money to hire a good engineer. There's the search, the interview process, the weeks of training before they start doing valuable work, plus firing the one you hire that turns out to suck.  That's why so many tech companies invest in intern programs for college students. It's a stealth hiring process. You not only find out which college seniors are worth hiring, you also get them to bring in their friends. Compared to the cost of doing all the recruitment fairs and interviewing candidates, college interns seem cheap.  Anyway, advanced tech companies-- the same ones that burn out their employees-- really hate to lose a decent performer. They are sociopathic that way. A friend of mine just walked out of a company that had shafted him for years in a dozen ways, but when he gave them notice they shit themselves. The CEO came to talk to him about what went wrong."
gaybros,3b5aoy,someone_like_me,3,Fri Jun 26 04:02:24 2015 UTC,"I feel like the career path for a lot of people in the industry is to work your ass off for a prestigious company in your 20's/early 30's, and then as you get older and work-life balance starts becoming more important, become a consultant or take a managerial role in a smaller company."
gaybros,3b5aoy,loki8481,2,Fri Jun 26 13:46:10 2015 UTC,"This is probably just my cynicism leaking out, but I think a number of them do it because they can. They know that a good number of people are there because of the prestige, so they can demand more from their employees (people begging to work there can't be picky about hours, etc).  There are of course the smaller ""in"" companies that need it because they can't afford two engineers to do the work they need, and will hopefully compensate you later when they're finally in a position to do so."

gaybros,3b5aoy,bur8erry,2,Fri Jun 26 04:29:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I knew about the work load going in. It probably sounds crazy, but that would actually be refreshing (for a time) after the total apathy I'm surrounded by on a regular basis. At least everyone cares enough to try to deliver.   As for being hard on myself, I'm actually really proud that I made it as far as I did. They flew me in, and my presentation generated a lot of buzz (both for its technical content and unorthodox delivery method). The reason they gave for passing on me was pretty minor, so I feel great overall. If nothing else, it reflected well on my skills and viability as an engineer in the market. I just need to find somewhere else exciting."
gaybros,3b5aoy,ridemyscooter,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:36:37 2015 UTC,"So I assume that you're doing engineering, I just graduated with my degree in EE and I can give you some tips:  1) this is the most important one, you will get far more rejections than job offers, so the trick is not to get disappointed every time you get rejected, just keep your head up and keep applying.  2) some other users have said this but, those big, hot, tech companies are really hard to get into.  Try going to your campus recruiting office and try to get them to look over your resume and go to job fairs and such, but I would look into defense contractors or the govt because they are usually easier to get into.  I work for the federal govt and I got a great job out of college and I work 40 hrs a week, because I have heard that a lot of big tech companies will work you to death.  These are just some tips that I learned, hopefully it helps, and good luck!"
gaybros,3b5aoy,someone_like_me,7,Mon Jun 29 16:21:03 2015 UTC,"I was on a few colleges doing engineering recruitment about two years back. Our booth had no line. Every student who visited us got 5-15 minutes of personal time with a senior engineer.  The Tesla booth... man, it was about a block long at every fair. People waited in line for what must have been an hour, just to get their resume into the stack and shake a hand.  Apple was long as well, but Tesla was the ""it"" company.  So yeah, getting a job is like investing.... you not only want to find a great company, but you have to find a great company before everyone else finds it. There are plenty of engineering jobs out there that will get you out of town. If Tesla was willing to spend six hours with you, there are others that will give you an offer on the spot."
gaybros,3b5aoy,enigma1945,2,Fri Jun 26 02:52:13 2015 UTC,"Aww, thanks. I'm sure there are lots out there, but I'm sure having a hard time finding them. I feel like it might be easier with a network, but the place I work actively discourages contact with the outside world (isolated town, no conferences, conventions, off-site training, or even customer visits), so most of my network consists of members of the same cult fellow employees who would think I'm crazy for leaving the great leader such an amazing, wonderful place.   In any case, I'm putting a lot of resumes out there. I know I'll find something eventually."
gaybros,3b5aoy,erock82,3,Fri Jun 26 13:44:50 2015 UTC,"Yup, just happened to me, was having the 2nd interview for a major real estate company that would have doubled my income, provided me with fantastic benefits that far outstrip what I currently have, and that would have relocated me to be close to my family in Arizona by next year, but, mid-way through the interview, this old lady who shares office space with my company, keyed into my office while I was still on lunch and still on my interview, and loudly started berating me about picking up some money she needed for a 4th of July event. I apologized to the interviewers for the interruption, and they asked,""Are you at work?"" I stated I was on lunch, and the person they heard had the habit of entering my office when she felt the need. About the time I got done explaining that and we went on with the interview, she again keyed into my office and demanded I move my car so she could leave, and I then had to try to talk to them while walking down the sidewalk with her following, demanding to know who I was talking to.  They said they would,""Get back to me."" Yeah...three days later Im not holding my breath and im applying to other places like my ass is on fire because if I dont get away from her, bad things will happen sooner rather than later."

Overall 5 hours of interviews and was really feeling good about it. I got the call from the recruiter, could hardly contain my excitement until I heard the worst words of my life. ""We chose another candidate."" I was crushed. My dream job at my dream company slipped right through my fingers, and it killed me. Fast forward 6 months, I reconnected with my recruiter on Linkedin, chatted a bit, she said she might be able to get me back in front of some people, I came in and boom! got a job right out of the gate because they remembered me and felt this position was a better fit. I learned so much through that experience, I'm happier it took me two times instead of just getting it the first time.

gaybros,3b5aoy,loki8481,2,Tue Jun 30 04:06:37 2015 UTC,"Out of college, I was selected as a finalist for a Red Bull marketing rotational program that would have sent me all over the world. The interview challenge event was a weekend (yes, a weekend) long. After an awesome time, no sleep and a week or two of thinking I had it in the bag, I was not extended an offer.   Super bummed at first. As a marketing guy and adrenaline junkie into Red Bull-type hobbies, I didn't want to work for anyone else. Red Bull is a marketing company and content powerhouse that happens to produce beverage products (literally costs cents per can for them to produce). The fact they're able to slap that steep of a premium on their product means they have a marketing /r/massivecock.  Considerations: * With hot companies like Red Bull (and Tesla), it turns into a numbers game. 2500 people applied for that Red Bull job. I was 1 of 100 finalists. They hired 10. Out of the whole US. Even if you're the best of the best, everyone else is, too. Take a step back and look at the math. The fact you got to final interviews at Tesla is something that should be celebrated. * Be self-aware in that if you are of the caliber to reach final interviews at Tesla, you can reach final interviews at comparable companies. Stop moping around about Tesla and pursue the other top 50 innovative companies you'd want to work for. * As others have mentioned, the grass is often greener. Venture backed- or tech- life is hard. (PM me) * ""No"" doesn't mean ""never."" Often, ""no"" means ""not right now."" Who knows, maybe you WILL wind up at Tesla when it's a better fit (for them or you) down the road?   IMO, you should be damn proud you made it to final interviews at Tesla. Take that newfound pride and rampage through applications to the rest of your shortlist. Congratulations!"

I compare it to how my fathers handles my sexuality...he doesnt talk about it or acknowledge it. To me personally, thats more hurtful. Your co-workers are showing you that they acknowledge you're gay, and they feel comfortable enough to not only talk about it, but have some fun with it. After all, people love to poke a little fun at people for anything and everything. For example, think about when a straight guy's wife is over controlling. It's fun to say, ""oh, I see she let you off your leash tonight, lets go to the bar!"".   But point being, being around out gay people is still ""new"" for a lot of folks. New things make people uncomfortable. I think the entrance song thing is funny! Next time, you should turn it around on them and be like, ""Hey, I don't know whose iphone this is, but if you ever need to talk about some issues or feelings, let me know"".

Really disappointing, but I'm still a huge Fire Emblem fan and this is a step forward.  It's uplifting that even an old, traditional, Japanese company like Nintendo listened to the backlash from Fire Emblem Awakening and then Tomodachi Life, and are starting to fix things. I think they've kept the gay characters so limited as a way of gauging public reaction before going further."

What is the secret to be a great lover? Lito: I've never thought about it. But, I guess... First, you have to be selfless. The pleasure of your lover must become your own.

gaybros,3azm2a,smalleyed,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:16:53 2015 UTC,"To be honest Nomi is the one that makes less sense. Sun can fight because she lives in a society where she's always been repressed. Lito can lie because he's an actor and closeted. With Nomi it seems like they just gave her a convenient skill that has nothing to do with her past, just a nice thing to have. I'd be ok with it, if it weren't for the fact that that particular skill plays such a big role in the series."
gaybros,3azm2a,fabulousmarco,3,Thu Jun 25 10:23:10 2015 UTC,"Nomi was a teen hacker who grows up to program in Silicone Valley. It's a grounding past, which helps Nomi's mother justify her bigoted narrative, to herself. Her ""son"" is just troubled, punishing her, equating the ""deviancy"" of transitioning is akin to criminal hacking gives the mother further resolve that her ""son"" needs to be fixed.  I think that makes more sense than the initial presentation of a CFO from an incredibly wealthy company being able to destroy guys three times her size.

There's gay love, trans (lesbian) love, a forced marriage, motherly love, fatherly love, straight love, etc. If you actually think about it, the show has a bit of every type of love you can imagine. I don't think it's forced one bit. And if you follow through with the show, the gay storyline isn't over the top."

People still struggle in the closet, leave it he. You don't have to like the show or agree with me. Geeze man. I was afraid to come out just like a lot of people. It took a lot of inner strength acceptance and courage . I thought id lose my friends and my family, the people that were closest to me and that i cared about.

gaybros,3azhri,priestofazathoth,4,Wed Jun 24 19:20:23 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of interesting oppositions between Maurice's relationship with Clive and Alec. They both begin with somebody bursting through the window, but in the one case, it is Maurice climbing in to see Clive and in the other it is Alec climbing in to see Maurice. Clive is upper class, while Alec is lower class. Clive's love is cold and intellectual, while Alec's is warm and physical.  Speaking of, how incredible is it that Alec and Maurice explicitly sleep together not just once, but twice! Now, admittedly, Forster does the PG-13 cut away as they get into bed and show them in bed the next morning thing, but even that is pretty rare to see, especially considering that this was written over a century ago. The funniest part of the whole novel must be when Maurice begins to tell Clive about sleeping with Alec, and all Clive can do is splutter helplessly.  There is also the brief return of the Greek theme, as Maurice and Alec hash out their relationship with each other in the British Museum, where they are surrounded by Greek antiquities and also get a surprise visit from Mr. Ducie. All of this is to represent the old rules and conventions which continuously frustrate their desire to be together. The pantomime that takes place in the museum, where Alec pretends to blackmail Maurice, was both a funny and bittersweet look at how these kinds of relationships are 'supposed' to end (i.e. horribly). Maurice's realization that neither he nor Alec are in the wrong for loving one another is in itself quite revolutionary.   I think that it's also worth looking at Maurice and Alec's final escape to the 'greenwood.' It reminded me of Shakespeare's As You Like It, where various characters go to the Forest of Arden and find love free from the constraints of class and gender. I think that it was important to Forster that they didn't leave England to be with each other. Despite his pointed criticisms of the English attitude toward homosexuality, it's clear that he really loves his country (you said last week that it was the most British novel you've ever read, and I would have to agree) and would not want to abandon it.  I'm voting for LeGuin, but only because I have already read the Mishima."
gaybros,3azhri,narcissus_goldmund,2,Thu Jun 25 04:22:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, Alec is the polar opposite of Clive, and I think he suits Maurice a lot better.  Maurice was never as intellectual or political as Clive--they probably wouldn't have lasted even if Clive had stayed gay.  Whereas Alec and Maurice seem to have fairly similar personalities.    I was also really surprised that they had had sex, I thought for sure I was just misunderstanding until Maurice straight-up told Clive.  And Clive's hypocrisy during that scene really made me dislike him.  If I were to turn straight right this instant, I'd like to think that I'd still be able to empathize with and support my still-gay friends, instead of suddenly acting like I find them disgusting."

gaybros,3azhri,narcissus_goldmund,3,Wed Jun 24 20:03:49 2015 UTC,"Now that we've completed the book, I want to revisit the discussion about the straightening of Clive and it's impact on the narrative. Was it the correct choice as opposed to Clive choosing a straight life style for respectability while still remaining homo. If Clive, as a choice, were to deny his homosexuality he would be a direct instrument to Maurice's pain, and as such, there would be a more hostile attitude towards him. That he didn't mean to go straight, he's less accountable for his action, and there's more finality in that Clive and Maurice would reunited. However, there's a lingering hope that union would happen anyway because as quickly as Clive went straight, I'd reasoned that he'd be able to just as quick turn gay. But that he didn't chose to be gay, weakened the emotional content of the ending. There's regret, but not to an extent had Clive chosen his straight lifestyle.   I love this closing passage:   Maurice opened his hand. Luminous petals appeared in it. ""You care for me a little bit, I do think,"" he admitted, ""but I can't hang all my life on a little bit. You don't. You hang yours on Anne. You don't worry whether your relation with her is platonic or not, you only know it's big enough to hang a life on. I can't hang mine on to the five minutes you spare me from her and politics. You'll do anything for me except see me. That's been it for this whole year of Hell. You'll make me free of the house, and take endless bother to marry me off, because that puts me off your hands. You do care a little for me, I know"" — for Clive had protested — ""but nothing to speak of, and you don't love me. I was yours once till death if you'd cared to keep me, but I'm someone else's now — I can't hang about whining for ever — and he's mine in a way that shocks you, but why don't you stop being shocked, and attend to your own happiness?""   Edward Carpenter and George Merrill, particularly Carpenter living through an experience similar to Maurice: https://babylonbaroque.wordpress.com/2011/02/09/edward-carpenter-and-george-merrilla-love-beyond-class-convention-and-law/  Love notes between the two: http://rictornorton.co.uk/carpente.htm  I tried to watch the film Maurice, but Maurice is so different physically from the book's Maurice that it's hard to get settled into it.

I agree that he would have been a much more interesting character if it had been a choice, as we could have explored his reasoning and potential regrets.  As it is, it kind of seems like Clive 'got lucky', and was handed an 'easy way out', rather than having to figure out a way to live with his homosexuality as Maurice did.  Thanks for sharing that about those two Victorian lovers... that made me happy.  It's nice to see a positive story from that era for once."

gaybros,3az4nt,rylandmaine,3,Wed Jun 24 17:44:13 2015 UTC,"r/portland is very active, so that's a good place to start.  http://www.portlandbridges.com/portland-neighborhoods/ is one of several sites that serve as a guide for neighborhoods / districts in Portland.    Housing in Portland can be a little tight due to high demand.  Goose Hollow, NW 23rd, Mississippi Ave and SE Portland are all popular areas in that price range; spendier stuff in Downtown / Pearl District.  Too many bars to count.  Portland has an extreme abundance of pubs and nightlife.  I've been here 3 years and only scratched the surface."
gaybros,3az4nt,RainyDay676,2,Wed Jun 24 18:21:45 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thanks for the guide.  How's your experience been moving to Portland? Where were you from before?  I'm hoping Portland doesn't have the same mentality as Seattle where it's very hard for newcomers to become integrated (the Seattle freeze). Have you experienced this?
gaybros,3az4nt,RainyDay676,2,Wed Jun 24 18:36:04 2015 UTC,"Some Portland natives can be snobs about 'transplants' as they're called, especially if the transplant in question is from California, but for the most part, the people here are beyond phenomenal.  Intelligent, light-hearted, progressive, creative and of course a bit weird (in a good way).  I've been in Portland for 3 years now; prior to that I live in Corvallis (during college) and I'm originally from the Bend area.  One thing I love about Portland is you can get just about anywhere by walking, biking or taking mass transit.  You don't really have to depend on a car to get most places.  My first year here I live in the South Waterfront and I walked to work downtown.  That was the best morning commute ever.  Also the Portland tech industry is actually pretty big, and it's why I moved here.  Lots of great software companies, startup shops, and some bigger tech companies in the region like Intel."

gaybros,3az4nt,happydontwait,3,Thu Jun 25 00:50:08 2015 UTC,"8 years a PDX gaybro. Welcome to Portland!   There's been a huge influx of people recently, but I'm sure you can find housing in your price range. Goose Hollow is a great area right now, SE runs a close second. Lloyd Center used to be trashy, but they are building a ton of upscale housing there now and I expect it to turn around real quick.  I highly recommend going to Silverado and Stag at least once. Portland has the loosest stripper laws in the country and the men there are amazing. There's a bar 'integration' going on as all 'straight' bars are inclusive and the gay bars are dying, for better or worse. Personally I haven't gone to a gay bar in ages, and have no problems with that.  There are incredible outdoorsy activities available. The forests are all around us and offer incredible adventures. I recommend you leaving town any opportunity you get.   Rooster Rock and Sauvie's are the local gay nude beaches (on the Columbia). Both are great, check out both while the summer is here!  I feel like this is a very brief synopsis. If you have any other questions, feel free to PM me."

I decided to live in Lake Oswego (suburb just south of Portland in case you're like me and had never heard of it) because it's close to my job, and from what I was able to find, rent was all in the $1000+ range both downtown and in Lake Oswego.  I found a 1 bedroom apartment with a loft for around $1100ish a month.  From what I was told, housing is super competitive due to high demand and low supply.  I heard it's not uncommon to apply for several apartments before finally getting one.  I got lucky and got the first apartment I applied for, but I'm pretty sure that's because I'm in a suburb, so YMMV.  Racquetball is probably my favorite sport right now, so I'm trying to find a place to play.  I haven't really looked, and I think I'll just wait until I get there.  And once I get settled, I'll start looking for gyms.  I'm also looking to get a bike because of all the trails around the city and surrounding area.  I have the same questions about bars and the gay scene lol.  When do you get to Portland?  I'm trying to figure out the best ways to meet people.  Message me if you want to go exploring together or something when you get to Portland."

gaybros,3ayvp2,materhern,2,Wed Jun 24 17:09:23 2015 UTC,"The current Secret Wars is nothing like the original. It's actually the culmination of pretty much every run Jonathan Hickman has had at Marvel over the past couple of years (including Secret Warriors, Avengers, New Avengers, Fantastic Four, FF (Future Foundation) and even his Ultimates run) and what most of the MU has been building toward for the last few years.   It's a daunting series, for sure, but I haven't read much of anything leading up to it (I read the FF and Fantastic Four runs by Hickman previously) and it's still a lot of fun."

We're finally getting to that point that we both have that mental telepathy thing going on, but never assume he knows what you're thinking. Trust me. Lots of fights in the beginning about stupid stuff, when we ""thought"" we knew something. Like ""I thought..."" or ""I told you...""   Last thought. Remember they're a person too. Allow him his time and space. You don't have to be 5 feet from him, and vise versa. Go out with your friends sometimes alone. It allows you time to continue to be the person you've always been, and allow each of you to maintain outside friendships. Bonus is you have new stories to tell. Again trust me that ""Me and Jimmy on a camping trip"" story is only so good...until the 15th time.

We had grown apart from that affection we once had, him more than I. What I had learned was that I had become dependent on his company. Whenever he's gone or I was home alone, a little part of me was insecure. At the same time as growing apart, I had formed this bond that made me not want to let him go. I even imagined us getting married in the future, his parents at a beautiful wedding and us teaching at the same school, him and I coming together to put on the best musical the school would ever see, as well as the best chemistry magic shows that would astound many.   But, this future has disappeared. I dream of it every now and them; however, I fear it's gone from me forever. We had grown to hate some of the small quirks which we used to love, we lost that special love we had to the point we had a physical altercation twice.   And now me about to move in two weeks, leaving on a note so sour, I feel nothing but regret and remorse. I hate the things that have happened, I hate some things he can't change, and I know he feels the same, but I can't stop loving him. Living with someone you love really changes you and if it goes amazingly, your love can blossom; however, if things happen like it did with me, your love can vanish and all will remain is ashes.   I guess what's not really said about moving in with someone is, be prepared. There are an innumerable amount of variables that you can't account for and they can either drive you from each other or bring you closer."

As for the sexuality, honestly, its fun to theorize and fantasize, but Peter Parkers story is inextricably connected with Mary Jane.  You might be able to gloss over Gwen Stacy, but not freaking Mary Jane."
gaybros,3av7l6,materhern,59,Tue Jun 23 19:48:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Not to mention that every article so far has shown a rather annoying inability to differentiate Spiderman from Peter Parker. The contract between Sony and Marvel, where much of this hubbub stems from--States that Spiderman is representative of the ego that portrays him. All it says is that Parker is to remain the same. Period. Even Lee's quotes say that. He is talking about Peter Parker. Not Spiderman.   This is why new characters are created and handed the ""helm"" of said superhero. They want to tell their on unique stories. Why paint Peter Parker black and change Mary Jane to Mark John in a desperate attempt to spread diversity that can still be representative of that hero through positive characters like Miles? Changing the race or sexuality of an ego character ""just because"" doesn't add to  the Spiderman story. Creating an entirely new character with their own struggles and joys does add to Spiderman though.  So if Miles portrays Spiderman, guess what? Spiderman is black for that movie, according to the contract.  The people running around screaming that Parker needs to change to show diversity don't understand how diversity works and can't seem to grasp that Spiderman=/=Parker."

gaybros,3av7l6,cortex112,-5,Wed Jun 24 05:11:36 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I don't see why the skin color of Peter Parker is so important to its character. Donald Glover would have made a great spiderman. James bond is now blond and nobody is making a fuss about it. The color of the skin isn't a personality trait, it should be a minor detail.  Being black has no incident on the screenplay as opposed to changing the sexuality of the character. Why should it be a problem?  The problem is that, since all that hollywood producers are doing now  is going into their  attics to get old fashioned dusty comics and ask screenwriters to write movies based on them, we get tons of Super Hero movies with characters created in the sixties (straight  white male and underwritten female characters).   Hollywood can't bet money on a brand new super hero that would be black for instance because the movie will not have any fanbase etc... It's too risky for them and people would actually laugh at their attempt to create a super Hero movie from scratch (it's Marvel and DC comic's job).  One can  say, ""well, there are still other movies being produced in which minority actors can have a role""! Not really since minority people aren't needed in the plethora of Historical movies (unless it's about slavery or servants) and that they tend to be refused gender/sexuality neutral roles (If the racial issue if not a component of the screenplay, the cast is automatically white).  That's why I would have welcomed seeing a black actor cast as spiderman."
gaybros,3av7l6,IdontSparkle,14,Wed Jun 24 14:20:05 2015 UTC,"There isn't anything inherently wrong with making Peter Parker black... but why do it?  Miles Morales is a perfectly good Spiderman (I like him better than Peter Parker, personally) so why just write him off? I'd rather see a Miles Morales Spiderman than another Peter Parker.  I don't see a reason for him to be gay, either. The common themes of Spiderman stories (growing up, being honest with yourself, living up to the expectations other's set for you) isn't an exclusively straight thing. He could be gay, but that's ignoring that much of his history is tied with Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane. Now it's too late to change.  I'd rather see a shift in the way current gay characters are treated. Wiccan and Hulkling have been swept under the rug, and they're two married superheros who started out as closeted gay teenagers. But I'm willing to bet the vast majority of people, and probably a lot of comics fans, haven't ever heard of them.  Also, it actually is kind of important that Peter Parker be white. His father was a secret agent who infiltrated the Red Skull's inner circle. That's what lead to his death."
gaybros,3av7l6,actuallygayteenager,-5,Wed Jun 24 06:00:57 2015 UTC,"There isn't anything inherently wrong with making Peter Parker black... but why do it?   Why not? It doesn't require any change in the screenplay. They can just have auditions for black and white actors.   Miles Morales is a perfectly good Spiderman so why just write him off?   Write him off of what? He's not on any screenplays in hollywood.  Because wer're not going to see Miles Morales AND a Peter Parker franchise at the same time.   It's the thrid franchise they're making with a white Spiderman. Nobody in Hollywood is even considering changing its character. A Miles Morales movie will never get made in our lifetime. Even Hant Man was judged more feasible than a Miles Morales spiderman movie...   He could be gay, but that's ignoring that much of his history is tied with Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane. Now it's too late to change.   My comment explicitedly said sexuality was a different issue and I put that away because it would require changes of the screenplay and the characters; Whiile a skin color doesn't change anything.   Also, it actually is kind of important that Peter Parker be white. His father was a secret agent who infiltrated the Red Skull's inner circle. That's what lead to his death.   White fathers can have black children. Moreover the Red Skull part was excluded of the first trilogy. Most Marvel Movies didn't feature the entire mythology surrounding the characters (they're only 2 hrs long), they can put some story arcs aside like they did plenty of times already."

If Sony chooses to use Miles, Spiderman is black now.  The contract specifically says they can portray Spiderman as essentially any of his egos, as Spiderman is representative of anything Marvel has chosen to portray him as.   Even Stan Lee is talking about Parker--Not Spiderman.  All these articles are horrible at understanding that difference, as is anyone upset about ""OMG Peter can't be black and gay.""---Yeah, you're right...because Marvel would rather make a unique character with their own stories and feelings and have them take the Spiderman mantle, like Miles did. Stan Lee confirms that with his last bit."

I think what Stan Lee means to say is that Peter Parker should stay straight and white, and I'm okay with that.  However I don't think Spider-Man should stay white and straight and neither does Stan Lee.  Ultimately it's up to Marvel Studios who have released 11 movies in a row with a straight white male lead."

They may have asked him in the article if he agreed with it or not, but he doesn't get to make that call, just like he likely didn't a say in new spin offs.  In fact, is doesn't actually have a ton to do with most Marvel decisions at all any more.  He's more of an icon to the company now."

What he actually says in the article:   “I wouldn’t mind, if Peter Parker had originally been black, a Latino, an Indian or anything else, that he stay that way,” he said. “But we originally made him white. I don’t see any reason to change that.”   I believe Stan Lee is a very kind man who inspired the imaginations of millions and I don't see him having any real interest in bolstering the cultural power of white men.  He created these characters in a time where the world wasn't mindful of diversity and I don't fault him for that.  I just think that he loves his characters that he has known for decades.  I would LOVE to see Miles Morales as Spider-Man.  Especially in the Marvel Cinematic Universe because we've seen three versions of Peter Parker in 10 years and its getting a little jarring."

gaybros,3av7l6,smalleyed,2,Wed Jun 24 19:39:03 2015 UTC,being a comic book nerd and a somewhat purist i think agree that it makes sense that characters stay how they have always been but i can understand why people would want characters to change.   all these characters come from a time where being gay and even being a person of color wasn't an approved thing. let's say we're able to set time backwards and during that time it was ok to be gay and a person of color. What would the X-Men look like? what would Spider Man look like? How many characters would be gay? How many people poc's would there be?   No matter how much we progress as a society there will be markers in current history that give us hints as to what culture and societal norms were. It is indirectly perpetuating the homophobic and racial tensions of that time.  If theres a slight chance that some of those wrongs could be changed in the present then why not try it?   There are a bunch of Looney Toons skits that are super racist. Networks won't play those episodes anymore and if you buy boxed sets nowadays they are usually edited out. From a historical and purists standpoint I love watching those. It's amazing what they got away with back in the day but all together they are wrong. I'm glad that they're choosing to take them out. People don't need to see that and its some pretty messed up stuff.
gaybros,3av7l6,freshtopperz,2,Wed Jun 24 19:42:29 2015 UTC,"The problem is that most of our beloved superheroes were created during a time when white and heterosexual were really the only things the characters could be. People of color and GSMs are far and few between in the comic book world. Yeah, new ones could be created, but what are the odds of these projects being backed and eventually making it to the big screen? I just think it's unfortunate that we're held hostage to the traditions and ideals of the 60s and earlier, when many of these comic books were written. I don't get it. I'm just as much a fan of these movies as anyone else, but changing the race or sexuality of these superheroes would not make them any less exciting to me. I'm not sure why that's the case for others. Does it somehow dilute the story for you? I've just never seen their whiteness or their heterosexuality as being integral to their character."
gaybros,3av7l6,thestrugglesreal,3,Thu Jun 25 15:06:14 2015 UTC,"Well, yea it does dilute them. Imagine if you're favorite gay character was turned straight (Constantine in every movie or tv adaption rather than bi) it sucks because you identified with him before and now he doesn't feel like ""yours"". Now obviously it means more to gay people due to the numbers game, but straight people still feel that way.   It would be like making Peter Parker a full blown adult or very serious rather than a young white straight New Yorker. It's a part of the single most popular superhero in the worlds identity. Taking any of that away (PP Spiderman I mean not a different mantle spiderman like miles) is nigh blasphemy."

He's such a different character (and in my opinion a better one) deals with far more complex issues than Peter ever did.   Super heroes down to their core are nothing but mantles. They change hands constantly. This should not be an issue, unless the character's ethnicity or sexuality is a major plot point. IE Steve Rodgers being white, or Storm being black. If there is no good reason for them to change, let the mantle be passed on. And even if there is a good reason the mantle still gets passed on IE Falcon now being Captain America."
gaybros,3av7l6,josiahpapaya,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:09:25 2015 UTC,"As a gay kid who grew up obsessed with Spiderman and the X-Men, I'm very much a fan of keeping things canonical. I think there's this trend in Hollywood right now of rewriting characters as black, or as a different gender or as a homosexual or whatever and sometimes it's cool, and sometimes it's not. I thought in Skyfall (spoilerrrrr) when they make Moneypenny a black chick that it was genius. I was gagged - didn't see that coming at all. Moneypenny was a literary character. She had been visually incarnated several times over by sexually frustrated white women in their 40's, but her hair had been red and blonde and brown. Every moneypenny looked different than the last. There was nothing that said she couldn't be black. or Asian, really... For Spiderman though, he's a graphic character. You can't just change a character for politics. We know who Peter Parker is. As hot as it would be to have Spiderman played by Tyson Beckford with his boyfriend played by Zayn Malik, it wouldn't be ""Spiderman"" anymore. I agree with Spike Lee. Just make a new Spiderman / make a new character that isn't Peter Parker instead of trying to rewrite Peter Parker as someone different."
gaybros,3av7l6,MrSparrows,0,Tue Jun 23 23:05:28 2015 UTC,"In a medium that is constantly being rewritten and updated and changed and altered and rebooted. They can change the outfit, the back story, the setting, the characters personality, sometimes it's a completely different guy under the suit, an alternate universe even, but somehow through all that they remain straight and white.   Taking one the few popular black superheroes like Storm or Black Panther and making them white hurts the pool of black superheroes way more than taking one of the many whites and making them black would hurt the white pool. Those guys are a symbol. The only black super hero toy I had growing up was a Static Shock toy from mcdonalds. It's important that the generation after me shouldn't have the same issues. Just like I'm sure a lot of people here went through a phase where they searched high and low for anything gay to watch or read when they were growing up black people, asians, and latinos do the same thing. It would be nice if people didn't have to search as hard to find something that looks like or reflects them.    I'm not saying they should change it but I am saying these arguments against changing it seem very weak to me."
gaybros,3av7l6,josiahpapaya,0,Tue Jun 23 23:28:29 2015 UTC,"Nobody would ever want to make Storm (or other black characters) a white woman. That's a straw man argument - I mean, maybe some white supremacists would, but anyone who is invested in storm as a character would never want her to be anything but what she's always been. That's the same thing that people are saying with Peter Parker. It isn't like taking Annie and making her black. I think that's a novel idea. I understand your point about how there aren't enough black / ethnic superheros of characters in the mainstream and their should be more but to get upset because Peter Parker has to remain white and straight doesn't really make sense. If more black characters are needed, then they need to be created. Don't try to reboot previously white characters as black though, because it only upsets people invested in the character. Conversely, when Angela Landsbury was pissed off that they were thinking of remaking Murder She Wrote with a black women instead, I could understand Angela saying she didn't feel good about it because she didn't think anyone could do the character like her. However, the character of Jessica Fletcher has no implications of socio-economic class or upbringing. You could very easily make her character black and nothing would change, really. Peter Parker however is very much a ""white"" character growing up in a blue collar family in Queens or whatever. Making him black would change the whole tone of the story and the experience of the character. For example - Peter Parker gets picked on in school cause he's a geek. Suddenly him getting picked on in school turns into an expose on racial tension among teens and the character becomes something else. That's what people are having a problem with."
gaybros,3av7l6,MrSparrows,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:33:18 2015 UTC,"The simplest definition of a strawman argument: Misrepresenting an argument to make it easier to attack.  Stan Lee brought up Blank Panther not being swiss. I don't think Storm is any different for the sake of the argument. So that's not a strawman and if it is it's his strawman not mine.   Secondly I never said I was upset about Peter having to remain white and straight. I stated the ridiculousness of those parameters never changing despite everything else about the character changing depending on the writer or what version/universe.   Thirdly nothing about blue color family in queens is ""very much white."" Believe it or not there are black kids who are more bullied for their intelligence than the color of their skin. I know they exist, as anecdotal proof I'll offer myself. High School is high school for everyone and in an area like Queens with a large mixed population you are far more likely to be bullied in school for being considered, weak, nerdy, effeminate, slutty, or any of the other stupid shit kids can think of to single you out than you are for being a person of color.  That mindset. That Parker's upbringing is exclusively white. That people of color don't get picked on for being nerdy. That any time a person of color is the center of something is HAS to be about their color. That mindset is the reason why they need more colored super heroes and like I said before. There's nothing about most super heroes whiteness that is integral to their character. Parker is not an exception to this.   If part of your invest in Peter Parker is that he's white it's probably because you feel like you can relate to him in some way. You probably feel like if they changed his skin color that would completely change the character but it doesn't, it's just skin. But if it would hurt your ability to relate to him that much consider how many white heroes there are compared to heroes of color. And consider how everyone else might feel about never seeing heroes that look like them.    You can make new ones sure. But that's a hard sell. Something people already know is a lot easier to make money off of. I'm not against that idea especially if it works, that's great. But I don't see anything sacred about the whiteness of the characters that are already well known."

Several of them explicitly state that it was the issue of slavery that forced their hand.   then why did the united states not go to war with literally every other place on earth that had slavery?   Two reasons:  One - the United States was among the last western civilizations to still have slavery at that time.  Two - because it wasn't a domestic issue and the United States was still very isolationist?

The south seemed like a poor copy of the European aristocratic system which also failed, and also deserved it's failure.   No one is the good guy in a war. Personally, I'm glad the south lost.  If you disagree that the south shouldn't have lost on some grounds or if you think the north is some uber-evil bully that should be destroyed, then quit being sarcastic and state your case plainly and simply like this: in general, the north had more personal and economic freedoms and chance of class elevation than the south. The south had a culture that was class based; you were either part of a 'respectable' family who only married people from other 'respectable' families or you were a workman/servant. No cross over was allowed. Born a workman or servant, you'll die a workman or servant, as will your children and their children. And to me, that is a backwards, backwards culture."

gaybros,3asw80,saargrin,4,Wed Jun 24 11:34:43 2015 UTC,"You're right about that.  The American flag has been flown in its fair number of atrocities.  But unlike the Confederate flag, its very creation and reason for existence is much harder to link to something awful, like the fight to keep slavery.  The American flag has hundreds, if not thousands, of associations.  The Confederate flag has much fewer, granted one of those is a co-opted symbol of southern pride, which is seemingly innocuous, but many have a hard time distancing the symbol from its historical roots."
gaybros,3asw80,Chross,7,Sun Jun 28 21:55:17 2015 UTC,"The Confederate battle flag only means one thing: The South's willingness to kill if necessary so they can break off from the Union and continue enslaving black Americans. That was literally what it was created for.  The American flag has flown over its fair share of atrocities, but it was not created as a way to represent those atrocities the way the Confederate flag was. The American flag was created during the revolution and was used to represent the union of American states. It's completely different.  EDIT: Oh, and more importantly, internment camps were not nearly as horrifying as what Southerners did to black Americans under slavery, nor was it remotely as long-lived as slavery which lasted for centuries. The only thing comparable that I can think of would be the genocide of American Indians. But there's not a special flag that represents only that. But if there were, I'll bet some racist chucklefucks would fly it and then say, ""What? Why are you mad at us? We're not racist!"" Just like what you and so many Southerners are doing now."

I have often wondered how many straight lives were destroyed that way.  It just rocks my world to see this much change in my one life time.

gaybros,3awti6,mnrunner88,2,Wed Jun 24 03:25:39 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking about mostly skipping Pride this year. None of my friends ever want to go, so it ends up just being me wandering around, checking out the vendors (of which I am in the demographic of about maybe 5%), scoring a 10% coupon off Microsoft, and going home.  For the most part the music isn't my scene, so I don't see much reason to go to the shows. I might hit it up after work on Friday and buy a Pride Pin, but the fact that they keep all the food trucks inside the Beer Dabbler (which is $40; too steep for me if I have to get myself home, especially since buses don't run anywhere near my house after 7:30p, so that means bicycling) kind of pisses me off because I wouldn't mind getting a bite and wandering the park before heading home (and no, the mini-doughnut guy doesn't count as a food truck).  The Block Party sounds interesting, but again: I'm going to have to get myself home, and if I bike (to avoid getting slapped with a DUI) that's a 90 minute ride up and down hills, which probably won't be fun if I've had a few beers, and it's getting dark.    Not to sound like an old stick-in-the-mud but it just seems like it's more trouble than it's worth to me right now. And I don't mean to sound like a shut-in either, since it's Kaposia Days down near me, and while it's far more family-oriented (read: alcohol-free) at least my friends are interested in what's happening and I can get around easily. There's also Artcrank, Music and Movies in the Park, Artist-Designed Mini-Golf (though if we're going to that we may as well check out Pride briefly) and a ton of other events.  Maybe doing a meetup might be interesting, but it all depends on what events we're planning on hitting up. I might coordinate with the MN Gaybros Group on Facebook."

gaybros,3arzww,Blissfulystoopid,3,Tue Jun 23 05:51:53 2015 UTC,"Why does every gay story have to be tragic? Not dismissing the story its good, but the amount of let downs in everything gay related is kinda annoying."
gaybros,3arzww,avian_buddha,2,Tue Jun 23 18:12:50 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty complicated question, any real answer would have a ton of moving parts; but it at least in part comes from ""write what you know""  To be a ""gay story,"" it needs to especially represent some kind of gay experience, which has historically been extremely tragic. Of course, there are stories with incidentally gay characters and no tragedy (Think Wallace Wells from Scott Pilgrim, for instance), and there are stories with gay protagonists that aren't tragic (if more rarely);  either way, if the story isn't speaking to some kind of experience you might argue that it isn't a ""gay"" story, just a story with some gayness in it. I guess what I'm trying to say is the very label of ""gay story"" contributes to the tragedy therein, when there are plenty of stories with homosexuality being center stage but no contrived tragedy.  At the very least, this piece is really positive in that the tragedy has nothing to do with the homosexuality of its characters, the sadness comes from being forced by circumstance to move, especially when all parties involved seemed pretty supportive. It's sad, but it isn't sad because of discrimination or explicitly gay experience, it's sad because it's a relatable life experience that happens to almost everyone, and it portrays homosexuality as entirely normal. And that's a really cool thing!"
gaybros,3arzww,BastardPriest,2,Tue Jun 23 19:46:12 2015 UTC,"Perfecly said, I couldn't agree more.   I just wrote this in r/gaymers about the same thing:   You hit the nail on the head. He wanted the background to tell a big part of the story as well, the fact that they don't draw suspect attention, that their romance isn't feared, it is simply accepted and adored. It is a story where gay kids have the same right to their lives and happiness as anyone else. That is why I actually love the ending so much, it's real, it is the kind of sad that gay kids should be allowed to feel. Not shame, not self loathing, not fear, but the love and heartache that comes with life.   My mom recently told me I was the most serious kid she knew, and now I realize why. When I was growing up, I couldn't allow myself to feel heartache about boys I liked, or allow myself to enjoy spending time with them. I had to wall myself off to protect myself. I lost a big part of my childhood because of it.  This ending to this story is sad, but these kids have the rest of their adolescence to explore love more. And that's why I think it is a very happy ending as well."

I suppose I came out young enough where there wasn't much she could do. She ignored and feigned ignorance for years. My Grandparents were awesome and amazingly supportive. She eventually came around... Partly due to the fact that I was the good son in comparison to the other kids in the family. Still though--no regrets 8/10 would do again."

My mother was the worst, she punched me a couple of times and I ended up with a concussion. I haven't spoken to her since I was 19 when she kicked me out.   I'm 25 now. I only recently came out to my father and stepmother and they were a lot better about it.   Would I have changed my coming out? No. Never in a million years. It was one of the hardest things I ever did but it was the greatest lesson I will learn. I survived living with nothing, got a great job, fulfilled my dream of moving overseas and somehow surviving that alone, I have an awesome job and am slowly starting to become happy.

I took my boyfriend to my high school prom, got the first few relationships out of the way before I turned 21, got a bunch of experience under my belt, and consider myself to be a well-adjusted professional now that I'm in my mid 20s and in a stable relationship.  If I was just coming out now, I'd have to do it all over again but without the wiggle room for error that youth affords."
gaybros,3aqaxl,TheyCallHimBob,3,Mon Jun 22 23:21:31 2015 UTC,I was 17 when I first came out. I'm glad I came out when I did as it gave me time to adjust more to being gay while I was still young. I'm 19 now and came out to my parents the day before my 19th birthday (had little choice in the matter) and went on my first date about 2 weeks ago :) Didn't lead to anything but I'm glad I had the experience. Now I'm planning to go to my first gay club in about 2 weeks. Scared yet excited for new experiences :)

I understand staying hidden if you're financially dependent on your parents and they're going to cut you loose.  I'm glad I didn't have any concern about my parents dropkicking me out the door.  I don't personally know anybody that says 'gosh, I wish I'd come out later'."
gaybros,3aqaxl,burytheblade,3,Mon Jun 22 19:02:08 2015 UTC,"26ish. Came out to one friend, waited another year or more to tell more. Pretty much all of my close friends know now, definitely the right time.   Told my parents this last Spring...still not sure. It didn't go fantastic but it didn't go horribly. It'll take some time but for now they pretty much end the conversation as soon as I mention the guy I've been dating for almost a year, or just not acknowledge it at all. I'm not too worried. They'll either come around or they won't, and if they won't, I guess I won't be visiting."
gaybros,3aqaxl,Brochitect,3,Mon Jun 22 21:42:27 2015 UTC,"It's odd because I don't consider myself as having 'come out' until I came out to my parents at 27 years old.  I'd told a few close friends even before that though, starting in sophomore year (21) and a few more through college.  My main worry for waiting too long was that I was nearly 100% convinced my parents would cut me out of their lives.  I was happy to find out I was wrong when I did, and it was a huge surprise.  But I'd never have guessed it.  In the end, it was just that the waiting and the worrying became too much for me.  Ignoring that -- but especially knowing that they're cool about it -- I regret waiting that long.  It isn't necessarily for all the sex I missed out on in college (not that that wouldn't have been fun), but it's more for all the dating and relationship experience.  I was learning a lot of things that people my age learned 5-10 years earlier.  Call me John Green because that was a friggin crash course."

Everything within it's time and now, 20 years old, I'm in a relationship with the greatest guy ever, and my last few months have been amazing! So... in short, yes, I'm really happy about when I came out as it gave proper time to everyone in my life cycle to adjust (parents, friends, me...)."

I was chubby, just got my first boyfriend, and decided coming out to my mom was the thing to do because I didn't want to seem dishonest about my social life.  We had the conversation, she asked some questions, then she told me ""You're going through a phase. I don't think you're gay."" and that was that. I then made up stories about girls I liked and wanted to date for 4 years after that to get me through to going to university. A week after I moved into my dorm, I had myself a boyfriend and again, tried to tell my mom. We had a long talk, she was upset again, and then we fought about it for 4 months because she couldn't come to terms with it after I told her all the stories of me wanting to marry an Asian woman and what not.  I understand her point of view now and she's an extreme supporter of gay people now. But it fucking sucked when it was happening and I was living in this constant state of being pissed and sad. But, in the end, I'm glad I came out because I don't have anything to hide. I'm proud to be me :)"

gaybros,3aqaxl,HighFarGone,2,Wed Jun 24 04:20:41 2015 UTC,"Depending on your relationship with her, I would say just be honest about everything. Keep bringing it up, respectfully. and letting her know that you want to be taken seriously and to get her support. But just remember that it takes time to adjust to. As my mom put it - 'you're my child and I've spent your whole life imagining what your future is going to be like and this changes everything. It's almost as if someone is dying and I need time to grieve over the loss of the future I envisioned before I can accept the new future you are pursuing.'  I'm sure any resistance is not out of hate, but just fear of the unknown. Good luck friend!!! I'm rooting for you :D"

I graduated high school with fewer than 5 people knowing, but that's just how I preferred it. I was quite awkward and wasn't social. In college, once one person knew, it slowly made it's way around to all of my acquaintances and everyone was fine with it. Their acceptance is probably one of the main reasons I came out of my shell and became more social. Even at my religious university, it seemed most people simply didn't care or 'loved the sinner hated the sin,' which was good enough for me.  I told my family later on, freshman or sophomore year of college. They all took it well. Honestly, I'm glad I didn't come out earlier. I'm not sure my parents would have been as accepting had I came out earlier. Their opinions on the topic were certainly evolving in the years beforehand so I feel like I picked the right moment.

You have to go see the priest.""  So I went to see the priest, who said that I was fine, but I would have to deal with my parents sooner or later.  So I kept my gay life away from them for 18 years — they knew I was still gay, but didn't want the details.  Then I met my husband in 1990, and they loved him.  A total turn around for this Republican, Catholic family (I'm neither, of course).  My dad died in 1995, really liking my husband.

He was a new student that year so he was still getting to know everybody. Later on in the year we were talking and somehow sexuality came up. He told me that he was bisexual. This was my first experience talkin to someone who was more openly out and so I said ""Welcome to the club buddy!"" I was faced with conflicting emotions. It was scary because I didn't know how he'd react or what would happen, but it was also so great to get the burden of keeping something so big a secret for so long. We became really good friends and he introduced me to more non straight people and it was an overall great experience. 10/10 would do it again.  Around that time I also accidentally came out to my sister because our iMessage account was linked for a small period of time. The same friend who I accidentally came out to had been messaging me to try and figure out if I were serious about not being straight. However, these messages were all sent to my sister rather than me. At first she thought it was just some guy with the wrong number and was messing with him. Then he mentioned my name so see texted me asking if I knew about this person. I could not have asked for a more supportive sister."

It doesn't mean that they actually feel that way.

It may have been better to do it sooner. Then I could have started to experience sex and relationships in high school/college and I wouldn't have felt like I got a late start. It's all worked out so far though so it's hard to have any regrets. It was certainly the right time, it was just hard to tell how long it had been the right time. I think there was probably a time when my friends would not have been as accepting, when we were all a little less mature, but it's hard to know for sure.  The one thing I can tell you is that coming out is a process. This is good and bad. Bad because you end up doing it over and over which can be exhausting. Good because you can start with those you really trust and are close to and get some support for those who are more difficult while having a bit more freedom to be yourself in the mean time."

By the time I was in college I finally worked up the courage to say that I'm intending on embracing my identity. They supported me and it's been ok.

I haven't come out to my Father because he is so hateful/stupid that he called a group of 14 black guys in the projects a Nigger and they jumped him Karma though I still love my only one dad. He doesn't accept most people outside his realm..   Grandpa is ex Navy ship crew. I don't think I'll ever tell him. I'm kind of afraid of him when he gets angry. It's like watching my dad but with eyes of pure evil.  My mother is the only one who accepts me but she lives 8 hours away from me. This makes me sad."

gaybros,3anr8e,TCsnowdream,92,Mon Jun 22 00:46:17 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be honest here. I used to not be attracted to asian men. I'm from a small town in the midwest, and I almost never see asian people, I believe they are the smallest racial group in the midwest. I moved to New York city for school last August. I went to a school with a large asian population, and after a few months, I finally started to find myself attracted to asian guys.   I think the reason I didn't find myself attracted to them before was that I hadn't seen enough asian people to understand how there features were supposed to look together. I was analyzing asian people based on what white people looked like, but once I had a good understanding and a good image of what asian people look like, I was able to look past the simple racial difference and identify what turned me on."
gaybros,3anr8e,asdeasde96,20,Mon Jun 22 03:39:32 2015 UTC,"Seriously, this seems like a huge part of it to me. I feel like the more I've seen and been around people of other races, the more I've started to become attracted to people of the same race.   It's funny though, because typing that just makes me feel dirty. I don't want to think about people as ""being of a race."" I hate the categorization of people based on certain aspects, but it's almost like people are forced, in society, to think of people with similar traits in a similar way. I just don't want to think of anyone in that way, as there's so much more to a person than that."

gaybros,3anr8e,Oshi105,13,Wed Jun 24 05:10:13 2015 UTC,You're probably resonating well with some people in this regard. It's simply a lack of exposure. I myself wasn't that interested in Indian guys until I spent a month in India and really was exposed to a larger population of Indian men. It turns out the Indian guys I knew back home just weren't the hot ones - they were all back in Delhi!
gaybros,3anr8e,kinsey3,5,Mon Jun 22 09:25:08 2015 UTC,Delhi is like the NY of India sort of. It's as if you for dropped into the biggest upper middle class population in the country.

gaybros,3anr8e,lilmeatwad,4,Tue Jun 23 17:37:37 2015 UTC,"Yes! This is 100%!!!   It is all about the familiarity of you and a certain facial features. Of course with how media portrays nowadays, it is so common to see guys that are masculine, Caucasian features are considered the norm of beauty. The more you spent time with a certain group of people, the more your brain ignores the difference between different races' facial features and start to pickup what you consider attractive more cohesively. I wonder if any studies has been done about this..?  Anyway, there's also a ""type"" that most people find themselves can't help but attracted to. It's tall guy for me :). But saying you are totally unattracted to a certain racial group without spending much time with that group is ... well more of that chocolate/brown sugar/curry/eggrolls/burrito/whatever-food-sound-mildly-racist for the rest of us then :)"

Been with two guys who are 'top only' stated 7"" in his profile but more like 6"" in real life. Also a guy who had a strange accident that left him with weird scaring and just one ball. Weirdly these guys feel dating Asians exclusively will compensate for what they lack down there.   Worst of all, the last guy I met on Grindr states 'Asian only' and when he shows up, his mouth is sooo small he can't fit my penis.   Nonetheless, it's just four examples and not sufficient to cast a wide theory, of course. I also have good experience with guys who are pleasantly surprised and didn't find an Asian with a larger dick than them intimidating (it's quite rare, to be frank). My ex-bf looks very masculine and a lot of people thought he's the top in our relationship, but the fact is he made it a mission to 'conquer' my cock when we met and primary a bottom ever since :)"

gaybros,3anr8e,SmarmySalamander,11,Tue Jun 23 06:13:29 2015 UTC,"I think a large part of it might have to do with the media in whatever culture you grew up in. Like if you live in north America, most ""teen idols"" and leading characters in TV and Movies tend to be Caucasian. The exposure to being told that ""these people are attractive"" from a young age probably affects people differently. For some people, they might not even realize that they're not attracted to a certain race, or may never admit it to themselves, and other people, well they're the guys who are all ""No Asians, No Latinos, etc etc"", which is a whole other issue for them to workout themselves I guess."

The ""hehe looks like somebody has a type!!"" comments always bugged me. Like... if I exclusively dated white guys (like the vast majority of my gay friends do), would anybody be saying I have a fetish for white guys? There's nothing specifically about asian guys that attracts me more than any other race, but there's also nothing specifically about them that I find unattractive. Unfortunately so many gay guys hold this ""not into asians"" view that if you don't share it, they assume it's a fetish."

Generally Australia is really safe for everyone. I think in part our racist reputation can also stem from our sense of humour. For example, we throw the word ""wog"" around and its never meant to be an insult, its just a word for Italian and Greek people.  Anyone from overseas hearing that might think it was a serious racial slur. Our useage of the word cunt is another good example of a strong word being used commonly with no harmful intent."

I've no idea where you live and it may well be worse than where I live but here it's not an issue (at least not amongst my ""circle"")   Also by Bogan I guess I always struggle to find a better word that can convey shitty ""lad"" culture, chavs, rednecks, gopniks etc etc to people who aren't from Australia and might not know the word."

I was initially surprised at the number of Asian or Latino guys I dated who mentioned they're largely ignored, except for that small group of very, very, VERY interested guys who fetishize them. But after hearing the same thing from the non-white gay guys I know across the spectrum, I think it's real. And maybe I've become a bit jaded and cynical to it.

I feel like confidence is what most lack regardless of their body composition.   I believe the whole ""deal"" with it is that being American, we mainly see non-asian guys on tv, magazines, movies being sexualized and lusted after. When there is an Asian guy, it tends to be something funny and outlandish (guy from the hangover) or stereotyping (guy from sixteen candles). And then the dreaded stereotype Asians are effeminate and have small dicks. Most have to constantly deal with that problem and that tends to kill their confidence in themselves when they have to go up against all that.   Just advice for your friend.... Now, if you're friend has been wanting to move to Japan because he always wanted to, then I'd say go ahead. But if it's just for sexual attention, I'd say that he needs to build confidence in himself before doing something like that."

Hit the nail right on the head. SF Pride is coming up and my friends keep asking if I'm going. Why? In the LGBTIQA(insert missing letters here) community, I'm not represented fairly. Therefore, why would I choose to get involved with a community that doesn't really treat my race as an equal? It's a white world out there, I'm not ignorant to that blinding fact.   But my tip to you, as someone who has reached middle age: you don't have to be involved in the white LGBTIQA(insert missing letter here) community to be a out of the closet. You can be gay and be independent of that scene. You can do all the shit you want to do, go where you want to go, fuck who you want to fuck without being involved in the Community.

Most people are usually born elsewhere and then immigrate here; I find that they connect much easier with others since they have a shared experience, and it's even better if they're from the same country since they share the culture. I didn't realise this was the case until I reached high school, and even more so in post-secondary. Being born here I identify myself as Canadian since I don't speak my parents' language and other than their cuisine I don't know a lot about their culture. I then realised how limited my options really were since I have to compete between the ""white gays"" and the ""immigrant gays"" which were the majorities; I get their respective judgements of: ""oh he's not white so he's probably hard to talk to"" and ""he's too 'white-washed' to hang around with""  No doubt this issue will get better, especially in Canada, as more couples marry and society progresses over time.

He had discs in his ears, had thick frame glasses that matched his face well, wore clothes that fit, and worked out on the regular. Some of the individual parts sound stereotypically hipster, but he was pulling them together in a subtle way.  I saw some of his older pictures on Facebook.  Five years ago, he was wearing t-shirts with jeans and a bowl haircut.  It was really not flattering.  In classic Gaybros fashion, he turned out to be straight.

gaybros,3anr8e,willbailes,5,Mon Jun 22 14:40:07 2015 UTC,He kept talking about how difficult it's been for him to get a boyfriend. That most guys he's interested 'aren't into asians'    What kind of guys is he into? Because I'm sensing an irony bomb about to go off.
gaybros,3anr8e,kbkid3,7,Mon Jun 22 02:15:21 2015 UTC,"I asked him what his type was, and he said 'The only think I don't like is morbidly obese, ya know... When it looks like their bodies are melting. Otherwise everything is fair game to me!'"
gaybros,3anr8e,Clipsez,3,Mon Jun 22 04:01:28 2015 UTC,"So when he asks out Asian guys, they tell him they don't date Asians?"
gaybros,3anr8e,blowhardV2,4,Mon Jun 22 05:13:43 2015 UTC,"I didn't ask that question, honestly... He seemed really sad about the situation. And he loved the attention from the men he was getting here in Japan, so I am going to say that he has no problem dating other Asian men.  But I don't know the answer to the second half of your question."
gaybros,3anr8e,kyletr,7,Mon Jun 22 05:16:52 2015 UTC,That might be a good question to ask him.  Ask if he's dated other asian guys.  It'd be funny if most Asians in the midwest won't even date asians.
gaybros,3anr8e,IamMoltar,2,Mon Jun 22 05:57:42 2015 UTC,It'd be funny if he was most Asians in the Midwest.

gaybros,3anr8e,eternalhedonist,5,Mon Jun 22 02:35:44 2015 UTC,If only more people had your attitude OP.
gaybros,3anr8e,mintchan,5,Mon Jun 22 17:13:56 2015 UTC,"Honest and sincere answer: Having dated most races, culturally I've had the hardest time with Asian men. Both inside and outside of the bedroom.   At least in my experience, many Asian men are very relationship-driven, relationship-hungry right out of the gate. They form very intense connections, too early on. That both indirectly (subconsciously) and directly effects their interactions with me.   It's hard to put into words, but I find myself both overwhelmed and feeling like they are also too overwhelmed to make healthy/wise decisions. They wear their hearts on a sleeve.  It tends to bleed over into the bedroom and sets a weird tone to the experience. Plus, I found them sexually incompatible. Too passive and regimented into sexual roles for my liking. But that's just me and my two cents."
gaybros,3anr8e,Aethyos,15,Mon Jun 22 04:19:42 2015 UTC,"I think the amount of time that someone has spent here (i.e. taking in Western culture) can play a role in that. As an Asian who was born in Canada, I’ve had the gamut of experiences with other Asian guys from situations where we got along well socially and sexually (this was mostly with other CBCs or guys who came to Canada early in life) to “We just met tonight, you were bad in bed, and no -- for the love of all that is holy -- I do not want to go on a birthday date with you next week” (that one was super awkward).  So I understand where these ideas come from and I think it’s fair to consider cultural differences and sexual incompatibility as barriers to interaction, but to paint all Asians with the same brush is the very definition of racism. There are just as many white people out there who don’t cut it in bed (I’ve had the “pleasure” of being with a bunch of them) and/or who have conservative relationship expectations and/or family baggage (often euphemistically referred to as “tradition” or “the social norm”), but, hey, y’all still get a chance with me."

gaybros,3anr8e,Ashkir,6,Mon Jun 22 16:57:34 2015 UTC,"Okay, will Reveal something bad on my part... I prejudge Asians. I've been with five Asian guys in my 23 year old life, they were not lacking in the looks department, muscles or overall sharp features, but... They all were terrible in bed. Normally not something you can judge by race, but it was always the same thing, kissing was short and their lips never left the ""puckered state"", weird, but the kicker was that they all acted like they were in pain during sex, one even telling me to stop and when I did he got mad! Apparently that's a common Japanese thing? Idk but I've never turned down a Asian guy or put ""no asians"" on grindr, but I can't help but think twice from experience."

He rationally understands people are individuals."

gaybros,3anr8e,RedKirby,4,Mon Jun 22 07:18:03 2015 UTC,"the thing i find a bit unnerving is some of the reasons people who write ""no asians"", don't like asians. majority name femininity/emasculate the primary reason they aren't into asians but what they don't realize is asians as a whole are variable in their characteristics. just like how every race is.  if masculinity is truly your preference, then there is no reason to say ""no asians"". you'll find asians of many different character types just like you find with white dudes or black dudes...so why rule out an entire race based on a personality trait/physicality that can occur in everyone? it just seems so narrow minded and speaks volumes of one's character that i'm, frankly, kind of glad that they write ""no asians"" in their profile. it gives me a clear indicator that it's someone i'd rather not associate with on any kind of level."
gaybros,3anr8e,bipolar-bear,2,Mon Jun 22 16:02:47 2015 UTC,I haven't been single for a while but while I had nothing against dating people of any ethnicity I don't often find myself attracted to tons of people who aren't white. I'm fairly sure it has a lot to do with being raised in Utah surrounded by mostly other white faces I was always surrounded by uber liberals and never really came in contact with racism.     I don't know what I am trying to say here but I do think that attractions are formed fairly early on in life and not being exposed to other ethnic groups can hinder the development of sexual attraction for those groups. So yeah midwest not the best place to find people with a normal level of attraction to non white people there are exceptions of course but i think in less diverse areas you run into more racists and more people who fetishize...fetishify...whatever. racial characteristics.
gaybros,3anr8e,yah511,3,Mon Jun 22 17:17:18 2015 UTC,"I do think that lack of exposure and negative media portrayals (how many positive male Asian roles in film and TV are there???) has a large part to play in this, and it's very, very wrong."

gaybros,3anr8e,redherod,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:38:37 2015 UTC,"I was never really super attracted to Asian guys until I moved to Korea. I think a lot of attraction has to do with a person's environment and experiences. If you're surrounded by or have encountered a large spectrum of different races, I think that you're more likely to find a larger range of men attractive. If you're from a small town in America with not a lot of diversity, you're probably more likely to be primarily attracted to white men.  I often encounter Grindr profiles here that say ""Korean Only"" and I don't think it's because they're all racist or can't speak English. They likely don't encounter many people who aren't Korean, and therefore are primarily attracted to other Koreans."

From my experience, having lots of gay and non gay asians friends, initially being ok with dating/mating with asians I came to realize, that many of the asians are racist themselves. Ok lots of you will say, everyone is little racist.. that might be true.. But asians (from my experience) are racist who practice self/asian loath.. seriously; many of them admire people just for being white ( even if they are ugly).. I now kinda avoid them at least in the dating scene...   My experience as (was racially blind) Italian-american white dude. I am very interested in Latinos (especially from puerto rico and columbia), Middle eastern/ eastern euro/arabs. tend to be the most fun, funny, confident, down to earth , hardworking/educated, least judgmental and very proud of their ethnicity/culture. Not to mention so spicy in bed.. ** notice I didn't mention any physical traits.."
gaybros,3anr8e,FrankWellstone,-2,Sat Jun 27 18:21:23 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm admittedly one of those people 'not into asians' (minus the super duper twinky ones). I can't give any specific reason for it other than my brain simply doesnt register attraction. It certainly isn't a dislike. Maybe it's that I dont feel like I identify with them? I'm bi though and I do find asian girls attractive.  Also, as bad as it may sound, in my experience asian guys tend to smell... different, and in my opinion, bad. And I'm not talking due to lack of hygeine or anything, I just mean the natural scent. Also the jet black hair that seems to just grow straight out of the head I think I find unattractive, especially the pubic hair."
gaybros,3anr8e,yeah-bro,7,Mon Jun 22 05:46:59 2015 UTC,I've been with a lot of Asian guys and never noticed a smell - although black guys tell me that white guys smell like wet dog and black guys sometimes have a musky scent

gaybros,3anbyo,1of42,6,Tue Jun 23 06:07:34 2015 UTC,"It's incredible to me that drunk drivers almost always seem to escape these things with few to no injuries while seriously hurting or killing multiple others.  There was a guy I used to be friends with who would regularly go to the club, get plastered, and drive himself home after. One night he showed up at my apartment at 3 AM and started knocking on my bedroom window while I was sound asleep. After a slight freakout thinking that someone was trying to break in or something, I looked and saw it was him and let him in. I thought maybe something had happened, but really all it was was that he'd gotten drunk and for whatever reason thought he should come crash at my place instead of his, even though my apartment was in the opposite direction from the club and further away than his place.   He was barely coherent and when I asked him who gave him a ride to my place he said ""nobody"" and proceeded to try to go sleep in my bed. I was so fucking furious that this asshole would endanger so many people driving in that condition (not to mention waking me up when I had work in the morning) that I wanted so badly to tell him to get the fuck out, but obviously that would just put him back on the road, which wasn't an option. I ended up grabbing him by the shoulders and pushing him out of my room and onto the couch, grabbed his keys, and hid them on the off chance he didn't immediately pass out for the night (which he did, unsurprisingly).  To this day I still don't know how he managed to get to my place without crashing into anything or anyone. It was after that night that I realized just how often he'd get hammered and drive and it was one of many factors that caused me to break off that friendship.  Just wanted to share that for whatever reason. OP, I'm sorry this happened to you, but I'm glad you and all your friends made it out with your lives."
gaybros,3anbyo,IamMoltar,3,Mon Jun 22 18:08:19 2015 UTC,"It's usually because their bodies are more relaxed; they don't tense up so they receive less damage. It's ridiculous that it works out that way, just like your old friend is ridiculous for doing that all the time."
gaybros,3anbyo,ZhicoLoL,5,Tue Jun 23 00:31:50 2015 UTC,"Geez it sucks huh? Something similar happened to me just last year when I was eating lunch inside a restaurant when a meth head strikes a wall, collapsing it and crushing my legs. It's always completely out of the blue. It was such a struggle for my bf who I was living with though. He felt insanely guilty because he was on E at the time at a 2 day festival, and he wasn't in the right mental state to take care of me during the first 48 hours. He started to shut down in a way so I had to break up with him for his sake.  Sorry for the ramble, I just want you to know to make sure your bf isn't sacrificing for you."
gaybros,3anbyo,IamMoltar,2,Mon Jun 22 13:08:07 2015 UTC,"He's doing a lot to take care of me, but at the same time I'm trying to do plenty for myself. I mentioned in a previous comment that I managed to get out of bed all by myself this morning! I was really excited:)"

gaybros,3anbyo,MonkeyRugger,6,Mon Jun 22 00:58:28 2015 UTC,oh we legally can't serve someone who's intoxicated here in Canada. it should be punished a lot more
gaybros,3anbyo,AmelioratingPaul,7,Mon Jun 22 01:14:27 2015 UTC,"As someone who has been served many a drink while highly intoxicated in Canada - along with just about everyone else who's ever had a drink here - I think this is wrongheaded. It is entirely possible to behave responsibly while you are incredibly drunk. There's no easy way to make a consistent policy on that basis, but I think the whole ""nobody who is drunk should be served"" deal is ridiculous and completely out of touch with reality. Sure, don't serve the person who is barely able to stand up and almost passing out, but we're lying to ourselves in saying that nobody intoxicated should be served because it's too dangerous."

gaybros,3anbyo,jplivecmh,6,Mon Jun 22 07:04:23 2015 UTC,"I strongly disagree. Yes on rare occasions overserving is something done maliciously but that is VERY rare. Overconsumption and stupid decisions like driving drunk are 100% the fault of the drunk themselves.    Fat people cant sue the kid at McDonalds because that kid should have said the third big mac was enough. If I blow myself up because I am mishandling gunpowder reloading my own bullets I cant sue the sporting goods store because I didn't know what I was doing. Or the guy at the range because I loaded a round too hot and injure myself while shooting at his range.    A bartender's job should be to tend the bar, NOT babysit every idiot who comes through the door."

In general, though the new government is better for same-sex couples, but the European union is not very happy about new government being left-wing and has really put Greece into very difficult political position at the moment.  Besides the government, the mayor of the city has expressed that he likes the parade a lot and even has participated in it. While the Church is not directly linked to the government, it does have influence in a sense that 95% of greeks are Greek Orthodox and do express outright homophobia."

I think it was because my friend seems to have good luck with meeting guys on there. I remember why I deleted it in the first place.   Also, I got ghosted earlier this week. Sucks, too, since I was really looking forward to meeting, and playing, with the guy. Oh well.   On the upside, I got welcomed for an in-person interview for a Director position so yay! This means I can get my boat soon."

gaybros,3amc2w,SeekerD,2,Mon Jun 22 00:09:00 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, it just gives me more time to myself to really make sure I know who I am. And I get more time to enjoy the fruits of my labours as well as the rewards associated with independence.   I just get jealous on a deeper level. As I told one of my incredibly close friends, I sometimes wish I had someone there to cheer me on (parents notwithstanding), to provide support when I need it, to fawn over, to go to things with.

I crafted a Spotify playlist for him to listen to over the weekend, so I can't wait to hear what he thinks of my musical tastes (however shitty they may be haha). My only issue right now (and it's not an issue, per se), is that he texted me that a friend of his passed away in an accident over the weekend. He said he's fine, just distracted, but he made it clear that we were still on for tomorrow. I let him know that I was open if he needed to talk to someone, and I hope he feels better eventually.

Also trying to decide on the next step in coming out. Told my friend I was gay last week (the first person ever) and still really happy over how it went. But now feeling (self-created) pressure to tell loads of people and so on - whilst also feeling like I want to take things slow.  How about you OP? How's life?
gaybros,3amc2w,PartManPartOwl,2,Tue Jun 23 01:50:53 2015 UTC,"It's alright, but I really can't complain since it's what I've made it. Thanks for asking.   Congrats on your first step. I wouldn't worry about the pressure since it's not really anybody else's problem, but I would try to tell family in person and friends in person if I could, but if not, messaging them privately would also work. As for the rest, who cares. I don't see being gay as that big of a deal so I don't really try to make it one, but everybody's different. I hope everything works out for you and congrats on graduating."
gaybros,3amc2w,PartManPartOwl,2,Tue Jun 23 03:20:49 2015 UTC,Yeah - the pressure is self inflicted to be honest. Planning on telling family face to face but not at graduation - don't want to tie the two things together - so will probably be after the summer. My friends live across the world (and I've moved recently too) so will probably tell most of them over Skype.  And hope your week is awesome :)

With all the love I can muster (which is a lot) I give you all my thanks and wish you a most happy of Father's days, and many more to come.   I  was lucky enough to have a loving dad and step dad along with other men who said, ""I want to help him."" They are all my fathers.

Free yourself from fear through action! But be safe. And we all go through a slutty phase - don't be ashamed it's part of learning how to be comfortable with sex.   As gay people we get to choose our family and whom we let into our life. That is a privilege not many people realize.

Me on the other hand probably has a death grip syndrome from jerking it too much and its hard for me to cum sometimes. He gets so down on himself that it totally kills any type of sexy mood that was left. It's lead to alot of tears and frustration.
gaybros,3aho67,waddup90,2,Mon Jun 22 01:35:54 2015 UTC,I did NoFap to fix this but you might at least try using lube when you masturbate for a month or two which should make it less necessary to have the death grip.

My guy and I couldn't cum one after the other for like a year (he takes a little while), and it was a pretty big downer. Like he thought he was doing something wrong. So I just had to keep telling him that it was fine, and I'd wait however long it took for him to come around (ha), if he could. And if he didn't we could always try again later.  It's been about two years now, and we've figured out what works for us. So I guess you've just got to find your way with him. Let him know you still love him, support him, etc. and so on."

Soon, it's going to get to the point where you're living together, all your friends are the same and you may even be economically dependent on one another. You suffer through a cancerous relationship you never should have let get past the 2-3 month mark for a couple years, maybe even as long as 5 or 6 years before you start to become self-destructive. You become resolved in the fact that this is your lot in life - stuck with this man. You'll make the best of it. But really, you know in the back of your head that you're racing against the clock. It's gonna end eventually and you're just waiting for the axe to drop. I knew this when I was compulsively cheating on my first serious boyfriend. I didn't understand why I was doing it. Not only did I feel no guilt for what I was doing, it was so insignificant to me I didn't even remember doing it sometimes. What I was really doing, in retrospect, was waiting for him to catch me so that he'd break up with me and force the hand. Once I realized that, I left my cellphone out when I went to the bathroom, knowing that he'd go through it once my door was closed. Lo and behold, like magic he confronts me about messages in my inbox from some Asian guy thanking me for the ""Great time"". We broke up and I was out on my ass, couch surfing and looking for apartments and new friends. It was probably one of the best things that had ever happened to me. I was struggling with depression, I never had any money. My life was toxic. After I was liberated from that relationship my life got better by leaps and bounds. I do regret destroying that guy, but he's with someone now and has been for the past 5 years and they're happy. Tl;DR: If you're not happy, jump ship."

If someone is surprised to find out that I'm gay which is usually the case, that means that I don't really match the identity of what (I assume) most people think gays are. The identity of the flamboyant, pink-wearing, high pitched voice, gay male.  However, if someone says, ""yeah, I pretty much knew you're gay,"" then my mind will start racing. Do I sound gay? Do I act gay? Am I fitting these stereotypes?  Another smaller thing that I think also contributes is that I don't think much will change if they're surprised, as counterintuitive as that sounds. If they're surprised, they've always assumed I was straight and now that I'm out, they'll know I'm gay sexually but can still be just a ""straight"" friend. If they're not surprised by it, I'd be worried that they'll think differently of me now that it's out. Again, this seems extremely counterintuitive writing it down but it's something that I can't really put into words.  Of course, I have no problem with gay people that do act/sound like a ""stereotypical"" gay, it's just a personal issue that I struggle with."

I remember as a kid hearing a recording of myself and being weirded out by how different (more feminine) my voice sounded out loud than in my head.   When I was studying in Germany for a semester 5 years ago, we were reading a german article and discussing it. The article for that day was entitled ""Die Farbe der Stimme"" (The color of voice) and it was some kind of metaphor. I don't recall the details. But one of the guys in the class (A French guy) was like ""Oh I can tell what color your voice is. Guys have darker colored voices like black and blue and red and green and girls have lighter colored voices, like yellow and pink, etc"". The professor was intrigued by this so she went around the room and had us all read a passage and Frederik would tell us what ""color"" our voice was. It was a pretty small class, like 10 of us, so he went around the room, rapid fire, guy 1 was blue, guy 2 was green, girl 1 was orange, girl 2 was purple, girl 3 was yellow, and then he got to me. I read the sentence out loud and he went ""uhhhh"" just long enough that everyone started laughing. It wasn't mean spirited, just kind of awkward. And then he  says ""ummm I guess white?"" That moment kind of stuck in my head because I was a bit embarassed. And I was embarrassed that I was embarassed."

gaybros,3afdg0,BumBumiLikeBum,5,Sat Jun 20 01:57:36 2015 UTC,"Synesthesia:       Synesthesia (also spelled synæsthesia or synaesthesia; from the Ancient Greek σύν syn, ""together"", and αἴσθησις aisthēsis, ""sensation"") is a neurological phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway.     People who report such experiences are known as synesthetes.  Difficulties have been recognized in adequately defining synesthesia:   Many different phenomena have been included in the term synesthesia (""union of the senses""), and in many cases the terminology seems to be inaccurate. A more accurate term may be ideasthesia.  In one common form of synesthesia, known as grapheme → color synesthesia or color-graphemic synesthesia, letters or numbers are perceived as inherently colored.   In spatial-sequence, or number form synesthesia, numbers, months of the year, and/or days of the week elicit precise locations in space (for example, 1980 may be ""farther away"" than 1990), or may appear as a three-dimensional map (clockwise or counterclockwise).

I initially thought you were going to say that in German your voice sound more masculine than in English/your native tongue. There's supposedly a correlation between depth of the voice and proficiency, that means that as you learn the language more precisely you'll start to speak it with your 'normal'/higher/gay tone. How proficient was your German back then?"
gaybros,3afdg0,Aethyos,2,Sat Jun 20 04:39:51 2015 UTC,"At the time, my German was good enough that I could carry a conversation in day-to-day life, but I wasn't fluent. I'm a little bit rusty now.   I think part of it might have been due to the different sounds of both languages. In general, the german language has a deeper sound to it than other languages like English, or Italian which has almost a musical sounds to it. So if a guy grows up with German as a first language, I think his register will naturally be lower because his baseline is a language that has a lot of low, guttural sounds."

This isn't necessarily a problem, but I think some people will look at this and expect ""the answer,"" when it's obvious just from the clips that even the professionals don't really know. The biggest thing that bothered me was the scientist suggesting that the man growing up around women may be the reason he ""sounded gay.""

gaybros,3afdg0,ThatSBKid,-1,Sat Jun 20 15:41:53 2015 UTC,"You don't seem to realize that a lot of people would refer to that person as being so gay. & I mean even gay people or comedians during a bit, a gay comedian doing a bit etc. Imagine a gay comedian doing a bit where he says that his gay roommate was there in full gay splendor, hahaha ( audience laughs) when his bigoted parents arrived. Imagine this is a set up for a joke. The audience laughs, they know what it means. And no, it definitely does not mean he is engaged in performing oral sex on another male. It means exactly what gay tends to mean in this direction. That is of course playing up a certain stereotype. I am saying that that is the end of the directions of meanings that ought to be used for the term gay, while it should be separated considerably from sexual/gender orientation. the truth is there are multiple meanings."
gaybros,3afdg0,ravia,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:16:50 2015 UTC,"They would use 'so gay' except in the case of where the person is heterosexual, in which case they would use the term ACT so gay, even though the person is straight. Like gay people who are stereotypically manly are usually said to act straight, but they're still gay. Gay is synonymous with homosexual, that's nothing less than fact, just as straight is synonymous with heterosexual. Would you argue 'straight' isn't an indicator of sexual orientation?  Homosexuality isn't defined by ""one currently engaging in homosexual intercourse"", so your example doesn't fit. If a comedian said ""gay roommate"", he would be using the pre-conceived stereotype surrounding being gay/homosexual to give the audience an idea of what his roommate was like. He would not call his roommate gay if his roommate wasn't homosexual, because again, they mean the same thing.  Your definition of gay only plays into the stereotype more. It's potentially damaging to people who are feminine and not gay, and people who are masculine and gay, because you're adopting your own definition that isn't in widespread use, and that would only cause miscommunication. Gay in its modern usage is nothing more than an indicator of orientation, and is NOT synonymous with femininity, being camp, etc... no matter how much you may argue it is."
gaybros,3afdg0,ThatSBKid,0,Sun Jun 21 04:07:39 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  Not only is it not damaging, it appears to me that the failure to recognize the dimension of gayness that simply is not a matter of sexual orientation has done a lot of damage as well. You have to realize that people are often hated for their style of being. This matter of style of being is often shoved aside as if it is merely a stereotype. it is not so simple at all and it is, many times, if not most of the time something that cannot be changed in the same way that sexual orientation cannot be changed. And people are attacked,  isolated and hated for it.  In other words there is this issue of styles of being or forms of being and people are being variously hurt for them but those matters of style with being are shoved aside as if they don't really count and the only thing that counts is what sexual organ you want to put in your mouth. Leaving aside what a stupid way that is to talk about sex, you are eliminating all kinds of circumstances of the use of the word gay. Along with that use is the understanding that accompanies it and the social circumstances in which it occurs. The politicization of sexuality tends to force multiple phenomena into singular categories without nuance. You are moving to the defense of the standard accepted usage today for good reasons but ultimately I think that the usage itself is poor and I don't go along with it.  Why exactly do we have to collect everyone together who experiences in their sexuality an organ of the same gender vs one of the opposite gender? And why exactly do we have to ignore the profound differences between people with certain kinds of feminine styles and people with certain kinds of masculine styles? To me, the meaning of gay and straight is so overwhelmingly more in the direction of style of being and not in the direction of gender preference in terms of sexual engagement that I think the usage should be reserved precisely for this matter of style of being. I maintain the position I have and reserve homosexual and heterosexual to refer to gender orientation with regards to sexual activity and attraction."
gaybros,3afdg0,ravia,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:51:21 2015 UTC,"I completely recognise that this is some people's natural way of being, regardless of their sexual orientation. I'd be stupid not to, and I personally don't hate anyone for it. I won't say that people like that are always the victims, as it's possible for anyone of any sexuality/gender/whatever to attack, isolate and hate, but yes, they generally do have it worse.  Those ways of being absolutely do count, but the main point I'm trying to make is that they're not the same as being gay. Your proposed definition is just too vague, as it encompasses too much. You would begin to have people confused and needing confirmation if you were to ever refer to someone as 'gay' (""wait, do you mean he's gay gay, or just gay?"") It's also a vicious circle - people who are perceived as gay by your definition would then largely be consistent of homosexuals, and so the stereotype would just reform itself and the synonymity of the two would return.  I believe many people use ""queer"" now as a reclaimed term in the same sense that you want to use ""gay"". It's a much more open word in that it's not solely about who you want to sleep with, and more about celebrating this ""different"" culture as opposed to the heteronormative one that is a large part of society. I'm still not 100% many people would use it extend to feminine straight guys/masculine straight women, but it seems to be a more appropriate word than ""gay"". Or possibly ""androgynous"" in some cases?  I get where you're coming from, and I can see you're well-intentioned with this, but I honestly just don't get the logic of taking a word and applying it to a ""similar-but-different"" scenario, as all that does it create confusion and miscommunication. To me, the culture you're trying to define by this is too large to just 'borrow' another word, especially when we already have more fitting words to describe it."

gaybros,3afee1,RideOnBart,19,Fri Jun 19 22:17:54 2015 UTC,"Chick tracts are hilarious, honestly. For a while there were some people passing them out near our campus. They're blatantly and comically racist, homophobic etc. One of them featured a line of white people walking up to heaven while a line of black/Asian/Catholic/Jewish people trudged on a literal road to hell.  Even the ones that aren't bigoted are unexpectedly funny. I remember one in particular, is about some poor little girl who's homeless and panhandling. A priest approaches her, and I thought he was going to help her, and it was going to be a lesson about Christian charity. But instead, he tells her about Jesus, leaves her on the street, and then she dies and goes to heaven."
gaybros,3afee1,econstud,10,Fri Jun 19 23:14:17 2015 UTC,I think my favorite Chick tract is the one on DnD where apparently magic is real and the mage player can actually cast mind control spells because secret DnD covens taught her how. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJjtU7vxx-Q&list=RDmp-zcHWHXiY&index=3&ab_channel=TheBibleReloaded  Also if you're interested The biblereloaded youtube channel does narration/reading of chick tracts on a fairly regular basis.

You can tell they're written by some 75 year old who remembers a simpler time when everyone fell in to line with societal norms. You can also tell how antiquated they are by the names. Everyone (especially the kids for some reason) all have names no one has used for decades: Betty, Susie, Billy.   My favorite gay themed one is the one that tells of the dangers of gays speaking to children in schools and they may recruit children!!  In this one, two gay dentists are invited to speak at a school by an evil witch teacher. Yeah, that's how I turned out gay: because some gay dentists!"

You and I, we are one/Cause freaks have more fun  It is an understatement to say that one cannot prep a Dada Life rave.  Candy Pills Ice Cream Thrills  Oversized inflatable bananas and champagne bottles, SMILES, one HUGE inflatable banana larger than the stage itself and a club-wide pillow fight later I left home with shards of glass in my hair.  As for Above and Beyond, my best bro puts it best, watching Above and Beyond preform is like meeting God and witnessing love. It was a shame that when they played here in Austin, they has a sister pass away just days before the show. Still, love will triumph and the music conveyed that fact."

gaybros,3af0zv,jersing,17,Fri Jun 19 16:26:03 2015 UTC,"Hopefully these add something and aren't just random complaints. Looks like I'm partially echoing other comments.   Shirts for tall guys: Generally a lose-lose choice between several options: good torso fit with sleeves that are childishly short, or sufficient sleeve length with a torso that billows like a trash bag. For button downs, it's very difficult to find L (long) lengths in stores, so you end up with shirts that untuck in the back every time you sit down, which looks slovenly. And for the record, the 'big and tall' section is called big and tall for a reason; there is no 'big or tall' section. Pants for tall guys: America caters to shorter, stocky guys. Nothing wrong with short and stocky, except it can be very difficult to find even 32x34 pants to try on. Size 13 shoes: Some stores don't even carry them (our local JCP). Some stores get about 2 pairs in at a time and we have to fight over them. Oh, and they stop making half sizes after 12. So if a brand runs large or small, you're SOL if you want to find a size 12.5 or 13.5--they just don't exist. Business shoes: Why do they all have heels? I suspect it's because height is supposed to subconsciously grant more authority--but it's just a useless arms race since every single pair of men's shoes has one inch heels. It feels really uncomfortable after a long day and I don't need to be taller. Ties: Why do we still do ties? They're awkward, uncomfortable, and completely devoid of utility. The tie clips I've used tend to rotate out of place even without a coat on, and then look sloppy when they're not exactly horizontal. Tie pins leave holes in my tie. I envy women not having to wear ties. Business/official dress in general: Why can't I show more skin? I overheat way to easily in long sleeves and slacks all the time. Can I have a more open collar or show off more arms and legs like women? If I have to shave to show off my calves then I will. If I have to wear a man dress to get a little air then I'll make it look damn good. Men's clothing colors: Dark and drab, because bright colors are incompatible with masculinity. In the market for a winter coat? Hope you like black. Occasionally you might find blue or grey, and if you're lucky you might catch a glimpse of an elusive brown coat--but they're out of your size. Men's watches: Why do I have to wear a hockey puck on my wrist? Is this just a pissing contest or is there something wrong with small watches that don't get in the way? Glasses: Standard lengths for the arms sucks. Can't they make them just a little shorter or longer? Nosepads and bending the earpieces can only help so much. We can't all have the exact same nasal bridge-to-ear length, and they're often made for and modeled on Caucasian men with longer, pointier faces and noses."
gaybros,3af0zv,whoremongering,6,Fri Jun 19 20:05:56 2015 UTC,"Seconding the woes of formal/business clothing. It's all basically a very slight variation (both in style and color) of the suit, but if you look at the options for women, there's so much more variation (dresses of various style, color and length, pantsuits) possible.  Like, the most variation"
gaybros,3af0zv,fluffhoof,4,Fri Jun 19 20:29:12 2015 UTC,The watch thing is one of my bigger annoyances. Why are all watches larger than my wrist now?  It looks ridiculous and is uncomfortable.

More universal concerns are bright colors and whether or not men can wear jewelry besides watches, wedding bands, and religious tokens.

This isn't very ""bro"" but I recently bought a pair of cheap women's jeans (light blue, nothing distinguishably feminine about them. Like these*) and they are one of the best fits I've had in my life! I was apprehensive to buy them - because gender roles - but at the end of the day it's basic ass fabric and they're a pair of pants, yano? I got over it, tried them on in the store and was a changed man. My thighs fit. My ass wasn't baggy because I needed a bigger size for my thighs. Everything was snug, but not creepy tight. And they are comfy as hell! It was a done deal there and then.           Try on stretch denim next time. Should make a difference."

gaybros,3af0zv,comic_serif,9,Sat Jun 20 14:43:36 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest problem for me is the way fashion media portrays what fashionable men are supposed to look like. Outside of street style photography, most, if not all fashion campaigns have a muscular Caucasian male as the model wearing x brand. As a Sri Lankan guy, I find it frustrating that high end brands such as lv, Gucci, zegna etc are apparently reserved for 30 something year old Caucasian males, as if men of colour have no interest in premium quality clothing. The cheaper the suits get, the more men of colour you see wearing them in the advertisement/campaigns. Which then further perpetuates stereotypes and racism. Rant done. Sorry."
gaybros,3af0zv,Wearenotmodels,3,Sat Jun 20 03:32:04 2015 UTC,"My biggest issue is that everything is a different size. I'll order a T-shirt online and it will show up as a large and fit like a medium. Or it will fit as expected and shrink a full size after the first wash.  We are constantly having to buy my partner new clothes because he's so tall. He'll find a shirt he really likes and the arm length will be right. We wash it once, and the sleeves shrink to the point where he won't wear it anymore.  Apparently most of my height is in my torso because I have an extremely difficult time finding the right waist/inseam combination. I often end up making a sacrifice of either a little looser in the waist or a little longer in the leg. The worst is finding a pair of jeans that are your exact size but they've got some weird bleached in pattern on them.   Consequently, when I find clothes that fit I tend to wear them until they can't be worn anymore."

gaybros,3af0zv,AcidicR,2,Fri Jun 19 23:43:51 2015 UTC,"Cost of the articles dominates for one. I find that dressing well costs more in the States than in Europe. I think the consumers in the States have a bigger emphasis on disposable clothing that frays and falls apart after a year or two. So anything that's a bit better quality is that much more expensive because the market for it is smaller. I'll often opt to buy slightly pricier and durable, ""safe"" options that I can wear often, rather something more eccentric.  A personal issue is size. I need a 30 - 32W and a 36L. Even higher end department stores rarely have more than a few options. Buying directly from G-Star or Diesel online works, but then you have to know exactly what you want and how the cut or whatever fits on you. That limits options.  Beyond that I have a limited time finding clothes that adhere to my ""style"". I don't really consult magazines or websites for style tips - it's more informed by movies, what I see guys around me wearing, brands I latched onto as a younger guy, and stuff like that. I feel like men's clothing breaks down to street-wear, business casual, shades of formal wear, and athletic/hangout stuff with some seasonal inputs. I probably wont really go shopping more than once or twice a year, wear things till they wear out, and just pick up things as I need them."

I've been trying to fix my diet over the past year, and I plan to start working exercise into my routine over the summer. Basically, I may be slow, but I am trying to work towards a healthier me. Long story short, I got into college this fall, and I want to buy clothes because frankly, I have about 6 pairs of pants I wear, 4 being tan khakis, and 2 being nice black pants. And I have about two shirts that actually look decent on me that aren't messy t-shirts.  As much as I want to go shopping and find some decent looking clothes for some self-confidence, I just feel awkward about shopping for clothes. My mom was trying to be helpful the other day, showing me some shirts online, but all the models were these super in shape guys, and all I could think was ""that shirt wouldn't look like that on me."" I know that I need to work on fitness, and I've been taking the beginning steps to get there, but does being out of shape mean that I can't wear clothes that look nice on me?  I suppose it's more of a mental block than anything else, but there's a part of me that feels silly for even wanting to buy new clothes. Part of the reason outside of self-confidence that I didn't buy more new clothes in the past was that I didn't want to be enabling myself to get fatter. In fact, several of my decent clothes are some I got from my dad because a certain occasion called for it. I guess my question is, should I feel silly for wanting to wear nice clothes? Yes, I want to work on fitness and improve my health, but does that mean I can't try to look my best in the process?   I don't know if I'm the type of person you're looking for, but I figured I would throw my story out there. Have a nice day."

All of these factors together make clothes shopping a nightmare. If I find a shirt that fits my shoulders and chest, it'll be too tight around my waist and hips. If it's comfortable around my hips, the chest and shoulders will be baggy and the shirt will often be way too long.   I can only buy jeans from a specific shop that stocks 32x30 trousers. I can also only wear slim/skinny cut jeans, because regular cut are way too wide around my tiny ankles.  Shoes. Where do I start with shoes? I have size 6 feet.

gaybros,3af0zv,armybro4life,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:49:20 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you're still looking but for me I tend to find these as my problems. For petite, short guys.   Shirts tends to run too long, both arm length and shirt length itself. Also tends to be too roomy. Looks like we're drowning rather then it fitting correctly.  Pants and jeans tend to run too long. It's difficult to find jeans running in 28x28 without it costing a fortune for just one pair. Even then, the fit can be awkward at times. Too tight at the calves or too loose.   Now my personal opinions..  What seems like a trend here is wearing brighter colors = feminine. Totally not true. You can wear bright colors and still have it ""masculine."" I feel that every guy should at least have a bright colored shirt (besides blue and red because those tend to be a trend in itself) that complements their skin tone and a different colored pants/jeans besides the common khaki/blue/black.   Now shoes. I believe we should have versatility in our shoes. One thing that every guy should have for sure is a pair of nice dress shoes. A good extra is a nice pair of boots too. For myself, I mainly have trainers/running shoes. I have burgundy hi-top Chuck Taylor's that's dual purpose for casual and weight lifting, black Nike's and Salomons for work/running/hiking, dark brown boots for casual/hiking, tan/dark brown boat shoes for formal/casual and of course black dress shoes (pointed, not squared) for formal.  Ties. Necessary to have the plain black tie. A nice colored tie should be avaliable as well. I have 4 ties. One black, one white, a checkered red and purple, and a striped blue and green.

When I was about 8 or 9 years old, he was bragging about how he always knew when someone was gay, even before they knew it themselves. He used to be a primary school (or whatever that's called elsewhere) teacher, so the kids he had in his class were 12yo tops. He said that he'd always know if one of his kids would turn out to be gay. And sure enough at reunions he would meet the kids all grown up and they would have same sex partners, just like he called it.   And I don't exactly now how this interaction went from bragging to this, but I very distinctively remember him claiming that ""there's no way that you are gay, I've seen so many kids that later in life turned out to be gay, you're not one of them. I know that, I can see that."" Please note, I had no idea about my sexuality at that point at all. It wasn't something that I was concerned about, it just didn't exist in my child life yet. But I do remember feeling kind of relieved after he told me that. Somehow it felt reassuring that if my dad thinks I'm not gay, that must be true, and it probably is a good thing.   Of course I did turn out gay and I didn't have any trouble with my parents coming out. They're great people and are very open minded towards stuff like this. I talked to my dad about this later because it was a specific conversation that always stayed with me. He didn't remember it.   Which made me think about the way we talk to and treat our children. My dad never had negative feelings about gay people and has always been super open minded. It wasn't even important enough for him to remember. He never had any intention to make me and my siblings feel like it's a problem to be a little different. But somehow he did plant that seed with a seemingly innocent remark towards his child.

gaybros,3adsvc,Kichigai,7,Fri Jun 19 15:45:38 2015 UTC,"Stargate is totally separate from Star Trek, and so divorced from the movie that you could probably start off with the first episode of the first season of SG-1 provided someone gives you a little backstory. The movie isn't totally awful, especially if you want to watch something with Kurt Russel, James Spader (before he got snarky and portly; the Wikipedia says he took the job because he thought the script was ""awful""), or French Stewart, and it does provide a bit more in-depth backstory for the show. Just note that they chuck out a ton of the original premise. The first few seasons are a lot heavier and more serious than the rest of the series, but that's because it started out on Shotime before it was handed off to SciFi. The show starts to drop off in quality around season 6, though 9 and 10 weren't absolutely awful. When you get to the SG-1 movies, just stick to chronological order, otherwise nothing will make sense.  From there you can move into Stargate Atlantis, which technically occurs concurrently with the last few seasons of SG-1, but is air-gapped enough that it feels mostly disconnected. Universe is a similar story, but don't expect much closure, I wasn't able to follow the show to its conclusion so I don't know if they ever resolved the series-long plot arc or not.    As far as Star Trek you can jump in almost anywhere, really, but The Next Generation sets up enough back story that you might want to watch the first few seasons (at least through 4) before jumping on Deep Space Nine or Voyager. As far as Voyager and DS9 go, the only thing they have in common is that the first episode of VOY takes place on DS9 (the station, not the show).  The Next Generation did a great job with character development, fleshing out an amazing universe, and walking a tightrope between introspection for the characters, space operas, bottle episodes, and major events. The first season and the last couple are the weakest, with a number of episodes you can easily skip, but the finalé is probably the best amongst the whole franchise.  Now, this is where opinions become divided. TNG was Gene Roddenberry's baby, and it showed us the Federation as a utopia. Voyager, to a large extent, follows that same kind of opinion of the Federation. However Voyager is known for abusing the reset button (ship's blow'd up? Don't worry, it'll be perfect in next week's episode) lacking in larger plot arcs, exploiting deus ex machina a bit, being heavy on the technobabble (they dial it back eventually, but it's like molasses in the first season), turning seemingly invincible foes (like the Borg) into pushovers, and retconning itself. It's got some really cringe-worthy episodes but on the whole I'd say the series is a 6-7 out of 10. The finalé is total bullshit, though.  Deep Space Nine, however, Gene would have disliked if he were alive for the later seasons. It shows a bit grittier universe, where the Federation isn't perfect. Things get political, there's ambition for power, espionage, assassination, a degree of xenophobia, and all-out war. In my opinion it's the best series out of the franchise because, if you can get past the first couple seasons, it starts to feel more realistic, and the quality of writing is vastly superior, with Ronald D. Moore (creator of the Battlestar Galactica reboot) contributing a lot. It's also known for its larger plot arcs, with the series becoming rather serialized towards the end. It's very much more a serious and mature show than any of the other of the series. The finalé ties everything together in a tight little bow, but isn't as good as TNG's.  So this leaves the stragglers: The Original Series, Enterprise, the movies, and The Animated Series. TOS is this kind of floating disconnected thing. All of Star Trek is anchored by it, ostensibly directly connected to it, but in reality it's just so different that you could probably get away with never watching it. I'd say, though, it's worth watching if only as a historical artifact of the 1960s. The first interracial kiss, or how they would make a commentary on the war in Viet Nam by using aliens as proxies for the Communists, things like that. I found it really entertaining, nonetheless. There's not much for character development (remember: it's the 60's, if it couldn't be sold off for syndicated reruns where stuff would air out of order it wouldn't be greenlit) but the characters themselves are extremely likable. There is no finalé, that's handled in the movies.  Enterprise is entertaining too, but because of the fact it's supposed to take place before TOS, it's completely independent of the rest of the franchise. Take it or leave it. The first couple seasons tried to capture some of the TOS spirit mixed in with being true explorers (mankind's first steps into deep space) coupled with conflict with the Vulcans (who want us to be more restrained with our exploration). The third season is a whole plot arc that I won't spoil for you, but probably was the strongest (and the darkest) of the whole series, trying to capture what held people to DS9. The fourth tried to mix the two, with multi-part episodes, but a lighter tone. I liked Enterprise, but I can see why a lot of people didn't. The finalé felt rushed (probably because it was) but wasn't that bad.  The Animated Series is the red-headed stepchild of the whole franchise, and something I've never watched. It's considered non-canonical, though some of the ideas and concepts it introduced were recycled later on. All the original cast reprise their voices, but it's a wacky trip through 1960s children's programming, complete with a producer who was color blind (hence why the colors seem off so often). Take it or leave it, one of these days I'll probably watch it.  Now, the movies. There's a longstanding attitude that the even numbered movies are the only good ones, and for the most part that's true. They were the best received and the best written. For the most part you can skip most of the odd numbered movies and come out alright.  I/The Motion Picture was a 1970s product (just look at the uniforms), with the production somewhat influenced by 2001: A Space Odyssey. They tried to be deep and more than just a space opera, but it ended up being so slow and wordy that no one really liked it. It's not awful, but it's kind of like watching Das Boot. This one is easily skipped.  II/The Wrath of Kahn is considered to be one of the two best movies. It's recommended that you watch TOS or at least the episode ""Space Seed"" to understand this movie. You can enjoy it without ever watching that episode, though, but you won't know the backstory. This movie actually sets off a trilogy.  III/The Search for Spock wasn't all that great, but it's interesting conceptually. It goes pure space opera on us, so don't expect deep philosophy. It's harder to skip as it directly leads into the next movie (which will make no goddamn sense if you don't understand what happened, so at least read a synopsis) and sets up a little bit of VI.  IV/The Voyage Home is the most unique entry, and along with Kahn is considered the best. Definitely worth a watch, with Nemoy running the show. It's more light hearted, despite the seriousness of their mission, but not too much so. Lots of great jokes, it invents some tropes, you just can't skip this one. It has no lasting impact on the rest of the franchise, but it's just so good you have to watch it.  V/The Final Frontier is crap. Shatner complained that since Nemoy got to make the last film he gets to make this one, and it sucks out loud. I'm embarrassed to admit that as a child it was my favorite. It's too goofy when it shouldn't be, when it's serious you can't take it seriously, the whole concept is dumb, it breaks a lot rules, and there's just nothing redeeming about it (except maybe Uhura's fan dance, as a trope). It was so bad Gene Roddenberry himself declared it non-canonical, so you can skip it easily.  VI/The Undiscovered Country is probably my favorite of the TOS crewed movies. Gene Roddenberry hated it because of the fact it shows the Federation as imperfect and flawed, but I think it just adds to the film's quality. It looks higher budget than it was, the acting was pretty good, the writing was good, and it does add a sense of closure to the original crew. It taps a little bit into the events of Spock, so keep that in mind before watching it. It very much was a product of the end of the Cold War, so you'll see shades of that in the plot, but it's not so heavy handed it'll distract you. And as an ensemble piece, every character gets their moment, which feels like a very satisfying way to cap things off.  VII/Generations demonstrates that the cap wasn't on tight enough. It's not the worst movie, but it's not that great. There was pretty much no budget, so it really does look like they just brought movie cameras into the TNG set (which, funny enough, a lot of it was stolen from the TOS movie sets). Not only that, but the wardrobe budget only allowed for two new uniforms to be made, so not everyone got them, and some people were stuck wearing other people's uniforms from DS9. Basically anything with Kirk in it is weak, but everything outside of that was pretty good, but it really does just feel like a higher budget episode of TNG. On the good side, though, it adds depth to both Picard and Data, which will be commonplace throughout the rest of the movies."
gaybros,3adsvc,Kichigai,5,Fri Jun 19 19:11:35 2015 UTC,"VIII/First Contact vies with Kahn and Voyage Home for the title of best. It's dark, but James Cromwell does a great job lightening the mood. It plays on very human themes, it's well acted, has a great budget, and was fantastically written. You really can't skip this one. And if you're going to watch Voyager, watch this before you get into the ""Scorpion"" two parter as this sets up a lot about the Borg that separates it from TNG's presentation, which you will be expected to just ""know.""  IX/Insurrection was revived the trend of odd numbered movies sucking. The plot is kinda dumb, and the whole movie is totally forgettable. The best part is F. Murray Abraham's acting (but not his writing) and Data's character development (though he is the butt of a number of jokes that just should never have been written in the first place). It's easily skipped, and never referenced to ever again.  X/Nemesis is easily the worst of the even numbered movies, but by no means apocalyptic. The plot is shockingly linear and simplistic, but it has some good action sequences. I didn't like the design cues for the antagonists, but on the whole the movie felt satisfyingly dark, so it's not like there was this weird clash, aesthetically. It isn't nearly as satisfying an end to the TNG crew, but it does at least deal with the aging android problem, that Brent Spinner was concerned with, in a way that I think worked out well. I thought it was better than Insurrection, but the critics disagree with me, so take it for what it's worth.  Now we get into what's sometimes called NuTrek. The 2009 Star Trek is Star Trek in name only, and has no connection to anything else in the Star Trek universe beyond names and vague concepts. It was written so you could walk into the theater having never ever seen anything else with that name on it (coincidentally this is also how J. J. Abrams came into writing the movie: having never seen it). I hate what they did with Spock (but I liked Quinto). A lot of the characters seemed to simply have been turned into joke delivery platforms, there's a useless romance involved, but at least Jonathan Cho gets to kick some ass (he's the only one allowed to besides Pine and Quinto). I'd say start watching it at some point and see if you like it.  Star Trek: Into Darkness was better. Everyone expected them to make a Wrath of Kahn, so they made a Wrath of Kahn-like movie. Cumberbatch isn't bad, but I'm not sold on the writing for him. The writing, on the whole, though was much better than the first movie, and gives me hope that Star Trek Beyond (with Simon Pegg on the writing crew) will be good. I hate what they did to the Klingons (and if you liked DS9 you probably will too), and the ending is bullshit (especially if you liked the ending of Kahn). I'd give 6-7 out of 10. It felt like a much more solid movie than the one before it. A lot less stupid jokes, and the humor that it had required less deus ex machina to make it fit into the events in the plot.  Star Trek Beyond is the movie coming out in 2016 as part of the 50th anniversary of Star Trek. J.J. won't be directing this one because he's tied up with Star Wars, but as I mentioned, Simon Pegg is in on the writing crew, which gives me some hope since, if memory serves, he actually liked Star Trek prior to being in the movies, so hopefully it'll be better.    For a chronological viewing order:   Enterprise The Original Series Star Trek I-VI The Next Generation Generations Deep Space Nine seasons 1-4 Voyager (occurs concurrently, but disconnected, from here on out) First Contact Deep Space Nine seasons 5-7 Insurrection Nemesis   For production order just move Enterprise to the end."

Ha ha, I actually grew up with my family watching a lot of Star Trek, so I just kind of picked it up. On top of that I work in media production, so this kind of critiquing comes naturally to me.   I think I will get around to watch Star Trek first, starting of with TNG, is the episodes not ""connected""(can't think of the term)   The term is ""episodic.""   are they each individual stories or are some of the skip-able episodes just that pointless?   There's a couple of two-parters, but there are no larger story arcs. When a bad episode came down the line the writers knew how awful they were by the time they aired, so few of them are ever referenced. Except for a few key episodes, like Sarek, or Best of Both Worlds there is very little that's referential in terms of plot events. However once you get to around the fourth season or so then character development will happen (relationships, etc).   In a way it seems like I will have to watch the majority of the things you mentioned for the sake of pop-culture and novelty from these (in)famous pieces of history.   Really in terms of pop-culture impact TOS and TNG were the most impactful. DS9 never really caught on with most people, and Voyager was not well received. Same thing with every movie after First Contact until you get to NuTrek.   Sorry for not writing a grand reply like yours, I am just in awe over the length and quality of your reply   I didn't really expect it.

gaybros,3a7wxn,Kevinement,103,Thu Jun 18 05:56:52 2015 UTC,And that is a call to the police station that I would pay good money to hear.
gaybros,3a7wxn,signu1230,40,Wed Jun 17 23:14:39 2015 UTC,"I had a cop show up once cause one of my tree branches fell into my neighbors yard after they cut it off with a saw.   I told the cop my neighbors yard experiences gravity the same as everyone else's yard but it scared him and he didn't like it.  For context, this branch was less then two inches thick."
gaybros,3a7wxn,blue_surfboard,2,Thu Jun 18 07:39:31 2015 UTC,"So, did you have to cut it or something? In germany there are specific regulations about how high plants can be depending on how close it is to the property boundary. If a plant doesn't meet the regulations, your neighbour can demand from you that you cut it.  It's actually a very sensible law to have, to prevent people from blocking light, or just taking up space in the neighbours garden. It's questionable how sensible your neighbours police call was."
gaybros,3a7wxn,modmodmodmodmod,2,Thu Jun 18 12:57:23 2015 UTC,"He cut it cause he could reach it, that was it. It was off of an apple tree and growing slightly over into his yard, most of it was still in mine, and it was shading some gravel. The most hilarious part was a couple months later he came over to ask if he could pick a bunch of my apples cause his wife wanted to make apple sauce. I told him no, he picked them anyway.  The branch fell into his hard cause he was pulling on it, had he just cut it at the property line a tiny little bit would have fallen into his yard. I didn't have to do a thing, the cop told him to deal with his own mess and that was the end of it.  The law here is pretty clear, as long as we are not in an environmental or wetland zone (we are not) he can cut branches where they cross the property line and they then become his problem. If the tree is threatening damage, like leaning over his house, or falls from my hard into his then its my problem. So many huge trees here that this is very well known law. We have no laws about how tall plants can be next to the neighbors, I share a 200 ft tall (excuse me, 60 meter) tree with a different neighbor, about 10% of the tree is on my property now. It was all originally on their side but grew across the line. Lots of trees and the law makes it hard to remove them and easy to add more.  Neighbor is just a wackjob that wants everyone else to get in trouble for stuff. He was absolutely in the wrong to call the police and I could have gotten him in a tiny bit of trouble for cutting the branch well on my side of the fence."

Given your degrees, they are also the most likely place where you could find jobs that could utilize what you've been studying.  However, the Pacific NW is a great place to live overall and there are many places in it where you could call home.  I'd recommend looking at a map of Washington and Oregon.  See where the I5 highway runs?  (basically vertical north to south)  Nearly all of the ""major"" cities are on it or near to it.  The area surrounding I5 is the wet, liberal and typically gay friendly part of the states.  East of I5, you'll find things to be more dry, desert like and conservative.  There are exceptions to this, of course.  Spokane and Boise are big cities with decent gay populations that would welcome you.  However, if you end up in a small town in the conservative part of the states, you may find exactly what you were looking to escape."

gaybros,3ach8l,brr_its_cold,8,Fri Jun 19 02:31:27 2015 UTC,"Hey- I live in Seattle. The job market here is great, there is a lot of economic growth. Portland you'll have a harder time in because the job market is saturated with highly educated/no experience kids who just moved there straight out of college.   The traffic, the cost of living, and the passive-aggressive people make Seattle a tough city to adjust to. I came with stars in my eyes, but the honeymoon faded quickly. 100% of my friends and network are people who also moved to Seattle at the same time and are frustrated about the ""Seattle Freeze""- a phenomenon where locals are very polite to new comers but keep them at a purposeful distance.   There are more affordable and friendlier options like Bellingham and Eugene to consider- but with smaller economies jobs are scarcer.   Don't forget the inland Northwest- Spokane, Bend, even Boise are amazing cities. They actually get some snow- have just as great access to the outdoors- are so much more affordable! They're more conservative overall, but don't count them out.   Hope that helps!"
gaybros,3ach8l,brr_its_cold,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:51:36 2015 UTC,Do you mind me asking what neighborhood you live in? Or just ones that you like and would recommend?
gaybros,3ach8l,vanisaac,3,Fri Jun 19 01:06:31 2015 UTC,"Sure! I live in Green Lake. It's nice, and convenient. My favorite neighborhoods I can afford are Greenwood, Green Lake, West Seattle, and Columbia City.   Greenwood is kinda gritty, less Seattle pretentious. Green Lake is really active and everything is shinny and new. West Seattle is not really urban or suburban- it's kind of a middle way. A lot of families. Great community/neighborly feel. Columbia City is gentrifying. There are some relatively sketchy areas nearby- but the core is safe and happening.   My favorite neighborhoods outside my budget: Wallingford, Ballard, East Lake. Wallingford is just cute- idk- I feel really at home there. Ballard is really fun- it's a gentrified old industrial neighborhood. There a lot of bros there- sometimes I feel like it's college again- but it's got a really good energy. East Lake is nice because you have a beautiful neighborhood that is quit - but immediate access to downtown and Capitol Hill.   Capitol Hill is the hub of the gay community- and it's really fun. But I'm also turning 30 soon, so it's not really somewhere I want to live. It can get a little rowdy. But if I was fresh from college, I would 100% want to move there or maybe Ballard. It's definitely trendy with the tech industry employees which is driving up rent fast.   A lot of people like Georgetown. It's surrounded by industrial areas and Boeing Field. It's kinda quirky and affordable- but it's not really my scene.  The Udistrict is too wild for me- it's really alternative. Last time I was there I think there were still Occupy Protests happening. There's great food! But it's just too much for me.   Those are the main neighborhoods. There are a lot more- but you're starting to get far away from the urban core."
gaybros,3ach8l,BillyIsUnstuck,4,Fri Jun 19 01:29:43 2015 UTC,"Boy, I drove through Greenwood just a couple weeks ago for the first time in a few years, and I was amazed at how many new condos had sprouted up in the meantime.

gaybros,3ach8l,truefantastic,4,Fri Jun 19 07:52:54 2015 UTC,"Not sure why this is the top answer. Two young college grads living completely across the country probably don't have it in their budget to fly there for interviews and the chances of finding a job willing to fly them out is slim to none for a new grad (absolutely zero for someone looking for music Ed job) and they're less likely to find a job just through phone interviews, not impossible but much less likely. I don't think it's the worst idea for two young guys to have some adventure and move across country with no set plans. Find any job once you arrive to pay the bills and then start looking for real jobs. What's that expression? It's the journey not the destination that matters. Best of luck guys."

gaybros,3ach8l,hiddencountry,3,Fri Jun 19 01:42:39 2015 UTC,"If you want the opinion of someone who just moved to Seattle, I love the city. I'm here for school at UW, but was easily able to find an additional job. Like /u/brr_its_cold I live by Greenlake, and would recommend the neighborhood. It’s affordable, near a very popular park, and close to the major roads on the north side (I-5, Aurora, Ravenna, 45th). However, know that it will be hard to get to know people here; I ran into the Seattle freeze, but got around it by joining a couple of intramural leagues. You and your boyfriend could do the same. Don’t get me wrong though, I would definitely recommend the city to others.  My question would be what kind of culture are you looking for? Seattle is different from Portland, which is different from Spokane. You might want to get away from socially conservative areas (I came from Alabama), but you guys need to ask yourself what you want your destination to look like. In other words, think in terms of where you all are headed, rather than where you come from."

So if I were to move to Seattle, and money weren't were less of an object, I would move to Pioneer Square. It's a historic district. It's hip, it's fun... but it's gentrified and pricy. But that's just me.  (Edit: reading this again I made it sounds like Pioneer Square was cost prohibitive. It's not. It's just on the pricier side.)  Central District is a great blend between price consciousness and quality. I just checked and the median income is in the $55k range. Great nightlife there.  I think Capitol Hill, around Broadway is the gayborhood of Seattle, relatively. But daaaaang, it's expensive. Check out North Beacon Hill, because that's kinda a cheaper and (last time I was there) up-and-coming gayborhood.  If you have any specific questions about the area, let me know!"

gaybros,3ach8l,gitismatt,2,Fri Jun 19 20:47:21 2015 UTC,"Fourth generation Cap Hill, Seattle here. I've traveled all around and there's no place better. Portlands cool but it's much smaller and more eccentric.   The Seattle freeze is totally a thing so keep that in mind. Us locals will be super nice but probably won't really make friendships with you. It's not that we're jerks or anything against you. It's just transplants move through here so often that if we made friendships with every nice Midwesterner who was looking to hang we'd never do anything else.   As for the economy it's definitely strong. Lots of new jobs but also lots of competition. Breaking in the specific industry's you've both got I'd going to be tough though.   My recondition is get a job doing something not in your field to pay the bills while you find work. Like a furniture installer or just anything that pays better than minimum wage that anyone can still get. I work in Human Resources and could give you some leads if you'd like.  The other tough thing about Seattle will he finding a place to rent. Things go super fast and it can be tough to find a place while still living out of town.   If you can handle all that Seattle's got great food, bars, people, climate, hiking, biking, camping, clubs, and just about anything a hippie or yuppie could want."
gaybros,3ach8l,Joeskyyy,2,Fri Jun 19 21:40:15 2015 UTC,"Please come to Seattle-Tacoma! Gay guys are always welcome and we need to bolster our numbers ( in Seattle or the region )  as much as possible. I doubt you'd have any trouble making friends. I, along with the other natives, tend to frost the straight transplants pretty hard, but have always been welcoming of gay men.  I have heard somewhat negative things about the teaching scene from various people. Mostly that it's super difficult to get a job at the elementary or secondary school levels. If you're really worried about costs, then you should definitely consider Tacoma, where it's possible to buy a decent house on a teacher's salary. $150,000-$250,000 buys you a very nice place in Tacoma. In Seattle, you're looking at $400,000 to $600,000 for the same house ( if you're not almost immediately outbid by an all cash buyer ).  Do not move here without a job or $7500-$10,000 for expenses if you plan on job hunting when you move here. Tacoma might be doable on $5000, but you'd definitely need $10,000 to move to Seattle without a job, as $2000-$2500 would immediately vaporize on first/last/security.  The winters are long and dark, and take up half the year, or as long as 8 months some years. I've watched quite a few transplants slowly go insane. I've watched many leave. You need to be realistic about your ability to tolerate long periods of rain, mist, and gray. If you need sun, move to Denver instead. It offers most of the same things, costs about the same, but the weather is wonderful."
gaybros,3ach8l,rylandmaine,2,Sat Jun 20 08:20:06 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to say that Portland is the better choice over Seattle. I like Portland, it is a big city but with a small town feel. People here are generally really nice and helpful. They are a little strange sure but very friendly. Seattle on the other hand is a big city in all respects and friendliness is hard to find. I once got lost in the city and couldn't find a single person willing to stop and let me ask them for directions, I literally stumbled upon the library and had to ask a librarian. That kind of ruined me on Seattle.   The cool thing about Portland is that their are towns outside of it where living is cheaper but getting into town is still so easy. I live in Hillsboro, 12 miles outside of Portland and can drive to downtown in about 15 mins or ride the train in to downtown in about 40mins. The country and hiking are only about 10mins away and the coast is only an hour away.   I came from the south and I'm very happy here in Portland it feels like home but with people who are more open minded"

gaybros,3a9l57,drakkmo,15,Thu Jun 18 08:56:20 2015 UTC,"Personally, as a male rape survivor living in the UK, I wish there was something like this near me. Most psychological help for rape victims is strictly for women, which is fine, but they don't seem to cater to men, a service that is desperately needed considering that the rape/sexual assault of men has other side issues as well specifically to do with gender-expectations of men and masculinity which is further exacerbated by this nonsense idea that ""men don't/can't get raped"".  Whilst, rape is clearly an awful crime for anyone to experience, it's telling that the only help for rape victims caters towards women, there isn't anywhere for men to go and it assumes that women are victims and men are rapists which is frankly wrong.  Anyone can be a victim/survivor or a rapist, it is in issue outside of gender and all about consent."

What happened to me I think, is that mp3 players became ubiquitous in the 2000's so I stopped listening to the radio and discovering new songs. Last year I got Spotify and I keep on discovering new and not so new songs I really like. It kinda feels like I'm a teenager again because every week or two I find a song that I really like and it becomes my theme for that period. Afterwards whenever I hear it again, it starts to feel like one of the 90's songs that I never stopped liking."

The big bands. The Ink Spots, Dean Martin, Nat King Cole, Sinatra, and most of all Ella Fitzgerald, the rightful First Lady of Song. There's such a purity of tone in the way they sing - Ella especially. It's so elegant, so beautiful. Some of the songs are simple, but they're smooth, and convey so much emotion.

gaybros,3aa3jg,meaninglessbark,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:30:58 2015 UTC,"This is your brain on default mode.  Fight it.   People imprint on the music of their teenage years. This is why radio makes money off nostalgia stations. The ""in"" nostalgia sound is always the music of whatever generation has acquired disposable income. Advertisers want to sell them shit. 80's retro stations and club nights were all over as my generation moved past our initial lean years of our first jobs to our ""upgrade"" years of new cars and toys.  It's always been that way. The music industry knows it. Bands' careers will rise, fall, and make comebacks based on it.  But here's the problem-- brains get old and boring. There is nothing more pathetic than a 40-year old dude listening to 25-year old music and saying ""Duuuuh... why don't they make music like that any more?"" I say this because it describes most of the people I grew up with. And the answer is ""BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT 16 ANYMORE, YOU FAT FUCK!""   Ah, sorry for the outburst. Trying to control urge to punch my high school friends in the head.  If you want to keep your brain young and healthy for life, you must decide to move out of your comfort zone and experience new art. And music is the easiest and most powerful way to do that. It's tough to do, because 95% of any art (irrespective of the year) is cheap knock-off shit. So trying to sift down and find something that gives you chills takes a lot of listening. But when you find a new band or track, it's worth it. And if you don't do it actively, you will lose the ability to experience the joy of discovery. And you will become a boring old fuck.  So sure, I still put on INXS or Peter Gabriel sometimes. But I also put on the Silversun Pickups or Tame Impala. I go to street festivals and listen to bands that aren't on the radio yet. Most suck. But then there are a few that don't... like the time I stood on the street 20 feet in front of a new guitar/drum duo called ""The Black Keys"", and my jaw hit the pavement because I couldn't believe how good they sounded.  And my brain stays young."

Depends on my mood, and that include classical orchestral music like Vivaldi's Four Seasons, up to modern pop, rock, and rap.    Its just that I can't get away from the feeling that the 90's music is just a better time.  Most of last week I was listening to Octane and Liquid Metal stations.  Before that it was classic Hip Hop.  I got stuck on Amici Forever for a long while too.    But I always swing back around once or twice a year to 90's music and always think ""man there were very few songs I didn't love back then"" and still like it."

Thank god we aren't into the same types of guys though, although we have both hooked up with the same guy before and found out later.   I love my gay brother the same as I do my straight brothers and sisters but it is nice to have someone to relate with.

I have looked at his Grindr pro and he at mine. We attract different guys he's younger and better looking, that doesn't bother me. I am more intelligent than him so it evens out.   Just to put things in perspective at Pride I saw at least 5 guys I had hooked up with before. So the gay population is too small. My brother also ran into his ex. Every person is fair game I would say although I would never hook up with his ex cause I don't like the way he treated my brother, and my brother had strong feelings for him so I know it would upset him if I did. I don't find his ex attractive, he's not the kind of guy I go after so that's not a problem. I would be pretty upset with my brother if he hooked up with my ex not because I care about him but because he was/is an asshole and ended things badly with me.

He noticed me give him a look, and was like, ""Sorry about that, but he's just so cute."" I laughed because he obviously interpreted that look as ""Lay off my boyfriend"" when really I was amused that he was grinding on a girl.

I and a few friends even caught myself saying, ""theres a lot of gay guys"".  I guess the festival is growing and its getting a lot more attention. Regardless, Coachella is a very free spirited type of event, go with it with an open mind and meet as many people as you can.  Also, make sure you take the essentials for survival (heat, sand storms, shade, etc). You have enough time, start planning around January. Hit me up if you need advice.   P.S. Week 1 is the best, grass is so green, a lot more after parties, etc."

Everything is now in pathology, being examined.   Since everything was in the abdominal region it hurts to do anything, but smile pretty much which I've been trying to do a lot of despite the situation. I watched way too many episodes of 'Say Yes to the Dress' in my hospital room today that I started to say yes to the Dress that I was wearing, but it turns out it was just a hospital gown and I don't get to keep it, my nurse broke the news to me gently.  I had a fun time on Dilaudid, that is one heck of a drug and if you stand up too quickly while on it you'll find yourself waking up being picked off the floor by two handsome male nurses.   Also, on the plus side, I kind of have the face of a Teddy bear on my tummy thanks to my surgical inscions."

He went from asking if he could make out with other people at the bar to being extremely jealous to other people talking to me in an instant...  Next...  Then tonight a guy I went on a date with last week told me it's not going to work out because I'm too fat for him. I like people telling me it's not going to work out, but why knock me down with the fat comments? I'm not even fat  ninja edit: guy from the weekend just messaged me asking why i wasn't talking to him. told him i didn't think it would work out. ""you know i'm only looking for friends right? i thought you were different."" ""well, maybe you shouldn't have drank a handle of vodka at my house then proceed to call me a whore because i talked to a friend and that i was yours""....sometimes i wonder how fast my book on sexual encounters will sell"

A man who is considered gay fat within the community would likely be considered athletic, physically fit and in-shape within the greater cultural context.

I'm afraid if I don't start to get back to it regularly, I'm going to lose this year's 'Ass Fabulous' contest.

Unfortunately, a make up meeting hasn't happened yet- he's military so his work schedule is crazy, and on his days off, he keeps himself busy with a lot of other activities. But, we finally texted a bit more, and he suggested dinner on Monday, even though initially, he suggested drinks to keep it simple. And kind of randomly, we are also making Spotify playlists for each other so we can introduce each other to our musical tastes.  Again, he said he was looking mainly for friends, but I just don't know.... I'll proceed cautiously. :)"

My only question- are the estimated drive times based on pure Google maps or are you adding in a couple of hours?? I've done plenty of roadtrips between 4 and 15 hours, and I find that after about 4 hours, you want to add an hour or two after that to account for stops, even if quick ones for food, gas, bathroom, etc."

gaybros,3a4lwg,neofreakx2,12,Wed Jun 17 10:13:20 2015 UTC,"Haha Wolfgang. On the Netflix subreddit there was a discussion where someone complained that it was illogical that all the characters (even the german.. etc. ones) were speaking english.  Yes you can explain that with ""they all exchanged their knowledge of languages and therefore you can understand everything and it would we english to them"" (or just by ""hey we didn't think our watchers could be bothered to read subtitles"" if you ask me)...  ...BUT HOW THE HELL did they get a german actor to pronounce Wolfgang like wolf gang [Wulf gäng] without him laughing his ass off???"
gaybros,3a4lwg,BeerBeforeLiquor,6,Thu Jun 18 13:43:22 2015 UTC,I questioned that literally every time a German said his name.

I get that Will had eye contact with Whispers and that this means that Whispers can enter his mind, but what did drugging himself do? Was it just so that he was unconcscious and Whispers couldn't immediatly follow them and they got away for the moment? If so they seemed way to happy at the end...(or what am I missing?)"
gaybros,3a4lwg,IndexObject,6,Fri Jun 19 05:14:22 2015 UTC,They couldn't follow them at this moment as long as he is unconcsious. They are just happy they managed to survive this point.

gaybros,3a4lwg,ellomaethen,5,Wed Jun 17 12:31:59 2015 UTC,I am sure they would find a way to let him still play a role in the survival of the cluster. I think season 2 might be killing Whispers. There is probably more of him out there tho....

gaybros,3a4lwg,iConfessor,3,Wed Jun 17 15:25:27 2015 UTC,"I think the important thing is that Riley got them onto a boat whilst Will was unconscious, and kept him unconscious as they were departing. This means that they will probably start season 2 with them still out at sea, as the Whispers won't be able to work out where they are from just seeing the vast expanse of water surrounding them, and the Whisper guy can only visit Will, so Will will still be able to help the other sensates from the boat by visiting them, only now the whisper guy will be talking in his head, making him go a bit cray cray!

gaybros,3a4lwg,Voredoms,3,Thu Jun 18 06:00:53 2015 UTC,"I read to ""end of season"" and stopped. I have not finished it yet. But I feel like the show isn't explaining a lot because it's planning on going on for many seasons."
gaybros,3a4lwg,goodwithblahs,3,Thu Jun 18 16:33:52 2015 UTC,"Spoilers, obviously.  You're right. Will drugged himself to disallow Whispers from experiencing what he's experiencing, thus saving himself from Whispers and his henchmen. He was following Angelica's example. If you recall, in the first episode, Angelica had been drugging herself to stop Whispers from seeing her and her surroundings, and thus evading capture. It's been implied throughout the entire series that should one of them be caught, it wouldn't be long before the entire cluster is caught.  Not sure how Will can get out of this, though. Angelica offed herself to not allow Whispers to use her to get to the rest of her cluster. I doubt they'll off Will like that. Probably some deus ex machina. It is worthy to note that the creators of the show apparently have the entire series written down. About five seasons worth."

You can find the link here.  There's three components and if you do all three you get a good chunk of cash, but one of them requires you to travel to the university of Essex in the UK.

It's a side project to my PhD research and these twins pairs are quite hard to find and recruit. My supervisor has a colleague.who did a similar project and found about 4 years to get his full sample! On the one hand, he was testing their DNA to ensure they were identical and only recruiting US twins, which does slow things down a little, but on the other hand he had funding to pay them to participate, which certainly helps a lot!

gaybros,3a6lzb,priestofazathoth,3,Wed Jun 17 17:10:45 2015 UTC,"So, basically 10 chapters about how much Maurice's life sucks.  I particularly liked the consultation with Dr. Barry, because he responded in exactly the same way as my parents.  I about wanted to punch Clive throughout these chapters.  I understand he needs to put space between himself and Maurice, but he definitely seemed like he was being unnecessarily dickish at times.  And when he asked Maurice when he was getting married and then started introducing him to girls, god, what a punch to the gut.  Even today I would be offended if an ex-boyfriend did that.  Honestly, I was just depressed and angry the whole time I was reading this section, but I appreciate that that is the power of good literature.  It's proof that Forester succeeded in his goal, which was to create a moving representation of what it was like to be a gay man in the early 1900s.  And he did it well enough that lots of things are still relevant today.  I'm really hoping for a happy ending here, but who knows.  I'm interested to see what will happen with the hypnotist.    Also, I just wanted to say, as an American: this is the most aggressively British book I've ever read.  Sometimes a sentence is so full of British colloquialisms that I don't have a clue what it's supposed to be saying until I google it."
gaybros,3a6lzb,thraxicle,2,Wed Jun 17 17:11:24 2015 UTC,"The distance between Clive and Maurice heightened the experience of loneliness. With Clive he had someone to express his homosexual concerns, now there's no one. He was desperate to be able to speak to anyone including Dr. Barry. Each time he attempts to mend his loneliness by seeking someone to speak to, I have a little bit of hope for Maurice, only to be met with the repeated dead-ends and the resulting despair.   As for Clive. It's hard to read between the lines, if he's busy, or trying to put distance between him and Maurice, like someone on a new experience putting distance for fear of regression. You're starting a diet, you don't want to surround people who are eating gluttonously, for instance.   Maurice lies on a train track only to have it bisect him, without his lower half, without his penis, will he still be gay?"
gaybros,3a6lzb,narcissus_goldmund,3,Wed Jun 17 21:40:03 2015 UTC,"It was especially sad to see Maurice notice all of Clive's little slights against him: he finds out about the marriage through his mother, he is only the eighth person that Clive introduces to his wife, and Clive is not even there to greet him when he gets to the house. The way that Clive wants to 'help' Maurice is especially cruel and condescending, even if it is wholly unintentional.  I think there was some mention of genre fiction previously, so I'm going to suggest Ursula LeGuin's The Left Hand of Darkness for the next book."
gaybros,3a6lzb,thraxicle,2,Thu Jun 18 03:12:45 2015 UTC,"You definitely would expect Clive to show Maurice a bit more respect after all they've been through.  He's honestly kind of a huge hipocrite now: it's like the second he went straight, he completely lost the ability to empathize with gay men, despite living that way himself for years.  I was thinking of the Left Hand of Darkness Myself actually, I think that's a good way to get some spec fic in without sacrificing depth."
gaybros,3a6lzb,thraxicle,2,Thu Jun 18 14:07:34 2015 UTC,"His help is pretty much out of obligation:   Though the quality of the past escaped him he remembered its proportions, and acknowledged that Maurice had once lifted him out of aestheticism into the sun and wind of love. But for Maurice he would never have developed into being worthy of Anne. His friend had helped him through three barren years, and he would be ungrateful indeed if he did not help his friend. Clive did not like gratitude. He would rather have helped out of pure friendliness. But he had to use the only tool he had, and if all went well, if Maurice kept unemotional, if he remained at the end of a telephone, if he was sound as regarded Anne, if he was not bitter, or too serious or too rough — then they might be friends again, though by a different route and in a different manner. Maurice had admirable qualities — he knew this, and the time might be returning when he would feel it also.   From the same chapter. Not quite sure what is immature is the following passage    He never saw her naked, nor she him. They ignored the reproductive and the digestive functions. So there would never be any question of this episode of his immaturity."
gaybros,3a6lzb,thraxicle,2,Thu Jun 18 15:34:18 2015 UTC,"While reading these chapters, I think back on the book's opening dedication ""To a happier year"". Throughout reading the novel, I read the dedication as an ominous foreshadowing of the events that would unfold in the novel: as if the dedication meant, the world now is dark, so I think about the time when it wasn't.   Related reading: I read the Symposium, and now reading the more interesting Plutarch's ""Moralia"", it's section on Love talks about homosexuality.   For the next reading:  Yukio Mishima's ""Confession of a Mask""."
gaybros,3a6lzb,stew8,2,Wed Jun 17 22:10:36 2015 UTC,"How are the Plato texts?  I also kind of wanted to read the Symposium after Clive was talking about how it changed his life.  Unfortunately I kind of find that the 'greek love' thing isn't as idyllic as people usually make it seem: it was only okay with a really young guy, bottoming was seen as shameful, you were still expected to marry a woman later on, etc.  It's not like the greek men could get with other men and have their relationship treated as equal to their hetero counterparts.   That's a really interesting detail about the dedication that I hadn't noticed,  thanks for pointing it out.  I definitely want to read Confession of a Mask!"

When does the newsworthiness of gay accomplishments (vis-a-vis straight accomplishments) end?  ""Breaking news: first openly gay couple whose names both begin with the letter A to graduate from university on a Tuesday.""  Not important, not significant, not impactful, not news."

Sure, plenty of people have accomplished what they accomplished, but that kinda is precisely the point here. There are people who still think gay people are some sort of deviants who do nothing but dance in clubs. Showing people who look normal doing normal things help reinforce the idea that these people are normal."

gaybros,3a1qwx,jwax33,9,Tue Jun 16 19:34:50 2015 UTC,"Not sure which way you meant that question, so:  Disagreeing -- I think people are entitled to their privacy, especially concerning their sexual lives.  It is ultimately a personal decision.  Outing -- one of the primary reasons LGBT folk have become increasingly accepted in society is because straight people are getting to know us in person and realize that ""hey, my gay brother-in-law isn't this sex-crazed demon"" everyone made gays out to be, etc.  You don't get that exposure staying in the closet.  And when higher profile folks come out, especially those who are well-respected, it sends a resounding signal to the community that gay isn't deviant, if you will.  So I have a personal dichotomy there.  I want both, but obviously can't have them."
gaybros,3a1qwx,dogslikeus,5,Tue Jun 16 19:45:28 2015 UTC,"I was legitimately just curious. I disagree with the tactic entirely because it's not really anyone's business what your sexual proclivities may be.

I'm just remembering how Cloud got even more emo in Advent Children and the strange plot holes that got exposed as more and more of the Compilation came out.  That being said, you can bet I'll buy the hell out of this. For all its issues, I enjoyed Crisis Core and VII will always have a special place with me."
gaybros,3a1o4h,ridemyscooter,0,Wed Jun 17 15:19:01 2015 UTC,"I feel as if I'm the only one completely not excited for a FF7 remake and here's why:  1) voice acting, It will most likely be good, because SE is doing it, but I've noticed that there tend to be problems when you take video game characters and suddenly put voices on them and they don't sound the way that the gamers expect them to sound, Metroid: other M as a good example of when this goes wrong, which is why nintendo still hasn't done it with mario or zelda other than a phrase or a shout or something  2) game mechanics, the problem is that game mechanics have changed drastically over 20 years, or about that, since FF7 came out.  I think that if SE only updates the graphics and keeps the gameplay the same, the older gamers that played the game may like it, but any newer gamer is going to think the game is crap because the game mechanics are old and some parts can be frustrating because of the difficulty of older games  3)I feel like this not only makes Square-Enix admit that they can't make a better FF than FF7, but it also takes away from the hype of FFXV which looks really good, from what I've seen, because it seems they are doing everything very well with that game.    4) story, there are either going to be 2 problems with this, either they are going to keep the story EXACTLY the same, so you already know whats going to happen, or they are going to change the story and introduce plot arcs that weren't part of the original game and it might make the story have plot holes or other inconsistencies  So, i'm not saying that they aren't going to make a great game or at the very worst, a decent game, but there seems to be too much that they could potentially screw up, I almost feel that a sequel would have been better IMHO"

Apparently the family isn't really religious at all, and they all assumed he was gay and pretty much had no problems with it. She said his finding religion is crazy, their dad is ok with it because he was raised in a strictly Baptist house, but the girl he's dating is not very nice. I guess she's made at least two nasty comments to their mom insulting her cooking, and telling her she's not a good mother because she works as a tennis pro, and gives lessons on weekends sometimes."

Now that summer started she said their mom was thinking about banning the girl from the house when no one else was home.   Yeah I did take kind of an interest, I'm the youngest kid of five and my next brother is six years older than me, so I really grew up with the kids from my neighborhood. I wasn't super close to this family, but her best friend is/was? the identical twin of the girl who I was really close with (basically BFF) growing up, so when my neighbor/informant mentioned the name I was intrigued."

Some guys think [beards, chest hair, muscles, glasses] are attractive, so they cultivate those features in themselves in a bid to be, in their view, more attractive. They date people with the features they found attractive in the first place, and voila, you've got yourself a set of boyfriend twins.

gaybros,39zlle,jpw5x4,4,Tue Jun 16 18:29:39 2015 UTC,"No, she thinks men are narcissists. But gay guys have an easier time expressing it, since they're able to literally fuck and fall in love with men who are exactly like themselves."

gaybros,39zlle,justadude9010,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:48:01 2015 UTC,"Well, not exactly like you, but maybe similar enough that you could be related. Not everyone does it, but a strange percentage of gay couples end up that way to casual observers."
gaybros,39zlle,blue_surfboard,23,Thu Jun 18 06:36:29 2015 UTC,"It's the fetishization of similarity. The mind tricks itself into thinking someone who resembles yourself must be an extension of yourself and have the same ideas, passions, qualities, etc. This lessens a sense of isolation while giving an illusion of the enlargement of the self. It's sort of the same reason endogamy is such a thing: mating within the same tribe, clan, ethnicity, race, etc. There's some sense that what is similar to yourself in appearance or background must be more trustworthy and relatable.   (Note: there's no scientific basis to my comment to my knowledge but I'm high and it sounds plausible.)"

gaybros,39zlle,vestayekta,15,Tue Jun 16 14:42:34 2015 UTC,"In evolutionary psychology/biology, this is referred to as ""associative mating."" Although this link is to Wikipedia, I can vouch for the sources they use. Alternatively, here is this link to another source.  Basically, people often times choose a mate with a phenotype (physical manifestation of a genome) that is similar to their own. A more in depth description can be found in the links."
gaybros,39zlle,Couldnotbehelpd,2,Tue Jun 16 04:25:02 2015 UTC,"Assortative mating:       Assortative mating is a mating pattern in which individuals with similar genotypes and/ or phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under a random mating pattern. Examples of similar phenotypes include, but are not limited to, body size, skin coloration/ pigmentation, and age. Assortative mating, also referred to as positive assortative mating or homogamy, may increase genetic relatedness within the family. Assortative mating can be contrasted with disassortative mating (also known as negative assortative mating or heterogamy) in which individuals with dissimilar genotypes and/ or phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under random mating. Disassortative mating reduces the genetic similarities within the family. Positive assortative mating occurs more frequently than negative assortative mating. In both cases, due to the nonrandom mating pattern, there is a deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg Principle.

gaybros,39zlle,Grendizer7,3,Wed Jun 17 03:59:52 2015 UTC,"I dunno, but people often say that women marry men who look like their brothers. My dad looks like my maternal uncle, and one of my maternal aunts married a man who looks quite similar to my dad and my uncle too. The three of them look like they could be brothers, even though of course there's no blood relation.   I've heard that it's something to do with genetic compatibility? Not really sure. I know that part of what makes people fall for each other is genetic, involving the immune system, which should be quite different for the two people, in order to provide their offspring with a good immune system."
gaybros,39zlle,Kovoti,3,Tue Jun 16 12:41:58 2015 UTC,"I think it's partially genetic and partially social.   People tend to be attracted to those with similar genetics. The evolutionary reason being this continues the individual derivations present in your genetic code. At least that's what I remember from a biology class in college. Of course you don't want genetics too similar or you end up stacking recessive genes which leads to some serious unpleasantness.   Amazingly this Goldilocks zone of similarity/diversity seems coded into our attractions. Of course in the current world to have the greatest likely hood of healthy children you actually want to find someone super different from you but hey evolutions not perfect by a long shot.   I think the social reason is that when you share life you start getting your hair cut at the same place, trading clothes, eating the same food, shopping together, working out together, etc. Eventually you just start lining up in a bunch of ways that makes your appearance similar."

gaybros,39zlle,josiahpapaya,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:16:38 2015 UTC,If you think a certain look is attractive you're going to want to look like that and probably also date someone who looks like that. I think that's the simplest explanation.

And it's so easy to make Battlefront 3 good all you gotta do is have soldiers fighting against soldiers but already there are some things that give me pause:   Only 3 planets to play on No prequel era No space battles No single player campaign   So far they haven't added anything new they've just taken away parts of the old game.  Oh well.  20 minutes until we find out!
gaybros,39xxkc,Venerous,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:39:54 2015 UTC,"There are 4 planets, each with 3 maps. So 12 maps altogether to play at launch. And they've taken parts of the old games away because (a) it's a complete reboot, not a sequel to the older games, and (b) game development time is so much longer now and so much more detail needs to be added that content will inevitably be stripped to provide a more focused experience.  Not to mention the fact that the single player campaign in the original two Battlefront games was little more than a bit of dialogue over a typical player-versus-AI battle, sometimes with a little special objective in between."

gaybros,39upzb,shutternut94,77,Sun Jun 14 23:12:22 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to note the first Pride was a riot. The stonewall riots (primarily fought by black and brown trans women) in new York against homophobic  and transphobic police (essentially all cops, at the time, and far too many still) lasted for three nights. The next year there was a parade to commemorate it on its anniversary, that parade has since evolved into Pride.  I think it's important to know our history, especially since in many Prides gay cops and prison guards are allowed to march while our trans sisters continue to face disproportionate police violence and are often held in men's prisons and denied hormone therapy."
gaybros,39upzb,murphylawson,41,Mon Jun 15 04:00:28 2015 UTC,"Hell just reading the wikipedia article for the Stonewall riots made me change my mind about drag and transfolk.

gaybros,39upzb,a_faget,17,Mon Jun 15 05:04:56 2015 UTC,"Literally the beginning. In some indigenous American tribes, there were people known as two spirits (the terminology is seen as offensive to some and others not, but I don't see it that way). They believe they possessed both a female and male spirit and were given the choice to live as female or male (you had to choose because tribal responsibilities were often divided between genders and it was very important for their structure and survival so don't go all SJW on why there's only two choices lol). So transgendered individuals have existed for a lot of human history."
gaybros,39upzb,Kichigai,5,Mon Jun 15 06:45:14 2015 UTC,"It's not even unique to the Americas. In South Asia there's the Hijra, which, as I understand it isn't quite the same in connotation, but fits right in the non-binary gender identity spectrum."
gaybros,39upzb,autowikibot,2,Mon Jun 15 14:47:34 2015 UTC,"Hijra (South Asia):       Hijra (for translations, see  [n 1]) is a term used in South Asia – in particular, in India – to refer to an individual who is transsexual or transgender.   In other [which?] areas of India, transgender people are also known as Aravani, Aruvani or Jagappa.   In Pakistan, the hijras identify themselves as either female, male or third gender. The term more commonly advocated by social workers and transgender community members themselves is khwaaja sira (Urdu: خواجه سرا‎) and can identify the individual as a transsexual person, transgender person (khusras), cross-dresser (zenanas) or eunuch (narnbans).    Hijras have a recorded history in the Indian subcontinent from antiquity onwards as suggested by the Kama Sutra period. This history features a number of well-known roles within subcontinental cultures, part gender-liminal, part spiritual and part survival.  In South Asia, many hijras live in well-defined and organised all-hijra communities, led by a guru.   These communities have sustained themselves over generations by ""adopting"" young boys who are rejected by, or flee, their family of origin.  Many work as sex workers for survival.   The word ""hijra"" is an Urdu-Hindustani word derived from the Semitic Arabic root hjr in its sense of ""leaving one's tribe,""  and has been borrowed into Hindi. The Indian usage has traditionally been translated into English as ""eunuch"" or ""hermaphrodite,"" where ""the irregularity of the male genitalia is central to the definition.""  However, in general hijras are born with typically male physiology, only a few having been born with male intersex variations.  Some Hijras undergo an initiation rite into the hijra community called nirwaan, which refers to the removal of the penis, scrotum and testicles.   Since the late 20th century, some hijra activists and Western non-government organizations (NGOs) have lobbied for official recognition of the hijra as a kind of ""third sex"" or ""third gender,"" as neither man nor woman.  Hijras have successfully gained this recognition in Bangladesh and are eligible for priority in education.  In India, the Supreme Court in April 2014 recognised hijra and transgender people as a 'third gender' in law.     Nepal, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh have all legally recognized the existence of a third gender, including on passports and other official documents.

Or a lot of people complain that pride is too gay and that if we want to be accepted by straight people we should act more normal for them.  But that was never what pride was about.  Pride is not for straight people to judge how us LGBT are behaving like we're a dog show or something.  Pride is for other people who feel like they're completely alone and to demonstrate that yes, there are people who share the same experiences with you, and yes, you're not alone.  Pride is a message to LGBT people, not straight people.  I remember going to my first pride and mostly thinking, ""Oh wow, this is super gay"" and just being generally uncomfortable.  But people didn't care if I was dressed normally.  They didn't care if you were in drag, briefs, leather, or came directly from Old Navy.  They just cheered at you for being there.  And for a brief weekend, when there were rainbows on basically everything, I got to feel like I wasn't a minority.  I felt like part of a community and gays ruled the world.  And it was a cool feeling.  As for the people complaining about ""Where's our straight pride"" it's not like the government gave us the pride parade or something.  Pride is the culmination of efforts of the LGBT community and our allies, so we made it about the LGBT community and our allies.  If you want your own parade, make it yourself."

We want people to see us for more than just our sexuality. We want to show that we're people, not a bunch of kinky perverts.  Like in that picture, a lot of straight people think pride parades are just us celebrating all the sex we have and nothing more. Not celebrating that we're normal people, part of society, and there's nothing wrong with us, which is the message we're actually trying to fight for."

I remember how ridiculous straight people get during Mardi Gras.  In the end, humans are humans and no matter what you do people will make assumptions about you. Pride parades were a major helping factor in getting us equal rights and allowing us to be as safe and protected as we are now. I'm thankful for the impact the parades have had and look forward to the next step of people understanding that pride represents a  minority within a minority."
gaybros,39upzb,a_faget,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:01:42 2015 UTC,"I guess my problem with it, as a gay person, is that this is how most people see gay people. I don't want people to see me that way, I don't want people to make assumptions about me because of my sexuality.  Because of how all humans behave in regards to grouping stuff in their head psychologically, there is no real way around this. If you belong to a group of people who act a certain way, people will generally assume you also do the same thing.  I guess that's why I've always avoided the pride scene. I don't really want to support people behaving in a way I don't like, and then have everyone else assume I'm going to behave like that. If they're gonna do it, hey, they're totally free to! I just find it irritating.  It's not a straight-people thing either, plenty of gay people have gotten on my case for being ""straight-passing."" Like they're disappointed in me that I don't behave the way they do.  I dunno. I understand the intent and agree with it, I just don't like the side-effect it has on my life."

I've lived through this, and I think it's safe to say most subscribers on /r/gaybros have gone through this as well.  You'll have to come to terms with this on your own but know that letting go about this worry over what people think of you just because you're gay is the point of Pride.  People's preconceptions about you are their own problems, and you behave how you want to behave.  I myself find it kind of funny when people are blown away when they learn I'm gay when I mention Chris Pratt being 2qt.  I apparently throw off a lot of gaydars and you know what?  It's fine, I don't care.  It's just their world growing a little bigger.  And I hate the concept of ""straight-acting.""  I get affectionately called a straight-gay by straight friends, I get teasingly called a bad gay by gay friends.  To me, being gay has no effect on behavior besides the desire to have sex with men.  But I'm not going to worry about changing my behavior because of it.  And neither should you.  The kind of behavior at Pride is definitely not the kind of person I am, but that doesn't mean that I can't appreciate it.  Pride is fun.  It's a sorta trashy, at times embarrassing, but overall everyone there is in a super good mood because it's such a positive atmosphere of acceptance and community.  Even the Christian protestors get asked to be in photo ops.  It definitely throws you into the deep-end of flaming behavior, but once you get over your unease with that, you start to think, ""These people do not give a shit that they are twerking half-naked on a firetruck.  Why should I give a shit if I wanna hold hands with my bf in public?"""
gaybros,39upzb,Kichigai,18,Mon Jun 15 07:06:03 2015 UTC,"People are going to stereotype minority groups and think we are a certain way regardless. This is why gay vets, police officers, parents, firefighters, doctors, teachers, ect all march holding their signs. They want people to know they're just like heterosexuales. But at the same time, we're not about to whitewash the gay community. There are guys that are drag queens and gogo dancers that are going to march. Those guys are marching aside the groups I mentioned before. Some straight people are only going to notice the half naked boys and pay no mind to the service people because they'll go by the wayside. People are going to take away from these situations whatever they want. The LGBT service workers may change their mind about gay people. Or they'll choose to ignore that and only worry about the hedonism going on.  When Will and Grace was on TV, gays and straights were upset because that show made gay men look like sterile, sexless, kissless stereotypes. So they brought Queer as Folk to TV and gays and straights thought it made gays look too promiscuous and sex obsessed. You're never going to please everyone. And certain types of people (on both sides) will ALWAYS only try to find fault in something.  In the end, people at Pride parades are just doing what they do and not worrying about the rest.

You've got two more ""normal"" looking examples of gay folk. With Sol and Robert you've got your more calm, settled down, suburban, and older couple. They're not entirely asexual (as evidenced by the Cialis jokes) but the relationship is clearly portrayed as being more than just about sex. Meanwhile in Sense8 (as I understand it, I haven't had a chance to watch it) you have your younger, less inhibited examples, which fits a little more neatly into what you're seeing in media representations of straight people of the same age range in popular media.  As we hit this normalization curve there will always be something that people will be displeased with, but at least we're seeing things they can enjoy as well."

If I did, I wouldn't have done half the shit I'd done back in High School. It's more about the people I interact with daily. I don't 'act' normal, I just do whatever the fuck I feel like.

In this case, it's a thing I deal with whenever it comes up. Every single time. Ever seen Office Space?

I got stuck behind a float with a bunch of guys in thongs with cowboy hats blasting ""save a horse ride a cowboy""...  It really made me think about the way gay pride is celebrated rather than why there isn't straight pride. It was almost like the point of pride was to create ludicrously sexualized gay stereotypes of as many things as possible. I don't think there is anything wrong with dressing fancy, I'm just surprised that it's how gay people put their best foot forward on the day everybody is paying attention."
gaybros,39upzb,beatbot,30,Mon Jun 15 04:36:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's actually the point, or at least one of the ideas. It's to stick out as much as possible, despite the pressure to conform and hide in society (ex: don't ask, don't tell). The point of gay pride is to be the opposite of closeted; to be as ""out"" and proud as possible.  The thing you don't understand is that it's not about gay people putting their best foot forward. Hell, ""fancy"" is a BS way of putting it. It's about putting forward their true self, no matter how outlandish people may see it, and not ashamed about it.   For me (and others), gay pride is all about not letting the world silence your identity.   For us to have so much leeway in expressing ourselves (whether it be modest or grandiose), someone else before us had to take the first big leap-- and thankfully it was loud enough for society to hear."

gaybros,39upzb,ok2nvme,3,Mon Jun 15 06:15:23 2015 UTC,"I'm seeing the representation of gays in Pride to be a reflection of certain regions and their sensibilities than anything else.  For example: Mardi Gras in New Orleans is expected to be a night of drunken debauchery with more topless girls per square inch than you could find in a rack of porn magazines. Meanwhile up here in Minnesota (and in my experience, New Jersey as well) there's some of the ""fuck it"" attitude (specifically in diet and alcohol consumption but it's far more restrained. People tend to just celebrate with drinks and fatty food in their own homes.  Similar story with Pride. Twin Cities Pride is far more restrained and calm. With its massive corporate sponsorship (from companies like Target and Microsoft) it's polite and accessible. There's a whole section of Loring Park cordoned off as the ""family zone,"" as different areas are themed, such as the music zone, and the pet zone (which I expect is to protect people with allergies or at least to contain the poop).  The clothing is still loud, and stand-out, but you tend to see more exposed skin at the beaches in the state parks than you do at Pride. Teenagers and parents with their children are so much more common. Half the park is basically transformed into a vendor fair with wedding photographers and remodeling companies hawking their wares."
gaybros,39upzb,ObjectiveTits,5,Mon Jun 15 15:19:49 2015 UTC,"Which town was that parade in?!? I want to go to there.  The last Pride parade I saw was all parents with their kids, Fortune 500 companies, minor celebrities and elected officials. Complete dullsville."
gaybros,39upzb,somekook,3,Mon Jun 15 07:42:52 2015 UTC,"Its evolved far beyond what the it once was. In many countries like India and Singapore and Uganda it's still a very dangerous and very brave Act of self determination and protest, but in many places like the U.S. It's more of a celebration. A way for people to show support and celebrate the many victories that have allowed us to get here. People can say it's a dignified event with a lot of meaning and in many places it is, every place does pride different, but for most here it's a party and a well earned one. There's no reason to get so caught up in how classy we look or whether or not we're doing it right."

gaybros,39upzb,somekook,-14,Mon Jun 15 03:36:43 2015 UTC,"Pride parades have become embarrassing and counter-productive. I don't like them, and I don't participate in them. Some guy who was hanging out with me and a friend of mine said him and his boyfriend hooked up with a bunch of people at the Portland pride a few years ago and they didn't wear condoms. A lot of what I've ever heard and read involves stereotypes upon stereotypes, drugs, and sex. Obviously, not everybody involved in pride parades indulge in that kind of behavior, but don't even try to act like it isn't common. It is.   Not only that, but I'm not proud of my sexuality. I had no choice over this. I'd celebrate the history of LGBT people, but that's not what these events are about. It's an excuse to party just because you're attracted to the same-sex and we've been marginalized because of it. I guess I'm one of the few gay people who doesn't like this shit."

It's almost expected within the community. I don't even consider myself a part of the gay community though. I'm just gay. And it's funny, because I'm very feminine. Not effeminate in my mannerisms, but I wear makeup, have my hair long, and I just enjoy being ""girly."" I even question if I'm trans. I should looooove pride parades, apparently. But I just don't. They bother me. A lot of the LGBT scene bothers me, but now I'm beginning to rant."

Would that be an allowed religious practice?   The state doesn't have to recognize every new-found church's practices if they don't see it fit as a religion or honor some of the religion's beliefs under the state's jurisdiction. How that decision is made is beyond me, but the state doesn't serve the church. It respects it's practices. The idea behind religious freedom is that the church can't stop you from practicing, not accommodate every practice you have into their state law."

I'm not sure you can really even compare the two, but I get your point.  The idea behind religious freedom is the right for you to believe what you want without being persecuted for it. Many in this country seem to think religious freedom means ""the right to impose your beliefs on others""."
gaybros,39tfz0,throwawaysgetsadtoo,2,Mon Jun 15 18:54:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is obviously an extreme example, but it does get the point across.   If everyone understood what freedom of religion (and all our freedoms for that matter), we'd be a lot better off."

gaybros,39tfz0,DetPepperMD,2,Mon Jun 15 00:40:00 2015 UTC,"maybe.  the root of this law is the religious freedom to use drugs in services (peyote and other drugs for shamanic practices) and as long as they structure the procurement of the drug similar to that I expect it'd be fine.  That's why they can't buy or sell it, but presumably the church is allowed to grow it.  But then again I'm not a lawyer so that's all conjecture."
gaybros,39tfz0,QuestionSign,2,Sun Jun 14 23:08:36 2015 UTC,"More than just about legalization of weed in the state.  The fool governor and his cronies conveniently introduced and quickly passed RFRA just after they lost their fight against gay marriage in the state, perhaps as a revenge (slap in the face) tactic toward gay people.  Anyway;  It's going to get very interesting in that neighborhood come July 1st. I'm certain it will be crawling with local news reporters (maybe even national) and spectators waiting to see what the Indianapolis Police Department does.  I'm speculating that they may not bother anyone while in the church, so as not to look bad on the news, but instead hit them up one by one for driving under the influence of drugs and or for public intoxication if they are walking home after the service."

Me and my boyfriend went out on friday around 11 to a club and it was pretty sparsely filled. We were both pretty suprised. But the club was huge with lots of gogo dancers and themed rooms so we stayed for a while. In like an hour it was packed and the streets were clogged. It was like how you were describing. kind of weird to see pride just like happen. Didnt go out any other night because it always seemed intensely crowded.

Yesterday I watched the parade and went to a couple bars, but ended up leaving my friends bc it was boring/packed/overpriced. Randomly met a really awesome woman from Tehran and ended up walking around, people watching, and having a surprisingly deep conversation. It was my favorite thing I did all weekend."

Its smaller, so there's less of a mob feel to it but still plenty of people. The fairgrounds are downtown and there is plenty of parking and public transportation. There were plenty of bathrooms around and plenty of trashcans for the few who got too drunk. I didn't try the bar/club scene because I'm under 21 but I heard it was pretty packed."
gaybros,39v1i5,DomonuT,2,Mon Jun 15 13:20:30 2015 UTC,I agree. I went on Sunday and I was more comfortable with the Long Beach one over LA.
gaybros,39v1i5,armadillo020,2,Mon Jun 15 20:42:26 2015 UTC,"This was my first year going and I wanted to go by myself to get a good idea of what it was like. I definitely enjoyed and wish I would have stayed longer, I saw a few performances but it was honestly really cool seeing all the people there. Granted it was a lot of people but I was honestly there for the experience more so than anything else. I really want to go back next year, possibly to San Diego and San Francisco, in time."
gaybros,39v1i5,Leonine09,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:29:18 2015 UTC,In defense of my fair city. It's usually very clean. That's just the result of half a million drunk homos homoing.

gaybros,39v1i5,gojoee,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:39:40 2015 UTC,"Totally agree about the overcrowding, I'm usually ok with a crowd at music festivals, but the WEHO being extra crowded and the even worst parking situation wasn't appealing to me this year.  Next year try going to the pool parties and after parties all over Hollywood and LA.  They're actually pretty legit, with good performances."
gaybros,39v1i5,gojoee,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:47:01 2015 UTC,Won't you need to be invited for those?  I don't know anyone famous.
gaybros,39v1i5,Elranzer,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:00:20 2015 UTC,Just for the private ones. Theres a bunch of public ones thrown by different people/companies.  search fb or different event blogs before hand to get on the guestlist
