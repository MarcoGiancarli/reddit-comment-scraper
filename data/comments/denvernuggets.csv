denvernuggets,3e5aws,RiseNShine24,3,Wed Jul 22 01:52:55 2015 UTC,what a little legend. this is EXACTLY how my work mates see me when i stream games while i work.
denvernuggets,3e5aws,teensonacid,2,Wed Jul 22 02:43:08 2015 UTC,I think that's how my parents see me too
denvernuggets,3e5aws,AlienDeg,3,Wed Jul 22 03:42:08 2015 UTC,hahahahahaha thats so awesome
denvernuggets,3e5aws,rexgal,3,Wed Jul 22 06:21:47 2015 UTC,"Seriously though, pass it to MOZZY!"
denvernuggets,3e5aws,jayrod111,2,Wed Jul 22 07:19:01 2015 UTC,Hahaha what was the final score?
denvernuggets,3e5aws,pairidaeza,2,Wed Jul 22 01:59:32 2015 UTC,kawaii~
denvernuggets,3e5aws,Fooshbeard,2,Wed Jul 22 03:40:36 2015 UTC,Pretty much our season in a nutshell
denvernuggets,3e5aws,icanhazdinna,2,Wed Jul 22 04:17:17 2015 UTC,I love relatable comedy.
denvernuggets,3e3rba,Tskitishvili,10,Tue Jul 21 18:57:03 2015 UTC,"ROOOOSTER!  Thats a good chunk of change but when healthy he's our best player and most reliable scorer. Happy to lock him up for a few more years, now please please stay healthy."
denvernuggets,3e3rba,d-lo_tha_boss,9,Tue Jul 21 19:06:59 2015 UTC,"Great news! Stoked to have you with us another 3 years, Gallo!"
denvernuggets,3e3rba,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Tue Jul 21 19:08:54 2015 UTC,Amen! I just bought his jersey a few weeks ago. Glad it'll be relevant for a little while longer!
denvernuggets,3e3rba,aatencio91,5,Tue Jul 21 19:12:46 2015 UTC,"Gaaaaah I can't decide between Gallo, Wil, Barton, and Mudiay."
denvernuggets,3e3rba,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Tue Jul 21 19:15:11 2015 UTC,"I want a yellow Mudiay so bad, but they seem to only have blue right now.  I got my Gallo one on eBay for $16. You should check over there."
denvernuggets,3e3rba,aatencio91,4,Tue Jul 21 19:16:42 2015 UTC,all 3
denvernuggets,3e3rba,teensonacid,2,Tue Jul 21 19:22:38 2015 UTC,PSA: the NBA.com shop is having a sale. Gallo jersey for $40
denvernuggets,3e3rba,aatencio91,3,Tue Jul 21 19:22:15 2015 UTC,Oh shit
denvernuggets,3e3rba,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Tue Jul 21 19:23:45 2015 UTC,Is it appropriate to submit this link for this sub? Because I'm going to.
denvernuggets,3e3rba,aatencio91,3,Tue Jul 21 19:27:16 2015 UTC,Totally.

denvernuggets,3e3rba,corybyu,2,Tue Jul 21 22:15:02 2015 UTC,Such Gallo
denvernuggets,3e3rba,teensonacid,6,Tue Jul 21 23:26:08 2015 UTC,That's about half of the max over the next two seasons. Great contract for a personal favorite.
denvernuggets,3e3rba,NickCiufi,4,Tue Jul 21 19:27:40 2015 UTC,"Damn, Gallo getting paid."
denvernuggets,3e3rba,shaner307,4,Tue Jul 21 19:00:58 2015 UTC,"It's good, not great.  The final year is a player option so we really only gained a year of security and the cost of a year of player option is not insignificant. If he's playing how we expect him to play he's certainly opting out to get a better deal, and if he gets hurt again he's certainly opting in. The Nuggets really had no leverage in negotiations in this situation and it shows with the contract. The Chandler deal was much more franchise friendly."
denvernuggets,3e3rba,tron777,3,Tue Jul 21 19:46:06 2015 UTC,GALLINARI!
denvernuggets,3e3rba,The_Super_Deer,5,Tue Jul 21 20:10:22 2015 UTC,"Cautiously excited. As clear by all the comments on this thread we as a fanbase love Gallo for sure, but I think this extension is riskier than we want to believe! With that said, I'm still happy!"
denvernuggets,3e3rba,Bomber3,2,Tue Jul 21 19:16:13 2015 UTC,He deserves it him and Faried are the team leaders as of now.
denvernuggets,3e3rba,TreBoyz,12,Tue Jul 21 19:02:41 2015 UTC,"Faried  Leader   Lol yeah, no."
denvernuggets,3e3rba,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Tue Jul 21 19:08:12 2015 UTC,No...Faried is not a leader on this team.
denvernuggets,3e3rba,kunt_kicker,5,Tue Jul 21 19:09:13 2015 UTC,I think you mean him and Wilson :)
denvernuggets,3e3rba,TaylorHammond9,5,Tue Jul 21 19:10:56 2015 UTC,Love Faried but he's no leader. Ill Will and Gallo are the true OGs of the team now.
denvernuggets,3e3rba,orangesoda123,2,Tue Jul 21 19:45:21 2015 UTC,"Totally, I hope Jameer gets in on that as well!"
denvernuggets,3e3rba,corybyu,2,Tue Jul 21 22:14:14 2015 UTC,faried co-leader i agree
denvernuggets,3e3rba,skipaBturner,2,Wed Jul 22 01:02:00 2015 UTC,PAY THE MAN
denvernuggets,3e3rba,teensonacid,2,Tue Jul 21 19:07:43 2015 UTC,"Alright! Now please, stay healthy. Please please please"
denvernuggets,3e3rba,aatencio91,2,Tue Jul 21 19:09:11 2015 UTC,"Amazing deal, he has grate potential to be a all star this year."
denvernuggets,3e3rba,eg14000,2,Tue Jul 21 19:15:11 2015 UTC,"This is great news! Gallo is great for the locker room and when healthy, he has a high floor with an even higher ceiling."
denvernuggets,3e3rba,orangesoda123,2,Tue Jul 21 19:48:40 2015 UTC,"45M/3Y. Starting in next season so it's kind of 2,5M bonus and 31M for 2 years."
denvernuggets,3e3rba,AlienDeg,2,Tue Jul 21 20:03:08 2015 UTC,"yessssssss, I feel Gallo is the perfect mentor for the youngins. He just oozes leadership imo."

denvernuggets,3e3rba,phatlever,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:31:17 2015 UTC,Now just stay healthy and show em what the Italian Stallion can do!
denvernuggets,3e3rba,TheSupergrass,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:01:32 2015 UTC,YEsssssssssssssssssss
denvernuggets,3e3rba,jayrod111,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:34:49 2015 UTC,That's a lot for a guy with health issues. If can stay healthy he is worth it...but that's a large IF
denvernuggets,3e3yxk,AlienDeg,5,Tue Jul 21 19:48:36 2015 UTC,Seems like a slight overpay for a player who carries such a big injury risk. Of course I'm absolutely ecstatic though
denvernuggets,3e3yxk,chazoid,9,Tue Jul 21 20:12:07 2015 UTC,I'd rather not sign Darrell Arthur
denvernuggets,3e3yxk,rvhack,3,Tue Jul 21 22:20:31 2015 UTC,"If we can get him pretty cheap then I don't think it's a bad move but yeah, I'm not too excited about him."
denvernuggets,3e3yxk,orangesoda123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:13:20 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping we can do some kind of package deal with all of these extra players and get something out of it rather than just cutting them. Even if it's a 2020 first, just something."
denvernuggets,3e3yxk,rvhack,3,Wed Jul 22 00:20:44 2015 UTC,That's a funny way to spell Ian Clark.. who is the player we should be considering.  EDIT: Clarification because it's the morning here and my brain isn't working quite right yet
denvernuggets,3e3yxk,dot-pixis,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:56:01 2015 UTC,You're saying we should consider signing ian clark? I'd be ok with that. No need to further deepen our logjam at the 4 and 5 though.
denvernuggets,3e3yxk,rvhack,3,Wed Jul 22 01:08:17 2015 UTC,"IF HE STAYS HEALTHY, this a really good deal. I wish the 3rd year was a team option though."
denvernuggets,3e3yxk,hayclaylaybaymaysay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:44:33 2015 UTC,"Nurkic, Hickson, Dorsey, Jokic, Lauvergne, Faried, Arthur, Gallo, Chandler, Papanikolaou, Foye, Barton, Harris, N. Johnson, Mudiay, Jameer, Green.  That's 17 players with Arthur included. I just don't understand why we'd sign him at this stage. Besides the logjam in the frontcourt we just plain have too many players. I can only hope we're working on trades for the likes of Hickson, Dorsey and Foye or can cut them, because I'd rather not sign Arthur if it means having to waive Kostas P., Green, not signing Ian Clark, etc.   I understand his strengths defensively, his ability to run pick-and-pop (if his shot is falling), but I think wing and SG is an even more glaring hole. Foye wasn't cutting it last year, so I'd rather take a chance on Barton, Johnson, Harris, and Clark (and Green if paired with Mudiay), instead, and find out what those guys are worth. (Though with Johnson now I fear Green is the odd man out anyway.)"
denvernuggets,3e3yxk,utw,2,Wed Jul 22 02:15:01 2015 UTC,"because he is better then these guys and he may be treated as nice asset, especially during trade deadline for team with injured center (next deal with rockets? cavs? gsw? hawks?)"
denvernuggets,3e3yxk,phatlever,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:35:18 2015 UTC,"I think you have to choose between Clark and Green in training camp, they're too similar.  Cut Dorsey.  I bet they look at Kostas but eventually cut him, Arthur is such a better defender and Malone's all about defense."
denvernuggets,3e4u80,teensonacid,10,Tue Jul 21 23:35:55 2015 UTC,"love this quote by Ty's agent ""[The Nuggets] understood what was best for Ty,” Lawson’s agent Happy Walters told Yahoo Sports via text. “They actually care, and it’s rare for owners and GMs to put players’ well-being first.”"
denvernuggets,3e4u80,PoopLion,4,Tue Jul 21 23:40:52 2015 UTC,No the typical agent-esqe message I'm used to

denvernuggets,3e4u80,I3IO_HAZARD,7,Wed Jul 22 08:04:30 2015 UTC,Been looking forward to this after seeing Stein's tweets earlier.  Edit: Kroenke's droppin' Bombs   There were just a lot of times where you were at practice and you just know. You could smell it. You know there is probably deeper issues than he would probably let on.”
denvernuggets,3e4u80,orangesoda123,4,Tue Jul 21 23:39:31 2015 UTC,"this article has me feeling much better about our last 12 months. alot has happened, good and bad. i'm pumped for our future. a core of stable, reliable, focused vets and young talent with plenty of potential. plus some good looking draft picks! and future cap space!!"
denvernuggets,3e4u80,I3IO_HAZARD,6,Wed Jul 22 01:01:19 2015 UTC,Man I hope Ty gets his life back together in Houston
denvernuggets,3e4u80,rexgal,3,Wed Jul 22 00:37:37 2015 UTC,"I hope so too. Unfortunately, when/if that happens, we will never hear the end of it from Rocket fans. It's a small price to pay though"
denvernuggets,3e4u80,AlienDeg,2,Wed Jul 22 03:09:16 2015 UTC,"Hehe that's true, I thought about that too. Lot of Rockets fans already claiming it was the steal of the decade or something, they'll become even more unbearable.  But this issue goes beyond basketball though, DUI's are no joke, will still root for him."
denvernuggets,3e4u80,minutemandan,4,Wed Jul 22 04:02:56 2015 UTC,"great read. SO much has happened with Ty, it's refreshing to hear the front office gave him every chance while he was a Nugget, and then took his best interests to heart and moved him to a contender."
denvernuggets,3e3w25,aatencio91,6,Tue Jul 21 19:29:12 2015 UTC,"To all those with Lawson jerseys, will you keep them? Will you wear them? I'd offer to take them off your hands but I'm not really a jersey wearing type of guy."
denvernuggets,3e3w25,tron777,3,Tue Jul 21 20:13:30 2015 UTC,"I'll be wearing mine, it's my only one!"
denvernuggets,3e3w25,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Jul 21 20:22:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I like his last name and the number 3 plus its in the old navy blue and gold colorway. Probably until the Mudiay jerseys drop"
denvernuggets,3e3w25,Oshawut,3,Tue Jul 21 20:48:17 2015 UTC,I really wish we'd bring back those navy jerseys.    I'm just not a huge fan of wearing bright-ass baby blue or brighter-ass taxicab yellow.  Unless I'm going to a game it feels way too loud to casually wear.
denvernuggets,3e3w25,pizzzzzza,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:42:35 2015 UTC,I have a Lawson ABA jersey which I will probably end up selling or donating to a charity. Unless any of you guys want it?

denvernuggets,3e3w25,Natergator2015,2,Wed Jul 22 02:03:27 2015 UTC,Those Lawson jerseys on clearance right now. Good looks thanks I'm looking at that vintage English Jersey
denvernuggets,3e3w25,Oshawut,2,Tue Jul 21 20:04:10 2015 UTC,"i got Gallo blue, Faried yellow and Van Exel home retro. Time for a Chandler"

denvernuggets,3e3w25,GmanDonovan,3,Tue Jul 21 20:31:57 2015 UTC,Mudiay is wearing 0
denvernuggets,3e3w25,GmanDonovan,2,Tue Jul 21 20:41:21 2015 UTC,Awesome. I've always found that to be an interesting choice in number.

denvernuggets,3e3w25,TheoneandonlyTate,2,Tue Jul 21 20:47:44 2015 UTC,I'm waiting for the new jerseys to be released closer to the start of the season. The powder blue with gold text will look sexy af.
denvernuggets,3e2zip,Sports_Reader,11,Tue Jul 21 15:46:44 2015 UTC,"I think he will struggle, but he seems to be the type of player to use that and make himself better. Dude's going to have a ton of assists, but I also think he'll have a ton of turnovers and missed shots."
denvernuggets,3e2zip,IdRatherBeLurking,6,Tue Jul 21 15:49:37 2015 UTC,"I think he will struggle with his shot throughout the year, but I think he will be able to create off the dribble to get his scoring going. Most importantly, the court vision he showed in summer league makes me think he will be dropping some serious dimes with actual polished scorers around him. Wilson, Gallo, Nurk, Faried, etc.. all of them are going to love playing with Mudes."
denvernuggets,3e2zip,d-lo_tha_boss,3,Tue Jul 21 16:10:05 2015 UTC,"He could potentially lead all rookies in assists, I still think Okafor has ROY from what all rookies have shown in summer league. He will get a ton of playing time though so he could possibly put up ROY type numbers and will definitely be in the running for it."
denvernuggets,3e2zip,Oshawut,2,Tue Jul 21 17:14:50 2015 UTC,just put $100 on him winning RoY so I hope you're right
denvernuggets,3e2zip,The_NGUYENNER,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:41:16 2015 UTC,I wouldn't expect him to score anything more than 12 points on no better than 40% shooting and around 25% threes.  But also like 6 assists and 3-4 rebounds in 30 minutes
denvernuggets,3e2zip,followthelawson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:25:06 2015 UTC,"I think people might be expecting too much. He's already got great vision and passing ability, and he's a solid scorer inside. But he'll struggle with his shot and turning the ball over. I think Okafor wins ROY, and that's just fine. We aren't a playoff team, so just take the year to develop Mudiay with Jameer's help, and hopefully his shot improves."
denvernuggets,3e2zip,Arrow218,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:16:08 2015 UTC,"I think he and okafor will be competing for the ROY.  Both players have the keys to the offense at that position, so will be given plenty of chances. TBH it's a little hard to use summer league as any sort of judgement/measuring stick, but Mudiay seems to have the physical tools to compete this year in the nba. But he's still a rook, so 15-4-7 seems reasonable for me"
denvernuggets,3e212s,alphadog3939,7,Tue Jul 21 10:15:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. As for Ty, I actually think he's a good dude. But he's immature and is listening to the wrong people in his life I think. I hope John Lucas can help him and he's productive for you guys. Dude is a great playmaker when he's on."
denvernuggets,3dzfvr,QwertyBuffalo,9,Mon Jul 20 19:53:57 2015 UTC,"I'll work on a google-translated version.  Here's the full interview   Nba, Gallinari starts from Denver: ""We are talking about renewal""  Gallo increasingly Nugget: ""I'm fine, I'm waiting for responses from them. The team is strong, I'm happy. Lawson? We gave away an important player, I hope that someone will take his place""  Danilo Gallinari starts from Denver. Of course, the head is the national team and preparing for the European Championship, which was inaugurated with the media day. There is talk of blue, the continental competition in which shine with the head Olympics in Rio (""We have it very clear in the brain. The Olympics is a very important appointment, do not want to skip it""), but also of the NBA, as Gallo has awakened with the news that his Nuggets Ty Lawson sold to Houston. ""We gave away an important player - says the blue play with which he played since his arrival in Denver in February 2011 -. I hope that someone will take his place, although I do not know who. I have seen everything that It has happened and I am sorry, but it will be an opportunity to improve off the field. ""  DENVER FOREVER  Gallo also has been the focus of rumors in the two weeks of the crazy market NBA. ""The rumors are there and it is right that we have, but as long as you do not call your agent you feel comfortable - raises Gallinari -. In fact we are talking about renewal with Denver, and I'm waiting for responses from them. I'm very in Denver well, if you had bet on the money I made different choices already when I left the rookie contract. But I'm in Denver really well. ""  STRONG TEAM  The Gallo blesses the summer of Denver, despite the trade of Lawson: ""I saw him play Emmanuel Mudiay, I think it will become an important player already this year. The team is strong in my opinion, the important thing is not to have injuries and play from the beginning no particular obstacles. I'm happy. """

denvernuggets,3dzfvr,I3IO_HAZARD,7,Tue Jul 21 00:28:52 2015 UTC,"Luckily we can afford it now! If Gallo can stay healthy for the season (doubt it, but could happen) and Mudiay steps up, we might very well look at a 30+ winning season, even though we lost Lawson."
denvernuggets,3dzfvr,fatfro,7,Mon Jul 20 21:05:37 2015 UTC,"I think the Nuggets are officially the most underated team in the nba this year.    Here's my logic,  we are better than the Lakers, we are better than the Knicks, we are better than the Blazers, we are better than the Timberwolves, we are better than the Hornets,  we are better than the 76ers (obviously), we are better than the Suns, we are better than the Nets, we are better than the Celtics, we are better than the Bucks, we are better than the Jazz (if Nurkic develops the way I expect him to), we are better than the Mavericks, we are better than the Pistons, we are better than the Pacers, we are better than the Raptors, And we are a better franchise than the Kings,  The only real reason we sucked last year was coaching and dysfunction in the locker room (because of coaching). If that part of our team is fixed like I expected to be, this team is the most underrated team in the NBA."

Still, I see your point. Nuggets finished the season strong, and I really think that we'll be able to get a better season this time."

denvernuggets,3dzfvr,pizzzzzza,3,Tue Jul 21 01:36:51 2015 UTC,"Although he never became the leader we drafted him to be, with Ty gone it opens up the gate for Gallo to be our on court leader, which he pretty much was the second half of last season when Ty stopped giving a fuck.   Wilson is a great locker room guy, the guys seem to respect him.   I like the idea of locking up Gallo and Wilson - now our two oldest players, and leaders in different areas of the game.   It opens up our offense as well these guys, along with Joff and Jokic, can play stretch fours. Wilson cam even play the 2.   Just gotta move Hickson."

denvernuggets,3dytcw,AlienDeg,4,Mon Jul 20 22:14:06 2015 UTC,"He can, actually. He's a very crafty defender and positions himself well, but runs into the same issues every tweener has; his lack of size makes it tough for him to guard 4's and his lack of raw speed makes it tough to lockdown athletic 3's. Overall, he's a good team defender, though."
denvernuggets,3dytcw,Schlopez,3,Mon Jul 20 22:34:43 2015 UTC,Agreed with this breakdown of his defense. I think Kpap will eventually find his niche as a stretch 4 off the bench.
denvernuggets,3dytcw,KillorFireMcFail,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:07:22 2015 UTC,hypothesis: nowadays physical strength is less and less important for 4s.
denvernuggets,3dytcw,AlienDeg,2,Mon Jul 20 23:48:08 2015 UTC,"Lawson will be great for you guys, just as long as you don't ever talk about trading him or not resigning him.  Seriously though, it will be interesting to see how he adapts to playing more off the ball.  It's not his strength, but I'm sure the Rockets will figure out how to shift things around to make him effective.  Truthfully, he was not good enough to be the best player on his team in Denver and he doesn't have the mentality to be a leader, so on a team where he's the 3rd or 4th best player and there's no pressure for him to set an example, I think he may find his comfort zone.  Good luck.  I think most of us want to see him succeed."
denvernuggets,3dytcw,damb_b,2,Tue Jul 21 01:55:51 2015 UTC,Do we have the most Euro-talented roster in the league?
denvernuggets,3dytcw,TheSupergrass,2,Tue Jul 21 02:13:29 2015 UTC,Whats Ty Lawsons defense like?
denvernuggets,3dytcw,Dudedude88,3,Tue Jul 21 11:18:33 2015 UTC,"Fairly none existent. He's fast, so he can get around screens quickly or catch up to his man, but defense is not his main focus."
denvernuggets,3dytcw,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Jul 21 14:04:26 2015 UTC,I have bet with my friend (polish Zach Lowe and I'm not joking) that Harden and Lawson are going to be over DefRTG 109.

denvernuggets,3dytcw,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Tue Jul 21 19:57:01 2015 UTC,"I feel the trade was pretty even. I was surprised Morey gave up a first, I didn't expect Lawson to get that kind of return, Morey probably got a little desperate to use Prigioni's contract before he was fully guaranteed. In anything this was a win for Denver given the circumstances.  Prigioni is retiring. Dorsey sucks. The only real value is Kostas and NJ.  NJ is very athletic and already a great defender. He surprised a lot of elite PGs (Curry, Wall etc.) by blocking their shots after they thought they have him beat. If he can get his 3pt shot back (was a good 3pt shooter in college but garbage in the NBA & D-League) he will be a solid off ball guard. He also needs to work on his finish around the rim.   KPap is interesting. Not sure if he's getting cut since his contract is fully non-guaranteed. As a player he has potential but he's very overpaid. Good wing playmaker, one of the best young players in Europe before coming over, high motor, not too athletic, average defender. He couldn't adjust to the NBA 3 this year and got hurt and fell out of the rotation. He can be a solid rotational player if he learns to shoot."
denvernuggets,3dzjr6,kthxtyler,8,Mon Jul 20 20:20:43 2015 UTC,He would have been wasted in NY running the triangle. An uptempo system capitalizes on his strengths.

denvernuggets,3dzjr6,JMadFour,3,Mon Jul 20 21:59:20 2015 UTC,I don't see anyone calling Mudiay a bust
denvernuggets,3dzjr6,nyalriv580,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:52:15 2015 UTC,He means the comment section on bleacherreport.   Quite a few comments about him being a bust and other negative things about Mudiay.    For example:   Mudiay so bad he fell to the 7th pick 😂😂😂😂😂😂 bust.   .   Man I'm relieved the Knicks passed on this bust. A person with one arm tied behind his back could shoot better than him.   I for one am incredibly happy Mudiay slipped to 7 for the Nuggets.    Went into the draft hoping for Mudiay or Winslow but thinking it was likely both would be gone by 7.     Was ecstatic when both were still available!

denvernuggets,3dyfbv,Abiv23,2,Mon Jul 20 21:44:04 2015 UTC,"The next 3 years are going to be dark Nuggets fans   I highly disagree. We've got a ton to look forward to, even next season.   And this was a great day for the rebuild. We were able to wash our hands of this mess, which wasn't going to get any better. Is Ty a more valuable player than what we got for him? 100%. Could we have gotten more? Possibly. But having him around the locker room and at media day wasn't going to aid the rebuild in any shape or form.  We might not win many games, but I think there will be a lot we can enjoy about watching our now-young team grow."
denvernuggets,3dyfbv,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Mon Jul 20 22:13:00 2015 UTC,"There are variables in a rebuild and there are constants  ""Watching the young guys grow"" is a constant  ""Selling low on your best asset (boderline all-star)"" is a variable  ""Drafting the right guy"" is a variable  We need to maximize our variables in order for the nuggets to get where we'd all like them to...the 'best trade asset' variable was absolutley not maximized, I don't buy that getting rid of Lawson was an addition by subtraction move that will allow us to maximize our other players development (development being another variable)  For example, when rebuilding, the Cleveland Cavs traded Mo Williams for a pick that became Kyrie Irving...getting almost nothing for Ty was a majorly missed opportunity"
denvernuggets,3dyfbv,Abiv23,4,Mon Jul 20 22:24:00 2015 UTC,Ty was never a borderline all-star...he was just the best thing we had going
denvernuggets,3dyfbv,Samcrates,2,Tue Jul 21 00:47:10 2015 UTC,Borderline allstar translation = best guy on your team who has no business being the best guy on your team.
denvernuggets,3dyfbv,damb_b,2,Tue Jul 21 01:31:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Like Ty will kill it in Houston as the 3rd best guy on a team. He'll get hot and win a playoff game for em, assist a ton etc etc...  But as the best dude on this team? I mean homie was basically just holding back the rebuild"
denvernuggets,3dyfbv,Samcrates,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:22:52 2015 UTC,"getting almost nothing for Ty was a majorly missed opportunity   So you seriously believe it was better for us to keep him on the team until the trade deadline? Do you think that our team, our young players, and our culture would have benefited from that? Or that the harm to those three things would have been bearable? Because I simply don't.  Media day would have been 100% focused on Ty Lawson. It would have been a feeding frenzy. We know how Ty responds to that kind of attention: absolutely horribly. We know that Ty doesn't play hard when he's not bought in, what about his actions in the last 6 months make you think he'll buy in to this organization now? Because to make it worth keeping him for 6 months, we would need him to not completely shut down on the organization.   Is this the situation we want to be in? Of course not. Ty Lawson forced us into this corner. But we did what was necessary, and I think we'll benefit much more from it than you're assuming. Tim Connelly and the Culture Police are going door to door, and he's cleaning up this organization. Considering how embarrassing last season was, I'm excited that we're getting a fairly clean break and moving forward.   E: Ah, you're a Cavs fan. I guess I can't expect you to understand where I'm coming from when you didn't experience what we went through last season. If only all of our rebuilds could consist of getting the #1 pick 3 out of 4 years, then having the best basketball player in the world come back and play for us."

This is where we disagree  I highly, highly doubt the GM/Coach will make it through the rebuild and don't put much stock in their organizational philosophies (due to the nature of rebuilds sacrificing at least 1 coach/GM)...I want them to maximize assets, not on a Hinkie level, but more so than this move did  So as to not be all doom and gloom, I said before the draft and still think, Mudiay was the best case scenerio for the Nuggets at 7, I firmly believe we got a star.  This year will be all about watching our young guys and specifically with Mudiay I want to see him forcing some possessions in the post, he will overwhelm PGs with his athleticism/physicality"

denvernuggets,3dyfbv,Abiv23,2,Mon Jul 20 22:48:03 2015 UTC,"Tim Connelly has, by most Nuggets fans' account, done a very good job considering the circumstances. Have you listened to his interviews? Dude has a vision for this organization that I support.    The Cavs recent rebuild saw (not including this year) 2 coaches in 3 years and 1 GM change   And the luckiest draw of ping pong balls ever seen. That sure helps. I wouldn't use the Cavs ""rebuild"" as a indicator for where the Nuggets rebuild is going."
denvernuggets,3dyfbv,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:50:11 2015 UTC,"This is BS.  the Nuggets have been trying to trade Lawson for over a year and couldn't find a decent return.  To even get something at this point is amazing.  Ty's value around the league is so much lower than Nuggets fans like to think (even before the DUIs).  Be thankful for what we got. Be thankful for the young talent we have.  If you wanted this team to be a revolving door treadmill of mediocre players that should never be the best players on their team, then sure, dark days.  But if you actually want to see the Nuggets build something from the ground up, these next few years should be bright, because we should be moving in a positive direction."
denvernuggets,3dyfbv,damb_b,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:29:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think the next 3 years will be terrible. I think next year and the one after that should be rough. A lot of shine from our young talent(Mudiay, Nurkic, Jokic, kinda Gallo) but not a lot of winning and no chance at the playoffs. But on that third year I definitely see Mudiay taking a bug step forward and becoming the All-Star he's destined to be, alongside Nurkic and Jokic continuing to be the nasty big men we know they can be. Gallo will still be around 30 at that time and we should have enough other pieces to really start and make some noise in the West. I feel like the FO is doing this rebuild right and that our young talent is some of the best in the league."

denvernuggets,3dyfbv,tron777,4,Mon Jul 20 16:02:07 2015 UTC,"Failure? Got rid of toxic player that can't seem to find a designated driver. I can't believe we got a protected 1st rounder when he's done nothing but hurt his own value this offseason. This gives Mudiay a much longer leash, a chance to prove himself.  Now if we could just get rid of Faried and his awful contract, that'd be great."
denvernuggets,3dyfbv,volkof,9,Mon Jul 20 17:20:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if we have a capable forward to take over for Faried. I'm not saying he is a great player, but he is a capable rebounder and an offensive threat, something we need besides Mudiay. Let's face it, neither Nurkic or Lauvergne is ready to step up to take the offensive burden Faried has had to carry.  And besides, have you seen the contracts players have gotten this offseason? Everyone's overpaid."
denvernuggets,3dyfbv,fatfro,2,Mon Jul 20 21:03:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't see it as a fail at all. Got rid of our chief quitter, got another 1st round pick in the process. Got to slam the door shut on that era and give us a fresh start on a new era. We have a shit ton of future 1st round picks in our pocket and cap space now that we didn't have, which gives us all kinds of leverage. The future is brighter than it was while Ty is quitting on the coach, getting DUIs, expressing openly his desire to play elsewhere, and basically dragging the morale of the whole team down. How can you not think it's a win to get rid of a guy who will be wearing an ankle bracelet during this trade? As far as Faried goes, I'm optimistic that now that the poison is gone and there's a new kid on the block with a great attitude, Manimal will rediscover his old Team USA self."

denvernuggets,3dyjip,phatlever,7,Mon Jul 20 16:06:12 2015 UTC,"*changed Houston to A after contract non-guaranteed I guess  ""Denver Nuggets: B+  I'm guessing there's a sense of relief in the Nuggets' front office today. If Denver had it to do over again, the organization surely would have moved Lawson before last season's trade deadline, when his value was likely higher. But it would have been difficult for anyone to predict just how badly things would go for Lawson's relationship with the Nuggets over the last five months, and at this point a first-round pick of any kind in return is a solid save.  I don't think drafting Emmanuel Mudiay seventh meant Denver had to trade Lawson. Given that Lawson is going to be playing off the ball much of the time in Houston and Mudiay has the size to defend 2-guards, it's possible they could have played together at times. It's also possible Mudiay won't be ready to start this season. As exciting as his performance during the NBA summer league in Las Vegas was, Mudiay flashed more long-term potential than immediate production. He ended up shooting 2-of-14 from 3-point range and averaging five turnovers a game this summer.  Still, Mudiay's arrival meant a couple of things. First, it meant some conflict between the twin goals of rehabilitating Lawson's trade value and facilitating Mudiay's long-term development. Second, it gave the Nuggets an alternative if they were tired of worrying about Lawson off the court, an understandable position.  It's still not clear that Denver understands exactly where it's headed as an organization. The front office has sent mixed messages, stockpiling future first-round picks and young talent while maintaining a veteran core. The Nuggets extended the contract of 28-year-old forward Wilson Chandler last week and have reportedly been talking extension with Danilo Gallinari, who will turn 27 next month. Although neither player is past his prime yet, the two also aren't on the same timetable as Mudiay (19) and second-year players Gary Harris and Jusuf Nurkic, who will both turn 21 later this month.  What was clear was that Denver's future did not include Lawson. In addition to the pick, the Nuggets also got immediate and long-term cap relief. Prigioni's contract is only partially guaranteed for $290,000 through Monday, and he will be traded or waived, according to Yahoo! Sports. Denver can save another $4.8 million by waiving Papanikolaou, whose contract is non-guaranteed through October 4. The Nuggets have the option of trading him to another team looking for cap relief between now and then.  If Denver waives both players, the team will have about $8.3 million in cap space and be slightly below the league's salary floor (90 percent of the salary cap). The Nuggets might use some of that space to renegotiate Gallinari's contract at the same time they extend it, as they did with Chandler. That's a logical solution since even without Papanikolaou and Prigioni, Denver would have 14 guaranteed contracts along with guard Erick Green, whose contract is non-guaranteed through Aug. 1. So the Nuggets might not be doing any more shopping in free agency.  Pending a Gallinari extension, Denver is looking at $40 million in cap space next summer, when only Johnson will remain on the books from this trade. At this point, the Nuggets can't provide a compelling sales pitch to free agents. But if their young core shows promise this season, they might be able to successfully reinvest Lawson's salary in 2016."""
denvernuggets,3dyjip,hayclaylaybaymaysay,5,Mon Jul 20 16:06:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think Denver needs to make a pitch to a big free agent if we get the #1 pick and take Ben Simmons. Mudiay/Simmons/Nurk/Gallo/Chandler/Faried is a good squad- throw in a 2016 Free agent like D-Mo (please God), or Batum and all of a sudden we're in contention for the playoffs again. Looking at the 2016 FA list, it's Kevin Durant (no shot), Kobe (retiring), D Wade (no shot) and Joe Johnson (hell no) for the big names. After that, it's guys like Hibbert, Al Jefferson, Joakim Noah, Eric Gordon.   I think D-Mo and Batum would fit in really well in Denver, and we have the space to pay them.  I will never root for the Nuggets to suck/tank (especially with the Knicks pick swap). But losing 62 games this year wouldn't be the worst thing if it means Ben Simmons."

denvernuggets,3dw6wk,rvhack,4,Mon Jul 20 01:33:34 2015 UTC,"kostas papanikolaou is a bit of a playmaker, he drives and tends to set up his bigs.. he was injured sometime around midseason and we never saw him return to the rotation.. his shot isnt really consistent but he will shoot. hes a crafty passer and seems to be able to complete the tough passes for easy buckets.. he was a contributer when the rockets came out firing early in the season and our fanbase was extremely happy with his play. many of us wondered why he didnt find his way back into the rotation.. likely the most potential you received in this deal..  nick johnson is crazy athletic, not a great shooter, can drive and finish strong. never really played much outside of preseason and summer league. scattered minutes in garbage time..  prigioni - ummm reluctant shooter, decent ball handler with the 2nd unit. youre probably gonna cut him anyway..  joey dorsey.. ughhhh  this trade does seem really one sided, denver should have been able to get more despite ty's off court issues..i honestly was expecting any of the following terrance jones/ donatas motiejunas/ sam dekker/ clint capela.  OMG thanks for not taking capela from us.."
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,nicksnice,2,Mon Jul 20 04:15:22 2015 UTC,"He's a bit of a tweener between the 3 and the 4, but he's strong enough to hold his own at the 4. He's got a solid jumper out to the 3 point line, a good motor, and he's a solid passer, especially at driving and dishing. His main weakness is that he's a below average athlete, and is pretty flat footed on defense. Think a very poor man's Danilo Gallinari, without the finishing ability around the rim.  He probably won't be anything more than a rotation guy around the 9th or 10th man spot, but he could get a decent amount of minutes. The only problem I see is that we've already got two guys that are better at what he does in Wilson Chandler and Danilo Gallinari."
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,Bigred27,2,Mon Jul 20 02:47:10 2015 UTC,"Rockets fan here, Kpap is a really good passer, and his defense is OK, he just can't find his jumper, or layups, in the NBA. Hopefully he can do that better next season."
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,Lv1PhilD,2,Mon Jul 20 03:10:30 2015 UTC,"He's got his spots on the floor, and I think if given some minutes and consistent touches he could be a solid role player on offense who can be a good positional defender."
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,kirk5454,3,Mon Jul 20 14:01:20 2015 UTC,Yeah. Ouch.
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,Bigred27,6,Mon Jul 20 01:26:06 2015 UTC,"Welp. I guess we all knew it was coming eventually, but I guess TimCo saw an offer that he liked.  Best of luck, Ty, and no hard feelings. You made dumb mistakes off the court, but you were a hell of a player on the court and you've been one of the few bright spots in the post-GK era. Good luck on the road to recovery."
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,teensonacid,4,Mon Jul 20 01:25:18 2015 UTC,i don't know how i feel about this yet. i need time to process. opens the gate for Mudi. Jameer starts. I wish we'd been able to move Hickson in this trade.
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,TriceraScotts,4,Mon Jul 20 01:34:14 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sad right now. I know this needed to happen, but I'm going to miss watching Ty throw dimes to a bunch of guys that can't actually shoot. I hope he gets his shit together and comes out of this whole thing in a better place as a person."
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,teensonacid,3,Mon Jul 20 03:14:03 2015 UTC,interesting! Part 3: DEN now has the assets for next years draft: -Own or swap with NYK -Houston (protected) -MEM (protected 6-14) -POR (protected 1-15)
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,Tskitishvili,2,Mon Jul 20 01:43:40 2015 UTC,"So we'll probably get a top 5 pick, a pick 15-20 (Memphis) and probably a pick 25-30 Houston (I'm guessing Houston's pick is lottery protected)"
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,teensonacid,4,Mon Jul 20 01:47:31 2015 UTC,not bad really. we've had some pretty good players fall to us at late teens mid 20s
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,nugsfan5280,0,Mon Jul 20 01:53:02 2015 UTC,Why would we get a top 5 pick?  Knicks won't be as bad as last year. It'll be 10 or worse.

denvernuggets,3dw6wk,Abiv23,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:58:10 2015 UTC,Remember how bad this team was with Ty out in the begining of the season?  We will likely have that top 5 pick ourselves
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,Oshawut,3,Mon Jul 20 14:45:23 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of salty that just the other day Connelly said the team was behind Lawson while he knew this deal was in the works. Had me thinking they are keeping Ty, I would have prefered him to either be real with us or not say anything at all. Hard times for nug fans right now but hey at least season tickets will be cheap :("
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,chucho320,2,Mon Jul 20 05:35:35 2015 UTC,"You can't believe anything TC says.  He said they were firmly behind Shaw right before they gave him the ax.  They said they were going to be veeerrrrry aggressive in free agency and didn't do squat.  They said they were going to do an exhaustive search for a new head coach and barely interviewed anybody before settling on a coach with a losing record.  If Tim is moving his beady eyed lips, chances are he's lying."
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,OkAutopilot,2,Mon Jul 20 06:59:08 2015 UTC,"Sources: As part of deal for Ty Lawson, Houston will send Kostas, Pablo Prigioni, Joey Dorsey, Nick Johnson and a protected first to Denver."

denvernuggets,3dw6wk,eg14000,3,Mon Jul 20 01:21:46 2015 UTC,Someone tell me it'll all be ok. Tell me that was a low key brilliant move and I'm breathing heavily over nothing.
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,BlindManBaldwin,4,Mon Jul 20 01:36:30 2015 UTC,Lot of Connolly's trades we're low key great moves in the past.  So maybe....
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,Arrow218,2,Mon Jul 20 02:02:38 2015 UTC,WOJ BOMB  I wonder what we got?
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,runningman3,2,Mon Jul 20 01:21:44 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing we are gonna get shit, like a conditional 2nd. But please be something worthwhile. Either way though, Houston almost certainly got a steal."
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,THECHUNGAWANGA,2,Mon Jul 20 01:22:41 2015 UTC,I'm going to miss watching him play for Denver.

denvernuggets,3dw6wk,phatlever,2,Mon Jul 20 04:26:45 2015 UTC,Still do.  What would you have done differently?
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,isecretlyjudgeyou,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:21:23 2015 UTC,"Keep Ty, trade him when another team was more desperate for this fucking dumpster fire of a haul. It's like a reverse Carmelo.   There were PROBABLY talks involving Boogie and Ty in a trade. We traded a dollar for pennies."
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,phatlever,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:32:29 2015 UTC,"At some point he would have to play or at least practice and be around the team.  They couldn't reasonably do it for longer than a couple months.  Boogie and Ty? Please.  Ty's value wasn't even a high first-rounder, we tried to trade him to get into the 6-10 range and nobody was interested.  So clearly the best we were gonna do was a #11 and up pick.  Then he gets another DUI, Woj tweeted that ""few teams were interested, but now stock has cratered"".  So to get a first rounder is pretty amazing considering he wasn't even worth a top 10 before the DUI.    The best you're going to do is hold him out and then an injury to a bubble team makes them give us a #18 pick or so.  The tension and negativity would not be worth that upgrade that only occurs if there's an injury.   Houstons pick will be in the Mid 20s and with the DUIs and being a PG, that's the best we were gonna get. I never wanted them to waive him, but this is something and if it allows them to extend Gallo and develop Mudiay quicker then you have to pull the trigger."
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:08:25 2015 UTC,"I have a bad feeling about Mudiay, I dont know how old you are/how long you've been a fan - but Mudiay feels like Julius Hodge to me. They aren't similar players (Hodge could NOT shoot) but i just get a bad feeling. I hope I'm wrong. I've been an ACTIVE Nugs fan for about 30 years, and I remember the teams of the mid 80s really well, and Mudiay just gives me a bad vibe. But I thought Skita might be something, so that that for what it's worth."
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,isecretlyjudgeyou,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:22 2015 UTC,"Those teams must have fun to watch.  I came up on the early 90s so not so much.  I just don't remember Hodge ever flashing like this.  He showed he was solid, but never really did anything to make me say wow.  I am worried about that shot, no PG can avg 55% on freethrows, thatll bury him.  But I think he's immediately going to be one of the best passers in the league, as well as a near the top in turnovers, so at the very least it'll be really exciting.  When there's this much hype, there's gotta be some fire."

This is the Mudiay era now, and their direction is clear."
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,isecretlyjudgeyou,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:13:41 2015 UTC,Ty is a top 5 point guard in my opinion. Mudiay is a rookie.

denvernuggets,3dw6wk,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Mon Jul 20 14:42:33 2015 UTC,"Sure, could you say Tim failed here, maybe.  Is he regretting any trade talk prior to the draft that might have been better than this?  Yes, definitely.  i mean hindsight is a killer here.  If we traded him prior to the draft, i think we all thought maybe a top 10 pick, or probably more a top 20 pick, Tim would have gotten killed if that happened.  Imagine the backlash if he traded Ty for a #18 or #19 pick, sure we would have taken that now, but prior to DUI #2, nope, no way."
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,phatlever,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:02:13 2015 UTC,Bingo.  Connelly was fucked at every turn by Ty.
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Mon Jul 20 17:11:06 2015 UTC,"Ty forced us, don't forget that."
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,phatlever,2,Mon Jul 20 14:46:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  This was certainly better than cutting him, we get a 1st rounder and a prospect.    We all saw Woj's tweet from before, Ty's value had cratered and only a few teams were interested."
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Mon Jul 20 15:20:26 2015 UTC,"It's super frustrating, but we only got robbed if you think we could have received anything more. If you're upset with anyone, I think Ty's the one you want to be upset with.   I loved the guy here, but for all we've done for him, he royally fucked us over and over."
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,phatlever,2,Mon Jul 20 15:24:44 2015 UTC,"So true, and Ty's the one that got exactly what he wanted - to be on a contender.    He tanks his trade value and the Nuggets were left cleaning up the pieces.  Now everyone wants to blame the front office?!? C'mon people"
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Mon Jul 20 15:32:02 2015 UTC,"As much as Ty is a huge part of my identity as a Nuggets fan, I can't see myself applauding him when he returns to the Can next season. He selfishly put this team in a horrible position. I sure hope he apologizes."
denvernuggets,3dw6wk,chucho320,2,Mon Jul 20 15:39:02 2015 UTC,"I bet he looks back on this one day and regrets acting so immaturely.  But right now I think he's just bitter that they drafted Mudiay instead of Winslow and thinks it was basically their choice right then and there to show him the door.  I'll applaud him, he gave me so many fun moments as a fan but it was clearly time to move on ie Timmy Tebow.  That's life, Ty got careless and we paid the price, same but worse with David Thompson, just gotta deal with it and move forward.  Hope he gets his shit together and things work out.  Plus Jameer will give us 85% of what Ty woulda, and we got MUDIAY too"

And we did it while his trade value is the lowest it could be.  If we would have hung onto him and let Houston sweat it out, we could have gotten more than a protected pick and role players.  On the bright side, the Nuggets now have three protected 2016 first round picks in addition to their own.  2017 is going to be awesome."

denvernuggets,3dw83g,The_Super_Deer,17,Mon Jul 20 01:41:03 2015 UTC,"As a Rocket and Bronco fan, just rundown on guys. Prigioni probably retires. Dorsey is salary filler on a 1 year deal. Johnson is a 2 guard with a 1 guard body who is a plus defender, but didn't get a lot of time in Houston.   Papanikolaou is interesting. He has a fully non guaranteed contract worth 4.8m this year. He could be cut for no cost until OCT. He's a solid player who got time, but got buried late in the rotation with an injury. If the FO is willing to pay him a bit higher for 1 year then he would be a solid rotational guy who can play the 3 or the 4.   Go Broncos! Time to lock up Von next."
denvernuggets,3dw83g,bmsuperfly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:54:17 2015 UTC,Go Broncos! Time to lock up Von next.   That'll happen. Elway said he is in the long-term plans. I bet he'll get paid like Houston  and Watt because of the freed cap-space due to Peyton's retiring and likely cutting Clady.
denvernuggets,3dw83g,BlindManBaldwin,2,Mon Jul 20 13:05:08 2015 UTC,"Yup yup. I'm more worried about Danny or Marshall next offseason, but I trust Elway and we're probably cutting some of the vets to open room. Sort of the last hoorah this year."
denvernuggets,3dw83g,bmsuperfly,2,Mon Jul 20 15:24:47 2015 UTC,Marshall is an RFA so he will be back for sure for 2016

We didn't want a guy with 4 DUIs on the roster, and this trade basically allowed us to ""cut"" him in essence without taking on his contract.   We then cut everyone else except for Nick Johnson (Papa gives us immediate cap space to sign Gallo because he'd an a non-guaranteed contract, Prigs is retiring, Dorsey is on a tiny contract), and we got a 1st round pick out of the deal too. Dunno the details on it yet but... this trade is actually pretty good."

denvernuggets,3dw83g,OkAutopilot,5,Mon Jul 20 01:55:01 2015 UTC,"We just traded our best player for scraps. He mite have had a few DUI's, but talent wise he was still our best player, and we just traded him on the lowest of value he could possibly be at"
denvernuggets,3dw83g,skipaBturner,9,Mon Jul 20 01:57:42 2015 UTC,"If Ty Lawson is the best player on your team then your team needs a complete overhaul cause that's not gonna get us anywhere. I'm under the impression that Gallo is better than Ty, and I think Mudiay will end up being better than him as well.   The lowest value he could possibly be at is no value at all, or just a pick, it could be way worse. This is a good trade for us."
denvernuggets,3dw83g,OkAutopilot,2,Mon Jul 20 02:28:24 2015 UTC,"Ty Lawson was our best player last season, and the one befor. Gallo is great don't get me wrong, but he needs to have atleast one whole healthy season before we start saying he is our best player. we only needed to trade him for lockerroom issues. Its just sad we had to get rid of our best player for little in return"
denvernuggets,3dw83g,skipaBturner,3,Mon Jul 20 02:35:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, people might say Ty was our best player (Personally I agree it is probably Gallo), but he isn't a top tier PG in the league right now, great PGs are a dime a dozen, so that devalues him, even though he is a good player.   Glad we got something for him at all, and I think him moving on will be good for the team (giving us a fresh new start/attitude), and hopefully good for him (chance to start fresh) as well."
denvernuggets,3dw83g,corybyu,5,Mon Jul 20 08:49:40 2015 UTC,This was his max value by the way not the lowest.
denvernuggets,3dw83g,All_Luck,2,Mon Jul 20 03:47:19 2015 UTC,"Today yes this was his max value, but considering as Ty Lawson is a top 12 PG, borderline all star (with off court issues), this is very low value for ty"
denvernuggets,3dw83g,skipaBturner,3,Mon Jul 20 02:39:06 2015 UTC,"True, but in context point guard is a very saturated position in the NBA right now, his 4th DUI, and the off court issues he had with the Nuggets he had to go. There were talks of cutting him so I'm glad we got a return especially a 1st rounder."
denvernuggets,3dw83g,All_Luck,29,Mon Jul 20 08:51:33 2015 UTC,I literally have no idea who any of these players are.

denvernuggets,3dw83g,Arrow218,11,Mon Jul 20 01:28:57 2015 UTC,"He's retiring, Papanikolou has an unguaranteed contract. Nick Johnson has crazy athleticism and is a fantastic defender.   Dorsey is meh"
denvernuggets,3dw83g,The_New_New,9,Mon Jul 20 01:29:49 2015 UTC,"So we traded for basically just Johnson, details of the pick pending."
denvernuggets,3dw83g,Arrow218,7,Mon Jul 20 01:35:31 2015 UTC,"Albeit Johnson's explosive first step doesn't stand out for me though. I think it's because he isn't the most polished ball handler. But his athleticism is superb, and his shooting needs to improve.   In college shooting on catch and shoot options was one of his strengths."
denvernuggets,3dw83g,The_New_New,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:37:16 2015 UTC,So he can be a solid role player
denvernuggets,3dw83g,Arrow218,2,Mon Jul 20 01:39:47 2015 UTC,"Yep, I thought he could be a similar caliber player to an Avery Bradley but with more athleticism.   When we were playing the Wizards, Wall was dominating Terry. We put in Johnson, and johnson shut him down big time."

denvernuggets,3dw83g,hindu-kush,10,Mon Jul 20 02:17:14 2015 UTC,Not true.  He reminds me a lot of Dwight.  Not his play.  He literally looks a lot like Dwight...so there's that.  His play isn't very good at all.
denvernuggets,3dw83g,rabboni,3,Mon Jul 20 02:20:36 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say trash. His poor start made lots of people hate him. But he's a good defender and rebounder. His offensive game though is just ughh. If his free throw shooting wasn't so abhorrid he would be a solid role player.
denvernuggets,3dw83g,The_New_New,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:42:39 2015 UTC,"Bizzaro Dwight with even worst free throw percentage and none of the upsides, so sorry you guys had to take him."
denvernuggets,3dw83g,raikren,2,Mon Jul 20 02:21:57 2015 UTC,According to the Rockets sub the decent guys are Kostas and Nick Johnson. Dorsey sucks and Prigs is old as fuck
denvernuggets,3dw83g,Status_Flux,4,Mon Jul 20 08:37:23 2015 UTC,I loved watching Kostas when he got minutes.  The guy wants to be a player.  Same with Nick.  They may not be the most talented guys in the world but you will never doubt their heart.    Kostas has really good court vision.
denvernuggets,3dw83g,rabboni,3,Mon Jul 20 01:57:26 2015 UTC,"if prigs doesnt retire he's serviceable.  his old ass stepped up in the playoffs for us, against players twice/three times faster than him.  but its useless for denver to have him.  dorsey might be a great off the court guy when it comes to getting food, doing laundry, driving pple around.  he's strong as hell too so if any of your players live that life they got themselves a monster body guard.    the other two guys have potential."
denvernuggets,3dw83g,hnicgibbs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:44:17 2015 UTC,fyi how good kostas can be - if u guys keep kostas im gonna watch him on the waiver wire in fantasy ball next season. maybe even be my last draft pick if they put him in the rotation before the season starts. he can do a lot of things but the needs to do it at an nba level.    his first 20 or w/e games before he got injured..7/4/3 1stl/3pt.  inefficient though
denvernuggets,3dw83g,hnicgibbs,6,Mon Jul 20 07:10:18 2015 UTC,Who the fuck are these guys lmao what the hell

denvernuggets,3dw83g,teensonacid,5,Mon Jul 20 01:27:13 2015 UTC,I love Nick Johnson. if he develops his shot more and improves his handles he'll be a shutdown defender of 1s and 2s and a nice secondary ball handler   he's crazy athletic for a combo guard as well   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQKS1tNjZUY  priggy and joey are basically nothing but Kostas might fit with well with all the euros you've got
denvernuggets,3dw83g,Bentekkers22,4,Mon Jul 20 01:31:05 2015 UTC,So fucking conflicted right now :/

Check out Ben Simmons highlights if you haven't, he's a left-handed wing with point guard handles and he's 6'10"" and growing. He's a beast in transition, can pass, defend, and just needs to work on his shot. A Mudiay--Simmons-Nurkic core would be awesome."
denvernuggets,3dw83g,minutemandan,2,Mon Jul 20 14:19:06 2015 UTC,"The Nuggets can win all they want b/c they have the option to swap picks with the Knicks.  So, you cant wait for the Knicks to win like 20 games..."

Pablo will for sure be waived, and I’m very sorry about Joey Dorsey. But hey 2 young players full of potential and a first round pick is not horrible for a rebuilding team."
denvernuggets,3dw83g,TEXANinvASIANx,6,Mon Jul 20 18:08:20 2015 UTC,Agreed. This is probably the best value we were getting for Ty. At one point we were going to cut him.
denvernuggets,3dw83g,All_Luck,8,Mon Jul 20 01:42:49 2015 UTC,"I can't believe the negative responses here.  I wish Ty well but I think this is best for team chemistry,  Mudiays development, etc. Not to mention we got another 1st for 2016, and two guys that could be decent players, if not it opens a spot for Erick Green or Ian Clark to make the team maybe."
denvernuggets,3dw83g,corybyu,3,Mon Jul 20 01:59:08 2015 UTC,I'm wishing the best for all of them but I hope Nick and Kostas find a niche. I love what they bring.

denvernuggets,3dw83g,FatLever12,2,Mon Jul 20 01:46:46 2015 UTC,Yeah we definitely could have gotten more if we waited and he played well and kept his nose clean but there's no guarantee rehab will work for him and we have two PGs on the roster who deserve minutes.  Also imagine being Mudiay playing with and building chemistry on the court with another point guard who everyone knows will most likely be traded when the right offer comes along. It was time.
denvernuggets,3dw83g,KittenSquish,3,Mon Jul 20 03:56:23 2015 UTC,"Ya I knew the Nuggets weren't gonna get anything close to what the fans were wanting in return, they just wanted to get rid of him and wash their hands clean and start over."
denvernuggets,3dw83g,HakunaMatata023,3,Tue Jul 21 01:54:00 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I love Ty, I traveled like 20 hours to meet him... but I think this is the right decision for Denver.   We get cap space for Gallo (yay), a late first round pick, Mudiay will start, potential talent out of Papa and Johnson and no more of Ty's antics. Whether he was a great player or not, it was terrible PR and the Nuggets franchise will benefit  from it in the long run."
denvernuggets,3dw83g,trentyz,2,Mon Jul 20 04:04:20 2015 UTC,It breaks my heart to think that my favorite player would be so destructive to my favorite team. Nobody put us in this position but him :(

K-Pap showed some signs of becoming a decent player, really good passer and ball-handler for a SF athleticism. Shooting, and defense are all poor though. Nick Johnson has crazy athleticism and also showed potential in limited minutes but isn't a good ball-handler/distributor for a PG. Dorsey is absolute dogshit."

denvernuggets,3dw83g,AlienDeg,4,Mon Jul 20 01:53:36 2015 UTC,DEN getting a 1st of any kind for Lawson right now is actually pretty good.

denvernuggets,3dw83g,AlienDeg,4,Mon Jul 20 02:01:55 2015 UTC,What about February? For DEN to have Lawson come to training camp would have been detrimental. Cut your loss and build with your vets and young kids.
denvernuggets,3dw83g,All_Luck,2,Mon Jul 20 02:05:38 2015 UTC,Can you imagine what Media Day would have looked like?
denvernuggets,3dw83g,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:11:08 2015 UTC,"I mean trade deadline and playing with 2 PGs. Mudiay as ball handler for most of the time, Lawson as ball handler with 2nd unit and some kind of spot up shooter with Mudiay. That's how NBA looks right now. And it would be a redemption for him."
denvernuggets,3dw83g,AlienDeg,3,Mon Jul 20 14:20:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you understand. Lawson is a cancer for this team, he needed to go."
denvernuggets,3dw83g,All_Luck,4,Mon Jul 20 02:21:50 2015 UTC,"Are you sure he is? You have to ask lockeroom. I'm just not sure about. If you are right than this trade is not bad deal but if he is not we may get something better. That's my point. He didn't act like a pro, that's true I have been sick of him for long time, the thing is we are not playing for championship right now, we don't even play for PO. This half year wasn't threatened because of him. They would play 1-2 with Mudiay, we don't have any valuable starting five caliber 2guard (I hope Harris will be in next 2 years, but he has to work a lot) so waiting wouldn't be the worst solution. That's my point buddy."
denvernuggets,3dw83g,AlienDeg,8,Mon Jul 20 02:24:33 2015 UTC,"Chauncey Billups and Wilson Chandler both called him out, that is enough for me."
denvernuggets,3dw83g,corybyu,3,Mon Jul 20 02:32:28 2015 UTC,That's pretty good argument. Maybe I belive in people too much.
denvernuggets,3dw83g,AlienDeg,3,Mon Jul 20 03:54:34 2015 UTC,"When a player KNOWS he is going to get traded, that's not good for his attitude. It's not good for the team."
denvernuggets,3dw83g,OkAutopilot,7,Mon Jul 20 04:00:46 2015 UTC,"Look at the bright side people. This officially means Mudiay IS STARTING PG. We got another first round pick up. Kostas has some potential and Prigioni can help Mudiay, Nick Johnson could become a role player and if the don't produce. CUT THEM. No skin off our bones. We have a solid young team with a good coach. I doubt we are winning a championship but I finally feel we have hope again."
denvernuggets,3dw83g,Super_DariO,5,Mon Jul 20 03:02:51 2015 UTC,"We seem to be forgetting Ty could be facing league punishment as well. It may be unlikely (JR Smith only got a 7 game suspension for reckless driving that got his friend killed), but I don't think there's any other players in the league with this many DUIs. In the NFL he would definitely be facing some league punishment."

I guess he just tanked his value that bad.  Houston is going to be a nasty team.  I wonder if Lawson starts or becomes 6th man.  Beverly seems to be a better fit next to Harden."

(I'm a huge Broncos fan myself, btw, don't get me wrong).  But it is being said here like ""oh well, there goes the Nuggets, on to football now"".  This is the most excited I have been to be a Nuggets fan in a long time.  Our team has a fresh start with tons of young talent and a coach that I am definitely a fan of so far.  Of course who knows what will happen, but this could be the start of something great, instead of continued mediocrity.  I want the locker room to get a new start with a great new attitude and work ethic, and with Mudiay, Jokic, and Nurkic looking great so far, promising signs from Green, Clark, and Joffrey, and great established players in Gallo, Chandler, and Faried, I don't see what there is to be upset about.  If you want to give up on the Nuggets, go for it, but for me I'm super excited to watch Nuggets basketball, even more than I have been in recent years.  So this attitude they'll be trash is really annoying, and shows a lack of perspective."

denvernuggets,3dw83g,aatencio91,3,Mon Jul 20 02:40:52 2015 UTC,The only reason we do this garbage trade is if we couldn't tolerate Ty in the locker room. The off-court stuff we've seen is bad but by no means lethal. There has to be more there.   I would love to hear Connelly's reasoning for this trade but we're never going to get the full story from the media-savvy Connelly and we don't have any reporters covering the Nuggets with enough of either access or moxy to get the inside scoop.
denvernuggets,3dw83g,tron777,2,Mon Jul 20 03:46:41 2015 UTC,Moxy is really the issue.

denvernuggets,3dw9dz,Ediblegoldnuggets,5,Mon Jul 20 01:43:24 2015 UTC,"SF is really the only sure fire thing on our roster right now.   Mudiay will be a baller, but it might not happen this season. Nelson is, well, he is OK.   Barton has shown promise, but he isn't great by any means. Foye will give you some 3's, thats about it.   Faried could be the next player traded, unless he finds some ground to stand on with the new coaching staff. Hopefully he likes the new style of play and sticks around, because he is obviously a great player. No idea about Lauvergne.   The centers have shown promise, I think they will turn into two great euro centers.   So yeah,it's not the weakest roster in the NBA, but I don't see them above an 8th seed right now."
denvernuggets,3dw9dz,Powski89,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:15:42 2015 UTC,"I would be surprised if faried is traded.  The fact we didn't get jones or dmo, indicates Connelley has no plans of moving faired."
denvernuggets,3dw9dz,BroncoNuggets,8,Mon Jul 20 03:52:04 2015 UTC,Foye is fucking trash and is in no way a leader

denvernuggets,3dw9dz,Super_DariO,3,Mon Jul 20 08:46:30 2015 UTC,I feel a lot of different emotions right now. I'm excited and scared for this upcoming season. I'm trying to stay positive about the season and the team..but I just don't know. I bet it's 3+ years till were taken seriously again.
denvernuggets,3dw9dz,krs_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:57:48 2015 UTC,"We're not a winning team right now. Flat out. Especially in the West.  Hope for the future and a team learning how to play fun, effective basketball. Enjoy the season for what it is!"
denvernuggets,3dw9dz,amvil,2,Mon Jul 20 15:20:45 2015 UTC,We have a bright  future. I'm very excited. Ty leaving is better sweet. We got a decent trade and MUDIAY IS OFFICIALLY STARTING PG.
denvernuggets,3dw9dz,jdub1418,2,Mon Jul 20 02:16:56 2015 UTC,"Atleast you guys will go through a proper rebuild. A top 5 pick in next years drafts seems likely. You have two potential building blocks in Mudiay and Nurkic, a few young guys with potential (Harris, Jokic), and young veterans with positive trade value (Chandler, Gallo, Faried). Hopefully your GM make the right moves."
denvernuggets,3du9ha,AlienDeg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:11:49 2015 UTC,I hope Jokic and Nurkic become one of the best big man combos in the league. They both have really nice skillsets.
denvernuggets,3du9ha,Dragic-Bronson,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:08:27 2015 UTC,"Super excited to have him here. Definitely think it'll take a couple of yearsfor him to adjust, and by the sounds of it, that's the plan. Love his mid range shot and seems decently confident down low."
denvernuggets,3dsr2d,aussiehoops,2,Sun Jul 19 02:32:50 2015 UTC,"Cool stuff, thanks! I wish him the best."
denvernuggets,3dsvg4,eg14000,5,Sun Jul 19 03:20:01 2015 UTC,"Not a single Nuggets journo has mentioned anything about it...Him, Joff and Harris didn't play because they're already on the team, and the Nuggets wanted to evaluate the rest of the gusy who don't have a contract/are on the bubble."
denvernuggets,3dsvg4,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Sun Jul 19 03:49:10 2015 UTC,Where did you hear this rumor because I can't seem to find anything about it? All the articles that I just skimmed through said that he didn't play because he was getting some rest.
denvernuggets,3dsvg4,BlackCucco,-5,Sun Jul 19 03:32:22 2015 UTC,"I didn't see an article, it was more of a someone told me, that's why I didn't believe it."
denvernuggets,3dsvg4,BlackCucco,5,Sun Jul 19 03:33:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure that rumor isn't true. I wonder how something like that even starts."
denvernuggets,3dsvg4,Jeric_B,3,Sun Jul 19 03:38:46 2015 UTC,Generally players that aren't fighting for a roster spot rest a game at some point.  Jahlil Okafor did the same thing.
denvernuggets,3dsvg4,chucho320,3,Sun Jul 19 04:33:09 2015 UTC,Pretty sure he didn't play because he has already solidified a spot on the team and the rest of the players are still getting evaluated.
denvernuggets,3drb5h,gosuns33,3,Sat Jul 18 18:27:26 2015 UTC,Is there any debate about this?
denvernuggets,3drb5h,NanoNarse,3,Sun Jul 19 01:25:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there is...can he stay healthy for 1 season? I hate to be a bearer of bad news, but that dude is worth exactly half of any contract he can bring in, because he has yet to play a full season, just one. Not a lot to ask is it?  And yeah, I'm being kind of a dick, but that guy gets more excuses than any player that has ever been on the Nugs roster, ever. Paying Gallo now is like buying a farm with half the expected land and believing it'll produce twice because faith...don't like this contract until proven otherwise."
denvernuggets,3drb5h,callthetechmonkey,3,Sun Jul 19 02:55:38 2015 UTC,"but this isn't a farm, this is the NBA. people get paid on potential, look at the contract Enes Kanter just got."
denvernuggets,3drb5h,The_NGUYENNER,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:00:48 2015 UTC,"True, although Kanter averaged a double double once he was traded and has stayed healthy for the majority of his career so far.  Gallo is yet to do either.  I hope he gets the right deal and can make it work but, right now, I'm not convinced."
denvernuggets,3drb5h,Jurrahcane,0,Sun Jul 19 08:08:05 2015 UTC,"Right, and yes there were a shit ton of FA contracts that hindsight just won't bear out. I just want the nuggets to have a realistic idea about who they're signing, what kind of money, and what kind of value are they getting for a long term Gallo deal. If he plays 82 games on a 1 year deal? Great, but I doubt you'll get 82 out of him in a 3 year deal."
denvernuggets,3drb5h,callthetechmonkey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:29:25 2015 UTC,"You're being pretty blunt about it, but you've hit the nail on the head.  I think what Nug fans love about Gallo is that he does so many things well.  He is a guy who can go off and fill it up on any given night and he can do so, when fit, probably more regularly that any other guy on our roster.  What I worry about is that we will be paying very good money to Gallo and Chandler who are both, essentially, small forwards.  Neither can really play shooting guard and, while they might play ok at PF, they don't do it well enough to get extended minutes there.    I hope things play out well but I've got my reservations as well."
denvernuggets,3drb5h,Jurrahcane,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:14:51 2015 UTC,"This, this is exactly what I'm saying.  Would I want Gallo here? Yes. But not at the kind of money I expect him to get. He is an incredible shooter, but he can't stay healthy. Not saying I want him to do poorly...that's doing my team a disservice. What I want is my team to get one full season out of him before they throw the bank at him."
denvernuggets,3dp3pn,eathbau,15,Sat Jul 18 02:32:15 2015 UTC,That was so cool to see him rocking the retro Mutombo.  He looked really good in it too.  Makes me wish we bring back those unis for a game or ten.
denvernuggets,3dp3pn,chucho320,6,Sat Jul 18 03:59:48 2015 UTC,"Same here, I love those rainbow skyline jerseys. I wish they used them as an alternate"

denvernuggets,3dp3pn,orangesoda123,4,Sat Jul 18 20:56:28 2015 UTC,"Definitely, they're so unique."
denvernuggets,3dp3pn,redripz,13,Sat Jul 18 09:39:22 2015 UTC,Looks like he definitely took some notes when asking about the history of the Nuggets.
denvernuggets,3dp3pn,BlackCucco,2,Sat Jul 18 02:42:08 2015 UTC,"Motumbo seems to be proud of Mudiay. He called him ""The Son of Congo"" and he posed with him on draft night."
denvernuggets,3dp3pn,aatencio91,7,Tue Jul 21 17:38:35 2015 UTC,I know he may just be excited and I am too but this dude is becoming a fan fave in all the right ways!
denvernuggets,3dp3pn,orangesoda123,2,Sat Jul 18 03:52:35 2015 UTC,Man why can't we just go back to those jerseys...

denvernuggets,3dotpi,phatlever,3,Sat Jul 18 02:03:11 2015 UTC,Jokic is looking a lot more comfortable. Some great passing and more intensity.
denvernuggets,3dotpi,ConvertsToMetric,2,Sat Jul 18 02:58:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah loving his passing.  We are going to have some amazing ball movement with Mudiay, Jokic, Nurkic, Gallo on the floor, especially if Ty stays too!!"

denvernuggets,3dmr0w,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Fri Jul 17 15:32:34 2015 UTC,"Speaking of Pete D, I wonder if his fingerprints are on this or if Connelly had it in mind the whole time. You don't see many of these kinds of extensions in the current CBA."
denvernuggets,3dmr0w,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Fri Jul 17 15:41:38 2015 UTC,"I have to imagine he went right to work a month ago. But, the JaVale move had to have been made with something like this in mind, right?"
denvernuggets,3dmr0w,eg14000,3,Fri Jul 17 15:54:09 2015 UTC,The plan could have been a Ty trade at the draft which could have cleared more cap and put us in better position for free agency. If nothing else it gave flexibility to go a few different directions.
denvernuggets,3dmr0w,IamtheQuestionMaster,3,Fri Jul 17 15:57:52 2015 UTC,Yay! The Mcgee trade did something. If I said it once I've said it a hundred times; I love Tim Connolly. Let's extend him next.

denvernuggets,3dntps,growedup,2,Fri Jul 17 20:46:07 2015 UTC,"Nothing has been announced so far. The Nuggets aren't even commenting on it outside of ""we're aware it happened"". I'm not sure what the time-table is on this.   When he had his first DUI, the Nuggets voluntarily suspended him a game, and the NBA didn't act on it. I'm guessing they either accepted that as punishment, or are simply waiting for him to be convicted."
denvernuggets,3dntps,THECHUNGAWANGA,2,Fri Jul 17 20:49:26 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the NBA waits for the legal process to play itself out before it acts.

denvernuggets,3dkv9x,eathbau,2,Fri Jul 17 02:26:20 2015 UTC,Some things change  But others  Others stay the same
denvernuggets,3dkv9x,BlindManBaldwin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:43:52 2015 UTC,"Feels like home, doesn't it?"
denvernuggets,3dkv9x,NanoNarse,7,Sun Jul 19 01:51:22 2015 UTC,Like what I've seen from Mudiay so far...but he definitely needs to improve in certain areas. It will be interesting to watch him with other players on this team. Works on his jump shot and cuts down on the turnovers...he will have a bright future.
denvernuggets,3dkv9x,kunt_kicker,3,Fri Jul 17 02:31:08 2015 UTC,"Mudi is NBA rookie ready.  Clark looks like he could bring some contributions.  Everyone else isn't NBA ready. I was really hoping for more from Harris and Green.  Green contributed today, but is still way too inconsistent and needs to develop his all around game.  I hope Malone has a miracle or ten up his sleeve."
denvernuggets,3dkv9x,chucho320,-7,Fri Jul 17 05:48:34 2015 UTC,"Mudiay is already overrated. I view Mudiay as a project, turns over the ball too much and doesn't have a three point shot. To be honest, we would be lucky if he became better than Ty in 3 years."
denvernuggets,3dkv9x,eg14000,12,Fri Jul 17 02:31:05 2015 UTC,You can't be serious? Overrated? I will give you the turnovers and shooting. However those are things that can be improved through practice and work. I know weed is legal in Colorado but put the bong down before making irrational comments.
denvernuggets,3dkv9x,kunt_kicker,8,Fri Jul 17 02:34:46 2015 UTC,"Woh nelly. I don't think anyone is saying he's going to come out and be a top 15 PG in his first year, but the skills he already possesses are phenomenal."
denvernuggets,3dkv9x,eg14000,6,Fri Jul 17 02:36:17 2015 UTC,"I think he's overrated because we are calling him are future, and that we should build around him.  No rookie that is unproven should be called that."
denvernuggets,3dkv9x,corybyu,5,Fri Jul 17 05:12:22 2015 UTC,"He has already shown some flashes of complete brilliance, and seems to have a great work ethic and attitude.  Of course, building around a rookie might be a little bit of a stretch, but as far as we know, he is our best chance on our roster of having a future all-star type guy.  He does have a couple areas he needs to improve, of course shooting.  Also finishing around the rim, he is great at getting there, but doesn't take it up strong enough sometimes.  Today, I felt like he was really tired in the 2nd half, so getting better conditioned working out in Denver should help with some of the finishing around the rim.  But yeah, his shot and defense will take time to improve, but that is the case for most rookie point guards.  For where he is, and the amount he played last year (not a ton), he looks fantastic though."
denvernuggets,3dkv9x,eg14000,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:31:41 2015 UTC,"Nothing Mudiay does is great. The ""great"" court vision everyone raves about is hindered by a bad habit of jumping in the air before passing.  If he tries that shit in the NBA it's going to be a turnover every time.  The physical tools he has is great, but not that unique on the NBA level.  And he's not extremely explosive off the dribble.  However if he develops a solid jump shot (which I think will take him 3 to 4 years) his game will open up and the sky's the limit.  That's the defition of a project though.  Mudiay is a project.  He might never develop, like meny other 7th picks in the draft."
denvernuggets,3dkv9x,Flyingfaloopa,2,Fri Jul 17 07:11:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with a few points you've made, but your lack of ability to spell really makes it hard to take you seriously."

denvernuggets,3dkv9x,eathbau,5,Fri Jul 17 19:43:10 2015 UTC,I agree that he turned it over a lot but I reckon about half of his turnovers were from team mates being unable to catch the ball.

denvernuggets,3djorj,hayclaylaybaymaysay,5,Fri Jul 17 02:04:23 2015 UTC,oh hell yes!!
denvernuggets,3djorj,teensonacid,4,Thu Jul 16 22:47:15 2015 UTC,Per favore Connelly!
denvernuggets,3djorj,d-lo_tha_boss,4,Thu Jul 16 22:57:14 2015 UTC,How I feel about this news
denvernuggets,3djorj,NUGGman,3,Thu Jul 16 23:03:45 2015 UTC,there is a god
denvernuggets,3djorj,Arrow218,3,Thu Jul 16 20:50:13 2015 UTC,"Good to hear especially with rumors he's on the trading block had me scared a little. What is our starting line up looking like so far? PG: Lawson(maybe) SG: Foye SF: Gallo or Chandler? PF: Faried C: Nurkic or JJ? I see Chandler possibly coming off the bench as a 6th man but I would love to see both him and Gallo starting, maybe moving one over to SG?"
denvernuggets,3djorj,Oshawut,4,Thu Jul 16 21:44:07 2015 UTC,Nurkic is definitely starting at Center. I'd also like it if we somehow moved Foye or just placed Chandler at the 2.
denvernuggets,3djorj,CPage12,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:07:24 2015 UTC,"We'd see much better results starting one of Gallo or Wilson at the 4 as opposed to the 2, imo.  I'd choose Chandler, if I were in charge...I know jokes are still made about that fateful playoff game where Karl started Chandler at center, but he can cover most 4's in the league and is a fantastic rebounder."
denvernuggets,3djorj,tilla23,3,Fri Jul 17 00:41:10 2015 UTC,It would be great if they could keep Gallo off of the open market.
denvernuggets,3djorj,growedup,5,Thu Jul 16 22:28:43 2015 UTC,A Gallo/Chandler combo at the 3 is all I want great for the position and the young guys. Would love to lose J.J. Hickson and Foye if we can't trade Ty then bummer but I wouldn't mind birdman and their 2017 first would be nice.
denvernuggets,3djorj,DenverbornVikingfan,2,Thu Jul 16 21:00:08 2015 UTC,Yes please!
denvernuggets,3djorj,zenbu,2,Thu Jul 16 21:17:48 2015 UTC,good
denvernuggets,3djorj,followthelawson,2,Thu Jul 16 23:16:58 2015 UTC,It would have been nice if Dempsey had quoted a team management source as a reference vs what now just seems like speculation.

After getting pretty heated about it, I'm really ready to watch our youngsters smash on some fools.   I just can't imagine being the worst team in the league. There's no way it goes down that way."
denvernuggets,3dkbnc,Chill_Oreo,5,Fri Jul 17 00:01:06 2015 UTC,"We won't be the worst team, but we'll most likely be a bottom 4-8 team. Doesn't matter though. We're most definitely set on the future and if we do end up as the worst team, at least there's the lottery picks."

denvernuggets,3dkbnc,orangesoda123,6,Thu Jul 16 23:44:28 2015 UTC,Shocked this isn't getting preempted for a rerun of the Lakers or Sixers. I know Summer League isn't supposed to mean much but damn I get a charge watching the Young Nuggs play. MUDI

denvernuggets,3dkbnc,teensonacid,2,Fri Jul 17 01:00:40 2015 UTC,ok...well i'm back...let's do this!
denvernuggets,3dkbnc,Fooshbeard,3,Fri Jul 17 01:03:05 2015 UTC,Ian Clark is looking good. What are we going to do with all theses guards?!?

denvernuggets,3dkbnc,teensonacid,3,Fri Jul 17 02:04:27 2015 UTC,dang they're shooting the lights out
denvernuggets,3dkbnc,teensonacid,3,Fri Jul 17 02:04:36 2015 UTC,"well guess thats that but was nice to see us get some fight at the end rather than roll over, that first quarter tho"
denvernuggets,3dkbnc,teensonacid,3,Fri Jul 17 02:16:04 2015 UTC,It was fun while it lasted. Now we wait...
denvernuggets,3dkbnc,teensonacid,3,Fri Jul 17 02:18:14 2015 UTC,We win this game if we could hit free throws.  Also 24 turnovers didn't help much.
denvernuggets,3dkbnc,teensonacid,2,Fri Jul 17 02:20:54 2015 UTC,I think we win this game if Gary Harris plays and Jamaal Franklin stays in the hotel.   This was a fun Summer League though! Got me really excited for the upcoming season.
denvernuggets,3dkbnc,orangesoda123,2,Fri Jul 17 02:25:15 2015 UTC,alright let's go E-MAN
denvernuggets,3dkbnc,teensonacid,2,Fri Jul 17 00:33:14 2015 UTC,Mudi coast to coast!!!
denvernuggets,3dkbnc,teensonacid,2,Fri Jul 17 00:44:04 2015 UTC,I don't think Jamal Franklin has any intention of passing the ball guys
denvernuggets,3dkbnc,Futurebrain,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:07:57 2015 UTC,I hope he goes out and never comes back in. Hasn't made a single good play all game.

denvernuggets,3dkbnc,orangesoda123,2,Fri Jul 17 01:33:55 2015 UTC,hawks with the decent shooting...we better D the fuck up if we want to get this one

denvernuggets,3dkbnc,markymarkhamill,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:40:23 2015 UTC,Such a steal. He fools everyone with those passes (even his teammates unfortunately). I keep thinking he's getting lucky on a panic but it goes right to his man every time. With our coaching staff and starters he's going to change some games. Damn I'm in love.

denvernuggets,3dj9et,mjziegler33,6,Thu Jul 16 18:44:01 2015 UTC,I hope he learns a post-up game he is going to physically dominate smaller guards
denvernuggets,3dj9et,Abiv23,2,Thu Jul 16 19:50:36 2015 UTC,"That's a great point!  Look at how Shaun Livingston (longer I admit, but same idea) has used his post game in recent years.  With Mudiay's ability to get where ever he wants on the floor, some post moves would be a nice compliment to his other tools."
denvernuggets,3dj9et,NanoNarse,4,Thu Jul 16 19:53:13 2015 UTC,How sweet has Mudiay looked?!  I so hope teams regret passing him up (I'm looking at you Knicks and Kings)

I bet most teams that have players on the roster were more likely to mention who made the squad, rather than those who didn't.   I'm excited to see Faried tear it up, once again."

denvernuggets,3dj2ns,Atiredsprucetree,5,Thu Jul 16 21:45:03 2015 UTC,Same here. Dude goes absolutely beast mode when paired with superstars.
denvernuggets,3dj2ns,nugsfan5280,0,Thu Jul 16 21:08:08 2015 UTC,He goes beast mode when he's playing high school level talent.
denvernuggets,3dj2ns,emceeflurry,6,Sat Jul 18 23:10:27 2015 UTC,His DUI may have had an impact on this but the NBA is so stacked with PG's it makes some sense he didn't make the cut
denvernuggets,3dj2ns,NUGGman,2,Thu Jul 16 18:22:25 2015 UTC,"It's worth mentioning that he was invited in 2013, so it's fair to assume he would be invited again, if he wasn't in need of taking care of other things.   I think you might not be allowed to travel abroad as part of DUI punishment, which also might be a factor. I know I heard Canada has restrictions. I assume other countries might too."

I don't think it's fair to either point guard to keep both along with Jameer. We're clearly moving in a new direction so do Ty the favor of moving him to a team that he could make a difference on."

denvernuggets,3dgne3,NUGGman,5,Thu Jul 16 16:27:13 2015 UTC,"Ideally, we would trade him and get some sort of value.  Wish him the best, but I am really excited about the summer league attitude the team has and want that positive vibe to continue.  I think that is more important to our future than getting a 2nd round pick or role player, and would rather just move on.  Hope he works things out and keeps being a successful player though, just think it is time to part ways."
denvernuggets,3dgne3,corybyu,12,Thu Jul 16 04:06:31 2015 UTC,"Keep him, it's been said by others but waiving him we get no value and trading him we get minimal value. Ty is a capable point guard in the league and I have no doubt he could contribute if he sorted out his issues"

denvernuggets,3dgne3,zachtothejohnson,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:40:06 2015 UTC,"I love Ty Lawson, but this is no longer his team, and his issues on the court have been eclipsed by horrible distractions off the court.  He has been a good player, a good teammate, and a good Nugget - but he is no longer in the right state of mind to be any of those things.  Our organization should reward his past efforts by providing him will all the help he needs off the court, whether that be substance abuse treatment, A.A., or something similar.  In the interim, suspend him indefinitely.   If Ty wasn't locker room poison last year, he will be now.  If other teams come knocking for him, then we'll listen.  If he never shows the F.O. that he wants to be back on the floor as a Nugget, then we waive him when appropriate.  This team no longer belongs to Ty Lawson, and I don't think he really cares about that, either.  Ill Will can tell just from watching a Summer League game that Mudiay is the new face of this team, and I do not want Lawson sulking around feeling shitty about himself and his lot in life and distracting our new leader with his bullshit lifestyle.  Mudiay's head is on straight and I think he plays the game right (and for all the best reasons), so I don't think Lawson's attitude will rub off on him or anything - but I also don't see what Lawson can contribute in his current state.  tl;dr - Lawson has been a good Nugget; he deserves help with the support of the front office, but not to step back in that locker room until he has sorted his life out.  If he doesn't, cut him."

denvernuggets,3ddpxl,trentyz,13,Wed Jul 15 13:48:13 2015 UTC,"He should be suspended without pay and forced to watch basketball from the sidelines for a significant time.  Waiving him would be stupid, as would trading him with his worth so low.     Also just because he looks in control doesn't meant anything.  I think Dempsey posted the arrest documents.  Ty was still traveling at a high rate of speed according to that document.  Still putting lives in danger.  Not to mention he basically fucked himself back in Denver because of this now.  They will revisit his last DUI case because he violated his terms, and it likely won't end up good for him.  If I had a DUI, I wouldn't drink and drive no matter what, especially if I was a millionaire.    The team and the fans are sick of his shit.  He never was and never will be a leader, but he's made a handful of downright stupid mistakes this past year.  Why should I keep forgiving and forgetting? Why should we say oh he only had 3 beers and drove, that's not so bad.  If you take that without all the past fuck ups it's not so bad, but put them all together and you have painted yourself a picture of a great NBA player who no longer cares about his public image, the fans, or his team.   He missed his own camp and was out in LA drinking and driving.  Says a lot about his priories  Edit:  arrest report"
denvernuggets,3ddpxl,denverNUGGs,4,Wed Jul 15 14:56:04 2015 UTC,"Remember, buzzed driving is drunk driving."

denvernuggets,3ddpxl,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:33:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, it would be a terrible decision for the franchise to just let him go, but he obviously needs help which I hope the Nuggets are very stringent about.   That's a big issue too, it's not just the fact he was drink driving (which is bad on its own), but it's his general attitude towards basketball, the team, his image, etc. Missing the kid's camp to get a DUI is moronic in anyones book. This is not the Ty I remember. Thanks for the report too."

denvernuggets,3ddpxl,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Thu Jul 16 11:08:06 2015 UTC,"Probably my biggest issue is that he was ""banned from drinking alcohol"" as a part of his bail condition from his previous DUI. Now, I think that's a bit silly and obviously they can't police what you do at home, but should you really be going out to the clubs (let alone driving) when you're legally bound not to drink?  As with all things Ty Lawson, I think the hate is overblown. But he is responsible in every way for what's happened to him."
denvernuggets,3ddpxl,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Wed Jul 15 14:15:07 2015 UTC,"Ahh I didn't know that. Yeah in any case it's a terrible misjudgment but at the end of the day, he should be accountable for his actions.

Colorado will disallow alcohol, weed, and any other scheduled drug for the duration of your probation. With random testing each week.   I was being specific to his case, and I realize now it seemed like I was making a generalization of the probation system, which wasn't my intention.   When they originally told him, ""don't drink until your next court date"", they had no system in place to hold him to that other than him getting caught by police."
denvernuggets,3ddpxl,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Mon Jul 20 20:54:32 2015 UTC,"Whether he consumed 3 beers or was completely wasted he should know better with his prior history to be a little more responsible. Especially since he had those travel arrangements that kept him from his camp here in Denver this week. I'm not gonna bash him but he does not deserve sympathy. He brought this on himself. He needs help, but also needs to be humanized."
denvernuggets,3ddpxl,NUGGman,2,Wed Jul 15 17:35:09 2015 UTC,"That's the most important thing. Yeah, he's been an idiot and doesn't deserve sympathy - I agree 100%. However, as a franchise and fandom, he does deserve to have support so he can get the help he needs. By that, I mean not waiving him, by adding terms into his contract, ensuring he goes to rehab and is able to focus on bball. At the end of the day, he's a fantastic basketball player and I know a lot of people don't like him atm but he's still beneficial for the team.   I want to see my nuggies win! Haha"
denvernuggets,3ddpxl,NUGGman,2,Wed Jul 15 23:13:44 2015 UTC,"The fact that he was court ordered not to drink booze really negates any argument about ""how many is too many"" in this case.   I hope he's getting some counseling instead of going to rehab. It doesn't sound like he's got a specifically bad substance abuse problem."
denvernuggets,3ddpxl,Tasteofink410,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:44:23 2015 UTC,"Everybody who has ever had a DUI got that same court order and everybody I know violated it, myself included.   He'll be doing a crapload of alcohol classes, like the rest of us and will probably be required to have a breathalizer on his car for a couple years. He will probably learn his lesson one way or another."
denvernuggets,3ddpxl,NUGGman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:35:14 2015 UTC,"If I were him I probably would have missed that camp too. Inevitably it wouldn't have been very fun. A lot of, ""why does my dad say you are a bum and need to be traded?"" kind of questions. Being ""dead man walking"" is no fun and he's obviously too immature to be able to handle it very well."
denvernuggets,3ddpxl,Tasteofink410,2,Wed Jul 15 19:31:19 2015 UTC,And who's fault is that.....I disagree. If people think you're a tool in major sports. Usually showing up for charity events and doing things for kids helps your image. Not making excuses to not show up. That makes it worse. DT held his camp through all the Broncos talks so I strongly disagree. He was there also.
denvernuggets,3ddpxl,NUGGman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:36:46 2015 UTC,"No amount of charity is going to get fans off his back.  DT isn't in anywhere near the same situation as Lawson.

denvernuggets,3ddpxl,Tasteofink410,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:43:35 2015 UTC,No their situations are not the same but TY would not of gotten a DUI if he just went to his camp!!! /thread done arguing with you.

denvernuggets,3ddpxl,Tasteofink410,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:46:55 2015 UTC,"Just saying dude hear me out.....Listen..... TY was not in trouble 3 days ago. He had a childrens camp. If he would of committed to these obligations he would not of gotten in trouble most like. Can we agree with that? Before that people had issues with Ty but really only because he seemed to be trolling people with his hooka video, the Chauncey comment and asking how the Nuggets did. There's just a way to handle yourself and Ty isn't handling himself well in any aspect. With the DT reference I wasn't talking about the similarities legally. I was talking about how you handle yourself. DT could of been on social media talkin some beef with the Broncos. But instead he stayed quiet and handled himself well. Ty didn't show up to his own camp which I'm sure he makes money off of which is a scumbag move. He blamed it on travel errors or whatever. Went and partied and got a DUI. Hurting himself and the Nuggets in general. He even talked about how the fans hate him in the TMZ video because he doesn't smoke pot LOL. The dude needs some PR help cause he is doing a horrible job for his image.    EDIT: And to your Von charity thing is kind of false too. Even after his arrests he continued his Von's Vision during his legal battle. He has his own foundation. The best Ty has done for charity is doing some random bowling events occasionally. Von hurt his image with his marijuana suspension and made those cocky comments. After serving his time and making an apology statement. He has done lots of work with the community and kids and that has helped his image back to where he is gonna get that Justin Houston money now. Ty is lucky NBA is guaranteed man because the Nuggets would of just let him go after all this."
denvernuggets,3ddpxl,NUGGman,0,Wed Jul 15 20:00:53 2015 UTC,"DT has always been quiet and has kept himself out of trouble by not talking much (one reason McD was smart to draft him over Dez), like the Broncos O-line when we were winning Super Bowls. Ty was the same way until after George Karl left and Ty was encouraged to be a more vocal leader of the team. Then Ty started posting a lot more on social media and started participating on reddit.  Here's the difference between how you comment and how I comment. When I'm not sure about something, like if Von showed up to charity events immediately after his MMJ suspension, I say he probably didn't show up, letting you know I'm not positive it's true. You, on the other hand, can say that you're sure Ty makes money from charity, even though you aren't. I'm not sure that he doesn't make money from the charity, but I expect he gets to pay less taxes because of it.  Also, Ty didn't say fans hate him because he doesn't smoke pot. He did say fans hate him and thinks he smokes weed because he smokes a hooka.  Ty could have been busted for drinking even if he did the children's camp. If he's not responsible enough to stay out of trouble, then he needs to face the consequences until he learns. We could woulda/shoulda/coulda all day, but it only serves to boost our egos because we are so sure we wouldn't make mistakes if we were just given the same fortune. I prefer to be supportive and empathetic.  edit: Here's an article on athletes and charity you might want to read"
denvernuggets,3ddpxl,Abiv23,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:45:37 2015 UTC,"Ty did say in the TMZ video he thinks ppl don't like him because he doesn't smoke weed.   ""Do ppl hate on you because you don't smoke weed?"" Ty- ""I guess, I guess that's why they don't like me."" I'm sure about this one even though you. Watch the video for yourself. The dude is spiraling out of control. I don't need to think about how I post to how you post. I'm not even worried about you man. I respect your opinion but I don't have to agree with it. That's why I commented. Not to seek out a fight, that's what a forum is for sometimes. Debates. You don't need to talk about how I post to how you post man because I honestly don't care about what you think or what you say."

denvernuggets,3dcdbv,pairidaeza,16,Wed Jul 15 04:11:41 2015 UTC,"I've been saying this, Ty doesn't need us bashing him. We're being very apathetic and not caring for one of our own. He's given the Nuggets good days, let's not kick him to the curb just because things are going wrong."
denvernuggets,3dcdbv,The_Super_Deer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:25:28 2015 UTC,so true
denvernuggets,3dcdbv,skipaBturner,8,Wed Jul 15 11:05:19 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%. Judging by the comments I've been seeing on here and on /r/nba   people looking at Ty like he isn't human , like pro athletes are suppose to be perfect and don't make mistakes. This isn't nba2k this is real life and if Ty was a real life friend or fam of mine I would be looking out rather than judging him. This is his 3rd or 4th dui though not sure but you really wonder if he is repeatedly going to make the same mistakes over and over."
denvernuggets,3dcdbv,Oshawut,5,Wed Jul 15 04:19:23 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it's his third.  If a family member of friend of mine was up for their third DUI then I would get everyone close to throw their full support behind them.  Ty needs support. Not to be castigated and banished. Let the legal system deal out the punishment - as fans, we should be here to support him!"
denvernuggets,3dcdbv,DenverNick,7,Wed Jul 15 04:22:08 2015 UTC,"He actually has a fourth one as well, but it was labeled as driving after underage drinking. Sounds like a law that keeps star Tar Heels from major convictions, but that is beside the point.  http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/3400138/  Look, I'm all for Ty fixing his problem and I hope he can get his life straight. But that is NOT on the Denver Nuggets to handle. That is something that reps with the players association should reach out to him to help with. The Denver Nuggets are in business to play basketball and win. Not play babysitter to children that need to grow up. This isn't the first time, and it's not the second time. We're talking multiple offenses that will have an impact on how OUR team moves forward. We're also talking about an offense that puts people's lives in serious danger. Ever heard the old adage, sometimes you got to hit rock bottom so you can start working your way back. That is what Ty needs right now. He doesn't need to be coddled and told that everything will be alright. Of course it will, he has millions of dollars and a contract guaranteeing him millions more. It's time for the fans to let him hit rock bottom. Let him know that we aren't okay with him fucking around, getting DUIs and making stupid ass comments that are of zero benefit to the team that WE root for. I want players that want to win on our team. Not dumb asses.  Fucking participation medal bullshit. It's alright if people lose every now and then. Even rich basketball players.  And you have obviously never had to deal with family members/friends with that many DUIs. It's not the time to start supporting them. It's time to ask 'what the fuck are you doing?'.  /u/tylawson3, I've always been a fan, but you're really fucking us here. Is it really that hard to pay for someone to drive your drunk ass around? Good luck, bro, can't really condone the behavior. To think I almost sent my kid to your camp. Those kids are the ones who really got fucked."
denvernuggets,3dcdbv,DenverNick,6,Wed Jul 15 06:01:14 2015 UTC,He's got plenty of people around him who will pose the hard questions.  I respect the fact you feel angry and disappointed. He fucked up. But when the media and /r/NBA are going off on him I thought I would offer an opportunity to those of us who want to support him.
denvernuggets,3dcdbv,eathbau,3,Wed Jul 15 06:04:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not even angry or disappointed. I'm frustrated. These guys get paid millions and can't call a fucking cab, Uber, Lyft, limo, friend, hire a driver, take a bus, etc.. No he acts selfishly and gets behind the wheel of a car, putting people's lives in danger (the January one in Denver involved him going 60+ mph in a 35 mph zone at a time of night where other drunk people are likely out walking). That is just plain stupidity.  Like I said, this is a players association deal, not the Nuggets. What real purpose do they serve if not to help with these types of situations that their players get into. We need to be focused on fielding a competitive team which just was made more difficult because of Ty's actions."
denvernuggets,3dcdbv,teensonacid,3,Wed Jul 15 06:24:54 2015 UTC,Players association and the franchise should work in tandem.  Too often sports organisations walk away from their players after things like this because it suits their PR. Fuck that.
denvernuggets,3dcdbv,AntNics,6,Wed Jul 15 06:27:15 2015 UTC,Honestly my first thought after reading about the news was that I hope someone from the organization sends him help.
denvernuggets,3dcdbv,Rockinrobert29,3,Wed Jul 15 04:29:07 2015 UTC,"i've been a critic of Ty's behavior for a while now and have called for him to be traded multiple times. Now I'm not taking any of that back, but i wholeheartedly agree that now, after this dui, forcing him out of the organisation would be devastating for him. He needs help, he needs support. I've signed the petition. I support him taking control of his life and his future. Like i've said before, this is bigger than basketball. It's gone too far and has to be addressed or there could be something worse around the corner for him."
denvernuggets,3dcdbv,Status_Flux,3,Wed Jul 15 05:40:44 2015 UTC,"As a 49er fan, I can say I have had some experience with this situation with regards to Aldon Smith.   I'll be honest, this is where Goodell is superior to Silver. You knew shit was going to hit the fan for Aldon (punishment wise), we don't really have a set standard here in the NBA for things like this. If there is however a set standard that I am ignorant on my apologies and would love for someone to educate me on it.   What the Niners did with Aldon was shut him down and entered him into a rehab facility. This however was during the regular season and there was no trade rumors surrounding him. Our GM Trent Baalke made it clear that the organization was behind him and getting him better and to worry about football later.  I personally think the Nuggets will follow the same pattern with Ty for a couple reasons. 1) it helps his trade value (more so long term). 2) creates goodwill between the Nuggets and a potential suspension. If Ty is suspended for a while this obviously crushes the Nuggets chances of getting a decent haul for him. (Short term at least anyway)   Last thing I want to touch on is there is no easy way of handling it to please everyone. People are going to say to cut him and get rid of the headache, others will want for him to get help and stay. Personally I hope the Nuggets release a statement letting the people know their stance and get him into either rehab or something to help him just like the Niners did with Aldon."
denvernuggets,3dcdbv,damb_b,3,Wed Jul 15 10:44:19 2015 UTC,As much as I would like to agree with you this is a business not to baby sitter Ty has serious problems no doubt but you can only help those that want to be help. The resources are out there for Ty to get help. If you keep him around he could problems in the locker room it's time to cut ties with him
denvernuggets,3dcdbv,sborado,4,Wed Jul 15 14:16:46 2015 UTC,"I disagree. As unfortunate as his situation is, it's not the Nuggets' job to babysit him. Ultimately the Nuggets are a business first and a family second, and if he's hurting business, he needs to go."
denvernuggets,3dcdbv,sborado,3,Wed Jul 15 05:43:28 2015 UTC,"But he is, and remains, a Nuggets player.   Suspend him without pay and help him through it. Send him to rehab. He's probably looking a jail time since it's his third DUI. But he doesn't need punishment from the organisation, IMO.  Whether we like it or not, this is a defining moment for the franchise."
denvernuggets,3dcdbv,sborado,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:47:28 2015 UTC,"Everybody else in this thread is treating Lawson like an 8 year old.  He's a grown man, he knows what he's doing, and he's being immature and stupid.  It's not a mental health issue, it's a professionalism and maturity issue.  He's been acting salty since they first tried trading him last summer.  The relationship has been going sour for a while.  They drafted a PG and then signed a three year deal with another PG for crying out loud, the organization has absolutely no intention of keeping Lawson on the roster."

I feel for someone like Porzingis, when all the negativity is out of your control and nothing to do with your decisions.  And he's handling it like champ.  Screw feeling sorry for 27 yearold millionaires who don't give a shit."

denvernuggets,3d94xz,IdRatherBeLurking,22,Tue Jul 14 16:43:41 2015 UTC,What little trade value he had is now completely gone. This guy really needs to get some help.
denvernuggets,3d94xz,greysonsmith,22,Tue Jul 14 13:52:37 2015 UTC,"Man, did we make the right fucking draft pick or what"
denvernuggets,3d94xz,Fooshbeard,6,Tue Jul 14 15:48:33 2015 UTC,Luck was finally on our side.
denvernuggets,3d94xz,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Tue Jul 14 15:53:12 2015 UTC,Also resigned nelson a day before. That's some serious luck right there. I'm really hoping this does some eye opening for Ty. Sometimes you have to hit the bottom before making your way back up.
denvernuggets,3d94xz,orangesoda123,5,Tue Jul 14 16:42:29 2015 UTC,Do you guys think that the Mudiay pick has caused Lawson to go off the edge?

denvernuggets,3d94xz,skipaBturner,2,Tue Jul 14 23:15:31 2015 UTC,I'm sure the talk of possible trades didn't help any
denvernuggets,3d94xz,Fooshbeard,34,Wed Jul 15 00:04:34 2015 UTC,"This dude is basically un-tradeable at this point I'd say.  But this is bad, this is threatening his own life and others by doing shit like this, for the 3rd time!"

Basketballs just a game at the end of the day.   Fwiw when I worked as a coach at a Kenyon Martin camp years ago Ty was there and was great with the kids.
denvernuggets,3d94xz,denverNUGGs,5,Tue Jul 14 14:01:51 2015 UTC,Hastings just tweeted something about Ty missed his own camp this year
denvernuggets,3d94xz,SapoC,4,Tue Jul 14 14:03:56 2015 UTC,"I saw that. He's going through some shit, and even not handling it all that great. Makes sense to not be there. I'm sure other guest speakers would be there."
denvernuggets,3d94xz,SapoC,3,Tue Jul 14 14:06:24 2015 UTC,"I'm all for getting him help, but the dudes a millionaire and this is his 2nd DUI in the last 6 months, I'm not saying we shouldn't worry about it, but hasn't he gotten help already?"
denvernuggets,3d94xz,tomchaney479,3,Tue Jul 14 14:07:43 2015 UTC,Being young with millions of dollars doesn't immediately lead you to the proper help.  I hope the front office steps in and gets him help while suspending him from the team. Get him rehabbed as a functional human before just dumping him off without proper help.
denvernuggets,3d94xz,denverNUGGs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:58:32 2015 UTC,"Good point, and I do agree he needs help, just feel as if it should have already happened."
denvernuggets,3d94xz,aatencio91,0,Tue Jul 14 15:00:55 2015 UTC,"Assuming he has an alcohol problem (which seems obvious), it's not a matter of getting help once and the problem being fixed, nor is money a factor.  This is likely a lifelong issue that he will struggle with on a daily basis.  He probably needs counseling, treatment, daily meetings - the whole 9 yards.  Even with that, there's still a good chance that he'll slip up at some point in the future, despite all of the help.  In short, Lawson should probably avoid drinking for a loooong time, which is easier said than done."
denvernuggets,3d94xz,tron777,3,Tue Jul 14 15:47:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah he needs help.  Forget basketball, he has some issues as a human being.  It's just sad to see that he missed out on his camp for travel reasons, but is in LA endangering people's lives.  I have zero sympathy for drunk drivers."

What the hell happened to Ty.  how he went from being such a promising young player, to a this is beyond me. Has he become depressed or something? He defiantly went off the wall. He strikes me as someone who has lost his own self respect and drive to be the best he can be. There is no way we are going to be able to get decent trade value for Ty at least until the all star break (that is if he performs well)  Fuck.... just fuck"
denvernuggets,3d94xz,RiseNShine24,5,Tue Jul 14 14:33:10 2015 UTC,Just yesterday you were talking about how he had to have a better reason for blowing off the kids at his basketball camp. Now we know how he prioritizes things. The guy is child. I want him off the team ASAP.
denvernuggets,3d94xz,aatencio91,3,Tue Jul 14 16:04:54 2015 UTC,i was saying that we are not informed enough to know the real reason

DJ Williams used to be my favorite Bronco. Turns out he's a womanizer thug who had DUI problems and just wasn't someone I could respect off the field.   I hope that Ty can get his life together for his sake, and I hope that he sorts his shit out so his fans can feel alright supporting him again.   I was starting to get hopes of a Ty and Mudiay led offense and I hoped the Nuggets would keep him around and that he'd thrive, but I think now it's in the best interest of the team to unload him to avoid his negativity from affecting the younger guys on the team."

Contract question - if he keeps fucking up, will he breach his contract and give us an out?  To what point are we on the hook for his last two years?  Anyone know the details?"
denvernuggets,3d94xz,d-lo_tha_boss,2,Tue Jul 14 15:30:09 2015 UTC,"Twitter seems divided on the contract issue- it looks like there definitely is room for the Nuggets to file against him, but that might end up costing more than it's worth."
denvernuggets,3d94xz,DenverNick,4,Tue Jul 14 15:33:52 2015 UTC,"I've always defended Ty but I honestly don't know anymore. When you get paid this much, you can afford to get people to pick you up and shit. This is the first time since he was drafted that I don't know if I want him on the team anymore... and I was a diehard Ty Lawson fan"
denvernuggets,3d94xz,Cubelar,3,Tue Jul 14 21:13:05 2015 UTC,"Well he managed to make me look like an idiot for defending him in less than 24 hours. Congrats Ty, I think you've burned your last bridges with this team and this city."
denvernuggets,3d94xz,waitressinthesky,3,Tue Jul 14 15:36:35 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, curious to see how this plays out and how DUI laws in Colorado consider offenses in other states. Back in January when he had his last one, it was reported that he had admitted to having a DUI in Missouri, making the one in Denver his second, and now this one his third. He could possibly face mandatory jail time..."
denvernuggets,3d94xz,DenverNick,2,Tue Jul 14 16:23:25 2015 UTC,"Not only that, Ty is still out on bail from his 2nd offense and part of his bail agreement is to sustain from alcohol.

denvernuggets,3d94xz,eathbau,3,Tue Jul 14 13:56:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he probably is worth more then that, but I honeslty don't think he should be starting over Mudiay at this point, which is highly probable if they keep  him until the deadline, because how else would his stock increase."

Which really sucks because I loved rooting for Ty, and watching him play.  But I can't support a player who makes decisions like this, and acts the way he does.  If it seemed like he was trying to get help it would be different, but unless he changes quick I'd rather just not have him influencing the rest of the team.

denvernuggets,3d94xz,tron777,5,Tue Jul 14 14:15:40 2015 UTC,They need to suspend him from all team activities like they did with Andre miller or just cut their losses and cut him this is getting out of control
denvernuggets,3d94xz,damb_b,2,Tue Jul 14 14:31:42 2015 UTC,"Can't exactly cut a player who is owed $25 million without doing everything possible to get something out of it.  I'm wondering how his contract is set up, or if there is a standard requirement in NBA contracts that allows the team to void the remainder of the contract due to specific actions of the player."
denvernuggets,3d94xz,tron777,2,Tue Jul 14 15:40:58 2015 UTC,I'd assume it takes more than a DUI to get out of a NBA contract or I'm sure some team would have tried it by now.

OK, it's after the draft, everyone knows where they sit, what pieces they didn't pick up, did pick up, no activity.  No another DUI. Wow, i guess were running with Ty this season.

denvernuggets,3d94xz,MilchandCookies,2,Tue Jul 14 16:02:03 2015 UTC,"O course hindsight is easy to employ here. But it would help if i explained my reasoning. Ive never truly thought we would acheive championship level basketball with him. As Chauncey has said the guy isnt a professional. No doubt his stats will tell you otherwise; however, ive had friends say they always see him in denver clubs turning wayy up after playoff games. Even after losses. Shortly after hearing this he got his 1st dui. Didnt want him gone then, the breaker for me is when they express that they no longer are committed to the team. Even in form of a tweet or any social media post. It not only shows lack of commitment, but communicates a lack of maturity as a professional. You dont put your business out for the entire world to see. You do it internally. Any mature person knows that.  My original comment was regarding a trade for rondo, whom i havent watched recently, i admit so maybe hes fallen off. But i just thought we could use a pass-first style point guard. Obviously i no longer want him since we drafted mudiay."

Mudiay is not better than him, at least not yet. At this point I think we have to keep him till season starts so he can raise his trade value to what it should be. He's on a 3-year deal, anyone that gets him get the starting caliber point guard (a drunk one) for a relatively cheap contract after the cap increases. Ty is a idiot, but an idiot that can play some damn good basketball. And in this league that's all that really matters. Don't trade him until you get an offer of 3 first round picks and a prospect.

denvernuggets,3d9azw,hayclaylaybaymaysay,5,Tue Jul 14 17:17:58 2015 UTC,"Shit now I don't know if I should get a Chandler, Nurkic or Mudiay jersey."
denvernuggets,3d9azw,aatencio91,2,Tue Jul 14 15:31:21 2015 UTC,Fucking Dan Patrick and Rich Eisen have gotten into my head recently. They say that you should never wear a jersey of a guy younger than you. Mudiay is 19 and I'm 24. It seems weird that I'd buy apparel of a guy closer to my little brother's age than my own age... like I'm looking up to a guy 5 years younger than me.
denvernuggets,3d9azw,hayclaylaybaymaysay,8,Tue Jul 14 16:24:14 2015 UTC,Billups it is
denvernuggets,3d9azw,aatencio91,3,Tue Jul 14 16:31:07 2015 UTC,"I'm hesitant to buy older guys' jerseys because I only just started following the team closely, but Chauncey is a Denver legend so that makes me feel better."
denvernuggets,3d9azw,corybyu,7,Tue Jul 14 16:32:42 2015 UTC,"I like Dan Patrick and Rich Eisen, but that is just a stupid rule, and I don't care about their opinion on the matter.   I am 31 and am getting a Gallo and Mudiay jersey for sure.  If they have a problem with me enjoying my current team, they can go screw themselves haha.  I don't care about anyone else's opinion, and I support you wearing your favorite players jersey no matter what their age is.  I want our current players to get my money anyway."
denvernuggets,3d9azw,Arrow218,2,Tue Jul 14 17:14:49 2015 UTC,Glad I'm 18 then ahahaha
denvernuggets,3d9azw,aatencio91,2,Tue Jul 14 16:32:56 2015 UTC,"Generally I don't care, but now I'm getting a little bit older and I'm starting to question just how okay it is... I still think I'll grab a Mudiay jersey sometime during the season, but those darn radio guys that I love so much make me hesitate a tad."
denvernuggets,3d9azw,Arrow218,3,Tue Jul 14 16:34:47 2015 UTC,"That's how I've started to feel about following college recruiting.. I'm reading interviews and articles about guys younger than me now. But honestly who cares about the age thing with jerseys man? By DP's logic no middle aged person is allowed to wear a jersey of a recent player, that's just dumb."
denvernuggets,3d9azw,aatencio91,2,Tue Jul 14 16:36:47 2015 UTC,"I think my philosophy on it is that I can no longer wear jerseys just whenever. As a massive Broncos fan, I wear a Broncos jersey to work every Friday during the football season and then my special Von Miller one during each game. With a Nuggets jersey, I'd wear one while watching or certainly when going to a game, but not just as a ""heading to the mall"" shirt."
denvernuggets,3d9azw,Arrow218,2,Tue Jul 14 16:40:20 2015 UTC,"Basketball jerseys are hard with that, being sleeveless and all."
denvernuggets,3d9azw,aatencio91,3,Tue Jul 14 16:49:49 2015 UTC,I have an unsightly farmer's tan and noodle arms so I go for the t-shirt under the jersey.
denvernuggets,3d9azw,eathbau,2,Tue Jul 14 16:51:22 2015 UTC,I'm holding back on Mudiay because at some point j think  he'll change to number 7.
denvernuggets,3d9azw,aatencio91,2,Tue Jul 14 16:31:06 2015 UTC,I love number 0 so I'm praying that I can get a yellow Mudiay jersey sometime.

denvernuggets,3d9azw,phatlever,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:32:13 2015 UTC,"First Chauncey, now Will.  Ty must not be that well liked in the locker room."
denvernuggets,3daiut,aatencio91,11,Tue Jul 14 19:45:05 2015 UTC,"I think the best thing right now would be to just suspend him like we did with Andre Miller.  We can't trade him right now because his stock is soooo low.  Plus he really doesn't deserve to be rewarded by going to a potential winning team.  He should have to sit out and watch.  If he has half a basketball heart, then not playing would be the biggest punishment for him.  And it would be a huge test to see if he's capable of avoiding doing more dumb shit.  We have Jameer and Mudiay now, and if need be, Foye, so we're not desperate at the PG position.  Wait until teams are dying for someone with Ty's potential and nail them.  Gotta get what we can for him, and right now, it's not going to be very much.  But time will change that.  I sincerely hope he's played his last game in a Nuggets uniform though."
denvernuggets,3daiut,chucho320,8,Tue Jul 14 21:01:21 2015 UTC,"This!  Might as well tell him to watch games on his couch.  His value can't go any lower at this point so might as well hang on and hope a team needs by the trade deadline.  Look at Mozgov, we never could have gotten those picks during the offseason, but teams get more desperate as the season goes on.  We have literally no reason to give him awaay right now."
denvernuggets,3daiut,phatlever,4,Tue Jul 14 21:26:30 2015 UTC,"Gotta think Green makes the team too, so PG is fine."
denvernuggets,3daiut,TrapQuavo,5,Tue Jul 14 21:10:04 2015 UTC,"So I argue with my friends that Ty isn't a starting caliber PG on a championship squad. He's just not, for a variety of reasons (size, leadership, defensive capabilities, regression of shooting %, w/e.) But he would be a fantastic PG for the second unit.  In my perfect scenario, Lawson gets himself right and apologizes to everyone. First, through his words then his actions. Giving it all in practice, showing the young players the ropes, knowing that he's on the bottom of the totem. He becomes a good vet and teammate, fully aware that these shenanigans have destroyed his value and he'll probably never command a large salary ever again. At least on a contender anyways. Ty accepts his role as the best 2nd unit leader in the league, wins 6moy two seasons removed from this summer, and the Denver Nuggets are perennial contenders in the West."
denvernuggets,3daiut,ADinHD,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:48:54 2015 UTC,"Hate to shoot you down. This is a dream scenario, and given Ty's past, him accepting a role as a 2nd guard is pretty tough to see.  Dude would need a grade A epiphany or something.  But I do agree with you in terms of not being a championship starting point, unless the 2 is a George hill (defensive) type. Offensively he's one of the best playmakers, let's not forget that.  Suspend him, until he gets his shit together, or injuries pile up for a team at G. Then trade him for a 1st or something.  NOTE. it's probably not a bad thing to have mudiay competing for minutes/ the starting job. Competition is never a bad thing, as long as he's not lost in the shuffle (zach harper said this like 800 times)"
denvernuggets,3daiut,Ediblegoldnuggets,2,Wed Jul 15 02:19:02 2015 UTC,"I think everyone kinda showing support and the city of Denver not turning on him anymore would aid in his epiphany. Like when you do something that you know your father wouldn't be a fan of. Not mad, just disappointed. I still love me some Ty, man.  That being said, I'm all for the guy taking a step away from basketball for a few months. Come work out at the facility, come lay low in Denver, sit courtside or up in the box, and support your teammates, show us something, show us that you care and we as fans will do the same. Have a little humble pie and some water. I think showing the young guys that you can grow as a person and the vets that you can sit our and accept a ""lesser"" role down the line with a team that was considered yours would be invaluable for our franchise. Way better than waiving him or dumping his salary. In a sport where things can change so quickly, I think it would speak volumes about Ty, the Nuggets, and the city of Denver."
denvernuggets,3daiut,ADinHD,3,Wed Jul 15 15:07:08 2015 UTC,Get rid of him at all costs. He's a 28 year old (by seasons start) man who can't get it together for the sake of his career.   4 DUIs (probably 25+ instances he wasn't stopped)  Late back from The Allstar break partying in Vegas   Domestic abuse thing with his gf   Pulling out of his basketball camp  Dissing Denver legend Billups  The stupid social media stuff (hookah vid) (I'd love to play for __ team)  Taping Shaw rapping   No doubt any trade at this point needs to be taken with a thank you in my opinion  Unfortunately I don't think a team would give us the old semi pro washing machine deal at this point. Especially after this report they'll just wait and claim him off the wire.  It's sad we will get nothing back for a talented youngish player on the court and possible be on the hook for his salary definitely a big fail IMO on the part of TC and company not unloading him for something in the draft.
denvernuggets,3daiut,DenverbornVikingfan,8,Tue Jul 14 22:36:21 2015 UTC,We stop calling him a cancer for a start. Then we get him into rehab or therapy.
denvernuggets,3daiut,teensonacid,4,Tue Jul 14 21:12:50 2015 UTC,I'll stop calling him a cancer when he stops being a cancer.

denvernuggets,3daiut,sborado,0,Wed Jul 15 07:41:41 2015 UTC,All the rehab in the world won't help someone who doesn't want to help themselves.
denvernuggets,3daiut,Oshawut,2,Wed Jul 15 05:04:04 2015 UTC,Denver is considering waiving Ty. I can see why they want to let him go but damn we can't get anything out of him right now? If this does happen whatever team picks him up is getting a steal
denvernuggets,3daiut,rexgal,2,Tue Jul 14 22:19:38 2015 UTC,"I think they should look into packaging a deal with Ty and Kenneth soon. Cleary they both want out and I think it would be good to have a solid COMMITTED group of guys from day 1 of training camp and really start our rebuild. Both individually wouldn't be up for their full value at this point, but if you package them together we could definitely get something very good in return. I think a lot of teams would jump on a package deal like that, especially since Ty and Kenneth obviously work very well together. I think the worst has yet to come for Ty honestly.. and that being said I don't want him anywhere near Mudiay/the team with the way he's been acting lately."
denvernuggets,3daiut,rexgal,4,Tue Jul 14 19:56:54 2015 UTC,Cleary they both want out    Is it still so clear that Faried wants out? I haven't heard anything from him since the thing about him and Ty not wanting to be part of a rebuild. I really like Faried and would like for him to stick around...
denvernuggets,3daiut,rexgal,3,Tue Jul 14 19:58:56 2015 UTC,"I just assumed he still wanted out because it was the last thing I heard from him... He kind of fell off the map a bit this off season haha. Anyways I saw that Ty posted this picture of them two together on instagram last night https://instagram.com/p/5F73PaP7g2/?taken-by=tylawson3 and just got a feeling that they're both in a similar mindset about the team. I really do love Faried though, I even bought his jersey a few years back. I just know that when Ty gets traded, Kenneth will want out. So we might as well package them together to heighten eachothers trade value and provide us with the best possible outcome.  Edit: I would love to keep Kenneth, but I think he's proven that he will not play to the best of his ability when he is unhappy. He has a bit of a selfish side you could say."
denvernuggets,3daiut,JMadFour,6,Tue Jul 14 20:08:22 2015 UTC,I guess I'm hopeful that Malone can bring out the Manimal just like he got DeMarcus Cousins straightened out in Sacramento.

denvernuggets,3d9qu8,AlienDeg,5,Tue Jul 14 16:35:40 2015 UTC,"I think a huge part of the excitement about Mudiay is that he isn't leading the league in scoring or shots taken or anything like that. Usually PG's go full throttle on offense and score like mad, highlighting themselves. Mudiay is spreading the ball around and making others better, taking leadership of the team, getting some more veteran guys in the right place on the floor, and just generally playing like a more mature player than a rookie.  Of course, it's only the Summer League and it's too early to be calling him the ROTY or putting him in the Hall of Fame, but I think it's more than reasonable to be excited to see how he does in the regular season. He looks more mature than others in the Summer League so I know I'm dying to see how he does with guys who are NBA talents."
denvernuggets,3d9qu8,aatencio91,2,Tue Jul 14 16:59:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think the difference is Mudiay and Jokic, especially Mudiay, pass the eyeball test.  He is making fantastic passes, and making the whole team better. His vision is really impressive, and that won't change based on the competition, although they might not leave people as open or bite on his drives to the hoop as often.  Either way, it is obvious this guy is the real deal,  I don't think there is a question of that.  Combined with his apparent character and attitude, I'm really excited for the future of this team."

There is no panic under pressure; the game is not moving too fast for him.   This is my favorite aspect of his game so far. His demeanor has been cool, calm and collected. It's just summer league so no need to look too hard into anything, but those are attributes you love to see in a point guard and potential team leader."

His shooting still needs work, of course, but that's something we also knew. I still can't believe he fell to 7th in the lottery. I was really hoping my Lakers would take him 2nd overall... instead we picked up a kid who probably should not have been a lottery pick. And how did Sacramento not pick him? They needed a PG! I think Denver fans should feel really happy.  It's amazing that people discounted what Mudiay did as an 18 year in a professional league, while overvaluing the accomplishments of NCAA players playing against college kids, most of whom will never play pro in their lives."

denvernuggets,3d6q6b,corybyu,2,Mon Jul 13 23:59:08 2015 UTC,"I concur with all of this. I always liked Chandler but Gallo was always my favorite player from the Melo trade and has been my favorite player off the Nuggs for the past couple years.  I hate hearing about the trade rumours regarding Danilo, and remember thinking a few weeks ago, that if one of them had to be traded I'd rather it  be Wilson.  But now I'm so torn in that regard, along with feeling shameful for even feeling that way. I hope we can find a way to keep both.  I also feel bad that I haven't put more effort into learning about Wilson as Person. I've always really like the way he plays and he's obviously been one of the key players for the team these last few seasons, but these comments put him in a position to become a legend in this city.  Factoring in the upward trend I think we're all sensing from this organization, his leadership/exciting playstyle and the potential of a very good pick from the Knickyboppers next year, it wouldn't surprise me if he becomes one."

denvernuggets,3d6q6b,damb_b,3,Tue Jul 14 00:35:34 2015 UTC,"Such a win-win signing.  Highly valuable contract in a year or two, high character player to lead your young brigade, and he's a guy who genuinely wants to be here (this is hard to deny after these words, despite my assumptions otherwise over the past few years - Chandler's a hard guy to read).  Foye is also a good character guy, as is Jameer (and Jameer is a great player for Mudiay to learn from).  They're all about surrounding their young players with good influences, regardless of the veteran talent level.  I'm pretty happy with what they're doing, recognizing that we're a ways off from being a great team.  We're focusing on the foundation that makes teams great, which is needed.  The beauty of the Chandler contract is that he could both help the young guys learn the ropes AND be a great trade asset in a year or two.    Now if they could just figure out a Lawson/Hickson deal.  Take advantage of a team with a high dollar expiring guard or something.  I'm even OK with keeping Faried at this point, but Lawson and Hickson have to go."

denvernuggets,3d6q6b,Oshawut,2,Tue Jul 14 06:40:12 2015 UTC,"I will trade Gallo's M jersey, for Chandler's S jersey!"
denvernuggets,3d6q6b,AntNics,2,Mon Jul 13 23:23:10 2015 UTC,I have a L Ty jersey Navy Blue/Yellow colorway I am willing to trade :(
denvernuggets,3d6q6b,skipaBturner,2,Tue Jul 14 03:00:29 2015 UTC,This guy has everything you want as a fan to root for. He could've been greedy and left for a contender but is willing to stay here and see this thing through.   Ill Will <3
denvernuggets,3d6q6b,I3IO_HAZARD,2,Tue Jul 14 00:16:00 2015 UTC,holy shit i love this guy
denvernuggets,3d6q6b,growedup,2,Tue Jul 14 00:18:49 2015 UTC,Welp...time to buy me a Wilson Chandler jersey
denvernuggets,3d6q6b,d-lo_tha_boss,2,Tue Jul 14 03:27:26 2015 UTC,Looks like we're going to see some more Wilson Chandler flair around here.
denvernuggets,3d6q6b,Nugforlife,2,Tue Jul 14 04:20:56 2015 UTC,Fuck yeah Wilson glad to have you buddy. Show this city love and they will give it back tenfold.
denvernuggets,3d84ml,AlienDeg,5,Tue Jul 14 06:40:49 2015 UTC,Can't wait to see more of this guy. I really like how he made his presence known while he was in the paint.
denvernuggets,3d84ml,BlackCucco,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:26:57 2015 UTC,"Joff has looked much more solid. That said, it is Summer League..."
denvernuggets,3d84ml,pairidaeza,2,Tue Jul 14 07:34:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess you're right, but still I like to see that he's improving and gaining some experience. Same goes for Harris and Green since I don't think that they got much playing time last season. Too bad Nurkic isn't playing but you can't be too safe when it comes to injuries."
denvernuggets,3d84ml,BlackCucco,2,Tue Jul 14 07:42:09 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I am very happy with the chemistry of our summer league team but the regular season is a whole different beast.  If I recall rightly, Doug MCDermott killed summer league last year... he's now getting found out at NBA level."
denvernuggets,3d84ml,pairidaeza,3,Tue Jul 14 07:55:41 2015 UTC,Definitely looked like a man amongst boys at times.
denvernuggets,3d7dbg,IdRatherBeLurking,14,Tue Jul 14 02:24:50 2015 UTC,Ian Clark looks like the real deal  Nuggets 3-0 in the summer league!
denvernuggets,3d7dbg,I3IO_HAZARD,10,Tue Jul 14 02:31:20 2015 UTC,"Loved how we battled all game slowly getting their lead down.  That 3 at the end was AWESOME, never thought I'd be so pumped winning a summer league game lol.   Great heart shown by the team coming off the back to back too."
denvernuggets,3d7dbg,AntNics,9,Tue Jul 14 02:28:39 2015 UTC,"I'm sitting at a booth by myself at a bar, doing some studying and watching the game without sound. Bunch of people looked at me funny when I triumphantly shoved my fist into the air"
denvernuggets,3d7dbg,shaner307,8,Tue Jul 14 02:32:54 2015 UTC,Mudiay was so pumped after Clark hit that shot
denvernuggets,3d7dbg,The_Super_Deer,6,Tue Jul 14 02:33:50 2015 UTC,Clark fucking clutched it for us
denvernuggets,3d7dbg,teensonacid,7,Tue Jul 14 02:28:49 2015 UTC,one of the most important parts of this game was the post game interview. speaks volumes of Mudiays character. love it! And that inbounds play...where you at Carter?
denvernuggets,3d7dbg,Futurebrain,4,Tue Jul 14 02:41:34 2015 UTC,"We have so many great guards, I want to keep them all."
denvernuggets,3d7dbg,Futurebrain,10,Tue Jul 14 03:17:29 2015 UTC,I've become slightly irrational about my support for Erick Green.
denvernuggets,3d7dbg,teensonacid,3,Tue Jul 14 03:18:53 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I'm not the only one, his shot is so wet and I feel like he puts so much effort on the court. Then we have Ian Clark going full clutch. Gary just needs to find his shot. Then there's fucking Mudiay. Ty and Jameer, shit. How are we going to play all these guys?"
denvernuggets,3d7dbg,NickCiufi,3,Tue Jul 14 03:26:27 2015 UTC,How are we going to play all these guys?   We're not :-/
denvernuggets,3d7dbg,shaner307,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:29:45 2015 UTC,Gary has to go D-League
denvernuggets,3d7dbg,chucho320,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:49:04 2015 UTC,Something tells me we won't have to be putting Lawson in that list for much longer.
denvernuggets,3d7dbg,BlackCucco,5,Tue Jul 14 18:00:47 2015 UTC,Great game by Clark. Last shot was so clutch
denvernuggets,3d7dbg,shaner307,4,Tue Jul 14 02:27:39 2015 UTC,"What a difference having Mudiay in the games makes.  His court vision is so impressive.  He's the closest to NBA ready than anybody.  I can't wait to see him with our starters.  Really looking forward to seeing him and Jameer working together.  Ian Clark has been putting in work.  Jokic and Lauvergne have moments.  The rest of the team is very rough around the edges.  I know it's early, but I'm excited.  I'd be a lot less hyped without #0 on the floor. Great finish.  Go Nuggets!"
denvernuggets,3d7dbg,BlackCucco,4,Tue Jul 14 03:07:44 2015 UTC,Nice to see them pull off another win. By looking at the box score it seemed like Mudiay was having some trouble with his shots.
denvernuggets,3d7dbg,shaner307,7,Tue Jul 14 02:30:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah his shooting is definitely his biggest weakness, but his playmaking is unbelievable for his age."
denvernuggets,3d7dbg,shaner307,3,Tue Jul 14 02:32:03 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, I think he also had some trouble with shooting early on during the Kings game, but he did eventually get into a rhythm and started to land his shots. For now though it seems like he needs to spend some time improving his shot."
denvernuggets,3d7dbg,cottagecheese24,4,Tue Jul 14 03:01:20 2015 UTC,"He wasn't looking for it enough in the first half, which didn't give him time to warm up. Couple of his shots he just jacked up due to the shot clock."
denvernuggets,3d7dbg,The_NGUYENNER,3,Tue Jul 14 02:33:44 2015 UTC,Does anybody know when the next game is?
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,IdRatherBeLurking,6,Mon Jul 13 23:00:37 2015 UTC,Ohhhhhh!!!
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,shaner307,3,Tue Jul 14 02:14:45 2015 UTC,Clutch Clark
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,shaner307,2,Tue Jul 14 02:15:25 2015 UTC,He's been knocking down 3s
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,trentyz,5,Tue Jul 14 02:16:15 2015 UTC,"Summer league champs, here we come"
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,JMadFour,4,Tue Jul 14 02:18:32 2015 UTC,Shit i will never get to watch these games live lol
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,bastegod,3,Tue Jul 14 00:03:23 2015 UTC,The difference with Mudiay in the game versus out of it is night and day.
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,SapoC,5,Tue Jul 14 01:06:57 2015 UTC,King Joffrey should be getting more attention. He's been extremely solid.
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,nickagain,3,Tue Jul 14 01:14:39 2015 UTC,Dude never stops hustling.
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,The_Super_Deer,2,Tue Jul 14 01:17:01 2015 UTC,Lauvergne Shirley will provide a lift for us this year. H/T Brent Barry.
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,trentyz,2,Tue Jul 14 01:45:17 2015 UTC,Poor guy can't avoid bad nicknames.
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,trentyz,4,Tue Jul 14 01:47:12 2015 UTC,HOOOOOOLLY FUCK
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,teensonacid,4,Tue Jul 14 02:15:32 2015 UTC,"Do or die defense, lezgo!  E: Or just get shoved, that works!"
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,shaner307,5,Tue Jul 14 02:16:38 2015 UTC,I'm on that F5 buzz!
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,The_Super_Deer,2,Tue Jul 14 02:17:31 2015 UTC,One last bout of D. Green swished his FTs like a champ. LETS GO
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,shaner307,2,Tue Jul 14 02:19:11 2015 UTC,"Of course he did, it's Erick ""Scoring Threat"" Green!"
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,teensonacid,3,Tue Jul 14 02:33:31 2015 UTC,AND THERE IS OUR NEW LEADER
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,teensonacid,3,Tue Jul 14 02:22:03 2015 UTC,That dude gives me so much hope for the future
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,bastegod,3,Tue Jul 14 02:23:16 2015 UTC,I was hoping to see us whoop Justice Winslow but I guess a summer league win is more important ;-)
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,shaner307,3,Mon Jul 13 23:24:04 2015 UTC,Let's go Nuggets! Really like what I've seen from some of the young guys so far.
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,shaner307,3,Tue Jul 14 00:09:01 2015 UTC,LET'S GOOOOOO
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,CPage12,3,Tue Jul 14 00:30:00 2015 UTC,Get on that horse Gary!
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,trentyz,3,Tue Jul 14 00:31:01 2015 UTC,sup Tim!
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,trentyz,2,Tue Jul 14 00:51:20 2015 UTC,Timmy lookin' sharp!
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,trentyz,3,Tue Jul 14 00:54:15 2015 UTC,Was that a pass or a shot? Let's call that a pass.
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,shaner307,3,Tue Jul 14 01:07:44 2015 UTC,"Yes - we call it the ""Missed Shot Ultrafake"""
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,teensonacid,3,Tue Jul 14 01:10:17 2015 UTC,"Last play of the game, let's go Nuggets!!!"
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,shaner307,2,Tue Jul 14 02:12:19 2015 UTC,Who takes the shot?
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,teensonacid,3,Tue Jul 14 02:13:31 2015 UTC,WHAT IS THIS HORESHIT  E: HOOOOLY SHIT IAN CLARK!!!!
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,CPage12,3,Tue Jul 14 02:13:17 2015 UTC,IAN CLARK!!
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,teensonacid,3,Tue Jul 14 02:15:04 2015 UTC,IAN CLARK!!! GET THAT MAN A ROSTER SPOT
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,lovely447,3,Tue Jul 14 02:15:58 2015 UTC,I am at work and can only follow on the nba website but... AM I SEEING THINGS CORRECTLY?!?!?!?!
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,corybyu,2,Tue Jul 14 02:16:00 2015 UTC,It's magic baby
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,orangesoda123,2,Tue Jul 14 02:18:09 2015 UTC,"I loved all the posts yesterday like ""I have Mudiay fever and I'm not looking for a remedy"", that made me laugh. And all the ""I'm Mudigay"" hahaha, good stuff."
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,teensonacid,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:34:23 2015 UTC,Great to see people having a good time after the shiyshow that was last season.
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,CPage12,2,Tue Jul 14 02:36:37 2015 UTC,"I'm on the Mudiay hype train so hard, I may as well be the conductor! Haha I'll organize another trip to Denver hopefully by the end of this coming season."
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,CPage12,3,Tue Jul 14 02:38:32 2015 UTC,3-0 guys!!!!  Edit..As long as nothing crazy happens here
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,teensonacid,3,Tue Jul 14 02:16:47 2015 UTC,in bounds play complete
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,The_Super_Deer,3,Tue Jul 14 02:17:07 2015 UTC,Really love everything I'm hearing from Mudiay. I'm so pumped for next year already haha
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,CPage12,4,Tue Jul 14 02:22:21 2015 UTC,focus shift! let's get hype!! GO NUGS!
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,CPage12,4,Mon Jul 13 23:05:26 2015 UTC,Apparently the heat are 6-0 and Winslow is about to make his debut so this should be fun
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,nickagain,4,Tue Jul 14 00:03:25 2015 UTC,oohh hell yes...i'm psyched!

denvernuggets,3d6nhv,shaner307,2,Mon Jul 13 23:25:29 2015 UTC,Did it start yet?
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,shaner307,3,Tue Jul 14 00:17:31 2015 UTC,Doesn't appear to have. I'm getting impatient! I need some more Mudiay!!
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,ParadeShitter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:20:21 2015 UTC,not yet
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,shaner307,2,Tue Jul 14 00:26:57 2015 UTC,Here we go
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,shaner307,2,Tue Jul 14 00:24:35 2015 UTC,THAT OOP
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,d-lo_tha_boss,2,Tue Jul 14 00:31:51 2015 UTC,swamped at work so can only really listen...i hear alot clangs
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,TriceraScotts,2,Tue Jul 14 00:50:39 2015 UTC,Mudi is looking like he's hesitant to go to the rim or take a shot.
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,d-lo_tha_boss,2,Tue Jul 14 01:00:48 2015 UTC,Anyone else feel like they're getting fouls left and right?
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,TriceraScotts,2,Tue Jul 14 01:11:41 2015 UTC,Harris is getting smacked on the head every time he drives
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,teensonacid,2,Tue Jul 14 01:12:42 2015 UTC,Where's Jokic been?
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,AnthonyDavis_,2,Tue Jul 14 01:13:20 2015 UTC,Maybe they're working out Smith/Biruta?
denvernuggets,3d6nhv,chupaunkas,2,Tue Jul 14 01:13:54 2015 UTC,Nice run to end the half
denvernuggets,3d51xm,IdRatherBeLurking,11,Mon Jul 13 16:11:04 2015 UTC,"That's gotta be backwards, right? If that deal for Jokic is really 4 years, 5.5M that's an amazing value. He hasn't played a minute yet but at that rate there is very little risk."
denvernuggets,3d51xm,tron777,11,Mon Jul 13 16:29:13 2015 UTC,"So.. with Mudiay, Green, Jameer... I can't imagine this means Ty is staying around, right?  It would be tough to get these guys decent minutes.  I feel like that is a great deal for Jameer though, as he will be a great mentor for Mudiay as well."
denvernuggets,3d51xm,corybyu,7,Mon Jul 13 16:47:47 2015 UTC,"He's here until we can get a decent return for him, which is not going to be easy.  Expect to see a lot of 2 PG back court this season."
denvernuggets,3d51xm,damb_b,12,Mon Jul 13 17:15:04 2015 UTC,"Better than Foye playing point, I say!"
denvernuggets,3d51xm,Kawnar,7,Mon Jul 13 17:21:17 2015 UTC,Welcome back Jameer!
denvernuggets,3d51xm,corybyu,5,Mon Jul 13 16:11:11 2015 UTC,Sad day for Green. :(
denvernuggets,3d51xm,damb_b,4,Mon Jul 13 16:31:17 2015 UTC,"Can't we just move Green to SG?  He is more of a scorer than facilitator anyway, and we really need scoring.  I would have no problem with him backing up Harris.   Of course, some of our PGs will be taking those minutes whether Ty stays or not, so there won't be a ton to go around."
denvernuggets,3d51xm,Kawnar,3,Mon Jul 13 16:46:15 2015 UTC,"I agree, seems like Green would work out OK as a backup shooting guard.  He isn't terribly undersized and we're thin at the position.  Why not?"
denvernuggets,3d51xm,corybyu,3,Mon Jul 13 17:21:26 2015 UTC,"sure, but SG is stacked too. Harris/Foye/Barton/Clark?  This team just has too many players"
denvernuggets,3d51xm,tron777,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:22:18 2015 UTC,How many NBA-level SGs can he defend against?
denvernuggets,3d51xm,growedup,2,Mon Jul 13 22:20:55 2015 UTC,"Not sure, but if he were in with Mudiay for example, I would put Mudiay on the SG for defense.  But yeah, who knows, it is tough to say.  I would say we would usually have him in against backup SGs, and Harris defending against star players though."
denvernuggets,3d51xm,damb_b,5,Mon Jul 13 22:32:32 2015 UTC,"It's hard for me to see the Nugs giving Ty and Jameer more minutes than Green, but I can definitely see us starting Jameer with Mudi behind him and Green at the end of the bench.  Ty Lawson's getting a whole lot of money to not play starting minutes if him, Jameer and Mudiay are on the same roster."
denvernuggets,3d51xm,phatlever,8,Mon Jul 13 16:32:25 2015 UTC,"Let's not get ahead of ourselves. If Ty is on the team this year, he surely pulls more PG minutes than anyone else on this roster. I would stake a large sum of money on it."
denvernuggets,3d51xm,Kickpuncher-2,6,Mon Jul 13 16:45:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The Nuggets are in a place where Ty can be moved, but they're not going to trade him for pennies on the dollar. I expect him to be the starter game 1."
denvernuggets,3d51xm,rvhack,3,Mon Jul 13 17:00:27 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, and not only because he is a great player and was 3rd in the NBA in assists last season, but because if there's no deal now, we need to work on his value, and the only way to do that is start him and give him a lot of minutes to showcase his talents before February."
denvernuggets,3d51xm,nugsfan5280,6,Mon Jul 13 17:19:55 2015 UTC,"I thought it was interesting how Malone kept referring to having Jameer during last night's summer league game, I was like ""does he know that he opted out?""  But it looks like he knew what he was talking about all along."
denvernuggets,3d51xm,SirJoris,3,Mon Jul 13 17:38:09 2015 UTC,"I thought he might have just been of the mindset that, ""we're trying to bring him back, so I'm assuming he's with us when we plan ahead"", but it looks like he knew the deal was in the pipeline!"
denvernuggets,3d51xm,phatlever,5,Mon Jul 13 17:39:25 2015 UTC,"Surely there's a trade incoming, unless Malone plans to give Mudiay major minutes at SG?"
denvernuggets,3d51xm,Kawnar,4,Mon Jul 13 16:26:25 2015 UTC,"It's not unreasonable but I think the real victim would be Erick green if we go on as is.  That being said, it might be best for the team to wait for the right deal before moving anyone."
denvernuggets,3d51xm,OkAutopilot,4,Mon Jul 13 16:29:33 2015 UTC,Green is short lived for this team anyway
denvernuggets,3d51xm,phatlever,7,Mon Jul 13 16:30:25 2015 UTC,"Which is a shame, I think he's really starting to get comfortable."
denvernuggets,3d51xm,Oshawut,2,Mon Jul 13 16:31:15 2015 UTC,Yup. I´m liking his play this summer league
denvernuggets,3d51xm,Heczia,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:23:28 2015 UTC,I think I'm in the minority on Green but I just don't see it with him.  He doesn't seem to be able to get himself good looks off the dribble and doesn't have the court vision to be a PG.  He's undersized and not quite quick enough.  Plus his jumpshot seems to be streaky.
denvernuggets,3d51xm,teensonacid,2,Mon Jul 13 17:50:39 2015 UTC,6'3 is undersized?
denvernuggets,3d51xm,AntNics,2,Mon Jul 13 19:34:27 2015 UTC,I assume he meant muscle not height.
denvernuggets,3d51xm,KillorFireMcFail,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:08:58 2015 UTC,Yea I honestly didn't know his height but he seems to get pushed around.
denvernuggets,3d51xm,followthelawson,3,Mon Jul 13 21:39:44 2015 UTC,"I hope not, still needs to work on that shot before moving to SG, plus his passing is too on point to not play point. I feel like Ty moving real soon"
denvernuggets,3d51xm,ParadeShitter,2,Mon Jul 13 16:31:36 2015 UTC,"Great news, Jameer was balling at the end of the season!"
denvernuggets,3d5ld7,rtrainer30,9,Mon Jul 13 18:28:32 2015 UTC,I am starting to read a lot of this. I love this guy out of the draft and had hoped the Lakers would have drafted him. I think Russell will be really good but I think Mudiay is going to be at a whole other level.
denvernuggets,3d5ld7,TwoChe,2,Mon Jul 13 18:29:41 2015 UTC,"As a Houston fan, I am very scared about the wording of this headline.  When we drafted JJ Watt we had a clown write an article saying we would rue the day we picked a pizza boy over Suh"
denvernuggets,3d5ld7,OilSheikh,5,Tue Jul 14 15:14:24 2015 UTC,pls
denvernuggets,3d5ld7,The_NGUYENNER,5,Mon Jul 13 20:22:29 2015 UTC,"nice read, love that it was by a Lakers fan"
denvernuggets,3d5ld7,mcorcoran3,3,Mon Jul 13 20:47:29 2015 UTC,"I am a Celtics fan and I concur with most of this article. I can understand Orlando going for a wing since they have Payton (I like  Mudiay better, but development would've been stumped for both of them in that situation). But the Knicks and the Kings should of drafted him for sure. He and Russell will both be remembered from this draft, but Mudiay is a better athlete, though less polished and skilled than Russell. Point is, I thought Mudiay and Winslow both fell too far"
denvernuggets,3d67k7,aatencio91,2,Mon Jul 13 21:02:47 2015 UTC,I'm sure he had a good reason guys. It would be hard for anyone to dissapoint that many kids without a really good reason to do so.
denvernuggets,3d67k7,skipaBturner,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:41:43 2015 UTC,I doubt it. The dude seems like he gives no fucks. He had enough time to go to the Entourage premier but he can't be at his own camp. I want him gone.
denvernuggets,3d67k7,Neverethe,0,Tue Jul 14 01:57:06 2015 UTC,"the entourage premier happened a week or so ago, so who knows what his has happened now that is holding him back from attending his own camp. I know people say he doesn't give a fuck about denver but what evidence is there to suggest he doesn't care about letting children down"
denvernuggets,3d67k7,skipaBturner,2,Tue Jul 14 02:54:49 2015 UTC,If he had something serious holding him back from being here his media circle would have let that out. I just don't think the guy gives a fuck about anything in Denver anymore.
denvernuggets,3d67k7,Neverethe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:59:38 2015 UTC,"That's how I feel.  If his PR team had any way to mitigate this other than ""couldn't make it due to travel schedule"", they would have.  Never knew we had so many Lawson apologists here.  Loved his play and potential, but come on folks.  He sure seems to have taken the ""fuck this"" approach to his current situation."
denvernuggets,3d67k7,damb_b,2,Tue Jul 14 03:10:43 2015 UTC,He wants to be traded. I just don't know if he's smart enough to realize that the way he is acting is negatively going to impact his chances of signing places long-term. Nobody wants to commit to an asshole.

denvernuggets,3d67k7,damb_b,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:22:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not apologising for Lawson. IMO i think he's definitely made it awkward for his own return to denver this coming season. Especially since he hasn't reached out to mudiay, considering Ty is the best player on our team, and the hype mudiay has been receiving. I love Ty, but he's hurt his image in denver badly. However, in light of him not attending his kids camp, I don't think it's fair to assume that Ty lawson doesn't give a fuck and that why he's not attending his camp. We have been given no evidence to make that call"
denvernuggets,3d67k7,skipaBturner,2,Tue Jul 14 09:38:31 2015 UTC,"I don't hate Ty Lawson.  I'm just not as attached to him as some Nuggets fans are. I don't have that history with him as a fan of the Team. I won't be upset when he is traded, unless the Nuggets don't get anything worthwhile back for him.  same goes for Faried and Gallo."
denvernuggets,3d67k7,JMadFour,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:51:00 2015 UTC,"I have the history.  Still remember watching Minny draft him for us and thinking ""no way!"" as a big UNC fan just a few months after watching him lead his 'Heels to a national championship with a broken toe.  I was one of his biggest proponents since he got here, and even I'm over him after the last several months or so.  The social media bullshit, the giving up last season, his failure to lead, he's pretty much proven to me that he's over being the man on the Denver Nuggets.  I still want him to be successful elsewhere, but he needs to grow up, suck it up, and be a pro.  When you're the center of ongoing trade drama, the only thing you should be saying is ""I look forward to my opportunities, and I understand that this is a business"" like every other real deal pro in this situation in the past."

People spent money to send their children there and it appears that Lawson thumbed his nose at them because some fans and media have turned on him. It's immature and without a damn good excuse I can't ignore it. If you said you would be somewhere, you should be there, especially if children are counting on it and people put money in your pocket expecting you to be there."
denvernuggets,3d67k7,RiseNShine24,3,Mon Jul 13 22:27:23 2015 UTC,"a bait and switch    Is that what you think this is? That he's trying to rob parents out of their money by not being able to make it to the camp for the first time in 6 years? This camp is partnered with Ty, but first and foremost it is a skills camp.

denvernuggets,3d5yib,ParadeShitter,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:03:43 2015 UTC,Boston fan here.  How often is he injured?  I would think that DA is offering Sullinger and Turner. Maybe we'd have to add a pick to that as well. I don't really know how good this guy is.
denvernuggets,3d5yib,Mom-spaghetti,5,Mon Jul 13 20:28:45 2015 UTC,"often enough that it's a cause for concern  sullinger, turner and a pick seems like too much for a guy with only a year left on his contract.   thing is, sullinger will never be anything more than a rotational piece. turner is a lower end starter at his position. gallo, if healthy, is a piece that can change games for you. he's got that much talent and versatility. at 26 he's really just entering his prime and, if healthy, he has more upside than anything the celtics could give up honestly. the nuggets aren't title contenders this year, they should roll the dice with gallo and just hope for health.   he's not a piece that if the nuggets lose, like aldridge, it'll cripple their future. they're better off keeping him and hoping to resign him at this point imo"
denvernuggets,3d5yib,ParadeShitter,5,Mon Jul 13 20:35:16 2015 UTC,"He loves Denver, loves Hess and the staff, and is BFFs with Chandler. I definitely say we take a chance on keeping him, and if his intentions aren't to stay here, I reckon he has the respect to tell us so."

I'm fine with losing Ty or even Faried (although I hope we can keep him), but Gallo leaving would make me really sad.  I feel like Nuggets fans know his potential and it is hard for me to see us getting enough value for him from other teams to make it worth it."

Ty is a point guard, that is his position, that is what his strengths are. It's not like he's a tweener or a combo guard, he is a full fledged ball dominant playmaking point guard. Ty is not going to want to all of a sudden start playing the 5'11"" SG position, and a team and coach would not be foolish enough to do that. It's a waste of his talent to do that and not only will it not translate well on the court but if Ty was unhappy about the situation in Denver before he would be livid if they put him in a spot where he is unable to succeed to his fullest as a player.

Basically what the guy is on a tirade about is that Ty talks a lot of talk but doesn't walk a lot of walk, which I'm more than okay with.  The shiz he's doing off the court doesn't help one bit.  He doesn't even have time to watch his replacement in the Summer League.  Ty had better start feeding the homeless, visiting a children's hostpital, or at least hosting a basketball camp to get back into good graces with everyone...  Oh, right."
denvernuggets,3d69tb,chucho320,3,Mon Jul 13 22:47:01 2015 UTC,"lol you really have selective memory, huh? He's consistently been our best player since Melo left. He's played great in both the regular season and the playoffs. He's improved and added to his game. If you want to ignore all that and act like our sports players should be pinnacles of the community, go right ahead."
denvernuggets,3d69tb,IdRatherBeLurking,0,Mon Jul 13 22:49:55 2015 UTC,"It's not that selective.  I remember all of that, and almost all of his disappearing acts when he was needed the most.  But I'm not a Lawson apologist, so I can go ahead and acknowledge the bad with what little good he's done.  What did the article say that wasn't true?  I'd rather win 30 games without him and his consistency, which we can do just fine.  Thanks for the memories, Ty."
denvernuggets,3d69tb,chucho320,0,Mon Jul 13 22:58:35 2015 UTC,"when he was needed the most.   Sure, like when?    with what little good he's done.    lol right. Keep saying that. Doesn't make it any less false."
denvernuggets,3d69tb,IdRatherBeLurking,-1,Mon Jul 13 22:59:28 2015 UTC,"Sure, like when?   Oh, just every single 4th quarter.   lol right. Keep saying that. Doesn't make it any less false.   Ah, that's right.  Our goodwill ambassador, Ty.  Our stone cold killer.  Our team leader who consistently put the team on his shoulders.  So much good.  I'm sure he's gong to take Emmanual right under his wing.    Why can't people just give this guy another pass?  He's only calling out Colorado's biggest bball legend after he spoke some truth about him in a professional manner.  sniffle Leave Ty alone!"

Why is his word law around here? Just because he's from Colorado?"

Lawson has been awesome on the court, he is a winner and he is frustrated with where the team has been heading the last two seasons. Now this doesn't make up for how he is acting, and a trade is mosthe likely going to happen now, but like he said himself he just wants to win.   Dude didn't need to attack Ty Lawsons game, especially trying to compare him or any of the teams Ty has been on to the championship Pistons. He has never had a team like that around him, closest he had was in 2012 and that went to cap still."
denvernuggets,3d3874,teensonacid,12,Mon Jul 13 04:08:24 2015 UTC,"I love Ty but....as said already, Billups is an NBA champion who just so happened to go to university in Colorado and go to high school just off Leetsdale. Chauncey is a bball king in Denver."
denvernuggets,3d3874,radektheczar,6,Mon Jul 13 08:37:03 2015 UTC,It's weird that Chauncey is Denver's favorite son and yet we traded him twice.

denvernuggets,3d3874,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Mon Jul 13 15:58:17 2015 UTC,"It could have been avoided if the Nuggets prioritized loyalty over the good of the franchise. It's not really loyalty if there's no sacrifice involved, is it?"

denvernuggets,3d3874,orangesoda123,11,Mon Jul 13 13:08:46 2015 UTC,Damn. Ty was easily my favorite nugget. Was so excited when we drafted him because I loved his style of game and especially his humble attitude. Now he just comes off as an immature brat. No doubt in my mind that he's gone this off season. What a shame.
denvernuggets,3d3874,aatencio91,2,Mon Jul 13 05:05:23 2015 UTC,Yea it's pretty dissapointing.

denvernuggets,3d3874,depressedcarguy,4,Mon Jul 13 05:44:54 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. But don't you think Ty should probably keep his mouth shut a bit more often? Or if he has somethung to say in response to Billups it should be more along the lines of ""that hurts to hear that. I pride myself on leading this team."" Listen I love Ty too, but his attitude through media absolutely stinks right now. He's got to clean it up for people to start taking him seriously again"
denvernuggets,3d3874,shaner307,5,Mon Jul 13 09:04:33 2015 UTC,"It's all just perception, he's just defending himself in the only way he knows how. You gotta see that the media has this dude backed into a corner with all this talk and criticism. People don't realize that its the same guy, he hasn't changed, he's always been a little eccentric. Is he a locker room or off the court leader? No. But that doesn't mean he's not a great player from us. Maybe we can kick starter him a PR guy haha."
denvernuggets,3d3874,FatLever12,5,Mon Jul 13 13:42:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing, I have the same opinion. Ty annoys me, but I do feel a lot of the hate and criticism we as fans are putting on Ty are causing a negative feedback loop to the whole situation. He is a nugget and I like nugget players because I am a fan of the nuggets. Hopefully he can find his stride again and get positive about the season and help win us games, or he gets traded and everyone is happy."

denvernuggets,3d33hx,eg14000,2,Mon Jul 13 06:13:08 2015 UTC,"He's a second round pick who held Cauley Stein to 1 rebound.  He's fundamentally sound, boxes out on evey play.    I know this is a unpopular opinion, but I think Mudiay had more timing issues in the pick and roll than Jokic.  Both had an amazing game but mudiay had six turnovers.  However a double double is a double double, I think both players exciting future. No player on this team was disappointing."

I always thought he was the second best player in the draft and I still stand by it. His passing is on par with Russell but he has the penetration and athleticism to compliment his game which takes him to the next level.

These big men are legit.   Joffrey brings hart, and Jokic is just simply a better prospect then Cauley-Stein.  Cauley-Stein is more athletic, but Jokic is better in ever other facet of the game, including defense.   To think these guys were both second round picks, just wow.  I love Tim Connolly."

denvernuggets,3d2cdy,The_NGUYENNER,5,Mon Jul 13 00:34:41 2015 UTC,Super impressed by Mudiays passing ability and court vision.
denvernuggets,3d2cdy,corybyu,4,Mon Jul 13 00:37:37 2015 UTC,GR33N!!
denvernuggets,3d2cdy,The_NGUYENNER,4,Mon Jul 13 00:41:07 2015 UTC,"If Green can score like this, is there any chance we could just move him to shooting guard to split time with Harris?  Assuming Ty sticks around for PG of course."
denvernuggets,3d2cdy,teensonacid,4,Mon Jul 13 00:49:39 2015 UTC,even though it's costing him some TO's right now... I kinda love how ballsy Mudi is with his passes
denvernuggets,3d2cdy,CPage12,3,Mon Jul 13 00:55:27 2015 UTC,His attitude is awesome.  Can't wait to see him on the big stage
denvernuggets,3d2cdy,teensonacid,4,Mon Jul 13 00:56:59 2015 UTC,smashing the summer league so far. GOIN ALL THE WAY BABY

denvernuggets,3d2cdy,corybyu,3,Mon Jul 13 00:23:38 2015 UTC,man Harris lookin pretty bad out there
denvernuggets,3d2cdy,Arrow218,3,Mon Jul 13 00:29:38 2015 UTC,Why can't he get his shot to fall? It seems crazy.
denvernuggets,3d2cdy,teensonacid,3,Mon Jul 13 00:29:56 2015 UTC,Beautiful pass from Mudiay to Green!!  I love this kid already.

denvernuggets,3d2cdy,CPage12,4,Mon Jul 13 01:26:43 2015 UTC,"I can't tell if he just let that slip, or he's just speaking as if Jameer is coming back."
denvernuggets,3d2cdy,teensonacid,3,Mon Jul 13 01:27:57 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly. I hope it's true.
denvernuggets,3d2cdy,with2nns,3,Mon Jul 13 01:31:01 2015 UTC,this top 10 is so good
denvernuggets,3d2cdy,teensonacid,4,Mon Jul 13 01:30:14 2015 UTC,Can't wait to see more Mudiay and Jokic!
denvernuggets,3d2cdy,CPage12,5,Sun Jul 12 23:31:00 2015 UTC,Safe to say our 3 shooting is really bad... but our passing is... woo oh my god.
denvernuggets,3d2cdy,Arrow218,3,Mon Jul 13 00:35:52 2015 UTC,"And it's all coming from guys who will be on the court next year. Imagine when they're dishing to the likes of Ill Wil, Gallo and Barton."

denvernuggets,3d2cdy,teensonacid,2,Mon Jul 13 00:39:08 2015 UTC,Mudiay didn't make the shot (maybe fouled) but man he's fast
denvernuggets,3d2cdy,The_Super_Deer,2,Mon Jul 13 00:48:00 2015 UTC,MUDI!
denvernuggets,3d2cdy,minutemandan,2,Mon Jul 13 00:48:17 2015 UTC,ROSCOOOOOO
denvernuggets,3d2cdy,The_Super_Deer,2,Mon Jul 13 00:54:20 2015 UTC,"I've been in Vegas this weekend and have been really excited by some of our guys. Mudiay has made some great passes, especially today,  and Green's shot is really smooth today too."
denvernuggets,3d2cdy,The_Super_Deer,2,Mon Jul 13 01:02:55 2015 UTC,"Is it just me or does Jokic look like a good defensive center? Him being a Euro, I wasn't expecting much. Fouls a ton though."

denvernuggets,3d2cdy,speedway206,2,Mon Jul 13 01:20:22 2015 UTC,Harris find his spot?
denvernuggets,3d30sb,JMadFour,6,Mon Jul 13 03:03:02 2015 UTC,"You're one of us in my mind.  I think they could definitely play together. Nurkic as the post-up rim protector, and Jokic on the perimeter."
denvernuggets,3d30sb,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Mon Jul 13 03:12:43 2015 UTC,"Jokic can guard the perimeter?  i guess the question really is, can he guard the diverse types of 4s equally. the inside bangers and the Stretch-4s."
denvernuggets,3d30sb,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Mon Jul 13 03:14:54 2015 UTC,His defense is pretty unknown at this point.
denvernuggets,3d30sb,eg14000,2,Mon Jul 13 03:17:05 2015 UTC,"I consider him a better fundamental defender than Cauley Stein.  2 blocks and 3 steals are pretty impressive, especially if you factor in all the shots he affected and changed."
denvernuggets,3d2q40,minutemandan,5,Mon Jul 13 01:29:20 2015 UTC,"He didn't say he was returning, he said that Mudiay has a lot to learn from Ty and Jameer."

denvernuggets,3d0gk2,followthelawson,3,Sun Jul 12 16:34:48 2015 UTC,"I mostly like it, but it's a little too busy for my taste. Too many blocks in the skyline with too few colors. Other than that, very nice!"

denvernuggets,3cz4oy,b2therian,12,Sun Jul 12 03:00:15 2015 UTC,"Going from reports, Malone seems to have let him be a leader of this team."
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,eathbau,2,Sun Jul 12 02:40:41 2015 UTC,"He recognizes that Gallo is made of glass, that's good.  Plus, this contract is going to be very desirable if Wil keeps his rate of play up."
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,damb_b,10,Sun Jul 12 14:47:49 2015 UTC,"Lol I read this as ""resigned"" as in quit or something and I panicked and was like wtf?  I'm really glad we're locking up Chandler for a couple more years, have always loved the dude. Good move by the Nuggets"
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,I3IO_HAZARD,12,Sun Jul 12 03:00:22 2015 UTC,Let anyone who doubted that we run a tight ship recognize that the Nuggets twitter account announced this.
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:38:30 2015 UTC,Duly noted
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,NUGGman,8,Sun Jul 12 16:33:12 2015 UTC,Re-Signed.
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,isecretlyjudgeyou,2,Sun Jul 12 05:06:16 2015 UTC,"Yep, easy to have a lapse in judgement when resigned and re-signed both sound the same in your head... haha"
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,JMadFour,4,Sun Jul 12 05:07:11 2015 UTC,"How many Ill Wills can a team have? Is there a Cap on such things?  Also, why are some fans on twitter seemingly unhappy about this?"
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,eathbau,5,Sun Jul 12 02:47:00 2015 UTC,I'm waiting for the contract details to come out. I'm hoping it'd be similar to what he was on.
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,trevor28,6,Sun Jul 12 02:51:58 2015 UTC,4 yrs/46 mil according to WOJ
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,damb_b,2,Sun Jul 12 02:53:12 2015 UTC,"They rolled his 2015-2016 salary into the new 4 year/$46 million contract, so I'll be interested in seeing how it's structured as well.  Also, just because we extended him doesn't mean we're not going to trade him at some point in the next year or so.  Smart signing, good value when the cap increases."
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,utw,4,Sun Jul 12 14:50:21 2015 UTC,"That's a great signing.  Gallo fans, I wouldn't be worried yet. This doesn't necessarily prevent a Chandler trade. Chandler on a long, cheap contract is a great asset.   Gallinari was so good at the end of last season I think the Nuggets prefer to wait and see what they have with him at the start of the year. Having Chandler locked up at least gives them options no matter what Gallo does.  If he's fine, and the Nuggets can get him for roughly the same price as Chandler, that's a pair of very good contracts under the new cap that can either be used as trade pieces, or to have at least one be there once Nurkic, Jokic and Mudiay are ready."
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,damb_b,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:10:26 2015 UTC,"Gallinari was so good at the end of last season I think the Nuggets prefer to wait and see what they have with him at the start of the year.   Much as I want to love Gallo, we say this every year, and he gets hurt and misses half or more of the season every year.  If we're giving him another chance this year, it's gotta be his last one."
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,with2nns,3,Sun Jul 12 14:56:51 2015 UTC,"He missed 13-14 because of that fluky knee injury. I know he missed a few weeks in Dec-Jan last season on account of his meniscus, but he still played 59 games, that's nearly 75% of the year."
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,damb_b,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:29:43 2015 UTC,"Never played a season without significant injury. He goes down every year. Plus, he takes a long time to get his confidence back after injury. I love him when he's on, but we lean on him then lose him. Throws chemistry off. Need more consistency."
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,NUGGman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:19:05 2015 UTC,Come on... Never?!?
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,damb_b,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:31:07 2015 UTC,"Don't think so. Don't have the patience to look it up right now, but I don't think he's ever had a season without a significant injury. Maybe he has, but he has been injured most seasons. Like i said, I do like the guy, bet he is injury prone, and that effects the whole team, no doubt about it."
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,with2nns,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:01:11 2015 UTC,"Excluding his rookie and 13-14 years he's played most games 4/5 seasons. It's not like he's made of glass, and I don't think it's fair to expect an injury. Plus he averaged 20 ppg during the last half or so of last season. I'd say his confidence is back."
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,damb_b,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:59:57 2015 UTC,"He has only played over 70 games twice his entire career, and one of those he still had a season-ending injury.  He is consistentlly injured.  And whenever he does come back form injury, he plays at 25-50% for three weeks before he starts getting his confidence back.  This is not the kind of guy you want your team leaning on.  We need more consistency.  Like I said, love the guy, but he needs to play somewhere where he is not relied on as much as he is here.  3rd option on a contender would be great for him.   And if you want to talk about games he's missed: He's missed 20 or more games in all but 2 seasons (one of which ended in season/next season ending injury).  He averages 57 games a season over his career, and that's excluding the 13-14 season where he didn't play at all.  Gallo misses a lot of games due to injury."
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,with2nns,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:29:55 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, I just think it's unfair to predict future injuries based on past ones, unless it's Joel Embiid situation or achilles tear which apparently wrecks careers. The guy's confidence should be fine based on the end of last year, so that's a moot point barring something unforeseen.  If he's the guy we lean on, we're not going anywhere. By the time we turn into a playoff threat, I figure Mudiay and Nurkic will be the 1-2 pinch, with Gallo, Jokic, and Harris hopefully rounding things out."
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,CPage12,5,Mon Jul 13 00:55:10 2015 UTC,4/46 is reasonable. I'd much rather roll with Gallo as our SF of the future though
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,Jurrahcane,3,Sun Jul 12 05:24:15 2015 UTC,"With absolutely all due respect to Chandler, is this the right deal for us going forward?  Chandler, to me, symbolises everything that has been wrong with us for the past few years - he is a decent player that doesn't do anything great, and we've given him $12 million for it.  Am I being a little harsh?  Possibly, but I don't think he is necessarily worth that and we may have been able to spend the money somewhere else in the future.  More than happy to be proven wrong, it just feels a little underwhelming."
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,BASKETBALLgod,2,Sun Jul 12 06:41:23 2015 UTC,"he can hit the 3, averages more assists than turnovers, guards multiple positions, rebounds and just turned 28."
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,DenverLn,0,Sun Jul 12 07:36:51 2015 UTC,"By the time this team becomes good again he won't be in his prime. It's still a slight overpay for what you get but nothing too crazy.  That being said, I'd much rather have picks/young assets. This team won't sniff the playoffs until 2017-18 at the earliest (assuming they do a rebuild correctly)."
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,hotsauce888,6,Sun Jul 12 10:46:08 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, you're going nowhere if you can't match up at the small forward position in the nba. I think this is a good signing."
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,DenverLn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:44:36 2015 UTC,"Except that's mostly irrelevant since, as I said before, Wilson will be out of his prime and towards the end of his career by the time this team becomes good again.   Either Gallo, a draft pick, or a different FA (one that is starting caliber, Wilson is NOT on a contender) can match up at SF...But we're talking about 2-3 years down the road anyway."
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,hotsauce888,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:38:19 2015 UTC,"Nah dude, I hear you that this team won't be good for a few years, but the new salary cap limit will make his contract seem like a great value. What other 6'8 220 pound small forward with his defensive capabilities will be available for 12 mil in two years? I can't think of one. Gallo has more promise as an offensive player but I think this contract will look great in a few years."
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,damb_b,2,Mon Jul 13 07:12:28 2015 UTC,"Not an overpay when the salary cap goes up $35 million and teams start paying lesser players more money.  In fact, they already have.  DeAndre Jordan just got a $20 million/year contract for crying out loud, and he's about as one-dimensional as it gets.  Wesley Matthews just got a bigger payday than this too, and dude's a career bench player.  Comparatively, Wilson for $12 million is a great deal.   He does a lot, is level-headed, and predictable.  Good guy for the youngsters to learn from."
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,DenverLn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:54:48 2015 UTC,"Calling DJ one dimensional is a bit silly. He's a great rebounder and very strong defensively. His offensive game isn't great but also isn't horrible. Real Plus-Minus has him as the 4th best center in the NBA, and I think that's about right. DeAndre is way, way more valuable than Chandler. It's not even close.   Wesley Matthews is a pretty good player as well. Much better defensively than Wilson. Offensively I'd take Matthews over Wilson although that category is closer. Wilson would be a bench player on any good team."
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,growedup,3,Sun Jul 12 20:31:36 2015 UTC,Yay!
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,AntNics,3,Sun Jul 12 02:34:32 2015 UTC,"Nice re-signing, good to see him stay here as he's a very solid player. So this means goodbye Gallo? Him and Lawson could net us a bunch of assets around the deadline if we can unload them."
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,Arrow218,9,Sun Jul 12 02:51:22 2015 UTC,I don't want Gallo to go ):
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Sun Jul 12 02:52:47 2015 UTC,I would cry.
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,teensonacid,3,Sun Jul 12 02:54:22 2015 UTC,Great news. Its been a gooood day
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,Kawnar,2,Sun Jul 12 03:02:52 2015 UTC,I didn't see that coming
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,jibvampxxx,2,Sun Jul 12 04:56:24 2015 UTC,Re-signed lol
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,AlienDeg,2,Sun Jul 12 05:08:03 2015 UTC,I'm happy with that.
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,aatencio91,2,Sun Jul 12 16:05:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think Gallo is going anywhere until the trade deadline.  If Gallo stays healthy and plays well up to the deadline, the Nuggets could trade him away for great assets if he refuses to sign a long term deal here.   If Gallo gets hurt again or plays poorly, he'll probably get sold for cheap and then be amazing on his next team."

denvernuggets,3cz4oy,NUGGman,3,Sun Jul 12 09:47:37 2015 UTC,Silver and black eh? Everybody on the Raiders cares more about money than championships.....
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,aatencio91,2,Sun Jul 12 16:41:53 2015 UTC,"Hey hey hey, not everyone. some of them were drafted by Oakland and are just stuck there."

denvernuggets,3cz4oy,d-lo_tha_boss,2,Sun Jul 12 22:06:45 2015 UTC,Have you seen the contracts that have been given out this FA period? This is a reasonable contract without even factoring in the impending cap jump.   Edit: and if you're referring to him re-upping with us as solely a money grab and that he doesn't have designs on winning a championship then idk what to tell you.
denvernuggets,3cz4oy,aatencio91,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:13:57 2015 UTC,Oh you mean like how Woodson stayed to contend with Green Bay instead of taking the money in Oakland?

denvernuggets,3cx7zn,Dudedo,4,Sat Jul 11 20:06:53 2015 UTC,"Looks pretty good, though I gotta say, a lot of that success was due to the defensive lapses of the Hawks. Dudes were just taking possessions off. But, can/t detract from Mudiay's performance. He is definitely giving a lot of effort, and should improve in the areas where he is weak."
denvernuggets,3cxcu0,growedup,14,Sat Jul 11 16:49:22 2015 UTC,"We did something!!! Barton was the player I was most hopeful we'd re-sign, glad that all worked out."

denvernuggets,3cx6zq,CPage12,3,Sat Jul 11 16:33:22 2015 UTC,I'm so glad to see him stick around.
denvernuggets,3cxiup,Soren292,5,Sat Jul 11 17:42:17 2015 UTC,"I'll be keeping a close eye on him, that's for sure."
denvernuggets,3cxiup,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Sat Jul 11 19:20:48 2015 UTC,"He was always a fan favorite at URI, good to see he's got some buzz. He ran a weekly blog that was always pretty funny found here."
denvernuggets,3cyc96,wigg5202,9,Sat Jul 11 21:59:45 2015 UTC,"Uh he's worth like 2 mil max.  If y'all just let him do him he will be worth ALOT, but all these fuckin number crunchers say don't do a mid range shot which is bs... He is money from the elbow but if you ain't gonna let him do him then he's worth $0.  I hate the position he's in i feel bad for this millionaire for real."
denvernuggets,3cyc96,tlwilson32,2,Sat Jul 11 22:19:27 2015 UTC,It's not B.S. it's math.
denvernuggets,3cyc96,NUGGman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:43:22 2015 UTC,"It's math applied in mass to the entire nba.  There will be outliers and he IS one of them.  Same with Lamarcus Aldrige, are you going to tell him to step back 3 feet and shoot the 3?    Now I'm not saying that DA is as good as LMA but he is in the wheelhouse of players that are better shooting the elbow deuce than the 3.  The nugs coaches actually did ask DA to step back a few feet, he did, and was atrocious.  i sincerely hope the NBA doesn't get to the point of advanced metrics trumping all.  I know that I don't want to watch ""NBA by numbers.""  If it gets that way than I'll go back to Olympic Badminton."
denvernuggets,3cyc96,tlwilson32,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:06:02 2015 UTC,"There are always outliers. Look at Spud Web and Muggsy Bogues; short guys aren't supposed to be able to play basketball, but some do. But far fewer and the law of averages says you are better off going with a taller player, much like you're better off shooting a 3 pointer than a long 2."
denvernuggets,3cyc96,NUGGman,3,Mon Jul 13 00:33:16 2015 UTC,"MLE would definitely cover it. Will Barton just signed a 3 year ~10M deal. Arthur's worth maybe half that imo. He's a stretch 4 type player who made 47.1% of his 2 point FGs, 40/24/78 last year overall. with a 46.6 TS%. Not the greatest #s, and his previous years aren't much better, but he's a decent defender. We're trying to sign him too on account of locker room presence and whatnot."
denvernuggets,3cyc96,with2nns,3,Sat Jul 11 23:34:47 2015 UTC,"D.A is a very good defender. As in very good (http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/DRPM/position/6), unfortunately his offense largely revolves around 18 foot jumpshots, which neglects his value on that end of the floor.  I imagine he could be had for 3million a year as a backup PF"
denvernuggets,3cwc09,TevWool,8,Sat Jul 11 09:15:50 2015 UTC,"Knicks fan here, checked the game out myself. I was extremely surprised at how good he looked, perhaps I forgot because I convinced myself he wasn't when he skipped him, but damn...  Mudiay looks like he's playing the game in slow-mo. He isn't blazing fast but there's something smooth and patient about his movements, he's the stop-and-go type like Paul Pierce. The constant acceleration / de-acceleration freezes up his defenders, which he uses to make plays, it's a beauty to watch.  I'm hoping this whole draft class turns out well!"
denvernuggets,3cwc09,cordlc,5,Sat Jul 11 14:33:11 2015 UTC,"thanks! the pistons have a really good pick in Stanley Johnson too he's at the top of the rookie ladder right now after that summer league performance. kids a stud he went to my high schools basketball rival in California and everyone used to say how great he's gonna be in the league, everyone back home is very excited about him"
denvernuggets,3cwc09,bettycrockerpot,3,Sat Jul 11 09:30:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks, us Nug fans are very excited to have him as well. I was hoping we would have taken Stanley at 7 but Mudiay had to be taken there. Something tells me Johnson will be a stud and Detroit is a good place for him. I believe he'll exceed Winslow as the better player"
denvernuggets,3cwc09,CPage12,3,Sat Jul 11 16:32:47 2015 UTC,"Emmanuel ""FORM A FUCKING WALL"" Mudiay."
denvernuggets,3cwc09,NickCiufi,3,Sat Jul 11 18:01:23 2015 UTC,thanks for stopping by man! I'm pretty excited about SJ too. been saying long before the draft that he was a better prospect than Justise Winslow
denvernuggets,3cwc09,The_NGUYENNER,3,Sat Jul 11 15:27:55 2015 UTC,"Totally off topic, but why did you guys take Johnson over winslow? Do pistons fans support that decision?"
denvernuggets,3cwc09,hayclaylaybaymaysay,3,Sat Jul 11 15:54:17 2015 UTC,"A few things led to it. Johnson worked out with us while Winslow chose not to (I think he didn't expect to fall that far). Also Stan Van liked that SJ was a sure fire Small Forward that fit into his system a little more than a tweener guard/forward. He also has a really good attitude and seems to really want to be a Piston. A lot of Pistons fans were upset on draft night, without ever seeing his game and just riding the Winslow hype. After getting to see him a bit, there's a lot more optimism. Both will be good players, I would have been happy with any of SJ, Winslow or Mudiay. Even I was kind of like ""wtf"" at first but I wouldn't be surprised if Johnson had the better career either."
denvernuggets,3cwc09,JMadFour,2,Sat Jul 11 19:23:33 2015 UTC,That one pass he threw to Lavergne was a thing of beauty.   He knew where the ball was going before he even caught it.
denvernuggets,3cwc09,AntNics,2,Sat Jul 11 16:44:12 2015 UTC,"Awesome post man! I personally think Stanley Johnson is a gonna be an all star in this league. When it came down to Mudiay/Johnson/Winslow at 7 I was very relieved that we were going to get a solid player.   As for Mudiay goes once he gets that jumper knocked down constantly I think he's going to be one of the West's best point guards. So happy we finally have our ""star"" since Melo."
denvernuggets,3cwc09,hotsauce888,2,Sat Jul 11 20:21:44 2015 UTC,"For sure. I like his shot a lot, from what I've seen in the high school circuit, YouTube and yesterday. He's still a little raw but his upside is stupid and he's knocking on the door. He'll have a good season this year, but 3 years from now? Legit"
denvernuggets,3cvr7d,AlienDeg,2,Sat Jul 11 04:31:51 2015 UTC,Jokic's passing was awesome. Has great court vision from way up there. Can't wait for the next game!

denvernuggets,3cvb81,I3IO_HAZARD,8,Sat Jul 11 02:51:59 2015 UTC,Gary Harris needs to build confidance during this tournament. He can attack the rim like Gallo before injury.
denvernuggets,3cvb81,AlienDeg,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:42:27 2015 UTC,His driving is spectacular. Would like to see him knocking down jumpers though.

Harris, Mudiay, Joff, Jokic - all showed good things today, and I'm glad they're all getting used to playing with one another right away."
denvernuggets,3cvb81,d-lo_tha_boss,5,Sat Jul 11 02:37:12 2015 UTC,Denver Nuggets played really good team defence throughout the whole game. Coaching staff have been doing a good job

denvernuggets,3cvb81,bettycrockerpot,5,Sat Jul 11 02:00:52 2015 UTC,His vision is really impressive. Can't wait to see him with Nurk.
denvernuggets,3cvb81,corybyu,4,Sat Jul 11 02:01:27 2015 UTC,"Seriously we have two bigs with good vision, and one who can shoot from range, the other has great hands and good post moves.  I'm excited for the future."

denvernuggets,3cvb81,JMadFour,7,Sat Jul 11 02:30:36 2015 UTC,"We were in control (score wise) for most of the game. In terms of how our players did: - Green had a very solid game. - Harris played very well both offensively and on D. He looks much improved (it is only summer league however.) Played with confidence.  - Mudiay started the game out strong with a nice driving layup and a fadaway. He didn't shoot well during the game but had amazing composure and very crisp passing. Looks like the real deal. One thing to note he looks like a really solid rebounder as well, also had a nice and 1. - Jokic to me in the beginning didn't look all that great at the start of the game but got more comfortable as it went a long and settled with a solid game. Has really good passing for a big, plus a nice shooting stroke.  I know I missed a couple of other key players but there's a lot of reason to be excited IMO even if it is just summer league. Malone was also there seeing the guys first hand in a game."
denvernuggets,3cvb81,AlienDeg,3,Sat Jul 11 02:45:00 2015 UTC,Is there someplace i can watch a replay? I work nights so i missed it.

denvernuggets,3cup0t,corybyu,4,Sat Jul 11 00:48:01 2015 UTC,Does Erick Green Make the team?
denvernuggets,3cup0t,AlienDeg,2,Sat Jul 11 01:13:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah he'll be on the roster, as far as the rotation goes i'm not entirely sure if he'll crack it"
denvernuggets,3cup0t,teensonacid,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:16:06 2015 UTC,I say yes
denvernuggets,3cup0t,Tskitishvili,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:15:11 2015 UTC,"I personally hope so, he showed flashes of talent last season. He can shoot, just needs to work on a consistent J"
denvernuggets,3cup0t,Tskitishvili,5,Sat Jul 11 02:25:27 2015 UTC,loving Jof ... that hair...son
denvernuggets,3cup0t,teensonacid,5,Sat Jul 11 01:19:16 2015 UTC,3OKIC!!! Finally we made one.
denvernuggets,3cup0t,growedup,5,Sat Jul 11 01:29:20 2015 UTC,Dat dunk doe
denvernuggets,3cup0t,CPage12,4,Sat Jul 11 01:35:28 2015 UTC,"man I like this guy so far, maybe we can give him a shot?  He can have JJ's spot"
denvernuggets,3cup0t,CPage12,3,Sat Jul 11 01:36:20 2015 UTC,Felt that one all the way back in Lithuania
denvernuggets,3cup0t,trentyz,5,Sat Jul 11 01:36:11 2015 UTC,"Overall great game, excited to see Mudiay have a decent start, Harris and Green look better than last year, and Jokic has a lot of potential.  That big guy (Biruta?) really impressed me too, seems to have a lot of fight in him."
denvernuggets,3cup0t,teensonacid,4,Sat Jul 11 01:57:58 2015 UTC,"Mudiay, Harris, Green, Biruta, Franklin and Clark all looked really good. Jokic, JoLo and Broekoff all impressed as well."
denvernuggets,3cup0t,bo0ompow,2,Sat Jul 11 02:00:01 2015 UTC,"How was Joff, I didn't see much since I only caught the second half?    As for Broekhoff he seemed to make a lot of mistakes before the three I saw him hit, but maybe he was better in the first half?"
denvernuggets,3cup0t,teensonacid,2,Sat Jul 11 02:33:56 2015 UTC,"Joffrey looked like Joffrey. Blocking out and making space, finished well at the hoop, but not much explosiveness."
denvernuggets,3cup0t,teensonacid,2,Sat Jul 11 02:39:11 2015 UTC,"yep, he was a little bit overhyped before joining nuggets. I warned you guys."
denvernuggets,3cup0t,teensonacid,3,Sat Jul 11 03:37:46 2015 UTC,HELL YES!!! it might only be summer league but i'm psyched! looking for streams right now...i may actually be forced to fork out for league pass  edit! got a stream here i think
denvernuggets,3cup0t,teensonacid,3,Fri Jul 10 23:37:36 2015 UTC,I'm expecting us to do well this summer league. Gary Harris and Mudiay should be able to lock down opposing backcourts. I can't wait to actually see Jokic in live action.
denvernuggets,3cup0t,teensonacid,3,Fri Jul 10 23:40:43 2015 UTC,MUDIAY IS LEGIT!!!
denvernuggets,3cup0t,Tskitishvili,3,Sat Jul 11 00:15:10 2015 UTC,VISION!!!
denvernuggets,3cup0t,Draxlar,3,Sat Jul 11 00:15:17 2015 UTC,That's a tall point guard!
denvernuggets,3cup0t,teensonacid,3,Sat Jul 11 00:16:09 2015 UTC,Harris just seems unlucky man. Jokic also looks a little slow out there
denvernuggets,3cup0t,teensonacid,2,Sat Jul 11 00:19:15 2015 UTC,Not too surprised about Jokic. Steve Hess is going to shape him into a granite Adonis.
denvernuggets,3cup0t,The_Super_Deer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:22:10 2015 UTC,"For sure, have a lot of faith in Hess"

denvernuggets,3cup0t,CPage12,3,Sat Jul 11 02:24:23 2015 UTC,Malone is watching like a hawk
denvernuggets,3cup0t,corybyu,3,Sat Jul 11 00:22:47 2015 UTC,Green should be stylin on these kids.
denvernuggets,3cup0t,The_Super_Deer,2,Sat Jul 11 00:26:00 2015 UTC,right? i wonder if he's ever going to make the jump to starter level
denvernuggets,3cup0t,CPage12,3,Sat Jul 11 00:28:33 2015 UTC,"Biruta on D looking good, not drawing fouls when they drive at him. Green trying hard to get to the bucket right now, not complaining."
denvernuggets,3cup0t,teensonacid,3,Sat Jul 11 00:28:22 2015 UTC,Broekhoff!!!
denvernuggets,3cup0t,teensonacid,3,Sat Jul 11 00:28:53 2015 UTC,get em son!
denvernuggets,3cup0t,CPage12,3,Sat Jul 11 00:28:59 2015 UTC,too long no Mudi..get him back in coach...Green gettin wet too
denvernuggets,3cup0t,The_Super_Deer,3,Sat Jul 11 00:29:39 2015 UTC,Nuggets are 0-5 6 from the 3 line so far.
denvernuggets,3cup0t,CPage12,3,Sat Jul 11 00:34:55 2015 UTC,HUSTLE
denvernuggets,3cup0t,teensonacid,3,Sat Jul 11 00:36:40 2015 UTC,THAT CROSS COURT PASS
denvernuggets,3cup0t,CPage12,3,Sat Jul 11 00:39:20 2015 UTC,Harris looking good attacking the rim
denvernuggets,3cup0t,AntNics,3,Sat Jul 11 00:39:40 2015 UTC,Can't find a game thread on r/nba
denvernuggets,3cup0t,Tskitishvili,6,Sat Jul 11 00:39:50 2015 UTC,don't even worry bout it..stay here homie
denvernuggets,3cup0t,broncoboots12,2,Sat Jul 11 00:41:10 2015 UTC,"There isn't one yet. I would normally post it at the same time as this one, but I was still on a plane. By the time I got home there still wasn't one, so I figured it wasn't worth it this time."
denvernuggets,3cup0t,teensonacid,3,Sat Jul 11 00:40:19 2015 UTC,MUDI!
denvernuggets,3cup0t,CPage12,3,Sat Jul 11 00:44:43 2015 UTC,Man this dude tall as fuck wtf
denvernuggets,3cup0t,teensonacid,3,Sat Jul 11 01:08:07 2015 UTC,jokic has some good vision
denvernuggets,3cup0t,teensonacid,3,Sat Jul 11 01:11:11 2015 UTC,Harris looking so confident. I love it!
denvernuggets,3cup0t,The_Super_Deer,3,Sat Jul 11 01:19:53 2015 UTC,"Harris is supposed to be a shooter, can't tell from this game he just keeps attacking the rim relentlessly. Doing a real solid job finishing while he's there too"
denvernuggets,3cup0t,teensonacid,3,Sat Jul 11 01:22:34 2015 UTC,Nice play Mudiay to Jokic!  Good to see that vision and playmaking ability from Mudiay.
denvernuggets,3cup0t,teensonacid,3,Sat Jul 11 01:25:33 2015 UTC,"Somebody call the national guard, we're killing them!"
denvernuggets,3cup0t,teensonacid,3,Sat Jul 11 01:25:52 2015 UTC,"Jokic triple, finally"
denvernuggets,3cup0t,The_Super_Deer,3,Sat Jul 11 01:29:49 2015 UTC,WET
denvernuggets,3cup0t,CPage12,3,Sat Jul 11 01:30:29 2015 UTC,so how do we like Mudiay? once he gets a few more games under his belt i think he's going to exceed all our expectations
denvernuggets,3cup0t,AlienDeg,3,Sat Jul 11 01:33:40 2015 UTC,"Really liking his game so far. Shot needs work, but that will come."
denvernuggets,3cup0t,CPage12,2,Sat Jul 11 01:35:06 2015 UTC,"Jumper needs work, maybe cut down on the turnovers a bit as well. Also needs to work on fighting through screens from what I saw. All in all, im excited to have him on the team. Solid play-making and ability to get in the paint and finish."
denvernuggets,3cup0t,AlienDeg,3,Sat Jul 11 01:35:06 2015 UTC,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
denvernuggets,3cup0t,teensonacid,3,Sat Jul 11 01:35:25 2015 UTC,lol broekhoff's reaction

denvernuggets,3cup0t,Tskitishvili,3,Sat Jul 11 01:36:14 2015 UTC,"Damn Omic, GET UP"
denvernuggets,3cup0t,CPage12,3,Sat Jul 11 01:45:34 2015 UTC,Man I am LOVING Mudiay. Great shots so far and a nice asset.
denvernuggets,3cup0t,CPage12,2,Sat Jul 11 00:19:12 2015 UTC,So if Randy Foye is not waived tomorrow his contract is guaranteed for next season. What do you think we should do with him?
denvernuggets,3cup0t,Draxlar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:57:32 2015 UTC,I say we waive him. I believe Harris and Barton will suffice at the two spot.
denvernuggets,3cup0t,teensonacid,2,Sat Jul 11 00:35:34 2015 UTC,STREAM SORTED!!
denvernuggets,3cup0t,CPage12,2,Sat Jul 11 00:00:16 2015 UTC,Jokic has got me pretty pumped for this. Mudiay as well of course

denvernuggets,3cvkl2,hotsauce888,13,Sun Jul 12 20:55:27 2015 UTC,Honestly it seems like he's trying his damnedest to get traded. He didn't need to say this.
denvernuggets,3cvkl2,teensonacid,4,Sat Jul 11 03:26:29 2015 UTC,Stay off social media Ty for fuck sake
denvernuggets,3cvkl2,IdRatherBeLurking,14,Sat Jul 11 09:19:37 2015 UTC,Or maybe he just missed the game and was wondering how we did...
denvernuggets,3cvkl2,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Sat Jul 11 03:33:13 2015 UTC,"Why not text with the coach or some of the new players, why end the first preposition with an ellipses? I don't think he just missed the game and was wondering how we did. I could be wrong but, that just wouldn't make a lot of sense to me."
denvernuggets,3cvkl2,IdRatherBeLurking,9,Sat Jul 11 03:38:26 2015 UTC,Ty is known to enjoy talking with his fans.
denvernuggets,3cvkl2,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Sat Jul 11 03:52:38 2015 UTC,"The supposed leader of the team saying he missed the first summer league game isn't an attempt at talking with fans, not to me at least."
denvernuggets,3cvkl2,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Sat Jul 11 04:40:59 2015 UTC,"Who still calls him the leader?   That's your interpretation, which I respect."
denvernuggets,3cvkl2,NUGGman,4,Sat Jul 11 04:46:09 2015 UTC,"He's SUPPOSED to be the leader, is what I'm saying. Your point guard needs to be a leader on the court for your team to have any success and that naturally should or does transfer over to the locker room. Whether or not he is the leader (he doesn't seem to be) isn't really the point."
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,I3IO_HAZARD,9,Fri Jul 10 20:02:25 2015 UTC,"I personally love the yellow. I'd love to wear yellow on the road.  I really like this logo, too (notice the flair) but it's too simplistic. The Nuggets need something to make the brand recognizable, and I think it needs to be different. As you already pointed out, it looks like the Hawks, Raptors, and Nets logos."
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,aatencio91,2,Fri Jul 10 20:16:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right, too many teams already have their logos centered around a basketball and they all look really similar. We can the circular logo as our secondary and make the skyline with a updated color scheme our main logo"
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,growedup,5,Fri Jul 10 20:40:10 2015 UTC,It should be noted that at least one logo must feature a basketball. Thems the rules.
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,lwal,2,Fri Jul 10 21:27:25 2015 UTC,Wait so how does that work with the Bulls?
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,growedup,2,Sat Jul 11 01:15:16 2015 UTC,Perhaps the rule I am referencing is only for rebranding or something.
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,lwal,2,Sat Jul 11 01:17:53 2015 UTC,Ahh yeah that would make sense
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,aatencio91,3,Sat Jul 11 01:21:15 2015 UTC,"I know we don't need super detailed logos on uniforms and that would end up looking bad, but would it be awful if they didn't have the blocky style to the buildings? Like if they looked more like Denver's actual skyline?"
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,AlienDeg,5,Fri Jul 10 20:43:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, I love the rainbow logo but it looks like a game of tetris. Making the buildings realistic like this fanmade Dallas Mavericks jersey would be very cool"
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,OilSheikh,3,Fri Jul 10 20:49:55 2015 UTC,I love this skyline scheme.
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,followthelawson,9,Fri Jul 10 20:56:46 2015 UTC,I love this concept by macalesterscots on Chris Creamer's forum.  Original thread: http://boards.sportslogos.net/topic/101902-nba-redesign-new-presentation;-portland-added/page-3?hl=%2Bdenver+%2Bnuggets#entry2383933
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,aatencio91,2,Fri Jul 10 22:35:55 2015 UTC,Fuck those are nice
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,Tskitishvili,4,Sat Jul 11 02:51:31 2015 UTC,"Let me start with those are really cool. Love them.   But here's what I'd like to see, and it'll never happen but I can dream. I want to (shudder) copy the Lakers and not wear white except for special occasions. Let's wear colors at home. Our colors are blue and yellow. Let's rock the hell out of them. Let's have the entire crowd doing the same.   It's one thing I hate about basketball at all levels that football does right. I love going to Broncos games where the players are wearing orange and so is the crowd. We're United in Orange. So fun.   Wearing a white jersey at home is foolish, especially when like 99% of Nuggets merchandise is in blue or yellow. Let's get the guys on the court in blue or yellow, and let's get the crowd in the same color."
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,BlindManBaldwin,5,Fri Jul 10 21:09:29 2015 UTC,"We're United in Orange   YES. I'd love for the Pepsi Center to be glowing with yellow. The team is named after gold nuggets, why shouldn't the uniform be, you know, GOLD?"
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,rexgal,2,Fri Jul 10 21:18:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right, I always found the NBA tradition of wearing white at home a little outdated  Wearing a non-white jersey at home would do better to unify the crowd. I'm not going to lie, I was a little bit jelly of Golden State's crowd all decked out in yellow and looking so cool.   But then again literally the only team not do this is the Lakers, every other team wears white at home, so I don't know if it's happening any time soon"
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,jdub1418,4,Fri Jul 10 21:21:24 2015 UTC,"I made this the other day. Could be improved, but is along the lines of what I think a new logo/design could be like. All I did was take the skyline out, move the ""Denver Nuggets"" words into the logo and add the snow caps from our current logo. I think we have had good enough logos and color schemes where we could recycle them and create a really nice new logo."
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,aatencio91,5,Fri Jul 10 21:45:38 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think we need a late 90s broncos tier redesign. Completely new logo, uniform, and color scheme."
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,ksv4292,4,Fri Jul 10 22:32:22 2015 UTC,I personally love the old ABA cartoon digger guy logo (don't know what its called). I think they would be a really popular jersey in the current nba.
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,MisterSeaCucumber,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:36:08 2015 UTC,"Maxie the Miner! It's such a classic logo, wish the Nuggets would find a way to incorporate him into the overall scheme somehow"
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,esteban42,3,Sat Jul 11 01:42:52 2015 UTC,"I really wish our secondary logo would become our primary, other than that the jersey scheme you suggested at the end is my favorite"
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,rexgal,3,Fri Jul 10 21:16:54 2015 UTC,Hopefully when Nike comes in 2017 they shake things up. Nike is usually pretty good at new designing jerseys and logos. I personally love what they do withe Oregon Ducks football jerseys every year.
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,JMadFour,2,Fri Jul 10 21:54:47 2015 UTC,"Nike gave the CU football team a bit of an update this year, too. They've got some really sweet looking alternates."
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,127crazie,5,Sat Jul 11 14:36:22 2015 UTC,I've been trying to get a graphic design job with the nuggets...I've got so many new ideas.
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,AlienDeg,4,Fri Jul 10 20:15:54 2015 UTC,"Those jersey mockups are fucking dope, I would love that. Honestly I would really like it if the circular one was the main logo and then the secondary was Maxie the Miner, sorta like how the Sixers have their new circular logo and then baller Ben Franklin."
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,aatencio91,2,Fri Jul 10 20:23:33 2015 UTC,"I hate the Yellow unis. It feels like we are trying to be the lakers, and I hate the lakers."
denvernuggets,3cu3nj,pm326,2,Fri Jul 10 22:31:18 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/VHCEJaG I came up with this new jersey idea a few minutes ago with kind of a new ""retro-ish"" colour scheme i thought of.. I guess kinda similar to the  miami dolphins... shit.. well whatever. Anyways let me know what you guys think! Obviously I'm not a photoshop wiz haha but I did my best..."
denvernuggets,3cvaqc,TreBoyz,2,Sat Jul 11 01:52:44 2015 UTC,"-More Depth  The only position I feel relatively comfortable with is small forward...and that's assuming everybody stays healthy. We could definitely use some help at pretty much every other position.   How to solve this: Get some valuable trades for Ty Lawson and maybe even Faried. Build up young talent  -Get better defensively  Hiring a defensively minded coach like Mike Malone was a good start, but Denver was one of the worst teams in the league in opponent points per game.  How to solve this: This isn't really something that can be fixed immediately but I'm sure Mike Malone will bring his defensive minded schemes into Denver, all it will take is some time to get used to it.   -Allow young talent to flourish   I see a lot of potential in young guys like Mudiay, Nurkic, and Green. There is a chance that they can become good if not great.  How to solve this: Be patient and play them more I guess"
denvernuggets,3cvaqc,I3IO_HAZARD,0,Sat Jul 11 03:13:29 2015 UTC,"We have to run. It stinks that Lawson wants out. We need Faried for this reason. Trade Lawson for picks, suffer this year, better in two years."
denvernuggets,3cu5e5,AlienDeg,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:15:37 2015 UTC,"He would be a really great fit for them but I'm not sure what they'd have to offer us. CJ Wilcox is interesting, but I think more than likely it'd be a future 2nd round pick or two."

denvernuggets,3cvyv4,looktheresafox,2,Sat Jul 11 06:52:22 2015 UTC,I know the NBA is the last league to go to the camo jerseys. The other two leagues have found a way to support out troops make more money by selling more memorabilia. My camo social experiment  I wanted to see how many fans would like this. because even tho i designed it i don't like the camo

denvernuggets,3cqn18,ParadeShitter,9,Fri Jul 10 00:17:39 2015 UTC,"exactly, and last year proved he still wouldn't do that"

Guy was cheering on teammates, legitimately tied and put in effort every game he played.  Man for Billups to say that though, especially as Ty was his understudy, holds a lot of credence even though us here already knew the obvious."
denvernuggets,3cqn18,I3IO_HAZARD,22,Fri Jul 10 23:15:49 2015 UTC,Chauncey pretty much saying what's on every Nuggets fans mind

denvernuggets,3cqn18,phatlever,4,Fri Jul 10 12:56:52 2015 UTC,"Hahah I've never seen that flair before, that's great.    I assure you Connely wants him traded just as bad as you, but we CANNOT give him away for peanuts.  Wait till the season starts and a PG gets injured or a surprise team takes a leap and needs one more piece.  It's not in the Nugs best interest to rush this move."

The problem there is that we (the Nuggets FO) might think he's worth a lot more than his street value and therefore won't be able to move him.  It's almost certain that he won't mentor Mudiay or help develop him.  So what do we do with the guy?    Oh, and no worries about rushing.  The Nuggz are never in a rush to do anything.  I've only seen them make one fast transaction in the history of ever, and it was bringing Allen Iverson to Denver when Melo got suspended for sucker slapping Mardy Collins.  Man, I miss the days of the Thuggets.  We could sure use an identity like that these days.  Kmart, AI, Birdman, JR Smith...Even Melo.  All Tatted up and ready to defend.  Now we're a nameless, tattooless (Ill Will being the exception), faceless crop of euros with an immature leader who's stock is plummeting with every social media blunder."
denvernuggets,3cqn18,manimalplanet35,2,Fri Jul 10 16:30:15 2015 UTC,"Well... The AI transaction wasn't THAT fast.  They had been rumored to be trying to trade for him since at least the trade deadline from the previous season.  The Melo suspension just put some pressure on the Nuggets to finally pull the trigger.    I agree with you though.  This team has no identity.  The Thuggets were a lot of fun to watch.  As far as Lawson and Chauncey, all you really need to look at is what the team was when he was here - a contender.  With Lawson, they will always be an also-ran fighting for a bottom seed or stuck as a lottery team."

denvernuggets,3crlf4,The_NGUYENNER,2,Fri Jul 10 06:25:32 2015 UTC,Yep. I think we need 2-3 (probably 4) years to start winning. To this point Nuggets can be Las Vegas Bucks or Baltimore Wires.
denvernuggets,3crlf4,IdRatherBeLurking,14,Fri Jul 10 06:33:41 2015 UTC,"I think this all stems back to the playoffs in 11-12 and 12-13. We were beat in seven games both times by teams that handed out matching shirts to their fanbases for every game. I can't describe how pissed I was that KSE couldn't drop the cash on some cool, unifying, and symbolic t shirts. It would have gone a long way in creating the community feeling that OKC and GSW have. Instead we just looked like cheap chumps."
denvernuggets,3crlf4,teensonacid,8,Fri Jul 10 13:09:52 2015 UTC,huge call. i completely agree. that solidifying unity on home court would have been amazing not just for us fans but the team as well

denvernuggets,3crlf4,OkAutopilot,10,Fri Jul 10 15:49:29 2015 UTC,"I think the Nuggets could stand a soft rebranding. I don't like the Nuggets font on our current logo. I think that despite having one of the best uniform combos for colors (baby blue and yellow) we're totally underwhelming with it. Our yellow skyline jerseys are way better than our current home/away jerseys.   Bring back or redo the skyline jerseys as our main jerseys and bring back Maxie the Miner for our alternates. Something like this but with the logo centered and a Nuggets font/styling underneath?  You definitely don't have to worry about the Nuggets being moved anywhere but I agree, we're totally underwhelming from a social media standpoint and our fans aren't particularly raucous. To be fair though, that all changes when you're contending."
denvernuggets,3crlf4,teensonacid,4,Fri Jul 10 06:47:56 2015 UTC,"ah man don't get me started on our branding. our typeface has been this condensed, bold typeface for so long, it's just cartoonish now. it's lost all elements of sports branding. there's nothing unique about it whatsoever. it's just the letters typed out. i swear, i need to put a weekend in and submit some designs to the Nuggets FO and see if we can sort this shit out"
denvernuggets,3crlf4,aatencio91,2,Fri Jul 10 13:49:10 2015 UTC,"Our yellow skyline jerseys are way better than our current home/away jerseys.    I guess the Lakers might have the corner on the yellow jersey market, but if the Nuggets had something brighter and more eye catching, like their yellow jerseys, it'd be a step in the right direction. The Broncos and their construction cone orange are recognizable around the NFL, for example."
denvernuggets,3crlf4,utw,2,Fri Jul 10 16:28:20 2015 UTC,"We could definitely go for a rebrand. Other than a couple of color changes we've had our logo over 20 years. That's great if it's iconic, but I can't say that about ours. Especially since I still associate it with those awful 90s teams.   Besides it's practically not even our main logo anymore since we use the circular alternate more now. We just don't want to pay to make the circular one official or create an entirely new one.  As for the baby blue I'm not much of a fan. I think it's overstayed its welcome. Especially its prominence in our road jersey. I'm all for emphasizing the darker blue more. And though I may be the only one, if we changed from blue, I think a light grey would be the way to go. It would look great with yellow and make us stand out. I don't believe any other team uses grey right now except in the Spurs' alternate jerseys. But I know some are averse to blacks and greys.  About jerseys, I keep waiting for us to switch to blue and white skyline jerseys and it keeps not happening like I think it will. Maybe it's just wishful thinking, though, since as a whole the road/home jerseys are tired to me. Doing so would at least rejuvenate the entire look for a time.  And I'm all for bringing back Maxie in some form. If not skylines across the board, I'd be in favor of the sharp jerseys we had at the time of Maxie. Those late 70s jerseys are a close second for me."

The Broncos started it after they signed Peyton Manning, so they already had national attention, but the whole ""United in Orange"" thing really took off with the fans.   The Nuggets could totally turn around quick in terms of fan support if Mudiay pans out, and if Jokic is good that's even better. If KSE can strike while the iron is hot and come up with some catchy campaign slogan while people are excited about Mudiay, they can take a huge step in the right direction."

That being said I understand where you're coming from, we should be hyping. I'm not sure I agree with that right now though. We're in a unique position in that we're not being talked about, we had some Kings/Cousins/Karl bs floating around we all got excited about but really, we are who we are. so we work on that. and with Coach Malone i think we work harder on THAT than ever before.

This is Tim Connelly's final year of his contract so it's really in his interest to put together a good team and have a crack at the regular season.  Furthermore, what sort of impression does that give to Mudiay about his new team, when he's spoken about nothing but winning and championships..."
denvernuggets,3cqy2a,pairidaeza,2,Fri Jul 10 02:49:13 2015 UTC,"""i'm all about hard work"". ""i'm all about team basketball"". ""i'm all about winning"". ""i'm all about the championships"". ""i'm all about doing what coach wants"".... they all say the same stuff. the team shouldn't be worried about mudiay says after his rookie season, they should be worried about what he says when it's time to sign another contract."
denvernuggets,3cqy2a,ParadeShitter,4,Fri Jul 10 02:52:48 2015 UTC,"Fair point. I do think the Knicks will be awful this season, unless Porzingis really hits the ground running. But I don't think he's NBA-ready just yet."

I'm so worried that he'll be awesome and won't entertain offers to stay in Denver. I've always heard from Scott Hastings and others on 104.3 that the Nuggets can't sign FA's because no one thinks Denver is anything more than a cow-town, so having an exciting young prospect makes me worried that I'll ""fall in love with him"" and then he'll be going away in 4 years. I know that's looking too far ahead, but it makes me uneasy at the same time."
denvernuggets,3cqy2a,aatencio91,3,Fri Jul 10 16:34:40 2015 UTC,"idk, I really really want Simmons.  If both us and the Knicks are bottom 5-7ish teams, our chances would be very very good."
denvernuggets,3cqy2a,followthelawson,0,Fri Jul 10 03:30:52 2015 UTC,it will improve our chances slightly but i don't think it's really worth gutting our team for a chance to pick between two 4-7 picks. I'd rather have the one pick and the assets to make a good trade
denvernuggets,3cqy2a,tron777,3,Fri Jul 10 08:43:09 2015 UTC,"Here's the problem, the Knicks have no motivation to suck. They know they won't get their pick so they are going to try and win all year. I think our best chance for a top pick comes if Melo either doesn't come back healthy or he wakes up one morning, looks around, and realilzes he wants to be somewhere else because the team is awful. It seems most likely that the Knick's pick ends up somewhere around 10. A few of those teams you mention are going to be 10-20 by Christmas (by injury, mismanagement, or luck) and realize it's time to go the other way.  I don't see a way this team makes the playoffs, even in the weak sister East. They won't be able to stop anybody. Robin Lopez is good but he's never carried a defense by himself and the rest of the big minute guys are miserable defenders. Fisher will have to be a defensive genius to get this team in the top half, defensively. On the other side of the ball, Melo is going to have to carry a huge load for this team to be any good, and even then Melo has never been the most efficient scorer.  The last time Melo lead a good offense he had loads and loads of shooters to help carry the efficiency burden. He's down to two shooters now and has a GM that doesn't believe in threes and wants the team to run triangle. How fast do you think a bunch of strangers can master the triangle? Again, Fisher is going to have to be a genius to get this team in the top half of the league, offensively.   As for the Nuggets, it's too late to tank properly. If we wanted to gut the roster, the time was at the draft. With free agency wrapping up most teams don't have cap space to trade players into meaning that we would need to take players back with any draft picks we would acquire. It could still be done but I think the best best time has passed. Might as well go for it now.  I've mentioned it before but, as a fan, I LOVE pick swaps or owning another team's draft pick. We should do this every year."
denvernuggets,3cqy2a,AlienDeg,0,Fri Jul 10 13:44:12 2015 UTC,"I agree that they have no motivation to suck, but i think they will suck regardless.

The knicks roster needed to big changed to improve on their 17-65.   The kicks lost Shumpurt, J.R Smith, tim hardaway Jr., bargnarni (only played 22gms) , Dalembert (only played 22gms), and will probably lose quincy acy from that season.   The knicks gained Robin Lopez, AAA, O'Quinn, and derrick favours, drafted porzinis (project) and grant (probably can contribute right away).    Thats 2 'average' starters, and 2 bench players.  This knicks still haven't sorted out their depth issue, in fact they have less depth than before."

Lopez, AAA, and Grant are all probably upgrades at their position so it's possible they could be significantly better.  BUT teams also take a while to gel so I really hope chemistry is an issue this year.    As for teams that I could see being worse than NY:  Boston, Nets, Detroit, Philly, Charlotte, Kings, Lakers, Mavs, Portland, Nuggets.  I understand your argument that these teams will be better, but I think they're all kind of in the same boat and it's really a crapshoot."

Even if Lopez, AAA, and grant are upgrades for the knicks next season, how many more wins do you think that would generate for the wins compared to last season (17 wins last year)  I really can't see the knicks getting any higher than 27 wins next season, and the only teams you have mentioned that I think could fall to that level would be Portland, Lakers, and Nets. Boston had 40 wins last year, Detroit, Charlotte, Kings have all improved, and Mavs won't fall that low."

This team is and should be rebuilding anyway. This isn't MLB/NFL. If you aren't top 5 in talent you're guaranteed to be going home in the First or Second round.

Lack of injuries, I'd say our ceiling is 45-48 wins, a good +10 wins off Shaw's first year. That or we'll experience major hangover, will be unable to ""get it"", our young players will have trouble, Lawson will be a distraction, etc. in which case we bottom out and become one of the five worst, again similar to last year.   Reality is somewhere in the middle especially since I don't think we'll make it through with this same roster, not that many of us do."

denvernuggets,3clfdg,thedarknessmonster,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:20:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, this year could either go really well (ie playoffs) or terribly (ie bottom 2-3 in the conference with injuries...). I'm hoping Mudiay starts his career off strong and we keep Ty/Faried. It really depends how the team reacts to Malone - I thought we'd do pretty well in 2013-14 but Shaw (among other factors) didn't have the power to take the team where I was hoping.   I just think we should up the tempo, keep our core and develop our youngins if things go badly!"
denvernuggets,3clfdg,trentyz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:54:18 2015 UTC,"The problem is who are the teams we are supposed to beat?  We did pretty much nothing to improve through free agency.  We drafted a rough around the edges player that Ty is not going to take under his wing and help him develop.  As of right now, there are two ""worst"" teams in the power rankings than us.  I was at the last game we played against the 76ers.  We have nobody to match their sheer height and athleticism inside.  And the Wolves just got the #1 pick and re-signed KG.  Are we supposed to beat them?  Would it surprise anyone if we didn't?  Everyone else in the West has improved.  While we sit idly by, hoping our coach with a losing record thus far can turn around our fortunes and make our divas not quit like they did on our last coach.    Optimistically, If we get a leader and if Mudiay pans out, Gallo stays healthy, Manimal rediscovers himself and becomes the Team USA Manimal, Nurkic stops being a bull in a china shop and stops getting into early and often foul trouble and develops some fundamentals, our other raw Euros (Jokic and Lauvergne) develop into above average talent, and Malone can get everyone on the same page, we start sinking free throws and playing defense...  We might be good for 40 wins.  That's a big fat if.    Realistically, if we stay on this path of doing nothing, we are going to be last place in the West, looking up at our 30 win previous season."

denvernuggets,3cki9k,chucho320,16,Wed Jul 8 16:54:52 2015 UTC,"Here's the text, because fuck slideshows.    #28  The Denver Nuggets have largely kept quiet through the start of free agency. Per ESPN.com, they've registered cursory interest in Monta Ellis (who signed with the Pacers)...and that's about it.  According to the Denver Post's Christopher Dempsey, the Nuggets would like to retain Jameer Nelson, Will Barton and Darrell Arthur, all of whom played in Denver last season. Beyond that, the team doesn't have much in the way of cap space with which to attract a major addition.  And frankly, as far as the state of the franchise is concerned, the Nuggets are in no position to make a splash at this point anyway. If there's anything this year's free-agency period has made clear, it's that players in their prime aren't inclined to latch on with losing teams, especially ones as in flux.  That doesn't mean the Nuggets won't be active this summer. If anything, Denver should get more involved once the free-agent market dies down. At that point, the Nuggets will have a better idea of which teams are interested in the likes of Ty Lawson, Kenneth Faried, Wilson Chandler and Danilo Gallinari—not to mention a clearer picture of what the team can bring back in trade for its more attractive chips."

Given the money flying around in the last week it's almost a certainty that someone would have offered Faried a max offer if he had made it to restricted free agency.
denvernuggets,3cgueq,tron777,8,Tue Jul 7 20:53:44 2015 UTC,I'm ok with his contract now. All i want him to be is Rodman 2.0 on the boards. Forget shooting just get the ball and kick it out to reset.
denvernuggets,3cgueq,teensonacid,5,Tue Jul 7 21:34:37 2015 UTC,"Faried has consistently been one of the most efficient players on the team, he doesn't need to pass up put back opportunities."
denvernuggets,3cgueq,tron777,3,Tue Jul 7 21:43:35 2015 UTC,"that's true, but if the easy look isn't there, or if he has to move for the baby hook most of the time i'd rather see him kick it out."
denvernuggets,3cgueq,teensonacid,3,Tue Jul 7 22:09:06 2015 UTC,"We all knew this was coming, but it simply didn't feel possible until now. As long as he's willing to dominate off the bench, I'm completely okay with keeping him."
denvernuggets,3cgueq,IdRatherBeLurking,11,Tue Jul 7 21:23:35 2015 UTC,"Faried will be our starting PF until someone else earns/forces their way into the starting lineup. We'll be playing plenty of Gallo at the 4 I'm sure, and maybe some Faried at center but I think we start with Ty,Chandler, Gallo, Faried, Nurkic.  I think this Faried off the bench stuff is premature. If anyone is in danger out of that group it's probably Chandler in favor of Mudiay."
denvernuggets,3cgueq,tron777,5,Tue Jul 7 21:40:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a slight against Faried to have him come off the bench. He destroys 2nd lines, and I think we'd be much better off starting Foye, Barton or Harris at the 2, with Chandler at the 3, Gallo at the 4, and Nurk at the 5.   His ego is the only thing stopping him from succeeding with ""starting minutes"" from the bench. That's where he's been the most successful for us in the past, and that's where he'll see success in the future, methinks."
denvernuggets,3cgueq,IdRatherBeLurking,7,Tue Jul 7 23:09:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good players tend to destroy second units but that doesn't mean it's best to play them off the bench. If you look at where Faried has struggled, I'd say it's when he's playing next to Hickson. The best place for Faried is next to a true center and our only one of those is Nurk, who's in the starting lineup.   And it's not just his pride, it's his pocketbook. Good luck making the all star game as a bench player. Good luck getting your next big contract playing off the bench. Players see it as a slight if they go from starting to sitting on the bench because it costs them money. We just got done with Faried hating a new coach, do we really want to start off on this foot?"

denvernuggets,3cgueq,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:53:22 2015 UTC,"The thinking about Faried coming off the bench is backwards thinking. Yes, it would be great if he was coming off the bench because we had better players. But without those better players, it's like thinking we would have been better with Iguodala coming off the bench, since GS had the best record in the NBA doing that. But the difference is they are doing it because they have several great players, where it's hard to start everyone who deserves it. We don't have that problem."

denvernuggets,3cgueq,IdRatherBeLurking,7,Fri Jul 10 17:31:15 2015 UTC,"To be honset, I still am holding onto the hope that Faried can be a star on our team. I still beleive he can be and i think it would be sooooo dumb to trade him, especially considering the amount of years left we have him on his cheap contract.  When Shaw was coach, we saw a complete change in faried. faried was encouraged to incorporate a post up game into his repertoire, and faried sucked at it. He is 6'7, even though he is incredibly strong for his size, he is more wirey than bulk. The post up game just doesn't suite his frame, and at the same time he wasn't in the best position to be effective as a hustle rebounder.   Faried was dominant in my opinion when he was focused on rebounding, hustling, and focused on making good basketball plays, not hiding in the post looking for a post up. Even though he isn't the most offensively skilled big man, faried would DOMINATE some games offensively and defensively just through pure will power.   I still think that if Faried improved his jump shot a little bit, and became more effective as a team and one-on-one defender, Faried could become a star player in his own right.  One thing that worries me about him though, is that he played lackadaisically at times last season. In his first two years he brought it every night, and thats why everyone loved him and thought the sky was the limit with this kid. I think he had a lot to prove then because of his late draft pick status and underdog 'undersized' status. It is fair to say that the USA accolades, huge contract extension and media hype may have satisfied his thirst to prove himself on the court. However, my theory is that the whole locker room travesty last year, inconsistent minutes/lineups, inconsistent game play (are we playing fast, are we playing halfcourt offense?) were more of a factor to faried's poor season, and i truly think that Faried will prove everyone that he can be a star in this league"
denvernuggets,3cgueq,skipaBturner,3,Wed Jul 8 00:37:17 2015 UTC,"Faried is a rebounding power forward. He's quick, a fast runner, can dribble, and has great leaping ability. Taking him away from the paint on offense negates his offensive rebounding, and he's a poor shooter which means the defense is content to let him shoot and rebound his misses. He didn't play with talented guards in college, and George Karl didn't put him in pick and roll, so he isn't a capable screener.   On defense, he'll bite for steals and give up positioning. It's carried over from Karl's system which emphasized turnovers. He has fast hands, which makes me believe he can play post defense as his athleticism wanes. He can rebound and push the ball up the floor, he just needs to get used to passing to open guards if the defense picks him up.   He's not a bad player - if he was making $4 million less per year, nobody would talk about his value. He hated playing under Shaw, and didn't give any effort to fit in the system. He quit, which doesn't say a lot about his character. If Malone can make Faried believe, he can be a useful player again. It's not a dead and done thing, he has a shot to change his destiny with Malone. If he doesn't do it, he's done in the league, a flash in the pan."
denvernuggets,3cgueq,minutemandan,9,Wed Jul 8 22:49:03 2015 UTC,"He brings a lot of energy to the team and is an above average rebounder.  His offensive game revolves around dunks and put-backs.  His shot's not that great, but for a guy who rebounds like he does, it's probably better for him to be in the paint anyways.  As for his defense, it's well-known that he's awful at defending the pick-and-roll.  Opposing offenses frequently take advantage of him.  Overall he's a very up-and-down player.  Some games he seems to play with a lot of energy while other games you barely notice him on the floor.  I'm not sure how much more Malone will be able to get out of him that we haven't already seen.  In my opinion, his downside outweighs his upside, and because of that I don't think I'll ever really be satisfied with him."
denvernuggets,3cgueq,Wtfitzchris,2,Tue Jul 7 20:46:12 2015 UTC,"His defense needs a lot of work, but after seeing the $$$ flying around during free agency so far, his contract has made him EXTREMELY valuable and team friendly."
denvernuggets,3cgueq,drcobb40,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:39:09 2015 UTC,Faried would be a great fit with Gobert or any other great rim protector. Not sure he is good fit with Nurk.
denvernuggets,3cgueq,AlienDeg,3,Tue Jul 7 22:19:47 2015 UTC,"If he could guard forwards, I would buy his jersey. But he can't so I still have only Gallo one"
denvernuggets,3chiv9,eathbau,3,Tue Jul 7 23:19:58 2015 UTC,"seems a bit wrong as mudiay would also be a ""cap hold"" @ 2.6m under the rookie pay scale. not clear why arthur being a UFA and nelson opting out would be a ""cap hold"" but the cba is a bit confusing at times.  basically cap is 67.1 next year. nuggets have 53 in guaranteed salary next season (including all of chandler's). + 2.6 for their first round pick. + 2.9 if franklin/green/barton all remain. = 58.5 for 8.6 in space. foye's final year is basically a team option at 3.1. no clue what jokic's salary will be but maybe like 2? (another ""cap hold"" to consider). so maybe 60.5 without foye and 6.6 in space to resign nelson and maybe bring back arthur. either way, the nuggets have some room to sign a few veterans or prospects without much trouble even if they bring foye back."
denvernuggets,3chiv9,ParadeShitter,2,Wed Jul 8 00:07:01 2015 UTC,"not clear why arthur being a UFA and nelson opting out would be a ""cap hold"" but the cba is a bit confusing at times.   So we hold their ""Bird Rights"" meaning we can sign them even if we are over the cap but that creates a ""cap hold"" that is based off their previous earnings.  It's essentially a placeholder for their contract. If we really need the cap space we could renounce the bird rights and that cap hold becomes free space. Once you renounce Arthur's bird rights, you would then need cap room if you want to sign Arthur. Though, you could probably fit his contract into the mid-level or bi-annual exception."
denvernuggets,3chiv9,tron777,2,Wed Jul 8 13:09:00 2015 UTC,So does that mean we don't have to bring Foye back?
denvernuggets,3chiv9,skipaBturner,2,Wed Jul 8 00:39:55 2015 UTC,We don't have to but at this point he might be better than the other options on the market.
denvernuggets,3chiv9,tron777,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:10:12 2015 UTC,"Take it.  He's a good locker room guy and for the money he's a solid player.  Plus we have TPEs, so being under the cap is not an advantage."

At the very least, he's comfortable with being the #1 scoring option."

I'm starting to think very seriously in the notion that we keep the majority of the team intact. Hickson is now the only player i seriously want moved. I've softed ALOT on moving Ty or Kenneth. Just resign Barton and only resign Jameer if Ty is moved.

Last year there were a lot of rumours about a change in the headcoaching position of the national team (which turned out to be true) that were handled very poorly. Let's wait a bit longer.  But as long as the source does not make something up - it is the website of a local newspaper and should be quite reliable - I don't see a reason for Weiss to intentionally deny the story if it was true. As long as it doesn't interfere with at least this summers headcoaching job..."
denvernuggets,3c9vhp,SuperPretzel,2,Mon Jul 6 14:06:09 2015 UTC,This article repeats the claim that Chris Fleming will be one of the Nuggets assistant coaches. It specifies he will join the team after the Eurobasket (05.09. - 20.09.) and continue to be Germanys national team's coach in the future.  As I stated in the other comment it wouldn't suprise me too much if Ingo Weiss's PR game is subpar once again...

denvernuggets,3c7s7t,Futurebrain,7,Sun Jul 5 21:07:10 2015 UTC,"It's more than half the game honestly. Points in transition don't happen much off an inbound pass. Steals, blocks and outlet passes get you opportunities to run. Coaching guys up on offense is tough because basketball is a game of runs. Shots either go in our they don't. Getting five guys to play defense as a team makes everything easier. Play good enough defense and your offense can be non existent for spurts without trouble. There's a reason coaches mainly talk about defense in those between quarters interviews."

denvernuggets,3c73p0,itsme101,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:40:44 2015 UTC,Absolutely zero. Javale is quite literally the worst player in the NBA due to the fact that his athleticism and potential are enough to convince FO's to take a flyer on him. Connelly inherited him on an albatross contract and had to give up a first rounder just to dump his salary (the Sixers then bought him out--seriously if you can't hang on the Sixers you don't belong in the NBA). He was a cancer while he was here and he wore his welcome out completely. Not to mention he doesn't fit anywhere on our roster and would be absolutely worthless in Malone's defensive system where players need to rigidly and intelligently stick to the scheme.

denvernuggets,3c692p,JMadFour,12,Sun Jul 5 05:48:37 2015 UTC,I don't think we move him now. Maybe coach Malone brings something out in Ty we've not seen before and all this social media bullshit stops and Ty and Mudi become an allstar duo. Either that or Ty gets buried on the bench once Mudi starts showing him up. As much as i have called for Ty to be traded nothing would make me happier than to see him reach allstar status WITH US this year.

denvernuggets,3c692p,BlindManBaldwin,2,Sun Jul 5 13:19:34 2015 UTC,"mavs, knicks, philly, detroit?"
denvernuggets,3c692p,phatlever,2,Sun Jul 5 07:09:54 2015 UTC,Detroit actually has a point guard overload. But yeah other 3 definitely need a PG.
denvernuggets,3c692p,rps215,2,Mon Jul 6 03:51:19 2015 UTC,"I don't see Detroit at all, they already have Jennings and Jackson so they're set at PG and I doubt Philly since they're most likely still trying to tank. Mavs and Knicks are probably the best options but not sure if either would trade for him or if they did would have much to return. I like Lawson a lot but he's not an elite PG and if they do decide to move him I think it will end up being for less then Nuggets fans think."
denvernuggets,3c692p,HakunaMatata023,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:51:23 2015 UTC,"Houston fans want him. Dallas could maybe use him.   Apparently in Texas they don't know about all the cigarette smoking, drunk driving, and coach ruining.   I've randomly stumbled on a few different conversations on /r/rockets where Houston fans seem really hype on Lawson and excited about the prospect of landing him somehow."

denvernuggets,3c5f74,skipaBturner,9,Sat Jul 4 23:40:17 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm excited to see all these rookies play. I feel like if Mudiay balls out in the summer league it will open a lot of peoples eyes to what kind of player he can truly become.

denvernuggets,3c4ocj,shaner307,4,Sat Jul 4 21:37:34 2015 UTC,I know he has a reputation but Doc  and Paul would be the guys that could get him to be a good NBA player.  Karl and Shaw were terrible for McGee's development.

denvernuggets,3c4a1n,OkAutopilot,2,Sat Jul 4 19:18:49 2015 UTC,"I know, I'm not saying we should because we aren't in a position to. But aren't we kind of getting screwed for a few years because of this?"
denvernuggets,3c4a1n,OkAutopilot,5,Sat Jul 4 19:45:02 2015 UTC,"I see. Yeah, I think we are. Someone with a better understanding of the tv deal and cap would know better. Under the assumption that we wouldn't be able to pay any of these ""faux-max"" deals down the line and instead have to pay real max deals when the cap raises, that'd put us at a disadvantage."
denvernuggets,3c4a1n,minutemandan,2,Sat Jul 4 20:17:32 2015 UTC,"Not for a few years - the only non-rookie deals on the roster at the moment are Kenneth Faried and Ty Lawson. If Lawson is dealt, the only players on the books would be Faried, Nurkic, Harris, Mudiay, Radičević, Jokic, and Lauvergne. That'd leave 8 spots open, needing to be filled, when the salary cap boosts from $69 million to a projected $89 million. The projections are usually under by a few million too. That means the Nuggets could have $70 million in open cap space to court free agents with.   That is what NOT getting screwed by the salary cap looks like.   EDIT - accidentally hit 8 instead of 7 on the open cap space number. Oops."
denvernuggets,3c4a1n,ParadeShitter,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:22:52 2015 UTC,"we will have plenty of cap next year which is when the new cap comes in. unfortunately, the nuggets were going to have a lot of cap regardless and will now be at a bit of a disadvantage because other teams will have cap space from the increase as well. look for guys to get massively overpaid here soon lol"
denvernuggets,3c4a1n,minutemandan,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:12:26 2015 UTC,"Look at the Pistons and how they approached free agency. The Suns needed to dump salary, and for a second round pick picked up two, three valuable guys. They also have the ability to sign Reggie Jackson to a long contract as well. Denver could be a salary dump candidate for someone like Washington if they want to clear cap for Kevin Durant. Or Boston could look to clear space to make someone an offer. Cap space doesn't always mean you have to spend it all.   Denver also has a bunch of first-round picks coming due, that will help fill up the roster with cheap contracts."
denvernuggets,3c4a1n,NickCiufi,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:14:37 2015 UTC,"Even if this is a thing (which I don't believe it is), the max contract is 5 years, which means that 4 years after the new cap, every contract will be on that rate anyway.   Plenty of options exist to create surplus value. Golden State built a championship team without scaling contracts against a bigger cap. Denver can do the same."
denvernuggets,3c4a1n,MileHighPride30,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:09:01 2015 UTC,"Golden State built a championship team without scaling contracts against a bigger cap.    Well no one else scaled contracts against a cap like they are now when they won, but I get your point."
denvernuggets,3c4a1n,silverandblack,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:21:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Every FA this offseason is getting an inflated deal, and everyone is giving a pass because ""it'll look good under the new cap"". While that's true for some (definitely not all of these contracts), these teams are still going to be overpaying role players for a year or two for 10-15 mil/year or two before the contracts actually look good.   The Nuggets will have more cap space in the next 1-2 years, which is when the cap is ACTUALLY going up. So we just need to not panic and make a dumb, expensive signings just to ""make a splash"" and wait it out for next year."

denvernuggets,3c4a1n,silverandblack,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:26:19 2015 UTC,"...no you didn't. My point is not who we would be able to sign in this situation, because we suck and have no cap. The suckiness further drives free agents away and the cap makes it impossible to really sign anyone anyways. And we don't need to add free agents to become a mediocre team because that would fuck us."

denvernuggets,3c1gy5,RiseNShine24,6,Mon Jul 6 16:10:39 2015 UTC,"While that Nuggets team was the first team I actively supported as an NBA fan, I don't think it was our most promising. The team had glaring holes in defense as well as on the bench. Billups had some superb plays in transition and we were fortunate, dare I say lucky enough, to get him out of Detroit for the husk of a human being that Iverson was at that point. Melo and JR could light it up offensively, but defensively they were very limited, and had the stopping power of a wet paper bag. K-Mart, my favourite player on that team, was definitely the defensive presence (I think he was team captain, too) but if he went down there was almost nobody left to take his place as the anchor down low. Nene had a high FG% but that was largely in part to his ability to get to the line coupled with his relatively decent finesse game. Birdman was probably the biggest spark off the bench, but aside from that, the team was only really 6 players deep. The organisation has since learned from that. I think the 57-win team was our best yet. So deep. So versatile. Great on both ends and really did pressurise teams. The only problem was when Gallo went down, we were stretched a tad too thin and McGee was a major liability in the +/- column."
denvernuggets,3c1gy5,shaner307,3,Sat Jul 4 00:44:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I for sure see what you saying. To me though seeing a lineup with Melo, Big Shot Billups, AI, and Kmart got me hyped up."

But there is a lot of people who never heard about her. We have only few sports person who are known by everybody. First league: Gortat, Lewandowski, Radwanska i Janowicz (both tennis), ex strongman and now MMA fighter Pudzianowski, winter sports guys. I think Jędrzejczyk is in 4th division of popularity because MMA especially woman mma is not popular here.

EDIT: Just realized he might be referring to free agency not trades lol.

denvernuggets,3bvzex,d-lo_tha_boss,5,Thu Jul 2 17:20:48 2015 UTC,I think the only thing we NEED to do with our roster going into the year is move Ty. Outside of that I think things will be bigger for us next year than this one.
denvernuggets,3bvzex,OkAutopilot,2,Thu Jul 2 18:32:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think Ty will get moved until summer league is over. If they move Ty, doesn't that put Mudiay in the starting lineup on day one? They have to make sure Mudiay is ready first."
denvernuggets,3bvzex,aatencio91,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:55:36 2015 UTC,I think it would be extremely foolish of this franchise to not have Mudiay in the starting lineup on day one. I would imagine he'd be the only top 8 pick to not be starting next year unless Porzingis really isn't up to it.
denvernuggets,3bvzex,OkAutopilot,2,Thu Jul 2 18:57:51 2015 UTC,I heard today there was a possibility of Porzingus starting in the D-league.  I do think that Mudiay needs to get lots of playing time as a rookie.
denvernuggets,3bvzex,aatencio91,2,Thu Jul 2 19:04:03 2015 UTC,Hope we don't. Hope the relationship is repaired and he stays a Nugget long term.
denvernuggets,3bvzex,Josh_Rivera,2,Thu Jul 2 22:36:23 2015 UTC,Oh that would be just horrible because Mudiay and Ty on the floor at the same time makes no sense. The Nugs wouldn't have drafted Mudiay if they intended to keep Ty.
denvernuggets,3bvzex,OkAutopilot,2,Thu Jul 2 23:32:21 2015 UTC,I totally agree. The longer Ty stays the worse it is for Mudiay. I don't think sharing the floor with another PG is any way to use him.
denvernuggets,3bvzex,utw,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:36:02 2015 UTC,"I understand why many want Ty to be kept, but that absolutely isn't fair to Mudiay if we expect him to develop and take the reins of the team like he's capable of. He can learn some things from Ty in the very near future, but at some point he'll need an optimal (high) amount of time and touches to do so, likely sooner rather than later. Of course, he has to earn it, but he won't have a fair chance if Ty sticks around.    And Ty is only 27 so there's no way he'd be willing to step aside and take a lesser role in the foreseeable future. Barring Mudiay sinking completely, which I doubt he will, but I think is more likely if he's sharing the floor with Ty or being relegated to backup, we will have a future problem if we go this route.   It's just hard to fathom Ty sticking around and it being the best solution for everyone involved. I just don't think there's any way Ty factors in longterm. The longer we wait, hesitating to make a decision, the worse it is for Mudiay. It would stunt his development."
denvernuggets,3bvzex,utw,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:26:23 2015 UTC,"Ty has developed a pretty shitty attitude, I don't want Mudiay learning anything from him.  My worry is that Ty's value is really low right now, and the Kroenkes won't give him away for nothing and they won't take on bad contracts, so I think there's a fair chance Lawson plays for Denver next season, which will pretty much be awkward for everyone involved, at this point."
denvernuggets,3bvzex,damb_b,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:22:58 2015 UTC,"You're right to be concerned. I am, too.  While I said he ""can"" learn some things, meaning on court stuff, I certainly don't want to chance him taking on bad habits or attitude, either. I honestly do think that there's a greater chance of it becoming toxic more than everyone playing nice.  Mudiay also needs and should get as much time on the floor as possible. He should be our priority, meaning no Ty in our short or long term future. It really is best for all that we find a deal to move him along ASAP.   But like you I also fear we won't be able to find a deal. Once the draft passed I thought that the Nuggets would need to wait for free agency to play out, but now teams that needed a PG are finding one or keeping the one they had, or sending away assets that could have been used in acquiring one, or are teams we don't want to help. The trade deadline is probably our best bet as of now and even then I'm not so sure."

denvernuggets,3bwgkv,with2nns,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:50:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe you would understand it if you stopped thinking of players as commodities and just thought about it in terms of opportunity cost. We have a few choices; keep him until his contract is up (he isn't resigning here ever again), we could trade him, or we could cut him.   He is going to leave or he will be here, but everybody will know he is going to leave. I don't think having a guy in your locker room that everyone knows is on their way out the door is good for your team. Do you? Do you think it's a terrible trade because you know of a better one that teams will agree to?"
denvernuggets,3bwgkv,ir3flex,2,Tue Jul 7 23:45:07 2015 UTC,"Do they have a 1st to give? Still, I think I'd rather let Ty do his thing till the trade deadline and hope we can get a lotto pick.Then again it's not a deep draft :/."

Was there really any need to invite Mudiay to a workout?  There's nothing he could have done at a workout that would have convinced the Nuggets not to take him if he was available."
denvernuggets,3bvr0z,tylerthetiger,4,Thu Jul 2 16:28:41 2015 UTC,"I think workouts are so overrated by writers, fans, etc. They're certainly a tool in the process, but the end-all-be-all is game tape.

denvernuggets,3bvr0z,aatencio91,2,Thu Jul 2 17:59:13 2015 UTC,"Connelly said that he watched every minute of tape on Mudiay multiple times over, so I think they were pretty prepared going into draft night."

denvernuggets,3buhyy,with2nns,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:57:15 2015 UTC,"Houston for sure needs to be on this list. That's the only position on our roster that needs an upgrade. I'm certain Morey has had talks with the nugs and will continue to man the phones when the nugs are ready to make a deal. Trade assets include TJones, Dekker, Kpap (non-guaranteed $4.5 mil contract) 2016 1st round pick."
denvernuggets,3buhyy,KillorFireMcFail,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:22:07 2015 UTC,"I'd do Dekker or Kpap + 1st, preferably Dekker. TJones I'd only take is Faried gets traded. The only thing is, with Ty's stock apparently being low, idk if Morey will want to give up one of those guys + 1st rounder. And if they're the only ones involved, you'd be taking on an extra ~8-10M. It looks like you're other tradeable guys are low salaried, so that could be an issue."
denvernuggets,3buhyy,with2nns,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:57:10 2015 UTC,Yeah thats why Kpap would likely be involved. His contract is around 4.5mil and its non-guaranteed so you could waive him.

If he can find his range from three he'll turn into a solid SF / Stretch PF. But the rockets will likely move him to match salaries when they find a team willing to part with a PG."
denvernuggets,3buhyy,KillorFireMcFail,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:46:14 2015 UTC,"Dallas would be a good fit, but they have zero tradeable assets, so it'd likely be for a draft pick.  I'd thrown in Boston too (since they tried to trade for him last year) for maybe IT2 or Smart + another young player."
denvernuggets,3buhyy,checkag,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:08:55 2015 UTC,"Boston wouldn't make sense. They have too many G as is, and denver wouldn't want to take a young pg. As we are tradin ty for mudiay.  But I like the idea of Houston( Mabye try and land KJ and a pick) or sac (I think Divac won't make a move, trying to preach stability with the core players lol.) or Mabye even someone like the bucks if they need Offense through the pg ( play alongside MCW).   Now we have mudiay. Tys stock is low, and will stay that way. There is a lot of better point guards then Ty (falls into the catagory of really g starter, not an all star)."

denvernuggets,3bu1cl,bo0ompow,8,Thu Jul 2 03:43:57 2015 UTC,Well done Sacramento. You can now sign Rondo after competing against yourselves to get his signature.
denvernuggets,3bu1cl,eathbau,5,Thu Jul 2 03:58:29 2015 UTC,if anything i think this takes us OUT of any trades with them. They're going for Rondo
denvernuggets,3bu1cl,teensonacid,3,Thu Jul 2 04:06:30 2015 UTC,Rondo over those SGs?
denvernuggets,3bu1cl,utw,5,Thu Jul 2 04:07:33 2015 UTC,"No, Rondo+whoever. There's talk of using this money for a Rondo+Ellis reunification which would be a horrible move for the Kings."
denvernuggets,3bu1cl,teensonacid,2,Thu Jul 2 04:13:54 2015 UTC,I completely agree
denvernuggets,3bu1cl,pairidaeza,2,Thu Jul 2 04:21:37 2015 UTC,Rondo plus Ellis/Mathews...it's a clusterfuck of a situation over there...they should have grabbed Ty and Faried when they had the chance
denvernuggets,3bu1cl,utw,3,Thu Jul 2 04:15:10 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with trading Lawson and Faried, for the right price.  I don't really want to strengthen a conference rival so it has to be a fairly even trade. I still thinking we could play part in a 3-team trade involving Cousins - whether or not that's in order for him to come to Denver, I don't know."
denvernuggets,3bu1cl,NUGGman,6,Thu Jul 2 03:46:55 2015 UTC,"I would be very surprised to see a Boogie trade before this time next year. They're intent on riding out the year with him. This was designed for them to go all in with Cousins, Gay, Ellis or possibly Matthews, and Rondo right now. They could either succeed against all odds and sneak into the playoffs, placating Cousins, or have it blow up spectacularly in their faces if they fail to get their targets or if they do, have it blow up anyway considering the way Monta+Rondo worked in Dallas.  But if it doesn't work and Cousins demands out it could work to our favor if we hold off from any trades until then. That's a risk, however, since we would be passing up on other potential deals. I don't think the Nuggets would wait."
denvernuggets,3bu1cl,Samcrates,3,Thu Jul 2 04:08:45 2015 UTC,"I doubt they're gonna give up Cousins, but who wouldn't be up for that."

He adds much needed defense and if he's on, different options to the offense. The problem is how often he's actually on. In fact, I like him a lot more when he plays closer to the basket. He needs to cut down on the low-efficiency long twos and low-percentage threes.  The frontcourt is also crowded as hell. We have too many damn players up front and not enough wings or 2s. While I wouldn't mind keeping him, I struggle to see where he fits without a whole mess of trades. It's for this reason that I would pass. It's time to ride with Faried, if we find no takers for him, Jokic, and Joffrey."
denvernuggets,3btgkf,utw,2,Thu Jul 2 01:38:44 2015 UTC,"I like Darth personally, at least compared to Hickson.  I feel like he is much less likely to screw up and at least brings some defensive intensity when we need it."
denvernuggets,3btgkf,corybyu,3,Thu Jul 2 03:14:35 2015 UTC,Well if we could trade Hickson for whatever and keep Darth I would like that.

denvernuggets,3btgkf,zoeyversustheraccoon,0,Thu Jul 2 00:45:32 2015 UTC,"If he was as good in the locker room as he was on the court, I'm sure the team would survive without him.    Might be a good dude but for a stretch 4 he doesn't shoot that well from long range and is a poor rebounder.  He's a good perimeter defender but rarely is that a huge factor for a PF.  Maybe that was the result of Shaw's system but if they re-sign him I hope it's to be the 3rd stringer."

denvernuggets,3bq1u1,OkAutopilot,2,Wed Jul 1 07:06:45 2015 UTC,"Nurk is good on D. Our whole team's defensive rating picks up when he is on the floor, apparently."

He can definitely hold his own against bigger slower guys, but the faster more athletic guys seem to get the best of him, as does going out on the perimeter. His help d is hit or miss but sometimes he makes really agile switches and covers so that's promising. He should improve next year but I don't think enough to make up for our other issues at the 4."

denvernuggets,3bnlrm,HeartOfFeS2,18,Tue Jun 30 17:40:19 2015 UTC,Interesting front court we'll have with a Bosnian and a Serbian...
denvernuggets,3bnlrm,MilchandCookies,5,Tue Jun 30 18:02:59 2015 UTC,"Serbian, Bosnian, Italian, Congolese on the same floor. Maybe French at times too."

denvernuggets,3bnlrm,silverandblack,5,Tue Jun 30 18:42:42 2015 UTC,"He's coming from Europe, signing his first NBA deal, proving himself, and earning more money in 3 years (if he's worth it). Saying he's dumb for signing this deal is like saying Mudiay is dumb for signing his rookie deal. You gotta play for cheaper until you prove that you're worth the big bucks  Besides, this deal is fully guaranteed. That's pretty damn good."

denvernuggets,3bncxy,aatencio91,7,Tue Jun 30 16:37:48 2015 UTC,I think the most glaring need is a talented SG.
denvernuggets,3bncxy,The_NGUYENNER,7,Tue Jun 30 17:03:37 2015 UTC,"An offensively talented SG. And the more veteran, the better. I'm not certain how much better we could do than Foye, though."
denvernuggets,3bncxy,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Tue Jun 30 17:10:23 2015 UTC,I'd love to have Fours back. Or get our hands on one of Toronto's wings.. Maybe DeRozan for Faried.

denvernuggets,3bncxy,NickCiufi,2,Tue Jun 30 17:44:34 2015 UTC,"Ehh...I'm not a huge fan of DeRozan. He seems to have a tendency to chuck up any mid range that he can, and it doesn't go in very often. That may be a product of the Raptors offense, though (I don't watch them enough to know the answer to that) and he might become much more efficient in an offense that preaches attacking the basket and getting corner threes."

His shot looks so great that I still have a lot of hope that he can morph into an above average starter to pair with Mudiay. I think they could really get after it on d and with Mudiay driving and kicking and Harris knocking down shots (maybe) they could more than hold their own on o."

denvernuggets,3bncxy,Aquaman60,3,Wed Jul 1 18:12:12 2015 UTC,"very difficult question to answer that I'm trying to think about as well. we're looking for a young, offensive guard but I really can't see a trade working out anywhere. maybe ben mclemore but idk"
denvernuggets,3bncxy,The_NGUYENNER,3,Wed Jul 1 18:49:06 2015 UTC,"This question will be better answered after free agency.....  Right now we have Lawson, Mudiay, Harris, Gallo, Chandler, Faried, Nurk, Lauvergne, Foye, Hickson, and probably Jokic. But that could all look really different if we trade Ty/Gallo/Chandler/Faried in the coming days.  We definitely need a starting quality SG as it is though"
denvernuggets,3bncxy,hayclaylaybaymaysay,7,Tue Jun 30 17:41:40 2015 UTC,"The question was asked in hopes of figuring out what to expect in free agency.  Also Jokic has just been or will soon be signed to a three-year deal, so he's officially a Nugget now."
denvernuggets,3bncxy,minutemandan,2,Tue Jun 30 17:46:41 2015 UTC,"If Lawson is getting moved, a backup point guard. Erick Green probably isn't going to cut it if we want to have a competitive team."
denvernuggets,3bncxy,imhandy,4,Tue Jun 30 21:33:26 2015 UTC,I think the plan is to resign Jameer if we can trade Ty; he's very capable on the court and apparently a great guy to have in the locker room as well.

denvernuggets,3bl7kc,BChav,3,Tue Jun 30 03:19:25 2015 UTC,to play the 2? i'd go for it. he still has game
denvernuggets,3bl7kc,teensonacid,4,Tue Jun 30 03:19:27 2015 UTC,I don't want to pay an old joe johnson 25mil for 1 year. There's noting to gain from that.
denvernuggets,3bl7kc,OkAutopilot,3,Tue Jun 30 06:59:20 2015 UTC,"gun for hire. would probably need a third team to make sense since all brooklyn could give up is johnson @ 24.8 million (they have literally zero draft picks for the foreseeable future) and the nuggets would have to give up 2+ players to make the money work (ex. ty, jj, foye @ 21.1). i'd have no problem with it but it would leave the nuggets pretty thin with not a whole lot of money to spend to round out the team.  depending on how chandler is feeling about returning, they could do him and ty at 19.5. be interesting to see who they could bring in for the third team since i doubt brooklyn would want both ty and williams. i also doubt denver would be willing to give up rights to so many guys if they don't think he's likely to stay more than one season. if denver was in a position to win, than sure... it'd make sense but i don't think they're quite there yet and would probably prefer to go the collection route by trading away current talent for future talent"
denvernuggets,3bl7kc,ParadeShitter,3,Tue Jun 30 04:42:58 2015 UTC,"I know he has a really unfavorable contract, but I'd rather have Deron Williams than Joe Johnson. I just feel like D-Will was limited by injuries, and if he came to Denver, he'd be better than in Brooklyn. He'd be one of the most expensive backup guards in the league, but he can play off ball too. Help keep him healthy by limiting his minutes, have him teach Mudiay how to destroy a defense in the pick and roll, and let him be a veteran contributor. Then when his contract ends in 2016-17, the Nuggets would have $23 million in cap space to use in a year where the salary cap could be around $100 million. That's enough space to get a max player if we play our cards right."
denvernuggets,3bl7kc,minutemandan,2,Tue Jun 30 21:30:39 2015 UTC,no.
denvernuggets,3bl7kc,FraserTheAmazer,2,Tue Jun 30 11:45:25 2015 UTC,"No thanks. I think the Nuggets should pick up some useless players who fit into their TPEs.  Not just any useless players though, in particular players who teams are willing to attach a pick (or prospect) to dump.  If we jump into the rebuild head first, it will be over more quickly IMO."
denvernuggets,3bl7kc,BuickGrandNationalX,3,Tue Jun 30 18:06:36 2015 UTC,"Joe Johnson is in my opinion not a leader. Plus, he's old...we don't by any means need to get any older unless it's a veteran with a voice to mentor guys like Green, Harris, Nurk, and Mudiay. Joe Johnson is a little too ball-centric as well...last time we had a ball-centric player, we...well I don't think I need to detail much more."
denvernuggets,3bl7kc,kthxtyler,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:54:03 2015 UTC,"Matters what the Nets will package him with, his contract is an absolute albatross (25mm on a team way into the tax)   They have no 1st round picks to give and no young talent (aside from Bojan Bogdanović, who is unproven), no thanks"
denvernuggets,3bkv6y,JMadFour,9,Tue Jun 30 01:25:17 2015 UTC,"He ALWAYS misses close shots.  Also another thing that always pisses me off is he often tries to draw a foul, and when he is heading to the free throw line he acts like he just did something good for the team.  Like nigga, you shoot 57% free throws, stop trying to draw fouls and smirk at your teammates like that when your just going to miss both freebies."
denvernuggets,3bkv6y,followthelawson,7,Tue Jun 30 03:32:58 2015 UTC,Mannnn I can drop 78 with J Lin on 2k..that game is straight cheese word to chris smoove. As long as u know the animations u can drop 50+ or grab 20+ boards with damn near anybody. Now look I don't hate JJ but bro got to step his game up AT LEAST to a Draymond Green type level the way NBA been paying him.
denvernuggets,3bkv6y,Oshawut,2,Tue Jun 30 02:42:58 2015 UTC,"Hickson can't shoot the 3 and has no where near Draymond's agility  You should hope for Hickson to become a Tristan Thompson type player, but he doesn't have the heart"

Yes, he's that bad for me.  Dude just straight steals peoples rebounds, forgets what to do on defence and misses under the hoop a lot.   EDIT: He also gets paid a lot more than he should"
denvernuggets,3bkv6y,Ediblegoldnuggets,3,Tue Jun 30 01:46:51 2015 UTC,Nah. My only knowledge of him is in 2k15.  Thats why I'm asking.
denvernuggets,3bkv6y,teensonacid,2,Tue Jun 30 01:36:16 2015 UTC,he's only good on the break. he can finish most times. other than that he's hot garbage.

denvernuggets,3bkv6y,teensonacid,5,Tue Jun 30 02:29:40 2015 UTC,but it doesn't
denvernuggets,3bkv6y,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Tue Jun 30 02:42:25 2015 UTC,"When JJ Hickson is playing well, he's a double/double machine that's a defensive liability. If he's not making his layouts (as was the case last season), his presence on the court outright hurts the teams. He plays a lot of ""matador"" defense."
denvernuggets,3bkv6y,utw,2,Tue Jun 30 02:50:02 2015 UTC,"One problem is, at least in his first year, many of his games were starts at center where he's undersized. He wasn't coming off the bench. To top it off, it was alongside Faried and it was redundant and ugly since they share the same skillset.   Last year, though he was back to the bench, he was often playing center again when he should be a PF.  Hickson is what many would call an ""empty stats"" guy. I don't necessarily always buy into the notion, but they're the kind that do the stuff that shows up in the box score, rarely the stuff that doesn't, and often in garbage time or on a bad team where he can get his when it doesn't matter.  Watch him. Matador defense, being out of position, 15 footers that brick off the iron, etc. It's stuff like this that annoy everyone.  If he came in and just did what he was intended to do...coming off the bench, spelling Faried at PF, at 1 to 1.5 million less, he'd be fine. That's not all necessarily his fault since he's as much a victim of circumstance and bad line-ups, but now he's the face of an ugly period of Nuggets basketball, so it is what it is."
denvernuggets,3bkv6y,rvhack,2,Tue Jun 30 03:54:00 2015 UTC,"He isn't a center. He's too short for despite multiple teams, including us putting him there. The result is Swiss cheese paint defense which clearly lost us games last year."
denvernuggets,3bkv6y,10blast,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:35:34 2015 UTC,He is the same hight as Kenneth but attempts to play center which he is not good at. He also is a little to slow to play the PF. He is not that good on offense.
denvernuggets,3bkv6y,Abiv23,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:07:31 2015 UTC,"From Cleveland, Live in Denver have been watching Hickson for a long time  He doesn't have an NBA position, size-wise he's a PF, skill-wise he's a C.  He is a bone head on defensive rotations and will give up easy buckets due to it.  He has no jumper to speak of and is a black hole on the post.  He is sort of an enigma across the NBA, he had a career year in Portland and was immediately jettisoned by them, he was a late 1st round pick by the Cavs that definately hit in terms of talent at that spot but after Lebron left he was sent packing for Omri Casspi a much lesser talent   Guys like this are always better in videogames than real-life"
denvernuggets,3bk4nl,tron777,6,Mon Jun 29 21:45:23 2015 UTC,"Apparently the Nuggets were in line to draft Cauley-Stein or Winslow if Mudiay was not available.  The Nuggets were concerned about Porzingers lack of passing ability and didn't seem to think he was worthy of such a high pick. Tim Connelly completely controls the room. Josh Kroenke is present but has no appreciable impact.    It's possible that editing, or just the fact that cameras were in the room, played a large part in shaping these impressions but I found these points pretty interesting."
denvernuggets,3bk4nl,d-lo_tha_boss,5,Mon Jun 29 21:59:44 2015 UTC,Interesting that they had Cauley-Stein lined up as a potential back up plan. Guess they weren't as concerned with the sickle cell/altitude combo as some of us (myself included) were on here.
denvernuggets,3bk4nl,aatencio91,3,Mon Jun 29 23:53:40 2015 UTC,"they weren't as concerned with the sickle cell/altitude combo as some of us   I'm guilty as charged. They probably know more about the condition and its effects than I do, but it still made me leery of him."
denvernuggets,3bk4nl,d-lo_tha_boss,3,Tue Jun 30 16:35:29 2015 UTC,"Same here, I didn't even think about it till you brought up the Ryan Clark situation. Either way I'm glad we got our guy, WCS can hang out down at sea level."

denvernuggets,3bk4nl,icarus_adam,2,Tue Jun 30 00:32:08 2015 UTC,This was really fascinating. It'd be so fun to be in the war room like this.  It'd be so interesting to hear what pro scouts and smart bball minds think of all these guys like WCS and Mudiay.
denvernuggets,3bk4j6,hayclaylaybaymaysay,3,Mon Jun 29 21:44:32 2015 UTC,"I don't really have an opinion yet on Biyombo but I was looking at his stats and came across this gem: his Free Throw Rate was .941 last year.  That means that he has very nearly taken more free throws than field goal attempts. This dude just refuses to shoot the ball. The only real comparison is DeAndre Jordan but teams were fouling Deandre on purpose and, at 58%, I don't think teams were fouling Biyombo on purpose."
denvernuggets,3bk4j6,tron777,3,Mon Jun 29 22:11:50 2015 UTC,With him and Nurk we would have incredibly good rim protection. We would also have two offensive liabilities clogging the paint with no shooting to open up space and spread the floor. I would like him as a bench guy but not with the current nuggets roster
denvernuggets,3bk4j6,THECHUNGAWANGA,3,Tue Jun 30 00:47:32 2015 UTC,"Biyombo is a solid defender but we are getting pretty stacked up at the PF and C with players that have similar limitations. Nurkic, Faried, Joff, JJ.  Not a reliable shooter, passer (except Nurk) OR post player in the bunch. Allegedly Jokic has some passing and shooting skills but we'll see.      I'd rather the Nuggets focus their free agency and trade efforts toward wing players and shooters.  Same reason I'm not that high on T. Jones for Denver even though he's a solid player."
denvernuggets,3bk4j6,icarus_adam,2,Tue Jun 30 01:00:58 2015 UTC,"Hes a great defender, wouldn't mind him off the bench"
denvernuggets,3bk4j6,followthelawson,2,Tue Jun 30 00:17:57 2015 UTC,"I'd take him. After Hickson leaves we'd have Jokic/Lauvergne with Nurk/Biyombo. Looks good to me. Jokic and Lauvergne can stretch the floor, Nurk can do Nurk things, and we can stick Biyombo under the rim to rebound, get putbacks, and defend. Plus he's only 22, I don't think there's a better fit out there.   I don't think we have a ton of cap space though, we'd probably have to let Foye go to outbid everyone."
denvernuggets,3bk4j6,with2nns,3,Tue Jun 30 00:45:06 2015 UTC,"Dudes smaller than JJ Hickson, I don't think we can afford to play him at C"
denvernuggets,3bk4j6,licoriceallsorts,3,Tue Jun 30 02:05:23 2015 UTC,"He played C for Charlotte, and apparently very well, at least defensively."
denvernuggets,3bk4j6,with2nns,2,Tue Jun 30 17:14:13 2015 UTC,He's about the same size as Hickson. He also has a 7'6 wingspan and a higher standing reach than Nurkic. He can definitely play center.
denvernuggets,3bk4j6,HeartOfFeS2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:35:20 2015 UTC,But even Hickson can hardly play center
denvernuggets,3bk4j6,licoriceallsorts,3,Tue Jun 30 05:31:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that Hickson can't really play center. I'm just saying that Bismack is much better suited, physically, to play the position despite being about the same size as Hickson. Biyombo is a great rim protector with his huge wingspan."
denvernuggets,3bk4j6,HeartOfFeS2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:55:44 2015 UTC,no. No. NO.   I live in Charlotte and get the pleasure of watching him play. Its downright comical. Hes awful. No offensive game whatsoever. Can play a little D but not worth it.
denvernuggets,3bj623,aatencio91,8,Mon Jun 29 17:36:57 2015 UTC,"We should try to sign Khris Middleton, who is a restricted free agent. He would fill two needs: perimeter defense and shooting."

I'm not saying Mudiay deserves to be mentioned in that sort of company but there are people who take their game to another level of almost psychotic proportions.

I get that this team sucks and has almost no chance in making the playoffs, let alone winning the championship, but I am not going to root for them to lose.  Nope, not gonna do it."
denvernuggets,3bdfd2,d33p_blu3,7,Sun Jun 28 04:58:27 2015 UTC,"Amen. I despise tanking as a strategy, look at what the Sixers have to show for it after 3 years of pure garbage. Plus we don't need to tank, the Knicks can do it for us."

I'd rather my team earn their paychecks for 82 solid games and at least try to make the playoffs rather than be concerned with whether or not they get the #5 or the #1.
denvernuggets,3bdfd2,kidhumbeats,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:58:13 2015 UTC,"I think they should try for a while, sure, but if things fall apart like they did last year, commit to losing instead of trying to win as many as you can until committing to losing far too late.  If the Nuggets had kept Shaw through the end of the year, maybe they could've ended up with Russell instead of Mudiay. I'm not upset with Mudiay, but I sure would like Russell in yellow and blue instead of yellow and purple."
denvernuggets,3bdfd2,aatencio91,2,Mon Jun 29 15:45:08 2015 UTC,i dunno man. free agency and trades are how the nuggets are gonna make the playoffs. not draft picks. just look at the timberwolves. they got #1 picks for days now.   we will see  im thrilled with mudiay and just want lawson gone.Gallo is legit too.
denvernuggets,3bdfd2,kidhumbeats,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:35:12 2015 UTC,"Free Agency is too tricky. The Nuggets have never been able to draw free agents, even in the Karl/Melo heyday. If the Nuggets are going to get premier players, it might have to be through the draft."

I was ecstatic and shocked when both he and Winslow were still available at 7.     Quite a lot of first round draft picks in that game.   A few players who are already in the NBA and quite a few playing for big time college programs, or like in the case of Jamal Murray, just committed to play for one (Kentucky).     Nikola Jokic (Already in the NBA with Denver)  Damien Inglis (Already in the NBA with Milwaukee)  Clint Capela (Already in the NBA with Houston)  Karl Towns Jr.  (#1)  Jahlil Okafor (#3)  Emmanuel Mudiay (#7)  Stanley Johnson (#8)  Justise Winslow (#10)  Myles Turner (#11)  Trey Lyles (#12)  Kelly Oubre (#15)  Tyus Jones (#24)  Cliff Alexander (Injuries & NCAA issues. Declared for the draft but went undrafted, will likely get a shot though)  Jamal Murray (Committed to Kentucky a couple days ago)  Brandone Francis (Florida Gators)  Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk (Kansas Jayhawks)  Theo Pinson (North Carolina Tarheels)  Reid Travis (Stanford)  Joel Berry III (North Carolina Tarheels)  James Blackmon Jr. (Indiana Hoosiers)  James Metecan Birsen (Playing professionally in Turkey)  Shang Gao (Guangdong Southern)  Have to feel bad for Cliff Alexander.  Was a top prospect but had injury issues.   Declared early also after some NCAA trouble.  I'm guessing he'll get a shot as a free agent somewhere.  Might have to prove himself in the summer league or dleague."

denvernuggets,3b8t59,trentyz,3,Sat Jun 27 01:29:06 2015 UTC,Just found this one.
denvernuggets,3b7gon,IdRatherBeLurking,11,Fri Jun 26 16:12:59 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking we'll gauge the market for Ty in the coming months, but from what it sounds like his stock isn't as high around the league as we consider it internally. My guess is we were shopping him or other assets around for a chance to move back into the middle picks of the first round and it just wasn't happening. So if we can't get good value for him now I can see us just rolling with Ty for at least part of next season and seeing what we can get for him in midseason or at the deadline when teams get desperate.  I still think we're probably a season or two away from the playoffs. We certainly have talent on this team to be competitive, and some very intriguing young prospects in Juka and Mudiay. I hope our front office has the patience and vision to let Malone do his thing and help those two reach their considerable potential. Between that and wishing nothing but strife on the Knicks next season (come on pick swap!), I think the future for this team is bright. Go Nuggies."
denvernuggets,3b7gon,d-lo_tha_boss,3,Fri Jun 26 16:28:36 2015 UTC,I agree. The problem is that no one seems desperate at the deadline anymore and those that are don't have much in the way of assets. I'm starting to get really excited for the pick swap and I'm going to stay hyped until the Knicks get some good players. It's bad now and if Melo snaps it could get real ugly.
denvernuggets,3b7gon,tron777,5,Fri Jun 26 17:10:56 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't it be so ""Knicks"" for them to win the draft lottery- and then have to draft outside the top 10?"
denvernuggets,3b7gon,hayclaylaybaymaysay,7,Fri Jun 26 19:07:49 2015 UTC,The direction is Full Rebuild.  The only question is whether tanking will be involved.   Hopefully not.
denvernuggets,3b7gon,JMadFour,2,Fri Jun 26 18:38:53 2015 UTC,How can we know that when the entire roster is still intact?
denvernuggets,3b7gon,JMadFour,3,Fri Jun 26 18:41:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think ""the roster is still intact"" was quite what the FO was shooting for.  They just couldnt get anything done on draft night.  Whole lotta offseason left to blow the team up."
denvernuggets,3b7gon,NickCiufi,2,Fri Jun 26 18:48:23 2015 UTC,"Not to mention DURING the season. Faried's contract is going to look like an absolute steal in 2016 when the cap gets super high but he stays at about half of the max contract for three more years. Chandler (ditto for Gallinari) is an above-average player on a cheap expiring contract - you can usually get a middle-of-the-first pick for those (like Afflalo). Hickson and Foye are 3m -5m expirings that could turn into a decent bench guy with 2 years left on the contract. Lawson is the most talented of the bunch and his contract has one more year of team-friendly salary in the first year of the giant cap hike. Even if no one moves this summer, we should be able to land a pretty sizable haul in December."
denvernuggets,3b7gon,with2nns,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:43:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think Faried's contract will look like a steal. Paying him ~13M then is like paying him 8-9M now. That seems about his value. And expirings don't mean as much with the cap jump, especially ones in the 3-5M range. If a team does want someone on an expiring they'd be wary to trade anything of value, unless he commits to sign a deal beforehand. Lawson is probably our best bet at landing a good haul."
denvernuggets,3b7gon,minutemandan,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:59:56 2015 UTC,"Right, so unfortunately the promise fell short. I don't doubt it will become clear by free agency, but the promise was on draft night."
denvernuggets,3b7gon,hayclaylaybaymaysay,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:52:40 2015 UTC,"Nuggets could wind up with three first round picks in 2016. The only contracts on the books for 2016-17 that aren't rookies are Lawson and Faried, both of whom may be on the trading block.   So the plan seems to indicate a complete youth movement starting next season. That could be why it was rumored that Gallinari was on the block, maybe Connelly isn't certain if he wants to bring him back in 2016-17.   Don't even have to tank, Knicks are probably going to give Denver a top-3 pick next year. Don't think free agency is really going to make them that much better, they have zero depth."
denvernuggets,3b7gon,rhinoman4,4,Sat Jun 27 12:13:05 2015 UTC,"I think we keep Ty until the trade deadline. We should give Mike Malone a chance to work with him to at least improve his stock so we can get more in a trade. If anyone can connect with malcontents like Ty, it's Malone; just look at how he related to Boogie.  I think Denver probably tried to trade back up to grab Devin Booker or Justise Winslow and couldn't work out a deal. Probably a case of us overvaluing our players, but whatever.   As it pertains to the future direction, I think we are trying to become a team of small-ego, high-skill, high upside basketball players from Europe ala the Spurs. We've embraced the fact that Euro players aren't desperate to bolt to NY/LA/Chicago/DC and actually like living in Denver, therefor we have a chance to retain them if they actually become All-Star level guys. Nurk, Lauvergne, Gallo, and Jokic are going to be here for a long time I think because of that. Gary Harris fits that personality mold too. It's good we've recognized that and we are realizing that players are more and more taking into account the city (as opposed to the basketball franchise itself) when making free agent decisions."
denvernuggets,3b7gon,phatlever,2,Fri Jun 26 16:29:32 2015 UTC,According to Dempsey on Twitter they were trying to like hell to make a trade work to grab another 1st round pick but couldn't find any takers. I'd love to know who they were targeting with that one if they'd been able to make it work. That might at least give us some clues into this 'new direction' we keep hearing about
denvernuggets,3b7gon,Abiv23,2,Fri Jun 26 16:49:55 2015 UTC,"I even heard they were super close until one team pulled out at the last second. ""Takes two teams"" as Connelly said. They had a guy between 8 and whatever it was that they were big on but couldn't get."
denvernuggets,3b7gon,chucho320,2,Fri Jun 26 16:55:20 2015 UTC,I wonder what our max offer was

denvernuggets,3b7gon,chucho320,-1,Fri Jun 26 21:05:11 2015 UTC,"The Kings are way too close to firing GK for the Nuggets to take a wait and see approach.  I say we do everything we can to bring Boogie here now before our chances evaporate.  GK thinks the highest of Ty than any other team, so we have to take advantage of that. His stock won't go up this offseason, and if Ty keeps going Ty on social media, it'll just keep plummeting.  Strike while the iron is hot."
denvernuggets,3b7gon,chucho320,8,Fri Jun 26 18:42:04 2015 UTC,There is 0% chance the Cousins comes here.
denvernuggets,3b7gon,chucho320,2,Fri Jun 26 18:45:39 2015 UTC,I agree. He likes small towns but Denver is too isolated and he knows Malone.
denvernuggets,3b7gon,Abiv23,-5,Fri Jun 26 19:23:50 2015 UTC,"I remember your percentages of us making the playoffs last year, so I'm still holding out hope."
denvernuggets,3b7gon,licoriceallsorts,5,Fri Jun 26 18:47:02 2015 UTC,"Ha, sure. And how exactly will we acquire him? By trading the entire team? And how will that make us better?"
denvernuggets,3b7gon,chucho320,-2,Fri Jun 26 18:51:33 2015 UTC,I'm not opposed to that.  Gotta start somewhere.  I'm okay if we dismantle the trash we have to bring in a solid foundation.  What do the Lakers have to trade?  Yet suddenly they are the frontrunners.  I like our GK angle and I hope we exploit it.
denvernuggets,3b7gon,licoriceallsorts,3,Fri Jun 26 18:55:29 2015 UTC,"Ty Lawson  Danilo Gallinari  Wilson Chandler  Kenneth Faried  If you view these players as ""trash"", then I don't think this conversation is worth continuing."

denvernuggets,3b4yce,Oshawut,4,Fri Jun 26 00:53:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly not sure that'd get us in the playoffs next year. Foye and Faried aren't particularly good starters in this league, Mudiay very unproven, Gallo with injury issues but solid when healthy, and Cousins."

denvernuggets,3b4yce,RifleTower,3,Fri Jun 26 00:38:19 2015 UTC,"So, is Ty out at this point??"
denvernuggets,3b4yce,pairidaeza,3,Fri Jun 26 00:41:30 2015 UTC,"Logic says we should keep him because him and Mudiay can co-exist. But... all the writing on the wall is that he might be a King, I don't really know. If they do trade him though, I just hope it's not for the sake of just trading him."
denvernuggets,3b4yce,with2nns,2,Fri Jun 26 01:06:08 2015 UTC,"Mudiay, with Lin coming off the bench sounds kinda nice"
denvernuggets,3b4yce,with2nns,2,Fri Jun 26 01:13:31 2015 UTC,Lin?
denvernuggets,3b4yce,CPage12,3,Fri Jun 26 03:31:48 2015 UTC,There was a rumor Lin was coming to the Nuggets. I never thought it would happen. But if it does....I'll eat.... a piece of fried Chicken.

denvernuggets,3b4yce,The_Super_Deer,28,Fri Jun 26 00:50:18 2015 UTC,THE STEAL OF THE DRAFT!! YEAAAAAA
denvernuggets,3b4yce,broncoboots12,13,Fri Jun 26 00:30:50 2015 UTC,HYPE!!
denvernuggets,3b4yce,pairidaeza,10,Fri Jun 26 00:44:33 2015 UTC,Miami got the steal. We got a good pick
denvernuggets,3b4yce,pairidaeza,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:18:37 2015 UTC,Justise is pretty good but I still think Mudiay turns into the better play. Winslow is boom or bust. Mudiay at worst will be a serviceable PG.
denvernuggets,3b4yce,aatencio91,17,Fri Jun 26 22:42:55 2015 UTC,"Mudiay in, Ty+Faried to Sack City for DMC, Denver back into the playoffs, NBA CHAMPS 2016 woooo"
denvernuggets,3b4yce,pairidaeza,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:47:56 2015 UTC,One can hope!

denvernuggets,3b4yce,Neverethe,7,Fri Jun 26 00:30:27 2015 UTC,Ty hasn't gone anywhere yet though...
denvernuggets,3b4yce,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Fri Jun 26 01:30:04 2015 UTC,"True...Can't see him staying. Could happen, would be interesting."
denvernuggets,3b4yce,boysooj,5,Fri Jun 26 01:32:16 2015 UTC,Probably worth bearing in mind that Mudiay is 19...

denvernuggets,3b4yce,minutemandan,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:57:47 2015 UTC,"Mudiay does seem to have a good head on his shoulders, obviously hard to compare the two, but Ty hasn't shown much maturity or growth, let alone leadership.  Mudiay seems pretty humble/focused, so hopefully that is true and he stays that way!"
denvernuggets,3b4yce,kooredaan,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:59:55 2015 UTC,Mudiay moved halfway around the world as a young man and made it own his own. All while not having a superstar salary. I doubt Ty would have done as well in a similar situation.
denvernuggets,3b4yce,minutemandan,10,Fri Jun 26 22:52:17 2015 UTC,Welcome to the club!
denvernuggets,3b4yce,corybyu,7,Fri Jun 26 00:35:22 2015 UTC,"Man, Kings taking Stein was such a curve-ball. This steal was only matched by the Heat taking Justise.   What a good pick for us though! GO NUGS!"
denvernuggets,3b4yce,broncoboots12,9,Fri Jun 26 00:52:48 2015 UTC,I...I thought Justise Winslow would be the steal for us... I hope Mudiay is as good as advertised.
denvernuggets,3b4yce,Guardax,7,Fri Jun 26 01:00:37 2015 UTC,Whooooop
denvernuggets,3b4yce,I3IO_HAZARD,6,Fri Jun 26 00:42:34 2015 UTC,This has been a great day for the Nuggets. Tim Connelly is a level 80 draft Mage.
denvernuggets,3b4yce,Nugforlife,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:12:26 2015 UTC,What did TC do? Just waited around until teams ahead of him picked players and he picked a player that almost everyone had rated highly. I don't give TC that much credit.
denvernuggets,3b4yce,AlienDeg,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:02:36 2015 UTC,"He could have not taken Mudiay and taken someone like Kelly Oubre or Frank Kaminsky. Even if the selection seemed obvious, you get points for doing things correctly."
denvernuggets,3b4yce,JMadFour,2,Fri Jun 26 09:40:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, look at all the moves people made before us, I felt like the 76ers, Knicks, and Kings all made poor decisions given their situations, so he should get some credit for not making a mistake."
denvernuggets,3b4yce,BlackCucco,7,Fri Jun 26 17:01:15 2015 UTC,"Hate to see Ty go, but excited for Mudiay!"
denvernuggets,3b4yce,RadicalEucalyptus,10,Fri Jun 26 00:32:52 2015 UTC,Welcome to Denver Mudiay!
denvernuggets,3b4yce,Stank3,5,Fri Jun 26 00:36:46 2015 UTC,Best PG in the draft imo...
denvernuggets,3b4yce,tebam,5,Fri Jun 26 01:24:52 2015 UTC,Did anyone else here expect Mudiay to still be available when our pick came around? I for one did not and don't remember much talk if any at all about him being picked by the Nuggets.
denvernuggets,3b4yce,TheTriniTrin,4,Fri Jun 26 04:06:44 2015 UTC,Where can I buy jersey?
denvernuggets,3b4yce,neydeus,3,Fri Jun 26 04:19:32 2015 UTC,so now hopefully the Nuggets can pull off a deal for Ty that brings them back something nice in return.
denvernuggets,3b4yce,tylerthetiger,4,Fri Jun 26 01:15:12 2015 UTC,This draft turned out better than expected.
denvernuggets,3b4yce,Bigred27,5,Fri Jun 26 01:34:17 2015 UTC,"Ta-ra-ra-Mudiay, did you get yours today?  I got mine yesterday.  That's why I walk this way."
denvernuggets,3b4yce,tron777,3,Fri Jun 26 01:53:33 2015 UTC,Yeah you guys got a terrific pick at #7. Kind of a gem imo.
denvernuggets,3b7sp4,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Fri Jun 26 17:39:34 2015 UTC,This kid is a stud!
denvernuggets,3b7sp4,nickagain,2,Fri Jun 26 17:39:41 2015 UTC,So impressed. This kid is a pro.
denvernuggets,3b6atd,eathbau,11,Fri Jun 26 09:12:04 2015 UTC,"Mudiay is noted for his poor shooting and I don't want to start playing a rookie PG out of position.   Just let things progress. Heck, the off-season has only just begun. Who knows what the roster will look like next season.  If you want an injection of production from beyond the arc, I'm kinda hoping Jokic is that guy..."
denvernuggets,3b6atd,pairidaeza,2,Fri Jun 26 10:57:57 2015 UTC,"While this team has been a weak shooting team the past lots of seasons the truth is that even when we had Foye and Afflalo in the starting lineup we were STILL a really bad shooting team. Blame it on Shaw's system, but we have not had a top starting calibre SG since Iggy.  Many seem to forget that our 57 win team was an incredibly bad shooting team but was top 3 in the league in offensive efficiency. It was our downfall in the playoffs (lack of shooting) but right now we are a long way from having a playoff roster.  There will be growing pains with Mudiay but a starting lineup of Lawson-Mudiay-Gallo-Chandler/Faried-Nurkic is similar to our 57W one except Mudiay may or may not be a worse shooter than Iggy.  And I don't know why many are against playing Mudiay at the 2. When you're a 6""5 PG and the league is moving towards a faster pace and small ball you WANT to be able to run a 2PG lineup and make the most of Mudiay's physical attributes. It's good for his development."
denvernuggets,3b6atd,Neverethe,0,Sun Jun 28 03:01:22 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call it poor shooting. I would say he's mediocre in that part of his game at this point. But he's also 19 years old. He's got all the time in the world to learn his shooting.  But I do agree with not playing him out of position. I hope we trade Lawson and Faried for some help in other areas and just continue growing this young core.
denvernuggets,3b6atd,broncoboots12,2,Fri Jun 26 22:28:49 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be entirely opposed to it, but like you said, we would be an extremely weak shooting team. The Nuggets already aren't a good shooting team, especially since Ty seems to have lost his touch, so I don't think making the unit even weaker would be beneficial. Shooting is becoming increasingly important in the NBA. The top ten teams by FG% all made the playoffs, which isn't a coincidence. Even Memphis, who is renowned for its defense, finished 9th in FG%. Golden State and Cleveland finished first and fifth respectively in 3P% and both were able to make it to the finals. All but four teams in the lottery, Orlando, Sacramento, Miami and Phoenix, who was right in the middle of the pack at 15th, were in the bottom half of the league in FG%. Although there are abnormalities, teams that shoot the ball well win. It's as simple as that."
denvernuggets,3b6atd,Abiv23,2,Fri Jun 26 10:16:35 2015 UTC,"The defensive end won't be the problem for Ty/Mudiay backcourt (like you said Mudiay is big enough to guard 2s)  On offense, both are distributing/driving PGs, Mudiay in particular has  A LOT to improve in terms of outside shooting  The spacing would be really bad"
denvernuggets,3b6atd,nickagain,2,Fri Jun 26 15:37:31 2015 UTC,"If our FO is even considering this I'd be really discouraged. We have to let Mudiay develop and teaming him with Lawson would stunt his growth imo. If a lineup like that works during the regular season I still think it'd be a disaster in the playoffs. The thing I like about that lineup is we'd be flying up the court, which is obviously the way the Nuggets want to play. I just think they have to do everything they can do to deal Ty at this point. Hopefully they can find a deal they think is worthy."
denvernuggets,3b6atd,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Fri Jun 26 16:22:15 2015 UTC,Lawson has a lot he could teach Mudiay. I think it would be great for the kid.
denvernuggets,3b6atd,Neverethe,3,Fri Jun 26 17:04:06 2015 UTC,I'd like it if a lot of Ty's off the court habits didn't rub off on Mudiay.
denvernuggets,3b6atd,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Fri Jun 26 22:31:00 2015 UTC,"Sure, but I also don't take much issue with Ty's off the court habits."
denvernuggets,3b6atd,nickagain,2,Fri Jun 26 22:32:36 2015 UTC,I don't disagree with you. If that's the case I hope he's coming off the bench and leading the second unit. Just not confident in Ty (or Mudiay) off the ball I guess.
denvernuggets,3b6atd,treader19,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:07:52 2015 UTC,"i think it's a day after the draft.  from what Scott Hastings said, they were pushing to add a pick (8-14) after they made the mudiay pick, it didn't work out.  I think everyone has to look at their rosters now, whether they got the pick they wanted, or not, and now figure out, hey i need  PG, or a SG, how can we make this work?  I am always impatient, but if this is your job, and knowing that might happen, there has to be a plan for trades once free agency starts up and movement start to begin throughout the year."
denvernuggets,3b6atd,minutemandan,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:17:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's realistic to project a lineup of Mudiay-Lawson-Chandler-Gallo-Faried, but definitely not as a starting lineup. That's a small-ball lineup with enough shooting to stretch the floor for drives by the guards, rebounding with Faried, and speed in transition. That lineup would get killed on defense though.   If Lawson isn't moved, he'll probably be the starter. Connelly needs Lawson to perform well to remind executives that he can be a valuable player."
denvernuggets,3b6atd,splatterbuns,-2,Sat Jun 27 11:58:41 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said. I would prefer that both the team and Ty are willing to at least give it a shot.  As much as Cousins is starting to blossom, I am hesitant about trading two MOSTLY stable guys for a wild card like Cousins. I think it could end up being a disastrous trade on both sides really, but Denver would be taking on a pretty big risk I think with Cousins. I say trust the devil you know. See how it goes for one year and then re-evaluate before shipping Lawson out."
denvernuggets,3b6atd,Abiv23,5,Fri Jun 26 12:14:42 2015 UTC,"I am hesitant about trading two MOSTLY stable guys for a wild card like Cousins   Cousins isn't available for Ty + Faried, if he was i'd drive them to DIA myself...Cousins is that good (& under contract for 3 more years)"
denvernuggets,3b6atd,hayclaylaybaymaysay,2,Fri Jun 26 15:39:01 2015 UTC,"Cousins isn't a wildcard- he's the best Center in the league and he's like 24 years old (8 or 9 good years of All-Star basketball left).  If Denver had the #1 pick this year, I'd trade it for Boogie in a heartbeat"
denvernuggets,3b6atd,splatterbuns,4,Fri Jun 26 14:38:55 2015 UTC,I don't disagree that he's the best center. I'm talking about the fact that he seems like a head case.
denvernuggets,3b6atd,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:35:15 2015 UTC,100% knucklehead IMO.
denvernuggets,3b6atd,tommywood93,2,Fri Jun 26 17:04:43 2015 UTC,"Knucklehead? A little immature, sure, but who isn't immature in their early 20s? I guarantee you didn't have your life figured out.   Put yourself in Boogie's shoes. Since the Kings drafted him to save their franchise, they've churned through five coaches. Ty Corbin had the tactical acumen of a dung beetle. Paul Westphal and Keith Smart misused Boogie spectacularly. Karl openly hates him. Malone, the one competent coach Boogie has had, got fired because Boogie was sick and Malone couldn't win with the trash fire of a roster that the Kings' incompetent front office cobbled together.    Sacramento has played Boogie next to 11 different power forwards, and that's not considering players like Rudy Gay, who the Kings have used as a small-ball 4. Even if Sacramento stable at the 4, Boogie has said repeatedly (and correctly) that he has the skillset of a power forward and should play next to a center who can run pick-and-rolls and protect the rim. The Kings, of course, waited until they had irreparably damaged their relationship with Boogie to draft that guy.   Now consider that Boogie has played with 12 different point guards, only one of whom — Isaiah Thomas — was a capable NBA starter at his position. Because the Kings are the Kings, they let Thomas walk for nothing and replaced him with Darren Collison, a demonstrably worse player.   Finally, with a top-10 pick in every draft since it took Boogie, Sacramento came away with Nik Stauskas, Ben McLemore, Thomas Robinson and Fucking Jimmer. In this millennium, no organization in the NBA has so badly mistreated its superstar, or so spectacularly failed to build a good team around him. This shit in Sacramento is 99 percent not Boogie's fault, and to say otherwise is ignorant, man.     Free Boogie."
denvernuggets,3b6atd,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Fri Jun 26 19:04:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, he's a knucklehead. Only last season did he cool it off- but I'm not confident he can keep that up without strict observation.   Plenty of 20-something NBA players keep their head on straight without issue, but you're saying that's the norm?  I'm not arguing that he hasn't gone through a lot of shit, but I'm not certain he's that far away from JaVale mentally."

denvernuggets,3b5ude,MVBeard13,6,Fri Jun 26 05:26:53 2015 UTC,I've been thinking all along that the stuff used against Ty was taken out of context and that his biggest mistake was being an attention whore on social media.
denvernuggets,3b5ude,zoeyversustheraccoon,2,Sun Jun 28 22:36:29 2015 UTC,My phone won't play this. Can someone explain how it clears it up?
denvernuggets,3b5ude,SwaggyB23,25,Fri Jun 26 06:58:01 2015 UTC,"Ty Lawson in no way acted as if he wants to be in Sacramento or if he is confined to going to Sacramento in the video. He was talking from a Nuggets point of view.  When the Kings drafted WCS, one of his boys said you should trade for him, to which another said ""he's not as good as DeMarcus Cousins tho... He's an athletic running type"". To this Ty said ""That's what we want""  Lawson also stated ""We have next, the Denver Nuggets... Tim Connelly... do us good... do us good"" going on to say, ""they should get Justise Winslow, they probably get Mudiay, then I'm gonna get bunch of tweets about 'Ty you're getting traded'"" Moments later the analysts talked about the possiblity of Lawson being traded to Sacramento and Ty said ""Told you, I'm going to Sacramento bro""  Mudiay had not even been drafted at this point, so we don't know Ty's true feelings at this time, other than that he is a Nugget at heart, and has no idea what his future holds."

denvernuggets,3b4wj6,chazoid,3,Fri Jun 26 00:29:29 2015 UTC,WHAT A STEAL! HYYYYPE
denvernuggets,3b4wj6,Adamapplejacks,2,Fri Jun 26 00:43:45 2015 UTC,Pleased with pick.
denvernuggets,3b4wj6,jussumman,2,Fri Jun 26 00:25:38 2015 UTC,Think this is a great pick for you guys.
denvernuggets,3b4wj6,Beyoncessurfboard69,2,Fri Jun 26 00:28:21 2015 UTC,How the heck did he fall this far back?! Great news! Move him to the 2 and keep Ty pleeeeease
denvernuggets,3b4wj6,trentyz,3,Fri Jun 26 00:29:49 2015 UTC,hes not a great shooter.
denvernuggets,3b4wj6,trentyz,3,Fri Jun 26 00:37:10 2015 UTC,"That is true, I'm just so desperate to keep Ty that I'm blocking out any alternative hahaha"
denvernuggets,3b4wj6,Abiv23,2,Fri Jun 26 00:45:08 2015 UTC,Love this pick! Some life for the nuggs!
denvernuggets,3b4wj6,Kawnar,2,Fri Jun 26 00:35:38 2015 UTC,"This is the guy I've wanted for quite some time.. Never thought he'd fall to us. SO EXCITED!!  If he can develop his shot/finish through contact, you're looking at an all star."
denvernuggets,3b4wj6,teensonacid,2,Fri Jun 26 00:35:49 2015 UTC,time to move on from Ty. Very happy with this pick!
denvernuggets,3b4wj6,trentyz,2,Fri Jun 26 00:45:10 2015 UTC,Winslow would have been nice but that's only because I didn't expect Mudiay to go this low. Do you think we'll trade him in a package or keep him?
denvernuggets,3b4wj6,onesixtyseven,2,Fri Jun 26 00:51:09 2015 UTC,keep for sure
denvernuggets,3b4wj6,chucho320,2,Fri Jun 26 01:05:18 2015 UTC,I'M SO HYPED. Can't wait to build around him and Nurk.
denvernuggets,3b4wj6,clancydog4,0,Fri Jun 26 00:51:26 2015 UTC,"Mmmm, I can smell the stench of the Lawson era lifting."
denvernuggets,3b4wj6,chucho320,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:08:18 2015 UTC,"really, really not fair to put all of our recent shit on Ty.  he shoulda been a better leader this year, but he's really been a very good/our best player for a few years now and was probably our best player on the best team we've had in a long time - not to mention has been top 3 in assists and a solid scorer for years.  i think some fans are wayyyy too hard on Ty because of how disappointing this year was and the fact that he was the face of the team for that - and kinda botched it with the off court stuff.  but he's been really, really good as a whole for us on the court.  not cool how some of our fans are acting about this, imo.  ""stench of the lawson era"" is ridiculous.  he put up great numbers and we were fantastic under Karl - a lotta issues for our team have come from coaching and the FO - not fair to blame the last 2 bad years solely on Ty when he was fantastic for us for a while before that and still our best player these past 2 years"
denvernuggets,3b5le4,hayclaylaybaymaysay,9,Fri Jun 26 03:56:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I hope it pans out that way, at least for next year.  I was super excited when they made the pick, also because it meant we wouldn't pick him, and it made it more likely Mudiay/Hezonja/Winslow would fall!  I'm excited about Mudiay for sure."
denvernuggets,3b5le4,corybyu,6,Fri Jun 26 04:29:32 2015 UTC,"not really an ""extra"" pick.. we can only swap."
denvernuggets,3b5le4,Kawnar,6,Fri Jun 26 04:35:21 2015 UTC,"It's better than them taking Winslow or someone more NBA ready, but I think the real question is how well they'll do in free agency. If they get West and Monroe, they'll probably be decent, with at least 30 wins."
denvernuggets,3b5le4,Status_Flux,3,Fri Jun 26 04:35:39 2015 UTC,"If they get West and Monroe and Melo stays healthy that team could have a shot of making playoffs, especially with the way the East is"
denvernuggets,3b5le4,lwal,3,Fri Jun 26 07:07:29 2015 UTC,"Nuggets are likely rebuilding next season, our pick could be worse than the Knicks after free-agency shakes out...still, it's not a bad thing"
denvernuggets,3b5le4,Abiv23,2,Fri Jun 26 15:41:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's that raw. He played well in the ACB last year and I think his shooting and defense will keep him on the court in the NBA.  That said, rookies in general are not very useful for winning in their rookie seasons so I'm glad they didn't trade the pick."
denvernuggets,3b5le4,tron777,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:30:31 2015 UTC,Nah he's going to be a star
denvernuggets,3b5le4,maxypooh15,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:42:46 2015 UTC,Next year?
denvernuggets,3b5le4,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:46:50 2015 UTC,We have 40m in cap space. (assuming Calderon is shipped; which is looking very bright right now)  With the 40m we sign 2 max contracts and 10m center. We prob end up top 3 in east giving you the 26th pick.
denvernuggets,3b5le4,xarziv,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:13:47 2015 UTC,Lololololol
denvernuggets,3b51d5,IdRatherBeLurking,15,Fri Jun 26 00:57:05 2015 UTC,"Everyone needs to calm down. Watch the whole video.  Ty is mocking all of us ""analysts"" who assume since we drafted Mudiay that Ty is getting shipped out. He even expected the Mudiay pick. It's all good."
denvernuggets,3b51d5,d-lo_tha_boss,5,Fri Jun 26 04:58:03 2015 UTC,I can't believe people are overlooking this.  This is how it came across to me.
denvernuggets,3b51d5,jibvampxxx,8,Fri Jun 26 05:41:15 2015 UTC,Here's the full video. In context it's a full on joke.
denvernuggets,3b51d5,tron777,19,Fri Jun 26 05:15:05 2015 UTC,"Very unprofessional. I'll always cherish your time in Denver, but you gotta get your act right Ty."
denvernuggets,3b51d5,broncoboots12,10,Fri Jun 26 01:09:09 2015 UTC,it's not what he's doing but what he's saying that has me pissed off. If he had said something positive about playing with Mudiay then that right there is our leader. Instead we see/hear a spoiled brat complaining. I expect more from a grown man.
denvernuggets,3b51d5,teensonacid,3,Fri Jun 26 01:36:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he really shouldn't be smoking the hookah on video, but that's not what I'm talking about. What he said was ridiculous though. It's not like he wouldn't have started over Mudiay this season."
denvernuggets,3b51d5,broncoboots12,0,Fri Jun 26 01:39:43 2015 UTC,Come ooooon let's not get ridiculous.   What's wrong with hooka? Dude's a grown ass man
denvernuggets,3b51d5,Samcrates,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:26:27 2015 UTC,Fuck the hookah. Let the man live. But he's an arrogant dude and we don't want that apart of our organization. Times are changing and I only see growth. Now let's get boogie!!!!
denvernuggets,3b51d5,ksv4292,3,Fri Jun 26 03:02:36 2015 UTC,yea the hookah doesn't bother me in the slightest...it's the WORDS
denvernuggets,3b51d5,teensonacid,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:12:05 2015 UTC,Okay then...
denvernuggets,3b51d5,broncoboots12,3,Fri Jun 26 20:17:28 2015 UTC,what? really? that page wouldn't load for me
denvernuggets,3b51d5,teensonacid,3,Fri Jun 26 20:29:14 2015 UTC,"It looks like it was deleted...  It was a 5 minute video of him and his friends watching the draft. Right as we pick Mudiay he says, ""I told ya so, I'm going to Sacremento"", and then takes 3 big ass hits from a hookah.   So hard to watch.   E: Photo Proof :("
denvernuggets,3b51d5,OkAutopilot,2,Fri Jun 26 00:59:15 2015 UTC,"Woah woah, we need this video."
denvernuggets,3b51d5,OkAutopilot,2,Fri Jun 26 01:01:20 2015 UTC,Someone had to save it somehow...UGH.
denvernuggets,3b51d5,OkAutopilot,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:04:03 2015 UTC,All I can find is this tweet.
denvernuggets,3b51d5,Tasteofink410,2,Fri Jun 26 01:04:43 2015 UTC,This breaks my heart.
denvernuggets,3b51d5,teensonacid,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:07:06 2015 UTC,I mean how stupid can you be to do that while being filmed? Unless this is part of the Karl master plan to get Ty Lawson shipped off for incredibly cheap.
denvernuggets,3b51d5,pairidaeza,-1,Fri Jun 26 01:10:35 2015 UTC,Good to see he has his lungs in shape. Who cares good riddance
denvernuggets,3b51d5,tron777,-1,Fri Jun 26 01:16:35 2015 UTC,oh damn....why would he let that be filmed? man this relationship is over
denvernuggets,3b51d5,trentyz,3,Fri Jun 26 01:03:38 2015 UTC,:'(
denvernuggets,3b51d5,trentyz,6,Fri Jun 26 01:04:00 2015 UTC,"Wow. Expecting to be traded when a team has been rumored to have been trying to trade you and just selected a player that plays your position in the top ten. So... human of him. Ty's biggest crime here is not caring what people think. Which, in my mind, is not really a crime at all."
denvernuggets,3b51d5,FatLever12,6,Fri Jun 26 01:21:58 2015 UTC,This is hard to hear from my favorite basketball player :(
denvernuggets,3b51d5,AFatz,3,Fri Jun 26 02:11:57 2015 UTC,It's seriously upsetting me.
denvernuggets,3b51d5,AFatz,2,Fri Jun 26 01:17:09 2015 UTC,I'll support wherever he goes... But I'm a Nuggets fan through and through
denvernuggets,3b51d5,CPage12,2,Fri Jun 26 01:18:20 2015 UTC,"I can't root against my boy Ty. As a newer fan, he's my favorite Nugget."
denvernuggets,3b51d5,AFatz,2,Fri Jun 26 01:46:26 2015 UTC,"team is bigger than the player, except billups, he is a denver God. but I do love ty, got 2 of his jerseys. if we get cousins for ty/faried, it will ease my pain a lot."
denvernuggets,3b51d5,JMadFour,2,Fri Jun 26 01:52:22 2015 UTC,I didn't know you were a nuggest fan Lurking.
denvernuggets,3b51d5,Oshawut,5,Fri Jun 26 05:30:20 2015 UTC,Haha what's up! Nuggets fan for life.
denvernuggets,3b51d5,teensonacid,0,Fri Jun 26 01:36:26 2015 UTC,Don't think I've seen you outside the Naruto sub before.
denvernuggets,3b51d5,mitchdenver,7,Fri Jun 26 01:39:48 2015 UTC,I'm worldwide baby
denvernuggets,3b51d5,chucho320,2,Fri Jun 26 01:52:27 2015 UTC,For real? He's one of the most active fans on this sub
denvernuggets,3b51d5,Nugforlife,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:53:43 2015 UTC,We both read the Naruto manga. Always weird seeing someone you recognize in a different sub!
denvernuggets,3b51d5,ksv4292,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:38:20 2015 UTC,I don't visit this sub often.
denvernuggets,3b51d5,tron777,2,Fri Jun 26 01:43:05 2015 UTC,"whoa, he seriously said this?"
denvernuggets,3b51d5,BlindManBaldwin,-1,Fri Jun 26 01:51:20 2015 UTC,Check the video. I can't believe it.
denvernuggets,3b51d5,tron777,2,Fri Jun 26 01:19:05 2015 UTC,"Lowkey really wanted him to stay and prove all doubters wrong but after seeing this video you can def tell he's not happy here. Which is all good, best of luck to Ty wherever he goes"
denvernuggets,3b51d5,BlindManBaldwin,2,Fri Jun 26 01:21:50 2015 UTC,Here's the clip
denvernuggets,3b51d5,tron777,3,Fri Jun 26 03:52:41 2015 UTC,not impressed. he needs to go
denvernuggets,3b51d5,BlindManBaldwin,5,Fri Jun 26 01:10:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe I interpreted it wrong, but he didn't seem happy in that clip."
denvernuggets,3b51d5,tron777,2,Fri Jun 26 01:15:18 2015 UTC,"It's the reality sinking in for him that the Nuggets are done waiting for him to be a leader on and off the court.  After saying he wished he was playing in Dallas and everything else he's done (and not done) while representing Denver, he looks a lot more surprised and disappointed than I thought he'd be.  Classless, as usual."
denvernuggets,3b51d5,tilla23,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:18:53 2015 UTC,agree but he is killing his trade value with all these bonehead social media moves!
denvernuggets,3b51d5,tron777,0,Fri Jun 26 02:03:28 2015 UTC,What a fuckboi
denvernuggets,3b51d5,chucho320,2,Fri Jun 26 15:19:47 2015 UTC,Are the people that are upset about this the same people that wanted Demarcus Cousins on the team?
denvernuggets,3b51d5,OkAutopilot,3,Fri Jun 26 04:44:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not big on DMC, but I sure am sad."
denvernuggets,3b51d5,tron777,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:22:09 2015 UTC,"I'm on the fence about DMC, but I'm sad about what Ty is doing."
denvernuggets,3b51d5,JMadFour,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:23:37 2015 UTC,Please spell out to me his transgression.  Seems pretty tame to me.
denvernuggets,3b51d5,CasualBoner,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:41:33 2015 UTC,Acting like a spoiled child and being filmed smoking.
denvernuggets,3b51d5,OkAutopilot,2,Fri Jun 26 01:42:58 2015 UTC,Smoking!
denvernuggets,3b51d5,CasualBoner,2,Fri Jun 26 01:46:42 2015 UTC,is professional athlete
denvernuggets,3b51d5,tron777,0,Fri Jun 26 01:50:42 2015 UTC,Ok...
denvernuggets,3b51d5,OkAutopilot,3,Fri Jun 26 01:55:44 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why you think it's so crazy that people are concerned and/or upset about this?  A player who's been consistently criticized both for his ability to lead, as well as his conditioning/effort, was just captured -- and that's a generous term; it looks like he posted the video himself -- on film discussing matters that, frankly, a more professional player would keep between himself and his team, and smoking a hookah.  What don't you get?"
denvernuggets,3b51d5,tron777,2,Fri Jun 26 01:59:59 2015 UTC,I think the hookah thing is completely asinine. I've explained the rest here.
denvernuggets,3b51d5,chucho320,2,Fri Jun 26 02:19:58 2015 UTC,"It's not that he's acting human. He's a paid professional and he's paid very handsomely to carry himself and conduct himself in a certain manner. He's continuously spit in the face of the franchise. He's said he wished he played in Dallas, he got wasted at a team function and then drove home and got arrested for it.  He couldn't find the effort to report back to the team on time after a week in Vegas during the All-Star break, and with no good excuse.  He's constantly posting partying and smoking pics. He might be human, but he's not classy or professional. He can act like a thug all he wants in a McDonald's outfit. Guess how long he'd last at McDonald's with his hijinks. Especially if he tweeted that he wanted to flip burgers for Wendy's. It's time his apologists stopped giving him free passes."
denvernuggets,3b51d5,JanLevinsonGould,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:39:54 2015 UTC,I would hope people were more upset that Ty Lawson would let himself be filmed doing this. You think highly about a person and then a lapse in logic over and over kinda bums you out.
denvernuggets,3b51d5,fry_1,3,Fri Jun 26 03:12:54 2015 UTC,Doing what?
denvernuggets,3b51d5,The_Super_Deer,2,Fri Jun 26 01:24:33 2015 UTC,this.
denvernuggets,3b51d5,mitchdenver,2,Fri Jun 26 01:26:09 2015 UTC,What bums you out so much about him smoking hookah?
denvernuggets,3b51d5,teensonacid,4,Fri Jun 26 01:27:27 2015 UTC,/u/tron777: I have no moral objection to it but by all accounts he does it a lot and I'd expect an NBA athlete to not be a habitual or recreational smoker of tobacco/shisha and take more concern in their conditioning/health.  It also just isn't particularly professional to do that or to air out team business like that (which is why you never see players or coaches come out and say that stuff) while you're being video taped. He knew that which is why he took the stream down. You just want the guy who is supposed to be a leader of your team to be smarter and more mature about things.
denvernuggets,3b51d5,tron777,2,Fri Jun 26 01:26:12 2015 UTC,"Got it, I completely agree/understand where you were coming from. I thought you were specifically pointing out the hookah smoking."
denvernuggets,3b51d5,ihasroot,-2,Fri Jun 26 01:32:13 2015 UTC,"Eh, if the Nuggets can put him in every trade rumor possible I'd say he's allowed to joke about it. I don't mind my players being people.   And I can't think of any good reason why the hooka would be a problem. It's his life and his body. HAs he ever stuggled with on court fitness?"
denvernuggets,3b5rcp,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Fri Jun 26 04:54:29 2015 UTC,Nikola Radicevic upvote party!
denvernuggets,3b5rcp,tron777,5,Fri Jun 26 14:44:30 2015 UTC,"Raise da roof, guys!"
denvernuggets,3b5rcp,tron777,6,Fri Jun 26 14:47:59 2015 UTC,"He looks like Josh Kroenke's little brother.  Edit: Better yet, he looks like a Josh Kroenke and Tim Connelly love child"
denvernuggets,3b5jgv,pairidaeza,9,Fri Jun 26 03:38:03 2015 UTC,Whoever did this is lame. The witch hunt on Ty has been insane these last couple days. He legit seemed pissed that he thought he was getting traded.
denvernuggets,3b5jgv,zachtothejohnson,12,Fri Jun 26 04:52:09 2015 UTC,"He gets bashed for speculating like the rest of us? Well ok.. Watch the entire 5 minute video, and it wasn't even anything bad."
denvernuggets,3b5jgv,jennys0,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:11:19 2015 UTC,I don't know. It just seems unprofessional and immature to post something like that on the internet.  It's the equivalent of throwing a tantrum and tossing your toys out of the crib. Not exactly behaviour you'd expect from a grown man.  Edit: It appears I was misinformed. Like most /r/NBA as well...
denvernuggets,3b5jgv,tron777,4,Fri Jun 26 04:13:05 2015 UTC,"Nah, watch the full video. In context it's a joke."
denvernuggets,3b5jgv,d33p_blu3,2,Fri Jun 26 05:12:37 2015 UTC,Oh right. My bad.
denvernuggets,3b5jgv,kayeat,8,Fri Jun 26 06:11:00 2015 UTC,That makes our fan base look petty and unprofessional.  We are better than that.  As a Nuggets fan I find that embarrassing.
denvernuggets,3b5jgv,teensonacid,2,Fri Jun 26 04:33:18 2015 UTC,"I was fortunate to meet and talk with George Karl last year. we over lapped at a charity event that supports his foundation. Either way, he had very strong opinions on Ty. He said that Ty is not a leader and that he'd rather goof around than win. He's in it for himself and just likes to see his stat line more than anything else. Its tainted my view of Ty ever since, so im actually happy about this. Nuggs need a new direction for the team and a leader for the PG."
denvernuggets,3b5jgv,NUGGman,3,Fri Jun 26 14:10:52 2015 UTC,wasn't me
denvernuggets,3b5jgv,chucho320,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:42:09 2015 UTC,"Here I was going to post: ""Somebody""?"
denvernuggets,3b5lm2,Status_Flux,6,Fri Jun 26 03:59:05 2015 UTC,"I think that we keep him until at least the trade deadline. Why not give Mike Malone a chance with him? Malone is a players' coach and obviously has the ability to connect with anybody (See; Cousins, DeMarcus), especially malcontents. I think the Ty of the last 2 years is a result of hating Brian Shaw and hating losing.  I mean what do we have to lose? His stock literally can't go any lower than it is (okay, assuming he doesn't get another DUI or something equally stupid)- and letting Ty play as an audition for the rest of the league isn't the worst thing in the world. Plus, what if we surprise people next year and we're 30-25 at the ASG? What if him and Mudiay play really well together?   IDK, I think Ty is talented and that Malone has a shot to turn him around. I think it's a low-risk, high-reward gamble to keep him and at least try."
denvernuggets,3b5lm2,hayclaylaybaymaysay,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:12:41 2015 UTC,"YES.  Agreed 100%.  really hate the Ty hate around here recently - off court stuff aside, under a good coach, he has been a very, very good player - our best player, even.  Give him a chance with Malone.  I think he could be very good"
denvernuggets,3b5lm2,clancydog4,3,Wed Jul 1 04:21:27 2015 UTC,"We're being the point of no return with Ty. No way he is here next season. I think SAC is still the biggest option for us. Other than that, maybe Dallas will give us Monta and a pick, or Houston would give us Terrence Jones and a pick?"
denvernuggets,3b5lm2,MountCRushmore,2,Fri Jun 26 04:23:24 2015 UTC,I'm sure Morey has already offered the Jones + 18th pick. A little late for the pick now though. So I guess SAC is probably your most likely destination for Lawson.
denvernuggets,3b5lm2,PHaas03,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:32:21 2015 UTC,"As a Kings fan I would love to get Lawson as well as Farried who I heard rumors about a while back but not much as of late but I wonder what the Nuggets would want back in return for Lawson and what the Kings would give for him. We have a few guys like Landry, Williams, and Thompson that I would like to give up if possible."
denvernuggets,3b5lm2,HakunaMatata023,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:15:40 2015 UTC,"Landry, Williams, and Thompson   None of these players are assets, you watch them and know that.  You've been trying to shed Thompson's contract for years  It will take at least Ben/Sauce + pick"
denvernuggets,3b5lm2,Abiv23,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:13:51 2015 UTC,Oh definitely but I could see the Kings squeezing at least one of them in just to get them off the books.
denvernuggets,3b5lm2,HakunaMatata023,2,Fri Jun 26 21:25:24 2015 UTC,If this turns into a salary dump too the talent needs to increase coming from the Kings side
denvernuggets,3b5lm2,Abiv23,0,Fri Jun 26 21:45:49 2015 UTC,"Idk I could see the Kings being able to sneak in a salary dump or 2 without having to up the anti much. I like Lawson but it's not like he's a top PG and he's clearly not in their plans because they've been looking to trade him for a while now, I think giving up an unknown prospect like Stauskas and maybe a late draft pick or 2 could do the trick."
denvernuggets,3b5lm2,HakunaMatata023,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:34:08 2015 UTC,"No way he is here next season.   If the right deal isn't there, hold on to him, he's a borderline All-Star locked up for the next two years that someone will give up good assets to acquire  When a team like Sac that desperately needs to make the playoffs in the next two years to try and retain Demarcus (3 years left on contract) decides to send good to great value is when you sell on Ty  It's paramount to the rebuild that we maximize the return on our vets"
denvernuggets,3b52yl,minutemandan,10,Fri Jun 26 01:11:08 2015 UTC,"Everyone needs to calm down. Watch the whole video.  Ty is mocking all of us ""analysts"" who assume since we drafted Mudiay that Ty is getting shipped out. He even expected the Mudiay pick. It's all good."
denvernuggets,3b52yl,d-lo_tha_boss,0,Fri Jun 26 05:03:19 2015 UTC,Smooth.
denvernuggets,3b52yl,TaylorHammond9,0,Fri Jun 26 01:14:43 2015 UTC,Lost my respect for him
denvernuggets,3b45q8,richardallensmith,8,Thu Jun 25 20:38:45 2015 UTC,No!  They can't fire him until he trades Boogie to us and takes Lawson off our hands.
denvernuggets,3b45q8,chucho320,2,Thu Jun 25 21:50:51 2015 UTC,what a mess
denvernuggets,3b45q8,teensonacid,3,Thu Jun 25 21:57:28 2015 UTC,"Before anyone says it, no I would not bring Karl back as an assistant. His ego is too big and I see him as the type that would try to knife Malone in the back."
denvernuggets,3b45q8,eathbau,12,Thu Jun 25 21:38:22 2015 UTC,Karl is the active wins leader and already a Hall of Fane coach. Why would anyone think he'd work as an assistant?
denvernuggets,3b45q8,damb_b,7,Fri Jun 26 00:25:11 2015 UTC,Karl would never take a job as an assistant.
denvernuggets,3b45q8,TheSupergrass,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:10:22 2015 UTC,"If he does get fired, would it be the first time a coach got the sack before the season even began?"

denvernuggets,3b4zsu,10blast,9,Fri Jun 26 00:43:23 2015 UTC,Boogie!
denvernuggets,3b4zsu,JahScientist,-2,Fri Jun 26 01:16:52 2015 UTC,"You aren't getting boogie, lol. You guys don't have any assets to give Sac."
denvernuggets,3b4zsu,dolphingarden,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:10:33 2015 UTC,"Saying the Nuggets don't have any assets to give Sac is about as far from the truth as you can get.  Lawson, Faried, Gallo, and Chandler are all on the trading block, and in a deal involving Cousins, I'm sure even Nurkic would be on the table."
denvernuggets,3b4zsu,Wtfitzchris,2,Fri Jun 26 15:52:35 2015 UTC,"As much as I don't want to rain on the parade...we're not getting Boogie.  He's a top 5 or 10 player in the whole league, there's no way SAC would trade away that for a handful of non all-stars"
denvernuggets,3b4zsu,Samcrates,6,Fri Jun 26 16:50:10 2015 UTC,"I'd say no one, yet. Wait til teams are thirsty."
denvernuggets,3b4zsu,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Fri Jun 26 00:45:49 2015 UTC,Cauley-Stein perhaps? He could be a dominant back up for Nurk
denvernuggets,3b4zsu,trentyz,9,Fri Jun 26 00:55:24 2015 UTC,Nope. He has sickle cell. It's medically unsafe for him to play in Denver.
denvernuggets,3b4zsu,aatencio91,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:18:49 2015 UTC,"Aww, I was hoping he'd peak as as 21/10 guy in Denver!"
denvernuggets,3b4zsu,trentyz,2,Fri Jun 26 01:45:10 2015 UTC,"We should trade for DeMarcus, but I don't think that's happening without Nurkic or a third team being involved. Karl could just as soon be on the outs anyway. It's just a longshot. That said the Kings could still use Ty regardless of Karl.   McLemore and Stauskas could still develop, but the salaries still don't match. We would either need to take on someone else or replace Stauskas with a higher salary, which just means taking on their trash. Nuggets also need to strive for picks and I'm not sure the Kings have any.  Otherwise I'm thinking Houston or Dallas.  As long as we're talking about options to the proposed Boogie deal, as far as Faried goes, I think we could try talking to Toronto about that."
denvernuggets,3b4zsu,utw,2,Fri Jun 26 03:56:49 2015 UTC,Stauskas???
denvernuggets,3b4zsu,paledragon64,2,Fri Jun 26 05:12:29 2015 UTC,Keep him and hope we can trade him for a lotto pick at the deadline. His value is bound to go up.
denvernuggets,3b4zsu,with2nns,2,Fri Jun 26 05:49:45 2015 UTC,"Ty lawson for derrick favors, helps both teams. Favors is clearly better than faried and any frontcourt player on the nugs. Jazz need a pg and are looking to move favors in hopes that Paul Milsap will return to utah. Milsap could end up not going to utah and it would like to be a steal by the nuggets. Favors will be 24 by the start of next season so denver gets an excellent young piece."
denvernuggets,3b4zsu,Joshdonnie,2,Fri Jun 26 21:30:51 2015 UTC,Kings fan here. We can't trade future picks until we convey the one we owe Chicago.

denvernuggets,3b4a9y,teensonacid,3,Fri Jun 26 00:31:42 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of people on this sub want to see Ty get moved, but I would really like to watch a Mudiay, Ty two PG backcourt. A line-up with two point guards that can both get to the rim, drive and kick, plus a second PG that's big enough to allow for Ty to keep getting hid on defense would be fun to watch."
denvernuggets,3b4a9y,tron777,2,Fri Jun 26 00:30:05 2015 UTC,interesting point
denvernuggets,3b4a9y,tron777,2,Fri Jun 26 00:30:38 2015 UTC,I would love to keep both. I don't think Mudiay will have trouble guarding twos and Ty needs a break from ballhandling duties.
denvernuggets,3b4a9y,tron777,2,Fri Jun 26 00:35:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I commented above (as of the time of this comment) about how Mudiay could let them run a long defensive unit that can switch a lot, similar to what Golden State did this year (but probably not anywhere near as well)."
denvernuggets,3b4a9y,teensonacid,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:05:08 2015 UTC,Ty Lawson doesn't even want to play here.
denvernuggets,3b4a9y,TriceraScotts,2,Fri Jun 26 00:37:14 2015 UTC,"The only thing I saw that said anything like that was this article that said ""a source said"" that Ty and Kenneth would like to see a move made or a major coaching acquisition. Ty has been top 3 in assists the last two years. You can't replace that with a rookie PG.   Ty, Mudiay, Gallo, Faried, and Nurkic is a decent starting five. I realize some moves will change that between now and the start of the season. Also, maybe Harris makes a little bit of a leap and Mudiay can split his minutes between the 1 & 2.   As the roster currently stands, a Mudiay, Harris, Chandler, Gallo/Lauvergne, Faried/Lauvergne/Jokic lineup gives you a bunch of long athletic dudes that can switch pretty much anything. There are a lot of interesting things this current roster can do, and I hope things don't get blown up too much and we get to see it happen.  If I had my way, I'd like to see Chandler and Faried moved, with a decent PF coming back. If Ty does get moved, the cost of a team getting Ty better be taking on Hickson and his contract, or I will be furious instead of just sad."
denvernuggets,3b4a9y,teensonacid,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:58:04 2015 UTC,That doesn't change the fact that he doesn't want to play here. There's no point in keeping him for the next two years. Denver isn't a contender and it would be a waste to keep him when you can get lottery talent. This isn't even getting into his leadership issues. It's time to move on.   Either package him with a couple assets for Cousins or take a lottery pick. Both far better options than keeping him.
denvernuggets,3b4a9y,JMadFour,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:04:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I linked the only thing I could find stating that ""sources"" said he didn't want to play here. ""Sources"" also said he was going to moved to Sacramento this week. I think he just doesn't want to play on a bad team. Nuggs have potential to be decent next year.   They probably won't win a title, but honestly only like 4 teams really have a chance to do that. Ty has never demanded a trade or anything of the sort. If he had options around him last year, I think he would have averaged 12 assists a game, easy.  The lottery is over, and it looks like the Kings aren't moving Boogie anywhere, so what do you think is next? I'd rather keep Ty and see what happens next year if he can't be flipped or fa draft pick."
denvernuggets,3b4a9y,The_Super_Deer,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:21:06 2015 UTC,"The writing's been on the wall for Ty. His comments wishing he was in Dallas, tonight a video surfacing of him smoking Hookah and saying he's going to Sacramento....His skillset figures to fade once he loses his speed and athleticism. The roster as it stands currently is at best one and done in the playoffs, and it's still a stretch to see them making it. I think it's best for both parties to separate.   A trade for Winslow would be great. Or a pick next year."
denvernuggets,3b4a9y,The_Super_Deer,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:40:30 2015 UTC,"I'd rather watch a one and done team than a team that is losing for draft picks. I put a few words into those thoughts here.  I just want to watch a team try to win. For the last two years, watching Ty ball out has been one of the few bright- spots of this team. He's on a reasonable contract, and with Barton being an RFA, why wouldn't you want to keep him around? Erick Green can't handle starting point guard minutes, two years ago proved that Foye can't, and its very unlikely that Mudiay can right out the gate. You can't run without a good point guard, and not too many guards run better than Ty does."
denvernuggets,3b4a9y,aatencio91,3,Fri Jun 26 02:04:13 2015 UTC,"Seriously, where are the trades. It seemed like there would be tons of them from the rumors"

So if they improve on that, who knows what will happen?"

denvernuggets,3b4a9y,tron777,2,Thu Jun 25 23:56:38 2015 UTC,how many Centers do the 76ers need?
denvernuggets,3b4a9y,MisterSeaCucumber,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:56:38 2015 UTC,They're going to revolutionize the game and have a starting five of all centers.
denvernuggets,3b4a9y,broncoboots12,2,Fri Jun 26 00:00:51 2015 UTC,NOOOOO Orlando is taking Hezonja :(

denvernuggets,3b4a9y,nysom1227,2,Thu Jun 25 23:59:56 2015 UTC,I think the Kings will take him though

denvernuggets,3b4a9y,corybyu,2,Fri Jun 26 00:08:42 2015 UTC,Yay! Mudiay falls to us. Really surprised with WCS to Kings with the ankle issue and all
denvernuggets,3b4a9y,tron777,2,Fri Jun 26 00:12:04 2015 UTC,why won't they take Mudiay? They've got Boogie to play C. and he's young as fuck.  dont they need a PG?  does WCS play PF for the Kings?
denvernuggets,3b4a9y,teensonacid,2,Fri Jun 26 00:13:34 2015 UTC,aaaand all my streams have just shit themselves

denvernuggets,3b4a9y,teensonacid,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:15:25 2015 UTC,For what?
denvernuggets,3b4a9y,teensonacid,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:16:23 2015 UTC,That seems to be what the ESPN people are implying because he played under George Karl before.
denvernuggets,3b4pgr,12and4,4,Thu Jun 25 23:12:20 2015 UTC,The guy that runs the snapchat is super cool. A couple games I was sitting in the 300s he upgraded me to the 12th row.
denvernuggets,3b4pgr,tebam,2,Fri Jun 26 00:18:05 2015 UTC,"That's pretty cool. Went to the Timberwolves game in December and sat in the 300s, but the seats were still great!"
denvernuggets,3b4pgr,broncoboots12,3,Fri Jun 26 00:55:44 2015 UTC,"I know we've known about these jerseys for a bit now. Add them on snapchat, it's a nice behind the scenes to keep our sanity until the season starts."
denvernuggets,3b4pgr,broncoboots12,2,Thu Jun 25 23:14:43 2015 UTC,"They look a little different from the concept design, but I like them."
denvernuggets,3b4pgr,broncoboots12,4,Thu Jun 25 23:15:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'm just glad we got rid of the numbers. Identifiers have a way of making things less uniform.  edit: in all seriousness, I do not like them. It lacks subtlety."
denvernuggets,3b4aa0,TreBoyz,11,Thu Jun 25 21:12:22 2015 UTC,"Gallo is only overpaid if he injures himself again and doesn't perform at the level of the second half of last season.  Otherwise, the dude's a stud. He's our best leader, loves this city, and plays his ass off no matter what. He's also fun as hell to watch play."
denvernuggets,3b4aa0,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Thu Jun 25 21:16:44 2015 UTC,Agreed on all points. How can you not love this guy?
denvernuggets,3b4aa0,d-lo_tha_boss,2,Thu Jun 25 21:20:11 2015 UTC,100%
denvernuggets,3b4aa0,teensonacid,4,Thu Jun 25 21:32:50 2015 UTC,Not at all. People like Parsons and Hayward are getting 16 mill or so; Gallo is only at ~11 and imo he is on their level when healthy.
denvernuggets,3b4aa0,Status_Flux,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:29:46 2015 UTC,Agreed. And he's approx there age. Mabye 1 or 2 years older.
denvernuggets,3b31gl,HeartOfFeS2,13,Thu Jun 25 15:46:57 2015 UTC,Please do not trade Gallo Tim
denvernuggets,3b31gl,CPage12,8,Thu Jun 25 15:51:37 2015 UTC,Please don't take my Gallo!
denvernuggets,3b31gl,broncoboots12,5,Thu Jun 25 15:47:17 2015 UTC,This Gallo trade talk is really hindering my enjoyment of draft day.
denvernuggets,3b31gl,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Thu Jun 25 16:32:31 2015 UTC,I'm very confident we wouldn't trade him unless we got a really good deal. Wilson Chandler is more sought after than Gallo is.
denvernuggets,3b31gl,pairidaeza,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:59:06 2015 UTC,"Really testing my resolve, TC."
denvernuggets,3b31gl,Fooshbeard,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:27:23 2015 UTC,"How do you come to terms with trading a player you like?  Gallo, Ty, and Faried got me back into watching basketball again and it just feels like one or more of them are going to be gone this year."

denvernuggets,3b31gl,ParadeShitter,2,Thu Jun 25 15:47:58 2015 UTC,what would any team give up to sign a guy who only has 1 year left on his contract.... i'm guessing not a lot  any move to trade gallo is ludicrous imo
denvernuggets,3b31gl,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:13:22 2015 UTC,Jeff Green and their pick? I don't really know.
denvernuggets,3b333z,tron777,10,Thu Jun 25 15:59:15 2015 UTC,I don't think it's really possible to predict WTF is going to happen tonight because I think almost anyone is draftable and almost anyone is tradeable but here it goes.   Nuggets take Mudiay at 7. Nuggets trade Ty Lawson to the Pacers for their pick at 11 and draft Stanley Johnson with that pick.
denvernuggets,3b333z,IdRatherBeLurking,6,Thu Jun 25 16:10:58 2015 UTC,"Ohhh. Boner intensifies.  I'm dreaming of Mudiay dropping to 7, but it's going to take a stupid decision by the Knicks or a risky one by 3-6 to take Porzingis."
denvernuggets,3b333z,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Thu Jun 25 16:12:16 2015 UTC,"I didn't expect Mudiay to drop but I think it's actually going to happen. The Sacramento situation is the biggest wild card, who knows who will own the 6th pick by draft time. Honestly, other than our player's trade value, things seem to be shaking out nicely for the Nuggets draft night. I'm optimistic. And speaking of trade value, I don't think Connelly needs to trade anyone. He'll stand pat trading players if we don't get value."
denvernuggets,3b333z,The_Super_Deer,2,Thu Jun 25 16:23:06 2015 UTC,"And speaking of trade value, I don't think Connelly needs to trade anyone. He'll stand pat trading players if we don't get value.   Totally. Anyone we want to trade will be just as valuable, if not more, up to the All-Star Break."
denvernuggets,3b333z,chazoid,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:27:06 2015 UTC,You guys all predicted the future... holy shit.

denvernuggets,3b333z,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Jun 25 16:36:01 2015 UTC,"you listen to that BKDenver podcast with Connelly? If so can you sum it up for me, I can't listen to it right now!!!"
denvernuggets,3b333z,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:40:57 2015 UTC,Just started it. I'll give you a break down. I think it's more of a profile than anything
denvernuggets,3b333z,The_NGUYENNER,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:42:01 2015 UTC,"It's mainly a profile, which is really neat. I'll post the Nuggets related stuff here.   -Making free agency/trades much easier now that they have decided on Malone.   Calls Malone ""Mo"", has known him for a long time.    Yeah, a lot of it is about his history in basketball. Tried to get into coaching, went to scouting when that wasn't going to happen. I definitely recommend it! He's a pretty earnest dude that loves what he does. I was only able to get 2/3 of the way through before having to leave work for class."
denvernuggets,3b333z,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Jun 25 17:26:29 2015 UTC,"awesome, appreciate it Alec"
denvernuggets,3b333z,hayclaylaybaymaysay,2,Thu Jun 25 17:44:18 2015 UTC,"Haha If I was Batman, your ass would be grass my friend."
denvernuggets,3b333z,The_Super_Deer,7,Thu Jun 25 17:45:35 2015 UTC,"They'll be too busy laughing at the Knicks after NY drafts Kaminsky at #4 and forget that they're on the clock.  Ok seriously, I think we draft Hezonja/Winslow/Mudiay at #7, and then trade Ty and Chandler for another lottery pick. I think tonight is the night where our FO finally realizes that the NBA doesn't value our players as much as we do  Edit: If we draft Mudiay at #7, we'll trade Ty and whoever else we have to so we can draft Devin Booker. If we don't draft a PG at #7, we will draft Kaminsky with our other lottery pick"
denvernuggets,3b333z,growedup,2,Thu Jun 25 16:07:49 2015 UTC,I hope we don't trade Chandler :-(  Ty is probably the only player I can see leave
denvernuggets,3b333z,trentyz,3,Thu Jun 25 20:01:54 2015 UTC,"Trades aside, I think the Nuggets end up with Hezonja or Porzingis. If both of those guys are off the board that should mean Mudiay fell to 7 which would be awesome."
denvernuggets,3b333z,eg14000,3,Thu Jun 25 17:13:34 2015 UTC,"I think we'll grab Winslow at the 7 and make trades for Johnson. That means Chandler/Gallo will go, probably to Sac or Memphis. I'm hoping Ty stays, him and Faried are untouchable (I like them too much, haha)"
denvernuggets,3b333z,neighborly_troll,3,Thu Jun 25 18:31:01 2015 UTC,"I think we are taking Porzingis,  Are scouting is really good, and every good scout loves Porzingis."
denvernuggets,3b333z,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Jun 25 19:07:33 2015 UTC,Do you guys think we have a shot at trading for Boogie? My ideal situation tonight is a trade for Cousins and we basically swap teams with Sactown lol
denvernuggets,3b333z,Tskitishvili,2,Thu Jun 25 17:33:15 2015 UTC,"I think we have a shot of being involved in a Boogie trade, but I don't think there's a chance of him coming here."
denvernuggets,3b333z,CPage12,2,Thu Jun 25 17:57:14 2015 UTC,Is this a jersey alteration?
denvernuggets,3b333z,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Jun 25 19:28:41 2015 UTC,I'm intrigued
denvernuggets,3b333z,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Jun 25 20:43:59 2015 UTC,Here's the leaked 2015 adidas jerseys.
denvernuggets,3b333z,Tskitishvili,3,Thu Jun 25 20:50:16 2015 UTC,"The Nuggets pick Hezonja at 7, trade Ty to the Rockets for the 18th pick and some dudes, and pick Jerian Grant."
denvernuggets,3b333z,Ediblegoldnuggets,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:09:06 2015 UTC,I think we trade two players and gain an additional pick tonight. We'll draft Herzonja if he's available.
denvernuggets,3b5z5u,JMadFour,6,Fri Jun 26 06:24:58 2015 UTC,There's nothing preventing us from keeping Lawson. There's no gun to our head to trade him. If we aren't going to get anything for him we might as well keep him.
denvernuggets,3b5z5u,tron777,5,Fri Jun 26 15:03:55 2015 UTC,"There's still the possibility of a GM being over anxious and giving away far too much for a player that is clearly on their way out. (see: Melo to Knicks)  Of course, those were entirely different circumstances, but I don't see Connelly caving in too early and taking a bad offer for him."
denvernuggets,3b5z5u,Bigred27,4,Fri Jun 26 13:22:28 2015 UTC,"Well, he still has been in the top three for assists for a while now, so he still has pretty great value. I'm not too worried"
denvernuggets,3b5z5u,MountCRushmore,2,Fri Jun 26 12:36:12 2015 UTC,"Nuggets don't have to trade Ty, he's not a free agent this year and this season will about developing players so the win total won't lead to a panic trade.  Nuggs will get at least multiple 1st's for Ty and more likely a 1st and a decent young player"
denvernuggets,3b5z5u,Abiv23,2,Fri Jun 26 15:43:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think spending our 2nd pick on a PG really means much, he will be a project anyway.  You can have two great PGs on a team, and even play them together at some times, so if we can't get value for Ty, we can definitely still use him.  Having the two of them fresh will help us run too."
denvernuggets,3b36v1,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Thu Jun 25 16:26:08 2015 UTC,"Connelly's last line, ""We're looking at either a college player or a player from a Euro professional team"" was probably meant to be so all inclusive as to be a joke but it does leave out Mudiay so maybe my prediction is busted already."
denvernuggets,3b36v1,tron777,2,Thu Jun 25 19:47:40 2015 UTC,So are we going to call him Timmy or T-Con?
denvernuggets,3b36v1,tron777,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:31:31 2015 UTC,MC T-Con.
denvernuggets,3b36v1,d-lo_tha_boss,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:16:41 2015 UTC,T-Con-Deroga?  I'll see myself out.
denvernuggets,3b12d2,IdRatherBeLurking,32,Thu Jun 25 02:51:09 2015 UTC,I'm not ok with this.
denvernuggets,3b12d2,teensonacid,11,Thu Jun 25 03:07:16 2015 UTC,This off season hasn't been going the way I was expecting. Seems like we are trying to trade every one on the roster.
denvernuggets,3b12d2,BlackCucco,7,Thu Jun 25 03:08:16 2015 UTC,Faried and Lawson were expected this offseason and Chandler has been in rumors ever since he signed his extension.   You shouldn't put too much stock in the Nurkic rumors though.
denvernuggets,3b12d2,utw,9,Thu Jun 25 03:12:52 2015 UTC,I've moved to Canada and the only jersey I've taken with me is Gallo's :(

denvernuggets,3b12d2,pairidaeza,2,Thu Jun 25 03:10:32 2015 UTC,Wrong link :P
denvernuggets,3b12d2,hayclaylaybaymaysay,13,Thu Jun 25 03:12:09 2015 UTC,It's a fire sale.  Nobody is safe. Who would ever want to play in a situation like this?
denvernuggets,3b12d2,Tasteofink410,7,Thu Jun 25 02:53:26 2015 UTC,Money talks man. If you are one of the worse teams in the league why should any of the players not be tradeable? Nuggets are fortunate enough to have many players who would actually make an impact on another team. Lots of good but not great players n lots of good role players. We're a firesale dream. A different sport I know but look at Peyton. I know it would never happen but as management you have to explore EVERY option for your team. And if you were bad last year. You do whatever you think is right to make the team better. Can't get much worse than it is so I'm all in. Look at the Raptors man. Had a great season and their best players are up for trades right now. Most likely won't happen but they are exploring their options. Every team should do that. You never know when you'll get a god trade like the historic Gasol trade to the Lakers. So why not? =)
denvernuggets,3b12d2,NUGGman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:12:45 2015 UTC,Are you referring to Sean Payton and the Saints' fire sale? I almost forgot Jimmy Graham went to Seattle.
denvernuggets,3b12d2,aatencio91,2,Thu Jun 25 15:05:44 2015 UTC,"Probably to the Peyton Manning rumors that popped up Tuesday evening. Back in February, before the Broncos and Manning agreed upon a new reduced salary, Manning was involved in trade talks with the Houston Texans. Manning's contract now has a no trade clause, which means the talks could t have been much more serious than just gauging Peyton's value."
denvernuggets,3b12d2,NUGGman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:25:34 2015 UTC,Manning rumors popped up? I'm glad I missed that. I would have gotten all riled up.
denvernuggets,3b12d2,aatencio91,3,Thu Jun 25 15:33:49 2015 UTC,"Normally I would have too, but while the rumor popped up Tuesday, the talks happened in February, and since he signed a revised contract in March that has a no-trade clause, there's not much to be worried about."
denvernuggets,3b12d2,pairidaeza,3,Thu Jun 25 15:38:11 2015 UTC,Not like this
denvernuggets,3b12d2,vtmn_D,2,Thu Jun 25 02:55:25 2015 UTC,What would lead you to declare it's a fire sale when no one has actually been traded yet?
denvernuggets,3b12d2,pairidaeza,4,Thu Jun 25 07:42:55 2015 UTC,How dare you bring logic into this thread!
denvernuggets,3b12d2,NUGGman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:51:09 2015 UTC,"Trades that involve picks don't usually happen until after the pick is made.   It's a fire sale because ""everything must go"""
denvernuggets,3b12d2,aatencio91,2,Thu Jun 25 15:09:35 2015 UTC,I think it's an everything could go... For the right price. It should take a lot to move Nurk and Gallo.
denvernuggets,3b12d2,aatencio91,5,Thu Jun 25 15:26:25 2015 UTC,Ah god dammit. I just bought a Gallo jersey two weeks ago. Only $16 on eBay but still.
denvernuggets,3b12d2,with2nns,5,Thu Jun 25 03:24:26 2015 UTC,Well shit Unless we get Boogie I don't want this to happen.
denvernuggets,3b12d2,orangesoda123,5,Thu Jun 25 03:28:41 2015 UTC,Not Gallo. Please. :(
denvernuggets,3b12d2,MrFahrenkite,4,Thu Jun 25 03:33:58 2015 UTC,"Post-Anthony, Gallo was the reason I loved this team. I feel like either nothing will happen or we trade everybody this offseason."
denvernuggets,3b12d2,Th3Greyhound,3,Thu Jun 25 04:10:11 2015 UTC,No they can't
denvernuggets,3b12d2,Kawnar,3,Thu Jun 25 03:12:21 2015 UTC,I don't even care anymore. I'll just trust in Tim and hope for the best.
denvernuggets,3b12d2,treader19,3,Thu Jun 25 03:21:09 2015 UTC,"It's funny, prior to Karl leaving, the FO was like, we can do a rebuild rather than a restart, building on what we have here.  If Gallinari is available, and we're going to do a complete restart of the team, then lets get eveyone out of here.  You can't win with a bunch of alright players, you need a few big time players.  Get Ty, Faried, Chandler, and whoever else, and lets totally restart this team.  Tonight is going to be really interesting.  It really seems like hiring the coach should have come in way earlier so Malone has a better idea of each player, not just video, but personality, drive to win, etc.  It is all starting to make sense in regards to not hiring Hunt, changing the culture that was created here, and that might include just dismantling everything.  I don't want Gallanari gone, but if were going to do it, and we should have earlier, lets totally implode this team??? Can i get a HELL YEAH!!!!"
denvernuggets,3b12d2,aatencio91,2,Thu Jun 25 13:26:07 2015 UTC,"Yep, I'm on board. If they keep Gallo, that's cool, but whoever they get rid of is fine, too, as long as they get fair value in return, continue to draft well, and they don't fire Malone and/or Connelly in the middle of the rebuild. They could become exciting. Hopefully they won't have to be down as long as the Sixers have been."
denvernuggets,3b12d2,broncoboots12,2,Thu Jun 25 15:31:06 2015 UTC,The offseason has taken a turn for the worse.
denvernuggets,3b12d2,licoriceallsorts,2,Thu Jun 25 02:57:36 2015 UTC,Dalanaro for LeBron and nothing less
denvernuggets,3b12d2,dot-pixis,2,Thu Jun 25 06:38:17 2015 UTC,"The only reason I ever do this sort of thing in NBA2K15 with Denver is if I'm looking at free agents for the upcoming year. Gallo's 11mil contract could free up some spending money for free agents, which could be a really good thing. Plus we're slated to draft Winslow who, if I'm not mistaken, plays at SF... yes?  I love Gallo. But. I don't know. Nobody knows what's to come. But let's just, y'know, see what's to come."
denvernuggets,3b12d2,imhandy,2,Thu Jun 25 08:59:11 2015 UTC,"Even though Spears is reliable, I don't put too much weight into this at all and I would be very surprised if it's true. With Gallo playing so well at the end of last year but having such a tough injury history and large contract I don't see us getting anywhere near fair value for him. Plus Connelly said yesterday on ESPN Denver he wanted to have Gallo around. I could be wrong but I chalk this up to one of the many pre-draft false rumors."
denvernuggets,3b12d2,imhandy,2,Thu Jun 25 14:12:37 2015 UTC,"Samesies. And just because Connelly told another GM that Gallo isn't untouchable, doesn't mean he's on the trading block."
denvernuggets,3b12d2,Nugforlife,3,Thu Jun 25 14:14:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly, if the Lakers called up and said hey, we would make #2 available to you if Gallo were involved, of course that conversation has to happen but it doesn't mean we are trying to trade him or really even taking offers."
denvernuggets,3b12d2,eg14000,2,Thu Jun 25 14:22:32 2015 UTC,"Just means they are willing to listen to offers and if the deal is right, they would trade him..hopefully nothing comes of it being he is my favorite player on the team."

denvernuggets,3b1stu,bettycrockerpot,4,Thu Jun 25 07:38:44 2015 UTC,I don't even rate Yahoo for my internet searches so I'm not going to believe them for NBA rumours.

denvernuggets,3b1stu,eathbau,2,Thu Jun 25 08:09:29 2015 UTC,"It's also that time of year, where rumors and trade talks are 'leaked' by reporters to keep interest. No games are on, so it easy for a rumour to make traction.   Edits. I finished my comment."
denvernuggets,3b1stu,Ediblegoldnuggets,2,Thu Jun 25 08:25:05 2015 UTC,Or agents.
denvernuggets,3b1stu,BuickGrandNationalX,2,Thu Jun 25 14:23:27 2015 UTC,"This is both reporters and other GMs doing their thing. Notice how none of this is coming from Denver reporters, who have the closest ties to the organization."
denvernuggets,3b1stu,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Thu Jun 25 14:15:23 2015 UTC,I think this is the most likely but if PDA is leaking he knows a lot more than just the local media guys. I don't think it's out of the question that PDA is leaking stuff and I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. You can use the media like a tool as long as you're not causing discord in your own house.

denvernuggets,3b1stu,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Jun 25 15:08:06 2015 UTC,"Lots of teams make up nonsense to get a competitive advantage. For instance, if the Lakers say the Nuggets are only offering Faried and Lawson for Boogie, then it makes their shitshow offer of Okafor / Randle / Clarkson look way more reasonable.  The Nurkic thing...I don't even know where that's coming from. It's just such a stupid, stupid idea for the Nuggets that there's no way anyone who isn't a life-long Knicks homer came up with it."
denvernuggets,3b1stu,NickCiufi,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:40:21 2015 UTC,There have been rumors of Faried being traded ever since Karl left. I'm not sure where you guys got this idea about us being tight lipped.
denvernuggets,3b1stu,NUGGman,2,Thu Jun 25 15:02:15 2015 UTC,"Because Tim Connelly has told us that point blank multiple times, and I trust him. It takes two parties to make a trade."

denvernuggets,3az58t,d-lo_tha_boss,15,Wed Jun 24 17:48:40 2015 UTC,Nurk's potential alone makes this pick swap not worth it to me no matter who we'd be targeting at #4. I don't see why we would do this unless there's another deal being concocted with the Kings or some other team to further alter the roster.
denvernuggets,3az58t,Tasteofink410,6,Wed Jun 24 17:59:52 2015 UTC,Your point is spot on. The only way I see this happening is if we have a deal with the Kings to get the 6 pick. Or the trade would make zero sense to go up 3 spots and trade away great potential.
denvernuggets,3az58t,richardallensmith,0,Wed Jun 24 19:44:04 2015 UTC,Karl has an extra Boogie and wants a Ty. Take a PG at #4 and then make everyone happy. I'd take that deal in a heartbeat.
denvernuggets,3az58t,ParadeShitter,7,Thu Jun 25 01:57:14 2015 UTC,"russell might be worth it but, unless i'm missing something, there's no replacement for nurkic on the nuggets roster. wether nurkic pans out to be a top 10 center or is just serviceable for his career, the nuggets traded away all its depth at that position last season"
denvernuggets,3az58t,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Wed Jun 24 18:09:16 2015 UTC,"Kenneth Faried is our starting center, what are you talking about! Ha."
denvernuggets,3az58t,ParadeShitter,4,Wed Jun 24 18:56:32 2015 UTC,i dunno... you think he can beat out hickson for the spot? lol

denvernuggets,3az58t,richardallensmith,2,Wed Jun 24 19:29:18 2015 UTC,Boogie is the replacement for Nurkic after we pick a PG at #4 and send Ty to Sacramento.
denvernuggets,3az58t,eg14000,6,Thu Jun 25 01:58:16 2015 UTC,I would trade #7 and two firsts from Memphis and Portland for #4.  but Nurkic would be just crazy to me.  We don't know what we have yet.
denvernuggets,3az58t,rhinoman4,5,Wed Jun 24 18:11:48 2015 UTC,"I guess nobody is untouchable during a rebuild, but he's the ONE guy on the roster that I'd love to hold on to for a few years to see what he turns in to"

denvernuggets,3az58t,IdRatherBeLurking,7,Wed Jun 24 18:24:06 2015 UTC,"Ty for the 6th is about as good as I've seen it. Either the media is undervaluing us, or  other teams are, but all these trade rumors would cost us way too much."
denvernuggets,3az58t,BlindManBaldwin,4,Wed Jun 24 18:57:46 2015 UTC,"Only if Russell is still there, and he won't be so, no."
denvernuggets,3az58t,IdRatherBeLurking,7,Wed Jun 24 18:44:59 2015 UTC,"I'd only trade Ty+#7 for the #4, and that's only if we could guarantee that Russell was still on the board. The chances of Mudiay dropping seem to high to risk it.  But, when you think about the fact that we traded the 11th pick for the 16th and the 19th, it's not a bad return if you trade that 16th for the 4th pick. That's obviously not taking into account Nurkic's potential."
denvernuggets,3az58t,richardallensmith,2,Wed Jun 24 17:50:58 2015 UTC,So is the move to take a point guard at 4 and then flip Ty to GK for Boogie?
denvernuggets,3az58t,JanLevinsonGould,2,Wed Jun 24 19:56:42 2015 UTC,I thought I read somewhere else they wanted to rebuild around Nurkic and Galo
denvernuggets,3az58t,chucho320,2,Wed Jun 24 20:06:20 2015 UTC,Nope nope nope nope.  Not until Cousins is in powder blue and gold.

The 2009 team had a better record than the 2007 WS team.  Now, sadly, they are the biggest joke in baseball, not unlike the Nuggz and Kroenke being one of the biggest jokes in basketball.  Thank God for the Broncos and Pat Bowlen."

It will never happen again, no matter how good the team is.   And no, the Nuggets and Josh Kroenke are nowhere close to the biggest joke in basketball. That's just your sour-ass perspective. Especially compared to the Rockies, and you know this. The Nuggets, Josh Kroenke, and Tim Connelly are leagues above the Rockies in terms of league respect. We're talking about the Monforts here, Dan O'dowd here. C'mon, man."

Make no mistake, the Nuggets are awful and they will be awful again this upcoming season unless we do a complete retooling and actually pull off a miracle Cousins deal and TC actually does something with our conditional draft picks.  The NBA doesn't care about the Nuggets and we'll be back in the middle of the lottery in 2016. I hope I'm wrong.  I hate to sound so sour-assed."

That means the second half of that season was better than our entire season this year (and every year in Sacramento since 2007...)

denvernuggets,3aycdd,IdRatherBeLurking,6,Wed Jun 24 14:12:29 2015 UTC,"It's disappointing to keep hearing writers for a team site continuing to give Connelly shit for Gobert.  Here is the draftexpress mock for 2013.  Literally no one thought he would be this good. The Nuggets sold the damn pick for cash, literally any other GM in the league could have taken Gobert but somehow Connelly is more liable because the Nuggets originally held the pick. The decision to not pick a player at 27 and trade back for cash is the decision that should be judged. As Jeff Van Gundy says, call it while the shot's in the air. I wouldn't trade out of the first but it's a misdemeanor not a felony and we don't even know if it was Connelly or Kroenke making that call."
denvernuggets,3aycdd,tron777,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:42:28 2015 UTC,"He was mocked as a lotto pick for most of the year until he struggled in workouts. I considered it a travesty that we passed on him to sell the pick for cash instead.  I'm biased though, because I'm a heavy follower/supporter of the draft and had followed Gobert all year."
denvernuggets,3aycdd,AgaliareptX,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:11:29 2015 UTC,You followed him all year while he was playing in France?   By draft time he was considered a fringe first rounder by scouts and GMs in the NBA. You might have been excited about him but there were plenty of people excited about Green when we drafted him in the second. I'd link to the /r/denvernuggets thread deploring Connelly and Kroenke for trading away Gobert but none existed until last year when Gobert started playing well.
denvernuggets,3aycdd,tron777,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:34:03 2015 UTC,"Yup, as much as you can follow European prospects in general. And I can't speak to your last point since I'm on Stiffs most of the time, but some people there were pretty upset.   Gobert was basically the same situation to me as Fournier in 2012.. Sullinger and Perry Jones III were former lotto prospects available in the 20s and we passed on them. Same with Gobert. That's basically the exact opposite mentality I have on the draft, which is why I was so upset at the time.  Regarding Green, I remember Timmons was really high on him. I actually argued for Nate Wolters at the time. Guess it didn't really matter in the end."
denvernuggets,3aycdd,AgaliareptX,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:46:46 2015 UTC,"Here's the Stiff's thread. User youngthegiant called it with his 10:39 comment, and lots of people then go on to call him a crazy person. That's a pretty amusing comments section actually. You're in there too. Not repping Gobert but certainly decrying selling the pick on the cheap.  Anyway, my point is that it's a crapshoot that late in the 1st. I would never trade anything for cash because I'm not an owner, or work for one, but I wouldn't label it a travesty when so few of those picks pan out. I think the FO looked at the available talent and didn't see a guy they wanted to bet a roster spot on so they got a second rounder whose money isn't guaranteed. They were wrong, but so were 29 other teams."

denvernuggets,3aycdd,pairidaeza,2,Wed Jun 24 19:59:43 2015 UTC,"Just an FYI guys, the ""Media"" portion of the workout is really pointless as an evaluation tool.  I've been to three now and basically you get 5-10 minutes of watching a guy shoot catch and shoot 3's or mid range jumpers, free throws, and a few dunks just for fun.  So don't read too much into that at all.      The main thing anybody takes away from workouts are things like how well a player speaks to the media, how well they carry themselves, attitude, things like that and even that is kinda pointless in a setting like that.  So while it's a lot of fun to go and watch a guy shoot lights out (like Tyus Jones) or brick everything (like Winslow), I'd never put much stock into it at all."
denvernuggets,3aycdd,pairidaeza,2,Wed Jun 24 21:50:48 2015 UTC,"Only things I really took away from the workouts I saw:  WCS is super nice, personable, skinny, and laid back. Thus Jones is short, very articulate, polite. Myles Turner is really huge, looks like he can become ripped, looks way bigger than WCS, was super poised in front of the media (seriously, people ask some stupid questions, lol).  Oubre is really my height (6'5"") not 6'7"" as he is listed.  Really athletic, high energy in the workout, constantly talking.  That's basically all I take away. None of that is particularly useful information."

denvernuggets,3aum66,Tasteofink410,3,Tue Jun 23 17:15:47 2015 UTC,Especially if he is a Malone fan. Pretty interesting to see iggy and Melo come out like that. I knew they didn't have the best relationship but damn.
denvernuggets,3aum66,NUGGman,3,Tue Jun 23 17:40:10 2015 UTC,"It's an assumption that he's calling Karl a snake in the grass. Karl never said he didn't want to trade Boogie, did he? Vlade did. If they trade Cousins, wouldn't Vlade be the snake in the grass?  Edit: Also, how could Karl have been what Melo was referring to with his snake in the grass comment. He wanted to go to N.Y. and got to. It was probably just when they involved the Nets in negotiations and he knew he didn't want to go there.  Boogie is probably just mad that the Lakers are involved in the talks. He wasn't bitching when the rumors were he was going to return to playing for Malone."
denvernuggets,3aum66,NUGGman,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:40:28 2015 UTC,"It seems eerily coincidental that Melo AND Benedict Andre used the snake in the grass euphemism whilst headed out of Denver and away from GK, doesn't it?  This would be the third time an All-Star has tweeted that under GK.  I really liked Karl as our coach, but he would pull some serious head scratchers.  This would fall in line with that.  Yes, it's an assumption, but would it be a far fetched assumption?"
denvernuggets,3aum66,Tasteofink410,2,Tue Jun 23 21:31:25 2015 UTC,"Iggy didn't get away from Karl. Karl was gone before Iggy. They were both getting away from Josh though (Iggy and Melo) but that's not eerie for some reason...  Karl does make some head scratching moves. But he also has the most wins ever at 2 different places. I think he knows what he's doing. I also can't remember him ever lying about not trading someone, but GM's do it constantly.  We do have to assume something to make sense of it, but I think we need to keep aware of our assumptions."
denvernuggets,3aum66,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:57:07 2015 UTC,"That's pretty inaccurate.What did Josh do to Iggy or Melo besides pay them and do anything he could to make them stay? Melo drove his way out of Denver and to the big city. And there was something that pissed Iggy off towards the end of his tenure with the Nuggets. Of course Melo is gonna say it was a disagreement with management and that he didn't want to be apart of a ""rebuilding"" process except for the fact that he was pushing for a trade to a team that has been in the middle of a rebuilding process for years. So that explanation is just hypocritical. He just wanted to get to a bigger market. I could understand Iggy a little more since it wasn't his decision to come here really and was traded here. He played one year for us and obviously didn't like it for whatever reason but it's hard to blame Josh. George obviously didn't click him with. Pissed him off enough to go rogue during a pretty important playoff run. Sorry for the novel =/"
denvernuggets,3aum66,Tasteofink410,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:02:32 2015 UTC,Melo's tweet came two days after he got the trade he wanted. Iggy's was a year past his tenure here. I doubt either are related to Karl.

denvernuggets,3aum66,Ediblegoldnuggets,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:07:25 2015 UTC,I think it is. The times and events are so unrelated that I think it would take some extraordinary evidence that they all are directed towards Karl. It's not that uncommon of a saying.
denvernuggets,3aukdg,aatencio91,5,Tue Jun 23 17:02:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly I just don't see how we can get Cousins. They want vets apparently. We can offer some combination of Ty, Faried, Chandler, and Gallo, but then we're left in pretty much the same situation the Kings are in now, with young players, a few mediocre vets, and not enough talent to make the playoffs. Maybe we could be part of a 3 team deal that lands us some picks though."
denvernuggets,3aukdg,Status_Flux,5,Tue Jun 23 17:41:26 2015 UTC,"Nothing short of Ty/Faried and our pick would bring back Cousins  This won't happen, but maybe Ty for their #6 could"

denvernuggets,3aukdg,Abiv23,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:53:29 2015 UTC,"Very tempting. I'd miss Ty and Faried but having the 6th, the 7th, AND someone like Stauskas would give us a lot of flexibility and a nice new young core. We'd also be horribly short at the point - until we do something with those picks.  Edit: I like this an awful fucking lot. The ability to add two more players, players such as Winslow, Hezonja, Johnson or Mudiay, immediately takes our roster up a notch while assigning a whole lot more playing time to younger players in the wake of Ty and Faried...  Then there's even the prospect of packaging the 6th and 7th for an even higher pick.   Good lord. Somebody get me a towel."
denvernuggets,3aukdg,pairidaeza,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:40:07 2015 UTC,"Mudiay and Hezonja would make our core really, really good. Like, Mudiay / Stauskas / Hezonja / King J / Nurkic. All under 23. Throw in a Knicks 2016 lottery pick..."
denvernuggets,3aukdg,NickCiufi,2,Wed Jun 24 04:12:19 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer Jokic over Joffrey, just for his ability to stretch the floor.  Joffrey and Nurk kinda work in the same territory. Jokic is more of a stretch-4."
denvernuggets,3aukdg,pairidaeza,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:14:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think it matters much. That's a pretty darn good front court, anyway you slice it. Mudiay might be the best player in the draft, and I personally think Hezonja is the best guy in the class.  We probably have to take back Rudy Gay to make the numbers work, but a Chandler / Lawson / Faried for Gay / Stauskas / filler (Evans) trade works on paper. I'd say a trade like that really benefits both teams."

denvernuggets,3aukdg,NUGGman,2,Tue Jun 23 20:13:08 2015 UTC,"That's mostly due to the Steipen rule where teams can't deal draft picks two years in a row (you can however, sign a pick then trade them 30 days later...ala Cleveland and Wiggins last year)"
denvernuggets,3aukdg,Abiv23,2,Tue Jun 23 20:44:40 2015 UTC,"Good point. But, teams without that restriction still seem to wait to trade the picks. The Nuggets and Bulls waited until after the picks were made to trade last year. Might be just in case something funky happens in the draft and the player isn't there. They might already have a deal in place as long as Mudiay is still available."

Typically stars like him are traded for young talent, but apparently the Kings want vets, which makes it awkward. Love got Wiggins + Bennet, Melo got Mozzy, Gallo, and Chandler + picks.

denvernuggets,3asv5z,Bigred27,9,Tue Jun 23 06:10:19 2015 UTC,"Two ways for this to be GREAT for Denver. 1 - obviously, by acquiring Boogie, who is in my opinion under rated, superstar material.  Cornerstone piece material. Can win a championship with him as your best guy material.  2 - by getting involved in a 3-way trade with whoever gets Boogie. For example, Lakers get Boogie, Nuggets get the #2 pick and send away Ty and Faried or Ty and Chandler."
denvernuggets,3asv5z,icarus_adam,3,Tue Jun 23 06:56:54 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of Melo in Cousins. A guy who can score slightly more efficiently than average but who grinds the rest of the offense to a halt around him. He'll play defense for stretches but he doesn't want to, so as soon as you lose his attention for five minutes it goes to shit. Melo has a little more offensive upside with the triple and Cousins has a little more defensive upside with the height. Cousins also brings the ability to burn down your franchise at a moment's notice. I'd take either if I got them for nothing but I'm not interested in cleaning the cupboard for them.   I'm probably biased though, I can't stand Cousins."

I don't think he will ever even smell a Finals series, much less as the best player on his team. I do respect your opinion though.  I bet Sac wants to trade Cousins for the #2 pick in the draft and Randle, if they can. Their fans will go nuts if they don't get  a lot of value in return, so they can't be on the losing end of the deal, otherwise Karl will be out of town before he has a chance to show what he can do.  edit: Eric Bledsoe was on that Kentucky team too. If he couldn't win with that many great players and a great coach, people should question if it's for some reason that doesn't show up in the box score"

Gotta win 6 tourney games, 40 minute games, 35 second shot clocks. The game is designed to create upsets.  Boogie is a freaking beast and has been stuck in a horrible organization.

He was 7th in PER and EWA last year on a lousy team, 4th by ESPN metric ((Westbrook, Davis, Harden, Cousins, LBJ, Curry in that order) he's young and gets better every season, and by all accounts has become a much better leader as of recent. He's top 10 in defensive +/- and top 15 in all around +/-.  He's 24 years old and has upped his ppg, blks, steals, assists, rebounds, and ft% every single year he's played. 24! There are very few 24 year olds since the 1980s who have averaged what he is averaging."
denvernuggets,3asv5z,OkAutopilot,2,Tue Jun 23 17:00:11 2015 UTC,"Those are some decent supporting facts.

They were much more talented than any other team in college basketball that year, but lost in the elite 8. He had great stats then too.  He's been in the league for 5 years and the most wins he's seen in a season is the 29 they won this year. I can't think of ANY player who has ever won a championship as the best player on their team who couldn't manage to win more games than that in their first 5 years. It might have something to do with some things that don't make the stat sheet like basketball I.Q.  I do agree that he is a good defensive player though."
denvernuggets,3asv5z,NUGGman,0,Tue Jun 23 17:17:58 2015 UTC,"He was on one of the most incompetent teams/franchises in recent NBA/sports history those first 4 years. It doesn't seem like they're so hot now either. Don't forget Durant's first 3 years were 31 wins, 20 wins, and 23 wins."
denvernuggets,3asv5z,OkAutopilot,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:34:59 2015 UTC,"Nice try. He won 20, 23, and 50 his first 3 years.   But he did also shoot less than 50% for his first 5 years. Although, it's not as bad for a guard as it is for a Center to be below 50% FG%"
denvernuggets,3asv5z,NUGGman,-8,Tue Jun 23 17:59:22 2015 UTC,Get out of here Lakers fan.
denvernuggets,3asv5z,eg14000,12,Tue Jun 23 08:40:20 2015 UTC,"FYI that's Adam Mares. He represented r/denvernuggets at the Nuggets media day...  He's definitely not a Lakers fan.   LOL you noob. I knew I tagged you as ""Linsane"" for a reason :D"
denvernuggets,3asv5z,pairidaeza,6,Tue Jun 23 10:48:10 2015 UTC,"Ha!  Thanks for sticking up for me u/pairidaeza!  The Laker fanbase is probably my least favorite in the NBA and actually it would really suck for them to end up with Boogie despite crappy management over the last few years but if it lands Denver D'Angelo Russell AND Hezonja/Winslow, I'll take it."
denvernuggets,3asv5z,icarus_adam,3,Tue Jun 23 17:11:13 2015 UTC,"That's the Nuggets giving up Ty Lawson and Kenneth Faried for the 2nd overall pick. I'd do it in a heartbeat, and then I'd take D'Angelo Russell with the 2nd overall pick. The Nuggets have Nurkic, Jokic, and enough other guys at the 4/5 so I don't think they'd need to use that pick on Okafor."
denvernuggets,3asv5z,aatencio91,0,Tue Jun 23 16:19:04 2015 UTC,"Why do we need the middle man, just take Cousins instead of the second pick .  Any person that includes the Lakers in Cousins trade talks is just a Laker fan who thinks they can scam the league.  (or a reporter that thinks he can make money)"
denvernuggets,3asv5z,eg14000,6,Tue Jun 23 19:01:19 2015 UTC,"I commented on this before. This shouldn't be a surprise to anybody who followed Karl closely while he was here. It isn't because Cousins is a star that Karl isn't getting along with him. Also, he got along fine with Melo, but Melo wanted to play for N.Y.  Cousins shoots low percentage shots, long 2 pt shots similar to the ones that Shaw likes and Darrell Arthur likes to shoot. Karl would rather you shoot a 3 pointer, because only about 40% of long 2 pt shots go in, so you only need to be shooting 26% from 3 for a 3 pt shot to be a better choice. Unfortunately Boogie shot 25% from there.  I would think, of all places, Nuggets fans would understand that if George Karl doesn't want a player, then you shouldn't either. What player that Karl has traded away has ever been a mistake? Nene?"
denvernuggets,3asv5z,NUGGman,3,Tue Jun 23 15:15:05 2015 UTC,What player that Karl has traded away has ever been a mistake? Nene?   I miss that Brazilian bundle of joy.

denvernuggets,3asv5z,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:42:25 2015 UTC,Yeah he was. But didn't he stop looking soft as soon as he left? Maybe he's better suited to be a PF and it allows him to be tougher when he's matched up against smaller guys.
denvernuggets,3asv5z,NUGGman,11,Tue Jun 23 20:03:06 2015 UTC,"Dear lord,  Please send boogie to Denver, Amen"
denvernuggets,3asv5z,bettycrockerpot,11,Tue Jun 23 07:52:19 2015 UTC,I can dream. Nurkic at C and Boogie at PF. GET THE TABLES!!!!
denvernuggets,3asv5z,teensonacid,7,Tue Jun 23 08:29:25 2015 UTC,"Everywhere karl has coached he has feuded with and ran off all star talent. Carmelo Anthony, Kenyon Martin, Ray Allen, Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp, JR Smith, and those are just the ones I can remember off the top of my head. Veteran rotation players love Karl, guys with all star talent all grow to hate him pretty quickly due to his double standard, No surprise at all with what's happening between him and Cousins."
denvernuggets,3asv5z,eathbau,2,Tue Jun 23 09:52:19 2015 UTC,"We have the picks to make it happen, that's all you really need to know.  They won't Trade him, but if they do he's coming to Denver."
denvernuggets,3asv5z,eg14000,7,Tue Jun 23 06:21:05 2015 UTC,There is absolutely no way DeMarcus Cousins gets traded to Denver. No way. It just won't happen.
denvernuggets,3asv5z,pairidaeza,2,Tue Jun 23 06:24:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think he'll get traded, but if he does Denver has all the assets to get him. 3 lottery picks Ty Lawson, Kenneth Faried, and a couple pick swaps.  The money works and he's ours. No other team can offer anything that good unless they destroy their core.  We could even add more if neccessary.  (preferably not Nurkic)"
denvernuggets,3asv5z,eg14000,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:29:19 2015 UTC,"And what does Cousins coming here do for Nurkic's development?  The last thing we need is another big.  If the FO really wants to trade Ty away, I reckon we're better off looking to Sac for their sixth alone, or to NYK for their fourth while taking on Calderon and Hardaway."
denvernuggets,3asv5z,pairidaeza,7,Tue Jun 23 06:36:32 2015 UTC,"What?! Nurkic's development? We'll just play DeMarcus at power forward, he's a superstar what are you talking about."
denvernuggets,3asv5z,eg14000,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:43:15 2015 UTC,Let's just see what happens eh?
denvernuggets,3asv5z,pairidaeza,3,Tue Jun 23 06:47:30 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Nurkic, the Nuggets have to jump at the opportunity to acquire Cousins, even if it means including Nurkic in the deal or hindering his development. Nurkic has the potential to be an All-Star caliber player, but Cousins is the best center in the league and a true ""star"", which is something the Nuggets have lacked since Carmelo. Like I said, I love Nurkic and I don't see Cousins being dealt, but the Nuggets need to offer the house if it nets them Cousins."
denvernuggets,3asv5z,broncoboots12,6,Tue Jun 23 06:49:21 2015 UTC,And then what? We turn into a watered-down version of Sacramento? There's no way this happens. I just don't see it.
denvernuggets,3asv5z,pairidaeza,2,Tue Jun 23 06:49:54 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily believe it would turn us into a ""watered-down Sacramento"", but even if it did, is it that much worse than our current team? I also don't see this happening, but one can hope right? ¯_(ツ)_/¯"
denvernuggets,3asv5z,broncoboots12,3,Tue Jun 23 06:55:15 2015 UTC,I hope we turn Nurkic and Jokic into a badass frontcourt tandem and see Gallinari mature like fine wine. But that's just me... :)
denvernuggets,3asv5z,pairidaeza,2,Tue Jun 23 07:00:10 2015 UTC,"and see Gallinari mature like fine wine   Fuck man, me too. I just bought a Gallo jersey a couple of weeks ago. I only paid $16 on eBay but I'd like it to be relevant for a while."
denvernuggets,3asv5z,aatencio91,2,Tue Jun 23 16:29:36 2015 UTC,"I bought one the moment he came to Denver. And don't worry, he will be relevant for a fair bit longer."
denvernuggets,3asv5z,pairidaeza,2,Tue Jun 23 22:31:27 2015 UTC,Do you realize the Nuggets had a better record than Sacramento in the last 2 years with Brian Shaw.  Cousins doesn't guarantee success. You can't include Nurkic in that deal. A watered down version of the Kings is the worst team in the league.
denvernuggets,3asv5z,eg14000,2,Tue Jun 23 08:39:19 2015 UTC,Some good prospects in next year's draft to be sure. ....

denvernuggets,3asv5z,broncoboots12,2,Tue Jun 23 06:26:59 2015 UTC,He'll go to the Lakers or some other big market team in need of a franchise center. No way he comes to Denver.

Not all of them, but enough to keep the ball rolling since I think Cousins' people are probably involved in spreading the rumors, as well. But it's no coincidence they started kicking up as soon as he Nuggets got involved. Not that they ever needed convincing, but I think you have PDA who's probably one of the biggest proponents of a Boogie trade, leaking Kings intel to the FO and the media, while the Nuggets take advantage."

denvernuggets,3aqwi4,MileHighPride30,2,Mon Jun 22 23:07:13 2015 UTC,Well... except for the teams that play us
denvernuggets,3aqwi4,jd61,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:05:26 2015 UTC,Yep. Only heard it mentioned this afternoon on Sandy and Scott.
denvernuggets,3aqwi4,ParadeShitter,8,Mon Jun 22 23:14:10 2015 UTC,"Sickle cell and Denver and athletics do not mix well. Ryan Clark, former Pittsburgh Steelers safety, was held out of games in Denver because of his sickle cell trait. He found out about it because he played at Mile High.  From an article about Clark being held out of games at Mile High:   when he developed significant pain in his left side. He became gravely ill and ultimately lost his spleen and gall bladder, along with the remainder of that football season, as a result.   Seems to me like WCS is guaranteed not to be picked by Denver. He'd be in danger if he played here."
denvernuggets,3aqwi4,ParadeShitter,3,Mon Jun 22 20:00:48 2015 UTC,"well obviously the teams know about it. a. bennett also struggled/struggles with pretty bad asthma. all these prospects have been dissected, just because it's not common knowledge doesn't mean its being hidden. risk/reward, it might be part of the reason he's on the lower end of the lottery picks despite his talents and size."
denvernuggets,3aqwi4,MileHighPride30,6,Mon Jun 22 20:02:12 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it was being hidden, I was just surprised to learn of it after hearing folks around here say the Nuggets should go after him. He would be putting himself in harm's way if he played here. Ryan Clark, a safety for the Pittsburgh Steelers, played at Mile High in 2007 and lost his spleen and gallbladder due to complications that arose because he played in Denver with sickle-cell."

denvernuggets,3ar9k2,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Mon Jun 22 22:02:42 2015 UTC,Is that Mike Malone in black by the door in the background?
denvernuggets,3ar9k2,pairidaeza,2,Tue Jun 23 10:22:10 2015 UTC,Could be? Hard to tell. Could easily be Tim.
denvernuggets,3ar9k2,icarus_adam,2,Tue Jun 23 11:13:29 2015 UTC,"Tim Connelley and Mike Malone watched the whole workout together, side by side, both wearing dark. So I'm not sure which one you are referring to but both were there. As was Josh Kroenke. Malone actually came over and spoke with Tyus for a few minutes."
denvernuggets,3ar9k2,ParadeShitter,2,Tue Jun 23 18:07:11 2015 UTC,"lol  i'd be happy if we ended up with tyus, he's a gamer. great passer/shooter but probably projects as a backup PG at best. i'd be pretty upset if we ended up with him at #7 tho obviously."
denvernuggets,3ar9k2,icarus_adam,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:07:40 2015 UTC,"He may be a starter, he's only 19. He has a great shot and a high bball IQ. Could be a good pick up as a mid to late first rounder."

denvernuggets,3ar9k2,MileHighPride30,3,Tue Jun 23 18:20:35 2015 UTC,I'm assuming he might be a target if Denver trades Ty and ends up with a pick in the teens from either that trade or another (like Faried)
denvernuggets,3ar9k2,Bluemoon_95,2,Mon Jun 22 23:16:40 2015 UTC,"Is it realistic for us to trade for a mid teen pick and get Jones? OKC, Hawks, Celtics and Bucks are all teams that could use a player such a Chandler. Do you think its possible that we could trade chandler for one of those picks? If Jameer opts out we will need a back up point and this guy could add some scoring off the bench. Just a idea."
denvernuggets,3aqncw,aatencio91,3,Mon Jun 22 18:47:50 2015 UTC,Get a feeling that Winslow now won't be available as there are reports of injury concerns/risks regarding WCS.  DX and NBADraft now have WCS out of the top 10 which moves Winslow up.
denvernuggets,3aqncw,eathbau,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:46:50 2015 UTC,"I don't see WCS falling out of the top 10, but I wouldn't be surprised in the least if Winslow was gone by 7. Hopefully Hezonja is still available at 7, and if not, I think the Nuggets should reach a little and take Stanley Johnson."
denvernuggets,3aqncw,followthelawson,2,Mon Jun 22 22:48:38 2015 UTC,"Well if both are gone, then Porzingus or Mudiay is left, and I think we would pick Mudiay before Johnson"
denvernuggets,3aqncw,Crambulance,5,Tue Jun 23 00:24:15 2015 UTC,"For a team that wants its defense to spark fast breaks, Winslow is the perfect choice.    That fits exactly what Malone has talked about doing. He says they want to run (with efficiency) and they want a solid defense. While Hezonja brings some sexy shooting and high flying offense, Winslow seems like a more complete package, though his offense isn't as good as Hezonja's is."
denvernuggets,3aqncw,hayclaylaybaymaysay,2,Mon Jun 22 18:52:13 2015 UTC,I'm going to dread the typical crappy Nuggets fans whining on Facebook about drafting another foreigner. I think they are developing players better at a young age in Europe than they are in the U.S.
denvernuggets,3aqncw,ParadeShitter,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:03:43 2015 UTC,But Hezonja's offense hasn't had to perform against physical freaks every night in the NBA. There's every chance he could get shut down in the NBA (especially at first). At least we know Winslow would be good on the defensive end
denvernuggets,3aqncw,hayclaylaybaymaysay,4,Mon Jun 22 19:45:15 2015 UTC,"well to be fair, euroleague and the ncaa are quite comparable. winslow hasn't had had to compete against physical freaks every night either. that's the jump every rookie has to face. the young guys in the euroleague have trouble finding minutes but the talent is certainly there. you could even argue it's stronger in the euroleague than the ncaa because there's plenty of grown men playing overseas."
denvernuggets,3aqncw,OkAutopilot,3,Mon Jun 22 19:51:04 2015 UTC,"Winslow hasn't had to defend the physical freaks every night in the NBA. Yes, he played against good talent in the NCAA Tourney, but not exclusively NBA talent.  I do think Winslow is the safer pick, but if the Nuggets go with Hezonja I'll be fine with it, even if he does bust."
denvernuggets,3aqncw,Ediblegoldnuggets,2,Mon Jun 22 19:48:49 2015 UTC,"Me too, we need someone with star potential. I personally want Hezonja, I'm just playing devil's advocate"

denvernuggets,3aqfc1,bettycrockerpot,2,Mon Jun 22 18:16:12 2015 UTC,"This is what worries me though. I feel like Hezonja needs someone to slap him upside the head now and again and keep his ego in check, and Nurkic might get in the way of that"
denvernuggets,3aqfc1,Status_Flux,4,Mon Jun 22 18:19:09 2015 UTC,"Or Nurkic might be the guy who knows how to get to Hezonja and say ""sit down, you're making an ass of yourself.""  Also, Malone wrangled in Cousins, I think he could do the same with Hezonja."

denvernuggets,3apffy,pumadude321,6,Mon Jun 22 12:50:48 2015 UTC,The likelihood that either of the picks we get is better than #7 is pretty small. This is like a two birds in the hand is better than one in the bush situation. I'd hang up and be mad at Hinkie for bothering me with nonsense.
denvernuggets,3apffy,tron777,2,Mon Jun 22 15:07:51 2015 UTC,"Surely the Knicks wouldn't do this haha.  I'd love it of they did. But trading down to 7 and getting a probably late first round for number 4, when they want immediate help."
denvernuggets,3apffy,Ediblegoldnuggets,2,Mon Jun 22 13:48:27 2015 UTC,"They can still get a guy like Kaminsky then.  They need a big guy, and he'll be there.

denvernuggets,3apffy,Ediblegoldnuggets,3,Mon Jun 22 13:50:19 2015 UTC,Kaminsky doesn't look to be a centre who can make a defined impact for the Knicks. I could be wrong.  If they were given the 7th. I'd expect them to look at hezonja.
denvernuggets,3apffy,ParadeShitter,2,Mon Jun 22 14:17:56 2015 UTC,i don't think the nuggets are looking to stash picks anymore. at some point they have to take the shot and this draft seems deep enough to warrant trading back into it (finding another lottery pick) which makes me think it's unlikely the nuggets would want to trade out of it.

denvernuggets,3amb9j,licoriceallsorts,3,Mon Jun 22 04:21:24 2015 UTC,"I think Ty and Faried are getting traded, leaving us with a big 3 of Gallo, Nurkic, and Foye/Chandler. I don't see that team being better than Melo + 2 biggish name guys like Greg Monroe, Demarre Carroll, Wes Matthews etc + whatever else. That's just my hypothetical scenario though."
denvernuggets,3amb9j,licoriceallsorts,2,Mon Jun 22 02:22:27 2015 UTC,"If we trade those two guys we are getting something back, either Hezonja + Mudiay or a good player or two, I think we will be quite better than them"

I'm not as optimistic as you, I don't see how a team of those Gallo/Foye/Chandler/Hickson + rookies/sophomores will be better than Melo + 1 or 2 guys around Gallo's level."
denvernuggets,3amb9j,kooredaan,2,Mon Jun 22 04:29:34 2015 UTC,"Do the Knicks even have anyone other than Melo around Gallo's level? (an honest question)  It's a great debate, I also think that a lot of teams down the bottom will rise this year, from both conferences, so it may mean one or two teams are left behind, whether that is us, New York, the Lakers, it will be interesting"
denvernuggets,3amb9j,licoriceallsorts,2,Mon Jun 22 07:37:24 2015 UTC,He's assuming the Knicks trade for players around gallos level cause they don't have any right now.

denvernuggets,3amb9j,xarziv,2,Sun Jun 21 17:14:37 2015 UTC,The Knicks won't trade down with the 4th for any deal not involving Calderon. It is counter-intuitive for them to do a trade like this without getting him off the books.

Ty is 5'11, can't defend, is injury prone and will probably never get better then his average of around 15-17 and game and 9-10 assist. Although he has a lot of assists he also ball dominant and we dont need that in the Knicks. We also dont need his 12.5m/yr  TBH, you guys will get luck if you get any draft pick in the lotto for TY."

denvernuggets,3alyji,ParadeShitter,2,Sun Jun 21 16:09:25 2015 UTC,"They're picking at #7, but I agree that I don't think there's much chance Mudiay is still on the board.  Paige advocates trading up for him in his article, which I hope we do."

denvernuggets,3alyji,licoriceallsorts,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:16:18 2015 UTC,"Winslow is safer. Solid offense that won't wow anyone, defense that could make an immediate impact.  Hezonja has sexier offense, can play defense but doesn't always, is cocky, brash, and slightly selfish, needs to be reigned in, but could be a superstar.  Winslow should be a serviceable player at least, but Hezonja is boom or bust."
denvernuggets,3alyji,aatencio91,2,Mon Jun 22 22:54:45 2015 UTC,We NEED cocky
denvernuggets,3alyji,licoriceallsorts,2,Tue Jun 23 05:53:16 2015 UTC,"I agree. I'm also willing to accept a bust if it's the result of taking a chance on a guy who could be a superstar. With where the Nuggets are, it's hard to make the decision between potential superstar/potential bust and safe pick who probably won't be stellar."

denvernuggets,3al0oz,skipaBturner,12,Sun Jun 21 06:04:08 2015 UTC,It isn't if they think Jamal Crawford and CJ Wilcox will get it done.
denvernuggets,3al0oz,with2nns,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:16:04 2015 UTC,No but Crawford has an expiring contract and Wilcox is a decent prospect.
denvernuggets,3al0oz,vdowd,9,Sun Jun 21 06:21:05 2015 UTC,"We could probably get for Chandler what we got for AAA, a decent young player and a 1st. I'm not sure Crawford can be flipped for a 1st, and, really, I don't know anything about Wilcox, but hes going to be 25 next year and hasn't done anything, albeit with minimal playing time. I'd rather hold out for something more definitively better."
denvernuggets,3al0oz,with2nns,5,Sun Jun 21 06:30:15 2015 UTC,"What seems to be misunderstood in this sub in general is that we are never going to get great value for any of our players at this point.  Every GM in the league knows it's a fire sale. For instance, go back to February and offer the Kings Lawson for their 1st round draft pick. They would have accepted that in a heartbeat.  Now it's supposedly a laughable offer. This is what happens during a rebuild.  Its best to take on some expiring contracts and gain some picks."
denvernuggets,3al0oz,vdowd,2,Sun Jun 21 06:37:55 2015 UTC,There will be some team in playoff contention that will need a solid SF around the trade deadline and be willing to give up a 1st round pick.  It's just like how the Cavs needed Mozzy and the Blazers needed Afflalo.
denvernuggets,3al0oz,Wtfitzchris,3,Sun Jun 21 22:14:32 2015 UTC,"Chandler I think is a different beast, but regarding Lawson, I agree. He really stunk up the 2nd half last season with the Vegas debacle, DUI, and Shaw nonsense. We should keep him, hope he averages 16-17 ppg and 9-10 apg and stays healthy, both of which are likely imo, and we could get something like the #6 pick for him next year."
denvernuggets,3al0oz,with2nns,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:06:18 2015 UTC,"I wonder, would they even keep him all year or could they keep him until the trade deadline and then ship him out?"
denvernuggets,3al0oz,aatencio91,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:03:57 2015 UTC,"Chandler? I think they'd keep him, they need wing depth."
denvernuggets,3al0oz,with2nns,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:24:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I was not specific enough. I meant Ty, not Chandler."
denvernuggets,3al0oz,aatencio91,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:26:47 2015 UTC,I think so. I can't imagine Karl getting rid of him.
denvernuggets,3al0oz,with2nns,2,Mon Jun 22 19:30:30 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind is that Chandler's contract was only partially guaranteed for about $2mil next season, so we could have cut him if we wanted to save money. Instead we let the deadline pass and committed to his full $7-8mil or whatever it is for next year. So it seems unlikely that money will be a motivating factor of any Chandler trade.  In other words, that means this trade boils down to C.J. Wilcox, who, in my opinion, isn't enough to convince the Nuggets FO to deal Chandler. Remember, this is the same FO who's reportedly asking for more than just the 6th pick for Lawson.  Don't panic yet, folks."
denvernuggets,3al0oz,AgaliareptX,4,Sun Jun 21 08:32:18 2015 UTC,I'd like some JJ REDDICK.
denvernuggets,3al0oz,eathbau,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:51:25 2015 UTC,"In defense of that photo, he sells a lot of his shoes to RIF LA all the time. I have a friend that works there and offers me his stuff. I don't think him being there is any indication of anything."
denvernuggets,3al0oz,zachtothejohnson,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:45:43 2015 UTC,"Clipper fan here, I don't think we need Chandler if we land Pierce. And I'd rather hold onto Crawford anyway. By the way, just throwing this out there, I'm also a pretty big Nugget fan. Became a big fan of the team after watching the playoff run w/ Chauncey, Nene, Kenyon, Melo, Smitty, Birdman... you guys know. Anyway, best of luck in the draft!"
denvernuggets,3al0oz,ThatCoolKid17,-3,Tue Jun 23 20:42:54 2015 UTC,Why not? Wilson Chandler has never been a factor on a winning team.  He had some good games last year when the season was over and the roster was devastated by injury.
denvernuggets,3al0oz,vdowd,6,Sun Jun 21 06:15:19 2015 UTC,"Chandler is a good asset for us. He's a decently talented two way SF that would start on most teams in this league. I don't mind trading WC but i want to get good value for him, not interested in the pennies that LAC have to offer"
denvernuggets,3al0oz,vdowd,6,Sun Jun 21 06:23:12 2015 UTC,"I understand your point about his 2-way value. However, I disagree that he would start for most teams in the league at SF.  His player efficiency rating ranked 33rd last year for small forwards. Jamal Crawford was the 11th ranked shooting guard and came off the bench."
denvernuggets,3al0oz,FraserTheAmazer,7,Sun Jun 21 06:33:53 2015 UTC,"By ESPN's RPM Wilson Chandler is the 40th best SF in the league. Gallo is 22nd (Just ahead of KD at 23 lol). JCrossover ranks 53rd at the SG position.  I like this statistic rather than the PER as it actually accounts for defense plus what other guys are able to do on the floor while you are there, rather than just purely based on how many points/assists/rebounds you get.  http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/rpm"
denvernuggets,3al0oz,FraserTheAmazer,4,Sun Jun 21 07:22:36 2015 UTC,"Oops. I was ranking by WAR rather than RPM. By RPM Wislon is #51 and Jamal #58 at their respective positions.   Regardless, moving Chandler for Crawford is, at best, a lateral move. So in that case why not keep the guy who is younger, likes being here and is friends with Gallo?"

denvernuggets,3al0oz,OkAutopilot,2,Sun Jun 21 07:18:39 2015 UTC,"Nitpicking, but could you explain why you think Terrence Ross is flat out better than Chandler while Giannis Antetokounmpo is equal to him? That seems completely backwards considering both of those players careers thus far."
denvernuggets,3al0oz,jennys0,3,Sun Jun 21 16:19:57 2015 UTC,"Chandler and Giannis are definitely both better than Terrence Ross, who doesn't start."
denvernuggets,3aiur6,jhs9412,7,Sat Jun 20 16:49:30 2015 UTC,This game he looked like a beast
denvernuggets,3aiur6,The_NGUYENNER,5,Sat Jun 20 19:34:19 2015 UTC,"From what I remember he had a couple of pretty solid games, especially when Ty was out with injury and he got to play some good minutes.  I think he still needs to adjust to the NBA game, and possibly bulk up a bit. With Jameer opting out, and as of now not re-signing with us, I would think he starts playing a lot more.     When Ty wasn't injured last year I think he had short stints on the floor every game, which really doesn't help anyone develop their game"
denvernuggets,3aiur6,denverNUGGs,4,Sat Jun 20 17:08:57 2015 UTC,That's good news to hear. I hope he sticks in NBA. Any thoughts on his ceiling?
denvernuggets,3aiur6,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Sat Jun 20 17:47:21 2015 UTC,"I think if he bulks up a bit and maintains his confidence, he could be an alright backup PG that does a lot more scoring than passing. There were a few games where he came into the 4th quarter and lit it up, which we obviously would like to see more of.   It looks like he zeroed his shot in towards the end of the season, which is his bread and butter. His handling is adequate, but he's not great at running plays on an NBA level (yet). If there's one thing he lacks the most in my opinion, it's swagger."
denvernuggets,3aiszw,aatencio91,11,Sat Jun 20 16:33:01 2015 UTC,"The Nuggets used to have a semi-exclusive D-League team called the Colorado 14ers, who actually won the NBADL championship in their final season in 2009. However, Donnie Nelson bought a majority stake in the team and decided to move them to Texas to become the Mavs D-League team.  The Nuggets technically are affiliated with a D-League team right now, the Fort Wayne Mad Ants, but they share that team with 12 other NBA teams that don't have a sole affiliation with a D-League team. The problem there is that if the Mad Ants roster is full, a team that wants to send a player down has to send him to a single affiliate team, which of course has its own system of development that's probably different from their own. Until the Kroenkes can find someone who is willing to start up a D-League team, or are willing to pay out of pocket to operate their own, they'll be stuck with the Mad Ants.  As for the Summer League question, I'm guessing that they'll do the same thing they did last year, which is using a few young players from the active roster (Nurkic, Harris, Lauvergne), the rookies (whoever we draft + Jokic), and the rest of the team will be filled out by invitees that the Nuggets are taking a flyer on."
denvernuggets,3aiszw,Bigred27,3,Sat Jun 20 16:59:19 2015 UTC,Sup man! Long time-no see. Just wanted to add that we have two more of the roster spots filled by Ian Clarke and Jamaal Franlkin.
denvernuggets,3aiszw,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Sat Jun 20 17:55:19 2015 UTC,"Nothing much! Been a bit busy lately, but I still lurk and try to post occasionally.  That's true. I wasn't too sure what the eligibility rules are for the Summer League, but I'd like to see Clark and Franklin get some extended PT and see what they can do, Franklin especially given his reputation as a scorer."
denvernuggets,3aiszw,Bigred27,5,Sun Jun 21 19:08:37 2015 UTC,Thanks for helping to clear that up. I actually live in Broomfield only like a mile away from where the 14ers played. I didn't realize they won their league and I regrettably didn't ever go to a game.
denvernuggets,3aiszw,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Sat Jun 20 17:07:35 2015 UTC,"It's kind of weird, but we're technically affiliated with the Fort Wayne Mad Ants. I'm trying to remember who our last player was to play in the D-League, and I want to say it's Quincy Miller?  I think in general, they Nuggets would rather have their players just play overseas instead. While they get to play for an actual crowd there, you don't have as much control over their coaching as you would if they played for your D-League team. But then again, if your overseas players are European or the like, they probably feel much more comfortable playing over there than in some bumfuck-nowhere town in the States.  I would love it if we had one, though.  Edit: Doh, I just remembered that Green was sent down for a few games this year."

denvernuggets,3aewve,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Fri Jun 19 15:53:54 2015 UTC,"“Pete and I have always respected each other, have always gotten along,” Malone said. “It was just that sometimes, the environment that we were working in was not conducive to a healthy relationship.”   And then, to tie a bow on it, there's this dig on the Kings:   “What excited me about this job is, it’s not too many voices: It’s Josh (Kroenke), it’s Tim (Connelly), it’s me,” Malone said.   While there were obviously some issues, all this nonsense out of the Kings' media seems to be way overblown. It's funny how easily they were willing to destroy Pete, when it looks like it wasn't just his decision to fire Malone. If it was, I wouldn't expect them to ""continue actually growing their relationship""."
denvernuggets,3aewve,utw,2,Fri Jun 19 15:54:52 2015 UTC,There are no sides to take in the Kings' affair. No one version of events to trust over another.  It's not as if the Kings have no reason to push their side to Sacramento insiders and media of a trusting Vivek and a beleaguered coach taken advantage of by a scheming or incompetent (pick one) GM and advisor. It's pure spin like anything else that's come out.  There's only the real truth that lies somewhere in the middle of all the stories and the complicated relationship hexahedron that is the Kings that no one hearing it third-hand can hope to ascertain. The only parties who know best relevant to us are Mike Malone and Pete D'Allesandro.
denvernuggets,3aewve,fueldr,2,Fri Jun 19 22:39:59 2015 UTC,"Being outside of Denver now, I didn't realize this was a story. I thought pretty much everyone knew the Kings ownership group was putting a ton of pressure on the team to win and win now and that it was pretty common knowledge that the GM wasn't anything more than a puppet.   There is no way in hell the Nuggets would have hired both if they thought the two guys hated each other. That would be pure idiocy."
denvernuggets,3aewve,eg14000,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:42:49 2015 UTC,"No, of corse they say that.  What do you expect them to say, that they hate each other.  Somtimes you have to work with someone you don't like. If asked about it your going to say you like him to keep the job atmosphere positive."
denvernuggets,3aewve,kingsin4,2,Fri Jun 19 19:14:40 2015 UTC,"I think the important part is Malone stating,    “I’m not going to get into too many details, but I wasn’t worried about it because the reality is I would never had gotten an interview in the first place because Josh and Pete are close. Josh brought Pete back. If Pete was killing me, and Pete was saying ‘He’s a bad coach, he’s a bad guy, the players hated him, I didn’t like working with him’ they never would have interviewed me. Or maybe they would have gotten the first interview, but I never would have been brought back and sat in Josh Kroenke’s living room, petting his two bulldogs."
denvernuggets,3af3dc,TreBoyz,5,Fri Jun 19 16:43:59 2015 UTC,Of course.  Sacremento would jump at the oppurtunity.  Nuggets wouldn't want that deal though.
denvernuggets,3af3dc,BuickGrandNationalX,11,Fri Jun 19 16:54:35 2015 UTC,"I think if you'd ask /r/kings they'd have a much different response. Gay & Cousins are their foundation pieces, and the fans prefer Collison's fit on their team over Lawson's (too similar to IT2)."
denvernuggets,3af3dc,checkag,3,Fri Jun 19 17:25:16 2015 UTC,"I recommend against posting anything there right now, they're a testy bunch."
denvernuggets,3af3dc,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Fri Jun 19 17:56:42 2015 UTC,"Eh, not so testy. Especially when guys like Russillo are reporting that Lawsons not even worth a 6th according to GMs..even with that, the Nugget fans still want two 1st rounders for him.  I look at it this way: The Kings are not desperate to get Lawson. The Nuggets are desperate to get rid of Lawson. The Kings would be perfectly fine rolling in with Collison as the starting PG next season.   Don't put this trade scenario over there at /r.kings though. I don't think you'll make it alive.. downvote party for the ages!"
denvernuggets,3af3dc,jennys0,3,Fri Jun 19 20:02:29 2015 UTC,"The Nuggets are desperate to get rid of Lawson.    You would be wrong on that account, at least. Lawson has a strong history here, and just because we're trying to trade him doesn't mean we're desperate to get rid of him. I have little doubt that if he isn't traded now, we'll hang onto him until some contender is desperate enough to part with something we want.   I personally think that the Kings would be greatly improved with Lawson on the team, under the direction of George Karl. They worked very well together here, and Karl really knows how to use Ty.   I think these two sentences cannot coexist in the same comment:   Eh, not so testy.  I don't think you'll make it alive.. downvote party for the ages!"
denvernuggets,3af3dc,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Fri Jun 19 20:05:48 2015 UTC,"A lot testy lol.   I think the Nuggets really want another 1st round pick this year. I just can't see any lotto aside from the Kings being suitors for him. The Knicks would probably want you guys to give up Faried and a few other small pieces.   I just don't see enough for either side to agree. We would be a lot better on offense with Lawson. However, we'd be worse on defense. Lawson has to face up against Curry, CP3, and Bledsoe 4 times a year.  Defense is our biggest struggle and I think we would be ok moving forward with Collison.   Defense and 3pt shooting are the biggest two needs on the team. Just not enough there for the Kings to do the deal."
denvernuggets,3af3dc,jennys0,3,Fri Jun 19 20:25:11 2015 UTC,"I could definitely see us giving up Ty and Faried for Russell, potentially.   Great points!"
denvernuggets,3af3dc,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:26:33 2015 UTC,"People think the Nuggets are desperate to get rid of Lawson because of his stated desire to play in Dallas, his DUI, and b/c they almost traded him to Boston during the season. Whether they are desperate or not, I can't say. (Honestly, I think they should keep him)  And these rumors leaking out about trade proposals is making them seem more desperate."
denvernuggets,3af3dc,checkag,2,Fri Jun 19 21:02:53 2015 UTC,"Right, I get why people would perceive it that way. Ty said that after the team had their worst season in a decade, after the team staged a mutiny, and after him and the FO probably had some disagreements. But tendering trades and desperately wanting to get rid of someone are different. We desperately wanted to get rid of JaVale. So much so that we gave up a 1st round pick to do so.  That being said, I think that the Nuggets very much know how valuable Ty is to them on the court. His off-the-court issues really aren't that big of a deal in my opinion. None of it, outside of the day he missed because he was in jail that morning, has affected his performance. I don't have any doubt that he'll be back on track next season, no matter where he ends up."
denvernuggets,3af3dc,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Fri Jun 19 21:07:28 2015 UTC,"Just curious, why do you think that makes sense for the Sacramento perspective?"

denvernuggets,3af3dc,IdRatherBeLurking,7,Fri Jun 19 17:09:59 2015 UTC,Rudy Gay?  Are we watching the same player?  I'd take a player like ty 10/10 times over Gay.
denvernuggets,3af3dc,BuickGrandNationalX,3,Fri Jun 19 17:14:58 2015 UTC,"Rudy Gay had a really good year last yeah but uh... Gallo, Chandler, and Rudy Gay? Talk about overcrowding."
denvernuggets,3af3dc,OkAutopilot,2,Fri Jun 19 17:57:30 2015 UTC,"Rudy Gay average 21, 6 and 3.5 last season.  He's a very solid player.  But a horrible fit for the Nuggets with Gallo already there."
denvernuggets,3af3dc,IMDATBOY,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:55:38 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, he's decent, but Lawson is better.  Lawson was one of the top assist guys and he put up 15ppg... In the midst of Brian Shaw doing his best.  He can have a greater impact on the game.  Not only is he a little better, but he's a year younger and his contract is far more team friendly.  That's the key- about 12m X2 vs 20m X3.  Sacremento's FO would trip over themselves if Denver offered that deal straight up.  Of course, this rumbling about Lawson and his response to Shaw lowers his value, but rudy gay is payed like 1.5 players of his level, and lawson is the better player."
denvernuggets,3af3dc,BuickGrandNationalX,2,Sat Jun 20 17:48:52 2015 UTC,Lolololol.  Good luck running Gay in an upbtempo system.
denvernuggets,3af3dc,eathbau,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:27:18 2015 UTC,bad deal for us imo.
denvernuggets,3aea0g,aatencio91,3,Fri Jun 19 12:29:37 2015 UTC,I don't think we need a former player necessarily. I mean the main issue with the Rockies is that they've had the same guy at the helm for like a decade with failure after failure after failure. But they refuse to make a move.   There are a lot of guys in the association who have never played. So I'm fine with that as long as we don't keep guys around who aren't performing.
denvernuggets,3aea0g,seancolorado,2,Fri Jun 19 13:32:27 2015 UTC,"Just a note about the Rockies, they just promoted a new GM last offseason. Sadly nothing looks different whatsoever and he was a guy who was brought from the inside, but he is a different guy.  The biggest problem with the Rockies is meddlesome ownership. If Dick Monfort would bring in someone who knows what a baseball looks like, they'd become better in a handful of years (baseball takes longer to turn around, I think)."
denvernuggets,3aea0g,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Fri Jun 19 13:37:17 2015 UTC,"Good call, totally forgot. I don't follow them as closely as I do Broncos/Nuggs."
denvernuggets,3aea0g,FatLever12,2,Fri Jun 19 14:08:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need former people. If they are qualified and have experience, then them being a former would just be a bonus.  Roy and Sakic by the way aren't shining examples. They haven't done a bad job but their inexperience has shown with a ton of bad contract decisions."
denvernuggets,3aea0g,rhinoman4,3,Fri Jun 19 14:46:22 2015 UTC,"I think everyone is just infatuated with how well John Elway has worked out for the Broncos. He has completely taken control of that team and done some pretty amazing things, like signing the best quarter back in NFL history as a free agent.   Unfortunately, Elway is a pretty rare species. Sakic and Roy haven't done as much as he has, outside of winning over the fanbase. With Malone here, I'm not as certain we need a guy like Chauncey to straighten out the locker room anymore."

denvernuggets,3aciqm,utw,5,Fri Jun 19 03:44:24 2015 UTC,"I'm sure the Broncos sub was just as toxic around the time of McDaniels. That's the period we're in. I think you rather underestimate the Nuggets' position. It isn't a reaction to one off year, but a couple of them full of questionable decisions that totally changed the Nuggets' culture and took them from a perennial playoff team and possible contender (in its last year together) to one rife with doubt which faces an extremely uncertain future. I don't even agree a lot of the time with the opinions here, but all of what they do will be looked with an extremely discerning eye until they get back to that point and it's not always going to be worded so nicely.  No one said it isn't exciting, but the state we're in, it's not always going to breed enthusiasm and positivity. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that to the extent we need the lecture on how to act. Sorry, that's all I think these kinds of posts amount to.  Fact is I've seen little out of the ordinary. A lot of what you said is only relegated to one or two people. It's absolutely not endemic to the sub as a whole. Also keep in mind the finals to draft time to the offseason is always busy and emotional and will bring new faces who don't always know about etiquette and the culture here or the team."
denvernuggets,3aciqm,licoriceallsorts,2,Fri Jun 19 07:24:11 2015 UTC,"Wait.......  So you mean to say that now that we've fired Shaw (McDaniels) we'll sneak into the playoffs this year, and win a first round series off the back of Nurkic (Tebow), before signing LeBron (Peyton) and then making the Finals two years later?!?!?!"
denvernuggets,3aciqm,TriceraScotts,6,Sat Jun 20 09:55:53 2015 UTC,"I started typing this, and it got longer than I thought it would, so sorry in advance for the wall of text (and the impending rant).  I started hanging out in this sub like 18-20-ish months or so ago. Then it was a little smaller, and it felt like the people that regularly contributed could criticize the team without being overtly negative. In the last 8 months or so things seem to have changed.   I realize that everyone is frustrated with ownership and all of that, but here's the deal: not a single one of us can do anything about that because we aren't billionaires. Don't worry about shit you can't control. You can't get rid of the Kroenkes, and you'll never get rid of the Monforts.  People might hate this, but I see a lot of people in this sub complaining that, ""we will never win a championship. No free agent wants to come here. Our only hope is building through the draft."" But honestly, fuck that. That 57 win season was the most fun I've ever had watching basketball. Even if Gallo went down right before the playoffs, the entire regular season was great. For what its worth, the regular season is a lot longer than the playoffs and takes up a lot more of my time than the playoffs do.  I saw a post on /r/nba about how this was the first finals to not feature Dawayne Wade, Kobe Bryant, or Tim Duncan in a ridiculous number of years. I'm not going to look it up, because that isn't the point. Basketball is the hardest of the major sports to win a championship in, because a very dominate player can take over a series. Look at the Cavs. They were one half inch (all distances approximate) off a jumper from Iman falling out of bounds from winning that first game. If he hits that, maybe the Cavs go up 3-1 and win in 5. Maybe we are all watching game 7 tomorrow night. Who knows what might happen? Same with the 2013 Cavs Spurs series. Yeah Ray Allen hit an incredible shot in game six, but Tony Parker hit a falling down circus shot to (I think) win (or at least force overtime) in (I think) game 2 that no one ever talks about. Again, I'm not going to look it up, because that's not the point. Ridiculous things decide these games, whether they are injuries, made ""trick shots,"" missed spot ups... things come down to 1 or 2 plays that someone made a mistake on. That's a very small margin for error.  I guess my point is, this game is so fucking fickle that anything can happen. Maybe we finally land a top 5 player, and then he tears his achilles in game 36 and he's never the same again. Then what do we do? Watch while he plays as a shell of himself for the next 4 years?  I would much rather watch a team that is going to win more times than not, make the playoffs, and have a dark horse chance of of a deep run than watch some garbage team win 30 games a year. Not that many teams have won an NBA championship, and there are very good reasons for that. Why is everyone so obsessed with rings? So few dominate players get them. This isn't the NFL where an underachieving Giants team can luck themselves into two Superbowls. I would rather watch a quality team, night in and night out, and deal with the playoff disappointment than watch a team quit at game 43 (again, all numbers approximate).  Maybe you don't agree with me, and that's cool. Do what you've got to do.  TL;DR I'd rather like the things I love than hate and complain about them.  Edit: I accidentally hit save, and it posted earlier than I wanted it to because I started this on mobile.;   Edit #2: fixed some other obvious things, left some grammar mistakes, and thanks for the gold. I needed to get that all off my chest"
denvernuggets,3aciqm,denverNUGGs,6,Fri Jun 19 02:38:13 2015 UTC,"I'm super excited for this season.  I just love nuggets basketball, win or lose.  Shaw took the fun out of basketball these past few years so it's exciting to have a coach who wants to run, and be efficient!  This sub has seen an increase in activity it seems, which is great!  I've posted and lurked here for a few years now so it's nice to finally have some discussion.     That being said, remember we all have different opinions which are bound to clash from time to time.  I see people attacking each other, looking through post histories to attack someone's credibility.  I've laid off posting a bit lately because of it.  I just wanna discuss the nuggets with some fans, not be attacked for not wanting a certain draft prospect or liking a trade rumor."
denvernuggets,3aciqm,sleepydogg,3,Fri Jun 19 00:45:50 2015 UTC,"I think we're all a little bit stuck in the mentality of the season, which was really frustrating and disappointing.  Watching the Warriors and Andre Goddamn Igoudala win the chip didn't help, either.    A big difference between being a fan of the Broncos vs the Nuggets is the ownership/front office and how much success (or not) they are responsible for.  Broncos have been run extremely well for decades, which has led to a good on-field product (most of the time).  Nugs have been run by Stan Kroenke, who has a tendency to be...inconsistent in how he runs his teams.  Sometimes they get support and he seems like a great owner.  Other times, not so much.  In addition, Josh Kroenke and Tim Connely haven't exactly been awful, but they haven't made any real amazing moves yet either, so we are a little uneasy about the future.    I wouldn't worry too much.  Whoever we draft, we'll all convince ourselves is perfect for us, and by the start of the season we'll be ready to rock and roll."
denvernuggets,3aciqm,with2nns,3,Fri Jun 19 03:08:23 2015 UTC,"Is the Kroenke hate well-founded? I'm not sure about the timeline, but I think Josh took over for his father recently. Since then everything we've done has been good. Shaw was looked at as a good hire, the AAA  trade that brought him over looked good, and the trade that sent him to POR looks good now. Plus we've drafted great. I don't get the hate."
denvernuggets,3aciqm,hayclaylaybaymaysay,3,Fri Jun 19 03:10:44 2015 UTC,"This draft will change that.  I firmly believe Denver is going to make some aggressive moves UP in the draft and we are going to have 2 lottery picks next week. That will change everything about the attitudes in this sub. Personally, My guess is that we are going to draft Mudiay and Hezonja/Winslow/Johnson and that will call for a bright future and optimistic outlook from fans."
denvernuggets,3aciqm,Arrow218,3,Fri Jun 19 15:10:18 2015 UTC,"Last offseason everyone was way overoptimistic, I didn't see the playoffs but most people did. Chalk it up to overcorrection. Next offseason will be optimistic again, and probably will stay that way assuming we build a promising young team."
denvernuggets,3aciqm,eg14000,2,Fri Jun 19 00:35:33 2015 UTC,"I've only been here for the last 3 weeks and I am giddy with excited for the future. but one of the reasons this sub is so negative is the fact we are spoiled when it come for playoffs. We are desensitized to making the playoffs, we want to win it all. So we have a few below average years and everyone thinks we're the worst team in the league. The worst team doesn't have a positive reddit.  I personally don't think we're the worst in the league or were even close. We have a good front office, assets for the future and a lot of talent on the roster. It's just when you have a coach that doesn't inspire that talent in his players, you tend to forget that talent  exists.  The Nuggets probably will never win a championship in my lifetime. There are 30 teams shooting for the same goal every season and a lot of time it's the same team that wins most years.  But just because something is not probable doesn't mean it can't happen. I think the Nuggets will win championship in my lifetime. And it's next year, woooo!"
denvernuggets,3aciqm,chucho320,2,Fri Jun 19 03:47:08 2015 UTC,"You said it yourself that you're a casual fan.  I've loved (and loathed) this team for the majority of my 44 years on this planet.  They have been great, they have been horrible.  They've never been the best.  And after 4 decades of no championships and a ton of losing in the first round of the playoffs, you get a little chaffed.  Kroenke doesn't seem to have a clue, and TC has never built a winner, so my pessimism is at an all time high and it was all proved right this past season.  My opinions constantly get downvoted, but who cares? It's a meaningless point system that accounts for nothing in the whole scheme of things. I would still love to have a beer with every Nuggets fan in here and talk about our team.  I have no hate for anyone in here.  That doesn't mean I'm in love with every stupid move Kroenke and company makes.    Do I feel as if we're going to make another mistake and blow our 7th pick? Yup. Do I think we made the right move in bringing in a head coach with a losing record? Not exactly.  I'm rapidly running out of wait and see years.  The majority of negative comments are most likely from fans who aren't ""casual"" fans.  We love our Nuggets and we hate the direction in which they're going.  Voicing that opinion here helps us get though it.    I'm fairly certain that the optimists and the pessimists on here agree to disagree.  We all have the same hope and goal for our team.  But because the team is in such a shitty place, it won't be nearly the bromance that the Broncos sub is having.  You can be certain that if that sub existed during the McDummy years, it would be filled with as much negativity and vitriol as this one, if not more.  Don't mistake my passion for hate."

I mean... we collected assets for exactly this reason right?  but imo... Nurkic can develop to become every bit as good as Cousins, maybe even better. So I wouldn't give them Lawson and Faried in addition to that when I believe we can get a top 10 pick at least with those two. And I don't like the idea of trading Nurkic while his value is still on the rise, I don't believe that is maximizing our assets."
denvernuggets,3aas2d,The_NGUYENNER,6,Thu Jun 18 20:16:50 2015 UTC,This argument is going to make it seem like I don't like Nurkic. He's the last player on this team I'd want to see leave.  I like him a lot.   I just looooove Cousins. Homie averaged 24 and 13 this year. He was 2nd team all NBA. And he's 24.
denvernuggets,3aas2d,Samcrates,2,Thu Jun 18 20:36:50 2015 UTC,no man I definitely understand your side. Nurkic is a beast but you only get even the opportunity of getting someone like Cousins every once in a while. I wouldn't blame the FO in the slightest if they made the trade.... but there's just something about potentially having a core of Mario/Gallo/Jokic/Nurkic that intrigues me. And knowing that Ty + Faried could be used to get at least another top 10 pick just puts it over the top for me.
denvernuggets,3aas2d,The_NGUYENNER,2,Thu Jun 18 20:54:27 2015 UTC,"Ya that's the thing. I really do love Nurkic but Cousins is something else.   Also, that's a lot of Europeans to hitch the wagon to. Nothing wrong with them, but the 'long, athletic european guy who can't shoot super well'...I just feel like we see a lot of them that fail spectacularly.  But I totally agree with you, dump Lawson and Faried for another top 10 and see where it leads you."
denvernuggets,3aas2d,Samcrates,8,Fri Jun 19 04:06:32 2015 UTC,"Whoa. Lots of people joked ""Boogie to Denver"" right after Malone's hiring but I didn't think it'd really be entertained by the Kings.  If the Nuggets get Cousins, does that push Nurk and Jokic to the bench or to the 4?"
denvernuggets,3aas2d,aatencio91,13,Thu Jun 18 16:23:09 2015 UTC,"Not to be a condescending Kings fan, but I think the trade would push Nurkic to Sac. No way the deal would be Boogie for those two straight up, that's a robbery. I also highly doubt the legitimacy of this rumor though"
denvernuggets,3aas2d,IMDATBOY,5,Thu Jun 18 17:01:45 2015 UTC,"I think that's realistic, not condescending. It's also obvious that this isn't a good deal for the Kings at all. What I'm thinking is that the Nuggets leaked last night that they tried to trade Ty for the 6th pick but the Kings weren't interested, then today they leak that they tried to trade Faried and Ty for Boogie, so they're hoping that the two deals will be merged and it'll be Ty and Faried for the 6th.  How would you feel about that trade?"
denvernuggets,3aas2d,aatencio91,4,Thu Jun 18 17:04:17 2015 UTC,"That would be crazy. I'd love to have those two guys, but we obviously can't take those contracts without at least dishing some salary the Nuggets way. Maybe the 6th, Landry, and Stauskas to make it work, but I'm not sure how I feel about losing all that youth.   Edit: and good, I didn't want to be seen as condescending, but it's always dangerous posting in other teams subs haha."
denvernuggets,3aas2d,IMDATBOY,4,Thu Jun 18 17:13:19 2015 UTC,"If anyone thinks that Faried and Ty is good enough for Cousins, they're seriously overvaluing those guys. I do always manage to forget how big Faried's contract is so I didn't think about getting salaries to match up."
denvernuggets,3aas2d,aatencio91,-1,Thu Jun 18 17:20:03 2015 UTC,Boogie likes shooting long 2 pt shots. That's pretty much the shot that George Karl despises the most. That's why Cousins wasn't happy about Karl being hired.
denvernuggets,3aas2d,NUGGman,2,Thu Jun 18 18:41:57 2015 UTC,"Well not really at all actually. The moment Karl came to the Kings he had Cousins expanding his range to the 3PT line. If anything, Malone encouraged him to stay in the paint offensively."
denvernuggets,3aas2d,IMDATBOY,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:10:05 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying Cousins likes shooting the long 2 point shot and Karl probably wants to trade him and get players that fit his style more. Cousins shot 25% from 3 and that's not going to cut it for Karl. Who knows what they think is fair in return, but I don't expect Cousins to stay in Sacramento long.  Karl likes his big men shooting over 50%"
denvernuggets,3aas2d,NUGGman,2,Thu Jun 18 19:16:54 2015 UTC,"I just don't see Karl caring too much. The amount of outside shots Boogie took this year was less than before, and he took so few 3s that the low percentage hardly hurts, it was a late season development anyway. He survived with Faried, he can probably run his offense at a very high level with boogie. You do have a point to an extend, as a I wouldn't be awestruck if he was moved to make the team deeper or closer to the Nuggets, but I still doubt it will happen."
denvernuggets,3aas2d,IMDATBOY,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:36:42 2015 UTC,"I'm just giving you my opinion. Karl would have to get a lot in return for the fans to be o.k. with it, so it might not happen.  But generally, Karl's philosophy is that shooting 50% from 2 is equivalent to shooting 33% from 3. Long 2 pt shots are more like 40%, so unless you are worse than 26% from 3 you're better off just shooting a 3 than the 2 pointer.  Faried doesn't like shooting long jump shots (mostly because he's terrible at them) and has shot over 50% every year. He was actually closer to 60% than 50% when Karl was here."
denvernuggets,3aas2d,NUGGman,3,Thu Jun 18 19:50:06 2015 UTC,"I think that pushes Jokic to backup 4, Nurkic to backup 5 and the 4 spot when we want to go big.   I know it doesn't make a ton of sense, but I have a hard time seeing us with any starting lineup other than PG (who knows), Foye or Barton, Wilson at 3, Gallo at 4, Cousins at 5.   Even if we don't make a trade like this, I can't imagine the team convincing either Chandler or Gallo to come off the bench at this point."
denvernuggets,3aas2d,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Jun 18 16:30:04 2015 UTC,How's Gallo's defense? Is he more suited for the 3 or the 4? I know he's technically a 4 right now.
denvernuggets,3aas2d,aatencio91,3,Thu Jun 18 16:35:07 2015 UTC,"I think his defense is much better at 3, but he's at least got the length to contest shots from dudes like Aldridge."
denvernuggets,3aas2d,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Jun 18 16:42:27 2015 UTC,Doesn't Cousins want to play the 4 next year? We could roll with Cousins/Nurk.
denvernuggets,3aas2d,with2nns,0,Thu Jun 18 17:43:50 2015 UTC,"I expect Wilson and/or Gallo to be gone by next season, too. And hopefully Foye is included in some deal."

denvernuggets,3aas2d,OkAutopilot,11,Thu Jun 18 16:27:07 2015 UTC,How can you hate Cousins?! Dude is a stud and plays with an uncommon passion in today's league. He's shown really great signs of leadership and maturity since his first few years in the league too.
denvernuggets,3aas2d,aatencio91,3,Thu Jun 18 16:37:00 2015 UTC,"Why? From what I understand, Cousins was an uncoachable bitch before Malone, then loved Malone and quit being a brat."

We all know they can both play better so why not give them a chance to show it? If we do end up moving them, at least we would get more than we would at this moment."
denvernuggets,3aas2d,with2nns,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:31:14 2015 UTC,"With the way people have been trashing Ty I agree. I feel bad for the guy. If he went to a team out east, averaged 17/10, and made the all star team. I don't think anyone would bat an eye. That's someone worth at least a mid lotto pick. I'm not sure about Kenneth through. I think we were just overly optimistic when we signed him to that contract."
denvernuggets,3aas2d,NUGGman,-3,Fri Jun 19 03:04:39 2015 UTC,That's cool. As long as we turn around and trade Cousins somewhere. I'm never rooting for that guy.
denvernuggets,3aas2d,CPage12,2,Thu Jun 18 18:40:28 2015 UTC,Why not? He loved playing for Malone and behaved well under him. Boogie's a stud

denvernuggets,3ab9qt,aatencio91,7,Thu Jun 18 18:24:21 2015 UTC,"I am getting more and more sold on this dude. He seems very boom-or-bust. At this point, the Nuggets need to take risks and be willing to gamble. Hezonja can shoot, he's firey, and if anyone can wrangle him, I'm willing to bet that Michael Malone can."
denvernuggets,3ab9qt,vdowd,3,Thu Jun 18 18:25:48 2015 UTC,I would take cocky over not giving a shit (like players on our current roster) any day.
denvernuggets,3ab9qt,armatron444,2,Fri Jun 19 07:27:22 2015 UTC,This guy fucks.
denvernuggets,3ab9qt,eg14000,2,Fri Jun 19 00:42:19 2015 UTC,"Sounds more like a cocky kid, than a superstar.  When he comes to the nba he is going to be humbled.  I don't know how he will react to that.  If you want smart cocky, listen to Stanley Johnson's interviews.  He doesn't need to trash talk, he just simply believes he's the best."
denvernuggets,3ab9qt,eg14000,3,Thu Jun 18 18:34:04 2015 UTC,"I do really like Stanley Johnson, too. I'd be very happy with any of the three wings at 7. Give me any of Winslow, Hezonja, and Johnson, and I'll be fine."
denvernuggets,3ab9qt,Ediblegoldnuggets,2,Thu Jun 18 18:39:27 2015 UTC,"I think we had this conversation before,  but saying you would like any three of these players is like saying before the 2009 draft that I would like  any of the three point guards available, Ricky Rubio, Flin, and Steph Curry.  It's very likely only one of wings you like will become great.  I choose Stanley Johnson in my amateur opinion.  Who do you choose?"
denvernuggets,3ab9qt,eg14000,3,Thu Jun 18 19:09:57 2015 UTC,"Something about Johnson jumps out to me. He's got an intangible ""it factor"" when I watch his tape. Winslow isn't disappointing by any means, and Hezonja is more versatile offensively, but I love Johnson's defensive flashes and his work ethic makes me feel safe about his offense, even though there are questions about his jumper."
denvernuggets,3ab9qt,Ediblegoldnuggets,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:13:01 2015 UTC,The difference between cocky kid an superstar is age and talent. Mario's got the talent and the drive. He's just young.

denvernuggets,3aay3l,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:03:47 2015 UTC,"No. Crawford is pretty much useless and I don't really have any desire for Wilcox, especially considering we're going to have Gary Harris and Hezonja/Winslow/Johnson at a minimum at the 2 spot"

Edit: I don't think the Clippers are trying to unload Crawford because he sucks as much as they need a defensive specialist now that they traded Barnes and Chandler is very good at defense."

denvernuggets,3ab27c,pocketmonsters,3,Thu Jun 18 17:29:54 2015 UTC,"I would probably say this is a bit overblown. Ty only played poorly for half a season, and his off-the-court issues are pretty minimal compared to other players with problems.  I would be perfectly okay with holding onto him for half a season until teams start getting desperate again."
denvernuggets,3ab27c,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Thu Jun 18 17:32:05 2015 UTC,"i think it has more to do with a player favored contract, the position depth in the league and general thoughts on the direction of it for the future. ty's a pretty good passer, an okay scorer and a pretty bad defender. he's not the ""leader"" type but he's one of the higher paid PG's in the league. he has value but his ROI wouldn't be much if the kings gave up the #6 pick for him"
denvernuggets,3ab27c,ParadeShitter,2,Thu Jun 18 17:39:17 2015 UTC,This has to do more than just his play. This has to do with off the court stuff as well. His behavior off the court as well as his attitude on it as well. He's posting instagram videos with weed in it. He misses first practice back from all star break from partying to hard. Ty is a good player. He isn't great enough to be acting like that though.
denvernuggets,3ab27c,Tasteofink410,4,Thu Jun 18 20:23:24 2015 UTC,"Again, I don't put as much weight against those issues as others. I don't think any of his off the court issues have affected his play.  I also don't wholly blame him for giving up on Shaw, but guys like Gallo show that you can simply play your best for the sake of playing your best. I think that's more of a credit to Gallo than a discredit to Ty, though."
denvernuggets,3ab27c,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Jun 18 20:26:49 2015 UTC,I don't think he posted any videos with weed. There was a hookah once but molasses tobacco (sheesha) is smoked out of that
denvernuggets,3aba27,eg14000,3,Thu Jun 18 18:26:32 2015 UTC,Could be that they're leaking this info to spark trade talks. Basically they're letting other teams know that they're open to negotiations.
denvernuggets,3aba27,aatencio91,2,Thu Jun 18 18:43:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's the other way around. They are letting people know in trade negotiations, and word travels fast. I'm sure a lot of GM's talk and let each other know who's on the trade block."
denvernuggets,3aba27,NUGGman,4,Thu Jun 18 19:05:54 2015 UTC,"Shawn Drotar had an idea that I liked. They're putting it out there to put pressure on themselves. They can't have two rumors in less than 24 hours about shopping their star players and expect everything to be fine with those guys once training camp comes around. They're making it clear to the fans, the players, and themselves that Lawson and Faried are going to be gone."
denvernuggets,3aba27,aatencio91,3,Thu Jun 18 19:15:17 2015 UTC,I think that's probably right. But I don't think it's going to be a good idea getting rid of Faried. They are going to lose all the casual fans who don't read Stiffs or the Sports section of the paper.
denvernuggets,3aba27,NUGGman,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:20:56 2015 UTC,"Until a month ago, I was a casual fan. I don't care if they trade Faried as long as they get better from it. Fans of the team should feel the same way."
denvernuggets,3aba27,aatencio91,2,Thu Jun 18 19:22:10 2015 UTC,"Sure. But the Nuggets don't have much credibility at this point, after they assured us that replacing Karl with Shaw would make us better and they made the argument that you can't run in the playoffs.  Do you read the sports page and Stiffs? I'm talking about those fans who don't. I think most people who read Stiffs are swayed by them and seem to think alike. They want Ty and Faried gone. Anybody who hasn't been reading them doesn't believe that. (and a few of us who have)"
denvernuggets,3aba27,NUGGman,2,Thu Jun 18 19:27:30 2015 UTC,"I do read them occasionally. I haven't been swayed by what they've said, and I've only read them for about a month. Like I said, I was a casual fan until about a month ago. My Nuggets information came from Scott Hastings on 104.3 The Fan on slow NFL days. After watching the Rockets with a friend through their playoff run I fell in love with basketball and now I consider myself more than just a casual fan. Even as a casual fan, I would have been fine with trading Faried as long as the Nuggets got something good in return because I knew he was underperforming here.  I'm a casual Rockies fan, and while it would suck to see Troy Tulowitzky go, the Rockies have a potential replacement or two in their minor league system and could get a king's ransom in prospects in return, potentially making them better. I don't care how casual a fan anyone is, you should understand that when your team sucks there's little point in keeping your ""stars"" instead of trading them away for different pieces."
denvernuggets,3aba27,aatencio91,2,Thu Jun 18 19:35:12 2015 UTC,I haven't seen the Stiffs strongly advocate to move Ty or Faried unless the deal is right...
denvernuggets,3aba27,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:38:39 2015 UTC,This isn't anything new. I think most of the trades we've persued have been in the news.  I think they are trying to ease people into the idea of a team without Faried so there isn't a huge uproar when it happens.
denvernuggets,3aba27,NUGGman,2,Thu Jun 18 19:04:23 2015 UTC,"To your deleted comment about me being ""sure of myself for a casual fan""   I was a casual fan until about a month ago   As in ""used to be,"" ""am no longer,"" or ""was previously.""  In other words, I have recently fallen in love with basketball and because the Nuggets are my home team I root for them and have attempted to study them and follow them as closely as possible in this offseason while learning the game from a friend who is a basketball addict in an attempt to become a ""hardcore"" fan.  If you're referring to the Rockies, I am a casual fan. I don't know their record, I'm not sure who's pitching today, I couldn't tell you their lineup, but I'm not completely ignorant of them and I understand that they need to get better and can possibly do so by trading Troy Tulowitzky away.  You seem to be confusing casual fans with ignorant ""fans."""
denvernuggets,3aba27,aatencio91,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:00:28 2015 UTC,"I deleted it, because I want to be nice. But I think you saying you know Faried has underperformed seems a little hasty if you just stopped being a casual fan. But I don't need to be overly critical because I disagree and fancy myself a bit of a serious fan.  I don't disagree with you on the Rockies. It's kind of similar to Mozgov. You can try to hang onto them, but if you know a guy wants to leave, you might as well get something in return. Just like Larry Walker, and Matt Holiday.  Edit: I do think Lawson is in a similar position to Mozgov, Walker, and Holiday; and we'd be best to get something of value in return for him rather than force him to play where he doesn't want to be.  Edit 2: You seem to have edited out the part where you said you knew Faried had been underperforming.  Edit3: As for Faried, he's been a bargain every year he's been here. He is just about to get paid accordingly. If he's sick of our shit, we need to trade him. But if we do, I fully expect to see him winning a championship with another team, like a lot of the players that leave us."
denvernuggets,3aba27,NUGGman,2,Thu Jun 18 20:05:48 2015 UTC,"I didn't edit anything. I did say that Faried had been underperforming. I know he underperformed because I'm casual, not ignorant. I know that in FIBA he was The Manimal, and in Denver he was ""oh... just Faried."" I never said anyone was an expert on the Nuggets, but since they and other redditors are my only source of learning about the team right now, I'll have to take them at their word. I'm not as quick to write off radio persons as everyone that disagrees with them is, either."
denvernuggets,3aba27,aatencio91,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:25:17 2015 UTC,"in FIBA Faried had good coaches and they only asked him to do what he's good at; crash the boards, catch oops, and run fast breaks. Brian Shaw, on the other hand, wanted him setting screens outside, and shooting jump shots. Faried became less effective because he was asked to do things outside his strengths. When Hunt took over, Faried was allowed to play how he did under Karl again and he was our best player after Shaw left."
denvernuggets,3aba27,NUGGman,2,Thu Jun 18 20:32:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that Faried is a bad player, or that he absolutely needs to be gone. I'm saying it's not like the Nuggets should close the door on all talks about Faried, but it sounds like that is what you're saying."
denvernuggets,3aba27,aatencio91,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:35:11 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying that they need to ease fans into the notion because there will be pushback. Faried is a standup guy who people like rooting for.   Tebow was loved by everyone too, but they managed to get rid of him without any rioting or anything. I'm sure it's possible with Faried too. But the other player will have to be a special one.  Personally, I'm not a fan of Cousins, so I would be disappointed in the swap and would want another trade to happen to get somebody here that I do like. But I don't like Centers who shoot 18 shots a game and shoot under 50%. I just don't think it's a recipe for success. I also think Cousins has a low basketball IQ and is selfish. I'd much rather support Nurkic than him. If we could trade for Griffin or DeAndre Jordan, I might feel differently."
denvernuggets,3aba27,NUGGman,0,Thu Jun 18 21:07:26 2015 UTC,"But...Faried totally underperformed this year. That's objective, no matter what type of fan you are.   Faried was a bargain every year that he wasn't paid $11M. That changed."
denvernuggets,3aba27,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Jun 18 20:40:10 2015 UTC,"Considering the fact Faried was only paid $2.25 mil this year, he didn't underperform."
denvernuggets,3aba27,NUGGman,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:00:36 2015 UTC,Should our evaluation of a player be solely based on his salary? Or should it be based on how well he played compared to the previous season?   I think it's fair to say that everyone expected Faried to play better than he did.
denvernuggets,3aba27,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:03:55 2015 UTC,Everybody expected the entire team to play better than they did.  I'm not sure how you think Faried played worse than the season before? His numbers look almost identical to me.
denvernuggets,3aba27,NUGGman,0,Thu Jun 18 21:09:13 2015 UTC,"Gallo performed better than explected. So did Wilson, Nelson, Barton, Nurkic, and Green.   Faried came off this high of playing so well for Team USA, but he never showed that last season. We expected him to improve, and he didn't. Shit happened, and I'm not going to completely hold that against him, but I don't think it was unfair of us to expect more out of him than the year previous."
denvernuggets,3aba27,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Jun 18 21:12:36 2015 UTC,"With the same coach running the same offense and defense, you should expect the same. It's not like Faried was hitting jumpers for Team USA.   I was hoping Shaw would watch Team USA and learn how to use Faried, but Shaw was his usual asshole self stating, ""We are going to expect more now."" When he should have been the one watching and learning from Team USA.   The Nuggets have been running a slander campaign on Faried ever since they got rid of Karl and it has been effective. But it's pretty baseless if you ask me."
denvernuggets,3aba27,NUGGman,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:24:56 2015 UTC,I remember I looked around the time Shaw was fired the entire roster was shooting well below the career average percentages and many were having the worst statistical years of their career. I think it's pretty safe to say the entire team underperformed and it's not entirely their fault.
denvernuggets,3aba27,tron777,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:36:51 2015 UTC,Much of that is on Shaw.

Alot of this doesn't seem to be news to me though, lawson on the trading block, the desire to move up?  Teams aren't just going to hand over their pick, so who is available?  Pretty much everyone if you look at it."

If any leaks are happening, it's from the people they approach.    And this benefits them, by the way, because it keeps the media and whoever else is on the sidelines from chiming in and potentially killing a deal."

We even offered him to the Wolfs for love.  It's just weird to hear about two credible trade rumors back to back like that.  Normally if a team saids no to a trade of ours, we dont even hear about it.  I think that info is getting leaked."
denvernuggets,3aba27,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:16:08 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, it's hard to say. This doesn't benefit the Nuggets at all to leak, from my perspective."

He coulda been a nugg, but chose not to.   Also, dude plays awesome, but has one of the ugliest jumpers I've ever seen.

But no, other than praying before the game with them, he did not associate with them.  Even if he had, it would be a pretty lame thing to be mad about. It's not like he threw the game. He was our best player that series and for us to want more from him than he gave is selfish and ungrateful. It's that kind of attitude that will keep players from wanting to come to this city and play for us."
denvernuggets,3ac9zb,NUGGman,-1,Thu Jun 18 22:55:17 2015 UTC,Did they get rid of all the evidence of how they supported every step of destroying our team?

I did find other media that thought it was a stupid move  Here  and here  I would like to find the articles the Stiffs wrote, but am having a very hard time.  A writer at Stiffs was the guy who started the website firegeorgekarl.com   They definitely supported the dismantling of our once great team."
denvernuggets,3ac9zb,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Fri Jun 19 00:27:24 2015 UTC,it's more than likely something to do with the coding on the SBNation web platform that only shows to a certain point in terms of post history.

denvernuggets,3a8wv5,IamtheQuestionMaster,5,Thu Jun 18 05:08:17 2015 UTC,Our 7th + Ty for their 6th makes absolutely no sense.
denvernuggets,3a8wv5,pairidaeza,3,Thu Jun 18 05:14:50 2015 UTC,Exactly my point.
denvernuggets,3a8wv5,IamtheQuestionMaster,2,Thu Jun 18 05:21:14 2015 UTC,My bad. It occurred to me after I made the post
denvernuggets,3a8wv5,pairidaeza,3,Thu Jun 18 05:23:30 2015 UTC,"is there any possible trade that either we offer or you ask for that would give us Lawson, while at the same time we could keep the pick?    I doubt it."

denvernuggets,3a8wv5,teensonacid,4,Thu Jun 18 06:11:28 2015 UTC,"sure. We start with Ty for Boogie, and we give you Kenneth, Darth or Wilson to sweeten the deal"

denvernuggets,3a8wv5,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Jun 18 13:23:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not so certain. Sure, he was soured by last season, but he also publically stated he loves this city, its fans, and this team. With the right coach and a renewed FO, I think he'll be back to 2014 levels."
denvernuggets,3a8wv5,Wtfitzchris,3,Thu Jun 18 14:23:23 2015 UTC,"I feel like that's Public Relations 101 for any player to say that about the city they're playing in.  Have you ever heard a player say he hates the city, its fans, and the team?  In the case of Ty, I want to believe he likes it here, but I think his actions speak louder than his words."
denvernuggets,3a8wv5,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Thu Jun 18 15:27:07 2015 UTC,"Right, but doesn't it seem like Ty never attended PR 101?  He said that right after the hubbub from him missing practice, to reassure the fans. I think he is still willing to make it work here, and until his contract is up, it's out of his hands. He's got a lot of friends on the team too, so I don't think all hope is lost."

denvernuggets,3a74ch,Arrow218,3,Wed Jun 17 23:36:52 2015 UTC,that was my thinking going into the draft :|
denvernuggets,3a74ch,The_NGUYENNER,3,Thu Jun 18 01:57:32 2015 UTC,If Mudiay falls to 7 (lots of mocks have this happening) then the Nuggets NEED to trade Lawson.   Here's what I see happening. Nugs draft Mudiay. Trade lawson to Mavs for future picks / sign and trade for Ellis. This gives us future prospects and a scorer at the 2. And Mavs get what they want with Lawson.   Could even see getting back in the first with Faried to the Raptors.
denvernuggets,3a74ch,Kawnar,3,Thu Jun 18 00:58:16 2015 UTC,"Would the Kings even want to do this? I thought they were pretty locked down with DC, I can't imagine they would want to add another point guard like that.

denvernuggets,3a74ch,Dino_Czar,6,Thu Jun 18 12:36:29 2015 UTC,"My bold prediction: Ty for the 6th, then 6th + 7th + something else for the Sixers pick at 3 to get Russell."
denvernuggets,3a74ch,MisterSeaCucumber,36,Wed Jun 17 19:23:59 2015 UTC,I would rather have the 6th and 7th pick than trade up for Russel tbh.
denvernuggets,3a74ch,denverNUGGs,5,Wed Jun 17 19:32:58 2015 UTC,Me too. Much better potential to land a good pick when you have two chances. That's just what I think might happen.
denvernuggets,3a74ch,MisterSeaCucumber,4,Wed Jun 17 19:46:11 2015 UTC,"I agree.  According to the mock draft on http://www.draftexpress.com/, Mudiay could fall all the way to 7th.  We could draft him to run the offense and still get Winslow/Johnson."
denvernuggets,3a74ch,Wtfitzchris,3,Wed Jun 17 22:10:06 2015 UTC,I would buy season tickets immediately. That's not a joke
denvernuggets,3a74ch,hayclaylaybaymaysay,2,Thu Jun 18 14:45:45 2015 UTC,"The thing is, we have depth at basically every position, right?    Ty/nelson/Greene 2. Foye/Harris 3. Gallo/Babyneck 4.faried/Hickson/lauverne/Arthur 5. Nurkic/jokic    I think we should focus on consolidating talent instead of harvesting more if that makes any sense."
denvernuggets,3a74ch,Futurebrain,3,Wed Jun 17 23:09:28 2015 UTC,"Well Ty wouldn't be there if the trade happened.  Nelson opted out already.  DA isn't under contract with us.  And I think Barton is a restricted free agent.  Still a bit of a log jam, especially at the PF position."

denvernuggets,3a74ch,tommywood93,2,Thu Jun 18 15:39:48 2015 UTC,"As long as we land Cauley-Stein, I'm happy. He's absolutely my favorite player in this draft. He was the best defender in the country last season — he's an elite rim protector, he can switch onto any position and he can cover the PnR however you want.   Offensively, his athleticism and ability to run the floor are perfect for how the Nugs should play. He's a PnR machine in the halfcourt, and he's adding a midrange game that few people are really talking about. Check out that video — his release is a little slow, but it's crazy to see a guy that big with such good form, touch and rhythm. He also doubled his FT% from his freshman to his junior year — all this to say that, in two or three years, he'll be much more than a Tyson Chandler/DeAndre Jordan-type roller and finisher.   I think that, more than any other player in this draft, Cauley-Stein could go to any team in the league, play in any system, and contribute immediately. He has everything you want from a center in today's NBA."

denvernuggets,3a74ch,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Jun 18 00:03:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe not likely for the 6th pick, but it definitely means they're listening to offers for Ty. It also means they want to move up and maybe they're willing to package Ty and someone else to do so."
denvernuggets,3a74ch,d-lo_tha_boss,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:32:25 2015 UTC,The Nuggets organization doesn't leak things like this. They have a proven track record of being the most tight-lipped organization in the league.

denvernuggets,3a74ch,IdRatherBeLurking,17,Wed Jun 17 19:18:43 2015 UTC,I hope not. Why give up Ty and #7 to move up one spot?

denvernuggets,3a74ch,NUGGman,3,Wed Jun 17 19:31:36 2015 UTC,I agree. I just dont think Ty is worth the 6th pick. Gotta be giving up more. Players or other draft picks.
denvernuggets,3a74ch,TaylorHammond9,2,Wed Jun 17 21:38:37 2015 UTC,"I also agree. At the very least, we should be getting someone like Stauskas or McCollum in return as well.   The front office said they value him at two 1st round picks, and I tend to agree with that."
denvernuggets,3a74ch,hayclaylaybaymaysay,3,Wed Jun 17 22:19:20 2015 UTC,What the hell would we do that? Unless this is turning into a larger trade with more players coming in return I don't see how that would even kind of be worth it.
denvernuggets,3a74ch,TaylorHammond9,2,Wed Jun 17 19:19:56 2015 UTC,Maybe we're including a PF in the trade. We have plenty. Hopefully Hickson is involved.

I literally hate every player on that team. FUCK!!!   p.s. It didn't even start with that playoff series, there was a game the year before where we got blown out in Denver and Curry was acting like a little bitch and dancing up the court after making 3s."

denvernuggets,3a4j6y,OilSheikh,11,Wed Jun 17 18:10:15 2015 UTC,Lol at Iggy being named MVP.  The only reason he scored any points at all is because the Cavs rightly ignored him.  He had an entire series of wide open shots and he still didn't have gaudy numbers. Iggy didn't implode so the Warriors won but Curry is easily the MVP of this series.
denvernuggets,3a4j6y,tron777,10,Wed Jun 17 05:00:12 2015 UTC,"LeBron is the MVP of the series. I understand why he didn't win it, but I don't see any possible way that he isn't the most valuable player in these finals."
denvernuggets,3a4j6y,MisterSeaCucumber,4,Wed Jun 17 05:26:53 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, I don't know man. Curry was good. He wasn't great, but he didn't have to be. LeBron more or less destroyed everyone who wasn't Iggy that tried to guard him one-on-one all series. Without Andre, what do his numbers look like? Does he shoot as high as 46%, 48%, or 50%? I'm sure someone will write a piece about SportVU piece with details about that by the end of the week, and I may very well be completelywrong.  Pending SportVU stats aside, Iguoldala definitely changed the series. LeBron clearly dominated a lot of it, but I think Iggy made a very crucial difference.   I realize Steph drives their entire offensive spacing, his step back 3's are absolutely ridiculous, and he got trapped constantly. I thought Draymond's second pass out of the Steph-Dray PNR when Steph got trapped was really the key to their success tonight.  That being said, my time in this sub has shown me that you definitely know more about basketball than me, so don't hesitate to tell me all the reasons my rudimentary basketball analysis is wrong.  I could see the previous paragraph  being read as sarcastic, but I really mean it as a sincere compliment. I'm still very much working on learning how NBA level basketball works."
denvernuggets,3a4j6y,TriceraScotts,3,Wed Jun 17 05:49:41 2015 UTC,"It's the fear of Curry that made the engine of the Golden State offense go. Cleveland chose to trap Curry hard and make Draymond make good reads in 4 on 3 rushes to the basket which caused the Cavs to scramble like crazy sons of bitches where they chose to basically cover the paint plus anyone from the outside not named Iggy.  The Cavs chose the lesser of two evils in letting Draymond and Iggy try to beat them instead of Curry. Ultimately Dray and Iggy played well enough to win but not well enough to make the Cavs second think their strategy. Curry scared them more, and even though they lost, I think that was the correct decision.  If Curry isn't in this series I don't know what their offense would have looked like. The Cavs would be able to just stick tight on everyone and it would have looked very different than what we saw. I don't think Iggy is scoring much at all in such a series, especially in the half court.  If Iguodala isn't in this series I think the Warriors go to Harrison Barnes and get roughly the same offensive output. They'd struggle a little more on defense but I think they still win that series."
denvernuggets,3a4j6y,tron777,2,Wed Jun 17 13:22:23 2015 UTC,I thought Blatt did a great job this year. There's no way that team should have done that well with all the injuries and player changes during the season. Dynasties are built and they are in the early building stages.
denvernuggets,3a4j6y,NUGGman,3,Wed Jun 17 17:39:50 2015 UTC,I gota give it to LeBron. With no LeBron the cavs get swept..but with no Mole i still think its a series. Curry would have carried.

If the Cavs were healthy they should have taken it but they weren't.  Edit: Mozgov is exempted from the previous derogatory comment.
denvernuggets,3a4j6y,SamManning17,4,Wed Jun 17 04:42:29 2015 UTC,How was LeBron not using team work though? Lol his stats are way more than just points. He just had no support around him against a team that is stacked. It's not because he didn't use teamwork.

Iggy got traded here, he didn't choose to come here. Obviously he wasn't keen on staying and so when he had the opportunity he left, tbh i'm glad he left. U don't want someone playing on ur team who doesn't want to be there."
denvernuggets,3a4j6y,skipaBturner,8,Wed Jun 17 09:36:05 2015 UTC,Its how he left...and who he left to
denvernuggets,3a4j6y,kipmix,6,Wed Jun 17 10:02:36 2015 UTC,"he was a free agent, he left for a team with more talent and potential. Sure he went there for less money, and to the team that ripped our hearts out that same year. But he doesn't owe nuggets anything in the end of the day. He only played with us for one season. He's a great player who has worked his ass off his whole life to get to where he is today"
denvernuggets,3a4j6y,NUGGman,5,Wed Jun 17 10:32:23 2015 UTC,"Spot on. If anything we need to be salty to the FO for making the trade w/o getting him to sign an extension in the first place...but then again that was really the only 'bad' thing Masai ever did for us. He's a god in my book for how he handled the Melo situation.   Don't get me wrong, I'm disappointed that Iggy left after we gave up so much for him but if you aren't giving the MVP to Lebron for that series....he was the one who really 'shut down' Lebron and keeping him from getting 60 points per game. No other player on GSW could have done it."
denvernuggets,3a4j6y,kipmix,2,Wed Jun 17 15:58:23 2015 UTC,"We gave up so much for Iggy? We gave up Al Harrington, who didn't do anything, and Afflalo, who we got back with the trade exception we got from Iguodala leaving. We got him cheap and we got something for him when he left. It wasn't that bad of a deal.  I'm glad Iguodala left. It wouldn't be fair to put him through what the other players had to go through with Shaw. We really didn't do our players any favors by getting a coach who belittled every player he had."
denvernuggets,3a4j6y,NUGGman,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:44:16 2015 UTC,We gave up Evan Fournier and another pick I thought to get AAA back the 2nd time? The trade exception we got from Iggy would have already been expired by the time we got him back if I understand it correctly. I'm assuming you get it for a year.   Harrington was coming off a season where he was averaging 14.4 points per game and AAA 15.2 per game. At the time of that trade it was a lot to give up to bring in Iggy's defense.
denvernuggets,3a4j6y,NUGGman,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:44:27 2015 UTC,We traded Fournier but needed the trade exception too for the salary difference. We did use the Iguodala trade exception.  Edit: Trade details
denvernuggets,3a4j6y,Oshawut,0,Thu Jun 18 03:16:10 2015 UTC,"If you can't beat 'em join 'em.  Curry was probably the only player Iguodala can't cover.   We expect players to want to win championships more than be rich. But we manage to hate Iguodala for taking less money to win a championship (where he was unselfish enough to accept a role coming off the bench) but still love Melo who forced his way out, taking Billups (who is to Colorado as Lebron is to Cleveland) with him, only so he can make a ton of money and amass the worst playoff record in NBA history.  This is another reason I hate amateur journalism. They ran away with some stupid story and created this stupid ""mole"" nickname and slandered the guy without even knowing what they were slandering him on. It didn't bite Cleveland in the ass treating Lebron that way, but I'm not so sure we will be as lucky."
denvernuggets,3a4j6y,rhinoman4,3,Wed Jun 17 17:56:23 2015 UTC,"At least we got a lot of nugget alumnis in the finals :p  S/o JR ""Ohshitweinthefinals"" Swish, Timmy Mozgod and even Iggy even tho tbh I think Curry deserved that MVP.

denvernuggets,3a4j6y,NUGGman,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:34:01 2015 UTC,"I might get crushed for this but didn't Iggy opt-out after Ujiri left and Karl was fired? If you could see a train wreck coming wouldn't you get off beforehand? The organization has been a mess since all that happened and I think if he could see things headed in a bad direction it would make sense to leave a team headed in one direction for a team headed (fast) to the top).  If that mole stuff is true though ignore what I just wrote, fuck that guy"
denvernuggets,3a4j6y,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:41:40 2015 UTC,"Personally, I thought it was great. The team concept won out this year. The notion that you need 3 max players to win a championship was proven wrong. It was too bad that Love and Irving got injured, it would have been a more competitive series. But I love how the attention is spread around from Iguodala to Green to the splash brothers, nobody is monopolizing the attention.  I think it takes away from the glory of the game when one player gets all the credit and all the focus; like Lebron or MJ. You need a team and you need chemistry and a game plan and depth to win a championship.   We were on the right path 3 years ago. I really hope we can get back there."
denvernuggets,3a4j6y,growedup,5,Wed Jun 17 17:30:23 2015 UTC,*You need 3 max players that are 1-2 years from getting paid the max

denvernuggets,3a4j6y,OilSheikh,2,Wed Jun 17 17:48:37 2015 UTC,Who is max on Golden State? Curry will eventually be but he's not yet. Klay doesn't deserve max. Green doesn't deserve max. Iguodala doesn't deserve max. They are built more like the Spurs than the Heat.
denvernuggets,3a4j6y,NUGGman,2,Wed Jun 17 17:59:21 2015 UTC,"Klay and Green totally deserve the max, especially with the salary cap jumping."

The way he left is shitty, but I don't believe it's fair to say he threw that series or he that didn't try.   This was GSW's year for a number of reasons.  They were healthy, which is huge for any team.  Cleveland, their biggest threat, was missing Kyrie & Love. Green is going to get max, so they must decide whether to match.  I for one, would like to see them fizzle out... but, that is because curry is a punk."

denvernuggets,3a4j2i,ParadeShitter,2,Wed Jun 17 23:39:13 2015 UTC,Fuck the Warriors
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,RunninRebs90,4,Thu Jun 18 01:05:02 2015 UTC,well deserved for him. i thought curry was going to steal if unfairly
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,pairidaeza,12,Wed Jun 17 04:31:50 2015 UTC,"And paradeshitter is here to shit on our hate parade.   Fuck Iggy and Fuck you.'  Edit: Apparently I've hurt peoples feelings. sorry 'bout that.   Edit2: This guy also said this    i even had the misfortune of having nuggets season tickets last season    in a pro Warriors thread. So I'm pretty sure he's just trying too troll us right now. I mean, why would it ever be a 'misfortune'?"
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,RunninRebs90,7,Wed Jun 17 04:39:25 2015 UTC,Don't witch hunt.
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,pairidaeza,2,Wed Jun 17 05:41:18 2015 UTC,I was trying too see if I had run into him before since he claims to be a rebels alumni. Or if he had posted in /r/collegebasketball or anything. I wasn't trying to 'prove him false' or anything. And then stumbled on that comment and it seemed fishy..
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,RunninRebs90,2,Wed Jun 17 05:46:22 2015 UTC,"You seem too really like this guy though.   No, mate. I'm just trying to keep it level-headed here. The guy has season tickets so he is quite clearly invested as a Nuggets fan.  The reason he might have said it was ""a misfortune"" was on account of the horrible season endured..."
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,pairidaeza,2,Wed Jun 17 05:48:46 2015 UTC,"I edited that part because I realized you were a mod and just trying too keep the peace. And I'm cool with that. But I just get a bad gut feeling about a guy who has season tics for the nuggets and calls it unfortunate, in a Warriors thread none-the-less. Then defends Iggy in an obvious anti Iggy thread (it says turncoat in the title). And has no idea the history that Iggy had with the nuggets. AND called me out for being mean too him as another UNLV alum when there is literally no way I could have known that. It all feels like a troll move too me."
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,TriceraScotts,6,Wed Jun 17 05:53:18 2015 UTC,"And who are you to chastise him for his views or what he does with his money or his free time?  Just leave the guy alone. If you don't like his comments, you can always downvote him - even though that's not how downvotes are meant to work, that's what people wind up doing anyway.   I would advise you take your frustrations out elsewhere because you're attacking the guy when he's done absolutely nothing to impinge upon your existence. He's not trolling you."
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,RunninRebs90,5,Wed Jun 17 05:56:17 2015 UTC,"Well said, sir. I don't want to give out unnecessary compliments, but it's comments like this one from the mods of this sub that keep me optimistic about it's future."
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,pairidaeza,2,Wed Jun 17 06:08:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right. I mean, he IS trolling me but that's my fault. Whatever, I'm over it."
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,GoAvs14,4,Wed Jun 17 06:04:26 2015 UTC,"Good :D  It's not worth worrying about.  And if you think you're pissed, imagine how our players feel!   Maybe this will serve as the ultimate motivation?"
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,RunninRebs90,0,Wed Jun 17 06:25:14 2015 UTC,No. Fuck that mod if he doesn't like people expressing opinions. The mods on this sub are WAY too sensitive. You're allowed to be angry.

denvernuggets,3a4j2i,ParadeShitter,5,Wed Jun 17 05:59:55 2015 UTC,If you're a huge UNLV fan then you should definitely come over too /r/collegebasketball and support them like runninreb90 mentioned in another comment. We could definitely use the help. Lol.

denvernuggets,3a4j2i,ParadeShitter,9,Wed Jun 17 04:54:59 2015 UTC,I mean I had absolutely no idea you're a rebel alum but it doesn't change the fact that this guy completely fucked the Nuggets. And you're in a Nugget's subreddit so I don't know what you expected.   Iguodala got onto the Warriors by betraying the Nuggets. Screw this guy.
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,RunninRebs90,-7,Wed Jun 17 04:58:16 2015 UTC,"""fucked the nuggets"".... how so?  traded to denver, didn't resign with the team. makes OBVIOUSLY the right decision for him and goes to oakland and wins a title. how exactly did he fuck the nuggets. a lot of salty fans in here at the moment, kind've sad to see."
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,SamManning17,3,Wed Jun 17 05:02:58 2015 UTC,When the Nuggets were playing the Warriors in the 2012 playoffs Iguodala phoned it in when the team needed him the most. He immediately went to the Warriors afterwards. 'Rumors' started rising which claimed he had made a deal with the Warriors to go play for them DURING the series.   His lack of effort in the last few games was embarrassing and insulting.
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,TriceraScotts,5,Wed Jun 17 05:10:02 2015 UTC,"he also told the Nuggets he was coming back next season. He had no reason to leave the Nuggets (fourth best team in the NBA at that time, we won 55+ games). We had a close series against GS and if we had kept Iguodala we could have easily made the playoffs the following year. Now look where we are."
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,ParadeShitter,2,Wed Jun 17 05:22:22 2015 UTC,"To be fair, that off-season, the Nuggets essentially fired the coach of the year and they definitely let the executive of the year walk. He was in, what, his 7th season then? If you knew you might only have a few seasons left, would you stick around for what looks like a probable rebuild?"
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,ParadeShitter,0,Wed Jun 17 05:57:42 2015 UTC,"maybe he saw the writing on the wall. there's a good chance a guy in the locker room is going to have a better gauge of where the team is going than people on the internet. he wins a title, he made the right decision if that's what he was after. i guess i understand the hate but it's a bit absurd. he's a good player, a good all-around talent but he's not the reason the nuggets are where they are. not by a long shot"
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,IdRatherBeLurking,0,Wed Jun 17 05:56:56 2015 UTC,phoned it in.... i dunno his numbers say a different story
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,ParadeShitter,2,Wed Jun 17 05:55:18 2015 UTC,"Of all the charges I've levied against Benedict Andre, him phoning in his playoff performance wasn't one of them. He was trying out- and he played pretty damn well."
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,RunninRebs90,-5,Wed Jun 17 14:06:35 2015 UTC,"lol so i'm a raiders fan... trust me when i say that this place is borderline raider-like at the moment with all the hate. if you want hate, there's no better subreddit than the raider subreddit"
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,ParadeShitter,6,Wed Jun 17 06:00:59 2015 UTC,I literally never said anything about the raiders.
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,IdRatherBeLurking,0,Wed Jun 17 06:05:12 2015 UTC,"it is on the raiders subreddit. i was making a comparison. you don't have to say anything about the raiders for me to make the connection to the two subs, you've already posted the proof"
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,corybyu,2,Wed Jun 17 06:07:16 2015 UTC,Ugh. I wish you hadn't have mentioned that. :)

Yeah I don't like Iguodala either, but his move to GSW and the circumstances surrounding it were legitimately shady, and I lost all respect for him as a professional athlete.  Sure, he is a good player, but I don't think any great competitor would get buddy-buddy with the opposing team during a playoff series, no matter what his off season plans were.  So yeah, don't respect the guy, or Bogut, but personally I don't have any other hate towards the Warriors.  (Mark Jackson on the other hand..)"
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,corybyu,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:32:22 2015 UTC,"I only meant that I wish he hadn't mentioned he was a Raiders fan, because fuck the Raiders.   My only hate for the Warriors is because Iguodala and Bogut are on the team, and because well over half of their fanbase are fucking Raiders fans."
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Wed Jun 17 17:34:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah agreed for sure. I was just saying I don't think our level of ""hate"" is really that bad (to the point of being compared with complete trash/filth), was just explaining the situation and how I feel like we have legitimate reasons to dislike Iguodala especially."
denvernuggets,3a4j2i,corybyu,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:04:43 2015 UTC,"I can't stand that comment here saying he's ""a trash of a human"" or whatever. He made a bitchass business move, but that says nothing about him personally. From all accounts, he's a good and charitable dude."

denvernuggets,3a4j2i,NUGGman,2,Fri Jun 19 16:37:30 2015 UTC,"I hated Iggy the moment I found out he was essentially auditioning for the Warriors while still on the Nuggets. So I disliked him before he even left Denver. Not quite the same thing. I still like Melo, I still like Bird Man, I still like JR (sometimes). I still like Nene and all the other Nuggets who played their hearts out in Denver and then left for one reason or another. Iggy was our big time pick up who took the money and ran after less than 1 year.  You're literally a 'fan' who stopped watching because the team sucked. Argue it however you want but it's the definition of fair weather."
denvernuggets,3a56d4,minutemandan,6,Wed Jun 17 08:55:12 2015 UTC,i like this guy. I also liked shaw when he had his introductory press conference. Prove me wrong malone.... pleaseeee
denvernuggets,3a56d4,skipaBturner,2,Wed Jun 17 11:21:18 2015 UTC,the main difference for me is: with Shaw I was very hopeful.... With Malone I'm very confident. I can see him being in Denver for a very long time.
denvernuggets,3a56d4,The_NGUYENNER,4,Wed Jun 17 17:59:18 2015 UTC,lmao Mark Kiszla blocked me on twitter for calling him out on that bush league question. I'm pretty proud of myself on that one.
denvernuggets,3a56d4,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Wed Jun 17 17:43:46 2015 UTC,Classless. You can dish out douchebag questions but can't handle being called out on them? What a fucker.
denvernuggets,3a56d4,aatencio91,3,Wed Jun 17 17:50:01 2015 UTC,"Right? It's not like I was trolling him, saying ""Fuck you Kiszla you talentless hack"" (words that have indeed come out of my mouth before). He knew exactly what he was doing, and took the first fucking question away from pros like Dempsey to get his snide bullshit in.   Him and DMac are about as bad as it gets. I've got more respect for DMac, though."
denvernuggets,3a56d4,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Wed Jun 17 17:53:50 2015 UTC,I love DMac
denvernuggets,3a56d4,aatencio91,2,Wed Jun 17 17:59:20 2015 UTC,I've yet to be convinced that he ever knows what he is talking about. Big AL is my dude.
denvernuggets,3a56d4,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Wed Jun 17 18:12:50 2015 UTC,"I wanted to punch Al yesterday, man. He's 100% behind the firing of John Fox because he was tired of 1st round exits. He complains about the Monforts wanting the fans to be okay with the Rockies playing entertaining baseball even though they're not going to win anything. THEN HE TEARS DMAC APART FOR NOT BEING OKAY WITH ENTERTAINING BASKETBALL UNDER GEORGE KARL. Come the fuck on, Alfred. Be consistent. How the hell could a world champion expect fans to settle for entertaining but not championship winning basketball? I was straight up pissed.  EDIT: He also acted like DMac singlehandedly got George Karl fired and made it sound like it was DMac's fault that the Nuggets sucked under Brian Shaw. On a Broncos note, I'm also fed up with Alfred's notion that the Broncos don't need Demaryius Thomas post-Manning because ""if you don't have an elite quarterback, you don't need an elite receiver."" What the fuck kind of logic is that? If you have a young, unproven quarterback, why wouldn't you want to surround him with the best weapons you can surround him with? That's just setting Brock up for failure."

Josh got pretty hot with him, saying he is the decision maker here, his father is only filled in, and that Mark should know that already."
denvernuggets,3a56d4,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Jun 18 03:06:10 2015 UTC,I hate that. Mark kiszla has been pretty adamant about figuring out whose in charge. And I'm sure Josh  is pretty fed up with it.

denvernuggets,3a36fq,ParadeShitter,2,Wed Jun 17 01:51:56 2015 UTC,"i hate when coaches say they want to run but i have a feeling malone understands what it takes to run. a lot of coaches say they want uptempo but fail to realize that uptempo offensive is almost entirely dictated by defense. steals, blocked shots, outlet passes.... all these things lead to numbers in transition. in bounding the ball after a made basket does not. if you want to score a lot you have to get stops, it's as simple as that"

denvernuggets,3a1tam,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Tue Jun 16 16:36:45 2015 UTC,"This isn't a bunch of bullshit platitudes, Malone has got a fucking plan."
denvernuggets,3a1tam,aatencio91,3,Tue Jun 16 16:37:49 2015 UTC,He sounds genuine and sharp
denvernuggets,3a1tam,zoeyversustheraccoon,6,Tue Jun 16 16:48:33 2015 UTC,"Feeling a little better about the hire now? I know it doesn't mean a whole bunch to say the right things at a presser, but he said some really good things."
denvernuggets,3a1tam,Arrow218,6,Tue Jun 16 17:31:58 2015 UTC,"A little. I really hope Hunt sticks around, though. I like having somebody who knows how to run an offense that works for Gallo and Faried, and I think Hunt is good for that. But we do need to have a solid defense and I'm not sure Hunt can provide that."
denvernuggets,3a1tam,aatencio91,7,Tue Jun 16 18:35:10 2015 UTC,"When TC said whatever positive thing it was (can't remember) about Melvin, Malone nodded his head vigorously.  I wouldn't be surprised if Melvin comes back."
denvernuggets,3a1tam,aatencio91,4,Tue Jun 16 19:33:48 2015 UTC,I get the vibe Hunt is staying to run the offense.. But I couldn't blame him going to be an AHC at a better team to gun for a HC job.
denvernuggets,3a1tam,aatencio91,2,Wed Jun 17 01:58:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think it'll happen, but I would love for Hunt to stay with the team as an assistant and to have him run the offense."
denvernuggets,3a1tam,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Jun 16 18:36:39 2015 UTC,"I'm just trying to keep in mind that I will feel like I overreacted if Hunt sticks around, because we would still get a lot of the positives that comes with having him around. It's hard to get a head coaching job in this league, so he probably won't have any offers yet. So, he might want to stick around. He did through the last coaching change.  Edit: I was happy with all of Malone's answers and came away feeling better about the hire"
denvernuggets,3a1tam,Futurebrain,2,Tue Jun 16 18:45:11 2015 UTC,"He was the interim head coach though and because of that I can't help but wonder if he'll feel like he was snubbed because he wasn't chosen for this job. Right now he's stuck as an assistant, but someone joked yesterday about him calling up George Karl and asking for a job and I don't think that's really too far out of the realm of possibility."
denvernuggets,3a1tam,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Tue Jun 16 18:47:42 2015 UTC,"Broncos RB coach Studesville was an interim coach and stuck around. It could happen and I hope it does.  LOL. I was the one who joked about him joining Karl, but he has only coached one year under him and who knows if Karl is looking to replace any assistants. At least here, he is very familiar with all the players and the owner and it might still be the best place for him to get a head coaching shot, eventually."
denvernuggets,3a1tam,Futurebrain,3,Tue Jun 16 18:50:27 2015 UTC,I don't know if Studesville thought he was ready as a HC. Maybe Shaw will be the same. I hope he follows Studesville's ways.  That's funny that it was you. I forget that there are only a handful of regular users around here.
denvernuggets,3a1tam,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Jun 16 19:00:54 2015 UTC,Starting in 10 minutes or so. Malone is still getting ready.
denvernuggets,3a1tam,Futurebrain,2,Tue Jun 16 15:58:01 2015 UTC,or maybe a little more. Sound just kicked back on
denvernuggets,3a1tam,teensonacid,2,Tue Jun 16 16:19:07 2015 UTC,"whooie, he's got some fire!"
denvernuggets,3a1tam,eathbau,2,Tue Jun 16 16:30:22 2015 UTC,"Aw man, I missed everything but the end. Anyone have the video? Will this be up somewhere?"
denvernuggets,3a1tam,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Jun 16 16:53:15 2015 UTC,"It definitely should be archived, I'll keep my eye out for you!"
denvernuggets,3a1tam,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Jun 16 16:56:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks, brother!"
denvernuggets,3a1tam,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Tue Jun 16 16:59:26 2015 UTC,Here ya go mate. Only audio for right now.
denvernuggets,3a1tam,aatencio91,2,Tue Jun 16 17:29:15 2015 UTC,"That's all I need! You're the fucking man, thank you!"
denvernuggets,3a3o5x,Rob0tEars,4,Tue Jun 16 23:50:17 2015 UTC,no way. complete wrong direction
denvernuggets,3a3o5x,vrock627,2,Wed Jun 17 00:00:41 2015 UTC,What about added future picks and cash?
denvernuggets,3a3o5x,with2nns,3,Wed Jun 17 01:48:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe Wilcox and picks. He's going to be 25 next year though, I think we're looking for guys younger than that. Honestly, I we can probably  get better offers from a lot of other teams.   You can have JJ Hickson if you want. Plz."
denvernuggets,3a3o5x,followthelawson,3,Wed Jun 17 03:55:19 2015 UTC,We need young players and picks
denvernuggets,3a3o5x,pairidaeza,2,Wed Jun 17 01:32:13 2015 UTC,You gotta be kidding me.
denvernuggets,3a3o5x,minutemandan,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:51:09 2015 UTC,"That's a move that would free up money, and would make the Nuggets worse. You'd have to think they'd look to move Jamal Crawford at the trade deadline as well. Chandler likes being in Denver, he's a valuable player, I don't know if it's a good call to just move him to move someone."
denvernuggets,3a2st4,HeartOfFeS2,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:56:30 2015 UTC,"Lots of cheerleader videos haha and good inside view of things, definitely worth the add."
denvernuggets,3a1n4c,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Tue Jun 16 15:05:52 2015 UTC,"This was super reassuring for me. Some small excerpts:    Q: The Nuggets have stated over-and-over that they want to get back to taking advantage of the altitude in Denver. They have signified they want to play with pace and space (the fancy NBA buzzwords!). Can Malone be an innovative coach on offense?  A: The Kings finished the season 8th in the NBA in pace, with a rating of 95.4 according to basketball-reference.com. Mike Malone's Kings, meanwhile, had a pace of 95.7 according to NBA.com/stats. So while the need for improved pace was cited as the reason for firing Malone, it clearly wasn't the true problem. I think he can play at a higher pace, but I also think he tailors his coaching to the players he has to work with. Malone found a way to be successful with the players the Kings have. Players who many felt were vastly outperforming expectations.  Q: I know I am not asking something, so tell me what I'm missing about Malone?  A: If you believe the Nuggets' issues to be caused by a lost locker room, Malone is the perfect hire. He completely changed the culture in Sacramento in less than one season. It was an incredible transformation. He related to players and earned their trust. He stood up for his team. He inspires players to achieve more. I think you landed a really good young coach. Don't let his record in Sacramento fool you, you guys got a good one."
denvernuggets,3a1n4c,NUGGman,0,Tue Jun 16 15:08:03 2015 UTC,"George Karl coached most of their games this year, no shit they had pace. What about the year before when Malone coached ALL of the games? They were 14th in pace. The year before that they were 7th in pace with the coach prior to Malone."
denvernuggets,3a1n4c,aatencio91,4,Tue Jun 16 15:28:57 2015 UTC,"George Karl coached most of their games this year   No, he didn't. Karl coached 30 games for SAC, finishing 11 and 19. Malone coached 24 and finished 11 and 13."
denvernuggets,3a1n4c,NUGGman,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:22:18 2015 UTC,Correction: Karl coached the most games for them this year  Edit: But the fact that they had the most pace when Malone was coaching is a stat in his favor
denvernuggets,3a1n4c,aatencio91,5,Tue Jun 16 16:47:11 2015 UTC,"The Kings finished the season 8th in the NBA in pace, with a rating of 95.4 according to basketball-reference.com  Mike Malone's Kings, meanwhile, had a pace of 95.7 according to NBA.com/stats.   That's nearly equal from one to the next, slightly higher in Malone's favor"
denvernuggets,3a1n4c,NUGGman,2,Tue Jun 16 18:17:24 2015 UTC,Correct. That is a good stat for him that supports him being able to run a fast pace.
denvernuggets,3a1n4c,aatencio91,3,Tue Jun 16 18:43:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I totally misinterpreted your edit."
denvernuggets,3a1n4c,NUGGman,2,Tue Jun 16 18:45:45 2015 UTC,I edited again to make it more clear
denvernuggets,3a1n4c,silverandblack,2,Tue Jun 16 18:51:39 2015 UTC,Deep breath. Here goes a lot of hope.
denvernuggets,3a01yt,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Jun 16 04:13:33 2015 UTC,"Huh, it's good that we finally have a name to the position. I wonder how this will effect our team?   I have faith in Conelly, I hope that he continues to have the same amount of influence with the teams decision making process."
denvernuggets,3a01yt,Futurebrain,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:54:10 2015 UTC,That's a big title. Big enough to throw his weight around if he wants to. I don't see much of any upside to this as a Nugget's fan. Best case scenario that I see is D'Alessandro saves some money here or there that Kroenke maybe spends down the line on the Nuggets.  Where the worst case scenario is Sacramento.   Maybe it's all hunky dory in The Can (is that where they work?) but I would rather not be hiring dudes that just got out of a meltdown power struggle as we are supposedly trying to get out of our own brand of organizational dysfunction.
denvernuggets,39z9rj,NUGGman,9,Tue Jun 16 00:14:08 2015 UTC,I would have no problem with letting him try out for the team.
denvernuggets,39z9rj,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Tue Jun 16 00:27:13 2015 UTC,We sucked from beyond the arc last season so I'm all for it.
denvernuggets,39z9rj,pairidaeza,3,Tue Jun 16 01:03:59 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt anyone is bringing in Jimmer.  He had no impact on the Kings, so he got waved and there was no difference other than having our guys with no potential get more time.  He had almost no impact with the Pelicans this year.  He's a solid scoring guard, but lacks the speed, quickness and athleticism to contribute in any other way than a few heat check shots in a given game.  He can be useful, but shouldn't be desired.  I don't think Pete would bring him back, and I don't think that he'll have enough power to do that anyway."
denvernuggets,39z9rj,IMDATBOY,2,Tue Jun 16 00:18:28 2015 UTC,He did just buy a house here...
denvernuggets,39z9rj,FraserTheAmazer,4,Tue Jun 16 00:21:16 2015 UTC,"His wife is from Denver and they spend their off-season in part here, so makes sense in that respect. Doesn't necessarily mean he's playing here but I'm sure the Jimmer's would come to the Nuggets if the opportunity arose."
denvernuggets,39z9rj,IMDATBOY,3,Tue Jun 16 00:42:34 2015 UTC,"While interesting, I wouldn't put too much stock in it.  He went to school in Utah, Colorado is near and a great place to live.  Most players like Jimmer don't buy houses, even when they land small contracts with teams, because their career is on the line.  Even if a player isn't waived, they could be traded on any given day and be stuck with a house in some city at random."
denvernuggets,39z9rj,OkAutopilot,2,Tue Jun 16 00:25:41 2015 UTC,"I'm always a little skeptical, so I'm not assuming he will sign here. Just entertaining the idea. I like guys who shoot 40% from 3 and guys who wear #32, so I wouldn't mind having him."
denvernuggets,39z9rj,with2nns,3,Tue Jun 16 00:30:09 2015 UTC,You'd mind having him as soon as you watched him do anything on the basketball court besides shooting a three though.
denvernuggets,39z9rj,tron777,3,Tue Jun 16 07:20:38 2015 UTC,Indifferent.
denvernuggets,39z9rj,aatencio91,3,Tue Jun 16 00:24:48 2015 UTC,I'm very anti-Jimmer. That man has a ridiculous name and I cannot say it with a straight face.
denvernuggets,39z9rj,FraserTheAmazer,2,Tue Jun 16 14:25:10 2015 UTC,I always read it in a Timmy from South Park voice.
denvernuggets,39z9rj,teensonacid,2,Tue Jun 16 18:19:22 2015 UTC,Is there any indication that Jimmer would come to the Nuggets? Or just hope on your part?  I'm all for him coming to town!
denvernuggets,39z9rj,jd61,2,Tue Jun 16 00:43:42 2015 UTC,"A friend told me he moved here. I would like to watch him play too, so yeah there's a little hope in there too"
denvernuggets,39z9rj,eathbau,2,Tue Jun 16 00:49:09 2015 UTC,i don't really know his game that much. If he's a guy who can make the open 3 and play decent D...i'm ok with giving him a look. as long as he doesn't take minutes from Barton
denvernuggets,39z9rj,eg14000,2,Tue Jun 16 02:34:30 2015 UTC,"Finally something I feel like I know a lot about. As a disclaimer, I go to BYU and I watched every single one of his college games and the majority of his Kings games, so I am biased.   On one of his pods about a year ago, Bill Simmons said that he thinks there is room for Jimmer to have a role on a team in the right situation. I completely agree.   Now, don't get me wrong, I don't think Jimmer should be playing more than 10-15 minutes a game. But I do think he could play a role on a team as an offensive catalyst and be a spark off the bench in limited minutes.  Something I don't think people understand about Jimmer is that in college, his coach Dave Rose discouraged him from playing defense. His offense was so valuable that they honestly told him not to give full effort. Understanding that and that Jimmer came in during the lockout mess and did not get a full NBA offseason, it is easier to understand why he is one of the worst defenders in the league.   I honestly think the Kings situation hurt Jimmer's confidence and he has not been the same offensively since. That is what I mainly attribute his terrible 3pt shooting this last year. At BYU, he had a complete green light and he knew his shots would fall before they left his hands. I mean, heck, he was hitting consistently from 5-6 feet from behind the NBA 3 point line. He needs to get that back to have a snowball's chance in he  If the Nuggets were willing to invest time into improving Jimmer's defense enough to not make him a complete defensive liability, and got behind him to get his confidence on offense back up, he could be very useful to provide offense off of the bench. If those two things were done right, I think there is a good chance we would see more of his unlimited range and creative around the rim scoring, as shown in the videos below. Additionally, he is a minimum salary guy and isn't going to have any behavioral trouble, so what's the risk?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz_oexjT7hM  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OgKn8VGHas  I know it is very unlikely, but I would be very excited at the prospect of Jimmer becoming a Nugget."
denvernuggets,39z9rj,growedup,2,Tue Jun 16 03:19:13 2015 UTC,I'd be pretty happy to have him at the minimum to be our end of the bench guy.
denvernuggets,39z9rj,growedup,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:39:25 2015 UTC,"Do we want Jimmer Fredette?  Don't we have a player just as similar, in Erick Green?  If we already have that role on our team filled why would we need or want it?  This just seems like a waste of a roster spot."
denvernuggets,39z9rj,hayclaylaybaymaysay,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:19:26 2015 UTC,I think Jimmer would be an upgrade to Foye at SG. I think Green is a PG for us.
denvernuggets,39z9rj,FatLever12,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:42:03 2015 UTC,Jimmer > Randy? No way.
denvernuggets,39y87e,THECHUNGAWANGA,6,Mon Jun 15 19:37:14 2015 UTC,"I think we take the best player available, it's the NBA."
denvernuggets,39y87e,Arrow218,2,Mon Jun 15 23:40:29 2015 UTC,"Seeing as his big strength is defense, maybe that makes us more likely to draft Stanley Johnson? Just a guess."
denvernuggets,39y87e,Status_Flux,5,Mon Jun 15 19:45:27 2015 UTC,"I think it makes Johnson/Winslow more likely and Hezonja less likely. Hezonja is said to be a better shooter, but Johnson and Winslow are better defenders and they're good/decent offensive players, too."
denvernuggets,39y87e,aatencio91,2,Mon Jun 15 19:46:45 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion, but if Cauley-Stein makes it to 7 I think he'll be the pick. A defensive minded coach who did a great job developing Cousins, then being given Nurkic and WCS? Sounds like a great starting block.   But I think SAC will take him and we'll most likely draft Winslow or Stanley Johnson."
denvernuggets,39y87e,MileHighPride30,2,Mon Jun 15 19:49:01 2015 UTC,That was kind of my thinking. With porzingus? And WCS both being possible does the FO see this and move on them. I hope more thought is put into the coaches strengths because the FO didn't do jack to help Shaw with players that fit his system
denvernuggets,39y87e,Ediblegoldnuggets,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:56:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah he should put more emphasis into players he can work around.  What's also important is the staff Malone brings with him/hired for him.  It's a collective effort from all players and coaches that develops individual players.  Eg. If we take Stanley Johnson, we better have some good wing development, through player leadership (Gallo/Wilson, one should stay) and a coach or 2 who has either played in the league or knows what it's like. IMO"
denvernuggets,39y4bi,aatencio91,4,Mon Jun 15 19:09:50 2015 UTC,Hopefully the defensive sieve that is JJ Hickson is on his way out.
denvernuggets,39y4bi,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Mon Jun 15 20:53:44 2015 UTC,"With the hiring of Malone, they may have a complete rebuild in mind. The next week and half or so up to draft day could be interesting. You could see Ty, Faried, and Chandler all down the road motors...."
denvernuggets,39xut7,zachtothejohnson,2,Mon Jun 15 18:04:27 2015 UTC,Awesome. Hope we can keep Hunt on as an assistant or associate head coach.
denvernuggets,39xut7,OkAutopilot,2,Mon Jun 15 18:05:13 2015 UTC,I'm not too sure I'm excited but hopefully it all works out.
denvernuggets,39w9z3,eg14000,9,Mon Jun 15 09:01:16 2015 UTC,"I would be very mad.  A team like Denver needs to hold onto all assests. If we were super high on Porzingas, a trade could definitely work, but I'm against it.  He is a typical stretch 4 that's 7'1. Pretty sure that's what jokic is coming over for.  I'm not sure what the FO actually thinks, but id much prefer to chill at the 7th and land the best available talent. To either build around or trade."
denvernuggets,39w9z3,Ediblegoldnuggets,2,Mon Jun 15 10:16:03 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but I just have a couple problems with the reasoning of you saying it.     Porzingis is just a typical stretch 4.  How wrong can you be, Porzingis can score anywhere on the court. In addition have you seen him dunk? He dunks like I'm dunking on my little nerf hoop on my front door. Just how effortlessly he puts the ball in the basket. Dude might be the best shooter in the draft at 7.1, typical stretch fours are not the best shooters in the draft. We don't need Porzingis because we have Jokic.  That's like saying we don't need the Dwight Howard because we have Zach Randolph. Talent is talent the more you have the better off you are. The Nuggets are in no position to pick off need. A team like the Nuggets needs to keep their assets.  What are assets for if we can't flip them for quality talent. I would rather have 1 star then two roll Players. Historically, that's what 7 pick get you, a role player.  If Porzingis becomes a star like 50% of NBA scouts say he will be. The Nuggets gotta steal. We have to take that risk.  (and with the Knicks pick swap next year, the Nuggets are pretty much guaranteed to have a high Lottery pick anyway.)"
denvernuggets,39w9z3,Edenova,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:32:10 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree more with you. The Nuggets need to step up and make a move like this and stop playing it safe. We have been playing it safe ever since we traded Melo and that obviously hasn't worked out for us. It's proven that a team needs a star in order to seriously compete and all these mid first round picks do not really change much from what we already have. We need a star.
denvernuggets,39w9z3,Ediblegoldnuggets,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:42:48 2015 UTC,"Okay. So I did a bit more research on Porzingis.  I gotta say, in kinda impressed.  Like real impressed. He needs to bulk up. A lot. And he's not very explosive which worries me.  But I gotta say, I'd give up 2 firsts for him now.  Let me start with the coaching hire. Dude can run the floor, so assuming Malone wants to run out of defense. A shot blocking, running big, could be very useful.  He can flat out shoot. Not just from deep. But mid range as well.  He's also 20 for the start of next year. By no means finished growing or developing.  His main weaknesses, revolve around strength an feel for the game.  If Malone and Hess are as good as they assume. These could be worked on. A lot. Remeber what we did to mozzy. He cane as just a tall dude. Hess turned him into a 30 min per game big dude.  I think, given the patience and time. He could evolve into an elite offensive big, and some strengths(enough to counter weaknesses) defensively.  He could be a force along side nurk. Who does the grunt work, which Kristas seems afraid of"
denvernuggets,39w9z3,Ediblegoldnuggets,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:16:11 2015 UTC,"Fair points.  If the FO seems him as the best player, and goes and get him, that's fine.  I just wouldn't be happy with losing future assests if he turns to be a bust (about half the league thinks he's either a stud or spud)"
denvernuggets,39w9z3,NUGGman,2,Tue Jun 16 00:58:53 2015 UTC,Only player I would support trading up for is Okafor.
denvernuggets,39w9z3,aatencio91,2,Mon Jun 15 15:02:59 2015 UTC,"I'd be cool with trading up for Russell, too."
denvernuggets,39w9z3,with2nns,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:37:33 2015 UTC,I don't think Russell will fall past the 6ers. I'd trade up for Mudiay in a heartbeat though.
denvernuggets,39w9z3,aatencio91,2,Mon Jun 15 17:10:52 2015 UTC,"Okafor isn't falling past the Lakers, either. We're talking about trading way up in a hypothetical situation."
denvernuggets,39w9z3,with2nns,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:17:04 2015 UTC,"True, but I think a Knicks trade is the only realistic scenario."
denvernuggets,39w9z3,NUGGman,0,Mon Jun 15 17:27:55 2015 UTC,I haven't seen enough Russel to agree. I just know that Okafor looks just like Anthony Davis to me.
denvernuggets,39w9z3,OkAutopilot,0,Mon Jun 15 17:49:46 2015 UTC,Okafor couldn't be further away from Anthony Davis. Okafor is not particularly athletic and he will struggle to guard his position in the league. He was not a good defender in college.
denvernuggets,39w9z3,NUGGman,0,Wed Jun 17 00:17:45 2015 UTC,"No need for hyperbole. We all know he could be further away from Anthony Davis. If he were on the same level as you and I, he would still have room to be further away from Anthony Davis. You don't have to get carried away to get noticed. You can just say that Davis is a much better defender and your point will be understood."
denvernuggets,39w9z3,OkAutopilot,0,Wed Jun 17 00:24:52 2015 UTC,"No need to be snarky about being replied to. It wasn't hyperbole unless you were taking that statement out of context and including you and I instead of understanding that we're talking about high level basketball draft prospects, which I'm sure you ultimately understood."
denvernuggets,39w9z3,with2nns,2,Wed Jun 17 00:28:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't trade 2 1sts for him. If he falls, I'd be ok with taking him. Porzingis/Lauvergne Nurkic/Jokic could set up our front court for a while. Anyone think he can play the 3? If he can that would be beastly."
denvernuggets,39w9z3,growedup,2,Mon Jun 15 17:09:43 2015 UTC,"He's not going to fall, multiple NBA scouts think he's the best player in the draft."
denvernuggets,39w9z3,with2nns,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:48:21 2015 UTC,I think you mean front court?
denvernuggets,39tjon,with2nns,5,Sun Jun 14 17:12:55 2015 UTC,"If we keep Lawson and Faried, yes. If we trade one, probably yes. If we trade both, likely not.  For some reason I can't envision Monroe and Melo working together well. It's a spacing thing. But the real problem is defense. Monroe at 5, Melo at 4 would be a sieve. Melo at 3 on defense is worse. I actually think Melo is somewhat underrated defensively, but I still wouldn't call him anything above average. If they can get a decent center beside Monroe, it'd help, though.  The Knicks also have a bunch of spots to fill. Well, we don't have a coach yet, either, so it'll be more obvious when all this stuff happens."

In 2020 a lot of guys will be in their prime: Nurkic, Harris, Jokic, Joffrey, this and next years draft picks, it will all depend on how good those guys are. If one of those guys is an all-star/all-nba talent, we could be a top 3 seed in the west, but if they all turn out to just be okay, we could be a borderline playoff team.

But having the 7th pick in this draft puts us in a great position to draft an immediate impact player (Winslow or Hezonja preferably).  After that it is time to scrap the mediocre veterans that make up our roster.  Lawson gives our team no identity.  He isn't a scorer, yet he isn't a playmaking assist driven guard either. The bottom line is that he is as good as he ever will be here.  Wilson Chandler or Gallinari need to go, or both.  All these veterans do for us is keep us in the middle of the road, not good enough to make the playoffs and not bad enough to get a top 5 pick.  Give me Faried, Nurkic, and Winslow/Hezonja to build around and maybe Lawson for now."

We'll have offered a max contract to Dellavedova, we'll trade down in the drafts and bring in a bunch of mediocre players and young raw guys which we'll groom to go onto championship teams.

denvernuggets,39mmuv,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Fri Jun 12 20:48:14 2015 UTC,I'd still probably take Winslow. I wouldn't put too much stock in 1 workout.

denvernuggets,39mmuv,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:35:12 2015 UTC,"Not enough offensive moves to be a star offensively. Has decent but sporadic handles, not exactly a driver and finisher despite being very athletic. Great shooter but equally streaky, always has been, and streaky never makes a star. You could say that if he wasn't streaky he could be a star, but at some point you have to resign and admit that it's just who he is."

I actually think he has (or had when younger) more raw talent than most players today, but it doesn't matter when he makes poor decisions constantly and doesn't put in the effort to become great.  I would be glad to have a JR smith like potential talent with a different head on his shoulders, even with a top lotto pick."
denvernuggets,39mmuv,corybyu,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:07:53 2015 UTC,"Fair points. As the Stiffs pointed out on their most recent podcast, we tend to get caught up in comparing prospects to players at their current level, and not what they were like coming into the league.  I think that Hezonja has a bunch of desirable skills already, but also a decent amount of room to grow. While Winslow has a higher ceiling, he also has a lot further to go to get there."
denvernuggets,39mmuv,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Sat Jun 13 06:29:08 2015 UTC,"""Do you really want a young JR Smith?""  What a ridiculous question.

I understand he's European which some people ma find off putting, and he apparently has attitude issues, but come on, he's 20, cut him a break. I'd put his ceiling at all star right along with Johnson and Winslow, I'd be ok with taking any of them."

denvernuggets,39mmuv,aatencio91,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:48:34 2015 UTC,I don't understand the hype (in this subreddit anyway) about Mario.  He's not a high scorer and he plays nearly zero defense.  The excuses everyone is making for him are pretty silly too.  He seems to have the smallest upside of the three and he's already full of himself.  We don't need a Melo ego in a JR Smith body.  Johnson looks like the best bet for us.  I'll be severely disappointed if TC drinks the kool-aid on Mario and we end up with him.  I don't see him improving our team any more than Fournier did.    Edit: Kool-aid.  Mmmm... :)
denvernuggets,39mmuv,chucho320,2,Sat Jun 13 16:15:46 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  I think he's the most physically gifted of the three.  His height and athleticism as a wing give him a D.Wade style skillset.  He has three areas that he needs to work on, which are being a more consistent shooter, playing defense, and taking contact.  Those are all areas that can be improved through coaching though.  If he comes into the league with a good work ethic, the sky is the limit for him."
denvernuggets,39mmuv,Wtfitzchris,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:55:40 2015 UTC,"I like Mario and Winslow equally, and will be satisfied if they take either one of them."
denvernuggets,39mmuv,Corrupted_Engineer,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:38:32 2015 UTC,"I'd take Mario.  Firstly His attitude problems are arrogance and over belief in himself.  Nuggets kinda need someone like that.  Stanley wouldn't be the right choice imo, as he plays the same position as Gallo and Wilson. 3/4. Unless they wanted to trade either Wilson or Gallo (they call themselves brothers, pls don't separate them).  That leaves it between Winslow and Mario. Honestly, I don't think we will have a choice, as one of them may already be off the board. Assuming we do. Let's look at Justise.  Winslow shot well and played great D. Probably a more nba ready player, and will be a better shooter (if the altitude doesn't affect him too much). If the coach wants to play fast (assuming from Conelley, they will), the altitude and his reaction to it may be a factor.  Also need to take into account he played off the best offensive big man in the draft, okafor. That may inflate his stats a touch.  Now Mario didn't get time because the ownership knew he would leave. This is tricky and means his stats are kinda worthless. What he's shown is a good base for the jump shot, quick release, and ma athleticism. I haven't seen a workout vid from him yet. So I'm holding a lot of judgement here.  Mario has that arrogance, belief and wow factor (watch his YouTube, gets me out of my seat every time).  This is what denver needs. In my opinion mario has bust or amazing potential. Probably a higher ceiling, and much lower floor. This risk is what I'd take. As the nuggs don't need any role players. We need stars.  That's what I think.  But honestly. I'd be surprised if he's there. If I were DET or CHA, I'd trade with sac, to ensure I get him."
denvernuggets,39mmuv,Ediblegoldnuggets,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:50:30 2015 UTC,"The infatuation with Mario makes no sense to me.  Mario is more of a shooter then the scorer. The Nuggets don't need a player that can just shoot, at least not with the 7th pick. Maybe he can develop a more complete game, but right now that's to be seen.  I don't like the fact that Winslow took 19 shots off the bounce last year. He probably he can develop that part of his game. But for me that just limits his ceiling. In addition Winslow almost never played in the pick and roll, which is a the system the Nuggets are likely to run. All Compounded by the fact that he had a bad workout with the Nuggets, I just don't see him being the player we draft.  My favorite player in this crop is Stanley Johnson. He can create a shot off the dribble, he plays in the pick and roll, and he has a drive to become a superstar.  Stanley's biggest issues are his shot release, and his finishing ability. However if you watch the tape of Stanley, his shot is a one motion shot and he gets it off quickly. In addition, even with his average touch, his length and explosiveness allows him very reliable potential to finish at the rim.  All in all, I think Stanley will be the player we draft if he's available.  Are scouting team is smart and I think if they're looking for a wing they're going to draft in the Johnson."
denvernuggets,39mmuv,eg14000,4,Fri Jun 12 23:04:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you have seen the DraftExpress videos on Mario, but he definitely isn't a pure shooter; he's also an incredible athlete and can score in the paint, despite not having the best handle. I wouldn't be so quick to discount him, as the draft process continues more and more teams are considering taking him even before pick #7 (at least according to Twitter rumors). I agree that Johnson is a stud and has the will to get better but if you are really looking for a star in this draft, then Mario is your guy. The shooting stroke, athleticism, and borderline insane competitive nature give him the highest ceiling of the three, at least in my opinion."
denvernuggets,39mmuv,imhandy,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:09:02 2015 UTC,"I think you've got Mario pegged backwards.  He's more of a scorer than a shooter, and being a more consistent shooter is something he's going to need to work on in the NBA.  In my opinion, his height, athleticism, and ability to finish at the rim give him the most potential out of the three players being discuessed."

I'm wondering if D'Antoni or another outside HC is holding up the deal over $. I kind of wish they would have just went with Melvin a month ago and didn't even worry about this nonsense."

denvernuggets,39md83,MrFahrenkite,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:53:23 2015 UTC,It's the nature of the business. I'm personally okay with the wait because it seems the FO is really giving thought to find the right fit and direction they want to go and not just fill a vacancy.

denvernuggets,39md83,vdowd,2,Mon Jun 15 04:57:03 2015 UTC,Brian Shaw was head coach of the Nuggets for 125 days of the 2014-15 season. It's been 104 days since he was fired.

denvernuggets,39k7o9,Noored,8,Fri Jun 12 08:34:24 2015 UTC,"Right I have nothing better to do so might as well give a brief, brief summary off the top of my head.  Started in the ABA, became one if the four teams to be incorporated in the NBA. Star player at the time was David Thompson, the first of the nuggets scoring superstars. Known for his athletically and supposedly invented the alley-oop.  Nuggets quickly became known for playing an all-offense, ridiculously fast paced style of play, with their games commonly ending in the 130s for each team in regular time. Star of the 80s was Alex English, the highest scorer in the NBA of the 80s.  From the early 90s to 2003, the nuggets were in the doldrums of the league with the odd exceptional year (1994 being the most vivid, where they became the first team to win a 1v8 seed matchup against the league best Sonics coached by future coach George Karl).  In 2003 the nuggets crafted Carmelo Anthony and began a streak of 9 years straight in the playoffs. Despite regularly making it over 50 wins, they only advanced past the first round once in 2009, where they lost to the Lakers in the WCF.  After trading Carmelo, the nuggets began a starless approach and were rewarded with their best ever regular season in 2013 with 57 wins. However they still lost in the first round and then coach George Karl was fired.  The nuggets tried to implement a slow-it-down approach to better replicate postseason conditions but the personnel didn't suit and the nuggets went back to being one of the lesser teams in the NBA.  That's where we stand now and its time to build for the future with a nice collection of picks as well as young players such as Jusuf Nurkic. The coach the nuggets chose will be a major indicator of how they plan to operate over the next few years so keep your ears open!"

denvernuggets,39j6sy,SummerIsTheBest,12,Fri Jun 12 02:26:44 2015 UTC,"Well since no one else is here (Probably watching the finals!) I'll give it a go.  Since Melo left we got a king's Ransom for him and Chauncey. It was a shame to see Chauncey go, but in return we got Gallo, Chandler, Mozgov and numerous other pieces... the Last remaining piece of the Melo trade puzzle is the chance to switch picks in next years draft with the Knicks.  So Melo left and we played great, fun team basketball but flamed out in the playoffs.  Next we made a swing in trades, moved Nene for JaVale McGee and traded Afflalo for Iggy. In 2013 we had the best year in Nuggets history, winning 57 games and having lots of fun doing it.   At the end of the year the Nuggets lost to a flukey-shooting Warriors outfit (Pretty much the same team which is now a chance to win a championship). The front office reacted by letting then Coach-Of-The-Year George Karl go. This was part of the Nuggets falling from a great fun team to a cellar-dwellar. As well as letting Coach Karl go, the Executive of the year (Ujiri) left us to go to Toronto, Iggy left us to go to Golden State and Danilo Gallinari tore his ACL... and the surgery was botched, keeping him out of action for about 18 months.  Brian Shaw was hired and did a terrible job as head coach before being recently let go.  We currently have some good players, some bad players, some old players, some young players. I think most would agree that Gallo and Jusuf Nurkic are our two best chances at being good! I suppose the Nuggets team as currently constructed might compete for a 8th seed next year if they play well.   The draft is in 2 weeks time, where the nuggets will hopefully draft another young stud to go with out euro-centric outfit (Gallo, Nurkic, Joffrey, Jokic are all Euro's who will be on our roster next year).   Hope that catches you up some! The nuggets have an interesting offseason coming, which will shape the direction they want to go for the next 5 years."
denvernuggets,39j6sy,FraserTheAmazer,3,Fri Jun 12 03:28:51 2015 UTC,"Melo left, along with billups. End that era.  Young team with lots of assests continued to make the playoffs and improve. Focusing around the vet nene. In 2011 we draft Kenneth faried. Who doesn't play much in the first half of the season. Then his first bucket, a  Fernandez behind the head alley oop, lead to the emergence of 'the manimal'.  This lead to a nene trade for javale McGee. Corey brewer and iggy entered, and 2012-13 ended up as a 3 seed, losing to a 6th seed GSW. We also lost Danilo for over 18 months in April 2013, due to an Acl that healed slow/ didn't follow protocol. After this loss, Iggy jumped ship (as was expected,) The FO overhauled the coach and GM. This, IMO, was what caused us to 'fall off the earth'.  We also got very little production from javale in his 2 years, due to injury and a lack of intelligence.  We missed the playoffs last season, and traded the pick down. Ended up with Gary Harris and nurkic.  In 2015 trade deadline, we were expected to move Ty, due to his demeanour regarding the team. Instead we moved javale and stayed quiet. We traded Aaron afflalo for a first rounder and fan fav Barton.  This season we quit on the coach, because he tried to make us play slow, with a roster built to play fast. Our interim got a little too much out of us, so now we have te 7th pick.  Now, we are a team with role players, heading into/already in their peak. With a decnt pick this year, and potential for a great pick in '16 (depends how the Knicks hit in FA). We also have multiple '16 first rounders in Memphis and Portland, from koufus and afflalo trades.  We have some good youth, in nurkic, Harris, jokic (coming from Europe this season, still an unknown). We also have a lot of euro young bigs (take that as you will).  This offseason, we are at a junction. Do we trade Ty and the manimal, look for a rebuild and focus on the youth. Or do we focus around Ty, Kenneth, Gallo and Wilson.  Hope that helps.  ROSTER.  PG. Ty Lawson. Eric green.  SG. Will Barton. Gary Harris. Randy foye. Jamaal franklin  SF Danilo galinari, Wilson chandler,  PF Kenneth faried, JJ Hickson (ugh). Nikola jokic (spelling?)

denvernuggets,39j6sy,tron777,3,Fri Jun 12 13:41:37 2015 UTC,"I'm the inverse of you. I'm an ex Knicks fan who stopped being a fan after Melo arrived. Without a team I slowly picked up on the Nuggets. Several solid players like Inguadala left, They are looking for a new coach, so in transition.    Melo doesn't belong on any team, he's what they call fools gold. If Iverson was the answer Melo is the problem."
denvernuggets,39j6sy,jussumman,2,Fri Jun 12 03:26:29 2015 UTC,"the team is as bad as it has ever been in recent years but it went through a bounty of riches for a long stretch that spoiled a lot of the fan base imo. i'm a huge basketball fan that moved to denver a year ago and i bought season tickets like the first month i moved here so i'm all in.  don't be upset at not being a fan, most fan bases are full of fair-weather fans (and i don't mean that be to negative) just know that sticking through the low points make the high points that much more enjoyable. will this team win a title in the foreseeable future? probably not, basketball is dominated by great players and the likelihood of getting one is slim to none.   nuggets have some young talent and the direction they'll take for the next decade is completely up in the air. now's the time to get in. nuggets are truly ""ground floor"" type stage at this point. there's some young guys that might pan out to be great players and watching them is reason enough imo"
denvernuggets,39j6sy,ParadeShitter,3,Fri Jun 12 04:16:58 2015 UTC,Yeah I get what you're saying about that. I follow the Rapids and they have more lows than highs. Soccer has a bigger pull on me than basketball but I still love basketball. I like the nuggets because I just can't go for anyone else. So I just stopped watching basketball completely
denvernuggets,39j6sy,ParadeShitter,2,Fri Jun 12 04:20:30 2015 UTC,"the thing about basketball is the expectations are generally too high. soccer, hockey, baseball.... big team sports like that you can have a chance for a special season if the cards play out the right way. talent is great but it doesn't define where you'll be whenever the postseason starts.  basketball is almost entirely determined by the talent on the floor. there's so few players playing that they have a bigger impact. there's no way the nuggets will win the championship next year, that's already pre-determined. on one hand that makes watching next season a bit of a bear but if you focus on a few things you like/dislike than you can generally be more interested in a team that's going nowhere (next season)  i know most people here will be watching out newish center (jusef nurkic) play his second year and first full-time season as a starter. a lot of people think and the front office said that he's an ""untouchable"" guy. they have no desires to trade him and most of us think he has a bright future. i'll be interested in watching him develop.  the team should have a couple new faces playing. our #7 pick and nikola jokic. whoever we pick at #7 should get a lot of playing time as a rookie and it's always fun to see and prognosticate whether he'll be the next big thing or something else. plus there's a lot of story lines involving ty lawson and faried... whether they'll be on the team the whole season or whether the team will trade for something else. imo the little inner-team story lines are important to follow and find interest in when the team itself isn't all that successful.   it's a tough sell but there are some bright spots. new talent, new (maybe) coach. new direction. a lot of new for next season"

denvernuggets,39i3kr,aatencio91,8,Thu Jun 11 21:34:27 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up, Darrell Arthur, Ian Clark, and Jamaal Franklin probably won't be on the roster next year, and Nikola Jokic most likely will be.  Erick Green can score, but I don't think he can do much else. Classic SG in a PG's body. He could be a 10 ppg off the bench kind of guy.  Gary Harris is a good defender, athletic, pretty good at driving to the rim, but struggled on offense last year. He had trouble finishing drives and shooting jumpers. If he can get his shot to start falling he could make a huge jump.   Lauvergne is pretty athletic and apparently has a good shot, although you wouldn't guess it judging by how he was shooting last season. Not sure about his defense. I think he's a decent rebounder. He could be, I don't know, a backup stretch 4?  Nurkic is the team's centerpiece. Great size, great rebounder, above average defender, has a decent post game but can't finish. Also commits a ton of fouls. He's probably the only guy who has real all star potential.  There's also a good post going over Jokic on the front page. Probably will turn out to be a stretch 4 or 5. No idea about his ceiling."

denvernuggets,39i3kr,NUGGman,2,Thu Jun 11 23:01:56 2015 UTC,"I'll fill in a few blanks here, but my main contribution will be sharing all of the nicknames for the players!  To Start, it's worth mentioning that JJ Hickson is universally disliked here. He didn't have a bad season in 13-14, and was a double-double machine that was unreliable on defense. Last season, he stopped scoring at the rim and played even worse defense, so don't be surprised if the FO ships him out for pennies on the dollar.   Now on to the nicknames:   Ty Lawson: Chico (not often used), Tha Show Stoppa (not often used) Will Barton: The People's Champ, Thrill Randy Foye: FOY3, Foye Boy (not often used) Wilson Chandler: Ill Wil, Juggernaut (not often used) Danilo Gallinari: Gallo Kenneth Faried: The Manimal Joffrey Lauvergne: JoLo, King Joffrey Jusuf Nurkic: Juka, The Bosnian Beast   Players that still need nicknames:   Gary Harris ( I've just been using Young Gary Erick Green Nikola Jokic"
denvernuggets,39i3kr,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Fri Jun 12 01:17:26 2015 UTC,"I'm going to start off with just a couple guys:  Darrell Arthur is a ""stretch 4"" meaning he's a PF who likes to be near the arc. He usually is involved in setting picks for pick and rolls and is good at making that 2 pt shot just inside the arc if both defenders roll to the guard or whoever the pick is being set for. He was acquired via trade when Brian Shaw took over (Koufos for Arthur from Memphis). He is a player in the mold of what Brian Shaw liked (as opposed to Faried, who's style Shaw did not seem to care for)  Will Barton is loved by everyone, including the Trail Blazers fans. He is a guy with a positive attitude that is infectious and good for a team. He plays hard and is great in transition. This gets brought up almost too often, but he reminds a lot of us fans of Corey Brewer, with his body type, style of play, and effort.  Hickson was another PF signed when Brian Shaw took over. He is a decent rebounder with some decent athletic ability for his size. He's in a similar mold to Kenneth Faried. You won't find a lot of fans who are too attached to Hickson though. He has had his share of disappointing plays.  This is just a start. Hopefully other people will jump in and help."
denvernuggets,39i3kr,NUGGman,0,Thu Jun 11 22:22:22 2015 UTC,"Not everyone will agree with me, but I think it's the perfect opportunity to tank 2016. Reasons being is that I think every bottom team this year except for a few will be improvers or are looking more towards to win.  We can take this opportunity to bottom out for someone like Simmons and can certainly make a roster bad enough by  trading guys like Ty, Chandler, Faried for picks."

denvernuggets,39i3kr,NUGGman,2,Thu Jun 11 22:59:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't think ours will take that long.

Players tend to dread playing in Denver, especially on the 2nd night of a back to back, and maybe the idea of playing 41 games a year here isn't appealing. It's kinda cold, though I think our reputation is that of a much colder city than it actually is. Oftentimes it's pretty mild in winter, but I think people tend to think of it as a snowy mountain city. Not a very big population compared to a number of other cities in the NBA, which hurts endorsement potential Basketball is the 3rd or 4th most popular sport here, they wouldn't feel like they owned the city like the Broncos/Peyton probably do Most ball players grow up in California, the Midwest, or East coast, and Denver is pretty far from all those areas, so we aren't likely to get a hometown discount, since most players won't have relatives nearby Some of the things that make Denver great are not really available to NBA players, like skiing and smoking legal weed. They're either too busy or prohibited from partaking."
denvernuggets,39gt34,aatencio91,2,Thu Jun 11 17:49:58 2015 UTC,"The altitude. Players tend to dread playing in Denver, especially on the 2nd night of a back to back, and maybe the idea of playing 41 games a year here isn't appealing.   But the Avs and Broncos don't have issues signing guys because of altitude. For the Broncos you can say that they have more time to rest between games and shorter seasons, but the Avs play an identical schedule to the Nuggets. Many world class athletes like to train here and elsewhere because of the advantages of training at altitude.   It's kinda cold, though I think our reputation is that of a much colder city than it actually is. Oftentimes it's pretty mild in winter, but I think people tend to think of it as a snowy mountain city.   This misconception could be a big factor. I've heard people say ""I want to move to Denver, but I already hate New York winters."" People who haven't been to Denver seem to think that it's IN the mountains.   Not a very big population compared to a number of other cities in the NBA, which hurts endorsement potential   Melo got a branch of the Jordan shoes while he was in Denver, though. Peyton Manning is in every commercial that Aaron Rodgers was too busy to do.   Basketball is the 3rd or 4th most popular sport here, they wouldn't feel like they owned the city like the Broncos/Peyton probably do   That's fair, I think, but even when the Nuggets were good with Melo/Karl they had to acquire guys like Billups through trades.   Most ball players grow up in California, the Midwest, or East coast, and Denver is pretty far from all those areas, so we aren't likely to get a hometown discount, since most players won't have relatives nearby   I wish all of the other California and midwest transplants felt the same way sometimes...   Some of the things that make Denver great are not really available to NBA players, like skiing and smoking legal weed. They're either too busy or prohibited from partaking   Again though, the Broncos and Avalanche don't suffer from players not being able to ski or smoke pot.  I'm not arguing with you, but with the ideas that are out there that free agents seem to have about our town. Overall I think you're right, but they're all wrong, dammit."
denvernuggets,39gt34,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:06:22 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think everyone is wrong here. It's not the altitude, or because basketball players are drawn to the coast. The reason why this is not current a destination for free agents are:   Lack of a strong FO with a clear direction lack of a winning culture lack of high talent players to team up with   Let's be real here- Houston, San Antonio, Cleveland, and a number of cities are objectively not as attractive as Denver is to the general NBA star demographic. Why then, do they all have better players willing to stay there than we do? I think that comes down to the three criteria I pointed out. Without those, it won't matter how hard it is to play at altitude or how crap our nightlife is."
denvernuggets,39gt34,aatencio91,2,Thu Jun 11 21:17:17 2015 UTC,But the Nuggets had that for a little while under Karl/Ujiri and with Melo/Chauncey/everyone.
denvernuggets,39gt34,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:24:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed- That's a reason for why we were able to bring in guys like AI, Kenyon, JR, and Nene. Could we pull any of them here with this current club culture? Nene, maybe, but we sure couldn't get the rest."
denvernuggets,39gt34,NUGGman,2,Thu Jun 11 21:27:51 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. Think about that again. Kenyon was the only one to have a choice about signing here and we payed him a boatload of money. He would have been a fool not to sign here. If we wanted to overpay another old player now, I'm sure we could attract one. But we're looking for a young core.  We traded for AI and JR and drafted Nene."

Heck, Faried gets constantly dogged.   Ever since we lost to Golden State in the playoffs there has been nothing but finger pointing and trash talking going on in our media, vilifying a legendary coach, 2 team USA players, McGee, Lawson, our players effort, their desire. It's not a very appealing place right now. Although, things did turn around when Hunt took over and started giving credit for the good things happening and started trying to build off that rather than just talk trash about what you aren't doing well.  If Hunt sticks around, we might be a place players want to play at. But right now, they don't even know who the coach is going to be and nobody is excited to play in a situation where they don't know who will be their direct supervisor."

denvernuggets,39gt34,NUGGman,0,Thu Jun 11 17:19:50 2015 UTC,"Neither of those cities like to talk trash to their players on twitter. If any player is paying any attention to what Denver fanatics are doing to Ty Lawson and notice how we love to run great players, coaches, and GM's out of town won't be interested in here.   That's probably why we focus on the foreign players who aren't aware of this, and are just happy to be in the league."

Rather than people who watch most of his college career vs watching him workout for a day or two isn't much of a comparison. Anything could effect the workouts.   Not saying he's good, or we should draft him as I don't watch any college ball. Just pointing out the obvious."

I personally already had skepticism of him coming in to work out. I don't think he has star potential, and this bad workout is just more evidence to me.  In addition the media said it was one the worst workouts they ever seen. I know the work out shouldn't matter as much as the tape, but one of the worst workouts ever, I'm not sure how to take that."

denvernuggets,39hfxj,eg14000,3,Thu Jun 11 19:08:18 2015 UTC,"I heard we were close to sign Bosh, just as close as Houston. However the media didn't report on us heavenly because we're the Nuggets.  The moral of the story is that I have a lot of trust in the Nuggets front office they seem to be knowing what they're doing. The year they hired Brian Shaw, the franchise in a little bit of chaos. Now that they're stable, they're taking their time with the coaching search and taking it seriously. Interviewing every single possible person that could be right for the job."

denvernuggets,39dig4,ParadeShitter,3,Thu Jun 11 02:50:49 2015 UTC,He's pretty bulky for his age and actually has a big wingspan. His lateral quickness/athleticism is what lets him down. Hopefully he can get better with his fundamentals so compensate for his lack of athleticism.

I think he's pretty clearly a 4. If he struggles on defense and rebounding you're going to have issues running him at the 5. Though, he has the size and he's only 20 so maybe it's just a question of growing into his body."

I think that's relevant information.  And objectively, it looks bad. Real bad.  Either he's being scapegoated, or he really did a shitty, shady, weasel-ish job in Sacramento."
denvernuggets,39bhyv,JMadFour,2,Wed Jun 10 18:01:55 2015 UTC,I've got no love for him. I know very little about him. His history outside of Sacramento is actually pretty good looking. He was part of the FO when GSW started getting turned around and he worked under Masai Ujiri in Denver and helped Ujiri through some weird times in Nuggets history.
denvernuggets,39bhyv,aatencio91,0,Wed Jun 10 18:05:45 2015 UTC,"Mike Malone signing on as HC would force me to reconsider my position.  Given what was said to have gone down and how, there should theoretically be an absolute 0% chance that he would choose to work with A'lessandro again."

Malone and PDA never coexisted like coaches and GM's should to the point where they never talked to each other last summer.

denvernuggets,39bhyv,deprivedaccountant,2,Thu Jun 11 00:25:46 2015 UTC,"Yea more reliable according to who?  What national guys are more reliable than woj?  Who are Jason Jones' and Aaron Bruski's sources I wonder?    Woj's main point is that PDA wasn't necessarily the one making the decisions, he was getting to give his input but was only a GM in title.  And Rudy Gay, Collison, McLemore, McCallum, Caspi were not bad moves.  Firing Malone probably was not a smart choice but I have to believe that Pete ultimately supported it because he saw an opportunity to get Karl in there and I don't really blame him for wanting that.  Do you say that Ujiri is a bad GM because of the Javale deal?   I saw that video where the Kings drafted Stauskas - that was the Vivek show all the way.  Stauskas? Stauskas?! He can't keep his hands off and ended up driving out two very smart basketball minds (wonder why Mullin didn't want the job).   Rookie owner acting like one."
denvernuggets,39bhyv,phatlever,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:56:35 2015 UTC,"More reliable according to kings fans who have full reason to trust someone like Bruski's sources over Woj's especially after the 2013 relocation drama.  Everything that is said in that article contradicts every report during the firing especially the stuff he's said on record about taking full responsibility for getting rid of Malone.   To say that PDA wasn't making the decisions could not be farther from the truth especially when you acknowledge that he fired Malone. Yes most of those moves (Mclemore wasn't his pick) were great but at the end of the day the team failed to reach 30 wins because of his boneheaded decision during mid season and the fact that he let young assets walk away for nothing doesn't help is case either. If he saw an opportunity to hire Karl he would have hired him immediately but no the only reason he hired him a month later was to try and save his own ass after the owners/players/fans were getting restless with the 0 results of PDA's master plan of keeping Ty Corbin as head coach for the rest of the season. BTW you're giving Mullin way to much credit as a ""very smart basketball mind"" when he wasn't getting high opinions during his Golden State GM years."
denvernuggets,39bhyv,deprivedaccountant,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:25:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed regarding Malone, but the fact still remains that Vivek obviously has his hands all over this team, and at any point could have vetoed the coaching change.  He was clearly on board to do it too.  And if that was pete's biggest fault, wanting his own coach and being too attached to Karl, I'm glad to have him back.  He knows his shit, and seemed to be ahead of the curve in analytics and cap.  Vivek is too impatient and will always advocate for change if the team isn't in the playoffs.  A new GM is going to want his coach, GK and Boogie will get annoyed with each other, the team will underachieve, Vivek will get antsy, rinse, and repeat."
denvernuggets,39bhyv,phatlever,3,Thu Jun 11 23:48:12 2015 UTC,"Connelly is still the GM though. And who knows what Pete's actual role will be. For what it's worth, I imagine the prospective hiring of Pete and interviewing of Malone happened at the same time. I have a hard time believing they'd do that with some understanding you can't hire both guys. I wouldn't rule Malone out."

denvernuggets,39bhyv,Status_Flux,2,Wed Jun 10 20:32:47 2015 UTC,"Kings fan here.  We are ecstatic that he is leaving. While he made decent roster moves and is a well known cap expert, he has also made some strange moves and has done many things wrong on the PR side of things.  He's the main man responsible for the firing of Mike Malone, who at the time had seemingly made tremendous strides with our young roster. He is suspected to have been at the head of many leaks to the press which has angered many players, executives and coaches around the league. That includes the rumor of DeMarcus Cousins' opposition to the George Karl hiring.   Most of his good moves were seemingly no-brainers, there wasn't really anything earth shattering that he had gotten accomplished.  If you have a free hour and would like a detailed summary of his entire tenure you can listen to this kings podcast: http://cowbellkingdom.com/ck-podcast-ep-201-the-pete-dalessandro-situation/"
denvernuggets,39bhyv,The-Hot-Tamale,2,Wed Jun 10 23:50:52 2015 UTC,"Hey kings fan. Just wondering what you think of your crazy owner.  It literally seems like all his front office are fired or leave (only 2 positions, but pretty important positions IMO).  Not a great sign..."
denvernuggets,39bhyv,Ediblegoldnuggets,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:32:07 2015 UTC,"He's ok. Seems to demand success a little sooner than he really should. Has more of a say on the basketball wide of things than I feel he should. However he's a significant upgrade over the Magoofs, so I can't complain too much.  Mullin left to be a head coach at his alma matter, wish I would imagine to be a dream come true for many so I don't think it really says anything about the Kings. And I'm sure he makes more there. Pete was by all accounts about to be fired and had no say in the FO so I'd leave if I were in his shoes as well. Also, since they haven't announced(from what I've seen so far) a title for him, I would speculate its a demotion.  Yes the kings have become a joke and a complete embarrassment of a franchise but that is largely due to Petey D who, thankfully, is on his way out the door. Unfortunately, hes heading straight into yours."
denvernuggets,39bhyv,The-Hot-Tamale,2,Thu Jun 11 00:57:23 2015 UTC,"That's where we disagree a little.  Petey D is essentially a glorified basketball accountant, and is bloody good at it.  In terms of decision making etc. like you said, he's not a people person.  This makes his current position beneficial for him and denver. He doesn't need to make decisions, and is just a higher up cap manager.  Also, he's apparently in charge of 2 teams. So he may not be involved in decisions, just a trustworthy adversary to the owner. But he gets a title (U.S) Thursday.  We shall see"
denvernuggets,39bhyv,Ediblegoldnuggets,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:27:33 2015 UTC,"I pretty much agree with all you said there. You just have to find a way to completely block him from ever talking to a reporter. If all he does is crunch numbers, then its a fantastic pick up for the Nuggets and Avs. However, judging by how manipulative, selfish and disrespectful he was here, I think he's going to try to take over that front office. That is what I'd be worried about as a Nuggets fan"
denvernuggets,39bhyv,The-Hot-Tamale,2,Thu Jun 11 01:43:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Agreed.  Maybe Denver sent him as a spy, ruined SAC's coaching and FO, then hired Karl to do an old buddy a favour, then head home... But legit. Connelly is a pure people person. Not sure what else he can do. If they work together it may g, or really bad"
denvernuggets,39bhyv,Ediblegoldnuggets,2,Thu Jun 11 01:47:19 2015 UTC,"That would explain a lot...   If they can work together then the Nuggets could be heading into a great era of basketball. Having grown up as an Avs fan, I certainly hope it all works out for the best. Unfortunately though, if there's one thing we learned about Petey these last couple years it's that he values himself over all else, including team success"
denvernuggets,39bhyv,The-Hot-Tamale,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:08:15 2015 UTC,"What makes you think Pete is behind all these decisions?  Why do you trust Sac beat writers more than woj?  Vivek seems to be the most hands-on owner in the league, what makes you think these weren't his decisions?"
denvernuggets,39bhyv,phatlever,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:26:37 2015 UTC,"For starters, everyone knows Woj's ""sources"" are from Pete's office. Also it's basically every local guy vs Woj. I'll believe 20 guys that all say the same thing before I believe just one that says the opposite. As a national guy who has no interest in the Kings, he isn't around the team, trying to uncover stories like they are. The only reason he'll report on them is when someone(Pete) calls him and says, ""Hey I've got something for you."" All the rest of these guys are in Sac, talking to FO guys, players, and whoever else is here every day.  Also, the worst decision that was made during his tenure was the firing of Malone. Pete and Mullin flew to Vegas to see Vivek and convince him to fire him while he was at a convention there."
denvernuggets,39bhyv,The-Hot-Tamale,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:00:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, I get that Pete was Woj's main source.  But how many times has Woj been just dead wrong?  And even if Pete did fire Malone (which I agree was in retrospect a bad decision) I'll take that any day if that was his biggest blunder.  For sure take that over an almost max Javale McGee deal for 4 years.  And Vivek can't just wash his hands of this.  So you think he has a say in every other decision, but on a coaching change he just backs off and lets the professionals do their job?  His GM/VP/Consultant jobs are revolving doors for this very reason.  Watch how long Vlade lasts with his seasoned front office experience.  Vivek should have just vetoed the midseason coaching change and let people he hired worry about the roster, instead he did it the other way around."
denvernuggets,39bhyv,phatlever,3,Thu Jun 11 23:34:01 2015 UTC,More incompetence in the front office?
denvernuggets,39bhyv,denverNUGGs,6,Wed Jun 10 17:23:00 2015 UTC,"How is Pete incompetent? He was an important part of the Ujiri era, and he also helped draft some of the studs on GSW."
denvernuggets,39bhyv,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Wed Jun 10 17:30:35 2015 UTC,"It was a question, looks like the kings fans in /r/nba are happy he's gone"
denvernuggets,39bhyv,denverNUGGs,3,Wed Jun 10 17:31:59 2015 UTC,"Looks like they're just bitter as fuck. I can relate to an extent, but I don't wholly trust their assessment."
denvernuggets,39bhyv,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Wed Jun 10 17:37:13 2015 UTC,They are called fanatics for a reason
denvernuggets,39bhyv,NUGGman,2,Wed Jun 10 17:47:09 2015 UTC,"Ahh ok, I admittedly don't know much about front office personnel."
denvernuggets,39bhyv,denverNUGGs,3,Wed Jun 10 17:52:35 2015 UTC,Maybe he just realised being a GM wasn't for him?
denvernuggets,39bhyv,pairidaeza,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:03:44 2015 UTC,He basically had no power there after the owner brought in Vlade Divac and made him the main voice of the front office.  There seems to be a lot of stuff that went on with the Kings FO.  Kinda makes you feel like the Nuggets are normal compared to the dysfunction that goes on over there.
denvernuggets,39bhyv,manimalplanet35,2,Mon Jun 15 14:20:59 2015 UTC,"doesn't it take a good 3-4-5 years to see how moves really work out? Sure, he might be getting hate for one move, but we can really only see what the ultimate goal is way down the road."
denvernuggets,39bhyv,treader19,3,Wed Jun 10 18:23:16 2015 UTC,"Haha wow, so he takes what he thinks is a promotion in Sacramento only to learn that he's really Vivek's puppet (Stauskas?!), then manages to do his friend George a solid and get him hired as the HC, before returning back to the same job he had before.  Crazy.  If he had just waited a year he would have had Connely's job now.  That has to be a tough pill to swallow.  I'm thrilled he's back though!"
denvernuggets,39b2ne,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Wed Jun 10 15:25:45 2015 UTC,"He's like if you combined Van Vesely with Bargnani.  Individually they are busts, but combined they can be a star"
denvernuggets,39b2ne,eg14000,2,Wed Jun 10 23:47:30 2015 UTC,He looks like he could be a great shooting big man with enough talent to work it down low. My problem is he is way undersized to bang down low. Once he puts on some weight he could be good. If i'm the Nuggs though im not touching this guy with  a 10 foot pole we have bigger needs at the moment then adding another big man.
denvernuggets,39b2ne,THECHUNGAWANGA,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:45:14 2015 UTC,"would not touch, but I was thinking last night in the situation where we somehow end up with him.... how cool would it be to have an offense where 1-5 can all shoot out to the 3pt line??"
denvernuggets,39b2ne,The_NGUYENNER,2,Wed Jun 10 16:32:20 2015 UTC,"That would be insane. I think everyone here is probably getting that Tskita vibe a bit too much, the FO would be under fire until he made the All-Star team."
denvernuggets,39b2ne,Ediblegoldnuggets,3,Wed Jun 10 16:35:15 2015 UTC,"I think the Internet and scouting evolution means it won't be soo much like Tskita, but end more like bargnani... So I still wouldn't touch."

denvernuggets,39b2ne,tron777,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:42:23 2015 UTC,"This NBA hipster was targeting Porzingas before it was cool.  Though, I'm not as excited about him this year. His passing and toughness worry me and I'm less convinced he will be good on defense."
denvernuggets,3964c3,Ediblegoldnuggets,9,Tue Jun 9 15:05:42 2015 UTC,"Keep both of them, draft Hezonja, see how things shake out with that roster and hope like hell that the Knicks suck balls next year."
denvernuggets,3964c3,d-lo_tha_boss,5,Tue Jun 9 17:18:28 2015 UTC,"Everybody is so quick to want to trade Ty these days.  Sure he got a DUI this season, and he's often caught wearing other teams apparel, and he said he would like to play with Dirk, which people have been translating to him wanting to play in Dallas.  I bet most players would like to play with Dirk.  Since George Karl has left, Ty has elevated his game.  I'm too lazy to look up stats, but he was top 10 in assists per game, maybe even top 5.  He would be an all star if the west wasn't so stacked in guards.  The problem is that the Nuggets wanted him to be a leader, which just isn't in his blood.  If we trade Ty, we are taking a step backwards in the point position."
denvernuggets,3964c3,denverNUGGs,2,Tue Jun 9 15:23:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed 100%. The only trade id consider would be a player with star potential. Not sure there is too many of them laying about, and I'm almost 100% we won't get it for just Ty and the 7th. Never know but."
denvernuggets,3964c3,aatencio91,2,Tue Jun 9 15:29:09 2015 UTC,"If we trade Ty, we are taking a step backwards in the point position.    At this juncture, isn't it a reasonable idea to take another step backward before taking a leap forward? The Nuggets have been awful for two years while trying to make Ty the leader and the 1st option scorer. The sooner we accept that he can't be that guy, the better. Maybe they don't have to move him, but if they could move him for a top-4 pick, they could get D'Angelo Russell or Emmanuel Mudiay."
denvernuggets,3964c3,imhandy,3,Tue Jun 9 16:41:49 2015 UTC,"That's it exactly. Trading Ty isn't about becoming immediately better, it's about building long-term. I see this being especially successful if Mudiay or Russell happens to fall to that 6th pick (not likely but worth being prepared for, especially with the Knicks being the Knicks). If we could trade Ty for one of those two, then that deal starts to make a lot of sense. It doesn't help the case for keeping him that it really doesn't seem like Ty wants to be here anymore, doesn't want to carry a team, and still has a good deal of trade value."
denvernuggets,3964c3,with2nns,4,Wed Jun 10 04:07:32 2015 UTC,"Trade them both and try to land high draft picks. We're not a free agent destination, I think we'll have a really hard time signing guys at or above Ty's level, and even then they'll be tier 2 guys at best which won't win us the championship. That leaves trying to draft a superstar, and trading Ty and Faried is our best bet at doing so imo."
denvernuggets,3964c3,phatlever,5,Tue Jun 9 16:22:37 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. But who would give up a top 4 pick in this draft for Ty or faried or a package? Unless of course we are looking at future first rounders, but I wouldn't want to be relying on luck after giving up major role players to contend.  Also. It makes sense to be good this year, as we have a pick swap next year with NYK."
denvernuggets,3964c3,phatlever,2,Wed Jun 10 01:35:57 2015 UTC,"You're exactly right about trying to compete this year since we have the NYK pick swap, but we should still strongly consider trading Ty.  Whereas Faried's stock, in my opinion, is slightly undervalued at the moment, Ty's value very likely won't be improving.  His contract is shorter and soon is going to be considered a rental, and I think he's not nearly as consistent when the team is rebuilding.  Most importantly, I got a lot of faith in Jameer Nelson, I think he can run the show for a year, at least reasonably close to how Ty did last year.  Plus PG is the easiest position to replace in the league.  We don't have a good proven backup at the 4 which is why Faried is more valuable to us.  And Ty's probably not going to reup with us, which is probably smart on his part, he should be the 3rd best player on a playoff team.  And imagine what we could do with 2 of the top 7 picks in the draft.  Stanley Johnson /Mario/Winslow/Cauleystein.  Whatever coach we get is gonna (hopefully) want to push the pace and those guys would all thrive.  Then throw in that guaranteed lottery pick from the Knicks next year :) and we could be looking at a bright future."
denvernuggets,3964c3,with2nns,3,Wed Jun 10 02:35:22 2015 UTC,Good points man. Any chance you can drink out of the fountain of youth and play next year.
denvernuggets,3964c3,phatlever,3,Wed Jun 10 03:04:38 2015 UTC,Ha you don't want that - Phat Lever is Fat's actually fat twin brother
denvernuggets,3964c3,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Wed Jun 10 17:41:41 2015 UTC,Nelson opted out.
denvernuggets,3964c3,with2nns,3,Wed Jun 10 02:45:30 2015 UTC,Haha well scratch the most important part of all that.  But I still think PG is replaceable and I would probably take 5 years of a lottery pick vs 2 years for Ty.
denvernuggets,3964c3,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Wed Jun 10 02:56:28 2015 UTC,"He did, but he hasn't made his intentions clear."
denvernuggets,3964c3,with2nns,2,Wed Jun 10 22:40:58 2015 UTC,"True, but I think it's unfair to expect him to stay."
denvernuggets,3964c3,with2nns,2,Thu Jun 11 04:11:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think he's fully in his rights to get the best deal possible. I do hope that he stays here though, I was very impressed with him."
denvernuggets,3964c3,with2nns,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:14:33 2015 UTC,"We could probably snag NY's #4. How I see the Knicks' swap scenario is; if we can get Mudiay at a good price we have to do it. And  even if the FO  doesn't trade Lawson and Faried like they're apparently planning on doing, what are the odds we'll be better than a Melo lead Knicks team + (probably) Demarre Carroll and/or Greg Monroe tier guy in the eastern conference? Might as well draft high the next 2 years than high/mid-high/mid and hope things work out."
denvernuggets,3964c3,Nugforlife,2,Wed Jun 10 02:39:05 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I have faith the Knicks will suck this year. But I'm hearing NY want Winslow. Magic don't need a point, so a SAC trade for 6th could be the best way to get mudiay."
denvernuggets,3964c3,Status_Flux,2,Wed Jun 10 03:06:53 2015 UTC,"I'm wary of pre-draft news like that, but that's a weird situation in itself. Do we try and trade for the #4 and guarantee Mudiay, or risk NY passing on him and SAC wanting Ty more?"
denvernuggets,3964c3,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:18:27 2015 UTC,I think the draft is such a crapshoot anyways (slightly more educated crapshoot in the last 5 years though).
denvernuggets,3964c3,Status_Flux,2,Wed Jun 10 03:28:11 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping some ""higher the pick lower the risk"" rule works out for us."
denvernuggets,3964c3,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Wed Jun 10 03:49:24 2015 UTC,I like your thinking.
denvernuggets,3964c3,NUGGman,4,Wed Jun 10 01:55:10 2015 UTC,"If Mudiay is still there at 6, I would be up for trading Ty, but otherwise I don't think it makes sense. Faried's still young and I think has time to grow into a guy who can provide 16/11 with decent defense. His value's not very high right now anyway and I don't think we could get enough in return should he be traded. I would be open to offers on either of them, but I wouldn't be actively shopping them."
denvernuggets,3964c3,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Tue Jun 9 16:30:27 2015 UTC,"If you were SAC, wouldn't you take Mudiay over Ty?"
denvernuggets,3964c3,NUGGman,4,Tue Jun 9 17:24:21 2015 UTC,"Hmm probably not honestly. I think they want to win now, and Ty + Cousins + Gay will definitely get them into the playoffs. Also Mudiay might be too slow to develop for them at this point."
denvernuggets,3964c3,NUGGman,3,Tue Jun 9 17:34:57 2015 UTC,Good point!
denvernuggets,3964c3,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Jun 9 17:43:54 2015 UTC,Of course! Do you have any idea the difference in pay? Mudiay would be much more bang for the buck.
denvernuggets,3964c3,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:34:43 2015 UTC,"If you're trying get to contend next year though, your chances of Mudiay playing better than Ty are pretty low."
denvernuggets,3964c3,checkag,3,Tue Jun 9 20:36:56 2015 UTC,"If they went with Mudiay, they could have another $10 mil to get an impact player or two."
denvernuggets,3964c3,checkag,3,Tue Jun 9 20:40:29 2015 UTC,"I'd rather trade Ty than Kenneth. I'm not sure we can get top effort out of Ty, he seems to have lost his drive to be here and you can't fake that. I would not trade Faried unless it was an offer you can't refuse, like Blake Griffin or somebody who is better. But contrary to what most Nuggets fans think, there aren't many better players out there that the Nuggets could get. I'm pretty sure we signed Hickson to replace Faried and I think it's pretty obvious that Faried is much better than Hickson.  After Hunt took over last season, Faried lead us in scoring and rebounds most games and was really a big factor in games. I think you need to build on your strengths and at this point our strengths are Faried and Gallo."
denvernuggets,3964c3,checkag,2,Tue Jun 9 20:19:57 2015 UTC,"I would only trade Ty for a lottery pick and a future first, or a some decent young players (hey Kings). I think he's that valuable. On a contending team with a strong coach and a veteran leader (or two), I think Ty could really shine. As for keeping him here, I think he does truly enjoy this city and care about the fans. Has he made some mistakes? Sure. But those aren't the kind of mistakes I dwell on for too long. I just worry that if the culture of our club doesn't turn around, he will never want to give his all to this team again, which is a real bummer.   As for Faried, it's tough to decide what to do. I've been saying since before last season started that I think he was waaay overhyped by his Team USA success (which he earned), and that really forced the Nuggets to play him in a way that wasn't best suited towards him. I think Faried is best used off the bench, but he's now got a paycheck and an ego that won't let that ever happen again here. I think we would be best served by including him in a package deal instead of trading him individually."
denvernuggets,3964c3,minutemandan,2,Tue Jun 9 15:37:19 2015 UTC,You mentioned kings. Just wondering what kings players specifically.  If I were sac I would maybe look at McCallum and picks for Ty. I wouldn't expect to get much more back. Hence no trade for me.
denvernuggets,3962az,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Tue Jun 9 14:51:12 2015 UTC,"I feel like our management is just fucking with us now. Are they seriously considering these guys? First the Wizards head coach, then Mike Malone, then the trail blazers... Maybe we're secretly searching for assistant coaches?"

denvernuggets,3962az,corybyu,2,Tue Jun 9 22:03:32 2015 UTC,"That's how we ended up with Shaw, right? Personally I'm all for the best coach for the team. I think right now that Melvin Hunt is the best option. It just seems to me like they're picking these guys at random, however."
denvernuggets,3962az,tron777,2,Tue Jun 9 23:18:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think if we're going with someone unproven it should be Melvin, he already at least has rapport with the team."
denvernuggets,3962az,Futurebrain,2,Wed Jun 10 00:41:38 2015 UTC,"Just because you haven't heard of him doesn't mean he's a nobody.

denvernuggets,394xpz,bettycrockerpot,3,Tue Jun 9 08:02:45 2015 UTC,He got fired because the Kings ownership have unreleastic expectations.  The Kings barely improved with Karl.

denvernuggets,394xpz,NUGGman,5,Tue Jun 9 07:57:43 2015 UTC,New One of our own Already has chemistry with the players
denvernuggets,394xpz,eg14000,3,Tue Jun 9 07:58:47 2015 UTC,"Hunt also showed some ability to motivate and get the players on board.  Danilo ( our true leader ) has outwardly said he wants hunt for coach. This was a month ago and may be a little outdated, but imagine if we hire D'antoni, and he couldn't get across to the players. Another mutiny an another wasted year or 2. Remember mikes been out of the game for a couple years. His calling card and revolution at Offense is now standard. It would be interesting to see how he would go, but I'd prefer to hire the guy that's seen success with the club. Wasn't he Karl's lead assistant when the won plying fast?"
denvernuggets,394xpz,NUGGman,5,Tue Jun 9 08:12:04 2015 UTC,"On the flip side, D'Antoni has history with Gallo.  And yes, Hunt has been with the team since 2010."
denvernuggets,394xpz,NUGGman,2,Tue Jun 9 08:13:16 2015 UTC,Good or bad history? I'm not sure how he felt with him as coach.
denvernuggets,394xpz,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Jun 9 08:14:29 2015 UTC,"Considering that Gallo said he'd rather have Hunt than D'Antonio, I think it's safe to assume it was worse for Gallo than the past 3 seasons have been."
denvernuggets,393lzz,pairidaeza,4,Tue Jun 9 00:41:45 2015 UTC,"I mean, he's great and all, but to me he seems like a toner, slightly better Javalle McGee. If we could trade ty for the 6th pick, I would be alright taking him, but would rather we try for someone else"

That's a lot of dudes who have shown promise."
denvernuggets,394qi9,eg14000,6,Tue Jun 9 06:28:37 2015 UTC,"Lin's numbers during ""Linsanity"" were 25 points and 9 assists. Bearing that in mind, he has never averaged more than 15 over an entire season. That said, if he can average 25 points and 9 assists, I think he'll be very close to MVP material.  PS I've tagged you as ""Linsane"" on account of your love for Lin :D"
denvernuggets,394qi9,pairidaeza,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:34:09 2015 UTC,Even CP3/Rose in their prime couldn't average 25 points and 9 assists - talking about Linsane.
denvernuggets,394qi9,Lorenzomax,7,Tue Jun 9 17:31:27 2015 UTC,uhh... no  linsanity is over. jeremy lin is not an mvp level player.
denvernuggets,394qi9,ParadeShitter,0,Tue Jun 9 15:36:15 2015 UTC,"Did you also want us to trade Gallo during the time he was inured? Fans are not patient (me included) Just because a player struggled for a while In a different system doesn't make him a different player.  Every thing Lin did during Linsanity (including scoring the most points in the first 5 starts in NBA history) was not a ""fluke"". And if you set up a similar situation he could do it again.  All I'm doing is pointing out it is possible Lin could be a MVP.  If Durant goes and puts up 35 a night he get my vote, but Don't just blindly count this out as a possibility."
denvernuggets,394qi9,ParadeShitter,7,Tue Jun 9 18:57:43 2015 UTC,"wat?   if you're going to say crazy things like ""jeremy lin could be an mvp"" you have to come with more as evidence than just ""maybe"".  from everything i've seen, there's no way jeremy lin could be an mvp in this league. is this a knock on jeremy lin? no. is it blasphemy to say he can't be an mvp? no. mvp means ""the very best player, that year"". jeremy lin will never be the very best player in any year. can he be a capable player in this league? sure.   don't take it personal but he's not a complete enough player to even be in the conversation. he's a pretty awful defender and has to play in a very particular system to succeed. he doesn't score the ball efficiently enough to be anything more than a below average starter or a decent backup point guard in this league."
denvernuggets,394qi9,bettycrockerpot,-2,Tue Jun 9 19:10:01 2015 UTC,"Are you saying that Lin couldn't put up Linsanity numbers again?  Even if he had the same coach, similar players, and the encouragement to do so.  Give me 3 reasons, why you think he couldn't do Linsanity again. And don't say he didn't do in Houston and LA because that was just because of the system.    ( P.S. Every great prophet was once an idiot, and every great idiot was once a profit.)"
denvernuggets,394qi9,bettycrockerpot,4,Wed Jun 10 03:01:45 2015 UTC,"interesting point, if Lin and d'antoni could replicate that linsanity success it would be really fun to watch. how great would it be if Denver could be this ridiculously fast team barreling down the court all the time and playing great defense that leads to turnovers"

denvernuggets,394qi9,hayclaylaybaymaysay,2,Tue Jun 9 07:10:29 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping the defense comes from the draft lol, best case scenario is good defense"
denvernuggets,394qi9,mtnDUE,5,Tue Jun 9 07:16:42 2015 UTC,"He could be good, but adding in ""MVP"" to your question gives an instant guffawed reaction. over Curry? LeBron? Harden?"
denvernuggets,394qi9,DimTuncan21,2,Tue Jun 9 13:51:12 2015 UTC,"James Harden.  Kevin Durant  Anthony Davis  LeBron James  Jeremy Lin  One of these things is not like the other.... if Jeremy Lin was the starting PG in Denver, could he score 25ppg? Maaaaaayybe. But the other team's PG would be scoring just as many. I don't ever want to see Jeremy Lin in a nuggets uniform. He is the Tim Tebow of basketball"
denvernuggets,394qi9,aatencio91,3,Tue Jun 9 14:06:41 2015 UTC,Tim Tebow of basketball is the perfect description.  They'll both have a huge fanbase because of what they are and not what they've done.
denvernuggets,394qi9,hayclaylaybaymaysay,3,Tue Jun 9 15:31:54 2015 UTC,"Except Lin is still in the league, and Tebow is not anymore. I really don't like that comparison, Lin is going to have a job in the NBA a long time, also he's undrafted, Tebow wasn't. The only similarity is that they both have a huge fan base, but that's about it."
denvernuggets,394qi9,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Jun 11 09:22:25 2015 UTC,"I think calling him the Tim Tebow of basketball is a little bit harsh if you're talking about his talent level. His nonsensical hype level is 1=1 equitable, yes, but Tebow seems like a worse player of his sport than Lin is. Lin didn't take a year out of the league, for example. And I say this as someone who wishes that Tebow would get a second chance with a team that would actually use him as more than a ticket seller."
denvernuggets,394qi9,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Tue Jun 9 18:09:15 2015 UTC,"You're right, the talent comparison was harsh. I guess what I had in mind was the ""talent-to-hype"" ratio, of which Tebow's was much lower than Lin's. Both had/have a huge amount of unwarranted hype though"
denvernuggets,394qi9,Lorenzomax,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:00:48 2015 UTC,"What you need to understand is that the opinions of players and teams can change dramatically from season to season.  Right now jeremy lin's name sounds out of place, however this could easily change if the situation changes.  IF the Nuggets make the 1st 2nd or 3rd seed with Lin putting up insanity type numbers, there's no reason why Lin couldn't be the MVP."
denvernuggets,394qi9,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Jun 9 14:41:46 2015 UTC,I just don't see any reason that one would assume Lin will get better than he already is.
denvernuggets,394qi9,Lorenzomax,-1,Tue Jun 9 17:22:13 2015 UTC,"Better than what he was during Linsanity, or better than what was during his runs with Houston and the Lakers? Do I really have to list out how much better Lin could be with D'Antoni?"
denvernuggets,394qi9,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Jun 9 18:31:35 2015 UTC,I'm not convinced that a single coach can really bring out that much talent from a player.
denvernuggets,394qi9,Lorenzomax,3,Tue Jun 9 19:42:47 2015 UTC,Ask Cuban Mark Cuban: Jeremy Lin can be another Steve Nash
denvernuggets,394qi9,Ediblegoldnuggets,2,Wed Jun 10 15:04:11 2015 UTC,He said that in 2012...I bet it wouldn't be hard to find someone credible who said something similar around that time.
denvernuggets,394qi9,OkAutopilot,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:29:01 2015 UTC,He did mention that Lin needs the right system(=coach) and right teammates. He didn't say Lin is a star in any team. I think his opinion is legit.
denvernuggets,394qi9,Ediblegoldnuggets,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:36:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not against picking him up here, especially if Ty is gone. I'm just not convinced he has the ability to be a transcendent player."
denvernuggets,394qi9,pairidaeza,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:37:15 2015 UTC,IMO he wouldn't bring your team to the PO singlehanded but he is better than many have recognized about.  He was ruined by the hype quite a bit. He just needs a second chance to be the primary ball-handler of a team.
denvernuggets,394qi9,Ediblegoldnuggets,2,Wed Jun 10 15:44:14 2015 UTC,"Possible yes, plausible no.  I will gladly eat my own words, but if Lin and D'antoni (or however you spell it) come to Denver as a package, I think nuggets will become Enver, no D.  Lin is known to not really care about his game as much as other players. Pretty sure he's happy to live off the money he's made so far, instead of working his tail off to improve. Probably the reason he's now a bench player for the 4th worst team, in a position of need. Can't remember which podcast I heard that on, but it makes sense.   huntforcoach"
denvernuggets,394qi9,pairidaeza,9,Tue Jun 9 07:49:48 2015 UTC,I have never in my life heard that Lin does not care about the game as much as other players.That sounds like it was just made up.
denvernuggets,394qi9,NUGGman,2,Tue Jun 9 08:02:12 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong. And I'll try and source my crazy outlandish statements, but he probably has some level of contempt a little high compared to the players Connelley wants."
denvernuggets,394qi9,wefr5927,4,Tue Jun 9 08:41:28 2015 UTC,"I'm all for Lin, particularly if he can get close to Linsanity numbers and particularly if it allows us to flip Ty for that 6th pick."
denvernuggets,394qi9,JMadFour,2,Tue Jun 9 08:53:37 2015 UTC,"So I can find that podcast, and I may have misheard. I think ( after looking at his numbers) they said he was contempt in his situation (as in LA and won't leave) and I misheard. I seriously hope I misheard, especially if he comes to Denver.  My apologies Ok,  But if I find that pod again I will let you know."
denvernuggets,394qi9,asiantemp,3,Tue Jun 9 09:07:58 2015 UTC,"huntforcoach really has a double meaning, heh.  That said, I'd be happy with D'Antoni or Hunt. Both has upsides and both have inherent problems."
denvernuggets,391lmg,aatencio91,9,Mon Jun 8 16:15:58 2015 UTC,"They're also relatively injury-free and that can't be understated. Had gallo and javale not gone down with that knee and leg injuries, the last few years could have been a lot different."
denvernuggets,391lmg,rvhack,8,Mon Jun 8 18:53:01 2015 UTC,"Everything you said looks pretty true. I'd only add:   Steph is underpaid (boy did that work out), Draymond are underpaid and about to get paid, David Lee is overpaid, and is Iggy really worth 13.53M? There are good and bad contracts on any team, I'm not sure they're much of an outlier.  They lucked out with being able bring Iggy off the bench in lieu of Harrison Barnes, but I'm don't think Iggy would be a star anywhere else. Definitely a starter, but he only averaged 14.1 ppg since 10-11 and it's been downhill from there. He's more a a lock down defender now, and that's about it.  They definitely have a look and identity, too. I don't know what your buddy was getting at there."
denvernuggets,391lmg,with2nns,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:04:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think we saw here that Iggy doesn't really work as a 'star' on a team that wants to go deep in the playoffs."
denvernuggets,391lmg,sleepydogg,2,Tue Jun 9 08:10:01 2015 UTC,"Iguodala was our shut down defender. He made every team's best player shoot worse.   There are all types of ""stars"" some of them play defense. Iguodala is one of them.  Edit: I also wouldn't call the best season ever not working. It worked for every game in Pepsi Center that year besides 4. That's a feat I don't think I'll ever see again. (I saw nearly every home game that year)"
denvernuggets,391lmg,NUGGman,2,Tue Jun 9 21:00:47 2015 UTC,"a team that wants to go deep in the playoffs.   Our best regular season ever.  Yes, we were a great team that year, and really fun to watch, but in the end it was another one-and-done.  And our coach got fired after that year (which was a mistake, but still).  I'd say it absolutely didn't work.  FWIW, I would argue that the '09 season was our best season ever, being just a couple of wins away from the Finals."
denvernuggets,391lmg,sleepydogg,5,Wed Jun 10 02:01:04 2015 UTC,I'd rather fold as a team than try and be like our most hated enemy.

denvernuggets,391lmg,tron777,2,Tue Jun 9 13:43:41 2015 UTC,"This is exactly why teams won't want to trade their draft pick for Ty Lawson. Draft picks are underpaid, Ty Lawson is not."
denvernuggets,391lmg,NUGGman,3,Tue Jun 9 21:03:40 2015 UTC,"Lawson is the bird in the hand to the draft pick birds in the bush. Some franchises, like Sacramento, have been in the bushes so long that they would rather just have the one damn bird."
denvernuggets,391lmg,tron777,2,Tue Jun 9 21:49:24 2015 UTC,the contracts are truer  i don't buy style of play generalizations. that's a cop out imo
denvernuggets,391lmg,ParadeShitter,3,Tue Jun 9 00:51:49 2015 UTC,"I think it's a combination of the two. Yes they have some players playing under their market value, but it's just as much because of good drafting on their part. It's important to remember that Iguodala and David Lee were both brought in to be starters, but were turned into high quality bench players because Harrison Barnes and Draymond Green have developed tremendously since being drafted and have really blossomed this year.   I'd love to see us look like GSW, but first we're going to have to nail at least 3 drafts in the coming years to achieve that IMO."
denvernuggets,391lmg,d-lo_tha_boss,2,Mon Jun 8 16:49:47 2015 UTC,LOL @ David Lee being a high quality bench player.

denvernuggets,391mrp,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Mon Jun 8 16:23:51 2015 UTC,"My favorite all-time Nugget. I met him in 1995 as a 17 year-old and couldn't believe a guy of his caliber was the genuine article in person too.   Had he stayed healthy, who knows what would have happened. Explosive offensive game, a tenacious defender and played with a passion that few ever do."
denvernuggets,391mrp,drmeattornado,2,Tue Jun 9 00:38:52 2015 UTC,Definitely one of my all-time favourites too. Dude was a beast.
denvernuggets,38z9ra,eathbau,25,Mon Jun 8 02:30:51 2015 UTC,"Mozgov has improved tremendously since 2012, and i don't think it would of made a difference.  To say he was the same player in 2012 is just silly.  Hell, last year he was committing stupid fouls on a regular basis."
denvernuggets,38z9ra,denverNUGGs,9,Mon Jun 8 03:32:24 2015 UTC,"Very true. The improvement he has made this year, even, has been tremendous, simply by being in the right situation. It really isn't fair to compare Nuggets Mozgov with Cavs Mozgov, one situation asks him to run constantly and occasionally create his own shot, the other has the best player in the world to cut off of, play defense behind, and rebound for. The trade could really end up being a win-win."
denvernuggets,38z9ra,imhandy,2,Mon Jun 8 03:37:33 2015 UTC,"Very true points.  One key thing not touched here though is Mozgov's hands... he had hands of stone catching Ty's passes in the lane here, often fumbling them for a turnover.  Somewhere on the flight to Cleveland he must've prayed to the hand god - he's been catching Lebron's / Kyrie's passes in traffic - the same exact pass as Ty's he would often fumble."
denvernuggets,38z9ra,f0xpuppy,11,Mon Jun 8 07:37:01 2015 UTC,This one time I'm rooting for the Cavs. Only because of Mozzy

denvernuggets,38z9ra,KevinTheWhale,2,Mon Jun 8 14:13:29 2015 UTC,"In with you on that.  I really love this series so far, and I am happy for Mozzy. He's not riding coattails at all and is effective and contributing."
denvernuggets,38z9ra,armatron444,13,Tue Jun 9 00:48:37 2015 UTC,"lebron james has done more for his game than 20-whatever years of playing basketball have ever done. he was never utilized well here or probably anywhere in his nba career until he landed in the perfect spot in cleveland.   he's human, his motivation is linked to his involvement. lebron (and other cavs) can get him the ball in good spots for him (he's got good hands) to get easy looks on offense and this involvement pays dividends on defense. him and tristan have been a wrecking crew all playoffs."
denvernuggets,38z9ra,ParadeShitter,3,Mon Jun 8 03:41:56 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Mozgov admittedly loved playing here and when asked months before the trade if he would like to play with Lebron, he said:   “I would like to play with LeBron. But even though playing for a contender is cool, you got to understand that I want to be part of the team and not to just join a contender and ride the coattails, being a burden...My last season in Denver was good, and to try and do something to leave the team wouldn’t be smart.”"

denvernuggets,38z9ra,trentyz,5,Tue Jun 9 04:26:09 2015 UTC,"I always felt he was underrated here. There were many who couldn't wait to ship him away for a second round pick. We see now what he means to the Cavs. I don't know if we would have won that Warriors series, but I think we would have stood a better chance with Moz. Bogut and Landry really beat us up that series. The way Koufos faltered then soured me on him.  The thought was Kosta was more fundamentally sound. However, Moz was also coming back from injury as I recall, so he looked awful in limited minutes. He didn't get a chance to really play through and get his confidence back. I don't think it's a matter of his improvement in the time since then, not when he had big games for us before that against the likes of Bynum. Did he deserve that chance at that stage of his career, I don't know. We couldn't afford to wait for him. But if we had I think we would have seen the same Moz all the same, just sooner.  As to his occasional foul trouble and stone hands, I never thought it was such a big deal. His more well rounded offensive skills compared to JaVale and Kosta and the way he consumes space inside (in the good way) made him too valuable not to play anyway. It was a waste just having him wither away at the end of the bench."
denvernuggets,38z9ra,utw,3,Mon Jun 8 04:04:50 2015 UTC,"I think David Blatt is also a huge factor in Mozgov's recent jump in ability, he finally has a coach that he can actually communicate with"
denvernuggets,38z9ra,Squidberg8369,2,Mon Jun 8 20:14:59 2015 UTC,"I wonder if having a coach who speaks Russian helps out Mozgov more. I know he speaks decent English, but he has improved somewhat under Blatt. Plus, they already had a good working repertoire.  Either way, I've always seen his potential and knew he could be a part of a high caliber team."
denvernuggets,38z9ra,Crambulance,2,Mon Jun 8 05:15:42 2015 UTC,KK was a better player back then.  Moz has improved a lot.
denvernuggets,38z9ra,zoeyversustheraccoon,3,Mon Jun 8 12:20:30 2015 UTC,And JaVale was playing what might be the best basketball he'll ever play.
denvernuggets,38z9ra,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Mon Jun 8 14:16:25 2015 UTC,"I agreed then and I especially agree now. Not a knock on Koufos, I just think Timo needed consistent rotation minutes to get into a groove; not spotty minutes.  That said, Andre Miller and Faried were the reasons we lost that series. Putrid defense (Miller) and lack of consistent intensity (Miller and faried) cost us way too many points. Nothing Mozzy could have done back then would have changed that."
denvernuggets,38z9ra,hayclaylaybaymaysay,2,Mon Jun 8 15:44:44 2015 UTC,Not including those horrid free throws that Faried and JaVale were taking...ugh.
denvernuggets,38z9ra,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Mon Jun 8 15:57:09 2015 UTC,"Oh man I forgot about those. Between those 2 and Iggy, free throws were definitely not Denver's strong suit (despite shooting the most, I think). Andre Miller was in the 60s percentage-wise too IIRC"
denvernuggets,38z9ra,hayclaylaybaymaysay,3,Mon Jun 8 16:01:01 2015 UTC,"To your point on Dre- I think that first game is what really screwed us with him. He put in the winning bucket, and his ego went unchecked for the next 6 games."
denvernuggets,38z9ra,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Mon Jun 8 16:02:46 2015 UTC,Even at the time this was obvious. Still pissed we traded him for nothing.

denvernuggets,38z9ra,IdRatherBeLurking,0,Mon Jun 8 02:35:21 2015 UTC,"That's interesting a concept. You might be right, just another example how George Karl was out coached by Mark Jackson in that Series."
denvernuggets,38z9ra,eg14000,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:13:43 2015 UTC,I wouldn't use that as an example- I think he was really out-coached when it came to set plays from the sideline. Karl's biggest mistake at center was not starting JaVale earlier.

Hopefully with a better coach and improvement from the former rooks we could see a return of the fun up and down nuggets teams of the last decade. Anyways we really need to move Hickson. If jokic comes over that's too many bigs if Lauvergne or Jokic are going to get any minutes

denvernuggets,38ylw3,Rockinrobert29,0,Mon Jun 8 15:44:21 2015 UTC,How can you say he did well with kings what have the Kings done recently
denvernuggets,38ylw3,aatencio91,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:17:23 2015 UTC,My understanding is that they didn't do well because of differences between him and the front office/ownership. It kinda sounds like a Tom Thibodeau situation. I don't think that he's as bad as his record indicates.
denvernuggets,38ylw3,MountCRushmore,-2,Mon Jun 8 15:35:08 2015 UTC,"Please god, no"
denvernuggets,38ylw3,with2nns,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:10:15 2015 UTC,Why? He did well in Sacramento.
denvernuggets,38z19a,eg14000,2,Mon Jun 8 01:20:29 2015 UTC,That's probably just combine numbers right. The video didn't specify so I might have overreacted.
denvernuggets,38z19a,with2nns,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:31:20 2015 UTC,That can't be right. He took 356 shots last season. If it's combine numbers I wouldn't worry about it.
denvernuggets,38z19a,with2nns,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:18:39 2015 UTC,"Then again if it was a combine thing, 2 of 19?  that's really bad. I (and probably you) could shoot better than that open in warm-ups.  Maybe he just had a bad day."
denvernuggets,38z19a,zenbu,2,Mon Jun 8 06:07:57 2015 UTC,"I'd give him the benefit of the doubt. One week isn't enough to figure out a player, let  alone 1 workout."
denvernuggets,38z19a,skipaBturner,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:14:43 2015 UTC,"If its that draft express video that came out before the combine. I'm pretty sure it was for the season, but I don't think its that big of a deal. He didn't need to take shots off the bounce when he could drive and get to the basket semi consistently. He was able to make spot up jumpers when he needed to but his jumper is definitely a work in progress. He supposedly has a very high work ethic and I think he will take more shots off the bounce once he feels more comfortable with his shot and handle. Think of him as an MKG with the foundations already in place for a jump shot."
denvernuggets,38z19a,ParadeShitter,0,Mon Jun 8 02:24:22 2015 UTC,Are you crazy. Name one superstar that can't create their own shot off the bounce. The Nuggets need players with superstar potential and if this is true Winslow doesn't have it. spot up shooters are a dime a dozen. the Nuggets can't afford to take a guy that's that limited offensively.

denvernuggets,38wm0m,callthetechmonkey,13,Sun Jun 7 13:24:42 2015 UTC,"I believe myself to be one of the few reasonable Laker fans with a fair evaluation of D'Antoni and this is what I have to say about the man.  He is a man who wants his players to succeed. His own success or his team's success is simply the product of his player's individual improvement. D'Antoni does extremely well with young players who have something to prove. There are so many examples of end of the bench type guys finding their renaissance moment under him. Felton, Lin, Clark, Marshall, Meeks, Blake, Henry etc all had their best seasons under D'Antoni.  He doesn't do so well with huge superstar egos who have no desire to play team ball within his system.  He is also a man who has pidgeon-holed himself (with the media's help) into a particular system. When he doesn't have the right pieces to make that system run (literally) he is less than stellar. With the Lakers you had an aging Kobe who didn't really want to run and gun yet still had one of his best seasons under D'Antoni. You had Howard (still recovering from injury) who had delusions of being the next Olajuwon and refused to run PnR with the greatest PnR PG in Steve Nash (when healthy). His last season with the Lakers was plagued with injuries and wasn't really his fault. That team still had surprising victories, including a win where he had a total of 6 players on the active roster. Mike couldn't do much to persuade Howard's huge superstar ego, partly because of directives by the Lakers Front Office to keep things comfortable for Dwight in Free Agency. This was also D'Antoni's problem with the Knicks. The New York front office was pressuring him to appease the demands of his superstar Carmelo and formulate a system around him. That obviously didn't work out, but we saw what happened when D'Antoni finally got to run his style of play with Lin at the point and a surrounding cast that bought into the system. Linsanity.   When the front office gives D'Antoni free reign over the roster, the system, and team culture what you get is the 05-07 Suns.   Nash wasn't an MVP until he played under D'Antoni. I think D'Antoni's style of coaching could prove to be steroids for Lawson as it has proven to be for lesser point guards. The run and gun system would make Denver such a feared place for teams to come and play.   Will Mike turn around the franchise and immediately contend for a championship? Probably not, but it doesn't take away from the fact that he would do well with the Nuggets current roster and the city of Denver is the perfect place to run his system."
denvernuggets,38wm0m,TheRealMindGamez,3,Sun Jun 7 22:00:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this!  Honestly, I probably should have posted an amended version of this question in /r/nba or something, hindsight and all that.  So I guess, who, in your measured opinion, would be a player coming out of the college ranks this year that the nuggets could take at 7 and succeed with if they decide to go with Mike D?"
denvernuggets,38wm0m,TheRealMindGamez,6,Sun Jun 7 22:04:46 2015 UTC,"Assuming JLin comes to Denver and Lawson stays then realistically, Mario Herzonja at #7 seems most likely.  From what I've seen he's a great competitive hard working guy willing to fulfill his role within a system. Mike understands the Euro game and would work well with him. Under D'Antoni, Mario could really thrive in Denver.  Winslow/Johnson would also be great as the 3 and D type of guys Mike likes to have at the 3/4 position."
denvernuggets,38wm0m,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Sun Jun 7 22:29:47 2015 UTC,Great stuff. Thanks for dropping by the sub and sharing your insight!
denvernuggets,38wm0m,kidhumbeats,13,Sun Jun 7 22:17:31 2015 UTC,"Would you like a glimmer of hope?  Mike coached the Nuggets for one year, and it was the rookie year of his coaching career. Since then he has had a crash course as a coach with both the Suns, and the Knicks.   The Mike D. who comes back to the Nuggets is not going to be the same Mike D. who was here before. This could be a chance for him to finally prove that he is a great coach, and realize his potential.  I wanted Scott Brooks or Thibs so badly but nope. Time to get real I guess.  Ty Lawson has to go though. Or nothing is going to matter."
denvernuggets,38wm0m,kidhumbeats,3,Sun Jun 7 14:23:20 2015 UTC,"You make good points, though didn't he coach the lakers too? Failed miserably there... with GD all-stars (granted sorta elderly ones) in Kobe, and Pau, Steve Nash too I believe...  I just want folks to recognize he is a good regular season coach but his teams are NEVER built for playoff runs of any significance..."
denvernuggets,38wm0m,vdowd,4,Sun Jun 7 16:50:33 2015 UTC,Yeah he coached the Lakers but none of the post-Jackson coaches could really stop Kobe from trying to son them and make it his team.
denvernuggets,38wm0m,Ediblegoldnuggets,2,Sun Jun 7 16:54:40 2015 UTC,"Its really tough to rein Kobe in, hopefully he'll be done soon, and the lakers can move forward..."
denvernuggets,38wm0m,cannedyp,2,Sun Jun 7 17:40:27 2015 UTC,Total agreement
denvernuggets,38wm0m,corybyu,2,Sun Jun 7 19:18:13 2015 UTC,"To be honest. I wouldn't mind the hire of MD, but preferably  not as a head coach. He's probably not interested in being an assistant, but given Melvin Hunts long standing tenure as head assistant/ interim, he should get first gig.  Denver should run, and the main reason MD's teams didn't win came down to things such as injuries, suspensions etc. if I remember rightly.  In terms of long term success, I think the coach can only do so much. We need to land a big fish, through the draft most likely. If NY suck this next year, we may get that with the pick swap. That's what I'm hoping for."
denvernuggets,38wm0m,silverandblack,2,Mon Jun 8 14:25:42 2015 UTC,For sure. He's (d'antoni) had every opportunity since he left the suns to be a semi decent coach. His system doesn't work without a top 2 point guard which Ty Lawson is not. I like the idea of mike Woodson for some reason. I think he gets a lot out of his players
denvernuggets,38wm0m,silverandblack,-3,Sun Jun 7 14:06:37 2015 UTC,"I like Woodson more than D'antoni, but I feel like an opportunity is lost if we don't at least give Mark Jackson a try, sure he can be somewhat poisonous, but I think of him as a transitional coach to bring a more half court offense, and a defensive mindset the nuggets desperately need if they want to get out of the first round of the playoffs..."

denvernuggets,38vn12,pairidaeza,2,Sun Jun 7 06:30:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was almost like he wasn't even jumping.  This really makes me hope we get one of the other guys we are interested in, it is hard to change the mechanics of your shot that much."

denvernuggets,38vn12,bettycrockerpot,3,Sun Jun 7 05:29:23 2015 UTC,yeh his shot looked bad. Seems to be a smart intelligent kid (from what i gathered in the interview). I think he could bust tho. Still think we go after winslow..

denvernuggets,38vn12,krs_,3,Mon Jun 8 01:13:02 2015 UTC,"The shot, while it is low, can be fixed. In this game film you can see at about the 1:40 mark, his elevation does increase. The release is still low, but that is easy to fox with NBA coaching.   The thing he has over Winslow and Mario is his size: 6'7 and 245 lbs. That - correct me if I'm wrong - is just an inch below Faried and almost the same weight. He will also be able to get bigger with NBA workouts and nutrition.   I would rather have Winslow since he will become a star sooner than Johnson, but either is a great option."
denvernuggets,38vn12,MountCRushmore,2,Sun Jun 7 20:27:23 2015 UTC,That shot looks wack... No lift at all. Well spoken kid tho

denvernuggets,38uui6,Tskitishvili,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:37:22 2015 UTC,"Probably not, but he's going to be able to beat his man and get to the rim whenever he wants. He's not nearly the athlete, but is on his way to being at least an average 3pt shooter, which wasn't really part of the game when Thompson played."
denvernuggets,38uui6,OkAutopilot,2,Sun Jun 7 06:28:27 2015 UTC,Seems like Winslow and Mario have higher floors and ceilings than Johnson. I could be wrong though.
denvernuggets,38uui6,with2nns,3,Sun Jun 7 07:26:12 2015 UTC,Do you think his name is Justice so people don't mistake him for a walking humanoid block of frozen water?
denvernuggets,38uui6,weiner_cleaner,3,Sun Jun 7 05:14:50 2015 UTC,Winslow. Based off the eye test Winslow is just so much more smooth. His game looks much more fluent which is always a good sign
denvernuggets,38uui6,weiner_cleaner,4,Sun Jun 7 04:52:21 2015 UTC,"Let me add something, you make a fair point, but I disagree I don't think justice Winslow is more smooth than Stanley Johnson.  Justice Winslow has more space to operate because Okafor demands a double team on every possession. Meaning every time or most times Winslow gets the ball a players rotating to him instead of already on him making him more able to attack the basket which gives him the illusion, in my opinion, of being more smooth. But in reality I think both  players are very even in terms of ""smooth"""
denvernuggets,38uui6,weiner_cleaner,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:43:10 2015 UTC,"I do really like Johnson however. Johnson's strength is impressive to see and I could see him as being able to power some other Sfs. I don't think that Johnson has a good enough shot though. If you watch videos of him shooting, his release is way too low. Winslow's shot is much better form wise and percentage wise. Winslow seems to have a higher basketball IQ than Johnson. I will say that Winslow's stock has raised immensely because of the tournament but I even still, I think he has more potential than Johnson"
denvernuggets,38uui6,aatencio91,2,Sun Jun 7 22:26:48 2015 UTC,"Something else I think we should be aware of is the mentality shift of the two players. If you watch the interviews of Johnson you can tell he has a belief that he will become a superstar. I don't see that same belief in Justice. For example, think of Deron Williams and Chris Paul. Deron Williams didn't want to be a superstar (at least in the opinion of Paul Pierce) while Chris Paul, taken in the same draft, did want to become a superstar and achieved more overall value."
denvernuggets,38uui6,d-lo_tha_boss,2,Sun Jun 7 22:50:37 2015 UTC,Okay sure a good attitude does help especially with our nuggets team right now that seems to be plagued with bad attitudes.

denvernuggets,38tmls,aatencio91,0,Sat Jun 6 19:29:39 2015 UTC,"That's my thoughts. This is a very poor analogy, but he is more Von Miller and less Peyton."
denvernuggets,38tmls,BlindManBaldwin,0,Sat Jun 6 19:38:20 2015 UTC,"Eh even Von is more of a leader. He's matured so much since his weed suspension and I think he's a mentor to Shane Ray. Being around DeMarcus Ware has changed Von. I'd say he's more like a Rahim Moore. He'll do his job, and he'll do it pretty well, but he's not going to inspire others and help lead them when they're behind.  The way it appears (and I'm about as new to the Nuggets as you are in a ""hardcore fan"" sense) is that the Nuggets don't have anything anywhere close to a Peyton Manning type of leader when it comes to actual game stuff. I think Tim Connelley is a decent GM, but after him there's no leadership. Brian Shaw couldn't inspire confidence, Melvin Hunt got the guys fighting a little bit more, but I think they need a proven HC to start setting dudes straight and getting the most out of these players. Team USA showed us that Kenneth Faried can be an absolute monster, and there's no one currently involved in this team that can get that out of him. Mike D'Antoni or someone like him could get closer to that than Melvin Hunt, I think.  On the player side, there's not a leader, period. That's part of why I like Stanley Johnson and Justise Winslow so much. They've both got the intangibles to be leaders."

I agree with the Rahim Moore comparison, that's a much better example. I still think of Von as that wide-eyed new player and not the seasoned vet he is (can you believe he is going into his 5th season already?)."
denvernuggets,38tmls,BlindManBaldwin,2,Sat Jun 6 19:48:17 2015 UTC,I really hope that Von grows into the kind of leader that DeMarcus Ware is and wears the C on his chest when Ware leaves.
denvernuggets,38tmls,aatencio91,3,Sat Jun 6 19:49:59 2015 UTC,"trade ty to charlotte for lance stephenson and their pick. put stephenson at point guard, draft stanley johnson at 7, and willie cauley-stein at 9, championship"

denvernuggets,38tmls,pairidaeza,0,Sun Jun 7 09:00:25 2015 UTC,That ....actually sounds not too bad. But would Charlotte give up that much when they already have Kemba? Plus Idk if WCS will make it to 9
denvernuggets,38tmls,MileHighPride30,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:26:17 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on who our coach is going to be. If Pringles gets hired, I think he could do a lot with Lawson and Faried (PnR all day) and fit the roster back to how Karl made it. I'd probably say not them there.   If it's someone else, I'd totally advocate a trade of of one or both of them. I don't think Ty is enough to get the 4th, we'd most likely have to package both Faried and Ty for that. Even then the Knicks might now bite.   We could probably get the 6th from the Kings for Ty. I know Karl would love to have them. Kings might go for that if WCS is off the board by their pick. Hopefully we can pick up 2 of Winslow/ Super Mario/ Stanley Johnson (in that order imo) in that case.   If those three are off the board by 7, I say we try and trade Faried (20 and Ross from TOR would be great imo), grab WCS, and go into the year with Ty/Chandler/Gallo/WCS/Nurk with Ross, Barton, Jokic off the bench."
denvernuggets,38tmls,MileHighPride30,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:05:32 2015 UTC,"I think sending Chandler and the Grizzlies pick to the Heat for Chalmers and No. 10 would be something to consider. The Heat could use insurance in case Deng opts out or they can't reach a deal with Wade, and the Nuggets could use insurance if Nelson opts out and they can hope Stanley Johnson slides to 10. I'd be thrilled if the Nuggets got two of WCS/Winslow/Hezonja/Johnson"
denvernuggets,38pblp,alluciano,4,Fri Jun 5 18:37:41 2015 UTC,Why don't we go for Spurs assistants? They are the best candidates from assistant coaches.
denvernuggets,38pblp,WhereIsCharlesLee,7,Sat Jun 6 00:22:00 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind Becky Hammon as the coach
denvernuggets,38pblp,bettycrockerpot,3,Sat Jun 6 01:36:56 2015 UTC,Honestly at this point we should give it consideration lol.

denvernuggets,38pblp,PUSHINGWOOD,3,Sat Jun 6 07:35:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah the guy has 16 years of experience as an assistant coach in the NBA, many of those under Popavich. It's not like he's some nobody who's never seen a basketball before."
denvernuggets,38pblp,aatencio91,3,Sat Jun 6 14:39:48 2015 UTC,"I agree, if you are going to interview assistants, interview from top teams or the best organizations."
denvernuggets,38pblp,Nugforlife,3,Sat Jun 6 01:22:06 2015 UTC,Ya I mean look at the Hawks and the Grizzlies. They are extremely successful with the former Spurs assistants they have.

denvernuggets,38p63u,tron777,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:29:02 2015 UTC,Why do you think Connelly is going to surprise us? You think he'll pick someone not listed or do you think he'll trade up/down?
denvernuggets,38p63u,tron777,2,Fri Jun 5 20:01:06 2015 UTC,Seems like the organization is primed to move in some direction. Just picking one of those three and going into free agency with a middling amount of cap space doesn't really get us anywhere.  Not sure what they'll do but I expect something to happen.

denvernuggets,38p63u,tron777,2,Sat Jun 6 01:13:35 2015 UTC,I have not. Just think the roster and situation beg a move of some kind.
denvernuggets,38p63u,The_NGUYENNER,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:38:58 2015 UTC,yeah I feel the same way... very pivotal draft. Could decide our next ~5 years
denvernuggets,38p63u,hayclaylaybaymaysay,3,Sat Jun 6 02:47:46 2015 UTC,I want Stanley Johnson because of his maturity and athleticism.  I personally don't think we're going to be drafting either of them because I think we are going to trade into the top 4.
denvernuggets,38p63u,hayclaylaybaymaysay,3,Fri Jun 5 19:04:51 2015 UTC,Who do you think we'll trade away and who do you think we'll trade with?
denvernuggets,38p63u,hayclaylaybaymaysay,2,Fri Jun 5 19:07:26 2015 UTC,"My guess is a package centered around Ty Lawson to either Philly or NY. Maybe Lawson, Foye, and #57. IDK, but a package centered around Ty lawson would be my guess."
denvernuggets,38p63u,kthxtyler,7,Fri Jun 5 19:22:44 2015 UTC,"A trade to New York doesn't make sense for the Nuggets. They have a pick swap with them in 2016's draft, meaning the Nuggets want the Knicks to be lousy. The Nuggets could be a .500 team with a top-5 pick.   I don't know if Philly would want to give away a pick that'll likely be D'Angelo Russell in exchange for Ty Lawson. Russell seems like he'd be a better option at the position.  I think the best option for trading Lawson for a pick is to send him to Sacramento. That only gets the Nuggets the 6th overall, but they'd retain the 7th pick that way and with the 6th and 7th they could get a 3 (Hezonja/Johnson/Winslow) and a stud 4 or 5 in Willie Cauley-Stein."
denvernuggets,38p63u,hayclaylaybaymaysay,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:31:18 2015 UTC,"Wow, I love that idea, and George Karl would probably love to reunite with Ty. The only problem is that the Kings already have Darren Collison....  But could you imagine a starting lineup of Nelson/Stanley Johnson/Gallo/Faried/Nurk in 2 or 3 years, especially with Chandler, Cauly-Stein, and Gary Harris off the bench? Hell yeah.  Edit: AND lauvergne and Jokic too? Shit, that is Warriors-like depth with proper player development."

denvernuggets,38p63u,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Fri Jun 5 20:53:07 2015 UTC,Nelson is opting out so he's as good as gone.
denvernuggets,38p63u,hayclaylaybaymaysay,2,Sat Jun 6 02:21:23 2015 UTC,"It seems like Ty would be great coming off the bench. With the Kings, he'd never be asked to be the leader or the #1 scorer like he is here, so it'd be a good fit for him as long as he could accept some diminished minutes (playing for a decent team under his old buddy Karl would help).  Here's my prediction if they Hire Mike D'Antoni, trade Ty, and draft Johnson and WCS:  PG: Jeremy Lin, Gary Harris?, Erick Green  SG: Randy Foye, Will Barton, Jamaal Franklin, Will Barton  SF: Danilo Gallinari, Stanley Johnson, Wilson Chandler  PF: Kenneth Faried, Joffrey Lauvergne, Darrell Arthur, JJ Hickson  C: Jusuf Nurkic, Willie Cauley-Stein   They'd still need a 1 and a 2 sooner or later, I think."
denvernuggets,38p63u,eg14000,2,Fri Jun 5 19:58:25 2015 UTC,"The most likely thing that's going to happen, is only one of them is going to be good. Think the three point guards in the 2009 draft. Johnny Flynn, Ricky Rubio, and Steph Curry. Before that draft everyone thought it was an even in terms of which point guard you going to draft. turns out only Steph Curry what's good.  If you want my opinion, I think Stanley Johnson will be the best, but no one really knows."
denvernuggets,38p63u,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Fri Jun 5 19:53:19 2015 UTC,"Of course no one really knows, and yeah, it's likely that only one or none of them will be great, but at this point it's fun to speculate and debate why we think who will be good."

denvernuggets,38me5i,orangeslash,3,Fri Jun 5 14:52:24 2015 UTC,He plays the same whether he's on or off.
denvernuggets,38me5i,LanDloyd,2,Fri Jun 5 15:02:05 2015 UTC,Well his role is to shoot when he's in the game.  Plus as the guy said he can get hot quick.  Not like anyone else on the team beside LBJ and Kyrie can create their own shot or for anyone else.
denvernuggets,38me5i,ParadeShitter,3,Fri Jun 5 15:10:09 2015 UTC,"exactly. plus lebron got into that weak postup-look to pass mode with 1 side of the floor heavy loaded. kyrie's hurt, thompson and mozgod are in the game at the same time. if lebron passes you the ball and you're JR in that situation it's your job to shoot. you can't worry about what some guy on the internet is going to think, you shoot. you're the second best option on the floor. if coach doesn't want you to shoot than coach doesn't have you in the game. simple as that"
denvernuggets,38me5i,NUGGman,0,Fri Jun 5 15:13:04 2015 UTC,"You mean, Iguodala started shutting Lebron down?"
denvernuggets,38me5i,ParadeShitter,3,Fri Jun 5 15:16:55 2015 UTC,"lets not get crazy, lebron got into a bit too much magic and not enough michael mode when kyrie went down. iggy is a great player and a capable defender of lebron james but he was guarding lebron most of the game and lebron scored 44 points and had his way with iggy in the post"
denvernuggets,38me5i,NUGGman,0,Fri Jun 5 15:21:32 2015 UTC,"Those were some terrible calls on Iguodala. Also, Barnes was covering Lebron when he got most of his points, not AI"

denvernuggets,38l6xs,teensonacid,10,Thu Jun 4 22:49:53 2015 UTC,Just because he has opted out doesn't necessarily mean he is leaving Denver.
denvernuggets,38l6xs,denverNUGGs,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:03:15 2015 UTC,I hope he doesn't
denvernuggets,38l6xs,NUGGman,5,Fri Jun 5 15:18:56 2015 UTC,"I can't say I blame him.  He was great for us and a spark off the bench.  Kinda like Timo in the Finals right now, Jameer could help a winning team more than help us try to avoid yet another six game losing streak.  Best of luck, Jameer."
denvernuggets,38l6xs,chucho320,4,Fri Jun 5 04:52:27 2015 UTC,"We fired Hunt. This is just conjecture, but what if the Nuggets told Jameer Nelson that their hiring Mike D'Antoni. He already said that if Hunt came back he would seriously consider resigning. The fact that he opted out means, either he thinks he can make more money, or that the team told him that Hunt was fired."
denvernuggets,38l6xs,eg14000,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:57:28 2015 UTC,Maybe he just knows that the Nuggets can't afford to let him go. Especially if they plan on trading Lawson
denvernuggets,38l6xs,NUGGman,2,Fri Jun 5 15:20:03 2015 UTC,"This puts us at 58 million of committed salary for 2015-16 and gives us 9 million in cap space for free agency.  I would have taken Jameer for a year at 3 million but I don't want to see him on a longer deal.  Don't think he has many miles left in that body and he really couldn't get by anybody last year.   An aside: I saw Darrell Arthur at brunch last weekend but I see now that he's not on the books for next year. Does his presence mean he's likely to sign a deal here or does he just not know where to move yet? That after-season-but-before-you-have-a-contract must be a weird time for NBA players, especially the journeymen types."
denvernuggets,38l6xs,tron777,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:56:20 2015 UTC,$9 mil? Couldn't the cap go up?
denvernuggets,38l6xs,NUGGman,3,Fri Jun 5 15:20:49 2015 UTC,"Next year it's going to $89 Million but this year it is set at $67.1 million. They tried smoothing the transition, which would have meant bigger cap this year, but I think the player's union shut that down.  We can still be active with $9 million but it's more likely to be a sign and trade situation as opposed to a straight signing."
denvernuggets,38l6xs,tron777,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:05:20 2015 UTC,thanks for elaborating
denvernuggets,38l6xs,NUGGman,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:40:58 2015 UTC,"and getting creative with the contracts although i'd prefer the team didn't start handing out massive future deals with such an uncertain present roster (unless it's a big FA, unlikely).   i agree tho, $9 isn't a ton. FA class is so/so. a lot of question marks about current players on this roster. i don't think we'll see any big ""straight signing"" acquisitions.   i'd like nelson at $3m a year. last off season he wanted to command a playoff team and now he's probably content coming off the bench for one. i don't think denver is his first choice but he did play well last year. certainly a better shooter than lawson but i'd like a bit more diversity from my starting and backup point guards"
denvernuggets,38l6xs,ParadeShitter,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:47:07 2015 UTC,"i'd prefer the team didn't start handing out massive future deals with such an uncertain present roster (unless it's a big FA, unlikely).   The cap is going $89 million in 2016 and $108 million in 2017.  Stuff that looks massive now is going to look pedestrian in two years. Look at Faried's contract, it will be 17% of the cap this year but in 2017 , even with yearly bumps, it's only 12% of the cap. I've seen people saying we overpaid but the contract is going to look great in 2017 if Faried plays at his career averages. So, as long as you're getting some production, it's not likely that the contract signings this summer are likely to be big mistakes.  The cap rising that much in two years is going to mean that really no one is in salary cap hell for a few years. It's going to be a really weird time for NBA contracts.   With Nelson I worry that by year two of the contract he can't move well enough to help the team.  He might be a better shooter than Ty but shoots a worse percentage because he can't get away from anyone anymore (and takes some pretty ugly contested pull ups at times). In the money range we have available you have to pick between guys who can penetrate a defense or guys who can shoot.  If they can do both they'll be out of our price range."
denvernuggets,38l6xs,tron777,2,Fri Jun 5 18:17:52 2015 UTC,"well the nuggets were already going to have a ton of room after next season hence why i said they shouldn't just hand out monster deals without a clear direction  you can't make a mistake when you only have $9m to hand out (please don't prove me wrong front office)  i dunno if i agree about jameer. he was a better shooter when him and ty were both wearing nuggets jersey's last year. ty takes a lot of those anti-morey-ball step back 2s and jameer takes similar 3s. ty can certainly get to the rim better but his efficiency is lacking because he's not a great shot selector for himself. i'm personally in the ""lets shoot as many 3s as we can"" camp and i welcome any addition to the team that can shoot the long ball."

denvernuggets,38q0dm,bettycrockerpot,-2,Fri Jun 5 22:53:39 2015 UTC,Or maybe we can just change the sub from /r/nuggets to /r/stillbitteraboutthebestseasonever
denvernuggets,38q0dm,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Fri Jun 5 22:56:48 2015 UTC,Ain't no shame in my game man. I'm still bitter AF.
denvernuggets,38q0dm,IdRatherBeLurking,6,Fri Jun 5 22:59:40 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry man, but I don't think this belongs here."
denvernuggets,38q0dm,IdRatherBeLurking,-4,Fri Jun 5 21:26:29 2015 UTC,Your opinion is valid. But we have plenty of posts talking about ex-Nuggets players and the Finals. I respectfully disagree.
denvernuggets,38q0dm,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Fri Jun 5 21:28:05 2015 UTC,"The only other post I can find is the one about JR, but that post is specifically framing it from a Nuggets perspective."
denvernuggets,38q0dm,IdRatherBeLurking,-3,Fri Jun 5 21:29:51 2015 UTC,"I was hoping it would generate a discussion similar to the JR post. But, I didn't want to lead the discussion with the title.  edit: Good point"
denvernuggets,38q0dm,IdRatherBeLurking,8,Fri Jun 5 21:32:13 2015 UTC,"I guess. We'll let the community decide.   Personally I strongly dislike Iguodala. He was an outright traitor, he's overrated, he's lost any offensive skills that he once had, and he is one of the main reasons I'm rooting against the Warriors during the finals.   pituay, good riddance."
denvernuggets,38jgt5,BlindManBaldwin,4,Thu Jun 4 17:02:59 2015 UTC,What about an Associate Head Coach? Maybe we hire 2 of the 4?
denvernuggets,38jgt5,ADinHD,5,Thu Jun 4 18:41:32 2015 UTC,Just have a head coach by committee.
denvernuggets,38jgt5,eathbau,2,Thu Jun 4 18:46:04 2015 UTC,Can't see it happening under the Kroenke's tbh
denvernuggets,38jgt5,aatencio91,9,Fri Jun 5 03:56:40 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have Woodson, Hunt, or D'Antoni than Malone.  Also, of all of the candidates for the Nuggets job, Hunt stands alone as the only guy not named Mike."
denvernuggets,38jgt5,IMDATBOY,21,Thu Jun 4 17:26:45 2015 UTC,"Sadly, his name isn't Mike Hunt."
denvernuggets,38jgt5,eathbau,4,Thu Jun 4 17:30:25 2015 UTC,Wow I'm glad I came here.  Never would have realized the pattern of Mikes.  Guess the Nuggets are trying to be...like Mike.
denvernuggets,38jgt5,aatencio91,4,Thu Jun 4 18:54:34 2015 UTC,Any reason? The guy pulled miracles with the Kings last season
denvernuggets,38jgt5,eelliw,3,Thu Jun 4 20:39:50 2015 UTC,"I dunno, they fired him for a reason and I don't know what that reason was."
denvernuggets,38jgt5,aatencio91,3,Thu Jun 4 20:48:54 2015 UTC,"This was talked about a lot over in r/nba when it happened. I personally think Malone is the best candidate out of all the mentioned coaches right now.He was fired by Sacramento after butting heads with the GM and ownership, but he was coaching the Kings to a solid record at the start of the season. He had the team playing very well, and seemed to have the support of the entire locker room. Demarcus Cousins in particular was very vocal when the news broke about Malone's firing. The Kings seemed to genuinely enjoy playing for Malone, which I think the Nuggets desperately need in a coach, especially with what happened to Shaw. The Nuggets are my team, but I followed the Kings pretty closely due to fantasy last year, so Im just throwing in my two cents."
denvernuggets,38jgt5,eelliw,3,Thu Jun 4 21:42:09 2015 UTC,Well cool. I'd certainly be down to give him a shot. The Nuggets need a turnaround and maybe Malone is the guy to do it. I didn't know the circumstances of his firing but it sounds similar to the Thibs situation in Chicago.
denvernuggets,38jgt5,chucho320,2,Thu Jun 4 21:44:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was pretty excited to see his name pop up on my feed. He's unproven as a head coach, but he comes from a pretty good coaching tree, and has shown signs that he knows how to coach a team at the highest level. The job should ultimately goto Malone, or Hunt imo."
denvernuggets,38jgt5,chokethewookie,2,Thu Jun 4 22:09:05 2015 UTC,"If he butts head with ownership, he'd be a bad fit here.  Our idiot owner thinks he knows it all and won't tolerate anyone challenging that."
denvernuggets,38jgt5,OkAutopilot,3,Fri Jun 5 04:57:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'd want them to hire Malone, but I think it was a good move to interview him."
denvernuggets,38jgt5,IMDATBOY,2,Thu Jun 4 18:23:17 2015 UTC,I like Malone more than Woodson.
denvernuggets,38jgt5,paledragon64,3,Thu Jun 4 18:22:34 2015 UTC,"As a Kings fan, I approve of hiring Malone.  I think he'd be great if you guys retained your talent, as he's worked well with so many different point guards and I think he could find ways to make a very effective big man lineup of Faried and Nurkic on the defensive end.  He would be great for Nurkic's defensive development.  He'd be great for the chemistry between the players.  And if you guys blow it up and build around Gallo and Nurkic?  He's great for building a fresh culture.  For some reason I just think he'd be a good fit here for a few years at least. The only thing I'd worry about is the pace of the team, which may be a reason to prefer Malone if you guys are blowing it up rather than sticking with Ty and Faried."
denvernuggets,38jgt5,teensonacid,2,Thu Jun 4 18:58:35 2015 UTC,"Malone was the guy who was actually doing a good job at the beginning of the year and then got fired because Demarcus was out, right?  Yeah...I think he'd be a good coach for us. It would be pretty fitting, since you guys have George Karl now."
denvernuggets,38jgt5,paledragon64,3,Fri Jun 5 04:00:03 2015 UTC,so we send Ty & Kenneth to the Kings and Boogie comes here? edit; GM me for a day http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=ogbmlyv
denvernuggets,38jgt5,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Jun 4 21:42:43 2015 UTC,I'm pretty okay with this
denvernuggets,38h1fu,IdRatherBeLurking,17,Thu Jun 4 03:54:22 2015 UTC,Eyyyyy
denvernuggets,38h1fu,Wtfitzchris,3,Thu Jun 4 04:00:10 2015 UTC,Go Nuggets!  Also how'd you do on that math final?
denvernuggets,38h1fu,Wtfitzchris,6,Thu Jun 4 17:01:08 2015 UTC,"Ha I bombed it! Still pulled an 86% in the class, but I got something like 55% on the final.   How about you guys?"
denvernuggets,38h1fu,Wtfitzchris,3,Thu Jun 4 17:02:14 2015 UTC,"We all passed, but that final was rough.  I left a few questions blank and somehow still ended up getting a 70% on it."
denvernuggets,38h1fu,pairidaeza,3,Thu Jun 4 17:09:49 2015 UTC,"Ha congrats. I don't know why I did so poorly- I figured I'd get a 70 since we always got half credit for trying. I'm not so certain that was the case here, unless I literally got every question wrong.   I kind of miss Son, he was a great professor."
denvernuggets,38h1fu,pairidaeza,3,Thu Jun 4 17:13:30 2015 UTC,All I can think of is the final might have been graded differently since it wasn't Son that made it.    I miss him too though.  It's too bad he doesn't teach any classes at Metro.  He's the best math professor I've had.
denvernuggets,38h1fu,CPage12,15,Thu Jun 4 17:18:37 2015 UTC,Two years ago this sub had just 189 readers and The_NGUYENNER and I (AKA NattyRedd) were the only mods.

denvernuggets,38h1fu,zachtothejohnson,6,Thu Jun 4 12:40:59 2015 UTC,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again. This is my favorite sub."
denvernuggets,38h1fu,pairidaeza,2,Thu Jun 4 14:34:54 2015 UTC,Thanks! That's a massive compliment!   Are there any improvements you'd like to see?
denvernuggets,38ggga,kidhumbeats,17,Thu Jun 4 01:19:12 2015 UTC,"Our hand was forced.  The team was performing badly and Mozgov already had a rapport and prior success with Blatt.  I was very sad to see him go, but I am glad he's contending for a championship.   I had just hoped that would one day be with the Nuggets :'("
denvernuggets,38ggga,pairidaeza,12,Thu Jun 4 01:31:12 2015 UTC,"I'm rooting for Mozgov and the Cavs to win. I also hate the Warriors, so that helps."
denvernuggets,38ggga,BlindManBaldwin,3,Thu Jun 4 03:13:49 2015 UTC,Two firsts! This was a no brainer.
denvernuggets,38ggga,growedup,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:47:58 2015 UTC,Is that what the Nuggets got  from Cleveland? Two first round picks?
denvernuggets,38ggga,The_NGUYENNER,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:28:34 2015 UTC,"yep, but sadly we traded one of them just to get rid of McGee. So it was pretty much a first round pick + shedding McGee's contract for Moz."
denvernuggets,38ggga,paledragon64,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:49:01 2015 UTC,"Don't forget about that Iguodala guy, who was outstanding off the bench and played terrific D on LeBron, forcing OT.   I has a sad. :("
denvernuggets,38ggga,teensonacid,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:02:55 2015 UTC,Breh. Iggy on his Robert Horry shit tonight. So prood of the old bourdain.
denvernuggets,38gp36,wefr5927,13,Thu Jun 4 02:21:36 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm not entirely against D'Antoni..."
denvernuggets,38gp36,pairidaeza,8,Thu Jun 4 02:55:06 2015 UTC,I'm not either.  What are the better realistic options?
denvernuggets,38gp36,EClydez,4,Thu Jun 4 03:15:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I have no idea. This is a very important point for the front office. If Josh and TC stuff this up they are going to have a massive exodus on their hands. Fans and players will revolt."
denvernuggets,38gp36,pairidaeza,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:17:06 2015 UTC,"Jeff Van Gundy, Mark Jackson, Steve Nash, Tom Thibodeau, Scott Brooks."
denvernuggets,38gp36,volkof,3,Thu Jun 4 19:26:04 2015 UTC,"Van Gundy? No Thanks.   Jackson? Yeah, okay, Benedict Arnold.  Nash? Ask Jason Kidd and Derek Fisher how going straight from playing to coaching has been.  Thibodeau? He'd never coach this roster.  Brooks? Not coaching this year and he's a terrible play caller. If he couldn't win it all with guys like Westbrook, Durant, Harden, and Ibaka what makes you think he'd succeed here?"
denvernuggets,38gp36,volkof,3,Thu Jun 4 19:48:22 2015 UTC,What do you have against Van Gundy?   Kidd is actually killing it in Milwaukee.   Thibs would rather coach then not. He took over Chicago before Rose.   Brooks is way better than D'antoni
denvernuggets,38gp36,aatencio91,0,Thu Jun 4 20:16:22 2015 UTC,"I just don't think Van Gundy would be a good fit with our roster, I don't see him lighting a fire under our guys butts.  By Kidd killing it, do you mean a .500 record this year? I suppose that's killing it in the east.  Thibodeau is going to find a nice landing spot with real pieces, I just don't see him being attracted to this roster. I'd love it, but its not realistic.   Eh, Brooks is about the same as D'Antoni in my book. They both had an MVP and several all stars but they couldn't get over the hump to win it all. He's already come out and said he's not coaching this year, so there's no point in even thinking about it."
denvernuggets,38gp36,aatencio91,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:56:02 2015 UTC,I say we take a risk on a big name college coach.
denvernuggets,38gp36,aatencio91,2,Thu Jun 4 03:28:15 2015 UTC,"What college coach is going to give up total control of the team to come be told what to do in the pros? The money is probably comparable and in college they're allowed to hand pick their own players to a much larger extent than in the pros, and especially larger than in Denver.  You think John Callipari, Mike Krzyzewski, or someone like that is going to leave the NCAA?"
denvernuggets,38gp36,kooredaan,0,Thu Jun 4 16:33:29 2015 UTC,I think most coaches would gladly do that so they don't have to recruit.
denvernuggets,38gp36,volkof,3,Thu Jun 4 19:19:51 2015 UTC,"Then why are guys like the dudes I listed still in the NCAA? There's more glory in the NBA, better players, more publicity... Coaches rarely bounce between the NCAA and NBA because of the control factor. They build their own teams in college, and in the pros they have to go through their GMs."
denvernuggets,38gp36,volkof,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:24:56 2015 UTC,"I said we should take a risk on someone.  The Nuggets aren't really an attractive destination for players, therefore let's take a risk on a coach.  We already know what we'll get in D'antoni"
denvernuggets,38gp36,volkof,3,Thu Jun 4 19:33:04 2015 UTC,"We know what we'll get in D'Antoni. Players know what they'll get in D'Antoni. Agents know what they'll get in D'Antoni. You said it yourself, Denver isn't an attractive destination for players, and bringing in some college coach who has no NBA experience isn't going to make the free agent market suddenly say ""Hey, I'll go check out what newbie is doing in Denver.""  NCAA coaches build their own teams every year. They wouldn't want to come here of all places in the NBA because the only pieces they get come via the draft and trades and bargain-bin free agents, and even then only with the consent of the GM. By pointing out that they recruit and that Denver isn't a FA destination, you're making the anti-NCAA coach argument for me."
denvernuggets,38gp36,corybyu,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:47:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but we should take a chance. Besides, good management is more important than having a good coach."
denvernuggets,38gp36,ADinHD,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:17:22 2015 UTC,So the Nuggets should get a new (stand in) owner and GM? I'd be happy with that.
denvernuggets,38gp36,aatencio91,2,Thu Jun 4 23:08:50 2015 UTC,"Seriously, has that ever worked? I can't think of any college coaches to successfully make that jump. Brad Stevens, Lon Kruger, Jerry Tarkanian, Rick Pitino, John Calipari... Has it ever happened?  I'll take D'Antoni over ANY college coach. That Suns team with Nash, Stoudemire, Marion was so much fun to watch! He could bring that excitement to this roster again. We have an advantage playing at this elevation, might as well use it and run our opponents outta town. The way we did before Brian Shaw.  With all that said, my vote is for Melvin. You can tell the players love him, and I thought he called some great in-bounds plays when he took over. He deserves a shot with this roster, I'd hate to lose him and see him succeed elsewhere."
denvernuggets,38gp36,weiner_cleaner,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:53:32 2015 UTC,You really don't think Brad Stevens has been successful in Boston? I think if you give Calipari another chance he'd be good.  Coach K would be phenomenal (he'd never leave though)
denvernuggets,38gp36,aatencio91,2,Thu Jun 4 19:18:26 2015 UTC,"Getting the seventh seed with a losing record doesn't show how good of a coach he is, it shows how weak the eastern conference is. He took Butler to back to back championships! He still has an NBA job so there's a chance for him to succeed at this level.  But no, I really don't think I'd call his time in Boston a success."
denvernuggets,38gp36,growedup,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:33:32 2015 UTC,He's been there for one year and he took a team from 25 wins to 40 with the same talent level. Do you expect our coach to take us from 30 to 45 wins in one year? Especially in the west.
denvernuggets,38gp36,with2nns,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:20:40 2015 UTC,"He's been there two years bud. Back to my original point though, find me a successful coach that has made the jump straight from college to the pros. And if we're comparing apples to oranges, Mike Budenholzer has been in Atlanta the same amount of time and increased wins by 22... Maybe you consider 40 wins to make the playoffs a success, but I don't.  No college coach please. Please god no. NOOOOO."
denvernuggets,38hmw0,bettycrockerpot,3,Thu Jun 4 07:22:06 2015 UTC,Link? :D

denvernuggets,38hmw0,aatencio91,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:05:16 2015 UTC,"If the Nuggets trade Ty to the Kings for the 6th pick, I'd love them to go Hezonja/Winslow/Johnson and WCS with 6 and 7."
denvernuggets,38hmw0,ParadeShitter,2,Thu Jun 4 16:43:05 2015 UTC,love his game. i feel like he gets unfairly downgraded for staying at kentucky
denvernuggets,38gmkp,JMadFour,18,Thu Jun 4 02:03:19 2015 UTC,I would have to say the Lakers.
denvernuggets,38gmkp,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Jun 4 02:08:05 2015 UTC,"Is that a real rivalry, or is it one-sided? I know it seemed real back in the Melo days, but I don't know if the Lakers hate us or if it's just one way."
denvernuggets,38gmkp,aatencio91,3,Thu Jun 4 16:38:33 2015 UTC,What rivalry did we have that wasn't one sided? Maybe the Jazz?
denvernuggets,38gmkp,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Jun 4 16:40:19 2015 UTC,"Makes me think of this image, where the Lakers are Don Draper"
denvernuggets,38gmkp,hayclaylaybaymaysay,7,Fri Jun 5 17:02:20 2015 UTC,"Things kind of blew up with the Lakers considering what happened with Kobe in Denver. They've knocked us out in the first round a few too many times as well. So a lot of fans would deem them to be our bitterest rival because of that, coupled with their dynastic presence.  The Trailblazers have always had a heated rivalry with us given how close they are geographically, and the fact we've swapped certain players for decades (Vandeweghe, Lever, and more recently Miller, Barton, Hickson and Afflalo.)  The Jazz are also a strong candidate due to their proximity and there have been some hotly contested series over the years.  The Thunder are probably our most recent rival, given their meteoric rise. I remember back in the Melo era how he and KD would go toe-to-toe but too often the Thunder prevailed, which only fuelled the fire. I still hate KD to this day because of that.  Then there's the Clippers, given the fact they're kind of blown into a fully-fledged force in the West. There's no real reason for a rivalry here except that they might have leap-frogged us in the playoff spots.  The Timberwolves are also a bigger rival now thanks to the likes of Love and Rubio, and will probably continue that trend now that they've got Wiggins and co.  Essentially, any other team in the Northwest is a rival, and, indeed, the rest of the West since it's always such a tight race to the playoffs."
denvernuggets,38gmkp,pairidaeza,4,Thu Jun 4 02:28:50 2015 UTC,Fuck the Warriors
denvernuggets,38gmkp,followthelawson,3,Thu Jun 4 14:09:00 2015 UTC,"I'll always have a special kind of hatred for them for beating Karl, for Iguadala going there, for Mark Jackson getting in a little bitch fight with Scott Hastings on Jim Rome, and for Steph Curry's stupid-ass Mort face."
denvernuggets,38gmkp,aatencio91,2,Thu Jun 4 16:41:45 2015 UTC,"Ah the warriors, I also hate them. I hate Curry and I hate his daughter's mug being everywhere. So unprofessional."
denvernuggets,38gmkp,BlindManBaldwin,3,Thu Jun 4 17:47:16 2015 UTC,for me it's been the Jazz and the Spurs then both LA teams
denvernuggets,38gmkp,teensonacid,3,Thu Jun 4 03:33:00 2015 UTC,I'm not sure you can say it's a 'rivalry' if it's predominantly one-sided. So in that sense I'm not sure who would consider the Nuggets a rival. Maybe the Jazz don't like the Nuggets due to their geographical convenience.   I would say Nuggets fans either dislike OKC or the Lakers more.
denvernuggets,38gmkp,FraserTheAmazer,2,Thu Jun 4 12:58:08 2015 UTC,"I hate the Lakers and always have, but I don't know if they are the best rival example."
denvernuggets,38gmkp,BlindManBaldwin,2,Thu Jun 4 03:12:55 2015 UTC,"Since the Spurs and Lakers generally have owned us over the years, I'd go with Utah when it comes to a balanced rivalry."

denvernuggets,38g4nq,OkAutopilot,4,Thu Jun 4 01:29:08 2015 UTC,"Nobody dominates those leagues in the way you see players dominate the NBA. It's very uncommon to see 15 PPG scorers, and the ones you do see are getting an abnormal amount of minutes."

denvernuggets,38e0nk,aatencio91,2,Wed Jun 3 16:30:02 2015 UTC,Blow up the roster and go young=Hunt Keep the vets and see what happens=Pringles man  That's what I would do.
denvernuggets,38e0nk,SapoC,2,Wed Jun 3 22:28:06 2015 UTC,"This article says that the Nuggets have talked to Mike D'Antoni, but haven't formally interviewed him. A connection I hadn't considered that would be beneficial for the Nuggets is that D'Antoni coached Chandler and Gallo in New York, so he already has a level of familiarity with the roster."
denvernuggets,38e0nk,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Wed Jun 3 16:36:14 2015 UTC,"If they are 100% confident that they can get this team in shape, then I'm all for hiring D'Antoni. But if it's anything but 100%, I think Melvin is the safe bet."
denvernuggets,38e0nk,growedup,5,Wed Jun 3 16:47:57 2015 UTC,"I think the hiring of D'Antoni would definitely help turn the team around. The fast pace fits with what Lawson and Faried like, and would probably make them feel better about staying. If it wouldn't, Lin had success under D'Antoni and is a free agent who may like to play for him again, so Ty would become a little more expendable in exchange for another top 10 pick which the Nuggets could pair with their 7th overall to select Winslow/Johnson/Hezonja and Willie Cauley-Stein, which in turn makes Faried a little more expendable for maybe a mid-first rounder or tail-end-of-the-lottery pick which could be used on a guy like Devin Booker, RJ Hunter, or some other guard."
denvernuggets,38e0nk,chokethewookie,0,Wed Jun 3 17:09:04 2015 UTC,The only thing that scares me more than bringing D'Antoni in is bringing in D'Antoni AND Jeremy Lin.
denvernuggets,38e0nk,growedup,3,Wed Jun 3 19:54:58 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't you want D'Antoni? He's a proven commodity who loves a fast paced offense which works well with the altitude in Denver.
denvernuggets,38e0nk,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Wed Jun 3 19:58:31 2015 UTC,I don't want him because I remember the first time he coached here.   And I'm still bitter that he didn't tell us that Tskita was godawful before we made that pick.
denvernuggets,38e0nk,JMadFour,3,Wed Jun 3 22:36:06 2015 UTC,"D'Antoni is a known quantity, for sure. Other than that 4 year stretch in Phoenix, D'Antoni has been an average coach. If the Nuggets are going to go the mid-tier-retread coaching route, then I think they could do better.   For what it's worth, I think they have known that with Coach Hunt in their back pocket they don't have to settle for a coach like D'Antoni.  Edit: my original post probably should have said that I'm not in love with hiring D'Antoni, but it's scary to think they might bring Lin on, too."

denvernuggets,38dyr2,OkAutopilot,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:24:03 2015 UTC,I think /u/Nate_Timmons put it well-   The Nuggets have basically said two things: 1) They have no coaching timetable. 2) They don’t want leaks. Can we be upset they follow suit?
denvernuggets,38dyr2,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:30:51 2015 UTC,"I mean, I can be upset if they don't have a coach in place well before the draft so we know what we're doing and what direction we're going. That makes me feel bad about our team and our front office. It also makes me think that Hunt is the only serious candidate."
denvernuggets,38dyr2,OkAutopilot,2,Wed Jun 3 21:32:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed, he also went on to say that it wouldn't look good if we were holding workouts for guys we might draft without a coach there. Unless, of course, we're sticking with Hunt."

denvernuggets,38dyr2,teensonacid,2,Wed Jun 3 23:10:31 2015 UTC,good god no..please..no
denvernuggets,38dhmi,IdRatherBeLurking,6,Wed Jun 3 14:39:09 2015 UTC,I'm all about this pick. I have no problem giving this kid room to grow and blossom into something amazing. His size and athleticism is hard to pass up.  PLEASE NUGGETS.
denvernuggets,38dhmi,martinap,4,Thu Jun 4 00:07:35 2015 UTC,"For me Johnson is the main ""potential"" guy. He doesn't necessarily have the nba polished skills yet but what he does have is potential. His sheer athleticism and physicality make him someone to watch and in three years he could be a star. I like him but not sure if I'm totally sold yet."
denvernuggets,38dhmi,THECHUNGAWANGA,3,Wed Jun 3 18:54:56 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing with his potential is that it appears that it's slowly being realized. He was good in high school and then through his year of college he improved on the aspects of his game that were weaker. He's a hard worker who isn't afraid to address his weaknesses in the gym.  He needed work on his accuracy so he knuckled down and got better. He needs work on his physicality (he has the build to finish better at the rim and power through defenders) and I think he'll work on bettering that.  He strikes me as the type of guy that the team needs, from the locker room to the FO. He's a leader, he knows his shortcomings, and he works hard to fix those shortcomings. I'd be very happy with him at 7."
denvernuggets,38dhmi,aatencio91,2,Wed Jun 3 19:14:20 2015 UTC,"This guy is my draft crush. While Hezonja is growing on me (you're turning me, /u/IdRatherBeLurking), and Justise Winslow is a beast, there's something about Johnson that makes me raise my eyebrows a little bit. I think Winslow will be gone before the Nuggets pick, and Johnson still edges out Hezonja for me."
denvernuggets,38dhmi,aatencio91,2,Wed Jun 3 15:44:49 2015 UTC,"Ha, and you've been persuading me. Especially after doing this breakdown."
denvernuggets,38dhmi,aatencio91,2,Wed Jun 3 15:51:25 2015 UTC,"I'll be pretty happy with either of these guys, I think. Hezonja's shot looks next to automatic, and Johnson needs some coaching but I think he could become dominant."
denvernuggets,38dhmi,bettycrockerpot,2,Wed Jun 3 15:58:38 2015 UTC,"I really like how Johnson drives, and his transition game seems perfect for this team."
denvernuggets,38dhmi,aatencio91,2,Wed Jun 3 16:11:27 2015 UTC,A 240 wing ain't no joke
denvernuggets,38dhmi,hayclaylaybaymaysay,3,Wed Jun 3 20:48:46 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I think I've heard of a 6'8/240 lbs wing out of Akron, OH. Can't remember his name, though..."
denvernuggets,38dhmi,aatencio91,3,Wed Jun 3 20:54:36 2015 UTC,Dammit you just overhyped me on Johnson. Not fair dude. Not. Fair.
denvernuggets,38dhmi,eathbau,2,Thu Jun 4 00:10:25 2015 UTC,"The question is: does he fit today's NBA game? Today's great wings (not including LeBron, because he can do everything) do 2 things offensively: Drive to the basket and shoot the 3. When they drive, they can kick the ball out, absorb contact and get fouled, or finish at the rim.   Earlier today I said I wanted Stanley Johnson, but after playing around with this in my head, I would love Herzonja more. His skillset is so much more NBA-ready offensively for what a wing player needs to bring. Reading this breakdown sort of confirms my thoughts (because Johnson is a weak shooter and finisher)."
denvernuggets,38dhmi,fuggingolliwog,2,Fri Jun 5 20:48:18 2015 UTC,"Johnson is a weak but improving shooter. His numbers went up from HS to college, and continued to go up through the season.  He's 240 lbs. so driving to the basket should not be an issue.  As long as he gets proper coaching, he could be the best of the bunch in a few years. He has two-way potential, too, and should work well in a running offense like Denver will probably have."
denvernuggets,38dhmi,Nugforlife,2,Fri Jun 5 22:35:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think that's a red flag.  I'm not sure about his jumper, statistically he was very good off the jumper but the possibilities of it being a fluke year are real. This is the biggest issue. He's a guy with a reputation out of HS as a bad shooter and yet while his overall line suggests he became a good one you can still see relevant data sets that suggest he won't be a very good one at least for a while.  Anyhow if we're drafting Johnson, I'm hoping it's not for his jumpshot."
denvernuggets,38dhum,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Wed Jun 3 14:40:29 2015 UTC,Really hoping we get Melvin

denvernuggets,38bh2m,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Wed Jun 3 17:07:31 2015 UTC,That was a quote from then Rockies GM Dan O'Dowd given on 104.3 The Fan in Denver. It became an immediate joke because you obviously can't trust the Rockies.
denvernuggets,38bh2m,aatencio91,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:56:32 2015 UTC,The Monforts make the Kroenkes look like Mark Cuban.
denvernuggets,38bh2m,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Wed Jun 3 19:57:48 2015 UTC,"The Monforts are awful, but it's because they won't bring in the right baseball leadership (they rejected NOLAN FUCKING RYAN a few years ago, before he went to the Astros and helped steer that organization).   The Kroenkes really aren't that bad, though. They do good things for all of their teams, just not often enough at the same time. The Avs were awful while Karl was leading the Nuggets to the playoffs over and over, and now the Avs are on the upswing and the Nuggets.... not so much. The Rams are turning around as well. Hopefully they find some balance and get the Nuggets straightened out."
denvernuggets,38bh2m,aatencio91,7,Wed Jun 3 20:05:16 2015 UTC,"Everybody needs to calm down. Believe it or not the Nuggets have one of the best front offices in the NBA. Just look at last year's draft, when our front office was fully together we basically drafted 3 lottery picks. The Nuggets are taking their time because they're probably not going to hire Melvin hunt. Are front office loves to keep things secret (it's a good thing). All us as fans can do is sit back and see what they're going to do."
denvernuggets,38bh2m,eg14000,2,Wed Jun 3 04:49:48 2015 UTC,"Who else is there to hire? Why were they so quick to put faith in Brian Shaw before he'd ever been a head coach yet are unwilling to put their faith in Melvin Hunt, who has proven success and chemistry with the current roster?"
denvernuggets,38bh2m,pairidaeza,3,Wed Jun 3 05:26:35 2015 UTC,"Who else is there to hire?    Assistants from around the league? D'Antoni? Maybe Stan Van Gundy? Lots of names are still out there, and as you said about them being quick to put faith in a guy who'd never been a head coach before, they'll probably want to hire someone who does have HC experience this time around, kinda like the Broncos when they hired John Fox after firing Josh McDaniels."
denvernuggets,38bh2m,aatencio91,3,Wed Jun 3 15:52:14 2015 UTC,why rush and make the same mistake again? i believe they're just being thorough this time
denvernuggets,38bh2m,bettycrockerpot,2,Wed Jun 3 05:47:15 2015 UTC,"But back to my original point, who else is there to hire now? D'Antoni?"
denvernuggets,38bh2m,pairidaeza,2,Wed Jun 3 05:56:25 2015 UTC,is rudy tomjanovich available
denvernuggets,38bh2m,bettycrockerpot,2,Wed Jun 3 08:55:04 2015 UTC,"According to Wikipedia, he's a scout for the Lakers."
denvernuggets,38bh2m,aatencio91,2,Wed Jun 3 15:52:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, D'Antoni is good coach for are team. In Denver you have to run. Additionally If we trade Ty Lawson, and sign jeremy lin, we become interesting again. Plus we might win games."
denvernuggets,38bh2m,eg14000,5,Wed Jun 3 06:15:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, D'Antoni is good coach for are our team.   Also, why are you so keen on Lin? Sell him to me."
denvernuggets,38bh2m,pairidaeza,4,Wed Jun 3 06:20:44 2015 UTC,"Lin is a system player, meaning he plays best in the pick and roll. The last 2 years Lin has not played in his ideal system. With James Harden and Kobe Bryant taking most of those shots. The Nuggets don't have a shot chucker, it would be the perfect situation for him. The team would play as a team and everyone would move the ball.  Not to mention it would make the Nuggets relevant again.  Lin obviously has a lot of fans around the world. If he starts playing good again (which he will under Mike D'Antoni) the Nuggets might get a larger amount of loyal fans. Like the Warriors fans. That would help our free agency situation immensely. That's one of the reasons why we lost it iggy. He saw the crazy amount of fans the Golden State Warriors had and compare them to the playoff spoiled nugget fans.  In conclusion the Nuggets would be more interesting if they had Lin. He would be the humble face of the franchise and I believe we can win games with him. Team basketball is not dead in the Mile High City and Lin could prove that."
denvernuggets,38bh2m,eg14000,3,Wed Jun 3 06:41:49 2015 UTC,"Interesting points.   So, by picking Lin up for nothing, we would be free to trade Ty for a pick?  I'd be for that. But isn't acquiring Lin contingent upon us hiring D'Antoni?"
denvernuggets,38bh2m,pairidaeza,3,Wed Jun 3 06:56:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes it is."
denvernuggets,38bh2m,eg14000,3,Wed Jun 3 06:59:40 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm actually warming to this idea. He might not be such a bad pick up. His contract has expired, right?"
denvernuggets,38bh2m,pairidaeza,3,Wed Jun 3 07:07:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response man! I am definitely stressing out but this scenario gives me a lot of hope. Any other coaches/ scenarios that would be a positive thing for us?  I never doubted our drafting ability, I'm super happy about all our younglings. Its everything else that I'm worried about."
denvernuggets,38bh2m,eg14000,3,Wed Jun 3 07:30:06 2015 UTC,Think of linsanity over a entire season.
denvernuggets,38bh2m,pairidaeza,3,Wed Jun 3 06:50:34 2015 UTC,"You're a funny guy. Linsanity was in a large part to NBA teams not having scouted him. Once his tendencies were known, defenses could coordinate to stop him."
denvernuggets,38bh2m,eg14000,2,Wed Jun 3 06:54:53 2015 UTC,"No, once Melo came back it stopped."
denvernuggets,38bh2m,pairidaeza,2,Wed Jun 3 06:58:55 2015 UTC,I'll have to take your word for it. I didn't really pay attention.
denvernuggets,38bh2m,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:59:53 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree- I think Tim Connelly and his scouting crew don't get enough credit, partially due to Kroenke leaning on him to make certain moves (JJ, Foye and Nate come to mind)."
denvernuggets,38bh2m,pairidaeza,4,Wed Jun 3 14:41:53 2015 UTC,A lot of fans think we'll be the worst in the West.  Our front office has been hit-and-miss for a while now. I am just tired of hearing the same old song about being aggressive and then not seeing anything of that nature materialise.
denvernuggets,38bh2m,aatencio91,2,Wed Jun 3 04:29:29 2015 UTC,"Everyone is talking about Kroenke spewing garbage about an aggressive offseason, but the only thing I've heard from him this year was that they'd be aggressive in the draft. Besides, it's not technically the NBA offseason yet. If they're waiting for an assistant coach, like Tyron Lou, there's not much they can do right now. They can't aggressively chase free agents because free agency hasn't started yet. They haven't had a chance to be aggressive in the offseason, even if they did say anything about doing so this year."
denvernuggets,38bh2m,MileHighPride30,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:48:52 2015 UTC,"Disagree with the coaching search part. The Pels agreed to terms with Alvin Gentry to be their coach already, so that argument doesn't seem to hold a lot of water"
denvernuggets,38bh2m,aatencio91,3,Wed Jun 3 19:45:25 2015 UTC,"They interviewed him before the GSW/HOU series. The Nuggets should have begun interviews with assistants then, but our FO is tight lipped. Maybe the guys they wanted to interview weren't allowed to interview by their current teams or due to schedule conflicts. Tyron Lou is an assistant for the Cavs and they haven't had much time between series until the past week."

I have no confidence in our FO.  Kroenke is clueless and TC has been all talk and zero action.  Are we going to wait until draft day and all available coaches are gone, and then scramble to get everyone on the same page? Yeah, that sounds like us.

denvernuggets,38bh2m,MileHighPride30,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:58:39 2015 UTC,Very true. But at least it seems to eliminate the idea that the Nuggets hands were completely tied because playoff basketball was still going on

denvernuggets,38bh2m,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Wed Jun 3 15:09:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think we needed to, so I'll have to disagree about going the sixers route.

They're not even guaranteed to come out of this on top, so if you're going that route you better be damn certain you know what you're doing."
denvernuggets,387rmi,icarus_adam,5,Tue Jun 2 13:34:16 2015 UTC,"I think this shows that Hunt is the man for the job. You need someone the players like, especially someone like Danilo, who you never see in headlines wanting to be trading or fooling around on social media.   The interview also pretty much confirmed what most though about Shaw in regards to Gallo's play time, he never had a chance to get into form playing under him.  Thanks for the translation!"
denvernuggets,387rmi,adamc25,4,Tue Jun 2 13:40:07 2015 UTC,When has hiring a guy just because the players like him ever worked? You hire the right guy not the friendly guy.

Also, I probably should have worded differently, you have a coach your players want to play for, Shaw obviously wasn't that guy. I think Hunt has an awesome mix of a dude you want to play your hardest for, but also has a game style that fits perfect with the nuggets roster, while also providing what the front office is after."

At one point, Earl Boykins was the only black guy on the court and a friend of my dad's who happened to be black said ""This just seems wrong that the only black guy on the court is 5'5""."""

That said, I hope he retires as a Nugget many prosperous years from now."
denvernuggets,388k41,SwaggyB23,13,Tue Jun 2 16:42:55 2015 UTC,Am I the only one here that wants Faried to stay?
denvernuggets,388k41,tebam,6,Tue Jun 2 16:52:40 2015 UTC,"I love me some Manimal, but I worry that he is best suited for coming off the bench and we all know those days are long gone. I'd much rather start:  PG Ty  SG Foye  SF Chandler  PF Gallo  C Nurk  With the second string looking like:  PG Jameer  SG Barton  SF Draft pick :)  PF Faried  C Jokic/ FA  We're obviously missing a few pieces to make this work, but that'd be my ideal standard lineups with the current roster."
denvernuggets,388k41,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Tue Jun 2 17:10:49 2015 UTC,"Those days are long gone? If Andre Iguodala and Manu Ginobili were willing to do it, why would we assume Faried wouldn't?   If I were him I would be o.k. with it.  But only if there's a player worthy of starting over him, which we don't have now. But if we were to do something crazy like get Okafor; I think Faried might be open to coming off the bench. But as the team is right now, there's no reason for him to come off the bench.  Sometimes I wonder if Nuggets fans remember that Faried started for Team USA a year ago and had the 4th most minutes on the team. If Team USA wasn't asking him to come off the bench very often, then why should we?  edit: in your first lineup, we would be going small and would be better off with Faried starting at Center than Nurkic.  also, Faried was 2nd on team USA in FG%, lead the team in rebounds, and was 3rd in points"
denvernuggets,388k41,NUGGman,4,Tue Jun 2 17:37:39 2015 UTC,"I reckon when he's 10 years into his career that Faried will be much more receptive to not starting. While he's in Denver on his first big contract? No way that is happening unless he's injured.  Let me know when Team USA Faried shows back up and then I'll think of staring him over Chandler.  How would starting Chandler, Gallo and Nurkic at the 3,4 and 5 spots ""going small""?"
denvernuggets,388k41,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:05:37 2015 UTC,"4 of those starters could play guard if asked to, I call that small ball. Pretty much any lineup with Gallo at 4 is a small lineup, though."
denvernuggets,388k41,NUGGman,2,Tue Jun 2 18:16:08 2015 UTC,"I always considered ""Playing small"" to mean that you might be running an SG at SF, or a smaller PF at center,but I see what you mean now."
denvernuggets,388k41,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Jun 2 18:26:35 2015 UTC,I think if it's a good idea to start Gallo at 4 Faried might be open to it. But I'm not a fan of your 4 being your best outside shooter.
denvernuggets,388k41,NUGGman,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:49:43 2015 UTC,But I'm not a fan of your 4 being your best outside shooter.   That's where I see appeal in Hezonja. Dude could provide some nice 3-pt ability at the 3.

denvernuggets,388k41,drmeattornado,2,Wed Jun 3 03:24:23 2015 UTC,"Comparing Team USA and the NBA is not comparing apples to apples. Playing abroad heavily favors more athletic players, especially ones with the tenacity to get rebounds (which suited Faried perfectly). In Denver, he is simply overpaid and has not shown any developments on either end of the floor that encourage me to think that he will grow to deserve that contract. Sending him to a playoff team where he can come off the bench seems to be the ideal situation for him where he can use his energy to rebound and score inside against less athletic opponents."
denvernuggets,388k41,imhandy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:57:42 2015 UTC,All of the players who were on Team USA are NBA players. I think we could all agree that every other player on that roster is better than the players on the Nuggets roster. I can conclude that Faried can be very successful with complimentary pieces around him.  I agree that the ideal situation for him would be to join a playoff team where he can come off the bench. But you could probably say that for most of our players with trade value. It worked pretty well for the Nuggets that have left in the past too.
denvernuggets,388k41,NUGGman,2,Tue Jun 2 22:26:52 2015 UTC,"Definitely not. I'll be a Faried fan forever, no matter where he plays."
denvernuggets,388k41,NUGGman,2,Tue Jun 2 17:23:35 2015 UTC,"nope. he's probably overpaid in the opinions of all but a few teams. ""run what you brung"" mentality. he's got some limitations inherent in his game but he'd make any team instantly better with this energy and effort (likely off the bench) but i think he could make a long career out of getting 12 and 9 every night. i wish he'd find a little offensive niche outside of finishing the fast break but his effort is irreplaceable  biggest thing for him is his size. he's not big enough to play center and too rigid to guard the more athletic 4s. he's an energy spurt guy and his finishing minutes are probably largely dictated by the other team's personnel. the fact that he's getting paid what he's getting paid just shows you where denver was at and where they're still at in terms of acquiring and retaining talent. it's ""our"" problem and i think the team should do it's best to do everything they can to help kenneth excel while wearing a nuggets jersey."
denvernuggets,388k41,ParadeShitter,2,Tue Jun 2 17:25:18 2015 UTC,"You are not. This hurts me. A lot. If it helps getting a better team in the long run, sure, but even then, for some reason I'm more concerned with losing Faried then Ty. I love Ty, but he's a ghost at this point."

denvernuggets,388k41,skipaBturner,-1,Wed Jun 3 02:25:21 2015 UTC,"No, I'd love him to stay, but it sounds like he doesn't want to be here. If he won't play 100% for the team, I don't know if I want him on the court for the Nuggets."
denvernuggets,388k41,aatencio91,2,Tue Jun 2 17:49:52 2015 UTC,"He wants to play here, and he'll play 110% for as long as he is here. But him and Ty are both open to change if we keep wallowing in mediocrity like we have been. These guys are supposed to be team leaders, but instead there's constantly trade rumors about them. I can see why they'd be open to the change tbh."
denvernuggets,388k41,Atiredsprucetree,5,Wed Jun 3 00:33:10 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see them traded for the Kings' 6th overall, then the Nuggets can take both Hezonja and Johnson, or Hezonja/Johnson and Willie Cauley-Stein."
denvernuggets,388k41,aatencio91,7,Tue Jun 2 16:44:42 2015 UTC,I think Ty is worth more than the 6th spot alone.
denvernuggets,388k41,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Jun 2 17:09:07 2015 UTC,"Then lets send Ty there for the pick and some cap filler and Faried elsewhere for, what, a mid 1st rounder? An early 2nd rounder?"
denvernuggets,388k41,aatencio91,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:12:47 2015 UTC,"Tough to say, right? Has Faried outperformed his draft slot of #22? I think he's a bit more valuable in a package deal."
denvernuggets,388k41,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Jun 2 17:14:17 2015 UTC,"I think Faried's definitely outperformed the #22 pick. Since 2000 the noteworthy guys drafted there are Jarrett Jack, Courtney Lee, and Mason Plumlee, and I'd take Faried over all of them. And I can't say for sure, but I doubt the #15-21 guys stack up much better."
denvernuggets,388k41,with2nns,2,Tue Jun 2 20:27:40 2015 UTC,I'd say that gives us reason to value him above an equivalent draft pick.

denvernuggets,388k41,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Tue Jun 2 17:09:33 2015 UTC,My money's on Toronto and Sacramento respectively. Ujiri drafted Faried and Ty is Karl's guy.
denvernuggets,388k41,with2nns,3,Tue Jun 2 17:26:13 2015 UTC,Any chance Ty stays or is he as good as gone?
denvernuggets,388k41,BlindManBaldwin,3,Tue Jun 2 21:33:40 2015 UTC,"There was an article last week that said both Ty and Faried indicated they didn't want to be part of a long term rebuild. They quoted ""anonymous sources close to the situation,"" so who knows how much that's worth, but in any case, I could see both Ty and Faried being perfectly fine with playing here if the Nuggets hire Melvin Hunt (who they like) and draft a guy who can be a day one impact guy like I think Justise Winslow, Stanley Johnson, and Mario Hezonja could be, or hire Mike D'Antoni (the guy who made the Suns good in the mid-late 2000's) and employ his ""seven seconds or less"" offense.  EDIT: Here's the article."
denvernuggets,388k41,aatencio91,3,Tue Jun 2 21:48:12 2015 UTC,hmm well I guess
denvernuggets,388k41,BlindManBaldwin,2,Tue Jun 2 22:01:05 2015 UTC,"Will the Denver Nuggets trade Ty Lawson to the Kings for their lottery pick?   I mean it would make perfect sense. a trade of Ty Lawson, Wilson Chandler, and joffrey Laverne. For Nick Sauce some salary dump players and their sixth pick.  The Kings get Ty Lawson a proven player to play with George Karl. Additionally Wilson Chandler and a promising power forward. All they have to do is give up a lottery pick which they haven't had any luck with in the past.  The Nuggets draft Stanley Johnson, and Porzingis two ""potential"" superstars, and call it a draft. (am I crazy or does this make any sense?)"
denvernuggets,388k41,eg14000,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:47:01 2015 UTC,I know Nuggets Fans want more for Ty Lawson and Wilson Chandler. But I think its a fair trade.
denvernuggets,388k41,eg14000,2,Tue Jun 2 22:59:43 2015 UTC,Not just fans- that's how our FO feels too. Why would we give up so much just to move up one spot?
denvernuggets,388k41,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:51:52 2015 UTC,"We're not moving up, were adding their pick."
denvernuggets,388k41,eg14000,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:31:29 2015 UTC,"You're right, sorry."
denvernuggets,388k41,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:51:24 2015 UTC,"That seems like a heck of a lot to give up for the #6 pick. Ty + Lauvergne would probably get it done if we agree to take on whatever bad contracts they have, and even if they want more I'd rather throw in Foye or Erick Green. Chandler's worth at least a low 1st, probably more to a playoff team on draft day, and I think that worth is greater than Stauskas.  Plus, I still like Gary Harris and would rather draft Hezonja who can play the 2 too. Stauskas would just clog that rotation up imo.  Plus we'll have Barton. Completely forgot about him."
denvernuggets,388k41,with2nns,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:12:12 2015 UTC,"What do you like so much about Hezonja? He's a streaky shooter that averaged less than 14 points per 36 minutes.  I think Ty Lawson's value is actually less then the 6th overall pick.  because you never know what that pick could turn into. The pick could be superstar for all we know.  To balance out the uncertainty I think you have to add Chandler.     Additionally I think Nick Stauskas is severely underrated. Dude had a bad shooting year, but he was the eighth overall pick in a pretty deep draft. He still might become something special."
denvernuggets,388k41,eg14000,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:26:23 2015 UTC,"He can slot at the 2 or the 3, and he seems like he fits the style of offense we'll want to play, while being a more potent offensive threat. That's about it, I haven't seen either play much.  Ty's value may be less than the #6 pick, but I don't think it's too much less. Taking on bad contract while giving up some combination of Lauvergne, Foye, and Green should be enough enough in my estimation. There's no sense in a adding Chandler, who could fetch an ""Afflalo for 1st + someone like Barton"" trade on his own.   Plus, if someone's trading a proven player for a draft pick that could hit or miss, how does that work in favor of one team or another? I guess the higher the lotto pick the lower the risk, but it's still trading a proven commodity for an unproven one. I just don't see how a perceived uncertainty would warrant a player like Wilson Chandler.  As for Stauskas, I don't know. I don't see him becoming anything better than a decent, but I haven't seen him play much either. And like you said, lotto pick in a deep draft doesn't necessarily mean anything."
denvernuggets,388k41,with2nns,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:29:36 2015 UTC,Streaky shooting is not the style of play I wanna play. And just because a player can play both the 2 and the 3 doesn't make him more valuable than any other player. Most wing players can change between the two on the three.  You make fair points on the Ty Lawson trade. However I suggest looking at it from the point of view of a Kings fan. They want as much value as possible for their 6 pick and Nick sauce.  If that pick turns into a superstar they don't want to feel stupid about it. If we don't throw in Chandler they're going to feel stupid about it. Does that make sense? I'm saying the Kings a No Deal if Chandler isn't in the trade.  The Nuggets might be giving up too much but that's just comes with the territory of making a trade.  People thought the Rockets give up too much when they got James Harden. Turns out they didn't.
denvernuggets,388k41,eg14000,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:09:53 2015 UTC,"Why do say Hezonja is streaky? It's probably hard to quantify streakiness, but his per 36 #'s stack up pretty good against Felipe Reyes and Rudy Fernandez. Plus he's a 20 year old playing in the 2nd most competitive league in the world.  As for Ty, I think the trade for the #6 pick I posed is fair and doable, and maybe Denver and Sacramento will think the Ty, Chandler for #6 + Stauskas is fair and doable, but i'm indifferent towards Sauce Castillo, so I can't really agree."
denvernuggets,388k41,with2nns,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:33:40 2015 UTC,"Zach Lowe is reporting Lawson for IT is being heavily considered by Boston.  Would I rather Isaiah Thomas than the sixth pick? Yes, yes I would. But that's just me."

I'm not keen on Mudiay since he'd likely take a while to develop and if we miss Russell (which we would even if we landed the 6th) I don't think there will be much of a net gain by trading Ty for the 6th.  I'd definitely take Thomas in exchange since he'd be a plug-and-play piece. Put him next to Harris or Johnson and I'd be extremely happy.  Again, that's just my preference."

denvernuggets,380n17,eg14000,2,Mon Jun 1 07:49:54 2015 UTC,"that's a pretty good pick up yeah, but you know what he actually kind of reminds me of brad miller. oh yeah and maybe we should try to pick up mudiay so we can rekindle that partnership during the hoops summit lol"
denvernuggets,380n17,bettycrockerpot,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:51:39 2015 UTC,"I guess it's time for some debate. I think Mudiay is the most obvious bust in this draft. I remember getting really hyped about a guy named Marcus Williams. He averaged Lebron James type numbers in the CBA. The man didn't even make the roster, got beat out by Alonzo Gee.  No player that only average 18 points in China will ever be an NBA star."
denvernuggets,380n17,eg14000,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:03:14 2015 UTC,"well to be fair, he was selected in the second round. and i think most of mudiay's attractiveness is based on potential more than anything else  edit: also i think one of the more obvious busts in this draft is porzingis"
denvernuggets,380n17,bettycrockerpot,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:11:36 2015 UTC,"At first I thought Portingis was going to be a bust to. But after a while I realized that he's not going to be. He's athletic and he can shoot, that's unheard of in a big man. the only real reason everyone thinks he's going to be a bust is that he is European. I just get the feeling that this guy is different than all the other European big men.  (Portingis would probably average 25 points in China)"
denvernuggets,380n17,eg14000,5,Mon Jun 1 08:55:50 2015 UTC,To my knowledge Jokic has the potential of a lottery pick. Could be anything between a role player or a star. That's all I really know.
denvernuggets,380n17,eg14000,3,Sun May 31 23:59:52 2015 UTC,A lotto pick? I had no idea he was that highly touted.
denvernuggets,380n17,eg14000,5,Mon Jun 1 00:09:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if he came out this year he could easily be a top 15 pick. That's what being a MVP gets you."
denvernuggets,380n17,eg14000,6,Mon Jun 1 00:13:02 2015 UTC,he won the same award as the European small forward who was drafted by the 76 Sixers 10th last year.
denvernuggets,380n17,phatlever,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:14:22 2015 UTC,What position is he going to play?
denvernuggets,380n17,eg14000,3,Mon Jun 1 03:59:36 2015 UTC,Pf/C
denvernuggets,380g2l,jhurley98,5,Sun May 31 22:55:35 2015 UTC,I don't think it's realistic. None of our players fit the triangle. And I don't really want to trade with the Knicks anyway.
denvernuggets,380g2l,eg14000,1 point,Sun May 31 23:25:53 2015 UTC,"They don't, but if the Knicks want to get better quick maybe they'll bite. Plus there's the Melo connection."
denvernuggets,380g2l,with2nns,2,Mon Jun 1 00:14:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but we have the option to swap picks with them next year so anything that makes them better is bad for the nuggets."
denvernuggets,380g2l,TriceraScotts,2,Mon Jun 1 05:47:59 2015 UTC,If we suck next year it's a moot point.
denvernuggets,380g2l,Kawnar,4,Mon Jun 1 07:01:28 2015 UTC,"If the nuggets make a deal with the Knicks before the next draft lottery, I will drive to Kroenke's house and punch him right in his stupid face."
denvernuggets,380g2l,TriceraScotts,2,Mon Jun 1 05:49:31 2015 UTC,I'd give up Faried and the 7th.. I think that'd work for us/them.
denvernuggets,380g2l,Kawnar,0,Sun May 31 23:03:34 2015 UTC,"The value seems pretty fair. I don't know if they'd want want Faried, especially given his contract. Maybe Ty and the 7th, but then more would have to come back to us."
denvernuggets,380g2l,with2nns,1 point,Sun May 31 23:55:12 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't see it happening.  If anything, I think LA might trade down in order to land Melo and pair him with Kobe, then potentially make a run at Rondo in FA."
denvernuggets,380g2l,pairidaeza,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:15:42 2015 UTC,"to land Melo and pair him with Kobe,   Aw, then I would have to hate Melo. I've decided I don't hate him since the Nuggets got good return for him and he was better here anyway, but I can't be okay with anything involving the Lakers."
denvernuggets,380g2l,aatencio91,2,Mon Jun 1 15:42:00 2015 UTC,That's just what I've heard. I'd hate it as well.
denvernuggets,380g2l,pairidaeza,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:15:36 2015 UTC,I think you just let them reach if they want. It only helps us.
denvernuggets,380g2l,rvhack,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:36:30 2015 UTC,"yes, yes we can. my original comment was close minded. All we have to do is trade the 7th and two protected first round picks (from Memphis and Portland) for the 4th pick.  Guaranteeing us either Okafor Townes, Russell, or Portingis.  it's a lot to give up, but if we think any of these guys can become superstars we should do it."
denvernuggets,37yyow,aatencio91,18,Sun May 31 16:20:10 2015 UTC,I'm not mad at him. He wanted to leave. We got what I would consider a fair deal for him and he ended up where he wanted to be. It's unfair to ask a player to stay just because I like him and as I type this I realize this is probably the mentality I need to have for ty.
denvernuggets,37yyow,rvhack,8,Sun May 31 16:56:10 2015 UTC,"I don't fault him for wanting to leave, but how he did it is why I dislike him so much. He would say how loyal he was to the Nuggets publicly and then hear after the fact how he demanded a trade.   Also, the fact that Denver had to trade Chauncey Billups as the sacrificial lamb to do it makes it worse. Classless and unprofessional.  Seeing his true colors in NY and playing on some terrible teams the last few years is karma for what he did here if you ask me.  Yeah, I'm still bitter."
denvernuggets,37yyow,drmeattornado,2,Mon Jun 1 00:32:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, getting rid of Chauncey in that deal really broke my heart.  Just felt wrong to do the local boy like that."
denvernuggets,37yyow,sleepydogg,2,Mon Jun 1 06:47:14 2015 UTC,"I couldn't disagree more - that he expressed loyalty to the public, while obviously expressing his true desires to the FO, is what enabled us to get such a big return on his trade.  Had he even hinted at wanting a trade, he would've torpedoed his trade value.  He couldn't have handled the press any better that year, imo, and he continued to play his ass off on the court - looking back, I have no qualms whatsoever with how Melo handled his exit."
denvernuggets,37yyow,tilla23,17,Tue Jun 2 01:58:35 2015 UTC,"I was more mad at Melo trade for taking Chauncey Billups away from us, then Melo actually leaving."
denvernuggets,37yyow,Super_DariO,5,Sun May 31 17:32:15 2015 UTC,"This, this 1000 times over. Chauncey might be working in the front office right now if he doesn't get traded."
denvernuggets,37yyow,spartan117echo,4,Mon Jun 1 00:14:50 2015 UTC,"Chauncey is back in town and has all but said that he wants to be a part of a front office on local radio within the last couple of months. He doesn't seem to harbor any ill will towards the Nuggets. If they ask him to join the FO (which could realistically happen if Tim Connelly gets fired in the next year or two), I think he'd do it in a heartbeat."
denvernuggets,37yyow,spartan117echo,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:52:07 2015 UTC,That's good! Unfortunately I live out of state so I don't hear the local buzz. I think Masai already being gone (since he pulled the trigger there) probably helps. Time heals all as well.
denvernuggets,37yyow,teensonacid,7,Mon Jun 1 21:41:50 2015 UTC,i think seeing him suffering through the current Knicks troubles is enough vindication for me. I wish he'd stayed though.
denvernuggets,37yyow,tebam,4,Sun May 31 20:56:07 2015 UTC,"I want to say I'm over it, but the break up still hurts."
denvernuggets,37yyow,eg14000,4,Sun May 31 17:30:34 2015 UTC,We won the Melo trade. The last three years we've been better than Knicks. In my opinion Melo is a good Player but not a player you can build a franchise around.
denvernuggets,37yyow,growedup,3,Sun May 31 23:29:19 2015 UTC,"I was just talking about this with my girlfriend! I'm not mad at him because he got exactly what he wanted, and the a Knicks suck."
denvernuggets,37yyow,pairidaeza,2,Sun May 31 20:08:20 2015 UTC,Your girl knows ball? (｡◕‿◕｡)
denvernuggets,37yyow,growedup,3,Mon Jun 1 03:34:45 2015 UTC,If your girl won't watch the Nuggets and talk pick and roll defense why are you even with her?
denvernuggets,37yyow,pairidaeza,3,Mon Jun 1 06:44:07 2015 UTC,Heh. Good point.   I'll have to mention that to her.
denvernuggets,37yyow,Icaro_Nova,3,Mon Jun 1 06:47:25 2015 UTC,It's been long enough that I don't care much anymore one way or the other. He's just another player to me.
denvernuggets,37yyow,Tskitishvili,2,Sun May 31 20:39:07 2015 UTC,"I think because we actually had some good seasons post-Melo, I'm not mad about it. If the Knicks were in the playoffs I'd probably root for them and Melo over most teams they'd play. I just hope they aren't good next year because we can swap picks with them."
denvernuggets,37yyow,Crambulance,2,Sun May 31 20:31:43 2015 UTC,It's always good to be able to say that Melo has done way more with the Nuggets than he has with the Knicks.
denvernuggets,37yyow,silverandblack,1 point,Sun May 31 23:43:23 2015 UTC,"I was in NYC a week ago talking about this. I flat out told this guy (Knicks fan) that we got Carmelo's best years, he agreed."
denvernuggets,37yyow,pairidaeza,2,Mon Jun 1 03:09:56 2015 UTC,"Hate the guy? Not really.  I think he's a good/great player, albeit limited. I don't know he can be the guy you win a championship with.  I would take him back in a heartbeat though, given the state of this team right now.  I also don't think winning is his number 1 priority."
denvernuggets,37yyow,chucho320,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:08:53 2015 UTC,Melo proved himself for a couple of seasons but he is not a team player. I am glad we got the equivalent back.
denvernuggets,37yyow,manimalplanet35,1 point,Sun May 31 19:51:12 2015 UTC,"I hated him at the time for demanding a trade but I think we definitely came out the other side of it all in a much better position.  I remember reading an article entitled ""The Assassination of the Denver Nuggets by the coward Carmelo Anthony"" [Link] and I think my fears were amplified. But when it was all said and done I was happy for him and happy for the Nuggets.  That said, I don't think he'd ever return and I think he'll languish in LA or make a dash for another big market, possibly LA."
denvernuggets,37yyow,Arrow218,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:37:33 2015 UTC,"We were on the verge of something legendary.  We were building around Melo and making the perfect complimentary team to his type of game.  We let him be the man and take all of the credit.  He started being a little girl and leaking that he wanted out and then denying it to the media.  Those are the worst.  He's proven that money matters over legacy and he just wants the money and the spotlight.  He could have went to Chicago this season and they'd almost certainly be in the Finals.  Yeah, he would have left $30 mil on the table, but he's already got more than enough money.  Hoisting that trophy should be number one priority, but it's not for Melo (or LaLa).  He would have more than made up that money in endorsements.  He deserves every losing season he toils in, and now he's on the other side of 30 and looking worse for wear.  When this contract is up and he's sitting on nothing but losses, he's going to be like Karl Malone and Gary Payton at the end of their careers, bandwagoning a potential winning team just to try to solidify his legacy.  I hope he clanks a game winner.  We might have came out on the better end of the trade, but we're not much better than the Knicks, and we're in just as much disarray.  In my opinion nobody won in that trade."
denvernuggets,37yd6k,BlindManBaldwin,5,Sun May 31 13:02:03 2015 UTC,"You joke, but do you think this would help out Denver's FA struggles? Would people still view Denver as a flyover city?"
denvernuggets,37yd6k,aatencio91,4,Sun May 31 16:14:01 2015 UTC,"It would be the equivalent of the Broncos signing Peyton Manning. Would automatically make us one of the top free agent destinations. Of course, it's probably a bit of a catch-22 because Durant wouldn't want to come here unless we were already a desirable destination. :-/"
denvernuggets,37yd6k,NUGGman,2,Sun May 31 21:30:30 2015 UTC,"I was referring to weed being legalized by the league, not Durant signing in Denver."
denvernuggets,37yd6k,aatencio91,3,Mon Jun 1 20:19:06 2015 UTC,If it did happen It would be pleasant to have FA draw. I'm not sure what needs to happen in terms of federal legality before the nba takes action. If the nba did this first I think it would be a big step for national legality but I doubt they're that adventurous.  Think of a guy like Kobe or Vince Carter rolling one up for the aching knees.
denvernuggets,37yd6k,rvhack,3,Sun May 31 16:37:30 2015 UTC,I actually think it would help get some free agents to come. Wouldn't care if it was a cow town if they get just go  to the 420 area code.
denvernuggets,37yd6k,with2nns,2,Sun May 31 16:57:02 2015 UTC,Eh. We'll have our pick of him or Lebron. And I'll take Lebron any day.
denvernuggets,37yd6k,NUGGman,2,Sun May 31 17:27:53 2015 UTC,I think Curry running and popping 3's could take better advantage of our altitude.
denvernuggets,37yd6k,with2nns,8,Sun May 31 21:38:47 2015 UTC,Might as well sign all 3 for the vet minimum and use the big bucks on a real superstar like Javale McGee.
denvernuggets,37yd6k,eg14000,1 point,Sun May 31 21:55:21 2015 UTC,"Kevin Durant couldn't do it publicly. he'd be viewed as a traitor, and a stupid player. Why would he want to be either one of those things?  But Lebron might come though."

Trade Kenneth Faried for something valuable. Sign Jeremy Lin.   P.S. I know people don't like Mike Dantoni however I just don't want to watch another year of boring basketball."

I agree with getting rid of him and Lawson, especially since they aren't happy with the organization. But it doesn't mean things can't change.

denvernuggets,37xhxw,eg14000,1 point,Sun May 31 15:39:57 2015 UTC,"This is more like a plan for 2020 than it is for 2016.  And why would you hire Dantoni and then trade Ty, who is perfect for Dantoni's system?"
denvernuggets,37v2fd,Markdanielng,5,Sat May 30 17:16:29 2015 UTC,There was a article posted yesterday that we aren't even interviewing D'Antoni.
denvernuggets,37v2fd,DtownAndOut,5,Sat May 30 19:12:51 2015 UTC,I think its just a better story line if Lin came to the Nuggets with Mike Dantoni. I mean who doesn't want to see Lin with Mike D'Antoni again. Was it all fluke? can he do it again? I for one want to find out. And if it all works out we become a good team. so yeah.
denvernuggets,37v2fd,eg14000,2,Sun May 31 11:50:49 2015 UTC,"As someone else pointed out, we haven't even interviewed him. No D'Antoni = No Lin."
denvernuggets,37v2fd,pairidaeza,6,Sun May 31 23:16:08 2015 UTC,No one here really wants Lin
denvernuggets,37v2fd,bo0ompow,18,Sat May 30 17:49:19 2015 UTC,I'd want him. Especially if Lawson is traded and we don't draft a PG.
denvernuggets,37v2fd,with2nns,3,Sat May 30 18:05:35 2015 UTC,"Surprised so many people here agree with you, judging by the upvotss. Why do you want Lin? I'd consider him a downgrade from Ty, unless we're looking to tank/clear some cap space for a big name player."
denvernuggets,37v2fd,Crinnle,9,Sat May 30 20:51:12 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming Ty is traded no matter what, in which case Lin would be a decent replacement considering how well he played under D'antoni."
denvernuggets,37v2fd,with2nns,6,Sat May 30 21:12:04 2015 UTC,"I think everyone agrees he is a downgrade from Ty. It really, really isn't looking like we will be able to keep ahold of him or like he wants to stay."

denvernuggets,37r2tx,aatencio91,3,Fri May 29 18:39:19 2015 UTC,"I do really like Johnson, but if we're shipping Ty off I think we're expecting a top 10 pick in return. What trade can you see happening where we can get a mid lotto pick for Payne? We'd have to be receiving young talent back in addition to that pick to make it worth it imo."
denvernuggets,37r2tx,The_NGUYENNER,2,Fri May 29 21:26:45 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know. I know very little about the NBA overall and almost nothing about teams' needs. I know that Houston needs a PG and has the 18th pick from New Orleans, so maybe sending Ty to Houston in exchange for the 18th pick and... Patrick Beverly? I don't know.  What would you consider a good trade? I'm not knowledgeable in this stuff at this point. I'm still learning a lot.  Also, if we were to get a top 10 in a Ty trade, who would you like to target and what pick do you think it'd be?"
denvernuggets,37r2tx,The_NGUYENNER,2,Fri May 29 21:32:45 2015 UTC,"It's all good man, you'll learn more and more as you go. Thinking up of crazy trade scenarios is fun even if they're not realistic since nobody really knows what can happen.  I definitely wouldn't do that Rockets trade though, I think Ty is worth a lot more than that. The most commonly talked about trade right now is Ty for Sac's #6 + fillers, which I'd be down for. George Karl coached Ty when he was here and has been saying he wants him, and it seems like a trade that both fan bases want, which is pretty rare.  If we do trade for a mid 1st round pick, I'd expect a young talent back... but I honestly can't think of a trade that would be enticing. I think the Nugs want a chance to swing for the fences if they're doing something as drastic as trading Ty away.  As for who I'd target, Mario Hezonja is my favorite prospect in our range. I also really like Stanley Johnson if Mario gets picked before, or Justise Winslow/D'Angelo Russell if they somehow (not happening) fall down to us."
denvernuggets,37r2tx,The_NGUYENNER,3,Fri May 29 22:04:41 2015 UTC,"So say they trade Ty away in exchange for the 6th. The fillers you mention are to even out money, correct? Also, what do the Nuggets do at PG if Ty leaves? Mudiay and Russell should both be gone by the 6th pick, right? Finally, if they take Hezonja at 6th, what's left for them needs-wise and who fits in at 7th?"
denvernuggets,37r2tx,The_NGUYENNER,3,Fri May 29 22:12:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah fillers to even out money, I think most common scenario is Carl Landry being the filler.  Personally my next step is trading one of the picks + Wilson to the Knicks for #4 and grabbing whichever PG falls. There's also the possibility that Mudiay falls to us at 6, although it's pretty unlikely.   In the situation that we trade Ty, and are unable to get Mudiay/Russell (although I would make sure everything is in place before I pull the trigger in the first place) I guess we would either look to the FA pool, look for another trade, or simply roll with Nelson + Green until our lotto pick next year."

denvernuggets,37onfz,growedup,4,Sat May 30 01:54:08 2015 UTC,"haven't even interviewed d'antoni..... wow  still not sure what some of the front office people do. i figured ""find and interview potential candidates for open positions"" would be at or near the top of the list.   nothing against hunt, he might've gotten the job anyway but this is just an embarrassingly lazy job by the front office."
denvernuggets,37onfz,ParadeShitter,8,Fri May 29 14:42:52 2015 UTC,"To be fair, D'antoni may not want to interview."
denvernuggets,37onfz,kipmix,4,Fri May 29 15:55:36 2015 UTC,i don't have all or any of the answers but i doubt that. i thought i read he was interested. he's certainly unemployed
denvernuggets,37onfz,ParadeShitter,3,Fri May 29 15:57:48 2015 UTC,I doubt it too but I usually take reports and rumors with grain of salt until something actually happens. Every report had Peyton not coming to Denver and it was everything but a lock that he was going to Tennessee.  Trust me I hate our front office and I wouldn't be surprised if our front office is the reason why D'antoni wouldn't want to come over.
denvernuggets,37onfz,kipmix,3,Fri May 29 16:03:48 2015 UTC,He's reportedly expressed interest in the job.
denvernuggets,37onfz,with2nns,5,Fri May 29 15:58:10 2015 UTC,It's possible that they don't think he's that good of a coach. His last couple jobs didn't end so well. Has anyone else been interviewing him?
denvernuggets,37onfz,tron777,1 point,Fri May 29 16:45:38 2015 UTC,it's possible but who are they interviewing then? you don't have to want a hire a guy to do the due diligence of interviewing qualified candidates. all the other teams have been pretty vocal about who they're looking at. what's denver hiding? i'm guessing they're hiding their own laziness/ineptitude.
denvernuggets,37onfz,ParadeShitter,2,Fri May 29 16:55:39 2015 UTC,"I say give him a shot, he did spend a couple years under George Karl so I'm sure this guy knows this team more than anybody right now."
denvernuggets,37onfz,Oshawut,2,Fri May 29 16:30:25 2015 UTC,Give it to Hunt and lets roll this Bitch up!!!!!
denvernuggets,37onfz,Nugforlife,2,Fri May 29 19:53:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's getting to be the point that you have to start getting ready for the draft, right?"

denvernuggets,37onfz,Nugforlife,2,Fri May 29 22:21:08 2015 UTC,"Sweet! It's really hard committing to season tickets when you don't know who the coach will be. I'm really hoping for Melvin Hunt. At this point, I prefer the devil I know to the one I don't."
denvernuggets,37onfz,NUGGman,1 point,Fri May 29 19:28:25 2015 UTC,"I don't like Melvin Hunt. I can see the team losing a lot of games under Melvin hunt. In my opinion Mike Dantoni is the man for the job. Just because he had a couple of bad years with the Lakers (who are even worse without him) doesn't make him a bad coach. The Lakers hired him at the wrong time, the personal did not fit his coaching style. Our personnel do.  If we hire Mike Dantoni we will make the playoffs. Don't forget the Nuggets are still the playoff team with the right coach."
denvernuggets,37onfz,eg14000,0,Wed Jun 3 05:12:41 2015 UTC,"I was hoping to hear that D'Antoni and Alvin Gentry would at least be interviewed. I figured part of why it was taking so long was because they wanted to interview Gentry.  I honestly wonder how much of a 'frontrunner"" Hunt is in the eyes of the FO, or if he's the frontrunner to the media/public simply because the Nuggets haven't interviewed D'Antoni and Gentry yet, waiting to interview all around the same time."
denvernuggets,37onfz,aatencio91,2,Fri May 29 16:21:39 2015 UTC,Gentry has just been hired by the Pelicans it looks like.
denvernuggets,37nj4y,NUGGman,37,Thu May 28 23:05:54 2015 UTC,"It hasn't, I'm still a bitter jerk, especially about Benedict Andre and to a lesser extent, Andrew Bogut. I recognize that they are a great team and were a great team back then, but I'm convinced we could have beat them. Obviously missing Gallo hurt, but a few more free-throws would have done wonders.   I also associate this playoff series with the downfall of the Nuggets I first became a fan of."
denvernuggets,37nj4y,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Thu May 28 23:17:40 2015 UTC,I appreciate your self deprecation of calling yourself a jerk. That's a good quality to have ;-)  I blame the loss on Gallo getting hurt. I would pay a ton of money to see a parallel universe where Gallo doesn't get hurt.
denvernuggets,37nj4y,The_NGUYENNER,2,Fri May 29 00:22:07 2015 UTC,me too... things would be completely different I feel. Losing in the first round was the first domino to this rollercoaster that has been the last 2 seasons.
denvernuggets,37nj4y,growedup,2,Fri May 29 16:18:29 2015 UTC,"I think the David Lee injury was the difference. They had to go small, and it worked."
denvernuggets,37nj4y,tron777,3,Sat May 30 04:33:39 2015 UTC,"Benedict Andre   Whatever you want to say about his off-court behavior, when he was on the court he was a professional.  He was easily the Nuggets best player in the series."
denvernuggets,37nj4y,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Fri May 29 15:46:40 2015 UTC,"Benedict Arnold was also a successful general.   There's no doubt that he helped keep us in some of those games, and was the most consistently good player for us that series. I still can't forgive him for his traitorous actions."
denvernuggets,37nj4y,tron777,3,Fri May 29 15:49:18 2015 UTC,"JR Smith is probably a better Benedict Arnold comp, personality wise.  Talented, mercurial, and he essentially went over to the British because of playing time."
denvernuggets,37nj4y,The_NGUYENNER,4,Fri May 29 16:09:41 2015 UTC,"eh, I don't ever think of JR as having betrayed us. I still love him.  Iggy can go burn in a fire though"
denvernuggets,37nj4y,tron777,3,Fri May 29 16:21:15 2015 UTC,One foot out the door during a playoff series.
denvernuggets,37nj4y,The_NGUYENNER,2,Fri May 29 16:33:06 2015 UTC,"idk... that article is shining a HUGELY negative light on it... It honestly seems like they're actively trying to attack him or something.  This is the article that it got the quotes from. Much more balanced perspective IMO. I don't see him bitching that much, just frustrated that the team apparently didn't care as much as he thought they would."
denvernuggets,37nj4y,The_NGUYENNER,1 point,Fri May 29 17:11:10 2015 UTC,As opposed to the articles that have been written about Iguodala?
denvernuggets,37nj4y,tron777,2,Fri May 29 18:05:41 2015 UTC,"idk what articles you're talking about, I'm just speaking from my opinion. And my opinion is that JR's actions are farrr more forgivable than Iggy's, who not only hung out with, but ""snitched us out"" to our playoff opponents. Then joined them for less money + years.  Never really seen anything like that happen before."
denvernuggets,37nj4y,The_NGUYENNER,0,Fri May 29 18:26:14 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying both players had negative articles written about them. You chose to question the J.R. Smith articles, but not the Iguodala articles.   You really think he ""snitched us out""? So you think we WERE playing cheap and he ratted on us? That sounds pretty ridiculous to me. First of all, we weren't playing cheap so there's nothing to rat out. Secondly, the ""hanging out"" he did with them is a common thing for NBA players (attending the chapel prayer on the floor before the game).  I've never seen any player who was a free agent resign with a team that just fired the coach of the year and GM of the year, have you? There's no way I would have stayed here if I were him.   J.R. Smith, on the other hand was a constant problem for the coach and a poor leader and he left to go to a worse team (hardly possible).  We all have our opinions. Unfortunately, we only seem to question articles that are contrary to the opinions we already have. Confirmation Bias is a bitch."
denvernuggets,37nj4y,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Fri May 29 18:36:07 2015 UTC,"The comments on the Post article aren't as forgiving.  Watching the series myself I remember thinking JR was firing up ""fuck you, George"" shots and not playing any defense at all. I'm utterly convinced he gave up on the team during the playoffs and that, to me, is unforgivable."
denvernuggets,37nj4y,tron777,1 point,Fri May 29 18:39:53 2015 UTC,"huh, I guess it's been a while but I don't seem to remember thinking that. That, to me, has always been JR ever since he's gotten here. I can see your side definitely, I just didn't like that first article."
denvernuggets,37nj4y,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Fri May 29 18:53:35 2015 UTC,I think an analysis of the similarities between our club and major figures in the Revolutionary War is in order.
denvernuggets,37nj4y,tron777,2,Fri May 29 16:12:52 2015 UTC,"Well, Karl reminds me of Ben Franklin but it's pretty hard to figure out who Washington will be until we, you know, actually win the war. This offseason feels a lot like Valley Forge so far."
denvernuggets,37nj4y,tebam,2,Fri May 29 16:26:48 2015 UTC,"Andre Miller would be Paul Revere, no? He was really the first warning sign that something wasn't right with the new regime. While I still don't think he acted professionally, I feel bad for blindly taking the organization's side on that one."
denvernuggets,37nj4y,Tskitishvili,2,Fri May 29 16:33:26 2015 UTC,The Shaw tenure is the Intolerable Acts.  The little mutiny last year was the Boston Tea Party.
denvernuggets,37nj4y,Crambulance,21,Fri May 29 16:41:24 2015 UTC,"I hate GS. I hate Klay, I hate Lee, I hate Green, I hate Barnes, I hate curry and I really fucking hate Igoudala. I hate rooting for lebron but I want to JR and Mozzy get a ring. If GS wins I'm going to have an aneurism. I don't think I've ever hated a team more than I hate the Warriors haha. I'm unbelievable bitter about that play off series, and I always will be."
denvernuggets,37nj4y,Foreverwite,8,Fri May 29 00:47:48 2015 UTC,"Yup. 100% agree. I've never hated a team in any sport more than I hate the Warriors now. The only person I'm neutral with regarding that team is Kerr, he just seems like a nice guy and was my favourite commentator. I'm all in on Mozzy winning a title and hopefully destroying Bogut in the process."
denvernuggets,37nj4y,tebam,6,Fri May 29 03:33:32 2015 UTC,Samesies
denvernuggets,37nj4y,tron777,5,Fri May 29 01:09:35 2015 UTC,Same here.  Also watching them lose to the spurs that year was one of the most satisfying things I've ever seen.
denvernuggets,37nj4y,Wtfitzchris,2,Fri May 29 02:01:21 2015 UTC,Watching their dreams get crushed in the finals will make my soul happy.
denvernuggets,37nj4y,corybyu,2,Fri May 29 03:07:12 2015 UTC,I hate rooting for lebron but I want to JR and Mozzy get a ring.   You lost me there.
denvernuggets,37nj4y,Crinnle,9,Fri May 29 16:02:54 2015 UTC,"I still dislike Iggy and Bogut, but I've got nothing against the rest of the team.  I'm pulling for them to win against Cleveland."
denvernuggets,37nj4y,bettycrockerpot,4,Thu May 28 23:38:37 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, would still rather root against LeBron, even though I can't stand Iggy now either."
denvernuggets,37nj4y,f0xpuppy,9,Fri May 29 00:25:19 2015 UTC,Still bitter. At least we can say we hated GS before it was cool.
denvernuggets,37nj4y,Rage_Rocket,8,Fri May 29 02:31:51 2015 UTC,"I still hate them, that loss ruined Denver and you can say ""what was gsw supposed to do? Lose?"" But I still don't care, I hate them and forever will until Denver beats them 10 consecutive years in the playoffs and steals their key players"
denvernuggets,37nj4y,Rage_Rocket,6,Fri May 29 00:38:23 2015 UTC,"Like many here I've felt nothing but disgust at the warriors since that playoff series. It was more of their players and coach whining about everything despite being up the entire series. Hate Iggy especially the rat bastard.  I still love Bogut though. Gotta represent the fellow aussie.   That said, I hope LeBron and his band of ruffians shatter their dreams. Actually looking forward to it. I'd love to see Moz and JR become champions, especially without Melo."
denvernuggets,37nj4y,sleepydogg,4,Fri May 29 05:51:53 2015 UTC,"I actually grew to like Bogut during that series. He had the grittiness the Nuggets lacked and was the difference in the series. I'm still a bit bitter about it, though. I don't really care about the Finals, now. I just kind of want Mozgov to prosper."
denvernuggets,37nj4y,dannokun,4,Fri May 29 01:16:22 2015 UTC,You're not allowed to like Bogut  ;-) just kidding
denvernuggets,37nj4y,kthxtyler,2,Fri May 29 01:22:02 2015 UTC,I know. I feel bad about it. I hated him so much during the series but he was the difference maker. Sometimes I fantasize about what would've happened if Javale had just punched him when he told him to. haha
denvernuggets,37nj4y,Llama_Sandwich,3,Fri May 29 11:47:33 2015 UTC,"Eh. In hindsight, we got beat by the better team, we just didn't know it at the time.  I still hate two-faced Andre and cheap-ass Bogut, but my biggest object of hatred, Marc Jackson, is gone.    Honestly I'm just happy that a new team is going to win the championship this year.  I'm sick of the same 5 teams winning every year."
denvernuggets,37nj4y,OddEye,2,Fri May 29 02:43:40 2015 UTC,"I don't remember, how is Andrew Bogut involved?"
denvernuggets,37nj4y,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Fri May 29 00:10:29 2015 UTC,Bogut played then and plays now. I have hated him ever since because it was a very chippy series and I felt Bogut was dishing out a lot of dirty play highlighted by the play he tossed Faried as seen here
denvernuggets,37nj4y,followthelawson,2,Fri May 29 00:18:16 2015 UTC,I'd say bitter. I'd also say disappointed in the Nuggets as well. The blame isn't solely on the Warriors winning...it was also on the Nuggets losing. Gallo not plying was a serious blow. I want Cleveland to sweep them.
denvernuggets,37nj4y,eg14000,2,Fri May 29 02:06:00 2015 UTC,I dislike Bogut and Andre but actually like the Warriors as a team. I want them to win the championship. I don't care if it sound traitorous.
denvernuggets,37nj4y,rexgal,2,Fri May 29 03:59:04 2015 UTC,"My mindset's still the same. Even with the Gallo injury, Nuggets should've won.   Games 1 and 2, Nuggets played like they expected it to be a cakewalk. George Karl should've let McGee loose since Koufos obviously wasn't going to be a factor. Andre Miller seemed to try to play hero ball after hitting the Game 1 winner. Corey Brewer shouldn't have kept jacking up 3's like he's Ray Allen.  Even after all that, it took some insane shooting from Curry and the Warriors to beat the Nuggets. Nuggets simply underestimated their opponent."
denvernuggets,37nj4y,eathbau,1 point,Fri May 29 06:00:15 2015 UTC,"McGee not getting his first start until midway through the playoff series, poor free throws, and bad luck are really what lost us that series IMO. The Warriors just happened to shoot out of their minds, and there wasn't anything we could do about it. Still a great series, I really miss being in the playoffs :("
denvernuggets,37nac9,JMadFour,7,Thu May 28 21:59:22 2015 UTC,"We hired the wrong coach, he didn't want to run...fired. We are trying to find the right coach but it might be Asst. Melvin Hunt. Ty Lawson wants to play with winners and tweeted as much, now all of us fans are mad. Danillo is finally getting back to form. We also have a new awesome small forward who's name I cannot pronounce much less write but he is really good. Faried might want to leave but we are not sure. Those are our assets. We have the 7th pick in the draft."

denvernuggets,37nac9,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu May 28 22:49:33 2015 UTC,Really? You honestly don't think Lawson is an asshole? I am actually asking. I am curious.
denvernuggets,37nac9,silverandblack,2,Fri May 29 02:30:41 2015 UTC,"No, I don't. Has he acted unprofessionally this season? Totally. I still believe him when he says he cares about this city and this team."
denvernuggets,37nac9,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Fri May 29 02:33:45 2015 UTC,"While the fans treat Lawson great, the team hasn't and he doesn't feel respected in an organization that doesn't seem to value performance as highly as he would like."
denvernuggets,37nac9,Corrupted_Engineer,8,Sat May 30 07:54:52 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the club!  The Nuggets have a rich history, dating all the way back to the American Basketball Association, of which only four teams are still in the NBA. Until the 2013-14 season, the Nuggets had played well enough to reach the playoffs in 9 seasons straight, thanks to players such as Carmelo Anthony, Chauncey Billups, and Ty Lawson, as well as head coach George Karl. Unfortunately, most of those playoff appearances ended in the first round, which led the Nuggets to letting go George Karl and hiring rookie coach Brian Shaw.  While Shaw is clearly a good man and knowledge about basketball, he failed her as Head Coach, leading to our worst two seasons in a decade. Part of this is the Front Office's fault, who consist of GM Tim Connelly and Owner/President Josh Kroenke. They kept much of the same roster, will switching the philosophy of fast play to that of slow and fundamental. Shaw still was not able to properly coach, and led to half the team quitting on him last season. Asst. coach Melvin Hunt took over, and he's a front runner for the head coaching job next season.   Since we play at such a high altitude, most of our teams have utilized a fast and aggressive playstyle that intends to wear down your opponents. As of right now, the club has recommitted itself to the ""run-and-gun"" style.   Another commitment they have made is to be aggressive in the off season, whether through trades, the draft, or free agency. We have the 7th pick, but that could change at the drop of a hat. You can read all about the draft pick prospects and discussion on whether they will fit our team here.  Looking at the calendar, we have the draft on Thursday, June 25th, the start of Summer League (where we send our rookies and prospects to play in a tournament) from July 10-20, with the preseason starting in early October.   I think that covers it! If you ever have any questions, always feel free to hit me or the community up!"
denvernuggets,37nac9,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu May 28 23:02:58 2015 UTC,"Great right up, thanks!"
denvernuggets,37nac9,fry_1,2,Fri May 29 21:00:42 2015 UTC,You are the best.
denvernuggets,37nac9,growedup,3,Sat May 30 01:57:07 2015 UTC,"A few years ago we had our best season ever, but lost our best player to an ACL injury (Gallo) that took him nearly 2 years to recover. We lost that year in the first round of the playoffs to a team that is now the best team in the NBA and shoots 3 pointers better than anyone ever has before (our team also happened to defend 3 point shots as bad as anyone ever has before).   The loudest fans had a hissy fit about making the playoffs 10 years in a row but only making it past the first round a couple times and wanted to see heads roll. Josh Kroenke (our Owner and ""Decider"") decided it was a good time to get rid of the guys who had been getting credit for the team's success (Coach of the Year and General Manager of the Year) so he could get the credit for the inevitable easy road of continuing that success, and vowed to stop the running philosophy that had been employed (taking advantage of our natural advantage of thin air) in favor of a slower tempo with set plays.  We went on to vet the possible coaches and everyone agreed that Brian Shaw would be a great hire because of all of his experience on successful teams as a player along with the success of the Pacers, who he was an assistant coach for. He had ties to the most successful coach of our lifetime, and no doubt would bring some of that success with him.  Unfortunately, Gallinari's injury took a long time to heal (2 years almost) and the players had a hard time adjusting to Brian Shaw's philosophy. The defensive play improved, but the losses piled up. Denver was no longer the team known for having the fastest pace and highest scoring of the past decade.   Year 1 for Shaw was disappointing for everyone, but was just chalked up to a transition year and to be expected (it was one of the reasons given by Kronke for letting Karl go a year before his contract was up). Year 2 promised to be competitive and more successful with the return of Galinari and Arron Afflalo. Unfortunately, it took Danillo most of the year to return to his previous form and the team continued to lose and didn't seem to be building anything but resentment for one another. After All-star break the Nuggets reached their breaking point and closed the Shaw chapter, having assistant coach under Shaw and Karl, Melvin Hunt take over. The team had a new energy and returned to some of the fast break high scoring success of the past the rest of the season. It was a stark contrast from the team counting down the days until the end of the season with Shaw as coach, to playing hard and appearing to love the game after Hunt took over.  Afflalo was also traded for a first round pick and a relatively unknown player named Will Barton, after Afflalo indicated he was unhappy with the situation on the team and wanted a chance to compete for a championship. Barton proved to be a fan favorite with his effort and love for the game. Many say he reminds them of Corey Brewer, the spark plug that often ignited the 2012 team that had so much success.   Pretty much everyone loves Barton and Gallinari. Kenneth Faried and Ty Lawson have fallen out of favor with half of the fans recently.   There's more, but I'm tired of writing now :-)"
denvernuggets,37nac9,NUGGman,2,Thu May 28 23:39:31 2015 UTC,"Shaw sounds like they tried to fit a Square Peg into a Round Hole. Beyond his Offensive Philosophy not fitting, I wonder what was it about Shaw that the players didn't like, that having Hunt made such a difference in how they played."
denvernuggets,37nac9,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Fri May 29 01:01:53 2015 UTC,"Shaw treated the players like kids at times. It's also well known that his top asst, Lester Connor, talked down to the players all the time."
denvernuggets,37nac9,growedup,2,Fri May 29 02:36:44 2015 UTC,"I loved listening to Coach Connor talk during halftime. My judge of character for dudes I don't know is ""Would I enjoy having a drink with him?""  and I bet Coach Connor would be a blast."

There's a post on the front page of /r/nba right now with a quote from Thibbs (paraphrasing) ""if you're going to play good, you'll get minutes if not, you won't."" I know I butchered that, but Thibbs isn't about giving young guys minutes to develop. The article details it much better than I can.  I mean, look up Dougie McBucket's stats this year. The Bulls traded up for that pick, from us no less, but he still barely played. Jimmy Butler lead the league in minutes this year, and two years about Louol Deng lead the league in minutes. He plays dudes give minutes.  Edit: were like $6 mil from the salary cap next year right now (including two team options, so at best ~$9ish mil), with no deals made, so picking up Monroe is gonna be hard. Especially on a team that already has 3 pf's on the roster and only 1 that can maybe get dealt during the off-season (Kenneth)"
denvernuggets,37m17k,TriceraScotts,2,Fri May 29 05:22:48 2015 UTC,well if we trade ty lawson and faried we open up a lot of space as i suggested
denvernuggets,37m17k,vrock627,1 point,Fri May 29 06:37:51 2015 UTC,Ty Lawson and Wilson Chandler are not worth what Russell could become. This is logic. Nuggets fans (I'm talking to myself here too) understand we are NOT getting DeAngelo Russell no matter what we trade.
denvernuggets,37m17k,eg14000,1 point,Sun May 31 11:56:51 2015 UTC,dream scenario
denvernuggets,37m17k,vrock627,3,Sun May 31 16:46:15 2015 UTC,The nuggets would love to sign thibs. He's regarded as a top 3 coach in the nba... the question is would thibs even consider us with teams like the pelicans looking for a new coach.
denvernuggets,37m17k,Orangeskill,3,Thu May 28 19:53:31 2015 UTC,Was coming to ask you guys this very question.
denvernuggets,37m17k,JMadFour,2,Thu May 28 21:54:51 2015 UTC,Your thoughts?
denvernuggets,37m17k,JMadFour,3,Fri May 29 00:51:01 2015 UTC,"I dont know enough about Thibs, really. I only really started caring about BBall again this year.  From what I read, Thibs has a reputation for running his players into the ground, not using his bench enough, and the Bulls HAVE had a lot of injuries. Doesn't sound like a good fit for a young team that need lots of development.  But then again, DRose was out..a LOT...and the Bulls had a lot of other nagging injuries...and Thibs still won. Probably didnt get as far as he could have with a healthier team though.  Beyond that...The Nuggets want to RUN, right? Thats what they are/were known for?  Can/Will Thibs coach that type of system?"
denvernuggets,37m17k,kmarti4,1 point,Fri May 29 00:57:09 2015 UTC,Being a nuggets fan In  chicago your assessment is pretty much spot on. He refuses to play rookies or trust them in any pressure situations. He didn't give McDermott much of a chance this year and mirotic who played well in the regular season didn't see that many minutes in the playoffs. Due to his defense I believe. He also plays his players ALOT of minutes. Runs them into the ground because they are his trust guys. I don't see it fitting in Denver.  While I would like to see the d in Denver and he could make them a better defensive team I don't see it working. We have the advantage of the altitude and I think the nuggets do themselves a disservice if they don't use it.
denvernuggets,37m17k,chucho320,4,Sat May 30 02:01:22 2015 UTC,I say we pursue the hell out of him.
denvernuggets,37m17k,nickagain,1 point,Thu May 28 17:22:25 2015 UTC,I agree. I say if he's interested in Denver he'll be open to adapting his system. Just because you play tough defense it doesn't mean you can't push the tempo.
denvernuggets,37m17k,concussed_cowboy,2,Fri May 29 15:57:24 2015 UTC,At least 10X better option than D'Antoni and 25X better than Hunt.
denvernuggets,37m17k,JMadFour,2,Sat May 30 16:50:23 2015 UTC,"I think the only way Thibodeau is a good hire for Denver, is if they commit to a full rebuild, and then build the team personnel from scratch, to fit Thibodeau's philosophy."
denvernuggets,37m17k,aatencio91,1 point,Sun May 31 07:06:10 2015 UTC,"He turned around the Bulls a fair bit. When he took over they were awful and now they're the Bulls again. If Orlando's Scott Skiles thing was a smokescreen, Denver doesn't have a shot at Thibs, but I say it's at least worth trying. He could bring some respectability to the franchise just like Karl did years ago."
denvernuggets,37m17k,silverandblack,4,Thu May 28 16:40:33 2015 UTC,"Thibs is a finisher, not a developer. He lacks patience. No."
denvernuggets,37m17k,vrock627,3,Thu May 28 19:46:05 2015 UTC,thibs is a GREAT developer in my opinion
denvernuggets,37llgp,tron777,2,Thu May 28 14:48:55 2015 UTC,"This is published by Draftexpress but it's some of the guys from the APBR message boards, who are on the cutting edge of data driven analysis (at least the kind that's public).  Only US college players here so no Hezonja, Porzingis, Mudiay included on these lists.  Last year's list did have some models that gauged international players and had Jokic and Nurkic finishing 6 and 7 respectively in the composite rankings."
denvernuggets,37iiw1,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Wed May 27 21:55:04 2015 UTC,Only in spurts. I don't think Gallo can defend 4s for a long period and having a size mismatch at the 3 is big.
denvernuggets,37iiw1,eathbau,2,Wed May 27 22:58:39 2015 UTC,That and rebounding becomes a problem.
denvernuggets,37iiw1,tron777,3,Thu May 28 14:25:05 2015 UTC,"I agree, this makes sense. We still need another big if we are going to match what the Cavs did this year. If this is the plan then we can settle for Hunt."
denvernuggets,37iiw1,silverandblack,2,Wed May 27 22:48:03 2015 UTC,Having him step in for a more traditional 4 in times of offensive sounds fine to me.
denvernuggets,37iiw1,rvhack,1 point,Thu May 28 16:06:01 2015 UTC,Isn't that what he's been doing for the whole second half of the season?
denvernuggets,37iiw1,rvhack,2,Thu May 28 16:08:49 2015 UTC,Yeah. I think it works. He's just about all you could ask for in a 3 being put out as a stretch 4
denvernuggets,37iiw1,bettycrockerpot,1 point,Thu May 28 16:20:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed. While he is under-weight for the 4 position which limits him defensively, his size allows him to at least compete with the big 4s. I also think that having him and Chandler on the court at the same time is a nightmare matchup for a lot of teams."
denvernuggets,37hcom,aatencio91,5,Wed May 27 17:18:06 2015 UTC,They got Chauncey and Iguodala in trades.  I'm not 100% but they may have extended/resigned Chauncey(before he eventually was traded also).  A big part of that was Denver probably being his hometown.  All of this only makes a better case for your big name free agents have always ignored Denver point though.
denvernuggets,37hcom,LanDloyd,5,Wed May 27 18:05:45 2015 UTC,"denver isn't a strong enough basketball market to be playing with people's emotions imo. this roster, as is (if they stay healthy), can most certainly compete for the 8th seed. you purposely lose games and show no hope for the future you seriously jeopardize any chance at a short-term build imo.   free agents already aren't ""preferring"" denver as a destination. you take away any bit of the fan support left and it'll be even harder to lure talent/interest to the team without overpaying (and this FO seems unlikely to overpay). you tank now and you risk the chance of making a quick fix into a long term rebuild. the nuggets already have more than enough money to play with after this season. i see no reason they just go down the ""we're going to lose games just because"" path.   the attendance/interest is already very poor. outside of trading away all your valuable pieces there's very little chance denver is going to get a top 3 pick with this roster. i'm just very hesitant to ever result to a culture of losing."
denvernuggets,37hcom,ParadeShitter,3,Wed May 27 21:26:02 2015 UTC,"If Ty and Faried are traded on draft day I think it's safe to say we'll be tanking. If not I'd wager we'll hire a head coach, draft a wing at #7, overpay a tier 2 free agent, and bet on the Knicks' swap working out.  Also, in regards to the head coaching search, we could just be waiting for the playoffs to end to interview Warriors' assistant Alvin Gentry."
denvernuggets,37hcom,with2nns,2,Wed May 27 19:27:32 2015 UTC,"we could just be waiting for the playoffs to end to interview Warriors' assistant Alvin Gentry.   While I hope that's true, I've read that the Pelicans have already interviewed him."
denvernuggets,37hcom,with2nns,3,Wed May 27 19:29:59 2015 UTC,"Apparently that was between the Grizzlies/Rockets series. He hasn't had a day off since, we could very well be next."
denvernuggets,37hcom,chucho320,3,Wed May 27 19:48:51 2015 UTC,Cool. Fingers crossed!
denvernuggets,37hcom,silverandblack,3,Wed May 27 19:51:32 2015 UTC,"While I don't think we'll purposely tank, we don't have the direction or front office or talent heart to get us on the winning track.  The #7 pick isn't going to be much of a difference maker, especially if we cross the pond again and bring in Hezonja.  So yes, I believe we'll tank, but it will be inadvertently at first.  Just like it was this past season.  And, like last season, we won't be all in until it's too late to make a difference."
denvernuggets,37hcom,NUGGman,3,Wed May 27 21:03:50 2015 UTC,This. I agree with this 100%.
denvernuggets,37hcom,pairidaeza,3,Wed May 27 23:25:23 2015 UTC,"Your last point is the best point. It makes no sense to tank when we can swap picks with New York. Also, losing ticket sales isn't a reason to tank, in my opinion. I think having strong ticket sales regardless of performance would be a reason to tank (like the Rockies)"
denvernuggets,37h9cm,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Wed May 27 16:56:04 2015 UTC,"I like him.... but do we really need another big man prospect?? I think not, but the potential is definitely intriguing. Especially nowadays with so many switches being forced on defense.  EDIT: Bonus Vid"
denvernuggets,37h9cm,The_NGUYENNER,3,Wed May 27 17:04:44 2015 UTC,"I think his college experience is definitely a bonus too- he could have just joined the draft a few years ago, but didn't."
denvernuggets,37h9cm,fuggingolliwog,2,Wed May 27 17:08:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, why not just play super big w/ five tall guys that can run and guard the perimeter?"
denvernuggets,37h9cm,aatencio91,3,Mon Jun 1 23:48:03 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be upset if the Nuggets picked him, but I don't believe they need him. They're stacked at the position unless they trade Faried, Nurkic seems very promising entering just his second year in the NBA, and Lauvergne and Jokic are both young guys who show promise.  Stanley Johnson and Justise Winslow are still my favorites."
denvernuggets,37h9cm,THECHUNGAWANGA,2,Wed May 27 18:37:18 2015 UTC,He's a great prospect and I like his potential on defense I just don't see the nuggets taking another center. Reminds me of javale a little bit with his athleticism and build
denvernuggets,37h9cm,silverandblack,2,Wed May 27 22:05:14 2015 UTC,"He is way more flexible than what we have. Imagine him and Danillo running a high pick and go. He is smarter than Javale, who is the exact physical match. And he will be cheap."
denvernuggets,37h9cm,Estevan58,1 point,Wed May 27 23:48:24 2015 UTC,"Still no love for Kaminsky? He can make outlet passes, great footwork not horrible speed for his position can shoot from mid and score down low on smaller defenders."
denvernuggets,37h9cm,Estevan58,2,Sat May 30 07:51:33 2015 UTC,He's probably next after Johnson and Porzingis
denvernuggets,37h9cm,Estevan58,1 point,Sat May 30 07:57:43 2015 UTC,"Why? Kaminsky in my opinion has so much more upside and potential, I of course could be wrong im no expert but its just my personal eye test."
denvernuggets,37h9cm,Estevan58,2,Sat May 30 08:14:28 2015 UTC,"Just because we've been following Draft Express' rankings, and we're only doing a top 10."
denvernuggets,37h9cm,eg14000,1 point,Sat May 30 08:28:43 2015 UTC,He's not even top 10? That's crazy I consider that a steal I may look foolish in the future but I think he's more nba ready than a lot of prospects in this draft.
denvernuggets,37h9cm,Estevan58,2,Sat May 30 08:39:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed, that's why I still want to highlight him."

denvernuggets,37dr38,broncoboots12,6,Tue May 26 21:56:35 2015 UTC,It will never work now..trade em both while they are worth something......make it a total rebuild...
denvernuggets,37dr38,Nugforlife,17,Tue May 26 22:34:40 2015 UTC,These are the type of players we want. They started out loyal and kept their mouths shut and let the guys in charge do their jobs. Those guys failed and destroyed the best team we've ever had. I'd be speaking up and letting them know I'm not here to lose and that EVERYBODY needs to do their job well for it to work; front office included.  Would we rather have players content with the past 2 seasons? I think not.
denvernuggets,37dr38,NUGGman,6,Tue May 26 22:07:23 2015 UTC,"agreed. i'm all up in that gm's office when nba 2k puts me on a crap roster with a front office unwilling to get better. totally relatable   but seriously, both parties are at fault here. ty for being a dummy and the front office for letting info leak about their ""expendable"" assets  i'm not sure what faried did but keep cashing them checks kid"
denvernuggets,37dr38,ParadeShitter,7,Wed May 27 05:53:57 2015 UTC,"I can see where you're coming from, but is a player that openly voices his desire to play for another team someone you want on your team? There's a better way to go about expressing your displeasure than asking for a trade or playing with a lack of effort."
denvernuggets,37dr38,tron777,10,Tue May 26 22:10:51 2015 UTC,but is a player that openly voices his desire to play for another team someone you want on your team?   Vague reports from unnamed sources is by no means 'openly voicing desire to play for another team.' We have no idea what went on in those conversations and players speaking frankly with their GM isn't really concerning to me. Nobody should be happy with where the team is right now and no veteran is interested in going through a rebuild. It seems you want these guys to just swallow it and bleed powder blue but I'm not going to expect undying loyalty from players we tried to trade a couple month's ago. We have nothing for these guys to want to buy into right now. Nothing. That's the worst part of the Shaw era is that we completely lost our sense of team. They'll all be mercenarys until/unless this organization pulls them together.
denvernuggets,37dr38,tron777,3,Tue May 26 22:29:10 2015 UTC,"Have you seen the infamous instagram post where Ty said he wished he played for the Mavericks? Although it could be interpreted a number of ways, my personal interpretation was that Ty wants out of Denver."
denvernuggets,37dr38,NUGGman,5,Tue May 26 22:31:36 2015 UTC,Answering a hypothetical is pretty mild compared to the front office trying to trade him since the start of the year. Can't expect absolute unquestioning loyalty when you have a guy on the trading block.
denvernuggets,37dr38,NUGGman,3,Tue May 26 22:40:35 2015 UTC,You put that so much better than I could have. That's a beautiful piece of text right there Tron777
denvernuggets,37dr38,silverandblack,3,Tue May 26 23:38:31 2015 UTC,"I don't agree that they have asked for a trade or played with a lack of effort. They just helped the front office know what to expect next season, based on the offseason. If the front office does their jobs well, Faried and Lawson will be happy to be here. But if they are rebuilding, then they need to find somebody else to rebuild around. When they signed their contracts they didn't agree to rebuild. They were told the organization was going to try to win a championship and that's what they expect.  Even if Faried and Lawson want to be traded and we don't trade them, I don't think they can or will play with a lack of effort."
denvernuggets,37dr38,Orangeskill,1 point,Tue May 26 23:28:23 2015 UTC,"I'm sure almost every player is assured the organization will do what needs to be done to win a championship when they sign a contract. Does that guarantee always come to fruition? Hardly ever. However, it is the player's responsibility to stay professional and give their all regardless of the team's performance. It might be just me, but both Lawson and Faried seemed to be sluggish at times and playing with a lack of effort. This lack of effort was mostly evident under Shaw and dissipated when Hunt took over. Also, in my opinion Faried isn't someone who the organization should build around anyway. He has shown only minimal improvement over the years and has been at his best a fringe all-star."
denvernuggets,37dr38,Crinnle,3,Wed May 27 00:29:17 2015 UTC,"That Denver even has a team is amazing. So let's start with FA. Nope. Nobody great wants to play in Denver. So we go with the draft, slowly. But we need a decent, teaching coach. Hunt works. Okay. So Lawson gets traded for picks, keep Faried, and within two years we are back in the playoffs. Firing Karl was stupid. Really stupid."
denvernuggets,37dr38,eg14000,2,Wed May 27 07:06:20 2015 UTC,"I say trade them for future picks. No way In hell we can get a star for them outta this draft this year. We won't be able to get a top 3 pick. But we could trade them to teams like the Knicks or Lakers  who Have no chance in hell of being contenders within the next two years, and hope we strike  it rich in one of the next lotterys."
denvernuggets,37dr38,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Wed May 27 13:58:13 2015 UTC,The Lakers and the Knicks probably wouldn't (read: probably shouldn't) give up an unprotected first round pick for just Ty or just Faried.

denvernuggets,37dr38,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Wed May 27 18:21:24 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to be harsh towards you. After re-reading my comment I sound like a total douchebag. The Nuggets have been really good and they have been really good in the recent past. We're only two years removed from ten straight playoff years. Sure, they all ended in first round exits, but it's not like they're the Rockies, who have made three playoff appearances in their 23 years of existence."
denvernuggets,37dr38,silverandblack,1 point,Wed May 27 18:24:32 2015 UTC,"The Rockies can, and have, been very successful. But that is baseball, and baseball is all about pitching. Good pitching? You win.  The Braves proved this. Do you need a couple of good hitters? You do. I appreciate your apology but its reddit, I can take it.  In the NBA making the playoffs as a 5 through 8 is actually worse than not making the playoffs at all. Its very rare that a five seed gets to the conference finals. The 76ers know this, and that is why they have been tanking for two years.  Should their fans expect a competitive game? They should. And that is part of what angers me about the NBA. One player, even two, can make it impossible for another team to win. So its my opinion that there are moments during the season that are fun to watch but that for the real competition you wait until the 2nd round of the playoffs for the NBA."
denvernuggets,37dr38,Abiv23,2,Wed May 27 18:35:25 2015 UTC,That has nothing to do with your surprise that we even have a team...I didn't ask why you think we'll never win a championship.

If Denver did not have a team, and it was not owned by Kroenke, I can see a strong possibility that it gets moved. Look at Vancouver.  But you are right, Denver has supported it."

denvernuggets,37dr38,silverandblack,4,Tue May 26 22:09:42 2015 UTC,"Assuming Ty or Kenneth get traded, I imagine the primary target will be draft picks, specifically in this draft. Although other players must be involved in any potential deals to make the financial aspect work, I don't expect any impact players to be sent to the Nuggets. Trading away two of your best players is almost always a sign of a rebuild."

denvernuggets,37dr38,NUGGman,2,Wed May 27 18:39:36 2015 UTC,Are you asking if we are going to tank on purpose?  I sure hope not
denvernuggets,37dr38,AlienDeg,3,Tue May 26 22:03:48 2015 UTC,"I hadn't considered the Nuggets tanking until a conversation I had in /r/NBA earlier today. I've been thinking we were in for a season similar to last year, not good but not completely abysmal, but tanking on purpose seems like a possibility.  On the other hand, given that the Nuggets fired Shaw instead of letting the crappiness continue and given that the team won too many games in a terrible season to net a top-5 pick, I don't know if this team (even without Ty and Faried) is bad enough to ""properly"" tank. Tanking also kinda negates the upside of the pick swap with the Knicks in the 2016 draft."
denvernuggets,37dr38,chucho320,3,Tue May 26 22:14:45 2015 UTC,"Very good points. I believe that we have quality players who's love of the game won't allow them to ever tank (Faried, Gallo, Nelson, Barton)"
denvernuggets,37dr38,aatencio91,2,Tue May 26 23:14:00 2015 UTC,"I wonder what exactly constitutes a ""major move?""  Denver has had a history of trouble in bringing in big time free agents, so if they're hoping for a Kevin Love/Deandre Jordan/whatever, the Nuggets should just start taking offers now.  If a head coach could be a ""major move,"" the Nuggets might still have some hope. If they could lure Alvin Gentry, Mike D'Antoni, or wait out the Bulls' bluff and hire Thibodeau, maybe that'd be enough?"
denvernuggets,37dr38,chucho320,3,Tue May 26 22:23:42 2015 UTC,"I imagine both Lawson and Faried would be content with Hunt given that they played with an increased effort once he became head coach. Therefore, I believe a ""major move"" entails signing a big name player."
denvernuggets,37dr38,aatencio91,2,Tue May 26 22:29:36 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be that surprised if they said the team better hire Hunt or somebody who is a proven commodity. I have nothing to base that on, other than my own idea of how I would feel in their shoes."
denvernuggets,37dr38,Nugforlife,2,Tue May 26 23:41:43 2015 UTC,Teague and Millsap for Lawsona and Farieda?
denvernuggets,37dr38,JMadFour,2,Wed May 27 15:56:17 2015 UTC,"I think Millsap is a free agent this offseason. Maybe the signing of Millsap, although unlikely, will appease Lawson? I can't imagine Faried would be thrilled with the signing of another PF who would send him to the bench."
denvernuggets,37dr38,Kawnar,2,Wed May 27 16:13:49 2015 UTC,"What these two guys fail to realize is that they are part of the problem.  Faried failed to be the Team USA Manimal that we needed.  And don't even get me started on Ty and why he's the worst team leader ever.  Both of them quit on their coach (and the fans) last year.  If we can get some good trades/picks for Ty, I'm all for it.  I'd like to keep Faried.  He's got the rare intangibles that are hard to come by.  Good point guards are much more abundant.  Ty has All-Star potential, but he's shown he'll never realize that potential and never be an All-Star.  He's the Jay Cutler of the NBA (minus the fact that Jay actually made the Pro Bowl once).  The sooner we sucker a team into taking him, the better."
denvernuggets,37dex7,aatencio91,3,Tue May 26 20:32:57 2015 UTC,Here is my write up on him.  Solid coach.  I still prefer Hunt for a rebuild.
denvernuggets,37dex7,icarus_adam,1 point,Tue May 26 23:11:46 2015 UTC,Awesome. Thank you.
denvernuggets,37dex7,Oshawut,2,Wed May 27 00:50:33 2015 UTC,"Don't know much about him except he loves to run a fast paced offense, not setting plays and not running down the clock trying to score as fast as possible. If Ty stays it might get us a couple more Ws since he's an extremely fast point guard. D'Antoni hasn't been too sucessful with his past 2 teams though."
denvernuggets,37dex7,TheRealMindGamez,1 point,Tue May 26 20:49:54 2015 UTC,He is like steroids for point guard play.  A coach that is well suited for the current state of the league if he's given a young high energy team with 3pt shooters.  He needs high b-ball IQ point guard leader to truly shine I think.
denvernuggets,37dex7,TheRealMindGamez,1 point,Thu May 28 20:41:40 2015 UTC,"So does he fit in Denver? Ty's not a leader at point guard, but is he a high IQ guy?"
denvernuggets,37acaa,JMadFour,3,Tue May 26 03:49:44 2015 UTC,You guys are Nicer.  Nuggets it is.  In on the ground floor I guess.
denvernuggets,37acaa,aatencio91,2,Wed May 27 16:01:59 2015 UTC,"I have a small amount of Fan History with Orlando. Small. When they came into the league I decided they would be my team. But then shortly after that, I kinda just stopped paying attention to basketball altogether. I havent really followed or cared about the NBA till now. I blame 2k15 for stirring interest again.  The Nuggets are the team I adopted in NBA2K15. It's Dat Baby Blue Uniform. My main MyPlayers, my C plays for Denver, my PG plays for Orlando. My MyGM/MyLeague team is Denver.  If it means anything, I live in WV and have never been to Denver, and only went to Orlando once on Vacation.  So, time to settle on a team to really follow, yes?  Thoughts!"
denvernuggets,37acaa,BigRedTed,10,Tue May 26 03:50:23 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you already lean towards Denver a tad, so why not go all in? Or you could have an East team and a West team. They won't play head-to-head all that often, so adopting both would be reasonable in my book."
denvernuggets,37acaa,with2nns,3,Tue May 26 04:33:05 2015 UTC,"We should be a pretty fun team to follow over the next couple years.  Hopefully picking up more young talent and developing a great contending squad.  That's the glass-half-full way to look at things, at least.  On the other hand, we are years away from contending again and don't have a good sense of direction right now as a team.  Either way, we've got some entertaining players to watch and have some cool history.  Be a Nuggets fan!"
denvernuggets,37acaa,tron777,3,Tue May 26 04:30:28 2015 UTC,"To piggy bag on this, we're looking for an up tempo run and gun coach. Those teams are always fun to watch."
denvernuggets,376vk2,jhurley98,6,Mon May 25 10:49:08 2015 UTC,"Assuming we get Winslow or Johnson, yes, it's a possibility. What seems more likely is that they would be more of a piece to the puzzle, not an outright star ie. Klay Thompson vs. Lebron. Klay is great don't get me wrong, but I'd it was just him without steph, in not sure how good the warriors would be."
denvernuggets,376vk2,MountCRushmore,3,Mon May 25 15:19:00 2015 UTC,Ye I would be hoping for one of those two as well. Lots have people have been saying herzonja but I don't see any star potential in him
denvernuggets,376vk2,Wtfitzchris,5,Mon May 25 15:40:07 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  I think Hezonja has a lot of star-potential.  He's 6'8"", athletic, and does an amazing job finishing at the rim.  He also has a great mid-range game which gives him versatility and makes him tough to defend.  He comes with downsides though.  His 3-pt shooting isn't great, as 39% in international play probably won't translate well to the NBA.  His ability to attack the rim and finish inside could be hampered by having Faried start (i.e. not having a stretch-4 crowds the paint).  He also doesn't take contact or get many foul calls.  He's probably never going to be an amazing 3-pt shooter, and if we have him stand in the corner all day, we're going to be disappointed.  However, in a run-and-gun offense with a stretch-4, he could be a very effective player.  Taking contact is also something that can be taught, and he's a solid ft shooter.    Best case, we have an all-star with a D. Wade style skill-set. Worst case, we have an athletic wing that can come off the bench and be an energy guy in what should be an uptempo offense."
denvernuggets,376vk2,eg14000,1 point,Mon May 25 16:20:04 2015 UTC,Why do people like Hezonja? He is just a streaky shooter that scored less than 14 points per 36 minutes. Athleticism and a high release point Don't make a player that special. A lot of players in the NBA have that.
denvernuggets,376vk2,MountCRushmore,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:14:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed, plus I'm done drafting unproven European players"
denvernuggets,376vk2,ParadeShitter,1 point,Mon May 25 18:17:16 2015 UTC,"takes years for these things to sort out. not as strong as last year's draft but certainly stronger than 2013.   chris kaman, kirk hinrich, tj ford, michael sweeney went 6/7/8/9 in arguably the best ever class (2003) so don't let anyone tell you there's a sure thing-can't miss type pick where the nuggets are at. certainly potential for a great player but there's no guarantees."
denvernuggets,376vk2,Viol33,1 point,Mon May 25 22:36:05 2015 UTC,"Okafor, Towns, Russell, Mudiay, Hezonja, Winslow, and Johnson all have all-star potential IMO. A few of them will probably bust and a few will probably end up as just decent players, but the Nuggets will have at least one of them on the board when they pick."
denvernuggets,370e4x,AlienDeg,18,Sat May 23 18:18:52 2015 UTC,"Looking back without all the emotion attached to it, we can appreciate how amazing Melo could be when he chose to play both ends. He stepped up that series in a way we hadn't seen before or since."
denvernuggets,370e4x,GoAvs14,3,Sun May 24 02:51:31 2015 UTC,I completely agree. Watching it again I am amazed at his skill.
denvernuggets,370e4x,silverandblack,14,Sun May 24 14:42:36 2015 UTC,"It hurts to watch highlights from this team, I could've sworn we were going all the way. One of the many reasons I despise Kobe as well."
denvernuggets,370e4x,TheeGreenHawk99,13,Sat May 23 18:24:47 2015 UTC,"That Laker vs Nuggets rivarly was special, crazy how that was already 5 years ago and we both suck now."
denvernuggets,370e4x,Oshawut,5,Sat May 23 19:08:20 2015 UTC,"We both suck now, but it's in the NBA's best interest for the Lakers to be relevant.  That's why the Lakers got the 2nd pick, er, magically advanced through the luck of the lottery. The Lakers will be back to prominence way before the Nuggets get a sniff of the playoffs. Having our clowns in the FO doesn't help one bit."
denvernuggets,370e4x,chucho320,4,Sun May 24 14:09:37 2015 UTC,Three mistakes taken away and we were in the Finals. Karl must have looked back and just been sick.

denvernuggets,36y98t,Jurrahcane,8,Sat May 23 03:09:36 2015 UTC,Trade Ty for the 6th pick. Use the 6th and 7th picks to trade up for D'Angelo Russell.  Trade Kenneth Faried and Wilson Chandler for ~mid 1sts. Use those to trade up for Hezonja or Johnson.  Move forward with: Russell | Harris | Hezonja or Johnson | Jokic/Lauvergne | Nurkic.
denvernuggets,36y98t,with2nns,4,Sat May 23 04:23:03 2015 UTC,"Haha that's a lot of work.. I'm sure you could trade Lawson for the 6th. And chandler and the 7th to the lakers and get the same thing with less moving parts.  However, it's chances are slim to none.. Although a man can dream.."
denvernuggets,36y98t,Kawnar,1 point,Sat May 23 05:36:50 2015 UTC,This sounds better than my plan. Faried and the 6th or 7th might make the Lakers bite more than Chandler since he's younger with a longer contract.
denvernuggets,36y98t,with2nns,1 point,Sat May 23 14:33:24 2015 UTC,They already have a young PF in Randle though.
denvernuggets,36y98t,Kawnar,1 point,Sat May 23 18:00:53 2015 UTC,"Eh, they could use another one. Start Randle and Okafor and bring Faried off the bench. I'm pretty sure Randle is the only guaranteed big they have for next season.."
denvernuggets,36y98t,with2nns,3,Sat May 23 18:35:14 2015 UTC,"That's giving up an awful lot for the 3rd pick.  Are you that sold on Russell that you would be willing to lose two other high lottery picks to get him?  I also think it's wishful thinking.  It's hard to imagine LA or Minnesota giving up a potential franchise C/PF.  As for Philly, after drafting Embiid and Noel and trading away MCW, Russell is exactly who they need to run that offense.  Getting the 3rd pick was the perfect situation for them, and I'd be surprised if they traded it.  The Faried/Chandler trade idea I like a lot.  Chandler's gone by the trade deadline, and I've never liked Faried that much.  I'd be happy moving them now for an added draft pick."
denvernuggets,36y98t,Wtfitzchris,1 point,Sat May 23 11:55:32 2015 UTC,"I'd be ok with it, especially if we can grab another mid lotto pick. I'd be ok with Mudiay too, and a deal with the Knicks would probably look a bit better."
denvernuggets,36y98t,with2nns,2,Sat May 23 15:31:44 2015 UTC,"Gutsy moves all round there.  Some might argue that it's too much but, if we were to go the full rebuild, this isn't necessarily a bad way to do it.  Much would depend on the improvement from guys like Nurkic and Harris, and I'm sure we would struggle for a year or two, but at least it's a definitive move from the team rather than doing a half and half.  One thing I think that will happen is at least one of Lawson or Faried being traded.  I'd like to hold on to Faried more than Lawson as clearly he isn't that happy playing in Denver at the moment, so if a good deal did come up then I would hope that we would jump on it."
denvernuggets,36y98t,with2nns,1 point,Sat May 23 11:01:12 2015 UTC,The only major downside imo is the Knicks swap is a wash. Oh well.
denvernuggets,36y98t,hellionwins,1 point,Sat May 23 14:36:09 2015 UTC,If the sixers think Russell has superstar potential they won't trade him.
denvernuggets,36y98t,Tskitishvili,8,Mon May 25 18:26:11 2015 UTC,Trade Ty for pick 6-10 and then draft Johnson and Winslow/Hezonja. Trade JJ Hickson & Foye anywhere to clear salary (even if it means we have to trade a couple 2nd rounders to get rid of them). Go after Paul Millsap and Patrick Beverly in free agency and re-sign Barton and Nelson. Lineup would look like this:  PG Beverly / Nelson / Green  SG Harris / Barton / Winslow or Hezonja  SF Gallo / Chandler / Johnson  PF Millsap / Faried / Lauvergne   C Nurkic / Jokic
denvernuggets,36y98t,trentyz,1 point,Sat May 23 05:42:11 2015 UTC,"I like our front court with Millsap in it.  Not sure I'd be happy with Faried simply coming off the bench with the money he is on, although having that energy off the bench isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I'd be stoked to clear Hickson and Foye off the books and probably wouldn't mind if Chandler was off the books either, although he does at least bring some positive skills to the table."
denvernuggets,36y98t,hammeringhank44,1 point,Sat May 23 11:03:06 2015 UTC,"I quite like this idea. Although if we add Millsap, get rid of Faried (as much as I like Faried). Chandler can play the 4 and Lauvergne will get some playing time. Also, I'd like to see Winslow starting, then bring Barton and Harris off the bench for their intensity.   This is actually a pretty defensive team."

denvernuggets,36vuq5,OkAutopilot,2,Sat May 23 00:07:01 2015 UTC,Yeah the value some fans put on Faried is ridiculous. He's an undersized PF with a very low basketball IQ. He's not worth that much to any competent GM.
denvernuggets,36vuq5,Nuggetsfan8,3,Tue May 26 19:40:38 2015 UTC,Faried isn't worth that much.

denvernuggets,36trsn,pairidaeza,3,Fri May 22 01:39:05 2015 UTC,I think they have Melvin Hunt in their back pocket so if they can hit a home run with a big time coach they will do that.
denvernuggets,36trsn,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Fri May 22 02:03:29 2015 UTC,"Better be within a month. Hell, if it's less than a week before the draft, then I'm going to wonder how much input they really want their coach to have."
denvernuggets,36trsn,ParadeShitter,2,Fri May 22 02:24:14 2015 UTC,no kidding huh? i don't want to make general assumptions but GENERALLY the brightest basketball mind in the whole program is the head coach. seems kind've silly not to at least consult the guy who has to actually coach/motivate/teach this guy for the foreseeable future (assuming they expect to make a good hire that'll stick).
denvernuggets,36trsn,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Fri May 22 02:31:59 2015 UTC,"I guess if Melvin gets the gig, then I wouldn't be as worried because he's already in the fold."
denvernuggets,36trsn,ParadeShitter,6,Fri May 22 02:48:21 2015 UTC,i'd be more worried because it would show a lack of respect for the man's opinion imo. you're leaving him in limbo so you can make a selfish decision? not a way to start a relationship if they truly think he's a capable leader of this team.
denvernuggets,36trsn,pairidaeza,2,Fri May 22 03:08:36 2015 UTC,"The thing that concerns me the most is a repeat of last off season. All this talk of being ""ultra-aggressive"" but almost nothing to show for it."

So let's wait around until every other team signs a coach. Such a joke. Just hire Hunt and be done with it. At least it would look like you have some initiative.

The emptiest arena ever.  The highest priced beers.  I wholeheartedly believe we are going to drop the ball in the coaching search and bring in someone like D'antoni or Mark Jackson, and we'll screw up the draft and get a 3rd rounder with our #7 pick.

denvernuggets,36tzle,skipaBturner,6,Fri May 22 02:42:35 2015 UTC,Winslow no exception. I like Stanleys wingspan but we need defense and 3pt% at the 2
denvernuggets,36tzle,teensonacid,1 point,Fri May 22 04:49:42 2015 UTC,I agree 100%. If Justise is still there at no. 7 and we don't take him I will be pissed.

denvernuggets,36tzle,ParadeShitter,3,Fri May 22 03:13:54 2015 UTC,Stanley Johnson. I wish we could get a couple of these guys. Winslow and Hezonja would also be nice. But I think Johnson will end up being the most well rounded offensive/defensive player of the three.
denvernuggets,36tzle,Tskitishvili,3,Fri May 22 04:28:53 2015 UTC,"I don't even know anymore. I like Stanley Johnson, personally. But I wouldn't be unhappy with Hezonja."

denvernuggets,36scn0,aatencio91,6,Thu May 21 19:00:55 2015 UTC,you can browse through the upcoming class here: http://hoopshype.com/free_agency_2015.htm  needs... well needs are kind've everywhere depending on what direction the team goes (especially what coach they hire). i'd say general depth and shooting.   doubt they'd pay money for a guy to take away minutes from nurkic. quality bigs like wright and kayman are up for new contracts but i think they'd rather go with jokic because he adds depth without the cost of signing a free agent.  PF you're kind've stuck with faried and hickson to an extent. depends on if you go big or small but you have $17 million tied up between the 2 so not really many options. obviously gallo fits in there but he fits in kind've 2-4 imo. and if they keep king joffrey on the active roster than that's a lot of guys for the 4-5 spot.  SF isn't lacking talent imo. chandler and gallo can both play but you realistically need some depth because gallo's injury history is worrisome. i think that's the reason a lot of people want winslow or johnson in this draft.   SG is lacking but i don't see where denver could come up with the money to pay a quality free agent to come in. i'd love a guy like khris middleton or even lou williams in the mix but i highly doubt it'll happen. this position/need will likely be filled in the draft and maybe denver targets one of the lesser desired free agents. most likely they keep foye and extend barton and see what happens  PG might be the biggest need depending on what direction the team goes with lawson. i imagine they either go PG this draft or the next and try and build from within. unlikely they spend in free agency for a PG for the future (at least this offseason) unless they get creative with the contract until 16/17 when they have plenty of cap space.   so i'd guess the nuggets don't bring in any starters from free-agency. maybe 1 or 2 players for depth (hopefully they can shoot). i really think this isn't the off-season for denver to get crazy unless they get creative with contracts with so much cap space looming past the 15/16 season when they have to make decisions on chandler and gallo
denvernuggets,36py6i,aatencio91,2,Thu May 21 04:41:00 2015 UTC,i'd probably do it. does anyone see a long term plan with lawson in it? i have nothing against ty but i don't see it. i'd try and get a judge of where all the guards are going. some mock's have mudiay at 6 and mario available and others have russell/mudiay/mario gone in the top 5. if the nuggets could get one of those 3 i think that'd be great for the future. if they think trading ty for a pick could land 2 of those 3 than even better.  maybe they love winslow or johnson more than i do so it kind've makes sense to go that route. i'd be fine with nelson being the starting PG next year if it meant the team had 2 lottery picks. especially if one was a pg in training
denvernuggets,36py6i,ParadeShitter,7,Thu May 21 06:18:04 2015 UTC,"does anyone see a long term plan with lawson in it?   Yes.   The case for not trading Ty:   He's really good.  Despite Ty shooting the worst percentage of his career he ranked 9th among point guards in Win Shares.  He pushed his assist to 43%, the 5th best mark in the league, while reducing his turnover rate. He's simply on of the best offensive point guards in the league and he's been the engine of the Nugget's offense since his rookie year. This offense is going to struggle without Ty.  We have the Knick's 2016 pick. If you make your team significantly worse this year, and I haven't seen a Ty trade proposal that wouldn't make the Nuggets worse in the short term, you may squander this asset. This is a free pass to take another shot.  Players don't like losing. I think the Ty as a malcontent talk is overblown. It was a horrible season, everyone was frustrated, by the all star break no one wanted to be there. When the team was winning, Ty was a model citizen.  Ty is on a good contract. The contract basically covers his prime at a decent rate.  Ty's trade value is in the tank. With the season the Nuggets just had, Ty's value is at it's ebb."
denvernuggets,36py6i,tron777,2,Thu May 21 15:07:26 2015 UTC,"this is a lot like taking horsepower numbers from a car not running a peak efficiency. it's why advanced stats can be misleading. of course he's putting up decent offensive numbers, someone has to. the team wasn't good last year so any numbers (good or bad) should be taken with a grain of salt. just because one person marginally thrived while the team largely sucked means almost nothing. if basketball is 50% offense and 50% defense than you can' just say ""he's really good"" without taking into account his lack of impact on the other end of the floor. if ""he's really good"" on offense than he's about equally bad on defense.    plus i don't really agree that ""he's really good"" because of some assist numbers. there's more to a PG in 2015 than pure assist numbers. i think he's a top half starting PG offensively and a bottom half defensively. does that equal ""really good"". in the world, yes.... in the nba? i dunno, i'm not so sure   i think jameer nelson can do a serviceable job in the role of starting PG next year. i don't think the team would be significantly worse with him on the floor. if you want to talk about squandering asset than you have to realistically look at the prospect of spending 26 million over the next 2 seasons. or not developing future talent because you're stuck with a short-term solution.  agreed. i don't have any problems with ty. the dui was unfortunate but not something that can't be overcome. i don't look at athletes as role models so i have an entirely different perspective and set of expectations for them than others i guess the contract is fair for both parties. i wouldn't say denver has him on a good contract. they're not overpaying but he's not playing at a discount ala steph curry agree 100% which is probably why these other 4 points don't matter. i don't think ty has a long-term future with denver but i don't think the league has any yearning to make a deal for him either."
denvernuggets,36py6i,ParadeShitter,2,Thu May 21 17:58:42 2015 UTC,"it's why advanced stats can be misleading.   They're just regular old box score stats presented in a way that doesn't ignore pace and minutes played.    of course he's putting up decent offensive numbers, someone has to.     Ty put up good numbers on good teams too. I don't see much to the idea that Ty puts up empty numbers.    if basketball is 50% offense and 50% defense    Not for point guards it isn't. You can scheme around your point guard being a poor defender.  There are plenty of examples of good defensive teams with poor defensive point guards.    plus i don't really agree that ""he's really good"" because of some assist numbers.    Well, I din't think I'd need to convince people that Ty is a good point guard. Ignore the stats, he can bend a defense by himself, he makes good passing and shooting decisions, there were long stretches these last two years where he completely carried the offense and every time he left the court the scoreboard stopped lighting up. The biggest complaint I've seen about Ty is that he doesn't shoulder more of the offense.     i think jameer nelson can do a serviceable job in the role of starting PG next year.   I disagree. Jameer is a great veteran presence and I don't think he'll kill us in short stretches as a backup.  He can reliably get the ball up the floor and pass to open players but he struggles to get by anyone anymore and he takes some pretty horrible shots at times."
denvernuggets,36py6i,tron777,1 point,Thu May 21 18:57:55 2015 UTC,you're an admitted ty fan. i'm not trying to convince you of anything. just stating my opinion that i don't think ty lawson is an elite PG in this league and if the nuggets traded him away they wouldn't cower in his loss for a decade.
denvernuggets,36py6i,ParadeShitter,1 point,Thu May 21 18:59:50 2015 UTC,"He's certainly not elite but I think he's in the step down along with Teague, Lowry, Bledsoe, Dragic, Parker. Put Ty in place of any of those guys and I think you get similar results. Replaceable, sure, but not easily."
denvernuggets,36py6i,tron777,1 point,Thu May 21 19:08:57 2015 UTC,"i like all those guys over ty except for bledsoe (injuries) and parker (age). certainly no top half starting PG in the league is easily replaceable, i agree"

Would you guys have any interest in trading the #7 pick for our 3 extra first rounders (Lakers, Heat, and OKC)?  Or a 3-way with the Knicks where they get Lawson and an ass load of picks, Sixers get #7, and Nuggets get #4"
denvernuggets,36py6i,LeM1stre,1 point,Thu May 21 17:57:09 2015 UTC,"i don't see why denver would ever trade their starting PG to move up 3 spots in the draft.   i also doubt they'd be willing to move from #7 for anything not this season although the prospect of getting a top 5 lakers pick next year, possible a lottery pick from miami and a tradable pick from OKC is intriguing. i think the front office knows they have to bring in some fresh faces to sell some tickets next year or at least starting the building process."
denvernuggets,36py6i,ParadeShitter,2,Thu May 21 18:35:17 2015 UTC,"I figured you guys would want to move up for Mudiay in the 3 teamer  for the straight up trade for #7 - you'd get 3 firsts next year (and probably seconds too)  , while trading Lawson independently to like the Pacers.

denvernuggets,36py6i,LeM1stre,2,Thu May 21 18:49:26 2015 UTC,lawson for all those future picks is definitely intriguing but i can only speak for myself. lawson to move from 7 to 4 in the draft is not intriguing in the slightest
denvernuggets,36py6i,ParadeShitter,2,Thu May 21 18:51:42 2015 UTC,"I'm new to all of this, so apologies if this is a stupid question:  Is it possible to trade Lawson and X for #4 or #5 while keeping #7? I know people say we don't want to trade to NYK in order to make the 2016 pick from them better, but if you're getting a good pick from em this year does next year matter as much?"
denvernuggets,36py6i,ParadeShitter,3,Thu May 21 18:57:09 2015 UTC,anything is possible. us fans don't have much of a say on how any of it works but it's fun to talk hypotheticals.  i honestly have no idea what is and isn't actually on the table or possible
denvernuggets,36py6i,TriceraScotts,1 point,Thu May 21 19:00:49 2015 UTC,"The Nuggets traded that OKC pick to the Sixers in the Javale McGee deal.

denvernuggets,36py6i,hayclaylaybaymaysay,1 point,Thu May 21 06:09:54 2015 UTC,"I don't want him going to the knicks.... the worse they are, the better the pick we get from them is. As a side note, them getting boned in the lottery was a good thing for us (potentially).   Honestly, I want to trade Lawson and our first rounder this year to the Lakers for the #2 spot so we can grab DeAngelo Russell. The 76ers are going to grab him at #3, so we'd have to move to #2- plus the Lakers have needs. We could even throw in Chandler if we needed to, I don't really care.  That would give us a starting lineup of DeAngelo Rusell, Gary Harris, Gallinari, Faried, and Nurk. Nelson coming off the bench. We wouldn't be in contentino this year, but I love that foundation, especially because all of them are under contract for multiple years (except Gallinari)"
denvernuggets,36py6i,hayclaylaybaymaysay,2,Thu May 21 16:35:07 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't the Lakers be more interested in DeAngelo Russell than Ty Lawson? Also giving them Ty, Chandler, and the 7th overall seems like a lot to give up."
denvernuggets,36py6i,kthxtyler,2,Thu May 21 16:40:02 2015 UTC,"Seems to me they'd want Okafor/Towns more than Russell. They have Jordan Clarkson, so PG isn't a pressing need for them but it's certainly a position they could upgrade. They'd have Clarkson, Kobe, Julius Randle, and Okafor if they drafted #2 (in my opinion), simply because PG is not a ""hole"" like the Center position is for them.  And I don't want to give up Chandler, but if we had to, I would be okay. If we kept him though, we could bring him off the bench where he's more comfortable. jameer and Wilson off the bench would be awesome."

denvernuggets,36ncdr,The_NGUYENNER,3,Thu May 21 01:50:19 2015 UTC,The general story is that his team is holding him back to purposefully tank his draft stock. Despite inconsistent playing time/low opportunities he still had games where he dominated... including one game where he went 8/8 from 3pt. Intentionally benching him may have even had the opposite effect on his draft stock in reality.

Mario is also more athletic and imo a better shooter, at worst around the same. I give passing and handling to Bogey right now though, but I think Hezonja is the far superior talent."

denvernuggets,36n4ml,aatencio91,1 point,Wed May 20 16:56:42 2015 UTC,"Ah, I misread the tweet. I thought he just passed on the gigs, not the interviews."
denvernuggets,36n4ml,IdRatherBeLurking,6,Wed May 20 17:01:20 2015 UTC,"So this leaves Melvin Hunt, Mike D'Antoni, and Alan Gentry according to the Denver Post. Part of me thinks that Melvin Hunt is a good idea because obviously the players like him, but the other part thinks that's like accepting defeat."
denvernuggets,36n4ml,aatencio91,8,Wed May 20 16:58:49 2015 UTC,"I'm actually glad to hear this.  He's not a run-and-gun coach, so I don't think he would be a good fit here.  He's also a bit of a wild card in that no one knows if he's actually a good coach or just a product of having 2-3 MVP candidates on his team."
denvernuggets,36n4ml,Wtfitzchris,3,Wed May 20 16:37:01 2015 UTC,Do we really want a run-and-gun coach? We've been doing that for 40 odd years now and it has resulted in nothing for us.
denvernuggets,36n4ml,OkAutopilot,4,Wed May 20 17:51:03 2015 UTC,"With the altitude it only makes sense. If the team played as fast as Houston or LAC they'd be stupid good at home, even without the same level of talent."
denvernuggets,36n4ml,aatencio91,0,Wed May 20 18:10:26 2015 UTC,"""With the altitude we just have to do it!"" This franchise has been saying that for the better part of 40 years. It hasn't worked out. Should we run an offense that pushes tempo? Absolutely, outside of the Grizzles and Bulls that's how pretty much every offense was in the playoffs. Do we need to hammer the run-and-gun approach? No, because running and gunning has lead to success a grand total of 0 times for us in the playoffs.   We need a coaching staff who can teach a fast paced offense, but also one who can have our roster be competent in the half court set because that's how you win in the playoffs. Last year when we NEEDED a bucket, or a good possession, a good 90% of the time it turned into a Ty Lawson iso. That is not good basketball and that is not good coaching. Some of that is on our roster, some of it is in the principle.   We could hire a defensive coach and wear people down with incredibly hard defense at altitude as well, you know, but at the end of the day we need to be able to hang our hat on something that isn't just a regular season home game booster."
denvernuggets,36n4ml,OkAutopilot,3,Wed May 20 18:35:07 2015 UTC,"So would you say a coach like Thibodeau would be worth a shot? Shaw tried to slow down and play half court defense, right? It didn't work out so well but the players didn't have much respect for him, either. Maybe a proven guy like Thibs would command more respect and get more out of the players than Shaw could?  Honestly I'm pretty new to basketball. I've always been a Nuggets ""fan"" because they're the home team, but watching the playoffs with my buddy who's a Rockets fan has really gotten me into the sport so I'm still learning a ton of stuff."
denvernuggets,36n4ml,aatencio91,3,Wed May 20 18:39:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know if Thibs would work. Possibly in the end but, our roster is not suited for his schemes or his philosophy. We don't have any good paint defenders on the team."
denvernuggets,36n4ml,OkAutopilot,3,Wed May 20 18:59:13 2015 UTC,"No, Shaw tried to play a half court offense. This Denver team as currently structured is a few defensive pieces away from being a very good team - with proper coaching.   Hell look at what Iggy did with this team when he got here. Gallo and Chandler are good (but not elite) defenders at their spots, and Barton seems to be there too.   We can already score. A rim protector and a perimeter D player could push this team a long way."
denvernuggets,36n4ml,f0xpuppy,2,Thu May 21 07:28:07 2015 UTC,The front office does.
denvernuggets,36n4ml,with2nns,1 point,Wed May 20 19:10:38 2015 UTC,That's almost a good enough sign that we shouldn't. I have 0 faith in the Kronks as owners.
denvernuggets,36n4ml,OkAutopilot,2,Wed May 20 20:21:59 2015 UTC,"rudderless ship imo  why fire karl if you don't plan on changing the gameplan? run and gun isn't even a thing anymore. you can run and gun (shoot 3 pointers) but expecting to have sustained success just running and gunning for layups is like maybe 15% of offensive possessions. for the other 85% you need half court offense. like people to create shots for themselves and others and players that can just flat out shoot. we should've shot the long-ball more last year. it's why i don't think nurkic and faried really play well together.   faried is a great energy player and some games i think he's definitely worth the money and some games i think his ceiling is based on his energy level that day, nothing wrong with it but you can't pair a guy who has no offense outside of the paint with another guy who's offensive game is the same. there's too many bodies down low, not enough spacing.   i have to think a lineup like lawson/foye/chandler/gallo is going to be the most offensively efficient lineup. i just don't think you can run and gun with this current set of pieces, certainly not without a power forward who can shoot from distance. it's not 1995, not 2005... it's 2015 and the game is ever evolving. i'm not a fan of chasing past success"
denvernuggets,36n4ml,ParadeShitter,1 point,Wed May 20 21:01:20 2015 UTC,Agreed with everything you said. I also think we might end up shipping a combo of faried+chandler/gallo for a piece or a pick as well which I'd be okay with.
denvernuggets,36n4ml,OkAutopilot,1 point,Wed May 20 21:09:22 2015 UTC,The combination of our current roster and the altitude means that it would be best for the team to go with a run-and-gun coach. We saw what happened with Shaw- I personally don't want to go through that again.
denvernuggets,36n4ml,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Thu May 21 16:20:08 2015 UTC,"We have a bad roster, why would the logical decision be to find a coach to fit a poor roster rather than fix the roster/rebuild with a coach who can lead us to actual, meaningful wins?"
denvernuggets,36n4ml,OkAutopilot,1 point,Thu May 21 16:41:45 2015 UTC,"I disagree.   Ty Lawson, Danilo Gallinari, and Wilson Chandler are all great players. We have Ty for 2 more years, Danilo and Wilson next year. Both players the FO are big on, and worth re-signing.   We have Faried, who ranges anywhere from decent to great depending on the night. He's locked in for 4 more years.  We have will Barton, who is a fan favorite and great 6th man to have on your team. I hope we re-sign him.  We have Jameer Nelson next year, who proved to be a very serviceable backup PG.  Then of course we have Juka who is a stud in training, and Gary who could easily become a great defensive-SG if his shot actually started falling.  Our roster isn't a great one, but it isn't bad either. There are solid pieces here that no franchise would want to give away just to rebuild for rebuilding's sake."
denvernuggets,36n4ml,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Thu May 21 16:51:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're being realistic about the Nuggets. You also have to think in terms of the rest of the NBA, that is NOT a good roster compared to the upper half of the league. It just isn't.  It's hard to play Gallo and Chandler at the same time unless we go small, I completely disagree with you on Faried's range I think it's more like ranging from a complete liability to a great game once in a while, Will Barton is definitely a serviceable back up guard but nowhere near a great 6th man, and then we have some young players who may or may not develop into something."
denvernuggets,36n4ml,OkAutopilot,1 point,Thu May 21 16:56:44 2015 UTC,"Half the league? Really? I think you're overvaluing the top half of this league. Remember who got into the playoffs in the East. Pay attention to the fact that I left out half of the roster at least- the shitty half that will hopefully be pared down or non-existent next year. Either way, it seems like you're denigrating the good parts of our roster strictly on their poor performances last year, which we all know was greatly affected by variables other than talent.    It's hard to play Gallo and Chandler at the same time    We had some real success with those two at the 3 and 4, I don't see why we need to run small ball for that to continue being successful.  Faried has had some monster games, and that's undeniable. When he wasn't feuding with Shaw, he was constistently playing decent-to-great basketball on a nightly basis.   Will Barton is only in his 3rd year, and even then he was the life of this team for many games, inserting much needed energy and urgency when he came in.   How can you be anything but optimistic about our future prospects? You and I have no clue how it will turn out, so you're actively choosing to be negative. That's fine, but I think it's pointless to be that way."
denvernuggets,36n4ml,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Thu May 21 17:05:47 2015 UTC,"Warriors, Clippers, Rockets, Grizzlies, Spurs, Mavericks, Pelicans, Jazz, Thunder, Trail Blazers, Pacers, Bulls, Cavs, Nets, Raptors, Heat, Wizards, and Hawks all have definitively better rosters than we do.   Suns, Kings, Pistons, Bucks, Celtics are the group that we're associated with, the Kings and Suns both having a better core/team to build around than the Nuggets. The Bucks were ended up a top 3 defense in the league as well so perhaps they're already better than us.  That would leave us being better than The Lakers, Timberwolves, Knicks, 76ers, Magic, and Hornets. So in reality I guess it looks like I was undervaluing the top half of the league, we're actually worse than more than half of the league.   Farieds games are pretty empty and always have been, hustle games on putbacks and crashing the boards against smaller line ups, he also has a huge discrepancy between home games and road games. Even during his best games (20-15+) he plays some of the worst defense in the league. I think Barton looks like he can be a solid Corey Brewer type of player but that's far from what we need to start breaking into the playoffs.   It's not that I'm not optimistic about our future prospects but it's not like there's anything to make me sit there and be either negative or positive about them."
denvernuggets,36n4ml,OkAutopilot,1 point,Thu May 21 17:20:48 2015 UTC,"Suns, Kings, Pistons, Bucks, Celtics   I would argue that, with the right coach, we are a better team than all 5. So that puts us smack in the middle, and that's considering the worse half of our roster (which, again, I intentionally left out).    It's not that I'm not optimistic about our future prospects but it's not like there's anything to make me sit there and be either negative or positive about them.   You don't think that we've seen some good things shine out of Nurkic or Harris? Things that would make us optimistic about their future?   I understand that you're down on the team, but based on the rest of the comments, it seems like you're being especially hard on even our best players. That's fine, but I can't agree at all with you."
denvernuggets,36n4ml,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Thu May 21 17:24:19 2015 UTC,"I think we could be better than those teams, but I don't think we have a better roster than the Suns or Kings. Boogie/Rudy/Collison and Knight/Gordon/Twins are just better than what we have, and that is what it is.  I've seen some good things out of both of them and I've seen some bad things out of both of them, but nothing from either one that makes me think that they're going to be game or team changers which is what we need to be able to be competitive in the playoffs for the next good, long while.  I think I'm only being hard on Faried, and I think it's completely justified. He is a huge liability for this team especially on the defensive end. He has a very poor BBIQ which makes him easy to outsmart for better/older players, he has never performed well against players bigger than him, he is one of the worst pick and roll defenders in the league, and he has no semblance of an offensive game. I stand by giving him that contract as being a huge mistake for us."
denvernuggets,36mu1y,bocaphlyer,8,Wed May 20 15:20:05 2015 UTC,Herzonja draft pick profile incoming!
denvernuggets,36mu1y,IdRatherBeLurking,6,Wed May 20 16:13:35 2015 UTC,"Sweet, i really don't know much about the guy, but people seem to be pretty high on him.  Highlight videos can make anyone look good though."
denvernuggets,36mu1y,denverNUGGs,10,Wed May 20 16:15:36 2015 UTC,I dunno man. A video of my highlights would be very underwhelming.
denvernuggets,36mu1y,orangesoda123,2,Wed May 20 19:20:53 2015 UTC,"If you take a look back at certain players highlight videos, their game remains essentially unchanged in terms of decision making and tendencies.   Take Gallinari, for instance. I looked up his old highlight reel expecting to see something similar to Hezonja, but it turns out he exhibits a lot of the same tendencies nowadays that he did while at Olimpia Milano; driving, head-fakes, low-post moves and fast-break scoring.  That said, if Hezonja can play anywhere near like what we see on this highlight reel, I think that's a really good starting position."
denvernuggets,36mu1y,pairidaeza,6,Thu May 21 07:21:15 2015 UTC,Those finishes are pretty sweet.
denvernuggets,36mu1y,OddEye,7,Wed May 20 19:54:49 2015 UTC,I'm gonna go against the grain here and say we'd be foolish to pass on Winslow or Johnson for this guy. Feel free to talk me out of it though.
denvernuggets,36mu1y,nkraus90,5,Wed May 20 16:19:33 2015 UTC,"I would be fine taking Winslow over him, not so much Johnson"
denvernuggets,36mu1y,chucho320,3,Wed May 20 22:29:43 2015 UTC,No no no no no.  We don't need another unproven Euro who looks great against 2nd rate talent.
denvernuggets,36mu1y,OkAutopilot,11,Wed May 20 16:42:16 2015 UTC,I don't know why you'd consider the majority of players in college ball NOT 2nd rate talent.
denvernuggets,36mu1y,chucho320,-7,Wed May 20 18:57:45 2015 UTC,"Most of the players in the European leagues are playing there because they aren't good enough to make it in the NBA.  Not even as D-League players... Or Denver Nuggets.  If they are killing it in College, that's one thing, and are expected to take the next step.  If they are killing it across the pond, it's because they are slightly better than the mediocrity over there and may or may not have plateaued.  Why are we the ones who roll the dice to see if they have any more upside left?  Haven't we done that enough?  Where has that gotten us?  Fournie...YAY!!"
denvernuggets,36mu1y,OkAutopilot,8,Wed May 20 21:29:33 2015 UTC,"Here's some players who were playing in Euroleague or a European League before they came to play in the US: Manu Ginobli, Pau Gasol, Luis Scola, Tiago Splitter, Nikola Pekovic, Andrei Kirilenko, Donatas Motiejunas, Beno Udrih, Jose Calderon, Omer Asik, Nikola Mirotic, Mirza Teletovic, Marco Belinelli, Danillo Gallinari, Nicolas Batum, Ricky Rubio, Marcin Gortat, Goran Dragic, Boris Diaw, Marc Gasol, Tony Parker, Dirk Nowitzki, and plenty more.  Those are just the players playing in the league RIGHT NOW. I could go back further and show you some more All-Stars, Champions, DPOYs, Finals MVPs, who started their careers in Europe.  You know why people are playing in European leagues instead of D1 College ball? Because they're European."
denvernuggets,36mu1y,dinolarry,3,Wed May 20 21:54:41 2015 UTC,Those guy get paid way more to play there than the D League that's why they don't play here not because then D league has superior talent

denvernuggets,36mu1y,chucho320,0,Thu May 21 07:26:43 2015 UTC,I looked at his tools and I also watched the scouting reports.  You know what I took away from that? That those highlights were pretty much all of his highlights.  He comes off the bench in the Euro league.  Averages 6 ppg? Plays zero defense and gets just as cold as he does hot.  We already have plenty of that on our roster.

Out of the three guys everyone seems to be projecting us to take (Hezonja, Winslow, Johnson), Winslow seems like he's the best shooter.  We're already overcrowded at SF/PF, so having a guy that can come in and play wing would probably be the best fit for us."

denvernuggets,36nf3h,jasonparticles,6,Wed May 20 17:51:30 2015 UTC,"At the moment I'd say Ty, Manimal, Gallo and Nurkic.  Juka is probably the only one close to untouchable, but even that could change if he doesn't make much of a 2nd year jump or if the new coach doesn't trust him with big minutes for whatever reason. I think we'd listen to offers for Manimal and Gallo, but wouldn't trade em unless we get a blue chip player or a bounty of picks. Each bring a couple elite skills and non-ghastly contracts to the table.  Ty situation isn't ideal, gotta get what we can if he wants out regardless of the new coach or lottery pick. We saw what happens when a toxic work environment festers."
denvernuggets,36nf3h,tehKEVSTAR,5,Wed May 20 18:02:43 2015 UTC,"Gallo, Nurkic, Barton (if we sign him). That's assuming Ty is gone and Wilson won't be here this time next year."
denvernuggets,36nf3h,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Wed May 20 17:58:41 2015 UTC,"Based on our contract situation, our core for the next four years is likely going to be Faried, Nurkic, and Harris.  I'd also like to see Lawson, Gallo, and Barton signed to long-term deals."
denvernuggets,36nf3h,Wtfitzchris,3,Wed May 20 18:57:30 2015 UTC,"I want ty to be in our core. but everyone could see this year that he is only motivated when we are making the playoffs. Ty lawson disappeared after all star break, and that was just at the time when denver forfeited from fighting for a playoff spot.   I don't blame him really, he's a really skilled player, he isn't a chris paul/westbrook alpha player that people want him to be, but he is a really good system PG, and would thrive on any playoff team you put him on.  If we are looking to tank for a few more seasons, i think it would only be fair that we trade ty while he is coming into his prime."

denvernuggets,36lvlf,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Wed May 20 14:20:07 2015 UTC,It's not that simple. Nurkic is a patriot but these unfortunate events are beyond sports and it's not good for the Bosnian basketball nor for Nurkic.  I really hope the injury is not that severe.

denvernuggets,36lvlf,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Wed May 20 14:30:05 2015 UTC,Teletovic is the number 1 player and a national hero. He gives everything he can for Bosnia. He can't be compared to Nurkic currently.   We all hope the situation gets resolved because Nurkic has the potential to be maybe even one of the best players ever from Bosnia.

denvernuggets,36mdnm,pairidaeza,0,Thu May 21 00:08:17 2015 UTC,Yeah but we then could get rid of JJ or Darell Arthur and have much more productive player and style. I think it would also help Faried`s game  100 percent. I think Kaminsky could go #1 but I think most people would say at 7 he will still be available.

denvernuggets,36krgx,tron777,13,Wed May 20 14:32:48 2015 UTC,Lawson and who? Lawson alone is no where close to worth a 4th overall pick. Lawson and the seventh to move up three spaces is way too much. You'd have to find a realistic combo.
denvernuggets,36krgx,bzzltyr,5,Wed May 20 03:17:11 2015 UTC,Maybe either the Blazers or Grizzlies future pick we have.
denvernuggets,36krgx,Tskitishvili,6,Wed May 20 03:37:23 2015 UTC,They'd want Faried. Or Chandler. Or Gallinari.
denvernuggets,36krgx,pairidaeza,3,Wed May 20 03:38:36 2015 UTC,Not gallo
denvernuggets,36krgx,weiner_cleaner,1 point,Wed May 20 11:59:58 2015 UTC,I'd do that.
denvernuggets,36krgx,phatlever,3,Wed May 20 04:10:21 2015 UTC,"So, presumably, you'd ship Lawson and Faried for the fourth pick?  Best case scenario, what does our starting lineup look like after the draft?"
denvernuggets,36krgx,pairidaeza,1 point,Wed May 20 04:15:26 2015 UTC,"Probably not Faried and Lawson, but I'd think hard if they wanted any other pair of faried, chandler, gallo, lawson for the pick."
denvernuggets,36krgx,phatlever,1 point,Wed May 20 04:48:34 2015 UTC,"Okay, so, what's your ideal starting five in the wake of that?"
denvernuggets,36krgx,pairidaeza,1 point,Wed May 20 04:53:47 2015 UTC,"Jameer, Barton, Gallo, Faried, Nurkic  Mudiay/Harris//Justise Winslow/ Jokic off the bench."
denvernuggets,36krgx,phatlever,3,Wed May 20 05:00:36 2015 UTC,I honestly think we're better off keeping Ty in that scenario.
denvernuggets,36krgx,pairidaeza,2,Wed May 20 05:01:43 2015 UTC,Likely 2 more years of Ty vs. 5 years of Mudiay.  I'd take that
denvernuggets,36krgx,phatlever,2,Wed May 20 05:03:32 2015 UTC,But it'd be 2 years of ty and 5 years of the 7th pick.
denvernuggets,36krgx,rvhack,5,Wed May 20 05:56:37 2015 UTC,"Just a couple of years ago Jrue Holiday was worth a 5th. I would say Lawson is better than Holiday. Plus it's all about what others are offering, who would give up more than Lawson?  We'd have to take back money though. Probably have to take Bargani (spelling?)"
denvernuggets,36krgx,bzzltyr,2,Wed May 20 04:08:49 2015 UTC,Yeah but holiday was still on his rookie deal and younger. Ty's got a $12 mil a year contract working against him and it's only two years left. A rookie contract that locks a 4 pick up for 4-5 years is way more attractive.
denvernuggets,36krgx,teensonacid,3,Wed May 20 04:48:51 2015 UTC,I would say the Knicks value winning more right now than saving money. But I get what you're saying.
denvernuggets,36krgx,tron777,10,Wed May 20 05:01:48 2015 UTC,Do it
denvernuggets,36krgx,Wtfitzchris,3,Wed May 20 02:48:15 2015 UTC,If we trade Lawson to the Knicks we might as well throw our pick swap with them for 2016 in the trash. The only player I would trade to the Knicks this year is Hickson.
denvernuggets,36krgx,Wtfitzchris,3,Wed May 20 14:37:44 2015 UTC,"This is what everyone replying to this post is missing.  We give up a borderline all-star PG and the 7th pick to move up a few spots to probably draft Mudiay (who can't shoot 3s and is far from being a sure-thing).  The Knicks, now with Lawson and Melo, are much better next season.  That probably reduces the value of the 2016 first-rounder we get from them by more than 3 spots.  We'd just be shooting ourselves in the foot."
denvernuggets,36krgx,Tskitishvili,3,Wed May 20 16:30:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone agrees with giving up the 7th in this deal. That would be unfathomable to give up Lawson to only get a 3 pick advantage. To me it would have to be Lawson for the pick, alone (or whatever makes the salary even)"
denvernuggets,36krgx,OkAutopilot,1 point,Wed May 20 17:53:42 2015 UTC,"Ahh alright I misunderstood.  That makes a lot more sense, but I still don't think it would be worth it.  I'd rather have a competent PG and better pick next year from NY than gamble on someone like Mudiay."
denvernuggets,36krgx,rvhack,3,Wed May 20 18:51:49 2015 UTC,Makes sense for both teams. We could draft Mudiay and instantly become a better defensive team and still be able to add another wing with the 7th pick. The odds of hitting with one of two top 7 picks is pretty high imo.
denvernuggets,36krgx,OkAutopilot,3,Wed May 20 03:06:43 2015 UTC,"If we could trade for the 4th, draft Mudiay, and pick up Super Mario with the 7th I would be ECSTATIC.   There are some issues with this though, we'd still have Gallo and Chandler taking the SF minutes. We also wouldn't be addressing our glaring issues at the 4/5. I want us to get rid of Faried, Arthur, and Hickson because not only can they not play defense, they can't really play offense either. At the very least I'd like to move Faried into the 6th man position but... eh, I don't know. I don't like Faried."
denvernuggets,36krgx,rvhack,1 point,Wed May 20 04:39:07 2015 UTC,I was under the impression Arthur was already gone. Also having nokic back up juka would keep hickson a backup 4 where he belongs
denvernuggets,36krgx,OkAutopilot,3,Wed May 20 05:58:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but unless Faried makes a massive leap defensively in this next year we're not really any better off starting him over Hickson either. Any time we go against a competent big man, or any time a team goes small on us, we hemorrhage points in the paint. Faried is simply incapable of guarding anyone bigger than him (the majority of players at his position), and even worse at defending the pick and roll."
denvernuggets,36krgx,rvhack,1 point,Wed May 20 06:58:17 2015 UTC,I'd just rather we move hickson tbh.  If Kenneth is paired with a defensively capable center I think we'd be ok. It was when juka was out and jj was at the 5 that we really suffered. At that point it was hard to watch how little resistance there was in the paint and we led the league in fouls. He is smaller than most bigs but has the athleticism to make them pay for it. A Greg Monroe or Aldridge will have the clear edge when the game slows down but if we still want to play fast he's great to have.   I do think it would be nice to have a change of pace as opposed to someone in the same mould backing him up. Hope says joffrey can be that guy.
denvernuggets,36krgx,OkAutopilot,3,Wed May 20 07:17:12 2015 UTC,"I really don't think we'd be ok even if we had a defensively capable center in the middle. It's harder to ""hide"" a big man on defense than it is to hide a guard, and Faried doesn't have any semblance of an offensive game to make it worth attempting to do that. He has great athleticism but his basketball IQ is abysmally low.  I watched every single game this year and for most of them it was a lot of head shaking and scratching toward Faried. He can be a really great player when he's playing against someone smaller than him, because he'll crash the boards on both ends of the floor. That is honestly his only upside at this point, and motor alone isn't enough to stick in a starting line-up. I see him as a great off the bench guy but it's clear that he would not be okay with that, and if we just gave him 50mil a year it's not like we're about to make that call either.  I really hope Faried can grow into a better player though, I think he has the ability to do it, but the way that the game is trending towards right now and the fact that he hasn't particularly improved after 4 years in the league makes me incredibly wary of that contract."
denvernuggets,36krgx,ParadeShitter,1 point,Wed May 20 07:27:59 2015 UTC,"I think he's worth his money if we play to his strengths which Karl did and Shaw did not. We'd probably just go back and forth on if he's worth keeping.  Say we do shop him, who would you replace him with?   It's a difficult question. Bigs rarely come in with top tier skill sets and often take time to reach. Is a draftee, joffrey or jokic ready for that? Hickson has similar issues to faried and is probably best left as a role player. Deandre Jordan is probably the only upgrade in hustle guys but only in that he's larger. Bringing in someone in the opposite mould could present its own problems. A Zach randlolph or lamarcus Aldridge type would suffer against the clippers, warriors or our own higher tempo games.   *a Chris bosh or Anthony Davis type maybe but they're not common."
denvernuggets,36krgx,sadboy1337,1 point,Wed May 20 08:17:31 2015 UTC,"I'll take the most average of players if they can defend their position, defend the pick and roll, and hit above 70% on their FTs over Faried. Draymond Green will be a FA after this year, but unless we could find a way to get Faried out of Denver there's not a way we could realistically grab him, but, that is the kind of player I'd want."
denvernuggets,36kzms,aatencio91,6,Wed May 20 03:57:50 2015 UTC,"It really depends. I mean, we can grab Mario Hezonja or Stanley Johnson and have them fill in at the 2 or the 3 relatively easily.  Giving us a depth chart of:  Lawson/Nelson/Green  Barton/Harris/Foye/Hezonja or Johnson  Gallinari/Chandler/Barton/Hezonja or Johnson  Faried/Chandler/Hickson/Lauvergne/Jokic*   Nurkic/Jokic*/Hickson/Lauvergne  *Assuming he comes over...  And I think that's a pretty fucking good team.  That said, I am not sure how all the salary will work out. We're probably going to cut a few peeps."

denvernuggets,36kzms,pairidaeza,1 point,Wed May 20 06:12:42 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't count on Ty being around for next year, he seems to be doing just about everything he can to get traded and didn't seem to care at all after the trade deadline last year. Also, Will Barton should not start. Fun energy guy off the bench but definitely not a starter."
denvernuggets,36kzms,imhandy,5,Wed May 20 14:35:42 2015 UTC,"What if we traded back (or out)? I'm not sure I under protections fully but I think we have 3 firsts next year. Maybe we let the roster as it stands show what it's worth (Harris, green, jokic and Lauvergne in particular). It doesn't seem like we need a deeper roster unless we have ""the guy"". Adding a 2016 & 2017 first would give us a lot freedom as contracts coe off the books and I doubt one rookie makes us  the team we want to be unless the team is already worth its salt.  Anyway what do you guys think a 7 th would go for?  *A Lakers fan in another post argues that we should really break everything down and that's definitely an option."
denvernuggets,36kzms,rvhack,4,Wed May 20 06:35:53 2015 UTC,"Ya never know. Steph Curry was the 7th overall in his draft. He is the key piece on a championship contender this year.  Having said that, Corey brewer was also 7th overall and he is a role player. I'd take a chance and draft a skilled player."

denvernuggets,36j8dh,IdRatherBeLurking,10,Tue May 19 20:04:06 2015 UTC,From Nylon Calculus:  Chance to win lottery: 4.3%  Chance that Faried makes 3 mid-range jumpers in a row: 4.4%  Don't think about that too hard.
denvernuggets,36j8dh,tron777,7,Tue May 19 21:27:15 2015 UTC,"For comparison's sake, Chris Paul has a 12% chance of hitting three mid range jumpers in a row which is about the same chance as the Lakers winning the lottery. Darrell Arthur had an 8% chance of hitting three in a row last year which is similar odds to the Magic winning the lottery."

denvernuggets,36j8dh,THECHUNGAWANGA,2,Wed May 20 02:20:17 2015 UTC,"Touche.  Although, he is 6 foot 7.5 inches tall... and Johnson has an almost 7-foot wingspan."

denvernuggets,36j8dh,Futurebrain,3,Wed May 20 02:51:31 2015 UTC,Johnson isnt as skilled as Hezonja from what i have seen however. Definitely has the physical advantage though

denvernuggets,36jlrb,rickythepirate,5,Tue May 19 21:30:42 2015 UTC,"Denver 100% needs to rebuild unless they suddenly land a superstar player from somewhere.  The problem is that there seems to be no communication between the Front Office and coaches. The front office has said that its time to rebuild, our coaches Shaw and Hunt refused to give young players minutes and tried to win by playing veterans."
denvernuggets,36jlrb,eathbau,1 point,Tue May 19 22:53:07 2015 UTC,"Ideally, if the front office choses to strip it down and go full rebuild, make that intention clear to their next coach.  Are there any candidates being talked about a lot?"

denvernuggets,36jlrb,pairidaeza,1 point,Wed May 20 01:45:31 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  I don't think it would be a good fit for Gentry, at this point he's done his time as both a head and assistant coach.  He's definitely put in his dues and has earned another shot, but if I were him I'd be smart about picking the next team rather than just pick the first job available.  He's apparently interviewing for New Orleans which would be better, and personally I'd choose Orlando over Denver if both options are on the table.  It might even be worth it for him to stick it out another year and hope Washington or someplace better becomes available.    As disappointed as I was with D'Antoni's time in LA I think I'd endorse him for your opening.  Part of his problem in LA was the team didn't fit his style and he refuse to adapt to the players we had.  If he and the front office were on the same page and the roster was built for his system it could work.  His fast pace offense would take advantage of your home court's altitude advantage.  I don't think he'd turn your roster into a contender next year, but he'd get a lot more out of it and you wouldn't have to do a complete rebuild because your cap is pretty good after next year. You wouldn't need to trade Ty then, he'd be great in that offense.  He's got my endorsement for the job!"

denvernuggets,367y5w,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Sun May 17 01:10:36 2015 UTC,"A nice player, but he's getting too big a bump from the tournament. His offense reminds me a bit of Derrick Williams' (from Arizona)- combo forward who was too quick for 4s and too strong for wings, high 3PT% but has slow, unorthodox mechanics, good athlete and rebounder, has to transition to a full-time perimeter role as a pro. He'll be ready from Day 1 defensively, Russell/Hezonja/Johnson are ahead on offense. The coaching philosophy and depth chart would have to change a lot for it to make sense to take him."
denvernuggets,367y5w,ispeaksdattruth,4,Sun May 17 05:00:04 2015 UTC,I like Johnson's length over his too. dat 7ft wingspan
denvernuggets,367y5w,The_NGUYENNER,3,Sun May 17 06:51:41 2015 UTC,i am so on the SJ bandwagon
denvernuggets,367y5w,bettycrockerpot,2,Sun May 17 06:56:36 2015 UTC,I'm hoping we draft him or Stanley Johnson this draft. We need another 3 and D guy to back up Gallo
denvernuggets,367y5w,trentyz,3,Sun May 17 12:13:10 2015 UTC,"If we draft SJ I'd want him to start at the 2. I want a starter with this lotto pick, not just a backup."
denvernuggets,367y5w,The_NGUYENNER,2,Sun May 17 21:52:49 2015 UTC,Agreed. A backcourt of Lawson and Johnson would be real nice.
denvernuggets,3636w5,aatencio91,9,Fri May 15 18:40:17 2015 UTC,"Tom Thibodeau, owner of the Thibbsdale Thibbadome."
denvernuggets,3636w5,KyleCrysCologne,11,Sat May 16 01:41:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's that good of a fit. We saw what happened trying to fit a square peg in a round hole with Brian Shaw. Obviously Thibs is a much better coach, but I think we need a different kind of coach.   I also don't think he'd come here anyway. The Pelicans job is clearly more attractive right now."
denvernuggets,3636w5,GorillaBuddy,6,Fri May 15 19:00:32 2015 UTC,That's kind of how I see it. I'd love to have Thibs because I think he's a top 5 coach in the NBA but our roster isn't suited to be defensive minded (unfortunately) and the Pelicans squad is a lot-lot-lot more appealing.
denvernuggets,3636w5,OkAutopilot,2,Fri May 15 19:04:17 2015 UTC,"Just a thought, but was the Chicago roster defensive-minded when Thibs arrived?"
denvernuggets,3636w5,pairidaeza,5,Mon May 18 00:35:44 2015 UTC,"Orlando too.  Orlando and NO both have great young talent, a good coach can do wonders there.  I think NO is a safe choice and Orlando is a little more dark horse, but it is the East.  I really don't see him coming to Denver.  There are no building blocks in place and it's the much tougher West.  Disclosure- I am an Orlando fan too"
denvernuggets,3636w5,Mayor_Of_Onett,5,Fri May 15 18:49:22 2015 UTC,"Is there really a lack of building blocks in Denver? The Nuggets have a ton of draft picks and some good young (and younger) talent in guys like Nurkic, Gallo, Joffrey, etc."
denvernuggets,3636w5,vtmn_D,4,Fri May 15 18:51:55 2015 UTC,"This as well as Jokic coming over (if drafted this year many think a top ten worthy talent), a likely 7th pick in the draft, possible Ty Lawson is a trade piece, the Knicks first round pick next year — this team is probably going to get younger going forward… doesn't mean Thibs is interested or even a good fit, but I disagree with the above assertion as well."
denvernuggets,3636w5,ParadeShitter,3,Fri May 15 19:58:35 2015 UTC,should give him a look although i'm not sure denver is a more desirable place than orlanda (tax haven) or NO (AD).  i see that some people want to basically recreate what george karl did.... sans george karl. that course of action seems a bit confusing

denvernuggets,3636w5,utw,2,Tue May 19 01:58:48 2015 UTC,"Thibodeau garners more respect than Shaw but I think the roster as is would have the same problems with him. We're just not a half court, defensive minded team. It's a poor fit.  I can't see why Thibodeau would pick us, either. He has his pick of us, NO, and Orlando. We have potentially the most work to do to get back to the playoffs, the most baggage, and the least amount of pieces he would like."
denvernuggets,3636w5,trentyz,2,Sun May 17 03:48:06 2015 UTC,"Thibodeau is a defensive-minded coach, and the Nuggets have been an offensive-based team since we joined the NBA. It's a no from me."

Our GM is in way over his head and picked that terrible fit to be our coach, and now we're relying on this guy to rebuild the team and bring in another coach.  Our owner is inept and doesn't have a clue how to run a team.  We went from a franchise best 57 win season two years ago to our current bottom dwelling 52 loss season.  Our ""best"" player and team leader got arrested for (another) DUI after a charity event in the middle of the season.  Oh, and couldn't be bothered to make it back from Las Vegas on time after the All-Star break ended.  He's also posted that he wished he played for the Mavericks after posting that he's a Nugget for life...  Most of our players hardly ever play up to their potential.  Our most untouchable player who we will most likely build around is a 6' 11"" Bosnian rookie who's really only been playing basketball for about 5 years, gets in early foul trouble and is very very raw and rough around the edges.  We played terribly, but not terribly enough to profit in the draft.  We couldn't even tank correctly because our interim head coach had to prove something.  No stars want to play here, and our owner won't open his wallet to bring in top caliber talent.  Yet we'll way way overspend on oft-injured names that you won't hear outside of Denver.    On the plus side, our potential is insane, and with a good head coach (say Monty Williams) who can bring the best out of our players, we can compete with anybody.  If we play this draft right (which we hardly ever do-usually we go for an unproven euro who's killing it against 2nd rate talent), we'll be two years away from being two years away from being competitive.  I'd like to say the worst is behind us...  Sadly, though, with the disarray we are in, I believe it's still going to get worse before it gets better.    Welcome aboard!  Go Nuggets!!"
denvernuggets,35n4jv,chucho320,0,Wed May 13 16:11:14 2015 UTC,"Our GM is in way over his head and picked that terrible fit to be our coach   First, what makes you think Connelly is over his head? He's seemed completely competent in everything I've read about him, heard him say, and seen him do. A lot of the things you point out are clearly attributed to Kroenke's direction for the team- such as Picking up Hickson and Foye, or hiring Shaw.   He's exactly the GM we need right now- someone who's area of focus is scouting, and someone who clearly has the ability to recognize talent.   Whether or not Ty show's up, he's still the best player on the roster. No need for quotation marks. He's also not the team leader- Gallinari is, and everyone knows it.  I don't fault him for never meeting the expectations of the FO, because it's simply not who he is. They tried, and it just didn't work.    but not terribly enough to profit in the draft.   Considering the talent around the #7 spot, and considering that we have a 15% chance at a top 3 pick (best in a decade), I'd say we're sitting pretty good. We could have done ""better"", but it's not all doom and gloom up in the Can.    we'll be two years away from being two years away from being competitive.   I'll take the glass-half-full approach here- prepare for a long sentence. In two years time: Nurkic will be 3 years in, Jokic will be 2 years, Chandler and Gallo will be hitting their peak, Harris will be 3 years in and hopefully making shots, our draft pick this season will have a year under his belt, we'll have the Knicks pick next year (can't imagine them out playing us), potentially another lottery pick, The Blazer's 2016 first round pick, The Grizzlies 2017 1st round pick, all on the books in the next two years. And that's without speculating on us trading Ty or Faried."
denvernuggets,35n4jv,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Wed May 13 16:58:28 2015 UTC,"We can agree to disagree.  I appreciate your optimism.  Gallinari is our team leader and everyone knows it?  Does Gallo know it?!  Sure, he played some of his best ball there at the end of the season, but what has he done to be a leader?  Being the top scorer a few times does not a leader make.    Pretty much everything Connelly has done-including his track record with the Wizards and Hornets who were only competitive once he left-makes me think he's in over his head.  What were his first moves here?  Bringing in Shaw and bringing back Afflalo.  What other moves has he made that say this guy is in it to win it?  Our trade deadline moves were underwhelming at best.  Trading for conditional picks aren't exactly fist pumping moves.    No, it's not all doom and gloom, but we're not looking at being competitive for quite awhile.  Unless we really bring some names in.  Like maybe Chauncey in a front office position, if anything for name alone to inspire and give us some cred, which we have zero of right now.  Pat Bowlen knew what he was doing when the Broncos were in disarray after the McDummy fiasco, and he knew Elway would bring the clout needed to pull us out of that hell.  The Nuggets are a rudderless ship with no names and no clout.  Don't kid yourself, Lurk, the #7 pick isn't going to be a game changer.  We'll need a lot more help than that and conditional picks."
denvernuggets,35n4jv,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Wed May 13 17:13:37 2015 UTC,"Sounds good to me! Ha.  Gallo really stepped up to that roll at the end of the season.   While I'd like to have Chauncey in the clubhouse, I'm pretty skeptical of the ""bring in old player to fix team"" trend that we've seen in Colorado over the last few years. John Elway has been the only real success story for that method, and that's because Elway is damn good at his job- not just because he's John Elway."

I think joining this subreddit really helped me enjoy the sport more than when I was just casually watching it.   As others have mentioned, we're in a bit of a rebuild. The draft in July is a big day for us- we should be bringing in some fresh talent.   In terms of the Nuggets, they're almost always an entertaining team to watch. Because of the altitude, we've pretty much committed to playing super fast, high-flying ball. Last season was really tough because the lockeroom situation had turned toxic thanks to Brian Shaw and his thugs.   I'm about to take my math final, but I'll drop back to give you a run-down on players to watch!"

denvernuggets,35n4jv,DtownAndOut,2,Mon May 11 23:34:24 2015 UTC,"Yes it is. Our play style used to be really heavy in transition, and we would just run teams who weren't used to the altitude into the ground. With Shaw we kind of got away from that, but at the end of the season we went back to that play style."

denvernuggets,35n4jv,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Tue May 12 02:11:26 2015 UTC,"Shaw's main problem was that he couldn't build any chemistry with the team and ended up with a bunch of players who didn't put any effort in on the court. It's hard to judge his talent as a X and O guy from his time in Denver, but he is definitely not a players coach for the team he had. I admit there were a lot of rotations and in-bound plays that had me scratching my head though.  Also be prepared to be baffled by the front office's decisions."

In today's NBA it's growing more and more scary to choose any non-center that can't shoot the three. Russell has already proved that he can shoot the three and score efficiently. His offense game comes fully formed. If he can be even an average defender I think he will be a huge asset to whoever drafts him.   That said, he's a lefty, which is very confusing for me to watch having never had a left hand to speak of myself."
denvernuggets,35lzqz,tron777,2,Mon May 11 19:44:34 2015 UTC,"I agree, he just seems like he has more of an X factor. Mudiay does have great physical tools but Russell just seems like a natural. The kid is special."

He seemed pretty clear that we are in no position to draft for need. I could see us trading up for him (or him potentially falling to us), but trading up is no easy task and can easily cost you more than it was worth.   If SAC gets a top #3 pick, I could definitely see us trading Lawson there and targeting Russell. Otherwise, he's probably out of our reach unless we get that #3 pick specifically- I think the Nuggets will take Towns or Okafor if they get a top 2 pick.."

denvernuggets,35by2w,Niehaus,3,Fri May 8 21:03:14 2015 UTC,"You may remember me from word clouds I made in every MLB, Soccer, NHL, NBA, and NFL team subreddit for their last respective seasons, or my Swears/Subscriber Breakdown by for states/cities/regional subreddits and my previous sports profanity breakdown. I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."

If we had the cap space I think 6 for Lawson would be a fine trade considering his contract and how top-heavy the draft is.  I mean, this is why I'm saying Landry+6 for Lawson works, because you guys could need a backup big that can score and save about $4M if you also sign your draft pick. We'd get Lawson and strengthen our bench by putting Collison in the backup slot, or the emergency 2 spot."
denvernuggets,354g86,with2nns,2,Thu May 7 16:58:46 2015 UTC,"If the Nuggets have valued Lawson at two 1st-round picks, how does Landry or McCallum make up for a 1st round pick alone?

denvernuggets,354858,greece666,5,Wed May 6 23:38:59 2015 UTC,"I'll defend Chris Andersen's amnesty. It has nothing to do with his investigation. I have no idea if that was a factor in the Nuggets' minds, it could have been, but Chris also didn't contribute much that year, anyway. He was injured or coming off injury, looked pretty bad when he did play, and sunk to the bottom of the depth chart. It would've been a natural assumption that with his bad year and play style that he might be on the way down. The Nuggets thought they had a solid rotation in Mozgov, Koufos and McGee. Chris was just the odd man out.  The article is also mistaken in that we simply couldn't amnesty JaVale. Before he re-signed his contract, JaVale wasn't a bust yet. He played well enough for a second look so it would have been a waste of the Nene trade to give up on him. If we were that down on him, we could've just let his contract run out. And the amnesty only applies to contracts signed before the CBA, so it would be void if applied to JaVale after he re-signed.   The worst thing about JaVale is ultimately that we re-signed him for as much as we did, not the trade itself or that we didn't thoretically amnesty him instead of Birdman. If he re-signed for even a few million less I would call it a fair deal.  Hickson, as well. There was never a redundancy conflict with Faried because he was never intended to be a starter at center next to him. He was supposed to be a backup  to Kenneth and bench piece, that's all.  True about everything with the Iguodala trade, at least.  It's worth noting our former Executuve of the Year as the writer points out is at least partially responsible for two of these moves. That's not intended to be a knock, since he was great for us, but he made his errors. The current management made their mistakes...lots of them, but we were behind the 8 ball long before then.   Personally I like the job Connelly has done to attempt to right the ship. I don't think Hickson was a mistake, necessarily, as he, Nate, and Foye were intended to be complementary pieces on what they thought would be a competitive team. Everyone was fine with Afflalo for Fournier. And I think he got good value for Afflalo and Mozgov. I think Josh is earnest, as well. He wants to win, but altogether we just put the cart before the horse, so to speak, in regards to Shaw, our philosophy and team makeup, and it didn't pan out."
denvernuggets,354858,utw,3,Thu May 7 01:56:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with this on so many points. This article was bad for so many reasons.   Masai Ujiri was not ever, for any reason coming back to Denver. Denver attempted more than once to counter with a better offer and Masai finally told Josh Kroenke not to bother. Ujiri LOVED Toronto and there was no $ amount that would change that. Josh really tried to keep him. George Karl should have been fired. He has EIGHT years to get his team out of the first round and did it ONCE!  Ujiri even built a star-less team for Karl and it didn't make a difference.  Josh wanted to win championships and Karl had 8 years to do it. Chris Andersen was a waste of space and useless for 90% of his time in Denver after the 2009 season. He signed a big contract and couldn't stay healthy, much like JaVale McGee.  They had to get rid of him. It's sad but true, because I really liked him and loved how he turned his life around. Kosta Koufos was a solid, though not spectacular center. Everyone knew Mozgov had a much higher ceiling, yet Moz was wasting away on the bench under Karl. Remember how Koufos got destroyed by Andrew Bynum and Pau Gasol in the playoffs in 2012? He had no edge and wasn't physical.   Things HAD to change IMO in 2013. The Nuggets were embarrassed in the playoffs that year and George Karl was clearly out coached by Mark freaking Jackson! Mark Jackson everyone!  It stinks they tumbled so far and obviously Brian Shaw wasn't the answer, but they'll do fine and get back to respectability."

Not to mention Koufos being bullied by Bogut and the Warriors in 2013 while Mozgov sat on the bench. For a team that made the playoffs every year and had high expectations, I think the Warriors series made him expendable. Say what you will about Arthur but he was intended to bring something we desperately needed in the frontcourt, good man to man and PnR defense and a stretch option on offense at PF."
denvernuggets,354858,utw,0,Fri May 8 01:08:33 2015 UTC,"A decent read but the article makes the erroneous assumption that we drafted Gobert. As touched on here by /u/utw, there simply was no trade mistake to make since Utah drafted him with our pick."
denvernuggets,354858,pairidaeza,2,Thu May 7 00:33:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we certainly could have picked him, but mid to low 20s on down is such a crapshoot. This was also pre-injury JaVale, pre-drama Nuggets, etc. They were just a few months removed from a 57 win team so their priority that draft was low risk stash picks like Green and Lauvergne and the jury is out on them, but they still have promise."
denvernuggets,354858,utw,1 point,Thu May 7 02:22:41 2015 UTC,"It's called opportunity cost. If we didn't trade the pick, it's safe to use the Gobert pick and it's value as the assumed value of the pick.  Officially, it was the Nuggets that made the draft pick, even if they already had agreed that a trade would be made after the draft. Sure, after Gobert was drafted and before Erick Green was, we couldn't have backed out of the deal. But, it doesn't change the fact that the deal was not a good one."
denvernuggets,354858,NUGGman,1 point,Fri May 8 18:38:29 2015 UTC,The Nuggets still drafted him. The point is that he was available with that selection and they traded him away for Erick Green basically.
denvernuggets,354858,courtsideseatz,1 point,Thu May 7 00:50:24 2015 UTC,"It makes sense to me.   Just the same, we can compare Nurkic and Harris to Doug McDermott to decide whether that was a good trade.Nobody is going to say you can't compare them because the Nuggets weren't the ones who chose McDermott, because that's a stupid argument. He was who was selected with that pick, so assuming the pick wasn't a mistake the value of the pick and the value of the player are the same."
denvernuggets,352g5c,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Wed May 6 15:26:54 2015 UTC,"i can't think of any trade at the moment where denver would get at least equal value for ty. i think they're better off just holding out for the time being. they got him for at least the next 2 seasons so there's no reason to unload a productive player who's playing.  i think the divide is exaggerated. teams have guys who the front office likes, guys who the coaches like and sometimes the players aren't liked by both parties. no reason to jump to conclusions and unload him for a couple ""meh"" draft picks. you're not going to draft somebody better than what ty will produce over the next 2 seasons."

denvernuggets,352g5c,chucho320,3,Wed May 6 16:03:44 2015 UTC,"The numbers are fine and all, but the bottom line is Ty isn't a finisher.  He doesn't have ice in his veins and he doesn't want the ball in his hands in the last minute of a game.  He's not a go to guy and rarely does he play an entire 4 quarters.  There are many reasons he's not and never will be an All-Star.  It's too bad NY doesn't have a better pick to trade us.  He deserves to play for and keep them the worst team in the NBA."

denvernuggets,34wdp6,utw,4,Tue May 5 09:49:47 2015 UTC,"But I hate the Rockets as a whole. Harden + Howard + Josh Smith? Gross.  But on that note I almost never root for any other teams if we aren't in and can barely tolerate anyone else in the west anyway. Just not that type of fan; I hold too much resentment and hate in me when it comes to teams that aren't mine in sports. Everyone else can screw themselves. Well, I was at least hoping the Spurs would move on from the west since I dislike them the least of whoever was left, but alas.  I think the Warriors are a given now, so I can only hope Chicago or Cleveland can move on, even though I want the Wizards to make it out, since I think they're the only ones that can conceivably beat GSW. I don't necessarily want Cleveland to win, but I'll take it so long as the Warriors don't. Hawks would be cool, but I doubt it."
denvernuggets,34wdp6,chucho320,4,Tue May 5 16:40:07 2015 UTC,"I almost always root for former Nuggets.  I like watching Nene, Andre Miller (I know he's a King now, go GK!), Brew, Mozzy (FOR Mozzy but against the Cavs), Kosta Koufos and Aaron Brooks succeed.  Unless their name is Melo, Iguodala or Shaqtin a fool McGee, I'm in their corner.  I won't be rooting for Ty once we're rid of him either."

denvernuggets,34tnup,wefr5927,6,Mon May 4 22:20:25 2015 UTC,I WOULD LOVE WINSLOW.  He plays excellent defense and he's extremely clutch
denvernuggets,34tnup,vdowd,2,Mon May 4 23:47:21 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, he'd fit the team perfectly."
denvernuggets,34tnup,imhandy,6,Tue May 5 01:17:41 2015 UTC,"Getting Justise Winslow would be the best case scenario for the Nuggets. The dude is a tireless defender, reminds me a bit of Artest.  Plus he hasn't even scratched the surface of his potential offensively.  Best all around wing in the draft IMO. At this point I would be surprised if he isn't gone before we pick.  Don't forget we could get lucky in the lottery and be higher than 7th."
denvernuggets,34tnup,The_NGUYENNER,3,Tue May 5 01:31:04 2015 UTC,"I'd be a bit surprised if he was there for us to draft (assuming we stay at 7). Draft Express has him going at 5, which seems more likely than Chad Ford's prediction of him falling a bit lower. That said, if he's available, the Nuggets would be wise to grab him. If not, I think we swing for the fences and draft Hezonja; he has a unique blend of skills, shooting, and athleticism. Plus, I'm not sold on Gary Harris at the two so it could be fun to see those two compete for the starting spot."
denvernuggets,34tnup,FugaYouDorphin,3,Mon May 4 14:11:41 2015 UTC,Winslow is awesome! He's in my big 3 with Russell and Hezonja. I also think Stanley Johnson has become underrated due to the tournament. He's a very similar prospect imo.

denvernuggets,34ndb8,utw,1 point,Mon May 4 02:27:46 2015 UTC,"Pretty decent way to describe the Iguodala debacle. Although, Jackson didn't say that anybody told him the Nuggets were playing dirty. He inferred that. The only thing he directly quoted from the ""mole"" (we all agree is probably Iguodala) is that he doesn't like that brand of basketball and didn't cosign on it. You can just as easily assume that Iguodala had a conversation with Jackson as simple as Jackson accusing the Nuggets of playing dirty and Iguodala responding, ""I don't play dirty.""   Either way, it's obvious that the person to be hated from that series is Mark Jackson. He recklessly threw around accusations that were unfounded and wasn't fined for it, when he should have been. Apparently, you can't criticize a ref, but you can accuse an entire team and coaching staff of playing dirty.  I can only think of one person George Karl has ever called Busch League and it's not Iguodala. It's Mark Jackson.  link"

It's hard to say we got fleeced if we never had him. Nearly any draft night trade is a pick swap with one team telling another who to pick.

Ideally and possibly ironically someone like in the mold of javale mcgee. We would probably have been ok if we had kept mozgov and paired him with nurk.  I think Joffrey has good mobility and defensive talent but at 240 he's a bit light and we'd probably have similar issues with him at center that we did with jj. He's not as short but he'd surely struggle defending  demarcus cousins, dwight howard or any of the larger (in the 270 range) centers in the league. Nikola Jokic is a bit heavier but from this anlysis he would struggle to keep up athletically while still being a bit underweight. I'm sure they'll both get stronger over time but we could do with a defensive minded seven footer. Often times having a great paint presence means your perimeter defenders can be a lot more effective and aggressive.  Two: A defensive minded guard: Someone with the size and hopefully the athleticism to contend with opposing scorers at the 1 and 2.  Size is the important thing here though as we have quicker guards. Think back to our playoff series with the lakers. Corey brewer was fast and long enough, but lacked the bulk to really bother kobe.  At the two I'm not terribly uncomfortable with Gary (6'4"" 205) and Randy (6'4"" 213) at the helm assuming Gary can come in to his own. That would likely mean not bringing in a veteran two guard. That would only stunt whatever growth gary is making. He seems to be a good defender and I've seen many more players fix a shot than I have learn to play defense. Bringing in a larger guard wouldn't hurt at all. Gary may improve with competition, the competition may prove to be better than gary and I can't say how long randy (age 31) stays going in to his final contact year. .  I doubt we take a point guard unless we move/plan to move ty. Similar situation at either forward spot: Wilson and Gallo are arguably two of the best wings we could have short of a Kevin Durant or Lebron James, Kenneth is looking to be the peak of his archetype and there are two other hybrid bigs (not including hickson) behind him.  To summarize, I think/hope we take a shooting guard or a center. If it's a shooting guard I hope it's a larger, defensively capable guy. If it's a center, a rim protector so that nurk not being on the floor doesn't ruin our defense. I'm not a college ball guy so I can't point out who that might exactly be with spending another hour studying the top of the draft class, although I may do that anyway.  *tried and failed to edit for spacing"

denvernuggets,341bj6,Arrow218,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:34:13 2015 UTC,Especially Okafor in my opinion (but I'll save that for his thread!). I think we need to compile a list of All Star players that even have a potential of being traded here for something like #1+Wil+filler. I don't really have any clue who's actually available for a trade like that.
denvernuggets,33uugg,JMadFour,6,Sat Apr 25 21:08:34 2015 UTC,"Doesn't answer your question, but Gallo's been criminally underrated in 2k since '13 (and less-so in 12). Ill Will has been 5-10 ovr better than Gallo since 13 despite never being able to start over him irl."
denvernuggets,33uugg,Drizzt396,5,Sat Apr 25 21:59:23 2015 UTC,"Wing and corner threes, or run him with high post offense. He's a really good passer in 2k and a serviceable driver as well, so play pick n' roll with him and transition cheese threes as well."
denvernuggets,33uugg,OkAutopilot,3,Sat Apr 25 21:10:48 2015 UTC,"Haha what is this monster you have created?!?  Gallo is a stretch-four  player, who can both play SF and PF depending on the lineup. This allows you to play some ""small ball"", meaning that you can have a smaller player at SF with Gallo holding down the PF spot, since he is large enough to guard that position. Since there's not a ton of PFs that can shoot as well as Gallo, it can potentially create a mismatch with the opposing PFs (against a guy like Faried). This also gives you the ability to better guard another team's stretch four player (Think LaMarcus Aldridge, or LeBron James).  In terms of the type of player Gallo is, he has two main strengths: 3 point shooting, and drawing fouls from driving in the lane. With such a high free throw percentage, he's the guy you want to be taking the shots from the charity line as much as possible. Watch this highlight reel of his career-high game this season to get a better feeling for how Gallo plays.   I reckon some other people will do a much better job than me, but I hope this helps! Make sure to drop by the subreddit when the season starts :)"
denvernuggets,33uugg,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Sat Apr 25 21:24:26 2015 UTC,"This was insightful.  It seems I was indeed misusing him. I had him set as a Cutter/Midrange/Low Post type. I love ""Floppy"", its one of my favorite play types to run, and I was using Gallinari as my main Floppy Shooter, when it should probably be DeRozan. I also had him Posting up in the Low block(cause I figured he's 6'10, so why not?) with little success.  I probably should have him set as my 2nd Play Initiator after my PG.  PnR Ballhandler, High Post, and spot-up 3ball shooter.  I am hesitant to put him at the 4 for any length of time because he doesnt seem to rebound well, and that is Job #1 of my Bigs. I want to eventually play 3out 2in on Offense so my PF and C HAVE to be strong rebounders."
denvernuggets,33uugg,Snookis_Child,2,Sat Apr 25 23:56:30 2015 UTC,"Galo is best used as someone who can drive the lane, or as a knock down catch-and-shoot player. He's not much in the post. He's great at getting what look like circus shot layups to go down."
denvernuggets,33uugg,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:38:03 2015 UTC,"Stretch four:       In basketball, a stretch four (or cornerman) is a player who plays in the power forward position. ""Stretch"" describes the effect such a player has on the opposition defense, and the power forward position is also known as the ""four position""; hence ""stretch four"". The stretch four is a fairly recent innovation in the NBA (with an ""explosion""  of players coming through since the 1999-2000 season),  but is still becoming increasingly common in today's game, as many NBA coaches now utilize the ""small-ball"" line-up/tactical play.

denvernuggets,33uugg,Snookis_Child,2,Sat Apr 25 22:29:24 2015 UTC,"You're not necessarily wrong, just that article is nonsense. He can play the 4/PF or ""stretch 4"" playing small ball I will give you that but he is still a 3/SF. The 4/PF will post up down low, with the stretch being able to also swing outside to shoot the three on offense when need be. The 3/SF typically will play around the top of the key or baseline perimeter, being able to slash or get open for a three which is exactly what Galo is. He's a slasher/catch-and-shoot kind of player."

I am considering starting MyGM over, and not blowing them up this time. Or was blowing them up the right thing to do anyway?  I may still trade Faried in Season 2 when his contract goes nuts. Maybe. I changed JJ Hickson's main position to PF and he rebounded almost as well.  I'll give Faried a serious try before I consider trading though, his Post Fade his pretty money for me. Why is Hickson a C anyway at 6'9?  And lawd, I need to get a SG, Randy Foye's 72ovr doesnt need to be starting anywhere."

Everyone should be on the table except Ty, Harris, green, chandler, gallo, lauverne, and nurkic. Prioritize trading for picks, but take good deals on players with long, cheap contracts that can develop or are at least 72 for your bench. If they are young, focus on increasing player moral and loyalty. Faried is a sell high player, trade asap. Hickson is terrible IRL and in the game, get rid of him ASAP. With a couple of increase potential training camps on Gary Harris he can become a 2 way star, invest in him, same with erick green. You'll need to find a better coach as well.

denvernuggets,33ntzs,tron777,3,Fri Apr 24 18:04:23 2015 UTC,"He's 7 foot and he did just fine against Towns and Okafor. His lack of quickness makes him more suited to center.  Do you want him guarding Bogut or Draymond? Horford or Millsap? Anthony Davis or Asik? Blake or Deandre? In most cases I'm picking the center because he's going to be too slow of foot to deal with the 4s. I think he'll end up playing more C than PF, even early on. Not that he'll be good at defense at either position."

denvernuggets,33i1lt,Young_Sleazy,2,Wed Apr 22 19:07:04 2015 UTC,Over Orlando?  Money will also undoubtedly play a roll as well.
denvernuggets,33i1lt,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Wed Apr 22 19:51:22 2015 UTC,"I mean if we don't hire Brooks, were competing with OKC for candidates, and OKC is a better job."
denvernuggets,33i1lt,Young_Sleazy,2,Wed Apr 22 21:26:47 2015 UTC,"This is a very good point. We can take the upper hand in the division if we land Brooks. Then again, there are Thunder fans that don't rate him..."
denvernuggets,33i1lt,pairidaeza,2,Thu Apr 23 00:05:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think we should hire Brooks either. I like D'antoni, but if I'm him and I get offers from both Denver and OKC, I'm taking the better front office, the better players, sadly the better fans, and most likely the better money."

denvernuggets,33i1lt,B-Horny,5,Mon Apr 27 13:54:47 2015 UTC,"'12 they went to the finals in westbrook's third year. '13 westbrook basically missed the playoffs. '14 they ran into a better spurs team and this year they were destroyed by injuries.  i agree he's not the best x's and o's coach and he wouldn't be on top of my list but, given the circumstances, i'm not sure he underachieved all that much. i think people put too much stock in championships. a lot of other factors at play. playing against lebron is one. playing against arguably the best coach ever is another. 2 mvp candidates ≠ 1 mvp. i think he'll prove his worth in the coming years."
denvernuggets,33i1lt,ParadeShitter,6,Wed Apr 22 19:21:57 2015 UTC,not to mention james harden turned out to be pretty good too

I was under the impression that he was a huge factor in OKC becoming what they've been in the last few years, but I don't know nearly enough to think that definitively.

denvernuggets,33i1lt,chucho320,2,Thu Apr 23 13:04:01 2015 UTC,And Durant.
denvernuggets,33hqxo,chazoid,7,Wed Apr 22 16:53:03 2015 UTC,"The most sensible hire.  The best system for this particular roster at this particular time at this particular place. The fastest up tempo style with a young energetic roster in a high-altitude physically taxing environment. Denver would not be a fun place to be for the away team under any circumstances.  D'Antoni is also great at getting the most out of young players that have had little to moderate success. In terms of player management, he seems to struggle with the superstar egos of the NBA, which makes Denver a good spot to be since the Nuggets don't have egos the sizes of Howard, Anthony or Bryant.  Most of all I want to see what Pringles has learned from his past two stints as coach in an environment and team that is suited for his style of play."
denvernuggets,33hqxo,TheRealMindGamez,5,Wed Apr 22 22:14:40 2015 UTC,"As many have said, the job is probably his if he wants it."
denvernuggets,33hqxo,IdRatherBeLurking,6,Wed Apr 22 16:58:07 2015 UTC,really not sold on d'antoni. i know everyone who played for him thinks he's one of basketball's great minds and they're probably right. he did a lot for the offensive game in his 5 years in pheonix.  but so what? once your secret is out than what's next? i don't see how a 63 year old coach who wasn't very good at his last 2 stops and hasn't been good in almost 10 years is the answer to the nuggets coaching needs. there are so many other more interesting and intriguing hires that denver could make. guys with more possible potential. guys like melvin hunt
denvernuggets,33hqxo,ParadeShitter,5,Wed Apr 22 18:33:22 2015 UTC,I agree. I'm not sold based on his last two stints.
denvernuggets,33hqxo,utw,2,Wed Apr 22 18:50:21 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, this team is tailored more towards his system than the Lakers and Knicks were."
denvernuggets,33hqxo,with2nns,3,Wed Apr 22 21:28:32 2015 UTC,"It is. And in fairness he was successful with the Knicks pre-Melo. Gallinari played well under him. But he had the same problem as Shaw, shoehorning in players. His system is also reliant on three shooters while we've continued to struggle with that. He also had a way with alienating players and I'm worried the same will happen to someone like Nurk who one would think wouldn't fit his system."
denvernuggets,33hqxo,utw,4,Thu Apr 23 14:16:26 2015 UTC,All I am saying.. is give Hunt a chance.
denvernuggets,33hqxo,corybyu,4,Wed Apr 22 20:40:51 2015 UTC,Is Scott Brooks a good fit in Denver?
denvernuggets,33hqxo,aatencio91,9,Wed Apr 22 18:09:11 2015 UTC,NO
denvernuggets,33hqxo,OkAutopilot,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:27:22 2015 UTC,"Gotta do your due diligence, but I'd rather see us roll with Hunt or non-retread candidate TBD. Hunt on a 1 year trial run would be ideal, however unlikely.  D'Antoni isn't horrible, it would just be an uninspired hire to me. His 7SOL system in Phoenix was awesome, but remember the personnel he was working with. Meh with player friction issues elsewhere like has been discussed.  I also think the issue of compensation gives Hunt and other lesser knowns a better chance than some might think. D'Antoni would be fairly expensive, and we all know how Kroenke feels about paying coaches and execs."

denvernuggets,33hqxo,OkAutopilot,3,Wed Apr 22 18:27:16 2015 UTC,Mind explaining why?
denvernuggets,33hqxo,OkAutopilot,5,Wed Apr 22 18:36:45 2015 UTC,"As I said in another thread, he is an extraordinarily poor x's and o's coach, some of the least inspired offensive sets I've ever seen. He's essentially Mark Jackson without the character issues and preacher motivation. He hasn't been able to get the best out of a team with 2 of the top 10 players, and causes them to stagnate often by his play calls and how the offense is run. It's not just that there's too many isos, which is okay with those two guys, it's that there isn't even attempts to run sets to get good shots a tenth of the time that there should be.  It's not good."
denvernuggets,33hqxo,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Wed Apr 22 19:09:23 2015 UTC,"So nothing new, just reiterating a possibility. I'm a big fan of bringing in D'Antoni, his system would be perfect here.  Here's what I'm thinking would be really awesome:   Hire D'Antoni Trade Ty Lawson to the kings for their 2015 1st round pick (plus whatever) Draft Porzingis, a quick 3 point shooting PF, and Hezonja, a great SG prospect with ""explosive speed"" (Both europeans WOO!) Acquire Jeremy Lin   If this happens, I'd be happy. We wouldn't even have to be good, I just think that team would be sooo so so so fun."
denvernuggets,33hqxo,IdRatherBeLurking,9,Wed Apr 22 17:02:45 2015 UTC,Jeremy Lin   http://i.imgur.com/o9qKvvT.gif
denvernuggets,33hqxo,with2nns,0,Wed Apr 22 17:39:33 2015 UTC,"He's a speedy guy who (I believe) would thrive in D'antoni's system, no?"
denvernuggets,33hqxo,IdRatherBeLurking,7,Wed Apr 22 18:36:17 2015 UTC,"I was just being a bit hyperbolic. I don't think we need another backup PG- of we trade Ty, then we're bound to draft a PG and Jameer is more than capable of starting."
denvernuggets,33hqxo,teensonacid,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:59:26 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if Jameer walks, especially if we go full rebuild."

denvernuggets,33hqxo,OkAutopilot,4,Wed Apr 22 19:11:00 2015 UTC,Yup. I want Jameer here as long as he wants to be.
denvernuggets,33hqxo,with2nns,3,Wed Apr 22 21:02:14 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't understand the fascination with Jeremy Lin. I've heard it from a few people now.   I'd have thought if you wan't a speedy guy, just stick with Lawson... right?"
denvernuggets,33hqxo,OkAutopilot,3,Thu Apr 23 00:41:04 2015 UTC,"Nuggets + Euro prospects = horrible history. Maybe that's not fair to them, but, we've never really hit on those so I'd rather keep it here."
denvernuggets,33hqxo,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Wed Apr 22 18:28:17 2015 UTC,"We hit on Nurkic, Jokic is looks like a nice prospect, and Fournier is turning out to be pretty good."
denvernuggets,33hqxo,OkAutopilot,3,Wed Apr 22 18:51:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know if we hit on Nurkic, sometimes he looks good, sometimes he looks completely lost. He's had limited minutes in one season, jury is not out on him whatsoever. Jokic could be a nice prospect, but we've had a lot of euro guys who looked like nice prospects who ended up being irrelevant in the league. Fournier played solid at points this season, but I wouldn't say he's a starting caliber player outside of the very bottom of the league."
denvernuggets,33hqxo,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Wed Apr 22 19:10:50 2015 UTC,"He's also 20. The kid has some extraordinary skills for that age, and I think most of the flaws we've seen will be corrected with maturity.   Gallinari, a foreign player, is a stellar player in all respects. Rudy Fernandez was good for one year."

denvernuggets,33hqxo,Lough5280,3,Thu Apr 23 18:37:49 2015 UTC,Dude.... trading Ty would be a bad move. The team would implode if we traded Ty IMHO. I think next year he will be hitting the peak of his game
denvernuggets,33exve,pairidaeza,2,Tue Apr 21 23:42:35 2015 UTC,"Man, these photos elicited every emotion on the spectrum from me. Some really high highs, and really low lows. Here's to next season."

denvernuggets,33dcha,IdRatherBeLurking,8,Tue Apr 21 16:39:07 2015 UTC,"Did he ever explain why we should trade Ty? If it's just because of his play for a handful of games this spring then I think that's incredibly reactionary, especially since he's finished 1st or 2nd on the team in Win Shares for the last 4 years. Until Gallo proves it otherwise, Ty is still our best player.   This team already doesn't have enough players that can break down a defense and draw defenders.  If the Nuggets trade Ty this offense is going in the tank and the team might as well follow it and shoot for next year's lottery.   The only way I would be actively trying to trade Ty is if we grab the number 3 pick and have a shot at Mudiay or Russell and even then I would be tempted to keep them both.  That said, everyone is on the market for the right offer but I'm not giving guys away for draft picks which are essentially lottery tickets."
denvernuggets,33dcha,tron777,2,Tue Apr 21 18:31:07 2015 UTC,"very good points. Personally, I was basing it off of his performance post-all star break."
denvernuggets,33dcha,tron777,2,Tue Apr 21 18:32:58 2015 UTC,I don't think it's a good idea to judge a player based on 30 games. Doubly so when those 30 games are an outlier to the player's overall body of work. Triply so when those games are meaningless.
denvernuggets,33dcha,chazoid,3,Tue Apr 21 18:40:36 2015 UTC,"I think the reason why I had a hard time not reacting that way is because I was comparing him to how other players finished out the season. Gallo, specifically, embodies what I wanted to see out of Ty: Willpower. I understand that Gallo had something to prove to himself whether we won or not, but I still wish Ty would have left it on the court."
denvernuggets,33dcha,IMDATBOY,6,Tue Apr 21 19:07:06 2015 UTC,"I love my boy Ty, and he has been a huge part of why I'm the Nuggets fan I am today. But after this season, I think it's clear that he needs a change of pace.   Which team do you think is the best fit for him, that also has the most to give?"
denvernuggets,33dcha,chazoid,3,Tue Apr 21 16:40:45 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of sending him to the Kings for their current 1st, Stauskas and possibly a future first? That way we could pick up both Porzingas and Hezonja :)))))"
denvernuggets,33dcha,utw,2,Tue Apr 21 17:03:59 2015 UTC,Is Stauskas any good? He didn't impress me much at the end of the season. What about McCallum?
denvernuggets,33dcha,ADinHD,5,Tue Apr 21 17:09:10 2015 UTC,"I can help here!  First and foremost, we can't offer future 1st round picks, which really sucks (stupid Maloofs).      As for Stauskas, he really sucked this year, but I'm pretty confident that he will be a good player.  His issues were rarely anything physical, as his 6'7"" size helps him make up for lost ground on speed or quickness.  Every problem he had really seemed to be due to the turbulent season with changing roles, and his own struggle to find confidence on the floor.    There was a clear difference between Stauskas when confident and Stauskas when not, and most of those problems came from his unfamiliarity with the pace, feel and nuances of the NBA game compared to college.  When he is playing confidently, he's a lot more aggressive and often creating plays for others, while also not hesitating to shoot open shots.  He's a very underrated passer, and has a very high offensive awareness.  He moves very well off the ball, which is an undervalued skill in today's game.    And as everybody knows, he can knock down shots.  The problem this year was that he second guessed a lot of shots, and it was visible in his game.  But when he's on, that shot is falling, and he has the ability to quickly/smoothly release shots off the dribble like Steph Curry.    His game has picked up a good amount since George Karl has arrived, and he's attributed his improved play to Karl's motion offense keeping him in a better rhythm as opposed to Malone's offense keeping him standing still in the corner.    Here are some of his better games, where he just seemed a lot more comfortable:   14 pts, 5 ast vs. Lakers. Some sweet playmaking here Nik helping us win on the road with 13 points in Phoenix Nik having his way with New York; 15 pts Nik with a key 15 pts and 8 rbs in a win vs. the Jazz And did I mention that he's actually athletic?     Regarding Ray McCallum, I think you guys would enjoy him a lot.  One of those guys you simply can't hate because of his energy and effort, but also with a lot of developed skills.  He's a good scoring oriented point guard with the ability to finish well at the rim.  His strength and athleticism give him the ability to consistently score And-1s and for him to explode past help defense.    His mid-range jumper is good both off the dribble and as a set shot.  He can hit set 3PT shots.  Some nights he simply cant miss from anywhere, but most nights he tends to shoot the ball less.  He's conservative and smart about how often he shoots, only overshooting when he needs to and getting others involved as much as possible.  His passing ability is really good, however sometimes he makes the type of mistakes that young point guards often make.    His defense is very good.  While you can't expect him to shut down every good point guard, he will come out and frustrate many of them.  He had a very successful game guarding Mike Conley this season where Conley was held to 13 points on bad shooting and the Kings won because of it.  He's quick, explosive, strong and tenacious, which is everything you want a point guard to be defensively.     His downsides include that his 3PT shot is lacking, especially with a little defense near him.  Give him an extra second and he'll consistently knock 3s down, but he needs to work on that.  He has a problem over overdribbling a bit, instead of getting the ball out of his hands quicker (though he does constantly look to make plays for teammates).  And he makes some really dumb turnovers every once in a while, when his youth shows.  I'm not really sure where his ceiling is right now, but at the moment his biggest downside is that he's not really elite at anything.  But at the very worst, he's a good backup point guard who's young with some good potential."

denvernuggets,332zv1,zedzed88,8,Sun Apr 19 01:00:46 2015 UTC,I think the 6th pick plus a starter would do it.  Maybe the 6th pick plus Stauskas.  I dont know much about your team so I don't know how you value your picks/players.
denvernuggets,332zv1,followthelawson,4,Sun Apr 19 01:36:54 2015 UTC,"I would love to get the 6th and McLemore. If I had to, I would include another player like a Wilson Chandler to get him.

Would you be willing to give up McLemore?"
denvernuggets,332zv1,zenbu,2,Sun Apr 19 14:09:14 2015 UTC,I think Lawson for 6th pick + Stauskus/McLemore
denvernuggets,332zv1,Lough5280,2,Wed Apr 22 19:08:42 2015 UTC,I'd trade Lawson for that pick in an instant.
denvernuggets,332zv1,damb_b,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:24:15 2015 UTC,"I like the no.6 pick. We'd probably ask for more though. Stauskas, McLemore, or McCallum, and I don't know if that's fair. Plus we'd have to take on Carl Landry to make the salaries work, more if you decide to trade McCallum which could make thing iffy. And we'd have a bit of a clogged front court.  As a side note, flipping the no. 6 and no. 7 picks for Mudiay or Russell to replace Ty would be pretty cool."
denvernuggets,332zv1,with2nns,0,Sun Apr 19 16:08:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't think it is that we think Lawson is worth more than the pick. It's that to make the trade work we have to take a bunch of crappy contracts with the pick, so you're going to have to throw in another asset to unload 10m+ of crappy contracts AND get Lawson."
denvernuggets,3306z6,mapcoveredinsap,4,Sat Apr 18 05:41:56 2015 UTC,"I'm coming in to the discussion a few days late, however I don't think Hunt is the answer going forward - he seems like a George Karl Mk. 2 and, while the basketball is fun to watch, ultimately it won't bring us the success we crave.  I think we need to make a few trades and do a rebuild.  What those trades are - I'm not too sure.  But I think going for a slightly different style of play with a fresh lineup and outlook would be terrific for the organization as a whole.  And I agree with Connelly - get the new coach in before the draft.  Let them have a really good look at the roster and who they want to draft so we can have the best chance right from the outset."
denvernuggets,3306z6,Jurrahcane,0,Mon Apr 20 08:43:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Hunt learned everything he knows about coaching from Karl, and it shows.  None of the retread coaches are going to do us any good.  Brooks, Jackson, D'antoni, these are recipes for mediocrity and/or continued disaster.  We need to try to trade Lawson and/or Faried on draft day for some more lotto picks and get this rebuild finished (and for the love of god, get rid of Foye and Hickson unless the new coach is going to relegate them to the bench and/or severely limit their minutes).  Bring Jokic over if at all possible.  As far as a coach, either see if there's a San Antonio assistant looking for a gig, or hire a college coach and start something brand new.  I feel like anything else is going to be more of the same.  The only NBA coach I can think of who is looking for a job that I would give a look to would be Mike Malone."
denvernuggets,3306z6,damb_b,2,Mon Apr 20 19:17:22 2015 UTC,"i am really surprised taht D'antoni is even in the conversation.  Between the Lakers and Knicks, what has he shown since leaving Phoenix, seriously."
denvernuggets,3306z6,treader19,4,Tue Apr 21 17:29:31 2015 UTC,"I think Hunt deserves the chance, that said, wouldn't be disappointed to see Scott Brooks return!"
denvernuggets,3306z6,DenverNick,9,Sat Apr 18 08:19:32 2015 UTC,"Please not Scott Brooks! I'm sort of warming to the idea of Mr.Pringles as I think his offense would work great in Denver, but I really think Hunt should be given the nod."
denvernuggets,3306z6,adamc25,2,Sat Apr 18 10:10:46 2015 UTC,I would be highly disappointed to see Scott Brooks anywhere near the team.
denvernuggets,3306z6,OkAutopilot,2,Sat Apr 18 17:50:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with Hunt being the head coach, especially if we are going to rebuild. If we're trying to sneak back into the playoffs mike Malone is my choice."

denvernuggets,32xhim,skipaBturner,6,Fri Apr 17 15:06:40 2015 UTC,It's possible we only end up with one pick.  The Blazers and Grizzlies picks are protected.  I'm guessing we'll get the Blazers (protected top 14). We only get the Grizzlies pick if it's in between 6-16 which has maybe a 20% chance of happening.
denvernuggets,32xhim,tron777,5,Fri Apr 17 15:52:40 2015 UTC,If the Grizz for some reason lose Gasol in free agency they'd probably be the 6-16 range. But I doubt that happens so I'm not expecting we get that pick next year. I agree we'll probably get the Blazers pick though.
denvernuggets,32xhim,Tskitishvili,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:53:55 2015 UTC,"Yep. Basically, I figure there's about a 20% chance of them losing Gasol."
denvernuggets,32xhim,tron777,5,Fri Apr 17 20:54:02 2015 UTC,This is pretty sweet. At what point do we start talking about bundling some picks to trade for a superstar?
denvernuggets,32xhim,fuggingolliwog,6,Sat Apr 18 00:19:18 2015 UTC,"IMO as an outsider, it's a lot more difficult for the Nuggets than that.  Teams rarely trade superstars, and when they do it's because a player has requested a trade/had a bad attitude toward the organization, in which they typically look to go to a big market or a winning team, OR it's because the superstar is on an expiring deal and won't re-sign with his current team.  So the first aspect of waiting for a superstar to become available is rare enough.  In the rare circumstance one is available, you then have to be able to outbid the other 10 teams waiting for a superstar available.  The Celtics have more 1st round picks than I have fingers (exaggeration but you get it).  The Sixers have acquired a billion ""assets"" as Hinkie likes to call them, and their whole strategy has been to spend years trying to draft a superstar or acquire enough talented young players/picks to outbid other teams for superstars in trades.   And then you have to worry about whether the superstar will stay with you guys, should he be on an expiring contract when you acquire him.  That's the part that excludes many smaller market/less competitive teams from getting involved in these trades, as the assets the small teams have can't possibly be worth half a season of a guy who will leave.  I think the best way for the Nuggets to get a superstar is to draft well or to trade for a guy who's role is limiting his potential/is young and talented but not needed on his current team, but would dramatically improve on the Nuggets.   So to answer your question, I think the Nuggs are already trying to land a superstar in the best ways that are available to them.  But I don't see them bundling picks to get an established superstar."
denvernuggets,32xhim,IMDATBOY,4,Sat Apr 18 03:59:52 2015 UTC,thats my thoughts
denvernuggets,32xhim,damb_b,3,Sat Apr 18 03:04:53 2015 UTC,"I think now.... I strongly feel we need a defensive, offensive aggressive player at the 2 spot, one that would take the load of from Ty to be the alpha dog. Ty i believe could be a great complimentary piece to someone like that"

denvernuggets,32xhim,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Sat Apr 18 06:27:50 2015 UTC,"We're going to have to draft and build a superstar, not trade for one.  Connelly's biggest strength is his ability to scout and draft well, so acquiring lotto picks is our best bet for a home run.  Nurkic is a good start, so I'm excited to see what Tim pulls off in the next two drafts."
denvernuggets,32xhim,RyanM15,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:28:58 2015 UTC,"These extra picks won't be top 10, they don't hold a ton of value (for example Mozgov brought in 2 late firsts)"

Finally, Here's Karl going in on him about it."

denvernuggets,32u854,shaner307,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:56:05 2015 UTC,"As said, in the GS-Denver playoffs he rankled us all with some bush league tactics.   As a coach, he's regarded as being ""just"" a motivator with severe limitations as a playcaller and game manager.  He also has baggage from GS and elsewhere, where he was unable to get along with management or his own assistant coaches and was kind of a kook, such as using team facilities to supplement his career as a preacher, or supposedly alienating Andrew Bogut and others with his evangelizing. He even allegedly tried to cause a mutiny and take the team from John Stockton when he played in Utah. If all is true, the dude is kind of suspect and untrustworthy and someone I don't really want as coach."
denvernuggets,32u854,growedup,13,Fri Apr 17 17:41:43 2015 UTC,"I hope we stick with Hunt, the guys seemed to really enjoy playing for him. He is an unproven coach though."

denvernuggets,32u854,teensonacid,5,Thu Apr 16 19:54:37 2015 UTC,"Faried, Gallo and Chandler have given their support to Hunt, Chandler thinks D'Antoni a good fit too"
denvernuggets,32u854,pairidaeza,3,Thu Apr 16 19:28:21 2015 UTC,"The list per Woj:  Melvin Hunt  Michael Malone  Mike D'Antoni  Scott Skiles   Alvin Gentry  David Vanterpool  Billy Donovan  Fred Hoiberg  He also says that,    With the uncertain future of Oklahoma City coach Scott Brooks, his potential availability on the market would make him a strong candidate for the Nuggets job, as well as Orlando's opening, league sources said."
denvernuggets,32u854,corybyu,5,Thu Apr 16 19:24:02 2015 UTC,"I would love to get Malone, I don't want anything to do with Donovan, Skiles, and to a lesser extent Alvin Genrty cause I don't think he would gel well with this team at all.  Also Scott Brooks can't even put together a good looking offense or draw up solid plays at the end of quarters with the Thunder, it isn't gonna be better in Denver."
denvernuggets,32u854,IMDATBOY,4,Fri Apr 17 00:23:18 2015 UTC,"Get Michael Malone, hope he keeps Hunt in his coaching staff,  trade for Boogie without giving up Nurk. PROFIT."
denvernuggets,32u854,Nugforlife,8,Thu Apr 16 20:08:43 2015 UTC,"There's no way Sac-town would let Boogie go easily. We'd have to give up too much.  We've got plenty of bigs right now, particularly consider Jokic is waiting in the wings.  We need to figure out our style going forward and then bring in personnel to fit that style."
denvernuggets,32u854,chazoid,3,Thu Apr 16 23:28:26 2015 UTC,"There's no way that Hunt stays without being head coach, although I'd love that."
denvernuggets,32u854,skipaBturner,6,Thu Apr 16 20:13:53 2015 UTC,"Personally I just don't see a reason to not give Hunt a chance.  He has already done much better than Shaw did, and the team respects him and wants to play for him.  By choosing anyone else at this point, there is the possibility the players could end up not being excited with yet another coaching change, and not want to play as hard for the new coach.  Also, we risk that Hunt may end up being an excellent head coach somewhere else, and we missed our chance at him.  We can always get a new coach in the future if Hunt doesn't work, but we can't go back if we let him go now."
denvernuggets,32u854,tron777,3,Thu Apr 16 21:55:52 2015 UTC,"Haha as a Kings fan I've gotta agree with /u/pairidaeza about the Kings not giving up Boogie that easily.  I also question their willingness to give him up to the Western conference.    But even aside from that, I'd actually warn against getting Malone, considering the Nuggets current roster.  His pace is much slower in order to establish a set and effective defense.  It tends to discourage efficient 3PT shooting and higher scoring, where the Nuggets tend to thrive with Lawson, Chandler and Gallo leading right now.  Nurkic is a good piece for him, but I'd probably recommend making some trades to get younger, more fitting talent if you guys pursue Malone."
denvernuggets,32u854,fuggingolliwog,2,Sat Apr 18 04:30:27 2015 UTC,"Hunt would be my first choice, D'Antoni would be next, but most importantly we need to bring players in that fit either one of these coaches style. Anyone know what day the lottery order is drawn? I know the draft is June 25th."

denvernuggets,32tkvc,icarus_adam,2,Thu Apr 16 16:36:20 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to find some sort of correlation between shape/size and offensive efficiency.  The Warriors, Hawks, Mavericks have big ass diamonds and very good offenses, no surprises there. Then there are teams with smaller diamonds in the Cavs and Clippers but they both have incredible talent handling the ball.  Then there's the Raptors, with a great offense and a tiny little blob, and now I'm confused. Actually, when you watch that Raptors squad it doesn't make much sense, either.   Then you have the 76ers with a huge shape and a historically horrible offense. I guess talent becomes an issue at some point.  The only correlation that seems clear is that big shapes = fun to watch."
denvernuggets,32tkvc,tron777,3,Thu Apr 16 18:25:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is much more about style than substance.  I wrote about that very idea in the 2nd half of my article last week.  Some teams like the Lebron-led Cavs are very stagnant and it works because Lebron has so much gravity and makes great plays so frequently that they can afford to have 3 guys standing around the perimeter and 2 guys running PnR.  Other teams like the Spurs and Warriors try to improve everyone's gravity by placing several guys in motion and moving the ball quickly.        From the article: ""However, while teams like the Spurs and Warriors have a clear emphasis on getting their players and the basketball moving, there isn’t a league-wide positive correlation between more movement and higher offensive rating. Three of the top four teams in ORtg, the Cavaliers, Raptors and Clippers, are also three of the bottom four in Half Court Pace. In fact, many of the top teams in ORtg have negative Half Court Pace scores. Those same teams also score fairly low in seconds between passes. On the flip side, the Knicks and 76ers are two of the worst offensive teams in the league yet rank very high in both metrics.  The metric doesn’t appear to reveal substantive advantages as much as it measures stylistic differences. The Hawks, Warriors and Spurs run players off of screens, whip the ball around the perimeter and drive and kick to get open looks. Teams like the Clippers and Cavaliers are much different in their approach. Whereas the Spurs rely on everybody on the court to contribute to creating open shots, superstar players like Lebron James and Chris Paul create a majority of their team’s open shots by virtue of their talent and court vision.  This stylistic difference is demonstrated in the two videos below.  In the first clip, notice how effective Lebron and the Cavs are at creating open shots by sticking stagnant shooters around the perimeter and running high pick and roll. Lebron demands a double team out of the pick-and-roll since he is one of the greatest finishers at the rim that the league has ever seen. Even without moving, players like J.R. Smith and Kyrie Irving are able to space the court enough to create a sort of 3-on-3 situation for Lebron and the two other players inside the 3-point circle. The result is an offensive set that can get any number of efficient FGA’s. In the video below, the Cavs get shots at the rim, shots in the corner and wide open mid range jumpers. The set works so well because of the talent on the court. If you substitute Lebron James for Rudy Gay, that set immediately become less effective. This is a large part of why “Jim’s and Joe’s trump X’s and O’s,” but that isn’t to say that X’s and O’s aren’t important. Teams with marginally less talented Jim’s and Joe’s just have to work harder (or at least they have to work differently) to create equally as efficient FGAs. That’s where ball movement and people movement comes in. In this clip, the Spurs run Belinelli, Parker, and Leonard off of screens before the second pass is made. From there, several players look to attack the basket quickly and kick if/when the defense collapses. The Spurs make a total of six passes and the defense is forced to scramble several times before giving up an open shot at the rim. The two different plays represent different levels of half court pace and time between passes. While both teams run stagnant sets and high motion sets on occasion, the Cavaliers rely much more heavily on sets like the first one. None of this is to say that one method is objectively better than the other. The Heat won two championships in 2012 and 2013 behind the stagnant, spread offense led by Lebron James. The Spurs won a championship in 2014 behind their high motion and passing offense that relied on all five players on the court. In both cases, the team requires a certain type of talent.  Team’s that don’t play to their strength end up with results like the Denver Nuggets, a team that for most of the season was among the most stagnant and least frequent passing teams in the league despite having a fairly balanced roster and lacking a single superstar talent. On the other end of the spectrum, teams like the 76ers are attempting to create an offensive identity that requires a lot of cutting and passing yet they lack the overall talent to execute it the way the Spurs do.  Lastly, the Warriors present a fairly curious case. They have superstar talent in Steph Curry yet they also have a roster full of talented role players that they can rely on to make smart, quick reads with the basketball. They are something of a combination of the two contrasting styles. Curry ranks 29th in time of possession per game, despite playing more minutes per game than 20 of the 29 people ahead of him. They are a rare case of a team with a transcendent player that still leans on the talent of the roster around him to create efficient FGAs.  All teams took notice when the Spurs won the finals with the model of ball movement and people movement. Perhaps the Warriors are taking it to the next level"""

denvernuggets,32r4fm,eathbau,4,Thu Apr 16 04:59:33 2015 UTC,Faried would occasionally show fire when Shaw called him a little bitch in the media.

I wish I was a bigger fan of the NBA because from all accounts, they're playing some of the best basketball ever seen.   But yeah, no love from me for Benedict Andre and the friendly fans of Oakland sports teams."
denvernuggets,32ki0n,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Tue Apr 14 15:04:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I feel ya. I'm pretty much a flavor of the season fan, so right now I'm really just watching the Rox and Indians and awaiting Cavs playoff time."
denvernuggets,32ki0n,SirJoris,10,Tue Apr 14 15:16:44 2015 UTC,"Yup. Since the play-off series we lost in 6, I just   can't stand them. I know they play some of the best basketball ever and some people go wild when they see Klay/Curry gey hot. But I just can't enjoy it. Even tough I know Curry is is probaply the best shooter in the game and has one of the best handles(Irving and Crawford are right up there), I hate watching him shoot some crazy step back that goes in. On a side note: I do think Steve Kerr is a pretty cool dude."
denvernuggets,32ki0n,corybyu,6,Tue Apr 14 16:12:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah same, I can't really bring myself to hate Kerr. Jackson was/is a major douchecanoe though."

denvernuggets,32ki0n,IdRatherBeLurking,6,Tue Apr 14 18:29:12 2015 UTC,"The Warriors have been bad as long as I can remember.  They've always been a good match up for us.  I've always hated them.  But they've never really made a ripple in the west in decades.  So the fans booed the owner a few years ago and he made steps to improve the team and here they are now.  I still hate them, but Steph Curry is incredible and he makes everything look so easy.  The rest of the Warriors irritate the shit out of me.  Bogut's stupid face that looks like he's constantly smelling farts.  Klay's I belong on a roman coin face drives me insane.  Don't even get me started about Benedict Andre.  But yeah, the guys are balling now and we're nowhere on the radar.  I wish Nuggets fans would boo our inept owner every chance they got."
denvernuggets,32ki0n,teensonacid,3,Tue Apr 14 17:03:46 2015 UTC,Josh would have to show his face once in a while to give us a chance at that.
denvernuggets,32ki0n,f0xpuppy,5,Tue Apr 14 17:35:34 2015 UTC,I actually owned a Curry jersey up until that series. I sold it along with my Mole jersey at a yardsale soon after. That was one of the most heartbreaking playoffs / offseason i can remember. My feelings for the warriors went from respect and the hope we would become rivals to completely despising everything about them. I understand where you're  coming from.
denvernuggets,32ki0n,licoriceallsorts,6,Tue Apr 14 21:59:41 2015 UTC,"Oh shit you and me both. When Bogut signed with them it made it an incentive to cheer for the fellow aussie.   But that playoffs series left such a bitter taste, calling our guys dirty players, iggy being a mole. Fuck Golden State."

denvernuggets,32ki0n,nickynicholson,3,Wed Apr 15 22:45:40 2015 UTC,"I'm with you man. Hate Warriors after this series, because of their tears and Iggy's move."
denvernuggets,32ki0n,tron777,3,Thu Apr 16 06:01:25 2015 UTC,"Absolutely despise Iggy. Blood boils just thinking about that series 2 years ago.   That being said, can't hate Steph, kid is making history in front of our eyes. Gotta appreciate"
denvernuggets,32ki0n,IdRatherBeLurking,7,Thu Apr 16 16:39:09 2015 UTC,"I really only hated Mark Jackson so I've come around on them a bit.  I find Curry pretty hard to dislike.  Bogut is awesome, I've liked that dude since his Bucks days.  I got no problem with Andre.  Klay and Draymond are pretty annoying I guess but overall the team is pretty fun."
denvernuggets,32ki0n,tron777,10,Tue Apr 14 16:05:23 2015 UTC,"Bogut is awesome, I've liked that dude since his Bucks days.   Blasphemy! His (unacknowledged) dirty play in that series really burnt me on him."

denvernuggets,32ki0n,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Apr 14 16:47:41 2015 UTC,Just remembered Bogut's Squad 6.  Probably the coolest things I've seen a player do for a team/fanbase. Pepsi Center needs something like this.

BUT, god I hated them after that series. I deleted my FB account, made sure all my friends knew I hated them, etc. Denver was destined to greatness that year and it was stolen from us, half-due to Gallo's injury."
denvernuggets,32ki0n,Samcrates,2,Thu Apr 16 22:57:42 2015 UTC,"I feel the opposite actually. I love the way they play the game. I hate watching ugly selfish slow basketball. The Warriors do that very little. Maybe it's just because I'm so tired of our ownership and front office lately but I blame them for the way that played out with Iggy more than any of the players on the Warriors are to blame, especially with Mark Jackson gone."
denvernuggets,32ki0n,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:33:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm actually really like GS also.  All of their players are pretty likable.

They're fun AF to watch, and a model for how a run and gun team can have success."
denvernuggets,32ki0n,NUGGman,2,Tue Apr 14 23:12:45 2015 UTC,He made plans to leave well before we decided to rebuild.

denvernuggets,32ki0n,Samcrates,3,Wed Apr 15 09:12:58 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say he was honest.
denvernuggets,32ki0n,tron777,2,Wed Apr 15 13:11:27 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but it's like when people roasted Saban for lying about staying at Miami...like wtf is he supposed to say, ""yeah I hate it here and can't wait to bounce the fuck out""  I agree he definately mailed in the GS series, and it's cool with me if people don't like him for that, but the whole situation didn't really get to me as much as it seems like it did to others for whatever reason"
denvernuggets,32ki0n,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Apr 16 01:06:12 2015 UTC,I agree he definately mailed in the GS series   Iggy was the Nugget's best player in that series. I don't agree that he mailed it in.
denvernuggets,32ki0n,NUGGman,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:30:08 2015 UTC,I wouldn't hold his move against him if he didn't get it in motion before the series was over.
denvernuggets,32ki0n,Samcrates,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:16:49 2015 UTC,Mailed in the GS series? He was our best 3 point shooter. He played his best that series and every other game in a Nuggets jersey.
denvernuggets,32ki0n,NUGGman,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:37:48 2015 UTC,"I meannnn to say he played his best every single game he ever played in a nuggs jersey seems a little bit like a hyperbole.   Also, in interviews Karl has also said he believes Iggy was the one who was talking to Mark Jackson during the series and saying he didn't agree with the style of play Karl wanted from the team. He was the best player on the team, it's not surprising he was the best 3 point shooter for the nuggs, but talking to the other coach DURING THE SERIES about tactics is kinda bullshit"
denvernuggets,32ki0n,Samcrates,0,Thu Apr 16 21:33:18 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, we all agree about who Jackson was talking about. But all Jackson said was that a player said he doesn't subscribe to dirty play. That doesn't mean he commented on any strategy the Nuggets may out may not have employed. I don't think any of us really believe that the Nuggets were targeting Curry.  I really believe that Iggy played with effort every game. He's that kind of player. It's pretty insulting to say that a player would ""mail it in"""
denvernuggets,32ki0n,NUGGman,1 point,Thu Apr 16 22:15:08 2015 UTC,"Haha I think I argued both sides of Iggy in this thread. I really liked him as a Nugg, just for some reason recalling him not playing well but I may be wrong"

denvernuggets,32ki0n,NUGGman,4,Wed Apr 15 14:10:29 2015 UTC,"He never ""lied"".  He was the only Nuggets player to pray with their team during the playoffs, instead of praying with ours. He was the mole that Jackson spoke so often of. He also had his cousin sitting next to the GSW owner, telling him how much Iggy would love to play there.  His plans were in motion well before that series ended, and for that he will forever be tainted in my eyes.  Source"
denvernuggets,32ki0n,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:13:43 2015 UTC,"Instead of praying with ours? What do you mean? He didn't skip any prayer session with our team. He participated in ""chapel"". You should probably google NBA and chapel to understand its a prayer by both teams before NBA games.  Edit: here I googled it for you. Chapel is a JOINT prayer session http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/2459118"
denvernuggets,32ki0n,NUGGman,2,Wed Apr 15 14:16:46 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, he should have never joined them. He should have stuck with his team. But hey, I'm not religious, and I understand that for them those things supersede worldly ties. That's not even the main issue out of the three that I listed, nor the reason why he's a turncoat.  What about him being Jackson's mole? What about him soliciting GSW's owner before the serious was over? There's no two ways around it: That's disingenuous as fuck."
denvernuggets,32ki0n,NUGGman,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:24:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not religious either. I just think the Nuggets fans needed a scapegoat and the media gave us one with this chapel story. I'm loyal to those who I support unless there's Credible reason to believe otherwise. Mark Jackson said the Nuggets targeted Steph Curry's ankle. Do we believe that? I sure don't. He also said he has reason to believe that a player on the Nuggets doesn't subscribe to that type of play. What the hell does that even mean? He probably asked Andre if they were targeting Curry and Iggy probably said, ""I don't play that way."" Who knows. But I can't think of a realistic scenario where I don't completely support Andre.  What we learned from that series is that Mark Jackson is ""Busch League"", as George Karl said."
denvernuggets,32ki0n,silverandblack,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:06:13 2015 UTC,"I don't agree. I'm a big fan of GS because they beat us. Don't get me wrong, I Despise Mark Jackson and everything he did in that series, but Gallo was out and we needed him to be our top scorer every time we beat them that year. (in OT a couple times) It was a frustrating loss, but not nearly as frustrating as the ""sky is falling"" reaction everyone had to it.  As for Iguodala leaving for GS; it was the first time he was able to pick his team and he chose wisely and may get a ring because of it. I wish him all the best. Why waste your time with spite because he left? Nobody would have stayed in his situation, and if they did it would have been a terrible choice."
denvernuggets,32ki0n,IdRatherBeLurking,-5,Wed Apr 15 08:59:53 2015 UTC,"I am a nuggets fan, but we are never going to win. We had our best chance a couple of years ago when no one was looking. It's not going to happen. Be happy you get to see the great players once a season. Avalanche maybe. Rockies once a lifetime. Broncos every twenty years.  That's it. You are in the only time zone that only had four teams."
denvernuggets,32ki0n,teensonacid,5,Wed Apr 15 04:12:07 2015 UTC,"I upvoted you because that's what I do- and downvoting someone's opinion isn't what I want to see around here.  That being said, I can't agree with you. There's way too many variables at play to simply say ""our teams will never win"". If being pessimistic about the future is your gig then so be it, but I don't see any reason to be."
denvernuggets,32kols,tron777,3,Tue Apr 14 15:49:30 2015 UTC,Detroit plays the Knicks at 6 so we should know by game time if the loss matters at all for seeding.  Hopefully Detroit wins so we can root for a win without feeling like we're hurting the team's lottery chances.
denvernuggets,32kols,tron777,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:10:34 2015 UTC,Do you know what happens if there is a tie?  The series is tied 1-1 this year.
denvernuggets,32kols,tron777,2,Tue Apr 14 16:15:16 2015 UTC,"Coin flip for the better lottery odds.   Edit: Oh wait, I was wrong.    In the event that teams finish with the same record, each tied team receives the average of the total number of combinations for the positions that they occupy. In 2007, the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Portland Trail Blazers tied for the sixth worst record. The average of the 6th and 7th positions in the lottery was taken, resulting in each team getting 53 combinations (the average of 63 and 43).   Edit Edit: Wait, goddammit, I was right the first time. I need more coffee   Should the average number not be an integer, a coin flip is then used to determine which team or teams receive the extra combination(s). The result of the coin flip is also used to determine who receives the earlier pick in the event that neither of the tied teams wins one of the first three picks via the lottery."
denvernuggets,32kols,The_NGUYENNER,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:20:24 2015 UTC,"This is hilariously convoluted.   So if I read this right: Both teams have equal balls, and if neither team receives a top 3 pick, the coin flip winner takes the earlier pick."

denvernuggets,32j4ee,eathbau,2,Tue Apr 14 14:25:12 2015 UTC,Another great close game that we lost on purpose.  I loved it.  We took it to them (and all of their starters) until we knew it was time to let the Floppers have it.  That's exactly how I wanted these last games to go.  Win the 1st three quarters and gracefully bow out in the middle of the fourth.

denvernuggets,32iggb,Tskitishvili,2,Tue Apr 14 04:58:44 2015 UTC,"a little bit off topic, did you guys catch the Bucks rebrand? i think it's time the Nugs took a rebrand very seriously"
denvernuggets,32iggb,teensonacid,2,Tue Apr 14 02:31:36 2015 UTC,"The new Bucks logo is a severe downgrade, IMO.  The powder blue is fresh and iconic. That's like asking the C's to ditch their emerald green.  I like all of our jerseys right now."

denvernuggets,32iggb,tebam,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:34:22 2015 UTC,"The yellow jerseys with skyline, and the new(ish) pickaxe logo."
denvernuggets,32iggb,teensonacid,2,Tue Apr 14 02:36:05 2015 UTC,"the yellow skyline is dope, i dig that as our retro alternative, but i think we need new home and away jerseys, new typeface logo, cleaner, more modern feel. not so heavy typeface, gold/white/black as primary colours with the sky blue brought in for piping or highlights. i love the pickaxe logo..should definitely build around that...i think i've shown you the minimalist ones i mocked up a few years ago?"
denvernuggets,32iggb,tebam,4,Tue Apr 14 02:39:23 2015 UTC,"I'm probably in the minority here but I think our 90s jerseys were the best in team history. If nothing else I'd at least like some darker colors, I'm getting a little tired of the powder blue and yellow.   These"

denvernuggets,32iggb,teensonacid,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:32:28 2015 UTC,Tonight's official starters for Denver:  Green  Foye   Harris  Chandler  Faried
denvernuggets,32iggb,teensonacid,2,Tue Apr 14 02:39:18 2015 UTC,so short
denvernuggets,32fe41,AlienDeg,1 point,Mon Apr 13 10:17:14 2015 UTC,"Faried put on a clinic in that first quarter. When he's making his layups, he's a force to be reckoned with."
denvernuggets,32fe41,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:21:01 2015 UTC,I'm so happy Shaw is gone!
denvernuggets,32dtu8,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Sun Apr 12 23:40:11 2015 UTC,Can anyone enlighten me as to why Nurkic's minutes have been cut and he's not starting? Just playing poorly?
denvernuggets,32dtu8,MileHighPride30,3,Mon Apr 13 05:05:33 2015 UTC,Still not 100% maybe. Why use him and risk a bigger injury when our season is practically over now and he has such huge potential.
denvernuggets,32dtu8,zachtothejohnson,1 point,Mon Apr 13 05:57:14 2015 UTC,And I believe Hunt likes to go small with Hickson/Faried. So that he can play without a true 4. That also hurts Nurkic playing time..
denvernuggets,32dtu8,SirJoris,2,Mon Apr 13 10:28:48 2015 UTC,Do you guys know if the Nuggets can finish ahead of the Pistons?
denvernuggets,32dtu8,trafikant,3,Mon Apr 13 13:24:16 2015 UTC,Nuggets are @Clippers and @Warriors. Pistons are @Cavs and @Knicks.  Nuggets are currently one game worse.  If they tie I believe it goes to a coin flip.
denvernuggets,32dtu8,tron777,2,Mon Apr 13 16:07:57 2015 UTC,"Go Nuggeta! Jokes aside, I think it was a good game despite Gay Cousins sitting out. Always fun beating George Karl, even though still love the guy. Good to see Faried play well to end the season. He's averaging 18/9.7 in the month of April which is what I'd expect out of him next season to be honest."
denvernuggets,32dtu8,trentyz,1 point,Mon Apr 13 07:34:32 2015 UTC,"Last year he also finished strong, I wanna see him do it for an entire season"
denvernuggets,32dtu8,SirJoris,1 point,Mon Apr 13 10:26:36 2015 UTC,Did you miss his rookie year? That was an entire season (without Shaw)
denvernuggets,32cvkc,with2nns,5,Sun Apr 12 18:54:34 2015 UTC,"He averaged 15.4 ppg, league-leading 9.3 rpg, and 3.5 apg, while leading the league with the index rating of 22 according to Wikipedia."
denvernuggets,32cvkc,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Sun Apr 12 18:56:50 2015 UTC,"For anyone curious, the index rating formula is thus:  (Points + Rebounds + Assists + Steals + Blocks + Fouls Drawn) - (Missed Field Goals + Missed Free Throws + Turnovers + Shots Rejected + Fouls Committed).  Can't wait to see how he does in the summer league."
denvernuggets,32cvkc,SirJoris,6,Sun Apr 12 19:33:42 2015 UTC,So whats the latest on him coming to Denver next season?
denvernuggets,32cvkc,chazoid,3,Sun Apr 12 20:30:18 2015 UTC,I hope we draft Porzingus or the other Euro...  Would love to have an all euro team
denvernuggets,32cvkc,The_NGUYENNER,4,Sun Apr 12 20:05:36 2015 UTC,Hezonja! Him and D'Angelo Russell are my prizes this year

denvernuggets,32czxw,TriceraScotts,2,Sun Apr 12 22:18:54 2015 UTC,happy for you man! make the most of it
denvernuggets,32czxw,tebam,2,Sun Apr 12 22:20:06 2015 UTC,Congrats man! That's still my dream...maybe next year
denvernuggets,32czxw,tebam,2,Sun Apr 12 23:12:17 2015 UTC,1000% worth it
denvernuggets,32czxw,TriceraScotts,2,Sun Apr 12 23:13:10 2015 UTC,I was 4th row behind nuggs bench...did you score any free stuff the players were giving out after the game?
denvernuggets,32czxw,tebam,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:48:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I got one of those balls signed by JoLo, but I wasn't about to fight the kids for anything else. Got to dap out JoLo, Barton, Jameer, and Gallo, which was enough for me."
denvernuggets,32czxw,tebam,2,Mon Apr 13 21:04:23 2015 UTC,Thats awesome!! All i got was a unsigned t-shirt that was thrown on the floor that my wife snagged before anyone got to it. Very cool though that the players spent as much time as they did meeting fans and handing out souvenirs....
denvernuggets,32czxw,Atiredsprucetree,7,Tue Apr 14 00:06:45 2015 UTC,HOLY SHIT BARTON JUST WINKED AT ME
denvernuggets,32czxw,Atiredsprucetree,2,Sun Apr 12 23:04:40 2015 UTC,"I gave you one real upvote, but I also gave you ten more imaginary ones."
denvernuggets,32czxw,teensonacid,3,Sun Apr 12 23:08:05 2015 UTC,Welcome home Coach!!!!
denvernuggets,32czxw,DtownAndOut,3,Sun Apr 12 21:11:51 2015 UTC,Gallo! Let's see him hit 50 tonight haha
denvernuggets,32czxw,TriceraScotts,3,Sun Apr 12 21:18:06 2015 UTC,"Jesus, Gallo's neck beard is looking bad."
denvernuggets,32czxw,teensonacid,3,Sun Apr 12 22:37:16 2015 UTC,"Ahahaha I just hollered out Jebi Se and Juka gave Mr that classic smirk, my life is complete"
denvernuggets,32czxw,Atiredsprucetree,2,Sun Apr 12 23:15:36 2015 UTC,Faried starting out strong I like it
denvernuggets,32czxw,TriceraScotts,1 point,Sun Apr 12 21:17:38 2015 UTC,He's looking so good tonight
denvernuggets,3299us,Atiredsprucetree,9,Sat Apr 11 19:08:08 2015 UTC,"This is one of the reasons I like Hunt so much and think he needs to stay. Even after the loss and a relatively sub-par performance by Faried, he still appreciates the team and lets them know. Doesn't throw anyone under any buses."
denvernuggets,3299us,corybyu,7,Sat Apr 11 19:10:32 2015 UTC,"What a well-fought game too, we were down 20 points in the 3rd, we usually don't come back from that kind of deficit and go into OT.  I really hope we keep Hunt and the core of our team, unless we can pick up some huge free agent (unlikely)."
denvernuggets,329rki,TriceraScotts,3,Sat Apr 11 21:43:04 2015 UTC,That's a baller-ass cross stitch.
denvernuggets,329rki,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Sun Apr 12 03:15:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. It's one of my favorite decorations. No one in Pittsburgh had ever said anything about it, so obviously they are all idiots/ jerks."
denvernuggets,329rki,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Sun Apr 12 07:29:40 2015 UTC,Didn't need to tell me that. Damn them and their color coordinated sports teams
denvernuggets,32900g,with2nns,7,Sat Apr 11 17:45:37 2015 UTC,"My god, it would be hilarious if Ty ended up in Utah, considering how he's spoken of disliking the place.  I like these scenarios, but no way does Utah do any of that. They have Burke and Exum to groom and on rookie contracts, why want Ty / Jrue?"
denvernuggets,32900g,f0xpuppy,3,Sat Apr 11 20:45:48 2015 UTC,"The more I think about that trade the more I think ""Geez Utah would have to be downright silly to do that"". But to play devil's advocate, isn't Burke one of those PG in a SG's body type of guys? Maybe I'm thinking of Burks. And maybe they want to make a jump next season and get some playoff experience, something Exum won't be able to help them do."
denvernuggets,32900g,clancydog4,1 point,Sat Apr 11 21:00:23 2015 UTC,"Burke is quite small, even for a PG.  Burks is a SG, Exum is around 6'6 and long and a combo guard"
denvernuggets,32900g,AlienDeg,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:05:26 2015 UTC,Burke is not a basketball player.
denvernuggets,32900g,pairidaeza,6,Mon Apr 13 06:31:03 2015 UTC,"None of these are good for the franchise.  If Lawson goes, it needs to be for picks. And you definitely don't trade away Gallinari.  SMH. Bill Simmons is such a stooge sometimes."
denvernuggets,32900g,NUGGman,1 point,Sun Apr 12 05:23:06 2015 UTC,"Sometimes? He has a lot of fans, but I'm not one of them."
denvernuggets,32900g,ParadeShitter,7,Wed Apr 15 09:26:58 2015 UTC,"i consider the book of basketball the greatest book i've ever read. i love bill simmons and he's always an entertaining writer  that said, he's becoming less and less aware about things not named the boston celtics or the james harden trade. he's become a tmz writer just talking about how he can tell kevin love doesn't like cleveland and how the clippers don't like each other. he knows nothing about denver's needs nor wants. i doubt he's watched more than 1 nugget game all year.   i'd love to have holiday. he probably is a bit better overall player than ty and younger but why would utah every facilitate such a trade for denver? why wouldn't they just go get holiday on their own?"
denvernuggets,32900g,bettycrockerpot,5,Sat Apr 11 18:30:18 2015 UTC,because we blessed them with gobert
denvernuggets,32900g,tron777,2,Sat Apr 11 18:44:30 2015 UTC,"I like Bill. Yeah, he doesn't know much about the Nuggets, and the chances of any of this happening are slim, but their not insane.  As for Utah, I think they do it. They're looking to make a jump, and they can do it with Ty. They could look to get Jrue, but maybe they want Ty more. Plus this way they get a 2nd rounder to boot, and there could be an issue with the salaries, but I don't know about all that."
denvernuggets,32900g,TriceraScotts,1 point,Sat Apr 11 19:01:57 2015 UTC,"Jrue Holiday is nowhere near the player Ty Lawson is. I see a lot of love in this thread for Holiday and I have no idea why.  He might be a bit better defensively but I don't think it's all that significant. Offensively, Ty blows away Holiday.    Ty has never shot worse than Holiday's career best True Shooting percentage of .526 and Ty averages .561 to Holiday's .509. That is huge. The biggest difference is that Ty gets to the line about twice as often as Holiday. Ty has a better assist rate and a better turnover rate.  Ty's career win shares is 38.2, Holiday's is 19.2.  Really, pick a metric and Ty is just better.  I would much rather have Ty than Holiday."
denvernuggets,32900g,SirJoris,4,Mon Apr 13 14:58:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I get why people aren't happy with Ty. There are nights where he doesn't show up, he's not always aggressive, and he has some off court issues. That being said, he's been top 3 in assists the last two years (and on a team that can't shoot this year and most of last year).  If Harris makes a leap and learns how to shoot, surrounding Ty with him, Gallo, Chandler, Faried, and Nurkic (assuming be continues to get better) is a legit starting five with a lot of length that will let the Nuggs hide Ty on defence (and be less of a disaster on that end). Plus I don't want to buy another jersey, so there's that."
denvernuggets,32900g,clancydog4,2,Sun Apr 12 07:28:00 2015 UTC,"I like the ideas, but how realistic are they...? I see no reason at all for Charlotte to trade a very big talent in Walker, for an inconsistent Ty."
denvernuggets,32900g,The_NGUYENNER,0,Sat Apr 11 19:29:15 2015 UTC,"are you kidding?  Ty is significantly better and probably more consistent than Kemba.  Kemba is wildly inconsistent and inefficient.  he is talented, but not as much as Ty.  Ty's a better player than Kemba by a good amount - more efficient scorer, significantly better passer/playmaker"
denvernuggets,328tzh,jd61,8,Sat Apr 11 16:55:37 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up: After the season's over, I'll be holding a weekly discussion of the top 10 draft picks, so that we can get familiar with who the Nuggets might pick and how they could fit into our system. Keep an eye out for them!"
denvernuggets,328tzh,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Sat Apr 11 20:50:06 2015 UTC,"Love it. Hopefully next season we speed up our offense and just go nuts like in 2012-13. That was one of my favorite seasons to watch, after 2009/10. I just wanna see Faried and Ty go to woooork!"
denvernuggets,328tzh,trentyz,6,Sun Apr 12 01:32:24 2015 UTC,"me, out of my mama's house"
denvernuggets,328tzh,bettycrockerpot,4,Sat Apr 11 18:40:24 2015 UTC,"I'd like to trade down and pick up Mudiay or Russell, netting Philly's 3rd and 11th pick or something similar."
denvernuggets,328tzh,with2nns,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:26:03 2015 UTC,I like this
denvernuggets,328tzh,Kawnar,3,Sun Apr 12 12:09:54 2015 UTC,"Obviously you draft based on talent rather than need. So, to that end, the best available.  Personally, I like Kaminsky's game."
denvernuggets,328tzh,pairidaeza,3,Sun Apr 12 05:27:46 2015 UTC,"Well if we move up in the lottery to a top 3 seed, depending where we are I would just look at Okafor, Towns, and Mudiay. Mudiay would be good if we do end up trading away ty and would probably be worth it to trade up to try and get him even though I love ty. If we don't move up in the lottery and stay at the 7th pick, I would love for the Nuggets to draft Justice windslow if he's still available."
denvernuggets,328tzh,weiner_cleaner,2,Sat Apr 11 20:28:12 2015 UTC,"I reckon we're in need of a SF, especially if Chandler gets traded. If that's the case, we'll only really have Gallo as a true SF. Although you can't turn down Towns/Okafor regardless of your current roster."
denvernuggets,328tzh,trentyz,2,Sun Apr 12 01:35:25 2015 UTC,I hope with pick Stanley Johnson or Porzingis though
denvernuggets,327iky,AlienDeg,7,Sat Apr 11 06:40:26 2015 UTC,Love him... hope he is a Nugget for life
denvernuggets,327iky,jd61,2,Sat Apr 11 07:59:45 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping the core of Ty/Faried/Gallo stay for the majority of their respective careers, they're true Nugs to me!"

denvernuggets,327iky,SirJoris,3,Sat Apr 11 20:34:44 2015 UTC,You can just tell the guys' gonna be puttin in work this offseason. Can't wait.
denvernuggets,3275gd,IdRatherBeLurking,9,Sat Apr 11 04:01:21 2015 UTC,Man I hope Gallo is a Nugget for life. Easily my favorite player
denvernuggets,3275gd,teensonacid,8,Sat Apr 11 07:06:34 2015 UTC,How does Faried get blocked by Felton?
denvernuggets,3275gd,denverNUGGs,7,Sat Apr 11 04:04:55 2015 UTC,How could we leave Felton wide open for a lay up for their last possession?
denvernuggets,3275gd,runningman3,4,Sat Apr 11 05:52:24 2015 UTC,"Couldn't watch the game because of homework. Really wish I did though, since I missed out on watching Gallinari score a career high 47 points."
denvernuggets,3275gd,BlackCucco,6,Sat Apr 11 04:26:10 2015 UTC,"Same, the struggle was real"
denvernuggets,3275gd,funkyspaceman12,5,Sat Apr 11 06:12:30 2015 UTC,If I didn't have such a heavy college workload I would definitely watch every Nuggets game.
denvernuggets,3275gd,BlackCucco,4,Sat Apr 11 06:23:24 2015 UTC,This is the only game that I attended this year and I'm really glad I went. I enjoyed watching Gallo go to work. Go Nuggets.
denvernuggets,3275gd,runningman3,3,Sat Apr 11 05:50:00 2015 UTC,Great game. I love Gallo.
denvernuggets,3275gd,Tskitishvili,2,Sat Apr 11 04:09:28 2015 UTC,"I got the update of the final score of the game on my phone last night, and was just pissed off for the rest of the night that I didn't watch"
denvernuggets,3275gd,tebam,2,Sat Apr 11 15:15:37 2015 UTC,Also how does Hunt not go to Gallo for any of the chances at game winners?
denvernuggets,3275gd,denverNUGGs,3,Sat Apr 11 04:46:18 2015 UTC,Hopefully because he knows how the lottery works.   A man can dream.
denvernuggets,3275gd,richardallensmith,2,Sat Apr 11 05:45:22 2015 UTC,Great game and appropriately lost.  But Felton?
denvernuggets,3275gd,chucho320,2,Sat Apr 11 14:27:58 2015 UTC,Had 3rd row seats. Didn't go. Damnit....
denvernuggets,3275gd,looktheresafox,2,Sat Apr 11 18:46:44 2015 UTC,had 6th row seats behind the nuggs bench..one of the best games i have ever seen where we didn't win.......
denvernuggets,3269m2,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Fri Apr 10 22:54:26 2015 UTC,"Early thread today, I'm going to the game boys!   I've only been to 4 games this season, which is the same as last, and about 11 less than 12-13. Here's to hoping that some day there will be a team on the floor that gets my ass in those seats as many times as the 12-13 team did.   GO NUGGETS"
denvernuggets,3269m2,denverNUGGs,3,Fri Apr 10 22:55:37 2015 UTC,"Im right there with ya.  In 12-13 I went to about 15 games including playoffs.  Last year I probably made it to 3 or 4.  And this year I've been to one, it was a guys night out and I wanted my free shirt haha."
denvernuggets,3269m2,funkyspaceman12,2,Fri Apr 10 23:50:19 2015 UTC,"Hey now, don't forget about the free shot of beer you get with that awesome shirt!"

denvernuggets,3269m2,orangesoda123,7,Sat Apr 11 00:48:53 2015 UTC,Holy shit I'm sitting with Gallo's dad.
denvernuggets,3269m2,The_NGUYENNER,3,Sat Apr 11 02:56:25 2015 UTC,hahah holy shit dude that's crazy!
denvernuggets,3269m2,funkyspaceman12,4,Sat Apr 11 03:09:01 2015 UTC,Cool ass dude. Very calm and quiet.
denvernuggets,3269m2,The_NGUYENNER,2,Sat Apr 11 03:15:09 2015 UTC,Badass. Tell him that his son is a bona fide badass. Jesus man. Just talking about how awesome he is pregame.
denvernuggets,324d7l,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Fri Apr 10 14:06:24 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, my eyes started watering a little bit during this."
denvernuggets,324d7l,orangesoda123,2,Fri Apr 10 14:07:19 2015 UTC,Pussy.  Haha it really is a touching story. Watching him go down was such a hard sight but its been amazing to witness his road to recovery. I've always loved his style of play and especially love his attitude. He can be so confident and humble at the same time. Easily my favorite Nugget.
denvernuggets,324d7l,Hunnewell,3,Fri Apr 10 18:54:20 2015 UTC,Thank you for posting this. Just reminds me how much I love him and the team.
denvernuggets,324rq2,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Fri Apr 10 16:00:40 2015 UTC,Pretty stoked that I get to go to the game tonight and hang out in a box. I'll be even more stoked if there's free booze.
denvernuggets,324rq2,tebam,2,Fri Apr 10 16:01:24 2015 UTC,Probably won't have time to watch the game tonight. This week kinda sucked so I said fuck it and decided I'm going to throw a party. Hope Faried and Gallo can keep up what they've been doing lately.
denvernuggets,324rq2,Th3Greyhound,2,Fri Apr 10 18:59:44 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah man, get turnt up."
denvernuggets,324rq2,Th3Greyhound,2,Fri Apr 10 19:01:15 2015 UTC,"Haven't been able to watch the Nuggs for the past week or so being busy, anything new I should know about?"
denvernuggets,324rq2,BlackCucco,2,Fri Apr 10 17:15:19 2015 UTC,"Nothing crucial.   The Nuggets brought on two scrub players for salary cap reasons  They also honored the great Fat Lever on Wednesday.  Edit: Oh yeah and we creamed the Lakers, which is always nice."
denvernuggets,324rq2,ParadeShitter,2,Fri Apr 10 17:22:01 2015 UTC,Excellent
denvernuggets,324rq2,ParadeShitter,2,Sat Apr 11 23:27:32 2015 UTC,With the season coming to a close soon I was wondering what do we usually do during the off-season in this sub.
denvernuggets,322h4a,tebam,7,Fri Apr 10 01:17:21 2015 UTC,Oh darn and I just bought a Shavlik jersey too.
denvernuggets,322h4a,BlackCucco,3,Fri Apr 10 03:08:16 2015 UTC,"Haha obviously the title is sarcastic, but whatever the FO does to free up more money for the off season I'm ok with."
denvernuggets,322h4a,ParadeShitter,3,Fri Apr 10 01:18:16 2015 UTC,more about denver doing the bare minimum than anything to do with next season
denvernuggets,321aqd,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Thu Apr 9 19:49:53 2015 UTC,win or lose i watch every game i can. no matter who's on the roster i'll TRY my best to support them. i bleed blue and gold.

denvernuggets,321aqd,FugaYouDorphin,4,Thu Apr 9 22:49:36 2015 UTC,Ill always be a nuggets fan but man recently it's been hard to not stop watching at half time.
denvernuggets,31z8x9,AlienDeg,1 point,Thu Apr 9 08:56:50 2015 UTC,Any chance you have Faried's highlights as well?

denvernuggets,31yhpt,f0xpuppy,2,Thu Apr 9 03:46:51 2015 UTC,Get some!
denvernuggets,31yg0b,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Thu Apr 9 03:18:06 2015 UTC,Love it when Faried and Gallo have good games. Makes my heart happy.
denvernuggets,31yg0b,tebam,5,Thu Apr 9 03:29:18 2015 UTC,Gives a brother some hope.
denvernuggets,31yg0b,ADinHD,3,Thu Apr 9 03:31:39 2015 UTC,"Same. I miss being excited for the playoffs, man."
denvernuggets,31yg0b,TheeGreenHawk99,4,Thu Apr 9 04:32:31 2015 UTC,"Faried and Gallo with a stellar performance tonight. Even Ty showed up, which he almost always does against LAL."
denvernuggets,31yg0b,SirJoris,3,Thu Apr 9 03:18:32 2015 UTC,"Love beating the Lakers, man. Brings a smile to my heart."
denvernuggets,31yg0b,neydeus,2,Thu Apr 9 05:12:50 2015 UTC,"Doesn't get much better, no matter the circumstances."
denvernuggets,31yg0b,denverNUGGs,3,Thu Apr 9 05:13:34 2015 UTC,Fat Lever has to be the best name in Nuggets history
denvernuggets,31yg0b,neydeus,1 point,Thu Apr 9 07:57:54 2015 UTC,"Trash trashing bigger trash. Ugh. I don't watch a game of our Nuggets for a while. I need to watch one before the season ends. Anyway, how have been playing Erick, Harrys and Lauvergne? And, btw, I see we added Clark and Randolph to the roster. They are options for the next year? Go Nuggs!"
denvernuggets,31yg0b,denverNUGGs,3,Thu Apr 9 09:54:47 2015 UTC,Those two were added because we are below the salary floor.  They won't be on the team next year.  We barely have to pay Randolph.  https://twitter.com/espnsteinline/status/585911914552696834
denvernuggets,31yg0b,neydeus,2,Thu Apr 9 11:59:49 2015 UTC,Makes sense. Thanks.
denvernuggets,31yg0b,neydeus,3,Thu Apr 9 13:30:41 2015 UTC,"I think if we end up being under, the players would split that 635k"
denvernuggets,31yg0b,neydeus,2,Thu Apr 9 14:38:00 2015 UTC,"And what would it mean end up being under? Not much value to FA, right?"
denvernuggets,31xpf4,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Wed Apr 8 23:42:04 2015 UTC,"Sup Nug Nation,   As always, I'll be in class until the 4th quarter. Pretty bummed that I'll be missing this one, since I really wanted to see all of the Fat Lever appreciation stuff, and it's always fun to watch us beat up on the Lakers."
denvernuggets,31xpf4,teensonacid,2,Wed Apr 8 23:44:02 2015 UTC,fam...i feel like i haven't been here for weeks! Can we catch the Kings for that #6?? It looks like #5 is out of reach
denvernuggets,31xpf4,teensonacid,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:53:42 2015 UTC,Haha I figured you finally had enough.   We can definitely snatch that #6 spot. The Kings have a much easier schedule than us to finish out the season.
denvernuggets,31xpf4,tebam,3,Wed Apr 8 23:56:15 2015 UTC,"actually I've had alot of family related shit going and work has been crazy, just haven't had time to watch games and be in here. doesn't seem like i've missed a whole lot though, i can't stand watching us lose to the Spurs, Jazz and Clippers...that's my Big3 of Hate right there haha"
denvernuggets,31xpf4,tebam,2,Thu Apr 9 00:00:04 2015 UTC,I think you made a wise choice. It's been a bit of a ghost town in here.
denvernuggets,31xpf4,Nugforlife,2,Thu Apr 9 00:00:54 2015 UTC,I'm going to be watching the Rockies game mostly. I have a ticket for the hype train and I'm riding it as long as possible!
denvernuggets,31xpf4,Nugforlife,3,Thu Apr 9 01:14:40 2015 UTC,"I wish I could jump on that train with you, but I worry that I can no longer enjoy them. I've still got the burn scars from the last few seasons.  Who knows, if they can stay consistent for a few months then maybe I'll be able to get back into it."
denvernuggets,31xpf4,THECHUNGAWANGA,2,Thu Apr 9 01:17:56 2015 UTC,"I say that I won't get hyped before every season, but I always do. I know they will probably just disappoint me but I can't help it."
denvernuggets,31rfv3,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Tue Apr 7 16:12:58 2015 UTC,Never heard of him. Love reading this and learn something new!
denvernuggets,31rfv3,SirJoris,6,Tue Apr 7 18:29:59 2015 UTC,"I'm really digging all this attention on old Nuggets stars this week, it helps catch me up with the history of the team."
denvernuggets,31rfv3,BlackCucco,2,Tue Apr 7 18:32:10 2015 UTC,I was wondering if maybe you knew what the best way to learn about the history of the Nuggets would be? I've been a fan for about 8 years now and I have little knowledge of what the team was like pre Carmelo.
denvernuggets,31rfv3,BlackCucco,2,Wed Apr 8 09:22:21 2015 UTC,"The Nuggets used to have a great recap of each ""era"", but apparently they're re-writing them and the old ones are not available. I know the Denver Stiffs have done a good job detailing the past, but I don't think there's a list of any sort. I'll hit them up and see."
denvernuggets,31rfv3,BlackCucco,2,Wed Apr 8 16:19:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! I feel like I can always count on you for help.
denvernuggets,31n2e5,IdRatherBeLurking,8,Mon Apr 6 16:11:20 2015 UTC,"Haywood averaged (during the 1969-70 season with the Denver Rockets) 30 points and 19.5 rebounds PER GAME.   Among many other accolades, Mutombo holds the record for the most blocked shots in a 5 Game series with 31 in the historic 1994 upset of the #1 seed Seattle SuperSonics.   Edit: Another interesting fact. The Nuggets now have as many Hall-of-Famers (Mutombo, English, Thompson, Issel) as the Broncos (Elway, Zimmerman, Sharpe, Little). Although this city sure as hell doesn't act like it."

denvernuggets,31hl9o,IdRatherBeLurking,6,Sun Apr 5 03:44:57 2015 UTC,"""Down by 10"" is the theme of this season. The team always seems to keep it close enough that I don't want to miss a comeback, but then they never actually come back."
denvernuggets,31hl9o,denverNUGGs,4,Sun Apr 5 03:50:26 2015 UTC,Down by 10 is how we seem to start most games
denvernuggets,31hl9o,BlackCucco,2,Sun Apr 5 04:08:54 2015 UTC,I didn't have time to watch the game but it looks like I didn't miss much.
denvernuggets,31hl9o,f0xpuppy,2,Sun Apr 5 03:48:04 2015 UTC,"So i've been unable to catch the games these last 3 weeks, coincidentally during their losing streak.  What is it, exactly? Is the team tanking or has the honeymoon finished with coach Hunt?"
denvernuggets,31hl9o,f0xpuppy,2,Sun Apr 5 07:49:36 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't think its a ""honeymoon phase"" situation. It's just a combination of being the tail end of a shitty season, and we're playing a good number of teams who are gearing up for the playoffs."
denvernuggets,31hl9o,denverNUGGs,2,Sun Apr 5 07:52:09 2015 UTC,"Makes sense i guess. I'd assume since this is essentially the last week of regular season that coaches would be resting players, including our guys, but those are for playoff teams and we're not one of them."
denvernuggets,31hl9o,TweetsInCommentsBot,2,Sun Apr 5 07:58:13 2015 UTC,The current playoff picture is why they're still playing to win. Not a lot of the seeds are set in our conference.
denvernuggets,31gyvd,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Sun Apr 5 00:02:47 2015 UTC,Hopefully we don't repeat yesterday's blowout.
denvernuggets,31gyvd,BlackCucco,3,Sun Apr 5 00:08:54 2015 UTC,"Seriously. I can tolerate watching if we try hard, but last night was a joke."
denvernuggets,31gyvd,BlackCucco,3,Sun Apr 5 00:12:37 2015 UTC,It brought back bad memories of the blowouts that seemed to happen every other game earlier this season.
denvernuggets,31gyvd,tebam,2,Sun Apr 5 00:17:30 2015 UTC,Totally. Straight uninspired basketball by everyone but Gallo.
denvernuggets,31gyvd,tebam,2,Sun Apr 5 00:29:24 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, if there are any inaccuracies tonight I apologize, I'm at the Rapids game right now so I had to post this from my phone.   Go Nuggets!"
denvernuggets,31gyvd,Nugforlife,2,Sun Apr 5 00:03:51 2015 UTC,Jameer gets the start tonight due to Ty's forearm injury
denvernuggets,31gyvd,Nugforlife,2,Sun Apr 5 01:11:54 2015 UTC,Welp.
denvernuggets,31gyvd,Nugforlife,2,Sun Apr 5 01:14:59 2015 UTC,Isn't this fun.
denvernuggets,31gyvd,DominizZzle,2,Sun Apr 5 01:17:00 2015 UTC,I'm working the game tonight so as long as the crowd behaves I'll get to hopefully watch
denvernuggets,31gyvd,DominizZzle,2,Sun Apr 5 01:20:10 2015 UTC,Haha at least you've got that going for ya. Cheer em on!
denvernuggets,31gyvd,eathbau,2,Sun Apr 5 01:22:18 2015 UTC,Oh you know I will!
denvernuggets,31gyvd,eathbau,2,Sun Apr 5 01:24:49 2015 UTC,5 minutes in and this is already a blowout....SUCKS!!!!!
denvernuggets,31gyvd,eathbau,1 point,Sun Apr 5 01:20:43 2015 UTC,"Actually worse than yesterday, which I didn't think was possible."
denvernuggets,31em62,AlienDeg,4,Sat Apr 4 09:25:06 2015 UTC,"It really slid to the back of my mind that he was at one point a fair candidate for best 3 in the west behind Durant. When I think about it though it makes sense. He might not be on the productivity level of KD, melo or lebron but surely placing him in the company of 15-20 a night guys like Rudy Gay, Gordon Hayward or Chandler Parsons isn't a stretch an"
denvernuggets,31em62,rvhack,2,Sat Apr 4 11:19:05 2015 UTC,"Yup. Hope he can do some great things for us, when he is healthy for an entire season."
denvernuggets,31dsyz,benwobbles,4,Sat Apr 4 02:55:29 2015 UTC,"I said on realgm but Hunt is basically trying to mimic George Karl. He's using Nurkic like he used Koufos, as a big who just stood around the basket and grabbed rebounds. The difference is that Koufos has a decent vertical leap. Nurkic does not."
denvernuggets,31dsyz,eathbau,2,Sat Apr 4 03:04:25 2015 UTC,I thought Karl had a good system.
denvernuggets,31dsyz,rvhack,0,Sat Apr 4 07:58:27 2015 UTC,He's easily the most efficient scorer on the team   At .489 true shooting from a center he's been one of the least efficient players on the team. Only Arthur is worse of those getting significant minutes.
denvernuggets,31dsyz,tron777,1 point,Sat Apr 4 06:21:26 2015 UTC,"...but over the last 3 games his TSP has been .827, and while that's a small sample, it's late in the season and he needs to be getting as many touches as possible.  Hickson/Arthur/Foye should be getting limited time and touches."
denvernuggets,31dsyz,denverNUGGs,1 point,Sat Apr 4 15:20:25 2015 UTC,Arthur hasn't been playing at all
denvernuggets,31dsyz,rvhack,1 point,Sat Apr 4 21:13:17 2015 UTC,Arthur aggressively takes long 2s and threes and isn't proficient enough with them to be efficient.
denvernuggets,31d9vz,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Fri Apr 3 23:51:50 2015 UTC,Even though our season was a big mess I still believe in our guys to pull off the win! http://imgur.com/q2WJLaq

denvernuggets,31d9vz,wilsonsmilk,3,Sat Apr 4 01:29:58 2015 UTC,Pretty much as bad of an omen as you can have to start the season.

denvernuggets,31d9vz,growedup,2,Sat Apr 4 00:54:28 2015 UTC,"It took some time for me to finally find this gif. Haha.  Unfortunately, it looks like the Spurs are going all out in this game and they aren't going to let down."

denvernuggets,31d9vz,BlackCucco,2,Sat Apr 4 01:12:01 2015 UTC,Already down by 20 at the end of the first quarter. This game is definitely not going to end well if things keep going the way that they currently are.
denvernuggets,31d9vz,Nugforlife,2,Sat Apr 4 01:09:27 2015 UTC,Didn't think this day could get worse. Thank god Hickson is proving me wrong
denvernuggets,31d9vz,growedup,3,Sat Apr 4 01:12:18 2015 UTC,Nelson boxed out like his life depended on it and JJ derped the fuck out of the rebound.
denvernuggets,31d9vz,eathbau,2,Sat Apr 4 01:12:49 2015 UTC,That first half was just horrendous.
denvernuggets,31d9vz,Nugforlife,2,Sat Apr 4 01:37:39 2015 UTC,I haven't smiled once since the game started. I need a burrito.
denvernuggets,31d9vz,eathbau,2,Sat Apr 4 01:38:19 2015 UTC,I think we have hit rock bottom in this game tonight........
denvernuggets,31dsgw,IdRatherBeLurking,6,Sat Apr 4 02:50:08 2015 UTC,"Unless this is all purposely being played out to lose and look like this, I am afraid Hunt will not be our coach next season......."
denvernuggets,31dsgw,Nugforlife,3,Sat Apr 4 03:11:54 2015 UTC,I didn't get to catch the second half but it doesn't seem like it mattered anyway.
denvernuggets,31dsgw,BlackCucco,3,Sat Apr 4 03:20:10 2015 UTC,I only saw the second half so I think we both dodged a bullet.
denvernuggets,31dsgw,growedup,2,Sat Apr 4 03:29:04 2015 UTC,If only I was as smart as you two.
denvernuggets,31dsgw,growedup,2,Sat Apr 4 03:30:52 2015 UTC,Coach Hunt sheepishly approached Coach Popovich after the game. Hunt is very likable.
denvernuggets,31dsgw,rvhack,2,Sat Apr 4 02:51:17 2015 UTC,Probably afraid of that giant purple schnoz
denvernuggets,31dsgw,rvhack,2,Sat Apr 4 02:52:32 2015 UTC,So i didn't see this game. Can anyone give a synopsis?
denvernuggets,31btam,weiner_cleaner,9,Fri Apr 3 17:03:57 2015 UTC,This was during the trade deadline.  It doesn't mean they're actively shopping him this offseason.
denvernuggets,31btam,drumner,7,Fri Apr 3 18:01:09 2015 UTC,Nooooooooo i loooove you tyyyy
denvernuggets,31btam,chazoid,6,Fri Apr 3 17:41:53 2015 UTC,"I love Ty! Favorite player for years, I own his jersey... BUT these are the types of aggressive, forward-thinking moves the nuggets need to be making to re-build this team. Believing we can pick up one rookie this draft and suddenly be a contender in the west with our current roster more or less intact next year is bonkers. EVERYONE (save Nurk) needs to be available. I'm for it."
denvernuggets,31btam,markymarkhamill,2,Fri Apr 3 20:25:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not sure why anyone is actively supporting the idea of trading Lawson. From what I've read, part of it is the idea that Lawson isn't taking as many shots as all-star PGs Curry and Westbrook... which is ridiculous to me. We don't need someone taking all of the shots with the team we have. Unless we blow things up and build a pick-and-roll-focused starting five, we don't need Lawson to be our primary scorer.  That's something I've always loved about the Nuggets- you never know who's going to step up and lead the scoring. It could be Chandler, Gallinari, Faried, Lawson... we have multiple methods of attack, and it only makes sense to keep those options open. Lawson has a well-developed offensive IQ and isn't overly greedy with the ball- isn't that what a PG is supposed to do? Find the most effective play and execute it?"
denvernuggets,31btam,dot-pixis,1 point,Sun Apr 12 04:27:06 2015 UTC,NOOOOO please do not do this! I would hate this.
denvernuggets,31btam,trentyz,1 point,Sat Apr 4 00:16:35 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't hate this. Ty and Faried are both kind of headcases (in my opinion) so one of them has to go, and Ty is probably the one that will net a better return.  Edit: a word"
denvernuggets,31btam,growedup,1 point,Fri Apr 3 17:14:54 2015 UTC,Wow. Definitely not the type of news I was hoping to see. Not too sure who would agree to this deal though.

denvernuggets,31btam,growedup,10,Fri Apr 3 17:56:49 2015 UTC,Don't put Benedict Andre in the same ranks as Karl or Lawson.
denvernuggets,31b9w8,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Fri Apr 3 14:38:46 2015 UTC,Are these remaining games more or less important than preseason games? I'm having a hard time watching lately because it all feels so pointless.
denvernuggets,31b9w8,tron777,2,Fri Apr 3 15:05:21 2015 UTC,I just wanna see our young guys play 25+minutes a game. Watching the rooks(play hard) is something I still enjoy..

denvernuggets,31b9w8,BlackCucco,2,Fri Apr 3 15:07:38 2015 UTC,Anyone know a website where I could buy an alternative Jusuf Nurkic jersey?
denvernuggets,31b9w8,BlackCucco,2,Fri Apr 3 16:22:06 2015 UTC,I take it you're looking for a knockoff? I've heard a lot of people have success with aliexpress.
denvernuggets,31b9w8,BlackCucco,2,Fri Apr 3 16:25:31 2015 UTC,I'm not looking for a knockoff but a swingman of the alternative yellow jersey that the Nuggets have. I'm sorry if you misinterpreted what I meant by Alternative. I should have been a bit clearer on that.
denvernuggets,31b9w8,NUGGman,2,Fri Apr 3 17:09:02 2015 UTC,"I got the Alt part, I just figured you would go to the NBA store for the real deal :)  From a quick look, I can't seem to find a swingman alt for him. I know they have them at the Pepsi center, but it's odd that they don't have it on the store."
denvernuggets,31b9w8,BlackCucco,2,Fri Apr 3 17:14:58 2015 UTC,Yea that's why I was asking. I couldn't find the jersey on any website. I live in California too so I don't think it's possible for me to go to the Pepsi Center. :/
denvernuggets,31b9w8,tron777,2,Fri Apr 3 17:20:24 2015 UTC,"I shot a tweet out to the Nuggets, hopefully they respond. I also recommend you shoot an email to this address, it can't hurt!"
denvernuggets,31b9w8,NUGGman,2,Fri Apr 3 17:22:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for the help!
denvernuggets,31b9w8,NUGGman,3,Fri Apr 3 17:29:28 2015 UTC,They said you can call this number and find out what the jersey availability is for every player and type.  888-287-6847
denvernuggets,3189na,IdRatherBeLurking,7,Thu Apr 2 20:03:29 2015 UTC,"The Nuggets have to be very careful about their next coach.  Our TV ratings are way down, i bet attendance is too.  Does our FO want to risk losing more fans, and more money by giving hiring a coach who is unproven in the NBA? Everyone will point to Brad Stevens and say it worked out for Boston, But it could easily go the other way as we've seen with other very successful college coaches.  I guess it also depends on who is still on the team next year."
denvernuggets,3189na,denverNUGGs,2,Thu Apr 2 21:30:54 2015 UTC,"(Magic & Nuggets fan) I was scared he was gonna go to the Magic, so I equally don't like this.  2013 Article talking about Stevens & coaches who made the transition"

denvernuggets,3189na,Mayor_Of_Onett,2,Thu Apr 2 22:44:27 2015 UTC,"I wonder if he got a reality check talking to DeVos the owner and said ok nevermind.  That was 2007, so I don't exactly remember any details, but they got van gundy so it worked out, at least temporarily."

denvernuggets,3189na,fry_1,4,Thu Apr 2 20:15:46 2015 UTC,"I wonder if this means they are also considering my guy, Fred Hoiberg? I kinda assumed they didn't want another inexperienced guy, especially not one from the college ranks.  I'd strongly prefer Hoiberg to Donovan tho."

denvernuggets,315ky8,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Apr 2 04:03:48 2015 UTC,"Just wondering, but at this point will losing all the games left in the season give us a better pick in the lottery or are we going to end up in no mans land again?"
denvernuggets,315ky8,BlackCucco,3,Thu Apr 2 04:41:28 2015 UTC,"So if we lose out, we could possibly get the 6th spot. That's a 2% increase at best from our current spot at #7.  That's a lot closer to no man's land than it is to the promised land.   Happy cake day!"
denvernuggets,315ky8,tron777,3,Thu Apr 2 04:53:44 2015 UTC,"I'm fine anywhere in the top 10, really. Okafor and Towns look pretty close to a sure thing but I like all the options at 3-10.  Need to spend some more time with the Draft Express videos."
denvernuggets,315ky8,BlackCucco,2,Thu Apr 2 13:19:01 2015 UTC,"That's pretty disappointing, especially after going through this horrendous season, but I guess we just couldn't out tank the rest of the league. Also Thanks! I completely forgot that my cake day was today."

denvernuggets,314p09,Nugforlife,2,Thu Apr 2 02:15:26 2015 UTC,Can we lose enough of these 7 last games to move up into the number 6 spot in the draft lottery?
denvernuggets,314p09,Nugforlife,1 point,Thu Apr 2 02:45:25 2015 UTC,"We were able to a few games ago, I'll have to check the current standings. That only jumps us up 1% or so though, right?"
denvernuggets,31014e,growedup,3,Wed Apr 1 01:38:34 2015 UTC,Offcourse Faried wants Hunt to stay. Hunt plays more of a running system like Karl. Which obviously Faried had the more succes in
denvernuggets,31014e,SirJoris,3,Wed Apr 1 07:41:57 2015 UTC,I honestly hope the summer brings Fraied a jumpshot.
denvernuggets,31014e,SapoC,1 point,Wed Apr 1 13:42:39 2015 UTC,"Be careful what you wish for.  It's not very likely that Faried develops a useful jump shot. What we're more likely to get is Faried shooting a bunch of 30% jump shots that only serve to sap his efficiency and steer him away from his most potent offensive attribute, his offensive rebounding.  I'm much more comfortable with hoping that he improves defensively."
denvernuggets,31014e,tron777,2,Wed Apr 1 15:23:18 2015 UTC,"by very likely you mean ""this is what will happen"" ala every back-to-the-basket PF ever who worked on a jump shot"
denvernuggets,31014e,ParadeShitter,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:36:20 2015 UTC,Who are the idiots talking in the video? I think those guys need to be replaced by people who understand basketball.
denvernuggets,31014e,NUGGman,1 point,Fri Apr 3 23:18:15 2015 UTC,A good start to bring some success is to lose the remaining games.
denvernuggets,31014e,eathbau,0,Wed Apr 1 10:29:39 2015 UTC,They shouldn't have fired Shaw four weeks ago. Dude knew how to make this team lose.
denvernuggets,31014e,aatencio91,1 point,Wed Apr 1 18:16:44 2015 UTC,"I've thought a lot about the reasoning behind this decision. Obviously they kept him after the break because they felt that he would lose more games than any replacement could. Why then did they fire him two weeks later?  My best guess is that the locker room was so acidic, and in such disarray, that they felt keeping him would do more harm to the current players than the good that would come with a higher draft pick."
denvernuggets,31014e,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Wed Apr 1 18:34:02 2015 UTC,"I think the ""1-2-3 SIX WEEKS"" from the players really forced management's hand. They couldn't allow the players to completely quit the way they had, and I think you're right about Shaw doing more harm to the current players because of the way that the team so obviously quit on him."
denvernuggets,31014e,aatencio91,2,Wed Apr 1 18:49:53 2015 UTC,"They had not yet tried getting people to commit to season tickets for next season at All-Star break. They probably thought things were going alright. The firing came at the exact time they started trying to get commitments for season tickets for next season.  I have no doubt that those conversations weren't going well and that they couldn't get anybody to commit while saying that they were completely behind Shaw.   If anybody knows anyone who did buy season tickets for next year prior to Shaw being fired, let me know. I don't know anybody who was willing to do that."
denvernuggets,30w4xa,tc316tc,6,Tue Mar 31 04:36:40 2015 UTC,"He was very good, think Amare Stoudemire in his Phoenix days. He dropped off so suddenly because of a patellar tendon rupture in his knee that required micro-fracture surgery. The surgery wasn't as advanced as it is today, but it's still a really hard injury to deal with, and one that caused his all-star caliber career to never come to fruition as he dealt with the lingering issues of it for the rest of his career."
denvernuggets,30w4xa,OkAutopilot,3,Tue Mar 31 04:48:38 2015 UTC,Thanks for the answer but that has to suck so much for McDyess. A player averaging 20 and 10 to becoming a player off the bench just sucks.
denvernuggets,30w4xa,OkAutopilot,2,Tue Mar 31 04:51:59 2015 UTC,"It really is a shame, a story too often told in the NBA."
denvernuggets,30w4xa,kidhumbeats,2,Tue Mar 31 05:03:11 2015 UTC,"well he only had 2 seasons where he hit 20-10, or 20 or 10 for that matter."
denvernuggets,30w4xa,icarus_adam,4,Tue Mar 31 14:14:42 2015 UTC,"McDyess is one of my top 5 favorite Nuggets of all time. The dude really was great. I honestly think he would've had an extremely memorable career if it weren't for injuries and mediocre teams/circumstances.      He was a freak athlete. Someone compared him to Amare and I think athletically speaking that is a good comp.  McDyess was much better as a defender tho. He was a pretty smart player, especially on the defensive end.  On offense he had GREAT footwork.  Up and unders, he was great at facing the basket then giving a quick jab and spin move.  He had speed and explosiveness.  It's always hard to project how good a guy can be when his career was cut short but I think he would've been remembered as one of the best PF of that mid 90's to mid 00's era."
denvernuggets,30w4xa,icarus_adam,2,Tue Mar 31 07:33:37 2015 UTC,"Forgot to mention that he was a lot of fun to watch.  His game wasn't flashy but fundamentally flashy, I guess.  Really good footwork in the post and he could SMASH it on you if he beat you to the basket.  Ran the court well Soft touch on short and mid jumpers.  Fun guy to watch."
denvernuggets,30w4xa,isecretlyjudgeyou,0,Tue Mar 31 07:36:05 2015 UTC,Knee injuries. Period.

denvernuggets,30vw9w,tron777,2,Tue Mar 31 04:43:33 2015 UTC,Oh come on... The Nuggets always snag the international players
denvernuggets,30vw9w,azbycx1234,2,Tue Mar 31 06:34:49 2015 UTC,"either Stanley Johnson, kevon looney, or kristaps porzingis"
denvernuggets,30vw9w,bettycrockerpot,2,Tue Mar 31 06:44:15 2015 UTC,Honestly I think having Mario Hezonja would be really beneficial with all the other euro guys.
denvernuggets,30uwv6,DariosDentist,2,Mon Mar 30 22:24:35 2015 UTC,"Current players off the top of my head...  G Erick Green  F Joffrey Lauvergne  G Will Barton  We currently have F/C Nikola Jokic  stashed in Serbia, and own the rights to G Cenk Akyol."
denvernuggets,30uwv6,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Mon Mar 30 23:27:19 2015 UTC,"That's all I can think of too, I'd like to see a core big man duo of Nurkic and Jokic in the future"
denvernuggets,30uwv6,trentyz,2,Tue Mar 31 01:23:39 2015 UTC,"Jokic has been dominating the Adriatic league. 2 time player of the month last I checked. There was a post not too long ago that said he was a better version of Joffrey Lauvergne, and 3 year younger at that.  I don't know much about Akyol, but he's 27, I doubt he'll make it to the NBA."
denvernuggets,30uwv6,with2nns,2,Tue Mar 31 01:29:32 2015 UTC,"He was a throw in for the McGee trade, I agree that he won't have much of a chance.   Jokic is an interesting prospect, I'm really hoping they bring him in this summer. From what Connelly has said, that's exactly what they plan to do."
denvernuggets,30uwv6,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Mar 31 01:52:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for replying! Denver is definitely one of a handful of teams who seem like they rebuking I to this strategy. What are your feelings on stashing and developing players overseas?
denvernuggets,30uwv6,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:00:18 2015 UTC,"Well hopefully it pays off- we're probably a year or two away from finding out if the current batch has worked out. Barton playing in the D league seemed to have helped him, but Erick Green might not even have a place on the team next year. Lauvergne is 50/50, and we have high hopes for Jokic but you never know."
denvernuggets,30uj4v,aatencio91,4,Mon Mar 30 20:44:02 2015 UTC,"Milsap, Monroe, Middleton, Wes Matthews, DeMarre Carroll, Amir Johnson, Antic are all guys I can see us having interest in."
denvernuggets,30uj4v,OkAutopilot,3,Mon Mar 30 21:03:24 2015 UTC,Tobias Harris too
denvernuggets,30uj4v,with2nns,2,Mon Mar 30 22:01:07 2015 UTC,"Worth a look for sure. He'll be a cheaper guy. Frankly our biggest issue is weeding out our 4/5 position. We just have a bunch of guys who can't defend and are undersized, I'd like for Faried to be the only player on the team that fits that description."
denvernuggets,30uj4v,OkAutopilot,2,Mon Mar 30 22:18:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think Harris will come cheap, he's a 22 year old averaging 17 & 6. I think we're pretty set a 4/5. Assuming we keep Faried and don't resign DA we'll have Faried, Lauvergne who is big for a PF, although I don't know about his defense, Nurkic, a (hopefully) wild card in Jokic, and, unfortunately, Hickson."
denvernuggets,30uj4v,with2nns,3,Tue Mar 31 01:35:18 2015 UTC,"Kawhi, right guys? right? What about Kevin Love?  I definitely hope we re-sign Jameer and extend Barton. Looks like Mean and Ruthless Kosta Kofus will be available."
denvernuggets,30uj4v,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Mon Mar 30 21:23:40 2015 UTC,Do we have the money to realistically be in the conversation for someone like Kawhi or Love?
denvernuggets,30uj4v,tebam,3,Mon Mar 30 21:35:13 2015 UTC,"With McGee gone and potential trades I think we'll have the money, but I doubt we have chance at signing these guys it. I'm no GM, but I get the feeling we're an ""overpay for tier 2 free agents"" kind of team."

denvernuggets,30uj4v,AnonymousAltar,2,Mon Apr 6 02:03:25 2015 UTC,"I think that's when he still thought he could succeed on Bron's team. Who knows, honestly."
denvernuggets,30srg9,NiceGuyFinish1st,9,Mon Mar 30 12:08:33 2015 UTC,"Gary Harris:  Pros:   He's a pro-level defender that has good size, strength and speed. He has a nose for the ball and makes smart defensive plays which lead to fast breaks   Cons:   He can't seem to shoot on an NBA level, even when given ample time. I don't know if it's a confidence issue or what, but the kid needs to start hitting his buckets or he won't have a spot on any team.   Jusuf Nurkic:  Pros:   high level speed and positioning for a 7fter. He is able to force just about anybody to alter their shot when they try and drive on him, no matter their size. Great hands and great passing ability Only 20 years old   Cons:   4th in the league in fouls per 36 minutes. He also complains about a large number of those fouls, whether they were justified or not. Has the vertical of an elephant Lackluster handles in the post, is too easily stripped for a guy his size."
denvernuggets,30srg9,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Mon Mar 30 14:40:20 2015 UTC,"Concerning Gary, I think a shot can be worked on. Defense and size is something that isn't as easy for guys to learn."

denvernuggets,30srg9,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Thu Apr 2 01:31:47 2015 UTC,"I really like Nurkic (don't we all?). He tries hard, does a pretty decent job of protecting the rim, and he has a mean streak that I really appreciate. At times I think he could be a little more patient, he seems to rush right into hook shots when he gets the ball in the post. He also will need to work on staying out of foul trouble.  Gary Harris has shown flashes of what he might be able to become someday. I really like when he is aggressive and attacks the rim off the dribble. He seems like he will be a very competent defensive player on the perimeter. I had no idea his shooting numbers were as bad as they are though. He is shooting something like 17% from 3. That number has to go up for him to be able to stay on the floor and get the playing time he will need to develop.  That being said, I haven't watched a game in while, and I am by no means a basketball expert."
denvernuggets,30srg9,TriceraScotts,2,Mon Mar 30 14:19:06 2015 UTC,This topic deserves more attention
denvernuggets,30srg9,eathbau,2,Tue Mar 31 20:17:14 2015 UTC,"Problem is that both of them have been ruined by the coaches refusing to play them. Did you see Harris' first rotation game? He destroyed Indiana. Dude knew he was getting minutes. Nurkic's first 3/4 of the season had been awesome, arguably the best rookie in the league. Shaw post Afflalo trade started to embrace the rebuild but then got fired. Now Hunt has stalled their development and it's really obvious by their body language. They're just unconfident right now, they know they'll get pulled when they make a mistake and that they won't get minutes.  Overall I think it's a failed rookie season for the rookies. Ironically we've had most success with rookies with Karl who has a reputation of not playing rookies. I just hope those two have had enough minutes to be better next year because young players don't suddenly become good players by sitting on the bench and not playing."

denvernuggets,30rv9r,tebam,2,Mon Mar 30 04:18:12 2015 UTC,Sorry it took me so long to put these pictures up! Life has been a little crazy lately and I haven't even hardly been on reddit the past couple weeks.  All the pics were taken on an Iphone 6 Plus so thats why some of them came out a bit fuzzy.  I have a few pretty cool videos too but for some reason they won't upload.  Ill try and edit them on as soon as I figure it out!
denvernuggets,30rv9r,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Mon Mar 30 04:20:45 2015 UTC,Would love to see those videos too! This looks like an awesome experience. I fucking love that picture of Marlowe doing his makeup lol I'd expect nothing less.
denvernuggets,30rv9r,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Mon Mar 30 14:07:43 2015 UTC,"Haha ya that was pretty funny. It was awesome though, 10/10 would recommend you go next time they do one of the ticket bundles!"

denvernuggets,30o79l,BlackCucco,3,Sun Mar 29 04:43:18 2015 UTC,I think we would have won if we had 2 Jukas  *Or if Juka could play the whole game. I only saw the second half but while he was in he did a solid job of making Aldridge's life difficult and when he wasn't in no one made Aldridge's life difficult.
denvernuggets,30nkmm,trentyz,8,Sun Mar 29 00:42:51 2015 UTC,"Funny story, I was up in Denver for a Broncos game 2 years ago. The day after the game my gf and I were going to check out the store in the Pepsi Center.  We see Quincy Miller (didn't really know who he was, he was just signed to the Nuggets) walking away from the Can with ice wrapped around his knees.  He missed whatever team shuttle he was supposed to catch because he was practicing his shooting.  Anyway, we asked him for an autograph and he said sure, but we didn't have anything to sign-we were in my step mother's immaculately clean car. So we found the Broncos game stub and he signed that.  I asked him if he needed a ride and he looked at us a little apprehensively, and thought about the distance he had to walk (embassy suites quite a few blocks away), looked back at us, saw that we were wearing Nuggets gear, which was completely unintended, it's just clothes we just happened to throw on that day.  So he hops in and we give him a ride!  He was way cool.  I almost wanted to scold him for getting into a car with complete strangers.  Haha.  Anyway, he let us take some shots too. http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b67/chucho320/image.jpg1.jpg http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b67/chucho320/image.jpg2.jpg http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b67/chucho320/image.jpg3.jpg"

denvernuggets,30nkmm,rvhack,3,Sun Mar 29 03:27:45 2015 UTC,I don't think he gets in to the rotation as a wing with us unless we move one or two in a trade like you said.

denvernuggets,30nmka,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Sun Mar 29 01:00:12 2015 UTC,Melvin actually started Hickson over Nurkic?
denvernuggets,30nmka,eathbau,1 point,Sun Mar 29 02:22:52 2015 UTC,Still easing him back.
denvernuggets,30nmka,eathbau,2,Sun Mar 29 02:23:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly Nurkic has been playing like someone who has given up being a rotation player under Melvin. We don't even run post ups for him anymore, I fear for Nurkic's future if Hunt is the coach."
denvernuggets,30nmka,SapoC,1 point,Sun Mar 29 02:45:19 2015 UTC,Wrong. Jj=GOAT. He's finally developing under Melvin. Give him another two years to beast out.

denvernuggets,30nmka,Nugforlife,2,Sun Mar 29 02:34:19 2015 UTC,Nurkic needs to be in at this point. JJ is just too short to be a rim protector against aldridge.

denvernuggets,30kegk,BlackCucco,2,Sat Mar 28 04:34:59 2015 UTC,AND JJ WITH THE REAL PERFORMANCE OF THE NIGHT WHAT A STAR
denvernuggets,30kegk,OkAutopilot,3,Sat Mar 28 05:07:23 2015 UTC,Pretty good game overall. They were outstanding from the three point line throughout the whole game!
denvernuggets,30kcyq,pairidaeza,4,Sat Mar 28 03:07:52 2015 UTC,DA probably won't get resigned and I doubt we'll pick up Foye's Team option. I could also see Green or Harris involved in a draft day trade. Nelson has a player option for 3.25 Million next year. He could probably make more in free agency so it will depend on how he feels about his situation here.
denvernuggets,30kcyq,Tskitishvili,2,Sat Mar 28 08:16:10 2015 UTC,"Supposedly Jameer stayed on the trade deadline because he likes it here. If we trade Ty, I'm fine with him starting for us. Dude can ball."
denvernuggets,30kcyq,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Sat Mar 28 17:30:49 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, jameer liked Shaw.  So I don't know if he has the same motivation to stay"
denvernuggets,30kcyq,denverNUGGs,2,Sat Mar 28 20:35:14 2015 UTC,"Eh, he's played even better after Shaw left. We'll see!"
denvernuggets,30kcyq,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Sat Mar 28 22:32:50 2015 UTC,Hopefully Hickson and Foye.
denvernuggets,30kcyq,eathbau,7,Sat Mar 28 03:28:17 2015 UTC,I'll keep Foye over JJ and DA.
denvernuggets,30kcyq,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Sat Mar 28 05:08:10 2015 UTC,I kinda like JJ and DA but we do have a bit of a jam in the front court. Dare I say we try and trade Faried for a higher pick? Or is that blasphemy?
denvernuggets,30kcyq,f0xpuppy,5,Sat Mar 28 05:09:45 2015 UTC,Faried's almost reverted back to full Manimal since Shaw left - i'd say keep him. His contract may be hard to move anyway plus he's way better than JJ.  I'd like to keep Foye but more as a backup 2.  If anyone were to go it'd probably be Jameer :(
denvernuggets,30kcyq,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Sat Mar 28 05:25:31 2015 UTC,That's basically it- we need to trim fat at PF one way or another.
denvernuggets,30kcyq,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Sat Mar 28 05:53:43 2015 UTC,What do you make of this Frank Kominsky fella Kiszla wrote about?
denvernuggets,30kcyq,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Sat Mar 28 06:26:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly I skimmed the article because I have a long lasting hate for Kiszla, but I've got it stashed for the weekly roundup and I was planning to get to it this weekend."
denvernuggets,30kcyq,nickolai21,2,Sat Mar 28 06:29:02 2015 UTC,"I skimmed as well, but it's worth checking out Kaminsky's highlights. Dude can ball.  PS how was the concert?"
denvernuggets,30kcyq,growedup,2,Sat Mar 28 06:31:32 2015 UTC,"Will do.  It was better than I expected. Andrew McMahon is a pretty great musician, even if I don't dig his stuff. I'm a big fan of live music in general so it's hard for me to have a bad time at a show.  Oh and there were a ton of beautiful ladies there, although the pair of 14 year olds attached to my hip didn't help my game at all.   Overall it was a good night, I love playing the cool older cousin role. I'm 100% more sober than I usually am right now though so it's time to get on that."
denvernuggets,30kcyq,growedup,2,Sat Mar 28 06:37:51 2015 UTC,I enjoy live music but I hate lip syncing so I almost never see a major concert out of principal.  Sounds like you've earned a drink! Enjoy it.
denvernuggets,30kcyq,rvhack,2,Sat Mar 28 06:42:25 2015 UTC,"I never played basketball so this is a little confusing for me, looking at this highlight, the article its is says his footwork is great, but to me, it looks like he travels by picking up his pivot foot to get that last spin around the defender? Am I crazy?"
denvernuggets,30kcyq,ParadeShitter,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:08:03 2015 UTC,I can't tell from that angle.
denvernuggets,30kcyq,with2nns,2,Mon Mar 30 22:37:05 2015 UTC,Kiszla is stupid.
denvernuggets,30kcyq,trentyz,2,Sat Mar 28 09:12:25 2015 UTC,And bad.
denvernuggets,30kcyq,kidhumbeats,2,Sat Mar 28 09:12:34 2015 UTC,"I think you're right about the jam in the front court.   I think JJ and DA go. I like Hickson at the 4 but it's detrimental to keep him at center. He's just too small. Darrell is a technically sound defender but his offense and rebounding aren't enough to make him worth resigning. I appreciate the idea of a stretch 4 but he isn't efficient enough to take long 2's and 3's as often as he does and he lacks a consistent post game (the two things someone like L. Aldridge do well as a model stretch 4.)  Behind those two we have Joffrey who, after just being brought over, I doubt gets cut. He seems like a talented guy with a nice touch around the basket and upside. I'd feel alot more comfortable with him at 6'11"" stepping in at center when it's necessary than JJ.  We really only have one true rim protector in Juka and it's clear the impact that has on the floor when you compare our defense with and without him in the middle.  I think/hope we bring in another center. The balance of four power forwards and one center has to change. If we kept JJ but committed to only playing him at the 4 that would be acceptable but only possible if another center is in the rotation. DA would be the oddman out and I'm ok with Joffrey getting the playing time. If we really want to play the stretch 4 we have two great options in Gallo and Chandler.  I'm not sure if Foye stays or goes. I think either way there should be competition for starting off guard. Maybe it's Barton but some would say he's best as a second unit guy. Maybe Gary can take on a bigger role. I doubt we attract someone better than Randy in free agency unless there's a risk or a catch to them (Lance Stephenson?) Anything could happen in the draft and that's not something I'd claim to be knowledgeable about.  **I forgot about Ian Clark. He's 6'3"" and 173 lbs. He might work in to the guard rotation but it's more likely he rides the pine based on how often Erick and Gary, likely both ahead of him on the depth chart, have been given minutes.  *Foye, JJ and DA would be my bubble guys. I hope the FO and coaching staff can have confidence in our younger players, we got those draft picks for a reason. I think that's how you accumulate assets on good contracts and hopefully find the ""next big thing"". We aren't NY or LA so superstars aren't likely to fall in our laps."

denvernuggets,30c2cz,IdRatherBeNurking,1 point,Thu Mar 26 14:01:40 2015 UTC,The turnovers on both ends had me rolling my eyes more times than I can count. Sloppy ball all around.
denvernuggets,30c2cz,eathbau,3,Thu Mar 26 14:10:34 2015 UTC,"Sorry guys going to go against the grain here.  I'm over Hunt. Not the right coach for us IMO. I know players love him but all I could think of was an extreme George Karl. Extreme as in overplay of average veterans, ignoring the need to develop players, running an offense that is reliant on a gimmicky super small lineup. We know how that worked for us in the playoffs."
denvernuggets,30c2cz,IdRatherBeNurking,4,Thu Mar 26 03:39:08 2015 UTC,"As far as overpaying veterans, that could be just because he is now coaching for a head job. And as soon as nurkic is 100% we'll probably see a Lawson/Chandler/Gallo/Faried/Nurkic starting lineup, that's a big lineup. I am not completely sold on hunt for the reasons you mentioned but I think we should wait until at least the end of the season to truly see how he looks."
denvernuggets,30c2cz,rvhack,3,Thu Mar 26 04:04:31 2015 UTC,"100% or not, Nurkic put up 14 and 7 on good percentages in his previous two games. That is not a reason to move him out of the starting lineup. If it was someone like James Harden or Dwayne Wade coming back then I'd understand. But we're talking about Randy Foye here, who is so insignificant to our wins and losses. I also think it's the coaches job to recognize when his younger players are more beneficial to his veterans."
denvernuggets,30c2cz,BlackCucco,2,Thu Mar 26 07:00:07 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you there. If Nurkic continues to come off the bench (along with harris, green, and lauvernge barely playing at all) then I think hunt is not the right coach. I just think that we should give him more time. IMO, 12? games is not a large enough sample size to judge a coach."
denvernuggets,30c2cz,friendo_not_friend,2,Thu Mar 26 14:41:46 2015 UTC,"I think you're too easily dismissing how hard it is to balance the egos of the veteran NBA players. With Juka still apparently not at 100%, who do you tell to sit down in his place? Foye? Gallo? Chandler? You sure as hell can't tell Faried that or he may not play for you for the rest of the season. It's a hell of a balancing act, and I can understand how hard it is to bench one of these guys."

denvernuggets,30bd9c,SapoC,2,Thu Mar 26 01:14:52 2015 UTC,"He used to coach under pop and coached Australia. His dad was a longtime coach too. If you ever watch interview you can just tell he has this different type of passion to coach and improve. His ""specialty"" is defense."
denvernuggets,30bd9c,teensonacid,2,Thu Mar 26 01:16:35 2015 UTC,Sounds like a great coach. I'll try and check out his post game interview!
denvernuggets,30bd9c,Nugforlife,3,Thu Mar 26 01:17:28 2015 UTC,so what happened
denvernuggets,30bd9c,nuggetpride,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:24:37 2015 UTC,"We missed every shot we took. At least the guys looked disappointed, unlike under Shaw."
denvernuggets,30bd9c,Nugforlife,2,Thu Mar 26 03:31:48 2015 UTC,Taking that 3 from Ty was a huge turn in the start of this game. C'mon refs pull your heads out!!
denvernuggets,30bd9c,friendo_not_friend,2,Thu Mar 26 01:16:02 2015 UTC,refs fucked up.

denvernuggets,30bd9c,teensonacid,4,Thu Mar 26 01:07:24 2015 UTC,neck beards are straight CASH..get with it mayne
denvernuggets,30bd9c,teensonacid,2,Thu Mar 26 01:09:25 2015 UTC,It is the source of his power.
denvernuggets,309qif,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Wed Mar 25 16:59:26 2015 UTC,"While he hasn't been the most consistent player this season, he always works hard on the court and has noticeably tried to improve his game. Happy Birthday 00!"
denvernuggets,309m3u,AlienDeg,3,Wed Mar 25 16:26:24 2015 UTC,"What's the sample size like? He hasn't played too much and the one 40 point game probably skews it a bit. That's awesome though, I hope he can keep up this pace."
denvernuggets,309m3u,MisterSeaCucumber,2,Wed Mar 25 18:18:29 2015 UTC,"He is true shooting .548 which is above average but nowhere near elite (Korver is at .711?!).  If he's good in those situations, what is he sucking at to get down to .548?"
denvernuggets,309m3u,tron777,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:29:22 2015 UTC,Anyone mind explaining all of this? I don't particularly know what any of those stats mean.
denvernuggets,309m3u,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Wed Mar 25 16:35:30 2015 UTC,"Points per play in isolation, points per play in pick and roll when you are ball handler, poits per play when you posting up and points per play in pick and roll when you are screener"

denvernuggets,306myq,phatlever,3,Wed Mar 25 17:15:35 2015 UTC,"Totally. While it seems like these guys are just going with the flow when you watch on TV, it's awesome to get a glimpse like this into the inner workings of what's happening on the court. Mad props to Mike Conley."
denvernuggets,306myq,skipaBturner,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:16:43 2015 UTC,Since when was the spin move ty's go to move? I didn't think that

denvernuggets,306apa,OkAutopilot,2,Wed Mar 25 00:46:48 2015 UTC,Shit people try and sell these? I have one sitting in my closet I have no interest in (I like the new logo and the rainbow logo but not this one). It's xl if anyone wants it you are welcome to it.
denvernuggets,306apa,bzzltyr,2,Wed Mar 25 01:44:40 2015 UTC,Where you located? I'd take it :) is it the same one as the one linked?
denvernuggets,306apa,TaylorHammond9,2,Wed Mar 25 02:57:32 2015 UTC,Here's a quick link to my front and back. It's slightly different it's the starter jacket type that only zips half way.   http://imgur.com/cdY6zrP http://imgur.com/JWBuX88  I live west side in morrison (c470 and 285) but work in Broomfield a couple days a week if that location is easier. If that works and you want it just let me know.
denvernuggets,306apa,bzzltyr,2,Wed Mar 25 03:54:27 2015 UTC,If you want to PM me where in Broomfield you'd be I think we can make something work :)
denvernuggets,306apa,TaylorHammond9,2,Wed Mar 25 04:04:46 2015 UTC,"Cool, glad to see it find a good home. I'll be up there on thursday between 9 and 4:30 or so. I can meet up around lunch or after. I'm over close to the flatirons mall area. If not next week I'm up there tues and thurs."

denvernuggets,305dr2,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Tue Mar 24 16:58:13 2015 UTC,I've been waiting for him to wrap up the series so I can make a big post about it. I'll probably get around to it later this week!
denvernuggets,305dr2,icarus_adam,5,Tue Mar 24 17:01:10 2015 UTC,Got one more coming Thursday/Friday.  It will be my ranking of the coaches as well as some general thoughts of mine about how the Nuggets should handle their coaching staff.

denvernuggets,302duy,DtownAndOut,12,Mon Mar 23 22:45:47 2015 UTC,"I was in contact with the Nuggets PR dude, he was a cool guy!"

denvernuggets,302duy,kipmix,6,Mon Mar 23 23:52:35 2015 UTC,It did take a while to do and it was the 'right place right time' situation as well! I have no interest in pursuing a career in media (although it was an awesome day) but yeah man I'm sure the Nugs will assist you in your trip if you get in contact with them :)
denvernuggets,302duy,IdRatherBeLurking,8,Tue Mar 24 00:00:30 2015 UTC,"Also shoutout to /u/kipmix, cheers for coming along brother"
denvernuggets,302duy,kipmix,9,Tue Mar 24 00:01:42 2015 UTC,Thanks my man! That was a blast. And I'm glad I showed what a good burrito is so you didn't go home telling people how great Chipotle was.
denvernuggets,302duy,The_NGUYENNER,7,Tue Mar 24 01:00:01 2015 UTC,Haha thanks for reppin' our city friend.

denvernuggets,302duy,icarus_adam,6,Tue Mar 24 02:38:49 2015 UTC,That burrito was amazing. And that drinks machine is futuristic. The next best thing we have back home is Subway hahaha.
denvernuggets,302duy,tron777,2,Tue Mar 24 02:38:35 2015 UTC,the one with a shitload of options on the screen and you navigate/pick the one you want??  hahahaha that thing blew my mind when I first saw it
denvernuggets,302duy,icarus_adam,3,Tue Mar 24 16:34:46 2015 UTC,"YESSSSS, we don't have that stuff back home. I'm pretty sure I ended up having some sort of vanilla cherry coke, it was amazing."

denvernuggets,302duy,jpthehp,2,Mon Mar 23 23:15:22 2015 UTC,I feel ya. Didn't he only just announce his retirement though?
denvernuggets,302duy,Enthed,4,Mon Mar 23 23:23:27 2015 UTC,I'm the tall goofy dude in the back of THIS one.  That is cool that Nuggets PR (Gelt) hooked you up with that opportunity.  If I would've known you were there I would've said hey and maybe even tried to get you an autograph or two.  Looks like you had a blast.
denvernuggets,302duy,bunge,3,Tue Mar 24 06:31:45 2015 UTC,Maaaate I walked past you a few times! That would have been awesome to meet up. Cheers dude I really had a great time.
denvernuggets,302duy,pairidaeza,3,Tue Mar 24 07:46:45 2015 UTC,"Woah, not what I was expecting. The mustache on your twitter avatar really threw me off, apparently. How tall are you?"
denvernuggets,302duy,pairidaeza,4,Tue Mar 24 16:38:17 2015 UTC,"Haha!  Sadly,I'm not nearly as cool looking as my twitter avatar.  If I could grow a mustache like that, I would in a heartbeat.       I am 6'5"""
denvernuggets,302duy,pairidaeza,2,Tue Mar 24 17:31:19 2015 UTC,Does Dempsey always get that side spot?
denvernuggets,302duy,pairidaeza,3,Tue Mar 24 15:34:36 2015 UTC,"Yep.  He, Blake Olson and Chris Marlow get their spots.  Everyone else fills in. I'm super tall so I always stand in the back."
denvernuggets,302duy,MikeyG69,3,Tue Mar 24 16:34:03 2015 UTC,"A) Super jealous. I've been a fan for years, live down the block from Pepsi Center and try to take in as many games a year as I can. But never, have I ever had this kind of treatment - and I've worked with the PR guy before!  B) how does someone in New Zealand become such a big fan of the team? Just out of curiosity …"
denvernuggets,302duy,SirJoris,4,Tue Mar 24 00:43:35 2015 UTC,"They treated me really well, probs to the Pepsi Center team.   Funny question, and that's something EVERYONE asked. I wanted to live in Colorado when I was younger but I loved the Melo/Iverson duo when I was 11 back in '06, kinda just stuck with the team since then. Now I'm living the dream! Very fortunate but Colorado lived up to its expectations, I really want to return!"
denvernuggets,302duy,Lough5280,3,Tue Mar 24 02:41:48 2015 UTC,"It's a great place to live, or visit if that's the only option. Trust me when I say there's many Nuggets fans who are very jealous of the experience you had!"
denvernuggets,302ikl,denverNUGGs,3,Mon Mar 23 23:10:51 2015 UTC,"And there you have it, folks.  If you're Josh or TC, what are you going to do? Ignore Gallo? A man who is possibly the most important player for the franchise going forward.  This is great news. Hunt really deserves this."
denvernuggets,302ikl,pairidaeza,2,Tue Mar 24 06:55:46 2015 UTC,I think we should still go with D'antoni. He's the better option for success. Do we really think that we'd lose Melvin? I don't see anyone else as high on him as we are here in state.  Keep him as an assistant.   It's hard to deny Melvin but imagine what Mike D'antoni could do with our team. Imagine what Nurkic's passing ability and toughness could do in that offense and defense. I don't think D'antoni has ever had anything like Nurk to work with before.
denvernuggets,302ikl,SapoC,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:44:08 2015 UTC,"what are you going to do? Ignore Gallo?     Not ignore him per se, but...pretty much yes?"
denvernuggets,302ikl,tilla23,1 point,Wed Mar 25 04:30:47 2015 UTC,I don't think Josh appreciates having his hands tied. Its my running theory that's the reason he fired Karl. Hopefully he has matured since then.
denvernuggets,301vdo,trentyz,5,Mon Mar 23 20:24:30 2015 UTC,"Haha, I rewatched this video and I sound like a porpoise but damn I was happy!"
denvernuggets,301vdo,NUGGman,2,Mon Mar 23 20:24:53 2015 UTC,As you should have been. That was awesome!
denvernuggets,301vdo,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Wed Mar 25 14:59:44 2015 UTC,Man I can't believe you caught that on film! It was the highlight of the game. You sounded exactly like I did when I saw it happen.
denvernuggets,301vdo,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Mon Mar 23 20:32:16 2015 UTC,"I was unprepared as you can see cause it's a vertical video hahaha, but dude definitely a highlight of the game!"
denvernuggets,301vdo,skipaBturner,2,Mon Mar 23 20:33:41 2015 UTC,It looked even faster from your angle. Can't wait to see more like this out of the young gun from Michigan State
denvernuggets,301vdo,MikeyG69,2,Mon Mar 23 20:35:01 2015 UTC,"I agree man, he showed promise in the games I watched. I always have faith in our rookies and hopefully he and Nurkic (and Joff) shine"

denvernuggets,2zykem,denverNUGGs,10,Mon Mar 23 00:29:58 2015 UTC,Of course Gallo goes off while I'm watching NCAA basketball instead

denvernuggets,2zykem,TriceraScotts,4,Mon Mar 23 00:33:58 2015 UTC,I did the same thing :(. I have never heard anyone be as upset over a sporting event as the guy who lives above me was after Kansas lost.

denvernuggets,2zykem,DtownAndOut,5,Mon Mar 23 00:32:35 2015 UTC,Damn you Gallo. Damn you for getting me excited for next year.  Happy to see him kicking ass! Especially at how frustrated he was early in the season.
denvernuggets,2zykem,DtownAndOut,2,Mon Mar 23 00:36:25 2015 UTC,Is there anyway to watch the game if you missed it?
denvernuggets,2zykem,tron777,3,Mon Mar 23 05:29:59 2015 UTC,"Here's all of Gallo's 40 pts, and you can watch the replay here. Don't forget your adblock, etc."

denvernuggets,2zxurh,teensonacid,3,Sun Mar 22 23:07:54 2015 UTC,The tournament is great and all but watching college ball this weekend really makes me appreciate the NBA game.

denvernuggets,2zxurh,teensonacid,2,Sun Mar 22 23:45:27 2015 UTC,The tournament is legitimately awesome. Single elimination means every second is pressure packed and the NBA just doesn't have anything like that. I just don't enjoy the basketball like I do NBA games.
denvernuggets,2zxurh,Nugforlife,3,Sun Mar 22 23:49:48 2015 UTC,"I guess I've never had a team to root for, and with the turnover they get I find it hard to get attached."

We were close to the Magic's bench and during a timeout Fournier was close enough to hear this dude. The guy yells out  ""HEY FOURNIER! YOUR HAIRCUT LOOKS.....SILLY!"" Fournier gave a quick glance towards our direction and every one started to laugh. It sounded like the guy was going to use a more vulgar adjective for Fournier's hair but stumbled into ""silly."""

The three games I went to were Golden State, Atlanta and New York, so I got to see three double digit wins in a row! I'll upload some photos soon but I loved it.

denvernuggets,2zq7ie,jd61,10,Fri Mar 20 18:45:24 2015 UTC,didn't the nuggets basically draft him to trade to utah as in the jazz essentially made the pick anyway?
denvernuggets,2zq7ie,ParadeShitter,4,Fri Mar 20 18:58:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah. We probably wouldn't have even picked him even if we had the pick. We traded our pick to Utah prior to our selection and they effectively said ""okay, draft Gobert for us."" Similar to how we actually drafted McDermott this year. Plus if we had Gobert showing potential we probably never would have drafted Nurk and"
denvernuggets,2zq7ie,MileHighPride30,1 point,Fri Mar 20 19:27:13 2015 UTC,And that's how and why we got Ty Lawson. Minnesota drafted 3 pgs in that first round in 2009 and only kept Ricky Rubio. They drafted Lawson with the intention to trade it immediately to Denver. Mark Warkentein was in love with Lawson.
denvernuggets,2zq7ie,drmeattornado,2,Sat Mar 21 17:38:11 2015 UTC,"I wonder if we would have ever drafted Nurkic at all then, considering we would have him and Mozgov.   I'm trying to remember what our justification was for trading down. Couldn't have just been the cash."
denvernuggets,2zq7ie,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Fri Mar 20 19:00:24 2015 UTC,"Could be wrong, But I think picking a 2nd rounder rather than 1st made it easier to stash Green for a year as we already had 15 committed roster spots.  That and cash considerations."

denvernuggets,2zqzfp,CooolName1,3,Fri Mar 20 23:52:43 2015 UTC,faried got those 2 steals on the boxscore but nurk was the one that poked out both of them on the pass.

denvernuggets,2zp8pc,growedup,2,Fri Mar 20 18:31:55 2015 UTC,So I'm embarrassed to say that I've never given a serious listen to his music. Where should I start?
denvernuggets,2zp8pc,tron777,3,Fri Mar 20 15:59:05 2015 UTC,The new album.  Good Kid Mad City probably has more bangers but To Pimp a Butterfly is more impressive as a whole.
denvernuggets,2zp8pc,rvhack,3,Fri Mar 20 16:02:57 2015 UTC,Section 80 is also a good option
denvernuggets,2zp8pc,tron777,2,Fri Mar 20 18:31:01 2015 UTC,Section 80 didn't hit me like the others but I'll probably go back and give it some more time after hearing his latest.
denvernuggets,2zp8pc,TriceraScotts,2,Fri Mar 20 18:50:02 2015 UTC,"I honestly love all of them. GKMC is incredible, definitely has more bangers as stated above.

I will admit that resting Gallo was/is probably prudent, but sitting Ty and Faried was just lame. I know I am in the minority of fans that actually want the Nuggets to win, but I just thought that whole thing turned out so ugly. Maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if Dempsey hadn't tweeted, ""To be clear: #Nuggets Interim head coach Melvin Hunt & his staff aren't choosing to rest players. Nor are players asking to be rested.""  You know it's bad when Wilson Chandler actually gives you  a real human opinion.

denvernuggets,2zixru,weiner_cleaner,18,Wed Mar 18 23:19:42 2015 UTC,"Why would we trade anyone who has been relatively healthy for Rose.  I don't care if he was an MVP, he's the most injury prone player in the NBA."
denvernuggets,2zixru,denverNUGGs,5,Wed Mar 18 23:46:33 2015 UTC,He's like the new Anfernee Hardaway.
denvernuggets,2zixru,drumner,7,Thu Mar 19 00:15:43 2015 UTC,"Ty AND Faried/Gallo?  Even just Ty is ridiculous given Rose's injury history and contract- but Ty and one of our other best players?  Simmons can be entertaining occasionally, but he has no idea what he is talking about most of the time.  The vast majority of the trades he proposes are just absurd."
denvernuggets,2zixru,Guper,4,Thu Mar 19 02:51:25 2015 UTC,"Ty > Rose at this point. They'd need to sweeten the deal, not us."
denvernuggets,2zixru,GorillaBuddy,6,Thu Mar 19 06:12:36 2015 UTC,no reason for anyone to really pay attention to denver basketball atm so i'm not surprised bill has no idea. russillo said some things that were accurate so there's that.  as far as anybody trading for d-rose and his monster contract at this point all i have to say is: lol  simmon's nailed it when he said it's like when other animals can smell or sense a dying animal. i doubt many guys in the league would be enthused to play with d-rose at this point
denvernuggets,2zixru,ParadeShitter,7,Thu Mar 19 00:55:55 2015 UTC,"Bill Simmons is absolutely, diabolically retarded when it comes to his assessment of Denver. He's never had a kind or insightful word to say about the team or the franchise. I don't read Grantland as a result anymore. He's a total goose."

You're selling yourself short man. Zach Lowe did multiple features about the Nuggets during there 57 win session, he did a large piece on Faried last year, and he fucking loves Nurkic. Plus Rembert Browne seems to write nothing but straight fire, so there's that."

He was definitely more correct in his assessment of the Nuggets the last two preseasons than I was.   And honestly how many teams with worse records than the Nuggets have you gone out of your way to watch this year? I mean, homeboys gotta make time for the Celtics in between having Clippers season tickets, Kings season tickets, The Grantland Basketball Hour, The B.S. Report, the new Bill Don't Lie podcast, having a family, and being Editor in Chief of one of my favorite websites. There's not a lot of time in there to watch a team that was, for the most part, miserable to watch this year.  Edit: And panic/ over anxious management trades are one of Bill's things he likes to talk about."
denvernuggets,2zixru,TriceraScotts,3,Sat Mar 21 02:17:40 2015 UTC,"First reaction. NO.   After thinking about it, still no. Ty is better than derrick at this point, no disrespect to what derrick has done but ty is healthier and more capable. Ty is a better shooter, distributor and is just as fast if not faster than a healthy derrick will be."

denvernuggets,2zgeon,asdfqwerasdfqwerasdf,9,Wed Mar 18 11:00:38 2015 UTC,"Whatever, we sat some guys on a b2b. I don't really see what the big deal is. If the players are upset maybe they should do a little better than 26-42 next season. WC has probably been the one veteran who has consistently shown up all season, so I think he does have more of a right to be frustrated than anyone else."
denvernuggets,2zgeon,Dunkman77,2,Wed Mar 18 12:10:04 2015 UTC,"So you wanted to know what the big deal is in the first sentence, but then go on to say Wilson has a right to be frustrated. I am confused."

denvernuggets,2zgeon,TriceraScotts,3,Wed Mar 18 14:00:57 2015 UTC,"Seems like a big jump. Yeah we'll tank, but it's for the best in the long run. And Melvin Hunt's chances to become head coach are slim? I don't know about that one given how we've been playing and how much the players like him."
denvernuggets,2zgeon,with2nns,3,Wed Mar 18 17:06:18 2015 UTC,"I can understand not wanting to hire another first-year head coach after the Brian Shaw fiasco, but Hunt has really been proving his worth in these games recently.  He's got a great attitude, and the guys are willing to play for him.  I'm not sure how much of an ""x's and o's"" guy he is, but I don't think it was a coincidence we were scoring on most plays we ran after calling a timeout in the NO game.  He needs to be given a chance at the head coaching gig, even if it's just for a year."
denvernuggets,2zgeon,Wtfitzchris,4,Wed Mar 18 16:01:10 2015 UTC,"I'm no basketball wonk, but it seems like Hunt knows what he is doing. His inbound plays have easily outmatched Shaw and Karl's by a wide margin already. It was shocking to see us execute not just one important inbound play, but multiple plays in a game. That's not Nuggets basketball!  His rotations have also been a huge improvement over Shaw's. He has put the rookies in not just when the game is over, but when smart, high level play is necessary. Now if we could just bench Hickson for the rest of the year, things would be perfect."
denvernuggets,2zgeon,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Wed Mar 18 17:55:56 2015 UTC,It sure didn't take long for the front office to destroy everything that was built.  Damn shame.
denvernuggets,2zgeon,iamalsojoesphlabre,2,Wed Mar 18 11:24:49 2015 UTC,"Nugget's wins are fools gold (I should be a journo).  Whatever disconnect there was between players, management, and coaching staff during the Shaw era still seems to be there but to what degree I'm not sure.  The other day when Faried refused to comment regarding the tanking/rest, when Chandler came out and said they were 'setup for failure' and when the coaching staff came out and said the resting wasn't their decision the alarm bells were ringing.  For mine the comments in the other thread about the tanking/resting were all very good and this article just reinforces a lot of the sentiment.  The Nugs at the moment are ship caught between tides.  At least there's not too long to go until season 14-15 is over."
denvernuggets,2zgeon,123yousee,1 point,Wed Mar 18 11:52:00 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much the worst time to start winning and going on winning streaks.  While it's awesome to watch as a fan, it hurts us in the long run.  Melvin Hunt has done an excellent job.  I'm tending to think that it's more that the players have stopped pouting now that Shaw is gone, but won't keep the same level of intensity if we retain Hunt for the long term.  I don't know what ILL WIL is complaining about.  If he was bummed about losing, he should have spoken up in November...December...January...  Now is not the time to start griping about losing games.  Especially if one wants to win in the long run.  Plus in that double overtime victory, those guys earned that break.  It was great, but we've gotta stop killing our draft potential.  Leave it to the Nuggets to kill the season and then ruin their seating. I only want them to win one more game.  The Philly game I'm going up for on Wednesday!"
denvernuggets,2zgeon,chucho320,0,Wed Mar 18 21:46:23 2015 UTC,"I could really care less if Ty or Faried come back. The one thing Shaw was good at was slobbering on or alternatively hating on Ty, as if he's the only piece that matters. Considering he was driving around all season drunk, and probably fucked up in general, Shaw's constant ""oh well, if Ty isn't hot the team doesn't work"" stunk of somebody passing the buck."
denvernuggets,2zgeon,friendo_not_friend,2,Wed Mar 18 18:41:26 2015 UTC,"Considering he was driving around all season drunk, and probably fucked up in general   I don't think it's fair of you to make that statement.  And he wasn't wrong, this team has never functioned well without Ty (outside of us having Jameer and maybe Brooks)."
denvernuggets,2zgeon,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Wed Mar 18 19:20:27 2015 UTC,"You're right, it's not fair to assume, that was jerky. But a dude with a couple charged DUIs (and who knows how many not charged or never caught/arrested), is probably not the safest driver.  It's not so much that Shaw was wrong, but him just throwing his hands up and blaming Ty was pretty tiring, especially with everything else going on. If he needed help, then be a friend or coach him up. Get some use out of the 'talk to millenials' books.  I'm a Ty fan, not seeming like it very much, but I have been since his UNC days, and would very much like him to stay if the bullshit gets cut out."
denvernuggets,2zd7y6,IdRatherBeLurking,7,Tue Mar 17 16:48:09 2015 UTC,"It's a tough situation.  I believe the FO would of liked to keep Shaw around until the end of the season.  With how the Nuggets were playing, we were for sure headed to a top 5 pick.  The fan base, us included, basically pushed the FO to fire Shaw earlier than they would of liked. This year I've only attended one game, my lowest total in the past 4 seasons.  Maybe they began to feel the financial pressure from the fans, it's hard to say and it's just speculation.     Firing Shaw early basically put the FO in a terrible position.  Sure, we are winning and the fan base is much happier with the effort.  But now we have a HC who is coaching to keep a HC job, whether here, or else where. The players clearly want to play for Hunt, and he's been doing a good job getting the best out of them.  But being out of the playoff race makes these wins hard to swallow for the FO. All their plans are now being second guessed.  The fans are going to want to keep Melvin around as the HC.  The players we have now have shown they can compete with the best, and we would likely be in the playoffs had we not started the season with Shaw.    The only good thing about sitting players is the younger guys get some meaningful minutes."
denvernuggets,2zd7y6,denverNUGGs,3,Tue Mar 17 17:41:08 2015 UTC,"Plenty of ""fans"" might support tanking, but nobody wants to be a season ticket holder for a tanking team and the Nuggets are trying to get renewals for next year right now."
denvernuggets,2zd7y6,NUGGman,1 point,Tue Mar 17 23:23:50 2015 UTC,"Then why would the FO be presumably telling Hunt to sit players, setting them up for failure as Ill Will put it?"

denvernuggets,2zd7y6,denverNUGGs,4,Wed Mar 18 15:29:06 2015 UTC,"All good and valid points. Also, I will be livid if we don't hire Hunt."
denvernuggets,2zd7y6,pairidaeza,2,Tue Mar 17 21:37:21 2015 UTC,This made me wonder just how bad the locker room had gotten with Coach Shaw.
denvernuggets,2zd7y6,growedup,4,Wed Mar 18 09:08:27 2015 UTC,"Fine by me, lets us give the younger guys some burn while helping keep the core healthy. If we're gonna tank, this is the way to do it."
denvernuggets,2zd7y6,tehKEVSTAR,4,Tue Mar 17 19:27:16 2015 UTC,"I like it. We get the young guys minutes, help our lotto chances, and give Hunt a chance to see how different lineups work throughout a full game instead of having to mix and match,"
denvernuggets,2zd7y6,with2nns,3,Tue Mar 17 20:36:16 2015 UTC,Honestly I think the fact we were so close in that game without our 3 best players is as good of an endorsement of Hunt as head coach as I can think of.
denvernuggets,2zd7y6,corybyu,1 point,Tue Mar 17 21:26:19 2015 UTC,"With the lottery system and 82 game schedule, this is what we get. Winning games actively hurts the franchise so when the team plays a double overtime game on Sunday and then faces the prospect of A) hurting your draft prospects while B) exposing your players to a higher than normal injury risk there is a lot of pressure for teams to either cut minutes or sit guys completely. Then you add in Kerr sitting guys against the Nuggets and it's almost a tacit invitation to give the guys a night off.   If I was in charge I would use the wheel proposal, get rid of the max contract, and implement a 66 game schedule. This kills tanking immediately and restructures the league in a way that makes stars less important.  Stars will still gravitate towards big markets but it will be harder to put a good cast around them and starless teams will be more viable.  Something should be done with rookie scale contracts too but I'm not sure what yet.   On edit: 82 game schedule could stay, actually.  I don't mind coaches resting players."
denvernuggets,2zd7y6,tron777,4,Tue Mar 17 18:27:56 2015 UTC,"I love the wheel proposal, but I don't know if I understand the max contract part.  Wouldn't that just cause big markets to end up with all the stars?  Or you are saying that there would still be a salary cap, just no max for one player?  Just unclear on what you mean, but I agree with what you are saying in general."
denvernuggets,2zd7y6,corybyu,2,Tue Mar 17 21:25:10 2015 UTC,"Think he means there is a salary cap, but no max. So 1 player could get 50mil a year and the rest of the players get barely anything.. It would promote better ""even"" teams rather than just having 1 superstar player. The players who only want tons of money would be subjected to crappy teams cause they only have 1 good player.  I personally love the idea of relagation.. That would stop tanking."
denvernuggets,2zd7y6,Kawnar,2,Tue Mar 17 23:56:36 2015 UTC,"Still salary cap but no maximum on player contracts. LeBron might take up 50% or more of the cap.  So, while the biggest of stars would still probably drift towards big markets, teams wouldn't be able to fit their superstar friends under the cap."
denvernuggets,2zb3ac,IdRatherBeLurking,6,Tue Mar 17 02:31:52 2015 UTC,"Jameer is a steller backup PG. One of Connelly's best moves so far! He also grabbed Aaron Brooks, who would still be on this team if it wasn't for Nate Robinson's ass."

denvernuggets,2zb3ac,Futurebrain,10,Tue Mar 17 05:42:51 2015 UTC,"Really liked what I saw from Gary Harris tonight, the dudes got potential, i'm excited to see what a shooting coach and the off-season do to his game. I loved his dunk off the inbound too.   Really didn't like what I saw from JJ. His defense is atrocious, he cant/wont box out. He kept missing layups, and it seems like every time hes fed the ball from a pick and roll, he takes it straight in and gets fouled even though he's just throwing the ball up and randomly flailing; Every. Single. Time.   I'm totally ok with losing because we aren't making the playoffs and the people who did play, played very well.   Either way, Go Nugs!"
denvernuggets,2zb3ac,teensonacid,4,Tue Mar 17 02:37:43 2015 UTC,yea i don't like Hickson taking minutes away from Jof at this point. Hickson on the floor is just horrible
denvernuggets,2zb3ac,rvhack,0,Tue Mar 17 03:42:54 2015 UTC,"Going in to the offseason, is he tradeworthy?"
denvernuggets,2zb3ac,teensonacid,0,Tue Mar 17 10:43:04 2015 UTC,Maybe for a tanking team...or a running free flow system like Karl used to run. Which hopefully next season we are neither of. I'd take a second round draft pick or trade exception but he's probably best used as salary filler for a larger trade. I don't see anyone calling us for him though.
denvernuggets,2zb3ac,indieasian,2,Tue Mar 17 11:16:31 2015 UTC,"great effort, but we fell a little short near the end. gary harris is gonna be good!"

denvernuggets,2z9zaj,tron777,8,Mon Mar 16 21:51:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I don't blame the coaches and players for being competitive, but I love the front office taking the long view. We need as high a pick as possible."

denvernuggets,2z9zaj,growedup,2,Mon Mar 16 21:36:12 2015 UTC,"You're right, the tanking is totally implied."
denvernuggets,2z9zaj,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Mon Mar 16 21:45:38 2015 UTC,I do find it pretty funny though...I reckon the FO didn't think Hunt would turn this team around as much as he has. And he's given the youngsters better minutes than Shaw did.
denvernuggets,2z9zaj,with2nns,2,Mon Mar 16 21:48:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's a ""he has sore ankle may as well sit him out"" kind of situation"

denvernuggets,2zadx4,teensonacid,3,Tue Mar 17 02:01:39 2015 UTC,Looks like Memphis is pulling away but huge props to the Nuggs being down 3 starters/vets in two back-to-back road games and still fighting like hell.

denvernuggets,2z7kas,ADinHD,12,Mon Mar 16 14:48:07 2015 UTC,Blazer fan here; so happy to see you guys appreciating the people's champ!
denvernuggets,2z7kas,westnob,5,Mon Mar 16 15:52:47 2015 UTC,Let me 2nd the notion! People's Champ is hilarious and can ball. We just didn't have the minutes for him but he handled it like a pro and kept getting better. Wish him nothing but the best with you guys.
denvernuggets,2z7kas,PDXbp,7,Mon Mar 16 20:38:57 2015 UTC,He played awesome yesterday. Definitely made a fan out of me with the way he's played since he got here and the way he always says the right things. Seems like a guy who genuinely appreciates his opportunity to play in the league
denvernuggets,2z7kas,rhinoman4,6,Mon Mar 16 15:13:29 2015 UTC,That warmed my heart. Glad he likes playing for us

denvernuggets,2z6lwx,cmantis,13,Mon Mar 16 01:07:33 2015 UTC,ripcity fan here that's happy THE THRILL has found a home and is being utilized.
denvernuggets,2z6lwx,Wtfitzchris,6,Mon Mar 16 02:09:29 2015 UTC,Hell yeah!  He reminds me so much of Corey Brewer with his attitude and playstyle.  I hope we keep him and continue to give him meaningful minutes.
denvernuggets,2z6lwx,orangesoda123,2,Mon Mar 16 01:10:30 2015 UTC,"It looks like the more he gets comfortable here, the more upside he has. Dude's handles improve every game from what I've seen. He makes mistakes but that's just from limited playing time in the past. Really feel like Barton is going to put the Brewer comparison behind him pretty quick. I may be being overly optimistic but Barton is definitely special."
denvernuggets,2z6lwx,Wtfitzchris,18,Mon Mar 16 06:08:27 2015 UTC,Seems like we scored on all of the out-of-bounds plays Hunt called during timeouts at the end of regulation.  If we don't keep him as head coach next season I'm going to be disappointed.
denvernuggets,2z6lwx,orangesoda123,3,Mon Mar 16 01:15:23 2015 UTC,That's what really stuck out the most to me in comparison to Shaw. Shaw would draw some really lazy and predictable plays that would often end up as a turnover. I love the decision of giving it to Barton who has decent size and the hot hand rather than forcing the shot on Gallo. Everyone would be expecting Gallo. Man that was a great game. I really hope to see more Hunt and Barton.

denvernuggets,2z6lwx,bobybushia,3,Mon Mar 16 08:14:44 2015 UTC,"That was the best game I've seen all year.  At this point, I guess it really doesn't matter where we land in the draft.  What's the difference between the 9th and 11th pick?  It just feels good to watch the team win and have fun playing.  Barton is quickly becoming my new favorite guy.  I'm going to the Philly game next week.  I hope they're still riding this energetic wave.  Hunt really has the team believing again.  There's finally a ray of hope in this horrible season."
denvernuggets,2z6lwx,prometheus05,6,Mon Mar 16 15:37:27 2015 UTC,That might be the most fun I've had watching the Nuggets all season.  WAR BARTON  WAR FARIED  WAR GALLO

denvernuggets,2z6akm,RiseNShine24,1 point,Mon Mar 16 05:54:34 2015 UTC,"Gallo's got it pretty good at the moment; he's got A LOT of offensive freedom to (A) shoot 3s, (B) initiate off iso's, and (C) run the break.  Outside of Lawson he's probably the next best starter in terms of creating O.  Also he either has the ball in his hands or has 2 of Foye, Nelson or Lawson on the floor with him for the majority of the game so that makes life a little easier."

denvernuggets,2z5t0z,nickolai21,1 point,Mon Mar 16 01:16:49 2015 UTC,"The problem is that we need a star, at least in the managements eyes. Otherwise we would have kept trucking along in the George Karl system. Its almost impossible for the Nuggets to grab a quality free agent being a small market team not on a coast so we have to pray for a draft pick to pan out."

He's clearly a SG, I don't know if he'll ever be our backup PG like we've been trying to get him to be. That being said, he's got some good handles and a nice shot, he just needs to get his confidence up."

denvernuggets,2z1fcf,with2nns,6,Sat Mar 14 18:00:57 2015 UTC,"Thats an insane flip for him. I'm confused at our locker room situation in regard to faried. Is he a cancer or is he cool with ty and gallo? Was shaw completely his problem or was the manimal the problem? I like faried and hope he's a long time nugget unless we can trade him for a big name free agent, but what exactly is his standing in the locker room?"
denvernuggets,2z1fcf,gpas_gspot,1 point,Sat Mar 14 18:46:12 2015 UTC,Part of this has to be the fact he is starting with Gallo or Wilson at the 4.
denvernuggets,2z1fcf,growedup,1 point,Sun Mar 15 20:22:42 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard much about him being a locker room problem, but he apparently didn't get along with Karl or Shaw. I can't speak to Karl, but Shaw didn't get along with anybody, so I give Faried a pass there. He seems to get along well with everybody on the court though."
denvernuggets,2z22nw,friendo_not_friend,5,Sat Mar 14 21:13:01 2015 UTC,Marlowe has really been on his call game this year.

denvernuggets,2z12p5,not_horatiocaine,1 point,Sat Mar 14 16:13:43 2015 UTC,I think this would all tie in to a change in the scheduling of the season and subsequently the preseason and possibly the d-league while we're reviewing how the league does its developmental aspects
denvernuggets,2z12p5,rvhack,2,Sat Mar 14 22:28:58 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of a 55 or 60 game season, no back to backs. The product would be so much better!"
denvernuggets,2z12p5,rvhack,0,Sat Mar 14 22:35:38 2015 UTC,I don't think the owners would go for that loss of revenue though.   My thought was to cut out the preseason entirely. Use the extra time to space out those back to backs.  The d league could also use some fleshing out as a legitimate place for guys to develop so I think having more teams and pushing more towards something like minor league baseball. Each team having its own d league parallel as opposed to sharing the way they do now hinders fan loyalty. Make an effort to advertise. Having the games on YouTube is a good start.  I think everyone wins at that point.
denvernuggets,2yzhpg,IdRatherBeLurking,9,Sat Mar 14 03:32:08 2015 UTC,"I got some pretty cool pics at the Courtside experience I'll post them when I can! And what a great game Faried, Gallo, Foye and Nelson were on point tonight!"

denvernuggets,2yzhpg,DtownAndOut,9,Sat Mar 14 03:52:08 2015 UTC,Seriously. Makes me sad that I has to sit through a season of shit to get to this point. We had it all along.
denvernuggets,2yzhpg,teensonacid,5,Sat Mar 14 04:18:18 2015 UTC,Anyone else catch the look Hunt was giving Kerr right before the buzzer? Looked like he wanted to kill. Really wish I could have heard what he said to Kerr.
denvernuggets,2yzhpg,DtownAndOut,2,Sat Mar 14 03:35:31 2015 UTC,What happened?
denvernuggets,2yzhpg,chokethewookie,3,Sat Mar 14 04:49:44 2015 UTC,"From what i could lip read Kerr was telling his staff ""it wasn't so bad"" and Hunt was giving him a death stare, then they walked up and shaked hands like pros. Looked like Hunt said a couple of sentences then patted kerr on the chest."

denvernuggets,2yxqnd,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Fri Mar 13 22:34:32 2015 UTC,"I've got tickets, and this is really disappointing. I have never seen curry or thompson live and I was looking forward to that. This was going to be a huge challenge for the nuggets, but I would have loved to see it. With that said, I don't fault kerr. His team has a tough stretch coming up and I think he made the right decision. It just sucks as a fan and I hope the NBA shortens the season so that coaches won't have to make these decisions."
denvernuggets,2yxqnd,IdRatherBeNurking,3,Fri Mar 13 23:14:17 2015 UTC,this is some fucking bullshit. i hope the team gets a hefty fine for this bs
denvernuggets,2yxqnd,ParadeShitter,2,Fri Mar 13 20:00:20 2015 UTC,Why?
denvernuggets,2yxqnd,IdRatherBeLurking,7,Fri Mar 13 20:04:47 2015 UTC,why? i don't know. maybe because i'm actually invested into this team. like i have paid a pretty penny to watch this team unravel in front of my eyes and the only semblance of enjoyment i've really gotten out of this waste of money is watching some other teams on their way to the playoffs. only gsw game in denver and this guy is going to rest 4 of his starting 5. seems like a no-brainer why any fan with a ticket would be upset.
denvernuggets,2yxqnd,ParadeShitter,7,Fri Mar 13 20:09:21 2015 UTC,"Why should they be fined for it, my apologies.  I'm a Nuggets fan way more than an NBA fan, so I could care less about seeing other teams' stars shitting on us every night. If I was told Jusuf wasn't going to play tonight, I'd be way more upset. I just don't get any enjoyment from watching superstars put up 40 on us. Durant is a heck of a player, but I'm going to hate his guts when he's raining 3s on us like he did last time. There's no enjoyment in that for me.  Instead of fining coaches for making smart decisions, they should shorten the season. That will never happen, of course."
denvernuggets,2yxqnd,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Fri Mar 13 20:17:54 2015 UTC,you're a great fan and you do kick ass work with this sub but just let me air my grievance with this bs trend that is happening in the league. it has been boiling for some time and i guess it's just reaching a fever pitch. i'm not a fan of these decisions at all
denvernuggets,2yxqnd,ParadeShitter,1 point,Fri Mar 13 20:42:10 2015 UTC,Hey no hard feelings! Everyone is their own type of fan- wanting to see the stars of the NBA doesn't make you any less of a Nuggets fan. I can understand the frustration that comes from financially supporting a league that seemingly acts against your interests.  I just think the blame is squarely on the NBA's shoulders. These coaches are making the best decision (they think) for their team within the current rules.
denvernuggets,2yxqnd,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Fri Mar 13 20:56:41 2015 UTC,"i moved here a year ago and bought tickets almost immediately. i'm a huge nba fan. by default i'm a ""nuggets fan"" but i wouldn't say i'm a nuggets fan because i can't tell you who's numbers are hanging in the rafters. i take my fandom seriously and there's a threshold of knowledge necessary to claim real ""fandom"". i can tell you everything about everyone this season but that's the depth of my knowledge. maybe in time i'll considering myself a true nuggets fan  point is, there are a multitude of reasons to buy season tickets to any team and they aren't all because you're a fan of that team. i might not be the worlds biggest nuggets fan but i'm still at every game and i still know more about the team than those sitting around me (lol). the financial implications hurt but i knew going into this season that the team was unlikely to make the playoffs. honestly with hunt's promotion and the mini-home resurgance the team has gone through i thought i was at least going to get my ""money's worth"" from the rest of the season with competitive games. i'm sure the nuggets will live up to their end of the bargain but i bought these tickets in large part to watch lebron/curry/rose/durant play while of course hoping for a nuggets win"
denvernuggets,2yxqnd,ParadeShitter,2,Fri Mar 13 21:01:18 2015 UTC,Man I'm sorry to hear that. I can't imagine how frustrating it would be.
denvernuggets,2yxqnd,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Fri Mar 13 21:59:27 2015 UTC,"i've cooled down. second time it's been this blunt because dallas did the same thing earlier in the season. those early games against okc were okay with durant/westbrook out because that's part of basketball.  could be worse, i'm sure there are some fans here that have more invested or even better tickets for this specific game. i know this is one i was eyeballing for an upgrade when the season started. i guess i'll just enjoy my regular seats and fingers crossed for a nuggets win just the same"
denvernuggets,2yxqnd,ParadeShitter,0,Fri Mar 13 22:12:27 2015 UTC,"you don't have season tickets. you don't have thousands of dollars invested into this season. you don't have a huge reason to be upset.   i don't give 2 fucks if curry scores 100 or 0, i want to see these players play. if you're hurt, than sit out. if one guy is a bit tired, give him limited minutes.   sitting most of your roster. that's bullshit whether you're a fan of the home team or not"
denvernuggets,2yxqnd,ParadeShitter,2,Fri Mar 13 20:24:20 2015 UTC,correction: 3 of the 5 starters are sitting. Iguodala plays off the bench.  Warriors are currently in a stretch of 7 games that will span over a 11 day period.
denvernuggets,2yxqnd,rinemy,2,Fri Mar 13 20:15:15 2015 UTC,"and?  this is sports-entertainment and goes against everything the league should represent. if there's too many games and the teams and players think there are too many games than fucking shorten the season. you're healthy, you should play. you want to rest somebody, fine. you want to rest 4 of your 5 best players in the same game. go fuck yourself  that's my feelings, there's really no counter-point that's not going to make me feel any less livid about this ""fuck the fans"" statement that has lovingly plagued the worst teams in the nba  ""oh your team sucks? well not only do you get to enjoy that, when the other teams come into town you're less likely to see their best players too"". thank you nba, i think i'll be skipping this one and sending my tickets back to the league because this shit is ridiculous"

I've got money on Pettis and Hendricks."
denvernuggets,2ywt1d,ADinHD,2,Fri Mar 13 17:31:46 2015 UTC,"Good choices, I agree that none of these fighters are in my ""favorites"" group, but I'm excited to see them in the cage. I'd really like to see Joanna Jyrshdsfsdlgk kick Esparza's ass, and I think Pettis is super entertaining to watch. I've also got some love for Big Country, but he's almost a joke at this point.   As tough as Matt Brown's chin is, I think Hendricks is going to whoop him."
denvernuggets,2ywt1d,followthelawson,2,Fri Mar 13 17:34:28 2015 UTC,Yeah I always enjoy a good lady fight haha. What's up with Country?  Hendricks has a rocket arm and I love it. He's gonna knock Brown out.
denvernuggets,2ywt1d,followthelawson,2,Fri Mar 13 17:57:37 2015 UTC,"He just doesn't bring anything to the table if he doesn't land that one big punch. And despite his attempts, he hasn't done that recently."
denvernuggets,2ywt1d,ADinHD,2,Fri Mar 13 18:07:32 2015 UTC,"He always looks a bit tired. And that's true, hopefully he can take it. If not, when's Carlos Condit fighting next? Dude's my favorite fighter, he grew up down the street."

denvernuggets,2ytse4,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:29:55 2015 UTC,Yeah this is a great piece. One thing I'd say is that I think Denver's home court advantage (in most seasons) comes as much from Hess and his staff as it does from the altitude. Our guys just seem to be in better shape than many other teams.
denvernuggets,2ytei1,Kawnar,4,Thu Mar 12 17:42:41 2015 UTC,"9 of our last 17 games are against western conference playoff teams, including 1 against the Heat, who'll be fighting for their playoff lives, and 2 against the Jazz, who are suddenly amazing. I don't know how that stacks up against the Kings, Pistons, or Hornets, but it's worth mentioning."
denvernuggets,2ytei1,with2nns,3,Fri Mar 13 00:48:13 2015 UTC,Hornets are better than us for sure. The only one I'd feel confident about is the Pistons (if it's at home). Is the Kings game here? I'd really want to go watch that with GK coming back.
denvernuggets,2ytei1,not_horatiocaine,2,Fri Mar 13 14:09:45 2015 UTC,Kings game is here. That'll be fun. Karl and Andre Miller return reunited and another bout of Juka vs Boogie.

The difference between talent in the 5th pick and the 10th pick is not all that great and it's more about the organization's coaches than the player himself......

denvernuggets,2ytei1,chokethewookie,12,Thu Mar 12 17:43:45 2015 UTC,Not going to happen.  The players want to show the world that this whole mess was Shaw's fault and Melvin wants to show that he deserves the job next year.  12th pick here we come.
denvernuggets,2ytei1,corybyu,15,Thu Mar 12 18:12:28 2015 UTC,"I'm bummed about not getting a high pick, but I would much rather have motivated players and keep Melvin, he is doing great and I like where we are headed."
denvernuggets,2ytei1,Nugforlife,3,Thu Mar 12 18:22:36 2015 UTC,Winning as many games as possible this last stretch of the season and building confidence with the current players and Hunt is much more important I would think than a couple of spots higher in the draft. Building momentum for next season is a key to a good start next year. All just my opinion of course.
denvernuggets,2ytei1,eathbau,1 point,Fri Mar 13 01:50:36 2015 UTC,"I'm going to try to be positive but the more I read about this draft, the more I think we're just going to end up drafting some bench player at best."
denvernuggets,2ytei1,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Sat Mar 14 12:56:31 2015 UTC,We're only 3 games out from the 5th pick.
denvernuggets,2yty3p,rvhack,6,Thu Mar 12 20:06:11 2015 UTC,We're probably going to pick 10th - 12th so we should just take the best player available and not worry too much about getting a starter for next season.  I doubt we'd have the ammo to trade up far enough to matter without giving up Lawson and the only way that would make any sense is if we got into the top 3 and drafted Mudiay.
denvernuggets,2yty3p,chokethewookie,3,Thu Mar 12 20:35:27 2015 UTC,You're probably right in that we'll end up in the later lottery. Maybe we can call the cavs and figure out what kind of black sacrament they performed to get that waterfall of top-5 picks.  I really like the idea of trading whatever we get for something better in the future. I really don't see a lot of room on the roster for another major player without them being a significant upgrade.
denvernuggets,2yty3p,with2nns,2,Thu Mar 12 22:28:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think we'll fall back. We have a pretty rough schedule to close the season, and we're 5 losses back from the Jazz, who have been playing great, and Boston, who are trying to make the playoffs. We might fall behind Brooklyn at 38 losses, but I think odds are we'd have a better chance of moving up, if at all."
denvernuggets,2yty3p,bettycrockerpot,5,Fri Mar 13 00:55:44 2015 UTC,we NEED Stanley johnson

denvernuggets,2yty3p,bettycrockerpot,1 point,Thu Mar 12 23:32:45 2015 UTC,"But I'll be honest, that I don't really mind getting a slightly lower pick because players like Kevon Looney or Willie Cauley Stein are good players for Denver but having lower picks to draft them is reasonable you know? there are a few good players with high ceilings in some of the later picks and I wouldn't mind getting them at the low picks because if they do pan out everyone will praise Denver"
denvernuggets,2yty3p,with2nns,2,Thu Mar 12 22:46:27 2015 UTC,That's true. Lower picks can be talents just as much as top ones can be busts.
denvernuggets,2yty3p,with2nns,1 point,Thu Mar 12 23:39:24 2015 UTC,"I'm partial to trading Ty for Mudiay or Russell. That or Henzonja, he apparently has a high ceiling."
denvernuggets,2ytblu,not_horatiocaine,4,Thu Mar 12 17:22:19 2015 UTC,"What I would like to see is the Nuggz win the 1st three quarters and then let the rookies and third stringers play, get some experience and end up losing the game.  Winning the 3rd quarter is winning as far as this season goes.  And winning the game is losing.  By doing so we're only hurting our long term.  We literally have nothing to gain by winning more games."
denvernuggets,2ytblu,chucho320,9,Thu Mar 12 22:06:49 2015 UTC,"I'm rooting for Melvin Hunt man, I don't care if we don't get a top pick.  I think our team has a lot of young talent as it is, and even a mid first round pick could help us out.  Look what we got in the middle rounds last year!  Nurkic is awesome, and Harris has started to show some potential.  If only we hadn't gotten rid of Afflalo due to Brian ""players don't like him"" Shaw."
denvernuggets,2ytblu,corybyu,2,Thu Mar 12 18:47:15 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't want the Nuggets to turn into NY or PHI..."
denvernuggets,2ytblu,dot-pixis,2,Fri Mar 13 01:35:49 2015 UTC,I think we just play the games and let the cards fall where they may
denvernuggets,2ytblu,rvhack,3,Fri Mar 13 15:42:04 2015 UTC,"Would have taken a ton of luck to get a top 5 pick. Not really concerned about the lotto, would rather see the core parts of our team enjoy playing basketball again."
denvernuggets,2ytblu,benzabs,2,Thu Mar 12 17:25:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah it would be a ton of luck, but the 5th worst record means a 29.2% chance of landing a top-3 pick in the lottery. The 8th worst record would give us only a 10% chance of a top 3 pick, meaning we'd have a 290% better chance to get a top-3 pick if we had the 5th worst record as opposed to the 8th worst."
denvernuggets,2ytblu,followthelawson,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:36:49 2015 UTC,"Who do we want in the top 3 though?  We already have a center, power forward, and point guard."
denvernuggets,2ytblu,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Mar 12 23:34:32 2015 UTC,"Rooting for losses. I don't blame the players or coaches, I blame management. They stupidly fired Brian Shaw way too early. We should have finished out the year, hopefully losing a lot in the process, and fired him in the offseason.  Kroenke and Co. continue to disappoint."
denvernuggets,2ytblu,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Mar 12 18:05:34 2015 UTC,I think the gist was that the lockeroom was so toxic that they were hurting their current prospects and players by keeping him on any longer.
denvernuggets,2ytblu,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Mar 12 18:41:53 2015 UTC,"And I can appreciate that... to an extent. I would hope that guys like Nurkic and Harris could suffer through another 6 weeks. Get a new coach over the summer, hopefully use the high draft pick wisely, totally reboot."
denvernuggets,2ytblu,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Mar 12 19:00:12 2015 UTC,"I could also see us trading Ty and/or Faried and/or Chandler for some good draft assets as well. And hell, we turned the #11 pick (Doug McDermott) into Jusuf and Gary. Not the worst situation in the world."
denvernuggets,2ytblu,strotto,2,Thu Mar 12 19:01:50 2015 UTC,"I'll be bummed if we trade Ty, I am such a huge fan of his. But it happens. Should be an interesting summer to say the least."
denvernuggets,2yrv24,AlienDeg,7,Thu Mar 12 07:45:05 2015 UTC,Gallo's back.
denvernuggets,2yrv24,pairidaeza,4,Thu Mar 12 11:36:22 2015 UTC,Back again!
denvernuggets,2yrv24,EvilBronco,4,Thu Mar 12 13:49:02 2015 UTC,It's Danilo's Way!
denvernuggets,2yr99r,IdRatherBeLurking,17,Thu Mar 12 03:25:05 2015 UTC,"I was sitting behind the bench tonight.  Kept my winning streak of games that I have gone to up to 2 and a half years, or 18 games.  Thought it was going to end tonight, but was so very wrong.  My favorite part was at the end some Hawks fan was yelling at the Nuggets bench ""LOSERS"", and Nurkic started yelling back and just pointed to the scoreboard.  The guy got kicked out."
denvernuggets,2yr99r,followthelawson,12,Thu Mar 12 04:14:45 2015 UTC,Fuckin love Nurkic man.
denvernuggets,2yr99r,EvilBronco,7,Thu Mar 12 04:50:02 2015 UTC,It was soooooo satisfying and hilarious.  Love that man.  He also seemed like he is really happy.  He was always talking to everyone with a smile on his face.

denvernuggets,2yr99r,Th3Greyhound,14,Thu Mar 12 03:44:38 2015 UTC,"Melvin, you're doing great and this is exciting as hell to watch. But can I tell you about how the draft lottery works?"
denvernuggets,2yr99r,icanhazdinna,6,Thu Mar 12 04:00:31 2015 UTC,Based Melvin
denvernuggets,2yr99r,Eggman87,6,Thu Mar 12 03:46:30 2015 UTC,Completely different team out there holy shit
denvernuggets,2yr99r,wbarker11,6,Thu Mar 12 03:43:10 2015 UTC,"Gallo is starting to get his rhythm back! With this squad, I'm hoping for better things next season under Melvin Hunt, or even someone better! GO NUGS!"
denvernuggets,2yr99r,isecretlyjudgeyou,4,Thu Mar 12 03:57:33 2015 UTC,"As a hawk fan living in Denver, nicely done D-NUGS. As much as that hurt , the Nuggets are definitely my western conference team. Was fun talking with Nugget fans. I am also 0-3 this year watching the hawks live (MIL blowout, TOR blowout, now this)."
denvernuggets,2yr99r,rvhack,2,Thu Mar 12 05:00:11 2015 UTC,"yeah, I'm an ATL living in CO as well. My record for watching our teams here is terrible. Braves lose 8-2 and 10-3 on back to back nights...then I see our Hawks get down by 30+ and lose to the Nuggets. Ouch."
denvernuggets,2yr99r,rvhack,7,Thu Mar 12 16:36:49 2015 UTC,Only a true IDIOT could defend the years wasted with Shaw after this recent showing.
denvernuggets,2yr99r,isecretlyjudgeyou,8,Thu Mar 12 06:05:57 2015 UTC,"What do you mean? Hindsight is very persuasive, but I can't completely fault the FO for taking the risk. That can be said for a number of moves, especially trading for McGee."
denvernuggets,2yr99r,tebam,2,Thu Mar 12 06:09:19 2015 UTC,and iggy
denvernuggets,2yqi51,IdRatherBeLurking,9,Wed Mar 11 23:40:17 2015 UTC,I like to imagine Shaw watching this game crying in the fetal position. Maybe sucking on his thumb or something.

denvernuggets,2yqi51,tebam,5,Thu Mar 12 01:13:20 2015 UTC,A win tonight could do wonders for the team......
denvernuggets,2yqi51,Nugforlife,3,Thu Mar 12 01:26:28 2015 UTC,Melvins confidence would be insane
denvernuggets,2yqi51,Nugforlife,3,Thu Mar 12 01:29:57 2015 UTC,"That would be nice, hawks could be overlooking the nuggets....."

denvernuggets,2yqi51,tron777,3,Thu Mar 12 03:22:12 2015 UTC,Gallo is back
denvernuggets,2yqi51,trentyz,3,Thu Mar 12 01:29:30 2015 UTC,Damn I love this Gallo
denvernuggets,2yqi51,LordOfTheFleshlights,3,Thu Mar 12 01:30:23 2015 UTC,"has anyone watched every game that faried has started at center? his stats seem to be really good at center, is he really playing that well at center or is it just the change of pace with hunt? is he a ben wallace like player or something because i found it really weird that he was undersized at power foward but is somehow playing better at center"
denvernuggets,2yqi51,tebam,6,Thu Mar 12 01:37:52 2015 UTC,"Faried plays so much better when he feels wanted. He's still undersized but it doesn't matter much on offense, because his quickness advantage is even bigger against centers, and teams haven't been taking advantage on the defensive end."
denvernuggets,2yqi51,tron777,1 point,Thu Mar 12 01:48:52 2015 UTC,"So true, I think Faried's mental state plays a huge part of his game! Confident Faried = Good Faried!"

denvernuggets,2yqi51,indieasian,3,Thu Mar 12 02:44:30 2015 UTC,The only people not enjoying this game are Hawks fans and Brian Shaw's agent.
denvernuggets,2yqi51,Nugforlife,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:52:13 2015 UTC,I might have been on pee break but pretty sure Hunt went and dropped his nuts on the Hawks dry erase playboard

denvernuggets,2yqi51,friendo_not_friend,3,Thu Mar 12 02:45:29 2015 UTC,Is that score real life
denvernuggets,2yqi51,realchinky,3,Thu Mar 12 02:45:30 2015 UTC,"i've never watched as few nuggets games as i have during the shaw era, but now with hunt taking over, my fandom feels rejuvenated!"

denvernuggets,2yqi51,tron777,2,Thu Mar 12 04:03:48 2015 UTC,I think Will Barton is a point guard. Can't remember where I saw the idea. It never crossed my mind before but I'm kind of digging him as point guard. Looks more comfortable with the ball than Green does.
denvernuggets,2yqi51,chokethewookie,2,Thu Mar 12 03:15:24 2015 UTC,Nate Timmons was saying that's how Portland saw him.

denvernuggets,2yn3c3,thedenny,3,Wed Mar 11 03:39:04 2015 UTC,"Cheapest way is probably through flash seats/ebay/stub hub the day of the game. Prices usually drop the day of (you can bid pretty low on flash seats as well).   If you guys don't mind the risk, doing something on flash seats the day of the game is probably your best chance of getting something super cheap.   I usually buy tickets directly through one of the ticket reps or through flash seats.   Me personally, I avoid the 'family night' and 'guys night' promotions because you don't get to pick your seats and are limited on food/drinks.   I think the best bang for your buck is to find seats in section 311 (or any of the other single row sections). You have a rail to put your feet on, no one behind you, no one in front of you. Last I looked you could get those tickets for $7 the day of.   Probably won't be more than 60% full based on the games I have been to this year.   Parking - I like to park in the Elitches parking lot ($15) as I can get to I-25 pretty quick. Protip - Have a single ready for after the game as there will be a sax player on the bridge.   Hope this helps!"
denvernuggets,2yn3c3,kipmix,2,Wed Mar 11 04:34:18 2015 UTC,Awesome advice! Can't thank you enough.
denvernuggets,2yn3c3,Eggman87,3,Wed Mar 11 04:39:54 2015 UTC,"I can attest to flash seats being awesome. Just got 2 court side tickets to tonights game for $40 each. As a hawk fan, I am CAWWINg so hard right now. Actually selling the seat next to me on there right now."
denvernuggets,2yn3c3,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Wed Mar 11 22:44:23 2015 UTC,"Once you take /u/kipmix up on their advice (killer stuff!), you can use the Nuggets upgrade app to potentially upgrade your seats for a cheap price.   Depending on where you're staying, you have a couple of transportation options. If you're staying downtown, I recommend either Lyft or Uber. You can get a free $30 voucher to lyft by buying reddit gold, totally worth it. If you're close to the lightrail, then that will be a great option although it does tend to get packed on the way home."

denvernuggets,2yl4e3,IMDATBOY,7,Tue Mar 10 18:42:14 2015 UTC,"Great writeup! Trades aren't really my strong suit so I can't really decide what a viable one looks like for Ty. I have to imagine that he'd garner a significantly larger return than Arron Afflalo, who was traded for Will Barton, Victor Claver, Thomas Robinson, a future lottery protected 1st and a second-round pick when he was packaged with end-of-bench player Alonzo Gee.  I guess the questions I have are:  Is Ty worth 2 first-round picks?   What other teams need Ty, and what do they have to give? Lakers were interested during the deadline fever, as were the Pacers."
denvernuggets,2yl4e3,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Mar 10 19:19:00 2015 UTC,"Totally valid.  I don't know what Ty is worth, I think that's more my question for you guys.  I think that he's worth whatever the situation dictates.  Players like Rondo, Mozgov, Green, Dragic, and some of the others that have been moved this season have cost way less than what their value is in a vacuum, because teams alter their value of players as their problems became more immediate and necessary to fix.  I don't know what the necessity is for the Nuggets to move Lawson.  It seems like most fans that have upvoted or chimed in believe that he's worth Boogie, which is crazy to me.  Boogie is not on the table for anyone this summer or the next, unless something catastrophic happens like he refuses to play another game or he shatters all his bones or something.  And we're nowhere near that.    What is your take then? The Aaron Afflalo comparison is interesting, but I have a problem with simplifying it to how many players you get vs. the type of players/pick you receive in return.  I'd think a top-10 pick, an NBA-ready/tested backup point guard with upside to start, and another top-10 drafted player in Stauskas would be enough considering Landry goes with and the Kings see something extra coming their way because the value of those players is worth more than the value of the guys you mentioned (unless of course Barton is coming along, I'm not really sure on him).    I'm honestly not great with trades either man, so don't trip.  I always screw up the numbers and stuff.  But my real question is what is the mindset then?  Trade Lawson if the deal is right, keep him if its not?  Or is it that the team should look to trade him this offseason in order to move on and start over with new, younger, cheaper on long contract talent?"
denvernuggets,2yl4e3,skipaBturner,4,Tue Mar 10 23:34:13 2015 UTC,"Ty lawson is pretty much a top 10 PG with the ability to be a top 5 PG if his team performs well.  Ty lawson has elite speed, elite driving ability, elite passing ability. He also is a good shot creator for himself, he is basically denver nuggets 'rondo' (in that he runs the team) Ty's weaknesses is his motor is inconsistent. His play is consistent, but his energy level is not. He needs to become an alpha male. He has all the physical and technical skills, he just needs to WANT IT on a more consistent level.  The reason for why it would be hard to give up ty, is because we all know he is has all star talent (Guard position is too deep out west to warrant him that praise at this point). So basically he is our star player. So when you ask us denver fans, what do you want for ty, people will say it has to include boogie, because good top 10 PG's are hard to acquire in the league. Ty has developed over the past few years into what he is today, and we've all witnessed it, I don't think i'd be interested in throwin that away for a few more PF's and nik stauskas (who could be really good), who probably will take a few years before he's anywhere near the level of TY"
denvernuggets,2yl4e3,tehKEVSTAR,5,Wed Mar 11 01:41:53 2015 UTC,"Lawson is available, but we're more than willing to keep him unless we get blown away. Our FO probably won't want to take Landry or Thompson's contracts unless we trade Faried and can't find a better stopgap, and even then you'll need a sweetener. McCallum is nice, but I think we'd rather draft a building block PG if we trade Lawson.  I think we'd consider your proposal with Stauskas if you threw in an unprotected future first rounder, and no picks from us. We'd definitely ask for McClemore first."
denvernuggets,2yl4e3,teensonacid,6,Wed Mar 11 04:29:23 2015 UTC,If you want Ty you gotta let go of Boogie. Thats how the conversation starts.
denvernuggets,2yl4e3,teensonacid,3,Tue Mar 10 21:27:19 2015 UTC,"Very interesting.  Is this because Nuggets fans are set on going forward with keeping Ty?  That sounds like an absurd asking price, even considering that I started with a low ball."
denvernuggets,2yl4e3,teensonacid,4,Tue Mar 10 23:17:05 2015 UTC,"like i said, that's how the conversation starts. Ty in Karl's system is different beast altogether IMO. Obviously we would have to include Faried and maybe even Chandler or Hickson (who i think Karl would LOVE and would probably thrive in Karl's system)."
denvernuggets,2yl4e3,teensonacid,3,Tue Mar 10 23:23:29 2015 UTC,"Well shit that's how I'd start any conversation with the Kings if I'm an opposing GM but DMC really isn't on the block at all.  I could curtail the trade to needs, but I think that's the problem I'm having.  Are the Nuggets looking for a home-run trade to bring back star talent for Ty, or are they looking for youth and picks to bring back for Ty? The latter would be far more conventional IMO."
denvernuggets,2yl4e3,teensonacid,4,Tue Mar 10 23:36:49 2015 UTC,"personally, i'm going for superstar over youth and picks for Ty. We have Nurk, Harris and Jof as our young guns, and Barton is playing really well. What we desperately need IMO is that alpha locker room presence, which i believe Boogie would be, which is why i would push for it. Not everyone feels the way i do though and i don't speak for everyone. As for what the front office is looking to do, who knows man, they keep pretty tight lipped about everything."
denvernuggets,2yljd0,pegupine,2,Tue Mar 10 20:26:06 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty cool deal, I'm going to ask some friends if they want to go. I'd love to have the ""courtside experience"", and you can always use the ticket upgrade app to move closer to the court."

denvernuggets,2yi12p,tron777,4,Tue Mar 10 02:34:06 2015 UTC,"Guys, we have the right to swap picks with the Knicks next year. I think there's a 20% chance they are mid-lottery bad next year."
denvernuggets,2yi12p,THECHUNGAWANGA,3,Tue Mar 10 03:10:51 2015 UTC,Hey guys can someone post a stream link for me? Thanks!

denvernuggets,2yi12p,teensonacid,3,Tue Mar 10 01:25:05 2015 UTC,lead to 20...that's more like it
denvernuggets,2yi12p,tron777,3,Tue Mar 10 02:32:44 2015 UTC,Wilson Chandler makes me wish I had a spin move.
denvernuggets,2yi12p,teensonacid,3,Tue Mar 10 02:37:33 2015 UTC,THAT. BALL. MOVEMENT
denvernuggets,2yi12p,corybyu,3,Tue Mar 10 02:49:12 2015 UTC,You know what the biggest sign is that this team went to the shitter? Taco Bell stopped working with us. You know you fucked up when Taco Bell is taking the under on your season.
denvernuggets,2yi12p,tron777,2,Tue Mar 10 02:55:37 2015 UTC,"No more tacos?!  My wife is going to be pissed, that was her favorite part of every game."
denvernuggets,2yi12p,tron777,1 point,Tue Mar 10 15:09:55 2015 UTC,Yup. I really miss seeing Scooty creep on whatever poor lady happened to be closest in proximity when it was time to do the taco promo.
denvernuggets,2yi12p,tron777,1 point,Tue Mar 10 15:18:51 2015 UTC,Think anyone sponsors the Knicks? Arby's maybe?
denvernuggets,2yi12p,thechosenone16,3,Tue Mar 10 03:06:57 2015 UTC,Joff blocked 4 times on 8 shots. That's really not a good sign.
denvernuggets,2yi12p,teensonacid,1 point,Tue Mar 10 03:12:50 2015 UTC,5 times on 9 shots...
denvernuggets,2yi12p,teensonacid,2,Tue Mar 10 03:14:09 2015 UTC,"Sup all,  Another Monday night game, another Monday night math class for me. Thankfully I'm taking a test, so I might get out a bit early and make it home before the first half is over.  GO NUGS"
denvernuggets,2yi12p,teensonacid,3,Mon Mar 9 23:48:12 2015 UTC,I feel your pain. Law and ethics class is starting now.
denvernuggets,2yi12p,Futurebrain,2,Tue Mar 10 00:29:38 2015 UTC,let's do this!! i always love it when we beat the Knicks...DIG IN!!!
denvernuggets,2yi12p,Nugforlife,2,Tue Mar 10 00:46:21 2015 UTC,man our defense is horrid
denvernuggets,2yi12p,THECHUNGAWANGA,2,Tue Mar 10 01:29:21 2015 UTC,oh Barton...nice drive!
denvernuggets,2yi12p,Nugforlife,2,Tue Mar 10 01:31:56 2015 UTC,"Is Galinari out today? Its strange not seeing him in the first quarter at all.   Nevermind, I'm an idiot."
denvernuggets,2yi12p,teensonacid,2,Tue Mar 10 01:42:32 2015 UTC,"Just getting to tune in, someone give me a quick overview of first half. How's our energy?"
denvernuggets,2yi12p,tron777,2,Tue Mar 10 02:08:34 2015 UTC,Nuggs look ok I think we are doing whats expected against a team as poor as the Knicks. Bartons looking good so is Faried
denvernuggets,2yi12p,teensonacid,1 point,Tue Mar 10 02:10:13 2015 UTC,Thanks. I see Barton has 11 points......
denvernuggets,2yi12p,tron777,2,Tue Mar 10 02:13:10 2015 UTC,i missed most of the 2nd...first was ok..defense a bit sloppy...we should be up by 30 on this Knicks team..they've been scoring way too easily.
denvernuggets,2yi12p,tron777,2,Tue Mar 10 02:11:14 2015 UTC,"Oh man, just saw a black bald head looking in on that huddle and thought it was Shaw for a second."
denvernuggets,2yi12p,teensonacid,2,Tue Mar 10 02:12:18 2015 UTC,i like this Joffrey kid...he moves pretty fast and has good hands
denvernuggets,2yi12p,Nugforlife,2,Tue Mar 10 02:12:45 2015 UTC,Anybody else remember Demarre Carroll playing for the Nuggets for a few games. Can't remember who he was cut in favor of.
denvernuggets,2yi12p,teensonacid,2,Tue Mar 10 02:14:34 2015 UTC,Shved looks like an accountant... plays like one too.
denvernuggets,2yi12p,teensonacid,2,Tue Mar 10 02:38:01 2015 UTC,come on coach...it's Gary and Jof time
denvernuggets,2yi12p,teensonacid,1 point,Tue Mar 10 02:45:53 2015 UTC,Finally Hunt lets the young guys in......
denvernuggets,2yi12p,Nugforlife,2,Tue Mar 10 02:59:20 2015 UTC,fuck you Hickson
denvernuggets,2yi12p,teensonacid,2,Tue Mar 10 02:49:53 2015 UTC,Coach...bring out the young guns..come on
denvernuggets,2yi12p,teensonacid,2,Tue Mar 10 02:50:28 2015 UTC,I feel pretty certain that this game would be tied up if it happened two weeks ago.
denvernuggets,2yi12p,Nugforlife,2,Tue Mar 10 02:52:03 2015 UTC,or we'd be behind
denvernuggets,2yi12p,teensonacid,2,Tue Mar 10 02:53:56 2015 UTC,I haven't seen a nuggets lead like this in I don't know when....
denvernuggets,2yi12p,tron777,2,Tue Mar 10 02:52:35 2015 UTC,I sure as hell can't remember the last time.
denvernuggets,2yi12p,teensonacid,2,Tue Mar 10 02:53:15 2015 UTC,Barton! pretty little shot there
denvernuggets,2yi12p,teensonacid,2,Tue Mar 10 02:53:31 2015 UTC,wow..the Knicks are really..really..REALLY fucking bad
denvernuggets,2yi12p,teensonacid,1 point,Tue Mar 10 02:54:35 2015 UTC,34 point lead! Unreal!
denvernuggets,2yi12p,teensonacid,2,Tue Mar 10 03:10:29 2015 UTC,Jofs quick....once he learns the nba game he's gonna be pretty good
denvernuggets,2yi12p,teensonacid,3,Tue Mar 10 03:00:36 2015 UTC,Has been getting blocked a lot tonight. Not a great sign.
denvernuggets,2yhvqb,teensonacid,4,Mon Mar 9 23:05:45 2015 UTC,If this involves Ty and a first rounder I don't want to do it.
denvernuggets,2yhvqb,FugaYouDorphin,5,Tue Mar 10 00:18:56 2015 UTC,i really really really really really really really really really dont want this to happen
denvernuggets,2yhvqb,teepeeformypeepee,2,Mon Mar 9 23:11:59 2015 UTC,why's that?
denvernuggets,2yhvqb,TaylorHammond9,6,Mon Mar 9 23:20:29 2015 UTC,"There really isn't any reason to push for it. We'll end up losing multiple players (shit if we really do go through with it, first round picks, probably lawson?). I'd rather keep our players that we know fit in here rather than push for someone with loads of attitude problems who probably doesn't even want to come here.  Possible minutes from Nurkic gone? Shit Nurkic might be part of the deal? Fuck that."
denvernuggets,2yhvqb,AlienDeg,1 point,Mon Mar 9 23:22:12 2015 UTC,"But Cousins is top3 center in this league, we don't know where is Nurkics ceiling. We all belive in draft year after most of as are really disappointed 2014 class."
denvernuggets,2yhvqb,TaylorHammond9,1 point,Tue Mar 10 08:01:37 2015 UTC,"But Cousins is top3 center in this league, we don't know where is Nurkics ceiling.   This can be used as the exact same argument you are making with Chandler as with Boogie. He's got an extra year more than Wilson but why would he stuck around and not just leave to go make more money/play for a better team? If he's a top 3 center in the league, he's already got shitty attitude problems, why would he want to come to this team to play with... Nelson and... Nurkic? Don't see him wanting to play like a top 3 here that is for damn sure.  There's a better chance of Wilson hanging around an extra few years that Boogie. I think we all know that?"
denvernuggets,2yhvqb,AlienDeg,1 point,Tue Mar 10 08:17:12 2015 UTC,"But who is Chandler in this league? I love this guy but let's realistic. We are stuck, we play in western conference and we have to have stars to be succesful. Make a list of top100 players NBA and check where Chandler is in that list. Upss he wouldn't be there. He is a role player, we were trying to trade him for 2 first round pick. Remember that nowadays picks are really overrated. And it is not a one year more, it's try to build team around Cousins, something that Kings can't do because of Vivek.   I think Hunt (I belive he will get a shot as coach) wouldn't have problems with Cousins, he know how to talk with players, and how to talk about players. It is all about that. We have a lot of assets and we have to do something with this them because assets don't win championship."
denvernuggets,2yhvqb,TaylorHammond9,1 point,Tue Mar 10 09:12:39 2015 UTC,"The main thing isn't Chandler. If we were straight up trading Wilson for Boogie I'd take in a heart beat. The main thing is we are losing Ty with this.  Seriously, I agree Chandler really isn't that important to the team (especially with Gallo now, we could live with out him). I shudder to think about this team without Ty and with Nelson running the point every game. Ty is our team. Cousins is a HUGE gamble for players that already fit in our team."
denvernuggets,2yhvqb,AlienDeg,1 point,Tue Mar 10 09:32:31 2015 UTC,"No, Ty isn't our team. Nobody is bigger than a team. Ask Lakers about their problems. And Ty is not even close to Kobe. We can love this small guy, we can love Faried but this is sport, it is about winning and sometimes you have to take a risk. I'm not sure that this trade is the best possible solution. But with this roster in next 2 years, all we can do is MAYBE play in play-off and avoid sweep."
denvernuggets,2yhvqb,TaylorHammond9,1 point,Tue Mar 10 12:21:43 2015 UTC,"say the deal was based around Ty and Kenneth with Chandler or Hickson (who i think Karl would absolutely LOVE) also in the conversation. With Jameer running point, Gary as our #2 PG and the chance to play Nurk and Boogie side by side...does that interest anyone?"
denvernuggets,2yhvqb,AlienDeg,5,Mon Mar 9 23:27:49 2015 UTC,"Nope. I'll keep Ty, Kenneth and Chandler. I'm sure it will hit someone else's sweet spot, just not for me. Don't see any reason to give up Ty right now, he is incredibly more valuable to us than Boogie would ever be unless he got his shit magically together on the plane."
denvernuggets,2yhvqb,teepeeformypeepee,2,Mon Mar 9 23:29:57 2015 UTC,fair enough
denvernuggets,2yhvqb,AlienDeg,1 point,Mon Mar 9 23:31:24 2015 UTC,Do you belive Chandler wants to resign with this team when he can be sixth man in contender or even play in s5?
denvernuggets,2yhvqb,ParadeShitter,5,Tue Mar 10 08:02:13 2015 UTC,I think his demeanor and attitude on court is complete dog shit and he is a horribly selfish player. Just my take though. I wouldnt want to give up too much for him
denvernuggets,2ycd07,growedup,13,Sun Mar 8 15:37:40 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty clear this team needs a player's coach. Melvin has the guys' respect and he's certainly more talented from an X's and O's perspective than the likes of Mark Jackson. There might be other guys out there who are also deserving, but I'd be happy with hiring Melvin, especially since he's gotten a chance to see from the inside exactly what works and what doesn't work with this group."
denvernuggets,2ycd07,GorillaBuddy,4,Sun Mar 8 17:16:39 2015 UTC,"I would like to have him as the head coach next year. He's hungry and has good energy, and I'd rather have that than some jaded veteran coach who could give a shit less and thinks it's beneath him to coach a team up."
denvernuggets,2ycd07,friendo_not_friend,10,Tue Mar 10 05:46:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes he is. Players like him, his peers respect him, did anyone catch the end of the SA game? Asking Pop if they minded if they could get a few clutch time plays down, awesome. I read that we may be looking for someone with HC experience but I really think Coach Hunt should be our guy."
denvernuggets,2ycd07,ADinHD,3,Sun Mar 8 17:50:10 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate on what happened at the end of the Spurs game? Must've missed it.
denvernuggets,2ycd07,adamc25,13,Mon Mar 9 05:29:58 2015 UTC,"Sure. So the game is basically out of reach with under a minute left, Denver still playing hard and SA just moving the ball and making the defense move, and you see Coach Hunt kinda chatting with the Spurs bench. He was seeing if was cool if Denver ran end of game inbounds plays instead of dribbling it out and throwing up shots. Called a timeout and drew up a play. Just a little practice under the lights. It was refreshing to see everyone engaged and willing to improve even though the game was out of reach. I mean, after the season we've had."
denvernuggets,2ycd07,ADinHD,6,Mon Mar 9 05:57:18 2015 UTC,"Damn I liked Hunt but that makes him that much better too me, it's always good to have  a positive coach and its that much more important when you have a young team with players like Nurkic, Harris and Jof who have a ton of potential but need good coaching as well."
denvernuggets,2ycd07,adamc25,5,Mon Mar 9 10:21:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah it speaks volumes about his character and how he actually wants to improve as a coach, and see his guys improve as well. Four timeouts in the last two minutes just to practice end game situations against one of the best teams in the league. I think it was Gallo, Faried, Jameer came in for Ty at one point, Barton, DA came on for JJ. Everyone paying attention, like I said as I fan I loved to see that. We gotta keep Coach Hunt y'all."
denvernuggets,2ycd07,ADinHD,2,Mon Mar 9 15:14:36 2015 UTC,This is an example of Hunt being a good coach. He is what our players need.
denvernuggets,2ycd07,NUGGman,2,Tue Mar 10 16:23:24 2015 UTC,I would definitely like it. Buth I don't know if the FO wants to try a another first year head coach..
denvernuggets,2ycd07,SirJoris,3,Sun Mar 8 18:34:49 2015 UTC,"I think we should hire the guy behind me at the game tonight yelling repeatedly for Hunt to put the starters in when we were up 34 in the 4th quarter, so we could win by 40+. That's a guy looking at the big picture."
denvernuggets,2ycd07,friendo_not_friend,2,Tue Mar 10 05:50:43 2015 UTC,"My only problem with Hunt right now is that he overplays Hickson and seems reliant on the JJ-Faried frontcourt, whether that's because he has no choice who knows.  Honestly, every time I watch Sacramento, I think Mike Malone did an incredible job with them. They are still average with Karl."
denvernuggets,2ycd07,eathbau,3,Sun Mar 8 23:22:26 2015 UTC,He's been giving Lauvergne good minutes which I think is great. Honestly right now he's making the best of what he's got and he's doing a damn good job.
denvernuggets,2ycd07,DaElephantMan,2,Mon Mar 9 01:29:34 2015 UTC,"i don't think he has much choice. DA has been hurt, so Hickson has got 18, 14, 23 and 13 mins in our last 4 games. While I'd rather those number be under 5 minutes per game, without Nurk or DA he kinda has to play JJ. I'd rather he go with Jof though, kid needs all the minutes he can get to have him ready for next year."
denvernuggets,2ycd07,teensonacid,2,Mon Mar 9 04:58:43 2015 UTC,Yes
denvernuggets,2ycd07,NUGGman,2,Tue Mar 10 16:20:58 2015 UTC,I was hoping he would get the job last time around but now I'm not so sure. What makes me leery is that he has been around for the whole debacle over the last couple years.  He wasn't in charge but the stink is on everyone in the building at this point. If it comes down to him and an equally interesting coaching prospect I think I'd want the fresh start.
denvernuggets,2ycd07,tron777,5,Sun Mar 8 19:27:44 2015 UTC,i like that he's come through the whole thing and still has an amazingly positive attitude. that's a quality i'm more than happy to support.
denvernuggets,2yb4m7,IdRatherBeLurking,9,Sun Mar 8 04:24:47 2015 UTC,"Random comment, but today I started sports betting for the first time in my life.  Off to a good start I think: http://i.imgur.com/v8u4PCi.png?1"

denvernuggets,2yaju9,SapoC,3,Sun Mar 8 02:00:32 2015 UTC,Were such a good team when we push tempo. Hunt gets that.
denvernuggets,2yaju9,Atiredsprucetree,2,Sun Mar 8 02:20:59 2015 UTC,"I understand rehauling the system when you rehaul the team, but we never did that. Everyone looks so much more comfortable this way."

denvernuggets,2yaju9,growedup,3,Sun Mar 8 02:27:43 2015 UTC,That one looked a lil flat Gallo

denvernuggets,2yaju9,teensonacid,2,Sun Mar 8 02:01:32 2015 UTC,"I get that Faried has missed TWO inside 2 feet shots already, but c'mon JJ, don't run over your own people."
denvernuggets,2yaju9,teensonacid,0,Sun Mar 8 02:18:58 2015 UTC,And he didn't even go help him up...
denvernuggets,2yaju9,teensonacid,2,Sun Mar 8 02:19:48 2015 UTC,Faried!! Nice block!!
denvernuggets,2yaju9,teensonacid,2,Sun Mar 8 02:22:41 2015 UTC,Sup FAM! How's the defense been so far
denvernuggets,2yaju9,teensonacid,2,Sun Mar 8 03:01:14 2015 UTC,Ayyy. It was really good in the 1st quarter and has dropped off in the second. Foye is probably the best guy we have to cover Harden
denvernuggets,2yaju9,teensonacid,2,Sun Mar 8 03:02:28 2015 UTC,Hardens speed would be too much for Foye wouldn't it
denvernuggets,2yaju9,Atiredsprucetree,1 point,Sun Mar 8 03:03:12 2015 UTC,"Definitely, but he's got at keeping a body in front of him."

denvernuggets,2yaju9,Nugforlife,2,Sun Mar 8 03:25:14 2015 UTC,Got the lead! Now we just need to play like this for another 20 minutes...
denvernuggets,2y72qx,icarus_adam,11,Sat Mar 7 01:04:05 2015 UTC,"There is so much that I agree with in this article.  Not just the stuff about the Phil Jackson coaching tree but more about the direction that the league is evolving toward.  I really think that the style of play in the NBA is evolving in a direction that actually SHOULD favor the Nuggets.  While superstar talent will ALWAYS be important, I think that teams can have success with the Hawks, Spurs, Warriors model. High IQ players, great shooters, running smart, balanced basketball.       Lots of stuff to discuss in this article."
denvernuggets,2y7kq8,IdRatherBeLurking,9,Sat Mar 7 04:05:42 2015 UTC,I was scared we might accidentally win another one. This proves my initial thoughts this season.. We have enough talent to compete.
denvernuggets,2y7kq8,thechosenone16,6,Sat Mar 7 09:50:38 2015 UTC,"worth rewatching? caught the post game by Coach...wow...what a completely different approach...i love his focus on positive reinforcement, he was given questions that were clearly directed at a positive or negative response, he took the high road, i really appreciate that. Coach took responsibility and enforced positive comments on the team...for any other team i can't really speculate on what kind of coach Melvin Hunt would be.....but for now, for our Nuggets, I really, really like him here."
denvernuggets,2y7kq8,teensonacid,3,Sat Mar 7 14:19:48 2015 UTC,"Most definitely. The ball was moving on offense, shots were falling, plenty of transition buckets, and the defense was fun to watch. Danny Green said postgame the Nuggets were like a completely different team under Hunt."

denvernuggets,2y8h4f,laperki,7,Sat Mar 7 12:26:37 2015 UTC,"The only ""saving"" A. I. did for the Nuggets was getting traded for Billups. I'd argue that his presence actually delayed Melo's and JR's development and maturity severely."
denvernuggets,2y8h4f,thewolfman,4,Sat Mar 7 14:25:45 2015 UTC,A.I. was undoubtedly talented but man he was an arrogant idiot. Wish we had Billups from the start. The league needs more Chauncey's.
denvernuggets,2y8h4f,orangesoda123,3,Sat Mar 7 17:02:31 2015 UTC,The Nuggets need more Chauncey :(
denvernuggets,2y8h4f,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Sat Mar 7 22:33:56 2015 UTC,Saved? Saved us from what exactly

denvernuggets,2y72l7,teensonacid,2,Sat Mar 7 01:54:56 2015 UTC,"Glad it's not jsut me. They look OK up close, but otherwise they're disgusting."
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,2,Sat Mar 7 01:56:00 2015 UTC,Almost worst jerseys ever
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,4,Sat Mar 7 02:37:34 2015 UTC,Welp. The Fuck Brian Shaw winning streak comes to an end.
denvernuggets,2y72l7,chazoid,3,Sat Mar 7 03:54:49 2015 UTC,Camo jerseys are ugly as shit.
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,3,Sat Mar 7 02:06:05 2015 UTC,Gary fightin' hard for more minutes. Gotta love what we're seeing
denvernuggets,2y72l7,growedup,3,Sat Mar 7 02:12:35 2015 UTC,Favorite non-Nuggets   Giannis Kawhi
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,2,Sat Mar 7 02:28:18 2015 UTC,RUSS  Edit: then Giannis
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,2,Sat Mar 7 02:57:43 2015 UTC,I like Russ on odd-numbered days.
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,2,Sat Mar 7 02:59:40 2015 UTC,I'm in the small group that still cant get over him denying me free chips and queso by blocking Rocky's half court shot.
denvernuggets,2y72l7,teensonacid,1 point,Sat Mar 7 08:08:34 2015 UTC,Glad I'm not the only Nuggets fan that was super impressed with Giannis...He's fun as hell to watch.   What do you think about the BK trade up in Milwaukee?
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,2,Sat Mar 7 02:29:31 2015 UTC,"Hurts them this year but nobody cares about this year. Knight is hard to figure out. He dominates the ball and shoots a ton, which was fine this year but will cause problems later when Giannis and Jabari will need more of the offense to go through them. I don't have a ton of faith in Carter-Williams but the upside is there if they can fix his shot and he's on rookie scale contract for two more years which keeps their options open."
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,1 point,Sat Mar 7 02:39:41 2015 UTC,Fair enough. They were much more fun to watch earlier this week than I remember them being for a while now.
denvernuggets,2y72l7,teensonacid,2,Sat Mar 7 02:49:25 2015 UTC,I was down on the Kidd hiring but I was dead wrong. He's been great.
denvernuggets,2y72l7,growedup,2,Sat Mar 7 03:02:25 2015 UTC,Shocking to be honest. I thought he was a hack.
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,3,Sat Mar 7 03:03:35 2015 UTC,Sup guys..im in dad duty ..catching parts of the game...GO NUGS!!!
denvernuggets,2y72l7,growedup,2,Sat Mar 7 02:29:18 2015 UTC,Haha figured as much. Raise them Nugglets right!
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,3,Sat Mar 7 02:30:31 2015 UTC,Does anyone know what that body tape actually does? I can't imagine how it could be seriously effective...
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,2,Sat Mar 7 02:33:29 2015 UTC,There's a guy in the van waiting for a nipple slip or wayward dong shot and will cut the feed if they see one.
denvernuggets,2y72l7,Nugforlife,2,Sat Mar 7 02:41:59 2015 UTC,Ahaha. What a crazy world we live in post-Janet Jackson nipslip.
denvernuggets,2y72l7,Nugforlife,2,Sat Mar 7 02:50:05 2015 UTC,I was watching that game and somehow missed it.
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,3,Sat Mar 7 02:58:58 2015 UTC,We still got a long way to go but this is promising. This is how I expected them to play every night.
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,3,Sat Mar 7 03:01:34 2015 UTC,I love this lineup with Gallo and Wilson at the 3/4.
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,2,Sat Mar 7 03:02:10 2015 UTC,It'd be better with a proper center but I like it too.
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,1 point,Sat Mar 7 03:03:19 2015 UTC,Oh no doubt. No rim protection with Faried or JJ at the 5.
denvernuggets,2y72l7,teensonacid,3,Sat Mar 7 03:06:01 2015 UTC,You wouldn't have trouble convincing me that Hickson is out there point shaving.
denvernuggets,2y72l7,growedup,3,Sat Mar 7 03:26:12 2015 UTC,Lol Faried with the left handed shot!
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,3,Sat Mar 7 03:28:56 2015 UTC,Think there are Spur's fans that go hunting with those jerseys on?
denvernuggets,2y72l7,growedup,3,Sat Mar 7 03:38:48 2015 UTC,They would have to be able to fit in them first.
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,3,Sat Mar 7 03:39:52 2015 UTC,"Win or lose, I like the effort tonight from our Nugs!!"
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,1 point,Sat Mar 7 03:48:11 2015 UTC,I wish we had this to watch all season :(
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,2,Sat Mar 7 03:51:55 2015 UTC,Yea would have been nice......
denvernuggets,2y72l7,growedup,2,Sat Mar 7 03:54:03 2015 UTC,"Losing, but it's pretty entertaining so far. Also, Pop's tech is really paying off now."
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,2,Sat Mar 7 02:03:42 2015 UTC,"It's weird to see us hanging in there considering these two teams are basically in different leagues all around. Players, coach, and club."
denvernuggets,2y72l7,growedup,2,Sat Mar 7 02:05:20 2015 UTC,How many Nuggets would be great in this Spurs system. Ty would slot directly into Parker's role. Gallo would be a killer on this team. Chandler is a better Danny Green. I think Pop would love Nurkic in Splitter's role... might not play him much until he saddle broke him.
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,2,Sat Mar 7 02:13:14 2015 UTC,Can we just switch coaches and FOs?
denvernuggets,2y72l7,growedup,2,Sat Mar 7 02:15:06 2015 UTC,"Whatchya guys drinking tonight? I've been on a Firestone Walker kick lately, having their Pale Ale 31."
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,2,Sat Mar 7 02:13:29 2015 UTC,"Sangiovese... out of beer tonight. I should get some Firestone, it's been awhile."
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,1 point,Sat Mar 7 02:17:15 2015 UTC,"I had a bomber of their double Union Jack recently, phenomenal stuff."
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,2,Sat Mar 7 02:19:28 2015 UTC,MOST THIN-SKINNED OFFICIALS IN ALL OF SPORTS.    Why is it that NFL refs don't have to call technicals in order to do their job?
denvernuggets,2y72l7,growedup,2,Sat Mar 7 02:26:57 2015 UTC,"Bunch of bitchasses, the NBA refs are."
denvernuggets,2y72l7,tron777,2,Sat Mar 7 02:27:29 2015 UTC,Chandler and Hickson to be packaged in the off season. I feel like Chandler shoots too early in the clock.
denvernuggets,2y72l7,EvilBronco,1 point,Sat Mar 7 03:02:55 2015 UTC,"I disagree. He might settle for the three too often, but someone has to take the shots!  Edit: To be fair, now that Gallo is back and they are playing together that dynamic has changed."
denvernuggets,2y72l7,growedup,2,Sat Mar 7 03:07:32 2015 UTC,Barton is my hero.
denvernuggets,2y72l7,mezihoth,2,Sat Mar 7 03:06:20 2015 UTC,I think he blocked that after he landed.
denvernuggets,2y532r,IdRatherBeLurking,5,Fri Mar 6 15:13:06 2015 UTC,Poll Question Recommendation: How many cars will you flip over and light on fire if we hire Mark Jackson as head coach?
denvernuggets,2y532r,tron777,8,Fri Mar 6 15:45:52 2015 UTC,All the cars. Every last one.
denvernuggets,2y532r,ADinHD,2,Fri Mar 6 15:55:50 2015 UTC,That guy is a straight up DINGUS!!

denvernuggets,2y532r,thechosenone16,2,Fri Mar 6 19:01:34 2015 UTC,"So what's everyone doing this weekend? Aside from my weekend staples of getting drunk and being hungover, I've got a lot of studying to do for my math test coming up. It shouldn't be too hard (matrices are easily done on the calculator), but you never know.  I think I'm going to make a few more Nuggets pokemon cards for Nurkic, Lauvergne, and Barton. What type of moves should I use? Here's the ones I made before the season started. Be aware, I was stupid high when I created them. So sorry for that."
denvernuggets,2y532r,thechosenone16,2,Fri Mar 6 15:17:54 2015 UTC,Same as you getting drunk and seeing where the alcohol takes me.
denvernuggets,2y532r,growedup,0,Fri Mar 6 19:44:12 2015 UTC,Sounds like a regular Friday night!
denvernuggets,2y532r,growedup,2,Fri Mar 6 21:07:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I've been way caught up in the NFL offseason. So I'll be here, refreshing reddit, hoping to see news that Randall Cobb has re-signed with the Packers."
denvernuggets,2y532r,tron777,1 point,Fri Mar 6 20:17:38 2015 UTC,"Haha I'm kind of in the opposite boat- I'm still full on NFL. Probably will be that way until the draft, which is when the fever usually gets me."
denvernuggets,2y532r,growedup,2,Fri Mar 6 20:19:17 2015 UTC,Understandable. I'm also in the process of creating a dynasty fantasy football league which needs to be ready by the time the NFL drafts comes along. So that's pushed me back into it.
denvernuggets,2y532r,SirJoris,1 point,Fri Mar 6 20:25:43 2015 UTC,"For what it;s worth, Randall Cobb has been money for me in fantasy. I hope he doesn't leave Green Bay either."
denvernuggets,2y532r,growedup,2,Fri Mar 6 20:29:03 2015 UTC,Haha well thanks. I'll keep my fingers crossed.
denvernuggets,2y2ym9,JJX119,4,Fri Mar 6 00:03:24 2015 UTC,I just want him 100% for next season.
denvernuggets,2y2ym9,pairidaeza,3,Fri Mar 6 00:29:08 2015 UTC,"The last thing I've seen was Steve Hess posted a picture of him working out 3 days ago, other than that I have no idea"
denvernuggets,2y2ym9,denverNUGGs,1 point,Fri Mar 6 02:09:14 2015 UTC,"He was only doing upperbody work, but it's good that he can move around on it and everything.  Not like I was 'mirin or anything."
denvernuggets,2y2ym9,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Fri Mar 6 03:44:32 2015 UTC,"Shaw made a funny face describing his first time seeing it. Based on that, it's obviously a pretty bad sprain. The average healing time for something like this is around 6 weeks, so if I had to guess, maybe 4-5 weeks until we see him on the court again?   Unfortunately I haven't seen anyone mention a timetable yet, both from the team nor the beat writers."
denvernuggets,2y2gqu,silverandblack,3,Thu Mar 5 21:46:43 2015 UTC,Wow I never knew that. I did actually see the Bulls Kings one and I always that that was the biggest comeback. I can only imagine the slow painful demise of actually watching the lead slowly whittle down to the point where you don't understand why this is happening.
denvernuggets,2y2gqu,zenbu,4,Fri Mar 6 02:31:48 2015 UTC,"It was a Saturday night. My soon to be fiancee and I had gone to one of those late in life weddings, real cheap, no crowd, etc. And they were recovering alcoholics, no booze. On the way home I hear the first quarter score and I am pretty happy. We get home and we start watching the game. She falls asleep so I am hanging out, drinking beer. And it was like a slow car wreck, we could not get out of our own way. By the middle of the fourth I am about pissed. I hated the Jazz anyway, they were kind of our rivals, and the Jazz were decent, they made the Finals the next two years or maybe one year more, but they were good. And for us to be killing them and then lose was awful. And this was almost twenty years ago, the record might stand for a long time. Ugh."
denvernuggets,2y2gqu,f0xpuppy,3,Fri Mar 6 02:43:57 2015 UTC,"IIRC, this was the after the season after Denver made their own NBA history by being the first 8th seed to defeat a no 1 seed, correct?  That Denver consistency."
denvernuggets,2y1l07,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Thu Mar 5 17:55:40 2015 UTC,"His stats look pretty darn good.  He netted 8 assists in one game, 27 points with 15 rebounds in another, and is shooting 48% from the field and 35% from 3. Not bad from the 20 y.o.  6'11, 253lber out of Serbia. Can't wait to see him on the squad next season!"
denvernuggets,2y1l07,DoubleJay20,2,Thu Mar 5 18:01:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I wonder how they're going to work him in the rotation, as a center?"
denvernuggets,2y1l07,Drizzt396,7,Thu Mar 5 18:43:24 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I don't think Wilson is going to be around next season, so my guess would be that he'll play the 3-4 spot since he's a much better shooter than Lauvergne.   Could you imagine if him and JoLo were in our starting lineup?!? Euro-white boy Insanity. We already know Gallo can play the 2, which is also crazy, but I'd get a kick out of seeing this lineup on the court...  PG Lawson  SG Gallinari  SF Jokic  PF Lauvergne  C Nurkic  We could call it the ""skyscraper rotation"""
denvernuggets,2y1l07,SirJoris,4,Thu Mar 5 18:50:16 2015 UTC,Lol yeah although I don't think I see as much potential in lauvergne as everyone else.  He may be better suited as a backup for our bigs.
denvernuggets,2y1l07,TaylorHammond9,2,Thu Mar 5 18:56:40 2015 UTC,Totally agree. I just think that lineup would be hilarious.
denvernuggets,2y1l07,benzabs,3,Thu Mar 5 18:58:01 2015 UTC,Trade for Rubio and we could go Europe vs nba
denvernuggets,2xzsgf,jd61,35,Thu Mar 5 05:29:58 2015 UTC,Uhhh we just rolled you up at home KG...
denvernuggets,2xzsgf,zenbu,28,Thu Mar 5 05:30:37 2015 UTC,"They may have quit on him, but he essentially quit on them. He chose to run a system that did not fit the players. They played his system for a whole year, and didn't do that great. They tried for a little longer, and it still wasn't working this season. He wanted to do it his way. When it still wasn't working, he publicly called out his players. He was just waiting until he could get rid of them and bring in guys that would play the way he wanted them to. That doesn't mean there isn't fault on the players, but Brian Shaw does not go blameless. Frankly, the whole front office shouldn't be blameless either. They didn't make enough moves to get him his players."
denvernuggets,2xzsgf,teensonacid,14,Thu Mar 5 06:49:57 2015 UTC,and that's all she wrote. perfectly sums up the shitstorm of our last year and a bit
denvernuggets,2xzsgf,rvhack,6,Thu Mar 5 06:55:23 2015 UTC,Agreed. Can't do things in half-measures.
denvernuggets,2xzsgf,NUGGman,5,Thu Mar 5 09:14:29 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I'm glad the front office didn't get him his players"
denvernuggets,2xzsgf,zenbu,6,Thu Mar 5 16:46:53 2015 UTC,"Me too. If we had traded Faried, I would have been so mad. I don't care about his limitations, he is just a great player to have and watch. He wanted Brook Lopez and luckily that didn't pan out. Hopefully the organization as a whole can just move on from this disastrous season. We were an embarrassment to ourselves and to the NBA as a whole."
denvernuggets,2xzsgf,zoeyversustheraccoon,2,Thu Mar 5 16:58:04 2015 UTC,Yeah building a roster around what Shaw wanted would have been a disaster.
denvernuggets,2xzsgf,looktheresafox,8,Thu Mar 5 19:29:21 2015 UTC,More like they're undefeated under Hunt and you should have studied that film KG
denvernuggets,2xzsgf,ParadeShitter,7,Thu Mar 5 16:33:51 2015 UTC,fake tough guy... fakest toughest guy... i hope the dudes are listening to these opinions and using it
denvernuggets,2xzsgf,IdRatherBeLurking,15,Thu Mar 5 17:37:11 2015 UTC,"Can't stand how all of the users in /r/NBA are jumping on this ""Fuck the Nuggets players"" bandwagon. They all pretend like they know what's going on, when not a single fucking one of them has watched more than two games. They have no clue."
denvernuggets,2xzsgf,ADinHD,10,Thu Mar 5 15:35:13 2015 UTC,Crazy how things turn. They were the Social Media MVP and the internet's darling.
denvernuggets,2xzsgf,Fooshbeard,2,Thu Mar 5 16:13:31 2015 UTC,they still is ... to me
denvernuggets,2xzsgf,rhinoman4,3,Fri Mar 6 06:37:10 2015 UTC,"If there is one thing this team needs its something to rally around. Maybe KG, Paul George and David West have provided that something for them."
denvernuggets,2xzsgf,richardallensmith,3,Thu Mar 5 14:03:36 2015 UTC,"Pay him no mind. Son lost and he's mad, that's all."
denvernuggets,2xzsgf,pairidaeza,2,Thu Mar 5 21:51:19 2015 UTC,A winner is a winner.
denvernuggets,2xzsgf,jussumman,0,Thu Mar 5 06:49:37 2015 UTC,Easier to change one guy than an entire team of players to fit. I don't get coaches or hiring coaches who don't or won't adopt to the players.
denvernuggets,2xyil4,SoupyWolfy,10,Wed Mar 4 23:00:24 2015 UTC,That's it. I'm buying his jersey.
denvernuggets,2xyil4,licoriceallsorts,9,Wed Mar 4 23:49:34 2015 UTC,"Awesome to hear! Faried has always seemed like a genuinely good guy, I'm glad it's true!"
denvernuggets,2xyil4,tebam,18,Wed Mar 4 23:08:50 2015 UTC,"With all the negativity surrounding him right now, this kind of stuff is great to hear.   Thanks for dropping by, and good luck to your crew as well!"
denvernuggets,2xyil4,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Wed Mar 4 23:36:56 2015 UTC,Faried is a good dude. My daughter is disabled and goes to a nuggets camp every year. Almost always they get a bottom of the roster guy to come and he is usually nice enough but looks very uncomfortable there and like he definitely was made to come there. Faried came last year and was phenomenal. Stayed longer than he needed to and made sure everyone that wanted a picture and autograph got one. Jumped right into scrimmages helping kids out. He was great. The only nugget I've ever seen do that was mozgov. I was always confused by recent speculation of him being a diva or hard to be around.   Still he can't play man defense to save his life.
denvernuggets,2xzhlu,TheViolentDwarf,8,Thu Mar 5 03:47:55 2015 UTC,"i just watched the postgame interview...Hunt has a completely different energy about him. it's amazing. FO needs to recognise this early, keep this man in the locker room"
denvernuggets,2xzhlu,teensonacid,8,Thu Mar 5 06:54:22 2015 UTC,After the daily Shaw posts on r/nba I hope Hunt makes us undefeated for the remainder of the season then goes on to drag us to  5th seed or something next year.
denvernuggets,2xzhlu,Fooshbeard,6,Thu Mar 5 06:55:17 2015 UTC,"If Brian Shaw can step into a head coach position after being an assistant, Hunt certainly deserves a fair go.  I'm all for it. He's been with the team for as long as I can remember, he knows the fans, he knows the players, he knows what this team is capable of and he's seen all the highs and lows. Hunt is practically part of the family.  If TC and Josh have an ounce of respect for this guy and this franchise they'll give him the gig. What have we got to lose? Restore some faith."
denvernuggets,2xzhlu,pairidaeza,3,Thu Mar 5 05:46:54 2015 UTC,FO will fuck it up and give it to D'Antoni.
denvernuggets,2xzhlu,123yousee,3,Thu Mar 5 12:29:53 2015 UTC,"It's crazy on how many articles are already mentioning him.  104.3 was mentioning him immediately.  he failed everywhere except in phoenix, right?  i mean i don't want to see him at all here in Denver.  They need to trade Faried to some dumb team, not sure what the deal is with Ty, but hopefully Hunt will help him.  I mean it's a no win situation for Hunt, don't you think?  Either his is defined as a stop gap right now, and moving to dantoni or someone else.  i would love to see Chauncey somehow involved, but who knows."
denvernuggets,2xzhlu,treader19,1 point,Thu Mar 5 15:43:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Cynical outlook would be for Hunt to use this opportunity to build his resume as a head coach and bail as soon as a better situation opens elsewhere, however if he does turn out to be good I think Denver would benefit from keeping him and building some stability regardless of which direction they want to go with Faried and Ty.    I'd be surprised if Denver finds someone to take Faried's contract at this stage, there are still so many years left on it."
denvernuggets,2xzhlu,123yousee,3,Fri Mar 6 00:28:43 2015 UTC,He just seems so positive and uplifting. I can rock with him
denvernuggets,2xzeqv,IdRatherBeLurking,12,Thu Mar 5 03:23:24 2015 UTC,Anyone else watching Melvin's post game? He loves this team and players.
denvernuggets,2xzeqv,tebam,14,Thu Mar 5 03:34:47 2015 UTC,Melvin is love. Melvin is life.
denvernuggets,2xzeqv,tebam,5,Thu Mar 5 03:36:01 2015 UTC,The man crush I'm developing is unreal.

denvernuggets,2xzeqv,SirJoris,2,Thu Mar 5 04:50:38 2015 UTC,How can you not love that guy. He is so freakin positive!
denvernuggets,2xzeqv,Nugforlife,9,Thu Mar 5 14:00:20 2015 UTC,It's only two games but WHAT IF we have already found our HC???
denvernuggets,2xzeqv,chokethewookie,8,Thu Mar 5 03:58:24 2015 UTC,I like Melvin more than any of the rumored candidates anyway.  In Melvin we trust!
denvernuggets,2xzeqv,Nugforlife,7,Thu Mar 5 04:03:48 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly. You bring in one of these other bozos and disrupt the love from all these players.........
denvernuggets,2xzeqv,Tskitishvili,9,Thu Mar 5 04:06:10 2015 UTC,Goddam Melvin is one likable guy.
denvernuggets,2xzeqv,THECHUNGAWANGA,8,Thu Mar 5 05:09:34 2015 UTC,I believe this team has the talent to be in the 8 seed race the whole season but due to toxic locker room environment they quit and we are where we are now. As hard as it is for me to say I dont want to go back to playing at that 8th seed level i think we should embrace the tank otherwise we will be stuck just outside the playoffs for the foreseeable future. I like the guys showing they can still ball but we need to keep losing!!!
denvernuggets,2xzeqv,bettycrockerpot,6,Thu Mar 5 04:16:04 2015 UTC,"i wonder how well denver will do against better teams, can't risk that high lottery"
denvernuggets,2xzeqv,chokethewookie,2,Thu Mar 5 03:26:26 2015 UTC,I think we can pretty much forget about a top 5 pick.
denvernuggets,2xzeqv,AgaliareptX,2,Thu Mar 5 03:37:39 2015 UTC,We still have like a top 5 hardest strength of schedule for the rest of the season though. Getting into the top 5 is unlikely but if we can stay at 6 I'll be content.
denvernuggets,2xzeqv,bettycrockerpot,1 point,Thu Mar 5 08:03:57 2015 UTC,it's ok we just need a high enough pick to get stanley johnson
denvernuggets,2xzeqv,Kawnar,2,Thu Mar 5 04:07:44 2015 UTC,he's projected top 5 in most places...
denvernuggets,2xzeqv,bettycrockerpot,1 point,Thu Mar 5 05:41:22 2015 UTC,"i really think someone is gonna do something surprising like draft that hezonja guy early, it happens every year"
denvernuggets,2xzeqv,AgaliareptX,1 point,Thu Mar 5 06:01:51 2015 UTC,"Don't think that would be too surprising. He was a top 3-5 projection before guys like Cauley-Stein returned to school and Russell shot up draft boards. And if you count Russell/Mudiay as PGs, Hezonja would be the #1 SG in the class, so if a top 5 team needed a SG he could get picked, especially since it's not a strong SG class."
denvernuggets,2xzeqv,pairidaeza,3,Thu Mar 5 08:07:41 2015 UTC,Beastly stat line for Faried.
denvernuggets,2xyuh7,growedup,6,Thu Mar 5 00:32:42 2015 UTC,"Of course this is just a well manicured statement, but I hope he gives an interview or two at a later time and really gives us his side of the story."
denvernuggets,2xyuh7,tebam,1 point,Thu Mar 5 00:36:00 2015 UTC,Ya this is so empty. I want to know how he really feels.
denvernuggets,2xyuh7,teensonacid,3,Thu Mar 5 00:44:56 2015 UTC,"he should have handled the media better, his rotations weren't very good. that's on him and he should learn from that if he's as smart as everyone claims him to be. i believe that he tried to get through to the team but they refused to do what he asked. that's on the team. it's an all round fuckup of a situation that should never has got to this point, and that's on TC and Josh. I would like to think this whole situation has been a massive eyeopener to the entire organisation."
denvernuggets,2xyuh7,ADinHD,2,Thu Mar 5 00:53:13 2015 UTC,"When I take a huge, hot, steamy dump and look back before I flush I always feel pretty good about myself. Sure. Great effort."
denvernuggets,2xyuh7,NUGGman,2,Thu Mar 5 16:21:40 2015 UTC,Shaw being proud of himself is not news. I think a little humility would go a long ways for him. Maybe one day.

denvernuggets,2xynoh,TaylorHammond9,2,Thu Mar 5 02:00:18 2015 UTC,Right. Always clouding our vision of the past.

denvernuggets,2xy94x,jd61,18,Wed Mar 4 21:32:32 2015 UTC,Shaw is probably a nice guy when he's not fucking with your minutes or blasting you in the media. All these butthurt Pacers have never served on a ship that's been helmed by Shaw.  It's easy to be friendly with a guy who doesn't have to make any hard decisions.
denvernuggets,2xy94x,tron777,6,Wed Mar 4 21:51:59 2015 UTC,this is what i've come to accept also
denvernuggets,2xy94x,teensonacid,6,Wed Mar 4 22:39:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly. There is a huge, huge difference between having someone as a assistant coach and a head coach.   I can go on a whole analysis and conversation I had with funnily enough the Rapids coach Pablo when he was still a player and we had Pareja about 'losing control' of a locker-room and not having the respect of the players. Being an assistant you have a different feel from the players, as well as you don't seem to typically seem to be as in charge.  Sounds dumb, but I'm sure a lot of you guys know back in grade school sports, if your coach wasn't there and you had the assistant coaching, it almost always felt like a mess. It's a totally different job I know, but the difference between Assistant and Coach is huge."
denvernuggets,2xy94x,TaylorHammond9,8,Wed Mar 4 23:32:14 2015 UTC,"Man.. I don't care about those pacers who all seem to love Shaw. It clearly wasn't working in Denver, they understand that right?"
denvernuggets,2xy94x,SirJoris,5,Wed Mar 4 22:06:33 2015 UTC,I'm really bummed that we don't get to play these guys again this season. I would love to see us come out and apply a size 16 foot to that ass.
denvernuggets,2xy94x,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Wed Mar 4 23:38:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I would love to unleash on them."
denvernuggets,2xy94x,Dunkman77,1 point,Thu Mar 5 00:10:14 2015 UTC,Mr. Catfish should probably not comment on the vast array of things he doesn't understand.
denvernuggets,2xxc8f,rhinoman4,5,Wed Mar 4 17:26:57 2015 UTC,"Hochman just said on twitter that a source told him Chauncey sees himself as a fit for the job. However, he went on to say he doesn't think the Nuggets will hire a first time head coach."
denvernuggets,2xxc8f,growedup,4,Wed Mar 4 17:54:56 2015 UTC,Get him in the FO!
denvernuggets,2xxc8f,IdRatherBeLurking,7,Wed Mar 4 17:57:45 2015 UTC,"A few gripes I have:   Then came a perfect storm of problems. Shaw struggled to communicate and get the players to buy into his vision. As David West noted, this was not a mature locker room Shaw was trying to reach.   Because David West is the barometer of the Nuggets locker room? George Karl said he was surprised what was happening considering the 12-13 locker room (consisting of half of our current players at the time) was the most professional and easy to manage that he has ever had. Who do you trust?   Injuries continued to be an issue, with Gallinari never being the same, JaVale McGee and others missing extended time.   He clearly got those two mixed up- Gallinari is looking even more the same than ever, and he was the one missing extended time. JaVale will never look the same as he did in 2012-13, that is clear.  I agree with his coaching choices though- I think we have a lot more options on the table than two summers ago."
denvernuggets,2xxc8f,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Wed Mar 4 17:31:11 2015 UTC,Gallo definitely looked awesome last night. Seems like he's turning the corner. Seems like the way Adrian Peterson came back from knee surgery really screwed up a lot of peoples perception on recovery time (mine included).   I agree with David West to a certain extent. It definitely doesn't seem like they have any player that commands enough respect to police the rest of the team but using a single quote from a guy that isn't anywhere close to the Nuggets locker room feels pretty unfair.
denvernuggets,2xxc8f,teensonacid,3,Wed Mar 4 18:15:57 2015 UTC,Chauncey was the reason we made it to the 09 conference finals. Get him in as an assistant coach asap
denvernuggets,2xxc8f,TaylorHammond9,5,Wed Mar 4 20:02:20 2015 UTC,I like Melvin... A lot :(

denvernuggets,2xvyjt,teensonacid,1 point,Wed Mar 4 20:00:42 2015 UTC,I wanted Shaw fired and I'm surprised. It's a pretty weird choice to fire him now. I think most people would expect it to have happened during All-Star break or after the season.

denvernuggets,2xtafl,richardallensmith,4,Wed Mar 4 00:03:49 2015 UTC,Hunt knows the culture and playstyle of the team. I would be very surprised if we didn't see at least a few nice Ws roll in before the season ends.
denvernuggets,2xtafl,dot-pixis,4,Wed Mar 4 02:37:37 2015 UTC,I was watching his interview and Iike things he was saying. He seemed confident and while he didn't go in to anything too specific on how he wants to run the team it looks like he's wants to do whatever works to win games.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHJwWuk0SdI

denvernuggets,2xt00n,tebam,3,Wed Mar 4 00:52:42 2015 UTC,Thanks!
denvernuggets,2xt00n,RadicalEucalyptus,7,Tue Mar 3 23:20:47 2015 UTC,"This is very interesting.  Now, I know that man people who frequent this sub were tired of Shaw, and wanted him out, so I can understand the elation that I am seeing everywhere, but I'd like to draw attention to how strange this is (in my opinion at least).  It is pretty clear that this team in in tanking mode.  If they end up with more than 25 wins this year, it will be a mistake (fortunately, we are well on track for the #5 slot in the lottery, which gives us a good puncher's chance at top 3 (almost 30%, with 9% chance at #1 overall).  That being said - why not just let Shaw carry out the rest of the year?  What is to be gained from having an interim coach for the last month and a half?  The only conclusion that I can come to is that the front office thinks that the longer Shaw stays around, the more damage he does to the players we have.  They want him out ASAP so that he doesn't frustrate Lawson (for example), or so that he doesn't keep wasting opportunities to get rookies minutes, or so he doesn't poison the culture beyond repair.  Anyway, it just strikes me as a horribly negative view on Shaw as a locker-room presence.  It may be justified, but that doesn't make it any less surprising for me."
denvernuggets,2xt00n,IdRatherBeLurking,9,Tue Mar 3 18:37:33 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking that the locker room situation must have gotten so bad that they had to make a stand: Support the players, or support the coach."
denvernuggets,2xt00n,RadicalEucalyptus,11,Tue Mar 3 18:40:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly - something where keeping Shaw around was permanent damage to the team (in your example, by making the players feel like management didn't support them - likely leading to players wanting to book it for greener pastures)."
denvernuggets,2xt00n,not_horatiocaine,2,Tue Mar 3 19:26:40 2015 UTC,"I agree. We have good young talent in nurk, faried, lawson, and harris (I think... hes been bad since getting more PT though). We need these guys here long term and they have to be priority #1"
denvernuggets,2xt00n,TaylorHammond9,3,Wed Mar 4 01:56:25 2015 UTC,"This surely is exactly it. Just how the players were obviously not showing him any respect, and overall just not giving a fuck. If we want to keep Ty happy and I'm sure others, they won't be good with sitting around with a coach like that."
denvernuggets,2xt00n,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Mar 3 20:17:13 2015 UTC,"And man, think how bad that environment is for our rookies..."
denvernuggets,2xt00n,TaylorHammond9,4,Tue Mar 3 20:18:17 2015 UTC,"Seriously, why would Nurkic/Gary want to hang around with a feel and mood like that in the locker room.  I shudder to think what those practices were like."
denvernuggets,2xt00n,Orangeskill,17,Tue Mar 3 20:27:25 2015 UTC,"He just had a Josh McDaniels  feel about him. Good coach, just Didn't know what he was doing, too young... and the combination  of him succeeding a extremely  succesfull coach, he had no chance Surviving long."
denvernuggets,2xt00n,NUGGman,3,Tue Mar 3 17:41:42 2015 UTC,I think that's pretty generous. Josh McDaniels is actually a very good coach. New England has yet to win a Super Bowl without him on staff.
denvernuggets,2xt00n,Orangeskill,14,Tue Mar 3 18:22:32 2015 UTC,"Nah, Josh McDaniels was a horrible head coach. But is a great assistant coach, the same exact thing can be said for Brian Shaw."
denvernuggets,2xt00n,NUGGman,-2,Tue Mar 3 19:41:43 2015 UTC,"I guess they both did win championships as assistants. At least McDaniels won a playoff game as a head coach and was responsible for a product that produced the 4 best games I've ever seen live. I will be forever thankfull for that (all Tebow games; Texans, Jets, Bears, and Steelers games were the most entertaining games I've ever seen)  With Shaw as coach, I can't remember a single amazing game that I was glad I watched."
denvernuggets,2xt00n,d-lo_tha_boss,10,Tue Mar 3 20:35:53 2015 UTC,"That was actually Foxie's first year at the helm, McDaniels got canned the year before when we went 4-12."

Good luck in the future to him..he's gonna need it.  Now...do we hire Mike Malone and initiate a Ty for Boogie conversation?

denvernuggets,2xt00n,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Tue Mar 3 17:26:33 2015 UTC,I'm a pretty casual fan who's trying to get more into basketball. Who is a good HC candidate?  Also does Shaw's firing mean anything for Connelly?
denvernuggets,2xt00n,raiderdebater15,3,Tue Mar 3 17:42:22 2015 UTC,I know D'Antoni is available. I reckon we'll have Melvin Hunt coach until the season's over.
denvernuggets,2xt00n,richardallensmith,3,Tue Mar 3 17:51:53 2015 UTC,Any chance of landing Thibs or Brooks? Seems like they will be out. Two pretty good coaching minds.
denvernuggets,2xt00n,kmarti4,7,Tue Mar 3 18:14:39 2015 UTC,I wouldn't want Brooks and our chances of landing Thibs are approximately 0 percent.
denvernuggets,2xt00n,trentyz,3,Tue Mar 3 18:29:00 2015 UTC,While thibs is a good coach I would be concerned about his defensive style of basketball. The bulls play a slow pace grind it out defensive game which is good but where has the home court advantage gone since trying to do that. While I completely agree that we need defense and offensive sets are important when the game slows down I feel like we completely  went away from our advantage at home which is the altitude. If you have that why not use it? Just my concern with him and his tendency to run players into the ground with the amount of minutes per game.
denvernuggets,2xt00n,SeanMyklKing,3,Tue Mar 3 18:38:00 2015 UTC,Thank goodness! Best news I've had for a while. D'Antoni would be a nice pickup for next season considering we have the potential to be a run and gun team. Let's get some more wins under the belt (I'm not resigning to tanking any time soon)
denvernuggets,2xt00n,chokethewookie,8,Tue Mar 3 21:42:31 2015 UTC,This still doesn't fix the fact our team is a bunch of immature teenagers.
denvernuggets,2xt00n,SeanMyklKing,23,Tue Mar 3 17:52:42 2015 UTC,"There's still problems, but maybe our next coach won't have to read a book to figure out how to relate to his players."
denvernuggets,2xt00n,d-lo_tha_boss,11,Tue Mar 3 18:09:30 2015 UTC,Our next coach better understand that he isn't there to be everyone's friend. Shaw just looked like he was trying to blend in so no one realized he was fucking clueless.
denvernuggets,2xt00n,tron777,7,Tue Mar 3 18:22:03 2015 UTC,"And then he would curiously flip to the opposite end of the spectrum and deflect blame towards the players when it suited him. Not exactly how you endear yourself to the locker room. But I completely agree with you, this team has a lot of growing up to do."
denvernuggets,2xt00n,SeanMyklKing,13,Tue Mar 3 18:46:29 2015 UTC,"It might.  These ""immature teenagers"" seemed pretty grown up when they were younger and won 57 games. I agree there needs to be a grown up in the room but Shaw wasn't it."
denvernuggets,2xt00n,SergeantBilko,3,Tue Mar 3 19:02:11 2015 UTC,Agreed.  As soon as Shaw walked in the team just didn't feel like a Nuggets team anymore. It's been like watching a really bad college basketball team.
denvernuggets,2xt00n,SirJoris,7,Tue Mar 3 19:36:42 2015 UTC,If our coach knew how to be a leader of men maybe we wouldn't have a bunch of immature teenagers.

denvernuggets,2xt00n,hypnocious,3,Tue Mar 3 18:20:33 2015 UTC,And the front office assumed that was going to be Shaw.  He is young and on the surface appeared to have a lot of energy and drive. But like everyone has said... He's just another Josh McDouchebag.

denvernuggets,2xt00n,d-lo_tha_boss,4,Tue Mar 3 17:42:06 2015 UTC,I'm kind of sad.  I'm afraid that whoever takes over as interim might be competent and cost us a top 5 pick.  I was really hoping we'd wait until the end of the year to can him.

denvernuggets,2xt00n,corybyu,8,Tue Mar 3 18:39:18 2015 UTC,He's not all wrong but there's a reason why half the teams in the league passed on Shaw after interviewing him. There was something about his personality that made teams think he wouldn't be a good coach and it certainly seemed to play itself out here in Denver.
denvernuggets,2xt00n,rvhack,5,Tue Mar 3 18:43:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't really agree with West here, what about Afflalo?  He was on the roster, great attitude, very mature and hard-working.. but yet Shaw couldn't get along with him.  Andre Miller never seemed to have issues before.. yet Shaw couldn't get along with him.  Shaw seems like a nice person, but he is not head coach material."

denvernuggets,2xsjqn,ZioFritz,0,Tue Mar 3 17:48:41 2015 UTC,"I love how much he's improved since his meniscus tear, really looking like the old Gallo now.  Bellissimo!"
denvernuggets,2xt7ga,king_lloyd11,9,Tue Mar 3 18:16:19 2015 UTC,"i hope thibs is honestly let go from chicago, that'd be option #1. JVG would be great for the entertainment factor alone but i wonder if it's even a viable option."
denvernuggets,2xt7ga,ParadeShitter,5,Tue Mar 3 18:39:15 2015 UTC,there was a report that he will be fired or traded during this summer.
denvernuggets,2xt7ga,AlienDeg,5,Tue Mar 3 18:40:43 2015 UTC,hence my optimism. clippers gave up a first for doc. i'd really hate for the nuggets to do the same for a guy who's likely on his way out anyway but it wouldn't be a bad move. i'd wager that his impact would probably be larger than any first round pick could/would be. it's certainly worth considering at least
denvernuggets,2xt7ga,ParadeShitter,5,Tue Mar 3 19:29:47 2015 UTC,"Especially if we only have to ship one of the protected first that we have (I think we have a Cleveland one and a Nicks one left?  Hard to remember where everything came from).  Point is - we may have the bargaining chips to send a 1st for Thibs without impacting the future, and it'd be great to have him, as you said."
denvernuggets,2xt7ga,RadicalEucalyptus,3,Tue Mar 3 20:45:34 2015 UTC,i think hiring an offensive coach like d'antoni would be too much like wanting to replicate what karl did. we can debate whether the move was a good one or not until we're blue in the face but if we're committed to change than it makes no sense to bring in a similar style coach.  if you want to change i think you do it on the defensive end. i think (if you're denver) getting guys that can play good team basketball and team defense is easier than trying to find you players that can score 20+ a night. if memphis can make that brand of basketball work in the west in a similar market than i think denver should strive for that too. stop trying to chase the division by building an offensive juggernaut and take a new approach. anybody with a defensive mindset that agrees with bringing in and working with foreign players might be the right move for denver at the moment
denvernuggets,2xt7ga,ParadeShitter,5,Tue Mar 3 20:55:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with you regarding D'antoni/Karl.  While there is likely at least some merit to taking advantage of the altitude with a high-octane offense (D'antoni's signature strength going back to the Nash-led Suns, and a tradition here in Denver going from Karl all the way back to Doug Moe), I think that approach is fundamentally flawed.  And that flaw comes with the way the NBA playoffs are structured.  During the regular season, the Nuggets get teams coming into town on the second night of back-to-backs, or even a 4th game in 5 nights.  Those teams are certainly at a disadvantage.  Even teams coming in on a normal road trip can have an issue, as there is less time to devote to defending this high-speed offense.  But, in the playoffs, that all goes out the window.   Generally, you get the 2-2-1-1-1 structure (I am aware that the finals are different - but the Nuggets have never gotten that far, so who cares?).  In this structure, there is at least one day between games, and sometimes two or even three!  Hence, you get rested, well-coached teams which have time to prepare for this specific, unique, fast-paced offense.  This traditionally results in the Nuggets losing badly in the playoffs, even when they are favorites.  So, I agree - the Nuggets need to move in a more strategically sound direction.  You can still take advantage of the altitude during the regular season, but do it not by running up and down the court, but through sound ball movement and a punishing defense which forces an offense to work for every shot attempt.  Then, in the event that the team finds its way back to the playoffs, that kind of non-gimicky gameplan can travel well and compete with a well-coached team."
denvernuggets,2xt7ga,RadicalEucalyptus,3,Tue Mar 3 21:19:15 2015 UTC,"Here's what we've got right now:  2015 first round draft pick from Memphis  Memphis' 1st round pick to Denver (via Cleveland) protected for selections 1-5 and 15-30 in 2015, 1-5 and 15-30 in 2016, 1-5 in 2017 and 1-5 in 2018 and unprotected in 2019 [Cleveland-Memphis, 1/22/2013; Cleveland-Denver, 1/7/2015]  2015 second round draft pick from L.A.

denvernuggets,2xt7ga,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Tue Mar 3 21:33:02 2015 UTC,"That would be great, but we're tanking fairly well now as-is.  We'd effectively have both our ping-pongs and theirs for the upcoming lotto (which, atm, would give us almost a 1-in-3 shot at #1 overall, and a top 3 pick about 4/5ths of the time).  That is pretty sweet.  But, I think the dream scenario is to tank all the way to #4 or #5 (#4 requires the Lakers to gain 3.5 games on us; not impossible with 20+ to go), and snatch a top 3 this year.  Then, next year, have the Knicks suck again and grab another top 3 while we compete for a playoff spot.  Two years running with top 3 picks is almost what the Magic did in the early 90's (when they got back-to-back ones in Shaq and Webber), and is definitely the best shot we have at building a strong team (coupling new superstars with the strong role players that we have now, both from foreign finds like Nurkic and Lauvergne and established talent like Lawson and Gallo)."

denvernuggets,2xt7ga,nocioniisgod,2,Tue Mar 3 19:41:54 2015 UTC,"Damn, really? I always thought Thibs was a perennial ""Coach of the Year"" kind of guy. The stuff he's done guiding the Bulls through injury has been tremendous.  It would be amazing if we could get him. He brings solid defense to the squads he's worked with, something the Nuggets have not had in recent years."

denvernuggets,2xt7ga,Futurebrain,2,Tue Mar 3 21:13:07 2015 UTC,"No way we'll get Thibs. Considering he's a defensive coach and we're certainly not a defensive team, I can't see it happening."
denvernuggets,2xt7ga,trentyz,4,Tue Mar 3 21:44:04 2015 UTC,I would almost take a gamble on Ewing. Maybe I've been living in NYC too long.  D'Antoni makes sense...I guess. Not sure going down that road is such a good idea. I wasn't a fan of Shaw but there really isn't a great crop of replacements out there that I know of.

denvernuggets,2xsthn,growedup,7,Tue Mar 3 16:36:07 2015 UTC,so the dude is averaging what... 7 less points in the last 6 games? totally warrants a slam piece  clearly he's lost his mojo but to cite a few less ppg is pretty dumb. and saying putting 1996 jordan on this team wouldn't do anything is pretty fucking dumb too. just like the rest of this dude's comments imo.
denvernuggets,2xsthn,ParadeShitter,3,Tue Mar 3 17:11:28 2015 UTC,The Hock Man goin' hard.
denvernuggets,2xsthn,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Mar 3 16:36:29 2015 UTC,"I've been a big fan of his since he was running the Nuggets beat before Dempsey. He's a great writer that, unlike blowhards like Kiszla, can actually show more than one side to a story. I was bummed that he got taken off the beat, but he deserved the promotion and Dempsey has done a fine job covering the team since."
denvernuggets,2xsthn,MilchandCookies,3,Tue Mar 3 16:48:47 2015 UTC,"it seems the whole team is set on tanking. I haven't attended one win this year in over 5 games (Houston and Washington went to overtime, but the others were blowouts). A friend said that ESPN covered how the Nuggets broke the huddle saying ""6 weeks"". I guess they are ready for it to be over too.   With Lawson basically taking a backseat I am at least pleased to see Will Barton step up and Gallinari is trying to get back into scoring. Gallinari can be frustrating to watch though as he will drive with no intentions of scoring and just try to draw a  foul. I saw one good game of Lauvergne against Phoenix. He showed potential but needs to be more consistent. Gary Harris has not shown enough confidence on the floor. I personally think they need to axe Shaw and really work on drafting well to not repeat this next season. Next year's starting 5 may be - Lawson, Barton, Gallinari, Faried, Nurkic? with Chandler, Lauvergne, Nelson, Foye and Hickson regularly coming off the bench.  EDIT: I posted this and immediately that friend called me saying Shaw was fired."
denvernuggets,2xsthn,MilchandCookies,2,Tue Mar 3 17:52:08 2015 UTC,"also on that Nuggets survey BEFORE the all star break I had trouble saying that Lawson was the best leader on the team. Now it's way harder to say that. It's not Brian Shaw though either, although he wasn't an option. In the end I may not have said anyone because I hit enter by accident and it submitted prematurely. Apologies to /u/IdRatherBeLurking"
denvernuggets,2xsthn,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Tue Mar 3 17:55:57 2015 UTC,Haha it's all good. I was probably more surprised by the results of that question than any of the others.

denvernuggets,2xpj0h,IdRatherBeLurking,17,Mon Mar 2 23:39:55 2015 UTC,"Going from Iggy to Foye and Koufos to Hickson hurts too.  If you count Gallo being a shell of his former self, we've downgraded in 3 starting positions and implemented a worse offensive system. That's going to hurt any team."
denvernuggets,2xpj0h,eathbau,8,Mon Mar 2 21:50:48 2015 UTC,I think losing Masai ujiri in the front office was the biggest blow

denvernuggets,2xpj0h,rvhack,4,Tue Mar 3 14:38:54 2015 UTC,"Gallo may have looked like a shell of his former self at the beginning of the season, but he's made huge strides since his meniscus surgery.   We also didn't have any choice with Iggy, he was going to be a dirty stinkin' turncoat whether we kept Karl or not. Trading Koufos and Gobert for Foye, Arthur and Green wasn't the best move, but would Mozgov have garnered two 1st round pics with Koufos still here and Gobert on the way? Would we have picked Jusuf at all?   The moves I can't deny are JJ Hickson and NateRob. JJ can at least contribute on the offensive end, but Robinson being here has seriously hurt us the last two seasons. Not being able to keep Brooks meant that we didn't have a true backup PG until Jameer came, when it was already too late."
denvernuggets,2xpj0h,IdRatherBeLurking,6,Mon Mar 2 23:28:11 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong, but I think there's other important variables at play. First and foremost, Brian Shaw is clearly not a good head coach yet. Secondly, Connelly was basically tasked with improving George's team without George there, while simultaneously building towards Shaw's strengths. It was this horrible combination of moves that has landed us where we are today.  I definitely wouldn't disagree that firing Karl was the catalyst. Letting him play out his contract (if he was willing to, of course) while letting Connelly build for the future might have been the best move to make. Hell, I don't know. I'm content with putting it all on Kroenke."
denvernuggets,2xpj0h,IdRatherBeLurking,6,Mon Mar 2 21:00:45 2015 UTC,"""I didn't demand an extension—I said to Josh, 'I will coach this team next year, I'm excited about coaching this team next year, but in the last year of a contract, there are things that could happen.

denvernuggets,2xpj0h,richardallensmith,2,Tue Mar 3 06:31:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that ignores a lot of context. 6 games against the Warriors without Galo and with Iggy not giving effort (err tipping our game plan) and Curry putting on one of the greatest shooting expos I've ever seen in a series. The year before that, 7 games as the dog against the Lakers that I still think we lost due to officiating. The year before that, we went into the playoffs with a team that had only been playing together for a few months after trading away Melo and Chauncey. For at least those last three years, I don't know that another coach could have gotten more out of those teams."

denvernuggets,2xpj0h,NUGGman,3,Wed Mar 4 18:59:15 2015 UTC,"Josh Kroenke took over ownership with Karl in place. He probably always wanted to hire his own guy who might have loyalty to him. Karl probably didn't care what Josh's opinions were and could have neglected to give him the respect he felt he deserved.  Whatever the reason, it was a bad move or ""stupid"" as George Karl put it. I'm sure some people will argue that the only true way to the top is to spend some time on the bottom. But, I think you can find plenty of examples of teams that have had lottery picks for a long time and still probably don't have a realistic shot at winning any championships in the next decade."
denvernuggets,2xpj0h,jussumman,0,Mon Mar 2 21:24:32 2015 UTC,"Josh Kroenke   Oh I didn't know there was a new owner... and he's a heir to the Walton's $$$, Oh No! That explains a bit. These freaking passed down money owners are terrible. Nuggets, Rapids, Avalanche, these are the toys he received for Christmas. Now I'm upset. Knicks, Lakers, Nuggests, it's the same story, they swoop in and the team goes into the garbage. They earned nothing, don't know anything about the sport, yet they are the President and owner of a big league franchise. The Knicks owners' son immediately fired the coach and hired his favorite player Isiah Thomas (who ended up being the worst). This guy, hit the Walton lottery Kroenke, he had a hand in firing the successful George Karl then? and hire a guy he ""likes"" and will be loyal to him. So brilliant. How's that working out?"

We lost the pick, but aren't on the hook for the $$$, right?  If we didn't do the trade, we could have kept the pick, but be on the hook if we waived him and he resigned somewhere else?  If he signs, who picks up the salary, and is it for the full salary?  I am assuming Philly is on the hook, but are they fully on the hook if just say Sacremento or whoever picks them up?    With all that said, we basically traded that pick away to relieve us of the 20 million or whatever he was owed, right?"

There was decent ball movement, good off-ball cuts and solid drives to the rim. That being said, we lost to the Anthony Davis-less pelicans. In our best game in a month. We might be the least intimidating team to play against without Nurkic. No one is scared of JJ Hickson locking down the paint. Ty might be secretly playing terribly in order to get Brian Shaw fired.

denvernuggets,2xm2fw,teensonacid,0,Mon Mar 2 00:22:58 2015 UTC,We no good. Haven't had a winning projection in what feels like over a month.
denvernuggets,2xm2fw,teensonacid,2,Mon Mar 2 00:24:32 2015 UTC,"No way will it be that close :(  Thanks for doing these though, where do you get the Series Notes and Connections info from? Those are cool."
denvernuggets,2xm2fw,teensonacid,0,Mon Mar 2 00:39:24 2015 UTC,"No worries! I crib them from the official media notes for both teams. You can always find them in the box score link from NBA.com, under the team names. There's about twice as many pieces of information than what I post, you should check it out!"
denvernuggets,2xm2fw,chucho320,2,Mon Mar 2 00:41:56 2015 UTC,"Well, this will be interesting"
denvernuggets,2xm2fw,chucho320,0,Mon Mar 2 01:10:34 2015 UTC,You could put it that way.

Brooklyn's is the bar in the Pepsi Center lot and is a pretty chill place with good drinks. If you're really into beer, Falling Rock Tap House on Blake St. and like 19th has the most beers on tap in the state."

I know they had season tickets in the late 80s so I'm thinking it was a gift of some sort. My grandfather thinks it was a set and this is the only one that hasn't broken. But he's 93 so... who knows?
denvernuggets,2xiosi,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Sun Mar 1 04:02:53 2015 UTC,Maybe tweet the Nuggets and see if they know anything?
denvernuggets,2xiosi,Love013,2,Sun Mar 1 06:25:14 2015 UTC,I tweeted the picture to the Nuggets account this morning. I really hope to hear back.

denvernuggets,2xhadt,GoAvs14,1 point,Sat Feb 28 18:43:01 2015 UTC,Are you saying J.R. Smith is smart?
denvernuggets,2xhadt,tylerthetiger,1 point,Sat Feb 28 22:38:25 2015 UTC,"no, now I'm saying you're stupid. Google how ratios work. high talent, low stupidity=high talent:stupidity ratio. if he was talented AND smart, it'd be a lower ratio. (i.e. 15:5 is a higher ratio than 15:15.)"
denvernuggets,2xhadt,GoAvs14,1 point,Sun Mar 1 21:33:07 2015 UTC,Wow you are retarded.  It sounds like you are saying that he is not smart but you're too retarded too understand that would lower his talent:stupidity ratio.

denvernuggets,2xhadt,GoAvs14,2,Mon Mar 2 01:58:46 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, you did say ""low stupidity"" when it seems you mean that J.R. Smith has a high level of stupidity. A 15:15 ratio would essentially be a one-to-one ratio, meaning that for every unit of talent he has an equal amount of stupidity. Maybe you meant talent to intelligence? This sub is full of friends, let's be nice to each other. =)"

denvernuggets,2xfwda,friendo_not_friend,20,Sat Feb 28 06:46:31 2015 UTC,I really hope we are tanking. The only way we get out of this shit is through drafting some real talent. Nobody is going to want to come to a shithole in free agency.
denvernuggets,2xfwda,Neverethe,10,Sat Feb 28 11:39:37 2015 UTC,If this isn't tanking I'd hate to see what is.
denvernuggets,2xfwda,chokethewookie,7,Sat Feb 28 16:25:50 2015 UTC,"I feel like rotations were an issue before this season for Shaw, and I certainly don't think we were tanking last year. it's become pretty obvious we are tanking this year tho. It's hard to lose as much as we do."
denvernuggets,2xfwda,hotsauce888,3,Sat Feb 28 06:56:30 2015 UTC,Bitching to the media or answering a question honestly about the effort of his star players. I'll take Everyone is to blame for $500 please.
denvernuggets,2xfwda,teensonacid,2,Sat Feb 28 22:51:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is a fair way to put it. This whole thing is a mess.  I'm just bummed that since I don't have cable/satellite, I bought League Pass so I could watch the nugs, and a VPN to be ""out of market"", and this is the product I paid for."
denvernuggets,2xfwda,jd61,1 point,Sun Mar 1 02:09:02 2015 UTC,"But if we are tanking, why the hell didn't we just deal out Chandler, Hickson, Lawson, and/or Faried for loads of draft picks and prospects? Better to put a bad team out on the floor that tries to win, but loses."

denvernuggets,2xelg5,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Sat Feb 28 03:01:47 2015 UTC,"No official time table yet from the organization. He also hasn't really mentioned anything on twitter. We'll probably get some more info during the broadcast tonight.  From the U.S. National Library of Medicine:   A grade I ankle sprain will usually start to get better after a few days   and that...   Most ankle sprains without ligament tears are, for the most part, healed after two weeks   So, taking into consideration that he's getting NBA-level treatment, I'd say a few days to two weeks seems pretty reasonable, barring any torn ligaments. It doesn't seem like he's had an MRI, just an XRay at the Pepsi Center, so that's probably a good sign too."
denvernuggets,2xezsw,IdRatherBeLurking,4,Sat Feb 28 01:04:28 2015 UTC,Yikes.
denvernuggets,2xezsw,orangesoda123,3,Sat Feb 28 02:37:01 2015 UTC,He is like Saul Goodman of Denver
denvernuggets,2xcx1f,not_horatiocaine,12,Fri Feb 27 15:25:22 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, the players seemed to give up on him on the court ages ago. Maybe Shaw really is a competent coach in waiting, who the hell knows-- the culture is just too tainted now for it to be here."
denvernuggets,2xcx1f,tehKEVSTAR,9,Fri Feb 27 15:51:55 2015 UTC,What I'd pay to find out what's REALLY going on in there..
denvernuggets,2xcx1f,ADinHD,4,Fri Feb 27 17:34:18 2015 UTC,"Your flair started this thought in my head...  I think that with what's going down in the locker room, how players are acting on the court really shows what they're made of. Gallinari is a fucking boss and I hope he's on this team for years to come."
denvernuggets,2xcx1f,IdRatherBeLurking,6,Fri Feb 27 18:24:28 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree. This is why Knicks fans still love the guy, he just comes out, plays hard, and plays the right way.

He's what Mile High basketball should be all about. We could get Mr. (Park) Hill in the FO, who's won it all playing the right way, and a wild bruiser in Juka and have the Goodfellas."

denvernuggets,2xcx1f,IdRatherBeLurking,9,Fri Feb 27 22:13:01 2015 UTC,"I feel sorry for Barton and Joff, Joff most of all. Your first NBA experience is walking into this disaster? Oof."
denvernuggets,2xcx1f,with2nns,5,Fri Feb 27 18:42:49 2015 UTC,"Not just joff and Barton, but all the rooks. Imagine Nurk and Gary could have learned a lot more in a stable locker room with some veterans"
denvernuggets,2xcx1f,SirJoris,3,Fri Feb 27 20:20:47 2015 UTC,"So nurk only follows the following players on twitter; joff, ty, faried, chandler & gallo, so I'm just gonna assume everyone else is the problem :D"
denvernuggets,2xcx1f,SirJoris,3,Fri Feb 27 20:37:52 2015 UTC,"Pretty strange.. that he is already following Joff, but most guys who he played with for most of the season.."
denvernuggets,2xcx1f,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Fri Feb 27 20:53:57 2015 UTC,"Joff played in serbia for a while and speaks serbo/croatian even, they probably know each other from europe."
denvernuggets,2xcx1f,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Fri Feb 27 21:01:39 2015 UTC,I think that's such a good attribute for him to have. Being able to converse with and translate for Nurkic is huge in building chemistry. And they already sit next to each other on the plane!
denvernuggets,2xcx1f,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Fri Feb 27 21:04:21 2015 UTC,I dunno I was watching that math hoops video on the nuggets YouTube channel and nurk seems pretty good at english.

denvernuggets,2xcx1f,teensonacid,3,Fri Feb 27 21:07:09 2015 UTC,"Came here to say this. They are stuck between a rock and a hard place. They obviously want to build chemistry with teammates, but everyone else hates Shaw."
denvernuggets,2xcx1f,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Fri Feb 27 19:19:04 2015 UTC,This is ridiculous if it's true. Not even knowing who they're playing that night?! Culture needs to change here before anything gets better
denvernuggets,2xcx1f,ADinHD,3,Fri Feb 27 18:44:00 2015 UTC,"Reading this frustrates me a lot. If this is true i'm in for shippin everybody away, exept the rooks, gallo and maybe Barton(if he keeps playin with the energy he has shown). I don't care that Shaw sucks, but these guys get payed to play. And I expect them to act like profesionals! Cause this is fuckin nuts if true!"
denvernuggets,2xcx1f,tebam,3,Fri Feb 27 20:26:13 2015 UTC,My sentiments exactly! We fired our marketing manager at work yesterday necause she was consistently underperforming and not living up to her contract. Some people think they're worth more than they are and can just cruise through and let everyone else take the blame.
denvernuggets,2xepry,THECHUNGAWANGA,4,Fri Feb 27 23:35:11 2015 UTC,"Barton's attitude is absolutely amazing to see in days as dark as these. I haven't had the chance to watch him a ton, but he's a high energy guy that has a nose for driving the lane and creating space.   I also haven't had a ton of time to watch JoLo yet, but he seems like his fundamentals are strong. He's not great at any one thing, but I think he can be a really serviceable role player. His footwork is good, IQ seems to be there, shooting is decent, and post game as well. He believes that he can contribute most on rebounds and defense, which is always great to hear. Once he's up to NBA speed and used to NBA rules, I think we'll see him shine."
denvernuggets,2xepry,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Fri Feb 27 23:48:49 2015 UTC,"Barton seems to be one of those guys you can't help but love. He seems always excited and happy to be wherever he is doing whatever he's doing. I'm sure he's good for any locker room (and word is our's needs some help). But I'm wary of getting too attached because I don't know how long he'll be here.  Joffrey is definitely better at rebounding than I though he would be too. He looks very athletic and with him and Nurk, it appears we might actually be able to pass the ball into the post and have them play a facilitator role, where they hit a cutting Lawson or throw it out to an open Gallo or Chandler at the 3 point line if the defense collapses. Although, I wouldn't say Joffrey is that great from the 3 point line he is exactly as proficient as Faried so far this year (both 1-4) but as often as he's shooting out there, he better be good.   I want to see Joffrey stop using such a wide base and stop using his forearms when he sets a pick. For some reason, seeing him set a pick is like nails on the chalkboard for me."
denvernuggets,2xepry,NUGGman,1 point,Sat Feb 28 00:02:03 2015 UTC,I'm currently going to school in Portland so I have some friends who are big Blazer fans. They were very sad to see Barton go. It'll be interesting to see him in a role where he's actually getting minutes. In Portland he was a chemistry/energy guy. He actually nicknamed himself the People's Champ so I'm excited to see what he can bring.
denvernuggets,2xepry,J_Rack,2,Sat Feb 28 01:00:00 2015 UTC,"we miss the trill and t rob so much, RIPCITY!"
denvernuggets,2xepry,cmantis,1 point,Sat Feb 28 11:05:13 2015 UTC,"I think king Joff is more than capable to stretch the floor. This summer I watched a few france games during the Fiba world cup, there he showed that he is pretty good outside shooter. He isn't yet making the shots consisently but that will come over time. Hist post game is already pretty impressive, I like him a lot!"
denvernuggets,2xeyyz,IdRatherBeLurking,8,Sat Feb 28 00:57:09 2015 UTC,"Was worried that this would be a team we might beat, but Shaw has got it covered by choosing to start Hickson against Gobert!"

denvernuggets,2xeyyz,licoriceallsorts,3,Sat Feb 28 02:46:26 2015 UTC,Gallo is the only guy from the Karl era we hold on to moving forward next year right?
denvernuggets,2xeyyz,thechosenone16,2,Sat Feb 28 02:49:08 2015 UTC,"I'd like to keep Lawson also, but it might be best to just clean house and send him out, especially if we can get Karl to overpay."

How much can we rely on Green next year?  Run Harris and Barton through the 3 a bit, pick up someone who can run the 3-4 well  in FA or return for the guys going out"

denvernuggets,2x8qq8,jussumman,15,Thu Feb 26 15:58:47 2015 UTC,"Karl to Shaw has obviously been a big downgrade, but letting George go was still the right decision.  His system was awesome conceptually, and a couple tweaks would have taken it to another scarier level. Unfortunately, he shot himself in the foot with weird playoff rotations, iffy in-game adjustments, throwing players under the bus like his successor, and generally getting outcoached with his back against the wall. The Warriors series was a microcosm of his correctable yet critical flaws as a coach."
denvernuggets,2x8qq8,tehKEVSTAR,3,Thu Feb 26 16:52:34 2015 UTC,"Karls rotations is what frustrated me the most. your comment is spot on, i couldn't have said it any better myself"
denvernuggets,2x8qq8,teensonacid,2,Fri Feb 27 00:22:53 2015 UTC,Who did he throw under the bus? I thought Josh was upset that Karl was tying their hands on the players by raving about the chemistry the team had and constantly complementing players.   I also think Josh didn't like that everybody around him was getting credit and didn't feel like everyone knew who was really running the show.
denvernuggets,2x8qq8,NUGGman,4,Fri Feb 27 05:39:21 2015 UTC,"JR constantly, Melo, KMart. Those general ""we need more effort"" lines. Merits to criticism aside, it's just not a good idea to use the media to send players a message"
denvernuggets,2x8qq8,tehKEVSTAR,6,Fri Feb 27 15:44:24 2015 UTC,"I've always liked George Karl. I'm sure his personality behind the scenes may be tough and some of his quirks were maddening. That said he is damn good at getting the best out of his players. If you look at all the players he's coached you will in a large % they had their best years under him. One quote about coaching I love is that ""80% of coaching is getting your team to play hard"" and I think GK did that well in most cases.   For the lack of playoff success in a lot of those cases it was clear we were the lesser talented team on the court. Even the last year with the Warriors series when we were higher ranked the matchup head to head was just brutal. So I think he deserves some criticism there, but maybe not as much as he gets."
denvernuggets,2x8qq8,bzzltyr,5,Thu Feb 26 17:11:07 2015 UTC,"I think the decision to fire Coach Karl was fine. He didn't want to be a lame duck head coach on a one year deal (the last year of his deal.) The FO wasn't a 100% on giving him a new deal presumably because of the relative lack of playoff success. One or both sides played hardball, and the relationship became untenable.  The Nuggets clearly overachieved in their 57 win campaign. I remember watching the Finals between Miami and San Antonio that season, and it was painfully obvious that the Nuggets were clearly not ""ready for prime-time."" Our fellas probably peaked as a team that year and it still wasn't going to be good enough.  Edit: I do want to make one caveat. I think that team played as well as they were going to play that season, but they also got unlucky against GSW. Curry literally became a superstar in that series. Plus, their starting power forward went down and it actually made them better.   When I say they peaked and it still wasn't going to be good enough I am referring to winning the NBA finals. I think they totally had the ability to win a playoff series or two that season. In my opinion, that's a pretty good season!"
denvernuggets,2x8qq8,growedup,3,Thu Feb 26 20:25:31 2015 UTC,"It was the right decision. We had a higher ceiling with Karl, but it wasn't high enough. And we would be stuck with early playoff exits for the foreseeable future."
denvernuggets,2x8qq8,Arrow218,2,Mon Mar 2 04:09:42 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say, it's been over a year but I still feel like the core of the roster is still Karl's guys. Karl ran an uptempo game that got up and down the court really quickly, defense be damned. The roster was built for that. We've moved some assets around before the trade deadline this year but I still think we'd be more successful running a George Karl style of game with the guys we currently have. For Shaw to come in and be successful immediately I think we really would have had to clear house and build a roster for the type of team he wanted right off the bat. But we didn't do that, and it's understandable why, we we're just coming off a 50+ win season, why would you mess with that roster?  Also to an extent I think Shaw's inability to work with this roster does reflect his abilities as a head coach. Sure this might not be the roster he wants but it's the roster he has, a good coach would be able to improvise and coach a style of play that best utilizes the assets he has. It's also pretty clear the players don't respect him as much as they respected Karl.  Do I think it was a mistake to fire Karl? I don't know. During Karl's tenure we had some bitch ass teams, but we only made it out of the first round once. Sure there's something to be said about getting to the playoffs 10 times in a row, but ultimately the goal of every (playoff) team is to win a championship. I don't know if Karl was the type of coach that could get us there. Shaw was a downgrade but I don't know if firing Karl was the worst decision management could have made."
denvernuggets,2x8qq8,Crinnle,2,Thu Feb 26 17:19:52 2015 UTC,When you get out coached by Mark Jackson in a playoffs series something is seriously wrong.
denvernuggets,2x8qq8,eathbau,2,Thu Feb 26 20:43:20 2015 UTC,"I didn't think he got out coached at all...Splash bros shot out of their minds, and JaVale & Faried missed a bunch of free throws."
denvernuggets,2x8qq8,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Thu Feb 26 20:48:29 2015 UTC,"Mark was faking starting lineups, immediately went big as soon as Karl went with his Ty/Dre/Iggy/Chandler/Faried lineup. Basically for big chunks of the game Lawson and Dre who are terrible defenders were defending the splash bros. Usually to stop a hot jump shooting team you need to slow the pace down a bit and go big to wear the smaller guys down. Karl's counter was to go even smaller, and small ball only works if you have jumpshooting.  They were hot against the Spurs as well but Pops shut it down after 1 game."
denvernuggets,2x8qq8,eathbau,1 point,Thu Feb 26 21:51:43 2015 UTC,"You might want to actually look at how that lineup did that series. They were +7.4 points, +1.2 rebounding, and +4.5 assists. The stats don't actually indicate that lineup was a bad one.  Source"
denvernuggets,2x8qq8,NUGGman,0,Mon Mar 2 21:43:27 2015 UTC,Fair points.
denvernuggets,2x8qq8,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Thu Feb 26 21:53:58 2015 UTC,"I've not been happy about getting rid of guys who choose to make a home here in Denver. George loved it here and wouldn't have left. After Melo, that's a quality I value more. Also made it really hard to support Shaw when he got Miller traded. I freaking saw Andre Miller on the light rail going to watch the Nuggets play against the Mavs in the playoffs. That was after we traded him the first time. I really don't like that our organization has traded away 3 guys I like twice!"
denvernuggets,2x8qq8,NUGGman,2,Fri Feb 27 05:41:34 2015 UTC,"Eh, history is history. Yeah, in hindsight it wasn't a superb idea, especially if they didn't have a good replacement in mind and management was changing. But it's over. The team that won 57 games is totally gutted. It's time for a complete rebuild. We need a top pick to get a franchise guy and then some great FA to complement him in the future, as well as a coach that isn't inept. I have hope for the future, the nuggets have a good history. We just need to fully rebuild at this point. Edit: I forgot to mention Nurkic. He is essential to our rebuilding. He's mean, ruthless, and stone-cold. We need a team like that. We need a more refined bad boys/Thuggets team. We need to be that team no one wants to play because they know shit will go down."
denvernuggets,2x8qq8,Ititmore,0,Thu Feb 26 16:08:02 2015 UTC,"Haha great question! I was planning on posting this soon. From the subreddit survey, you can see here that ~80% think we should have not fired him. That's a solid group of people that are okay with it, and I'd love to hear from them!  It's hard to know who to trust in this situation. George seemed pretty damn surprised when he got the boot. This makes me think that the FO (well, basically just Josh at this point) didn't feel the need to try and work it out. We also have the company line that ""Masai asked us not to make an offer"". For a GM that is so highly respected and had seemingly done so well with the organization, it would be pretty unreasonable to me for Kroenke not to make some kind of offer. It just wasn't enough.  What I really wish is that Karl left on better terms. He'd probably be coach right now if that had happened."

denvernuggets,2x5efg,not_horatiocaine,6,Wed Feb 25 20:19:06 2015 UTC,THIS.  plz report OP
denvernuggets,2x5efg,fry_1,2,Wed Feb 25 21:22:30 2015 UTC,I've never been to a NBA game but I have to European games. If the 5 guys who are on the court don't listen to the coach it's usually a sign of disrespect and lack of authority and you'll rarely see that.   Most of the time the whole team listens to the coach's instructions.
denvernuggets,2x5efg,eathbau,5,Wed Feb 25 21:46:42 2015 UTC,"You got it. I was going to be looking at that anyway (seeing how Shaw commands the ""huddle""), but it seems like a lot of nba players stare at the video board during timeouts."
denvernuggets,2x5efg,orangesoda123,5,Wed Feb 25 23:38:08 2015 UTC,"One thing is clear from where I an, 10 rows up from the nuggets bench.   Ty Lawson does not care any more. Totally disengaged on the sideline, doesn't even go into the huddle in timeouts when he's on the bench. He doesn't coach the young guys up at all either.  That and joffrey is a nice piece for us. He's a younger and more offensively skilled kosta koufos when he learns the defensive rotations.   More to follow."
denvernuggets,2x5efg,teensonacid,1 point,Wed Feb 25 22:33:41 2015 UTC,"Anything on Foye or Hickson? As those two are our ""vets"" and that Shaw gives them a lot of leniency."
denvernuggets,2x5efg,IdRatherBeLurking,1 point,Thu Feb 26 02:52:50 2015 UTC,"Man that really bums me out. Ty was a sparkle in my eye from the beginning. I have always appreciated his style of play. When I first saw him in a Nugget's jersey, I told my girlfriend ""this dude will be great."" I really became attached to him as a player and so has my girlfriend. Got her a Lawson jersey for her birthday a few years ago that was at the top of her list. I starting hearing the rumors of a possible trade before the deadline and was extremely against it but recently have started to be okay with trading him in the near future. Now I'm becoming almost frustrated with him. I realize Shaw is far from ideal and the team has hit some humongous speed bumps but dammit man, show some character and integrity. It really bums me out."
denvernuggets,2x5efg,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Thu Feb 26 11:27:30 2015 UTC,"definitely the relationship between the players and Shaw, i'm with everyone else here. I'd like to know what the atmosphere on the bench is like."
denvernuggets,2x5efg,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Sat Feb 28 04:51:50 2015 UTC,I'm really interested in seeing how friendly guys like Ty and Faried are with Shaw. I've got a feeling that they don't pay him much mind.
denvernuggets,2x5efg,SirJoris,3,Wed Feb 25 22:57:40 2015 UTC,Okay I'm try to make a note of that
denvernuggets,2x3q14,skipaBturner,13,Wed Feb 25 11:46:32 2015 UTC,Imagine what his assists per game would look like if we weren't trying to build brick houses every night.
denvernuggets,2x3q14,denverNUGGs,5,Wed Feb 25 12:58:15 2015 UTC,I really wish he was better with his left hand. He always wants to drive to the right and finish with the right. Also wish he was a more vocal leader and had some aggression every night because he really is good when he is aggressive. Other than those few things I think he is a really good point guard. Oh and trust in that jumpshot cause if it's dropping you can't be guarded.
denvernuggets,2x3q14,kmarti4,2,Wed Feb 25 16:32:17 2015 UTC,"Ty lawson definitely needs to be more alpha, way more aggressive. We have seen what he's like when he's in kill mode, he just needs to tap into that on a more consistent level"
denvernuggets,2x3q14,not_horatiocaine,8,Thu Feb 26 00:27:34 2015 UTC,"Ty is a player who I think I'd be mad for about a month of we traded him, but then I'd think, ""meh, he was what he was."" Way more valuable to Denver than he would be to anyone else.  He is the Maurice jones drew of the nba."
denvernuggets,2x3q14,Kawnar,1 point,Wed Feb 25 15:21:13 2015 UTC,Wow. That was a great comparison.
denvernuggets,2x3q14,NUGGman,3,Wed Feb 25 18:18:39 2015 UTC,"It's not surprising that he has a ton of points and assists when he's played third most minutes in the NBA. The assist/turnover ratio is impressive though.   But it should be mentioned that this isn't anywhere near his best shooting % year and his Free Throw percentage is the worst it's ever been.  I love Ty, but lets not get carried away."
denvernuggets,2x3q14,NUGGman,3,Wed Feb 25 15:18:25 2015 UTC,If we weren't missing so many open shots this season ty could have average 12+ assist easily imo
denvernuggets,2x3q14,ADinHD,2,Thu Feb 26 00:28:35 2015 UTC,I can't argue with that.
denvernuggets,2x3q14,pizzzzzza,3,Thu Feb 26 02:21:13 2015 UTC,"He's not underrated, he's putting up decent numbers on a terrible team in a stacked conference. And most of his contemporaries mentioned in the article are LEADING their squads into the postseason. And staying out of trouble. I love Ty, but he needs to take the next step already."
denvernuggets,2x3q14,Samcrates,2,Wed Feb 25 19:01:59 2015 UTC,"I agree, but what's his next step? Playoff success? Could Chris Paul do that with this Nuggs team? I'm not so sure.  I'd really love to see what Ty could do with a good team."
