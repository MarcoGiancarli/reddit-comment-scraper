Archery,3e4jpk,TroofTeller,3,Tue Jul 21 22:14:52 2015 UTC,Unless your looking for easy reselling or buying used limbs long riser and short limbs are perfectly fine. Practical difference with the modern limb materials is really negligible.
Archery,3e4jpk,JJaska,2,Wed Jul 22 05:59:37 2015 UTC,"The longer limbs will give you greater advantage of leverage through the draw, meaning increase in poundage per inch of draw will be consistent through longer draws.  Shorter limbs give you less advantage of leverage as the string approaches a 90o angle faster than longer limbs through a long draw but consist of less mass to slow down the return and therefore offer higher cast.  With a short draw I see no reason whatsoever to go with the longer limbs :)"
Archery,3e277y,One_Life_Love,6,Tue Jul 21 11:38:32 2015 UTC,We have all tried to group on a single face before. We have all shot arrows before that we shouldnt have. Let the man enjoy his robinhood and brag a bit... SHEESH!  Nice shooting man!
Archery,3e277y,guitarhero832,6,Tue Jul 21 18:45:46 2015 UTC,"well done, but there's 5 spots on that target face for a reason.  if you shoot arrows into a group at close range with a compound, you're just going to smash gear up."
Archery,3e277y,mediweevil,6,Tue Jul 21 12:00:18 2015 UTC,Thanks but I've always shot compound and those were 45 yard shots. I'm calling it dumb luck.

Archery,3e1z38,BronzeDragonrider,6,Tue Jul 21 09:47:29 2015 UTC,"The whole ""dominant eye"" thing is nothing more than a recommendation, not a rule.  Ideally you do want to be shooting left or right handed based on which is your dominant eye but it's not necessary, and if you are shooting ""wrong eyed"" then there is one incredibly simple way to resolve any issues. Close your dominant eye.  So for me I shoot right handed but my eye dominance says I should shoot left handed, however I have incredibly bad coordination and no matter how much I tried when I started shooting as a junior I just couldn't get the hang of shooting left handed, the entire range of motion just felt wrong, so I spent my time as a junior shooting right handed with my left eye shut. Now that I have more experience however I can comfortably shoot with both eyes open with no issues at all.  If you want the ultimate demonstration of why eye dominance is overrated you just need to look at the world of compound shooters.  95% of compound archers will shoot a right handed bow but I can guarantee you that nowhere near 95% of compound archers are right eye dominant.  If you are left eye dominant and left handed then great, shoot left handed. However if you're right handed and more comfortable shooting right handed then stick with it and either shoot with your left eye closed or with a patch over it."
Archery,3e1z38,mackemforever,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:17 2015 UTC,Good advice... I'm curious as to why 95% of compound shooters shoot right. Don't they still make left handed compound bows?
Archery,3e1z38,Bearded_Ctenophore,3,Tue Jul 21 18:24:01 2015 UTC,Maybe eye dominance isn't as crucial when you have a peep to look through?
Archery,3e1z38,Muleo,3,Tue Jul 21 19:38:41 2015 UTC,"It's because compound bows lend themselves to the use of very complex sight systems.  If you shoot with a sight pin, post, and peep served into the string, and close the other eye, or partly close it, it forces your sight picture to align."
Archery,3e1z38,ADDeviant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:00:45 2015 UTC,"Trust me, it's very simple to shoot perfectly well with both eyes open with a compound, I know a huge number of archers who do it including a number of top class archers. Perfect example is a guy called Matt Arnold who last weekend shot a 1402 WA1440 round and who has always shot with both eyes open."
Archery,3e1z38,mackemforever,2,Tue Jul 21 21:31:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and most of the guys I shoot and hunt with do that.  Even some guys with cross eye dominance.   I was only saying that, in the case of cross eye dominance, if that doesn't work for you, it is pretty easy to make an adjustment simply by closing your dominant eye, if that works for you.    That is a harder adjustment to make with instinctive, or even gap shooting."
Archery,3e1z38,ADDeviant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:11:13 2015 UTC,"Yes there are left handed compounds made but they have always been made in far smaller numbers than right handed bows, presumably because the majority of the population is right handed and therefore when compounds started to become popular it was assumed that the majority would shoot right handed.  So as a result there is generally a wider choice of right handed bows, as a large amount don't get made into a left handed model, there is often a premium added to left handed bows (less so now than there used to be), and the second hand market for left handed bows is virtually non-existent.  In short it's much easier to find yourself a right handed bow and shoot it that way regardless of your eye dominance.  And before anybody says that doing it that way is going to put you at a disadvantage, I can tell you for a fact that three of the top five compound archers in the UK shoot right handed but are left eye dominant."
Archery,3e1z38,mackemforever,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:34:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the excellent response. I had already been shooting with one eye closed from the beginning. I can't even imagine shooting with both eyes open, seems utterly bizarre to me! I was mainly curious as to why my left dominant eye gives me such terrible aim when with my right eye I can shoot reasonably well for a newbie."
Archery,3e1z38,mackemforever,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:59:49 2015 UTC,"So if I am to understand correctly, eye dominance is only an issue, at least to start with, when you're shooting with both eyes open? I sure wish my beginner's archery class had clarified that..."
Archery,3e1z38,JJaska,2,Tue Jul 21 22:06:31 2015 UTC,"Essentially yes. If you want to shoot with both eyes open then it is much easier to do if you are shooting with the ""correct"" hand for your dominant eye. So if you're left eye dominant and shooting left handed it will be much simpler than if you're left eye dominant and shooting right handed.  However that doesn't mean that it's impossible to shoot with two eyes open even if you don't use your dominant eye for aiming, it simply means that it's more difficult to do and will take you longer to get used to.  I'm actually just going to give my own personal opinion on eye dominance here however, which is that it's complete and utter bullshit.  When I started shooting again in October I got heavily involved with my University club on the coaching side, because I shot recurve a lot as a junior and have been around novices & coached novices for years. There were at least a dozen people who had made zero progress over their first year of shooting because they were shooting according to their eye dominance despite the fact that required them to shoot with their weaker hand, so there were right handed people who had so little control with their left hand that they couldn't ever write their own name with it being made to shoot left handed by the club, and of course they weren't getting anywhere as a result.  The very first thing I did was speak to every single novice and tell them to shoot according to their strong hand, not their strong eye. Any archers who were then shooting ""wrong eyed"" were kitted out with an eye patch to wear while shooting until such time that they were comfortable with keeping that eye closed without the patch.  Without exception every single one of those novices who was being made to shoot with their weak hand started to improve rapidly once switching to their correct hand and ""non-dominant eye"", they all started to enjoy it much more because they could see their progress, and we have one guy and one girl who went from being the worst novice in the club for their gender to being in the top two or three within a few months of making the switch.  So essentially my advice to you would be to tell eye dominance to take a hike, shoot according to your strong hand and either shoot with your non-aiming eye closed or with a patch over it."
Archery,3e1z38,Muleo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:19:39 2015 UTC,"That's very encouraging, thank you. It does make me feel better about it, not to mention that I didn't waste my money on my right handed bow, haha!"
Archery,3e1z38,Dakunaa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:59:24 2015 UTC,"World Archery guideline has been hand dominance over eye dominance for quite some time.  I myself try to find out how strong dominance does the person have. Some people that are nearly ambidextrous and very strong eye dominance might be better off starting with eye dominance. But as you said, you had people just like this that didn't have the coordination.  You're a good man :)"
Archery,3e1z38,mediweevil,2,Wed Jul 22 05:40:07 2015 UTC,How are you aiming?
Archery,3e1z38,Dakunaa,2,Tue Jul 21 18:02:05 2015 UTC,"Well, unless you are looking straight from the nock, through the arrow unto what you're aiming at, you will have to be aiming somewhere other than where you want the arrow to land, simply due to the fact that the direct line from your eye to the target isn't the path the arrow will travel."
Archery,3e1z38,LostxinthexMusic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:00:11 2015 UTC,"I understand that, but I had been led to believe that using your dominant eye should help with more accurate aiming, which was not the case for me by a longshot. I broke the tip off of two arrows by hitting the metal edge of the target on my first attempts because it was so far off course."
Archery,3e1z38,bluearch3r,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:52:37 2015 UTC,"I had been led to believe that using your dominant eye should help with more accurate aiming   all it does is affect the degree of gap you need to learn to apply.  estimating gap both vertically and horizontally is pretty much the entire challenge of shooting without sights or string/face walking.  it's normal, everyone has to do it."
Archery,3e1z38,Dakunaa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:02:30 2015 UTC,"While this might be true, this only goes for when you have perfect form. But considering you've only shot for a few months, I don't believe this to be the case. What I think is happening is that your form is (unbeknownst to you) better in some critical areas when you shoot left handed compared to when you don't."
Archery,3e1z38,JJaska,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:59 2015 UTC,"It's likely that the arrows you were using were improperly spined for the weight of the bow. If the arrows aren't stiff enough, on a lefty bow, they will fly off to the left.  If you want to keep using your right-handed bow, and want to aim using your right eye, you can use an eye patch or shooting glasses with a sticker over the left eye to make it easier to aim with your right eye.  However, I think it's far more likely that your problems when shooting left-handed arise from improperly spined arrows."
Archery,3e1z38,JJaska,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:27:09 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I'll look into that. I don't see how that can be the case though, since both my own bow and the left handed one I tried were of the same draw weight, yet only the left handed one made my arrows shoot way to the left."
Archery,3e1z38,cantbelieveitsbacon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:50:29 2015 UTC,I shoot both eyes open so I kinda ignore the dominant eye rule.
Archery,3e1z38,JJaska,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:01:52 2015 UTC,"Not entirely true. You draw closer to one eye than to the other, which means that eye will see from the more favorable position."
Archery,3e28v0,tasuke,3,Tue Jul 21 11:57:50 2015 UTC,Take it to your local pro shop ask them to look it over...and take a quick form lesson from them.
Archery,3e28v0,Trickarrows,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:52:23 2015 UTC,"Unless it is some cheap, nasty piece of junk bow it'll be completely fine after a year in all likelihood.  As trickarrows said, take it along to a pro shop and get them to give it a once over, they'll just check that the limbs are still in good condition and that none of the cables are worn, but chances are that they won't find anything wrong with it.  A lesson or two wouldn't hurt either, just to remind you of basic technique, but honestly once you know the fundamentals of technique there's nothing more to be done other than to get shooting. There's only one way to get better at archery and that's by putting arrows down range!"
Archery,3e28v0,mackemforever,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:50:21 2015 UTC,"check the strings and cables for damage (fraying, nicks, etc) check the limbs for signs of damage check the limb bolts and various hardware for signs of rust  acquire chainmail and paintball mask; fasten gear to self  shoot an arrow through it  check body for signs of damage  repeat steps 1-3"
Archery,3e1k1k,tipsygelding,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:28:41 2015 UTC,"So what is your goal here, to buy limbs to use on your friends bow?  Are you going to be swapping them back and forth all the time so he can use it?  A new Samick Sage is like.. $130.  A set of Sage limbs is around $75.  So you'd only be saving yourself $55.  If you buy the full bow, you'll have a complete working bow of your own.  If you mix limbs you'll also almost certainly have to find a string that's the right size - I don't think the polaris/sage risers will give you the same length tip to tip."

Archery,3dxxcf,For_The_Fail,11,Tue Jul 21 16:49:46 2015 UTC,"I have never played archery tag before but I used to play a LARP style game that allowed the use of bows with a draw weight of 20# or lower with a max draw of 28"".  Everyone made their own arrows in pretty much the same way. It essentially boiled down to putting a penny perpendicular to the shaft so it didn't poke through the foam. A few foam disks (usually made from one of those hard foam sleeping bag pad) and topped with a softer foam and wrapped in tape.  Not the greatest thing to get shot in the face with but didn't really hurt much either. We tested equipment by using a bit of common sense and then shooting each other with them once we were confident it wasn't going to do any serious damage."

Archery,3dxxcf,Smelle,6,Tue Jul 21 22:12:28 2015 UTC,"It's hard to get ahold of because you can only do it at licensed locations which are very few and far between. Individuals can't buy the arrows so you have to buy them secondhand, and since they only sell to businesses they're extremely expensive. For safety reasons I think the maximum draw weight allowed is 10-15 lbs. So I doubt many people here have done it since it's uncommon and expensive."

You're not allowed to snipe people and they cant use their bows to deflect the shots. Arrows are front heavy from the foam. It's soft but hard enough to give an impact. The bows are super weak like <15 pounds from what  I remember. Just remember to stretch beforehand and warm up cus otherwise you'll be sore the next day from dashing everywhere.

Archery,3dzvif,Dakunaa,3,Mon Jul 20 22:58:15 2015 UTC,"Learnt a valuable lesson about not having any expectations and especially about not using your scope when you're close to your score.  Going into 30m I knew I had 16 points to play with, which considering in practice recently I've been consistently up around 152 should have been simple. Much less so after dropping 4 in the first half dozen however!  Last end, stupidly was concentrating at the start on how I still had two points to play with, and of course I started off with two dreadful shots into the 9, which thanks to using my scope I knew were dreadful, so I was absolutely bricking it on the final shot knowing I needed a 10 to hit my score!"

Materials engineering you can work with composites to make better limbs, risers, arrows etc.  I suppose you can also design lighter or better limbs and risers.  You will be relatively limited to a few companies who would need to employ an engineer with those specific skills so it would probably be more difficult to break into the industry unless you have am existing contact or want to start your own company."

But if you're going to be drawing instructional infographics, you should know that isn't how you pull a string with fingers. You don't tense up your fingers to keep the knuckles straight or even curled badly like Hawkeye.  Instead your wrist should bend in and your fingers out at the knuckles to get a strong, stable grip on the string using as few muscles as possible."

Three...these are just materials to help an instructor, they are not meant to be the be-all end-all of instruction they don't have enough information for them to be...   The two drawings you are caught up on are  lacking in fine detail. I hope that instructors can use these drawings help to show a new shooter some of the finer points after they use a visual reference like this to make things a bit easier to teach.

I made artistic choices for use in instruction, these are intended for that use...not as a replacement for instruction.   Are they perfect no...are they for the most part a good structural base for teaching new shooters. All day long.

Archery,3e061c,Dustin587,4,Mon Jul 20 23:03:13 2015 UTC,"Barebow and olympic style have the same basic stance. The major difference is anchor point (and aiming method, of course) When I was still taking classes I used to switch between them (with some difficulty though)  'True' traditional (as in, shooting historical bows with no sights, weights or shelves) is a bit different due to the lack of shelf which seems to lead to the need for canting the bow. Haven't seen a traditional shooter shoot with their bow held vertical (Except me, but I shoot eastern style which is an entirely different beast)  All in all all styles share a lot of things which means that if you become good at shooting barebow you'll do well in shooting olympic style if you switch. And any archery style will teach you consistency which is the most important.  If you're still in doubt you could always opt to switch between the two while using club equipment and when buying your own buy a basic olympic set? Take off the sight and you have a barebow. It's how a lot of people around here do it."
Archery,3e061c,Elitehamster,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:32:16 2015 UTC,"seems to lead to the need for canting the bow. Haven't seen a traditional shooter shoot with their bow held vertical   There is no advantage to canting a bow whatsoever. If there was, you'd see it happen at the Olympic games as well. The reason for canting is because of poor finger management. When someone starts shooting, you very often see the arrow flip off the bow. The easiest way to manage is to cant the bow, instead of taking the time to learn how to manage fingers. This is a solution to a problem early on in the archery career, and not something introduced later on.,"
Archery,3e061c,Dakunaa,0,Tue Jul 21 10:04:59 2015 UTC,You've been giving horrible advice. Do you shoot barebow? Longbow? Are you pulling shit out of your ass?  The advantage to canting a bow that isn't cut to center is that it takes the riser out of your sight line... so that you can see the target area.
Archery,3e061c,hatefist,0,Tue Jul 21 17:57:00 2015 UTC,"I'm shooting (if you can look through my submitted posts you'll see her) a very wide bow. Shooting without a cant will not put the riser in your sight line, unless you literally anchor on your front teeth."

If there was, you'd see it happen at the Olympic games as well.    Further, we're talking about traditional, no sights, archery. You don't see olympic archers canting a bow because of the method in which they are shooting -- barebow stringwalking.   You don't need to be an expert to observe many traditional archers canting a bow, and the reasoning to it.   Before giving very subjective, one-sided advice, step back and think about why traditional archers DO cant their bows. Fred Bear? Howard Hill? Byron Ferguson?"
Archery,3e061c,hatefist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:07:59 2015 UTC,"Seriously, you think Olympic archers shoot barebow and stringwalk?  In any case, what is the reasoning behind it then?

Archery,3e061c,Dakunaa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:37:02 2015 UTC,"One of the most important things you will learn through archery is to feel your limbs and your body. This is something that will carry over when switching between styles, as well as the control that comes with it."
Archery,3e061c,Dakunaa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:06:29 2015 UTC,"Lip anchor is more traditional because it places the arrow closer to your eye as a point of reference so that you can better judge initial trajectory.   A jaw anchor places the arrow further from your eye but can be more comfortable -- I vary between the two shooting trad   Generally speaking, there's a ton of crossover. Further, there's a ton of stray as well. For example, barebow shooting (not traditional) involves walking a string to use the arrow-tip as a reference point. While unsighted, this is closer to oly-style IMO.  Let me ask you this: what are your archery goals? Do you mostly want to hang out with other archers at the range while shooting all day? Do you want to hang out in the woods shooting your bow at unmarked tarets? Do you want to shoot 3d?   Both styles of archery can do and perform in these areas. Oly-style is MORE suited for some of these things, whereas trad-style is more suited for other things; both styles can cross over.   I started with sights years ago and found myself wanting to go traditional, then wanting to try compound with sights, and switching between the two (i'm better with a trad bow than i am with a sighted compound -- go figure).   At the end of the day -- you're flinging a pointy stick with a bendy stick and string"

Archery,3dvryk,Prototype958,3,Mon Jul 20 01:36:07 2015 UTC,"Archery is typically extremely safe. Instances where people are messing up their hands or hurting themselves are typically because they weren't using the correct equipment (arrows that are too short can be a nasty injury), they didn't know what they were doing, or they were straight up just screwing around and not paying attention.   There is the very rare bow failure, but again that risk can be mitigated by proper maintenance which you'll learn as you get into the sport."
Archery,3dvryk,Prototype958,2,Mon Jul 20 13:55:14 2015 UTC,"How much is a ""middle priced guitar""?  If it's in the 500 dollar range I would suggest getting both. I recently just got into compound bows but have been playing guitar for years. I would suggest starting with a 200-250 price range for a decent Pawn shop guitar and using the rest for a decent bow. They're both not overnight success but personally I found archery the easier to learn of the two. That way you may find out your better at one or the other(or both!) and not be a full 500-700 dollars out."
Archery,3dvryk,Prototype958,2,Mon Jul 20 03:23:57 2015 UTC,I have 800 saved and was planning on buying a Taylor but i can save for more. I want a recurve bow and are they expensive?
Archery,3dvryk,jonhykrazy,3,Mon Jul 20 05:53:00 2015 UTC,"Recurve bows are typically cheaper than compounds. You can get a good starter/intermediate recurve that will last you a good long time for anywhere from 150-250$. Arrows I think tend to be a little more expensive for recurves. I could be wrong on that, but it does depend on how you plan to shoot. If you don't use an arrow rest (shooting off the shelf) you'll need arrows with feathers instead of the plastic vanes. Feathers add a little to the price."
Archery,3dvili,ClanLee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:43:58 2015 UTC,My club is starting this soon and I'm looking forward to it. Especially since I plan on competing as soon as I can.
Archery,3dvili,Zonpakuto,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:07:41 2015 UTC,My club has been trying to figure out how to get more people to participate in various club shoots.  The pins were one way to motivate new archers to shoot in events.  We've started to promote the pins and it's already started to generate interest.
Archery,3dvili,Zonpakuto,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:43:34 2015 UTC,I've been needing to sign up for USA archery anyway and my coach knows I would love this. Now that my entire set up is complete I'm ready to start serious practice for competitions.
Archery,3dw0h1,wisaaka,2,Mon Jul 20 00:17:04 2015 UTC,"They will all suit you fine. Sebastian Flute equipment is, put simply, Win&Win equipment that hasn't been checked as thoroughly as the W&W line. If I was in your situation I'd go for the SF Premium Plus, as its the only one I've really shot more than a dozen times. As for limbs, you can pick up past model hoyt for cheap. Or W&W for that matter. With recurve, you use a finger tab."
Archery,3dw0h1,El_Hamerino,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:02:52 2015 UTC,Anything in particular to look for in a tab?  Or is that pretty much an item that really is up to the feel of the individual?
Archery,3dw0h1,El_Hamerino,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:10:34 2015 UTC,Yeah finger tabs vary between everyone.
Archery,3dw0h1,storynerd,2,Mon Jul 20 04:26:37 2015 UTC,"The Forged+ is very nice, as I expect most people will tell you as it's a very popular intermediate riser! That said, if you're not aiming to compete a lot and just want to get out and have a good time, it's possibly not worth the extra money in your case. I haven't shot the Premium so can't offer a direct comparison. The SF Axiom limbs are good to start out with. Cartel do cheap sights which are fine for beginners although the quality isn't amazing so most people tend to replace them eventually.  For arm guard and tab, a lot of it's personal preference. For example, some people have nice leather arm guards... and then there's me who has the cheapest piece of plastic available! See if people in your club will let you try theirs on to get a feel for them. Tab, I'd recommend one with a platform as most people find it easier to get a consistent anchor like that. Again, shop around, see if you can try any out. And as already stated, for recurve, sadly mechanical releases aren't allowed :)"
Archery,3dw0h1,Frankenarcher,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:51:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, while I like the idea of getting really decent gear, I think just getting good starter gear and working on mechanics is probably better.  Thanks for your input.  I felt that the local competitive archer recommendation I received was a bit higher than I need starting out, but it's always good to get advice from varied sources.  Funny you mentioned Cartel.  The local club is having a raffle for a US$450 setup including a Cartel bow."
Archery,3dw0h1,Frankenarcher,2,Tue Jul 21 00:30:59 2015 UTC,"I shoot the avante right now. With very inexpensive samick privilege limbs, it is a bloody tack driver. It has a very robust limb adjustment system too. I have modified the grip a bit, but other than that, it is going to be the best riser for the money of the three you mentioned. As for the limbs, almost all the JOAD kids at my club shoot the SF axiom limbs and they seem to do great for them."
Archery,3dw0h1,Frankenarcher,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:54:51 2015 UTC,"Do you feel the Avante is limiting you from a recreational shooter point of view at all?  I don't mind having a less expensive riser to start and later upgrading, if necessary.  But, being confident in that riser would definitely allow me a bit more freedom for purchasing my starter bow, limbs, sight, etc. fairly quickly."
Archery,3dw0h1,Psychoduckk,2,Tue Jul 21 00:32:33 2015 UTC,"The avante is the part of my bow that I am most confident in. I would like better limbs, sight, plunger, rest, stabilizers...etc. But my riser is rock solid, and I would put the limb adjustment system on the avante up against (and probably beat) any of the other risers you mentioned on ease of use and sheer beefiness. Thats not to say that this is the riser that I will shoot until the end of time, but its a good 2-3 year riser to get into the sport and for $99 you can't beat it.  I am going to link you to some videos from a guy who does some good reviews on all these risers  avante  SF Premium  SF Forged+"
Archery,3dw0h1,Frankenarcher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:44:32 2015 UTC,I think this guy's reviews are pretty great. Thanks for linking them.  He really sells me on the Avante for my current needs.
Archery,3dvkas,Matttroll,2,Sun Jul 19 21:58:38 2015 UTC,"You forgot to mention what weight the Bear Cruzer is, and what size/spine (and length) the arrow shafts are"
Archery,3dvkas,Muleo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:08:16 2015 UTC,"Sorry, the arrows are 30 inches and 1816 for the shaft size.  Edit: And the poundage is around 35 or so I think."
Archery,3dvkas,Crecy333,-5,Mon Jul 20 02:42:21 2015 UTC,"Just to throw it out there, I've got bows of 30, 45, and 50#. And I'd shoot the same arrow off each. Likewise, I've got heavy arrows and light, stiff arrows and pliable. And I'd shoot one after another.  An archer guides his arrows. And, having a consistent shot is just as much about reading the field and getting your form perfect as having the perfect arrow. A good archer can shoot a warped arrow through a strong gale and hit his target. Shoot the arrows you've got, and worry not about arrows you want."
Archery,3dvkas,Trickarrows,6,Mon Jul 20 01:46:46 2015 UTC,Correct arrow spine is the most critical aspect to consistent shooting. Anyone whom shoots the same arrow at 30# and 50# doesn't know much about their equipment.  Proper arrow length and spine stiffness is also paramount for SAFETY. Improperly spined arrows can over bend and in turn cause an arrow to break mid shot. Resulting in a pseudo dry fire of the bow.  Just off the top of my head...An 1816 aluminum arrow is designed for use on bows of very light pound ages under 35 for recurve and under 25 compound. Depending on length.  Reference an arrow spine chart easily availible on Easton Archery's website about what spine is correct for your bow.
Archery,3dvy1j,zulari,4,Sun Jul 19 23:56:08 2015 UTC,"Like others said, check you draw length, but with fiberglass recurves, I can shoot some 58"" bows like the Martin Mamba with my 30"" draw, though i prefer about a 62""-64"" bow.  And I have had no problem at all sneaking  around in dense riverbottom habitat with 68 and 70"" longbows."
Archery,3dvy1j,ADDeviant,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:24:49 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem I am having is when I go back to a full draw with my current 62"" bow is the angle of the string starts to pinch my fingers together and I feel like it is affecting my shots, not to mention being a bit hard on the bottom of my ring finger"
Archery,3dvy1j,ADDeviant,2,Mon Jul 20 13:00:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm familiar with that problem myself.  Some form things can help, like bringing your back elbow down, which doesn't help the angle, but allows a cleaner release in spite of the angle.  There are a lot of longer used target recurves from the 60's and 70's on Ebay that often pull in the high 30's at 28"" and would be well into the hunting weights at 31"".   These often run 66-70"".    And custom recurve makers, who make marvelous,  but expensive bows, often offer 64 or 66"" models.  Different recurves stack and finger pinch differently.  The only ""good"" into level recurves I have seen that I like that run into the 64"" lengths are made by Greatree Archery.  They have several 64"" models: the. Washington, the Outrage, etc.. the finish work on these isn't the best ( I had to sand the string grooves out on one because it had sharp corners, and was wrecking strings) but the designs are sound, and the glue lines are fine, and the handles well designed, and they look good."
Archery,3dvy1j,Trickarrows,2,Mon Jul 20 15:34:02 2015 UTC,First and foremost...how are you measuring your draw length?

Archery,3dvy1j,huisme,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:08:48 2015 UTC,"Along these lines, can anyone suggest a good take down recurve that is longer than 64 inches for a beginner?   Samick sage is nice and all but I find the 62 inches a bit short for my draw length, what would be a comparable starting bow that is a big longer?"
Archery,3dvy1j,EditsAfterUpboats,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:35:46 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't be able to hunt with one of mine this year due to a waiting list but I could go as short as 62"" for your draw, preferably in this style.  Edit: Wow, what's going on here? The other two are right and I offered my option, where's more relevant content?"
Archery,3dvy1j,EditsAfterUpboats,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:12:00 2015 UTC,"Do you actually have a 31"" draw? The only reason I ask is that your draw length will shorten going from compound to traditional and guessing based on armspan isn't accurate. 6'1"" with long arms and I draw 27"".  That said, bow length recommendations are for target bows not hunting bows. Go somewhere you can try one out and pick one that feels comfortable/ doesn't stack. Realistically, you'll want something 60"" and up. I don't know your budget but a Samick Journey is 64"", Samick Red Stag is 60"", and a Bear Takedown with B riser #3 limbs is 64"". You can get Bear Takedowns used.  Why is this controversial?"
Archery,3dvy1j,huisme,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:51:19 2015 UTC,"I only use recurves, and I am pretty sure that my draw length is that long, my buddy had a bear takedown that is about 30 years old and I quite like it, I will look into getting one that is 64."

It makes a great sausage, stew, steak or chops. An average deer (one worth taking a shot at) will field dress (guts and skin taken out/off) to ~50lbs of meat.

Archery,3dtfvz,setzz,2,Mon Jul 20 23:56:15 2015 UTC,"Heavier bows are more stable (which makes sense). This is one reason why aluminium bows are still preferred by many people (Hoyt, especially). That said, most of the weight is from the distribution of weights on the stabilisers, but having a steadier riser is desirable. How much weight you want in the riser itself is personal preference."
Archery,3dtfvz,Tswtzr22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:59:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this - so riser can be as light / heavy as you want, keeping in mind that the stabilisers does the bulk of the weight distribution (I assume this works if you have V-bars and not just the long rod)."

There's a scene in Avatar where the main character puts his bow across his chest, and jumps off a tree. Some archers carry it that way.   Others have a big quiver, like horsebow quivers, that fit the bow inside them. Or, quivers like in LOTR have straps to hold the bow.  There's straps that clip to the nocks with a longer string to hold on your shoulder, but those are mostly for compound bows.  But your way doesn't seem bad, just not really normal."

Archery,3dsmjr,Sunnydaysonmymind,18,Sun Jul 19 01:46:21 2015 UTC,"if you have never shot any bow, you have a long road ahead of you before you should ethically ""hunt"".   Compounds have sights,easier power to hold and faster speeds.    Recurves  can have sights  also has soeed and power though you are holding the actual draw weight.  Longbows are traditional, no sights and you better be a damn good  shot and know your accurate range.  Bows aside, you should know about arrow penetration, kill spots, tracking etc... Not just flinging arrows at an elk and hoping it dies.  one shot, heavy arrow at a certain spot.  with any bow you should know you can put 10/10 arrows in an 6-8"" spot all the time. And know your bow poundage is strong enough. Different provinces/states have different criteria for bow draw weight, broahead rules etc... do some research.    if your brand new to archery, you have no business hunting with a bow.   BUT, its an awesome past time and should be acheived given the right or ethical approach.   I have shot for about 4 years, 3 traditional.  For the last 2 years onhave studied hunting,practicing, stalking, reading, practicing and more practice.   I had many shots available last fall but they were out of range, no decent shot placement and not the right time to take the shot.    you may be an avid accurate gun hunter, but if your new to archery id say take some time and see what style of bow appeals to you and why?   No bow style is better or worse, its the archer/hunter that decides what is best.   Good luck."

Archery,3dsmjr,ADDeviant,2,Sun Jul 19 04:44:40 2015 UTC,"Here's what I've found to be the difference so far:  Longbows: Trades off speed for stability (i.e. once you get good with a longbow you can make really tricky shots, like laying prone, without much problem). In my opinion, hardest to learn, easiest to shoot. Longbow forms are different for everyone based on their body, so it takes a lot of time and research to find what's good for you. Shooting it, however, is way easier (compared to a recurve or compound bow), as the longbow's simpler mechanical design is much more forgiving than a compound or a recurve (with another trade off being more handshock)  Recurve: The middle ground between a longbow and a compound bow. It's mechanically simpler than a compound bow, but since its limbs store extra energy, your form needs to be more spot on which may be tricky in a hunting situation if you need to make a shot from a weird angle (prone or leaning over from a tree stand).  Any mistake you make in your form is going to be magnified downrange because of the extra stored up energy, but the tradeoff is that a recurve will fling arrows downrange faster than a longbow of the same weight.   Compound bows: Mechanically the most complex out of the 3 and the least forgiving. Your follow through needs to be absolutely perfect to make a good shot, and any mistakes in your form will be exponentially magnified in how off your shot is, but the benefit is that these arrows are flung up to 2 times the speed of a traditional bow. You'll also have the benefit of a mechanical letoff, which will help hold the bow's weight back and also let you know when you hit full draw. Compound bows, once they're all tricked out, can weigh the heaviest out of the 3 so it may be harder to huck this around the woods. I'd say compound bows are the easiest to learn, but the hardest to shoot perfectly since your form needs to be so spot on with these.  Compound bows are not designed to be shot canted, so don't expect to be able to make many tricky/weird shots with these (especially if you're using sights-- anything less than perfectly vertical will make those sights useless)  And the biggest downside to compound bows is that if something breaks on it (which, the more complicated something is the more ways there are for it to break), you'd better have a spare bow or the tools to repair it in the field or your day of hunting is over (like if your sight pins get knocked loose or if you drop your bow and one of the cams gets knocked out of alignment)  If you're looking on hunting sooner rather than later, you can learn to shoot a compound bow well enough to hunt in under a year (faster with coaching). There's enough pro shops out there that can help tune your bow up as well so you don't need to worry about arrow stiffness or tip weights too much.  If you're looking more for the thrill of the hunt, I'd go with a longbow-- it's take the longest to learn but it's also the most versatile out of the other types of bows in terms of the kinds of situations you'll be able to shoot from"
Archery,3dsmjr,TheWonderLemon,2,Mon Jul 20 07:49:28 2015 UTC,Thanks. I was thinking longbow or recurve but after reading your post im going more towards long bow. What would you say is a good brand to get without breaking the bank
Archery,3dsmjr,TheWonderLemon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:50:57 2015 UTC,"You're probably going to hate me for this, but because the longbow style is so different between each person, what I like and what works for me might not be what you like or what works for you (specifically, the ""works for you"" part)  I shoot a Howard Hill longbow (http://howardhillarchery.com/ -- specifically the Big 5). It's made out layers of bamboo, which make it lighter and snappier than most other woods but it's got some pretty intense hand shock. I happen to like the hand shock (makes it feel more primal)-- since the bow is thicker than most American Flatbows, it's a quick, short jerk (huehuehue), whereas something like a Bear Montana Longbow, which has thinner, flatter limbs, will give you more wiggling after each shot  I'm also a big fan of Bob Sarrels bows: http://www.sarrelsarchery.com  They have little to no handshock for how heavy they get (he makes them only up to 65 lbs. max) and they fling arrows really fast. But, most of his designs have a reflex/deflex, which, like a recurve, gives you extra speed and recoil absorptions at the cost of how forgiving it is. Most of his bows are made with osage, which isn't as snappy as bamboo but still can fling arrows downrange pretty darn fast (and absorbs more of the handshock)  As far as cost of the bow, for a good longbow at full price will probably set you back $700ish, plus another $100 for a good set of carbon arrows. There's also the cost of an arm guard (you could go cheap or nice-- if you're shooting longbow I'd suggest finding a nice thick leather armguard to keep your forearm from getting smacked up), and then a good glove or tab (I'd recommend anything by EW Bateman Co, about $50 for a glove: http://www.ewbateman.com/Gloves.htm)  (another note: gloves tend to work better with back quivers as you'll have an easier time with grabbing an arrow off of your back, but if you're hunting you'll be restricted to 2 bladed broadheads, as 3+ bladed broadheads will cut into your back through the quiver, especially if you fall over)  This may seem expensive, but a good compound bow (Hoyt, Matthews, or Elite are the ones I see most hunters use) will cost about $800 as a base price, then it's another $200 for a good sight, at least another $100 for a drop away rest, then there's the cost of labor to have a pro shop align the cams for you.  That said, if the $700 price is making you balk right now, start off with a cheaper recurve (Sammick Sage or the like) as heavy as you can go (bear in mind that 45 lbs @ 28 inches is the minimum for hunting in most states, though with hunting, the heavier you can go the better because you'll want to be able to pierce the animals' thick skin/hide and hit their vital organs).  From here, start saving up, as it'll probably take you at least a year or two of training (maybe faster if you have good coaching) before you'll be good enough to go hunting anyways, so there's no need to buy all of the top of the line equipment to start with  Hit me up again when you pick up a bow and I'll send you some helpful videos on traditional shooting!"
Archery,3dsmjr,Aldenrenfrid,2,Tue Jul 21 03:14:49 2015 UTC,EDIT:Retracted  I'm not overly familiar with brands and such as a traditional archer myself. But I can tell you for the size of game you're hunting stick with at least a compound. Or if hogs... Go with a crossbow.
Archery,3dsmjr,ADDeviant,3,Sun Jul 19 02:11:00 2015 UTC,"Why?  I regularly shoot cleanly through elk and hogs with a 57 lb recurve.  Passthroughs on 7 of the 10 elk I have shot, wbich is way better than my compound-toting brother and friends.  Crossbows always seem so fast, but speed is not the key, by itself."
Archery,3dsmjr,Aldenrenfrid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:42:53 2015 UTC,"That's awesome, outta curiosity whats your range? I know too many stories of firearms failing to penetrate hogs. But experience trumps stories so I retract my recommendation."
Archery,3dsmjr,EditsAfterUpboats,2,Sun Jul 19 05:58:39 2015 UTC,"Funny thing about bowhunting (and especially trad guys) is that nobody really brags about long range shots... the point is to get as close as you can and know animal anatomy. That's probably why so many gun hunters don't pen hogs, they don't have the same mindset we have when making the shot. It doesn't surprise me that the shield on a hog can stop a bullet just like an arrow. Crossbows have the lowest animal recovery rates in my state not because the weapon isn't lethal, but because the hunters that are attracted to crossbows don't have the right mindset for it.  Of course the same goes for traditional hunters. /u/ADDeviant probably has an efficient setup for getting passthroughs: heavy arrows matched to the bow, two blade cut on contact broadheads, and not hitting shoulder blades."
Archery,3dsmjr,ADDeviant,2,Sun Jul 19 16:42:19 2015 UTC,"Actually, I purposely crowd the shoulder a bit and have a bad habit of engaging bone. (sheepish grin) my favorite bow is 57 or 58 lb at a 30"" draw, and I do shoot usually footed cedar arrows @ 700-720 gr. rugged 2 blade heads, 20% foc, single bevels, and I'm an arrow flight fanatic.  One of the reasons I don't hunt more with the primitive bows I make, is that I have trouble getting PERFECT arrow flight.  I trust their accuracy and power, but tuning every arrow perfecfly on a bow that isn't centershot is just time consuming, and difficult."
Archery,3dsmjr,EditsAfterUpboats,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:39:54 2015 UTC,"You hit the nail on the head about tuning arrows to primitive bows.

Archery,3dsmjr,ADDeviant,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:54:34 2015 UTC,"I have killed elk out to 50 yards with the recurve, but most seasons, 30 and under is where I stay, and pigs and elk both tend to be shorter shots.  Elk: 15, 13, 22, 8, 10, 16, 17, 13, @50, 18, as near as I can remember.  I've never taken a muledeer under 20.  Pigs take some doing, but arrows and bullets act differently.  As /u/editsafterupboats says, arrow combination is easily as important as bow selection or raw power. I'm in the arrow momentum camp.  Momentum trumps kinetic energy for penetration, and penetration=lethality, not wound size or number of blades, etc."
Archery,3dsmjr,Crecy333,2,Sun Jul 19 18:33:35 2015 UTC,"If you haven't shot before, go to a nearby archery shop and ask about lessons. Shoot a compound, shoot properly.  If you only want to hunt, and take pride in the stalking and kill, stick to compound.  If you delight in the skill, and the strength of an archer, and find that arrows are your passion, then get good at learning about archery and what affects each shot. THEN, go for a recurve.  I've shot all three, and find the longbow as the most challenging. That's why it's my favorite. I found passion in crafting bows, making arrows, sewing quivers, and sending one perfect arrow after another into the sky.   My buddy just likes to kill deer for the backstraps, so he shoots compound. More expensive, but easier to handle.  If you're near SE Texas, I'll sell you one of my compounds for $60."

Kinda hard to beat for $50/year (you have to do a bit of volunteer work also but nbd)  I just started shooting, I've only shot there once.  Seems fine.  It's a bit tough to get too, down a gravel road.  The entrance I came in was steep and rutted from the recent rains.  The exit was flatter/easier though.  It's also a little remote - it's in Emma Long park.  About a half hour from where I live, maybe 20 minutes from work."
Archery,3dovcc,TheWonderLemon,2,Sun Jul 19 02:51:52 2015 UTC,"I just moved away from Austin, but I was indeed a member there!  Like /u/RustyBrooks said, the drive in is a little tough once you get to the range but the drive there along City Park Rd. is fantastic (cliffside driving and curvy roads? Hell yeah! This is one of the few places I'd want a big truck though-- my subaru kept on bottoming out on the dirt road down into it, which has been eroded away by all of the rain recently)  Larry Hovey (one of the nicest guys you'll meet) has taken charge of fixing up the upper range, where you can shoot from 10 yards to 60. Once they're finished it'll be pretty darn nice out there  They also have a bowhunting range, which is hiking through the woods and shooting at 3d targets. It's open year round (unless there's a 3d shoot, in which case it's closed off for safety reasons. Their 3D shoots take place usually on the 2nd Sunday of each month)  They're also trying to get a FITA field inside there.  For the money, it's a great club!  There's also the Hillcountry Bowhunters about 30 minutes north of Austin. I think their 3d shoots are the 4th Sunday of each month, definitely worth checking out as well  There's also Archery Country near Lamar and 183/Research-- it's an indoor range (20 yards) and they cater mostly to compound shooters, but the gang there is really nice. Tommy Gomez, one of the employees there, is actually a sponsored Matthews shooter and has won many national 3D tournaments (and he's really darn good at tuning bows/hooking you up with arrows). Every Tuesday night around 6:00 there's a traditional league that shoots there (at paper animal targets) and it's a great way to meet other local archers (I believe Thursday evenings is for their compound league)  For traditional shooting, 290 Pawn and Archery (on 290, west of the city past 360) is actually fairly decent. It's a weird concept but the guy who runs the archery department is fairly good at offering some solid advice. They also carry more traditional equipment than Cabellas and Archery Country and they also sell Bob Sarrels bows (darn nice bows from a local bowyer)  The best coach in the area would be Bubba Bateman, about 2 hours south in Canyon Lake. He's an international champion barebow shooter and charges $10 for 2 hours of lessons and I'd highly recommend getting taking some lessons from him  Let me know if you need any links/contacts for these people and I'll see if I can hook you up"

Archery,3dnqgy,CrocodileDilemma,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:09:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with what has been said about releases. But my release was $60 for a wrist release.

It seems that past $100, you'll be seeing the mechanical 2-3&4 finger releases, not the traditional wrist release.   Also, I wouldn't get a whisker biscuit rest as many people I know have had them break down over time, then their shots were drastically different from when they first sighted in their bow. Drop away rests can be full capture so they're ""beginner friendly"". Not trying to force you into anything, but my rest since the beginning has been a Trophy Ridge Revolution 2.0. Brand new they run ~$60 (so it's not much more than the rest you have quoted) and they come with a couple different colored pieces so you can choose your favorite (I dunno, it's a pro for some people).

Archery,3dmp6o,TommyTheCat89,2,Fri Jul 17 15:41:46 2015 UTC,I have been lifting wait for a couple months with the idea of improving the muscles needed for archery. I also want to hunt with the bow in the near future just small game to start. So I would much prefer not buying another limb.
Archery,3dmp6o,Prototype958,3,Fri Jul 17 15:46:46 2015 UTC,I'd say that's a fine plan. But I don't know shit.
Archery,3dmp6o,Memoriae,2,Fri Jul 17 16:10:01 2015 UTC,"As someone who bought a 50# Sage for their first bow, it's a BITCH. I understand the desire to only have to buy one bow to hunt with later, but you need to be really dedicated and practice daily without getting frustrated. It's going to take a long time to get used to that weight, let alone get good with it.   It's possible, just really god damn annoying some times. In the summer heat I can really only shoot in my yard for about an hour before I'm completely exhausted and I've been shooting regularly for about 5-6 months now (since the snow finally melted around here)"
Archery,3dmp6o,Prototype958,2,Fri Jul 17 18:20:23 2015 UTC,"You also need to remember that the Sage, by a lot of very well informed reports, stacks like a bastard when you go over 27in draws. If you've a longer draw, then you're going to be feeling that ramp up in draw weight a lot more than someone with a short draw"
Archery,3dmp6o,W00KIIE,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:41:10 2015 UTC,"Yea, I don't know much about the math/physics behind stacking, but when I was getting it checked out to make sure I had been sold the correct arrows, it weighed in at about 56#s at my draw length, so I'm only a little over.   I wasn't aware the Sage stacked so drastically, what would make it worse than other comparable bows? Is it materials? Construction method? Poor quality?"
Archery,3dmp6o,CptBrandon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:33:41 2015 UTC,"what would make it worse than other comparable bows?   Someone at my club has a set of wood core Hoyt limbs that were shelved for quite some time. They're only 36 pound limbs, but when I draw them I stack to 42 pounds, and I am only drawing 29.5""-30"".   I suspect it is due to a harder wood core than others. In the instance above, I suspect that the wood had actually hardened over time due to the lack of use."
Archery,3dmp6o,AricSmart,4,Tue Jul 21 08:16:33 2015 UTC,Unless you lift weights regularly. In which case. Worked out great for me! No pun intended.

Archery,3dnyz6,Archer_Maverick,8,Fri Jul 17 20:39:26 2015 UTC,"It's certainly possible but you're limited in a few areas:   No clicker bushing means you'll have to use a sight mounted model Single plunger hole limits you to stick-on rests No upper/lower stabilizer bushings Main stab bushing being set into wood may break free if you torque your V-Bar too much (IIRC they are glued in)   With this in mind, I shoot with several people that have fitted a Sage or Polaris for Olympic Style. Here are my personal recommendations:  Clicker: SF mag. Unfortunately these cost 2x - 3x as much as normal clickers.  Sight: Cartel Medalist. I bought one of these years ago and still use it. I did replace the mounting screws with better quality ones, however.  Stabs: Crown Set. These are basically the bee's knees. For the price of a decent longrod you can have a complete set! They are by Decut but are still of very good quality. They even come with dampers.  Plunger: Shibuya DX. There are cheaper options, but unless you upgrade to a Beiter one day, you'll never have to replace it. I run one of these with a Hoyt Super rest.  I'd also keep an eye on the ArcheryTalk Classifieds as entry-level FITA bows pop up quite often as people upgrade."
Archery,3dnyz6,Cylosis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:31:08 2015 UTC,Wow this is a impressive response. So much great info. Thank you! So far it seems stabilizer and sight is all I can do. I do have a metal spring type arrow rest. But I'll definitely look over all these links!
Archery,3dnyz6,yugami,3,Sat Jul 18 03:06:37 2015 UTC,"You CAN, they have all the right bushings.  However they're not cut far enough past center to make good use of a plunger.  Which makes tuning a nightmare, which, etc etc.  Theres really very little to no difference in good shooting form between the different ""styles"" of recurve.  Hell theres very little in the form between recurve and compound.  So just shoot and get your gear together slowly.  The $150 range in ILF risers shoot remarkably well.  THe SF Fiber/Foam limbs are really good as well.  I used both and hunting arrows to win a few (larger)competitions against people with $2500 dollar recurve setups.   People put WAY to much emphasis on equipment and brands.  Most of those people don't put up scores that could detect the differences."
Archery,3dnyz6,cantbelieveitsbacon,2,Fri Jul 17 21:23:14 2015 UTC,"What he said. Plus get something that fits your size (I'm guessing frome xperience that with a 30.5"" draw you're somewhere around 6'4"" tall)."

Archery,3dnyz6,JasonVII,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:29:55 2015 UTC,I really don't care about brands at this point. I bought my bow for hunting with but would love to make my way past the 50 meters and shoot at the skill to hit 8 and 9's at 70 meters strictly as a target shooter. I'm from Toronto and will check that site out. I've had trouble finding used gear for some reason.
Archery,3dnyz6,Fensus,2,Sat Jul 18 03:01:57 2015 UTC,"You are currently shooting a 62 inch bow at a 30.5 inch draw. You need a longer bow. 70 inch would be appropriate for you.  Longer bows are more accurate which is what matters for olympic style.  With a Sage your accuracy will be limited by the short size of the bow. All your mistakes will be amplified.  The sage is a great bow for what it's intended. Hunters love the 62"" short length when they're up in a tree. But it sounds like you won't be shoting from the top of a tree.  You can pick up a SF prostyle riser for $70 and prostyle limbs for $50, that's $120 which is less than a new Sage. For $40 more you can even get into ILF territory. You can also save by going used."
Archery,3dnyz6,Fensus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:22:33 2015 UTC,I actually do plan on hunting with it.  I bought it for this reason as I don't like using my dads old crossbow. Olympic shooting just seems to be appealing so much toe recently and I want to get into it.  Where would I be able to get those deals on ilf stuff? I'm in Toronto but I don't mind buying online with enough research.
Archery,3dnyz6,Prototype958,2,Sat Jul 18 03:11:12 2015 UTC,"A proper shot should be held for 3-5 seconds at most....  On a note of the bow, all you need is a sight to shoot olympic style. Just get the entry level stuff, borrow other peoples at your local club and learn how the difference"
Archery,3dnyz6,yugami,2,Fri Jul 17 22:32:39 2015 UTC,"Yah, I don't have any input to add to the topic at hand. But I was wondering why you're at full draw for anywhere near 45 seconds?"
Archery,3dnyz6,JasonVII,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:54:42 2015 UTC,Gradually been building up my strength by holding my shots longer and longer. I know that after about 10-15 seconds I get more and more inaccurate but I'm hoping that by doing so I will become more stable during my shooting.
Archery,3dnyz6,Frankenarcher,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:16:23 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I was more curious than critical... Thanks for the explanation!"
Archery,3dnyz6,Frankenarcher,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:27:57 2015 UTC,This is the only way I was able to even full draw my bow when I first got it. Sat in my room and held as much of a draw as I could manage for as long as I could until I was able to hold steady a full draw for 30 seconds. Wouldn't even start shooting until I was able to do this.

Archery,3djp5j,Cylosis,2,Thu Jul 16 23:33:42 2015 UTC,"Yea where I work, that is the only glove we sell too. Those calf hair gloves are pretty good all in all...they just wear off the hair pretty quick but shoot great, even after the hair is gone. I just hate the close finger tip design. Much prefer the old open tip/ single seam. I can feel my finger tip placement to the bone of my anchor so much better.   Oddly enough I shoot without a glove often at the shop, I usually don't have a bunch of time to dawn all that armor then had to remove it to work with a customer.

Archery,3djh87,Black_mage_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:11:48 2015 UTC,It is interesting that they shoot aluminiums over cabons. Fat boys are more expensive but aren't as straight
Archery,3djh87,mediweevil,2,Thu Jul 16 20:16:20 2015 UTC,"Fat Boys are only 8.8mm diameter - most competition shooters want max legal diameter which is 9.3mm.  it took Easton years to actually make a max legal carbon shaft (the Triumph) as opposed to repurposing something already on the market.  indoor arrows need to be reasonably straight, but when you're punching holes in paper at 18 metres, things like wind drift cease to be an issue, so there's no need to pay a fortune for the engineering and manufacturing processes designed to make the ultimate outdoors shaft.  aluminium is also a very consistent material - apart from maintaining diameter and wall thickness considerations, you do want arrows where the material itself has the same properties, which is measured using Young's coefficient of elasticity.  this will affect spine from batch to batch.  carbon is hard to get consistent in this regard as every batch is unique, and then you've got the further complication of each batch of resin used to form the matrix the carbon sits in.  the upshot is a lot more ""tweaking"" to make a manufacturing run, and then a lot of grading afterwards to sort into different sets.  if you put on your commercial bullshit filter. there's some more info on the subject here: http://www.eastonarchery.com/blog/easton-weight-codes-sorting-out-the-mystery  personally I have given up shooting X7 2315s because they tend to develop bends over time, and X23s are the same arrow with a new set of graphics.  they're quite cheap, and you can buy them by the piece, but you do need to change them out regularly.  I have gone to Carbon Triumphs, particularly as Easton actually make a reasonably priced 200gn point for them, and I don't need to pay a bomb for Propoints.  the other alternative is Carbon Express X-Busters, or CXLs."

Archery,3djh87,mediweevil,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:15:06 2015 UTC,"they are also max legal size, which Fatboys are not.  it didn't stop Sergio winning Nimes with them, but every little bit counts, and when you're paying 4x as much for a product that doesn't do any better - why?"
Archery,3djh87,LAborn_TXraised,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:25:39 2015 UTC,"Notice that they both shoot the Easton XX75 Easton X23 aluminum shafts. Bare shaft costs $4.59 $9 a piece!   The moral of this story is... there are fancy, heavily marketed arrows and there are good arrows. But they are not always the same.  Aluminum arrow tubes have been around for over 30 years. Their manufacturing is now as good as it gets. They can be made for $4 with straightness ± .001"" and weight tolerance: ± 0.75%.  Very few carbon arrows can achieve this level of quality and certainly not at this price."

Archery,3dk4an,Iwanttolearnarchery,2,Thu Jul 16 22:31:14 2015 UTC,"I also just starting with archery, went to my first class a couple days ago. I was going to buy a bow right away but changed my mind after talking with the instructor. Basically he said it is better to practice a month or two, set up technique, gain strength (archery requires muscles that are not usually trained) and then figure out what poundage is suitable for me and buy a bow.  To my understanding, it is better to buy an ILF compatible riser, so it is easier to get replacement limbs. Neither of the bows you have chosen is ILF.  Also people say it is better to buy from archery stores as general stores often sell crappy bows. It seems like you are interested in hunting, maybe you will be better off with a compound bow. Check out nusensei channel on youtube, he has some interesting videos (i think he is on reddit also)."
Archery,3dk4an,triacontahedron,2,Fri Jul 17 06:54:30 2015 UTC,"Most people would still recommend starting around the 28# as it can be surprising how much it can fatigue you. If you find the clubs ones easy to pull them ask what they are and and what they would recommend.  As its your first bow, go into a shop and get it, the advice you can get is in valuable. As far as what ones to go to a pro shop. (UK the big ones are, merlin/wales archery/clickers/quicks/bowsports)  As far as that bow goes, Personally I wouldn't. Its not a ILF (or even HLF) bow. For about £20-30 more you could get an ILF bow from a shop have them set it up for you and try out loads of limbs to get the right poundage. Also with the ILF, if you decide in a few months that you've grown and find it too easy, then you only have to replace the limbs, not the whole bow."
Archery,3dk4an,Black_mage_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:24:08 2015 UTC,40# bow is WAY too strong for a beginner. Its a lot easier to get good form with lighter (bellow 25#) bow. Once you get the form down it will also be easier to train the correct muscles needed for heavier bows.   Training strength is easy compared to forgetting bad form habits.

Archery,3ddlnf,KnightOfAshes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:50:36 2015 UTC,Yea it's the only part of this drawing technically off. I always figured Hawkeye carried a sidearm so...a quiver a top it would be impractical. I think the addition of the hip quiver was solely for aesthetic.

Archery,3ddlnf,epwnym,-1,Wed Jul 15 15:35:07 2015 UTC,"There is not one way to fire a bow correctly. Archery originated independent in many different regions of the world. Look at videos of tribes shooting, they all shoot different, but they are not 'wrong'. They don't shoot targets they shoot to survive and if their style is good enough to eat then it is 'correct.' People in this sub are way too fixated on the appropriate Olympic form. Yes it may be the point when the body is most aligned and symmetric from a biophysical perspective and perhaps even some of the best archers to ever live use this technique but that doesn't mean we must judge every image of an archer on this standard."

Archery,3deik7,Rea_Pin_Yu,3,Wed Jul 15 17:24:48 2015 UTC,See if you can find a archery shop that is local to you. There are so many choices from so many manufacturers that it really helps to handle everything.
Archery,3deik7,SHGOATG,3,Wed Jul 15 17:34:04 2015 UTC,"Try in store for sure, unless you are happy with one that has a large draw length and poundage range.  The most important things that you should to try out, and a few of them, are the bow itself (duh). You have a lot of options, the leaders are Hoyt (by a long margin) and Mathews, but don't count of the other brands like prime/elite/bow tech. You now have to look at what kind of bow you want, personally i would try to avoid parallel limbs. Try in store and try a lot. Have a look online at the bows in shops and then look at http://compoundbowchoice.com/ to get an idea on peoples opinion on the bow. Before you go to shop, set a budget and stick to it!   The second thing to try for sure in store is the release aid. If only target shooting then try with Thumb ones, and if hunting index finger releases (this isn't like the only way to do it, but its what most people do) Try with trigger based ones first (especially if outdoors) as it gives you full control of shot. If you are shooting indoors only for a bit then some would recommend going back tension to get a good form and then go trigger.  Price wise you're looking at about £500 all in.  edit: contradiction was pissing me off."

Archery,3ddtag,vs-throws,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:43:18 2015 UTC,"If the spine is right then stick with that. Wasn't sure what the plats came in off the top of my head.  2 or 3"", either would work fine with that size shaft.

Archery,3ddtag,mediweevil,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:13:15 2015 UTC,I hadn't considered feathers before but I'll definitely have another look. Thanks.
Archery,3ddtag,Zonpakuto,3,Wed Jul 15 16:26:22 2015 UTC,"feathers are romantic, but unless you're shooting off the shelf and need them, stick to vanes.  they produce the same results, are a lot cheaper, and a lot tougher.  I second the advice above about looking at Platinums for alloys, but I suggest using inserts and screw in field points instead of the nibbs.  it makes changing a damaged point a very easy exercise.  the other choice you have now is to go to a carbon shaft like the Apollo.  it's only $15 difference for a dozen at Lancaster prices.  I do suggest getting the ACE stainless points though, the zinc ones are a bit light.  stick with 2-2.5"" vanes and your g nocks.  .840 is closest to your spine, but maybe go with .740 if you're going to go up in draw weight soon."
Archery,3ddtag,mediweevil,0,Wed Jul 15 21:19:59 2015 UTC,Feathers are best for indoor shooting regardless of the fact if you're shooting off the shelf or rest. They're more forgiving of slight variances in form from shot to shot. Also a bow that's not tuned all the way would appreciate feathers over vanes.
Archery,3ddtag,hatefist,2,Thu Jul 16 02:22:48 2015 UTC,"sorry, but I totally disagree.  feathers are not ""forgiving"", other than if you've got a bad tune they will collapse a little rather than deflect the shaft.  all that does is disguise the problem, not fix it - and when those feathers start to chew up due to the contact, you've now got a second problem.  have a look at the shooting line of any major competition and see who's shooting feathers.  if you find someone you're doing well, and those archers would be using them if they offered any sort of advantage.  vanes are lighter, tougher, cheaper.  they're not as ""nice"" but I prefer performance."
Archery,3ddtag,mediweevil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:14:12 2015 UTC,what are those crinkly foil-ly twisty vanes called (apologies -- trad guy here)? Seems to be the ticket for indoor olympic shooters on a pencil thin shaft
Archery,3ddtag,Zonpakuto,2,Fri Jul 17 18:16:41 2015 UTC,"often called spin wings, which is the original make - other companies now make them as kurly vanes and XS wings too.  they're actually thin mylar plastic, although some (like the kurlies) have a metallic finish which makes them look like a foil.  very light and low drag, but tend to be a bit fragile.  easily repaired by hand though, so very convenient at a shoot."
Archery,3ddtag,cantbelieveitsbacon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:31:01 2015 UTC,"Larger vanes/feathers will correct the arrow quicker allowing for a straighter flight faster. The downside is larger vanes/feathers have a bigger air surface so increased drag reduces velocity down range. If you're shooting indorlor at 18m this is negligible and 4"" vanes/feathers are great.   Also I'd go with feathers over vanes for indoor shooting. Feathers are more forgiving a slight variances in form from shot to shot.  The X7 Eclipse is a great arrow that shoots great and I'd stick with those. If you must choose between a stiffer and softer spine it's usually best to go slightly stiffer, as there is more tuning you can do to make a stiffer arrow fly well over a softer arrow.   Also I would probably invest in bow scale to measure your exact draw weight just to be precise. I have a 29.5"" draw, my limbs are 34#@28"". The general rule being 2.5# per extra inch I should be drawing close to 36.5# maybe 38 with my tiller all the way in but I'm actually pulling 40# with my tiller all the way out. Its just the safest way to make sure you're getting the exact spine you need."
Archery,3ddtag,cantbelieveitsbacon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:13:53 2015 UTC,1814 is too stiff for your draw weight/length. Get them in 1616 spine instead. Easton's chart is always on the stiff side.  Also take a look at the Easton XX75. They are cheaper than X7 and a tad lighter for the same spine. The only real benefit of X7 over XX75 was for real advanced looking for better consistency over long distances. But this is irrelevant today as outddor shooting is done with carbon arrows. XX75 are very good arrows.  Excellent choice on the vanes I might add.

Archery,3dazjl,nusensei,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:42:06 2015 UTC,"Well, you can easily tell if it's consistent. Just put up a new target face every, say, 15 or 30 arrows, depending on if you're shooting a single spot or a three-spot or whatever. Then, after you have a couple of them saved up, compare them all. See if your grouping is consistently in the same place and the same size on each target. Obviously, you do this without moving your sight or trying to compensate for it or anything like that. If you have the exact same grouping on every target then you know for sure that you can fix the problem just by adjusting your sight. If your groupings are always off high and to the right but by differing amounts, then the problem is probably partially your sight, but then there's something else you're doing, too. Maybe you're torquing the bow and so you need to pay attention to your bowhand grip, for example."
Archery,3dazjl,ADDeviant,5,Wed Jul 15 02:56:54 2015 UTC,Your arrow spine might not be matched to your actual draw weight.
Archery,3dazjl,yugami,2,Tue Jul 14 22:55:32 2015 UTC,"Possibly this, if it can't be solved by adjusting the sight.  If you are shooting a group high right, and adjust the sight a little, the group should move a little, even if you are still shooting high right.   If it doesn't move at all, have a look at the arrow issues OR maybe something messing with your sight picture, like a distraction, or an accessory that is not adjusted to another accessory.  I can't explain it better than that, sorry, but an example: compound shooting friend used to have both a string peep and a kisser button on his string.  Well, they were too far apart, so he had to tilt his head trying to see through his peep, and that put the kisser in medial just a bit, but he was jerking his head back to straight or he would hit his lip on release, and torqueing his bow right every shot."

He knocked an arrow, and put the bow at his foot and looked down. The arrow was off center by 5 degrees. Holy crap. No matter your form, that's gonna send it off target.  My rest was a bit high and 'in'. Once that was fixed, things changed. Once I learned to brace my bow arm better, my targets moved to center.

So I hopped over to the nearest dealership and got a touchup pen for $15 and it glossed over the nicks almost perfectly. I don't know what finish your bow has, but it might be worth your time to take a closeup shot of your bow's paint and stop by a few dealers to compare to cars on the lot."
Archery,3d7rar,zenautodetailing,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:59:29 2015 UTC,Thank you so much. Mines a red Spigarelli barebow. How did you find out your bow was nearly identical to Nissan's Pearl white? Did you just look at some color schemes?  Not sure what kind of finish I have anyways. I think it is powder coated?
Archery,3d7iia,Ketos_Troias,2,Tue Jul 14 03:06:23 2015 UTC,"Arrows from a surprisingly weak bow will go through a surprising range and amount of stuff.  You definitely needd a better backstop.  Rubber blunts are available from about any archery supplier.  The big traditional/ barebow suppliers online are folks like Three Rivers Archery.  I own (way) over a dozen bows, and still have a couple of old solid fiberglass bows with straight handles running from 25 to 45 lbs.  They are fine to shoot. If that's what you have, you will enjoy it.  But, the limbs are physically heavy and they are not known to be ""sweet"" shooters, as far as hand shock goes, or smoothness of draw.  But they really aren't, like terrible, either.  Shoot whatever shaft material you prefer, and fletch with feathers."
Archery,3d7iia,ADDeviant,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:05:37 2015 UTC,"So even with a rubber blunt, it could still cause some damage? I guess worst case scenario is I have to build something out of wood to stop stray arrows.  Thanks for the help, by the way :)"
Archery,3d7iia,ADDeviant,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:12:00 2015 UTC,"Even with a rubber blunt you would shoot through LAYERS of wallboard.  Get something like two layers of tough outdoor carpet, and hang it floor to ceiling in front of the wall about 12"" away, like a curtsin.  The loose carpet absorbs the impact.  You still want some plywood or something  behind it."
Archery,3d7iia,hatefist,2,Tue Jul 14 07:46:45 2015 UTC,"For arrows, google ""arrow spine chart"". This will give you a ballpark area of what kind of arrow you need. Spine refers to the stiffness of the arrow and it's ability to get around your riser when being shot out of a bow. It's less important in cut-past-center bows but if you found a garage sale bow, this will be important  Measuring arm-length is one way to do it, but I suggest getting a little extra out of the arrow as too-long is not the worst, but too-short would be useless.   Rubber tipped arrows will still go through drywall. Drywall is super stiff, and arrows have too much mass being pushed at one central point. Rubber points and blunts are meant to ""push"" things that have a lot of give (bunnies, squirrels, birds), instead of shooting through them. Imagine: you can punch a hole through drywall, but you can't punch a hole through a small animal.   As for barebow, I say go for it. It'll be much more fun IMO"

Archery,3d4duu,nusensei,11,Mon Jul 13 12:48:40 2015 UTC,"In commemoration of 40 years of Vietnamese settlement in Australia, I have crafted this string. It is a 16-strand 8125G string, with 12 yellow and 4 red, to recreate the pattern of the flag of South Vietnam. This flag is used by Vietnamese refugee communities around the world, and some athletes of Vietnamese heritage, such as MMA fighter Cung Le, use this colour scheme to honour their history.  The string has gold/black serving and, as another tribute to the flag, has three red nocking points.  Vietnamese refugees and their descendants have formed strong communities in many countries around the world, including Australia, New Zealand, America, Canada, the Netherlands, Germany, Malaysia and the Philippines. Many children of refugee parents face enormous pressure to succeed in academics and establish careers that their parents could never get.  However, few Vietnamese have found pathways into sports, and the Vietnamese community - and many other migrant backgrounds - are under-represented in many sporting fields.  Sport is a great unifier and there is something for everyone, from competitive team sports to introspective individual pursuits, such as archery. As one of the very few Vietnamese archers in Australia - if not the world - my string stands as a unique identifier of my past, present and future.  I will be making another string as part of a special video reflecting on my experience as a second-generation immigrant.  I have an important question: would anyone be interested in buying these strings?"
Archery,3d4duu,Northernbowyer,2,Mon Jul 13 12:49:48 2015 UTC,"First off awesome string and congrats on getting it to come out so nicely, mine always have a twist in the stripes.  But depending on location and discipline that may not be legal to shoot.  Some non sighted disciplines do not allow any sting marks except two knocking points nor serving that can protrude in to the eyeline of the archer as it could also be used for sighting.  For Olympic recurve you are safe though but if you are planning on selling them then I thought I would let you know just incase its an issue.  Also personally I wouldn't buy strings but that is only because I make my own."
Archery,3d4duu,mediweevil,3,Mon Jul 13 15:44:25 2015 UTC,"mine always have a twist in the stripes.   getting perfect colour separation is a bit of an art form.  it's easy enough to separate the colour layers with tape or slide an arrow through the string bundles, but what causes the hassles is the bundle twist-up when you serve the loops.  when you turn the yoke to close the loop and do the end serving, the twist-up causes both sides of the string to twist in opposite directions and ruins your nice candy cane look.  I've experimented with putting a couple of short lengths of arrow shaft offcut diagonally on the inside of the yoke posts which helps prevent twist-up if you keep them very close to the serving, but you have to keep moving them along as the jig moves.  if you've got access to a tensioning jig then it becomes pretty much a non-problem as the tension stops the twist-up creeping in in the first place.  in the absence of a tension jig, the best free solution is to make sure you have thoroughly untwisted the end loop section between the yoke posts before turning the yoke, so you introduce minimal reverse twist in the first place.  you can then use an arrow between the colour layers to ""pack"" any unwanted twisting down towards the loop and serve over it, so you're only left with cleanly separated colours visible.  when you do the second end serving, separate the colour layers all the way from the end you have done down to your second loop, or you can yet the colours reversing at one end.  finally, it helps to dewax each colour lightly by burnishing with a piece of excess string or soft rope (I use light nylon rope) to form the bundles up and keep all the coloured strands together, then twist and give everything a good burnish together to set the bundle."
Archery,3d4duu,mediweevil,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:45:54 2015 UTC,This is true. The nocking points look gimmicky and I do think the conventional nock set looks more appropriate for regular use.

It's like every shot that connects is a bullseye, and every shot misses doesn't matter because the leaf is so small.

Archery,3d28ay,florinandrei,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:57:54 2015 UTC,How does the stump shooting work? I've missed my target a few times and hit the oak behind it and the arrows need to be dug out with a knife. One went deep enough I just had to unscrew it and leave the field point.
Archery,3d28ay,ErosRaptor,2,Mon Jul 13 19:54:56 2015 UTC,"Blunt points and rotten stumps are preferred, as are very strong arrows.  Also, ""stump shooting"" means more than stumps.  Look for any target that catches your eye but has a backstop: a pale twig, a leaf catching the light, a sunflower or dandelion head.   With your field points being screw in, try finding some pistol bullet casings that will slip over your points, like .357 mag or .38 special.  Cut them short if you need to, and stuff the head down in the casing with some hot glue or epoxy."
Archery,3d4gkp,Ishan451,5,Mon Jul 13 13:16:17 2015 UTC,The Forged+ with cheap limbs is a safe starting point. It's a good bow for a beginner.
Archery,3d4gkp,nusensei,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:12:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Love your Videos. Wish you'd do bow reviews :) There are so very few out there, i mean more or less professional ones. And you seem to know what you are talking about (or at least researched it very well).  That being said... what i was wondering, is there a big difference between the 23 inch and 25inch riser or are they pretty much the same? I know i should go, based on my height (173cm) for an 68inch bow, overall... for the best results.  Do you have any experience with that, by any chance? I mean if there is a big difference between the two risers."
Archery,3d4gkp,nusensei,2,Mon Jul 13 22:27:30 2015 UTC,"Your height would be suited for a 68"" bow - which means either 25"" riser with medium limbs (most common and easily available combination), or 23"" with long limbs. Using the short/long combination results in a gentler draw but less ""punch"". It's generally advisable for beginners to go with medium/medium."
Archery,3d4gkp,Daniel123654,4,Tue Jul 14 01:55:29 2015 UTC,"I have a Forged+, its a great starting riser and I see them all the time at local competitions. As for the weight, I shoot 30# Limbs and at full draw they work out at 42#.   I wouldn't recommend going over 30# for your first bow (I shot club bows from 22#-28# before I got my own) but it does depend on your physical strength. As /u/sitspit said, if you do go too high then you can just get some weaker ones and work your way up"
Archery,3d4gkp,Daniel123654,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:44:41 2015 UTC,I thought the draw weight of the limb was set as standard for a 28 inch draw length on a 25inch riser and medium sized limbs? Is your draw length longer or will i have to expect a higher poundage?
Archery,3d4gkp,nusensei,3,Mon Jul 13 22:24:41 2015 UTC,"My draw is 32"", I think the general rule is 2# per inch. Some cheaper limbs can encounter stacking though, which means the weight increases rapidly after a certain point"
Archery,3d4gkp,Chrisisawesome69,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:28:39 2015 UTC,"All limbs will stack. The advantage of higher-end limbs is that the draw curve is more linear up until a point, meaning there is less variation in speed."

Archery,3d4gkp,ajh499,3,Tue Jul 14 00:59:34 2015 UTC,"You can't go wrong with the forged+, I've just got one after considering a couple of risers that cost twice the price, and I think it's fantastic value for money and really well made.   As others on here have said, get a cheap set of light limbs to begin with. Getting them from eBay is always an option as there are plenty of people doing the same as you, so there's loads of kit going around. And you'll probably upgrade after 6 months anyway. The riser will give you a good amount of adjustment for poundage too.  Don't forget that any more than a few pound increase in draw weight will mean new arrows too as the old ones will then be too weak.   I wouldn't worry too much about having a poundage that you want to pull, there's no point unless you're trying to kill something! It's just wasted effort for target shooting.   I shoot with 35.5lbs on my fingers (from 34lb limbs) and I can comfortably reach 100yds."
Archery,3d4gkp,Figure15,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:20:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i'll keep that in mind, the arrows i mean. But it is my understanding that i shouldn't worry to much about the arrows for now, as long as they aren't to light.  Naturally, i am aware that ideally eventually you'll want to have arrows that are perfectly fitted to your bow for the best possible results, but as i learned its quite common to break a lot of arrows as newbie, or at least that seemed to be the consensus on the internet.  My first hurdle will be hitting the target. I can start worrying about grouping once i am no longer missing the target itself. And thats when i'll probably start getting proper, perfectly adjusted arrows."
Archery,3d4gkp,W00KIIE,2,Mon Jul 13 22:22:03 2015 UTC,"The arrows make all the difference, more so than the riser, in my opinion.   What do you intend on shooting at and what are you going to use as a backstop? I wouldn't expect a beginner to break that many arrows, you'll just be shooting at a bigger closer target to start with.  If the arrows are not close to the correct spine for your setup, they'll group badly as they'll fly horribly and there's a chance that they'll be making contact with the bow on release too. That will just lead to frustration and you might end up feeling like you're not improving.  It's not necessarily too big a deal, unless you want to make big changes to the poundage you're pulling. Aluminium arrows are cheap, easy to straighten if they get bent and a bit more forgiving of incorrect poundage than some of the higher performance arrows that you might want later. I doubt you'll get more than 5-6lbs of increase in poundage out of a set of arrows before they become too weak though"
Archery,3d4gkp,SpideyAB,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:49:41 2015 UTC,"I have build myself a target using a large jute bag filled with cardboard strips. I have a big paper cutter with a large blade, so cutting the cardboard packaging i get from groceries and such. It should make a nice target.  For a backstop i am having an extra thick tarp, which i'll be hanging double. It certainly wouldn't be enough if i would shoot above 50pounds, but since i am planning to start with mere 30 it should stop the arrows just fine. If it doesn't i'll have to consider something else, because right behind it will be my yew tree and a stone wall of the shed.  I am aware of the importance of spine as well as the grain per pound. I am just not going to match it perfectly just yet. As long as its in the target area, no need to fuss about the perfect arrow when i am still a beginner. I find it hard to believe that some native american or something like that broke out his scale each time they fletched a new arrow for their bow. So i am fairly certain there is some leeway in that whole formula... I am fully aware that its not perfect. Baby steps :) First i am going to learn to walk, before i plan to run the 100m in under 10s."
Archery,3d4gkp,SpideyAB,3,Tue Jul 14 17:54:21 2015 UTC,"I have a forged+, its a good starting riser. My main problem with it is the limb pocket is just that tiny bit too narrow. What happens is the corners of your limbs will get chewed up if you  try to tighten the limb bolts all the way for more poundage.  What irks me is its happening on SF limbs. So much for manufacturer testing their own stuff. Either the limbs are slightly non spec or the riser is."
Archery,3d4gkp,Trickarrows,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:27:25 2015 UTC,"It's a riser issue. Everyone who sees the Forged+ that I've spoken to initially thinks that the limbs are out of the pockets, but due to the riser having huge tapering on the limb pocket and them being quite shallow you almost have to have them wound out so that your limbs don't sit in the pocket itself.  It's a bit unnerving."
Archery,3d4gkp,eyefullawgic,3,Tue Jul 21 08:43:37 2015 UTC,"I'm about 6 weeks into recurve and I use a Forged+ Riser with Axiom+ limbs shooting barebow and I love it. The riser comes with an arrow rest and a plunger so that's nice. Keep in mind on the limbs, they're measured for a 28 inch draw so you gain or lose 2# per inch of draw. So with my 30"" draw and 36# limbs, I shoot a 40# bow.  But yeah I'd definitely recommend the setup. I love it. You can check in my submitted for my form check video to see what it looks like (Heads up: it's huge)  Finally, I'd definitely encourage finding a community. I personally live a while away from my closest range so I come here for community to keep me committed. /r/archery is full of experience for things like bow purchasing and form checks, and encouragement for your progress. Also, /u/TrickArrows posts cool pictures to remind us why we shoot: because it's cool.   So yeah I'd say do a little more research and make sure you're interested in Olympic Archery rather than say compound or hunting recurve, but hang around. Also you can check out /u/Nunsei 's YouTube account (same account name) for all of your getting started advice"

Probably watched all his videos on archery at least once.  As for the community, we'll see about me going back, and maybe i'll meet some people when i am going Roving, but i can't justify driving there for 2,5 hours and back 2,5 hours just to have a little chat about archery, even if it would be useful. I can justify that time expenditure maybe once a month... maybe. Its basically a whole day trip and not just some 2 hour ""i'll go to club for a bit"" thing.  I am having an about 28 inch draw length. I measured it via touching my fingers in front of my chest as well as having my wife take the measurement from my extended arms."
Archery,3d4gkp,AricSmart,2,Mon Jul 13 22:15:45 2015 UTC,"Well then you can order based on the exact poundage you want. But yeah if you're just shooting, you get bored eventually. Checking back here makes me want to keep at it"

Check out the Gillo G2, due out in a month or two, which has options for barebow weights (to help balance the bow without stabilizers) and costs about the same as the Forged+. If you want something shorter for hunting, the Hoyt Excel is recommended as a fairly cheap starter as well.  Disclaimer: I shoot a Forged+ olympic style currently, but if I was buying again from scratch in that price range, would probably go with a Gillo G2 because it appears to be a far more versatile riser."

Archery,3d2j7r,Carrotted,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:55:14 2015 UTC,"It's a cheaper camping-level, all-fiberglass bow; can't tell from the picture, but it could be a Fred Bear Red Bear. Worth about $50 or less if you sold it.  Compared to a wood/fiberglass recurve, an all-fiberglass one will be less efficient at casting the arrow; you may have to cant it (I.e. tilt it, gangsta-style) to keep the arrow on the how when drawing, as there's no arrow rest.  Use any arrows. I wouldn't stress too much over spine or arrow material: so long as the arrows are long enough that you can come to full draw with them, buy whatever's cheapest."
Archery,3d306y,MystikIncarnate,2,Mon Jul 13 02:57:55 2015 UTC,I've drawn an older bow (early 90s) with my fingers no problem. The cams are much smaller and the track is a bit deeper and they're comparatively very long. I got a new bow that's 30 inches ata and much faster. The cams are huge and tracks quite shallow. I shoot them both at 55 pounds and the draw cycle on the newer bow has a hell of a hump compared to the old pulley cams. The 80% let off is very nice but if you come too far forward it wants to take right off. I wouldn't even think about drawing it back without a release aid. I'd be really concerned about derailing it or having a misfire trying to shoot it off your fingers.  My thought is if you want to shoot compound but didn't care for the release you used try out a few different ones. Especially ones that use thumb to trigger over the wrist strip finger trigger if you like the feel of shooting fingers.
Archery,3d306y,HuckFonda,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:28:57 2015 UTC,"The Hoyt Alphatec was the first to catch my eye; I kept on that trend and ended up looking at the Hoyt Contender Elite, and the Hoyt Medalist - both are 39""+ (I forget exactly) late 2000's ish compounds; compared to the alphatec, which is a 1998 bow.  they use similar styles of cams and are similar sizes from the specs and the look of them... 39-45"" if I recall correctly.  So from what you've said, I should keep an eye on the cams mainly, if they're deeper than the just the string, it would be better for finger release, since it should be able to tolerate more of a left/right movement.  The super-small track of modern compound cams would likely be problematic.  That's a fair statement.  I'll have to re-evaluate my picks so far to determine if they fit the bill."
Archery,3d306y,HuckFonda,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:26:00 2015 UTC,If I were you I'd pick up a really old cheap compound to shoot fingers if that's what you want to do.  That way if you derail it you won't be out a ton of money. Never seen one derailed except in a youtube video but that's one of those things I'd never want to experience. I can't imagine having something like that in the back of my mind everytime I drew my bow back.   If you've got your heart set on a newer Hoyt I'd still advise you to shop around and find a release aid you're more comfortable with. You'll shoot much better with one and your chances of derailing are pretty low. If you don't want the finger trigger go for a thumb trigger.

Archery,3d306y,HuckFonda,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:07:30 2015 UTC,Yeah but if you spend 300 on the bow and derail it what will it cost to fix? If you spend 50-100 on an older bow if you derail it you can pitch it and chalk it up as a cheap lesson learned. My .02 anyways.
Archery,3d306y,Cylosis,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:13:08 2015 UTC,Still need to find a decent older bow for ~$100...
Archery,3d306y,Cylosis,2,Mon Jul 13 18:31:04 2015 UTC,Craigslist and garage sales would probably be a good bet. There were tons of old bows on Craigslist in my area for 100 or less when I was looking to buy a new one. My girlfriend really wants one and my mom has texted me at least 4x in the past month with bows she's found at garage sales for 80 bucks or less.

Archery,3d306y,Cylosis,2,Mon Jul 13 18:42:47 2015 UTC,Have you browsed the classifieds on ArcheryTalk? I bought my bow in the FITA section there and it was surprisingly easy.

Archery,3d306y,Memoriae,2,Mon Jul 13 18:43:03 2015 UTC,"Hold up, I think you need to take another look at recurve.  First off, 45lbs is a ton. Draw weight is of far lesser concern for target shooting and if you do indoor it doesn't matter nearly at all. It took me a good 6 months of gradually upping my draw weight from 34lbs before I could handle my new 46lb bow. My rule of thumb is, if you can't hold it at full draw for a full minute, it's too heavy for you. (And even then, 20 ends back-to-back can be strenuous.) Target draw weight is not a pissing contest and it's totally cool to shoot a bow nearer to 30lbs, as long as your consistency is there to back it up. Jumping straight to a draw weight near the legal limit is just begging for terrible form habits such as locking your elbow or collapsing your shoulder. Barebow and trad shooting is a whole different story as they're unlikely to be holding the weight longer than a few seconds.  Also compound off the fingers, while doable, is usually a terrible idea. Because your fingers cannot possibly release the string straight forward, you're far more likely to derail the bow. You also don't get that nice clean angle you get with a D-loop because fingers are fat and you'll need a thick-ass tab to manage the string pinch, even on large axle-to-axle bows. As far as I know, as a Canadian anyway, fingers compound isn't a thing in competition so you'll be no better off.  The Samick Polaris comes in 66"", which is 2"" shorter than what you likely ought to be using but its low price leaves you room for some good arrows/fixings and quality equipment. I used a Polaris for years before I bought my first FITA recurve and they're beyond fantastic. So fantastic, in fact, that I recently bought 30 of them for my club. Does the club you're getting into have its own equipment? If I were you I'd start with a simple T/D and get really damn good with it before trying to upgrade. If you've ever played violin or similar you can say it's very similar to the relationship between the instrument and the player; Itzhak Perlman could make a $500 POS sound incredible, but give a new student an Amati and it still sounds terrible."
Archery,3d306y,vs-throws,2,Mon Jul 13 04:35:24 2015 UTC,"While i agree with most of your post, compound 'limited' is entirely a thing. It is what, for example, the Hoyt Tribute is made for. It is not officially recognised under WA but most national governing bodies (archery GB, etc) recognise it. Also crops up in field associations under various guises."
Archery,3d306y,huisme,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:41:09 2015 UTC,"Huh, TIL. So does it have deeper channels on the cams?"
Archery,3d306y,huisme,2,Mon Jul 13 14:57:10 2015 UTC,"Dont think they are as deep as some of the speed bows but they look quite deep all the way round from the pics on the Hoyt site.  Never really looked at it in any depth. Also see quite a few Oneida shooters using fingers, but you don't have the issue of derailing with that.   Tbf, you probably get more derailments from torquing a high let-off hunting bow at the grip rather than a finger release."

Archery,3d00wx,tcbenkhard,2,Sun Jul 12 09:33:37 2015 UTC,"I had to wait six months to join my club.. maybe you could ask them to let you know if anyone cancels and you could take their spot. I know my club asked me to confirm if I was still interested just before the introductory course started, every now and then there must be someone who bails out that you could replace"
Archery,3d00wx,Muleo,2,Sun Jul 12 10:45:26 2015 UTC,You might look at Amersfoort or Hilversum if they can get you started sooner. After you've done the introduction there you could transfer back to Utrecht.

Archery,3d00wx,notavriend,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:02:10 2015 UTC,I am not familiar with most European law governing archery. Do you not have public ranges of any kind?  Archery and bowhunting is so popular that any county would be crazy not to have a few parks with them.
Archery,3d00wx,RogueNinja64,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:04:38 2015 UTC,"Generally you need to complete a beginners course with a club to register with the countries organising body for insurance purposes before you can shoot freely - but public ranges are not really a thing, no."

Archery,3d00wx,dejaan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:38:07 2015 UTC,"Hugely popular clubs will always have a massive waiting list for their beginners courses, I think ours is about 150 people long for a club of 120 people (those numbers are the right way around too!), and works out to about a year or so.   It might be worth asking them if they have any local commercial providers that they accept a beginners pass from. It'll probably be more expensive, but it might be another way into the club."
