SneakerDeals,3cqmqp,thethrill,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:23:54 2015 UTC,How  would you compare the fitting to the Gel Saga if you have any of those?
SneakerDeals,3cqmqp,resay5,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:02:55 2015 UTC,Wonder why these hit sales.. So many coming at under retail.   Anyone know if there is some flaws to them or just not a popular colorway?
SneakerDeals,3ck63r,sneakdeals,2,Wed Jul 8 15:27:28 2015 UTC,"""Shipping is available only in Canada at this time""  Oh :("
SneakerDeals,3ck63r,goodnames679,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:35:42 2015 UTC,Man...  That's how we feel when we look at NDC or most American retailers :(  either they don't ship here or they charge crazy amounts ($30-50 + import tax)  to ship to us!

SneakerDeals,3aseu8,eyecatcherinc,5,Tue Jun 23 03:20:47 2015 UTC,What does unauthorized version even mean?  Also failed to list size and an asking price.

SneakerDeals,3aseu8,GETMONEYGETPAlD,2,Tue Jun 23 04:53:27 2015 UTC,Fake.
SneakerDeals,3aseu8,partipo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:33:25 2015 UTC,"Unauthorized mean that it's a sneaker that's been made in the same factory that nike, foot looker, champs, etc sneakers are made in. But sold by the same person that makes the sneaker, but has not been given authorization to sale.  I don't know how people can call it fake when it has the same carbon fiber, same patent leather, same mesh, same laces, same damn colors (j11's). I mean WHAT is the difference?! What because Nike isn't getting a cut makes them fake? Please what has Nike ever done for me personally? If you want to believe your getting something different that's good for.. I know better..."

SneakerDeals,3aagai,laptop2share,2,Thu Jun 18 14:45:04 2015 UTC,Nice shoes but I wouldn't really recommend running in them - they are too heavy and clunky.

SneakerDeals,359f7w,thascarecro,3,Fri May 8 05:21:13 2015 UTC,These arent very hyped at all but i've been in love with them since they dropped. Not sure if people think they are ugly or what but im glad i waited. There are a lot of sellers that have these for around $70 but this guy had the best feedback. I copped my pair from this seller.
