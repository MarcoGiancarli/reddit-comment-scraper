Supplements,3e5u6w,iliketoworkhard,2,Wed Jul 22 04:39:32 2015 UTC,"Ephedrine + Caffeine in conjunction is banned in some areas. This is because people who have trouble losing weight tend to be fat people and fat people tend to be a cardiac risk group. They also tend to be desperate and/or ignorant and/or lacking in self-control. People taking excessive doses or excessive doses in combination with other substances have given themselves heart attacks, much in the same way that some dude drinking 5 gallons of coffee would kill himself. Ephedrine (in isolation) can't be marketed as a diet aid in the USA for this reason.  Ephedrine on its own is banned in some countries but not in others, ymmv. It can often be bought over the counter, though there may be restrictions on purchasing it (quantity limits) since it can be used to make meth. Caffeine can also be bought over the counter.   That said, EC is more about appetite control than fat burning. It'll help but it's not going to make a world of difference. Unsurprisingly, the stuff that's effective at burning fat is also pretty dangerous or at least difficult to get a hold of. For most people, EC is fairly good since it helps control appetite in people who lack discipline. Of course, ymmv as with all supplements; some people get really good results from it."

In healthy adults, caffeine's half-life is between 3–7 hours.[6] Nicotine decreases the half-life by 30–50%,[55] while oral contraceptives can double it[55] and pregnancy can raise it to as much as 15 hours during the last trimester.[55] In newborns the half-life can be 80 hours or more, dropping very rapidly with age, possibly to less than the adult value by age 6 months.[55] The antidepressant fluvoxamine (Luvox) reduces the clearance of caffeine by more than 90%, and increases its elimination half-life more than tenfold; from 4.9 hours to 56 hours.[110]"

I don't know for sure, but it could because some people's neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine) becomes depleted quicker while on caffeine simply because they didn't have much neurotransimitter reserves to begin with. Or maybe it's because they've developed a health condition and it's more noticeable when caffeine is exacerbating the symptom by spiking the blood sugar, raising cortisol levels etc. When I was younger, caffeine affected me much more strongly and lasted longer. But nowadays, I crash and feel space-headed faster after drinking coffee. The reason why I think it's got something to do with neurotransimitter reserves/depletion is because after I eat eggs whcih are high in choline, my brain fog from caffeine fades away as well as next day after a good workout, caffeine affects me much stronger than usual."

One thing that is definite is that the amount of sodium in the lox is many times higher than the salmon that is broiled/baked.   What you should concentrate on - from a nutritional point of view - is not ""daily fish oil"" but rather 'daily Omega 3 fatty acid' consumption. The average OTC fish oil supplement will only contain between 25% to 55% Omega 3 (even the so-called 'premium' brands). If using supplements, you ideally want a fish oil supplement that is 1) high in Omega 3 ... eg 80-90%  2) has had its claims regarding contents/purity independently verified... eg.  https://labdoor.com/rankings/fish-oil"

I love to blend it up with unsweetened vanilla almond milk.   Its a bit of a pain in the ass to mix. If you are trying to use a spoon to mix, you are fighting a losing battle. It clumps terribly.

It takes two full scoops of naked to match one scoop of ON's. So that's annoying.   No it isn't. ON gold standard has 24g protein per 32g scoop. Naked Whey has 25g protein per 30g (2 scoops). So Naked whey actually has more protein per serving size than ON. You're just referring to the size of the scooper, right? If so, that shouldn't matter at all. A scoop of ON is 32g, and a scoop of Naked is 15g.

It adds up over time and a single night's good sleep will not do much to fix the deep deprivation. Allergies make it worse at times. The only thing that truly balances out the deep deprivation and it works to balance out the issue is Modnafinil after taking it for 1.5 mths it starts to chip away at the deep stuff.   However Sulbutimine properly dosed and refreshed by taking breaks works better than caffeine (for me) every time.  Sulbutimine 600 mg 1x day in morning.  Works for 3 days then it stops working on 4th(no noticeable consequences), take a day break and it works again. I don't take it unless I have to, but that is often.   I take it with 500mg Tyrosine as I was directed in longecity forum where I learned the 600 mg dose was the active adult dose. I researched and backed that claim up before I tried it.  I have been taking that regimen at work for 3+ years now and it has worked perfectly every time (kindof an 8 hr energy drink effect with no side effects). Works better than caffeine and you can sleep with it, it helps with daytime wakefulness as good as Provigil can get.   I take Adderal xr, Provigil, and Sulbutimine just to get through the day sometimes.  The doctors claims they can do no more surgery and I can't tolerate a cpap, though I wish I could (reverse air pressure cause me to choke ~3-3.5 hours into sleep)   Occasionally I will have to add caffeine. I found that Focus XT (I but it on amazon) works great. I think the Huperzine -A from it helps me the best even though it has caffeine in it (be very careful not to overdose on caffeine) i never take this with energy drinks or caffeine since I had a bad reaction a couple of times.  Huperzine -A (I will take 1x100 mg/daily or 1 scoop of Focus Xt) or Galantamine (4mg only/day) and helps with keeping Actylcholine from breaking down. You don't want to take either of them everyday and maybe not together. You body needs time to balance out, and you don't want your body to adjust to taking them often. I find that it helps but I need need a high level of stimulation sometimes just to keep going normally. Either of these will help give you vivid dreams and appears to speed information processing, though you may get lest rest.   ""There seems to be some ongoing debate on whether Galantamine and/or Huperzine A should be taken with a choline source. Some find the combination highly synergistic while others claim that the combo introduces too much acetylcholine.""  from  http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/34587-huperzine-a-vs-galantamine/  Huperzine also seems to help me achieve the best functioning state. you would be surprised at what the right combination of Piracetam, Grape Seed Extract, and huperzine a/galantamine can do. I only use huperzine A/ galantamine when I want a super positive experience - you don't want to mess with your body's acetylcholine balance by taking it often or it might trigger or enhance depression. Taking it occasionally doesn't seem to hurt it though.   I learned this through a lot of careful experimentation and reading through forums. Especially the sulbutimine dosage. I had tried taking 200mg of sulbutimine with no effect several times and found that it only worked at 600mg. I only tried it at that dosaage since several sources confirmed that lessor amounts would not necessarily work. The 500mg tyrosine does seem to help and is also part of Focus Xt and many energy drinks. Sulbutimine works without it though at 600mg/day. I just agree that the Tyrosine helps.  Hope that helps, if you have any questions please let me know.  I'm glad to defend this since it truly has helped me have any quality of life. I will say that Modnafinil and Sulbutimine both helped save my working life."

I think you could get the same effect from eating food, and if you're doing occasional fasted training, it might be more beneficial to actually do that purely fasted.  I don't have plans to reorder BCAAs or glutamine anytime soon."

Less aches and pains; faster recovery of muscle mass; better mood; more energy; clearheadedness.  Ironically, I didn't realize at the time that it was especially good for recovery from illness. I had just heard that it was a good supplement to try. I was blown away by how awesome it was and I couldn't figure out why everyone wasn't taking it. I learned later that most people would not get such dramatic effects.   I think the average person would mostly just notice a difference in soreness/recovery if they are training hard.   TL;DR: Glutamine is amazing for unfucking your overall health and your gut...but it is probably not as useful for a healthy person. It is great for recovery if you are training hard."

Supplements,3dqbhi,fabbbiii,2,Sat Jul 18 12:30:28 2015 UTC,"First off, thanks for the response and information.  You're absolutely correct. My goal is to first lose weight (I'm currently a 5'11"", 265lb, 29 year old male) and get down to 200lbs. At that point, I was going to start gaining muscle. I spend about two hours at the gym, five days a week, and my goal is to do 20 miles on a stationary bike in 90 minutes. I am currently at 14.5 miles in 75 minutes, but can't seem to push far over that without over exhausting myself. I'm really hoping to find a preworkout that will help.  When I was younger (and in much better shape) I use to use No Xplode, but I've become lazy over the years due to my career and life changes, but I'd like to get back to where I was.

Supplements,3dqbhi,fabbbiii,2,Sat Jul 18 12:38:29 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that you shouldn't focus on boosters to much. Do you do a diet such as keto, where you don't eat any carbs? Because if you do, that'd be the main reason for your exhaustion. Also, when you speak about exhaustion, do you mean that your muscles give up? Or is it your condition. Because you can only increase your condition by just riding the stationary bike over and over again. If your muscles give up, eat enough before you do your work. At the end of the day, you should just do it, it will get better quickly. Sorry I can't give you any advice about boosters for your goal man, but really congratiulations on your work, it will pay of, I'm sure you'll do it!"
Supplements,3dqbhi,detailz03,2,Sat Jul 18 13:23:40 2015 UTC,"I don't do any major diet like keto. I've just been cutting back my portions each day, tracking my calories, eating less calories, and chugging water (1.5-2 gallons per day). I normally wake up and have a milk with a scoop of protein (25g protein total), and then a bagel with cream cheese on my way to work. At work I'll have a salad, sushi, or chicken for lunch, then another protein shake and two scoops of Alpha Amino Xtreme (Fruit punch if it matters) before going to the gym once I arrive home. After the gym I eat a small dinner and have another protein shake, then go to sleep in 3-4 hours. I've been doing this for the past three weeks. A month prior to the gym, I was swimming laps in the pool each day, but my diet wasn't as strict. When I started going to the gym, I was getting exhausted around 20-30 minutes on the stationary bike, and have worked myself up to a little over an hour now. My issue is that my knees start to pop and hurt due to over 20 years of snowboarding taking their toll. This is also the reason I am unable to run, if I do, I can barely walk for the rest of the week. Normally after an hour, I am covered in sweat, heart rate is 150-160bpm, and I'm exhausted. Due to me going from 30 minutes to an hour in the three weeks I've been at the gym, I am feeling like I'm making improvements, but this feels like it's been a wall that I can't get over."

I'd drink that prior to a workout and drank the BCAAs during a workout. Never felt tired or exhausted and helped me push my muscles till failure.  If you visit /r/fitness they will tell you, you don't need cardio to lose weight, only use heavy weights.  Also, your meal prior to the gym should have some carbs in it, it'll help from your body feeling exhausted. I am doing /r/leangains and I can't workout fasted due to work, but I eat my first meal around 2-3pm, hit the gym at 6 or 7, and eat my last meal at 9 (you can setup your meals however you want, just need to hit your macros, and make sure you eat 40% of carbs prior to the gym and the other 60 after).

In the end, as long as you hit your macros and are deficient in calories, you'll lose weight. I have over thought about these things waaaaaaaaaaay too much. For me /r/leangains actually made it easy to eat what I want. If I want to go get some burgers and still lose weight, I'm not eating breakfast, so I can easily find a way to make it work.  And it is a common misconception that cardio burns the fat off quick. My girlfriend use to live by cardio and those little classes they would have at the gym, all geared towards cardio/endurance. They are fine sure, but you won't see huge results without weight lifting.  Now my girlfriend (after a WHOLE lot of time convincing her) is eager to use weights.

Here are some of the things that made them very popular.   Their first location is in a empty parking lot, they hold a strong man competition at least once a year with tons of vendors who come out with free supplements and of course its for them to advertise their products. Those that compete in the competition receive a bag of all sorts of goodies (you have to pay $25 to enter). If you spend over x amount, you get a free shirt from them (usually has their logo on it, but people where these shirts to the gym all the time, because they're great shirts). Sometimes instead of a free shirt, they'll give you an option of a free shaker. Samples, samples, samples. If you buy enough stuff, or curious about different products, they'll give you free samples to try. No other store does this, so it keeps people coming back. The owners are active lifters and know their product like the back of their hand. This makes a huge difference when someone is unsure of what they want. Very personable/friendly, they make an effort to get to know you. They have reps form legit companies come down to demo their products with free samples. They show you the price break down for every supplement. I.E. if a protein says 32g of protein, they will actually show you how many scoops you'll get out of it if taken as advertised. Because protein containers look huge, but never have enough in them. If you're a regular, they'll order supps they don't have in for you. I've done this with all my NOW products They have no problem admitting if someone has a better price.

You also don't necessarily need your blood too thin unless you have a reason to be at risk of a thrombotic (clot forming) event and it does worsen your risk for suffering a bleeding event in normal and/or unusual and threatening places (eye/brain). The seed varieties contain adulterants that can cause vasomotor instability, weak pulse, flushing, arrhythmia.   Don't know pycnogenol (I can dig the procyanidins) but the rest have little interaction. Fiber inhibits absorption by being a bulking agent, reducing surface area for absorption and donating more to your colon's flora and the toilet. This is largely good if you want to keep calories/sugar down, but does interfere with nutrient absorption.  R(enin)A(ngiotensin)S(ystem) supplements, similar to A(ngiotensin)C(onverting)E(nzyme)i(inhibitor)s and A(ngioII)R(receptor)B(blocker)s gradually become generally compensated for through the course of 4 weeks, where the initial dose is maximum potency of diuresis. The lasting effects come from relaxing the vasomotor tone. It slows down pathological cardiac/brain/kidney remodeling by virtue of smoother fluid dynamics (the heart and its vessels are slaves to laplace and bernoulli and frank-starling, while the brain and kidney are slaves to the blood flow).  And you forgot the most important parameter to cardiovascular health, autonomic tone. Neurovascular. You can load up your NO stores, circulate the gimpiest platelets you want, but there's still a direct nervous line to that vessel telling it how tight to squeeze. Exercise and meditation balances your sympathetic and vagal tone."

You should also investigate the things that doctors talk about when you have high blood pressure (i.e. body weight, exercise, stimulant drugs, and stress).

The Supercritical CO2 and/or hydroethanolic extract part is just the extraction process they used. They wanted the major bioactives (in this case it seems to be total curcuminoids) and wanted to concentrated it, the 17:1 and 20:1 are how much they managed to concentrate it. They specify the extraction because sometimes it alters the herb in question (I don't think it's the case here) but also because it's sexy science speak and that sells.  So in the case of the hydroethanolic extract there, it managed to concentrate the curcuminoids 17-fold which resulted in 41.65% of the final weight of the product being curcuminoids; normally the percentage would be smaller.  It's no big deal if you're fine with taking a larger dose of turmeric since concentration doesn't matter then, but if a company wanted to sell a product in a capsule then they would need to concentrate it (since a serving size of 1 pill is mostly seen as better than swallowing 4-6 pills)."

In the end though, you want curcuminoids and the supp contains 41.65% of them.  The other 58.35% is literally ""stuff in turmeric that we don't care about but managed to stay in after extract"" so maybe fiber or something?

There are ways to eat which will ensure you are getting as much iron in your system as possible. Vegetarianism is not as terrible as Veganism because you have a lot of good options for protein and other essential nutrition. So don't let the diet difficulties bum you out.   2) Get a good iron supplement. Ferrous Iron is the type you want to get. This is important because Ferrous is the most absorbed by the body. The other types are beneficial but they are not the best in terms of absorbing in the digestive tract. You sometimes have the majority pass right through.   One good brand is called Feosol  3) B-12 will be harder to deal with because B-12 is primarily found in meat products. That being said, the doctors are able to supplement B-12 with shots which is a good way to get your levels up as quickly as possible.   Methylcobalamin is considered the best form in terms of absorbancy.   You're a Vegetarian so the best choices you have for B-12 are Eggs, Cheese, and dairy in general.

You probably want about 20mg of Piperine regardless, as a sufficient amount of the enzyme needs to be deactivated in order to spare any quantity of curcumin in your body.   Though I'm not a PHD in this kind of thing, so I might be wrong. Either way, I wouldn't suggest taking such low doses of Piperine, since one gram of the stuff (as powder) is only like $2.

The reason you want to take more citrulline malate is because it is usually a 2:1 ratio of citrulline to malic acid.

Their Whey Isolate (#6 in value, #18 in quality) has 2.51g of free aminos per serving and their Whey Protein (#22 in value, #38 in quality) has 8.22g of free aminos per serving. We perform full amino acid profiling on every protein supplement on our site. We subtract this free amino acid content from each product's protein content before ranking them. Our grades and rankings are based on each product's true bound protein content. Both products were also penalized* for their label inaccuracies. After these corrections, their Whey Isolate has 26.5g of bound protein per 36g serving. That is a 74% protein concentration, the same percentage as Optimum Gold Standard. Their Whey Protein has 18.6g of bound protein per 33g serving. That is a 50.3% protein concentration, which is still slightly above average for this category. Body Fortress prices their products well below average, which allows them to rank relatively well for value.   *Label accuracy matters to us, but active ingredients are what drive LabDoor's rankings the most.

You'll find you can save a fair amount over pre-mixed preworkout products, and you also gain the advantage of knowing the exact dose of ingredients in your preworkout compared to proprietary blends in a lot of products.  Downsides will be flavoring and mixability, but if you're tight on money and just want to make a preworkout for yourself on the cheap, it's a great route to go.    I would still highly recommend against trying to make a product to sell.  Mixing a bunch of single ingredients one serving at a time for your preworkout is easy.  Mixing 30 servings of ingredients of varying density and dose homogenously to sell someone else in a container? Basically impossible without professional mixing equipment.  This brings up pretty big safety concerns.  I.e. you have several multi-gram ingredients and then 200mg of caffeine per serving.   If your product were to be mixed poorly you could end up with someone getting a gram of caffeine in a scroop which would be dangerous.  Also, even at the prices you'll get on consumer side bulk powders + the time spent mixing them and whatever attempt at packaging you make, you're not really going to be able to offer a superior product at a price better than actual products, that actually lets you pay yourself any sort of worthwhile 'profit'"

I do understand your point of getting the right doses into every scoop, this is a concern I've had with C4 also, the question being, am I really getting all the right amounts of ingredients in each scoop?  As for as selling to consumers... it's not in the near future and at this point it's more like a dream. I'm just a dude that loves the gym and am curious about making my own supplements.

The rash was spreading all down my neck, and halfway down my torso.  My right arm was so swollen it was difficult to differentiate between my forearm and my bicep.  I chose a course of prednisone, which I am on my last two days of tapered dosage.  I currently still have about half a dozen small raised blisters, with all swelling gone.  I have three pounds of magnesium sulfate, which is water soluble.  A solution of 2-10% could easily be compounded here at my home.  I would love to have input from this subreddit as those that care too inform themselves about this substance and it's relative dermal toxicity.  Thanks for your consideration."

Supplements,3d937a,PricePlow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:56:23 2015 UTC,Pump is the fullness feeling u get when ur muscles have been worked out and are full of blood. It can be enhanced by citrulline and arginine which is the precursor to nitrous oxide. They aid in blood vessel dilation which allows more blood to get to the muscle so it feels fuller.
Supplements,3d937a,PricePlow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:37:22 2015 UTC,"OK, with that seen, favorite focus supplement is Myokem Nitramine at http://www.getnitramine.com (fair disclosure: we built that site), but it's also relatively expensive. But it seems like it'd fit the mold pretty well for you.  Thanks /u/NPK5667 for explaining the pumps  If you want a great deal, check out our deals page and do a CTRL-F search for pre workout and you'll see some ridiculously cheap options. iForce Maximize Intense may fit the bill for you too.

ANS Ritual is always a go-to for us, especially in the focus department. You could probably easily start at one scoop, and the value is always great:  https://www.priceplow.com/ans-performance/ritual  Another favorite pre workout at 200mg caffeine that adds some good focus is Olympus Labs CONQU3R -- https://www.priceplow.com/olympus-labs/conqu3r  The problem is that it tastes quite chalky and bad. I can handle it and don't mind at all, but if you're not ready for grainy texture, it's not for you.  Another one is Momentum Catalyst - a bit stiffer at 250mg caffeine per scoop, but I enjoy the nice doses of everything else, and you can get away with 1/2-3/4 scoop if you don't want all that caffeine: https://www.priceplow.com/momentum-nutrition/catalyst  Both Catalyst and have Alpha GPC which will give you a nice touch of focus.  I still like Nitramine a lot, it's got a lot of stims and focus, but not a lot of caffeine. Probably a bit hardcore for a first-timer though.  Long story short, considering everything, I'd try one scoop of Ritual and have a fun time."

Honestly, it's probably psycosomatic, or related to something else.

Be careful though if you already take something for glucose. This could cause an unsafe drop in blood sugar.  Milk Thistle  This one is for your liver. You are suffering from high lipids and high glucose which means your liver is likely not working to it's full capacity. Sugar is shit for the liver and the liver should be able to handle the lipid content in your body if you treat it right. I had a similar issue before I got my weight in check.   My doctor put me on Milk Thistle. The way it was explained to me  was a compound in the thistle (Silymarin) reaches the liver and acts as a barrier from environmental toxins and inflammatory products that would cause liver issues. The secondary benefit is the compounds in the plant are anti-inflammatory so as it is blocking harmful substances from reaching your liver it also treats the inflammation currently present.   The liver is huge for overall health. In regards to regulating lipid content metabolizes the excess. This should aid in regulating your lipid levels. It deals with weight loss since body fat has to be metabolized through the liver.  Another reason this would be helpful is the healthier your liver is, the healthier your cholesterol levels are.

It's not really liquid BCAAs, it's hydrolyzed gelatin, fructose (sugar), and whey protein isolate. It's basically flavored protein and sugar with some b-vitamins.

Supplements,3cm2r9,IAM_A_GOAT,2,Thu Jul 9 06:32:44 2015 UTC,"It's not just another protein supplement. Most protein supplements are a protein powder -- not a concentrated, liquid gelatin/fructose/whey combo. But at the end of the day, it is like a protein supplement you might make yourself if you added other stuff to a protein supplement. Most people add whey to some fruit juice or something. It's kinda similar to that.   The difference between powder and pills is up to you. Would you rather take a few pills before/during/after workout, or put powder in a shaker cup and drink it? Also powders tend to be cheaper than pills, which is the case with most supplements. Doesn't really matter IMO, but I also dunno why you want to take BCAAs. Depends more on why you want to use it. Know that unflavored BCAA powder tastes like a chemical burn and doesn't mix well in water, so be sure to get something flavored that mixes well if you go that route. Otherwise, pills are much easier to swallow than a bunch of powder that doesn't dissolve in water."

Also, maybe try different brands. Lately, I've switched to the liquid rhodiola formula from Ceretropic, and that stuff will get your ass going big time.

The active substance is glycyrrhizin, whose metabolite exerts a mineralocorticoid effect by inhibiting the conversion of cortisol to cortisone, allowing cortisol to (over)stimulate the mineralocorticoid receptors.

Despite having used them, there are two big concerns I have about using SARMs:    if you are producing your own testosterone, they will reduce that by some percentage.  This has not been well studied with the doses that are used for bodybuilding / performance enhancement.  So if you end up shutting yourself down for short-run gains, you may actually lose gains in the long-run.  If you are a female or on TRT / using testosterone then this is less of an issue. these are really new and there is very little information about potential long term side effects.  they are more of a drug than a supplement, although they are being sold as supplements.  they are being researched as drugs for muscle wasting and similar conditions.  if/when they get approved for that use you will probably see them become prescription only."

It's like hibernating. They stop growing and can even lose their moisture and dry out (like in a probiotic powder). They wait like that until conditions are nice to grow again, like when they make their way into your gut. Refrigeration may help them survive longer in this state, but it is not strictly necessary all the time. Freezing (especially multiple freeze thaw cycles) is probably a bad idea for keeping them alive in this state.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endospore"
Supplements,3cbvz2,ROTAM,2,Mon Jul 6 23:04:07 2015 UTC,"Endospore:       An endospore is a dormant, tough, and non-reproductive structure produced by certain bacteria from the Firmicute phylum.   The name ""endospore"" is suggestive of a spore or seed-like form (endo means within), but it is not a true spore (i.e., not an offspring). It is a stripped-down, dormant form to which the bacterium can reduce itself. Endospore formation is usually triggered by a lack of nutrients, and usually occurs in Gram-positive bacteria. In endospore formation, the bacterium divides within its cell wall. One side then engulfs the other. Endospores enable bacteria to lie dormant for extended periods, even centuries. Revival of spores millions of years old has been claimed.  When the environment becomes more favorable, the endospore can reactivate itself to the vegetative state. Most types of bacteria cannot change to the endospore form. Examples of bacteria that can form endospores include Bacillus and Clostridium.

Supplements,3cbvz2,LabDoor,9,Mon Jul 6 23:58:25 2015 UTC,"Probiotics are usually freeze dried during the manufacturing process to keep them as inert as possible. They are also commonly manufactured with significant overages (i.e. they claim 50B live cultures per capsule but actually fill each capsule with 75B+ live cultures).  Once the probiotics come off the production line, it's all about ensuring that the products reach each customer with 50B+ live cultures per serving. You do that by controlling temperature and humidity as much as humanly possible. In normal conditions, these cultures die at at rate of ~5% per month. Even with freeze drying + overages, that only gives you six months, and most probiotics are shipped with 12+ month expiration dates.  Most manufacturers will ship their probiotics cold to their distributors and recommend that they store and ship cold to their customers. Here is where it gets interesting. Most retailers (e.g. Amazon) ignore these recommendations and store probiotics in their standard warehouses. This was a major reason why LabDoor got into the business of selling supplements in the first place. All probiotics bought directly through LabDoor (not through one of our affiliate links) are stored and shipped cold.  TL;DR: Manufacturers overfill their probiotics (often at 150%+ vs. label claims) and then control temperature/humidity to ensure that the products still get to the customer at 100%+ of claimed active cultures."

They also tend to have shorter shelf lives than other supplements because of the whole 'technically alive' thingy.  So a mini-cryo effect going on there.  Edit: Also, if you feed the bacteria then it would populate and grow.

Supplements,3cbvz2,Jackolysis,2,Mon Jul 6 21:38:59 2015 UTC,The end goal for a probiotic is to keep it alive and make sure it doesn't grow unnecessarily. I mentioned refrigeration because it tends to be the simplest and most effective way to do this but there are other ways.  I'm not too well versed on the following but I do know there are techniques such as nitrogen sealing which can make supplements a lot more stable until they are opened so it's possible that some products are stable on store shelves but then require refrigeration afterwards.

I can't comment on science behind the pills, but I had the same questions and concerns you did. I found myself not only saving money but having a much healthier gut by incorporating natural probiotics into my diet. It doesn't take a massive amount, either. You can make kombucha and sauerkraut pretty easily at home, if you have the patience and are willing to keep up on it.

Supplements,3cbvz2,broscientologist,3,Mon Jul 6 21:31:21 2015 UTC,"Thats actually the problem with a lot of supplement brands. There was a big stink, I guess about 6 months back, about several major suppliers (GNC and Walmart's brand being two of them) that basically laid plain that very little if any of the actual product on the label would actually be in the caplets. A lot of the herbal stuff was mostly radish leaves and, for want of a better term, a lot of agricultural waste products, again the radish leaves.  Its a great way to monetize stuff that would otherwise just to into dumpsters at big factory farms, and since the FDA isn't involved in the industry, there's no control over whats actually in your pills.   Which is why its important to look at not just the forms of supplements you take (example: Creatine mono is good for you, Creatine hcl is useless) but also fact-check the brands you buy to make sure that whats in the pills is what they say is in the pills, and any time you see something off or vague, find out the truth of the matter.  A lot of companies like to hide marginal doses of more-expensive-but-effective components in ""blends"" with less-effective-but-cheaper ingredients, and put the weight as one big lump.

It's not like it's impossible for them to be digested, they're just more resilient.  It is possible that the fish oil is being taken with a relatively big meal; the stomach's digestion process would prevent things from moving through the stomach too fast and the enteric capsule could be caught up in the stomach for a while unnecessarily, eventually decaying the outer layer. If this is the case see if taking the enteric capsule on an empty stomach or with a bit of water helps."

Just to give you an example: I got myself a lobster red sunburn all over my back yesterday, today its light red and almost gone. So I d say go for fish oil for sure  considering you hurt your ankle i would also suggest to check (and if nessescary raise ) your vitamin b 6, 12 and magnesium levels as  you need those for serotonin which is a natural painkiller ( often found in antidepressiva as well)  edit: in general you should always try to balance your intake so you dont just for example let one vitamin level skyrocket or exclusively eat protein or shit like that. balance is key."

Powder City is a great place to start looking to purchase individually, but there are others as well, including Amazon.  Second, this product actually has listed some pretty cool supplements IMO, but they are all in pixie dust dosages, therefore completely ineffective, and mostly why this product is crap.  The ones I like in particular (note: none of these are antioxidants) include curcumin, ashwagandha, grape seed extract, and phosphatidylcholine, but check out the individual ingredients on Examine to find some with effects you might be interested in, note the proper dosages, and go shopping from there.  For me personally, antioxidants are so freaking easy to get from food that I find supplementing them unnecessary. Coffee, broccoli, a handful of blueberries every morning (they are in season right now and so cheap!), and that kind of thing are much better, proven healthy approaches.   If you are hell bent on taking supplemental antioxidants, I would look at stuff like astaxanthin/fucoxanthin as potential options. They tend to have some cool effects."

They both say it right there at the beginning of the Examine pages. Astaxanthin is the most stable carotenoid (which is important for any antioxidant) and is stronger than lutein or zeaxanthin. Fucoxanthin may have positive effects on glucose metabolism, which has pretty amazing implications.  I don't find supplementing Vitamin C + E to be all that enticing. Most people get plenty in their diets to meet minimums, and there are some legit concerns about whether or not super dosing is good for you.  As far as weening yourself off of that many pills. The most effective supplements are basically concentrated versions of food, so there should be a decent amount in terms of volume. That's why products like that with fifty ingredients in two pills a day are bullshit.  I don't have personal experience with Astralagus, but it's definitely another one to throw in the ""interesting, I might take this one day/hope more research come out"" category.

Supplements,3bzrih,imsoldbro,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:13:19 2015 UTC,"Any natural health product to be sold on shelves in Canada must have an NPN or natural product number. To get this, they have to manufacture it safely, follow packaging and labeling standards and prove the product is safe and effective. American supplements have almost no regulation- recent testing on herbs from companies like GNC and Walmart showed there were very little amounts of the herb in question on the bottle. Often, things are only taken off the market when people die.   The Canadian system can be limiting- there are plenty of things that are not allowed to be sold in Canada that can be found in the states or online. Sometimes these regulations are overly protective, for example you couldn't get l-arginine in Canada for some time but it's in your best interest to know what you're buying is safe and effective. Less chance of buying snake oil, or getting Mercury or lead in your supplements. The place I work still sells colloidal silver, so the system isn't perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than the American one."

Citrulline Supplementation Improves Organ Perfusion and Arginine Availability under Conditions with Enhanced Arginase Activity. Wijnands KA1, Meesters DM2, van Barneveld KW3, Visschers RG4, Briedé JJ5, Vandendriessche B6,7, van Eijk HM8, Bessems BA9, Hoven NV10, von Wintersdorff CJ11, Brouckaert P12,13, Bouvy ND14, Lamers WH15, Cauwels A16,17, Poeze M18. Author information Abstract Enhanced arginase-induced arginine consumption is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of sickle cell disease-induced end organ failure. Enhancement of arginine availability with l-arginine supplementation exhibited less consistent results; however, l-citrulline, the precursor of l-arginine, may be a promising alternative. In this study, we determined the effects of l-citrulline compared to l-arginine supplementation on arginine-nitric oxide (NO) metabolism, arginine availability and microcirculation in a murine model with acutely-enhanced arginase activity. The effects were measured in six groups of mice (n = 8 each) injected intraperitoneally with sterile saline or arginase (1000 IE/mouse) with or without being separately injected with l-citrulline or l-arginine 1 h prior to assessment of the microcirculation with side stream dark-field (SDF)-imaging or in vivo NO-production with electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. Arginase injection caused a decrease in plasma and tissue arginine concentrations. l-arginine and l-citrulline supplementation both enhanced plasma and tissue arginine concentrations in arginase-injected mice. However, only the citrulline supplementation increased NO production and improved microcirculatory flow in arginase-injected mice. In conclusion, the present study provides for the first time in vivo experimental evidence that l-citrulline, and not l-arginine supplementation, improves the end organ microcirculation during conditions with acute arginase-induced arginine deficiency by increasing the NO concentration in tissues.

Thanks, I'll make sure to check that.   What are your reasons for numbers 6-9?   This is going to sound pretty stupid, but I found those in a comment for the B Complex on iHerb, saying that it's the  recommended iHerb stack against hair loss. Looked into it a little but couldn't find much info, however the reviews on all the products in that list seem suggest that it helps with hair loss. Ultimately, I will do more research on this and I will look on hair loss forums for more exact info, but it seems like a good ( and relatively cheap ) starting point.   MSM is good for joint health and basically prevents soreness from workouts. I use it and like it.   Yeah just realized that as well, one more reason to get it I guess.   Up the D3 to 5000 IU.

Supplements,3bwinp,HowAboutNitricOxide,2,Fri Jul 3 15:14:30 2015 UTC,"OP please note that recommendations here to take 5000 IU/day of vitamin D are baseless; your serum 25-(OH)-D concentration (indicator of vitamin D status) is unknown to us random internet people, and no reputable organization recommends such high (over the UL of 4000 IU/day, no less) doses of supplemental vitamin D on a population basis. The Harvard School of Public Health recommendation is at least 1000 IU from diet (including supplements) daily, up to 2000 IU. If you are already vitamin D sufficient a dose of 5000 IU per day could at best be useless and at worst be harmful. Instead of taking the word of a random redditor, stick with the conservative 1000-2000 IU/day dosage as recommended by public health experts and, if you desire, seek out an LC-MS test of your serum 25-(OH)-D and consult a physician."

Supplements,3bwinp,rao-blackwell-ized,2,Sun Jul 5 17:07:20 2015 UTC,"As far as blood tests go I would suggest focusing on general health metrics: get a fasted lipid panel and blood glucose every 5 years, and maybe a hemoglobin if you don't give blood (where you get a free reading) or if you have symptoms of anemia. Many vitamins and minerals, in particular some that are harder to obtain through diet (e.g. Zinc) can't easily be measured by blood tests, so it's more important to ensure sufficient intake through diet, and if necessary, supplementation. Some things, like iron, can be measured accurately, for instance with a serum ferritin test, but tests aren't often indicated, in this case unless your diet is low in iron and/or you are anemic."

The dose for that once is something I have to consider more carefully: since it's summer where I live and I spend roughly 3-4 hrs per day outside, how much do you think I should take?   5000 IU daily.

Supplements,3bwinp,lastPharaoh37,2,Fri Jul 3 18:56:53 2015 UTC,"I personally think multivitamins are a waste of time, and there have been some studies showing they're harmful. Take a look at the percentages on any multivitamin against the daily recommended value. You end up getting ridiculous amounts of things like vitamin C (which you're also getting in another supplement you listed) and tiny amounts of trace minerals. There is no reason you can't get an adequate amount of vitamins through healthy diet (which it sounds like you've been moving toward anyways).  Vitamin D3 is important during cold seasons when your sun exposure is limited. I take about 5,000 iu daily and stop in the summer (I'm in Canada).  Fish Oil is useful if you're not getting much fish in your diet.  I have no idea why you'd need anything else you listed. Are you a vegetarian? If so, maybe B vitamins are useful.

Ultimately, my point is that no matter how much effort you put into your diet and making sure you're buying quality food, I think a multivitamin would be the way to go to mae sure your body is getting everything it needs.

Supplements,3bug1a,sknick_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:45:48 2015 UTC,"ZMA = bullshit basically.  Don't waste your money on it.  ZMA was created by Victor Conte.  Victor Conte would give undetectable steroids to athletes (ex. Marion Jones, Barry Bonds) and then have them give interviews to bodybuilding magazines saying that ZMA was responsible for their performances.  He called his track team ""ZMA track club"", but all the athletes were actually on steroids.  The Cream, The Clear, Testosterone, Human Growth Hormone, EPO, Insulin, etc.  So essentially ZMA was a front for what steroids could do for an athlete.  Obviously, Victor Conte couldn't generate big money by selling steroids to the public, he needed another way to make legal money off his association with these star athletes.  ZMA was it - a legal mineral supplement.  But he still had to convince the public that it was effective.  He participated in a ZMA research study that cited increases in testosterone & growth hormone, when that is now proven to be bogus & untrue.  That study is the one cited whenever you hear claims about the benefits of ZMA.  In reality, zinc might increase testosterone in someone who has a zinc deficiency, but most people in developed countries don't have this problem...so they'll see no real change.  Victor Conte still gets paid off of nearly every ZMA purchase that is made...so if you buy it you're basically giving money to someone who has scammed you.  If you want to know more, read the book Game of Shadows.  If you want to supplement zinc &/or magnesium, just buy zinc &/or magnesium.  A dose of ZMA contains 30mg zinc, 450mg magnesium, 10.5g of vitamin b6"

They did not though.   They are separated to show you that you are getting whats needed.  Bcaa ratios do not matter as long as you are getting an adequate amount of them.   You have fallen victim to supplement hype and marketing.  All the ratios are used for is to make people like you believe it is worth the extra money.   5 to 10 grams of bcaa's is what you need in any ratio.  So yes alpha amino is adequate.  It's slightly better than the 2 products you mention because it has 5 grams of bcaa per serving plus all of the other essential amino acids that are not present in extend and the allmax.  Also there are electrolytes for hydration.

I like to drink them as a tasty alternative to other sports drinks or juices.   In my opinion the alpha amino taste the best and I have tried many over the years.

Anecdotally I had been using beta alanine for a while and started noticing a lot of cramping and a feeling of uneasiness that was very unlike my usual self, I started to supplement taurine at night before bed (I consume beta alanine in the mornings preworkout), and I noticed the cramping stopped and I felt much more calm and like my usual self.

Since beta-alanine and taurine compete for uptake and the concentration of one affects the other, consuming one of them consistently while dosing the other is just common sense.   Which is sorta true sorta not. They use the same uptake transporter so it is bad to overdose on one of them all the time, it would make you not take up any of the other one since it was always being competed out. This is why in some anecdotes people get severe cramps with overdosing BA and it's thought to be due to taurine depletion (and taurine supplementation here helps).  However, taking a high dose of both at the same time seems silly since they just molecularly cock block each other.  I don't see a reason to have them both at the same time but, if you decide to routinely take a high dose of one of them, then including the other is probably a prudent idea."

It gets good near the end.    Amineptine (Survector) is a cleanish, (relatively) selective dopamine reuptake blocker. Higher doses promote dopamine release too. Amineptine is pro-sexual and liable occasionally to cause spontaneous orgasms. It is a mild but pleasant psychostimulant and a fast-acting mood-brightener. Unlike most other tricyclics, it doesn't impair libido or cognitive function. Unlike typical stimulants and other activating agents, it may actually improve sleep architecture. Scandalously, amineptine isn't licensed and marketed in Britain and America. For it is feared it might have ""abuse-potential"". FDA pressure led to its withdrawal in Europe too. This drove amineptine onto the pharmaceutical grey market, discomfiting doctors and patients alike.  Another ""French"" option is amineptine's cousin, tianeptine (Stablon). Tianeptine is a neuroprotective antidepressant that reverses the neuronal damage and lasting misery caused by uncontrolled stress. Chronic stress causes dysphoria by inducing corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF2) receptor stimulation of dynorphin release. The endogenous opioid peptide dynorphin activates the unpleasant kappa opioid receptors. Tianeptine acts both as a non-sedating anti-anxiety agent and a non-stimulating mood-brightener. Its use increases extracellular dopamine concentration in the nucleus accumbens and, at higher doses, in the frontal cortex. Uniquely in clinical medicine, tianeptine acts as a selective serotonin reuptake enhancer. Its puzzling efficacy as an antidepressant illustrates how little modern psychiatric medicine really understands about mind, mood and depression. Like other contemporary antidepressants, tianeptine's therapeutic action presumably depends on downstream adaptations both between and within neurons occurring over a period of several weeks. Chronic tianeptine use reverses stress-induced hippocampal dendritric atrophy and amgydaloid dendritic hypertrophy, which is just as nasty as it sounds. But the precise molecular mechanisms are obscure. Tianeptine/Stablon is not licensed in North America primarily because its patent has expired.  A breakthrough in tianeptine research was announced in July 2014 with the unexpected discovery that tianeptine is a full agonist at the mu and delta opioid receptors with negligible effect at the kappa opioid receptors. Selective mu opioid agonists in the brain's twin ""hedonic hotspots"" typically induce euphoria. Selective kappa agonists typically induce dysphoria. The role of central delta opioid receptors is poorly understood. Dual activation of the mu and, less potently, the delta opioid receptors may be critical to tianeptine's mood-brightening and anxiolytic effect - a therapeutic action seemingly unaccompanied by the physiological tolerance and dependence that have plagued traditional opioids. All previous research into tianeptine may need to be re-evaluated in this light. More research is urgently needed."

I'm on benzos now, had a stint of pretty bad schizophrenia and paranoia and anxiety for the past 6 years because of drug use. I think it was mostly brought on by adderall and ecstasy though...   I found that exercise works wonders. I go for a walk or jog early in the morning. I also have begun to take on different aspects of living a healthier lifestyle, like taking an interest in nutrition by counting calories (which kind of segwayed into me paying a lot more attention to what types of foods I eat and how beneficial they are to me), adopting a skincare regimen, lifting some weights, and cooking. I was on an SSRI before too but stopped taking it as I felt it wasn't doing as much as the regular exercise.  I'm currently on disability as well but the benzos I got recently have helped a lot... although I do feel they are not as effective as when I first started them, and am a bit worried, as I read that if taken for a period of over 90 days, they can basically raise the risk of dementia at old age by 50%.   The only supplements I take currently are fiber and fish oil, so I can't really help you there but I think it might be worth a try to maybe try to do what I did and attempt to make changes to your lifestyle instead of looking for more supplements that would help you. Of course, I wouldn't even be saying this had it not been for the benzos helping me out...   If you do find a supplement that helps you though, I would definitely love to hear it. I've kind of toyed with the thoughts of getting into nootropics myself, but am still somewhat on the fence about it.  One thing I would recommend though is looking into some sort of dna testing, like 23andme. That's something I plan on doing once I get enough money for it as it will probably reveal some things that will be very beneficial in changing your overall health.

For many people it's not beneficial and causes negative effects to mood/motivation.    So yeah, just stop taking it and see if you feel better."

Any other form is snake oil, micronized isn't really that big a deal, any more that 5g is useless, loading phases are BS.   Don't take the pills, they're mostly baking soda and you have to take about 10 of them every day just to get a teaspoon of actual creatine, which is all you need.  There's some studies out there that suggest you need to take creatine with some form of fast carb (fruit juice, I've taken mine with pomegranate juice), but if you're doing a LCHF thing there's some limited evidence that taking creatine with a dose of fenugreek can have the same benefits without the carbs.

Supplements,3b09p5,Legend-Disc,4,Thu Jun 25 02:31:52 2015 UTC,"Hey OP, here are some brand recommendations:  Yohimbine HCL from Primaforce:  http://www.amazon.com/Primaforce-YOHIMBINE-HCI-2-5-CAPS/dp/B000P1QOHM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1435200436&sr=8-1&keywords=yohimbine+hcl   Buy a couple of bottles, you'll want to work up to .2 mg/kg of Yohimbine HCL per day if you're using it alone, less if you're going to pair it with other stimulants (I'll go into more with that a little later). You'll want to ramp up slowly, so that you aren't totally buggered out while doing cardio. For example, you might take 2.5 mg day 1, 5.0 mg day 2, and assess how you respond to Yohimbine HCL. Stay at a dose for a few days if you experience discomfort, or split up the doses to make it easier on yourself.  Some key points are that you'll want to do cardio fasted and not eat anything with Yohimbine HCL, otherwise the resulting insulin response will interfere with Yohimbine's ability to bind to alpha receptors and will impair its fat-burning capabilities.  The aforementioned tips assume that you're using Yohimbine HCL as a stand-alone. If you want to dip your feet into using ephedrine and caffeine as well, then you're going to want to limit the amount of Yohimbine HCL you use.    That aside, what I like about Yohimbine is its ability to selectively burn fat where there are higher levels of alpha receptors (which are correlated to areas with higher estrogen), so that means you will likely be able to burn fat near your abdominals, glutes, thighs or wherever you normally store fat first.  Something to look out for... increased anxiety if you're not used to it and raging boners. When I used to take this, I'd get raging boners in the middle of my LISS. Of course, I wouldn't give a fuck and walked around in plain view with a pitched tent, but you might, so be careful.  For more information, read up on Yohimbine HCL @ Examine (http://examine.com/supplements/Yohimbine/).     Caffeine from Prolab: http://www.amazon.com/ProLab-Caffeine-Maximum-Potency-100-Count/dp/B0011865IQ/ref=pd_sim_121_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=0WH834T145SFEZTG6M8Y   You can't really go wrong purchasing caffeine. It's damned cheap and there isn't much to differentiate one brand from another, but this is another brand I've used. However, you'll likely develop rapid tolerance to it, so it is something you'll need to cycle.  That aside, you'll want to start off low with 100 mg ~30-45 minutes before cardio if you've never taken caffeine before. Otherwise, take 200 mg caffeine and work your way up to 4-6 mg/kg.  One thing to note is that ""3.5mg/kg caffeine was associated with a 233% enhanced adrenaline release and 211% enhanced cortisol release in response to stress when compared to stress under placebo conditions, which was data pooled from naive and habitual users; augmentation of these hormones did not appear to be related to habitual caffeine intake"" (Examine). Cortisol is one of the hormones in your body that are catabolic, that is, they break things down. In a fasted state, increasing cortisol will help you increase fat loss.   Taking caffeine will also improve your aerobic capacity, thus allowing you to run/work out for longer and therefore burn more calories.  I highly recommend you stack caffeine together with ephedrine, and possibly yohimbine hcl, but I'll get into that later.   Ephedrine/Stack Recommendation:   This is something that you're not going to be able to buy from amazon. Instead, go to your nearest pharmacy and request Bronkaid/Primatene. You'll need to bring your ID to purchase this, but you'll be able to get legit ephedrine hcl (with some added ingredients :() for around $~10 for 24 caplets of 24 mg ephedrine. Or, you can try your luck purchasing ephedrine overseas, so you can get 8 mg concentrations (easier to ramp up). Ephedrine is one of my favorite stimulants for fat-burning. It's works by a different mechanism than Yohimbine, that is, it targets beta receptors, so if you combine it with Yohimbine, you'll be able to have them synergize and burn more fat!  Combining Ephedrine with Caffeine also potentiates their individual effects. I would recommend you start with ephedrine at 8 mg, 100 mg caffeine pre-cardio and ramp your way up to 24 mg ephedrine, 200-400 mg caffeine and then adding in Yohimbine HCL slowly. This is to insure that you don't stress out your cardiovascular system too much, and that you give it time to adjust.    Read up on it @ http://examine.com/supplements/Ephedrine/#summary1-2.

Supplements,3b09p5,St0kka,2,Thu Jun 25 03:08:54 2015 UTC,"Green Tea Extract and Yohimbine HCL should be taken away from meals, in a fasted state. Is it possible to do cardio in the morning and then workout in the afternoon/evening? Otherwise, would you be able to switch it around? What does your schedule look like?   One recommendation I'd have if you do want to eat then, is to start with Ephedrine and Caffeine pre-workout, and you can do cardio later on. Otherwise, you should fit your supplements around your training schedule if you can't change that. You can take the EC stack up to 3x a day, depending on your tolerance if you want to increase fat-burning to the max. But, you'll also want to make sure you cycle off and on as tolerance is an issue with caffeine. Ephedrine will still work after you built up tolerance to its stimulant properties, but you'll lose the appetite suppression and the euphoria that comes alongside taking it. When I used to take ephedrine, I'd feel like a beast in the gym, had the hardest, most intense workouts of my life. Too bad, I didn't cycle off, and burned out after a month and a half."

Doing so may increase your risk of unlikely but potentially fatal side effects including: stroke, heart attack, seizures, or severe mental disorders (see Side Effects section and Precautions section). In addition, dietary supplements containing ephedrine should not exceed 8 mg as a single ephedrine dose, 24 mg of ephedrine per day (24 hours), or be given for longer than 7 days, as recommended by the FDA. Exceeding the recommended ephedrine dose increases your risk of the side effects noted above. For detailed information, consult your pharmacist.

Yohimbine is another good choice, but is really only useful if you eat low carb or practice long periods of fasting as it binds to the same receptors as insulin, so if you have any insulin in your system it doesn't really do anything.    Intermittent fasting and low carb is a really good choice for your goals, throw in an EC stack and some yohimbine as needed and the fat will just melt away.

I do a couple scoops in the morning for breakfast on training days.  I'm too lazy to make other breakfast and when it comes down to it, protein supplements are just food.

I'm gonna give you the answer that most people give skinny guys on /fitness.  You just need to eat more. figure out your Total Daily Expenditure (which for you will not be very much) and eat 500-1000 above it.  Usually 500 is enough but it sounds like you could use some bodyfat.  Once you are in between 16-23% bodyfat (20 is probably the sweet spot), you can focus on just putting on some muscle until you are at a good spot.    You will want to do some sort of resistance training in addition to eating more or else you'll just put on fat which you will need for your periods to become more regular and to get pregnant.    There are lots of ways that bodybuilders put on mass (which is basically what you want to do).  Mass gaining shakes are just dextrose added to whey protein.  You can make your own shake with whey and oats and whole milk that will easily add 800-1000 extra calories a day. Now you still  need to eat everything else you already are.  I hope I'm not just ""mansplaining"" or repeating things you already heard. I'm the opposite of you I have a problem eating to much (as most Americans do, lol). But this questions comes up a lot in men's fitness circles for those we term ""hard-gainers"" and barring some other medical condition, it always comes down to the fact that the person simply isn't eating enough compared to how many calories they burn a day.    Here is an example of a shake that will be putting weight on you in no time : http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/build-your-own-mass-gainer.html  I hope this helps and I hope you get pregnant and have a happy beautiful baby!"

Supplements,3aqdkj,mshadow1990,3,Mon Jun 22 17:34:53 2015 UTC,"Don't bother with yohimbine unless you're taking it in a fasted state. 16/8 works well.    People have, and the consensus from what I've seen is that it's nothing but a waste of money. Protein intake has nothing to do with its efficacy afaik, provided you're fasted.  Most likely, yes.  Yes, again usually considered a waste of money.  Proper dose. I believe it's somewhere around 0.2mg/kg. Work up to that of course and lower it if you're uncomfortable.  Not sure of its effect on gyno.  For proper use, i.e while fasted, one dose.    This is a good source for yohimbine info. It's what I use.  http://yohimbine.emgsites.com"

Supplements,3aqdkj,bananafishbones83,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:26:58 2015 UTC,"No point in taking Yohimbine if you have carbs still in your system. Key to it is fasting. I take it preworkout all the time. I've been training fasted on it with 5g of BCAAs. BCAAs do have some calories but usually not enough to to spike up your insulin to make yohimbine useless. Also depends on the BCAAs you are using as well.  In short: if you want to lose stubborn fat but not fast, I recommend lose the yohimbine and concentrate on your diet most of all. Combine that with a proper training regimen. Can't fail."

Supplements,3aqtub,PricePlow,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:59:17 2015 UTC,"Love em both... I duno. For what you're going for, the L-Theanine in 212 might be a nice touch.  Also note that 212 has some diuretic properties (like from dandelion). That's a difference-maker - whether or not you want that is up to you.  Meanwhile, Alphamine has a solid bit of yohimbe -- some love it, some hate it. If you like it, it definitely helps suppress appetite and prevent some fat storage when taken empty stomach.  Could come down to flavor too. The orange flavor of 212 is definitely great, but if you don't like orange stuff, that could turn you against.  So those are some differences. The rest comes down to personal preference.  Meanwhile, 212 also has more caffeine - so if you want it to last longer, you can space out the liquid more.  Me personally... I love yohimbe when sitting around (like now), but I don't like it in the heat or when working out as much. I'm semi-sensitive to it compared to some others on the sub. So I'd actually use different ones for different occasions."

Supplements,3apltv,leclisse,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:21:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if it's a nootropic exactly. I started taking it to follow Lyle McDonald's 'stubborn fat' protocol. It actually is uncomfortable with high-intensity exercise for me, but I've noticed that it potentiates the good effects of methylphenidate, which I am prescribed for ADHD. When taking Yohimbine I can take a meaningfully lower dose of Ritalin while having better subjective focus and less sense of intensity or anxiety. It makes me feel relaxed but energetic.  I do like it for low to moderate intensity steady state exercise and for intermittent fasting (either 16/8 or alternate-day PSMF)."

Supplements,3apltv,djc_tech,3,Mon Jun 22 15:19:09 2015 UTC,"Yes. The feeling of taking too much is tremendously different. You'll notice the first time you really take the wrong dose, which you will.  For me (don't take this as dosing advice) 10mg is fine, 14mg is perfect, 20mg and I have the chills frequently and feel like I'm salivating more than usual, 25mg is a bit uncomfortable and with lots of chills, and in the 30s I feel awful and faint in a very hard to describe way. Not buzzed—like fainting. Anything above 15–20mg screws up workouts. I can repeat the 14mg dose as much as I want given a 2 or 3 hour interval for elimination, but 28mg at once is not a desirable experience.  It never feels like a stimulant to me, it just improves my mood and focus at the correct dose and does its job.  For reference, I weigh around 155lbs."

Personally, I'd prefer a 2:1 ratio of DHA to EPA for the cognitive benefits. I'd recommend NOW Food's DHA supplement, which provides 500 mg DHA and 250 mg EPA per softgel. You get a 1.5 month supply (taking 4 softgels a day for 2000 mg DHA/1000 mg EPA) for only ~$29.   Or, if you want to purchase fish oil in bulk... and don't care about the ratios, I'd recommend this:  http://www.bulknaturaloils.com/oils/marine-oils/fish-oil-softgels/bulk-fish-oil-softgels-33-epa-22-dha-1000mg You get 6000 softgels for ~150. You get 330 mg EPA/220 mg DHA per softgel. You hypothetically take 10 softgels a day (not that I recommend this) and have a 600 day supply (20 months) for ~$7.5 a month. Now, if you do care about DHA/EPA ratios, the website also offers 70% DHA and 70% EPA softgels separately, so you could buy a 250 softgel box of each for $50 total. Then, you'd be able to play with ratios and have a 2 month supply of each ($25/month).   Regardless, Jim's product is not special; neither in value nor in convenience."

Well, if you go to the end of the paper, the authors say have no idea about the effects in humans with regards to the 2 tested and certainly no idea about other marketed supplements, so they recommend that someone should study that.      Our data implicate the need of dose-effect studies of antioxidants on SSC pools to establish their safety as nutritional supplements or therapeutic agents—especially in the case of antioxidants accumulating into mitochondria.    http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(15)00521-5  They only tested NAC and MitoQ.  The latter appeared to have some side effects at an increased dose for the latter.    Our results show that the therapeutic window of MitoQ for stem cells is narrow. In contrast, high concentrations of NAC did not show toxicity, which suggests to a specific feature for MitoQ and potentially for other mitochondria-accumulating antioxidants."

If you're taking in that much magnesium, consider if you're taking in enough sodium/potassium/calcium.   The problem may be electrolyte balance more than anything, because the symptoms sound similar to the ""keto flu"" that some low-carbers run into in the first couple of weeks of the keto lifestyle, due to electrolyte changes. Supplementing them and keeping them in balance and staying hydrated usually prevents it.  Electrolytes being out of balance can have terrible symptoms."

It definitely wasn't the magnesium - you can get that much magnesium by eating a proper meal.  The sensations in your chest and stomach sound like GI complaints (it's certainly not your heart etc).  Perhaps your GI doesn't like glycine, or perhaps you just need to take it with food.  Regarding magnesium: you don't know whether you're deficient.  If you can afford it, you could just go see a doctor and get basic bloodwork done to find out.  You could also try taking the supplement more, but with food, or you could try a different magnesium supplement.  Tons of people have taken magnesium glycinate, and reports of intense side effects are rare - it's well tolerated.  But there are plenty of other forms you can try if you're so inclined.  Just don't go overboard.  You should probably pair it with calcium, but don't go overboard on that either - a 1:1 ratio by weight is fine (all that golden ratio stuff is irrelevant to amino acid chelates, and has to do with the absorption mechanism for dissociated ions).  Try taking ~500mg each and see how it goes.  It's low enough you won't hurt yourself, and high enough that it'll actually do something if you are deficient."

I wonder if you have any evidence to support this claim that isn't from someone trying to sell us magnesium...sounds like a proposition that won't allow itself to be refuted: ""You probably have magnesium deficiency, but tests only show severe deficiency so your doctor won't be able to find it."""
Supplements,3ai1up,lodro,2,Tue Jun 23 04:21:24 2015 UTC,"I wonder if you have any evidence to support this claim that isn't from someone trying to sell us magnesium   Want empirical evidence? Alcoholics have massively depleted magnesium stores, but while they're still active drinkers their body generally manages stores at a certain level. When they stop drinking all of a sudden their body (which has gotten used to using alcohol for calories) has to switch to glucose metabolism for energy, which depleted their already heavily depleted thiamine. There's an interaction between thiamine and magnesium as well, and all of a sudden their low-normal magnesium levels go in the toilet, and welcome to a lot of the potential negative effects of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.  The gold standard diagnostic tool for assessing magnesium deficiency is a magnesium loading test via IV. How many people have you heard of that get that? Alcoholics get an empiric banana bag when they end up in the hospital, pregnant women with pre-eclampsia/eclampsia get it in the hospital... but no one ever uses it as a diagnostic tool. Physicians mostly just order serum magnesium (not erythrocyte magnesium which is also a slightly better indicator) and say ""oh nope, it's normal, you're fine"".  The same is true of serum b12 (erythrocyte b12, and holo-transcobalamin are much better markers for detecting deficiency). They'll also use MCV to interpret it, but no one checks methylmalonic acid or homocysteine (homocysteine is rarely checked, but MMA never is).

Similar things can occur in refeeding syndrome if you get too much of one nutrient and not enough of another.  If your body is severely deficient in something like magnesium, that likely also means a deficiency of thiamine (Vitamin B1), both of which are depleted in alcoholics. You get enough of one and not enough of the other and you've disturbed the shitty equilibrium that your body has reached (""homeostasis"") and now it's trying to play catch up.

Probably other things that I forgot to mention. My butt constantly hurts because of it and I constantly have hemorrhoids.  Recently I've found one thing that has helped: magnesium. Well, it was helping for some months and then stopped for some reason. I wonder if it's because of what you mentioned: I created another deficiency by repleting magnesium. After seeing what you wrote, I read that thiamine deficiency can cause constipation as well. While I was taking magnesium, I was taking a multi that has about 35mg of thiamine in it, but I don't know if that would be enough in a case like this.

Also 35mg of Thiamine should be more than enough to cover a deficiency of B1 in pretty much any setting, if you take it daily.  When you poo, you go once a day, but is it the same time every day (morning, afternoon), how bad do you have to go before you decide to go?  Do you feel like you kinda have to go, and go right away... or do you feel like you have to go, then you have to go really bad (but don't want to go because you think it's gonna hurt), then end up having the feeling pass, and then go two hours later and shit out a brick?

They even contradict each other; in the third study, bioavailibility was greater for gluconate than it was for picolinate.  The first study didn't assess acute bioavailibility, but instead looked at changes in concentration in different body parts over a long period of time.  None of your studies' authors concluded that gluconate was poorly absorbed, either.  The closest any of them get is to suggest that glycinate is better absorbed than gluconate.  The studies whose design could actually determine whether gluconate is garbage found evidence to the contrary, while some comparative studies found that glycinate is superior to gluconate (which doesn't mean gluconate sucks - just that glycinate was better)."
Supplements,3acfjs,lodro,4,Fri Jun 19 01:47:49 2015 UTC,"I think they are quite consistent.  The first study says:   At the end of four weeks hair, urine and erythrocyte zinc levels rose significantly (p less than 0.005, p less than 0.001, and p less than 0.001) during zinc picolinate administration. There was no significant change in any of these parameters from zinc gluconate, zinc citrate or placebo administration. There was a small, insignificant rise in serum zinc during zinc picolinate, zinc citrate and placebo supplementation.   Conclusion: picolinate increased erythrocyte, gluconate did not.  The second study says:   Plasma Zn, the traditional assessment of Zn status, was increased in all subjects given Zn glycinate (N = 10), while no significant change was seen overall for Zn gluconate or placebo (N = 10 each).   Conclusion: glycinate increased plasma, gluconate did not.  The third study says:   Plasma zinc rankings based on area under the curve, as well as by rank results per person, were: glycinate > gluconate > picolinate=oxide. Erythrocyte zinc rankings based on area under the curve, as well as by rank results per person, were: glycinate > picolinate >oxide > gluconate.   Conclusion: This one is a little hairy. It seems contradictory because this study measured acute uptake whereas the first two studies measured long-term absorption. Remember this is 4 hours after a single dosing.  I couldn't find the full text so I don't know the actual numbers. I'm assuming here that worse than oxide means it didn't do anything. Glycinate increased plasma and erythrocyte. Picolinate increased erythrocyte but not plasma. Gluconate increased plasma, but not erythrocyte.   The glycinate clase is open-and-shut. It's clearly superior to both picolinate and gluconate. The question is, which is better, picolinate or gluconate? Gluconate increased plasma in the short term, but does that mean anything? If you look at the first study, picolinate didn't increase serum levels there either, even though it increased erythrocyte and hair. Picolinate is utilized by the body even though it doesn't raise serum levels.  Based on this, gluconate doesn't raise serum levels in the long term (first study, second study), nor does it raise erythrocyte levels in the long or short term (first study, third study), nor does it raise hair levels (first study). It only raises serum levels in the short term (third study). So gluconate is a good choice only if you want to raise your serum levels for a few hours. That's why I concluded by saying that it's garbage."
Supplements,3acfjs,shiveringhere,2,Fri Jun 19 03:15:43 2015 UTC,"The inconsistency is from you drawing your own conclusions, and ignoring the authors' conclusions.   Conclusion: picolinate increased erythrocyte, gluconate did not.   No problem here, but it isn't relevant to the question at hand (whether zinc gluconate is an effective zinc supplement for normal use).   Conclusion: glycinate increased plasma, gluconate did not.   Wrong - the authors concluded that glycinate was better absorbed, and specifically declined to offer anything but conclusions about the relative differences between the two forms (because their design could only have found relative differences, not absolute).  ...  The only argument you have that makes any sense is the difference in erythrocyte uptake of different forms of zinc.  But I don't see any evidence presented that this matters at all - why do you assume that erythrocyte uptake is relevant?  Perhaps that serum increase is all that's needed.  You might claim that the first study's results prove the importance of erythrocyte uptake.  But you don't know what those results truly imply; perhaps the increased longterm uptake in picolinate is excessive, and the subjects all had healthy zinc levels at the start of the study.  So unless you have some solid evidence that erythrocyte uptake is so important that it overturns existing scientific consensus (that gluconate is good enough), I don't see any reason to believe you."

See on the Solgar nutrition label it says ""Zinc (as zinc glycinate amino acid chelate), and compare that to the nutrition label on the NOW Foods Zinc Glycinate, where it says ""Zinc (from Zinc Glycinate) (Amino Acid Chelate)."" It's the same compound in each case, Solgar is just being a bit old-fashioned in naming their product (although at the same time, it distinguishes it from more poorly absorbed compounds like zinc oxide, which is an inorganic salt of zinc and is not a chelate.)  As for why I recommend Solgar's zinc glycinate specifically, I like the more conservative dosage (22 mg Zn vs 30 mg Zn in the NOW softgels) and the fact that you can divide the tablets if you want further dosing control.

It is not necessarily a bad thing that their long-term levels did not change, and these results might have been very different in a zinc-deficient population.   Though a 10-person sample size is a bit small for my taste, this again indicates to me that Zinc levels remained constant with control levels, rising only after administration of Zn glycinate.    It's not a matter of taste - it's a matter of mathematics.  This study was, by design, unable to detect anything but relative differences in absorption, and that is why the authors did not offer anything but a comparison between the two groups.  It does not offer any evidence whatsoever for a lack of absorption for gluconate - it only shows that glycinate was better absorbed.  This is counterintuitive for folks who have not studied statistics (and even some who have), but it is true.   This one confused me a bit, as it seemed to suggest that picolinate was absorbed to a lower degree than gluconate, but OP recommended Picolinate over gluconate while using this paper as a source.    Your understanding of the article is correct - in this study, picolinate was poorly absorbed relative to gluconate, which contradicts some of the claims made in this thread.

I've searched the internet endlessly, but all I've been able to find are dead ends in this regard.   It's 50mg of elemental zinc, at least in the United States (labeling regulations may be different elsewhere, but here, mineral supplements list the elemental).  edit:  unless the price is about the same, there isn't much point in seeking out a superior zinc supplement.  Gluconate is good enough.  It won't all be absorbed, and that is ok - 50mg would be too much zinc if absorption were perfect.

Gelatin is a type of collagen hydrolysate btw.  http://examine.com/supplements/Type+II+Collagen/  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25498544  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24401291  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24955642  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26058835  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25498544  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767063

Supplements,3abp3u,Krneki,5,Thu Jun 18 20:15:20 2015 UTC,I tried a 200:1 extract - paid good money for it too - and didn't notice any changes at all. From all the research I've done it just doesn't do much. On top of that some of the sources are quite dangerous because they contain heavy metals instead of Tongkat Ali. Good luck but I don't think it is wrth it
Supplements,3abp3u,Neuromancer311,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:45:20 2015 UTC,"Well I bought the cheapest 200:1 extract powder from eBay, but I didn't notice much so far as well. I've also read that the extract powder should be dark brown which is a proof of a quality, not bright as mine is.  Did you have better luck with any other supplement?"
Supplements,3abp3u,Neuromancer311,3,Thu Jun 18 21:01:53 2015 UTC,"I bought 2 different sources before I learned my lesson and one was pretty damned expensive. The expensive one was browner but I didn't notice any effect.  Depending on what you want from testosterone -  Maca powder I tried and that was worthless  Tribulis increases libido but not much else D-Aspartic-Acid I noticed a that-day increase in libido but then had headaches after taking it from there on in.  This will make you laugh, and maybe cry if you hate it, but my secret weapon has been broccoli for the past 4 months.  Broccoli contains compounds which eradicate the most potent and harmful estrogen in your body. The less estrogen you have the higher your testosterone is.  I take one head of broccoli a day and break it to pieces (mostly crowns) in a ceramic bowl. I add a couples splashes water and put a saucer plate on top. I put it in the microwave for 3 minutes. Then I eat it with butter and salt."
Supplements,3abp3u,Neuromancer311,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:01:13 2015 UTC,"Well that actually won't make me laugh at all, I'm aware of DIM supplement but I really didn't know that that pure broccoli can have such vast effect. I've already though of low dosages of AI like Arimidex, but if broccoli is good enough, it would be wise to give it a try. How long does it take for effects to kick in? Does it affect your libido as well? Did you perform any blood work?"
Supplements,3abp3u,Neuromancer311,2,Fri Jun 19 09:58:50 2015 UTC,"I haven't taken blood tests - I don't suspect myself to be clinically low in testosterone - but I notice it increases my libido and I consistently have morning erections when I eat it. I'd say I notice it working within 24 hours.  Be careful with the AI because too low an estrogen can be bad for libido too. Especially if it is a suicide inhibitor it will take a while for your estrogen to come back.  I think cruciferous vegetables are a better source of dim than the supplement because the components break down differently in digestion. Basically the broccoli has indole-3-carbinol which breaks down into many metabolites, one of which is DIM. The other metabolites are important.  Lower your stress! Cortisol is antagonistic to testosterone. The body makes more of one by making less of the other. Try ashwagandha or rhodiola rosea to lower your stress. They are low cost and proven to help. In addition try meditation especially if you have trouble sleeping."

Would you recommend any other cruciferous vegetables as well or is the broccoli the best one?  I've already thought about adaptogens such as aswagandha, but they are a bit expensive to use on a daily basis. Perhaps I might try some to see if they make any difference at all."
Supplements,3abp3u,Neuromancer311,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:55:55 2015 UTC,Actually cabbage has the most I3C I believe. It isn't as easy to cook like broccoli for me so I stick with that. Rhodiola isn't too expensive - usually less than a multivitamin!
Supplements,3abp3u,nevercomment,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:30:28 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't mess around with aromatase inhibitors like Arimidex without good reason. Broccoli won't have any noticeable effect on your testosterone levels, and even if you could lower your oestrogen by a little bit, that doesn't mean you'd get any effect from that. You need supraphysiological levels of testosterone to get real world effects."
Supplements,3abp3u,Neuromancer311,2,Fri Jun 19 20:33:36 2015 UTC,"That isn't true kabuto - do you have a source for that claim? It won't do anything that steroids would, no, but if a person is low in testosterone or has elevated estrogen a little bit goes a long ways."

Give me a source, you are talking out of your ass. There's only been 3 cases in all of history that linked Modafinil use with SJS. The reports that talk about this, don't mention ANYTHING about ADHD. I also did a search myself and no links whatsoever came up between ADHD and SJS. You are lying! Plus, you can get SJS from something as simple as paracetamol or ibuprofen.  So show me a source on this alleged link between ADHD and SJS or just shut up you sockpuppet. How much are the pharmaceutical companies paying you? Are they scared that people might start using modafinil in stead of more harmful meds like ritalin? I hope they are scared to death. Literally."

This is what I've been doing:   Eating slowly and not putting too much food inside my stomach. Not exercising/moving around too much/laying down straight after a meal. Sitting still and upright during/after a meal.   I've read that Acid reflux is caused by weakened gastroesophageal sphincter and I think there's not much you can do about it. And it seems to be quite common as people get older. The only cure that I'm aware of is surgery if it's really bad but surgery can be risky. It sucks that Acid reflux increases the risk of esophageal cancer.  And there's some controversy as to whether Acid reflux is caused by too much or too little stomach acid. Some online people tell you to take Apple Cider Vinegar or Betaine HCL 20 - 30 minutes before a meal to prevent reflux while most doctors tell you to take PPIs.
