I have come to the conclusion that giving free stuff to people you barely know is dumb. I remember this one guy a month ago was telling me that his guild is full of 8k-10k's and he always gave free stuff out to people, because he is a nice guy and he likes helping people. they all said they would pay him back, but not a single one of them did and he gave out like 1.5m worth of stuff. all they do is treat him like shit whenever he is in their party chat and he regrets helping them at all. so yeah i'm not saying every person you give free stuff too isn't grateful i'm just saying why take the chance on someone you don't know. sounds like complete naivety to me."

Imperial neck, the black ice has arm pen which you wont need and the impeial has recovery.

Neverwinter,3e2sbw,Winters323,3,Tue Jul 21 14:53:26 2015 UTC,"I hit 60 for the first time a few weeks ago, and I was completely lost. There are so many things thrown at you all at once, with little to no direction on how any of it works. I stopped on that character and worked another to level 60. I'm trying to take all the new stuff slowly.  For advice, I would start the Elemental Evil campaign. It gives you decent gear for the first two missions. Then start the dragon kills for Tyranny of Dragons. And theeen, Sharandar and Dread Ring."
Neverwinter,3e2sbw,heethin,2,Tue Jul 21 17:06:47 2015 UTC,"There's plenty of time and no need to slog through Elemental Evil.  Aside from the Arty Mainhand that comes from Spinward, the rest of it is filler to help you gain experience.  The gear that you get there is very temporary and quickly outclassed.  In my opinion, the Boons that come from ToD dailies are far more valuable to spend time on, and that work gives you good experience, too, and good drops (including level correct gear).... so, my opinion is that you have those two prioritized backwards.  ToD Dailies first, EE if time allows.  PS, you can get your Arty mainhand from ToD, too.  If you start early enough (lvl 26), you could probably get it faster than you'd get it via Spinward.... though the level 70 gate is still ... a gate."
Neverwinter,3e2sbw,madogvelkor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:39:18 2015 UTC,"The problem is, with the changes they just made to the XP requirements getting from 60-70, running the Elemental Evil campaign is now the fastest way to level.   You are right that Tyranny of Dragons Boons are valuable. But I've been leveling a Paladin and have gotten 2/3 of the way through ToD and only hit level 63. And that's while doing Dread Ring at the same time."
Neverwinter,3e2sbw,heethin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:16:47 2015 UTC,"Yah, I'm not suggesting that anyone ignore EE...   well... maybe...     The point is that there are a lot of benefits to working the dragons and EE only has XP going for it... and if you are right that it's more XP, I'm not convinced that it is more XP per minute.  The dragons go down mighty easily, and the daily mini-dungeons reap pretty high XP and go quickly if you join forces.  And, again, you don't have to do EE... but I'm pretty sure everyone wants the first handful of ToD boons.  The slow XP growth that you had is the same whether it's in the EE campaign or in the Dread Ring and ToD.... so, you got working on some boons, and I think that was a good move.  If you lag behind in XP, the endzone is still closer for you than it had been.... otherwise you'd be doing those quests after Spinward and you'd be tossing the XP into a very slowgrowing overload bucket."
Neverwinter,3e2sbw,madogvelkor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:00:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely get the first few ToD boons. Though the one that requires the Haarl book can be a problem if you're short on cash.   Dread Ring and Sharandar might be doable too, especially in a group. Or you can just buy a bunch of Genie Gifts..."
Neverwinter,3e2sbw,heethin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:05:36 2015 UTC,"When I say ""ToD dailies"", there may be a lot of opinions... this would be my plan:   Go to Harper Boward, get and do all of her quests and the accompanying sub-quest (requisite to finish Boward's Common Cause) from one of the nearby NPCs.   Go to every remaining dragon zone, talk to the nearby Harper, get those two quests (one will be kill the dragon, the other will be ridiculously easy).   I'm not talking about farming any dragon over and over in a given night.  In my experience, that should be do-able in about an hour and a half... then go do something else.... EE for example."

Once you follow the Module 6 zones back to 70, start looking more into the campaigns and ""figuring out"" the rest of stuff.

Neverwinter,3e2sbw,heethin,2,Tue Jul 21 14:57:31 2015 UTC,"There's some info in the guide highlighted at the top of the sub.    I think I'd work on the Tyranny of Dragons campaign... kill every dragon in the standard adventure zones once a day for a while.  No need to go to Well of the Dragons until you are 70.  If you have an alt at 60, even if you don't have any boons (they used to be a prerequisite), take both characters on the Vault of the Nine quest, which starts in Icewind Dale's tavern.  Bring a strong friend.  Look into Jewelcrafting."
Neverwinter,3e2sbw,Azaley,2,Tue Jul 21 15:11:46 2015 UTC,"I Know that feeling, was in the same situation a couple of weeks ago. What helped me the most was to start a new character of the same class. I know this sounds stupid, but so much changed since the early days of the game that it is a totally different game. Skills have changed to a lesser extend, but feats have a lot, you can actually chose different paragon paths, upgrading enchantments is different, there are artifacts... And this is just the tip of the mountain. So starting a new character helped me get a feel for the game again. I only played him till lvl 40 or so and then switched back. So only do this if you have a spare character slot."
Neverwinter,3e2sbw,dashboardrage,0,Tue Jul 21 15:20:33 2015 UTC,but this does not make sense why stop at 40 and switch to the level 60 character if you are starting over? I dont understand how getting used to the beginning part of the game (again) helps you with the level 60+ character.
Neverwinter,3e2sbw,Azaley,2,Tue Jul 21 17:21:16 2015 UTC,"Well, as I said it sounds weird, but for me it helped me get the feel for my class back. Also I don't like to blindly follow guides and like this I felt I was better able to test the abilities and feats. I could try the new Paragon Path without using a respec to decide if I liked it or not. Also I actually created the character planning to play him as my main, but when he was lvl 40 or something I decided I liked my old one better and that's mainly why I switched. But by then I also felt comfortable again playing the other character, which was not the case before. It's hard to explain and might not help everyone, but for me it was good :)"
Neverwinter,3e2sbw,madogvelkor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:22 2015 UTC,"I've done the same -- leveled 2 characters up to around 40 before dropping them to go back to my CW. I just use them for professions and invoking now.   Though once I rolled a Paladin I fell in love with it as well, so now I find myself jumping between my OP and CW."
Neverwinter,3e2sbw,madogvelkor,2,Tue Jul 21 19:22:36 2015 UTC,"Get some enchantments for your utility slots that boost XP gain. There is a really massive requirement to get from 60-70 and having an extra 40% boost will help. Alternatively, you'll want some Dragon Hoard Enchantments to start saving up refinement items. Once you hit level 70 and complete the Elemental Evil campaign you'll have some artifact equipment that you'll want to level up.   Run the Tyranny of Dragon campaign and Elemental Evil campaign at the same time. ToD isn't very time consuming, there's a limit to how much you can do each day. EE gives you 3 daily quests from the druid near the big tree, and any number of hourly quests in the  4 campaign zones you'll unlock as you progress."

You simply approach it as a banking exercise: you maintain a balance, and debtors.

Or, you could just get a really simple database app.  Or I could probably write one that does this. In-fact I'll do that - Message me an email address I can contact you with (dummy addy or no, I don't care) - I'd need some finite details to know how you'd use it, what you want it to do and all that nonsense.

Neverwinter,3e3crm,TehPuppy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:33:37 2015 UTC,"I think youre mixing up frostburn and thunderhead. Thunderhead's description goes as follows, ""when you recieve a critical strike, your armor has a 30% chance to deal lightning damage and stun nearby foes. This effect cannot happen more than once every 60 seconds""  Basically it's my anti TR enchant because any damage a TR does when leaving stealth is always a crit. They crit me, there's a chance they stun themselves and all their near by buddies which is usually enough of a thing to turn the tide in your favor when it procs. However, it's uptime (once every 60 seconds) is kinda.... ehhhh"
Neverwinter,3e3crm,anagram_of_evil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:33:52 2015 UTC,"Indeed I did mess them up. Well, that doesn't sound so bad. It would be awesome if it was 100% stun, but that might be a little to good."
Neverwinter,3e3crm,RDeviant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:36:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info on ""slow"" counting as ""control"".  It seems obvious, but in this game you can never be sure without testing.  CW abilities have some really weird/illogical delineations on what counts as ""control"" (and ""AoE"" for that matter) - in terms of interaction with other game mechanics (e.g. feats, armor sets)."
Neverwinter,3e3crm,McGreg0ry,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:24:11 2015 UTC,"Bilethorn was great back in Mod 4 and 5 for some TR's, however I'm not sure how good it would be for a GF even if used the way you explained. Procing Bilethorn on a rogue will not immediately kick them out of stealth, not to mention there are some builds that no longer lose stealth when taking damage. I'm assuming you're on XBox, so you might be better off with either a plaguefire or maybe even a vorpal for weapon enchant."

Neverwinter,3e49mk,beckylunatic,4,Tue Jul 21 21:34:30 2015 UTC,People who think GS is more important than the HP buff tend to not understand how it works. You may need to try to force your guild leader to do some reading.
Neverwinter,3e49mk,xYipyup,3,Tue Jul 21 21:14:53 2015 UTC,"Tell your leader he needs to do some research  because GS is not as important as people think.

If you run pugs a lot, having extra heals for people with little to no lifesteal and/or those who constantly stand in red can be beneficial. But if you mostly run in a competent guild, I've found the debuffs from righteous increase the rate of kills dramatically and I'm still more than able to heal at the same time. I personally feel like it definitely makes a difference on Tiamat heads even without the glow, helps shred Lostmauth and its easier to kill the spider boss before she transforms. As for mod 6, I'd agree that it wouldn't be difficult to switch to healing fully again regardless. All personal preference really."

Neverwinter,3e2lts,Im_a_cat_yolo,11,Tue Jul 21 14:00:46 2015 UTC,potion tray tip in preparation for the fight: Go into your inventory and split 1 potion from a stack( I recommend a greater potion of dragon slaying) now equip that potion to your potion tray. Now when you use this potion your potion tray will have an empty slot that will be auto filled by the soul gem you pick up. The greater potions/scrolls of dragon slaying and protection last 20 mins but a successful run usually finishes in 18 mins so don't leave it until last minute to use them. Hope this helps.

The DPS DO build he has allows you to  almost eliminate heals/buffs in your setup.

Neverwinter,3e1b6z,madogvelkor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:48:03 2015 UTC,When Mod 6 came out on PC they raised all the level caps. So common companions were able to go from 15 to 20 for free. Once that comes out for Xbox it should be the same.
Neverwinter,3e1b6z,drifterramirez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:37:32 2015 UTC,it seems to be advised against spending your diamonds to level common companions.   does this also apply to ioun stones? i feel like upgrading my ioun is a good investment.
Neverwinter,3e1b6z,xYipyup,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:11:02 2015 UTC,If you have any of the green ones yes because they dont have all the slots unlocked. Blue and higher you dont need to unless you really want the higher active bonus

Neverwinter,3e2gbl,AngryTengu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:29:45 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking.  I was also brainstorming and figure if I sell it, I could probably purchase the same amount of refining points(peridots etc.) for less AD than it would cost to purchase the diamond itself(if I play the auction house correctly)"
Neverwinter,3e2gbl,wyrmbear,3,Tue Jul 21 13:33:28 2015 UTC,"EDIT: I'm on PC, so the economy is different. XB may be better to sell, as others stated while I was typing.  Hold onto it for 2x Refinement and use it yourself. I doubt anyone will actually buy it from you at a good enough profit to make up the 10% AH cut, unless you make it competitive RP/AD-wise. The price on the AH is usually way more per RP than stacks of smaller value items (like peridots/aquamarines) and probably do not move at those prices - even during 2xRP."
Neverwinter,3e2gbl,drifterramirez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:33:06 2015 UTC,You'd be surprised...they move just fine during x2 RP.  This last x2 RP event I sold two I'd been holding onto for a long time for almost 8 million apiece.
Neverwinter,3e2gbl,heethin,2,Tue Jul 21 17:11:45 2015 UTC,don't sell it yet.  keep it till the next 2xrp then decide if you want to use it or sell it. That is when it will have the most value to you or a buyer.
Neverwinter,3e2cps,BZimmiZB,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:36:13 2015 UTC,"short answer is, there is no set ratio.  slightly longer answer is, it depends on what you're selling/buying. i've seen 1:700 for MoP(AH price). 1:900 for GMoP. 1:525 for preservation wards. and 1:1200 for epic mounts.   keep in mind these are just what i've seen in feed, expect for MoP which i've bought for 6g to 8g each"
Neverwinter,3e2cps,Boondoc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:57:29 2015 UTC,Everything I've seen is usually like 1 gold = 1-2 thousand diamonds. I just sold a Black Ice belt for 27 gold yesterday though.
Neverwinter,3e2cps,MiniCorgi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:07:38 2015 UTC,This. At higher prices you tend to have to overpay in gold

Neverwinter,3e2cps,TehPuppy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:22:56 2015 UTC,"Easiest way to get a feel for the ratio at its current state is to check the AH price of Major Injury Kits, Major Health Potions, and mounts purchased with gold. From what I've seen it fluctuates between 1 gold = 700 AD and 1 gold = 2,000 AD"
Neverwinter,3e2cps,Molon_x_Labe,0,Tue Jul 21 14:22:35 2015 UTC,As of last night gem studded platinum chalices were selling for 730 in the AH. This makes the conversion ratio of 2136 AD per 1 gold
Neverwinter,3e28lg,netstrong,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:55:01 2015 UTC,I just roll with dragon hoard enchantments on all available utility slots.

I ask because part of my job is tech support, and I know a lot of times I send replies that don't seem to relate to the issue at hand - but their intent is to rule out known issues I have a fix for and determine if this is a new issue that requires further research. I don't want to spend hours looking into a problem that could be fixed by, say, rebooting the computer (simplistic example). I have to get through tons of email each day and if there is a real, unsolved issue it might take a reply or two to be sure of that. Those short, quick replies are necessary to get at the heart of the problem.  When you don't understand the mechanics behind a program it can often seem like tech support is giving you the cold shoulder, but often they're just trying to work with you to determine the source of the problem."

I replied asking how they knew that, and if I could see this info. The never asked date or time, just that I didn't win....  I replied harshly saying this sounds like you're accusing me of lying. If you are going to do that, please show me proof I didn't win. I dont even want the item now, show me how you know I'm wrong please.  They reply we don't give quest rewards sorry for the inconvenience.   Sigh so frustrating. I really like the game, even got my daughter and a friend playing.

Neverwinter,3e15cz,Kingmdatta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:57:52 2015 UTC,"I score top bracket, and Xbox shows 38 down 18up with 17ms ping. How did this escalate to I'm constantly lagging? I almost never rubber band, and I've only had 1 Tiamat run go to complete lag crap. No other games have issues.   Keys worked fine before and after that. I updated the OP looks, like yet another bug (in a long list of them) when you die and respawn during the end cinematic."

The lockboxes that drop them don't drop anymore you would have to buy some of them, and then you just have to get really lucky.  The currency needed to buy them (Silvery Dragon Scales) also come from lockboxes, but you would have to open hundreds of lockboxes to get one.  As for the feathered cap, I'm not really sure where you would find one, if they even exist for players to wear in the game."

Im a man of honour, a man of integrity. i really hate boot and looters with a passion. Ive know its only a videogame as ive heard some boot and looting scumbags say but i dont agree. how you act in the online world is normally a decent reflection on your personality in the real world.   Even if an item worth a million AD dropped i would never boot and loot as i have integrity. I have pride and honour. yes its only a videogame but im not sacrificing those things for no one. especially a dumb videogame.  If your someone who has ever boot and looted someone then fuck you. Fuck You with a giant cherry on top. You guys are cowards plain and simple. A spineless bunch of cowards.  Ifyou were in an internet cafe and all sat around the same desk you wouldn't even dream of trying that shit as you know it will probably result in a punch to the face. And deservedly so!

My core group doesn't need a healer for draco for example, so if there is one guy who isn't doing QUITE enough dps, it doesn't mean we will boot.  but in our guild, we are clearing the content and there's a GWF sitting at 600k damage dealt, we're not going to boot him if we can 4 man it.  for the record, i'm in a different guild not OP's."

If they are contributing less than we would like but are not the sole reason for failure, they get to stay.  of course your goal upon entering a dungeon is to have fun and finish it. if someone is being a jackass and ruining everyone elses experience, why do they get to hang around? what's your goal when you queue up?  i'm getting a bit of an elitist vibe no offense.  it's like you're looking down on people because they don't have the same level of supreme patience or benevolence and generosity that you apparently have."
Neverwinter,3dye4x,WarmBubblyFart,4,Tue Jul 21 18:23:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly, none of the legit reasons are followed except for the 1st to boot one. We are almost a full guild and now there's no reason not to have a full group for any activity. I haven't ran with a random since first joining the guild, there's always people on and wanting to do things.   When I first joined, we had a random for Shores, kept trying to kick our TR and we let it go for about 5 times and even told him to stop, gave him a chance, and he kept doing it so we finally decided to kick. Only time I've been in a group with this guild that actually kicked someone. We've had people join in at the boss fight and I haven't personally seen them kicked just because they aren't doing anything. I have no problem with people joining in at the very end, and getting rewards. They got lucky and put in, it is what it is."
Neverwinter,3dye4x,HakuLIVE,2,Mon Jul 20 16:43:30 2015 UTC,"I wrote that forever ago. The wording could be cleaned up a bit for clarity. Basically, if someone is ruining your dungeon experience continually (IE: Constantly pulling too many adds that the group cannot handle or looting constantly on Greens when you ask them to stop). I probably wouldn't consider Filthy Casuals to be anti-kick. We are more of a justified kicking guild. There are plenty of reasons to kick a PUG member if they are ruining your gameplay experience.

You are welcome to kick them if it does not work out in those allotted tries.   That doesn't cut it.  The 3-4 members that were in it from the beginning could have needed as much carrying as the person they are booting.  ""Giving people a try"" is a fine start... one step further would be realizing you and your team might be the problem if you aren't taking down the boss.

It's the same for your AOEs... when you are fighting a normal dragon, you don't have to be actually contacting the dragon, your AOE just has to intersect with the circle around the dragon, and melee attacks just have to swipe through the dragon's circle.  edit:  The blue circle shows up once your character ""entered' the fight by receiving the attack, you had moved away by that point, so you aren't seeing when they intersected."

Neverwinter,3dx8n7,MiniCorgi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:02:18 2015 UTC,"I have been ""stunned"" before i'm not sure which enemie that is but this one is from the white dragons breath, Which i never entered."
Neverwinter,3dx8n7,Xhynk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:55:47 2015 UTC,"I've had this problem with the green dragon and being poisoned. I always try to be conscious of the attacks and red circles, but sometimes I get poisoned when a few feet outside of the range."
Neverwinter,3dx8n7,KileyCW,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:01:05 2015 UTC,"Possibly lag. You can see that the breath actually goes there on the ground, even though te red circle is to the left. It's as if the red circle is incorrectly showing where the move landed."

Neverwinter,3e12if,Sigimi,3,Tue Jul 21 03:29:17 2015 UTC,"Your not in stealth 80% of the time in PVE, which I assume we're talking about as you mention damage leaderboards, not even close. Even with Shadow Strike and Lurkers. The only way that's close to possible is if your running Gloaming and, if you are, your DPS output is already taking a serious hit by not running Duelists.   Shadow Strike is garbage in a non-PVP scenario because the damage is mediocre, why hit for 8k(random number don't know the actual damage off hand) when you could run Lashing Blade and hit for 30k+(again, random number). That's not to say you'd only be running one or the other but doesn't everyone know in PVE you should be running a combination of Smoke Bomb, Dazing, Lashing and maybe Wicked Reminder? There's literally no other option.  All of this isn't to say that one belt is better than the other, because I haven't done the testing, nor do I intend to, but your opinion shouldn't be stated as fact especially when your asserting that opinion based on falsehoods.  P.S. Sigimi, in one reply you say you come first or second on every leaderboard then in the next, after you've been asked to compare damage in a real situation, you say you can barely finish a dungeon due to connection issues. Just sayin'..."
Neverwinter,3e12if,JDosia,3,Tue Jul 21 08:01:57 2015 UTC,"You can argue all day long that dex is not important, if you like, or you can have an opinion that may be right, or may be wrong.  Saying that 75% of the time that rogues are in combat you don't need to worry about crit, since ""no TR attacks from outside of stealth"" is just a silly argument.  TRs absolutely need crit chance outside of stealth.  The majority of my damage comes from DF bleed, the majority of which occurs outside of stealth.  So keep saying it is not worth it, I will keep stacking it, and keep on rocking."
Neverwinter,3e12if,1mit8r,-3,Tue Jul 21 04:01:29 2015 UTC,"Never said TRs don't attack outside of Stealth, please don't put words in my mouth. What I just said is we're in Stealth about 80% of the time so rocking a Dex belt is pretty useless, 32% crit chance (excluding Dex Belt. It's good outside of Stealth but you're never really outside of Stealth since we can get back in almost immediately BUT it is good for when you're not in Stealth I'll admit that. You're on PC so I'm not sure how TRs are doing there, heard they got nerfed to shit and the only viable build is Sabotuer, Idk. Regardless I've had better results with the STR belt, probably because I'm using Shadow Strike, surprisingly not many TRs use it. Regardless both are good but I can't help but see the STR belt being more useful."
Neverwinter,3e12if,1mit8r,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:47:40 2015 UTC,"Staying in stealth 80% of the time is not feasible in PVE, simply because you will not be maximizing your DPS if you do.  Exe TRs are very very good on PC at the moment."
Neverwinter,3e12if,benihime-xbla,-2,Tue Jul 21 05:46:42 2015 UTC,"Sound thinking.  Right now without daily your second flurry will be out of stealth.  With dot mechanics where if the first hit crits, so will the rest of the dots, maximizing your crit chance is the way to go with the way duelist flurry ramps up for damage."
Neverwinter,3e12if,benihime-xbla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:45:32 2015 UTC,"The difference in dps is not noticable stop making it out like it's night and day.  I'd rather have the deflect percentage per point than stam regen. Executioner benefits from using stealth as often as possible which leaves a little over half your uptime without stealth.  4% more crit on the times you don't have stealth with 100% crit severity is still roughly  3% dps increase, higher still with a vorpal.  Base damage increase in a str belt is 4%. Lol shadow strike gtfo.  That matissa build is garbage.  Who's your rogue anyway.  Without saying who you are you have no credibility.  Rolling is a dps loss.  Eating damage with itc and high deflect to keep from dying gains you more dps than what offensive stats any belt has to offer."
Neverwinter,3e12if,benihime-xbla,-4,Tue Jul 21 04:33:34 2015 UTC,"It seems your jimmies are rustled Kappa. Look at you acting all high and mighty, 1mit8r handled this so professionally yet look at you acting smart with the curse words, this is why I prefer PC Players, so more mature than Xbox players. Mind explaining why shadow strike is horrible? You get back into stealth to deal more damage so it's a plus. Anyways enough shit talking (can we be mature about this?) my TR is Darkness Edge, most people know me (don't mean to brag), 17k GS if it even matters, been playing since launch always on first or second place in DPS. I only get out dps'd by Hunter Rangers because why the hell not? They're Hunter Rangers for damn's sake (AoE is crazy)."

Neverwinter,3e12if,kraken_mare,-2,Tue Jul 21 04:47:26 2015 UTC,"""inv me"" How about you start replying to what I said? Why were you so unprofessional? Why is Shadow Strike bad? Also I can't even play the damn game without disconnecting every 5 minutes anyways because of my unstable internet so you'd out-DPS me. Let me guess, you gonna say ""that's an excuse""? If so I'll gladly link you to a post where I state my internet is unstable and I can barely play, don't try calling bull, get some manners, people like you make Reddit look like a shit hole."
Neverwinter,3e12if,MatthewJamez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:00:02 2015 UTC,Figures.  You know my gt if you decide to stop cowering behind your words and prove what you know about being a tr in practice.
Neverwinter,3e12if,MiniCorgi,-3,Tue Jul 21 05:06:41 2015 UTC,"""Cowering behind your words"" are you serious? This is a video game, why do you have to take this so seriously that you have to be rude to a person by disrespecting them? Have you no shame? I also clearly stated I can prove my internet is garbage by showing a previous post, figures you can't argue against that, so you decide to ""cower"" behind your words. Grow up with the childish mentality you have, you're a new level of pathetic, couldn't even explain why Shadow Strike is bad smh. Learn how to debate without being rude or insulting someone.  Edit; Let me throw this here;  ""A real debater admits when he's wrong. A real debater does not curse. A real debater does not disrespect another person when he's flustered."""

Neverwinter,3dyir0,Danklin91,2,Mon Jul 20 16:00:41 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the set bonuses are terrible for TR, best getting the dex or str belt and then working towards personalised rings and neck"
Neverwinter,3dyir0,BrownSlaughter,2,Mon Jul 20 18:45:58 2015 UTC,What do you mean by personalized rings and neck? How does that work?
Neverwinter,3dyir0,Bishop_L,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:11:12 2015 UTC,The Personalized Rings and Necklaces are acquired through Jewelcrafting. You train your Jewelcrafting to L25 and get the Mithral tools. Then just wait for the rare tasks to come up and pray for a T3 success. Then make the final item from the t3 items.  You should also have a Grandmaster Jewelcrafter for this. The expense is worth it.
Neverwinter,3dyir0,deikan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:55:19 2015 UTC,"str belt is BiS for TRs, not dex belt."
Neverwinter,3dyir0,KileyCW,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:02:23 2015 UTC,I've seen this argued so many times and I totally agree with you. We do not need the crit since we always crit in stealth anyway.
