Guide on Trinus VR with Altspace but works same with JanusVR.  Just force windowed mode.  You might also need to tweak Trinus VR settings for use with the GearVR  Guide on Package Disabler app, it's actually quite simple almost don't need a guide"

GearVR,3e3ct5,bitstim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:06:23 2015 UTC,The screen blacking out and music continuing to play seems like the common behavior when the headset is taken off. It sounds a bit like your proximity sensor isn't working properly.

GearVR,3e2enr,PEEFsmash,2,Wed Jul 22 11:56:42 2015 UTC,"I usually start with the Cinema, Then move them to the Moon Cinema, then The Blue (Arctic). Then if they are Old ""The Wild"", or young ""Ashar Wars"".  It's an escalation experience. The Movie theater is like ""Wow"" (but secretly they are thinking, I can get this experience IRL). Then the Moon is like ""WOW!"" - This is an experience they can't get IRL.  Then The Blue just amazes them. They weren't expecting things to escalate like that, but they are comfortable enough with the device to just go with it.  And onwards..."
GearVR,3e2enr,Mnua23,2,Tue Jul 21 23:35:56 2015 UTC,"I usualy go like this:   Ocean Rift (meanwhile I dare to give them a controller to swimm around. That might provoke motion sickness, but greatly improves the experience.   the reason I chose this is, that the SDE is quiet gentle. The Objects are quiet complex modelled and textured (the Shark at the cage) Objects come very close (dolphines). the resolution is high and the movement is HFR (60 frames per second) and by this adds to the illusion that this animal is actually there.   The BlueVR is usualy the second. The modells are not as good as the ones in Ocean Rift but its still a great experience. MilkVR - VR Porn. I usualy use the start of ""Trekki night"" when there is not yet too much nudity, but the girl comes and sits on your lab, leans over and whispers in your ear that one could do something more funny than watching Startrek TOS X-D. Thats a sure ""WOW OMG!"" from most people, because its just...amazing to be hugged by something more or less lifesize (slightly too big) in 3D ^ I imagine ASMR videos to be like this... yeah. :P   At this moment lots people start to ask how much money something like this costs. snickers  After this I often show  Evolution of VRSE Dreadhalls (Many people I know like this one very much. I think because this is how they imagined VR games (me included) but its also their first experience of motion sickness. ;) But even after motion sickness, its this game that they ask to play again ;)  Anshar Wars (almost everyone loves this too)  Neo-the universe (JAM title) Jurassic word OTOY photos  And, next time I also include ""Night Cafe"" (just tested this 3 days ago and... wow, I like it)"

GearVR,3e2enr,Ocupheus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:33:29 2015 UTC,I show most people the Cinema because a lot of friends are skeptical about the experience.  When someone doesn't play games or buy tech they still seem to get really excited about a movie theater which is an experience they all know.

GearVR,3e2enr,aminwrx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:14 2015 UTC,I have found the blu VR really good for all sorts of people. It's very good at showing the potential for VR and it almost universally blows the mind of first time users. Plus there is nothing you need to do but watch.

GearVR,3dqrg6,hadtstec,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:16:43 2015 UTC,"You can use all Gear VR apps you have downloaded without internet. When you have your Gear VR on, go to the library, there you find all apps you have downloaded and can start them from there."
GearVR,3dqrg6,Lightstorm66,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:16:12 2015 UTC,What video? What app?   if it's a streaming video then you will have to have internet access to re-stream it to your device.  If it wasn't a streaming video and you actually downloaded it then make sure to remove or disable any Utility apps meant to keep your phone clean of junk files. Evidently there are some apps you can download that assume these videos or other material are excessive and delete them.  Some of apps and viewers have options to download or watch now (stream).  Always choose download if you have the option. Usually these are better quality images and avoid hiccups when playing back. The flip side of course these will take up more space.

For those that don't know Aldin Dynamics, they were responsible for 2 of the early amazing experiences on the DK1. Trial of the Drift Rifter, and the terrifying and groundbreaking Asunder:Earthbound.   If their earlier releases are anything to go by, you can be assured of a quality game."
GearVR,3dopb8,Mallmagician,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:19:46 2015 UTC,"Sounds nice, but does this lead to a performance drop in Gear VR or a faster overheating message?  Overheating usually doesnt seem to impact the performance in Keep Talking that much but in VR Karts the game gets way slower."
GearVR,3dopb8,Lightstorm66,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:13:38 2015 UTC,"When I did the testing with my brother, I didn't notice any speedier trip to the overheat message with Keep talking. Performance appeared to be exactly the same.  I haven't yet tested with vr karts.   Keep Talking - the great thing with this when playing with people online is you can disconnect between games whilst you play the role of expert. Play for longer!   Vr karts - I'd be interested to hear if performance takes a big hit by doing this. I suspect the hit would be minimal however, leading to an overheat warning a touch quicker, but I will try to do some testing tomorrow as I have a gaming session with my Bro scheduled."
