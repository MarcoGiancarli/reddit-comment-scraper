halo,3e2pjo,TravelingMeow,4,Tue Jul 21 15:47:59 2015 UTC,No I think it was made by an employee at Bungie. When you go to the server list it will tell you at the bottom the link to the patch. I believe it's on Bungie's website.
halo,3e2pjo,reerden,2,Tue Jul 21 16:13:12 2015 UTC,"No. Made by Bungie. The master server is now owned by Bungie.  You have to manually install the patch, since the update server was owned by gamespy too. Download it here:  https://www.bungie.net/en/Forum/Post/64943622/0/0"
halo,3e2pjo,jackibongo,2,Tue Jul 21 17:40:15 2015 UTC,We don't even need to rent servers do we? Last I read even custom games/private matches and public matches ran on dedicated servers without having to pay a penny. Same with the coop campaign it will also run on dedicated servers. So in theory all they need to do is have a custom games server browser and the party leader of a private lobby can decide whether its joinable to the public. If the party leader sets it too public then they anyone can join the lobby.
halo,3e2pjo,jackibongo,2,Tue Jul 21 15:13:00 2015 UTC,We don't even need to rent servers do we? Last I read even custom games/private matches and public matches ran on dedicated servers without having to pay a penny.   Using servers costs money and space. That's why Titanfall didn't have private matches at first because even private matches run on dedicated servers which takes up servers and resources.  Second of all I had to pay for servers all the time on the games I played on PC. On Battlefield 3 I played on a custom Rush/Conquest server that had friendly fire turned off. I payed to help keep that server running.
halo,3e2pjo,Zeal0tElite,0,Tue Jul 21 18:01:37 2015 UTC,we pay for xbox live and they have REQ cards to buy so they can fund it that way.

halo,3e2pjo,NotSoLoneWolf,4,Tue Jul 21 16:24:06 2015 UTC,"They said the game only runs on dedicated servers so unless it's impossible to host custom games in Halo 5, we're technically already renting our own server when we host a custom lobby, which shouldn't cost us any additional money.  All they need to do now is a put a server browser in place to let players filter and look through these hosted servers.   I'm pretty sure all of /r/halo has been unanimous now on the positive effects a server browser would have on Halo 5 and it's community. I just hope 343 is listening."
halo,3e2pjo,justinpyne,5,Tue Jul 21 16:55:48 2015 UTC,"The problem is that they need to get more servers for the custom servers, which costs money, which would lower the profit margins. Which would get half of 343 fired."

halo,3e2pjo,Bear_Taco,2,Tue Jul 21 19:19:24 2015 UTC,"Don't give them the option to charge for a basic pc feature. Fuck that.  Plus, it IS easy to have a server browser. All servers are dedicated now. That means we are already using their expensive resource.   The cheap resource is an index that receives heartbeat signals from the dedicated servers, and a simple tag, name, and status info about the custom game going on that server, and the server browser is basically done. A simple query will allow us to see the list of servers that are sending a heartbeat to the master. Then, join in progress handshakes are negotiated when we click on connect.   Not really that hard for Microsoft, especially for a Professional senior team of developers."
halo,3e2pjo,Gamecheat13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:41:52 2015 UTC,"All servers are dedicated now   Amazing deduction there. Almost like I said that in my title.   Don't give them the option to charge for a basic pc feature. Fuck that.   A server browser is a thing that shows you all the different servers you can join, filtered by name and population and all of that. Of course that is free.  But if you want your own custom server with your own matches, gametypes, map selection, and all of that you have to pay to rent it a lot of the time. Not all the time but often times. Since everything already runs on dedicated servers they could just implement a server browser for custom games but since that takes up extra resources and space it might be prudent to do what Battlefield on the Xbox does.  In the end, it's just a suggestion."
halo,3e2pjo,WildlifeAnalysis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:59:31 2015 UTC,"But they don't have to spend more money to implement something their servers already do.  Dedicated servers are built to accept information individually from everyone who enters it.  Granted, since no one is the ""host"" of the server, then the game is dependent on the party leader. But that isn't difficult to maintain considering that, once again, PC does this.  None of what we want out of this should require renting servers."

Because one non playable cutscene that's in basically every game nowdays is cool and all, but to be able to see yourself snatch a weapon out of the air and pop someone in the face is a unique feature no game has.  Let's do something like in Halo 2, where you could see what gun you were carrying at the time in cutscenes.  Let's add something that no game has done."

Whether the Xbox can do it is irrelevant, the money required to do the mocap for it would be insane.  You would need to accommodate for things like gun position relative to your player (else the animations are going to look really stupid) so that the spartan's arm can change to be on the right angle to the object.  This requires more mocap, etc.   It's more a man power and $$ perspective, rather than whether or not it can be done."
halo,3dyhzk,chaoko99,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:48:04 2015 UTC,It's actually dooable if they weren't using mocap. Same with how some of the halo games had dynamic feet.

Along with the Thursday War, it had to bridge the gap from Halo 3/ Ghosts of Onyx to Halo 4. The last book was a very personal and isolated story; I wish the first two books were like that. As far as Halsey going, this is absolutely how people would react after a war. That's what I loved about the trilogy, it showed how to gray the universe really was. I understand how it can be distressing to see such an established character get maligned, but I honestly think it was 343 who could have sown the seeds better.   Lastly, the portrayal of BB (the AI) was fantastic."
halo,3dy7f0,m00saca,3,Mon Jul 20 18:10:58 2015 UTC,"she had a checklist   Yea I'm sure 343 wanted her to completely rewrite halsey into a bumbling incompetant who wouldn't understand her own research without a few dozen people to explain it to her.  That's why she's nothing like she is the K5 trilogy in Halo 4, because 343 totally wanted Traviss to write her like that, and it certainly wasn't because Halsey is the sort of character Traviss, who is known for completely rewriting characters to suit her own personal biases, has gone on record as stating she hates."
halo,3dy7f0,CombineOverwatch,2,Mon Jul 20 18:19:37 2015 UTC,"I liked it, except for the part involving Halsey being a monster. Like are you kidding? I get she kidnapped kids but like, nevermind about saving humanity from extinction. It's like everyone forgot about all that.."
halo,3dy7f0,Private0Malley,6,Mon Jul 20 17:12:09 2015 UTC,"But that wasn't the original intention, right? They originally started the spartan program to fight insurrectionists. Or perhaps I'm misremembering, haven't ready any of the books in quite a while."

halo,3dy7f0,Brotein_Shake,3,Mon Jul 20 17:44:13 2015 UTC,Yeah that wasn't her original intention but fighting the insurrectionists was an incredibly bad conflict.

halo,3dy7f0,Zarazas,0,Mon Jul 20 19:27:57 2015 UTC,"Halsey conscripted children into an experimental super soldier program that brainwashed them into believing their only purpose was to serve as soldiers for the UNSC, and that program ended up killing and mutilating half of them. Spartans were deprived of their sexual desires and isolated entirely from humanity as a whole. All to fight insurgents from backwater colonies light years from Earth who feel like the UEG doesn't give a fuck about them.   Kilo Five has characters that would act the exact same as any one of us would if we lived in a world where our government did this to its own people, and that's why I enjoy it."

halo,3dy7f0,Stink_Snake,0,Tue Jul 21 01:08:26 2015 UTC,"of course not, but its still fairly violent, even if it is one of the most T rated M games ever.

halo,3dy7f0,hokiebird428,2,Tue Jul 21 01:13:03 2015 UTC,Yes I assume he either watches the dad play or the dad watches him play and helps guide him through it. Halo would be a pretty complicated game for a 5 year old to play himself. Or maybe the kid just likes the idea of master chief. Like a super hero or something. But both of us are making a lot of assumptions about how the op's son knows about halo. The only one who could clear all this up would be op himself. But from his kids drawings this all seems harmless. To him master chief is a good guy who beats up robbers and kills aliens. Replace master chief with superman or batman and we wouldn't even be having this conversation.

I don't know why I always get down voted when I tell the truth. There's been a server change over the last week -- and anyone, like me, who plays Halo multiplayer regularly knows. 343 can't wait til halo 5 comes out so they can put MCC in the trash can"

The problem is that dedicated servers aren't an insta-fix, and that there's still something up with them where they still have terrible lag."

halo,3e1u2i,DaveS1551,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:03:36 2015 UTC,I didn't downvote but I'm not experiencing that much lag. Maybe other people are downvoting because they're not lagging either. I do seem to be getting some lag issues with H3 but the other ones are running fine.   And lag is tricky one since it can be on the user's end. Has anyone done a straw poll recently to see how wide spread of an issue this is? I didn't know there was a problem until I went on reddit.

halo,3e023l,yelnats25,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:33 2015 UTC,I have played H4 aka call of duty. No originality. It's an overall shitty game and proves 343 has no ears when it comes to listening to fans. You can continue to play it with the 2500 population while halo 2 and 3 have 50x that. But wait - nobody ever wants to play the same old halo game with no changes. Hurr durr.

halo,3e023l,Fatbaticus,5,Tue Jul 21 01:26:24 2015 UTC,"...But Halo: CE PC was the port used as a base for the MCC and Halo: CEA on the 360. I mean, they improved the net code (I think, haven't played much of the MCC), but it's still a Halo PC port, hence stuff like the PC maps and weapons like the Flamethrower being included on the MCC. Not to mention how different the weapons feel compared to the original. Not to mention stuff like the lack of fog and other visual quirks in some areas of the campaign in ""Classic"" graphics. This also applies to Halo 2.  I realize that PC was much easier to port than Xbox for online due to the pre-existing net code for PC and conversion to 1080p. My point is that if Halo PC sucks, then the MCC version must also.  As for Vista, the MCC is a port of Vista because Vista already had higher-resolution textures. Plus, it was easier to port since the One is like a PC with a different OS. There was also a big a while back where if you paused then I paused you could see a string mentioning the keyboard (or mouse, this was in 2014) for a split second.  tl;dr: Halo MCC CE(A) is literally a Halo PC port, and Halo 2(A) is a port of Halo 2 Vista. So if the PC ports suck, then the MCC ports do too to an extent."

halo,3e11q3,Fabalon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:22:35 2015 UTC,I remember one game in Halo 3 on Valhalla my team basically devolved into a betrayal match between me and my 2 guests and some other guy and his guest. It started with a betrayal for the sniper (on their end) and just escalated from there. Me and my guests decided to just betray them until we were kicked but they never kicked us. So the whole match we were just fighting eachother while the enemies picked kills off of the conflict. There was one point where I noticed the entire enemy team just sort of standing on the hill in the middle watching what was going on.

halo,3e1jya,succulentjoint,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:23:38 2015 UTC,Because They like it so much they don't want to spoil it by playing too much....
halo,3e1jya,xalpha23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:28:45 2015 UTC,"Best game in the series in my opinion, but as they function on the MCC (bugs and all), the ranking should be:  H2C/H2A  H4  H3  H1"
halo,3e1jya,Strykrol,2,Tue Jul 21 14:04:55 2015 UTC,I'd agree if you put Halo 4 at the bottom.
halo,3e1jya,MartianMallCop,2,Tue Jul 21 19:05:27 2015 UTC,"H4 was pretty faithful in game mechanics to the original, minus Ordinance missing. The shooting isn't as shoddy as H3 or H1, so it wins by that alone to me."
halo,3e1jya,Strykrol,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:27:48 2015 UTC,"I feel ya. I actually just asked this in another thread, and the consensus answer there was that H3 was the go-to game for the majority of the gaming crowd in their High school years. if you like H2 or CE, you're likely over 25, whereas H3 was the starting game for most kids in the 14-25 range.  I'm also trying to get domination medals, and it sucks. However, triple doubles work for me in H4 and sometimes in H3. Assists are a lot harder to come by in H3 though, so I try to get wheelmans as much as possible since those are the most reliable way in H3."
halo,3e1jya,jfphenom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I imagine most H2 fans are already out of college / have serious employment / have a family.  H3 is dominating because those fans are probably still in college / at an age with less responsibilities.  So as an H2 fan that's graduated and has a career, I get so bummed that when I find time to play Halo, all that ever comes up is stupid H3 (like in BTB and Snipers). sigh."
halo,3e1jya,TheyCallMeKP,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:13:54 2015 UTC,I hear ya! My best friend and I spent many hours playing halo 2 so naturally that's what we vote for.  The majority of the time we are out voted for halo 3 and it really grinds our gears.  Getting really tired of snipers on narrows!
halo,3e1jya,jburm,-2,Tue Jul 21 19:28:51 2015 UTC,"Little bit of an outlier here, 20, first Halo was CE and I absolutely despise 3, despite growing up in its popularity. Broken medals, making it worthless for achievements, and a complete downgrade of Halo 2 in every way but graphics. 2>CE>4>3."

They could even add an option that pops up after a minute that says ""long queue time? Remove Filter"" so that matchmaking wouldn't be slowed down too much by it. I love the Team Snipers playlist, and I would gladly wait an extra minute or three per game to play Halo CE / Halo 2 Classic Snipers every game. I currently have to play 5 games of Halo 3 Snipers to play one of these."

halo,3e01qx,pvijay187,30,Mon Jul 20 22:29:54 2015 UTC,"Most of these you just don't know how to use them. For example the Brute plasma rifle is more powerful than the standard plasma rifle but overheats faster. I find this useful for The Flood missions.   Edit: Same with the Sentinel beam, very effective against The Flood"
halo,3e01qx,wiggles413,13,Mon Jul 20 22:40:40 2015 UTC,I don't think the Brute plasma rifle is necessarily a bad functioning weapon. I just think it is very uninspired and clearly hastily included to up the number of brute weapons.
halo,3e01qx,NotSoLoneWolf,-6,Mon Jul 20 22:42:35 2015 UTC,"Well if it makes any difference there is a Lore reason for it :D  Though 343 made it not Bungie so I suppose it was uninspired at the time! :P  And the Halo 2 Needler was just awful.  Reach Plasma Launcher was basically lock-on rockets for use against those pesky Falcons on Spire. It was just not designed for general use, only for anti-air/vehicle.  Halo 3 pistol was terrible, I agree.  Halo 2 Shotgun was less damage, but it did hold way more rounds."
halo,3e01qx,Seniorstuphey,4,Mon Jul 20 23:31:57 2015 UTC,I agree Halo 2 needler should have been on this list too. Unfortunately I feel like dual wielding ruined a lot of the weapon balancing.
halo,3e01qx,TehTacoGuy,8,Mon Jul 20 23:35:28 2015 UTC,343 made it. What!? 343 first legitimate game was Halo 4. Which didn't have it. The brute plasma rifle was first in halo 2. Which was made by Bungie.
halo,3e01qx,NickHamburgers,9,Tue Jul 21 03:52:05 2015 UTC,343i made the reason for it in lore is what I believe he meant.
halo,3e01qx,NotSoLoneWolf,0,Tue Jul 21 04:28:43 2015 UTC,No it's pretty clearly in the name as to what it's more is. This one is on Bungie.
halo,3e01qx,Albatraozz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:24:56 2015 UTC,I mean 343 made the lore reason why the Brute Plasma Rifle was allowed.
halo,3e01qx,Archelon225,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:07 2015 UTC,Wait didn't Halo:CE Shotgun hold the most rounds? I think it was 8.
halo,3e01qx,NotSoLoneWolf,2,Tue Jul 21 05:45:54 2015 UTC,"H1 and H2 shotguns have 12 rounds. H3-Reach-H4 shotguns have 6, H5 shotty has 5."
halo,3e01qx,Zanderlod,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:56:57 2015 UTC,"I think CE had 6 rounds in a clip.  Halo 2 had at least 10, probably 12 rounds."

halo,3e01qx,anatanokukki,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:30:25 2015 UTC,I meant 343 made the lore reason why it existed.
halo,3e01qx,MythicDude314,48,Tue Jul 21 18:24:49 2015 UTC,"The Plasma Launcher is actually pretty effective if you know how to use it.  In the case of the Pulse Grenade, it's actually my favorite grenade because it's so good at locking down areas. Lots of people make the mistake of bringing it into Slayer, when in reality, it's best for Objective."
halo,3e01qx,DogeMcDogeyDoge,9,Mon Jul 20 22:52:14 2015 UTC,"The beta Plasma Launcher was a very effective weapon. I loved using it, but for some reason Bungie felt the need to nerf both it and the Focus Rifle in the final game.  It puzzled me because they are supposed to be Power Weapons. Being super effective is kind of in the job description."
halo,3e01qx,JesusInMalibu,4,Tue Jul 21 00:28:56 2015 UTC,"Focus rifle I can understand, but they nerfed both weapons far too much regardless. I don't understand bungie, when people say something is OP they nerf it to oblivion. It should be nerfed incrementally."

halo,3e01qx,Albatraozz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:43:50 2015 UTC,well TLW is taking a BIG hit in the next patch. So yes. They're still keeping it up.
halo,3e01qx,SpartanA120,2,Tue Jul 21 14:42:40 2015 UTC,Yeah the Plasma Launcher in the beta was epic. Not sure why they decided it needed to be nerfed so much.

halo,3e01qx,YeoBean,-10,Mon Jul 20 23:18:39 2015 UTC,It was not a weapon that required much strategy or skill. It always felt like a cop out weapon to kill 4 wraiths at once.
halo,3e01qx,username1012357654,21,Mon Jul 20 23:25:42 2015 UTC,I think it was suppose to be a cool weapon. It never showed up often. I think it would be great if one huge MAC round hit the ground.

halo,3e01qx,ChronicRedhead,11,Tue Jul 21 15:13:06 2015 UTC,"Halo 2's magnum.  It's 13 shots to kill... and loads 12 rounds in a mag.  As I said yesterday, the only time I ever used this gun was with the plasma pistol. It was a great noob combo gun, and was good for literally nothing else."
halo,3e01qx,RB_1875,7,Tue Jul 21 02:42:27 2015 UTC,"smg with magnum combo is always good for 1 kill, but just 1.  The reload time while dual wielding is ridiculous"
halo,3e01qx,Toddlez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:40:04 2015 UTC,I tend to grab the magnum by BR tower on Lockout (and its variants) while another teammate grabs the sword and another keeps pressure on sniper tower. It's a good means of starting a match but as you said it has absolutely no staying value.
halo,3e01qx,CocaineSympathy,3,Tue Jul 21 03:53:38 2015 UTC,"Given how powerful the Magnum was in Combat Evolved, the Halo 2 Magnum felt like it was shooting paper darts.  I remember picking it up as soon as I could in Halo 2 when I got the game, expecting it to be just as OP as before, I was sorely disappointed."
halo,3e01qx,the_banana_eater_1,10,Tue Jul 21 06:51:36 2015 UTC,The sentinel beam rocks against the flood in H2!
halo,3e01qx,L0RD_SLOTH,8,Tue Jul 21 00:00:10 2015 UTC,Seriously. And the Sentinel Major beam is the bringer of doom.
halo,3e01qx,ChronicRedhead,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:12:47 2015 UTC,"I loved that one as a kid, just because it was blue and blue was cool.  It'd be cool if we saw some of those sentinels again in Halo 5."
halo,3e01qx,DogeMcDogeyDoge,17,Tue Jul 21 14:11:10 2015 UTC,"I'd add the Halo 3 Assault Rifle. It sounded weak, like dropping beads on a hard floor, and was pretty weak. It took a full clip to kill someone if you're lucky and didn't have very good range compared to other AR's."
halo,3e01qx,Albatraozz,10,Tue Jul 21 01:01:13 2015 UTC,"It was, amusingly enough, the most effective version of the assault rifle in the series until Halo 4 hit. It's still a weak weapon, but not as lousy as Reach's."
halo,3e01qx,DogeMcDogeyDoge,5,Tue Jul 21 02:44:01 2015 UTC,Did they nerf the AR from the Reach beta? I can't recall. The look of the Reach AR and the sound was exceptional though.
halo,3e01qx,ChronicRedhead,10,Tue Jul 21 05:36:34 2015 UTC,I found Reachs AR more useful than the Halo 3 one but to each his own.
halo,3e01qx,DogeMcDogeyDoge,2,Tue Jul 21 05:47:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is true. But it could have been be more useful as a primary weapon. The fact that there was bloom actually helped the weapon, given you could control your shots and kill at a longer range. H4 and 5 had very useful AR's."
halo,3e01qx,ChronicRedhead,3,Tue Jul 21 05:59:04 2015 UTC,"It's the weakest incarnation of the weapon without a doubt. The AR from CE was weak, but it hosed enemies up close. The one in Halo 3 is also weak, but it can chew enemies up if they don't expect it.  In Reach, you're better off using the magnum, which by all means is an excellent gun anyway!"
halo,3e01qx,Jacksane,2,Tue Jul 21 06:50:55 2015 UTC,I think the Reach AR was more useful than the H3 one. Had far better range. Anything past close and close-medium range for the H3 AR you may as well not even shoot.
halo,3e01qx,duelingdelbene,2,Tue Jul 21 07:27:45 2015 UTC,"While true, it's still greatly outclassed by the DMR and magnum within its effective range (of which they extend far beyond)."
halo,3e01qx,Robert_Denby,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:36:58 2015 UTC,"I used to play BTB on Sandtrap and I would rack up killing sprees with the AR. The BR is usually more effective due to range, but the AR is a solid weapon in most of the games if you know how to use it."
halo,3e01qx,Robert_Denby,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:01:30 2015 UTC,The Reach AR is way worse
halo,3e01qx,ChronicRedhead,6,Tue Jul 21 04:29:55 2015 UTC,The two worst weapons across all titles were the Halo:CE needler and the pre-patch Halo 2 magnum.
halo,3e01qx,ASRoss,7,Mon Jul 20 23:47:45 2015 UTC,"Personally, I preferred the CE needler over the H2 needler."
halo,3e01qx,DogeMcDogeyDoge,4,Mon Jul 20 23:51:03 2015 UTC,The rate of fire was just too low. Even an AR at medium range could kill you before the needler did.
halo,3e01qx,Dom1nation,4,Tue Jul 21 00:04:14 2015 UTC,"The trick was to pop a needle, reload, and hold the button along with RT. By doing this, the gun went out at full throttle. It's not perfect, but by god did that save my ass on Halo CE Legendary.   That said, it's still shit. It's just less shit with that bug."

halo,3e01qx,Beeslikesteve,4,Tue Jul 21 00:24:25 2015 UTC,"Yep, they nerfed it WAY too much from the beta. I agree it should have been nerfed, but only slightly. I felt the focus rifle killed a bit too fast in the beta."
halo,3e01qx,AbidingTruth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:34:55 2015 UTC,You should try using one from the side seat of the revenant.  The auto aim is absolutely insane.  The lock on is miles stronger than the sniper and that already locks on pretty well.
halo,3e01qx,Jacksane,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:48:52 2015 UTC,"I actually really liked that gun, i can't remember the maps name (it was on the Reach, the planet, had water in the middle with a ring around it, have various bases scattered around it) but you could get the focus rifle on the one ledge and pick people off from across the map."
halo,3e01qx,analbinos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:03:01 2015 UTC,The focus riffle is like h2a sentinel beam. Really the weapon I didn't get in reach was the repeater (or whatever it was called)
halo,3e01qx,tylerthet3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:32:33 2015 UTC,"Expect they wanted players to use it like a sniper, which made no sense and was an awful idea"
halo,3e01qx,unnamedstripper45,2,Tue Jul 21 01:49:20 2015 UTC,"Considering it had ~infinite range, I can see why they thought making it the covenant counter to the sniper would work. It just didn't."
halo,3e01qx,Castboy,5,Tue Jul 21 06:03:40 2015 UTC,"You say the Sentinel Beam was weak in Halo 3? I think there is a reason why it isn't in a single multiplayer map. That thing shredded, and it had infinite range."
halo,3e01qx,RC_5213,4,Tue Jul 21 03:01:54 2015 UTC,The Halo 2 and Halo 3 pistols/magnums were terrible counterparts in SP and MP to the great pistols in Reach and CE.

The fact you can dual wield it with a Plasma Rifle and shred through shields and health, and the Spiker's enhanced melee damage, make it such a great weapon to use in close quarters."
halo,3e01qx,Frostbite94,5,Tue Jul 21 04:03:35 2015 UTC,"It was't the most effective, but dual wielding spikers always made me feel like a badass. Just that ""wap, wap, wap"" noise was dope. It was complete shit in Reach tho"

halo,3e01qx,Maggruber,7,Tue Jul 21 10:37:42 2015 UTC,"The sticky grenade in halo 4.  It's not weak, but it doesn't function as they intended.

Horrible replacement for the greande launcher in reach which actually took some skill."

halo,3e2wgz,Yaranatzu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:41:38 2015 UTC,"Halo 4 is better. Reach was sort of a refinement of the direction they went with Halo 3 (inaccurate weapons, specific-use abilities that interrupt gameplay and prolong fights, and they scaled back on the slowness and floatiness of 3's movement. Armor lock is only slightly more annoying than the bubbleshield/regen were in 3, but both iterations were pretty terrible additions to the sandbox.  Halo 4 went along the same basic trajectory, but they scaled back in smart places. None of the abilities are showstoppers like equipment or armor lock were, they went back to accurate effective weapons, and they moved further toward the faster pace of the older games before Halo 3."
halo,3e2wgz,Itsweird,2,Tue Jul 21 19:05:27 2015 UTC,"I'd have to say Reach, in general it had more of a classic Halo feel to it and the weapons were way more balanced IMO. Not hating on Halo 4, still had tons of fun on it but some weapons were really frustrating to me. Like the boltshot (aka mini-shotgun), the DMR (mini-sniper), etc. In terms of AA, the ones in Halo 4 were a little less OP but the fact that you could customize your loadouts however you wanted to and the additional armor traits (forgot their name) was a bit of a mess to me."

halo,3e2s9s,Slenderman327,3,Tue Jul 21 14:52:55 2015 UTC,"Not much, and there are reasons why.   The game costs too much, some of the most popular games for E-sports are either free or very cheap, allowing people to easily test the waters before learning to swim, having to pay $60 before hand to know if you can play competitively first is a huge turn off for people interested in playing. Whilst fun to watch it lacks the audience, even now with some of the best official e-sports support livestreams fail to reach even the smaller numbers of other titles. Even if it did come to PC it wouldn't be on Steam or its own independent store, PC gamers (and myself) like having everything in one place, having to install a new client, making a new account and re-inviting friends would be enough to make people think they don't need it, especially with other more popular titles being out there.   IF it were to come to PC it would need to sort out the above first otherwise people simply wouldn't care. Making two versions could solve this, one being the full experience (campaign, multiplayer, forge and theatre) whilst the latter is just the multiplayer (since Windows 10 has a build in DVR). It could work, though it would HAVE to change to suit the PC platform."
halo,3e2s9s,Diseased_robot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:09:09 2015 UTC,"Probably not. There's a pretty big difference between building a good console shooter and a good pc shooter. Halo is fun on PC, but far from as competitive. Some of the reason in the past is bad porting, but it's also due to completely different shooting paradigms.   Tourneys wouldn't grow if it was on PC. We just need a consistently maintained Halo focused on being competitive, with good esports coverage and tourneys that are worth it to the pros. That will have a bigger impact than platform choice. After all, Halo was THE esport before Reach went all casual on us."

halo,3dylnk,ImMufasa,5,Mon Jul 20 23:11:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I think it is also important to specify that they should match parties of equal size. Like a team of 3 should get one random and match against another team of 3 with a random, a team of 2 get's another team of 2 or 2 randoms and matches against the same thing.  Halo is a team game, Halo 3 had it right.

halo,3dylnk,TheLawlessMan,-3,Mon Jul 20 17:39:22 2015 UTC,It did at higher ranks in lower populated playlists. Anything above 30 in Team Objective took about 10 min or more to find another team of 4.

halo,3dylnk,Sexyphobe,2,Tue Jul 21 00:11:47 2015 UTC,Nope.   I played tons of Halo 3 on 360 the year leading up to MCC solo and with 1 2 or 3 teammates and even though playlists had sub 100 people it still worked fine. We would get people within a few ranks of us and it was always competitive. With sub 100 people search times would be anywhere from 1 second to 5 min and I don't consider 5 min a every long time especially if it means I'm guaranteed a fair match. When H3 was more popular when reach was out and playlist population was in the few thousands searching would rarely take longer than 1 min.

halo,3dylnk,Mrjon2009,3,Mon Jul 20 17:13:50 2015 UTC,"They did this in MCC, but it seems to just not work, and because of this solo players suffer. And if Halo 5 adds this, then the population might stay at high levels because everyone will have a good time, making this concern irrelevant. It would only have an effect after Halo 6 comes out. Also, if 343 includes social playlists, this won't be a major problem, as they can still have fun there."
halo,3dylnk,TheyCallMeKP,2,Mon Jul 20 18:02:50 2015 UTC,This is key! 343 needs to have a Social playlist.. Some people don't have a clan to go to or enough people to fill out the party. Social will be key to keeping players happy.
halo,3dylnk,Bananas_n_Pajamas,-4,Mon Jul 20 18:42:51 2015 UTC,"Meh, parties always existed. That's not the underlying issue. Anyone can make a party after one match with randos, all it takes is communication. So the culprit is mic usage and facilitating a culture of team work.  So I suggest, instead, that you make mics required for ranked playlists."
halo,3dylnk,TheyCallMeKP,2,Mon Jul 20 18:48:38 2015 UTC,"What about teams/friends that LAN? Or Lone Wolves/FFA? They don't need mics to talk to each other so suggesting mics be a requirement is silly.  It should operate like CS:GO. If you have a team of 4, then you play a team of 4. You can and should be able to solo queue in ranked because when groups of 3 join, they will need a fourth"
halo,3dylnk,Bananas_n_Pajamas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:14:52 2015 UTC,"What do you mean over LAN? Like same network, but all still on XBL?  And obviously FFA wouldn't need that requirement, just team games.  And that's an okay solution, but IMO, 3+1 should still be able to play a team of 4. Because if not, where do you draw the line? 3+1 can only play 3+1? Can 3+1 play 2+2? What about 2+2 playing 1x4?  My initial point is really just based on my decade of experience. My most played with friends have been randos; people I've never met in real life. This came from mic dominated matches and smart folks who did callouts. Bring that back to H5 and you'll have the best game of the next decade."
halo,3dylnk,permanentperspective,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:44:16 2015 UTC,"You can LAN on the same router with 4 xboxes in the room. I did it a bunch with H3.   3+1 vs. 4 would be fine too. The point on my side is that if you solo queue you will most likely get paired with other solo queuers with the occasional group of three. That's the risk of solo queuing though, same with CS, LoL, or WoW, you take a risk because others might suck and not talk."

People who just played the games (like me) know who Buck is thanks to ODST so even casual lore fans (like me) know who Buck is.  i remember this was a hot topic a while back over at /r/halostory, i think the best guess was Mendicant Bias. Here's the thread"
halo,3e0b8h,Defguru,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:46:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I also think Mendicant Bias is the most likely answer. Though obviously we won't know till October, lol."
halo,3e0b8h,Bloodloon73,-4,Tue Jul 21 15:56:18 2015 UTC,Jorge  We'd have another spartan II.   Or someone from Halo Wars.

A bunch of people posted who they thought he was talking about and he confirmed that someone guessed correctly. The only option really out of those that would be a treat just for hardcore lore fans was 05-032 Mendicant Bias.
halo,3e0b8h,Bloodloon73,2,Tue Jul 21 02:14:28 2015 UTC,Because he was the only spartan II out of the bunch and a lot of people seem to hate Spartan III's.

The problem is that 343 does not give you the vehicles that they were meant to be played with, and the maps fall apart. Most are meant to have banshees and several warthogs and ghosts, but in match making most of the time they just give each team 2 warthogs which messes up the entire flow of the game."

That's why they look totally different from game to game, but all look similar within the game?  Also, lay off the attitude, Comic Book Guy. I appreciate that they put in effort to explain the redesigns, but let's not pretend like they are anything other than redesigns, shall we?"
halo,3dw9n6,-dead_slender-,10,Mon Jul 20 13:05:43 2015 UTC,"A simple Google search could answer that question for you. I can see where you're coming from with regards to them just being redesigns, but canonicaly they arent (which was my initial argument). Sorry if my previous comment came off dickish, but you don't know how many times I've seen complaints that have no justification."
halo,3dw9n6,justinpyne,-3,Mon Jul 20 11:28:26 2015 UTC,"It never occurred to me that they would have actually had a canon explanation for that. I figured it was one of those 'We have always been at war with Eastasia.' kind of things, where they were always supposed to have looked the way they do in the most recent game in the series."
halo,3dw9n6,browningtons,3,Mon Jul 20 11:38:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, trust me if that was the angle they approached it from I'd be in the same boat as you. Nothing worse than badly executed retcons (I'm looking at you, nanobots) lol."
halo,3dw9n6,mechawreckah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:46:09 2015 UTC,The grunt looks like a mutant crab-turtle thing that's on meth. The plasma pistol looks cool though.
halo,3dw9n6,Unknown_Form,9,Mon Jul 20 12:01:00 2015 UTC,This is absolutely brilliant.
halo,3dw9n6,mechawreckah,3,Mon Jul 20 03:50:11 2015 UTC,god that grunt is so bad looking.
halo,3dw9n6,Unknown_Form,2,Mon Jul 20 01:55:15 2015 UTC,u wot
halo,3dw9n6,mechawreckah,3,Tue Jul 21 02:35:32 2015 UTC,"Im not complaining about the design of the grunt, but since they were always meant to be a little comical in nature, this look does not go with that at all."
halo,3dw9n6,Unknown_Form,7,Tue Jul 21 02:49:57 2015 UTC,They always looked terrifying...
halo,3dw9n6,mechawreckah,5,Mon Jul 20 12:48:31 2015 UTC,That looks like it's from Reach right? these guys look kinda cute
halo,3dw9n6,Unknown_Form,10,Mon Jul 20 14:27:21 2015 UTC,lol Wouldn't be so sure about that...
halo,3dw9n6,dshagi,5,Mon Jul 20 14:37:28 2015 UTC,"Still definitely looks less like they're trying to make them look ""scary"" than the newer models."
halo,3dw9n6,TYsir,8,Mon Jul 20 14:49:55 2015 UTC,"Yes but this is a low Poly model. This was 14 years ago! I wouldn't find anything like that scary. Except the flood, they scared the crap out of me when I first played against them. Keyes inside that gravemind is a bit... disturbing. lol"
halo,3dw9n6,Multi_Lock_On,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:55:36 2015 UTC,"I know the low poly contributes but I didn't want to bring it up, it seems this is quickly devolving into a dumb internet argument and I was just sharing my opinion.  So let's end it here?  I feel like they're trying too hard to make them look creepy, you feel like they've always intended them to look creepy."
halo,3dw9n6,ShasneKnasty,3,Mon Jul 20 15:00:39 2015 UTC,"Ya, Idk why that happens but it happens. :/"
halo,3dw9n6,MontgomeryRook,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:13:15 2015 UTC,"It's from Halo 3, I think."
halo,3dw9n6,sashexander,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:16:56 2015 UTC,it better do extra melee damage
halo,3dw9n6,mysoxarered23,-29,Mon Jul 20 21:46:12 2015 UTC,I'd say 343s direction with their art is hideous (especially the new wraith/grunt) but I'll get down voted into oblivion. So...  Omg so excited already preordered!
halo,3dzhtb,Sydisu,4,Mon Jul 20 20:07:20 2015 UTC,"That looks pretty damn cool, not gonna lie"
halo,3dzhtb,AVeryStrongMug,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:07:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks, man!"
halo,3dzhtb,ClassyBagle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:56:49 2015 UTC,"Very cool looking, can't wait to watch this."
halo,3dzhtb,Dovahking94,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:17:42 2015 UTC,Glad that people are looking forward to this. It'll probably be out within the next month or two.
halo,3dzhtb,IBMflamingo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:57:14 2015 UTC,"Looks promising, you found yourself another subscriber."
halo,3dzhtb,Tearfulfriend18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:47:02 2015 UTC,I appreciate it!
halo,3dzhtb,JayyEFloyd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:56:38 2015 UTC,Too much color correction and why is Reach the only game that people make machinimas in?
halo,3dzhtb,Dovahking94,3,Tue Jul 21 04:38:22 2015 UTC,"It's color grading, and the other Halo games aren't suited well for machinima. That, and I started this series a long time ago on Reach. It would only make sense to finish it on the same game. lol"
