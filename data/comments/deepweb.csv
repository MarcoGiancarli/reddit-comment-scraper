These hidden websites make things harder on the gov.

deepweb,3dy002,TheRealTravisClous,2,Mon Jul 20 13:35:40 2015 UTC,"If you absolutely need high security, you should be booting Tails. If you are not engaging in illicit commerce it's unlikely that you actually need high security, though. Otherwise just download and use Tor Browser.  Three things are extremely important if you require anything other than ""very poor"" security and anonymity:   In Tor Browser (whether in Tails or on your normal OS), click the Tor Button, go to ""Privacy and Security Settings..."" and bring the Security Slider up to ""High."" Keep it there. Any setting other than ""High"" allows scripts to execute in the browser which have been used in the past to de-anonymize Tor users, such as the Freedom Hosting bust and the recent pedophile forum bust. Read and understand fully the ways that Tor and Tails cannot protect your anonymity, and the ways that you can ruin it for yourself. The best summary of this extremely important information is on https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/warning/index.en.html - it is relevant even if you're not using Tails. Read it all, and consider it well. Anything you do is only as secure as the operating system and other programs that you're running. If you are using a closed-source or partially-closed-source operating system like Windows, Mac OSX, Android, iOS, Windows Phone, etc., then know that any of those operating systems could be monitoring what you're doing in complete secrecy, without you ever knowing that they are. Phone operating systems are especially dangerous because of the large amount of personal data that a phone also has access to. Furthermore, if your operating system has any kind of malware on it (and if you're using Windows, it very likely does), whoever controls that malware can also defeat the security or anonymity that Tor provides - as well as anyone who is able to piggyback on their implant, as most of them are not terribly secure.    Lastly what are some things I should know about the Deep Web as this will be my first time accessing it by myself on my computer.   Expect to be disappointed, the rumors are greatly exaggerated, and there is truly not very much content.  As one final note, I believe the term you intend to use is in fact ""dark web,"" not ""deep web."" The news media have confused the two terms terribly, and this is not an uncommon misconception. ""Deep web"" refers to anything on the world wide web that cannot be found via search engines - this includes your webmail inbox, your facebook profile, corporate intranets, posts on any forum that require logging in to view topics, etc. ""Dark web,"" on the other hand, refers to websites that can only be accessed through anonymizing software like Tor or I2P."

deepweb,3dy002,AndrewZabar,1 point,Wed Jul 22 10:24:26 2015 UTC,"I'm just starting out with deep web also.

I have all mine coveted for several years once I found out that men's webcams address sell for for $0.50 each and woman's $1.00 each.  That's way too cheap. And like most guys I'm not exactly innocent when on the computer home alone.    But, the only thing I've been able to find which was supposedly a good idea to do.  Is use a VPN WITH Tor. So you have a VPN saying you are in a different country.  And then Tor splits that through several more countries etc.    But, anyone who has been doing this for awhile will no if its worth it or if the browser is good on its own.   Lastly,if you haven't downloaded the Tor Browser yet, it does tell you what to and not to do.  Like don't maximize the Tor window, because that gives the full screen size of your monitor and can be used to track you.  Don't install any plugins or extensions because your real IP can slip out.  And don't play html5 videos or flash, java, etc because they can get your real info also.  If I find anything else soon I'll post it."

deepweb,3dqv5z,TheMightyMcLovin,2,Sat Jul 18 16:06:03 2015 UTC,"can hackers get your IP and personal details if you visit their website?   Not normally. When using the Tor browser to access Tor hidden onion sites (or really any sites), you should first right click on the green onion to the left of the URL bar and select ""Privacy and Security Settings"". Move the ""Security Level"" slider all the way to High. Hit OK. That will disable JavaScript which should protect you from most malware.   can you get a virus from downloading TOR browser?   No, just as long as you download it from the official web site:  https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en   are their any things i should know about? when i was reading a youtube comment it said not to visit the twitter, because its different, so is there anything else I shoiuld worry about?   Don't log into your normal accounts when using Tor. For your stated purposes, you should probably just use the Tor Browser when accessing darknet markets.  Don't use any market links from any ""hidden wiki"". Most are scams.  Check out the darknet market superlist instead:  https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/wiki/superlist"
deepweb,3dqv5z,ziz1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:19:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not that familiar with experiencing the deep web first hand too much, it freaks me the fuck out so I generally stay away. But to answer a couple of your questions:   1: No, hackers can't just get your details from you visiting their website. The point of using something like Tor is it makes you extremely hard to trace, so a website can't collect any information from you just 'visiting it'. However, and this is IMPORTANT: DO NOT under ANY circumstances enter any of your REAL information onto any website (good or bad website it doesn't matter) while on the deep web. Always use FAKE information. Never use anything like your real name or email. You can set up a special deep web email for your separate deep web use. There are some real dark places on the deep web, and the last thing you want some of these people having is your real information. Make sure you always use an alias on any forum too.  2: No I haven't heard from anyone getting a virus from Tor and I never got one. But there is some malware on the deep web so browse with caution.  3: Yes, do not go on twitter, it is a child porn website on the deep web.   When you first go on the deep web, contrary to popular belief you will not be barraged with child porn everywhere, however while this is not the case, randomly clicking anything you like the look of like you do on the indexed web is a big no-no.   If you are on a website and there's a page you can access called, say, 'images', click with caution. If there is a random link with phrases you don't understand next to it, avoid or click with caution. If you don't know or have a good indication or idea of where something leads, don't click it.  Most importantly of all, however, if you haven't experienced any of the explicitly dark places of the deep web or seen any demonstrated and you have little idea about what's out there, then be prepared to potentially be shocked if you take a misstep.  Yes there are forums where pedophiles hang out and share tips. Yes there are red rooms. Yes there is a lot of CP. Yes you will see people on forums asking for links to necrophilia. Yes there is animal torture and bestiality.  Yes there are snuff films. Yes there is, ugh, crush. etc. etc. etc.  Be prepared. I'm not trying to scare you off it or anything and like I said you won't just get barraged with this stuff when you first go on, but if you don't move around the deep web carefully using reputable search sites or link sites then you can drift into the dark stuff pretty damn easily. And avoid viewing 'images' on there as much as possible.  There is a lot of interesting stuff on there too. It's like a trip into the weird part of human psyche. There's documents on everything you can imagine. Conspiracy forums and information. A lot of it is quirky stuff, but interesting. There's websites about coding and hacking. Interesting, but to myself not useful enough to bother using the DW."
