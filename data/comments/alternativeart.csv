Many of my cast picks for a GBIII were women, so a partial or all female cast doesn't bug me in the least, but the fact that they are abandoning the old franchise despite Aykroyd and Reitman pleading with them not to really upsets me."
alternativeart,3dmwwk,submortimer,11,Fri Jul 17 16:51:49 2015 UTC,"This. There's a ton of post-movie  stuff that talks about the Real Ghostbusters franchising out thier name and buisness. There is literally no reason they couldn't have used that as their jumping off point without having to ditch the r est of the lore.   The problem isn't that it's all women; It's the fact that the decision feels forced. It's not a reboot of ghostbusters, it's ""Ghostbusters, but now we're quirky and female!"", and there's a significant difference.  Maybe l'll be proven wrong...maybe the whole thing will feel natural and like a true reboot...but I'm not betting on it.   Edit: I dig the look of the poster, but I hate the goofy faces. The Ghostbusters are supposed to be scientists (with the exception of winston), not comedians, despite the fact that they were PLAYED by comedians."
alternativeart,3dmwwk,Firekin,6,Fri Jul 17 21:43:00 2015 UTC,"It's kinda crazy that there are hundreds of in-universe Ghostbusters stories, yet they decided to reboot them all just because Feig didn't like the idea of the world already knowing ghost exist.  I don't understand how some of the stuff he is doing fits in with the MIB style of ghost busting he is going for.  Why is a secret organization driving around in an ecto with a no-ghost logo on the side?  Why is the logo on their uniforms?  He keeps using variations of the catch phrase ""who you gonna call?"", when in this new reality there won't be anyone to make the call."

alternativeart,3dkl76,Margamus,12,Fri Jul 17 14:53:24 2015 UTC,"Super cool, but I think there might be a way to really get that theme of duality out in the foreground. In clockwise order, starting from Batman, we have Night/Day (which could be brought out in Robin's head), Fire/Water, Head/Heart, and then... Jesus and moths?   And that's tough, because True Detective is definitely a great duo, but you might want to hit the drawing board a bit on what really defines each of those characters -- does the eye really define Marty? Does the bloody tree or the crown of thorns (an awesome visual look) really represent Rust? And there isn't as clear an answer for them as for the others, but I think there is one - and hopefully that can help clean up the most ambigious of the pieces (in terms of it being hard to tell who they are)"

alternativeart,3dgixi,dasheea,2,Thu Jul 16 11:46:29 2015 UTC,"If you look up pulp magazines/comics you might find some, but they might be expensive. These types of magazines were cheap and usually thrown away so it might be hard to find some originals."
alternativeart,3dgixi,Holyrapid,2,Fri Jul 17 08:29:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not complaining or criticizing, but because I think it's interesting, just pointing out how Android 17 has been made more ""masculine"" looking in these than the original.  It's interesting because it almost feels like American media (I'm assuming it's American from the pulp fiction look) cannot accept a feminine-looking straight male, while, of course, as the original Android 17 shows, Japanese media has no problem with it.  Just an observation."
alternativeart,3dgixi,altxatu,4,Thu Jul 16 09:54:37 2015 UTC,"If i'm not mistaken, 17 and 18 are twins. I know they're siblings, but what makes me think twins is the fact that the pair are almost identical. Just give 17 blonde hair and you have practically flatchested 18"

alternativeart,3dgixi,daRoach,3,Thu Jul 16 13:32:50 2015 UTC,You do know that is a textbook racist statement right?
alternativeart,3dgixi,Aboxingspacecraft,2,Thu Jul 16 18:53:20 2015 UTC,"Shit, I didn't mean to come off as racist, just an observation..."
alternativeart,3dgixi,daRoach,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:34:21 2015 UTC,Well it's an obviously racist statement because you are generalizing Asian people. How can you say that most Asian dudes look like chicks and most Asian chicks like dudes? It's a hyberbolic statement. It's really insane to think that you know what most Asians look like.   I know you were probably just being more casual about it and not meaning it literally but your words mean different stuff to different people depending on a lot of different things. That's casual racism. Because you are so casual about it and don't think it's racist. But yea.
alternativeart,3dgixi,Aboxingspacecraft,2,Fri Jul 17 05:18:52 2015 UTC,So... Am I a racist or not? I really try not to be one.
alternativeart,3dgixi,daRoach,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:08:51 2015 UTC,"If you don't want to be racist don't make overly generalized statements about entire races of people.   I think what you meant when you said taht most asians look like the opposite gender they are is: ""I've noticed that some Asian people I have seen look androgynous.""  When you say most _____ looks like _____. that is an overly generalized statement. It shows you are not thinking of people on an individual level, but lumping a great many individuals into this category you created in your brain to make processing information more easy on yourself.   Just don't generalize or make assumptions. That's what racism is. Assumptions about individuals based on beliefs that are impossible to reinforce with any sort of evidence."
alternativeart,3dgixi,dasheea,5,Fri Jul 17 23:37:44 2015 UTC,"Conversely, Japanese Android 18 is pretty masculine-looking, but in this ""American pulp"" version she's actually hot."
alternativeart,3dgixi,Smurf06,2,Thu Jul 16 13:30:42 2015 UTC,"You're right that the original 18 is kind of masculine-looking (IMHO kind of masculine-looking, not pretty masculine-looking).  That works to make 17 and 18 look more similar.  But she's still hot."

alternativeart,3c8p61,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:38:24 2015 UTC,"Lunch atop a Skyscraper:       Lunch atop a Skyscraper (New York Construction Workers Lunching on a Crossbeam) is a famous black-and-white photograph taken during construction of the RCA Building at 30 Rockefeller Center in Manhattan, New York City, United States.  The photograph depicts eleven men eating lunch, seated on a girder with their feet dangling 256 meters (840 feet)  above the New York City streets. The men have no safety harness, which was linked to the Great Depression, when people were willing to take any job regardless of safety issues.  The photo was taken on September 20, 1932 on the 69th floor of the RCA Building during the last months of construction. According to archivists, the photo was in fact prearranged.  Although the photo shows real construction workers, it is believed that the moment was staged by the Rockefeller Center to promote its new skyscraper.  The photo appeared in the Sunday photo supplement of the New York Herald Tribune on October 2. The glass negative is now owned by Corbis who acquired it from the Acme Newspictures archive in 1995.  Formerly attributed to ""unknown"", it has been credited to Charles C. Ebbets since 2003   and erroneously to Lewis Hine. The Corbis corporation is now officially returning its status to unknown although sources continue to credit Ebbets.

alternativeart,3bnhjm,Deviantart-Mirror,0,Tue Jun 30 22:43:04 2015 UTC,"Crafting in minecraft is just the same. It goes somewhere and just ends, gets boring fast. Minecraft mining is just inherently more interesting due to being 3-D. Also the building is much better due to the 3-D aspect. Plus Minecraft has loads of mods that add tons a depth to the game.  Terraria has better weapons /spells /equipments /items /bosses /biomes /monsters/ block skins/ decoration items. It beats Minecraft in every direction with so many things. In a one shot play through of 15-30 hours I think Terraria is far more fun and engaging. And can maintain that many hours of interest from beginning to end. Minecraft doesn't have good progression. I have only ever gone back because I am a builder and I feel that is the funnest aspect to Minecraft. Terraria I will actually go back to play through it all about once a year or 2."

alternativeart,3bftja,Deviantart-Mirror,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:10:45 2015 UTC,I just started watching Inuyasha for the first time. Such good vilains.
alternativeart,3bftja,TehBoomBoom,2,Sun Jun 28 23:01:11 2015 UTC,"The 1st Season was really what got me started on Anime that wasn't Gundam. I loved it, its setting and the bad guys, the feelings it invoked in and how well everything evolved and fit together. Season 2 was still but it fell into a rythm and lost a little something along the way. By season 3 I was watching based on momentum hoping it would come back around. I picked Season 4 up years later and watched through and was really hoping to just finish the story by this point. I forget where the seasons are divided at this point but you get to the end of the Show and there are things that have come back up to quality like the episode storylines and romantic plots but Inuyasha and Kagome are still doing the ""Will they/Won't they"" bullshit until the very last episode of the additional 26 episode Season they put out after the Inuyasha show had finished.  Inuyasha is great in early seasons because it is a show about budding romance, adventure, and character growth. As the show goes on it has the same problem as every other infinite anime: Characters become OP so adversaries must be even more so. By the end of the regular show's run Inuyasha is essentially a demi-god from the powers he's picked up and for reasons I won't spoil for you but you shouldn't read into too much.   Watch it and enjoy it for as long as you wish. If you finish it I'll be happy for you but I'll also share your pain."

FYI there are artists who can do this intricate work and detail... like others have said, if you want this exact detail, it will need to be quite large. However, as also mentioned, the more intricate and fine detailed it is, the sooner all those tiny little details will run together. It will look amazing for 3 years and then start looking more and more like an out of focus photo. A smudge here, a slightly bleeding line there (where the ink starts wandering).  Get an artist to simplify it and it will look good and crisp, plus touching it up 10 years from now will be easy and make it look like new again."

There's already the perfectly acceptable dA somewhat based on their old logo, and also to make it clear it's not Russian saying yes.  I supposed you could have very easily misspelled deviant. But even that is kinda of a stupid shortening since you're only losing three letters, and that only matters in tweets and text messages (i would call them SMS but does ANYONE call them that anymore and know what SMS even means)"

alternativeart,3a12h6,razerxs,80,Tue Jun 16 11:53:13 2015 UTC,i like how this realistic interpretation isn't trying to be overly creepy. It looks just realistic.
alternativeart,3a12h6,Alili1996,14,Tue Jun 16 12:26:12 2015 UTC,"Back when I was into Digimon, there was a fad to make them realistic, like how they'd look in our world. Most attempts you can imagine, smaller eyes, clearer fur, more proportionate limbs, etc.  I remember one person saying, if these are supposed to be monsters, why do they have to change at all? Why can't they just be transposed onto our world. It sounds silly, but that statement changed how I look at art significantly, about interpretation vs intention, about realism vs aesthetics, etc."
alternativeart,3a12h6,cakedestroyer,4,Tue Jun 16 20:54:52 2015 UTC,"Lilo's facial features shrink to become more realistic so it follows that Stitch's might have as well.

alternativeart,398gmj,Sysiphuslove,4,Thu Jun 11 01:02:11 2015 UTC,"I really like this one. I loved how there was one impression that came across on first glance - I just saw the man's eyes directed at the forefront of the picture, his slightly hunched posture, and given his juxtaposition with the pink-shoed girl I thought I was seeing someone being creepy.   And then I spotted the My Little Pony box on his lap and the whole feeling of the picture changed. Now he looks adrift, introverted and a little sweet, misunderstood by me as the viewer and by the look of him the whole world too. Instead of creepy, his gaze looks careful and slightly accusatory now.This is a kind of scene and a kind of individual that is iconic of this age.   It reminds me of  The Irritating Gentleman by Berthold Woltze, because you see one thing at first and another in a moment, and it's a scene of people thrown together in transit, an intensely personal scene in the midst of a non-audience of a crowd. (edit: the big difference is that this picture quietly confronts, protests to and accuses the viewer, where Woltze's painting appealed to the viewer for help. It's appropriate though.)   This is really fucking good in my opinion, I love it.  edit2: Notice how the only other defined characters in the picture are young girls. They are implied to be the rightful heirs of his secret love, but his gaze only accuses the viewer, silently defends his right to it."

alternativeart,39144a,moichido1,2,Tue Jun 9 02:41:46 2015 UTC,"The movie should definitely be viewed after you've watched the series. There's stuff in it that's most definitely not going to make sense unless you watched the series, and there's unfortunately some spoilers too so hopefully you don't remember much from it.   I would highly recommend giving it another go.   Be sure to not skip the pilot!"

alternativeart,38nunr,razerxs,136,Fri Jun 5 12:42:46 2015 UTC,I've seen these before and honestly it just proves that Disney did a TON of research to make them accurate enough but yet functional in the roles the characters played.  Some of these pictures are literally just the Disney princess with a different hairdo or a little more makeup.    Good show Disney.
alternativeart,38nunr,Backpacks_Got_Jets,24,Fri Jun 5 13:09:24 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Most of the major changes are to make the dresses bigger, but that wouldn't have worked very well in the context of the movies."
alternativeart,38nunr,shadowman90,19,Fri Jun 5 14:26:32 2015 UTC,"And more detailed. I could see ""real life"" Snow White wearing the top dress, for example, but it would have been to expensive to animate it in the 1930s."
alternativeart,38nunr,hypo-osmotic,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:11:23 2015 UTC,"Eh, they showed supposedly Chinese people wearing Kimonos in Mulan. Seems like a pretty big oversight."
alternativeart,38nunr,butistillwork,-4,Thu Jun 11 22:36:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, they were well done but a few don't make much sense. Cinderella was a maid and wouldn't wear the large dress for most of the movie her sisters did wear the bigger dresses the only error might be her ball gown. Snow White lived in the forest so hers would also be peasant garb. Same goes for Aurora who was in hiding for most of the movie. Ariel probably should have been given a different dress but I don't remember anything about Eric's mother or any other noble women in the castle so they may have asked one of the servants for a dress to borrow as they didn't have anything better on hand. Though they found her wrapped up in a ship's sail so I would've given her cheap clothes too. Belle was a peasant so her clothes wouldn't be grand. I have no real issue with any of the others I can think of. Why were most of the princesses either not princesses or in hiding?  Edit: BTW anyone have a DA on this or something?"
alternativeart,38nunr,bananenkonig,22,Fri Jun 5 17:57:37 2015 UTC,"Wait, Belle is a French noble in the 1770s? Hopefully she and the Beast get out in the next couple decades 😰"
alternativeart,38nunr,VikingofRock,20,Fri Jun 5 16:46:58 2015 UTC,"I would totally read a fanfic of Beauty and the Beast set during the French Revolution. Make Beauty a young, idealistic revolutionary and Beast a symbol of staunch aristocracy, and baby, you've got a stew going."
alternativeart,38nunr,alexanderwales,4,Fri Jun 5 21:57:55 2015 UTC,"This is actually one of the reasons I advocate for shorter copyright durations. Look at all the crazy reimaginings we've seen of Alice in Wonderland, or of Lovecraft's work, of Jules Verne and Mark Twain and motherfucking Shakespeare. What amazing works are we missing right now because people aren't legally able to riff off classic Disney movies?  The original copyright was 14 years, or 28 years with an extension. If we still had that copyright term, The Little Mermaid would hit public domain in two years, and some crazy motherfucker would make an interpretation where Ariel was a cyborg on Mars, and I would fucking watch that thing."
alternativeart,38nunr,ZorbaTHut,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:44:30 2015 UTC,"I think you'd be fine to re-imagine those stories as long as you didn't rip off Disney's designs. So don't give Belle a poofy yellow dress, maybe give Ariel different hair colors, etc. I mean, those are fairy tales, right? Does Disney own the story itself or merely their interpretation of it?   Also why are you getting downvoted? I'd watch the fuck out of Cyborg Ariel."
alternativeart,38nunr,rainbow-sailor,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:28:55 2015 UTC,"Disney owns their interpretation only, but there's always major aspects of the Disney version that are Disney-specific. The Little Mermaid is based on a Danish fairy tale, but it's only loosely based on that, and basing something off that fairy tale would make it vaguely recognizable at best - the Disney variant is the variant that's become a major cultural touchstone."
alternativeart,38nunr,ZorbaTHut,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:21:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know that. I've read a lot of the original versions, some in their native language, which can be fun to see how things are translated!   The Little Mermaid (the original) gave me fucking nightmares, though. Like, JFC. It was dark."

alternativeart,387f58,razerxs,7,Tue Jun 2 11:42:08 2015 UTC,"There's an awe inspiring duality to The Legend of Zelda as a whole. Yes, there are quaint, cute things happening around you in the overworld, but once you scratch that surface, there are horrible, ugly things that are waiting to engulf you. Not just Moblins, either; what sacrifice could mean for a person, the terrifying strife a warrior has to go through, how loss can affect one's psyche. These pics captured that duality perfectly."
alternativeart,387f58,infernalspawnODOOM,6,Tue Jun 2 18:31:21 2015 UTC,"I think Ocarina captures this extremely well when you travel in time between Hyrule Castle Town. The joy and life from youth and the grim, dead world of the future."

alternativeart,37jwu3,ChiefWolff,3,Thu May 28 06:47:20 2015 UTC,"There is technically two Quicksilvers, there is the one you see in X-Men: Days of Future owned by FOX and then there is the one in Avengers: Age of Ultron by Marvel/Disney. Fox owns X-Men and in extension all their villains (I know he is and isn't one bear with me) along with their backstories. Marvel can get around this by not mentioning the word ""mutant"" in their movies, the X-Men in general, and none of their origins. That is why you see Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch in those Hydra cells and called ""miracles"" at the special scene in the latest Captain America movie.   This relationship is very contentious as FOX does not really play nice with others. Marvel cant even mention that Magneto is their father. In short, both Quicksilvers can run fast, however they cant be the same age, origin, physical appearance, and costume.   TLDR:Marvel can use Quicksilver and his abilities so long as he is nothing like his FOX counterpart."

A New York Times bestseller,  it was a sequel to an earlier crossover, detailed in the Marvel Comics one-shot Second Contact (which was itself similar to an earlier Star Trek/X-Men crossover comic, where a slightly different team of X-Men encountered the characters of the original Star Trek series). The novel is noteworthy for hinting at an attraction between Jean-Luc Picard and Ororo Munroe (Storm), and made a forward-looking reference to the (then uncast) X-Men feature film by remarking on the uncanny resemblance between Picard and Xavier, as the two converse via the holodeck after a reasonable facsimile of Xavier is programmed into it; (both characters were played by Patrick Stewart in Star Trek: The Next Generation and the X-Men film series).

I think that the first movie made its budget back, and a little bit of profit, but then it was very very big on video and DVD. The story repeated itself with the second already, it made its money back at the box office, but a small margin of profit in the release of the theatrical print, but was very very big on DVD and video. Sadly now from a business point of view all the studios know is that you don't have that safety net of the DVD and video, so they view the project as dangerous. Creatively, I would love to make it. Creatively. But it is proven almost impossible to finance. Not from MY side, but from the studio side.

alternativeart,342ewj,heart-station,16,Mon Apr 27 19:46:32 2015 UTC,"The shoes are terrible, aside from that great work.  While an orange jumpsuit is stupid it is a perfect item to sum up Naruto's personality. He is brash and faces challenges head on rather than use stealth. He is incredibly high energy almost to a fault and orange is the perfect color to show that. Naruto wears orange because he want's people to notice him above all else since he is an outcast. It also serves as a metaphor to show that even though he tries it just makes him fit in less with the crowd. Unless you can make the same argument, that putting the form over function is essential to the character, I believe  it is your retort that is invalid and not peoples complaints.  Heels don't work for the ninja world of Naruto. Kunoichi are still trained soldiers and would put function over form, in this case wearing sandals instead of pumps that in this picture just feel silly and out of place for the show and for this picture.  Take your Sakura picture for example. It is also an alternative from Kishimoto's style in the same way that this one is. But the thing that I like about that one is that it all fits together well. From the half vest to the torn gloves down to the sneakers. It all works giving off the feel of sexy but also bad ass. Here it just all falls apart at the shoes for me, they just seem so out of place."
alternativeart,342ewj,Daahkness,4,Mon Apr 27 22:57:04 2015 UTC,"I'm no where near a fan of naruto, but I've watched some episodes, from what I can remember, nobody really ninjas in that show"
alternativeart,342ewj,Sarcastic_German,6,Tue Apr 28 05:08:33 2015 UTC,"It's true, but op was annoying with how s/he dismissed people's comments.   Most of them don't wear things as outlandish as Naruto orange. The actually ninja-y ninja the Anbu are more traditional ninja y"
alternativeart,342ewj,Daahkness,0,Tue Apr 28 06:37:53 2015 UTC,"I suppose you're right, but I do like the high heels, reminds me of the female rogues from Ragnarok online.  I remember an old show, Ruroni kenshin I think it was, where a female assassin also wore slight high heels because it protected her feet from spikes and such, just my two cents though."

That being said, Ino is a very vain character so yeah, I could see her trying to rock some heels on the battlefield. Furthermore, going into combat with your toes exposed isn't practical either, especially when there are people who use fire and ice powers regularly. People are making a logic argument about a series that's not grounded in logical design. So yeah, I'll throw that orange jumpsuit in your face and struggle as you may to explain that, the rest of the designs are as equally indefensible as high heels. I feel commenting on the heels is needlessly pedantic. Just like or dislike the art for what it is. Also, I don't think it's the massive problem you make it out to be"

alternativeart,32xpw4,El_Zalo,2,Fri Apr 17 16:32:03 2015 UTC,There's a third series. Mars something.
alternativeart,32xpw4,bad_pie,2,Fri Apr 17 16:33:06 2015 UTC,"I read the first series at 19-years-old and loved it more than anything. I was stoked when the second series, Last Order, came out but couldn't even finish it. Does anyone else think it was boring or did I just get too old?"
alternativeart,32xpw4,bad_pie,2,Fri Apr 17 17:15:09 2015 UTC,I'm way past 19 and greatly enjoying my first read. Opinions vary.
alternativeart,32xpw4,El_Zalo,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:26:32 2015 UTC,"I've thought about giving it another try. At the time, I had a really hard time with how he redid the ending of the first series because I thought the ending was so perfect."
alternativeart,32xpw4,bad_pie,2,Fri Apr 17 17:31:25 2015 UTC,"The ending of the first series was rushed because Yukito Kishiro was having health issues at the time and needed to finalize the series. The ""retcon"" of the ending that leads into Last Order is how he intended the story to unfold in the first place.   EDIT: Having said that, I think the ending to the first series was very satisfying and I agree with you that Last Order is not as interesting or enjoyable as Gunm. While the original felt like a journey, Last Order a lot of times feels like an extended single volume full of over the top action."
alternativeart,32xpw4,manasource123,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:23:27 2015 UTC,"That's why I was so excited. I thought that if that's not how he intended it, the real ending must be even better."
alternativeart,32xpw4,El_Zalo,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:47:18 2015 UTC,"I agree somewhat. I liked that the original series is a complete journey, and there's a real mystery distopia element to it also.   That said, I do also like Last Order (LO) a lot. I like the alternate retcon'd ending, and I love the fights and action of LO, though I can see how someone would not like the direction the story takes and could get tired of the action. LO does sort of turn into DBZ/Bleach/Naruto after awhile... just some story to fill in between the next epic fight. You do get to see some awesome stuff in LO though, I LOVE the vampire girl's back story chapter, its one of my favorite chapters I've ever read in any manga."

alternativeart,32xpw4,manasource123,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:05:06 2015 UTC,"Did you read the third series? If so, what did you think of that one compared to the original?"
alternativeart,32xpw4,manasource123,1 point,Fri Apr 17 22:39:40 2015 UTC,I haven't. I actually didn't know there was a 3rd series. LO was still being written when I was reading it.

alternativeart,32xpw4,manasource123,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:03:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think what makes Gunm so awesome (to me at least) can be captured in a single movie. The best part is how the whole series is a journey of self discovery for Alita and that is achieved though interactions with many different characters and events at different stages of her life. Many of these ""stages"" have noticeably different narrative tones, which would be jarring if put all together in a single movie, IMO."

alternativeart,31ym72,Siarles,2,Thu Apr 9 17:26:34 2015 UTC,"I think there are hints that the Tiger is more than anyone realizes, the show just never got around to demonstrating it. I mean, think about it: the talismans were created by (from?) Shendu, a demon. The Tiger talisman was only ever used in the show to split a person, creating one body that was pure yin and one that was pure yang. But demons are pure yin, so Shendu never had a use for that power, so why did he need the Tiger in the first place?  In the episode where the Tiger talisman is first discovered, Shendu calls the Tiger talisman ""the glue that binds the conflicting powers of all the other talismans into one unified whole"". The word ""conflicting"" here is the key; it also has the ability to bind the conflicting energies of yin and yang into a single unified body.  I believe the Tiger's true power is ability to combine things that can't normally be combined, as well as to reverse the process, separating things that can't normally be separated. You could, for instance, combine oil and water into a fluid that demonstrated properties of both, or split atoms without all the normal consequences."

Some words from the artist about this piece:  A tribute to Sir Terry Pratchett.  I have read his books while growing up and they're a huge influence on me.  ""We should aim for a good and rich life well lived, and at the end of it, in the comfort of our own home, in the company of those who love us, have a death worth dying for."" Terry Pratchett, rest in peace.  My favorite Discworld book is Feet of Clay, totally brilliant. Hogfather and Night Watch come a close second. For non-Discworld books, my fav has got to be Good Omens. I remember the first time I read it, standing in a second-hand bookstore and laughing my head off.
