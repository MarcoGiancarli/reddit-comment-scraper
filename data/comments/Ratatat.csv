Ratatat,3e0lqm,projectvenway,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:09:42 2015 UTC,Mike Stroud answered the question of their naming scheme here.   Our song titles usually don't have anything to do with anything though...just a word that sounds good with the music.
Ratatat,3dukcy,Connor_Cleve,6,Sun Jul 19 16:54:21 2015 UTC,"They're mostly just random faces that he drew from newspapers and magazines, with a few celebrities in there.  As for ""Magnifique,"" that seems pretty self explanatory to me.  They may feel that this album is their finest work, or that it is ""Magnifique.""  They are correct, of course."
Ratatat,3dukcy,Rocktave,2,Sun Jul 19 21:49:18 2015 UTC,Could you give me a source? And I was starting to think the same thing about the name. I read that they scratched 50 something tracks because they didn't believe it was good enough. They truly are perfectionists.
Ratatat,3dukcy,Bondle,4,Sun Jul 19 22:14:17 2015 UTC,"The reason it is called magnifique is because each song was rewritten at least two times. The finely made each chord and each beat to try and make it their best work. I personally liked the old, weird RATATAT but you have got to admire their craftsmanship."
Ratatat,3dukcy,Family_Shoe_Business,-1,Mon Jul 20 05:11:15 2015 UTC,"They have mentioned the thing about the faces in almost every interview they've given for this album it seems. Just look up recent interviews and you'll find it.  Not trying to be a dick, just saying you can find it easily yourself."
Ratatat,3dp0zo,pfistacuffs,2,Sat Jul 18 02:06:34 2015 UTC,can't wait to see them at the Riviera.  Going to cry dance my balls off.

Ratatat,3dn4a1,forrestjunior,8,Tue Jul 21 08:27:01 2015 UTC,"Something about the subtle guitar sounds in ""Countach"" are so exciting to hear.  ""Magnifique"" is beautiful.  I wasn't really feeling ""Nightclub Amnesia"" when I first heard it, but after a few listens, it's insanely good.  And I have been waiting four years to finally hear the studio version of ""Pricks of Brightness"" -- it was worth the wait!"
Ratatat,3dn4a1,Thenickd,6,Fri Jul 17 20:37:36 2015 UTC,ROME! Such an epic build and drop and resurge of awesomeness!!!
Ratatat,3dn4a1,OrangePyromancer,5,Fri Jul 17 20:42:18 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't decide, they're all pretty fantastic!  If I was forced to choose though, it'd probably be either Pricks of Brightness or Rome."
Ratatat,3dn4a1,YoungMustard,2,Fri Jul 17 17:24:02 2015 UTC,"Definitely between Pricks of Brightness and Supreme for me but I'm with you, they're all great"
Ratatat,3dn4a1,OutsideOwl,6,Mon Jul 20 13:30:58 2015 UTC,"Abrasive is by far my favorite, i love the intro and outro so much."
Ratatat,3dn4a1,SirKendrick,3,Sat Jul 18 04:33:45 2015 UTC,"I was confused when you mentioned Rome and I Will Return because I didn't see in on the album in my library. Then I realized iTunes never downloaded them....  But my favorite would probably be Magnifique. But honestly I love them all, if I had to pick that would be it."
Ratatat,3dn4a1,SirKendrick,3,Fri Jul 17 17:17:16 2015 UTC,"In terms of really unique, different songs, I think for sure this is their best album to date. On their previous albums there were at least on or two songs that were quite samey, and that I never really listened to more than a couple of times. On this album, every song is different, and all of them stand out."
Ratatat,3dn4a1,Mrhead1012,2,Fri Jul 17 17:20:29 2015 UTC,"I agree. I love how different they all are from another. I hope the keep it like that in future albums.   I think what I always like about Ratatat is their ability to have super relaxing songs like Magnifique and also super catchy, fast paced songs like Nightclub Amnesia. Iv seen it throughout all their albums and its what really made them one of my favorite music groups"

Ratatat,3dn4a1,austinrocssocks,4,Fri Jul 17 18:40:15 2015 UTC,"Rome makes me what to put my fist in the air like that famous Freddie Murcury photo. For me, Rome is like if you took Breaking Away, Lex, and 17 Years and had a child.  I went whitewater kayaking last weekend and had it in my head as I tackled the big rapids!  Cold Fingers, Nightclub Amnesia, Picks of Brightness are also really good. Someone on here described Drift as 'doofy' , but it's so chill and cool, i love it! Abrasive also just makes me happy and puts me in a good mood!"
Ratatat,3dn4a1,jordanthejordna,4,Fri Jul 17 19:02:08 2015 UTC,"I'm suprised by the lack of people saying Pricks of Brightness! That's been my jam since I found it like 2 years ago on youtube of them playing it live.   Anyway, that, Abrasive, or Drift. This album is so good guys.."

Ratatat,3dii08,theoldcrow5179,2,Thu Jul 16 15:34:34 2015 UTC,Their favorite song to play live  Their most influential Artists  Their countach
Ratatat,3dii08,Thenickd,2,Thu Jul 16 15:52:18 2015 UTC,"Can they tell us an story/anecdote about the creation of magnifique?  Why do they choose a french word for the title of the album? And why Magnifique? (French here :) Will they collaborate with other musicians for a 100% real instruments concert?    BONUS : Currents (Tame Impala) comes out on july 17th too. What do you think of Tame Impala music?  I'm going to Django Django concert eheh, if someone can ask these questions for me, it would be great."
Ratatat,3dii08,jcrisch,2,Thu Jul 16 16:33:43 2015 UTC,"Any plans to visit UK? Like... at all...? Are there any more music videos being planned for Magnifique's tracks, or are you sticking with just the three? Should we be expecting another 5+ year gap for the next album, or are you guys more confident that it will come out in a shorter time?"

Ratatat,3dhino,SorryNotSorry1337,16,Thu Jul 16 09:06:43 2015 UTC,"I couldn't disagree with this review more.  Why people place any confidence in the snide, condescending opinions of another self righteous reviewer with a complete lack of humility and taste is beyond me.  Especially when it comes to music.  I never did like the pretension of music reviewers and this guy is as bad as it gets."
Ratatat,3dhino,Rocktave,8,Thu Jul 16 13:04:12 2015 UTC,"I can't help but dismiss certain reviews like this one. Obviously Ratatat just isn't their style. Sure, all Ratatat stuff sounds similar to an extent, but they've put out 4 albums so far (soon to be 5) and I've loved just about every song. They all sound different enough that they're each unique. This guy just doesn't seem to understand that."
Ratatat,3dhino,jayfeather314,8,Thu Jul 16 13:07:43 2015 UTC,"This album is aptly named.  I kept thinking ""Did this guy even listen to Rome?""  It has everything he claims the album is missing, in his arrogant, tone deaf short-sightedness.  They managed to build upon their signature sound, and I couldn't be happier with the result.  Even compared to LP4, which is brilliant in its own right, you can tell they've come a long way."
Ratatat,3dhino,Rocktave,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:15:53 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Well-said. They built upon the Ratatat style which we all love, while changing enough to produce new, quality content."
Ratatat,3dhino,jayfeather314,5,Thu Jul 16 18:17:41 2015 UTC,I wouldn't even call it a review honestly. He barely writes about the album and the whole time it just feels like he's brushing it off.
Ratatat,3dhino,hyperadhd,5,Thu Jul 16 15:55:27 2015 UTC,Music reviews just don't make any sense. It's all subjective.
Ratatat,3dhino,Kep0a,9,Thu Jul 16 14:40:29 2015 UTC,"Pitchfork tends to rate hiphop and stuff like sufjan stevens extremely high, even demon days has a low rating, which was a great album as well"
Ratatat,3dhino,kolonisatieplank,4,Thu Jul 16 13:43:12 2015 UTC,"Wow holy shit, Demon Days is a 6.9. That album may be one of the only albums I would actually give a perfect score, Demon Days is absolutely flawless. I think I'm done reading Pitchfork for the rest of my life now."
Ratatat,3dhino,MrMister2,2,Thu Jul 16 18:21:46 2015 UTC,Demon days is one of the few albums that I'd give an absolute 10

Ratatat,3dhino,Eat_Dinosaur,2,Thu Jul 16 13:25:10 2015 UTC,"That was my first thought, out of 5 or 10. NPR had a really good review of the album from someone who truly enjoys their music. This guy just sounds like a non listener of the ratatat.   Screw the haters! 5.0/5.0 Magnifiquical piece! :D"
Ratatat,3dhino,Boomshackle,6,Thu Jul 16 17:38:19 2015 UTC,"I found a much better review of the album.

Ratatat,3dhino,John_Rocker,4,Thu Jul 16 13:58:00 2015 UTC,"In my experience, I've found people either love Ratatat or hate Ratatat. There is seldom a middle ground and this guy seems as if he is suffering through the listening. I'm extremely disappointed in Pitchfork, shame. This new album is getting them closer to genius perfection without anything even close to resembling a sell out sound. Rome!"
Ratatat,3dhino,Thenickd,3,Thu Jul 16 15:56:50 2015 UTC,"I assumed they wouldn't give it a great score, I've always felt Pitchfork never really liked them..  I'm excited for Needle Drop's review. He's generally pretty fair"
Ratatat,3dhino,steinfelds,3,Thu Jul 16 18:45:30 2015 UTC,"And then, sometimes, you're just repeating yourself, like Ratatat.      Implying that reinventing your sound for every album is the only thing that makes an album good? What about the unique sound that they created and their ability to create new material in that sound? Personally I don't get hyped on an album release because I'm hoping it'll sound different. I like a band because I like their sound and want new material."
Ratatat,3dhino,andelocks,2,Fri Jul 17 19:11:11 2015 UTC,"Can you review a work of music? To some yes, to me, no. If you ask me why I like a certain work of music, I can't explain it - it's a feeling. This album gives me a good feeling. That's how I judge it, not by someone else's words."
Ratatat,3dhino,dsouzar,2,Fri Jul 17 17:25:41 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why people still read these. With stuff like Aeroplane Over The Sea, they go back years later and re-review it when its obvious they fucked up. It's not about the reviews with them, its about them appearing like they know what they're talking about. Hence the snark, hence the hype changing the reviews. It's a joke."
Ratatat,3dhino,andelocks,3,Fri Jul 17 19:03:32 2015 UTC,"So much this. I remember when the first Tame Impala album Innerspeaker came out, was just the kind of music I'd been hoping for. Of course they gave it a very lukewarm review (probably a 6 something) and completely ignored it in 2010 until the band blew up and they retroactively upgraded it to an 8.5 and a ""Best New Music"" even though they didn't even acknowledge it until it was well past being new.   However, I still go to the site just to find new music because they tend to have pretty decent discovery into genres that interest me. The numbers they give to albums I mostly regard as comedy, I just look for genre keywords that interest me and form my own opinion. Still can't help but get agitated by their obsession with trend-making and temporal relevance.  Still, they've generally come a long way since their early days (this review aside). A 4.9 for De-Loused In the Comatorium is an absolute travesty, even if you don't like the music it deserves more respect than that."
Ratatat,3dhino,rhythmrcker,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:11:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can't believe some of the crap they pull. I didn't know that about Innerspeaker so thanks, its hard to see around their retroactive review crap sometimes. The Way Back Machine is a good way to see how they've changed certain reviews too. It's a joke really. De-Loused is probably my favorite MV album and giving it a score that low, let alone 1/10th of a point away from a 5 is an absolute dick move."
Ratatat,3dhino,andelocks,3,Sat Jul 18 04:50:31 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go ahead and rate that review an abysmal 2/10. This album is fantastic. It's got that minimal melodic vibe that the first album had (the sound that drew me to ratatat in the first place). I loved both lp3 and lp4 but I'm relieved they didn't go off the rails with this one. I fucking hate it when great artists ""outgrow"" their sounds and start sounding like every fucking thing but themselves. Mast does plenty of experimental side work. I'm glad this ratatat album sounds like a ratatat album."

Ratatat,3dhino,visualmadness,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:04:41 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go against most fans here. The album was a disappointment. It felt like a step forward and back at the same time. A lot of untapped potential in the new sounds they've selected and the melodies they've composed. It's just not that memorable of an album compared to their past work.   In contrast (only bringing this up because of the release time frame), I felt Tame Impala's new album to be a fresh variation of what I've come to be familiar with.  I don't see potential for this to grow on me the same way the last Boards of Canada album did. There was a maturity to that album I couldn't see.   You guys seem to have an odd affection for Rome so I'm going to listen to it again for sure when I get home."
Ratatat,3dhino,Aprime1,2,Thu Jul 16 22:06:03 2015 UTC,Tame Impala's album was the worst
Ratatat,3dhino,GalaxyJoshPro,0,Fri Jul 17 22:50:27 2015 UTC,"I think that he's correct to a certain degree, but almost every artist has very similar sounds on all their albums.  People who complain about a certain artists songs all having the same sound is stupid.  Of course it sounds the same, that's the kind of music they want to make.  This guy clearly doesn't like Ratatat very much, but he's not totally wrong on some opinions."
Ratatat,3dhino,SkidRowSkimps,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:19:45 2015 UTC,"It's just perplexing giving the scope of Pitchfork these days that they'd leave the review of a Ratatat album to some who gives no fucks about them at all. I find it hard to believe there wasn't someone more suitable to review it, unless they chose it from a pool of reviews to serve their common agenda of downplaying established bands because it's not 100% trendy. See Radiohead or Queens of The Stone Age. Taken without context the ratings aren't necessarily ridiculous, but when you look and see what they willingly dole out ungodly ratings for it's a bit silly. I like that album a lot, but 10 is a bit absurd it's not perfect at all."

Ratatat,3de9v7,fabhellier,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:05:27 2015 UTC,Every time I read that tweet it makes me sad. :(
Ratatat,3daoyd,milkmade_,8,Tue Jul 14 20:27:01 2015 UTC,"That was great. Thanks for sharing.  The last response from Evan got me excited:  ""You’ve collaborated with so many incredible artists, toured with so many people, made so many albums. What’s next?""  EM: ""I think it’d be awesome to build a giant dome where we could control all the lighting elements to create a space that we design to do our show. Everywhere we go we have to adapt to the space. If we would do like a 360 experience, that would be cool."""

Ratatat,3dabtu,YoshiJ457,3,Tue Jul 14 18:58:19 2015 UTC,"cassette    I don't get this fad. I understand vinyl for sure but cassette? Unless were talking multiTB digital tape, the fuck?"
Ratatat,3dabtu,Aprime1,9,Tue Jul 14 20:06:16 2015 UTC,I mean its cool for people who have really shitty cars or havent bought a new stereo in 20 years  So like 10 people
Ratatat,3dabtu,Gwyn_the_hunter,3,Tue Jul 14 20:32:15 2015 UTC,There are adapters for these people.
Ratatat,3dabtu,Aprime1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:49:40 2015 UTC,Hell I preferred those adapters to an FM transmitter

Ratatat,3d9qcn,AluminumFalcon3,4,Tue Jul 14 16:32:08 2015 UTC,That's literally my only complaint about this album. Maybe they'll answer in the AMA if we will ever hear more of it.
Ratatat,3d9qcn,notdwight,3,Tue Jul 14 16:43:40 2015 UTC,I was planning on asking them about this exact thing for the AMA tomorrow. And trust me I'll be refreshing the page ready to post some questions.
Ratatat,3d9qcn,MrMister2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:09:32 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree more! It sounds really cool
Ratatat,3d9qcn,L4wbreaker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:38:49 2015 UTC,I hope we'll get a full song of it on the live tours (possible live albums?)
Ratatat,3d9qcn,kolonisatieplank,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:57:36 2015 UTC,They said during the AMA that some of the transitions were parts from scrapped songs.
Ratatat,3d90df,Vicboy129,3,Tue Jul 14 13:10:21 2015 UTC,Bought my ticket the day I found out they're coming!
Ratatat,3d90df,I_Am_Vladimir_Putin,5,Tue Jul 14 17:53:02 2015 UTC,"Ratatat got me through my four years at college and this year as a real adult. I have been waiting for a long, long time.  I live in Atlanta, GA and they are going nowhere near me. I will cry if they don't release more tour dates after they release the album Friday."
Ratatat,3d90df,Babykangaa,3,Tue Jul 14 14:38:49 2015 UTC,I'll take you with me in spirit :( Hope you get to see them soon as well
Ratatat,3d90df,Thenickd,2,Tue Jul 14 15:07:15 2015 UTC,Take a road trip to Missouri as it looks like the closest to GA. They have to show dates there. Totally worth the drive. See them twice since you're there!
Ratatat,3d90df,Babykangaa,0,Tue Jul 14 18:06:33 2015 UTC,Ugh. If it were a weekend stop I'd be there in a heartbeat. Adult responsibilities are such a nuisance  ಠ_ಠ
Ratatat,3d90df,Thenickd,2,Wed Jul 15 02:09:40 2015 UTC,"4 times this year Baby! HOB SD in April, Hard Festival in two weeks and now they just released a whole new set of Dates! Getting my tix tomorrow for Ventura and LA! This has to be in the last few days they made these new tour announcements. I hope they play more than cream on chrome, abrasive and picks of brightness from their new album. ROME!!!!"
Ratatat,3d90df,YoshiJ457,2,Tue Jul 14 18:06:58 2015 UTC,Ratatat is going to be my first concert on the 29th
Ratatat,3d90df,KenNoisewater_PHD,2,Tue Jul 14 19:01:43 2015 UTC,"JUst got my ticket to see them at the Moody in Austin! So damn excited, never seen them live"
Ratatat,3d90df,-popgoes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:45:45 2015 UTC,"Nothing for the UK at all, so I'm actually crying"
Ratatat,3d90df,ripjoestrummer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:35:58 2015 UTC,No dates near Dallas :(
Ratatat,3d90df,Thenickd,3,Tue Jul 14 17:53:27 2015 UTC,dude look at the website again! they're gonna be in DALLAS!
Ratatat,3d90df,ripjoestrummer,2,Tue Jul 14 17:59:35 2015 UTC,Oh my fucking god this is amazing.  Thanks for the heads up man.
Ratatat,3d90df,TheAmazingJordo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:22:18 2015 UTC,So excited for Friday for their NYC show. This is going to be my 6th time seeing them.
Ratatat,3d90df,disco_infiltrator_32,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:52:27 2015 UTC,"Their Minneapolis concert on 09/12 was one of the first to sell out :( I went to buy tickets about 2 weeks back, to no avail."
Ratatat,3d6dtc,cvonbee,3,Mon Jul 13 21:48:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly.. Evan just chose a bad time to announce it. It had been years since even a word of Ratatat, so I'd imagine people weren't as stoked for a side project when what they really wanted was the main project, ya know?  Anyways, that being said, I'm sure it will start back up again sometime soon. I look forward to it"
Ratatat,3d6dtc,austinrocssocks,3,Tue Jul 14 02:48:34 2015 UTC,I would like to know as well. SAPA was killer. And also the rumours about another solo EVAX record.  Hopefully he will tell us during the AMA.
Ratatat,3d6dtc,steinfelds,2,Mon Jul 13 22:29:09 2015 UTC,"There were ratatat-ey noises posted to instagram under their account, they were deleted around January I think. I wish I'd recorded my system audio. :("
Ratatat,3d6dtc,idealisticrat,4,Tue Jul 14 00:10:52 2015 UTC,I saved one of them before they were taken down:  https://vid.me/bLjR
Ratatat,3d6dtc,lance_murdock,2,Tue Jul 14 02:27:28 2015 UTC,"I can vaguely remember the other one, it had a cello sawing back and forth in a really groovy progressive beat, and there was some kind of flute weaving in and out, playing the same three notes..."
Ratatat,3d1t2x,Izzy7s7,5,Sun Jul 12 20:52:03 2015 UTC,Was hoping for the Silicon Valley instrumental but this is cool. the tribal folk singing sample reminds me of $100 bills. https://m.soundcloud.com/e-vax/100-bills-instrumental Wonder if he recorded these when he was in Peru working on Abuela.
Ratatat,3d1t2x,notdwight,2,Sun Jul 12 21:55:55 2015 UTC,You mean this one? Was crazy hearing that on Silicon Valley.
Ratatat,3d1t2x,notdwight,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:58:28 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's the one."
Ratatat,3d1t2x,hyperadhd,2,Sun Jul 12 21:59:08 2015 UTC,E*Vax is producing Despot's full album so you're sure to hear more beats within the next few months.
Ratatat,3d0uoo,voejo,5,Sun Jul 12 16:05:25 2015 UTC,A+ perfect post
Ratatat,3d0uoo,napworth,4,Sun Jul 12 19:25:53 2015 UTC,"As a fellow RATATAT fan, I would be happy to send you a copy. Send me your info if you want."
Ratatat,3d0uoo,JaneXxDeau,2,Mon Jul 13 20:22:55 2015 UTC,"what do yoou mean by copy? digitql version i have, we need the vinyl one..  Thanks anyway!"
Ratatat,3d0uoo,JaneXxDeau,2,Tue Jul 14 15:31:38 2015 UTC,":) I meant an original vinyl. I guess copy wasn't the right word. Either way if you're satisfied with your digital, it's all good. I suppose I was FEELIN the reddit spirit and extremely excited to be listening to the new album."
Ratatat,3d0uoo,idealisticrat,2,Tue Jul 14 21:36:14 2015 UTC,"Thats what I want. The original ratatat vynil - that's what the sound system needs.  I just downloaded the leaked version because I know I'll buy the vinyl itself, and to be honest I still listen most music in digital format.. And I guess there's no good ratatat download out there.. Bandcamp is empty..   Where do my you live?"
Ratatat,3d0uoo,Bondle,3,Tue Jul 14 22:07:35 2015 UTC,props to /u/Bondle for setting up the awesome new subreddit theme
