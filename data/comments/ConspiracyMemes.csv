ConspiracyMemes,3dwo0s,BadTRAFFIC,-3,Mon Jul 20 03:51:50 2015 UTC,Umm...how is this a meme? It just looks like a typical right wing anti-progressive comic.
ConspiracyMemes,3dwo0s,multiplesifl,4,Mon Jul 20 19:13:44 2015 UTC,"meme (mēm)  noun  an element of a culture or system of behavior that may be considered to be passed from one individual to another by non genetic means, especially imitation.   a humorous image, video, piece of text, etc. that is copied (often with slight variations) and spread rapidly by Internet users. A ""meme"" is a virally-transmitted cultural symbol or social idea. A meme (rhymes with ""team"") behaves like a flu or a cold virus, traveling from person to person quickly, but transmitting an idea instead of a lifeform. According to Cecil Adams of theStraightDope.com, the concept of memes ""is either really deep, or really, really obvious""."

ConspiracyMemes,2uu368,CautiousNarwhal,5,Thu Feb 5 04:19:08 2015 UTC,"there's an X in fire accelerant in the cage, as you can clearly see they poured it around the perimeter of the cage, and then crossed corners. the OP here is suggesting, as many people are, that this video was created as a propaganda piece, and that the man is an actor who did NOT die. there's actually a lot of evidence that's already been pulled apart by theorists and have shown that a few different parts of the video suggest it's not real. there are shots of the 'pilot' post-death, still burning, only one of his hands appears to be completely plastic, with lycra burning off of his forearm. there's also the dummy-stuffing that comes out of an armpit as they move the 'body' for more angles. a big one for me is that the cage he's in, is really a barred crate that they put on him upside down. it's not bolted or tied, he could easily just charge the side and turn it over, or dig/kick the sand up before the fire gets to him. Any trained military man/pilot/etc would rather be shot dead (quickly) for attempting to get out of the situation, than burn to death (slow and painful). Also, there's a clear use of after-effects on the video. it seriously begs a LOT of questioning."
ConspiracyMemes,2uu368,borumlive,-5,Thu Feb 5 22:59:29 2015 UTC,"If the guy were to try to escape, he would walk right into the hands of the enemy anyway. I think he had accepted to die as the torturing and suffering would finally be over. He had no reasonable chance of escaping.  I see no reason to suspect it's a fake, but hey, maybe I'm not in the right subreddit."
ConspiracyMemes,2uu368,malnutrition6,5,Mon Feb 23 20:19:31 2015 UTC,I'm working with he assumption that he'd rather die by quick gunfire for escaping than burn to death slowly

He probably wouldn't have the strength both physical and mental strength to pull something like that off either. He probably had been tortured for the past weeks or months so it's a broken man entirely accepting his fate of being burned to death."
ConspiracyMemes,2uu368,malnutrition6,3,Tue Feb 24 00:46:36 2015 UTC,"I guess my point is that for all of the terrorist videos we've seen in the past couple decades, these videos from ISIS look like they've been shot with a go-pro and edited on a macbook with after-effects and lots of prop-use. I remember seeing videos come to surface of jihad extremists and terror groups making videos of hostages pleas, showcasing the malnourishment and mistreatment of hostages, and demands/warnings of plans of action, but these videos of beheadings and burnings are new to terror groups in the midwest.   Mexican and South American drug lords make videos like these, but they do it authentically and with tact; they have a cellphone, or a camcorder, and they do their worst on camera, no cuts, not edits, not bullshit that makes you wonder ""why is there flame in the lense/shot when the guy hasn't lit the torch yet for the pilot?""   Honestly, the fact that these videos from ISIS look so set up and 'well shot/edited' makes me think that the professions deconstructing the videos and finding layers of editing are on to something.."
ConspiracyMemes,2uu368,borumlive,-1,Tue Feb 24 15:22:32 2015 UTC,"The fact that the videos are so well produced indeed makes it seem like they intend to send a message with it. ISIS has created a network of people in wihich there are people that are capable of putting this together.  This shouldn't necessarily mean that it was faked or anything, but it just shows they have adopted a new way of organizing things. More organized means more scary.  The people suffer under their regime, both inside and outside of their country, and it seems like there is no end in sight yet."

My sister works with this kind of thing and holds 35 patents herself in regards to her work involving phages and modified bio-targeting systems (E. Coli and the like modified to target specific viruses/bacteria/parasitical organisms and deliver drugs to infected cell matrices).  Usually if the government itself files a patent on a certain strain, you can be almost sure it is going to be used by the CDC for research, often it will be farmed out to federally funded university research programs as well. If a private entity (read: biotech/pharma) license the patent from the government to perform their own R&D, it's also an ""easy"" way for them to keep track of who has such things in their possession or who was denied such use via record of applications/granted/denied."

Is there an area of your life in which you could benefit to learn more about a subject or philosophy that you haven't fully grasped? Not everyone comprehends or even understands politics or even what power the president actually has, compared to what they think he has. Has there been gross abuses of power, yes. Should he be impeached? I am honest enough to say that I do not have enough knowledge to say yes or no. However there is a large vein of corruption running through politics in general and has been there before any of us were born.

What I'm saying that if there is some kind of underground financiers with an agenda then Hollywood would be a place to sink lots of money. I always find these movies dubious - there's always war movies that seem to support a nationalistic agenda released at very conveninet times.

ConspiracyMemes,240d7w,Dr__House,-3,Sat Apr 26 14:49:01 2014 UTC,"Funny thing is, if the FBI did actually commit some sort of terror plot and there was any tengible evidence, mainstream news outlets would be clamoring and fighting eachother to be the first to break the story.  I have a simpler explanation for why mainstream media has a lot of shit on it today: Ratings. People love watching crap. Ratings matter. These companies are profit driven.  Bring them a big story about the FBI committing a terror plot in order to ensue mass panic or otherwise, and you got some tangible evidence? Yeah. Fox, msnbc, cnn would all be fighting tooth and nail to be the first to talk to you, to be the first to get copies of your evidence and run the first exclusive on the story. Why? Ratings. Ratings equal profit. Paranoid? Don't want to goto a single source? Then you can release the information and evidence via the AP, where everyone gets an equal shot at it.  That said, I don't have much trust at all for the mainstream media in general anymore, but at least there's some good people in these places actually trying. Unlike say, shoddy blogs on the internet written by conspiracy theorists that have no basis in reality.  Edit: yeah, silence the guy who doesn't agree with you. Is that what you open minded people do here? Silence so called dissent? How is that free and open? Silencing someone purely because you don't agree with them is bullshit. prove me wrong. Or at least have the gull to post some criticism and get a conversation going. Don't just downvote people you disagree with. That is complete and utter bullshit, and entirely counter to the conspiracy theory mindset. How dare you demand people open their eyes while you silence any form of dissenting criticism?"

Please tell me what your views are, or at minimum, tell me how I am ill-informed.  Boy....I'm either a kool-aid drinking, Fox-News watching ""conspiracy theorist"" (in quotes to ensure that term is conveyed pejoratively, as the media/government prefers) OR, I am a racist (although you didn't call me that, it seems to be quite a common retort for Obama apologists, i.e., the willfully blind).  I can't decide which of those convenient, ignorant, reflexive, and wholly inaccurate responses I dislike more.  Specifically the Fox-News comment. I am completely aware of Roger Ailes agenda and programming goals, yet I do watch Fox. I also watch MSNBC, CBS, and CNN (although probably CNN the least). However, anyone who had their eyes open knows none of these outlets are providing impartial or balanced information... all are guilty of spin.  My tv watching is only maybe 20% of my news gathering activities. I read countless websites from democracy now, to dailykos, to blacklistednews, to globalresearch, to infowars. And while they all choose to report things or comment on things that others might not (well, except for blacklistednews which is a news aggregator), each of these sites had their own spin, be it for political purposes or ratings.  The point is, you are doing yourself a disservice by not watching the widest variety of news sources possible. You take them all together and you see how they oppose or compliment the others...and through this you gain a much deeper understanding of what really is going on. To dismiss any of them --especially the extremes on either side of the left-right paradigm (which is primarily the facade we are forced to swallow), you lose the opportunity to understand things that others (those who stick to only reading those sources whose news/commentary aligns best with their own views), will miss."
ConspiracyMemes,204ix0,stonygirl,1 point,Fri Apr 4 22:38:54 2014 UTC,"I am doing myself a service by not watching propaganda television where they scream about NSA surveillance but never mention it was authorized by The Patriot Act - you know that Republican bill that the same talking heads at Fox News said we had to have or the terrorists win. No one had a problem when it was the Bush Administration spying on the American people.  I see no point in continuing this conversation with you. If you consider Fox News, or MSNBC a credible news source then you are too ill-informed to have an intelligent conversation with. Neither are news. Both channels are political punditry. NOT NEWS. CNN tries to be news but is all tabloid garbage and tragedy porn."
ConspiracyMemes,204ix0,pjvex,-1,Sat Apr 5 01:22:33 2014 UTC,"Didn't I pretty much discredit those television news outlets? I thought I did.  But before you decide to end this conversation, you should look at the way you views things. Everything is spun or part of either propaganda or an agenda... It's important to watch all of it, because the more information we have, the more likely we will be able to assemble something closer to the truth. It's along the same lines as ""keep your friends close and your enemies closer""... except there are so few sources that are unbiased, even if they do not mean to be.  And you know what? I get it...You hate Bush and republicans. Me too. But the facts are that the Patriot Act was barely debated... The administration didn't give them any time, and those congressmen who objected to it (both democrat and republicans) were ridiculed into voting for it because the while fucking charade worked, and we were all terrified. And also, many congressmen voted for it *only if** it included sunset provisions to end the force and effect of the Act within four years.* And four years later numerous democrats and republicans vehemently objected to extending these sunset provisions. But they were brow-beaten into doing it again.   Now all that's depressing...But is it not as depressing, if not more, that Obama pledges to get rid of Patriot Act laws (and the Act itself) in 2008...But then in 2011 signs another extension of it?  Obama has cracked down harder on whistleblowers than any other president...his administration of transparency had been nothing but hiding behind ""executive privilege"" and ""national security""... Obama is a fucking neocon like the rest... It's not Democrats vs. Republicans. That is another charade, the left-right paradigm. More accurately, its us.... Me, you, and the people if this country against them, the government. There are a few that do care about or civil liberties (Justin Amash and Rand Paul, usually called tea partiers (but the original tea party was co-opted)), but not many others. Even the supreme court is against us...And who knows why? Maybe the NSA is threatening to ruin all of them, including Obama.  I don't have the answers, but I implore you not to become ""partisan"", as all that does is divide us instead of unite us....And that, to be honest, is the point."

It has a diverse base of financial support;[13] the U.S. State Department, the Broadcasting Board of Governors, and the National Science Foundation are major contributors.[15] As of 2012, 80% of the Tor Project's $2M annual budget comes from the United States government, with the Swedish government and other organizations providing the rest,[16] including NGOs and thousands of individual sponsors.[17]"
ConspiracyMemes,1xeo9l,stapuff6,3,Sun Feb 9 13:24:10 2014 UTC,"Tor (anonymity network):      Tor (previously an acronym for The Onion Router) is free software for enabling online anonymity and censorship resistance. Tor directs Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer network consisting of more than five thousand relays to conceal a user's location or usage from anyone conducting network surveillance or traffic analysis. Using Tor makes it more difficult to trace Internet activity, including ""visits to Web sites, online posts, instant messages, and other communication forms"", back to the user and is intended to protect the personal privacy of users, as well as their freedom and ability to conduct confidential business by keeping their internet activities from being monitored. An extract of a Top Secret appraisal by the NSA characterized Tor as ""the King of high secure, low latency Internet anonymity"" with ""no contenders for the throne in waiting"".
