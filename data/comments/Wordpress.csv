Wordpress,3e4y32,blindpet,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:06:58 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me that you're issue could be due to using browser side caching (not that this is the issue), and having lots of data to download and be cached on first page load. This could explain why subsequent page loads are not as slow."
Wordpress,3e4y32,killersatan,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:48:49 2015 UTC,"I agree that's a possibility, when I try a page that has already been loaded in a disabled cache browser it loads faster because nginx has cached it, new pages are still slow though in the disabled cache browser."

Wordpress,3e4ln3,ElementGeek,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:25:14 2015 UTC,Supercache or totalcache seem good to have.  Also WordFence seems like a good idea.
Wordpress,3e4ln3,arcterex,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:04:09 2015 UTC,I've always heard that caching makes things load faster. And I looked it up.   But can you give a ELI5 of what caching is? And why it would be beneficial in the context of a wp blog?
Wordpress,3e4ln3,arcterex,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:27:38 2015 UTC,"The short version is that when WordPress (or many web-apps) process data to generate a page they have to do work.  Putting theme files together, pulling data from the database, filling in fields, mushing theme files into database content, etc.  This takes time.  Caching is the act of taking those resulting pages and saving them so that the next time someone comes, they get served the already created page (the ""cached"" page) instead of the server having to go to the database, mush template files together, and so on.  There are other things going on.  For example how long to keep the cached pages around before they expire, invalidating the cached page if you update the content and the cached version is no longer current, do you cache all the content or just pages that visitors hit, etc.  Hope that helps."
Wordpress,3e4ln3,killersatan,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:36:28 2015 UTC,"Every time someone visits a WordPress site without caching, the server must build the website, querying the database etc fit each visit. Caching means the server creates the page once, then gives this pre-made website out, avoiding extra work.   ELI5: When making logo bricks, a mold is created once, then the same mold is used to create lots of logo bricks. A new mold is not created for each individual logo brick made."

Wordpress,3e5ac8,GabrielMtn,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:59:14 2015 UTC,Building an informative site for the streamer.  I'm fairly skilled for my age. I know HTML fluently and quite a bit of C++. I'm a graphic designer too. That's about it for me though.  I'm just trying to figure out how to essentially erase an entire wordpress excluding the menu. iframing it doesn't work unfortunately.
Wordpress,3e5ac8,killersatan,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:04:55 2015 UTC,"Knowing your age would help there, but still it's all relative age wise.  From what you're saying, you'll be wanting to build your own wordpress theme, but my advice would be to avoid wordpress if you only want it for its menu function, as it's a lot of extra work to build for wordpress.  If I were you, I'd have a go at learning some css and creating a static html and css website.  If you decide to take this route, have a look into a framework such as bootstrap or foundation, however if you've only got limited experience take a look at Skelton, it will really help to get a nice response layout going while avoiding complications with your css."
Wordpress,3e5ac8,rkaz246,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:23:10 2015 UTC,"You can even use bootstrap, with is built in navigation menus. It really helps rapid ui development(which I hate doing! )"
Wordpress,3e5ac8,killersatan,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:30:28 2015 UTC,"Bootstrap is great, but may be a bit like jumping in at the deep end with a house tied to your legs if you've yet to dabble with any CSS.

Wordpress,3e5ac8,PixelatorOfTime,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:38:19 2015 UTC,"This is a case of using the wrong tool. If you're just doing a static page (minus the menu), there's absolutely no reason you should be using WordPress—WP's calls to the database will just slow down load times, when you could just hard code the links in a custom HTML menu that's styled with your static page."
Wordpress,3e569p,EnglishRus,4,Wed Jul 22 01:14:21 2015 UTC,"Why? For the love of little fishes, why?  If you want a one-page ""website"" that is a static image, you don't need WordPress. You need 4 lines of HTML and a file upload.  If you have a static image with no menus or anything, how is anyone going to get to any other content?  I thought splash pages died years ago."

Wordpress,3e569p,condimentia,2,Wed Jul 22 02:51:25 2015 UTC,"If you're not wanting to use HTML code, like Summerchilde suggests, you could just add a coming-soon plugin.  I use Coming Soon by Seed Prod. Free, works great.  I can set it to have just one huge background image, and float text over it, or just have the image, only. I set the page not to be crawled by search engines, but that's up to you.  You can be working on your content in the background, in the meantime.  Everyone else sees the image you've selected."
Wordpress,3e2jk7,DrDiv,10,Tue Jul 21 13:41:20 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately this kind of infection can take a bit of time to fix since the responsible party likely has some sort of backdoor on your site. Most recently, I dealt with this when there was a vulnerability discovered in the Gravity Forms plugin that allowed attackers place files on the server. Then they use that file to modify other files or they use it to get more access to the server. This is almost always caused by an outdated plugin that has a vulnerability.  First, make sure you have a backup of your files and your database. Make a new one before you start mucking around with the items below.  Next, I would ensure that you have updated to the latest version of WordPress, your themes, and your plugins. You may also want to note what versions you have installed since you can search for ""PluginName vulnerability"" to see if there was anything that was recently fixed. This information may help determine what the attacker did and where the infected files may be.  After that, you may want to install WordFence Security and be sure to change the settings to scan files outside of your WordPress install. You may also want to put it into high sensitivity mode. There are other plugins that do similar things if you want to try one of those. Run the scan (it can take a bit) and it will hopefully find the files that don't belong, have malicious code, or have been modified from the original version and follow the recommended actions.  WordFence is great and I say keep it to generally make your WP install more secure, but it doesn't always catch all the files that need to be fixed so you may find yourself needing a more thorough fix.  I would also recommend taking a look at the article posted in the sidebar (""Been hacked? Don't Panic!"")[http://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/wiki/index#wiki_been_hacked.3F_don.27t_panic.21] where other considerations are covered including changing passwords, etc."
Wordpress,3e2jk7,rick_fu,5,Tue Jul 21 14:52:38 2015 UTC,"I would open a shell session on your site and then grep for the domain listed in that code.  Something is re-injecting it into your header.php, so that something has file system access to header.php -- which means it's being executed when your site is loaded."
Wordpress,3e2jk7,mwisconsin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:29 2015 UTC,"This is a good suggestion. It's possible that the code that injects it is obfuscated, in which case you won't find it, but it's worth a try."

Chances are it's been modified to inject stuff like this into it.  Before I realized that was a thing, I found a template I liked and used it, only to get references to unsavory sites but only when a search engine bot crawled the page.  It turns out that buried deep in a normally untouched php file deep in the admin folder was some bad code that injected itself under the right circumstances.  tl;dr:  If you're using a theme that normally is paid but you found for free somewhere, it's probably infected."

Then, replace the paths to your CSS and JS (and whatever else) files with something like this:  <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""<?php echo get_template_directory_uri();?>/css/leaflet.css"" />   (or wherever they are in the theme folder--they must be in your theme folder). The get_template_directory_uri function will make a path to the theme directory in your folder structure.  Then, just create a page in wp-admin that uses that Map template, save it and you should be good to go. If you want content to appear on that page, you'll have to mimic the functionality of the page.php file in your theme, but otherwise, you should be fine."

It is incredibly annoying bc there are no entries in the logs, and it is difficult to tell what the problem is Bc of the way Wordpress works, it could be failing at multiple points.

Unfortunately, to my knowledge no good solution exists. Basically if you only export Posts, you won't be transferring the media/attachments, and the link between Post feature images is tied into the media getting transferred. (Honestly, don't even know if it works at all...)  If you're not needing to transfer JUST a few posts, you can try to running the full complete export/import. If that fails, and you're comfortable with a total replacement of your test site, try a full-fledged migration solution like All in One WP Migration.

If you tagged several posts, you still won't have the proper flexibility for ordering. Categories are also the wrong tool for the job as well because it adds additional complexity to the post type.  I think the best way to do this would be adding a custom meta field to your post type called ""priority"" which accepts an int.  You can then query your custom post type, and do additional sorting by the priority. Posts with no priority should remain unaffected by the second sort, while posts with priority ints will be resorted in order.   This is future proof as well so you can manually adjust who has proper priority as positions change.  Add Meta Box  WP Meta Query"
