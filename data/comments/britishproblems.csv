britishproblems,3dyitx,falcon_jab,3,Mon Jul 20 20:37:47 2015 UTC,"In the early 30s Nazi Germany wasn't seen as the evil power house it was to become   Um, not entirely. Or at all, in fact. The Nazi government wasn't seen in the context of genocide, but it was seen as a despicable, racist, violent, and fascist regime. Because they were, right from the start. The Nazis in power were never not considered bad people by much of the rest of the world and almost all of the Western world.  Even prior to being in power, they had attempted a violent coup and conducted widespread violence in the streets. They were widely (and rightly) considered to be a bunch of violent thugs who were hungry for power, and likely to start a new war.  Please stop buying into the myth that the Nazis were OK at first and rescued the economy. Even that part isn't true, because Hitler's spending relied on conquest to prevent economic collapse. In addition: the planned genocide of the Eastern Europeans was spelled out quite clearly by Hitler in ""Mein Kampf"" well before he came to power, and before the war started and he began that genocide as soon as Poland fell.   It was the stated policy of the Nazis to kill, deport, or enslave the Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, and other Slavic populations, whom they considered inferior, and to repopulate the land with Germanic people. The entire urban population was to be exterminated by starvation, thus creating an agricultural surplus to feed Germany and allowing their replacement by a German upper class.   You also said:   A lot of people, leaders, companies etc supported them   This is true for Germans, after 1933. Prior to that there were 1.5 million members of the Nazi party. After they came to power, many people rushed to become members (especially after all other political parties were banned and the members started to get privilidges). So much so that they had to halt the registering of new members.  Foreign companies (notably IBM) continued to do business with the Nazis, in the same way that companies do business in modern times with Syria, Iran, and South Africa (in the 80s). Some politicians supported Hitler, but they cannot in general be said to be senior, and certainly not to hold the mainstream view of politicians at the time.   in the same why someone might find the USA an attractive country today   um.. no. If one of Obama's first acts as President had been to ban the Republican party, then to (shortly afterwards) round up all Republican politicians and party members and dump them in prison, murder them, or put them into concentration camps.. well.. then you can make the comparison.    It wasn't until a few years later, that people realised what was going on   Er. Again, no. They realised pretty much straight away. Some highlights from the timeline:  30th January 1933: Hitler becomes Chancellor (not yet in full power, but almost there)  28th February 1933: Communist party banned under extradordinary powers granted to the Chancellor after a fire in the Reichstag  6th March 1933: New elections held (without Communists being allowed to stand; they had had 15% of the vote at the previous election)  21st March 1933: Enabling Act passed (giving Hitler supreme authority). Social Democrat politicians (the second largest party) are prevented from attending the vote, giving Hitler the majority he needs for it to pass. The Act gives Hitler ultimate power; that of a dictator.  27th March 1933: in the USA, mass protests are held in several cities, regarding the German treatment of Jews. Boycotts of German good begin in the USA and in European countries.  7th April 1933: Jews removed from Civil Service  7th April 1933: Jews removed from legal profession  25th April 1933: Jews limited in schools and universities  10th May 1933: Mass demonstration in NYC against the Nazis.  14th July 1933: Naturalised Jews have citizenship revoked  ... some other stuff...  30th June - 2nd July 1934: Night of the Long Knives. Political opponents both within the Nazi party and outside of it are literally murdered, sometimes quite openly and in government buildings.   the Vice-Chancellery was occupied by an SS-squad and a few Gestapo inspectors. Bose was conducted into a conference room – allegedly to be interrogated – and shot from behind ten times as he took a seat.   Most victims of the Night of the Long Knives are members of the SA (Brownshirts) who represented a challenge to Hitler's power and an organisation he no longer needed (its entire purpose being to reach power by violent means and to conduct thuggery on the streets against political opponents).  ... some other stuff...  15th September 1935: Nuremberg Laws come into force (all Jews have ciizenship revoked, various other racist laws passed)  What you said was roughly the opposite of what actually happened. The Nazis were violent thugs from their bgeinning in the 1920s, who later seized power and immediately started oppressing Jews and political opponents. They were seen as such by the outside world. Nevertheless, politicians had to deal with Hitler and there was nothing they could do (short of a war for which they were unprepared and for which there was very little public support) to stop him.

Teams will be selected internally - anyone at uni interested did a quiz - then audition. Audition is a written group quiz, then a session with selecty people which includes group interview and group test.  I dnk what happens after that but they presumably pick the most knowledgable teams. Regional diversity helps a bit I think.  Some people are VERY keen to be on it and literally practice for it, and will make sure they have one person who knows a lot about music, another about science or maths.   Seeing as every programme involves music at some point having a decent muso is very important. So bring a music person, a maths person, someone who knows art and literature and you're on the right track.  Of course, the people who are really keen on Uni Challenge are more likely to be well-spoken and cerebral than your average student, as well as being less interested in fashion or whatever.

britishproblems,3dtws0,VladimirPocket,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:07:22 2015 UTC,"I had Spotify for 6 months via Vodafone and when it stopped being free I cancelled it.  I have huge amounts of music on my own devices and uploaded to google music which plays my own stuff without ads so I'm happy enough with that.  I still buy a lot of music,  and bands I love I always get physical copies."
britishproblems,3dtws0,neobenedict,8,Sun Jul 19 19:03:28 2015 UTC,To be honest I wasn't aware it had ever been legal. I thought the old law about not changing the format of stuff you buy still existed.  I totally ignore it because it's so stupid and also because buying music internationally it's very hard to legally buy MP3 music from abroad so I have to import the CDs.
britishproblems,3dtws0,TheOnlyKnownTurtoad,5,Sun Jul 19 16:37:35 2015 UTC,"I still buy lots of CDs. I love my collection and if something bad happened to my library, I could just rip it all again. It would be time consuming, yes, but to avoid this I also back my files up.  Sorted!"
britishproblems,3dtws0,K-o-R,4,Sun Jul 19 19:37:03 2015 UTC,Same here. And isn't the sound quality better from CD rips?
britishproblems,3dtws0,MrBeardyMan,3,Sun Jul 19 20:15:50 2015 UTC,"It depends, it used to be the case but I think most of the time now you can't usually tell. Especially with services like Bandcamp offering downloads of music you've bought DRM-free and in FLAC format. I buy downloads if there is no other options (CD is hard to get hold of/expensive, or the album is DL only etc.) and I really like Bandcamp as a service. iTunes is something I only use to sync my ye olde iPod classic which I hope to get at least ten more years from like I did my old one.  After that, I'll have to find another high-capacity player because I don't like streaming unless I'm at home."
britishproblems,3dtws0,PuckeredStarfish,2,Sun Jul 19 21:21:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, depending on where you get your MP3s from. Shitty web youtube rips are 128kbps, which you can tell the difference versus FLAC CDs. iTunes is 256 aac which is generally transparent to FLAC CDs (can't hear the difference)."
britishproblems,3dtws0,CheshireSwift,2,Mon Jul 20 00:59:59 2015 UTC,I actually kind of enjoy the sitting down and ripping the whole collection process.  I've done it 3 times and due to back ups I'm not likely to have to do it again but still. Let's me reorganise the collection!

In addition, I suspect that many GPs over 55 will simply take early retirement if they are forced to work evenings and weekends, which will make the recruitment crisis even worse.

Conductor is using the PA system to attempt to initiate communication but no response so far. Train is still moving.  Update 3: after throwing a cup with string over the barricade, the family has begun communicating with the conductor. I'm not sure exactly but someone is saying that they have a bomb attached to the train which will detonate if the speed drops below 40mph.

Not sure if alcohol is a good idea in this situation but I suppose she's trying to get everyone to relax a bit.

The American commander ordered JB to open fire on the Russians but he refused and a long standoff ensued, broken only when the Russians agreed to hand over the airfield in exchange for food."

Clark called then-Secretary General of NATO Javier Solana, who told him ""you have transfer of authority"" in the area. General Clark then issued an order for the NATO troops to attack and ""overpower"" the armed Russian troops, but Captain James Blunt leading the British troops questioned this order and was supported in this decision by General Mike Jackson, the British commander of the Kosovo Force. Jackson refused to sanction the attack, reportedly saying ""I'm not going to start the Third World War for you"". Jackson has said he refused to take action because he did not believe it was worth the risk of a military confrontation with the Russians, instead insisting that troops encircle the airfield. After two days of stand-off and negotiations, NATO agreed to an independent Russian peacekeeping force, and Russia relinquished control of the airport.   Wow that's amazing.
