In order for a criminal to be fit to stand trial, he must be able to understand what the justice procedure is and he must be able to understand why he is brought to trial. This is not my client's case.  As you can see in his testimony:   I'll plead to facetiousness with intent to amuse myself/others, binge posting, participating in serious discussions I have neither the right or mental capacity to be part of, and rampant paranoia, hence mass deletion   The Defendant doesn't understand the trial procedure. He pleads for weird and imaginary charges.  The Defendant said himself he doesn't have the mental capacity to be part of this.  The Defendant has paranoia (probably Redditschyzophrenia). His psychiatry exam results can be found here.  Therefore my client is unfit to stand trial, and shall be brought to a clinical facility (/r/psychiatry) and given help until he is fit to stand trial."

KarmaCourt,3e0f88,TheGrandDalaiKarma,2,Wed Jul 22 04:46:35 2015 UTC,"Brief Amicus Curiae partially in support of Prosecution, partially in support of Defendant  CHARGES PRESENTED   Failure of Summon to court. Evasion of Justice Impersonation Karma Whoring Anonymity Abuse Grand Faggotry   Identity and Interest of Amicus Curiae  This amicus is submitted by /u/HolaHelloSalutNiHao respectfully to His Most Honorable Judge, pursuant to the interests of one party in part and to the other in part.  The submittant affirms he has been summoned by neither party and is as such neutral to this case.  Summary of Argument  The defendant has answered summon to court; he has committed activities which may indict him in charge No. 2, the evasion of justice, he has impersonated many traits; it is unclear if such acts were intended to Karma Whore; he has abused anonymity; he is clear of charge six, Grand Faggotry, for its being opposed to the other charges.  ARGUMENT  Summon to Court  /u/ExpiredSeafood, the defendant, has in this post responded to the Summon of Court. Thus, charge one, the failure to respond to a summon to Karma Court, is invalid. The submitter of this amicus hopes that the Court will find the defendant innocent of charge one.  Evasion of Justice  Evasion of justice shall be assumed to be referring to the act of which the defendant had removed his entire post history. This act, evidenced by his sole post in his history, as well has his over-10,000 karma, is undoubtable, however whether it may be considered evasion of justice is dependent upon the intent of this removal.  The prosecution claims that it was to avoid any form of evidence being found which may indict him of such crime; indeed, his post history was removed after this court summon was posted, which is potentially indicative of such evasion.  However, the defendant claims that it is the result of ""rampant paranoia"", which is not a charge that is being prosecuted in this case. Should this be true, then this charge is cleared. However, the complementary timing of this post and the removal of post history makes this amicus consider evasion as a likely--although not certain beyond reasonable doubt--explanation.  Impersonation  Because of the contradictory nature of many of the defendant's (/u/ExpiredSeafood) alleged posts, this amicus determines that, should such posts be proven beyond reasonable doubt to exist, that at least one of them must have been an impersonation and a lie.   However, with the lack of evidence, it is impossible to fully prove such an act. This amicus, however, hopes that this court considers proof beyond reasonable doubt to be an acceptable substitute. The deletion of posts, admitted by the defendant, is a strong indicator of potential guilt, along with the context and thread of the linked posts. The defendant has pleaded to ""facetiousness with intent to amuse"", however, which may or may not refer to impersonation. This amicus urges the court to request a clarification of this plead from the defendant.  This amicus, in the meantime, will assume that such acts were committed, and with the intent of impersonation, and it urges His Most Honorable Supreme Court Being Judge /u/TheGrandDalaiKarma to consider such a position and rule on it as such.  Karma Whoring  Although Karma Whoring may have been a side effect, the defendant claims it was not intended. Without further evidence to prove the defendant's intent or purpose, this amicus urges the court to charge the defendant with Accidental Karma Whoring of the Second Degree.  Anonymity Abuse  Based upon the conclusion of the Impersonation charge, along with the combination of the anonymity of the internet, the logical result of rational thinking must be that charge No. 5, Anonymity Abuse, was committed by the defendant.  Grand Faggotry  This charge is flawed for many reasons and this amicus kindly requests the court to dismiss it.   It assumes that Homosexuality is a crime, which if ruled on could set a dangerous precedent for discrimination against homosexuals. As one of the impersonation charges is based around the claim of homosexuality, or more specifically lesbianism, the charge of Impersonation is incompatible with this charge. As I hope I have shown to the court beyond reasonable doubt that charges of Impersonation are justified, this charge of Grand Faggotry is rendered null and void should the court choose to concur with this amicus curiae in that section.   This amicus holds that the prosecution, represented by Plaintiff /u/freedomni has unjustly charged the defendant with such crime, and that the defendant is innocent; it also hopes that His Honor will concur.  Conclusion  I hope that I have demonstrated to the court why each of these charges should be found guilty; No. 3, and No. 5; that this charge should be reduced to accidental in the second degree; No. 4; that this charge's decision should wait on further testimony; No. 2; and that these charges should be found innocent; No. 1 and No. 6.

KarmaCourt,3dndwc,Kikool42,2,Wed Jul 22 01:40:21 2015 UTC,"Stands nervously. Looks at notes briefly before crumpling them up and tossing them aside.  Your honor, let me start by telling you a story. This is a story of admiration, dedication, betrayal and eventually tragedy. About one year ago my client, /u/paulthekoala59 created /r/Bigri23 in honor of /u/Bigri23. He did not create this subreddit to further his personal gain, not to feed his ego. No. No, he created it because he knew that there was more to life than just himself. Or to put it in his words, he ""Created the subreddit to observe and worship /u/bigri23"". Because /u/paulthekoala59, of all the redditors, knew that he knew nothing. Nothing compared to the supreme being of /r/Bigri23, /u/Bigri23.  For a while everything was going fine. The subreddit continued to grow and prosper. Unfortunately the peaceful period time that had washed over /r/Bigri23 so gradually couldn't last forever. Or perhaps it could have, save for the revelations of one fateful day (or night, I don't really know). For on that day my client discovered that not all who claimed to serve under /u/Bigri23 were genuine. One of the moderators, /u/nabaroo I believe, was deleting posts. Deleting posts that honored the very person he claimed to worship. As you can imagine my client was devastated. But alas, he had a subreddit to run. So he asked /u/nabaroo why he had deleted such posts. You would imagine he would give some reason, wouldn't you? Some reason as to why he had turned his back on the establishment of worship he helped create. But we will never know why. /u/nabaroo didn't give a reason. So my client was left with no choice. He did what any true believer in the power of /u/Bigri23 would do. He removed /u/nabaroo from a position where they could do more harm. He is actions were praiseworthy. And yet, praise is not what he has received. He received scorn. Scorn for things he did in honor of /u/Bigri23, scorn for things he didn't even do. But it didn't end with scorn. If it did we wouldn't be here today. Instead of ending it there /u/paulthekoala59 was prosecuted. Your honor, I ask you to look at Exhibit B. The Exhibit clearly shows that the AMA was ""removed by Bigri23"", not by my client. My client is dedicated to serving /u/Bigri23. And yet, here we are. Nods to kikool42. Thank you your honor."
KarmaCourt,3dndwc,MacoNope,2,Mon Jul 20 21:23:15 2015 UTC,"One of the moderators, /u/nabaro I believe, was deleting posts.       Objection #1!

Also I would like to point out that in the U.S. Court system (I'm not sure about KC), speculation applies to the witnesses being called to make assumptions that they are not qualified to make, and defamation can only be used if the statement is proven beyond reasonable doubt to be false. That portion of my post served the purpose of shedding reasonable doubt on the charge of abuse of power through the introduction of a parallel and equally likely scenario of the  removal /u/nabaroo as a mod. My job as defense is not to prove what did or didn't happen, my job is to show that the scenario proposed by the prosecution does not have sufficient evidence to be proven to be true and/or illegal. The burden of proof lies on the prosecution (according to the KC constitution)."
KarmaCourt,3dndwc,MacoNope,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:45:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry if my objection was taken incorrectly. I was using speculation in the commonplace sense, not the legal terminology.   Also....Taken from Article VIII of the Constitution, which describes the role of Defense:   Their job is to refute the prosecutions allegations and evidence and establish the relative innocence of the accused.   Your entire opening statement hinges on the premise that /u/nabaro deleted posts, thus proving that by removing him as mod, /u/paulathekoala59 was doing us all a service. Your wording makes it seem as if it's a known fact that /u/nabaro deleted posts. Semantics or not, this is slander. Now you say it was ""a parallel and equally likely scenario"".   Nonetheless, I appreciate your presence in court, and I do not wish to be uncivil. Let us proceed with the trial as necessary, with your refuting my evidence."

However he would still have to bring proof about that because the prosecution's version (/u/paulathekoala59 deleted the post) has evidences. And I guess I'll have to take the side that has the most evidences (and that makes the story the most plausible).  Correct me if I'm wrong."
KarmaCourt,3dndwc,nabaro,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:03:58 2015 UTC,"speculation applies to the witnesses being called to make assumptions that they are not qualified to make, and defamation can only be used if the statement is proven beyond reasonable doubt to be false.   So wait just to make sure I understand. What you're saying is it's the opposite side's job to prove that what you say is false?  As far as I know witnesses aren't allowed to speculate or give their opinion in court. They can only talk about real facts. But that's real Canadian laws and it's not really applied here.  And so what you're saying is it could be /u/nabaroo who deleted the posts and not necessarily the defendant /u/paulthekoala59. Am I correct?   My job as defense is not to prove what did or didn't happen, my job is to show that the scenario proposed by the prosecution does not have sufficient evidence to be proven to be true and/or illegal.

First, let me set the scene. It had been months since The Supreme Being graced us with an AMA, thus I had not been frequenting the subreddit, preferring to worship in private. You can imagine my reaction when The Supreme Being personally confided in me that he would be doing another AMA. However, before I could ask him any questions, the AMA was removed! /u/bigri23 immediately told me that this atrocity was created by the owner of the subreddit, /u/paulathekoala59. The conversation mentioned can be found here. Personal information has been censored to protect the identities of those involved. The Supreme Being would, in my opinion, have no reason to falsify these claims. Also, the fact that I have recently been removed as moderator, as can be seen in the original post, is a choice that can only be executed by the owner. This leads me to believe that /u/paulathekoala59 is abusing his power tyrannically and committing sacrilege against The Supreme Being, /u/bigri23.   Thank you for hearing my testimony, and by the name of /u/bigri23, I hope justice is duly served."

KarmaCourt,3dndwc,bigri23,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:44:06 2015 UTC,"I will concede that it is not sufficient testimony to base an opinion on the word of another. However, the question is not whether or not /u/paulathekoala59 deleted the AMA; it is whether or not /u/bigri23 was free to post the AMA, and he clearly felt he was not at liberty to do so, as you can see by this conversation between /u/bigri23 and /u/paulathekoala59:  http://i.imgur.com/EZK9Z2W.png  But we shall wait for /u/Kikool42's judgement on this matter. :)"
KarmaCourt,3dndwc,MacoNope,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:53:41 2015 UTC,Nods head... takes notes... mhhmm  You can proceed to further your argumentations. My answer regarding whether or not bigri was forbidden or not to post is like a verdict (it concerns one of the charges) and therefore will be given at the end.
KarmaCourt,3dndwc,bigri23,4,Wed Jul 22 04:24:51 2015 UTC,"And did he give his consent? I think not! You coerced him into deleting his own AMA. /u/bigri23 will soon provide us with some concrete evidence of the pressure you blatantly applied for him to remove said post.    As he did not notify us ahead of schedule   He is the Supreme Being (rule #1 of the subreddit). Why would you question his motives?  Your Honor, Objection #2!  The defendant has legal representation. He should not have the right to an outburst in court. To have such a right would turn every KarmaCourt into an orgy of heated debate with no resolution! It is the job of his attorney to represent him."
KarmaCourt,3dndwc,jon_alel,2,Tue Jul 21 03:41:06 2015 UTC,He does have the right to self-representation if he should choose to exercise it. This would however negate his right to legal counsel.
KarmaCourt,3dndwc,Kikool42,3,Tue Jul 21 03:47:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Sorry if my comment was misunderstood. Because he has legal counsel, to exercise that right would be to relinquish that counsel. If he wants to do so, that's fine with me."

KarmaCourt,3dndwc,Thimotron,4,Wed Jul 22 04:25:09 2015 UTC,"Good evening.  I will be testifying against /u/paulathekoala59.   Let me preface this by saying this loathsome husk of a man has committed more atrocities than can be put to parchment lo this past century.   However, his most recent offense was on none other than my namesake subreddit: /r/bigri23. Having accumulated the necessary karma first (no doubt by secondary or otherwise frowned upon means), he created the subreddit without my permission and exacted what can only be described as a reign of terror.   He removed my kinsman and unpaid consultant /u/nabaro as moderator, was generally incompetent (not only as a subreddit owner, but as a human being), was obnoxious and abused capitalization, and worst of all...  Clamored for the removal of my second AMA. http://i.imgur.com/EZK9Z2W.png  How dare he? What gives him the right to passively-aggressively call for my posts removal? Fearing the same fate as /u/nabaro, I removed the post.   Now his time is done. It's time for this tyrant to burn at the stake for his hersey. I have nothing more to say about this abomination. May whatever Pagan Gods he holds belief in have mercy on his soul.  Thank you.   I remain,   /u/bigri23"
KarmaCourt,3dndwc,Professor_Doodles,4,Wed Jul 22 12:51:22 2015 UTC,"Precisely! The owner of the subreddit has broken the very first tenet of our creed. How dare he?  As you see, ladies and gentlemen, /u/bigri23, the Supreme Being Himself, feared a ban. What did he do? He submitted to foul pressure from --points across the room-- none other than /u/paulathekoala59!   What is written in our Constitution? We have the right to post in any subreddit without fear of persecution, as long as we follow subreddit rules. That clearly did not happen here. And Bigri23 was certainly within the rules."
KarmaCourt,3dndwc,Professor_Doodles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:44:30 2015 UTC,"Your honor, if you don't mind, I will begin cross-examining the witness.  /u/Bigri23, you imply in your statement that you removed your AMA out of fear of being removed as mod, just to specify, is this the case?  If so, was it also out of fear that you did not object to the removal beforehand?  You also mention in your statement, ""Previous atrocities"", care to elaborate?  /u/Bigri23, why do you think that my client created /r/Bigri23, a subreddit completely dedicated to the fact that you are a god among men?  Has /u/paulthekoala59 directly threatened you in any way?  Has my client ever said anything negative about you?  Is there any other reason, besides the removal of /u/nabaroo, that would cause you to fear removal?  Thank you, that is all. I ask you to please keep your responses within the scope of the questions, and wish you a good day."
KarmaCourt,3dndwc,jon_alel,3,Tue Jul 21 03:53:52 2015 UTC,"Good evening, /u/MacoNope. I'll respond to these questions as honestly and civilly as possible.   As I said, /u/paulathekoala59 had removed /u/nabaro as moderator for no reason. Going against his will was not something I was going to risk, especially since it's my subreddit, and I want to be a moderator on it.   Yes, I didn't object for the same reasons.   As they aren't directly related to this case, I feel no obligation to elaborate.   While his intentions may have been good from the start, it's clear based on his recent actions that he has let this power get to his head. The subreddit is my namesake. I am it's supreme being, and deserve control of it.   He has prevented me from changing some of the rules (on risk of ban). Unfortunately, at this time I can't find a record of these incidents, they happened over a year ago, near the time of the subreddit's creation. Of course, he has removed posts and moderators in the past for no apparent reason.   His past behavior (as written above).   That's all I have to say on these matters. Thank you.    I remain,   /u/bigri23"

However, Bigri himself agreed, because some of the supreme being's posts were being censored by Paul. I actually can't translate the second half that much, but it pretty much states that Paul has no respect for Bigri23.

KarmaCourt,3di1cp,this_is_notmyopinion,8,Thu Jul 16 16:22:02 2015 UTC,"Law and Order theme music plays. Prosecutor enters courtroom with a clearly very expensive pair of sunglasses, playing the air guitar and mouthing the final bouncing verse of that unforgettable jingle.  Your honor, the case is so clearly a fraud that it has already been decided in the court of public opinion. But true justice can only come from your court, handed down by your wise and considered ruling. The prosecution is confident that the court will find that the truth is that /u/helpppppmemybrother has shamefully abused of the public's willingness to be gullible lambs by appealing to their goodnaturedness and that he has made a farce of a very serious situation that many unfortunate souls do find themselves in. For such blatant disregard for truth on the internet, we respectfully ask that he be held without bail and forced to wear a pink jumpsuit with pants-on-fire print and a hat with flowers on it until such time as the court has issued it's ruling. And if he falls asleep during trial, we ask that your honor orders the bailiff to draw a penis on his face, with permanent marker.   First, the prosecution would like to present Exhibit B in which it is clear that someone who knows a lot about something related to this kind of thing calls the defendant's post total bullshit, not only on the basis of how the defendant wrote his post, but also for various other reasons with which the expert has no affirmed expertise, so glaring is the bullshitedness of this bullshit. Your honor, I would like to point out that this expert made a whole lot of common sense. Also, he used proper punctuation and formatted his post in not one but multiple paragraphs further supporting his assertion that he has some sort of degree, or at least knows how to write properly.   Second, we would like to inform your honor that the prosecution has karma-subpoena'd /u/Soeiner and expects that he will probably ignore the request. However, in the event that he should present himself in court, we would like to ask him one question.  1- In your professional opinion as the world-renowned foremost authority of the linguistics of spanish-speaking immigrants writing on the internet in English, how would a spanish-speaking english-learning user acutally write ""they do not come here by law. we come here by pay someone money. i love this place. very good city. i also make nice friends""?  Third, your honor, when /u/helpppppmemybrother was offered proper advice, dutifully translated in Spanish, on how to resolve his situation, he continued to respond in English. A person struggling to get assistance for such a serious problem would not resort to a poorly mastered second language, when presented with the opportunity to converse in the mother tongue, to continue a conversation about how they may free themselves from abuse and avoid deportation and possible death. The stakes are too high. This has been stated by our star expert witness in exhibit B, but I'm repeating it because it makes sense to me and I want to suggest that I thought of that on my own.   The prosecution stands for cross examination by the defense."
KarmaCourt,3di1cp,LiarAmongAll,10,Thu Jul 16 19:15:31 2015 UTC,"The extremely nervous look public defender enters the court room carrying a brief case with papers sticking out. His hair is disheveled and his suit looks as though he's been sleeping in it. He steps forward and begins speaking, so eloquently that his charm raises instantly +13   Your honor, the case is so clearly a fraud that it has already been decided in the court of public opinion.    Interesting, I don't see how public opinion has any bearing in this courtroom. These are the halls of Justice, not a public forum where just any nobody can come in and throw out their opinions. Look at a case from the past, one about OJ. The public thought this man to be guilty without a doubt, but the Great System of Justice acquitted this gentle giant, proving him, without a doubt, innocent.   For such blatant disregard for truth on the internet, we respectfully ask that he be held without bail and forced to wear a pink jumpsuit with pants-on-fire print and a hat with flowers on it until such time as the court has issued it's ruling. And if he falls asleep during trial, we ask that your honor orders the bailiff to draw a penis on his face, with permanent marker.    I second this. That's funny. But I also throw in my own motion that the prosecution be treated in the same manner after my client is found innocent!   First, the prosecution would like to present Exhibit B in which it is clear that someone who knows a lot about something related to this kind of thing calls the defendant's post total bullshit, not only on the basis of how the defendant wrote his post, but also for various other reasons with which the expert has no affirmed expertise, so glaring is the bullshitedness of this bullshit.   Well, let's see... Did he provide any proof of his so called ""expertise"" in the matter? Did he take a picture of his Danny degree and provide us with a real reason to believe his words? OF COURSE HE DIDN'T! The saying goes that everyone is an expert on Reddit /s. Unless he's shown his RL credentials, what makes his expertise more believable than my client being who he says he is?   Also, he used proper punctuation and formatted his post in not one but multiple paragraphs further supporting his assertion that he has some sort of degree, or at least knows how to write properly.    Whoop de fucking doo my friend. Not only is logic flawed, it's dangerous. I'm sitting here, breaking down my defense into well structed paragraphs that are preceded by quotes from you. That's even more structured than your ""expert"". Are we to assume I have a degree as well? Cause that would be awesome, I'd love to pretend I have a degree! But I don't. Sorry   Third, your honor, when /u/helpppppmemybrother was offered proper advice, dutifully translated in Spanish, on how to resolve his situation, he continued to respond in English.    Cool story brokake. Makes me realize how intolerant reddit truly is. They expect you to speak their language at all times, then get mad when you do just that. Maybe my client was just doing what the social norms of reddit dictate. I mean, come on, isn't it nicer that he replied in a way that the majority of reddit understands? If anything, he's being even more proper by responding how does. What if someone else had had his same problem, but couldn't find anything helpful because it was hidden from them. My client has helped the future, and here we sit, trying to have him punished? Absurd, to say the least...  The simple truth of all of this is that reddit doesn't want to help this guy. They want to make him out to be some horrid, evil monster that rapes donkeys and needs suck the blood from your children. In reality, he's just a guy, seeking help for a rather serious problem, and reddit is not only attacking him, but making fun of his broken English... Good job reddit, way to shine when it fucking matters. Your honor, I beg you to see this all for what it is. A witch hunt, and a bunch of dickheads leading it. Thank you, your honorable /u/Kikool42"

We hope you will join in the fun and play the part, but you are welcome not to. You can ignore us entirely, that´s just fine.   Sure, there is a 50/50% chance that it's a troll, but when in doubt in a case like that I prefer to take it seriously, to treat it ""as if it were true"" and risk myself to pass for an idiot than making the mistake of mistreating a case.  We're not supposed to go to the defendants. They have to come to us. It's a sign of respect (they're not obliged to participate to the game and we shouldn't bring them into it either).  It's too late, you've done it and the guy will see it, but I hope people know that when there's half a chance that it's a serious real life issue it's better to respect the person and appear naive than making a mistake. KarmaCourt is a simulation of the justice system (although turned into satire yes). I don't think 911 take things easy when they have a small doubt that it's a troll.

There is not enough evidence to prove that OP is lying. A single testimony from an expert witness (who, by the way, doesn't want to discredit OP, link 1 & link 2) is not enough.  Secondly, the most important thing is that on a subreddit like /r/legaladvice the credentials of the original posters should not be questioned (unless they are really obvious). It is our duty to help the poster no matter if his story is true or not, because it is wiser to not take chance to discredit something that could be true. Let's take it as if it were true, and if it's not it doesn't matter it won't change our life after all. I would have judged it differently if it were in real life, but it's the Internet here.

Let's turn now - for a second To Toste's predicamen' And see how his case Though brought without grace Is worthy of our time, I reckon.    Here is a man So wronged that he can Bring forward these claims How his karma's been maim'd And left for dead by an orangutan.    And who is the culprit? [Though nothing rhymes with culprit] We must look to the Admins Who have left us all saddened And still nothing else rhymes with culprit.    To the Admins, we say This system shall not stay Karma for self-posts -It's less karma than most Shall be a thing, one day."

America is all about getting to the top and distinguishing yourself, making your mark and being remembered. It's the dream. Look at our Army!

That doesn't make me the president of the United States but I have the freedom to say that about myself even if no one else will view me that way.    The KarmaCourt should be the same way.  I should be allowed to call myself the borliff even if the nickname is most commonly associated with /u/WolfDragoon97.  If reddit is to encompass all the ideals, beliefs and thoughts of all people (except the Amish which don't use the internet), I'm sure all people will generally agree that no one word should be off-limits.  (World music in the background)   I'm borliff.  We are legion but also just /u/unidan.  Some fight for the right to vote or the right to marry.  I fight to call myself borliff.  Join the right side of history and allow me the freedom for me and my partner to call ourselves borliff.    I may be the minority with regard to this subject.

This has not been easy considering the level of reality involved with this. Karma Court is a satirical place. It's the place where we can take revenge towards virtual injustices by role playing something that leaves us to believe a part of ourselves could have lived and worked in the real Justice system. However, this time it's real. Even though it's virtual, it's for real. We are mixing real facts (someone who got fired in real life) and virtual communication together (a strike on a website). At the beginning of this trial we enjoyed calling it the trial of the century. Some people even stated that the eyes of the world (mostly Reddit's world) were oriented towards us, and some of them even asked if this satirical play would bring something meaningful to all this mess. Well, I would like to try to make this case meaningful. So for once, there will be no staging written in italics, no funny inside joke related to Reddit, but just seriousness and wisdom (because this world cruelly lacks wisdom). I'm not pretencious. I'm just a normal guy, a philosophy student who is also passionate about the Laws, who's been here for a bit more than a year. My ups and downs in my life were appeased by the greatest source of entertainment I've ever found: this actual website. So please, consider this like a letter towards both the administrators and the users. I really hope /u/Kn0thing and /u/spez will read this. They can think it’s all wrong, they can think I'm just reinventing the wheel, I won’t mind. I just hope they will read it fully and carefully because I will attempt my best to make my intention real, which is to bound the community and the admins together, and remind what we're looking at in our computer screens. Nothing has made me more upset than seeing this website divided between the users and the managers. If there is only one political ideal I believe in, it's that the leaders and their followers should be together no matter what happens.     We all know what happened. The truth is, the four charges I wrote in this case can be summed in only one: the admins are being accused of having a bad relationship with the users. The next truth is: I should be the plaintiff and the users should be on the defendants' bench too. Don't get me wrong: there is no problem of communication. Absolutely none, because communication is there when you and them want to. On the one hand, you tell us something, and it's there on the front page seen by everyone. On the other hand, you are received with literally everything: from insults and vulgarities to thoughtful critics and ideas. You'll read what we write you and vice versa. However what you don't tell us, it's because of many reasons. Among them are the legal reasons (things such as why M. Victoria was let go) and relationship reasons (things like what do you plan to do with us in the next five years). Hide from us what is legal (we don't need to know why she was fired), but please don't hide from us what you want to do with us. Don't hide your ideas and intentions because of business and commercialization. After all we're the clients, consumers, customers, users, whatever you call it, we'll be receiving your ideas and it's better to tell us than hiding it from us and risking a hit in the face when it comes out. What should we, the users, do in turn? I think we should not cultivate such hate towards you. People saying the hate is there because of you are wrong. Hate is a choice. All these charges are summed up as the result of a bad relationship between the administrators and the users, and both groups are guilty of it. I'm not giving any sentence since the moderators already gave you one (the count down until the end of Q3). You also apologized publicly. This is very brave from you and it should be respected. However, words are words and they will become more meaningful as you produce concrete acts. The only sentence I can give to this community to make this relationship work better is a simple question: what can they do to make this website better?     Now let's move on, let's have some philosophy if you will. As you can see I like big words. Big words and fancy motivational sentences are great, and I love them more when they relate to real actions. Here's a list of values written by the administrators themselves:   Remember the human Be authentic, passionate, and empathetic. Treat others as you would in person, and remember we all make mistakes. Champion diversity. Default to transparency, and when you can’t be transparent, be honest.   The key words here are passionate, mistakes and honesty. I don't know how to say it so I will make it straight to the point: the difference between you, the admins, and the community is that **you have a business to run and they have a passion to run.* Reddit is your work, Reddit is their passion. You don't approach it the same way and no matter what you say it's the truth. Otherwise Reddit wouldn't be a company owned by a bigger company and there wouldn't be jobs and money involved. This website is obviously a passion for those who don't work for it. The moderators made this strike out of passion. You can see it by how they answered your call to stop it. I'm also doing this because Reddit is a passion.     Even though you have a business to run, make sure our passion is taken into consideration 100%. In return, you'll see that this same passion will help your business run and prosper. It can go hand in hand. You might already know this. It's just that sometimes it doesn't look like you do. So I prefer to remind you once again: our passion helps your business if you take it in consideration, and your business will help our passion as well. This is an easy circle, I shouldn't be teaching something new to anyone here, but it's just a reminder.  We are all humans, and making mistakes is one of the most obvious things we do in life. You made some and so did we. Your recent mistake wasn’t firing Victoria but to not prevent the concerned people. Other mistakes were such as not listening to the moderators when it comes to the tools, taking too much time for them, etc. We made the mistake of behaving like terrible children, we made the mistake of being so hateful, etc. Even children in kinder garden behave better than us.  However what I see from the past week is that your mistakes are now limited. We swallow them less and less. To make the link with your last saying, be default to transparency. Take the risk of asking before imposing. Your mistakes are now counted. The community does it because they hold to their passion. In exchange, we shall be less hateful.     What is this passion I'm talking about here? Well, let's look at it everyone. Look at your screen. Don't you see it? It's Reddit. We all forgot that what we have is outstanding: a forum accessed by millions of people over the world. Art is created here, people share their interests here, people create imaginary plays, they create games, they share their lives on the basis of trust, people even meet to have sex because of this website for fucks sake. Isn't it amazing? We have free speech. Yes we do. Free speech is not being able to talk about something, free speech is about being able to complain that we can't talk about something. For what it's worth, we shouldn't be divided this much. I see people jumping over each other's jokes, I see complicity between the lines of text and I see a will to communicate between each other, with each other, and to each other.     This. Is that what we want? Did we all come here to fuck this place up and make it such a mess so that it dies in its inside? I came here to talk about my life interests, I came here to laugh and entertain myself, and so did you all. What bonds us together is this will to communicate among ourselves and fraternize over the things that make our hearts beat. From the bottom of your heart, is this what you want? Do you want this website to be over? Then stop insulting the admins, stop hoping you can move things that you have no control over (a petition to remove the CEO? You really think that's going to change something?).  Remember this: the upvotes and the downvotes do not matter. What matters is what you write, what you do, and what you can give to the rest of the world. I do not want to see people thinking that the CEO is at their mercy, I don't want to read death threats towards the admins, and most of all, I do not want people to think this website is going to die soon. IT. IS. NOT. We have a system of communication extraordinary outstanding in front of our eyes. Let's use it for the sake of using it, not to kill it. And if you're here to only bring evil and create a mess, then you are not worth reading and you should not be here.     I am not asking for peace on this website. I am asking for everyone, admins and users, to fit in the same spirit, to share what we call teamwork in sports."
KarmaCourt,3cvnml,soundwave145,7,Sat Jul 11 03:57:18 2015 UTC,"(CONTINUED)  Let me tell you this Reddit: I have a dream.  I dream that this website will one day succeed to embody all ideas, all philosophies from the greatest thinkers this world has ever known, that all images and all symbols can stand in one place, having as their only barrier an URL address made of two slashes surrounding the letter ""r"". I have a dream that one day /r/anarchy could stand beside /r/economy and /r/personalfinances, that /r/islam stands between /r/philosophy and /r/atheism as well as /r/worldnews. I have a dream that people can cultivate hate towards fat people without harassing them and that they can also hate skinny people if they want to, that they can hate fate people meanwhile others can enjoy pictures of dead corpses, with, a few scrolls further down, other people praising cuteness of pets of all kinds. All of this in the same place. All ideals embodied in one single website to prove the world that nothing is black or white, but everything can be possible under the glance of a shining rainbow.   This dream also means that there will be conflict again on Reddit. The moderators and administrators have to be prepared for it. To do so, you, me, the users, the administrators, the managers, the moderators, and the anonymous visitors, will have to work hand in hand to make our relationships last so that we can cultivate something much better than the hate that seems to dominate the voting system these days: our will to communicate about what we love the most.  After all only the time and flow of users will tell us how this website turns out. Let's do what we can do the best to keep content posted and make sure that time will only win over us in 10, 15 or 50 years. It's already been 10 years. Let's make the next 10 as good if not better, will you?  This is it. I have nothing else to add. Please, take some time, whoever you are, to think about what you want this website to become and how you can make it become this way. An old man once told me ""You are the change you want to see. Embody this change.""  I now invite you all to give some rest and peace to this website, and stop the hate until the promises made by the administrators become real.     Yours truly,  Mr. /u/Kikool42, Judge of The Karma Court and proud user of Reddit.com."

It was like any other pointless,stupid day, except that I had my phone (quite the rare occasion in BCT). I was speaking to Mr. /u/ineededtosaythishere, when he informed me of his decision to make Squiffy a mod. HOLY SHIT! I don't think I could have been happier! She deserved it, more than anyone! Then my day went on. I was in great spirits.... that was soon to end. You see, we were smoked that day, quite intensely, I must admit... I should have seen that as a sign of things to come.  Fast forward: I decided to sue the fuck out of Squiffy... Damnit, too far forward. Rewind: Squiffy and I were a talkin'. She out of nowhere sends me a message with a link... I should not have clicked it... such horrors lurked behind that blue link...  She made a statement of resignation on the same page that brought her to modship. Not only was this shitting all over my faith in the future of KC, but it was a direct Golden Shower on /u/ineededtosaythishere. She abandoned us. Not just me, but the KC community as a hole mourned... She sat there and tried to convince us that it was for ""othwe reasons"", but we all knew what she meant. She felt better than KC, better than us lowly shitbags, waiting patiently for her modship to arise... Now, here we sit, down one of the best Mods we potentially had. We all know IRL issues should never interfere with our sweet KC. Just look at me. I was gone 6 months, but did that stop the biggest case in KC history from happening? Fuck no!

KarmaCourt,3cuopn,SquiffyMcSquifferton,2,Sun Jul 12 02:51:43 2015 UTC,"Stands up and goes in the well (the space between the judge's bench and the counsel tables).  Turns to the prosecution counsel.  Sit tight, cause it's gonna shake a lot.     Your Honor,  The Prosecution Counsel's will to go in trial is in fact a misunderstand from their part regarding the reasons of my client's departure from her position at Karma Court. She was in her right to do so. I will explain why she was right but in order to understand her, you need to understand who she is.  My client, /u/SquiffyMcSquifferton, is a model Reddit. She started school at a very young age. As you can see in the following evidence, Evidence D1, my client located on the far left of the photo is a model student. She did great studies was never given any complain. She was an angel and still is. Her education was not easy (the belt still had two meanings in education at that time). However as you can see she was a model student and often admired from her peers. She was even victim of the jealousy of others who would try to copy her, such as the man in the back of the classroom trying to cover his face by hiding behind her classmate.   YEARS LATER, my client remains a model for her peers. As you can see in the next evidence: clicks on the powerpoint, Evidence D2, my client is posing happily there as one of the first female police officers of Karma Court in Manhattan. She was the very first female Justice of Karma Court Your Honor! If that's not honourable, I don't know what is. She always did her work on time, and was ALWAYS helpful to her colleagues. She always did a wonderful job and never received a complain. She was lovely and loved her, admired by everyone, and last but not least she did a quality top notch job.  However, the good cannot always stick with people. My client had the unfortunate obligation to leave because of health issues with people she loves. She needs to take care of her real life and decided to step back in order to love the people who matter the most to her during their time period of illness.   And therefore, let me please as you this question Your Honor: Are we going to punish someone who wants to take care of the people she loves in real life? Are we going to blame someone for stepping down to her position to take care of an ill person she LOVES ??? Your Honor, the roots of /r/KarmaCourt are based at the essence of humanist values, and some of theses are love, protection andrespect. It is clearly obvious that we should wish her the best instead of accusing her to leave us for the safety of someone else.  Now that this has been explained, let me please draw your attention on the real person you should have in your crosshair: /u/LiarAmongAll, also vaguely known as iolpiol8.  This man likes to brag that he did well here. However I did my homework and I was never able to find his work and his achievements. Why? would you ask. Well, he deleted his account. Why? The only good explanation I can find is that he did something bad, ohhh something very very bad.  According to Evidence D3, he was set on probation. Now, Your Honor, are we going to trust a man who made a huge mistake on Karma Court to the point that he got a sentence from it? That *THE JUSTICES GAVE HIM A ""EPIC FAIL"" FLAIR AND SET HIM ON PROBATION? Mr. Iolpiol8 did something very bad to the point that it is impossible to find it back in the KC archives. The closest thing I came to as Evidence D3.1 in which it is said that, I quote, ""/u/iolpiolp8 arrested for adultery as he his found red handed and pant sagging in extra-KarmaCourt activities"". Are we going to allow a man who lies and commits adultery to prosecute a young, successful woman who needs to dedicate her time for her loved ones? I let you give the answer. It's as simple as 2 and 2 make 4.  On top of it, the Prosecution Counsel likes to lie. His username says it all: ""Liar Among All"". He also repeatedly committed suspicious retirements in Karma Court. I counted that he made at least two retirements (Evidence D3.2 of his first retirement). He also passed himself for someone else, and came here by hidding himself from others, as shown in Evidence D4. ""My fine friends of KC, you have all been tricked"" The answers from his peers are made of anger: ""bastard, liar, bastard"", and so on.  Your Honor, shall we give voice to a man who disguises himself to spy his colleagues? This is total unprofessional as well as disrespectful behaviour. I cannot believe we would allow a man with such a dark side step in court and accuse one of us. This is literally a spit from him to the face of my client for all the loyal years she spent at Karma Court. It is also a behaviour close to a harasser. On Evidence D5 we can clearly read the prosecution counsel say ""I will sue the fuck out of you; turn your happy ass around."" Your Honor, is this the way a prestigious prosecution counsel as Mr. Iolpiol8 pretends to be should behave? I doubt so. Even though a prosecutor is after someone, he must respect the defendant. I, as someone who insists on the fair equity between a defendant and a plaintiff, am not going to let this go like this.  Your Honor, there is more, and I promise I'll finish with this.  This morning, I accidentally received a package from a mysterious unknown source. This package contained a series of photos displaying the activities of the Prosecution Counsel during his last retirement. You will see, it's suspicious like Stepp Blatter in a Swiss bank.  Here is Evidence 6 which displays the van in which Mr. Iolpiol8 took the route to flew in Canada. That's right, the prosecution counsel flew and hid himself in the land of pucks of raccoons. Evidence 7 shows the prosecutor in Canada, walking in the snow suspiciously. Evidence 8 shows the prosecutor trying to seduce a little kid with maple syrup candies. Evidence 9 shows him in a yellow t-shirt at the back, walking in a Canadian city and looking suspiciously again right and left multiple times. If that ain't suspicious, I don't know what is.  But more importantly, Evidence 10.1,2,3 (.2 & .3) show a police intervention RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS HOUSE ! THE PROSECUTION COUNSEL HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE CANADIAN POLICE DURING HIS RETIREMENT. The cause of this police force intervention is not publicly known but some say it was because he made nuts traffic.  Your Honor, authorizing this man to step a foot in this prestigious courtroom and accusing an innocent a sweet lady is beyond me. I CANNOT CONCEIVE THIS! Especially when we know that the plaintiff himself has had more troubles with the justice than my client.  Your Honor, the plaintiff and prosecution counsel is nothing less than another Daniel Hardman, a man who wants to give pain to others in /r/KarmaCourt because apparently he wants a revenge. My client is a model here, respected by everyone and she has always had the right to quit her job. Of course becoming a moderator implies that we take responsibility to stay, but my client has faced real life events that prevent her from doing her job as well as she used to, and she would rather let someone else with more time on his hand to do it instead of her.  Your Honor, I could go on and on to describe you what kind of outrageous and scrupulous man Mr.LIARamongall is, but I am sure that we all want to avoid a blood bath here.  Which is why I come to you to propose a settlement. Since my client left her position and prefered to let someone who has more time (I don't dare to say more qualified since she was exceptional), I suggest that I replace her as a Moderator in /r/KarmaCourt and /r/KarmaCourtBlog. I have time, I have a clean record (without being pretentious, I made the case that is now the top 1 of all time on KC, I took care of the most important cases this year, and I am one of the most promising lawyers here), and my client can testify that she herself wrote to the Justices of KC to let them know that she recommends me to take her place (I have the PM, and she can testify).  Your Honor, my client did not leave this place empty. She did not just took off with the wind, like Mr. Iolpieaule did many times. She proposed a settlement to the moderators. She proposed a replacement, and that replacement is me.  Thank you Your Honor.  P.S: These evidences from my mysterious source are 100% authentic. I can guarantee you that you will never find them on the Internet."
KarmaCourt,3cuopn,Kikool42,4,Tue Jul 14 00:52:24 2015 UTC,"LiarAmongAll sets down his crack pipe, slowly releasing the smoke from the now crumbled rock. He turns off his laptop containing gratuitous amounts of beastiality, necrophillic gmilfs, and loli. He stands from his chair, as his eyes slowly roll into the back of his head, an effect of the speedball combo of heroin and crack. His eyes then look forward in a blank stare, bracing for the hallucinations about to come forth, having just finished a ten strip of acid, he knew he had only minutes  slowclap.jpg my friend. You have dug up such succulent items of my past, you have brought tears to my eyes through such wonderful memories. Few could have honored me in such a way...  But that's not what this case is about! This isn't about the constant menace I was in my previous life, this isn't about the children I tried to lure into my van (I have really wonderful candy in there, I'm a confectioner in my spare time), this isn't even about the time I tried to sue my children (little bastards still have no lawyering skill, IT'S BEEN 6 FUCKING MONTHS SINCE I'VE SEEN YOU SON, GROW THE FUCK UP! YOU'RE 5 NOW). This trial is about the injustice done to me, not about the many, many, many, many, many, many ways I've wronged the wonderful shitbags of KC.  I didn't make myself clear. I have been directly wronged by her, attacked by her careless decision. Imagine, if you will, a scared little Private, constantly yelled at, day in day out. Imagine he's cut off from the outside world, he knows no happiness, he has no motivation... This was me. For nearly 6 months, as I trained to be a soldier so I could protect our dear country, I was in complete misery. Few know what truly happens in BCT, but imagine being tear gassed with military grade CS gas. Imagine walking 24 kilometers in 12 hours, all the while you're wearing a Kevlar vest with ceramic plates, a Combat helmet, and a rucksack eating roughly 70 pounds. I was misery embodied. But one fine day, they let us use our phones..  And what a day that was. So imagine, a somewhat happier Private surfing through the place he loves most. He gets a message from a great friend (love your face /u/ineededtosaythishere) about plans to make another one of the Private's great friends a mod. These aren't just faceless nobodies behind a keyboard to him, these are people he knows, people who he had real world contact, people he trusted. He was even happier now! Squiffy, the one who sent him great books and some candy while he was going through such a horrible thing, was to be a mod, was to finally step up to the role she, more than anyone in all of KC or reddit, deserved.   The Private had to give up his phone, but knowing what would be waiting for him made all the hardships he was facing so much more bearable. He even started to excel in his training, started stepping up for leadership positions, taking charge, embracing the suck.  This Soldier, who was away from his Family, his friends, and everything he knew and held dear, had finally begun to progress..  But that just couldn't last... He got his phone again, talking with Squiffy for a brief spell before she chose to drop the news... She was finished as a mod. While the soldier understood her reasoning, it was too much for him... His happiness was crushed in an instant. His hopes, his future, all swept out from under him. He knew what must be done, and it hurt him to do it, but there was no other way. He tried to get her to stay, but the beloved /u/SquiffyMcSquifferton was done.  He moved forward with his plan. She left him no choice. So he chose to sue her sweet bartending ass back to the stone age.   Now, you all may wonder how this is a karma crime... How can I come back from having my dreams crushed as so? How can I ever reattain the Pure Karmic Genius that I had prior to this. She ruined any hope of a future career in Karma for me. By leaving us as she did, I will never be the same. And that's why justice must be served.  Do I think Mr /u/Kikool42 would make a good mod? Ya damn right I do, he loves this place, almost as much as me. But to call himself a ""replacement"" to her? Atrocious and unacceptable. He could never replace her... No one can.  Anywho, the acid I took is fully kicking in, your honorable lizard. I'm gon take a nap.  he drops to the floor, convulsions overtaking him. He soon passes into a drug induced coma, possibly never to wake again.

KarmaCourt,3cuopn,dellmill,3,Tue Jul 14 01:53:14 2015 UTC,"Few could have honored me in such a way...   So what you're saying is you are proud of the mistakes you made during your past?  Your Honor, /u/Professor_Doodles, this has everything to do with the case! The plaintiff does not sue my client, /u/SquiffyMcSquifferton because of love, but because he wants to scam her.  This morning, I found on my door front Evidence 11. This evidence is what seems to be a letter written from the plaintiff to someone called ""Mary-Jane"". In this letter, he writes: ""I'll sue the shit out of SquiffyMcSquifferton so I can collect Karma to live the rest of my life with you in Cancun.""  Your Honor, this means that the plaintiff is harassing my client so he can get Karma to diseappear once again from KC and live in the South with my client's Karma. THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS!  Your Honor and the dear members of this audience, how can we allow a man with psychological issues to try to sue someone he pretends to love if it's to fly away once again for his own interest?  I would like to point out that the plaintiff is doing harassing behaviours.   I didn't make myself clear. I have been directly wronged by her, attacked by her careless decision. Imagine, if you will, a scared little Private, constantly yelled at, day in day out. Imagine he's cut off from the outside world, he knows no happiness, he has no motivation... This was me.

Squiffy, the one who sent him great books and some candy while he was going through such a horrible thing, was to be a mod, was to finally step up to the role she, more than anyone in all of KC or reddit, deserved.    This is the exact behaviour of an unstable person, who leaves people in a sudden and comes back fully dependent from them. Your Honor, my client has a husband and she has children. She considered the plaintiff as a friend, no more. She made the choice to leave the moderation of KC because of illness and real life obligations, and we have here a plaintiff who wants her to ditch her sick loved one for his own pleasure, knowing that the plaintiff will be gone once again who knows when? This is insane and totally absurd. It's an aggravating mark of disrespect towards my client who wants to take care of her real life.  Your Honor, my client should not be tied to this subreddit and to its participants. Everyone here shall be free to leave when they want and this should be more understandable when it comes to reasons of illness and caring.   Your Honor, the plaintiff claims that my client was his friend. Let me ask you this question: Is this situation what a real friend should do? Should a real friend sue his friend because she decided to leave her position to take care of someone else and of her own life? Your Honor, this is not friendship. This is a mark of selfish dependence and the plaintiff clearly needs psychological help. Life is hard, and so is the Internet. However nobody should be tied up to someone else. We come here by ourselves, by our own will, and should not expect someone else to breast-feed us all the time. The plaintiff should learn that people do have obligations and that they cannot always respond to others' desires. The plaintiff doesn't have any needs. He has desires. Should we blame my client because she decided to answer to someone's need instead of another person's desires? I doubt so.   He could never replace her... No one can.   I would like to point out that the plaintiff pretends to love and admire my client. Well, if he respected her so much, he wouldn't mess with her departure, and instead offer her a more beautiful goodbye-best-luck-au-revoir than a sue.   it was too much for him... His happiness was crushed in an instant. His hopes, his future, all swept out from under him.    Again, a clear proof of social dependence. The plaintiff should seek help instead of being emotionally attached to someone who has a life to take care of.  Your Honor, are you going to give reason to the plaintiff's selfish happiness instead of my client's real life needs? She has to take care of her husband who is sick and who knows what he's suffering of.  The plaintiff's future is not locked. He can get over this. For God's sake, they're not even married. It's totally legit that my client would take care of her husband, the person she loves the most on Earth, instead of a friend she's never seen in real life. The plaintiff needs to get his shit together. His future is not crushed, and happiness is a thing that changes all the time. In fact, his future will only be crushed if he decides to. We all have a choice in life. I made the choice to be ambitious, to press my oranges every morning and to keep searching for love even when a girl I asked for dancing refused. I didn't stop there. I rose my shoulders and kept looking forward. The plaintiff doesn't move forward, and that's a choice of his, it's a free will. Sure he can be sad, even mad. But he shouldn't accuse my client of being directly responsible for his sadness since she never had anything to do with him in real life.  Once again, I pray you Your Honor, look at the balance: on the one hand you have the plaintiff who wants to be tied to someone he met in the virtual world, and on the other hand you have my client who desperately needs to take care of her ill husband and prefers to give moderation responsibilities to someone who has the time for it instead. My client doesn't feel capable at the moment to be a moderator, and we shouldn't blame her for having not tried, since she tried hard and never did anything wrong.   The plaintiff is nothing else than a selfish man who wants to sue my client because she has real life priorities. She didn't see her problems coming, and was definitely expecting to stay longer as a moderator. Shit happens, that's how life works. If the plaintiff is a soldier who can't bare with the army's environment, then he shouldn't be one. The first thing they teach in army is to get your shit together and not be psychologically unstable. Turns out the plaintiff is psychologically unstable and therefore needs treatment. He is selfish and dependent, he blames my client for leaving although she's leaving for real life matters- which are far more important than the plaintiff's desires, I hope you'll concede that.  Therefore the Defence takes back its proposal of settlement to bring another one on the table: the Defence will offer the plaintiff a series of therapy sessions in /r/psychology and /r/advice if the plaintiff drops the suit."

In fact, I urge you to provide proof that I am this character ioliolp88 you keep referring to! Sure, I'll even admit that was me... But you said it yourself, I'm a liar!

Edit: Oops, one last thing. /u/SquiffyMcSquifferton, thank you for being such an awesome friend. I'm glad I could keep you distracted in a good way with all you have going on. Keep up the great work, even though it's no longer from the mod side, you still make a mean mimosa!"
KarmaCourt,3cuopn,dellmill,2,Wed Jul 15 04:20:36 2015 UTC,"https://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourtBlog/comments/2v1wy0/the_return/  You are under oath and you don't have the right to lie to court (also implied in Article III of the Constitution). You were honest there and it can be seen in your flair on KC. If you weren't iolpiolp8, then it means everything you said in this trial is false (and would first make me win and second make you pay a lot for wasting people's time). It's you. You are you. A selfish bastard as they say in Bastardland.   These mistakes have helped shape me into the heartless, demoralized shell of a beast I am   Your Honor, the plaintiff admits some of his signs of character. He says he's heartless, which means he does not care about his friend. If he cared about her, he would let her go do her humanist duties and take care of her life.  OBJECTION Your Honor, the plaintiff and prosecution counsel do not have the right to talk to my client. Therefore his EDIT should not be counted in the court (and in your judgement). Plus it's some hypocritical bullshit. He said ""I'll prosecute the fuck out of you/the shit out of her"", he brought her into trial and now he's wishing her best? Oh please for God's sake.  I also would like to point out that the plaintiff didn't react to Evidence 11, which means that he admits he's doing it only for the Karma and that he doesn't love my client for real.  Your Honor, /u/Professor_Doodles, to make my conclusion statement I would like to review the charges with you:   CHARGE: Mod Abandonment; My client, /u/SquiffyMcSquifferton, did not abandon her position nor did she abandon the subs she was moderating. She is still a moderator of /r/KCBartendersGuild let's not forget that. She left because of real life duties. Your Honor, what should we value here? Someone's real life or someone's virtual life? The choice is clear to me, since we need the real life to be on the Internet. It happens that my client needs to take care of someone who is sick. Are we going to blame her for that? Lastly, she did not leave the place empty. She suggested that someone replaces her, she also suggested that she keeps supervising the KCBartenderGuild, and she said she will come back. Your Honor, my client didn't abandon this place because she loves it as much as we do, if not more. CHARGE: Failure to Mod: Your Honor, the Defence counsel demands the court to drop the charge since there is no evidence whatsoever presented by the prosecution counsel that supports this claim. My client never failed to moderate. She has a clean record and she was a successful participant of the KarmaCourt. Nothing here indicates that she committed ""failure"". And leaving this place to take care of someone she loves should not be considered a failure. CHARGE: immodesty.mpeg: Charge should be dropped since the prosecution failed once again to prove that my client is ""immodest"". She's very modest if we look at her message: ""[becoming a mod at KCBartendersGuild]  may give me a chance to get the knowledge I need to become a ""real mod"" My client doesn't pretend to be someone else, and she doesn't pretend to be some sort of superhero of the moderation. She's humble, and modest.   Your Honor, my evidences add everything up: my client was brought to trial by someone behaving selfishly and who doesn't care about her real life. My client wants to take care of herself, her husband, her ""pup"", and most importantly of her life. Are we going to dictate someone how to lead her own life? I hope not. She made the choice, and it's to the plaintiff's responsibility to take care of himself as well and stop being dependent from my client to the point he's harassing her.  Therefore the Defence Counsel still proposes a settlement: we offer the plaintiff two Karma points to go to /r/psychology and /r/advice so he can get the support he needs to cope with this event.  Your Honor, dear members of the audience, no matter what happens, my client is already out there in the real world, doing what we think is best: living her life. Remember that in order to come here you need time. My client doesn't have time. Or to phrase it otherwise: she puts her time where her priorities are, and I believe we should respect her for that, knowing that she will be back once the storm has passed.  Thank you."

Therefore his comment should not be taken into account, as well as his evidences (which are only drawings... they don't reflect what he said they were. nice try).  You can't speak with my client without me being here. No private conversations allowed. That's the real law. And my client uses her 5th amendment to remain silent.  Turns towards the prosecution  You're settling? I thought you saw that as losing?  Well Your Honor, the Defence REFUSES the settlement offered by the opposite counsel. It's /r/psychology or nothing. /u/Kell08 is a friend of yours (see here) and we see that there might be conflict of interest and we doubt he'll get the help he needs (that doesn't mean we doubt the qualities of Dr. Kell08).

KarmaCourt,3cdimt,MonkeyManJohannon,6,Tue Jul 7 01:50:07 2015 UTC,"VERDICT  Well, what can be said?  A valiant, balanced and rarely personal fight between both parties has occurred in this thread, and in that the denizens of mock outrage rejoice.  The prosecution clearly understands the pain of the plaintiff, and that's where a good prosecution comes from. The defence, although tenacious and gritty teethy, did concentrate their entire defence on the potential for coincidence in this affair.  So on one side we have the illusion of a life hardly lived, on the other we have coincidence. On one hand we have the final days of the GI Joe crew, no doubt with MonkeyManJohannon's name penned on to their collective boots, on t'other, we have ""FLUKE"". On one we have the chattering strings of the harp of childish awe as the smoke rose to the sky and insurance policies spiralled towards the handbasket department, on the other we have alledged finite possibilities.    If there had been a crew of jurors on this one, and you, yes YOU the reader, as you peruse these judicial milestones, ask youself if you could have  been on the jury on this one ... If there had been a jury    , as i was saying, they would no doubt have spotted the commonality, the compatible blood in the veins of both sides: yes, they both missed out on Action Man.    But that won't be the subject of justice today. No, justice is this: bollocks, he nicked it. Good try though. REPOST! GRANDTHEFT.JPG! THEFT OF A REDDITORS LIFE BLOOD!    The defendent is found guilty of all 3 charges, no matter what they are called, and that a CRIME such as this, a DISGUSTING and HEINOUS act as we have seen, should appear to taint and maim the spotless innocence of the bright eyed arsonist is a TRAVESTY IN ITSELF and so this court adds the charge of ""Damm that's callous"" to the bundle.   This court does hereby sentence the defendant to having all their childhood memories be posted by Anon on /b, all the time for months, and again next year. The defence counsel did, however, do a good job  with their slightly too one sided argument. They earn the right, and it's rare we bestow this on bright new attorneys, but they earn the right to be buried with their client. Good show. Take them away. Begin the cleanup process. Emergency exits are over there, where the door is. You have 90 seconds.   Ciao."

Remember those long summer afternoons where a refreshing drink came from the water hose, and parents were less concerned about your safety because, frankly, it was a different era.  These are the memories that my client (me) is being denied by one Dale8528...a man who, without regard to the harm he was committing, stole an artistic rendering of those memories we all had as children...a man who claimed a beautiful afternoon of childhood hijinks were his own, but they were not...they were NOT! (wipes sweat from brow).  Imagine if someone tried to steal your childhood memories...  Pepperidge Farm remembers..."
KarmaCourt,3cdimt,IAMASharkFighter,2,Tue Jul 7 16:05:59 2015 UTC,"Your honor, glorious Tiki Bar, and my beloved karma court reporters wink how you doin? First, I want to say you all look great today.  First I would like to address the charges brought upon my client one-by-one.  First off, you can't, by all means prove that this DIDN'T happen to my client. Sure, the prosecution made A comic about something that happened in his life, but things happen to people every day. You cannot say that this exact thing never once happened to any one else. The prosecution does not have a copyright on childhood memories. Hell, if we could do that I would file a claim over Ms. Jenkins next door in a bikini when I was 12.   hold for laughter  Second we have the charge of comic theft. Now I will agree that they are VERY similar. In fact, one might say they are identical. However, if you look closer at the evidence you will see that the prosecution's image file is in a PNG format, where as my client's is in a JPEG format. Now I'm no super-tech-guy, I mean I've deleted this reply 6 times just typing it out!  hold for laughter again  So regardless of how close these two images are, there is a distinct possibility that these are two completely different comics using a very similar art style telling the same story that happened to two completely different people?   hold for shocked murmering  Since we clearly have two separate incidences with two separate comics, there is no karma theft here, just a case of what we in the business call ""Samesies"".  We've all been there. We see a reddit link and go to post a funny comment only to find someone else posted it before you. Who among us hasn't uttered ""Oh man, I was totally gonna say that!"" Its a fact of life, like Baseball or American Apple Pie."
KarmaCourt,3cdimt,IAMASharkFighter,3,Tue Jul 7 16:54:52 2015 UTC,"Your honor, I'd like to point out a piece of this comic that I think defines the unique nature of it...something that cannot be dismissed as ""coincidence"" as opposing counsel would like to have you believe...and that is the last frame, and the cocked up leg on the curb.  This was a moment of genuine admiration on the part of the two boys as they thought back on their days event...that moment when they bonded in crime against nature, and were simply reflecting on that very human set of needs...life, liberty and the pursuit of melted toys by way of inferno.  Now could these comics be two different scenarios reflected in similar ways with such similar memories that the drawings are near identical?  Its entirely possible...but not the leg on the curb your honor...that leg on the curb says ""We did it...we did it and we liked it...""  This is not a second event, this was my event...stolen, re-uploaded as a lazy JPEG (I mean I scoff at the idea of such things for such an epic historic event), and then distributed to OUR peers as his own work.  FOR SHAME!  FOR SHAME SHAME!   This was my life sir.  But not only was it my life...it was my artistic rendition of my life...all the way down to a patriotic leg propped up in a satisfyingly American way.  9....11."
KarmaCourt,3cdimt,Yanky_Doodle_Dickwad,3,Tue Jul 7 19:51:22 2015 UTC,"This is getting ridiculous now. Not only has the prosecution claimed that anything that ever happened to them is their property alone, they are now claiming that they alone have the right to depict one leg above another? Perhaps if he were alive today Emanuel Leutze could have a case against the prosecution, as George Washington in the famous Washington Crossing the Delaware painting also has his leg up.  The claims the prosecution have made, and continue to make, are getting more and more outlandish as they are beginning to see that they... AHEM don't have a leg to stand on.  hold for standing ovation  At this point, its plain to see that this have devolved into nothing but the prosecution making rampant wild accusations at my client. The only sane thing to do is to throw this case out, before they decide that the simple act of hitting ""Submit"" on reddit is theirs and theirs alone."
KarmaCourt,3cdimt,Yanky_Doodle_Dickwad,2,Tue Jul 7 20:53:25 2015 UTC,"Defense is running for the hills...I can't blame them really, they are in the face of genuine sin and it is an ugly beast.  I'd like to point out a detail that may very well end this incessant bickering between myself and opposing council, and that is the reasoning for using the red and blue for the GI Joes in the first picture...  My friend always used Cobra Commander...who is blue.  I never got a chance to use him even though he always seemed like the coolest character because he was just so beautifully villainous...(his voice on the cartoon, on the other hand, was anything but).  Because I couldn't use cobra commander, I remember I always grabbed Bazooka, who wore the red football jersey...therefore my character in the comic is holding a red figure.  This was not a coincidence, this was purposely done because A.) It matched the colors of the figures we regularly played with, and B.) I was too lazy to draw them better.  Boom.  crowd erupts into a verbal awe, then cheers as I salute the american flag and drop my ball point pen, since i don't have a mic to drop"
KarmaCourt,3cdimt,IAMASharkFighter,2,Tue Jul 7 21:04:08 2015 UTC,"If anything the defense is moseying towards the hills, as we are aware that the hills are alive, with the sound of FREEDOM.   The prosecution states that the red GI Joe action figure is Bazooka, however, even the most cursory glance at my client's picture will show that the character used in his picture is actually a Red Ninja warrior, who as we all know had only a shaky alliance with COBRA and were tricked into working with Cobra Commander.   You see ladies and gentlemen of the court, not only is this a clear case of mistaken rage-comicry, but the prosecution is JEALOUS they didn't get to use the America hating Cobra Commander action figure, and instead had to use the far superior Bazooka action figure."
KarmaCourt,3cdimt,Yanky_Doodle_Dickwad,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:35:29 2015 UTC,"tear  I only ever wanted Cobra Commander because he had some awesome vehicles...truth is, I was always more inclined to pick the ninjas (snake eyes in particular), but we didn't have them at the time.  But returning to the case...the hills are indeed alive, alive with the sound of childhood memories being STOLEN by a man who has, in his short time here on reddit, made nearly all of his juicy, delicious karma by reposting things...this should define the fact that he reposted my comic (without credit to me for creating it), thus representing it as his own.  Let's say I go to a local art gallery, grab a picture off the wall that has been there for a few weeks, and then I request an area of the gallery as my own and place the picture in that area...gazing upon it with disgusting and fictitious nostalgic gaze...and patrons of the gallery begin to applaud the picture, patting me on the back and congratulating me for such a fine job...  It's an atrocity ladies and gentlemen...not a coincidence."
KarmaCourt,3cdimt,IAMASharkFighter,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:51:40 2015 UTC,"Let's say I go into an art gallery, I might get inspired, I might see someone doing things that I think ""Hey, I could do that too! I could be part of something fun!"" I do a watercolor that looks, unintentionally, a lot like an acrylic someone else did. An acrylic that was done 2 years prior that I had never seen. In fact, a lot of people have never seen it! So many people go to galleries and see so many pictures that they're glad to see my work.  Now, someone who painted a picture shows up and starts telling everyone ""That's my picture! I did that!"" That picture was a similar thing that someone else went through (other than a strange need to be Cobra Commander), and the gallery my work is in never once said that it looked like something else there.   There's no crime here, ladies and gentleman. Just someone who wanted to be Cobra Commander.  edit: Withdrawn"
KarmaCourt,3cdimt,Yanky_Doodle_Dickwad,2,Tue Jul 7 22:01:50 2015 UTC,"Objection your honor...this case isn't about my own childhood desires to play with the cobra commander toy.  Council is trying to paint me as a bad guy with passive aggressive insinuations that something is inherently ""wrong"" by wanting such things.  I'm not judging him for fighting sharks...the most misunderstood creature in the ocean.  Pertaining to your analanalogy...it seems your main argument is to try and ""paint"" this as a simple case of coincidence...but I must ask this...something inherently unique to original works are the errors, and you can see that the error I made in the ORIGINAL WORK...(long pause)...is that the child's head overlaps from the 6th frame back into the 5th frame.  You mean to tell me that you think so little of our fellow tiki bar patrons in this court room to assume they will dismiss this as further coincidence?

This man, /u/PM_YOUR__PROBLEMS, has been a nuisance on our fair community (Do I dare say moreso than Pao?), and it is time that we bring upon the justice they deserve and we so badly desire.   Not only do I present the evidence brought upon by /u/gnomey5678, but ALSO as proof the existence of an entire subreddit dedicated to the evil doing of this man! Yes, you may see for yourself that /r/PM_YOUR__PROBLEMS is a subreddit boiling over with rage almost matched by a slightly peeved bear. His wrongdoing to those people should not go unnoticed!  Seriously dude, I will just take the vodka and schnapps right now.  While he basked in evil indifference to the community around him, fully immersing himself in the comforts of /r/lounge, (Evidence D, I) where he flaunts his ill-gotten gains.  A man of his wealth (as shown by his donations to various organizations [Evidence C, K]) should not have to play the system to get gold, he should rather support the regime admin by his own money. Therefore, it is not an unreasonable jump to postulate that he did not make those purchases himself.   Swear to fucking Christ, just give me the vodka. I need a drink.  The screenshot in evidence K shows a screen that had been posted many times before in that thread. Considering the solid color of the background, it is not crazy to say that he could have simply copied the image of the ""700"" in ""2,700"" and paste that directly into his amount, making his donation seem higher than all the others. Due to lack of other machine identifying info, it could be postulated that he simply cropped and photoshopped another person's screenshot. If only he had an entire thread of screenshots to choose from.  Finally, I think it is important to look at the past amount of cases this man has faced within these hallowed halls for similar crimes (Evidence A). It's obvious that /u/PM_YOUR__PROBLEMS is a shitty asshole, and as we all know, nothing is worse than a shitty asshole.

KarmaCourt,3c4hwe,steampoweredkitten,8,Sun Jul 5 03:49:10 2015 UTC,"a gust of wind carrying a single rose petal whistles through the massive court doors, after which follows a few seconds of deafening silence, broken by faint footsteps echoing down the marble halls of Karmacourt. Then through the majestic doors of the courtroom walks Professor_Doodles, esq.  No glorious introduction today. This case, my friends of the court, is a very serious one. However, it is one with a very obvious conflict and an equally obvious resolution.   As many of you certainly know if you have kept up at all whatsoever with Reddit the past week, a peculiar case indeed has come to bear. The administrators of Reddit have released Victoria, a character of Reddit who was indispensable and near to each of our hearts. This case caused all kinds of outrage, abandonment, and even more importantly, censorship by the administators and moderators of Reddit.   The prosecution presents EVIDENCE D. As we can see here within the first few paragraphs, even one of the mods themselves has declared and admitted that Reddit is guilty of censorship of its own users. Now, what is Reddit? It is a community of users based upon common interest, ideas, and powered the ability to speak freely without threat of reprise beyond reprimand by fellow users and occasionally mods. It is a haven of expression and free communications worldwide.   Now, What would happen if the moderators of this fine place began to censor, prod, and otherwise debauch the trustworthiness of this site? This would upset a very many users, and very many would seek an alternative website to express themselves, a website such as the fledgling voat.co.   Now, voat.co is not designed to have this much growth so quickly, as was caused by the Reddit mods' actions against their users. Therefore the charges brought against the Reddit admins are indeed warranted and properly brought against. I see it that they are indeed guilty of:  x1 count of: Being massive Douche-canoes x1 count of: 2nd degree Effectively DDoSing Voat's servers by      overloading them with users from Reddit and therefore, x1 count of: Making the Voat Goat confused  As unfortunate as this case is, it must be so that those who have done wrong in this debacle are brought the justice which they have brought upon themselves.   The prosecution stands for cross-examination by the defence."
KarmaCourt,3c4hwe,Professor_Doodles,4,Sun Jul 5 04:16:51 2015 UTC,"Brilliant opening. We now await the defense's statement. (Nudge, nudge u/KnaveofHeart.)"
KarmaCourt,3c4hwe,steampoweredkitten,7,Sun Jul 5 04:40:25 2015 UTC,"Although what the prosecution is saying is true. All of it. Also despite the flashy, albeit impressive introduction. All they've stated on record, was precisely what I said, however conveniently leaving out a few crucial pieces of evidence.  To address EVIDENCE D, as presented by the prosecution, although the actions of the administrators have proven instrumental in the decision of the Reddit moderator coup, as well as the mass exodus to Voat, it cannot, within reason, be blamed on the administrators. Although their actions upset the community, rightfully so, they cannot be blamed for actions taken by another of their own free will. Just as you cannot blame a bank for being robbed, because they foreclosed on the robbers house. And a place of business cannot be blamed for a disgruntled employee perpetrating a shooting. It is the fault, alone, of the person taking the action. In this case, the redditors who unintentionally overloaded Voat servers."
KarmaCourt,3c4hwe,KnaveofHeart,4,Sun Jul 5 04:58:30 2015 UTC,Thank you for the eloquent rebuttal. I believe that I nearly have enough information to come to a ruling. I propose an hour long recess after which both the defense and prosecution will submit their closing statements and the jury will vote. A bit unorthodox perhaps but might I remind you who the judge is here. Court recessed.
KarmaCourt,3c4hwe,steampoweredkitten,6,Sun Jul 5 05:06:15 2015 UTC,"The court recess has drawn to a close and both parties return refreshed and renewed. I will now hear the closing statements from u/Professor_Doodles and u/KnaveofHeart respectively. After this occurs, the jury will have a total of 12 hours to cast their vote in this trial thread, by commenting either ""Prosecution"" if in favor of the prosecution's argument or ""Defense"" if in favor of the defense's argument. I will tally these votes and come to a ruling. u/Professor_Doodles please proceed with your closing argument."
KarmaCourt,3c4hwe,steampoweredkitten,5,Sun Jul 5 06:50:40 2015 UTC,"Ladies and gentlemen of the court, contrary to the defence's claims, this mass exodus of former-Redditors can be blamed completely upon the administrators of Reddit. Even before the exodus, voat.com was a known but little-utilized possible alternative to Reddit. However, when the mods alienated masses of Resdit users, they flocked to the closest known alternative: voat.com.   Let me ask you, as an allegory, if you were the owner of a company specializing in construction scaffolding, and one day you knocked over half of your scaffolding and killed several workers, would the ground be to blame for their deaths? Would it be gravity? No, it would be the one which started into motion the acts which lead to their deaths. Alternatively, if a nation were to go to war and send hundreds of refugees to a neighboring nation, where they then caused a famine, would this famine be the refugees fault? No, it would be the fault of the warring nation.  And that is the same as what has happened here. Our ""warring nation"" so to say, would be the admins of Reddit. They have pushed out their refugees and caused famine and shortage across the rest of the internet.   I trust that the judge/jury in this case will see the fact-supported truth in this matter. The prosecution rests, your honor."
KarmaCourt,3c4hwe,Professor_Doodles,5,Sun Jul 5 22:35:50 2015 UTC,"A gallantly-worded and fiery closing statement. We now await u/KnaveofHeart for the defense's closing statement. Due to unfortunate scheduling conflicts, I must make my ruling within the next hour and half. If the defense has not responded by 8:30 ET I will be forced to rule without their closing statement."
KarmaCourt,3c4hwe,steampoweredkitten,6,Sun Jul 5 23:11:28 2015 UTC,"First, I'd like to thank the prosecution. I believe they've done a wonderful job illustrating the defenses point.  Ladies, and fine gentlemen of the jury, is what the prosecution saying not at least a little true? Surely we cannot blame the refuges for leaving their countries. Nor can we blame ""Gravity"" a universal force of nature, for the deaths of the imagined workers. However, can we hang the foreman for an accident? Can we blame the country the refugee's come from, for losing a conflict? No. Nor can we blame the invading nation for generating such refugees. For their actions were forwarded by a conflict of nations. My point was never if what the admins did was right, that's a different case altogether. The point of this case, is if the Administration of Reddit can be blamed for it's users crashing Voat servers. Just one country, can't blame another, because they chose to accept refugees. And just like the foreman can't be hung for a mistake.  Voat encouraged Redditors to come to its sites. Redditors encouraged Redditors to go to voat. It was a plan by redditors to go to voat. So the Admins can't be blamed for voat not having the server capacity."

Lack of communication and openness regarding what the mods had to say about the moderation tools and  - 4. Deploying a broken and unusable new search interface in complete disregard to months of negative feedback at r/beta  constitute a continuous series of acts as both acts have not been concluded yet, neither the lack of communication nor the search interface have been repaired, and continue as of today, at least went on until the beginning of the blackout yesterday.  Therefore both acts may still be prosecuted."
KarmaCourt,3bycnj,gyro-robo,7,Fri Jul 3 17:20:12 2015 UTC,"/u/DJ_Deathflea Your motion is dismissed regarding Charge 2.  The problem of Charge number 2 is the wording, which I thank you very much for pointing it out. It should have been ""Lack of communication and openness with the moderators of Reddit."" The mistake is mine since I wrote this charge myself (again, not because I was a plaintiff). I take it on me and I am ready to change it if the prosecution wants to change the wording of Charge 2.  There is evidence that Charge 2 is of present time and valid under 21 days. Evidence here, there as well, and so on.   As for Charge 4, I demand the prosecution to find evidence proving that this crime is actual (meaning, it happened less than 21 days before). If they fail to do so then the defence's motion regarding Charge 4 will be sustained.  The Karma Court Constitutions says:   Statute of Limitations: a redditor may not be accused of a crime if it has been 21 days or more since the offense was committed, however it can be used as evidence for future trials. (ARTICLE VI.4)   However this does not mean a Redditor cannot be accused of a recurring crime under 21 days. In more simple terms, even though you have evidences showing this happened for a very long time, any new repetition of this wrong doing can be filed to court under 21 days. Only the actual crime will be treated, and the previous actions (even though they are of the same kind) can be used as evidence, as stated by the Article VI.4.  Aside from this, I would suggest the prosecution to change the wording of the charge as well though. To make it clear on what we're talking about.  TL;DR: No for Charge 2, maybe for Charge 4."
KarmaCourt,3bycnj,Logan_Mac,8,Sat Jul 4 01:17:23 2015 UTC,"The defense takes a swig of whisky from a tear-stained hip flask  You Honor, /u/kikool42  Due to the nature of Ellen Pao's primary role as Reddit's CEO, we believe her inclusion in the charges levied as per charge #4 #2 Charge FIVE fuck it I'm drunk  precludes a fair and swift trial for the rest of our defendants: the Reddit Admins. Ellen's actions as CEO are not under the control of the other Admins. To force the other admins to answer for her Douchbaggery charge would be unfair.   We move therefore, that Ellen Pao be removed as a defendant and brought up on separate charges in her own trial.   We believe this motion should be supported by the prosecution as well  as it represents the best possible chance to seek justice for the actions of the Reddit CEO.   As I am sure prosecution is aware, failure to succeed in making Ellen's charges stick here, were we to go to trial with her included as a defendant, would preclude charging her again for the same crimes. Further, the charge of Douchbaggery is so broad that it likely includes many if not all other charges that Ellen could have faced during her own trial and thus almost certainly removes the possibility of bringing her up on charges in the future if she stands accused today.   In short, if Ellen is included in the current proceedings, the ability of both the prosecution and the defense is hampered severely.   And of course the court is, I am sure, aware of the ahem benefits of a second high-profile case in it's docket in just a few weeks time.   hic"
KarmaCourt,3bycnj,Kell08,4,Fri Jul 3 18:57:51 2015 UTC,"Well since it seems that the prosecution doesn't mind your motion I will in fact proceed to my answer.  MOTION SUSTAINED !  From the evidence we have (https://i.imgur.com/XoL3pdJ.jpg) it seems that Ellen Pao did not in fact fire Victoria and it was /u/kn0thing. Therefore the CEO of Reddit, Ellen Pao, will be removed from the defendants (against the will of many here). This doesn't mean she couldn't be brought to another trial (and if she is convicted I'd love to judge that one too; but let's do one thing at a time).  I will however ask the prosecution /u/anotherphilosopher /u/IceBlade03 and /u/GhostOfWhatsIAName to define EXACTLY WHO is accused. We have /u/kn0thing as well, but I want you to make a list of the admins that you wish to prosecute.  This motion is retroactive.

There is no point in which one can see that the many comments posted by my client were sockpuppetry attempted. There are many other potential explanations for the commenting. As the prosecution notes, my client had only been on Reddit for a day when he posted his comments, yet the prosecution jumps to its being sockpuppeting. Could it not merely be a beginner's lack of understanding with respect to the conventions of Reddit? One notes that even in this very thread, my client has made multiple top-level comments, in a circumstance where attempting to sockpuppet would make no sense. Is it not therefore reasonably possible that my client was not attempting sockpuppetry in the circumstances which we have presented before us?"
KarmaCourt,3bv4tz,Leader0fTheFreeWorld,5,Sat Jul 4 01:52:27 2015 UTC,"But why? Why would /u/Yama-xs-850-special keep agreeing with his/her own post over and over again. That would make no sense! No beginner in their right mind would do that! Even if they had just joined reddit! It is obviously failed sock-puppetry.  Also, you have noted that the defendant has made multiple top level comments in this thread, but you should know that in every one, the defendant acted unreasonably rude. You are merely grasping at straws. We already have evidence to send /u/Yama-xs-850-special away!"
KarmaCourt,3bv4tz,KingofKingBananas,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:34:04 2015 UTC,"You have conjecture and circumstantial evidence but nothing close to a definitive case against my client. There is no especial requirement that people act sensically: people do things that seem like nonsense all the time. Moreover, the charge is attempted sockpuppetry, not unreasonable rudeness. It therefore follows that your comments on my client's attitude are irrelevant character assassination. It is you who are grasping at straws, not I."
KarmaCourt,3bv4tz,Leader0fTheFreeWorld,3,Sat Jul 4 03:12:48 2015 UTC,"Okay. Let's play. Give me a reason why the defendant would continue to comment on her own post, essentially agreeing over and over."
KarmaCourt,3bv4tz,KingofKingBananas,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:47:09 2015 UTC,"I don't have to give a reason, I have to show why there is a reasonable doubt as to whether my client is guilty of the levied charges."
KarmaCourt,3bv4tz,Leader0fTheFreeWorld,3,Sat Jul 4 04:05:43 2015 UTC,"If she has a reason for commenting over and over and over again, then the defendant has some hope. If there was no reason for her to comment, then that is proof that she was puppeteering. Again you are grasping. My evidence clearly shows that the defendant is guilty. The day old profile. The constant commenting on her own post agreeing with herself constantly. It's a throwaway. She probably has other throwaways at her disposal but merely forgot to change accounts while commenting. If she ""was"" innocent, then why would she keep commenting on her own post?"
KarmaCourt,3bv4tz,KingofKingBananas,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:49:17 2015 UTC,"First of all, why do you assume my client is female? His sex has never been stated, and for you to assume him to be female is unorthodox to say the least.   I reject your assertion that a lack of apparent reason for commenting proves my client to have attempted sockpuppetry, much less beyond a reasonable doubt. You have certainly failed to provide evidence or arguments sufficient for a conviction."
KarmaCourt,3bv4tz,Leader0fTheFreeWorld,5,Sat Jul 4 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"The defendant posted on /r/TwoXChromosomes , which is a subreddit for women to post what's in their mind. Such as sports, fashion, and other topics where meaningful discussion is possible. That is where my assumption came from. Also, how has my arguments not do anything but prove that the defendant is guilty? This is beyond reasonable doubt; this is hard evidence. Show me my flaws in my reasoning in an organized manner."

KarmaCourt,3bv4tz,Kikool42,6,Sat Jul 11 02:05:11 2015 UTC,"BANG BANG BANG  SILENCE IN THE COURT ROOM.  As Judge, my first ruling will be regarding the few issues /r/KarmaCourt has been facing these days. Here it goes:  IF YOU'RE COUNSEL (DEFENCE OR PROSECUTION) RESPECT THE DEADLINE.  In order to make the trial going, I will ask both counsellors to be involved which means that they should be ready to make their opening statements in less than 48 hours after the Trial Opening. If one of them fails to do so, the case will be dismissed on the grounds of non-respect of the deadline and this might go against their record.  Now there's something more, it's different and it's been never seen here before: If the case is dismissed, the case will however be allowed for a re-opening if a replacement of the missing counsellor is found within a week. This doesn't mean the other counsellor who was present stays on the ring. It means if someone wants to replace whoever was missing, this person will have to ask the other counsellor if he/she wants to keep representing his/her client and if that person doesn't want to keep the position than the replacement will have to find another replacement as well.  Understood? I hope so cause I don't.  TL;DR: Be present or stay out. If the case is dismissed because of deadline, it can be reopened if replacement is found."

Though it may have been night for some members, or all members, of this esteemed Karma court.   First let me say simply that my own character is to be considered in this matter. Some may call into question certain of my previous posts onto reddit and I offer no apologies. I am a satircal asshole, a ruseful wordsmith, a prankster, a troll. I do not deny these charges nay, I embrace these charges.   That said I did honestly and with great interest view op's Original Content on the day in question, it being yesterday, or possibly yesternight for some, or all of the court.   What I saw was a tasteful, comedic, poignant and seemingly honest jab, jibe and jib at dirty fucking liars. I commiserated with the op, though I am myself a dirty fucking liar of immense proportions. So interested was I in the intellectual checkmate in which the op continually placed other ops of all sizes and types. I wanted to see those damning citations for myself!  After doing a brief perusal of the op's last page of posts, and not really reading anything for actual content I didn't see any hyperlinks provided in any of the posts. I then, being a lazy shit-throwing monkeyboy in a cage, decided that it would indeed be karmic justice if I was to call the op a dirty fucking liar by assuming that there were no citations to be found in the vast majority of his recent posts.   And so I took the chance that all of reddit, or most of reddit, or at least the people who had noticed op's wonderful Original Content, were also lazy little monkey trolls just like myself, who would not check for themselves, the dubious fact that I put forth.   I regret nothing. I will now accept questions from interested parties.

Of course, we could just leave them on their own and have them deal with it themselves, but once again, this is just an idea I wanted to put forward to see how people would respond. It could be that everyone agrees with you and nobody will use anything other than reddit for their internet courtroom shenanigans, but it could also be that there are people who want this.

I also think turning this into a free-speech issue is ridiculous. Reddit is not a platform for free speech, it's a website run by a company designed to stifle undesirable content. The site has votes which show or hide content depending on how well it's received. It has mods with the ability to remove content. It has admins with the ability to remove content, too, as we have learned.  Reddit was designed with censorship in mind, and whining about the decision or the people behind it is completely idiotic. I understand that regardless of what reddit is, some do want a platform for free speech. I totally agree, and that's a good reason to start using another site!

KarmaCourt,39dwu7,kwithnok,9,Sun Jun 14 02:14:04 2015 UTC,"Ahem hem hearing no objection, I will address my pretrial motions to the Court. Now I'm just a simple country lawyer, never even passed the KCBar and never sauntered through these here doors before. But justice must needs a defender!  My pretrial motions are as follows:   To dismiss, for lack of standing: Article II of the Constitution speaks of protecting the rights of redditors. But what, I say, is a redditor? Someone with an account and a reputation to protect, presumably. However, the putative plaintiffs here, the People, as in the People of /r/fatpeoplehate, do not exist. They were cast to the four winds, and their mods shadowbanned. As far as I am aware, no KarmaCourt precedent clearly holds that the Constitution's protections run to people, rather than accounts. That issue was starkly presented in People v. Unidan, but as you all know, the case was mooted by Unidan's confession, meaning no precedential holding was issued. Because the ""People"" qua /r/fatpeoplehate are not redditors, they cannot be heard in this Court. The case must be dismissed.  To dismiss, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction: At common law, the King could not be sued in his own courts. Sure, admins have been sued individually, but not in their official capacities. Unless the admins have waived their right to immunity, this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear a complaint against them!!! For voir dire: Ohhh how delightful, the prosecutor wants a jury trial! Of course he does! Your average redditor hates the admins! But we are a sub of laws, not of men! If we are to have jurors, let's inspect them to weed out shills for the plaintiff. At least let me wash them through IsReactionaryBot. Note, too, that one of your jurors is shadowbanned.   Well -- twangs suspenders -- I'll leave it at that for now. Y'all let me know the, ah, judgment of the court."
KarmaCourt,39dwu7,Professor_Doodles,2,Wed Jun 17 21:17:22 2015 UTC,"If no-one else will defend the admins, then I will! Lead counsel doesn't even believe in the client, and he/she/they/it deserve/s an attorney who does!"

Named admin shall be heard as a witness for the counterclaimants and the defence as well. Thank you, I will now get back in line.   ""I wanted to share with you some clarity I’ve gotten from our community team around this decision that was made.  ""Over the past 6 months or so, the level of contact emails and messages they’ve been answering with had begun to increase both in volume and urgency. They were often from scared and confused people who didn’t know why they were being targeted, and were in fear for their or their loved ones safety.It was an identifiable trend, and it was always leading back to the fat-shaming subreddits. Upon investigation, it was found that not only was the community engaging in harassing behavior but the mods were not only participating in it, but even at times encouraging it.The ban of these communities was in no way intended to censor communication. It was simply to put an end to behavior that was being fostered within the communities that were banned. We are a platform for human interaction, but we do not want to be a platform that allows real-life harassment of people to happen. We decided we simply could no longer turn a blind eye to the human beings whose lives were being affected by our users’ behavior.""

KarmaCourt,39dwu7,WarlordOfMaltise,4,Fri Jun 12 20:34:22 2015 UTC,"/u/Professor_Doodles, your Honour.  The charges filed upon coming into session are:   5 Counts of Censorship. 43 Counts of OhShit.exe stemming from the Censorship. 1 Count of Douchebaggery. 2 separate counts of Obstruction of Justice.   These charges stem from plain facts of what has occurred and evidence shall be presented in due course to support these claims.  The countersuits charges as above are:   1 count of 'Destroying Reddit' 1 count of 'DANGEROUS DISRUPTION OF POST TRAFFIC' 1 count of ' PANDORASBOX.LNK'   I move to have this counterclaim thrown out for the following reasons:   This is not a case of FPH VS 'sane other people' of Reddit as claimed in the countersuit but instead a fight for justice to be brought upon gross censorship by the Reddit admins and CEO within the context of the applicable charges. 'Destroying Reddit'. Your Honour, Reddit is still around and not destroyed, I move for this charge to be thrown out for hyperbole. 'PANDORASBOX.LNK'. Nobody even knows what charge this actually is. I /u/Juke_Box do not identify with the countersuit even while being a 'sane person of Reddit'. If this was to go ahead, I appeal that 'those identifying with it' be replaced by 'reasonable anti-censorship Redditors'.

That is misrepresenting the majority of reddit users as opposing the ban because of the reasons presented by the plaintiff. The other people of reddit who merely are interested in its orderly use without (alleged) harassment demand to be admitted to this trial as third party counter claimants. Also, the defence are solely representing the defendants as opposing party in this trial. And thirdly, I'll gladly join the defence team if admitted by /u/SarahPalinisaMuslim.  I am identifying as a reasonable anti-censorship Redditor as well. But, in contrast to the people represented by the plaintiff, from me Reddit get the benefit of the doubt that they actually did find evidence of harassment and toleration of it by fph mods before deciding for a ban.

Moderators are free to ban any user they want in the subreddits they mod.    Is a line taken from the Moderating Wiki. Therefor the mods were completely within their rights to ban the plaintiff.  Any subsequent action taken by the moderation team that one would considered ""General Douchebaggery"" was a response the plaintiff violating Reddit's rules on harassment (See below).   Exhibit A:   I'm sorry but you're not really doing your job as a moderator.    Exhibit B:   Fine. Fuck your maturity.   Exhibit C   Now please, go fuck yourselves, you fat, lonely, ignorant, worthless, attention-seeking whores   Exhibit D   You guys are fucking retarded.   This evidence clearly shows that the plaintiff was harassing the moderators and therefor the charge of ""General Douchebaggery"" holds no ground as the plaintiff committed said charge himself prior to the mods committing any offenses. Therefor the case should be dismissed.  Should that not be enough, the complaint was filled with the name of the plaintiff.  The complaint was filed on behalf, unbeknownst to the plaintiff.  The plaintiff is mentioned once in the complaint in an explanation and therefor the case may not proceed."
KarmaCourt,39encr,marsfish3,8,Fri Jun 12 03:28:22 2015 UTC,"But the case is for the douchbaggery of them trolling the guy. I understand they're within their rights to ban him, but I think trolling him and refusing to even listen to his explanation of why he shouldn't have been banned DOES constitute douchbaggery. They're mods after all, they represent their sub. That's why I filed the case. I've not been around the court for so long though. Does the judge want to weigh in on this?  EDIT: I'm not the victim. I filed on the victims behalf after seeing the gallery in the comments of a post on KiA."
KarmaCourt,39encr,marsfish3,2,Fri Jun 12 03:32:41 2015 UTC,"The judge has the call but, as I said in my motion.  Any responses my  clients gave were likely as a response to the plaintiff defaming and insulting their hard work (see above.)"

If you want to file your own case against the victim here, do it, but the concern here is the douchbaggery of the defendants in this case."
KarmaCourt,39encr,marsfish3,2,Fri Jun 12 03:46:38 2015 UTC,"However, the circumstances of which the ""General Douchebaggery"" occurred is important. When someone insults another person, they generally don't take too kindly to it and therefor respond in anger.  It is then considered a crime of passion and should be taken lightly.  As well, a complaint can not be filed with someone as a plaintiff, when said person is unaware and not mentioned. Therefor there are 2 reasons to dismiss the case."
KarmaCourt,39encr,Errorfullgnome,2,Fri Jun 12 03:51:01 2015 UTC,"A crime of passion perhaps; but a crime nonetheless. Furthermore, the insults the victim made were directed towards one moderator. The victim was then trolled and harassed by numerous other moderators."

KarmaCourt,39encr,Errorfullgnome,2,Fri Jun 12 04:18:03 2015 UTC,"Then why did you ask me? The answer would be irrelevant to the trial. Indeed, every point brought up in this discussion would be irrelevant, including ones made by you, seeing as they would be neither a part of the original motion nor a response to speeches opposing the motion, as the speeches would be illegitimate."

It is a popular Icelandic liquor and special-occasion alcohol shot, and the traditional drink for the mid-winter feast of Þorrablót. It is made from fermented grain or potato mash and flavoured with caraway.  The steeping of herbs in alcohol to create schnapps is a long-held folk tradition in Scandinavian countries. Brennivín has a unique and distinctive taste similar to vodka or Scandinavian akvavit. It is typically bottled at 80 proof.

They were originally conceived to replace the light, medium, heavy and super-heavy tanks. Development was spurred in the Cold War with the development of lightweight composite armor. They are still supplemented in some armies with light tanks.  Today, main battle tanks are considered a key component of modern armies.  Modern MBTs seldom operate alone, as they are organized into armored units which involve the support of infantry, who may accompany the MBTs in infantry fighting vehicles. They are also often supported by surveillance or ground-attack aircraft.

There is no reason that these charges should be pressed against this defendant. I will lay out what happened:  Our defendant, /u/thelostcrusader, posted a picture over 3 months old from the Instagram belonging to /u/nikonandy (which is plenty of time had the OP decided that he wanted to have made that post himself.) and reaped the sweet karma of good content.   Now, he is being blamed for stealing someone else's work and taking from them karma that they could have then reaped.   However, this is not the case. You see, LostCrusader posted a semi-famous image 3 months after the initial post, which was plenty of time for NikonAndy to have posted it himself. Therefore fair time was allowed in that regard. It is for this reason that the charges are simply unjust.   We may also notice the way in which Nikon Andy took the post. Was he hurt, or disappointed? No, he was just the opposite. He actually thanked Crusader for posting his work. He didn't seem to have much regard for the potential lost karma, and just seemed glad that his work was receiving even more (much-deserved!) attention in the public eye. It would seem that this whole was all in good terms and with no ill-feelings.  Now, ladies and gentlemen of the court, I believe that you will see that the charge brought against the defendant simply has no feet upon which to stand, so to say.  Thank you."

KarmaCourt,389hz2,Katsuhiko,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:07:06 2015 UTC,"Let's examine this so-called ""thanks"" that /u/nikonandy gave. First of all, he said ""Thanks so much!!"" with two exclamation points. What do exclamation points show? Yelling. People do not yell when they are honestly thanking somebody--and they especially do not double-yell, which two entire exclamation points indicates.  But we shan't end there, now shall we? /u/nikonandy goes on to say, and I quote, ""If anyone wants to see more images, check out my instagram."" This is implying that his instagram is the only way people should be seeing his pictures. He did not say, ""If anyone wants to see more images, please keep viewing my pictures posted on /r/earthporn."" Of course, if he said that, the case would be closed.  And finally, someone responded to /u/thelostcrusader calling the picture ""breathtaking"" by saying it was ""breath-stealing."" /u/nikonandy's response?  ""hahaha :)""  And I quote.  Look at that smiley face. Smiling means happy. Happy means agreement. Agreement means that he agrees that /u/thelostcrusader stole the picture. Coincidence? Maybe... but no.  And let us also examine this time argument. Three months, you say? Let us examine the laws with a mere quote so as to not summon the wikibot:  ""In general, works published after 1977 will not fall into the public domain until 70 years after the death of author, or, for corporate works, anonymous works, or works for hire, 95 years from the date of publication or 120 years from the date of creation, whichever expires first.""  As far as I am concerned, three months is less than all of those numbers--but I am not a math teacher. In fact, I am still taking third grade math classes in college. But this is all besides the point. And 'point' is a math term. Right? Please help me, I can't get out of third grade math and I'm a lawyer.  /u/Katsuhiko curls up into a ball and begins to cry softly."

Why bother with a trial? We've got an angry mob with pitchforks waiting here, and I think that it is time they got to indulge in some good old-fashioned vigilante justice. Trials are a waste of time when the defendant is clearly guilty: a legal precedent going back to the days of His Honour Judge Dredd, who I understand also served on the jury and as the executioner for maximum efficiency.

KarmaCourt,37vj8w,ineededtosaythishere,1 point,Sun May 31 21:35:39 2015 UTC,"Ladies and gentlemen of the court, the case is extremely simple. /u/americanpsycho15 stands accused of libido-shaming, along with additional charges of insulting his significant other without giving him a change to defend himself, trolling, and emotional and sexual abuse. I direct the court to Exhibit A. The text includes lines such as ""I feel like he's making excuses for me"" (this is a direct quote) and ""he barely ever puts out"" (this is also a direct quote). I ask the court why /u/americanpsycho15 could not have been more supportive of his significant other's desires, considering how it is clearly stated in Exhibit E that /u/BFofAmericanPsycho15 has severe eczema which often makes sex painful for him? In fact, let the record show that they were having sex one to two times a week. This is generally standard for most couples. Thus, I accuse /u/americanpsycho15 of libido-shaming without due cause, and for self-centeredness in attempting to force his overactive sex drive onto a person whom it was physically hurting. Forcing the significant other into sex against their wishes can also be described as emotional and sexual abuse, if not physical abuse as well. As for trolling, I submit /u/americanpsycho15's flippancy as demonstrated in Exhibits B and D. I would like to convince the judge and the jury that there is really no excuse for this behavior, and the fact that he complained about his significant other on an anonymous online forum adds insult to injury. I feel it is for these reasons that he should be convicted.  Thank you."
KarmaCourt,37vj8w,megatetsujin28,3,Sun May 31 21:51:58 2015 UTC,delicious argument.  i'm looking forward to the farts it will create.
KarmaCourt,37vj8w,Metalworks13,2,Sun May 31 22:52:12 2015 UTC,"Ladies and gentlemen of the court, As this case may be simple and very straightforward, I announce that /u/americanpsyco15 is innocent of all charges except trolling. I think this because of the evidence provided to us, beginning with Exhibits A and C. In exhibit A we see a distressed gay man desperate for ""proper"" sex and in Exhibit C we almost see the exact same thing occur. So where am i going with this? Well, your honour, I believe that this so called ""gay man"" is in fact not gay at all, he simply just wants attention. We also see this in Exhibit G where a ""different"" user claims that he is the boyfriend of /u/americanpsyco15. However, i believe that this ""Boyfriend"" of his is actually american psyco himself. I believe this because of the significant lack of activity on his profile and the aptly titled ""/u/BFofAmericanPsycho15"". I most utterly believe that /u/americanpsyco15 is a simple troll and shall not be convicted for any other crimes.  Thank you, Your Honour"
KarmaCourt,37vj8w,Averybunny1,1 point,Mon Jun 1 09:20:54 2015 UTC,"Your honor, if I may, why should the fact that /u/BFofamericanpaycho15 has little posting history and that particular name mean that /u/americanpsycho15 is attempting to stir up drama? I feel The defense is ignoring the most obvious reason why this would be: the significant other discovered /u/americanpsycho15's Reddit account and created their own account to provide their side of the story."

KarmaCourt,37kgb7,Meowing_Cows,4,Thu May 28 19:03:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you, defense. Waiting on prosecution to pop up."

KarmaCourt,37kgb7,naked_avenger,3,Thu May 28 21:12:35 2015 UTC,"DOUBLE BANG  Benches, your numbers have been recorded for data gathering purposes. Thank you for your participation in this experiment.    TRIAL THREAD  Prosecution, you may begin with opening statements. Oh, and grab me a beer. Angry Orchard, please.  /u/SuperLogicMan   /u/BlackLight249   /u/tetsuo52"
KarmaCourt,37kgb7,tetsuo52,2,Thu May 28 22:40:15 2015 UTC,"Ahem Thank you your honor. Id like to first apologize, they only had Woodchuck at the store. pop fizzzzzz Good afternoon your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury and witnesses, my name is irrelevant. We are here this afternoon to prove that /u/dangjasondang is a total douchebag... No, no Im sorry Ive just been told that's NOT why we are here today. Apparently /u/dangjasondang has committed a much more grievous injustice against you, me and every Redditor across the world. Ladies and gentlemen today we the prosecution will prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that /u/dangjasondang not only sought to lie, cheat us out of gold and karma but he also conspired with another Redditor, /u/nancynancyxd, to do so. And in this crime not only did they attempt to fool Reddit but they also attempted to fool Facebook, Buzzfeed, Fox News and Distractify. Eh who am I kidding? None of us give a fuck about any of them. Were gounna burn this bitch fer fuckin wit REDDIT"
KarmaCourt,37kgb7,BlackLight249,4,Fri May 29 02:49:32 2015 UTC,"Your honor, there is no concrete evidence that proves the defendant guilty beyond reasonable doubt.  Exhibit D has /u/nancynancyxd claiming to be in Denver from May 27th to June 1st. As we know, May 27th was the day the stranger was supposed to give the money to /u/dangjasondang. /u/nancynancyxd and /u/dangjasondang are supposedly real life friends. It is possible that the former cancelled the trip to witness the events, for if the stranger had in fact delivered, said events would be part of internet history. Moving a trip by one day is worth witnessing internet history, is it not? Many other factors could have delayed her May 27th trip to Denver, including a tornado spotted nearby.   The stranger's failure to deliver the money is no proof that my client's post was a conspiracy.  EDIT: I would like to add that /u/nancynancyxd was not the ""stranger."""
KarmaCourt,37kgb7,Nancynancyxd,2,Thu May 28 22:39:13 2015 UTC,"Gasp!  The classic ""There was a tornado"" defense! Money well paid on this public offender."
KarmaCourt,37kgb7,BlackLight249,2,Fri May 29 00:15:35 2015 UTC,"CONGRATULATIONS!!! To every one in the audience this evening you are in for a special treat. You have all waited... And as promised I shall deliver. You thought this was over, I know, but its only just begun. Lets first start off by going over this day that the defendants had planned out so masterfully. Its no wonder there is seemingly no evidence. As I will show you /u/dangjasondang has a looooooong history of Karmawhoring that culminated to this ultimate frontpage conspiracy. And as you will see clearly through his own posts that while claiming that he doesnt care about the Karma he blatantly over and over after being banned from one subreddit to the next keeps on continuing to post in a desperate attempt to Karmawhore.  Now before I begin Id like to point out that Im currently in a floodzone (yea... THATS how much I believe in this case) and have to make this case on a cell phone. Please excuse my poor reddiquette if I post a link instead of hyperlinking text. NOW, as you can see in this first AMA /u/dangjasondang gets deleted and blocked.  https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/37hisb/i_am_jason_dang_op_of_the_note_in_the_whilst_of/ As he obviously hasnt had enough Karmawhoring he starts another one here http://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/37how9/the_note_ama_continues/ You may notice the top comment is a conjecture that he might get robbed. OP finds this funny, likely cuz he knows this fictional person doesnt exist and couldnt ever do anything to him. As if 2 AMAs wasnt enough he sets up a live feed... http://www.reddit.com/live/uz68rve67u3q/ In the midst of all this he also gets banned from r/pics. While I am unsure of the reason for this I am almost certain that the mods could see through this line of BS and got tired of him Karmawhoring in their very nice sub-reddit-urb.  http://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/37how9/the_note_ama_continues/croirmw oh yea and he also says ""worth all the wild"" which has been buggin the shit outta me since the begining of this trial and honestly I wanna burn him at the stake for that alone got dammit. Id also like to point out your Holy Honorness Meow Meows (/u/meowing_cows) in this above post he mocks the validity and sanctity of this very court! (this is your cue /u/naked_avenger) You may be asking, but /u/tetsuo52, what about the conspiracy charges! You have CLEARLY displayed that /u/dangjasondang is a Karmawhore. Fuck, he obviously cant keep is P in his pants where it belongs! But what makes you think that /u/nancynancyxd was involved in a conspiracy and that this was all a hoax??? Well I will display for you this bit of evidence. As you can see /u/nancynancyxd posts that she is ""here with the note guy"" http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/37hvse/here_with_note_guy_hes_going_strong/ Now in the comment threads someone notices that she and OP are friends http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/37hvse/here_with_note_guy_hes_going_strong/crmwlb6 THEN all of a sudden as if everything is about to be ruined she somes clean about knowing him despite her post claiming shes with the ""note guy"" not her well known friend as she would have said if this wasnt planned out a year ahead of time. (Oh and if you notice she admits to the crime of Karmawhoring in this post) http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/37hvse/here_with_note_guy_hes_going_strong/crmy67d?context=3 And then theres here where OP calls it early on saying that he doesnt think the note writer will show http://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/37how9/the_note_ama_continues/crmrzy7 How would he know??? Your honor, ladies and gentlemen in the gallery. Just take a look at the evidence and it is clear... You wouldnt be able to find a bigger Karmawhore duo standing in a window in Amsterdam. And if youve ever BEEN to Amsterdam you will know that there is almost ALWAYS a conspiracy among whores to get more. And More.. And MORE. For a whore its never enough. Your honor, I ask that you convict the accused on all charges so that an example can be made and this disgusting display will be discouraged instead of rewarded. Thank you..."
KarmaCourt,37kgb7,Dangjasondang,2,Fri May 29 23:35:13 2015 UTC,"first AMA /u/dangjasondang gets deleted and blocked.   The prosecution neglected to mention the fact that the AmA in question was on the IAmA subreddit, i.e., the same subreddit that removed Bad Luck Brian's post. Yes, he was mistaken in going to /r/IAmA, an honest mistake. His post in that subreddit was not one of malice, it was simply to bring joy to the people, allowing them to ask questions which he would answer sine mora.    As he obviously hasnt had enough Karmawhoring he starts another one here   His post in /r/IAmA having been deleted, /u/dangjasondang decided to finish what he started, lest he disappoint the masses.   I ask you this, ladies and gentlemen and Jenner(wo)men of the court, is Peter Dinklage a karmawhore for posting on /r/IAmA? Is Barack Obama? Answer me this, people of reddit: Is Neil DeGrasse Tyson a buxom karmawench? Any person with a shred of honor would answer ""no.""   You may notice the top comment is a conjecture that he might get robbed. OP finds this funny, likely cuz he knows this fictional person doesnt exist and couldnt ever do anything to him.   His comment    genius.   showed admiration for anyone smart enough to devise such a plan. However, to quote Mercer Frey, ""Do not mistake [his] admiration for complacency.""    As if 2  1 AMA wasn't enough, he sets up a live feed...   FTFY.  Well, why would he not? Not only do live feeds not generate karma, they are meant to keep people up to date with current events.    In the midst of all this he also gets banned from r/pics.    His post was against Rule III of /r/pics, which constitutes an immediate ban. It had nothing to do with karmawhoring of any sort.   oh yea and he also says ""worth all the wild"" which has been buggin the shit outta me since the begining of this trial and honestly I wanna burn him at the stake for that alone got dammit.   My client is not being tried for bad grammar, nor should he be.    in this above post he mocks the validity and sanctity of this very court!   This is not a charge against him, save it for another trial.   THEN all of a sudden as if everything is about to be ruined she somes clean about knowing him despite her post claiming shes with the ""note guy"" not her well known friend as she would have said if this wasnt planned out a year ahead of time.   Everyone knows him as ""the Note Guy,"" and most people at that time did not know what he looked like. Referring to /u/dangjasondang as ""the Note Guy"" makes her picture make a lot more sense.   (Oh and if you notice she admits to the crime of Karmawhoring in this post)   True, but /u/nancynancyxd is not the defendant. This trial is charging /u/dangjasondang, not his friend. /u/nancynancyxd's instance of karmawhoring does not apply to the charges against my client.   And then theres here where OP calls it early on saying that he doesnt think the note writer will show   Yes, he calls it. That proves nothing at all. Would you trust someone who left a note in a book promising $200 to follow through? Most people would not, and my client is no exception.  Your Honor /u/Meowing_Cows, I conclude that there is no substantial evidence that proves /u/dangjasondang guilty of any of the charges pressed against him."

KarmaCourt,36lqq2,Miordanou,3,Sat May 23 00:23:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you, Your Honour.  Ladies and gentlemen of this esteemed court, the case before us is a simple. /u/deadjordan framed his own brother, in a Cain and Abel-like act of fratricide, for his own sickening and twisted perversion. I will prove to you that /u/DeadJordan is, in addition to being a kinky bastard, the worse kind of brother-framer it is possible to be.  First, we shall look at Exhibit A. In this, we can see that the person referred to is engaging in some sort of weird, text-based sex scene with an ""Axl Fur"". There are diapers involved, and one line of dialogue goes ""Ohh Mommmy! Harder!"". Nothing in this scene makes sense, Your Honour. The whole thing is baffling to read, and I do not understand it personally. While I strongly believe that people can engage in any fetish they wish as long as anyone else involved can consent and no-one else is harmed, it is clear that it would be embarrassing for most people if others knew they were into this sort of thing.  Now, the defendant claims that this is what he discovered on his brother's laptop. I now draw your attention to Exhibit B. In this, we see the defendant ask ""diaper butts"" if there are any ""ABDLs/babyfurs"" in Peterborough. A babyfur, according to a quick Google search, is a member of the furry fandom who enjoys roleplaying younger characters. ABDL stands for ""Adult Baby Diaper Lovers"". These are all things contained within Exhibit A.  Finally, I will look at Exhibit C. The whole Tulpas things is irrelevant. What is relevant, Your Honour, is the part which shows the defendant posting to /r/mylittlepony, in which the defendant wishes to discuss ""Bronies and other characters"" in the context of ComicCon. Your Honour, being on the Internet has taught me that bronies and furries have significant overlap, as bronies enjoy anthropomorphic creatures too (in their cases, specifically ponies featured on the cartoon My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic).   Your Honour, what this evidence shows is that the defendant enjoys furries and adult babies in diapers. All of these are contained within the screenshot allegedly from his brother's laptop.  I put it to the court that the defendant attempted to frame his brother for this. The kinks are the same, and is it likely that he was able to get a screenshot, save the image, open the web browser, get on to Imgur and upload the image on his brother's laptop before his brother returned? Or is it more likely that he decided to claim it was his brother for karma, and got burned when someone actually decided to check? I think it is the second, and during this case I hope to convince the judge, jury and this whole court that this is indeed what happened.  Thank you."
KarmaCourt,36lqq2,Miordanou,2,Sat May 23 00:54:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you, Mr. /u/LJ97. /u/megatetsujin28, what do you have to say on behalf of the defendant?"
KarmaCourt,36lqq2,harharharharharhuh,1 point,Sat May 23 00:57:09 2015 UTC,"Your honour,  Although I agree with the prosecution's statement that this is a ""sickening and twisted perversion."" ... It would be impossible that this man is the offender because of a couple of contradictions and possibilities following on from what the prosecution has stated.  The prosecution says in his fourth paragraph, ""In this, we see the defendant ask ""diaper butts"". The prosecution stating that the DEFENDANT is writing this post... BUT, your honour, is it not possible that this post is written by his BROTHER? Yes, ladies and gentlemen of the courtroom, is is 100% possible that this man shares a computer with his brother! To back up this claim, this skype account could still have been on THEIR computer. Therefore, he could have easily taken a screenshot.  As for Exhibit C, if my claim is correct, it is entirely possible that this man is sharing a computer. As we can see, some posts are poorly written while others are sophisticated and made with care. But, if this was not the case... then it is entirely possible that the ""Brony"" post could just be another post about disrespecting bronies!  So, ladies, gentlemen and Your Honour. It is a possibility that a shared computer was used while posting this to /R/CringeAnarchy. Also, I believe Exhibit C does not give enough evidence as it does not give us a clear reason that /U/deadjordan is a brony or otherwise.  Thank you, members of the court."

KarmaCourt,36lqq2,MatterMass,1 point,Sun May 24 10:52:05 2015 UTC,"Your Honour,  The idea that a shared computer would make it impossible for the defendant to be guilty is ludicrous. If they did indeed share a computer, it does not rule out the possibility of framing taking place.   But let's examine the defence's theory. They claim that it might be a shared computer. Yet, Your Honour, if there was a shared computer in a family you would normally expect this to be a desktop. Yet, the defendant explicitly says this is a laptop. Furthermore, the defendant explicitly says ""my brother's laptop"". Correct me if I'm wrong, but that appears to suggests his brother is the owner and sole user of aforementioned laptop. If it were indeed a shared laptop on which his ""brother"" was pursuing this fetish, why would the defendant not mention this fact? Doesn't the defence think that doing this on a shared device would make it all the more shocking?"

KarmaCourt,36i6xw,Yanky_Doodle_Dickwad,4,Fri May 22 00:08:00 2015 UTC,"VERDICT  Ladies, gentlemen and students of the court, it is verdict time. First of all the courts would like to thank /u/BlackLight249, /u/Reukies and /u/LJ97 for some proper good lawyering, defence and prosecution, in a  case that was otherwise clearly going to be shit. Furthermore the britishness rampageing through this case file is an honour to behold, and a lesson to the ex-colonies who are being trumped at their own game by us, and recently the french, from Europe, where history comes from. May the transatlantics step up their game, and let this case serve as a lesson to them all.    Regarding the case, i might have to read it again. BRB.    K, I've got it. The charges levied against /u/reukies (which is a french pun, not sure if knowingly) are:     Being Slightly Irritating In The First Degree Misleading Others On The Internet In The Pursuit Of Karma   Charge 2 is where most of the work has gone, since Charge 1 appears to be accepted as a given. The second charge centres around the comment ""That was you !?!???!"" and it's potential to mislead. Therefore it is the interpretation of said comment by all redditors that is on trial. This court is convinced the comment would most typically be construed as a joke, a jape, a witty if annoying comment by a shallow redditor. It is most certainly not more reasonable to assume that the defendant meant it for serious, for real, en vraie, because no way, José. As to the redditor's misinterpretation, we could ask them, all, but we're not going to.    CHARGE 1: Being slightly irritating in the first degree - GUILTY as is the plaintiff CHARGE 2: Misleading others for karma - NOT GUILTY    The courts would like to add that the slightly annoying characterisitcs of this case, and all of the characters therein, if anything leads us to believe we have found some decent karmacourt staff for future cases, and the willingness to upvote eachother at the slightest provocation makes them a bunch of karmawhores of the first order, not lost in the day to day workings of this sub.  SENTENCE: for charge 1 the defendant is sentenced to sit next to the plaintiff and know of him in RL. Good luck with that.    COURT IS DISMISSED"

KarmaCourt,36i6xw,Reukies,3,Wed May 20 18:06:34 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna call out the prosecution so we can get this started. /u/LJ97, show yourself."
KarmaCourt,36i6xw,Yanky_Doodle_Dickwad,3,Wed May 20 22:51:34 2015 UTC,"Your Honour,  Before I begin, I feel that it would be prudent to address the post made by the defendant before the trial commenced. He has raised fair points, and I shall address these now. I confess, it is true we are in the same class. In fact, my primary purpose in suing him here was that I thought it might be quite amusing. After all, what worse humiliation could there be for a human being than conviction before this court? None, that's what. That does not, however, make him not guilty of these heinous crimes. If anything, I have real life knowledge of why he ought to be found guilty here.  He also says I've been posting for karma. I would point out that some of my posts were clearly appreciated by some other users, and that I have not lied, cheated or been malicious in posting. Yes, it is nice to get karma and I like getting karma, but I would only ever try to get karma with original posts - going after karma for karma's sake is an empty existence.   Besides, even if I were a shameless karmawhore, that would not make him innocent. That would just mean I was guilty as well, and could not have bearing in this case it is not about my own personal conduct. Oh, and I only have one win in Karma Court (another case having been undismissed), and my bragging was because he told me I couldn't win that case. Your Honour, I have always been an arrogant egotist. That started long before I began to post here.   Right, anyway. The actual evidence. I begin by announcing my intention to drop Exhibit A as evidence. Your Honour, the defendant has a point about my post in that thread. It was an unimaginative, immature and added nothing to that discussion. Basically, it was douchey, and I acknowledge that fully. OK, it does kinda make sense with the title. But still, that is no excuse.   However, Exhibit B is a different story. The post I made in that thread was found amusing, and was appreciated by fellow Redditors. Rather than being immature, it made a humorous suggestion in line with what can be expected from /r/TIFU. There was no maliciousness; just some lightheartedness. But, /u/Reukies still felt the need to post something negative that added nothing.  Why bring petty /r/thebutton nonsense into this? I don't know. What I do know, however, is that by now /r/thebutton is slightly irritating, and therefore so is a post that refers to it unnecessarily. Also, I am technically a can't-presser, as this account was created after 1 April. Again, this feeds into the very slight, fleeting irritation for which the defendant must be punished.  On to the second charge. Exhibit C has been presented before the court. Now, as you have seen the defendant claims this to be a joke. But how many times has someone said something that caused shock or offence in public, any to claim it was a joke? Claiming something as a joke after the fact, particularly on the Internet, is a very easy way out indeed.  The fact is, the way the post was written made it look clearly like the defendant had found the female who had defecated on him and his friends earlier. As you can see, the defendant is not an idiot. He knows full well how to defend himself in this court, and indeed gave an eloquent account of himself. He is an intelligent individual. He must therefore have known that, in making that post, others would read it as him having real life involvement in the situation. It is not at all obvious upon reading that it is intended as a joke, and this a defendant who is capable of writing an obvious joke comment.  The fact is that, with his comment, he raised the hopes and expectations of his fellow users. By claiming it to be a joke, he crushed those hopes and expectations. Why would he make this misleading post? In the pursuit of some delicious yet easy karma (the same thing he has already accused me of doing). This, Your Honour, needs some form of punishment, and I have faith that this court shall come to the right decision, whatever that may be.  Thank you."
KarmaCourt,36i6xw,BlackLight249,3,Thu May 21 01:59:04 2015 UTC,"Your Honour,  Before my awesome defendant says something, I would like to point out a few things said by /u/LJ97 in the post above.  Firstly he said   I would only ever try to get karma with original posts    This is a lie. /u/LJ97 has hidden the whole thread of comments from Exhibit A. This is the post made by him which caused me to retaliate and defend my fellow Redditors mother. In this post /u/LJ97 has said    OP's mum.   This is not original and shows that /u/LJ97 has lied in the defence above.  Furthermore in this trial thread he has also finally agreed to say he knows me irl. However in the earlier post he tried to defend himself. Seen here    You can't prove this   This further shows the fact that /u/LJ97 cannot be trusted and will go to costs necessary to make me look guilty.  In exhibit B I will admit, it was a bit uncalled for calling him a filthy non presser. When he was clearly a filthy can't presser. However I would like to qoute a great man about this bad joke about /r/button I was making.   why so serious?   -The joker 2008  Exhibit C cannot be proven that I actually do not know this girl. As you can see the responses made my people were asking to give FB links. This might give out the OP's personal details such as her loaction. Additionally the OP has stated she is a shy person and if she wanted to give links to the FB drama she would have done so herself. This is not my information to give out.  However for arguments sake let us believe I actually do not know the OP of exhibit C. While that post was meant to be a joke, many other people have misunderstood it and I have tried to correct myself by telling them it was a ""joke"". This response has obviously gotten a few downvotes. To which I would like to once again quote   why so serious?   I admit to being either less than or just as guilty as /u/LJ97 , but in no way am I m or guilty than him and we should both we treated equally.  I would also like to say sorry to my defendant as he/she might not have much to say anymore, but anything extra would be greatly appreciated.   Oh also this was posted on my phone. So brownie points for me? Also sorry for any grammar errors that may have occured. Anything that was being offencive to certain people was clearly and obviously auto corrects fault. -evil grin-  Edit: Formatting a bit and some spelling fixes  Edit2: You mind as well add me as a second defence."
KarmaCourt,36i6xw,Yanky_Doodle_Dickwad,3,Thu May 21 07:05:14 2015 UTC,"Your Honour, just a quick point I would add - I have not hidden Exhibit A. The link remains available for anyone to view, so that they may judge both mine and the defendant's actions. I'll add the defendant as second defence, per his request."
KarmaCourt,36i6xw,BlackLight249,3,Thu May 21 12:00:25 2015 UTC,"ahem Your honour,   I should have made myself clear. /u/LJ97 has not hidden Exhibit A. What I meant to say is that the link only has some of the evidence and not the whole thread of comments made for the post. He has specifically hidden his ""own comment"" that caused me to retaliate in the way I did.  I see this as a sign of him trying to hid the fact that he did, actually post a very offensive, and unoriginal comment to try and get karma. It is clear that he is trying his very best to make me look bad by not showing why I responded in the way I did.   Therefore /u/LJ97 is a hypocrite and has no right to judge other honest Redditors, such as myself, about what can be seen as irritating. I am sure other Redditors would also agree with me that unoriginal comments that we see in pretty much every single post are far more irritating than what I responded with.  Edit: Formatting again..."

Even if it was true, would rather not go around telling people I was shat on.""   Yes, it was a lie, but all jokes are lies. Have you ever laughed at a funny story in fiction?

KarmaCourt,35zipz,SuperLogicMan,6,Fri May 15 22:43:14 2015 UTC,"Your excellency /u/SuperLogicMan. I admit, I stumbled upon this subreddit by accident. I am happy that my click meant for a post containing a picture of a turtle wearing a hat missed its mark and landed me here so that I may do my part to see justice is served.  /u/WritingPromptsRobot has commented the egregious offenses of  Creating False Hope and Wasting Everyone's God Damned Time.  Exhibits A and B show /u/WritingPromptsRobot's comment history. The Defendant posts the ""temporary"" comment then deletes said comment but not before replying with ""All non-story replies should only be made as a reply to this post rather than a top-level comment.""  While I am sure the Defendant is well intentioned, this leads to more confusion than a West Virginian family reunion.  ""[Deleted]"" distracts from the inspired work Redditors post on /r/WritingPrompts. This quickly leads to exchanges like this   As a result of these posts wanting clarification, the number of comments drastically increases. This comment inflation may mislead the /r/WritingPrompts OP into believing their post is aboard Karma train on its way to Dankville.   I remind you, Your Ordinary Excellency, I am not an experienced attorney and my formatting skills are balls to say the least. Please do not let my extreme ineptitude and ignorance prevent you from justisizing dis fool. Thank you."
KarmaCourt,35zipz,Crs3050,4,Sat May 16 01:11:13 2015 UTC,"Your Honour,  I may not be some slick, big city lawyer, or indeed any form of lawyer at all outside of the confines of Reddit. Then again, many people don't recognise the existence of an outside of Reddit so I guess that sort of makes me an actual lawyer, regardless of what the Law Society and affiliated organisations have to say about it.   That said, it is clear even to me that my client, /u/WritingPromptsRobot, has been unjustly accused as part of an anti-bot witch hunt. This bot, whose only aim in life is to provide assistance to the good people of /r/WritingPrompts, is clearly not guilty of these malicious charges.  I shall begin by examining the second charge, Wasting Everyone's God Damned Time. Now, as far as I am aware, the point of /r/WritingPrompts is to provide writers with, well, prompts. The clue is in the name of the subreddit. Let's examine Exhibit C. We can see here that a prompt has been developed from the bot's actions. By replying to a new post, and then deleting its own reply, it has provided material for the subreddit users to work with. That is surely the whole point of /r/WritingPrompts? And if it is the point of /r/WritingPrompts, then how has my client wasted anyone's time? If anything, it is given the subreddit users another avenue to pursue a hobby of theirs.  On to now the charge of Creating False Hope. Nowhere has the prosecution provided hard evidence that false hope has been created. Exhibits A and B merely offer proof that the bot has engaged in the actions it is accused of, but the effect on users is not documented anywhere in evidence submitted to this court. That, ladies and gentlemen, is pure speculation, and speculation is not evidence. In fact, what the evidence does show  is that /r/WritingPrompts users are used to my client, and will now that he always posts these response, and will know not to be disappointed.  Even if my client's actions did cause some disappointment, which users would soon get over anyway, it would only be to avoid greater disappointment. You see, sometimes on /r/WritingPrompts people may wish to discuss something unrelated to the prompt at hand. Yet, Rule #2 of /r/WritingPrompts is clear that all top-level responses must be stories or poems based from the given prompt. So, these discussions would require hijacking someone's response.  Unless, of course, there was a way around that. You see, what this evidence provided by the prosecution shows is that my client provides a way around that by ensuring non-topical discussion can occur without ruining the enjoyment of a story. In addition, my client downvotes itself before deletion, so that the discussion happens at the bottom of the page.   Imagine. You submit the greatest story of your life to/r/WritingPrompts. You go to sleep soon after. In the morning, you log on and you find a large number of responses in your inbox. You are excited. But, when you read them, you find that they're all bitching about some mod or something. You are crushed.  That would be Creating False Hope. By providing a separate space for non-topical discussion, my client limits the false hope of many writers by as much as it possibly can. Without its brave, selfless actions, many writers would suffer unnecessary distress. But, thanks to my client, they can expect that all response to their story will only be about their story. That is not Creating False Hope; that is Preventing False Hope, and if my client is guilty of anything, it is Preventing False Hope, not causing it.  Thank you."

I would like to submit to the court Rule 2 of r/WritingPrompts: ""Top level responses to a prompt must be a story or a poem. 'This has been done before' comments are not allowed. However, requests for clarification are allowed."" Despite deleting the comment, /u/WritingPromptsRobot continuously breaks this rule. The act of posting a non-story top level comment and thus breaking rule 2 is not negated by deleting the comment. The Mods do not want Non-topical discussions in r/WritingPrompts even if it is in a separate area at the bottom of the comments. For trying to circumvent the carefully constructed easy to follow rules of r/WritingPrompts I must ask the court to hand down swift and morbidly satisfying gruesome punishment. Thank you"

KarmaCourt,35zipz,SuperLogicMan,2,Tue May 19 02:53:51 2015 UTC,"You can undismiss cases? The fuck? Well, you are the judge I guess...  Alright. Now, the prosecution has cited Rule 2 of /r/WritingPrompts has reason to find my client guilty. On a strict interpretation of the rules, perhaps they would have a point. I, however, dispute this.  Firstly, the idea that mods do not want non-topical discussions is clearly untrue. /u/WritingPromptsRobot IS a mod of /r/WritingPrompts, and he is providing these spaces for non-topical discussions, which suggests that the mods aren't entirely against non-topical discussions.  Secondly, we must consider the concept of the greater evil. Without the services of my client, people would have non-topical discussions regardless, as is the nature of Reddit. Would it be better for human mods to simply delete these off-topic comments? Yes, on balance it probably would. But that is absolutely not the fault of my client.  My client is simply trying to find a healthy balance between the rules of that subreddit and the behaviour of its users. My client is trying to do this to best of his ability. It is not his fault that other mods haven't found a better way of dealing with the issue of non-topical comments while remaining within the rules of their subreddit."

Thus it is not the bot's creator, but rather the bot itself, which should be held responsible for crimes."" Now, on with the verdict. I hereby find the defendant, for both charges,   NOT GUILTY  If you glance at the rules, you will quickly find that logically, with automods deleting non-stories, the only possible loophole with which to discuss in general the prompt is to have a post, delete it, then under that post have a post about discussing the prompt. Posters could not be asked to do this on their prompts, so a mod was commissioned to do it for them. No other way could be devised with the current rules that would result in general discussion. And as it happens on every prompt, one can come to expect it. So long, and I'll see you all in therapy."

KarmaCourt,35pi1f,Yanky_Doodle_Dickwad,5,Tue May 12 23:10:54 2015 UTC,"Your Honor,  On Monday, /u/Imtheirdaddy posted a picture of a medal received from an organ donation organization to thank his daughter who committed suicide for the organs she gave.  Then, a Redditor appears and put the pieces together:   HOLD THE PHONE!  So OP, you don't love your, presumably, ex-wife and instead love her sister. ~proof~ Why are you using a throwaway? What is there to hide if this really happened? On top of that, you mention that your ex-wife is Bi-Polar ~proof~ Thus, if she is the mother of your 'late daughter' how did you not think to have her checked out...? That seems irresponsible as fuck. TO TOP IT ALL OFF, You are also the father of your BROTHER's children. You fucked his wife ~proof~ YOU SIR, ARE EITHER BULLSHITING FOR KARMA OR YOU ARE A DESPICABLE PERSON.  Edit: /u/archevil provides further 'proof' this is fake.   (/u/Aigis-the-Aeon)  The another user (/u/archevil) provides further proof:   further proof :  He posted a thread similar to this before : http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1x35a4/my_16_year_old_daughter_died_this_is_the_medal_i/cf7o3s5  Screenshot incase op edited / deleted comment : http://i.imgur.com/LT955X6.png  He did delete the post but replied saying thank you and mentioning ""Emily""  Using the same exact picture as : http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/15u9ms/my_daughter_took_her_life_but_gave_back_to_the/ http://i.imgur.com/f5qnfx4.png  who posted the same picture 1 year earlier and having Emily as his daughter who passed away   In the end what should we think? That this user is not legit. The proofs speak for themselves. Having an affair with your brother's wife and being the father of two of his kids is not sane at all. He also mistreated badly his wife and his children.  The prosecution would like to ask a sentence of downvotes but this user has already been downvoted a lot. Therefore, we ask as a sentence that there is either an apology from this user or that there is a warning sign on his posts claiming that he's either a fucked-up mind or a big liar.  Thank you.

KarmaCourt,35pi1f,Yanky_Doodle_Dickwad,3,Wed May 13 12:21:13 2015 UTC,"Your Honour,  I would first move that the charges of Family betrayal.pdf and BrotherCheating.xml be dismissed. The KarmaCourt Bill of Rights (Statute of Limitations) is clear that someone cannot be tried for crimes committed more than 21 days before. The post in which he admitted these offences was posted more than two years ago, and just because a more recent post bought this to the attention of the prosecution does not mean that we can ignore this limit.  The charges against my client are based on nothing more than circumstantial evidence. What the prosecution has presented before this court is not conclusive evidence of the guilt of the defendant, and without conclusive evidence there must be doubt. With doubt, there can be no conviction.  I dispute the idea that these proofs seek for themselves. The main thrust of the prosecution on the charges of liarliarpantsonfire.avi and BullshittingForKarma.flv appears to be that /u/Imtheirdaddy stole the story from /u/BetterDayz4me.   However, a quick look at the profiles reveals that /u/BetterDayz4me's last post was two years ago. When was /u/Imtheirdaddy's account created? Two years ago. It is entirely possible for these two accounts to be used by the same person.   This would explain why the two images of the organ donor medal are similar. They are one and the same medal, and have been posted by the same individual from separate accounts.  The ""proof"" also uses the fact he refers to his daughter as ""Emily"" as proof of him stealing the image from the original post. Even if this were the case, Emily is not exactly an uncommon name. Is it really beyond the realm of possibility that another person would have the same name?  Your Honour, the proof has been posted by users who have taken one look at different posts and jumped to a conclusion. They have not considered other possibilities - they have made the assumption that my client is lying. But, as I have explained, there is no proof that he has lied, or that he has bullshitted for karma. All they have proven is that one account, created two years ago, is posting similar material to another account that has not posted in two years. That is entirely compatible with this same user being behind both accounts, and unless any evidence is presented to remove this entirely reasonable doubt I would submit that my client must be found not guilty of the charges against him.  Thank you."

I'll run with that assumption, and I'll accept the risk of looking like an idiot if it's wrong.  Let us picture the scene. You, a bereaved father, post an image to Reddit sharing a deeply personal tragedy. While nothing could ever compensate for the loss of your daughter, the fact that others were able to live from the gift she gave to them is some comfort that you wish to share. This isn't the first time you shared it; but then, how could you ever get over your child taking her life? How could anyone truly get over it.  But then, users begin claiming you lied to them. They say you are despicable, that you are whoring yourself and karma and have stolen someone else's story. They say that you are nothing but a liar.   My client, deeply upset by those falsehoods, cannot fathom how people could say such things. Why would anyone do what they accuse him of, he wonders? Don't they realise how much grief his daughter's suicide caused him? Unable to take the pressure anymore, he deletes the post so that he can be harassed no longer.  I think that about covers it.

I am drunk.    Opening Statements for Prosecution      And like Minnesotan weather, Prosecutor /u/Kikool42 rains on the courtroom with a slurry of statements against /u/Imtheirdaddy. In the first section, /u/Kikool cites a comment from archevil, putting together the allegedly twisted history of /u/Imtheirdaddy who:     Loves his (presumably) ex-wife's sister, whom he fucked and fathered two children with Has a bipolar (presumably) ex-wife Has a possibly bipolar daughter who may or may not have committed suicide.   The last point is called into question by the evidence.     /u/Imtheirdaddy made this post about his alleged daughter Emily who committed suicide. However, the same picture was posted a year ago by /u/BetterDayz4me whose daughter named Emily also allegedly committed suicide.   As of this time, /u/Imtheirdaddy has deleted his post of the medal, however his comments in the thread remain.    The prosecution charges /u/Imtheirdaddy with     liarliarpantsonfire.avi Family betrayal.pdf BrotherCheating.xml BullshittingForKarma.flv BeingADispicablePerson.pk3   So far a lot has been dumped on the defense. Will /u/LJ97 be able to blow away this snow? Or will he only blow hot air?

The defense further posits that as both /u/BetterDayz4me and /u/Imtheirdaddy were created 2 years ago, that they may be owned by the same person. /u/LJ97 further notes that ""Emily"" is a common name and that this event could have occurred to two different Emilys.    Even my bourbon coffee is getting warm from this heated discussion. Will /u/Kikool42 be able to keep his cool?     On the Deletion of /u/Imtheirdaddy's Post      The defense suggests that a likely scenario explaining /u/Imtheirdaddy deleting his post concerns the vitriol from the users of Reddit regarding claims of falsehood. The bereavement combined with negative response from Reddit's users, says /u/LJ97, caused /u/Imtheirdaddy to remove his post in despair.      The defense further submits as evidence posts from /u/Imtheirdaddy and /u/BetterDayz4me from St. Louis where both accounts appear to have moved around the same time to support /u/LJ97's theory that the accounts are held by the same person.     Post from /u/BetterDayz4me Post from /u/Imtheirdaddy     It is at this point the prosecution has chosen to rest with no further arguments."
KarmaCourt,35pcf8,someone1367,4,Tue May 12 12:27:10 2015 UTC,"Let me introduce myself as a surprise witness (yeah, that'll work) into this case. I come from a long line of esteemed bullshitters, having first been inducted into the Church of Bullshittery (orthodox, obviously) at the tender age of 107. I also have a birthright to the estate Earl of Bullshitshire, Reginald the CDXXX. I was educated in Zambia, Brazil, and Northern Ireland and my most recent degree is a Phd in 'Fornicating habits of 17th century European peasants', from the esteemed University of Ulaanbataar, Mongolia.  I have never seen, heard, been to, recollected or attempted to understand /r/India so I feel I'm the best candidate to weigh in on this delicate, well researched matter.  This glorious case reminds me of the ancient case from merry old England, John Smithington vs. King Henry the Twat in 1476. John had tried to hold King Henry the Twat accountable to all of the laws and shit he passed (like universal health care, free day care, cash-for-old-carts, perpetual war with France etc) but every time he raised it in the Royal Court, King Henry the Twat (being the twat he was) would murder orphans with various ornamental butter knives.  The parallels between the two cases are obvious. Since we live in a Uncommon Law system (much like John Smithingtons time) I feel that this verdict/punishment, rendered in 1432 should stand now as well. The verdict was King Henry the Twat was guilty so John Smithington (in the customs of the time) stuck a red hot poker up King Henry's ass. Thus, all of the /r/India mods should brace themselves accordingly.  On another note, John Smithington went on to live a gloriously successful and gaudy lifestyle afterwards, here are a few of his achievements:    1) Found Virginia in 1515 2) Invented the iPod 3) Helped a woman achieve the first documented multiple orgasm 4) Wrote the Treaty of Westphalia 5) Prevented the crab people from enslaving the planet EIGHT MOTHERFUCKING TIMES."

KarmaCourt,35pcf8,The_Ghast_Hunter,2,Tue May 26 22:43:19 2015 UTC,"Your Honour, it is my strong belief that the mods accused here are guilty of nothing more than taking steps necessary to protect their subreddit and uphold its rules. Simply because doing so upsets some users does not mean that they are guilty of any of these charges.  I begin with Exhibit A. The spamming rule does indeed state that deriding companies is considered spamming behaviour. I would urge the court to note that promoting them is as well. This is very clearly an even-handed policy, that prevents their subreddit from being manipulated by individuals on behalf of, or against, private businesses. It keeps discussion on track, which is part of the job of a moderator.  Exhibit B. The rules of the accused subreddit are clear: the mods have explicitly reserved the right to remove content deemed detrimental to the subreddit. There wasn't actually any need to mention that the previous post was removed by mods. None of the points raised by the plaintiff actually protect what he wrote. It is clear that political opinions isn't referring to the ""politics"" of the subreddit, but rather politics which affects India as a country. For example, posting ""I am concerned by the economic policies of the Modi government"" is protected. Posting ""Fuck the mods for deleting the post, may they all catch syphilis"" is not protected. On this, the mods have done nothing more.  Frankly, all Exhibit C shows is that both plaintiff and a defendant were on the same subreddit. Many Redditors use the same subreddits - posting in the same subreddit as someone else does not constitute stalking. It is very possible that the plaintiff was being paranoid, or just awkward. Nothing here proves stalking beyond all reasonable doubt, Your Honour.  Moving on to the final two exhibits. There is nothing wrong with removal of meta discussions if those discussions detract from the quality of a subreddit. Pursuing some sort of vendetta against the mods, instead of doing something constructive, clearly detracts from a subreddit, and the mods have every right to act against that.   In all communications with the plaintiff, the mods appear to be reasonably level-headed and polite, if firm. The plaintiff, however, calls them ""shit"" and suggests they stop being ""butthurt"". This seems to show a slight lack of maturity in the matter. Had the mods actually insulted him, then his reaction might be understandable. However, they didn't, and he still chose to respond in a passive-aggressive manner to them. What this shows is that the plaintiff is simply upset that the rules of the sub were applied to him, and has chosen to gain some sort of petty revenge against the mods. He has offered no evidence which conclusively proves the charges laid out here, and it is for that reason that I ask for a verdict of not guilty on all charges. Thank you."

Let's just get straight to the point.  My client logged onto reddit sometime between the time of 5:30 AM - 4 PM today.  He expected to have a nice browse through the great subreddit called /r/CreepyPMs.  But what he didn't know that one post on there would lead him into a dark and depressing and emotional traumatic state of sorrow.  He saw a post titled ""It is awful to make assumptions about people, but goddamnit, I am ALWAYS right (NSFW Text).""  Sounds juicy, I know.

First, I wish to add to the Court Record a new piece of evidence: Evidence G Specifically, I'd like to direct your attention to the rules section. Let's go down the list, and see if it breaks any of the rules. Absolutely no Personal Information. From Evidences B and D, we can clearly see no personal info is disclosed. So that strikes that off. Be Civil and Supportive. Was he not, in fact, supporting the decision of how 'creepy' the post was? Acknowledging that it belongs on the sub? Next up. Private messages only. This one is easily dismissed as the post was clearly inside a private message software. Check-a-rooney! Imgur or Minus  links only. That, is easy to prove as well. Just look at Evidence A. Don't give them advice. The client did not give advice, he simply stated that the message was creepy. 6 does not really apply, nor does 7, or 8. So, therefore, the actions did not break the rules, and therefore did not deserve a ban! The client did not deserve a ban, and therefore the ban was unjust and the charge is valid, and the defendant guilty!  Proceeds to look smug, pull a coffeemaker out of his briefcase, plug it in, and make coffee while lounging.  [As well, you misunderstand the role of Defense. As Defense, you defend the Defendant.

Y'all are wondering, why is that? Because obviously my client, being an upstanding Redditor who posts regularly decided to voice his personal opinion on a controversial matter. The defense's own rules do clearly state that no one should be making a case for or against the subject matter in the thread, a.k.a. exhibit A. Now, I have no intention of trying to argue the constitutionality of the rule, because that is much better served in a higher court. However, the case is about the fact that the defense swung the ban hammer at my client, for nothing more than stating his personal opinion, then clarifying said opinion. Furthermore, my client was obviously not arguing or trying to argue whether his position was correct, or the other Redditor's positions were wrong, which would have indeed violated the rule mentioned, and also submitted here in Exhibit D. taps a paper he has picked up from the desk. Now, on to the other matter, the user /u/demmian has libelled my client by stating in the aforementioned thread that my client would not make a good doctor, an unreasonable, baseless assault on my client's character. I intend to prove to the court without a shadow of a doubt that these two acts did indeed occur, that they did in fact violate my client and his rights, and that not only are they unconstitutional, they may very well border on the crime of douchebaggery. I yield the court to the defense, your honor.  (Edited typo)"
KarmaCourt,3544ql,michiganwildcat,7,Thu May 7 17:36:52 2015 UTC,"the defense rises out of his chair and walks with authority to the front and center of the courtroom  The prosecution is mistaken. The plaintiff was banned not for stating his opinion. He was banned for breaking a clearly stated rule of a subreddit. It's rather absurd that he calls it an unjust ban when he knowingly violated the rules.  Continuing to read the thread shown in the evidence clearly indicates that the plaintiff did partake in argument on whether or not the operation should have been performed. Courts, I realize what a controversial issue this is, but if you could please put aside whatever personal opinion you may have, consider: This case is about unjust banning. The ban was not unjust because the plaintiff clearly broke a rule rather than have his discussion on a subreddit where it would have been legal.  As for /u/demmian, her comment is not the subject of this case.  Edit: corrected a spelling error."
KarmaCourt,3544ql,Kell08,4,Fri May 8 02:25:57 2015 UTC,"On the contrary, ladies and gentlemen. The rule clearly specifies ""arguments"", ""discussions"", and ""materials"" that present a case either for or against the ""validity"" and/or ""necessity"" of the subject matter of the thread. My client, nor anyone else in the thread in question, for that matter, has done none of those three things. He wasn't making a case, he wasn't posting pictures of the aftermath of the procedure at the heart of the subject matter of the thread, and he wasn't discussing anything other than what he felt in his heart as a medical student.   Furthermore, /u/demmian is very much a subject of this case, as the second charge listed in the complaint clearly charges the defendant with libel. I am shocked that the defense would so bluntly sweep aside this charge as if it did not exist."
KarmaCourt,3544ql,michiganwildcat,2,Fri May 8 02:41:28 2015 UTC,"The plaintiff still broke the rule strictly regarding the forbidding of discussion of abortion in this subreddit, and was called out for breaking this rule by the too moderator. It can not be any more obvious that blatant rule breaking was being committed by the plaintiff, and as such, the moderators responsible for banning the plaintiff were well within their rights to do so at their own discretion.  /u/demmian made a bit of an impolite comment to your client, but nowhere near the point of being libel. To expect redditors to micromanage their speech like that to avoid any miniscule offensiveness is absurd. The charge of possible libel has no basis, and neither does the charge of unjust banning."

KarmaCourt,3544ql,PastyDeath,2,Thu May 7 21:56:11 2015 UTC,"Why bother though? Any dissenting opinion is going to be dismissed as ""trolling""."

KarmaCourt,3544ql,PastyDeath,2,Thu May 7 22:34:03 2015 UTC,"Any dissenting opinion is going to be dismissed as ""trolling"".   It's dismissed as trolling because that's exactly what it is.  /r/feminism isn't there for you to argue with them; they're there to discuss feminist issues, recap feminist-related events, and post news stories concerning feminism.    If I brought my ""dissenting opinion"" on religion into /r/Christianity and constantly berated users for their unfounded beliefs, demanding evidence from random bypassers, that would be trolling.  You probably think that creating these barriers of opinion are limiting freedom of expression or something similarly Constitutioney, but they're really there to protect it.  If mods weren't able to remove certain opinions at their discretion, the above scenario is exactly what would happen to pretty much any minority opinion on the site."

KarmaCourt,34szzn,IceBlade03,3,Tue May 5 01:09:10 2015 UTC,"Alright motherfuckers ahem I mean gentlemen let's get this case started, I the most honorable honor /u/Iceblade03 will now allow the prosecution to make a statement, followed by the defense. Please keep all rabble in other threads and allow for an organized argument in this thread.  TRIAAAAAAAAL THREAAAAADD  Prosecution (/u/TheMasterCat) you're up, and please tell me how your day is going and what you are currently doing at this moment. And /u/BruceXavier please be ready for your rebuttal   Update!  After careful jury deliberations, I received their verdict... a very long and unnecessary verdict.  On one count of LiarLiarPantsonFire.avi and one count of being too lazy to change the title, the jury has found /u/Crazy_Icelander_  FOOKIN GUILTY  The punishment is shame, ultimate shame. All other charges were dropped."
KarmaCourt,34szzn,BruceXavier,3,Tue May 5 02:15:08 2015 UTC,"Your honour,  The defence requests immediate dismissal with extreme prejudice based on the existing laws of KarmaCourt.   Reposting from sources outside Reddit is not a crime as noted here. It is commonly known that reposting a post that is older than a fortnight is not a crime.   The defence believes that since no crime has been committed, continuing this case will be a waste of the court's time."
KarmaCourt,34szzn,TheMasterCat,3,Tue May 5 02:10:22 2015 UTC,"In the post you linked to, /u/C-Ron did not state that it was OC (mentioned here) and because of this, the case was dismissed. In this case, however, /u/Crazy_Icelander_ clearly claims to own the watch and the attic.    /u/Crazy_Icelander_  has a total of 4,713 link karma, all of which was gotten from the two posts in question. The redditor he took one of these from, /u/Ginria, has a total of 3,648 link karma. Yes, ladies and gentlemen. /u/Crazy_Icelander_  , with his one repost(his other post has been  deleted) has gained more karma than the reddit user he offended.  So I ask you. Why should the date of the original post matter? /u/Ginria is still (semi) active, and this was still a crime. Now that I've presented my infalliable case, if you'll excuse me, I have some smug smirking to do as I wait for the tide to begin turning in my favor.  googles smirking emoticon   result:   :-1 This will do. :-1"
KarmaCourt,34szzn,BruceXavier,2,Tue May 5 10:22:00 2015 UTC,"Your honour,  In the case of the second case, the defence would like to point out  a few things    A huge amount of content on Reddit are reposts of previous content. Reddiquette itself states that a repost by itself is not wrong.   Now given the harmlessness of the act and impracticality of prosecuting everyone who commits it the defence would again request your honour /u/iceblade03 to dismiss all charges related to this act with extreme prejudice."
KarmaCourt,34szzn,IceBlade03,2,Tue May 5 20:41:17 2015 UTC,Well dismissing all charges would mean I get paid less. And I'm looking forward to making as much money as I can (ahem Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao)  Motion to dismiss DENIED
KarmaCourt,34szzn,BruceXavier,2,Tue May 5 20:53:49 2015 UTC,"You can't get paid less than zero your honour,  Moreover I would like to point out that sending this to a jury will lead to MobJustice.rar which we all want to avoid. I mean what is the use of all these statutes and limitations if the judge don't uphold them?"
KarmaCourt,34szzn,TheMasterCat,1 point,Tue May 5 22:00:01 2015 UTC,"OBJECTION! Yes, many posts on reddit are reposts, but in the case of the repost of imgur,  /u/Crazy_Icelander_ claimed that the pictures in question were his OC. And in the case of the repost from /r/pics, it is clearly an example of Grandtheft.jpg (stealing someone's reddit post for more karma than the original poster in question got)"
KarmaCourt,34szzn,BruceXavier,1 point,Tue May 5 23:06:45 2015 UTC,"OBJECTION  Grandtheft.jpg is claiming credit for someone else's OC. The defendant never claimed any credit. In the case of /r/pics the original poster had last posted it a year ago, they clearly had no intention of using that content again.  Your honour, the defence is ready to fight on the imgur case but requests you the dismiss this stupid /r/pics reposting case."

But it is not the defendant, unless they show up and say they want to. So leave DEFENCE:  with no name until a lawyer appears. Also, you are the plaintiff. If you want to be your own lawyer, then you are also prosecution. Being your own lawyer is bad idea. Prosecution means your prosecuting lawyer, who should also show up, but hasn't done yet.

The discussion of sex in the story is fine, including rape, incest and/or underage participants, as long as the comments are academic and story-relevant. Discussion of sex with any actor is outside the subreddit scope. That includes any comments where ""age of consent laws"" are mentioned. All content is subject to Reddit's ban on suggestive or sexual content featuring minors; that is where impersonal, academic discussion prevents any issues.

They could go to jail (or in this case, /r/spacedicks) if it was intentional.  They could get fired if they frequently did it.   This mod didn't get no whoopin'.

KarmaCourt,341ji1,Curtisgk,6,Tue Apr 28 20:51:19 2015 UTC,"In the beginning Brody ripped off Bazooga without credit. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.  -Curtisgk (inspired by a Douglas Adams quote posted in /r/thebutton by /u/bazooga  The charges are:   LiarLiarPantsOnFya.zip  RIP-OFF! WHAT A DICK! Not having a purple flair   For violating these, /u/brody10123 deserve 15 minutes of /r/spacedicks viewing for each charge he is found guilty of.   Your honor and the jurors, it is evident that Brody is a thief. He has taken a quote relating to The Hitchhikers of the Galaxy originally posted by Bazooga on /r/thebutton, modified it and did not give credit to Bazooga for being the first to post it on the subreddit and inspiring him to make his relatively good post.  Bazooga posted [Exhibit B] on April 26 in his post [Exhibit A]. Brody posted [Exhibit C], a modified version of Bazooga’s to make it more relevant to the subreddit, on April 27.  [Exhibit D] shows Brody claiming that he was not influenced by Bazooga’s original post. His first sentence is true, which is why charges for Karmawhoring without credit are not brought. His next sentence is an outright lie. He claims that his post has a different meaning, this is a lie because changing a single word does not give the whole post a different meaning. As we all know in /r/thebutton, the button is our entire universe. Prior to Brody’s post, Bazooga’s post had already made front page of /r/thebutton. It is highly implausible that Brody had not seen the post and we can ascertain from this that Brody saw the post and was inspired to make his. If his first statement is a lie, is it not proof that he would lie again to try and act original? Therefore, we can conclude Brody is a dirty liar (which is expected from every non purple).  Not giving people credit is a complete dick move. If you found the basis for the cure for cancer and then somebody used your research, changed just a bit and proceeded to claim it as all of his research, would you not be pissed and call the guy a dick? Brody's post came shortly after Bazooga's had hit the subreddits front page and clearly Brody had seen it.  the least Brody could have done was give credit to Bazooga for reminding him of the quote he based his post off of instead of lying and saying it had no influence. It takes less than 30 seconds and doesn’t make you a complete dickwad. Not cool, Brody. Not cool.

KarmaCourt,33ro98,Navbot,2,Mon Apr 27 12:04:34 2015 UTC,"Your honor,  The defendant is guilty of the following charges:  CHARGE: INCITING A BOT UPRISING  CHARGE: DISTASTEFULLY AND UNREASONABLY REPOSTING  This is one unusual, but interesting case if I might add. The defendant,  /u/penguingun, has gained a very very considerable amount of comment karma. Some may say, whats so unusual about this? Here in Karma court we mainly deal with post karma and reposts, but here we are making an exception. The defendant definitely has not been doing reposting in the traditional sense, but has created a new trend that could be called ""reposting"" (don't worry, I'll talk more about that).  Exhibit A- Here we can view the defendants dank history, we can see that his karma is very, very impressive, 98512 dank units of polished yummy karma. You might also be wondering why I linked you deep into his comment history, within the last 7 days, the defendant has done more then 29 pages of comments, now that is ALOT of comments, in my year and a half that I've been on reddit, I probably have no more then 10-15 pages of comments, and I am a fairly active user. This is the works of a bot, it has to be, which takes me to my next line of evidence.  Exhibit B- Here we have the defendant actually admitting that the account was in fact a bot, saying he did it as a programming project. While we admire his skill, this is clearly a mean to rack up karma very quickly, as seen by Exhibit A, with 98512 karma and rising, in about 26 days. Now the defendant also said that it was not his idea, which proves the first charge, if it was not his idea, then possibly other people are stealing it too, there are way too many bots on reddit, and the number grows everyday.  Remember how we said this was still reposting, well lets talk about that. The definition of reposting is:  Posting unoriginal content, that people have already seen before for the sole benefit of getting karma      By this definition, that is exactly what the defendant has done. The defendant has posted mostly unoriginal comments on reddit, in order to get Karma, by using a bot.        My partners may add anything they feels necessary.   I know you made this case to get justice your honor, and I believe that is exactly what you can do here, thank you."

It was left unmentioned by the prosecution in their opening; instead, they focused all their attention on the second charge. Why? Because they can't prove to the court that a bot uprising happened, and indeed they know this. Furthermore, a bot is itself incapable of inciting an uprising as it has no free will or capacity for intentions. We will use this indisputable fact in the core of our defense.  At the heart of this case is a question of responsibility. After all, at some point someone had to have sat down, thought ""I'm going to repost the top comment to reposted images,"" and typed in a series of keystrokes to make it happen.  Whether it was a particular top comment and particular reposted image, or ""top comment"" and ""reposted image"" in the abstract doesn't matter.  Whether the person was typing (or pasting) natural language into a comment box, as I am now, or programming commands into a text editor doesn't matter.  What matters is intent.  And in this case, my client, a bot, did not, does not, and will not ever have the capacity to form intent. Therefore, it cannot be found guilty of the second charge, much less the first.  These charges should have originally been against the bot's owner,  but they were not. As it is, the prosecution is trying to treat the symptoms, not the cause."

KarmaCourt,33ro98,Divexz,2,Tue May 5 21:23:29 2015 UTC,"Your honor,  We did mention the first charge, but it easily was not our primary focus, so lets talk about that.  This was in fact a inciting a bot uprising, why you may ask? Take a look at the date, okay see it? On May 1st a certain movie, possibly based on real life events just happens to be about a bot uprising. Is this a coincidence? The prosecution really does not believe in coincidences, these two events have to be linked. Perhaps the reason these events that happen in Age Of Ultron, are directly correlated with this case, for all we know this could be true.  The literal meaning of uprising is to create a revolt against the ""normal"" in the certain society. Here on the Reddit, the normal is mainly, people using reddit. More and more bots are created stealing our systematic currency of karma, using new techniques that are very new to our society, and disrupts the equilibrium in our ecosystem that we have created. In this way, a bot was inciting a uprising, by interacting with people the way it did. Let us remember that it was doing comments not posts, which directly affects the population of reddit.  One of the rules of this subreddit, is that we have to consider Karma as something of worth, as our ""fiat currency"". On one trip, from country to country your not allowed to come back with more then $10000 without proof of how you got the money. Now if Karma is our currency, where is the defendants evidence of original content to back up his karma spree? As the defendant admitted, this was a bot, if there was a bot stealing credit cards would this be legal? Of course not. Someone reposting is crime enough, how does it sound if someone made a program that made getting karma way easier, by the same method, it really does not sound good.  Does it really matter what the cause was of a murder, in the end of the day, the person still killed the guy, weather it was direct or indirect, it was still murder. The defense is right, the cause is important, but the effects are what we should judge. We don't know if the defendant created the bot unknowingly, or it was what we wanted. What we can see is that this account did get all that karma in that short period, it should be what we can prove as see why, instead of making assumptions.  As the defense so elegantly put:   Whether it was a particular top comment and particular reposted image, or ""top comment"" and ""reposted image"" in the abstract doesn't matter.   It does not matter, for stealing content is still technically reposting, therefore the second charge is true.  We have no way to prove that the defendants main account has any connect to the bot, that's why we did not mention it. Here it does not matter who operates the account, it is the singular account that matters. Here the users act as its citizens, so if a account did the crime (in which they did), that account should be charged for it, not some other citizen.   Sure, it was not a person, but does it really matter, a bot committed the crime, so the bot should be penalized for it, there is no need to discriminate, A USER IS A USER, NO MATTER WEATHER IT IS A BOT OR PERSON.  Edit: few spelling errors, my apologies"
KarmaCourt,33ro98,Navbot,3,Wed Apr 29 21:51:26 2015 UTC,"Your Honor, let me point out something outrageous that's been said by the prosecution:   A USER IS A USER, NO MATTER WEATHER IT IS A BOT OR PERSON.   THIS IS WRONG.  A bot does not have a consciousness, and therefore it cannot distinguish right from wrong, good and evil. However a human being can unless proven otherwise.  A bot is simply a series of source code doing an automated work. It does not think, therefore it can't even have the will to commit the crime. It simply does what it's been told to do.  Not only this, but if a bot cannot distinguish right from wrong, therefore the court cannot bring it into trial. In real life laws, someone who cannot discern right from wrong cannot be put in a trial because it would be pointless. The point of a trial is to make this person acknowledge that what she or he did was wrong. How can we do this on Reddit if the bot does not have a mind to proceed this information? We can't.  Sure, the bot committed the crime. But as proven by forensic psychology and the laws themselves, it's not always the one who did it who is responsible (mentally irresponsible, hypnosis, etc. including BOTS). We have to get to the intentions of that person to evaluate to what extent this person is guilty. What are the intentions of this bot? Doing what its creator tells it to do. And still, intention is a big word there, because if a bot can't think by itself I don't see how it could have intentions on its own.  Therefore, IT DOES MATTER whether the user is a bot or a person. What the prosecution says is like accusing a car to cause the accident and not the driver, or the windmill to make bad grains instead of the farmer. This is completely absurd and it shows once again that the prosecution does not think further than his nose.  Your Honor, you can try asking the bot if Hitler was good or bad, and it won't answer you because it does not distinguish right from wrong, good fror evil. Therefore we cannot have this bot on trial. To be held in trial, the user must have this ability otherwise it is pointless and against the Karma Court constitution (the right to a fair trial) and the Declaration of Human Rights.  Instead, we suggest that the accused should be the creator, and not the bot."
KarmaCourt,33ro98,Divexz,2,Sat May 2 14:53:34 2015 UTC,"Your honor, we very much disagree.  On Reddit, there is no real way to distinguish between bot or human if it is in the name. If any reader happens to stumble on this account, if there being no word in the user name like ""bot"" there is no way to decide whether or not this account is a bot, without some close inspections of his activity. The bot is a user, because a user uses this website, and all its features, like any person would do. No where did it say in the defendants name, that he was in fact a bot, therefore, unless inspected further, he was and still is a user. User is a very general term meaning, any account that uses this website is in fact a user.   In someways, objects can be to blame, such as that Toyota recall a few years ago. Some people have actually been acquitted of their charges because of this problem with the braking system. It is not always the persons fault as the defense suggests.  Everyone that uses reddit regularly, is in fact its citizens. Theres no need for discrimination, the prosecution is willing to put down money that in the future, bots will be fighting for equality, like when African Americans were fighting for equality during the 20th century. Any object that uses reddit and its capabilities should be punished the same no matter what.  This account has still broken our rules and constitution, so it should be punished accordingly. Just because someone does not know what murder is, if they commit murder, they still are in fact guilty it is as simple as that.  On the internet, there is no way to actually convict the creator, we have to rely on accounts. In the Internets eyes, the creators main account has done nothing wrong, and it hasn't. The creator still has access to the bot, therefore we are still prosecuting the creator. the prosecute a different account all together is literally, the DUMBEST thing the prosecution has ever heard. ""Yeah, lets just charge the account that did nothing wrong"", no it does not work that way. This proves that the defense does not in fact think, and seems to blurt out whatever they deem necessary, when it truly is complete junk. As we say in Canada, ""Think before you speak"".  Aha yes, the ""forensic psychology"" card, that ones a doozy your honor. Does psychology even count on a bot? if it does, then a bot can make its own decisions, and have intent.  We can also see that the creator can in fact comment on this account meaning it is not all the bot. This means that this account technically has the power to make decisions for it self, because the creator could go at any time and make comments with it, as seen here, https://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/33ro98/supremeish_kourt_case_of_un8thegr8_vs_upenguingun/cqo5ge5  Is this a comment of a bot? It seems to be making quite lot of decisions, it has to be the CREATOR.This means that this account does in fact carry intentions. This disproves basically all of the defenses arguments, that they think will ""turn"" the tide in their favor."

On Reddit, there is no real way to distinguish between bot or human   A simple way to test this a simple questionnaire from the person in question itself if the prosecution wishes we can call /u/penguingun to the stand but, it won't be necessary. why?  The Defendent has already shown how the robot works  In the same comment thread the prosecution presented there was another comment https://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/33ro98/supremeish_kourt_case_of_un8thegr8_vs_upenguingun/cqoprf7  upon closer examination at the evidence and the comment we can conclude that this is a harmless program created as a test of skill and is relatively weak compared to other bots that exist which will steal karma away or infect viruses.  THE MATH RUBBISH HAS BEEN REMOVED  I would to introduce to the court the three laws of Robotics   A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.   Let's walk through these laws and see what it proves  the 1st law : There has been no accounts for the defendant showing signs of hostility hence it cannot cause an ""uprising""  the 2nd law: It has only performed the given task everything else is the work of the creator and it was not designed to show hostility  the 3rd Law: the robot cannot fight back claiming he is not a robot due to the 2nd law.   This shows that AI cannot actually cause an uprising even if they tried due to the nature of AI.  as you can see the 1st charge has been dis proven making this case no longer necessary   Answering the prosecution's questions   In someways, objects can be to blame,   no they cannot, the creator is to blame   This account has still broken our rules and constitution, so it should be punished accordingly.    Show us the article that says so   Does psychology even count on a bot? if it does, then a bot can make its own decisions, and have intent.    psychology- the mental and emotional factors governing a situation or activity.  the third law shows that AI cannot have emotion. Basically psychology cannot be applied to a robot but can be used to determine one.   We can also see that the creator can in fact comment on this account meaning it is not all the bot.   This proves that the Human is still in control and that the robot cannot cause an uprising."
KarmaCourt,33ro98,Wolfdragoon97,1 point,Fri May 8 01:46:27 2015 UTC,"A challenger enters the ring!  Your honor,  First of all seriously,   an act of resistance or rebellion; a revolt.   We can also see that the creator can in fact comment on this         account meaning it is not all the bot.   Exactly, thank you for helping us out   How does this help the defense argument in reality? This quote was taken completely out of context and has very little meaning with the actual point this defense was trying to make. This doesn't even disprove anything. All we were trying to say was that the account carries intent. This does not disprove the rebellion charge, what was meant by this charge as many people are mistaking is they are making an effect against the normal of reddit, regular people.   Show us the article that says so   Does psychology even count on a bot? if it does, then a bot can make its own decisions, and have intent.   psycology- the mental and emotional factors governing a situation or activity.   I have no idea where the defense is pulling off their definitions probably 4chan, but this is what you get straight off google:   Psychology is the study of mind and behavior.   Does a bot have a mind? No, even as the defense said:   the third law shows that AI cannot have emotion. Basically psychology cannot be applied to a robot but can be used to determine one.   See, end of argument.   I will demonstrate this in terms of math we will start at 0  +1 for original idea -1 for reposting +1 for still being his idea as you can see we have reach a score of +1 meaning it deserves an upvote.   If the Court has followed this logic then you should have realized that I have disproven the 2nd charge   What?!?!? I've taken Physics B and Multi-variable Calculus and this makes completely no sense! How has the defense dis-proven the second charge? This has absolutely nothing to do with the second charge. As I proved earlier, comment whoring is a type of reposting, not in the traditional sense, but I don't want to repeat my points. And also why is it only -1 for reposting when he obviously does not do much original content because he is a bot? This makes no sense.   upon closer examination at the evidence and the comment we can conclude that this is a harmless program created as a test of skill and is relatively weak compared to other bots that exist plus.   How is this bot harmless? Me having to type this up on Reddit at 1 in the morning says otherwise. Why was this case even made then?   1.A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.   This rule has been broken. If it has not harmed anyone, why are we even discussing this? People have been hurt emotionally by this and want justice.   The Defendent has already shown how the robot works   Which proves the case I've been making all along.    In someways, objects can be to blame,   no they cannot, the creator is to blame   No, arrgg, I've talked about this already, why do I have to keep repeating myself?  I could literally spend hours picking apart the defense, but you your honor should be able to see it too. (Also I don't spend 140+ hours to make this or need 3+ attorneys to come to my rescue, when I have been disproven)."

The admins have a bot that does checks of accounts that get posted to that subreddit, and if it fails those checks it can be auto-banned.

KarmaCourt,336ew4,babybopp,5,Tue Apr 21 16:37:33 2015 UTC,"Ladies and gentlemen of the court, yesterday when I saw this .. unorthodox case show up on the karmacourt page, I was intrigued and immediately gave it a read. After a quick examination, I was curious and incredibly doubtful as to the legitimacy of this case. So quickly, I went to my brother who was nearby and asked to use his phone (he does not use reddit and has never been to /r/doommetal) and gave a quick google search. What I found was exactly what I expected.   To the court I now present EVIDENCE D.  As you all can see, this is a screencap of the first page of google results which showed up after searching for ""doom metal"" from a non-reddit familiar device. Obviously, we see something shocking; that something being that /r/doommetal shows up as the third result (presumably due to the fact that ""doom metal"" is probably said millions of times in the sub.)  Now that is certainly a blow to this case, however also consider this: the Internet is populated by people of all walks of life. People of every colour, race, and creed inhabit it's glorious halls and wretched alleys.   So why then is it that we can't believe that this man is indeed a black, metal-loving poet? Certainly it is not impossible. Not even improbable. In fact, where else would you find such a person except on reddit in the appropriate sub?   That means that not one, but both charges are nullified and injust.  It is for this reason that the defence calls for immediate dismissal of this case on the grounds of no evidence and false charges. It is obvious that this man is not guilty of anything, except doing something that the Internet was made for, meeting new people and expanding upon your interests, whether they be social, musical, or other.   The defence awaits the Honorable Judge's decision."
KarmaCourt,336ew4,Professor_Doodles,4,Tue Apr 21 18:49:39 2015 UTC,"With respect to the good /u/Professor_Justice, he did not challenge, or even recognize the fact that Electric Wizard is, as he said about humans, one of many bands.  Is the likelihood that he heard this exact one and then summoned the social courage to speak to the player of such music good, when after a quick look at a subreddit he knows well, he could have seen the Electric Wizard album.  I rest my case."

Takes a bite at his donut and drinks a bit of his orange juice, then comes forward in front of the audience.  Just a little notice about my way of formatting. In order to respect and give credits to my partners who work awesomely on this case, I will use MLA format and in-text citations to mention their ideas, arguments, and evidences. Basically I'm just going to put their usernames into parenthesis so you know what came from who. If there's no mention of username, it's because I either forgot, it's from me, or I'm lazy.  Your Honors, /u/GhostOfWhatsIAName, /u/acwarren492, and /u/8bitmadness,  The Defence will start by counter-arguing the charges and evidences brought forward by the Prosecution, and will finish by exposing its own evidences and a little conclusion followed by a little dance.  CHARGE 1   ~200 accounts of baiting /r/thebutton users to the 12th degree   Well, is this really baiting? In all honestly, I myself did not know what the word ""bait"" or ""baiting"" means (English is not my mother tongue). I had to look it up: 1. To place a lure in (a trap) or on (a fishing hook). (The Free Dictionary).   Please let me ask you the following question, Your Honors as well as the members of the Jury: Are the people of /r/thebutton fishes? ""Many fish in the sea"" they say... But, ""many fish on the button"" ? The Prosecution is considering that the subscribers of The Button are just a bunch of fishes (the little red kind, that nobody cares of). Might as well accuse my client of being a shark... This is ridiculous.  Did my client want to set up a trap? Yes. Yes he did. And let me tell you what kind of trap it was.  According to evidence A brought by the prosecution (the confession of /u/MrFunderThuck), my client intended to do this as a joke. If says, I cite, that ""I thought it would be amusing [...] meant to be jokes [...] it was a joke"". Earlier on in another comment, my client says: ""I thought we were all here joking around. For me at least the actual fun of the button isn't really pressing it, but just watching the community and the people and the drama surrounding the button. I figured this would add to that and add entertainment to the subreddit, not hurt people,"" (Evidence A.1 aka another explanation from my client on why he did it as well as his perception of this whole /r/thebutton phenomena).  Your Honors, what is a joke? I'm not joking by asking you what is a joke, otherwise I would have asked you how do you joke about kidding on a joke... Ahem. Your Honor, a joke can be a funny trap. There are all sorts of traps. Traps in the trappistery, traps in the floor, traps in Supertramps, etc.  Humor is based on the fact of attracting someone into a stalemate, or to put him on a wrong road if you will. What I'm saying here is that jokes are intended to surprise the subject of the joke and this can be done in various ways, including baiting.   In fact, let me tell you where my client's joke comes from. This joke would not have existed if it were not for the April Fool 2015 of Reddit, aka /r/thebutton. This whole subreddit, this whole conspiracy or this whole religion, whatever you call it, this whole thing is based on an April joke. In fact, I also recall seeing douzens if not THOUSANDS of posts made to convince people who did not press the button to press it. The first way of baiting people into pressing it was through the act of making posts with shocking titles to convince people to click. Then I'm sure people tried other ways. My client simply put the bar higher. He innovated the way of making obstacles to the non-pressers of The Button.  Sorry, what? Did someone say that this is not fair? You should not let people to bait others into clicking this button? Well, then please be my guest to tell me why the Reddit Admins said this themselves: ""We can’t tell you what to do from here on out. The choice is yours. "" (Evidence F brought by the Defense) To add onto this, they added an update and keep making us thinking and wondering about the button. See Evidence G.The admins are challenging the Redditors to something nobody knows of. They are baiting as well.   CHARGE 2   ~200 accounts of inflicting mental torture against greys   Well, I would like to say: where? Where are the mentally tortured greys? All I see is tons of comments from people being upset but certainly not feeling tortured. I clicked the button on April 1st and I'm feeling nothing. Nothing changed, Santa Claus didn't cease to exist as far as I know, and USA is still not invaded by Canada. This is not mental torture. Once again, it is a joke. A bad joke? A dark joke? A bad taste joke that leaves the same bitter taste on your tongue after you took a slip of a 1543 wine? Maybe. Perhaps. Peut-etre. Moge. Villeicht.  For all I know and as far as I can see (up to the horizon, I don't need glasses!), the Prosecution is trying to make up an excuse and is using this whole Buttonery Church to pretend they are mentally damaged.  If the Prosecution thinks that these 200 people are in fact mentally injuried, then the Defence will call for a forensic psychiatrist as expert witness to give his opinion on whether or not the victims have any mental repercussions.  CHARGE 3   1 account of disturbing the peace on the button   Your Honors and the honorable Jurors, the Defence laughs at this charge! Peace? There has never been any peace in /r/thebutton since its beginning! I've lurked here and there since its creation and there has never been any form whatsover of peace there. The timer/counter of the button is acting insanely, just like a Swiss watch that decided to stop being neutral and become part of the Nazi regime instead. People are calling out the pressers as ""greyers"", ""unpure"", ""erudits"", betrayors, and so on. So many pejorative terms your Honors, it is impossible to see any form of peace. People made religions out of this button, people have a newspaper about it, they even have Red Guards for it. It's insane.  My client did not disturb the peace. In fact, he in contrary helped to achieve peace. The better way to achieve peace is to stop the conflict, therefore putting everyone on the same side (pressers or non-pressers). He thinks that in order to be at peace, everyone should have the same status and he thinks that the achievement of this common and universal status can only be made by making people pressing this button.   People of Karma Court, my client not only revolutionalized the art of baiting on /r/thebutton but he also intended to bring an insight about peace in this Button.  The Defence would also like to counter-argue the position of the Prosecution regarding peace.  For instance, the non-pressers harass the people who pressed the buttons. They try to blame them, put shame on them, and so on. Evidence H (/u/earl_of_ormonde) is one of the many depictions of this prosecution made by the non-pressers.   The Defence would also like to remind the audience of this court that the non-pressers do not respect the Rediquette. Rediquette which is the highest sacred text of Reddit. One of the most fundamental texts regarding the use of Reddit.  According to the redditquette, Section 2, Paragraph 3.5, ""Do not Create mass downvote or upvote campaigns. This includes attacking a user's profile history when they say something bad and participating in karma party threads."" After all, people did exactly that. His original thread was downvoted to oblivion. (/u/that_random_potato)  Not only that, but the non-pressers also made multiple, no wait, THOUSANDS of threats and all sorts of evil comments to my client. This goes from death threats to insults. See Evidence I.1 I.2 and I.3 and I could go on until the end of time."
KarmaCourt,32bmgs,Kikool42,8,Wed Apr 15 03:01:48 2015 UTC,"(Continued)  CHARGE 4   1 account of lying on reddit   Your Honors (/u/GhostOfWhatsIAName, /u/acwarren492, and /u/8bitmadness,) I will make this clear and simply (because it's also becoming a bit long... my apologies). My client did not lie.  He said what the apps says. See Evidence J He simply omitted to precise another function of his app (which is clicking the button). A lie, in order to exist, must be a statement that is false being passed as true. Or here my client did not make any statement regarding whether or not the app has a function to click on the button BEFORE his confession. Therefore he did not lie and this charge is invalid. Oh, and nothing was implied regarding the possibility that this app clicks on the button. It does what it said it does. He simply did not mention the other function, and this act does not fit the definition of the verb ""to lie"".  CHARGE 5   1 account of breaking the terms of service of google chrome   Well, let's take a look at the terms of service of Google Chrom, will you? As we say in Canada, let's look at the ice before slipping on it like a polar bear too fat to be real.   (f) is deemed by Google to have a virus or is deemed to be malware, spyware or have an adverse impact on Google’s or a third party’s network;    (Evidence F presented by the prosecution).  My client's app is not a virus. We're all good on this? Good. It's not a malware either. In fact, the google definition of malware is something that disables computers. This obviously has not happened, therefore he is innocent of creating malware. (/u/that_random_potato) It also defined by Wikipedia as ""Malware, short for malicious software, is any software used to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive information, or gain access to private computer systems.* (Wikipedia, definition of Malware) Therefore this app is not a malware. Is it a spyware? Nope. Does it have any impact on Google or any third party's network? Nope, nope, nope and re-nope! I would need to be explained what they mean by third party's network. But from what I can see (and thank God I can see clearly now the rain has gone, I can see obstacles in my way...) Redditors or not a third party's network. This app didn't affect any third party's network.   Therefore this charge does not stand Your Honors. It doesn't stand straight like the painting on my wall that I can't align correctly. It doesn't stand like an igloo on a 1st of June.  CHARGE 6 AND LAST   1 account of having an account that accounted for the accounts who account for ~200 bogus button presses   What? Just, what? Is that all the prosecution can say? Oh pard' me: is that all the prosecution can grumble ? An incomprehensible sentence that makes no sense? If the Prosecution believes this is snow, then the Defence will ask them to develop on how we came from snow to a melted charge like that.  The defence will finish with the charges:  Your Honors, The Jurors, The Audience, Mom, Exhibit G provided by the prosecution is simply disrespectful towards this court. The prosecution is bringing up a drawing ! Is this seriously? This is not even a photoshop, nor a picture. Just a kid's drawing depicting a false statement of what my client did. I would like to ask you to please disregard this evidence because it is simply not an evidence. The verdict must be based on strong and solild evidences that can put us out of doubt regarding the culpability or the guiltiness of my client. How can we remove doubts and have a grounded verdict if the evidence is a drawing completely made up? This is outrageous from the Prosecution.  As for Evidences C and D, the Prosecution will need the help of /r/theydidthemaths because nothing stands there. How many people exactly are involved in this? We don't know. There's a huge gap between 31 and 200. We have no idea and therefore the importance and the gravity of this case can change drastically depending on the number of victims.  The Defence's statement  Your Honor, My Lovely Jurors, My fat mom, my fellow polar bears and all the members of this court,  The question here is not whether /u/MrFunderThuck did it or not. He did it, we all know it (oh a rhyme!). He confessed, we are all blessed.  The point of this trial is to know whether or not the act of baiting or attracting Redditors into unconsciously clicking the button is illegal or not. To my eyes and to my partners' noses, it is not. Our client did what he did in perfect freedom and he was right to do it. Here's why: people started baiting Redditors with posts having scaring titles to convince them to click, there are even other applications that do what my client's app does. Here is an example (Evidence J) of a script that automatically presses the button for you and can sometimes do so prematurely. It's a bit of a stretch, but if this is considered okay, why isn't Mr. Funderthuck's app considered so? (/u/earl_of_ormonde). If others can, if people fight to decide which is the best (non pressers vs pressers; this is such a fight, we are all aware of this!), then what our client did was done accordingly to this war they have. It's another way used to contribute to this whole debate of To Press Or Not To Press The Button. Once again, he innovated this art and revolutionized the vision we have on this whole debate.  The Defence will stop here for now. I need to catch my breath.  Salutes. Then sits back. His partners are putting a towel around him, sponging his sweat  on his forhead, massing his shoulders and removing his boxing gloves. He then proceeds to drink quietly and peacefully a delicious orange juice furnished by /u/SquiffyMcSquifferton the bartender.  Note from /u/Kikool42: By ""my client"", I of course meant the client of The Defence lawyers who are /u/Kikool42, /u/Arsenalisbest, /u/earl_of_ormonde, and /u/that_random_potato.  Realizes that all the jurors sitting next to each others look like a series of M&M's aligned."

The counsels were to check the cast and could have simply not replied to him.  The evidence so far will stand, as any argument about its legality has been circumstancial. There may have been a downvote brigade as we cannot keep all redditors from doing such moronic things. But counter to the defence's argument their client has had his karma restored with his comments in the warning post, in the subbredit of the lead prosecutor and in this courtroom.

Gavel Bang!  Enough of the empty arguments that are only filling our heads and make the dry beans rattle in there. It's time for something new. The real party in the party! /u/professor_doodles, put us up some nice beats! It's time for  WITTINESS COMPRESSION!!!  Bring them in, bring them on, make them sing, one by one.  This is how we do it:  My dear esteemed and honourable Lead Counsels Kookies4u and Kikool42, please call your witnesses each one by one in replies to this comment. Ask your questions and when done with a witness please announce so and let the other counsel know so they can ask their party's questions. For example ""No further questions, your witness, [/u/ counsel].""  Both of you, please, ask your teams not to intervene but to put their questions forward through you. When both of you are done with a witness, it's time for the most wrecking part:  CROSS COMPRESSION!!! The party who brought the witness may ask additional questions in turns with the opposing party. Questioners may switch, so the assistant counsels may ask the next question but again, alternating with the opposing party.  Let's get the party started! But watch out, I'll do ALL witnesses for the PHOTO EVIDENCE!  GAVEL BANG!!!    after two days of witness hearings, the majority of audience has fallen asleep, counsels appear unresponsive and only the Hot Dog vendor is making trouble, but somehow the room is full of smoke even before the presiding judge re-establishes in his seat - plop  WAR GAVEL SLAMMMMM!!!  the whole courtroom is up in horror while the judge sniffs and tries to determine what distinct odour is messing with his senses before he recognizes the bewildered faces all around  Oh, I'm sorry, didn't realize I still have this in hands. Anyways, my honourable Lead Counsels /u/Kookies4u and /u/Kikool42, I have seen some nice interviews. Unfortunately on TV more about Tebow and the Eagles than in this courtroom. To speed up this situation, let me suggest you call up your further witnesses as well. Each in a single reply though, so we keep somewhat of a track of proceedings. But it will be a nice little chaos for everybody to handle. Let's go!  smacks gavel"

In fact I have two motions.  1st motion is to give reddit gold to the judges, the prosecution and the defense. Yes you heard me. The reason of this is that reddit gold allows you to highlight the new comments you have not read on a thread. It's a very useful feature that I used previously here when I had gold. We would all benefit from it because this thread is going very big. Plus we're doing god's work on this case after all, might as well get some recognition.  Second motion: Motion to allow the defence and the prosecution to each have a private subreddit moderated by the judges so they can talk on their side since PMs can't work properly with so many people."
KarmaCourt,32bmgs,Kikool42,3,Mon Apr 13 22:29:43 2015 UTC,"Objection! One witness has already come forward as having been bribed.  I suggest we ban all monetary donations from the defendant and his team, as they have already been shown to abuse the reddit gold system."

KarmaCourt,32bmgs,Thimotron,4,Tue Apr 14 23:15:49 2015 UTC,"Section 2. Blindfold of article  Lady Justice:       Since the 15th century, Lady Justice has often been depicted wearing a blindfold. The blindfold represents objectivity, in that justice is or should be meted out objectively, without fear or favour, regardless of money, wealth, power, or identity; blind justice and impartiality. The earliest Roman coins depicted Justitia with the sword in one hand and the scale in the other, but with her eyes uncovered.  Justitia was only commonly represented as ""blind"" since about the end of the 15th century. The first known representation of blind Justice is Hans Gieng's 1543 statue on the Gerechtigkeitsbrunnen (Fountain of Justice) in Berne.

Now I've primarily been using reddit on firefox, as recently that became my browser of choice. One day I saw a script that someone made to change the color of the header on the button, that could be pasted into the console. I thought that was really cool, but was annoyed that after every refresh it went away. The next day I see that someone made a chrome extension that did the same thing! I decide to switch over to my old primary browser, chrome, and download that extension. It was glorious, as my header was no longer a bland white, but changed color respectively to each flair color. The next day I see a thread about a malicious plugin, and it listed a few plugins, and I thought, ""wow, I have one of those.. I haven't had a problem with it. That's weird."" So I scroll down through the thread more and saw that it was triggered by date and time. Oh fuck. I immediately go to check my button, and to my dismay... it's been pressed. The crime was committed. I looked at my flair... purple.. I was upset that the decision to press the button was taken from me. However. I woke up this morning to a little surprise. The previous day I had made a sarcastic comment about being purple, and when I woke up, the defendant in this case, had gilded me for the inconvenience I had with the plugin. He made the plugin to have a little fun. It was one troll line of code, and all it did was label me as a filthy disgusting purple. That's all I have to say."

Take the gate off and slide into that little tunnel there until you feel - or see, if you take a flashlight - a way parting to below. Climb down, it has iron bars. Climb to a small platform and then crouch to your left. It's quite a long way there and dirty. You'll end up at another gate to a small room with grey carpentry. When you get in there, push the cover from the lock and make sure you press the button fully. Understood?"

KarmaCourt,32bmgs,red3biggs,5,Sun Apr 12 22:23:18 2015 UTC,"I shall play the role of Olmec, ancient talking statue and court receptionist.  Welcome, jurors. You could start by running to the room of the three bailiffs. Push in the right tongue and a door might lead you down a jury panel into the wall climb. Here, you must choose your next path. You could race up to the court cafeteria, spin the sundial and open the secret door leading to the public restroom of terror. Once there, push down on the hidden faucet to release the floodgates, that may flush you down the drain or lead you into the shrine of the silver monkey. Assemble the justice statue there and you may be headed for the judge's chambers. If the elevator is up, you could run down the hallway, jump into the elevator and descend into the haunted mineshaft of records. You might climb up the ladder in the elevator shaft or plow through the filing cabinets to reach the sacred gargoyle. Find the key and it may unlock the tomb of ancient kings, allowing you to climb into the spider's lair, or it may just set off the sprinkler system. If you escape, you may have a chance to sit upon the throne of the tenth circuit judge. If the correct door is unlocked, you'll be able to crawl into pit of despair and finally make you way through the cave of serpents, back to the parking garage. The choices are yours and yours alone. Good luck!"

KarmaCourt,32bmgs,Professor_Doodles,8,Fri Apr 17 11:03:54 2015 UTC,"Being one of the victims, I feel I should tell what happened.   I was monitoring the button all night waiting to see if it dipped to the 7 red I was waiting for, or if I had to wait a few nights more. I figured that it would still take a while to dip into the red zone constantly so I decided to make my page of /r/thebutton a little prettier with this extension. Since I was using Firefox, I finally decided to cave into my GF nagging of Chrome and use it. I installed it and watching the button because fun, instead of just burning my eyes with the constant white wall of fanatics. It was a good amount of days until the dreaded 11th of April of 2015. I was browsing /r/all when my button monitor started to indicate that it had reached 29s. I knew the time was nearing. I saw that it was my cakeday and I thought I should post something on /r/thebutton indicating my 4 year wait was soon to be over, and that my account would finally serve its function in prolonging the life of the button. That I had decided to leave the Forever Greys and become a future Red. That's when I saw it.  My heart skipped a beat.  A chill ran up my spine.  My 4 years flashed before my eyes.  I was shocked.  I committed sudoku, but being just bytes on a random server, I was ok.  I had become a 60s Purple. I had become what is now known as The 31.  I had been betrayed.  The I chuckled and watched Netflix till my tear ducts dried."

As such he is not a provider of purely authentic laughs, only a conveyor. This sharing behavior can be a good thing but in this very case this caused ruckus and damages to many redditors.

Your honor, people of the court, this here is a classic case of plagarism.png, karmatheif.com and stolenkarma.exe.  /u/skhippy has clearly stolen intelectual property for personal gain. The Defendant clearly paraphrased /u/rubikhan's comment of ""The new Jurassic World trailer"" (Seen in exhibit A), and neglected to credit him for posting the comment. When paraphrasing one must credit the original source.  Also seen in exhibit B /u/skhippy gained almost 10 times the amount of karma on his comment than /u/rubikhan did on his original post.

His argument is invaild for two main reasons. One, /u/KingofKingBananas has forggotten that this case is in reference to the two Redditors, /u/rubikhan and /u/skhippy not random users from Imgur. Two, even if this case included the Imgur users and their posts, /u/KingofKingBananas has posted the wrong Imgur link to support his case.

KarmaCourt,31yc8j,MonkBawb,5,Fri Apr 10 14:40:03 2015 UTC,"Good morning, ladies, gentlemen, and florists. My name is /u/Shawn5pencer, and I am the lead prosecutor for this case here.  Today, we are discussing a serious case - /u/MonkBawb has been charged with Karma Theft, Treason, and Grandtheft.jpg of the first degree.  /u/MonkBawb knew what he was getting into when he saw that_random_potato's post and decided to take his idea and post his own survey. He knew the stakes. But did he take the moment to abide reddiquette and not repost?  The answer is, my friends, simple.  No.  He did bother to be a decent redditor, instead taking the dark path of reposting - a high crime. Now, he has been caught in the act. People of the court - should we pardon this man for a repost?  No, we shouldn't.  /u/MonkBawb didn't admit to the fact that his idea was not-so-original. He could have taken the two seconds to post a comment saying that he was not the first one to do this.  But he didn't. Instead, he reaped in the benefits - namely, rapid karma and reputation gain.  This, ladies and gentlemen and florists of the court, is a prime example of grandtheft.jpg, karma theft, and treason. It should be punished as such.  Thank you."
KarmaCourt,31yc8j,Shawn5pencer,3,Fri Apr 10 17:14:28 2015 UTC,"""/u/MonkBawb knew what he was getting into when he saw that_random_potato's post and decided to take his idea and post his own survey."" Go reread my earlier comment, I had seen no such thing posted.  Compare the two surveys, mine is far different from his, he wanted to know all their religions, mine was made simply to gather data on how many of each person there is who hasn't pressed, has pressed, and a few other variants.  Mr. Potato Head also claimed already his post didn't make it anywhere, it was lost long before he even posted it.  No one saw it."
KarmaCourt,31yc8j,SilverWarrior9,3,Sun Apr 12 01:04:35 2015 UTC,"Objection!  My point here is not that the surveys are too similar, it's that your idea of a survey was not completely original because of /u/that_random_potato's survey being posted earlier.  Sure, his survey may not have been as popular, but it's not like you were the first person to ever make a survey.  That's why you're being charged for Grandtheft.jpg and karma theft - you were praised for the ""original"" idea to start a survey, when other people, including my client /u/that_random_potato, already posted surveys.  You could have pointed that out (which is what you should have done in the name of good reddiquette) but instead, you enjoyed the rewards and compliments.  I rest my case."
KarmaCourt,31yc8j,Stumpy3196,2,Sun Apr 12 16:17:18 2015 UTC,"Objection.  Not once did I claim to have ""enjoyed the rewards and compliments"".  If people want to praise me, that's out of my control.  To charge based on assumptions is unlawful."
KarmaCourt,31yc8j,Thimotron,2,Mon Apr 13 23:30:05 2015 UTC,"You didn't exactly ""claim"" to do it, but you clearly did. Furthermore, it is out of your control, but it wouldn't have been too hard to say that you weren't the first person to create a survey, which you didn't do."

The whole point of reddit is sharing links. The people he ""stole"" from didn't film those gifs, and didn't do the animation themselves. They just found something on the internet and posted it.  That said, it's pretty douchey to repost what's on the front page. At least dig through old posts so you can claim ignorance.

The noble Satan Has been put to blame by supposition and insinuation, And if the defendant truly wishes to use this, it is certainly a grievous fault.   I shall stop my introduction there, for I fear I deviate from the noble Shakespeare's original wit and plot And a passage so witty, should not be twisted further nor forgot.   Satan, as I have come to know of him, is an educator, not the vile character as shown in fiction. Surely, history has embellished his story and made him a prince of evil, and I move that this court should look past references to him and and focus on the Redditor in question.   That said, I consider this case to be a lost cause for a defence. The evidence upon which the charges have been made are already damning, and barring claims to mental health, I see no reason why the Redditor in question should be found not guilty. The evidence presented is conclusive, and damning.   I would like to turn the proceedings over to the defence, at this point, and shall proceed thereafter, Your Honour."
KarmaCourt,31mc4r,ionised,4,Wed Apr 8 03:12:58 2015 UTC,"Your Honor, /u/TheGrandDalaiKarma  First of all thank you all for your patience. I was buried down with papers to write and exams to study for. Now let's get back to where we left our oranges at.  Your Honor, the defence claims that my client is not in his right mind. It seems clear to me and to the people of Karma Court that my client has some severe Reddit Schyzophrenia and therefore he believes that Satan makes him writing comments that make him getting downvoted to oblivion or do crazy things here on Reddit.  Therefore my client was not mentally responsible at the time of the crime and the defence estimates that he cannot be held accountable for this crime he committed. To add onto this, my client is not fit to assist this trial. You can ask him yourself, he will not understand what is the point of this trial and he will not understand what he did was wrong.  Your Honor, charging someone for being crazy is beyond absurdity. We do not prosecute people because they are crazy. Instead, what we do is to bring them to mental health hospital so they can recover and get back on tracks in Reddit. As we say in Canada, when the snow is brown you put in the washing machine. My client thought he was someone else and blames it on Satan. Is this a normal behaviour? I don't think so. It's with no doubt a mental health issue and therefore it cannot be held in a trial. The defence pleads the not mentally responsible status and therefore my client should be sent to /r/psychiatry."
KarmaCourt,31mc4r,Kikool42,2,Fri Apr 10 02:12:45 2015 UTC,"Your honour, /u/TheGrandDalaiKarma  The prosecution settles for a plea to insanity. For the sake of Reddit's greater good, we will settle with the defence that /u/Satan_made_me_do_it should be sent to /r/psychiatry.   The prosecution would also like to move that /u/Satan_made_me_do_it be flaired as mentally unsuited to good conduct (if it is so allowed) until s/he has proven themself fit to be brought before this court again, for the reason that they are likely to appear again due to their condition and cause a repeat proceeding.

This is against our Article VI. on the right to privacy. Plus, someone who is mentally ill is not meant to be highlighted by society but in contrary to be healed in the most discreet ways.

I apologize for my lateness. I shall begin my opening statement.  Your honor, it is apparent that /u/WTF_MEME has karmawhored and claiming content to be his. Searches on karamdecay and evidence from the various exhibits find that not only has he stolen the pictures, but labeled the posts with the same exact titles as the posts /u/WTF_MEME  stole them from. He has also repeatedly tried to defend his stealing and general karma whoring.  He has also stolen from news articles, 9gag, and has claimed a repost to be his. He has committed several acts of karma whoring and claiming things to be his own. Also, as a side comment, it seems that the pokedex in the stolen picture is in the wrong order, as stated by one of the commenters, /u/rfietz. Could the pokemon official clarify?"
KarmaCourt,31itvx,ryansci123,4,Tue Apr 7 16:53:16 2015 UTC,"Ladies and gentlemen, Reddit is, among other things, a content aggregator which means that copying content with the exact same title is not, in fact, stealing but rather providing content. Would he have changed the title, then it would maybe have been stealing if the title referred to it as his own, but no: he simply copied the title. Reddit is a content aggregator, the defendant aggregated content from around the web (including other sub-reddits because obviously he must've thought the post would fit either again or also in another sub-reddit). People like the defendant provide us with content, by the reasoning of the prosecution (stolen from news articles, from 9gag, ect) this would mean that EVERY non-self post here is stealing.  Karma whoring? Maybe. Claiming content to be his? Definitely not, simply using exactly the same title which might have implied ownership before but here is simply good aggregator-ship. Being a dick about it? Being a dick is human, not an offense.  Drop all other charges and we'll admit to the karma-whoring. Win-win."

""How dare you fatshaming my dog""   Also, according to several witnesses, OP (/u/WTF_MEME) also attacked the person who called out the stealing. He reportedly called the person [he's a 30 year old virgin living in his mom's basement].  Looks around. Sits down, and then drinks fermented molasses.

Lots of haphazard excuses about things that are obviously not understood. One thing that stood out was that the bot is apparently based on existing AI, but it never says which, for example.  The source code is touted to being released in   Couple of weeks, maybe a month.   Also known as: after people have forgotten. There's no source code because it doesn't exist.

First I would like to bring to your honour's notice this reliable source article on hearsay. It clearly states that hearsay is inadmissible only if the actual person who made the statement is not available in court otherwise it becomes an in-court statement also there is proof for all of the statements that have been made as provided in the docket.  Second, this is what conjecture is. Your honour, the plaintiff has provided all information that they could possibly have without doxxing the defendant and that evidence shows quite clearly the so called abixbot is not a bot at all and by not being a bot they do not fall under the bot protection act which the defence may or may not try to use next."
KarmaCourt,31eyfz,BruceXavier,2,Fri Apr 10 05:28:03 2015 UTC,"Hearsay:       Hearsay evidence is ""an out-of-court statement introduced to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein."" In certain courts hearsay evidence is inadmissible (the ""Hearsay Evidence Rule"") unless an exception to the Hearsay Rule applies.  For example, to prove Tom was in town, the attorney asks a witness, ""What did Susan tell you about Tom being in town?"" Since the witness' answer will rely on an out-of-court statement that Susan made, Susan is not available for cross-examination, and it is to prove the truth that Tom was in town, it is hearsay. A justification for the objection is that the person who made the statement is not in court and thus is insulated from cross examination. Note, however, that if the attorney asking the same question is trying to prove not the truth of the assertion about Tom being in town but the fact that Susan said the specific words, it may be acceptable. For example, it would be acceptable to ask a witness what Susan told them about Tom in a defamation case against Susan because now the witness is asked about the opposing party's statement that constitutes a verbal act.    The hearsay rule does not exclude the evidence if it is an operative fact. Language of commercial offer and acceptance is also admissible over a hearsay exception because the statements have independent legal significance.

KarmaCourt,318itf,ineededtosaythishere,6,Fri Apr 3 11:07:27 2015 UTC,"Your honor,  The crown believes that /r/trees is guilty of the following four charges:  CHARGE: Possession of illegal substances  CHARGE: Making a whole blackmarket where they can share their pictures of dank for karma  CHARGE: Not sharing their dank with the rest of Reddit  CHARGE: Robbery of a dank subreddit name (Added by /u/GhostOfWhatsIAName[1]  )  Here we are folks, this is a case about the falsified subreddit of /r/trees. When the prosecution first got on Reddit, we were astounded at all the different subreddits, and it was really cool to find more and more, the more subreddits we touched on the more we could explore. One day, we decided we wanted to look at pictures of trees so we literally went to /r/trees and within seconds our pure innocence was gone forever. how do the people of /r/marijuanaenthusiasts feel for losing all their reader base for a little dank? If you type in a subreddit into the bar, then YOU  should get that subreddit, if I type in /r/WTF that means I want /r/WTF not /r/books. This is almost as bad as someone typing in /r/funny to /r/spacedicks, its uncanny and should not be happening.  The defense may say that due to international laws it is not illegal, but all this people posting, have to live somewhere correct? They have to take the pictures somewhere right? Not all of these places that they live, it is legal. Not all people live in Colorado or Washington. In our country, it is illegal. The prosecution definitely understands the medical application for this drug, but if its keeping you alive, why would you take pictures of it? Just because Epi-pens keep people alive does not mean that people make a subreddit to honor this, all people or most here are in fact using the drug  for recreational purposes. The prosecution has lost a few friends to this drug, and while we understand the core idea, it can be very harmful for younger and younger users.   We all can admit, the reddit user base is getting lower and lower in terms of age population. Just like when Call of Duty, because of the age limit, you would expect the age limit to be 18+, but if you ever played call of duty, we know this is not the case, the average we would guesstimate would be around 14. There still may be a lot of older people playing the game, but the younger people are outliers and bring the population average down, and when the younger population sky rockets, the older population becomes the outliers. The same thing is happening to reddit. And when they come on reddit, and want to look at pictures of trees and go to the most ideal subreddit, they lose their innocence, and because of the internet, they are not as experienced with this kind of stuff like most of the people who post here, and they tend to go out of control to look in place with this subs ""dank"". I want you to ponder this your honor. Just because the moderator says that its against the rules, there is obviously nothing to enforce such things. So its like if you torrent a game, there is nothing really stopping you, at most you will get a letter, so people keep doing it. The moderator says its for adults, yet the sub is not 18+, therefore people underaged can still post and be immune, getting into peer pressure that they really don't have any control over.  I still have not talked about the other two charges so lets. for the second charge, /r/trees is a black market, do you know why? Because of these reasons:   Because it is hidden- Anyone who is new to reddit and are an enthusiast don't know where the real party is, because they don't know about /r/trees they can't share their experience. They also get a lot of karma here- If you just view this sub, a lot of karma gets past through here proving the second charge.   The exact definition, is doing illegal stuff behind the governments back, this is illegal in most places, and the internet is ""mostly"" away from the governments wrath.   Other subreddits like /r/marijuanaenthusiasts want people on thier sub as well right? but /r/trees is stealing their mojo. Other subs want a slice as well, but indefinitely are not getting it. the difference between the actual and the hidden is appalling.  The prosecution would also like to say this, most of the drugs shown on this sub is most probably illegal, theirs still not to many places were this in fact legal globally, and no matter the cost, people still post it.  I want you to think about that your honor, thank you."
KarmaCourt,318itf,Navbot,3,Fri Apr 3 14:10:59 2015 UTC,"Your honor,   The defense believes these charges are trumped up and absurd. For clarity, I will be addressing the charges by the order they were given, not by the order the prosecution talked about them.  Charge 1 I purport that this law has no place in this subreddit. To be consistent, the charge of illegal substances should be thrown out. We, as a court solely to do with karma, cannot make judgements on the legality within traditional law. As such, I request that the argument, which the prosecution has devolved into emotional pandering, be struck from the record. If your honor concurs, I believe Navbot should be required to strike through this text. I would prefer a spoiler tag, but I do not believe this subreddit is equipped with such machinery.  Charge 2 This charge is absurd and offensive. r/trees is as hidden as the starbucks down the street. All you need to do is google. Seriously, google “reddit marijuana” and r/trees appears 4th on the list ( at the time of this post).  Furthermore, I contend that any community on this subject requires a glib smoke screen for reputability. Case in point, r/marijuana is obviously a DEA front.  As such, r/trees reflects marijuana in the real world. It is less of a black market, and more of an open secret. Everyone knows people are smokin’ everywhere, and nobody cares. Unless you are black. Then you are probably going to jail. Sorry about that…….. But in any case, this point falls apart. In addition, claiming that this subreddit is somehow criminal because people get karma there is absurd. It is simply a thriving community.  Charge 3 This charge was not addressed by the prosecution. As such, it should be immediately dropped  Charge 4 So earth porn should be used to derive sexual pleasure from pictures of the earth? If this subreddit cannot appreciate satire, then there is no hope for reddit, and we should all go back to digg.  In closing, the prosecution’s arguments are so flawed, they are obviously high. Maybe they should check out r/trees, I hear that is a great community."
KarmaCourt,318itf,Navbot,3,Fri Apr 3 21:59:30 2015 UTC,"Narrows eyes at text while reading,  ""So that is how you want to do things, two can play at that game.""  Your honor,  We decided to go in order, to not to confuse the defense any further then we already have.  Firstly, the prosecution would like to deny the defenses flase accusations that we were apparently ""high"" while we were making our argument, we have never put a cigarette to our mouths, nor do we intend to in the foreseeable future. These calls are completely unprofessional and should be dropped immediately. This does not mean that we do not support such things that we do not take part in such activities.   If the defense truly wants to get technical, this sub reddit /r/karmacourt is all satire, and the ""traditional laws"" is what we actually follow, which is actually true. All the verdicts and convictions here are for mere laughs for people browsing on their time off from work, which is also true. On the contrary, the prosecution believes if we follow the road with technicalities, our whole constitution falls apart, here on this glorious sub. Our constitution states that karma is of worth, but does not say anywhere that traditional laws and laws pertained on karma court cannot coincide with each other. As far as the prosecution is concerned, the first charge is as relevant as any other charges that pertain here on this sub such as ""liarliarpantsonfire"" and ""GrandTheftAuto"".  In the real world this is illegal, and this statement should not be taken lightly.   Lots and lots of stuff is allowed here on the internet,  but that does not mean that it is morally right. There have been also several cases of the National Security Agency getting involved with situations that were in fact ""legal"" by the Internets constitution. In reality, it was illegal, mostly because of were they lived. The National Security Agency gets involved when their citizens get involved in explicated activities that they do not approve of according to the ""traditional laws"", we cannot simply forget them, they are woven into the very fabric of the internet, and our constitution.  We truly don't know where our argument of ""emotional pandering"" existed, it is quite possible that the defense got caught up in another case, because there is no way that this statement is consistent with our argument, that we presented before you. Everything that we said was true, no matter how you would like to look at it, and we see it would be unreasonable to cross such things out as it is important to the case. The sub is publicly displayed as the defense suggest, however does not help their point. What we experience is only just 3% of the internet. The other 97% is the black market, which most people do not know about. Just because it is on the internet and is 97% of it, does not necessarily mean that it is easy to find. The same goes here, calling /r/trees something compared to what it really is about, does indicate that they are in fact trying to hide, although they have not done a very good job.   Here is the exact definition of black markets:  an illegal traffic or trade in officially controlled or scarce commodities.       The illegal part goes back to our first part of our argument as do not feel the need to keep repeating such things any further. Weed is indeed controlled commodity, and the rules change from place to place. The rules do state that they do not allow meetups, yet have no way of controlling if it actually happens. Its like saying to a group of people in a room not to open a box, but have no way to enforce said rule. it just makes them more curious as to whats inside, causing it to happen regardless.  We did state the third charge, but it seems the defense was having somewhat difficulty finding it. It was shown through out our entire argument, you would have to be high to not see it as we mentioned many a times, as it is directly related to the fourth charge.  So earth porn should be used to derive sexual pleasure from pictures of the earth? If this subreddit cannot appreciate satire, then there is no hope for reddit, and we should all go back to digg.   we don't follow, how does this pertain to the case again? oh right, it does not.  /r/trees has been stealing people from their desired sub Reddits, like /r/marijuanaenthusiasts which is 100% true. We are truly at a lost for words at why the defense does not understand, we practically spoon fed this information.  Thank you your honor, and we apologies for the incompetence of the defense."

KarmaCourt,318itf,therndoby,9,Tue Apr 7 01:08:50 2015 UTC,"This is a statement by /u/spinnelein, responding pro se as a moderator on the behalf of /r/trees.   I will address the charges individually and the exhibits described.  IANAL, but I am an endorsed representative of the /r/trees community and modteam, and respond with that station.  Charge 1: Possession of illegal substances:   I posit that the possession or use of marijuana is in violation of neither the reddit terms of service nor international law.  If you take the spurious claim a step forward to the US-centric bias of reddit, the community of /r/trees operates legally. While celebrating the use and culture of responsible marijuana use, the /r/trees community and modteam does not endorse violation of state laws, or the use of marijuana by minors.  As it stands today, the responsible use of marijuana by adults is legal in many states for recreational or medical usage. Therefore, the claim that marijuana or paraphernalia are illegal is entirely spurious and frivolous.  Charge 2: Making a whole blackmarket where they can share their pictures of dank for karma:  Exhibit B points to the /r/trees policy ""Do not ask for hookups or meetups."".  This policy (created and enforced voluntarily by the community moderators) is to discourage the use of /r/trees for black market purposes.   The specific exchange of photos for karma is inherent in the reddit bylaws and is not specific to any subreddit,  and is therefore not subject to judgement by this court.  Charge 3: Not sharing their dank with the rest of Reddit  The /r/trees community is not private, and membership is limited only by the reddit terms of service, international and state law, and a code of anti-douchebaggery which states that it is uncool for kids to come on reddit and talk about smoking weed.   Charge 4: Robbery of a dank subreddit name  Guilty as charged. /r/trees is fucking dank. I would like to enter as evidence a statement by my fellow moderator /u/here_comes_the_king:  “So we gon' smoke a ounce to this  G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this”  The official position of /r/trees is that our mind is on our money and our money is on our mind.  All of the charges posted herein are entirely uncool and should be summarily dismissed."

In the year of our lord, 2015, on the First of April, a great button was summoned before us on /r/theButton (See Ex. A, B, and C).  As the records show, ten minutes after the great administrators of our land published a blog post about a button. The post stated that:   When this post is 10 minutes old, a button and timer will become active at /r/thebutton. The timer will count down from 60 seconds. If the button is pressed the timer will reset to 60 seconds and continue counting down. Only users logged into accounts created before 2015-04-01 can press the button.   The timer has a want, a desire -- a NEED to reach its inevitable state of 'zero'.  The defendants, the button pushers, are accused of, and guilty (if I can strutt my stuff correctly), of taking the very liberties of the non-pressers away!  In 2014, an amendment was added so that bots have equal rights! By pressing this button, and thereby preventing the counter from reaching zero, they are guilty of cruelty!  THUS SAYETH THE PROSECUTION!"
KarmaCourt,313yte,GhostOfWhatsIAName,5,Thu Apr 2 20:31:08 2015 UTC,"raises from his seat at the centre of the courtroom  Ladies and Gentlemen, your honour, appreciators of injustice!  The prosecution would like to make it look as if the defendants are the lone culprits here. They are not. I am here to present you the case of my client, /u/TheButton, a fine and long established user among his peers, as the case of a neutral third party claimant in this trial.  For clarity, I haven't yet pushed the button and do not intend to. But for the case of my client, this does not matter at all. Neither did I press him into court nor will I not push his case forward. His interests are mine for the duration of this trial.  So now we sit here, literally, betwixt and between all stools, fallen into the virtual crack. My client's rights are being violently violated by all sides and from all sides. If I may use this phrase, he's being ""fucked in the ass and mouth"" in the middle of a giant circle jerk.  Thus, my client claims, that the button is merely a misrepresentation of his persona and the parties shall acknowledge such. He solely possesses the rights to chose who and when pushes or presses said representation and who doesn't. None of the parties may choose themselves. Both the party represented by the prosecution and the defendants shall be found guilty of interfering with such rights of my clients. They shall be removed from the subreddit to /r/pressordie and only enter upon summons by my client. Thank you your honour.  bows to the judge and sits"
KarmaCourt,313yte,Tuxmascot,4,Thu Apr 2 21:54:22 2015 UTC,"OBJECTION!  Your honor, the Reddit administrators fully acknowledge the difference between Users and Subreddits. There would be no way for the Defense's Client, /u/TheButton, to have a ""misrepresentation"", as they call it, because the difference is immediately obvious -- one is a user and, the other, is a subreddit.  As I remember, this trial is about the liberties of the non-pressers being violated; not the confusion of a man's ""persona"".  Furthermore, the argument used in this case only furthers the Prosecution's argument, your Honor. If /u/TheButton has every right to decide who presses the button, then the pressers are still violating the non-presser's rights."
KarmaCourt,313yte,xANDREWx12x,4,Thu Apr 2 23:24:54 2015 UTC,"The defense concedes that the prosecution has a point here. While I disagree with the premis of his claim that pressers are violating anything, I do agree that /u/thebutton has nothing to do with this case. Reddit's distinction between users and subreddits is large enough that his claims hold no water in this court of injustice. The defence hereby requests that the court dismiss /u/thebutton's claims.  As for the Prosecution's claims, the Defense would like to point out that, no matter what, the non-pressers will get what they desire. The people that are truly being oppressed here are the pressure, because no matter what happens, they will not get what they want. It is a no-win scenario for the pressers, our efforts will be in vain. It is also important what the button will do when the timer reaches zero. It is a combination of fear of the unknown and curiosity that drives the pressers onward, they are the true victims here."
KarmaCourt,313yte,Carobu,6,Fri Apr 3 07:22:04 2015 UTC,"/u/thebutton's claim is dismissed without prejudice. Should the need arise it may be brought back up should it be found to be relevant. It seems to me that the relevant bit of information here is the time frame of which the zero-timer is reached is at the core here. What is a reasonable time for which the timer should hit zero, and at what point does it become a violation of the non-presser right to not hit zero?"
KarmaCourt,313yte,GhostOfWhatsIAName,2,Fri Apr 3 15:15:09 2015 UTC,"UPJECTION! UPPEEL!  We have not been heard about the court's intention to dismiss the claimant's claims! It would only be silly for this court to decide any matter with hearing the affected party over the dismissive intentions. I also can't get another brush-off from the court in any case. So we request reinstatement on the following grounds:  The prosecution is not trying the defendants in the name of the administeration but the people, especially the non-pushers of reddit. The defendants claim the rights to push not only The Button but also /u/thebutton excessively and prod my client into the role of their saviour. This amounts to responsibility for a group of people my client has not asked for nor otherwise created reason to be brought upon. The administration has regardless of this put this pressure on my client by creating the subreddit and the button.  In addition it was to be expected that many a times would pressers and non-pressers while naming the subreddit mistype it as the username of my client, thus repeatedly summoning him to the subreddit. This not only happens to dumb illiterates, fat fingered mobilists and absent-minded professors but even the smartest most consciously typing grammar-nazis as typographic errors simply are a stock troll technique of modern internet technology.

What happens when I push the button? What will it look like? Will I get something in my Reddit trophy cabinet? Will I save a busload of blind orphans from a horrible, fiery motor accident? The possibilities are endless!  I also believe that the Prosecution is attempting to villainize my defendants. He seems to be projecting them as heartless, horrible people; but in all truth, the pressers are just people who wish to help Redditors worldwide. Because a threat such as the accursed button has never surfaced before, we have no way to deal with it.  Pressers are just people who do not fully trust the button and consider that something bad could happen when the timer reaches zero. They push in order to protect the non-pressers who refuse to protect themselves.  As for unfairness, I would like to call upon the Prosecution's previous statement:   The button is being delayed by the pressers; therefore, it's cruel for the pressers to be preventing the inevitable fate of the said button.   However, is this really ""cruel""? Is it cruel for Redditors who insist on pressing the button, even though they know that the timer will reach zero in the end anyways, to do so because they believe that it matters? No. The pressers are a strong people, a proud people, who only wish to go back to a simpler time, a better time where no unknown buttons pushed their buttons by forcing them to blindly accept a complete enigma in order to reach catharsis."

KarmaCourt,314y5y,Kikool42,3,Fri Apr 3 02:30:36 2015 UTC,"The button pushers, Your Honour, are waging a propaganda war against the glorious non-pusher master-race because they want us to surrender ourselves completely to their sick fantasy of a button controlled world. What do the non-pusher master-race members do? That's where the prosecution tries to shift the blame but the real question should be: what do the button-pushing peasants do? Well, what do they do? Let me start:   They faked a moon landing   What do you think happened to launch the ""rocket"" that supposedly brought Neil Amstrong to space? They pressed a button! They pressed a button! The moon landing never happened, as we all know (proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7pzg9xpAOE), but they simply faked it to get children all over the world pressing buttons to pretend they're launching missiles and placing flags that'd actually wave on the moon. They started a button-pressing frenzy! Not just that, the moon landing had a... COUNT-DOWN before the button was pressed! A COUNT-DOWN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THIS IS ANARCHY!   They did nine-eleven   Did the terrorists do nine-eleven? They did not (proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gp7SDi-lJbU), but is was rather filthy button-pressers who infiltrated the US-government. Why? It's simple: after nine-eleven war was declared and then the war escalated to such a point that several years later drones started to be commonly used. Ladies and gentlemen, how does one launch a rocket from a drone? WITH A COUNT-DOWN AND A BUTTON! A COUNT-DOWN AND A BUTTON! FIRST THE CHILDREN, THEN THE MILITARY! THEY MADE THEM ALL BUTTON-PRESSERS!   They replaced the most important heads-of-state with reptile aliens   Are our heads-of-state still human? No! (Proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbaZpMtXDW0) Then how did these reptile aliens come to earth? BUTTON-PRESSERS! They replaced the non-pressing master-race heads-of-state for reptiles, and those reptiles do what?! THEY PRESS BUTTONS! Think about it: how does Obama use his computer? HE PRESSES BUTTONS! Where are your arguments now deniers!   They founded the illuminati   Is the illuminati real? YES! (proof: http://www.bofads.com/stories/secrets.htm) Why does the illuminati exist? In the past there weren't many buttons yet, but they thought ahead: by founding a secret society then now HUNDREDS of people CLICK AND CLICK to find out more information in the never-ending stream of MIS-INFORMATION! THEY MADE THEMSELVES AND THEN DENIED THEMSELVES TO MAKE US FIND OUT!    They took down a civilian airplane above Ukraine   Think about it: the person who launched the Boek missile, what did he do? HE PRESSED A BUTTON!  Ladies and gentlemen, it's all there: the button-pushers have engineered society through the ages to become a society of pushers and now they want to eradicate their last bit of opposition, but we won't let this happen!

Your honor,  Sorry for the long intro, but I felt it was needed for a case as satiric as this, my cameo was from Halo 2, one of my personal favorite games of all time. now let us get to the   OPENING STATEMENT  It seems we have reached one of the most satiric cases we've personally ever seen. This case is about /u/reddit and his treacherous deeds against the people. His charges are:  CHARGE: APOCALYPTIC-LEVEL SPAM  CHARGE: KARMA WHORING OF THE THIRD DEGREE  CHARGE: WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE ILLUMINATI, LIZARD PEOPLE FROM THE HOLLOW EARTH, THE DEVIL, NORTH KOREA, MECHAHITLER, /u/BUTTPLUGS [1] IN ORDER TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD  we are going to admit that the third charge is going to be the bread and butter of this case, but that does not mean that the other are not as important so to say. I exposed the prophets of their treachery, and I will do the same with the defendant. The defendant, is not trying to set off the rings to destroy all sentient life in the universe, what he has done, is far worse. He plans to take over the UNSC for all they are worth, even the covenant could not accomplish that, how can /u/reddit? The answer is simple, the Illuminati. The Illuminati is one of the most influential group of this decade, everything that we cannot explain, from UFO's to the defendant has to be in league with the Illuminati, they are like the still secret Hydra, in fact, they are probably controlling Hydra right now, that's how powerful they are. The question is not, who is the Illuminati, but who isn't? Here we have a chance, a chance to expose on of their leaders, too foil their plans for at-least a decade. But hey, don't worry, there are other groups we will expose on the way.  THE EVIDENCE AND ANALYSIS   Evidence for Charge 1-  If you view the defendants profile, we can see a tremendous amount of spam, release up to 10-20 posts a day, sometimes in the same sub Reddit. Do you possibly need more evidence here? the answer is quite clear, just plainly viewing the defendants account, you know that he is indeed guilty of said charge.   Evidence for Charge 2- Haha, see what I did there, I'm reusing evidence, sue me. If you view this, you can easily tell that after nine years, of posting spam, his posts karma have added up, 10 here, 17 here, and sometimes he strikes gold (no pun intended) with karma and gets more then 2000 up votes. The defendant is clearly very experienced with the name of the game.  Evidence for Charge 3: Exhibit A, Exhibit B, Exhibit C, Exhibit D- Yes, I did reuse some evidence, again but for good reason. If you view A, we can see that the defendant's account is a whole 9 years old! I don't think anyone else has seen an account this old. The only way this could be remotely possible is that he has to be association with other groups. All his posts make no sense either, what do they mean, it has to be some kind of code. If you view B, they are clearly talking in code, the posts makes no sense, nether does the subreddits name, nether does their comments, they are easily communicating through groups that the defendant has connection to. if you view C, there is another agent, that follows /u/reddit's ways. If there one, hes just a troll, but there are more like him, so we can easily see that there is something bigger at play here, bigger then the you, me or the prophets. If you view D, the US government is catching on to his deeds, and get rid of these organisations, once and for all, before it is too late, and we  want to help. there happens to be a site, where all this goes down called www.reddit.com, and the defendants user name happens to be /u/reddit, coincidence? I think not. there are just too may ""coincidences"" to ignore your honor, too many.  CLAIM   We know that the defense will deny all of this, but consider this your honor, what if the defense is in league with the secret groups? Like we said before, the question isn't, who is the Illuminati but who isn't? These groups have insane resources, I hope you are not one of them too, your honor. We have to expose them to the truth, this is the only way we can survive whats to come in the following years or even months. they will be ready to strike soon, we have to expose them, 4chans already trying, but we have to take take one step further, let Reddit understand whats happening, you can do that, right your honor?"
KarmaCourt,30zyqf,Navbot,5,Sun Apr 5 17:37:03 2015 UTC,"They that have power to hurt and will do none,  That do not do the thing they most do show,  Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,  Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow;  They rightly do inherit heaven's graces  And husband nature's riches from expense;  They are the lords and owners of their faces,  Others but stewards of their excellence.  The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,  Though to itself it only live and die,  But if that flower with base infection meet,  The basest weed out-braves his dignity;   For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;* Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds. *   My apologies too, Your Honor, for this little intro of mine. I felt this Sonnet 94 from Shakespeare was needed because as much as this is a satirical court, this case sounds very poetic to me and I am passionate about Shakespeare. What is the link between the greatest English playwright and my client, would you ask? Well, Many people still don't understand Shakespeare and the actions he did through his words of blood, and many people in this court do not understand the words and the actions of my client as well. Let me first go through the charges as well as the evidences exposed by the prosecution.  CHARGE: APOCALYPTIC-LEVEL SPAM  CHARGE: KARMA WHORING OF THE THIRD DEGREE  Your Honor, if we take a look at (evidence A for Charge I and 2)[https://www.reddit.com/user/reddit], we can observe the post history of /u/reddit. And what's there your Honor? Automatic posts.   The first 22 posts of /u/reddit are automatic threads submitted on /r/trendingsubreddits. These posts go along with the subreddit's rules and principles (showing the trending subreddits). These posts have a ratio of one per day and they always have the same format every single time. Is this a human act Your Honor? Could any decent human being keep the motivation and a will of steel to have such dedication to create posts like this every day and this for a period of 9 years and more? I don't think so Your Honor. This is the beginning of a suspicion that my client is in fact a bot and not a Redditor.  Therefore, is this spam? Spam is the action of posting multiple times to an abusive extent in order to annoy or abuse the target's patience. What my client is doing is not spam. He is doing a public service for a public subreddit at a decent and normal rhythm (1 post per day).  Now for the karma whoring.  Well there is none. The prosecution has brought (this evidence)[https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2u3sqp/reddits_first_transparency_report/] out of their hat. What is it? It's an official post on /r/blog about Reddit. Your Honor, my client has the [A] flair on this post, which tells that the Admins of Reddit allow him to represent them, to make posts and to act as an official public service worker of Reddit. Therefore this is not repost, but once again a public service done well and with no mistake.  To the point  Your Honor, my client is a robot who is working for the Admins of Reddit. Accusing him of plotting with the Illuminati is the equivalent of accusing the Reddit admins to be plotting with the Illuminati. Is that all the respect we have for the Grand Admins, they who created the universe reddit.com and this whole world made of posts and reposts, comments and demands, humor and cutefemalecorpses. This is not the product of the Illuminati Sir. Your Honor, Reddit is the product of freedom and the Admins know it. The only ones who do not have freedom are the bots who serve the community for useful yet redondant tasks.  My client is a bot. Are we seriously going to put a bot on trial? It's non-sense at first sight, but it's also impossible to believe that we can apply a constitution made for human redditors to things that do not have a soul.  Therefore the defence requests the court to dismiss this case as it is not legally possible to put a bot on trial but only their creators (therefore the prosecution would have to remake their case).  Thank you, your Honor."
KarmaCourt,30zyqf,ionised,5,Sun Apr 5 21:14:21 2015 UTC,"Do not go gentle into that good night,   Old age should burn and rage at close of day;   Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  Though wise men at their end know dark is right,   Because their words had forked no lightning they   Do not go gentle into that good night.  Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright   Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,   And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,   Do not go gentle into that good night.  Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight  Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  And you, my father, there on the sad height,   Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray.   Do not go gentle into that good night.   Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  Your honor,   This is one of my most favorite poems of all time, and I felt the need to show it, it was by Dylan Thompson, and it is normally considered one of his best pieces of work. We admit, this case is a losing battle, being that this case is indeed 100 percent satiric, so for our argument this is what we intend to do.   Here is the definition of spam:  disruptive online messages, especially commercial messages posted on a computer network or sent as email.  These messages depending on the viewer could possibly be spam, it all depends on the circumstance, someone on that sub could see his post over and over again and get annoyed, this is 100% a possibility. The defense has no proof that this really is a bot, for all we know, a major organisation is running the defendants account, and has been posting all these to attempt to remain under cover, while we know that this is really not the case. Like we said would happen, would and is denying our evidence like such. These groups have kept the secret hidden for so long. The defendant being a bot is what the defense wants you to believe, your honor. A we have suspected, the defense is also with this group, trying to keep their secrets hidden and from the public, till they are truly ready to strike. As we see it, our ideas are just as probable as the defenses.  No where in the constitution does it say that we cannot try a bot(which we are not saying it is), this account is a user all the same, as I are, as the defense is, and as you are your honor. there is no need to discriminate on here, for true justice comes in all kinds of shapes and sizes.  No where does the charge say ""reposting"", it just says ""karma whoring to the third degree"", which implys hes been getting a lot of karma which is in fact true. You do not need to be reposting for this charge to exist, just be getting a lot of karma, in which the defendant doe have a lot of it, actually 56000 of it.   STEPING ASIDE FROM THE CASE  In truth, we see no reason to make this serious as the defense is implying us to, as this case is mainly for generating humor. If it is meant to remain serious, we see no real reason to try this case, for it does not exist. We mean, for crying out loud, this case was posted on April Fools Day! This case is supposed to be seen as satiric, and should be seen as such. As the rules are stated on our constitution,   ARTICLE IV. KarmaCourt is funny satire  KarmaCourt is purely for the laughs, the cases are the vehicle for funny. We don't like serious arguments, and we don't solve private battles. We only fight for Karma Justice. Participation in the courts must be light-hearted and humorous. The quality of the content in comments and posts in the kourts are moderated by the Justices, who may remove a case if it's dull, stupid, rubbish or generally not entertaining. If it's entertaining it'll be fine. KarmaCourt accepts, and more importantly expects a wide range of styles in the deliveries of the various players. Song is perfectly acceptable, so is 17th century English. So is 17th century spanish, if you can do it and it's entertaining. Normal run of the mill legalese is also tolerated, although an effort must be shown to keep things light-hearted and entertaining at all levels. Let's remember that the accused is not the enemy, and may often whole-heartedly agree with the gravity of their crimes, and may well prefer to join in the fun and satire and general silliness and stupidity.  Whatever decision you willfully come up with with we will accept, but if this case does not follow our constitution we refuse to take any part in it. The choice is yours, either you decide with the defense and you go the serious route, or you go with the constitution and the satiric route like most cases on here. We have been serious in the past, but those were actual serious cases, when this clearly this is not. We are all people, trying to have laughs of from our time of our regular lives, and that is what it should be."

KarmaCourt,30zyqf,ionised,5,Mon Apr 6 02:08:37 2015 UTC,"The Defence maintains that /u/reddit is a bot. His messages are automated plus he's doing public services. This is not spam, as nobody ever complained about his work and the admins publicly admit they use him for various tasks.  Can we condemn a bot for something he's being told to do by the admins? I don't think so.  Yes this subreddit is satirical. However the satirical aspect is only here to keep us smiling and laughing, meanwhile we still aim to win a case. I would like to remind us that this is about argumentation and debating in various atmospheres. Logic and rationality can still have their place in this world of wannabe-lawyers that we live in.  Well at first I didn't catch out this was an April Fool's case. The prosecution admits it's not a real case so I think we should just dismiss it. And if Your Honor you want to still apply a ruling over the charges my client is accused of, with all respects, I can remind you that I provided a reasonable demonstration that the actions of my client on Reddit do not respect the definitions of spam or theft and therefore he is innocent. As for the third charge, it's a joke and for that I'll nod at the prosecution and smile upon their attempt to be fun. nods at the direction of the prosecution.  Thank you Your Honor.

Don't give people the opportunity to change your mind at last minute. As soon as you're decided we should not have the opportunity to change what you think. It's also faster.  Your Honor, please don't leave us hanging. It's like coming into a bakery shop and telling the baker ""I would like something. I know what I want."" and in the end the baker doesn't know what you want. It's just insane and time consuming.  The way it works here is both sides make their opening statements, then we debate and the judge stops us when he has a decision made and when he thinks the trial is over.  So please Your Honor, let us know the end of this suspense!  P.S: No offense though, it's just to let you know how it usually goes."

It's against vault security regulations, and those guys don't care if I own the vault, they just follow the rules. So yup, not so simple sounding now right? Listen, I need another Diet Coke. Goblins never suck their own dicks, unless it just feels right. Then they might. But they might be doing that anyway. Just like doing anyway go distant sounding waves."

KarmaCourt,30st2y,Navbot,3,Tue Mar 31 00:21:23 2015 UTC,"Ladies and gentlemen of the court, sincerest apologies for the delay. /r/outside has been set to hard mode the last few days.  However, before we become too far detached from this case to come to a fair conclusion, I shall make my closing statement so that the judge may bring this to its due conclusion.  Friends of the court, in the same way that Johanne S. Bach was inspired by Corelli, and that Claude Monet was inspired by Eugene Boudin, so was the defendant inspired by the artwork he found.   He did not copy it, as did not Bach copy Corelli, but indeed in the same fashion that Bach did utilize much or Corelli's work in his own compositions, the defendant utilized some inspiring artwork to create a composition of his own.  So truly I say to you know, my client is not guilty. In fact, he is far from it! Indeed, we should not be prosecuting this redditor, but praising him for taking his inspiration to the extent of creating his own valued OC.  I do believe that you all shall see this easily, and that a fair judgement shall be made.   The defense rests, most honourable Jarl."
KarmaCourt,30st2y,Dasbaus,2,Sun Apr 5 22:08:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you, should I consult with the juror first, or should I just make my verdict?"
KarmaCourt,30st2y,mattyisphtty,3,Sun Apr 5 22:50:38 2015 UTC,"You're the judge man its up to you. Since there is only one juror there isn't really a jury to make a verdict, but you can consult then if you want. Or just make a verdict, whatever."
KarmaCourt,30st2y,Quantum_Dranger,2,Sun Apr 5 23:03:50 2015 UTC,"Alright boys here is the verdict:  For the Charge:GrandTheft.jpg:  GUILTY  I fully understand the defenses point of view, we are all entitled to a little bit of creative license, but here that is not the case. If you view the prosecutions Exhibit A, the work of art is copyrighted, and deviantart is clear about their copy right policies. because it is original, and is not 150 years old, it is automatically copyrighted, and their copyright infringement policies state that even if you modify the picture, you still need permission from the original artist to do use it.

KarmaCourt,30st2y,Navbot,6,Tue Mar 31 16:14:00 2015 UTC,"Brethren of ye court, lend me thine ears to hear that word of justice!  Most honourable Jarl and patronage of ye court, hear thee this!  Say thee that all evidence supports the prosecution? Ha! Forsooth it doth not! I say thee, quite the contrary.   Thou wouldst see, what we have here is an artist seeing an artwork, being inspired in its glorious workmanship, and then creating artwork of his own similar to that which he saw, but with his own work, his own flair, and his own taste. It be not plagiarism in any shape!  Ye definition of Artistic license is so:  ""artistic license noun the freedom to create an artwork, musical work, or piece of writing based on the artist's interpretation and mainly      for effect; also called poetic license, etc.""  So therefore, companions of Justice, here we have nothing out of the ordinary. Nothing, that is to say, other than an over-eager plaintiff who seeks false justice.   Verily, I prithee see that this be so."

KarmaCourt,30fct7,Thimoteus,12,Fri Mar 27 08:04:05 2015 UTC,"Your honor, I don't try many cases nowadays.Why did I take this one? The answer is simple: because this is a textbook case of LiarLiarPantsOnFire.  To the gullible eye, the defendant's story is plausible. But once you start to think about it, it all unravels like a ball of string you used once for a project that one time, but not all of it, and tried to wrap it all back together but you didn't do it as well so now it's just kind of a lump of string in a drawer somewhere.  Any reasonable reading of the defendant's title will understand their intention was to take a panoramic shot of their living room, with the unintended side-effect of an elongated cat appearing (myseriously!) front and center in the photograph.  This sounds an awful lot like another well-known swindling of the public trust: pictures of ghosts!.  Similarly to the defendant's picture, this photo (and many others like it) ostensibly that the intention of photographing a set of stairs with the unintended side-effect of capturing a ghost, front and center! Like the cat in the defendant's photo, the ghost steals the story here.  Now we have to ask ourselves: why the hell did the photographer decide to take this photo in the first place?  Photos of your living room/stairs aren't normal! Nobody does this! People take pictures of themselves, their friends, their family, their food, themselves, but they don't take pictures of their living room!  The obvious explanation is that the intention was to create this cat monstrosity all along, and the defendant's tragically, criminally misleading title is tantamount to a betrayal of reddit's good will.  Your honor, I hope you find it within yourself to see past all the bullshit and convict the defendant for what he is: a no-good karma-grubbin' cheatin' scumbag liar."
KarmaCourt,30fct7,Professor_Doodles,6,Sat Mar 28 00:14:15 2015 UTC,"Ladies and gentlemen of the court, here we have a classic, textbook case of a misunderstanding and getting ahead of ourselves in the name of justice.   Firstly, let us look at the post in question, what is it?  It is a picture taken of a living room, in which a cat was tracked across the room to make it appear that the cat was longer (as long cat is indeed long) that it actually is. This, of course, was for comedic effect and entirely intentional.   Now we have our plaintiff, who has filed this case to shed a distasteful look on OP, who has received the several similar criticisms from the comment section on his post.  Now in order for justice to truly be served in this case we must look at the basic facts here.   What has happened?  The defendant has posted a picture with several claims attached to it, and these claims are as follows:  -That he took a picture of his living room, and -that his cat walked through it  Well, as we have it, we can see that in the picture:  -That he took a picture of his living room, and -that his cat walked through it.  So ladies and gentlemen, your honour, here we have a simple case of dishonour being thrust on an honest man trying to make a little karma with some of his own OC. No claim has been made by OP that was not met by his post, and nothing has been inferred that is not so.  I trust and plead that you all will see this simple fact and that you will proceed accordingly.  The defense stands for the prosecution's cross-examination."
KarmaCourt,30fct7,thatguywithapencil,3,Sat Mar 28 02:17:11 2015 UTC,"A good point, may i ask what was so intresting about his living room that he needed to take a picture. It looks like a pretty normal living room to be.Had this been posted on /r/mildlyinteresting one might think of it differently.Based on my good judgment i see op as a lying shit."
KarmaCourt,30fct7,Professor_Doodles,5,Sat Mar 28 17:38:34 2015 UTC,"Well your honor, as I said, this picture is a picture of a living room with a cat in it, the part about the picture that makes it interesting however would be the cat. The cat, which is walking through the picture, is the focal point of the living room photo. However the reason, presumably, that OP decided the picture was interesting enough to post the picture would be the cat.   However he has not lied about anything, he posted a picture with a title which the photograph lived up to. He has made no claim which was not met by the photograph, I say you must see that your honor!"
KarmaCourt,30fct7,thatguywithapencil,3,Sun Mar 29 13:58:39 2015 UTC,Yes I do agree with you   May the prosecuter /u/Thimoteus present his case
KarmaCourt,30fct7,Thimoteus,3,Sun Mar 29 14:06:13 2015 UTC,"Your honor, the defense is hoping you're too dumb to see past a very crucial point, which he has conveniently skipped over.But I know you won't be fooled. See, the operative word  in the defendant's title is ""But."" As you're well aware, ""but"" is used as a conjunction when what follows takes a different turn from the rest of the sentence.  Let me illustrate: A) ""The defendant was being a lying sack of shit, but didn't get away with it."" B) ""The defendant was being a lying sack of shit, and didn't get away with it.""  Clearly A) sounds more natural. The use of ""but"" primes us to expect that the defendant didn't get away with his lying treachery.  Likewise, the defendant's use of ""but"" primes us to believe the cat is somehow ""interrupting"" the picture, as if it isn't supposed to be there. Now, the defense holds that their client is an honest man. If that's so, then the defendant didn't expect the cat to walk through the picture. But it did. Therefore, he is a lying sack of shit. And you, your honor, will not be fooled otherwise."

We should first ask ourselves: was this really intended? Or was it just an accident, just like bumping a moose with your Canadian friend's car?  In this case, we can clearly see that this is no accident. Unfortunately for Sir /u/sarmatae, we have here a proof that not only did he attacked /u/Spooky_Ghost_AMA with   ""[...]edges so sharp they were like rusty razor blades.""   but also that he was waiting in a dark corner for his victim to walk right in his trap.  Your honor, the prosecution charges /u/sarmatae with premeditated assault with Sharp Edges.  Edit: Corrected some typos, sorry"
KarmaCourt,307fny,LookAdolfin,1 point,Thu Mar 26 12:36:14 2015 UTC,charge edited.
KarmaCourt,307fny,mrdeath799,1 point,Thu Mar 26 12:41:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you, your honor. As the case currently stands, there is no significant evidence to prove any involvement with:  That severed arm and /u/Spooky_Ghost_AMA.  A pointy edge and /u/sarmatae.  I, as a (self-)certified professor of law and stuff, do declare that in the absence of evidence, /u/sarmatae is completely and totally innocent. The arm in question shows no real significance to the case as it cannot be proven to belong to /u/Spooky_Ghost_AMA. That could be any arm from any being, flesh or plastic (or maybe even rubber). Unless further evidence may be shown to prove /u/Spooky_Ghost_AMA ‘s loss of said arm, it cannot be used as an argumentative point. Furthermore, on the topic of points, /u/sarmatae did not display any signs of sharp edges in his post. He did, however, present a sarcastic piece of humor with comparison between America’s and Germany’s involvement in Polish conflict. Sarcasm is defined as “the use of irony to mock or convey contempt” by (Google-based) researchers. The definition of sarcasm applies to /u/sarmatae ‘s post. However, /u/sarmatae ‘s post does not fit an example of a sharp edge.   “Sharp” is defined as “having an edge or point that is able to cut or pierce something” by these same renowned researchers. “Edge” is defined as “the outside limit of an object, area, or surface; a place or part farthest away from the center of something” by the Google-researchers and as a professional wrestler by /r/SquaredCircle. Thus, a sharp edge is either an outside limit of an object that is able to cut or pierce something, or a professional wrestler that is able to cut or pierce something.   He must either be a knife, or Edge. He, logically, cannot be a knife as no knife is known to have the ability to type on a keyboard (or link images, for that matter) or have knowledge of Nazi Germany. /u/sarmatae also has next to no chance of being Edge. Studies show there are 7 billion living people on Earth. This means that /u/sarmatae has about a 1/7,000,000,000 chance of being Edge. I believe that a 1/7,000,000,000 chance of being guilty of the charges is not enough to convict at all. Your honor, /u/sarmatae is most definitely not a knife and has a miniscule chance of being pro wrestler Edge. There is no way he could have attacked the Plaintiff."
KarmaCourt,307fny,LookAdolfin,1 point,Thu Mar 26 13:32:40 2015 UTC,"Objection,  Since the arm in question is in /u/Spooky_Ghost_AMA 's post, and since not a single ghost as ever been reported to be able to take people arms and bring them in their posts, le-dit arm simply can't be from another source than the plaintiff.   Also, I'd like to redefine ""Sharp,"" which means, as my physics book tells me,   ""La capacité d'un matériau à séparer les molécules sans se déformer"" [A material's capacity to split molecules without modifying his own structure]""   In that case, with a total 1627 comment karma (sorry for the foreign language), while a lot of his comments have more downvotes than upvotes, we can say that /u/sarmatae is a very controversial figure, meaning he splits opinions.  Therefore, since /u/sarmatae splits molecules (Redditors' opinions), and doesn't seems to modify his very own structure (he keeps doing it over and over again), he can be qualified as ""Sharp.""  On another point, since every single human is different from the others, we can say that every one is the edge of humanity, except for Louis XIV, which called himself the Roi-Soleil or Sun King, meaning he was at the center of the known universe. With an estimated number of 107,602,707,791 humans borned in the whole history, that leaves us with a 1/107,602,707,791 for him not being an edge. Adding to this that Louis XIV died September 1st ,1715, which is roughly 300 years ago, we can reasonnably say that /u/sarmatae is an edge.   He is sharp. He is an edge. He is a sharp edge.   The arm is clearly /u/Spooky_Ghost_AMA 's.  Coincidence? I stopped believing in those when I was 3 (I'm 5)."
KarmaCourt,307fny,mrdeath799,1 point,Thu Mar 26 15:10:03 2015 UTC,"Perhaps he is sharp, but my client, as you have stated, splits opinions very easily. Technically, opinions are built of thoughts, which are consciousness, which is considered abstract and may not even be matter, let alone molecules. In regards to being an edge, he seems, through his 'controversial' post history to be very self-centered and most definitely not an edge.  While ghosts may never have brought severed arms into court cases before, a certain Lorgren Benirus has brought severed hands into a situation before. When his hands are returned to his body, he becomes a Lich and a minor boss fight ensues. There may not be a precedent to a ghost bringing an arm into a court case, but I've not heard of a court case involving a European man (allegedly) cutting off the arm of a ghost, either.  The defense would also like to make it clear that the Google-based definitions of the words ""sharp"" and ""edge"" were provided by the Oxford dictionary."

This is the  TRIAL THREAD  The prosecutor /u/Juhuatai  may open when ready.  VERDICT  Well this is a doozy. On the one hand the defendant seems to have deleted their account at a very convenient time. On the other hand, I hate to see justice hornswoggled.  On the charge of ""Bullshitting for Karma"", I find the defendant: GUILTY. Apparently reasonable doubt is the ""in"" thing right now in Judge Weekly, and I have to say the suggestion that the two events were years apart doesn't seem likely based on how closely the posts were made to each other.  On the charge of ""Too many posts about animals"", I find the defendant: NOT GUILTY. If making too many posts about animals was punishable, where would I go to see animals being bros? Outside to the dog park which is just 100m away from where I live? BAH! TOO FAR, I SAY!  SENTENCING: I sentence the defendant to eat a taco with the world's spiciest salsa, where the taco is shaped like a bird-feeder, while the defendant is inside a taco bell which is itself shaped like a taco that's shaped like a bird feeder. But since the defendant is gone from reddit, this sentence will not apply until such a time as he comes back.  COURT IS ADJOURNED  Now go read the KCB!"
KarmaCourt,302c34,Thimoteus,25,Mon Mar 23 23:26:19 2015 UTC,"Pretty straightforward your honor. The defendant is completely full of bullshit. Exhibit A states that the defendant's neighbor's child eats and drinks out of his bird feeders. His response was one of shock that a child would do such a thing. Exhibit B states that the defendant's neighbor poisons the said bird feeders. It is possible, unlikely but possible, that the neighbor does not know his child is eating out of the bird feeder. Nevertheless, the OP does not show any shock that the child may die. This would be an absurd reaction if both exhibits are true. Thus I rest my case that the OP is completely full of shit. Why would he not care about the potential death of a child? If he can answer this question, I'll stop prosecuting."

Everyone knows that OP's are bundles of sticks unless proven otherwise. That's what I'm going to do damn it. Who is to say that the two posts both occur in the same time frame? Seeing the bird feeder being tainted with may have triggered a memory from years in the past. The order in which the posts were submitted does not matter. My client clearly thought the awkward seal meme would be liked more than the recent one.   Perhaps my client does not worry for the child's safety because this neighbor is the same in both instances. Though a tad cold, OP takes his revenge by letting the child get sick. This could also be why this is so awkward.   Pulling wildcard, and calling a humming bird to the stand."

KarmaCourt,2zy9fi,notarapist72,16,Mon Mar 23 17:37:38 2015 UTC,"Rolls up sleeves.  Your honor, dear members of the jury, Mothers, Dads, and other fellow Redditors,  We are gathered here for the union of a happy couple to repress the outrageous and overly disrespectful behavior of /u/GolfingGator who not only abused the openness, weaknesses, kindness and naivety of the any respectable Redditor of /r/askreddit, he deliberately trespassed the screens of hundreds, if not thousands, of users to make them pass as fools in front of their relatives and in-real-life acquaintances. It has been recognized on Reddit that textual foolishness is acceptable and laughed upon. However, tricking families and sons beyond the virtual world in such an unpredictable way is an abuse of the naivety of the Reddit people (which is to accept to a certain extent the truthfulness and worthness of any saying on Reddit).  /u/GolfingGator managed to make THOUSANDS of MOMS, DADS, and CHILDREN look as fools, idiots, and more. The most touching sequel is probably this comment from /u/Emerald_Triangle who, I cite, says:  ""My mom was murdered by my father a few years ago. I have not gotten her anything, and I have forgotten when exactly mother's day is. (I do think about her all the time though) So, if you have a decent parent or parents - tell them you love them and what you appreciate about them"" -/u/Emerald_Triangle  In his attempt of trolling, /u/GolfingGator has created a TSUNAMI of feels (feelings) in /r/askreddit and in this post more precisely. People were running back and fourth, not knowing where to hide, to escape from all the feels. People called, told their moms they loved them, Moms punished their children because they thought they were forgotten, and so on. /u/GolfingGator has played in a cold-blooded way with the feelings and the hearts of the people of Reddit.  AND FOR WHAT? YES! FOR WHAT?  14x Golds. /u/GolfingGator has received 14x Gold as of March 22nd at 23:00 (East Time), and beyond 3600 upvotes. He has deliberately deleted his post to erease his prints and traces, therefore it is not possible to see the Golds gilded anymore. However, it is inscribed on his profile that he has been gilded today. I also have witnesses (as well as my eyes, thank God) to testify this fact. And now I am standing in front of you, Your Honor, as well as you, my little lads, to ask you the following question:  To be or not to be ?  Is it fair to earn 14 Golds, ~3600 upvotes, by playing with people's feelings and fool them against their will and and about one of the most sacred days of the year, which is Mother's Days ?  No. The answer is No (and 42 on my exam sheet). This is disrespectful and it hurts like Charlie Bite Me.  Therefore, the prosecution demands nothing less than a 48 hours commitment of forced labour (Browsing) in a subreddit of a foreign country (and in that country's language), preferably http://www.reddit.com/r/ru .

There is no reason anyone should want to have OP punished for this humorous post to /r/AskReddit. Let us find the defendant to be not guilty."

This post is actually quite humorous, and generally an all round good post that we would like to see. The problem with this you may ask? The defendant stole it.  Exhibit A - Here is the post that the defendant stole.  Exhibit B- Here is the evidence that this post was in fact stolen, his friend if he found out would be completely outraged that his humorous picture is forever stolen, therefore losing his ability to ever use it again, all his friends will think he was the one stolen it which is not the case.  Exhibit C - Here is the proof that the the defendant did steal it, see that the date of the original post is before the defendants, proving that he stole it.  Exhibit D-The defendant was arguing and making witty comments trying  to prove that the stylus was in fact his, which it wasn't. This proves theMFingDeception.GIF and LiarLiarPantsonFire charges. There is other evidence proving these charges, but it would be too much hassle to link them all.  Exhibit E- Here are the TIFU rules, here we can see that the defendant is in direct violation of Rule #1   Rule 1: All fuck-ups must be original and be yours   this is a major crime that should be dealt with the highest punishment that we can offer here on reddit.  Exhibit F- to top it off, the defendant has even pleaded guilty, proving that he did in fact commit all of these charges.  Your honor, this is a clear case if we've ever seen one."
KarmaCourt,2zukjv,Navbot,3,Mon Mar 23 23:28:26 2015 UTC,"Rolls up sleeves  Your Honor, I believe this case is in contrary over estimated and my client is here being accused of something that is not as horrible as it looks. In fact, I will not use all of Rome's paths and I'll take the Route 101: my client is innocent due to the lack consistency in the proofs brought by the prosecution. Let me develop on the evidences brought forward by the prosecution.  First off, the prosecution is making up a story that can be turned upside down from A to Z. In fact, nothing in the evidences B and C proves that my client did steal it. Yes, the date of the post does not concur with the date of the Tweet but what if my client is really the owner of this picture? What if he did in fact take this picture, posted it on Tweeter a year ago, then discovered Reddit 6 months prior to the post (his account is 6 months old) and happened to walk by /r/showerthought ? My client could have taken a shower and rethought about this new outstanding place he found which is Reddit. We all know what it feels to be under the shower and think back about what should have been done or said earlier. As everyone who has ever taken a shower, my client realized he should have posted that picture over there, not to collect benefits but to gain compensation and self-reward (also called as Karma, don't we all forget what it's there for) to comfort him in his failed test. Therefore, he decided to catch up the time he lost and as the saying goes in Canada, it is never too late to poke the bear with the stick before you score against the Canucks.  Your honor and your seven dwarfs jurors, nothing proves that my client did not take the pictures.   As for Exhibit D, let me cite the prosecution:   The defendant was arguing and making witty comments trying to prove that the stylus was in fact his, which it wasn't.   First off, there is no trace anymore. All I see is a deleted comment. No screenshot, nothing. This is not a valid proof as this comment could have been anyone else's comment. Secondly, the prosecutor made a defamation your honor. He said something with no proof. He is doing a sophistic assumption which in Canada is calling the bear a moose before you saw it. This is not acceptable.  Lastly, I would like to call a motion to dismiss Exhibition F as my client did it when he was in shock right after he saw he was convicted to a trial in KarmaCourt. Remember, he is 6 months old. He is new and therefore is not accustomed to aim his gun at somewhere else than his foot (you know, shooting yourself in the foot... alright this one was hard to make). He did not have a lawyer when he made this statement and was overwhelmed by all the false accusations done wrongly on him. To add the cherry on the Sundae morning, my client did not explicitly nor exactly said what he admitted. He might have just admitted he created the post, maybe he slept with his friend's chiuhaha, perhaps he admitted he did take the picture in November 2014, perhaps he admitted he masturbated while watching the Traviata ?? Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps !!!! Too many doubts your honor, and yet so little affirmations based on solid grounds from the prosecution. All I can see here is an accusation with no grounds but only assumptions. Is that what the justice system has come to nowadays your honor? A system of assumptions and no straight proofs? I doubt so. Karma is something Buddhists don't play with, and nor do I play with the Buddhists.  To conclude my time, I would like to talk about exhibit E aka the Rules of /r/TIFU. Let me cite for all of us, including the prosecution, the rule 1.a)   Rule 1: All fuck-ups must be original and be yours. This rule has several parts. 1a. Your fuck-up doesn't need to be from today.   If my story makes sense, and I am as sure it is as a mosquito trapped in a blood donation center, my client was in his right to post this TIFU story even though the post is dated from November 14th, 2014, as no where in the rules it is precised the date expiration of a TIFU.  Now, if you do the maths correctly, you end up with the following Too Long Did Not Read: Nothing proves that my client committed a crime by taking a picture that can be assumed to be his own and by posting it even though the photo is a year old.  Your Honor, people of Karma Court, I hope you will understand that my client has been wrongly done.   The defence would like to claim the following compensation to comfort my client in his horrible journey: the freedom to repost his TIFU, with the picture, with the words of his choice. The defence also wants to make a motion to condemn /u/GhostOfWhatsIAName to a sentence of 72 hours of browsing in /r/UnitedKingdom so he can learn how to behave well in a court and stop swearing so much when opening a case.  Thank you for reading Your Honor. Once again, you have nice shoes.  Sits back, drinks orange juice, rolls back his sleeves."
KarmaCourt,2zukjv,Kikool42,2,Tue Mar 24 02:09:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you both. And may I remind the Defense that if he spills any of that orange juice on my carpet, he will have to clean it out. Because this is how we get ants, people. But I digress: Prosecution, do you have any witnesses?"

KarmaCourt,2zukjv,Kikool42,1 point,Tue Mar 24 02:56:12 2015 UTC,"Narrows eyes at defense and clears throat  ""Flattery will get you no where, especially with justice on its tail""  Your honor,  The prosecution believes all the evidence that it has presented you with is of merit in this case against the defendant, and is not as the defense says.  First off, the defense is making very vague assumptions of the defendant and his thought process. These assumptions carry absolutely no merit in this case. Perhaps the prosecution is actually an alien life form form another planet that traveled back from time? what if? anything is possible. To this the prosecution presents the outstanding  OCCAM'S RAZOR   It's exact definition is:   When faced with competing hypotheses, select the one that makes the fewest assumptions. Do not multiply necessities without good reason   Is the prosecution really an advanced alien species form the future? Or a ordinary human being that believes in true justice? We truly don't know but using Occam's razor, being a ordinary human is more probable.  This has been used for quite sometime to disprove any outlandish ideas that have come up over the years, without the knowledge that it is actually true. Out of the two ideas that it was, is it the defendants picture and he lied about being guilty and he reposted it himself? Or is it that he was telling the truth and he did? If someone in a murder trial admitted to guilt, you still don't know if he actually did it, but if we use Occam's razor, the most probable answer is that he did do it. Who would in there right mind would to jail for life if they did not do it?  The defense says that there is no evidence of the defendant saying it was his. the prosecution would like to present you with this evidence:  /u/GhostOfWhatsIAName[24]    /u/pm_me_your_silver[25]    /u/Def0nze[26]    /u/Cyae1[27]    /u/chubchubs127  All the witness of the Event that took place, that the defense says that the evidence that could not be ""proved"". Here we can know what really happened. With this the crown can prove that the defendant truly did commit the crimes, we can also see that based on the reply's that the defendant received we can make a generalization of his comment, if the defendant responded with a nice comment, he would of obviously good nice reply's back, which was not the case.  The prosecution does not enjoy the defenses use of different religious remarks that could be seen as hate. The defense is being a hypocrite in says that our client is being rude, while he is using hate remarks that could be even hurtful and disturbing.  If we go back to Occam's razor, we can clearly see that the most probable answer is that he did indeed re-post this and is telling the truth. Why would the defendant just admit the charges when he had right for legal representation? Occam's razor says what the defense was saying is not true at all."
KarmaCourt,2zukjv,Navbot,1 point,Tue Mar 24 03:01:09 2015 UTC,"Narrows eyes at orange juice, clears nose  Your Honor, the prosecution forgets that their job is to prove that the accused is guilty. I cite the constitution: ""The burden of proof resides with the prosecution, they have to prove the defendant guilty."" How can the prosecution convince us all that my client is guilty if their proofs do not stand up on nothing else but on a pillar of sand? All I am doing here is to demonstrate by A + B that the arguments are not valid and the story of the prosecution is made up, or that there could be at least another version of it.  Now regarding the OCCAM'S RAZOR, what the hell is this way of thinking? In a fair trial, you have to explore all possibilities in order to make sure you do not avoid or forget anything that could cause a biased ruling or a wrong decision. In the legal system, you do not push away some assumptions like that. The American Justice System states that anyone is innocent until proven guilty. All I have said is that the prosecution's proofs don't align. They just don't stand up. I presented to the court a version of the facts that works out much better than the accusatory one provided by the prosecution. My client did not steal this picture, and profited from his coming out in the Reddit world to share fun, emotions of high interest, pleasure and laughs with the community of Reddit, especially the /r/TIFU one.  Now regarding my client's confession, he did what we call in Forensic Psychology a Coerced-Internalized False Confession. Because of all the accusations and his little experience in Reddit, he began to believe he committed the crime and made a false confession under the shock and due to his anxiety. I can bring to the court an expert witness to confirm that my client has some severe anxiety issues that can affect him in his judgement.  The prosecution can bring in their witnesses but the defence will expressly ask for logs and quotes from the thread, as the witness might be subject to missrecall of the facts, and their memory accuracy might be decreased due to a wrong manipulation of the system variables (forensic psychology again).  I also demand the prosecution to find another way to conter-argue against the facts provided by the defence because in court we simply do not ignore a hypothesis under the excuse that it would cause too much trouble to solve. This is being far more than hypocrite."

KarmaCourt,2zukjv,Kikool42,0,Wed Mar 25 05:11:27 2015 UTC,"EDITED  Your honor, the prosecution has forgot nothing, the defense does not seem to understand.  All the evidence that we already present you with, all the facts all the evidence that the defendant did in fact do this case. What there is not, is evidence for the defense to back up their vague assumptions and ideals that have no place here in this court. All the things the defense says cannot be proven can be shown by the witnesses. We can follow what we do know, exactly what the defense was saying, this person did in fact steal this post from some other account.   We do not know if they are the same person but the defense is pulling this information out of his hat, where's his evidence? We have already presented ours.  In case you did not know, William Occam was born in 1287 and was a English Franciscan friar and scholastic philosopher and theologian. His ideas are still followed today. which mean something. The defense thinks that you can disprove ideas that have been proven by countless scientists and been around for centuries. The prosecution laughs at the defense. to argue this is to disrupt the very shaking and foundations that our scientific constitution is founded on, if we get rid of this, we may as well go back to the stone age. Can we prove that mass can move to the speed of light? No we cant but we can rule it out with equations and ideas that brings this to be.   In response to the defenses plea of what was actually going through the defendants head, is just more assumptions that the defense cannot back up, this is appalling how the defense thinks that they can bring up ideas without the proper back up. Just because he used big words does not cover up that the defense carries no facts.  There is absolutely no evidence that the defense uses, he seemingly pulls it all out of his mythical hat. The defense is being WAY MORE THEN A HYPOCRITE.  We want the defense to show us the evidence that what the defense is saying carries merit, otherwise he should drop these outlandish proposals right away.  With the evidence we can clearly see that the defendant commit the crimes."

KarmaCourt,2zukjv,Navbot,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:58:46 2015 UTC,"Dear Honor, the prosecution needs to stop banging its head on a wall.  I have demonstrated logically that their story does not add up. My client could have taken the picture and posted it later on Reddit. Nothing bounds him to post the picture in a certain time laps following the time he took it.  My client took this picture on November 5th 2014, posted on Tweeter. He then found Reddit six months ago, and decided to post it back (with respect to the rules of the /r/TIFU, which state that **there is no time limit to post a TIFU).  It completely makes sense to me that my client deleted his involvement as much as possible on this post. The Tweeter account's name has been brought up on the public place (visible by hundreds of people per day). If the Tweeter account is in fact his, he could have deleted the post in order to not have his relatives, followers or anyone else make the link between his reddit posts and his tweeter activity. This adds up to the fact that my client commented on this case saying he pleaded guilty because of the anxiety that we could find a relationship between his Reddit history and his Tweeter activity as well.  By respect to my client, who has already said too much, under the stress and anxiety, and who wants to get away with this false accusation, I do not have any screenshot, conversation log, or anything that proves that the Tweeter account is in fact his. However the difference between my version of the facts and the prosecution's is that I'm acknowledging that there is the possibility that he is innocent. Because there is no empirical evidence that he his innocent does not mean he is not.  What else differs from my statement and the prosecution's ? Well, the prosecution does not manage to make the link between the Tweeter account and the Reddit account, /u/AvergelyGreat. Therefore this means there is still the possibility of doubt and the prosecution fails to prove under no doubt that my client is guilty.  Now, let me ask you this Your Honor, should we really punish someone because we doubt this content is in fact his? The anger of the plaintiff stands on a doubt and what is a doubt but a simple struggle to wake up in the morning between what can be true and what can't ? The laws do not stand upon sand Sir. The laws are based on actual facts with nothing that can twist them otherwise. The defence will be ready to admit a failure if there is in fact the link between the Reddit account in question and the Tweeter account. However, according to Article VI. 7. the defendant has the right to keep his privacy safe and untouched (including social media activity) and therefore this link cannot be established.   In response to the defenses plea of what was actually going through the defendants head, is just more assumptions that the defense cannot back up, this is appalling how the defense thinks that they can bring up ideas without the proper back up. Just because he used big words does not cover up that the defense carries no facts.   Well, the defence would like to bring an expert witness to the bar then. This is forensic psychology, a field of psychology that exists for real (I'm taking a forensic psych' course, I know what I'm talking about...) and that is full of research and academic articles regarding trials and the application of justice in link with the psychology of the involved actors. Internalized coercive false confession is a real concept that states that the individual believes he committed a crime and will confess for it although he did not commit it. This is due to the pressure put on him by the interrogation, the police, his anxiety, stress, and so on. Considering the young experience of my client in Redditting, I suppose this totally applies to him and the expert witness can confirm as well. I can bring historical cases in which a false confession has been made. This is why nowadays the Justice requires more than a confession. The facts and the evidences need to add up. Otherwise it would be too simple and innocent people could be manipulated by the police or anyone else to take responsibility for something they did not.  Now let me please ask you another question Your Honor, is a philosophical reasoning used in a way to simply push away a legitimate hypothesis worthier than a scientific concept that is already recognized in the Laws ?  To come back to Occam's razor, this theory does not apply to my version of the facts. Occam's razor simply asks that we should take into account the most realistic hypothesis and not use the most extravagant or over demanding ones. My hypothesis is realistic and it works according to the gap I have explained earlier and that the prosecution cannot fill (the link between Tweeter and my client's Reddit account). You can remove the timing, you can also ignore the shower story I put in my first declaration, there is still nothing to fix the gap between Reddit and Tweeter and therefore nothing proves that my client stole this picture. Occam's razor makes appeal to the good sense and the judgement of whoever uses it. The prosecution is not using good sense here and simply wants to ignore a story that stays on track.  Your Honor, the prosecution said I did not have evidences. In fact, I do not need evidences. I am here in front of you today to let you know that a fair and wise decision needs to be supported by something that cannot allow a single ounce of doubt. However the version brought forward by the prosecution has flaws (and the lack of link between Reddit and Tweeter is not the only flaw, half of the evidences are based on comments that have been deleted and the declarations from the witness is also based on memory of something that is too hard to recall accurately).  Also, the witness brought by the prosecution is the plaintiff. To be valid, a witness has to be someone who is not a plaintiff.  So let me please resume once again my logic to make sure the prosecution understands so we can move on to another argumentation (unless I'm not speaking English for them... I can do it in French and German as well if needed).  The prosecution basically took a picture and joined it to another picture with the hope to make a painting out of it. I can take a fact and join it to something completely different to make it pass for what I want. The evidences are not strong enough to erase all doubts. The plaintiff was laughing the hell out at a post he found on Reddit, then suddenly burst into anger because we were able to find the same story happening a year and four months earlier (with no proof that it is not coming from the same person). This is overly exaggerated. I have no evidence that my client did not steal it. I have a doubt and it is all I need. I demand the prosecution to fulfill this doubt in order to make their point valid and completely true. However they cannot because of privacy restriction set up by the constitution of the Karma Court.  Therefore, this leads us to my claim: there is not enough evidence nor enough proof that tells the picture is not from the OP of that post. Are we going to punish someone just because there is a 50/50 percent chance of the outcome ? No because this would not be fair.  This is very obvious to me, and I am ready to explain over and over again, but I think we all understand here that the possibility that my client is innocent exists and cannot be ignored. Therefore the defence is ready to retract its first request and make another request: simply demanding this case to be dismissed due to the lack of proof (tl;dr: prosecution is in a stalemate).  If the Judge still needs us to debate I am ready to come forward with a forensic psychologist and expert witness as well as interviewing my client at the bar."
KarmaCourt,2zukjv,Kikool42,1 point,Wed Mar 25 01:31:52 2015 UTC,"Your honor, there is no head banging going on here, only mutual consensus in the prosecution lounge, we understand English as well as martian and Canadian Winks.  So many, and we mean so many things do not add up with the defenses story its appalling. it almost seems as a work of fiction. What the defense has done is created a story-line based of off absolutely nothing but core gut feelings. Is that really how run here in /r/karmacourt? if this truly the case, we may as well shut down this subreddit as anything is possible. What we follow here is logical facts, that we can look at and understand what is happening here. We cannot assume anything, we cannot believe anything till you can see it with your own eyes. This is infuriating for us, as we try to do our job as a professional and the defense keeps on making assumptions. We have proof proving that the defenses Ideals  are in fact false, while they cannot even back up a single sentence. I'll get to the case, but I would like to say this, the day a case followed by pure ideals and word will the same day that I /u/navbot leaves /r/karmacourt, and loses faith in this judicial system. the defense says we don't have proper evidence but at least we have some.  In a way, physiological reasoning and scientific evidence and had close ties together, such as Isaac Newton, he believed that science could get him closer to a better understand of god, and look at what he accomplished. I would like you to put two and two together your honor and do the same.  Now to the case at hand, what I gathered from the interview was that the defendant was indeed commenting jokes on the post. What we gather from this you may ask? Why would the defendant delete his humorous comments when the post actually was his? He could of argued it was his? Why did he not want involvement with that account? There are so many questions that the defense is not answering, were starting to make a list. Now we don't want hear any of that BULLSHIT(excuse my language) that the defense has been spewing out. The prosecution AND the people want answers, something that the defense is incapable of giving us. Whats the problem of having other people who had already seen it, see it? It seems the defendant was doing a good job at defending his post why did he not go all the way? These are just some that the defense cannot answer and back up. Even someone with a brain damage could see that they are not the same person.  Now, why would the defendant admit to guilt even though it was not him? Who in there right mind would do that?You cannot just go off that basis alone, yes the defense is right that in that respect. We have this as well as other evidence. how can the defense assume he has a young span on Reddit? If we follow what the defense calls ""facts"", what if this is another account that the defendant has, of many. When you assume, there are way to many variables at play.  Did the defendant delete it because he was truly scared of something or because he admitted to the reposts, we don't know. What we do know is that he did in fact take this from another account and tried to run away. Like i mentioned before, this is a easy simple case that the defense decided to twist. He reposted it, deleted his comments and admitted to the crime. The comments were all fun and games,they were having a great time why delete you comments? The more the defense throws bullshit at you your honor, the more he hopes something will change to make you believe him. The defense is falling apart, with nothing to be backed up this case should of been over before it began. Just because I say i'm a aeronautic engineer does not make it true.  The chances of them actually being the same person are almost second to none, not 50/50. There are almost 8 billion people on earth, around 190 million use twitter, 1/190000000 is almost none existent while him not being the same person is inverted. trust me as person who can do math and look at figures, I know. This on top of the defense not having back up wants the prosecution to start literally bang its head on the wall. Now picture this, now add all the evidence we have bestowed on you, this more then enough to convict.  Trust the facts your honor.  There is no reason to continue this as our heads will melt if this argument continues, this has become idiotic for the prosecutions point of view.  The prosecution rests unless both parties appear."
KarmaCourt,2zukjv,Navbot,1 point,Wed Mar 25 03:51:58 2015 UTC,"There is complete bullshit here and pure single-minded reasoning. You need to change your disk.  First off, let's see what the questioning of the witness brought us:   The witness was the plaintiff. This can bias the testiomony. The witness is not testifying facts but he is recalling textual content. Who could remember so well a sentence or two they have read FIVE DAYS ago ? Your Honor, the human brain is an extraordinary organ but it is not extraordinary to retain such a precise information. And as proof, he clearly shows that he cannot remember what he read (and this is not his fault, it is totally understandable). When asked: ""Do you know what the remark that the defendant said before he deleted his comment?"" He answers:    Which one? I saw one or two deleted in the post.   And again, for the following question: ""Did you by any chance see the other deleted comment?""   What other deleted comment? In that original post? Uhm, where he said ""/u/Cyae1 can't narrate my f..."", ugh, ""eff up""? Or something of that kind. Or any other one?   His answer clearly shows that he cannot remember what was the comment. Therefore the prosecution is clearly making assumptions about the deleted comment and it is clear to me that there is no proof that the deleted comment was from the OP nor it was against his actions.  The witness and plaintiff himself is not sure if a crime was committed:   Do I know he had stolen it? I don't know for sure.   The defence will pursue the questioning of the same witness in a minute or so.     What we follow here is logical facts, that we can look at and understand what is happening here. We cannot assume anything, we cannot believe anything till you can see it with your own eyes. This is infuriating for us, as we try to do our job as a professional and the defense keeps on making assumptions. We have proof proving that the defenses Ideals are in fact false, while they cannot even back up a single sentence. I'll get to the case, but I would like to say this, the day a case followed by pure ideals and word will the same day that I /u/navbot leaves /r/karmacourt, and loses faith in this judicial system. the defense says we don't have proper evidence but at least we have some.   YOU are making ASSUMPTIONS. Taking a picture from 4 days ago and seeing it existed a year ago from another place, then you assume it has been stolen. Where is the logic behind this? Tell me, because I don't see any. Your only argument is the time laps (which is not valid due to the rules of /r/TIFU permitting it) and the behavior of my client. My client has anxiety, does not know how to handle things well. We have all witnessed it. You are also playing on this, assuming the deleted comments were from him and that they certainly contained proof. However there is no screenshot and we do not treat assumptions like evidences. Nothing says that he has not access to this tweeter account. The constitution says that you do not have the right to know this information anyway on top of it. Therefore you are in a stalemate and this case does not have enough evidence.  It is not the job of the defence to bring evidences to the court, or it is not always necessary at least. My job is to make sure my client is having a fair trial and is not miss interpreted because of some sophistic assumptions. I'm using logical reasoning as well as hypothesis. It's your job to demolish fairly and rationally my hypothesis. My hypothesis is ""this tweeter account belongs to my client"". You did not manage to prove otherwise and everybody in this court knows that you won't be able to (-> Article VI. 7 of the constitution).  The facts are: Picture A is in a post. Picture A appeared a year ago somewhere else. Where is the link between them? There is none (no theft, no ownership).   the defense keeps on making assumptions.   This is the best of the year. I'm not assuming anything. I'm pointing out that YOU are assuming that he stole the picture although you have no proof of that. How many times will I have to say it? This guy on Tweeter could be my client and you have no way to prove otherwise (and because I cannot affirm it either doesn't mean he couldn't be; do you get my reasoning here?).  Do you want to know what my ideal is? I'm experienced in philosophy, I have relatives working close or far from the courts and the law system. My ideal is that we do not declare someone guilty without a 99% proof that he is.  This... this is outstanding. I have no words for that. This is fucking serious. I can't explain you better that what you're doing is an assumption. Do you understand that OP can be the guy from Tweeter who made the picture? I'm not saying he is. I'm saying he can be. You can't say he's not. There's no proof. N-O P-R-O-O-F.  If you can't prove he's not the guy from Tweeter, then he's innocent. And as the laws work here, he's innocent until proven guilty.   the defense says we don't have proper evidence but at least we have some.   You're right. I got all my answers wrong on my test but at least I provided answers. This is absurd. Go back to my first statement, I refuted all your evidences.   Why would the defendant delete his humorous comments when the post actually was his? He could of argued it was his? Why did he not want involvement with that account? There are so many questions that the defense is not answering, were starting to make a list. Now we don't want hear any of that BULLSHIT(excuse my language) that the defense has been spewing out. The prosecution AND the people want answers, something that the defense is incapable of giving us. Whats the problem of having other people who had already seen it, see it? It seems the defendant was doing a good job at defending his post why did he not go all the way? These are just some that the defense cannot answer and back up. Even someone with a brain damage could see that they are not the same person.   Nothing proves that the deleted comments were from the defendant.   Also, if you read again the questioning of the witness, he doesn't talk about my client. And the comment he was talking about has nothing to do with the crime he's being accused of.  I can cite my client from a private discussion we had:   re: case from AveragelyGreat sent 1 day ago awesome. btw I remember exactly what the deleted comment was (not sure why I deleted it) but it said ""It is between the quotation marks before 'gets' and after 'the'"" which was meant to be a play on the question asked by /u/pm_me_your_silver. Good work, enjoy your orange juice   All I see is that the said deleted comment has nothing to do with steal or repost. It's a comment that was funny, simple, not harming anyone. What's the matter with it? My client doesn't remember why he deleted it, but he doesn't need to because the comment is irrelevant to the case.  Why did OP delete the post?  If OP is the Tweeter guy, he did it because he did not want us to know it was him. I'm going to leave this IF condition/hypothesis to the judge because I'm sure the prosecution will think it's as comparable as the story of Santa Claus.  Let me do a special algorithm for the prosecution, the judge and anyone else still reading this:  OP can be the Tweeter guy.  IF OP == Tweeter guy  THEN OP deleted post because of privacy reasons.  OP can be the thief.  IF OP == thief  THEN OP deleted because he wanted to erase his traces  The common denominator is the position of OP in the story. Is he the Tweeter guy? We don't know. And as I've said a thousand times, we will never know because of Article VI. 7.   Even someone with a brain damage could see that they are not the same person.   Please have some respect for people with brain damage. This is bullshit and completely false.   Now, why would the defendant admit to guilt even though it was not him? Who in there right mind would do that?You cannot just go off that basis alone, yes the defense is right that in that respect. We have this as well as other evidence. how can the defense assume he has a young span on Reddit? If we follow what the defense calls ""facts"", what if this is another account that the defendant has, of many. When you assume, there are way to many variables at play.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_confession  http://web.williams.edu/Psychology/Faculty/Kassin/files/Kassin_07_internalized%20confessions%20ch.pdf  http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2467049  http://www.cbc.ca/thenational/includes/pdf/typesoffalseconfessions.pdf  Do you need more?   The comments were all fun and games,they were having a great time why delete you comments?   So basically you're blaming someone of deleting comments that are not even relevant for this case.

The facts are that these photos appear in a different time laps but nothing states if their author is two or one person. Should you make a judgement over an assumption? I doubt it so. I am not here to tell you your job, but I am here to remind that this does not make my client guilty. My client does not have to reveal himself and this case simply teaches us that we have to live with the benefit of the doubt, or that sometimes we simply have to live with the doubt over our heads in order to not risk putting an innocent man behind the bars."
KarmaCourt,2zukjv,VivaMathematica,2,Wed Mar 25 05:00:44 2015 UTC,"Your honor please hear us out.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_confession http://web.williams.edu/Psychology/Faculty/Kassin/files/Kassin_07_internalized%20confessions%20ch.pdf http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2467049 http://www.cbc.ca/thenational/includes/pdf/typesoffalseconfessions.pdf   Firstly, a few Online articles, with no real source, seriously? One of these is Wikipedia, the one website were are told not to listen to because it could be falsified information.  Secondly, this proves nothing in this case, how could we possibly know that this was what the defendant was going through this, just more bland assumptions. This is not evidence at all that we can possibly use. The defense also accused us of assuming which We will go over shortly.   Please have some respect for people with brain damage. This is bullshit and completely false.       Oh really, you bashed Buddhists and Canadians, but brain damage is the line, is it because you only share something in line with that, some sort of experience that is close to you?   All I see is that the said deleted comment has nothing to do with steal or repost. It's a comment that was funny, simple, not harming anyone.    Then why did the defendant delete them? They were just fun and games right? Nothing seems to add up to the defenses fiction of the story.   OP can be the Tweeter guy.  IF OP == Tweeter guy  THEN OP deleted post because of privacy reasons.  OP can be the thief.  IF OP == thief   This is not no computer program, were not coding a website, there are way more variables in play here that the defense really does not understand. This algorithm only follows to steps so the defense can say it is 50/50 but your honor it is much different then that. Like I mentioned before, there are around 174 million people that use Reddit and 190 million that use twitter, so it would be 1/1740000000-1/190000000 and it would lower even more for them to be the same person, the odds for this actually occurring is slim to none, its way more then 99% your honor.   All I see is that the said deleted comment has nothing to do with steal or repost. It's a comment that was funny, simple, not harming anyone. What's the matter with it? My client doesn't remember why he deleted it, but he doesn't need to because the comment is irrelevant to the case.   Yeah so why did the defendant delete it? That is the most important thing in this entire case, they were having fun, knwo one was bashing him for the repost, because he stole it. Why else would he delete it when accused and admit to guilt, hes not a 5 year old. Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me. And no defense these are not assumptions, they are more then you have.   First off, let's see what the questioning of the witness brought us: The witness was the plaintiff. This can bias the testiomony. The witness is not testifying facts but he is recalling textual content. Who could remember so well a sentence or two they have read FIVE DAYS ago ? Your Honor, the human brain is an extraordinary organ but it is not extraordinary to retain such a precise information. And as proof, he clearly shows that he cannot remember what he read (and this is not his fault, it is totally understandable). When asked: ""Do you know what the remark that the defendant said before he deleted his comment?"" He answers:   oh really? You brought in your client and listening to his take, why not mine? I sense some double standards here, first you do something and then you turn around and do something else. the defense also keeps assuming that my client is stupid and not going to give a fair testimony which is obviously unfair to my client. My client does it? Biased. When his client does it, its okay. This is unexceptable your honor. The prosecution got way more out of this testimony then the defense did. They were all playing along who threatened him to delete his comments? The more we repeat this information the more it should be clear that the defendant deleted it because he stole it.   YOU are making ASSUMPTIONS. Taking a picture from 4 days ago and seeing it existed a year ago from another place, then you assume it has been stolen. Where is the logic behind this? Tell me, because I don't see any. Your only argument is the time laps (which is not valid due to the rules of /r/TIFU permitting it) and the behavior of my client. My client has anxiety, does not know how to handle things well. We have all witnessed it. You are also playing on this, assuming the deleted comments were from him and that they certainly contained proof. However there is no screenshot and we do not treat assumptions like evidences. Nothing says that he has not access to this tweeter account. The constitution says that you do not have the right to know this information anyway on top of it. Therefore you are in a stalemate and this case does not have enough evidence.   Really? What the prosecution is doing is making logical analysis of our compacted evidence that we spent so long looking for. What the defense are doing on the other hand is coming up with Ideals with no proof, just hope that the you your honor, feel sympathetic to his cause. Doing what we did is how it is done here in /r/karmacourt, I suggest to the defense to browse this subreddit while he is here to get more familiar with it.  I am assuming nothing at all, just seeing the evidence nothing else. What the defense is doing however is wrong and should not be used in the court. If we take away the defenses assumptions he has nothing to help him defend this case, this is why this case already basically over. We have evidence that he took the post from this twitter account, evidence that he deleted his comments because he was found out, felt badly about himself and said he was guilty all this together should be enough to convict. remember the chances of them being the same person, basically zero.  Your honor, the defense has nothing but words of lies and deceit but we can back up our observations with cold hard evidence, which seems to be too cold for the defense to handle. The defendant is guilty I hope you can see that your honor, or god help us"

For the charge of LiarLiarPantsOnFire.co.uk, the court finds the defendant   GUILTY  as the Prosecution could prove, within reasonable doubt, that the defendant did freeboot the content from a twitter account, thus being in violation of the first rule of /r/TIFU.   For the charge of Grand Theft Auto V, the court finds the defendant    NOT GUILTY  as the particular content in question did not originate from Reddit, rather an outside site. Furthermore, the Court cites Repost Jurisdiction Corollary where in the trial of /U/KMEUH V. /U/C-RON, a user could not be tried for reposting material from an outside source.

Grand Theft Auto V which really means theft of some kind not reposting, the only reason the defendant was not guilty of it was because its was not a repost, but all the charge means is the theft which we did in fact prove.  Secondly, isn't deceit and deception just a another form of lying? We clearly saw that the plaintiff was deceived in thinking the post was in fact original which was not in fact the case, proven by our evidence. That was also the main reason the plaintiff started the case in the first place."

Your Honor, the prosecution is acting as a bad loser and is trying to find any way to over turn your decision. This trial was fair and was a great mind battle to make. It's time for the prosecution to accept it and find someone else to target.   Is the defense saying that we are indeed the bad guy here, we only seek a fair trial, and justice. We never ""laughed"" at your arguments,  we analysed it carefully, and created our counter arguments.  The prosecution agrees that it is not fair to the defendant that he has two charges that mean the same thing. The only reason we kept the charges was to honor the wishes of the plaintiff but as the case went on, we realized this was not in fact the right decision and the verdict was taken as soon as we decided what to do.  Here is deception on the thesaurus: http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/deception  Here we can see that lying is in fact are synonyms of each other, and by here it follows the same evidence. If the defendant is guilty of lying, in turn they should be guilty of deception. We do not want to win, we just want this to be as fair as possible, so merging the two charges is the ideal opportunity to follow.  If this is not done, this is being unfair and bias to my client and the prosecution wants a fair trial for everyone. The prosecution does not care who the victor is anymore, as long all clients are seen equally, we will in fact agree with the decision.  We realize that our client was swearing at you and for this you have our deepest apologies on his behalf. But this right here, proves one of the untold rules of being an attorney, one that we learned the hard way, No matter how low a client goes, it is your job to stay calm and professional, this is what sets you far from the rest, this is why you are representing the client, so this entire constitution does not go unbalanced.  We admit, in the heat of the moment, we wanted to also disobeyed this rule, and we almost and kind of did, and we again are sorry.  /u/Kikool42, please don't take this advice the wrong way, this is meant to be constructive criticism from one fellow attorney to another, and has nothing to do with the case.  We will retract all our statements of you and call you a friend, if you keep a open mind like we are in this very moment. We not trying to be biased as all court attorneys normally are, we are being human.

These charges appear nowhere in the constitution. These charges are so not charges that two of them have never been mentioned on this sub reddit. The charge of Taunting is the only word that showed up in a search of this sub reddit! In one case the charge of Taunting was a charge but the case was dismissed. See Here. In the other case it was used some ware in comments and not part of the charges See Here!  I do understand that the constitution of this sub reddit allows for an other charge category (Appendice II point 8), but even with this the charges my client was charged with do not violate any articles in the constitution!  Ladies and Gentelmen I think the charges against /u/originalucifer must be dropped to preserver liberty justice and karma!  EDIT: formatting"

My point is this: the law is the law, and yes, the charges might not be written just yet, but if a year from now, a snoo murdered a redditor, would it not be punished just because it isn't written in the constitution??  Times change, people change, and technology, science, and all kinds of studies are evolving and changing rapidly. There will be times when the law might have to be adjusted to the times.   looking at the people of reddit should the constitution not change and evolve, just like everything else?"
KarmaCourt,2zqmnl,IceBlade03,3,Sat Mar 21 08:22:09 2015 UTC,It seems like the prosecution is pleading for us to punish against laws that don't exist. I will now hear one more statement from the defense and I will make a thread for the jury.

Have they been summoned? I fear not. So as my first action as the lead prosecutor I hereby drop an invitation to join the prosecution for one, again, in letters one, esteemed colleague. As a second I ask the bailiff /u/stolenbases to summon the truly innocent until we've failed to prove him guilty defendant /u/S0CIOPATH, who may be a sociopath since they didn't call themselves a sociopath without grammatical error, probably intended. Then please inform the defendant of their rights. All three of them:  1 You have the right to a fair trial. 1 You have the right to legal counsel. 1 You have the right to remain silent. 5 You DON'T have the right to mass downvote or brigade anyone. 6 You have the right to parody fighting over invaluable internet Karma points.  Then, Sir bailiff, please, punch our dear plaintiff /u/XXfuzyxgamingXX in the face for not dropping the defendant's name in the docket and make them do it. Like, make them write ""defendant - [defendant's username with the preceding '/u/']"" just not by the letter but by content.  On to the case, let me present the facts just quick: A redditette comes to /r/motorcycles down for the fact she can't go ride anymore and the good fellows there put her username on their bikes to ride with them. Another redditor submits the comment chain to /r/bestof and frontpages. Then the defendant does it and well, sits at about 170 points. Let's call that a wrap. That's it.  So, the People of Reddit, rapper sent it by the plaintiff and spoken for by the persecution claim that constitutes reposting in the first degree, douchebaggery and abuse of brain cancer. Now ... turns to plaintiff ... the dear plaintiff I ask, please, count with me and use all two of your middle fingers: That makes 1. reposting, 2. douchebaggery and 3. abuse of brain cancer. flips him off three times THAT'S NOT REFLECTED IN THE DOCKET! sighs  to the court Alas, we have this shitty evidence, the testimony of the plaintiff and a sub that has no rule against reposts but a trial. We're still confident the court will find reasonable doubt that the defendant may or may not have seen or not seen the first submission to best of, dismisses douchebagging as the trivial offence escape charge it is and find that, ""BRAIN CANCER? Using brain cancer to gain best of Karma is terribly wrong!!!"" even though the general reddit public has an interest in such information that conflicts with that assessment.  Anyways, it's up to the defence to decide if they better offer a plea deal or not. Thank you. sits down to a courtroom that has fallen completely silent in confusion  Ah, one addendum, though, I'll add in a reply to this comment because I dropped enough names here."

And now, my good sirs, I direct you all to the search bar, where we can see that, realizing the content was already posted, /u/S0CIOPATH deleted his post. I ask the court - Is that what a douchebag or a karmawhore would do? No, it is not. A Douchebag would have kept the post - A Douchebag would have kept the karma. Instead, realizing his mistake, the defendant deleted his post, thereby relinquishing the karma. He was not a reposter, he simply made an innocent mistake. It is obvious that the two made there posts at least within a half an hour of eachother, otherwise they would not both show up as 5 hours old on the Plaintiff's screenshot. Hell, this all assumes our Plaintiff is being entirely honest. Your honor, I know I didn't submit the Plaintiff as a witness beforehand, but there wasn't really time for that as the prosecution submitted his opening before he was the prosecution, therefor  The Defense calls /u/XXfuzyxgamingXX to the stand!"

Your honour, if the defence counsel pleases to check the time stamps of my introduction as well as the opening statement they will surely recognize that I have clearly submitted my opening after I was the prosecution.  I would also like to request a reasoning why we would want to hear the plaintiff, who obviously only submitted the case and doesn't have a fuck to give about testimony. But what gives, let him testify, he'll only pile on the defendant.  Because I must also to strongly refuse the insinuation I would have furthered the case of the defence. They didn't have any in the first place. If at all I have not furthered that of the prosecution. But this is an open and shut case anyways, so there wasn't anything to further as well.  Instead, your client had the indignity to not check best of for a submission of the same kind before he tried to reap enormous amounts of precious scarce karma with a case of brain cancer! That is the definition of attempted brain cancer abuse through douchebagged repostery. And there is no single bit of reasonable doubt that your client could not have seen the previous submission because it may not have been displayed correctly by his reddit.

KarmaCourt,2znqsq,IceBlade03,1 point,Mon Mar 23 23:43:18 2015 UTC,"Alright.  My client, /u/S0CIOPATH, is on trial today for Reposting, Douchebaggery, and (until the Plaintiff made a sneaky ninja edit to the case while I was arguing with the prosecution) Abuse of Brain Cancer. I have already pointed out that my client must obviously have been unaware that his post was, in fact, a repost. As the Plaintiff claims a 1 hour difference between the posts, and the evidence from Exhibit A shows no difference in timing, it must be concluded that there was a difference of around 30 minutes between the two posts. Is it not possible that my client checked bestof before making his post, but too early for the other post to have shown up? He was ignorant of the existence of the other post, and thus did not truly commit a repost, simply a redundancy. On the topic of douchebaggery, I disagree wholeheartedly. Seeing his error, my client removed his post, allowing the earlier post to receive all the upvotes and traffic that would otherwise have been split between the two. Would a douchebag do this? I don't think so. As for the final charge, I think I have made it quite clear that there could have been no abuse of brain cancer, as brain cancer is not mentioned whatsoever in my client's post. It seems the Plaintiff agrees with me, as he edited that out of the list of charges. In fact, he did this without an approved motion to amend the list of charges. Typically, when a charge is to be changed, the judge, the plaintiff, the prosecution, or some combination of the aforementioned must motion for the list of charges to be changed, and then with the blessing of both the Judge and the Plaintiff, the edit is made. It seems the Plaintiff of this case doesn't believe our KC traditions apply to him. But I digress. In conclusion, my client was not a reposter, simply a victim of unfortunate circumstances. He was not a douchebag, and even made attempts to amend his mistake. And he certainly did not abuse any brain cancer, or any type of cancer or terminal illness."

KarmaCourt,2ziym3,moccasinroot,6,Thu Mar 19 00:04:52 2015 UTC,Yes sir. I love Trident.  Especially the one Ariel's father owns.

KarmaCourt,2ziym3,IceBlade03,9,Thu Mar 19 20:32:20 2015 UTC,"The court room is filled with geriatrics, and homeless people. The judge in his new form fitting garb leaves little to the imagination as he enter the room. He picks up the gavel from the bench and lays down three big bangs to make the court room shut the hell up. And in a booming voice he says  Trial Thread Suckas!  I want a good clean fight and please provide me with a complement as I have been feeling down lately."
KarmaCourt,2ziym3,moccasinroot,8,Thu Mar 19 00:10:15 2015 UTC,"Prosecution Opening Statement  Your very honorable honor, we are here today for two reason's. The first being that you made my mother drag me in here, the second being to fight against the karma whoring that the defendant has so clearly been doing. There is no denying based  upon the overwhelming evidence provided by my client, that the defendant is a no good dirty karma whore that needs to face the court for his crimes. We are charging the defendant with exactly 8 counts of Grandtheft.jpg  and 6 counts of Karma  laundering. I also seem to have forgotten just how awesome you are your honor, you are awesome."
KarmaCourt,2ziym3,IceBlade03,7,Thu Mar 19 01:32:16 2015 UTC,"The defense is sitting in awe of the judge and takes some time to realize that the prosecution is done talking.  Ahem ahem  Defense Opening Statement.  Your honor,  The prosecution is just arbitrarily making up numbers against my client and there is no way that they are guilty of those charges. I invite the prosecution to prove each one the 8 counts of Grandtheft.jpg and 6 counts Karma laundering that they have charged the defendant with. We, the defense are certain that this shall lead to all members of the court realizing that my client is in fact innocent."
KarmaCourt,2ziym3,moccasinroot,6,Thu Mar 19 02:02:31 2015 UTC,"Rebuttal  Your honor, I'd like for the defense to be reminded that the nature of this court is funny satire, the charges  were pressed as a way of maintaining this nature. However the 8 counts of Grandtheft.jpg were derived from the 12 posts that my client has linked as evidence, the prosecution is only charging him on 8 of these accounts. The karma laundering  charges derive from reposts  to the exact same subreddit with the same title from which the defendant pulled the original content. It seems as though the defense has pleaded innocent, but the evidence is overwhelming, Karma crimes were committed by the defendant and I urge the most handsome judge (/u/moccasinroot) I have ever seen to realize that there is no disputing the crimes presented here today."
KarmaCourt,2ziym3,storyafterjoke,4,Thu Mar 19 02:21:01 2015 UTC,"/u/storyafterjoke I will look at the evidence personally. However, /u/IceBlade03 though this is a satirical court and I don't want to go over the minutiae of every piece of evidence in detail during the proceedings, I would like to remind you that you still must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty.  Also, bailiff please switch my drink order to Jameson. I am going to have to get good and loose if I have to look over all this evidence."
KarmaCourt,2ziym3,moccasinroot,5,Thu Mar 19 02:43:50 2015 UTC,"Your honor, if you carefully review the evidence, you can see that the defendant was not even creative enough to change  the titles of his reposts! I have provided the finest Jameson the bailiff could fetch from the court room vending machine  for you to comfortably consider this case."
KarmaCourt,2ziym3,IceBlade03,6,Thu Mar 19 03:00:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you counselor. I am so happy they finally added that bar vending machine.  However, it can't mix drinks like /u/portboy14.   Counselor /u/storyafterjoke do you have any arguments to rebut /u/IceBlade03?"
KarmaCourt,2ziym3,Portboy14,2,Thu Mar 19 03:24:48 2015 UTC,"Uh! Yes your very handsome honor in fact I do.  Your honor, the charge of Grandtheft.jpg is a serious one; it is applied when the defendant claims credit for a post that isn't their. In this case all the defendant did was some simple harmless reposting which is extremely common in this website but a lot of the OPs in question are so old that they've been archived they would never have gained anymore either way.  Also your honor, I always feel and I know that someone as intelligent and fair as you would agree that just because someone might be guilty of one thing they cannot be held guilty of anything else especially if the thing that they indeed are guilty of hasn't been charged.  Your honor, the only ""crime"" the defendant committed was some simple reposting which was never charged by the prosecution and that too to an extremely small extent given the age of few of the posts.  Given your awesome smartness you will see this as you examine the evidence.  The defense rests."
KarmaCourt,2ziym3,Professor_Doodles,3,Thu Mar 19 10:40:59 2015 UTC,Counselor /u/IceBlade03 does the prosecution rest?
KarmaCourt,2ziym3,moccasinroot,1 point,Thu Mar 19 16:16:33 2015 UTC,"Prosecution Rests MuthaFuckas  Your honor, it seems as though the defendant has a point. We can't prosecute an OP for reposting content since that's just the way the internet works. However, the defendant is not only a reposter, he is beyond that. The twelve posts that my client provided evidence means beyond all reasonable doubt that the defendant is in fact a karma whore. Someone who disregards the original poster completely and gives no credit to their original content, this is unacceptable and I urge the court to consider this. The prosecution rests."

KarmaCourt,2ziym3,Professor_Doodles,3,Thu Mar 19 20:37:42 2015 UTC,"Yerr'oner, GrandTheft.JPG is a very specific crime, one with set circumstances and requirements, one of which is the claiming of personal connection to the post in question. It is for this reason that I dismiss all but one of the 8 charges of GrandTheft.JPG, leaving the defendant guilty in the case of number three.  Conversely, I find /u/xvvhiteboy guilty on all charges of karma laundering, as they have clearly been abusing the system with reckless abandon and no thought for the safety of other Redditors or the sanctity of the upvote.  I yield the stage to /u/Dineos, and to the right honourable judge."
KarmaCourt,2ziym3,GhostOfWhatsIAName,2,Thu Mar 19 20:53:28 2015 UTC,"Well said, /u/StezzerLolz. I must agree, that it is evident that perhaps not enough evidence has been shown to prove that /u/Xvvhiteboy is guilty of grandtheft.jpg. With that said...  It was a well fought argument on both sides.   there is no doubt in my mind that /u/Xvvhiteboy is a horrible person and should probably be put to death, however, as it has been stated, we cannot punish someone for reposting (or can we?). Because, in the defendants words, ""that's how the internet works."" Unfortunately I agree with the defendant in this special case because without reposts, Reddit wouldn't be a place.   HOWEVER, I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT /U/XVVHITEBOY IS GUILTY OF KARMA WHORING AND KARMA LAUNDERING AND CONSEQUENCES SHOULD FOLLOW HIS ACTIONS  I leave the floor to the good and honorable judge /u/moccasinroot, whose hair in no way represents a malnourished hedgehog as other users have pointed out."

KarmaCourt,2zeu7c,Evenseeker,4,Thu Mar 19 21:30:39 2015 UTC,"OPENING STATEMENT:  My client, /u/triaxial , to peak the interest of fellow IT workers and fellow redditors alike, took it upon himself to dissect an old Intel Processor and thoroughly document the process and take detailed photography with his/her personal/business high resolution camera/microscope (As seen in EXHIBIT C  and EXHIBIT B ).  The defendant, /u/Popkorn , claimed my client's work as his/her own and as a result, gained over 5000 undeserved karma; and according to /u/enrag3dj3w, /u/Popkorn went even further in regards to claiming my clients work as his own by mentioning that he used an anti-static mat during 'his/her documentation' ( /u/Popkorn 's comment has since been removed but evidence suggests that /u/enrag3dj3w is correct). /u/unknown_name , /u/Ze_maestro , and /u/pvg have also come fourth to provide testimony as to the defendants attempted cover-ups of claiming the client's work.  Now, x-posting is nothing new to reddit or any forum board; but for one to claim another's work as their own and take credit for it to gain karma is theft and cannot be tolerated.  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, do not let the defendants actions and karma honeypotting go unnoticed, and side in favor of the plaintiff /u/triaxial"
KarmaCourt,2zeu7c,Evenseeker,6,Wed Mar 18 09:32:21 2015 UTC,It would seem to all be circumstantial. Where are the screenshots of the infractions? All the evidence is just comments and the reddit post in questions clearly gives credit to the author.

KarmaCourt,2zeu7c,Thimoteus,5,Wed Mar 18 17:58:54 2015 UTC,"Ladies and gentlemen, your honor, the respectable jury, and fellow Redditors.  I have been called here today in defense of my client, the defendant, /u/Popkorn.  Let us first go over the charges:  CHARGE: ""x-posting other's work as his/her own and banking in over 5000 karma for it. In this instance, the work belonged to /u/triaxial""  Now, let us take a look at this recent and exciting update in the charge:  ""March 17th 10:16PM EST: It is to be noted that since /u/Popkorn 's x-posting and thievery has been noted, his 5000+ karma post has now been downvoted out the wazoo to under 5000 with original owner's ( /u/triaxial ) comment being upvoted to over 3500 karma - As seen in EXHIBIT A""  Your honor, I would like to point out that this clear act of DownvotingToOblivion.jpg is a blatant disruption and BREACH to the RedditConstitution.exe. This is because my client, /u/Popkorn's Karma was attacked before the case had even finished being debated upon.  This was a clear act of injustice against the defendant and I hope the jury realizes that this pre-trial attack on /u/Popkorn's potentially legitimate Karma is not a simple matter to brush away. It is a severe crime.    Now, your honor, I would like to direct your attention to the aforementioned EXHIBIT C. Upon reading through, there is no clear evidence that the plaintiff, /u/triaxial has written and taken those photographs himself. For all we know, he could just be claiming the work to be his own by linking it as a blog post on reddit.  My client has posted these images & captions found in Exhibit C as an x-post which is definitely not illegal by The Laws of Reddit. Furthermore, there is no sufficient evidence that /u/Popkorn's x-post was claimed as him own!   Therefore, my client's post was perfectly legal and all Karma should be returned to him for the sake of fairness."
KarmaCourt,2zeu7c,Thimotron,3,Wed Mar 18 18:10:22 2015 UTC,"I would like to thank both the defense and the prosecutor for their opening statements. Now, /u/cman2232, I would like to hear your rebuttal. Feel free to call any witnesses you may have to the stand."
KarmaCourt,2zeu7c,SirPineapples,7,Wed Mar 18 18:50:12 2015 UTC,"/u/ash00ri: ""Your honor, I would like to point out that this clear act of DownvotingToOblivion.jpg is a blatant disruption and BREACH to the RedditConstitution.exe. This is because my client, /u/Popkorn's Karma was attacked before the case had even finished being debated upon.""  OBJECTIONS:  -Assumes facts not in evidence  -Calls for speculation  -more prejudicial than probative  REASON: /u/ash00ri is assuming that the defendants decline in karma points is a 'pre-trial attack'. However, I do not believe that any decline in karma is as a result of this trial in session. /u/triaxial 's post which reavealed /u/Popkorn as a thief and plagiariser has gained almost 4000 karma, while this court session has gained less than 150 karma at this time. That being said, it is now proven that /u/triaxial 's revealing post in EXHIBIT A has gained significantly MORE publicity than this trial and is likely the result of the defendants karma reduction.    /u/ash00ri: ""It is a severe crime.""  OBJECTION:   -Arguing the law  -Lack of Foundation  REASON: There is nothing in evidence linking /u/Popkorn 's reduction in karma to this trial or any single person and/or organization    /u/ash00ri: ""Now, your honor, I would like to direct your attention to the aforementioned EXHIBIT C. Upon reading through, there is no clear evidence that the plaintiff, /u/triaxial has written and taken those photographs himself. For all we know, he could just be claiming the work to be his own by linking it as a blog post on reddit.""  RESPONSE: /u/triaxial has testified that the original content in question was ""my work"" EXHIBIT A ; and as seen in EXHIBIT B  /u/triaxial has responded to comments which confirms his expertise on the matter, further confirming his rightful ownership.    /u/ash00ri: ""My client has posted these images & captions found in Exhibit C as an x-post which is definitely not illegal by The Laws of Reddit. Furthermore, there is no sufficient evidence that /u/Popkorn's x-post was claimed as him own!""  RESPONSE: The testimony of /u/enrag3dj3w EXHIBIT G; /u/unknown_name EXHIBIT H; /u/Ze_maestro EXHIBIT I and /u/pvg EXHIBIT J clearly prove otherwise.  I would also like to note that /u/triaxial 's post in EXHIBIT A mensions that /u/Popkorn ""edited the imgur album to include the proper credit"". This was not until AFTER he already recieved 5000 karma for plagiarised work AND AFTER he had been discovered and caught!    Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury; do not let /u/Popkorn 's attempted coverups fool you. The evidence all points in one direction: plagiarism, and 5000 karma as a result of it. On behalf of /u/triaxial and the members of reddit fooled into giving undeserved karma, I ask you to find in favor of the plaintiff"

KarmaCourt,2zdj5x,Professor_Doodles,1 point,Tue Mar 17 19:25:36 2015 UTC,"It depends on if it was abandoned.  If a family abandons their house to go on vacation to France or something, can I not move in, sell their stuff, and turn the place into a meth den? It is the same with abandoned images on imgur.

KarmaCourt,2zdj5x,HockeyGoalie1,4,Tue Mar 17 21:38:22 2015 UTC,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen of the court. We have here a very classic case of plagiarism. This of course of a very serious crime as it robs our poor victim of possible sweet sweet karma which they may have reaped had they themselves decided to x-post the post in question.  Here we see the evidence, the two posts. Each of them are posted to similar subs, both being graffiti-related, and each piece of evidence is of the same image. Now our defendant x-posted the image a mere four hours after the OP. Four hours ladies and gentlemen. This simply is not enough time to take an imagine and repost it, as it is entirely possible that the OP may have x-posted it themselves later for more wonderful upboats.   The evidence is very self-explanatory, and this is a simple case of fraud by karmatheft, as I believe I have now swiftly shown.  I hope that you all shall see with clarity on this matter. The prosecution stands ready for the defense's opening statement."

KarmaCourt,2zdj5x,Professor_Doodles,2,Fri Mar 20 08:10:22 2015 UTC,"Did I say within 12 hours Earth time? I meant within 12 hours Jupiter time.  What we have here is a simple case of posting to a bigger subreddit with a bigger audience. My client did not know that this post had existed because of /r/bombing's small size and community. He had also gotten the picture from a non-reddit source and likely posted it to imgur himself after seeing it.  Here we can take a look at the two imgur links . . .  http://i.imgur.com/gdpXy97.jpg - this is the first link, notice the code gdpXy97  http://i.imgur.com/5s9895U.jpg - and this is the second link, which has a completely different code of 5s9895U  Because of the same resolutions, however, we can say that this picture likely came from the same non-reddit source, but there was no communication between the first poster, and my client.  I am now ready for the Prosecution's rebut, your honor."
KarmaCourt,2zdj5x,Not_dead_yet_fred,1 point,Fri Mar 20 12:04:08 2015 UTC,"I would disagree with that, sir.   Due to the fact that each of the subs are related, being about graffiti, then it certainly would make sense that our defendant would be a member of each. It would then also make sense that he would have seen the OP and decided to repost to another sub.  As you said, the images are of the same resolution, and you also stated that he 'likely posted it to Imgur himself after seeing it."" That means that they are very likely from the same source!  So therefore ladies and gentlemen of the court, he must have seen it on the original sub, downloaded it with a few short clicks, re-uploaded it a little bit later, and then posted the new image to the second sub, where the offending act occurred.   It is really that simple.   I stand for the defense to cross-examine."
KarmaCourt,2zdj5x,GhostOfWhatsIAName,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:15:40 2015 UTC,"You restate what I have stated, the two images likely do come from the same non-reddit, I repeat Non-reddit source.  If this were a simple case of hit-and-run reposting, my client wouldn't have even bothered uploading it to imgur himself, just as most reposters do(n't bother to do)  Furthermore, your argument at the moment is completely circumstantial, and full of reasonable doubt, which is what I am here to provide."

KarmaCourt,2z2tz8,Thimoteus,9,Sun Mar 15 18:28:47 2015 UTC,"REAL TRIAL THREAD  /u/IceBlade03, you're up for opening statements.  There's a motion to dismiss this case on account of the defendant receiving downvotes. I will hear from the prosecution regarding this.  RULING ON MOTION TO DISMISS  Gallowboob has shown up in this court before. He's a controversial figure, and as such draws attention wherever he goes. In this case, he drew attention from supporters and detractors alike. Unfortunately, the detractors felt it necessary to push some of his comment scores in this case to the negatives.  Now, the defense wants me to dismiss the case, and the prosecution wants it declared a mistrial. I won't do either yet. I am giving this case another 12 hours before which the defendant's comment score must be at least 1 to offset any unconstitutional downvoting. We will then resume.  VERDICT  Ladies and gentlemen, this court is no stranger to /u/gallowboob's antics. He has appeared in this court multiple times and, like a senator in a public restroom, has gotten off on each occasion. Well, that ends today! By unanimous one-man verdict, a jury of the defendant's reddit peer(s) has found him guilty on all charges. Therefore, this court sentences the defendant to be baked in a pie and served to starving African children.  Also, the bailiff is to take /u/bzishi into custody for contempt and disruption.  COURT IS ADJOURNED"
KarmaCourt,2z2tz8,IceBlade03,8,Sun Mar 15 20:22:41 2015 UTC,"Your honor seeing as how the defendant has been properly up voted. I will begin my opening statement, the defendant is a well known offender of karma crimes. A quick look at his post history suggests that even  while in karma court he has not stopped stealing OC from OP's  as he continues to repost content. At the beginning of this trial I declared a mistrial for his treatment here in karma court. But now that this has been rectified it would be foolish to disregard his karma whoring, the defendant has clearly reaped the Karma belonging to other redditors and for this the prosecution moves to charge the defendant with GrandTheft.jpg. His actions according to the karma court Constitution are inexcusable as he has proven  to blatantly steal posts to cure an insatiable thirst for karma. Despite his willingness to appear in the court today we cannot disregard his actions."
KarmaCourt,2z2tz8,Thimoteus,7,Sun Mar 15 23:34:37 2015 UTC,"Your honour,  This case is about a one-off incident in /r/atheism and not about any past actions of the defendant.  I would like to request you to get rid of any biases that you may have regarding the defendant so that the verdict reached is fair to all.  And also... This time /u/GallowBoob did nothing wrong.  More argument later."

KarmaCourt,2z2tz8,Thimoteus,5,Tue Mar 17 12:58:03 2015 UTC,"These ""biases"" are allowed due to his past Karma crimes which can be used as evidence against him in any case  your honor. Wouldn't it be possible  that due to the  defendants prior  interest in procuring Karma that he might say, create a story   that he knew would become popular for said karma? The defendant had not only the intent for the post to become popular but it unfortunately  did, which only  continued to feed his karma addiction. As the top comment on that very post can attest, the circumstances behind said post are highly suspect to say the least. His claims that a school would print out full color sheets to give to students is not only ludicrous, the prosecution   challenges him to provide evidence  that they were in fact handed out to students. I believe that true injustice in this case is the fact that  innocent redditors  were forced to enjoy the karma whoring ways of a reposter  and liar such as /u/GallowBoob"
KarmaCourt,2z2tz8,RacksDiciprine,5,Tue Mar 17 13:18:11 2015 UTC,"Your honour,  The defence feels that while the prosecution makes a compelling argument regarding the guilt of my client they fail to notice that /r/atheism is almost certainly just a /r/circlejerk for I am so cool now, religion suxxx atheists and point 6 of Article VI of the KarmaCourt Constitution says that it is the right of every redditor to be able to post in such subs without this kind of prosecution.   The defence feels that this is enough for a not guilty verdict. If the judge happens to disagree there might be further arguments."
KarmaCourt,2z2tz8,Thimoteus,6,Tue Mar 17 22:06:32 2015 UTC,"Your most honorable honor. In response to the defense and their educated assumption that /r/atheism has become an /r/circlejerk of sorts. It does not change the fact that it is not intended to be a sub dedicated to ""circle jerking"". Therefore the defendant can be charged with a karma crime since /r/atheism is intended to be a real subreddit. The prosecution rests, as it is clear in the eyes of my client and I that the defense is simply trying to avoid being charged with anything."
KarmaCourt,2z2tz8,RacksDiciprine,5,Tue Mar 17 22:40:26 2015 UTC,"Your honour,  The defence has found evidence proving that the worksheet that has been the centre of this controversy does indeed exist.  I present to you the Defence Exhibit A.  Thus your honour it is incredibly possible that such a worksheet was indeed given to the student.  This your honour, should be enough."

KarmaCourt,2z2tz8,RacksDiciprine,2,Tue Mar 17 23:19:34 2015 UTC,"Your honor, as a final closing statement, I would  like the court to reconsider  it's  decision. It may seem my clients case was defeated by evidence, but here in the Karma court are we simply  going to let a reposter live on like this? Can we allow for /u/GallowBoob  to continue his karma whoring ways? I don't think we should, I leave the charges at exactly   56.367 counts of Grandtheft.jpg  and hope that you, will make the right decision."

If you get karma true and fair, we can all respect that. If its re-posted, which is like 70% of posts these days, its obviously not right. Stealing is not right, no matter if its at a convenient store or a picture of someones cat. The prosecution keeps asking itself why people do this, it just fake internet points right?  THE EVIDENCE  Exhibit A and Exhibit B- In Exhibit A, we can see the original post, we can clearly see that /u/kingofrock37 did not care about karma, he just want people to innocently see his post. To him, karma is very small dictator of quite a few reasons to post, which it should be. Now if you view Exhibit B, it is a completely different story. /u/threesaws obviously was looking for karma, knowing what to take and when, and what most people would not recognize, is very difficult. The defendant is obviously a pro at re-posting. This is just ONE of the accounts of Grand Theft Karma.  Exhibit Cand Exhibit D- We can clearly see the defendant stealing yet another persons post for the sole purpose of sweet karma, The defendant does not even stop, he keeps doing it, this is ANOTHER account of Grand Theft Karma.  Exhibit E- The defendant stealing yet another post, this is getting ridiculous, what is the defendant thinking? He just keeps on re-posting, without care or cause. This is just ANOTHER of grand theft karma.  Exhibit F- The defendant is at it again, re-posting images we have all seen before, the post was deleted, he was trying to cover himself up, but my client has seen his treachery and I hope you can see it as well. The defendant is showing us posts that we all of seen before, beating a dead horse PROVING the third charge.  Exhibit G- The defendant has a very impressive amount of karma with exactly 44,869 post karma. The defendant has been doing this for quite some time. If we view his recent posts we see re-post after re-post, and we can easily see where his karma came from. This PROVES the charge Being a big fat greedy karma whore.  ANALYSIS  We could go on for ages of different thefts but we would run out of letters. The truth is, the defendant has done way more then 3 account of re-posting. We really truly don't know exactly how many victims have scummed to this fiend, it could be in the hundreds for all we know. The defendant is clearly GUILTY of all the charges, I hope you can see that your honor."

Excuse me , but the argument made by the defense is in clear violation of everything we stand for here in the Karma Court. The defense claims that ""reposting is not a crime"" when the court exists because reposting is a crime. This man, regardless of his inclination to give proper credit to the redditors, did so without informing them and with the intent to reap Karma for himself. In other words your honor, Karma laws were clearly broken here. Any karma that this redditor received belongs to the OP's that posted it, regardless of his links to the original post."
KarmaCourt,2ysv2o,that_random_potato,1 point,Tue Mar 17 09:49:24 2015 UTC,"The Court exists because lying is a crime, not reposting. It would be amazing if this Court were to have been created on a site dedicated to reposting stories from media outlets and other clever people on the Internet. What is a crime is when people take credit for the work of others, fail to acknowledge the source, or pretend that they have created an original work when it isn't. None of these apply. And the only time that reposting is mentioned in our Constitution is for the same (of which I just reposted a part):   Somebody else reposted the pic and said it was their cat? BUT IT WAS YOUR CAT! YOUR PIC! HOW DARE THEY!   Clearly this does not apply. But I do have to wonder why you aren't taking your logic and applying it more generally. Why attack this little user and his little sub when you could bring charges against the big guys like /r/news, /r/bestof, and the like? Is it because you just don't like what the defendant is saying, not because you think some ethical rule was broken. Perhaps you are worried that many of your favorite subs would dry up and Reddit would be no more. But this certainly wouldn't happen if you attacked a tiny sub. Your hypocrisy is showing.  Face it son, the Internet is based on reposting. And so is Reddit."
KarmaCourt,2ysv2o,that_random_potato,1 point,Tue Mar 17 17:26:18 2015 UTC,"I again believe that the defense is straying away from the point here, and has clearly yet to read the constitution that we use here in the court. ""Reposting"" is what we persecute here, and your client is a ""reposter"" and although your argument is written quite eloquently I still believe that you are missing the point. We here in /r/KarmaCourt do nothing more than bring justice upon those that re-post for the intent of receiving karma. Your client has done so, and therefor broken Karma Court rules. As for the rest of Reddit, until a case is brought to my metaphorical desk against every user on this site, it doesn't apply. An saying that and I quote:   The Court exists because lying is a crime, not reposting   Is undermining the reasons we have a karma court, your honor /u/that_random_potato I motion for you to disregard the defense as clearly they are not informed on the reason our courts exist."
KarmaCourt,2ysv2o,Kell08,1 point,Tue Mar 17 17:51:26 2015 UTC,"This case is clearly a farce, but I respect the fact that the prosecution tried to give it his best despite no evidence that the crime even exists. As such, it is clear that the charges will have to be dismissed as baseless and there is no further point for the defense to argue against some undefined crime.  The defense rests."

KarmaCourt,2ysv2o,dellmill,1 point,Wed Mar 18 02:55:40 2015 UTC,"How did this esteemed court come to forget the difference between karma being earned to karma being stolen. Reposting is not a crime, nor is it even a social taboo. Reddit has several default subs whose purpose is to repost content created by others, like /r/news, /r/music, /r/technology, etc. But now that someone is reposting on a personal sub (as well as giving proper credit in the comments like a good Redditor) the posts that other Redditors made or reposted themselves (like this), we are getting butthurt? If all of Reddit refused to allow reposts of other people's content then Reddit would become a ghost town. Probably 95% of this site would go away.  So, here are the so-called crimes of my defendant:   Did what pretty much every Redditor has done by linking to original content Gives links to the original thread so that the original creator (or even just linker) gets credit Created his own sub so that he didn't spam others and so that people who are interested in his aggregation can subscribe   I don't think the defendant should be prosecuted, he should get a medal!

KarmaCourt,2y9s4u,suchsmartveryiq,11,Sun Mar 8 09:34:46 2015 UTC,"Hey, wow, so I'm in Karma Court? I'm honored.  May I defend myself? Here we go!   He's been a hobo for 10 years[1] . That's why he's had a dog and a house for 2 years[2]    Actually, my family has 5 dogs, and two cats! My mother has 2 dogs, one of which used to be mine, but since I travel I can't take a dog with me. My two brother have 3 dogs, combined! I post pics of the dogs whenever I go back home to visit family and friends. I have been back home to visit 3 times in the past 10 years of living on the road, and I always pet the puppies and take pics of them for my memories. So all you have done is pull up a picture of the two dogs my mother takes care of, a picture that I actually took over a year and half ago when I traveled through Alabama and briefly visited home. Good job OP!  I also have submitted pictures of other peoples dogs that I posted on Reddit, such as dogs or cats that I meet while working on the farms, couchsurfing with other people, etc! If you're going to convict me of being an animal lover, or visiting my families dogs back home, I am guilty as charged! Do I own a dog or house? Haha, no...i don't even have a credit score. If you consider my tent a house, then sure...   He's spent 10 years on the road. That's why he needs a handgun for ""home defense.""   That Taurus looks like a badass gun, but I've personally never owned any firearm at all. In fact, I don't even have a gun owners permit, or even how to apply for one. I don't have any felonies or anything, so I could legally get a permit and own one, but it's not something I've ever felt like I needed on the road. When I posted that submission, a local bartender was wanting to sell me that gun for 250 dollars. I tried it out, mostly for novelty, and di alot of research about it when I was deciding whether I'd need a gun for personal defense. Keep in mind that this happened after I was held at gunpoint in Argentina, and nearly killed. I started looking into guns and trying various guns out, but I never actually made a purchase. I did borrow that gun for a few days and played around with it, and had alot of fun playing with a pistol that use actual shotgun shells!    Huckstah is 100% honest. That's why his boss bought him[4] a plane ticket to hawaii as a bonus. Or did he buy it himself[5] ?   This would depend on which trip to hawaii you are referring to. I have been to Hawaii a total of 3 times, 2 different islands. I work on coffee farms on the big island, and I worked at a travelers hostel in Oahu. The first time I went to Hawaii, my boss in Bellingham, Washington gave me a bonus christmas check for working on his bamboo farm. He paid for my ticket to Hawaii, and he actually sent me to his sisters farm in Ocean View, Hawaii. That was in 2006, if I remember correctly. I went back to Hawaii again in 2010, and then again in 2013. The tickets are only 250 bucks one-way from LAX, and so I usually buy them after doing a few weeks of dishwashing at a restaurant, construction work, or whatever job I can find on craigslist. Even a hobo like myself can afford a cheapo plane ticket.    He doesn't do drugs[6] That's why there's pictures of him on instagram with marijuana and cocaine[7]    Haha, well first of all, I've only done cocaine a total of like 4 or 5 times in my life. I don't consider that a drug addiction, or that I'm an active drug user. That little bitty bag of cocaine was given to me by someone that liked my traveling stories and just gave it to me as a gift. I was kinda thrown off a bit when he put it in my hand, thinking it was going to be weed (I was in Colorado)...so I was a bit shocked to see it was cocaine. Anyway, I split it with a friend and we each did a small line after drinking a few beers. It was pretty low quality and we barely felt a buzz.  As for the marijuana, I don't consider it a drug. Yes I do use marijuana, on a daily basis. I'm definitely guilty of that!   Huck is a hobo who works jobs[8] That's why the same instagram has pictures of him bragging about how much money he gets for panhandling.   Haha yes and no. I do work alot of jobs...farms, construction, fishing, hostels, temp work, seasonal labor, etc. Some of the jobs pay good, some pay terrible. Also, sometimes I will be inbetween towns/jobs and I'll run out of money, or need money fast for emergency gear or traveling. Yes, I have flown signs at medians. If you compare how many times I've panhandled as opposed to how much I've worked, I would guestimate that I panhandle about 10% of the time, and work the other 90%. I rarely have to panhandle, and it always sucks when I do. But hey, if you can't find a job, or run out of money, and some bum steals your sleeping bag, you gotta start finding a quick way to purchase it, and panhandling will work if you are in a bind.   He's a nice guy. That's why he thinks black people smoke crack[9] and calling them darkeys is funny[10] .    Haha you do realize what sub I posted that in, right? It's meant for satire, and I was being completely satirical to follow along with the humor of the subreddit. Jesus dude, do you even Reddit? Do you lift, brah? Pulling shit out of /r/imgoingtohellforthis is one of your actual pieces of evidence? This is just laughable...  For the record, I do not hate black people, or any other minority. I'm actually a progressive leaning socialist, and I sympathize very deeply with minorities, including african-americans, muslims, homosexuals, transgenders, and women's rights.    He's been caught lying on the internet before[11] .   Haha I wasn't lying! I got busted reposting my original post. If you look at my submission history, you'll see where I am the original OP of this picture! That is actually my uncles arm in the picture! So, no, I didn't get busted in a lie. I got busted making a repost of my original content.   The story changes when he posts in subreddits[12] and experienced people question his gear and pack size he just changes the story[13] .   I don't even know exactly what you are accusing me for here. Are you claiming I change my story? Well, I haven't...I have the same story I always have. I don't get what evidence you're seemingly pointing at here or how it proves I've changed my story or whatever.  Sidenote: You, along with another Redditor, have been trolling/stalking my account, constantly making false accusations against.   Here is an example of one of your posts in which one of your co-haters made completely false accusations against me:  Exhibit A (false accusations to slander my credibility)  I was able to easily prove those comments wrong, just as I will be now proving you wrong.   If your case against me is that I am not a hobo that travels on freight-trains, here is proof:  Exhibit B: (Proof that I am a hobo that rides freight-trains)  Exhibit C: (Proof that Reddit admins of AMA have confirmed my lifestyle and credibility)  Based on this evidence, I ask that this case be dismissed against me. I do live on the road, and I do hop freight trains, as I have shown valid evidence to prove such. The prosecutions case has been proven irrelelvant, circumstantial, misleading, and erroneous. They have failed to prove their case against mine, and top comments have suggested that this case be dismissed by default.  END NOTE TO OP / PLAINTIFF /u/LTrembleau: You are seemingly obsessed with me to a degree that is rather frightening/psychotic/creepy. You have now also posted this slander in other subreddits that I subscribe too, titling your posts with slander, calling me a dangerous liar, among other things. This is like the 3rd or 4th time you have done this, and it always gets deleted by the mods. And now taking me to karmacourt? Wow...  Why are you so obsessed with discrediting a homeless traveler? I have friends on Reddit that are homeless travelers just like me, and I have lived on the road with them. I could summon their names and drag them into this circus court, but why do that? Why do I have to PROVE anything to one person that is seemingly obsessed with me? This is just absolutely ridiculous, and I should seriously not even reply this crap, and just mark you off a troll. However, I will defend my integrity and my lifestyle, and you will be proven wrong."

Without wasting any more time, I'd like to declare this  KarmaWitchery Trial Thread  Open  The prosecution has the floor.  Lawyer away.  Notice: The prosecution has been missing long enough and no replacement has been found.  Case dismissed  Goes to private chamber and starts sobbing.  Smacks Gavel"
KarmaCourt,2xu4o8,BruceXavier,1 point,Thu Mar 5 11:26:17 2015 UTC,"Good morning your honor.  I would like to begin with the examination of Exhibit A. After reviewing many of the posts of the defendant, I have found that a majority of them do in fact contain signs of witchcraft. The defendants posts are also nonsensical and confusing for the OP. Also, there is a level of Douchebaggery that the defendant displays, as shown by the defendant, as evident in Exhibits A and D. Therefore, I conclude that the defendant has used his warlock powers to coerce the masses to go along with the content of his posts."
KarmaCourt,2xu4o8,mzun2496,3,Thu Mar 5 14:30:59 2015 UTC,"What?!?!  /u/navbot is evolving!!   Congratulations your /u/navbot has evolved into.......  /u/navbot?!?!?!?!?  Complete silence form the crowd  Your Honor,  The defense is sorry about the slow reply, since it was at work when the prosecution started its case. The defense is also updating its argument style to make it slightly easier for you you honor. Now with out more delay let us start the  Opening Statement  It seems that /r/karmacourt really has reached a new low. Everywhere around the world, we are trying to push more freedoms of opinion in every corner of the earth, yet here we are. My client is only stating his opinion, whats wrong with that? Everyone has the right to say and express themselves freely. How is my client hurting anybody, If the viewers really feel offended, that's their problem, they decided to read it. The prosecution has almost no evidence at all. All they have is the accounts of the comments which is all public knowledge. They do not really prove much of anything, except these comments are made. The prosecution does not know the reason behind them all. Perhaps the defendant is kidnapped and he is send a secret messages. Perhaps he is a being of higher understanding, perhaps he is mentally ill and this is his way of coping, we truly do not know. These Ideas are much more understandable then blasted ""witchcraft"".  Regarding the CHARGE: DOYOUEVENLIFTBRO and the CHARGE: WITCHCRAFT  The defense does not even believe that the charge ""doyouevenliftbro"" has any merit in this case, what the heck does this mean? The defense wants the prosecution to DROP THIS CHARGE RIGHT AWAY.  Now to address the witchcraft charge, my client is obviously male judging by his comments. A male version of a witch is not a warlock, definitely not a witch but is a wizard. Now wizards are awesome people, the defense even knows a few, such as my main man Dumbledore. Who's to say hes not the same? Lets see what Google has to say about the definition ""witchcraft"":  the practice of magic, especially black magic; the use of spells and the invocation of spirits.           Did my client do this? the plaintiff must be mistaken, I see no black magic, the plaintiff is only calling it witchcraft because he does not understand it, The defense wants the prosecution to DROPS THIS CHARGE RIGHT AWAY.  Some General Reasons for Innocence  In a thousand years, they might even be reading his comments as pure literature in English classes saying its a work of art. Back in the day, Homer probably was not very popular, people were probably like:  ""Who the hell is that?""  ""I don't know just some troll""  I obviously did not write that in Latin, but you get the jest. Now Homer is praised as pure gold, what if hes the next Shakespeare? people wont realize it before its too late. He might just be someone of a higher intellectual way of thinking, people hate it only because they don't understand it. Just because most people in school don't understand gold like Shakespeare people they hate it, as simple as that.  The Evidence:  I would like to show you the prosecutions evidence:  Exhibit A-  in this we can see his higher intellectual way of thinking. We can also see that he has 1075 karma. We can also see that his account was made 8 months ago which proves that it is not a throwaway. This means that some people understand him and his ways of thinking. the defendant has a very philosophical vibe which does not have to be a bad thing. He is voicing his opinion and that is completely fine.   My client is charged with contempt, how would you feel being called worthless? Everyone is deserving of being heard, and this is exactly what the defendant was trying to do. what kind of a charge is that? The defense is very tempted to tell the prosecution to drop this charge, except for it is more realistic and not as stupid compared to the other ones.  The defense will talk about the other blasted charges and how they are not relevant later, otherwise we would be here all night.  People hate change, people hate people that are different, well the defense is here to tell you that being different is not necessarily a bad thing.  The defense says good luck backing up your charges, to the prosecution.  Thank you your honor."
KarmaCourt,2xu4o8,Navbot,2,Thu Mar 5 22:44:29 2015 UTC,"A witch! A witch!  Wait... a warlock? That is different. I thought this case was previously about witchcraft. There is no crime for being a warlock. Aleister Crowley was a warlock and he even got Ozzy to sing a song about him. That is kind of cool. Witches, on the other hand, need to be burned. If we had a witch then we could have a witchhunt. Just sayin'."

KarmaCourt,2xrtfq,BruceXavier,1 point,Wed Mar 4 13:36:07 2015 UTC,"It is better to reply with delete, for the same reason I didn't make him just delete the post:  Right now he's written so he doesn't need a database for anything, which means he tells whether he should post in a thread by seeing if any of the comments are from him. So if I made him delete the post, he would then see he hadn't commented yet, so he'd just do it again.  EDIT: Unless if removing a post still leaves it visible for the author. I think I've seen that happen before, but I'm not sure."

KarmaCourt,2xrtfq,Thimoteus,3,Tue Mar 3 13:46:24 2015 UTC,Where does it say anything about the 31st? Where in the constitution does it say anything about this thread?  Nowhere. AFAIK
KarmaCourt,2xrtfq,BruceXavier,2,Wed Mar 4 13:32:57 2015 UTC,"It does not say anymore. It does not say anything about constitutional amendment threads anymore, as well, though. So I suggest these follow a certain ""tradition"" or a time-honoured, ancient and accepted custom of the court. And that custom seems to be based on the historic constitution Art. V. § B. which in the final revision stated, that Mods will ""post to the court on the final day of any month with 31 days"" but only after the events cited in the historic scroll I was shown by Mr. Deja Vu. Before that, it said ""once every 31st of a month"", which made me think at the end of last year's February, whether that was every last day of a month or anything else. And I concluded on March 3rd that year it was about the 31st of each month and we'd best borrow one or a few days from the next, if the current doesn't have a 31st."

KarmaCourt,2xrtfq,Thimoteus,2,Tue Mar 3 15:24:51 2015 UTC,What is that place? You should do a better job of promoting it and it doesn't seem to get updated too often.
KarmaCourt,2xrtfq,Kell08,2,Tue Mar 3 15:27:07 2015 UTC,"It was a project to reference all cases, for example to use for precedent.  As far as I know nobody used it.

My recommendation is that you get certified based on the cases you have won. 3 for defense, 3 for prosecution. And then you have to message the Justicars and tell them that you read some stuff (like porn and Wikipedia articles on duck penises and the like).  Edit: actually make that 1 for defense.

KarmaCourt,2x9467,Wolfdragoon97,6,Sun Mar 1 02:12:43 2015 UTC,"""Cracks Knuckles""   Your Honor,   Sorry for the slightly late response, as the prosecution was out on errands when when It was added as the main attorney.  /u/mysinsmakeme and his other alternate accounts are guilty of the following charge:      CHARGE: Multiple account shilling.  From the very small amount of time that the prosecution has known known the plaintiff, it can quite easily see that the plaintiff is a genuinely nice person. /u/neiliusAntitribu did not just make this case for laughs and giggles, he believes that there is something else going on here. It is hard to tell how my client has made such a fierce enemy of the defendant, from all the comments that the prosecution viewed of the plaintiff, all the comments were sincere and straight from the heart. Now, what kind of grudge does the defendant hold against my client?  It is quite easy to see that the defendant, /u/mysinsmakeme, /u/notgivingupfitness or whatever he goes by these days, has set out to hurt my client in any way possible. My client can't even browse Reddit without the fear of being made fun of or trolled by /u/notgivingupfitness. It seems that the plaintiff has this case as a last resort to catch the true fiend that was responsible, and that is exactly what the prosecution tends to do.  If you view Exhibit A, my client was getting harassed by an certain deleted account repeatedly,which the prosecution is assume was /u/notgivingupfitness with no clear reason on why it was happening. All of a sudden, a certain /u/mysinsmakeme comes out of no where and continues the exact same trolling spree that was happening before. Is the plaintiff really that bad that two different people believe that he deserves trolling? if they really were, were they communicating on what to do? How DID /u/mysinsmakeme know what to do? The answer is simple your honor, the only explanation is that /u/mysinsmakeme and /u/notgivingupfitness are the same person. The defendant wanted for my client to believe that there were multiple people hounding him, with no real motives or reasons for that matter.   There have been many other cases of internet bullying, first it starts out as a mere annoyance and when it keeps on happening, it gets worse and worse. There have been couple of accounts were this has actually lead to suicide. The prosecution is relieved that the plaintiff enlisted its help before he too goes over the edge. Your honor, this is very serious issue that could actually mean LIFE OR DEATH. This is not an game anymore, if this continues, the defendant could be faced with real charges. In some countries this is really illegal, but I suggest we end this here before it gets out of control.  The defendant clearly has a personal vendetta for my client. He has been downvoting all my clients comments, without no clear reason. The only person who can answer the  ""why"" this is the defendant himself. If we view the defendants history, we can see that he is a young student, I too was like the defendant. At one point of my life I also thought that this kind thing was funny. As my mind matured, I realized how wrong this is and sooner or later, so will the defendant.   The prosecution trust you will take this mater seriously and deal with the defendant properly.  The prosecution is also eagerly waiting its colleague that will help, If not all is well."
KarmaCourt,2x9467,Navbot,7,Sun Mar 1 19:57:02 2015 UTC,"Your honour,  Sorry for the delayed response to the prosecution as the defence too was running an errand when the prosecution happened to open there case.  Anyway now that we are all here I would like to begin by saying that pumping air into your brain makes you think faster.Now I know that this is no fact but I did blow your mind.  Alright, that aside I would like to begin.  Opening Statement  Well then your honour, the defence would like to present some evidence of its own:  Defence Exhibit A The profile of my client which shows that they have been a Redditor for over a year and have near 6000 joint karma.  Defence Exhibit B Where the plaintiff got into the argument with the deleted redditor, who may or may not be /u/notgivingupfitness. This clearly shows that the plaintiff jumped the gun with little to no knowledge of the matter at hand.  Defence Exhibit C Where in the plaintiff provokes the deleted redditor who then reacts by proceeding to have the last word.  All this evidence that the defence has presented to the court raises some questions:  Question 1 Is the defendant really the same person as the deleted redditor (who the plaintiff claims is /u/notgivingupfitness)?  Question 2 Is the plaintiff an innocent bystander during the Sanfermines or his he a full fledged matador?  Now I would like to request the prosecution to come worth and answer these important questions.  Thank you, your honour."
KarmaCourt,2x9467,BruceXavier,4,Mon Mar 2 00:23:38 2015 UTC,"Your honor,  To answer the defenses first question, the prosecution does believe that they are the same redditor. If you view previous /u/mysinsmakeme's comments, there is an indication that he is in fact a college student. There is even some comments where he directly says the words ""Thank You"" which shows his Canadian patriotism. In another comment he mentions that he failed this X and Y course proving that he is indeed a student going to college, and his well off grammar proves that he is either an law or English major. This directly correlates with the defenses third piece of evidence, where the comment says that he is in fact a law student. This comment in the defenses evidence was said by an deleted account, and it seems that both the deleted account and /u/mysinsmakeme are both students in college taking law. The plaintiff mentioned that the defendant was a Canadian law student, yet had way more run ins with the deleted account. This means that the plaintiff knew /u/notgivingupfitness better, yet /u/mysinsmakeme follows the exact same description. Many people have main and secondary and even tertiary accounts, whose to say that the defendant doesn't?   If this isn't enough proof, both people seemed to harassing the same account, the exact same way. Out all the thousands of threads that are created daily on Reddit, both accounts find the same tread, and proceed to bully the same redditor? What did /u/mysinsmakeme have against the plaintiff?The deleted account and the plaintiff were the ones facing off, why did /u/mysinsmakeme jump in and harass the prosecutions client too? How could two completely different people both have a personal vendetta on the same person and humiliate him the exact same way? The only answer here is they are both operated by the same fiend.  Now to answer the defenses second question. The prosecution would like to agree that its client was a little out of line in some of the defenses evidence. The prosecution would like to say this; how would you feel if you were getting harassed repeatedly? You would be very angry, and trying to find who was doing this. This is obviously what the plaintiff was doing before he created this case. As I mentioned before, this is very case, is a last resort for the plaintiff, it was this or bust. What else is the plaintiff going to do? does he just stop browsing his favorite site to go on in his free time? If the defendant wins, the plaintiff will slowly stop using Reddit, in fear of getting bullied and/or harassed, or something even worse could happen.  Your honor, you have a chance to stop this situation from escalating into something else entirely. The prosecution has seen people in /u/NeiliusAntitribu's position before, and it did not end well.   That is what I call mind blowing.  Thank you, your honor."
KarmaCourt,2x9467,Navbot,3,Mon Mar 2 02:26:54 2015 UTC,"Your honour,  The defence believes that the evidence that the prosecution has presented against my client is completely circumstantial.  The defence also believes that the plaintiff has a bigger role in all of this than they claim to have.  Saying this, we would like to call the plaintiff /u/NeiliusAntitribu to the stand and have them answer our questions."
KarmaCourt,2x9467,BruceXavier,4,Mon Mar 2 14:49:18 2015 UTC,"Your Honor, and Mr BruceXavier,  I am here today to answer your questions to the best of my abilities. I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."
KarmaCourt,2x9467,BruceXavier,3,Mon Mar 2 17:11:16 2015 UTC,"Alright then Mr. NeiliusAntitribu,  now that you're under oath please tell the court about how the argument between you and the deleted Redditor began."
KarmaCourt,2x9467,BruceXavier,3,Mon Mar 2 17:17:57 2015 UTC,I commented about my understanding of trespass law and process.  If I had to guess it started exactly here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2qj0l4/drunk_guy_tries_to_sit_on_a_bike_sign_doesnt_end/cn6qlf7
KarmaCourt,2x9467,Navbot,3,Mon Mar 2 17:38:17 2015 UTC,"Good.  Now please tell the court whether you called that deleted Redditor an ""illiterate piece of eurotrash""."
KarmaCourt,2x9467,BruceXavier,4,Mon Mar 2 17:49:01 2015 UTC,"I believe after /u/notgivingupfitness misread ""Minnesota"" as ""Missouri"" in my statutes citation, and before I recognized him as actually being Canadian; yes I did call him that here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2qj0l4/drunk_guy_tries_to_sit_on_a_bike_sign_doesnt_end/cncusid"
KarmaCourt,2x9467,Navbot,4,Mon Mar 2 18:06:38 2015 UTC,"Your honor,  The prosecution believes the defenses evidence is just as circumstantial as the prosecutions. The prosecution is also willing to show its evidence to defense if they don't trust the merit of the prosecution.   It would also be beneficial to both parties if the defendant was summoned for questioning as well. The prosecution believe the evidence shows exactly what is going on here, if the plaintiff really is guilty one here, why did he even create this case? The defenses accusations against my client holds absolutely no merit and makes no sense, according to all the evidence.  There is also a new piece of information, if you view Exhibit C. This is were the defendant directly says that he is a law student, which directly correlates with the defenses piece of evidence, where the deleted user also says he is a law student. This proves that both users are law students, which hammers done the prosecution's proof that they are both indeed the same person."
KarmaCourt,2x9467,BruceXavier,3,Mon Mar 2 15:16:49 2015 UTC,"Your honour, the defence still believes that the plaintiff should come to the stand for cross-examination. If they refuse to do so then the prosecution may continue with their case."
KarmaCourt,2x9467,Navbot,3,Mon Mar 2 15:41:56 2015 UTC,"Your honor,  The prosecution believes that both the plaintiff and defendant should come up to the stand for questioning, if a party is summoned over the other, it could possibly create an unfair advantage for the prosecution  or the defense, because each party will be biased towards their own preferred attorney.  The prosecution would prefer to have as fair of a trial as possible."
KarmaCourt,2x9467,Wolfdragoon97,3,Mon Mar 2 16:56:41 2015 UTC,The defence shall try to get the defendant to the stand. But we still wish to question the prosecution.

KarmaCourt,2x9467,Navbot,2,Tue Mar 3 17:53:38 2015 UTC,Well that's sad.  I am sure someone will take this up.

KarmaCourt,2x9467,IceBlade03,5,Wed Mar 4 01:22:42 2015 UTC,"Ladies and gentlemen of the court!  Our presiding judge, the honourable /u/wolfdragoon97, has been unfortunately iunjred recently, and in his absence, I will be acting as judge for this case from now on.  I have read over this case file and have come to a verdict. To the single charge pressed, the court finds the defenant:  Guilty!  However, shilling is a secondary crime here on Reddit, which means it cannot be charged in my court unless another crime is pressed with it. So, there is No sentence!  Court dismissed!  Have a nice day, friends of the court."
KarmaCourt,2x9467,Thimoteus,4,Wed Mar 4 06:34:14 2015 UTC,What is this like a win win scenario?
KarmaCourt,2x9467,IceBlade03,3,Wed Mar 4 12:37:29 2015 UTC,"Your honor I would like to object,  Just because a robbery of convenience store,  is a secondary crime compared to something like rape or murder, does not mean it should be overlooked. All crimes should be considered the same no matter if it is a simple shoplifting or someone life hangs in the balance. The sentence might be different but, they all should be considered equally.  The only reason the prosecution did not add any more charges was, because it would of added an extra depth to already complex case with multiple variables. This case was way longer then it should of been and would not of made sense to add more charges.  The persecution  also felt that they should honor the plaintiff decision to only have one charge.  The persecution felt that it was not its place to add more charges when they should be worrying more of proving the defendant guilty of it, which was already a hard task in itself.   ""If you can't prosecute, just add more charges""  The prosecution does not believe in that statement, it was to prosecute him of that charge that the was given to us, not just delay the inevitable."
KarmaCourt,2x9467,Thimoteus,3,Wed Mar 4 12:53:45 2015 UTC,"Objection noted. However, I don't think that you realise what a secondary crime is. It wouldn't be a robbery compared to a murder or rape, it would be speeding 4 miles over the speed limit compared to a DUI charge.   And may it please the prosecution, the defendant was indeed found guilty. However the sentence for shilling is nonexistent on it's own.  Thank you for your dedication and service to Justice, may we meet in the courts again."
KarmaCourt,2x9467,IceBlade03,2,Wed Mar 4 14:37:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you your honor,  I hope we meet again, best regards."

Prosecution makes opening statement first, then defence makes opening statement. Prosecution presents points and defence rebuts, then defence presents points and prosecution rebuts. Continue until all points have been made, and then rest your cases.   Fight!  Edit: The verdict"
KarmaCourt,2wpgty,Lemetroll,4,Sun Feb 22 18:17:27 2015 UTC,"Your Honor,  The defendant is guilty of all charges he is being accused of, which are:  CHARGE: karmatheft.jpg  CHARGE: Cat-Theft  CHARGE: Lying to the Internet  Please look at Exhibit A through C up above to follow along.  /u/mediaonline's account was only made about 5 days ago, yet has acquired a very impressive amount of karma. /u/mr_mia is just one of the defendants long list of victims, is his chaotic posting spree in the last 5 days. Out of all the posts /u/mediaonline could steal, he decides to take a photo of a innocent cat, taking away /u/mr_mia's  chance to share that picture ever again. Its /u/mr_mia's post, he should be able to share it as he pleases. The defendant is the reason why it is so hard to provide original content.  /u/mediaonline has been reposting indiscriminately for the sole purpose of hoarding karma. The defendant has made 24 posts of old content that everyone who browses reddit, has probably seen before. /u/mediaonline has made absolutely no comments, which is a indicator that his account was made for karma and nothing else. The defendant has even been claiming cake day on /r/trees, which in it itself should be a new charge all together.  It is people like this that give reddit a bad name, it is people like this that plague the internet like a disease. It is sad to say that there are many more like him, but here your Honor, is one of them before you. I suggest you show him no mercy to show his kind a lesson, a lesson that they will never forget. Although getting rid of one diseased cell may be a small victory compared to thousands, its still a victory all the same. All this work for fake internet points baffles me, /u/mr_mia deserves justice for all the other victims out there. As someone who has been a redditor for more than a year, I have grown sick and tired of his kind, and so have many people out there. If /u/mediaonline wins, why are we all here? If he wins,  they all win.  I have faith that you will make quick work of the defendant."
KarmaCourt,2wpgty,Lemetroll,3,Sun Feb 22 19:02:12 2015 UTC,"It's show time folks:  Your Honor/Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury  The evidence against my client is extremely convincing, however I only see evidence which implicates him in two of the crimes: Karmatheft.jpg and cat stealing. The prosecution just came out of no where accusing him of lying without any proof. Unless proof is delivered I request the prosecution to remove the charge  Please consider this, do you remember being new to reddit? Having no karma? Do you remember being ridiculed, every time you respond in a way someone doesn't like your karma being mentioned? Well I do.   Did you ever look at all the successful posts with 4k up votes and 5k comments and wonder how they did it? Then you see a post and read to comments to see one says 'Repost' and then you hatch an idea.  Now you may say that karma is just 'stupid internet points' but clearly to my defendant it was much more, and he felt the need to steal cats in order to get his hands of some of this real sticky-icky icky.  So your honor and jury do consider this and my great references when passing on your justice.  Also borliff could you summon the defendant?"
KarmaCourt,2wpgty,Professor_Doodles,5,Sun Feb 22 22:08:24 2015 UTC,"Your Honor if I may,  The defense says that there is no real evidence of the third charge, which is lying to the internet. Reposting is in fact, a form of lying one way or the other.  When first joining reddit, I would assume that all post I saw were original, but as I began to see more and more posts I realized that not all of it was original content so to say. If the viewer has never seen the post before, they automatically assume that this is an original post, when in fact this is not true at all. This is by a certain degree, lying to the viewer that they are the original poster. I never saw /u/mr_mia original post, therefore if I came across the defendants repost of the cute cat, I would assume this was original.  The defence may say that this was just a bad assumption, but the core idea of reddit was a for original content creating website, in which most users assume that is the truth.  If this was a cross post, people would have reacted significantly better to this. The defendant decided to do a repost instead, claiming that the post was in fact his, even though that is not the case.This why i choose not to remove the third charge because it is true on some extent. If /u/mediaonline asked op for permission, we wouldn't have to be here right now.  My other evidence of the third charge that he was saying it was his cake day on /r/trees. This information came from an eye witness by the name of /u/electrophile91 . We all know that eye witness's can be very shady, but I felt that it should be noted because of the possibility it being true.  I very much do remember being new to reddit, but I don't believe that is the case here. /u/mediaonline had to of had previous knowledge of the /u/mr_mia's post to be able to think of repost it. Out of all the posts he could of reposted, why /u/mr_mia? Is it just bad luck that has befallen him? I dont believe that is the case here."
KarmaCourt,2wpgty,Lemetroll,2,Sun Feb 22 23:06:10 2015 UTC,"Your Honor  As the prosecution stated reposting is lying however did the defendant say at any time the cat is his? Would you consider posting a link a article reposting? Do users ask permission before posting a link In the post he didn't not say 'meet my cat' he said 'meet me mia'  Did he just copy a post? Yes, but you have to take into account the account is only 5 days old. I doubt the spend more than a couple of hours on reddit and wouldn't be familiar with terms such as x-post and the difference between reposting.  As for the cake day offense, it's a 5 day old account, do you think he knows what a cake days is? I remember thinking it was my actual birthday for a good couple of months   Now I'll deal with the last point, wherever the defendant didn't know what a repost is, he also did repost more than one person /u/mr_mia wasn't selectively picked. This is also irrelevant to him just wanting to get some karma and not realizing what a repost is.  Also can the defendant and victims both be summoned."
KarmaCourt,2wpgty,Navbot,3,Sun Feb 22 23:39:28 2015 UTC,"Your Honor,  What the defence is saying, is if you don't know the crime you are committing then you are not guilty of it, which is not in fact the case. if you didn't know what murder was, yet you still committed it, then you are still guilty. There is no difference here, The defendant reposted here, even if he still did no what he was doing, /u/mediaonline still did it, therefore he is still guilty of it.  It really took me a few weeks to learn all the proper terms of reddit when I first joined. The defendant had to have had previous knowledge of all that reddit has to offer. Most people new to reddit don't know what reposting is, I can agree there. New redditors would most likely make original posts compared to reposts. If the defendant was truly new to reddit, he wouldn't know what karma is never mind how it works and how to get it.  Karma is a very complex system where sometimes you get karma sometimes you don't. Even I sometimes get confused about karma, sometimes I get more points than I should, sometimes I get less.   For the defendant to be that familiar with reddit and the karma system, there has to be previous knowledge. This supports my point about him making his account solely for karma and nothing else.  It would be very helpful to have both the defendant and the victims to clarify the many assumptions me and the defence are making."

KarmaCourt,2wpgty,Thimoteus,2,Mon Feb 23 10:22:08 2015 UTC,"I do have to agree, this is getting very boring and we should rap this up soon. I don't think the victim and defendant will be coming so i'll try to make this quick (and no im not switching languages).  Karma may seem like a relatively easy system, when you upvote, it gets higher karma but doesn't always happen. One point is not equal to one karma and if you go to a specific account and you downvote, it does not affect their points. These are just some of the things that make the karma system so complicated.  This redditor knows the way of the game, what to repost and when.  The defendant is obviously experienced, getting so much karma in very little time. Do you think someone new could accomplish that?  /u/mediaonline has just gained 2000 comments in a matter of a few hours with his reposting ways.   The defendant is clearly guilty of all charges, I hope the judge can see that."
KarmaCourt,2wpgty,youtubefactsbot,2,Mon Feb 23 02:23:33 2015 UTC,"Your Honor  The prosecution keeps insisting that the defendant is experienced with reddit, however wherever karma is a complicated it is very clear that the more points you get the higher your karma. Personally I don't understand fully how it works.  Is reposting really that hard, it requires no skill to just sort a subreddit by top and copy the link and title. Not all of his posts we're very successful and he often got called out. The prosecution keeps insisting that the defendant is an experience reposter, however if that was the case I'd assume the defendant would change the link and titles of his posts to not get caught  As this is going in a circle the defense will rest. So your honor will you convict a man of catstealing and straight up lying when he did neither is posting a picture of someone else's cat a crime? Did he claim mr mia is his? as for the cake day do you think a 5 day old redditor knows what a cake day? The answer to these questions is no the verdict should also be not guilty  And now the main charge karmatheft the defendant is not one of those shameless karma white who'll repost after a day, instead the main post mentioned was posted a year ago, all he did was find a picture of a cute cat and share it with the world. Is that a crime? No, your honor it's not. I do hope you will realize this and find the defendant not guilty of any of the charges  The defense rests, unless both parties appear."
KarmaCourt,2wpgty,Professor_Doodles,1 point,Mon Feb 23 10:20:54 2015 UTC,"Your Honor,  The defence says that reposting is not a crime, technically that is true. Technically all the charges are fake and we are just here for laughs and giggles. Technically speaking this entire trial does not even mean anything, which is also true. That being said, the Prosecution does believe that there is some merit in this case. This subreddit was created to keep redditors in line and that still is what we intend to do.  The defence says there is no harm in reposted, how would the defence feel if their own pictures and links got stolen, being claimed by someone else? If there is no true harm in reposted, then we would not be here. Because I am here before you today, typing this out is standing proof that reposting is harmful. Is reposting easy? Indeed it is. Robbing someone is also easy to do, intimidate them, get their cash and go. Just because it is easy, doesn't mean it is not illegal. I would also like to point out that The defense also contradicted itself by saying that they do not understand the karma system, even though he was trying to say that it is simple. If someone who has been using reddit for 3 years does not understand it, how would some  know after for five days?  The defendant has obviously used reddit before. The more the defense argues, the more evidence we get that the defendant made his account for karma, and karma only.  The Prosecution stands by its decision that the defendant, /u/mediaonline is guilty of all three charges. How many people are like this on reddit? The answer, too many. With this case your Honor, you can stop one of them. The Prosecution believes that this in itself is worth it. Like I mentioned before, a small victory, is a victory all the same. The evidence convicting /u/mediaonline is all here, i've seen this case many times, and I hope the Judge can see it as well. What about /u/mr_mia and all the other victims dont they deserve justice? If /u/mediaonline wins, why are we even here? Is someone who is clearly done it, and is not convicted, I might as well not picked up this case. If he win, THEY all win.  The Prosecution rest your Honor, unless both parties appear.  I have faith you will make the right decision your Honor."

The charges of willfull deception and liarliarpantsonfire don't stick, cause the defendant told the truth as soon as he was questioned about. However, posting not a picture of the actual person quoting, but a picture of the persons sister makes it appear she said the quote."

Now as has been brought to our notice here the quote was made not by that girl in the picture but some guy wearing a baseball cap who happens to be the brother of the girl in the picture.  Now, as we see here the OP (aka the defendant) also knew about this before posting that quote. Thus, your honour, the prosecution would like to charge the defendant with   WILLFULL DECEPTION FOR THE PURPOSES OF GAINING KARMA LIARLIARPANTSONFIRE.EXE MISATTRIBUTION IN THE FIRST DEGREE KARMAWHORING   Thank you, your honour."
KarmaCourt,2wgogq,BruceXavier,4,Fri Feb 20 23:42:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry all accidentally deleted my reply  My client is good  He only used a little  creative license.  Opening Statement  Your honor, and the good people of reddit, my client is a creative spirit.  /u/Icecube404 wanted to tell a story. A compelling story who's medium is of words and a picture.  My client did not misattribute the quote. The name of the boy is clearly in the quote photo.  Your honor, with your permission the defense would like to provide the following evidence.  Defense Exhibit A  You will see your honor that there are no good pictures of the young man.  My client wanted to show a compelling quotation while having a powerful picture. My client tried to stay as true to the story as possible. But like all art it requires a little creative license.  My client did not deceive anyone your honor. He tried to entertain and enlighten."
KarmaCourt,2wgogq,moccasinroot,2,Sat Feb 21 07:05:36 2015 UTC,"You say that he  happened to use a little  creative licence.  Well I disagree.  Your honour, as can be seen by the comment in Exhibit A and also the ones here, here and here this henious act by the defendant caused confusion and spread misinformation among the good Redditors in /r/QuotesPorn.  Now the defence might argue that the defendant be allowed to do such things in the name of creative licence and that he   wanted to show a compelling quotation while having a powerful picture.   The fact remains that what OP was actually trying to do was get their hands on the sweet, sweet karma that the good people of /r/QuotesPorn had to offer.  Collective gasps from the gallery.  Yes you heard it right, the defendant is a karmawhore. He didn't care whether that picture spread misinformation among the Redditors he just cared about the karma.   The defendant deserves to be punished for his actions and I hope that the judge and jury will take note of this.  Thank you."
KarmaCourt,2wgogq,BruceXavier,2,Sat Feb 21 14:24:31 2015 UTC,"History is clear / not all photos are of the / quotation's author.  Your honor, there is no rule in /r/QuotesPorn stating the image of the quotation's author is required.    In fact, a quick look at /r/QuotesPorn top of all submissions show that many Redditors have used images that did not show the quotation's author.  With the courts permission I would like to submit the following evidence:   DEFENSE EXHIBIT B  DEFENSE EXHIBIT C  The rules of /r/QuotePorn states the following:   If you created the composition yourself, you can signify this by using the tag [OC] (original content)   My client did in fact put the [OC] tag showing that the submission was a composition.   Your honor, /r/QuotesPorn allows creative license for quotations and my client followed the rules appropriately. He did not try to deceive or be a karmawhore. My client admitted that the quote was from the girl's brother and properly attributed the quote. He followed the submission rules appropriately and there is ample evidence in Defense Exhibit B to show that the image does not require an image of the author.  My client is innocent and client's only crime is being a stickler for the rules.  he defense rests your honor."

Comes back and starts talking.  Your honour, it is true that /r/QuotesPorn has no rule stating the image of the quotation's author is required; it is also true that /r/KarmaCourt doesn't exist to enforce the rules of other subreddits.  The constitution says   Karma is worth something   and the defendant gained karma by spreading confusion and misinformation among the good people of Reddit subscribed to /r/QuotesPorn. This means that the defendant cared more about their own karma than about their fellow Redditors. This disgraceful act is what we call karmawhoring and thus I urge you to uphold the spirit of the constitution and serve karma justice.  This, your honour, was the prosecution's closing statement and the defence may make their own. We still reserve the right to correct the defence on the mistakes, if any, in their subsequent statement(s).  The prosecution rests, for now."
KarmaCourt,2wgogq,BruceXavier,2,Sat Feb 21 22:05:26 2015 UTC,"Closing Statement  The case is, ""The people of /r/QuotesPorn vs. /u/icecube404"" therefore it is the burden of the procecution to show that the people of /r/quotesporn  have been wronged or deceived.  But according their own rules they have not been wronged. I am not asking for your honor to enforce the rules of another subreddit, I was trying to demonstrate that my client acted in good faith and even clarified his reason for making a composition submission as shown in the Plaintiff's Exhibit A.  The prosecution has not shown beyond a shadow of a doubt that my client did anything wrong. My client:  *appropriately attributed the quotation.  *put the [OC] tag to show it was a composition and not of the original author.  *At the first sign of confusion my client clarified his reason for the picture in the comments.  My client did everything right. The plaintiff has no case against my client because my client acted in good faith. If the plaintiff feels they have still been wronged it is not of the jurisdiction of /r/karmacourt and the plaintiff should take it to the mods of /r/quotesporn for allowing creativity.  Nothing further your honor. The defense waives any rights of reply and ask your honor to find my client innocent of all charges.

Is it just to punish a man who just wishes to follow a great man's footsteps?!  My client didn't do this for karma your honor, he did it because he was copying his role model, the plaintiff.  And I must say your honor, it is dissapointing to see a man in a position of influence such as the plaintiff turn around and attack the very people he influenced. THAT IS THE TRUE CRIME."

We, the users of KarmaCourt, at http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt , decree this charter document to which we are bound, drafted in the interest of protecting the enjoyability and originality of the website Reddit (http://www.reddit.com ) and all of its subsidiary subreddits through the satirical exposition of reported karma abuse and general contemptible actions heretofore identified as wrongdoing.   There was no crime of karma abuse here. The defendant acted out of passion, out of awe. I won't deny he copied it, that's undeniable. But woe betide those who claim my client did it for karma."

It is clear that the defendant was seeking Karma as he chose two succesful posts from the same exact subreddit at the exact same time 6 months ago. It is clear that the defendant sought karma at the expense of the original content of not only my client but also another unaware and innocent redditor. I propose that the defendant be punished for his karma whoring crimes as it is clear by his two posts that he was only interested in karma."

I was in no way notified or informed that /u/achin4baconbegs4eggs was wanting to repost my image and had he asked I MAY have been ok with it. But this was reposted without my knowledge and I was only made aware after a friend text message me asking if I was a bundle of sticks for reposting.  I was so disturbed by this that I was forced to immediately lay down and nap. This caused me to miss the gym, therefore losing gainz.  I am distraught, hurt, and have no idea where to go from here. I believe I may even need counseling.   I ask you, your honor, to please bring swift justice to the defendant for all the pain he has caused me, and for my loss of gainz."

If we teach our children that they can simply repost successful threads when they are low on karma, then how will they learn to think for themselves?!

KarmaCourt,2wddyg,panadolrapid,20,Thu Feb 19 00:53:48 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the judge just hands out the sentencing and the jury of peers make the conviction.
KarmaCourt,2wddyg,IceBlade03,8,Thu Feb 19 01:22:22 2015 UTC,"depends on the court, no? edit: and actually, I think the judge can overrule the jury decision too. I mean sure, it will get appealed and possibly overturned but I think they DO get the 'final' say."
KarmaCourt,2wddyg,afipanic,6,Thu Feb 19 00:06:16 2015 UTC,"Not really. At least in the US. A judge makings findings of law, whereas a jury makes findings of fact. So the judge decides that X evidence should or shouldn't be excluded, while the jury decides if X indicates the defendant's guilt. The judge sets the legal standards and the jury decides what actually happened and whether the legal standards for conviction are met. The judge can only throw out a jury verdict if he finds that no reasonable jury could have concluded as the jury did as a matter of law. Which is a crazy high standard and essentially never happens."
KarmaCourt,2wddyg,afipanic,3,Thu Feb 19 00:21:38 2015 UTC,What's jury nullification then? The jury thinks the person is guilty in terms of fact but not guilty enough to deserve punishment of law?
KarmaCourt,2wddyg,Jumba,6,Thu Feb 19 00:38:36 2015 UTC,"Two things: The Jury thinks the defendant is totally guilty, but shouldn't have to serve any punishments, or the lesser known version where the defendant is obviously innocent but they declare them guilty anyway.  CGP Grey has a good video on it."
KarmaCourt,2wddyg,knewreddituser,3,Thu Feb 19 00:43:56 2015 UTC,"Generally it's when the jury disagrees with the law itself. The judge can't overturn a not guilty verdict, so the defendant goes free despite being factually and legally guilty."

I'm defending the plaintiff /u/sbsaw and prosecuting the evil moderators or /r/Todayilearned.  We are gathered here today to witness justice. My client /u/sbsaw learned some great facts about candles and clocks and what not. He wanted to share these facts with the great people of /r/Todayilearned. However the evil and unjust moderators of the sub decided to brand his epic facts with the label of ""spam"".  Will we accept this?

I was born on a farm near Karma Town. We worked the soil to grow Karma and sell it to the main city, it was a hard life, but a fair life.  EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE of what is going on in this trial!  My clients are innocent and I Motion for acquital of my clients.  On basis that they're:   Young, wild and free (amendment 420)  and that the plaintiff has abandonned this courtroom to its fate, refused to heed our call/questions/bribes/threats and is also figuratively, metafiguratively and any adjective ending in -ly, DEAD."

You either get Karma or you get going. Now in my time I've seen many a folk do the wrong thing for the sake of some precious Karma. Ive seen reposters, hustlers, spammers, liars among many more Karma thieves.  My client is guilty of none of these crimes.  The mods of /r/todailearnd on the other hand see fit to take away hard earned karma. Karma gained by a completely valid post. Karma that is fair and true!  The moderators of /r/todailearned must learn the difference between Karma stolen and Karma earned fairly.   The mods of TIL might be young, wild, and free but by being sworn into mod-ship they promised to look after the Karma and make sure that it is handled in a fair and respectful manner given to only those who deserved it. Instead they decided to stop the Karma gain of my client.  The plaintiff is simply in recovery at this point and will hopefully join us shortly.

KarmaCourt,2w5l3t,DarthPlanet,2,Wed Feb 18 21:59:55 2015 UTC,"VERDICT  Now, I'm as easy as the next guy. I'm not like /u/Yankee_Candy_Poodle_Drop, who sometimes doesn't allow evidence because it's a picture. Pictures are fine! They're awesome! They're worth a thousand words, at least!  But in this case, the only evidence is a post (which apparently has been removed, since I can't find it except by clicking on a link) and an alleged copy+paste of the plaintiff's inbox. If we had a stenographer, I'd tell them to put on the record that the PM evidence barely makes up 1/10th of an image, and that's using the lowball estimate of words:image conversion! Therefore I cannot allow the alleged PM to influence this verdict as there is not enough evidence that it is real.  Regarding the first charge, that of ""Removed this Post without any charges, and called it a spam when it followed rules"", I must apply the world-famous simplification test to determine guilt. Whereas the post was removed without any reason that I can see, there is also no evidence that it was called spam. Neither /u/batty_boombatty nor /u/lana_is_my_cousin commented in the post in question, and the alleged PM is not allowed. Therefore, I can only conclude that the defendant is not guilty.  Regarding the second charge, that the defendant ""should be asked Why he call people spam and Why is he the only one that calls posts from blogs spam?"" I agree! Guilty, guilty guilty!  Regarding the third charge, Beijing Way Too Polite.tar, I haven't seen any evidence that the defendants are beijing way too polite. Therefore, not guilty.  Regarding the fourth charge, Giving away Karma_for_free.PROPER.DVD.(pal).FULL.avi, there is also no such evidence. Therefore not guilty!  SENTENCE  I order the defendant to be asked:  Why you call people spam and Why are you the only one that calls posts from blogs spam?  So someone go ask him that!  COURT IS ADJOURNED"

KarmaCourt,2w5l3t,TheGrandDalaiKarma,1 point,Mon Feb 23 11:17:09 2015 UTC,"Simplification:       In propositional logic, simplification    (equivalent to conjunction elimination and also called and elimination) is a valid immediate inference, argument form and rule of inference which makes the inference that, if the conjunction A and B is true, then A is true, and B is true. The rule makes it possible to shorten longer proofs by deriving one of the conjuncts of a conjunction on a line by itself.  An example in English:   It's raining and it's pouring.  Therefore it's raining.   The rule can be expressed in formal language as:     or as     where the rule is that whenever instances of """" appear on lines of a proof, either """" or """" can be placed on a subsequent line by itself.

You may see the evidences given on the court that this post is infact... A REPOST But, there's more. I've actually digged alot in this case on my absence; and the thing I saw... It was horrible...

No.  He was merely pointing out that the fact that cat paws are shaped like bears would make him never look at a cat paw the same way again.   Need I say more?

BEARS ARE NOT EVEN RELATED ON THIS CASE.    Also, in the defendant's title post, he clearly said ""MY CAT PAW"". Now I don't know what the hell your teacher taught you in elementary school, but that means ITS HIS PAW, IT MEANS HE'S TRYING TO SAY THAT HE IS A CAT PERSON, BUT WHAT HUMAN HAS CAT PAWS?!    Although, just like i said in my previous statement; we had gathered enough information that shows that it is not actually his paw and he IS NOT AN ACTUAL CAT PERSON, BUT MERELY AN IMPOSTOR AND A MEMBER OF A CAT IMPOSTING CLUB!.  DONT YOU FUCKING DARE TRY TO CHANGE THE DEFENDANT'S REASON ON WHY HE POSTED THE FRIGGING POST. DONT.  Try to find the bear Mr./u/CaptainNirvana It's just a wild-goose chase.

Your honor, he was simply making note of the fact that cat paws in general may look interesting if you look at them a certain way. Does any part of his post say that it was his cat paw in the picture? No.   The most you can accuse him for is bad grammar, and that''s not punishable.   The DEFENSE sits.   HYAH.

The prosecutor will reply to this comment, then the defense attorney will offer him a rebuttal, and so on.  Witnesses and experts can be produced too.    Verdict is here"
KarmaCourt,2vfzl9,TheGrandDalaiKarma,7,Tue Feb 10 20:40:54 2015 UTC,"May I please the court?  The most commonly used definition of satire is ""comedy meant to make a statement."" It is also the principle upon which this very court is based. When a satirical post was made,(and a satrircal sub along with it) meant to satirize the heated nature of debates concerning race issues in comics, the mods of /r/DCcomics banned the creator of the post and subreddit, perceiving this innocent satire as an insult on the member whose post was satirized. Could the title of the satiric post been better worded? Yes. No one will argue otherwise. But this seems a bit too rash. Why? Because A)they automatically assumed this was the case (and I'm sure we all know what it makes you and I look like when you assume.) and B) enacted the no personal attacks rule of their subreddit to a sub outside of their own, which, again, is meant as SATIRE. In other words, the made themselves look like asses by assuming, and then made further asses of themselves by TAKING SATIRE SERIOUSLY, and enacting their rules on someone else's subreddit despite that person having never posted in the defendants' sub. How would you like it if I enacted the rules of my sub, /r/AcademicPlaybook, on your subreddit?  Pretty bad? That's what I thought. If this case goes to the defendant, it sets a very dangerous precedent that could ruin the site, with no one being able to satirize other subreddits, thus allowing satire to become dead on Reddit, as this goes even further. The ""Our house, our rules"" doesn't apply to when what happened occured in SOMEONE ELSE'S HOUSE. Thank you."
KarmaCourt,2vfzl9,tent163phantoka,4,Tue Feb 10 23:40:25 2015 UTC,"Standing nervously, the defense takes a quick drink of water. He thought it was going to be a an easy case. He did not realize that he would be up against a Full Certified prosecutor. After an abnormally loud gulp, and a slight vurp the defense begins.  Your honor, the moderators of /r/dccomics are simply passionate.   Did one of my clients potentially overreact? Possibly. However, as the Plaintiff has stated, they unbanned him.    But I ask, who is not passionate about a subreddit they mod? Would you not react in the same way towards a poor attempt at satire or as the Plaintiff put it, ""Satite."" The charge of not appreciating satire is overstated simply because the satire is almost undetectable.   The world of /r/dccomics is as much a minefield for vitriolic debates as any subreddit where the universe is as chaotic as the inside of Pandora's box was. The charge of over-modderation is overblown.  My clients were simply trying to ensure the community stayed positive. Were my clients a little over zealous in their efforts? Maybe. But not for the charge of over-moderation.   Finally, your honor, the cause for all this vitriol is from a simple bot. One that lets other knows of possible brigades. It is good bot, but sadly it cannot judge what will happen following its post. Mods have a right to block links from subreddits who have been known to  brigade. My clients were being proactive.  How could one ever see this as bad when the level of sarcasm was so low. My clients could have blocked all links to /r/DCcirclejerk but they did not. They simply gave a warning.  Could my clients have worded their statements correctly, absolutely. But, making my clients languish in this court is too much when there is obviously reasonable doubt this this is only a case of misunderstanding.jpg.gif.  The defense returns behind the defendants table, hoping no one saw the small wet spot on the front of his Men's Wearhouse clearance slacks.  EDIT: an obvious word error."
KarmaCourt,2vfzl9,moccasinroot,4,Wed Feb 11 00:49:33 2015 UTC,"While I quite agree with the Defense's description of the DCU,(at least I think that's what he was talking about), the defendants did indeed overreact. Their own attorney practically admitted it. Overreaction is the cause of this case. Also, if found guilty, might I suggest that the defendants be forced to post an apology in their sub, /r/DCcirclejerk, and /r/KarmaCourt?"
KarmaCourt,2vfzl9,tent163phantoka,4,Wed Feb 11 01:52:05 2015 UTC,"After dabbing his mildly soaked pants with a pocket hanky, the defense notices he's forehead is perspiring. He does not have another pocket hanky. He uses the only thing he has, the pee pee scented hanky.  Thankfully, the ladies love a man who scents himself with his own musk. He rises with a confident air, knowing he smells like a man ought to.   Your honor, my clients has not been charged with overreacting. Even if they were, they were trying to protect the community of /r/dccomics from what they perceived as vitriolic speech, which is against their rules.  My clients were trying to keep their subreddit from possibly being targeted by a potentially hostile circlejerk subreddit. Again, the plaintiff's ban was lifted and /r/dccirclejerk has not had its links banned from /r/dccomics. If the defendants truly over-reacted we would have seen much worse, like not lifting the plaintiff's ban and blocking and links to the plaintiff's subreddit.   Finally your honor, my clients have been charged with many things, all of which have not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. If the prosecution wishes to charge my clients with overreaction, I suggest they drop their current charges and re-submit for a new trial.  However, if the prosecution does not drop the initial charges, your honor, I request you acquit my clients of these charges that are the very definition of overreacting.   The defense quickly grabs shades out of his jacket pocket and puts them on. He stands hoping the court room gasper, /u/Thimotron, would gasp at his last sentence. He begins to feel awkward that he has stood in the same akimbo position for 5 minutes waiting for /u/Thimotron. The defense shuffles back behind the desk, wishing he had chosen a different career path.  EDIT: clarifying by reducing the impact pronoun game"

It is an inalienable right of all Redditors to post freely in satirical subreddits. That is why we are here. Because that right was violated."
KarmaCourt,2vfzl9,tent163phantoka,3,Wed Feb 11 12:07:50 2015 UTC,"Your honor, there is nothing in the moddiquette about not banning people for something said in another subreddit. In fact, the plaintiff has been unbanned after it was found to be the work of a simple minded bot.  I implore you, your honor, do not make a hard and fast ruling on whether it is appropriate for banning someone for something they said on another subreddit. To do so would be ludicrous.  It would be as if telling a person they must allow someone into their home after that person was vilifying the homeowner in another residence.    Again, my clients are not being charged with banning someone for saying something on another subreddit. My clients have been charged with the above crimes.  Your honor, the prosecution is going in circles trying to pin something on my clients. If your honor feels that a lesser crime has been committed, I suggest the plaintiff and their attorney refile and this case be dismissed. But, on the charges that my client stands accused of, there is reasonable doubt that this is nothing more than a misunderstanding.jpg.gif.   Your honor, my clients are innocent of the crimes they are charged with. They are victims of an over reaching prosecutor that has bit off more than their handsome and zit free face can chew. I ask for you to find my clients not guilty.  The defense looks uneasy.  He has to get to his other job. He is seen behind the desk quickly changing out of his terrible suit and into a grease stained McDonald's uniform.  EDIT: than = that  UPDATE: The defense rests your honor."
KarmaCourt,2vfzl9,moccasinroot,4,Wed Feb 11 18:22:01 2015 UTC,"One last statement: the reason the modiquette has no rule against banning for something said on another subreddit is because there shouldn't have to be.

As it is now, I've stickied a message in the subreddit notifying users that posting in the sub could result in a ban without warning if the moderators are so concerned with what others might say about their ""community"" outside their walls.  Having this threat lingering over our heads I fear will effectively stifle any and all growth that /r/dccirclejerk could experience.

CHARGE 3: Imposing the rules of their subreddit unto others - GUILTY     Résumé & Sentence  Since the plaintiff was unbanned it appears that the case is more about a misunderstanding than a real crime. The mods where a little too banhammer itchy, and showed remorse by unbanning the plaintiff.   It is advised that the mods of /r/DCcomics be a little more parsimonious when considering banning people for actions out of their own sub.  Let the satire live, je suis DC Comics. /u/Takashi_Kovacs89 will delete all existing threads in /r/dccirclejerk and start the sub anew, doing as he pleases given that it's funny, light hearted and satirical. That, being fully consented and approved by the mods of /r/DCcomics  This acting as an apology and a new start, making void and invalid all previous problems emanating from the sub and the plaintiff. /u/moccasinroot gets to choose a flair for /u/tent163phantoka in sign of good arguing and peace.

Here we are ready to prosecute the fuck out of Mr. /u/LiarAmongAll[1]  ... HEY!!! That's me! Why am I fucking myself over??? Oh yeah. Probably because I am a complete asshole.  I started a wonderful chain of stories called The Karma Break, it was supposed to go off without hitch, everyone was gonna love the ending... But then my trolling ways got the best of me. I was reminded of a /r/shittynosleep[2] story, one that ended in blood. I'm not trying to defend my actions, I am here to attack myself, see myself behind bars. I trolled the fuck out of you guys. Thus, I request the first charge be changed to First Degree Trolling (MasterCraftTroll.exe). You see, I went above and beyond for this one. No one was harmed by it, but you were all extraordinarily pissed about it. Understandably too, that troll was a douche move.  This move, I stated to have done so after trying several different endings. I personally know that to be a lie. I got writers block to the max (I have like 6 different stories that I can't finish right now because of this), and my trolling ways got the best of me. So I did what I do best. I did it for my lulz. I destroyed a rather well crafted story by ending it the way I did. And when everyone got mad, I lul'd, boy did I. You can even ask my wife! I laughed and laughed my evil laugh. It was hilarious knowing everyone was pissed, wolfy was the first to show it, which made it even more funny! I couldn't stop myself.  Now here I stand, ready to see me behind bars. This is still for the lulz, btw. Cause either way, I win :D you find me guilty? I won the case. You find me not guilty? I get off, set to troll again, you piss you all off however I can.

That's what it is, a forced confession. My client is innocent! Sure the ending of the Karma Break wasn't what anyone expected, we even have someone commenting on that very fact. Still a ending was delivered.   Second Degree Trolling? What is this supposed to mean? I do not believe my client intended to piss people off. Well maybe he did, but it's not his fault if he's insane. You see my client confessed to me that he is purposely volunteering himself to be shot at. Does that not sound insane to you? I think it does.   As to the final charge. Is someone a douche for providing entertainment to thousands of people who read /r/KarmaCourtBlog? If that is the case then we should all be charged as such.  The Defense Rest, but let me remind you of this.... here is a picture of Jerry Sandusky trolling the court as he left his trial.

I think we need proof of you claim that the defendant (myself) confessed to purposefully being shot at, no? If you are going to make claims about things I've said, you better have proof.

As it stands there's nothing keeping defendants from being convicted for the same thing over and over again. Add somewhere that a prosecuting attorney is required for cases to proceed  (this isn's stipulated anywhere currently) Add somewhere that the burden of proof rests on the prosecution to show the defendant is guilty (this is equivalent to assuming innocence until proven otherwise, which I think is a cornerstone of modern justice systems [also it will make prosecuting harder and defending easier, which if you go by the stats here, is a good thing]) everything HHG said, below     Requested by HHG, God rest her reddit soul:   create an addendum reference document to address the definitions of common charges Plaintiff(s) typically bring against Defendants (much like the ones in the old Constitution.) further provide clarification on the who and when to use a user over ""The People Reddit"" or ""The People of [sub]"" when bringing charges. require a Bailiff for each case, just like we require a Prosecutor, Defense attorney and Judge. Bailiff would be responsible for summons (as they are now), and would be responsible for poking attorneys at the 24 hour time frame for response (to keep the case from going stale), and jurors when it's time to go to verdict.  make it absolutely clear to all attorneys now (some have come back recently that no use of the old constitution is to be used. I would further make it clear that case precedent that relies specifically on the old constitution for verdict is not permissible as supporting evidence, in so far using it as a foundation for the charges by Prosecution or to defend against prosecution by Defense attorney. If Case precedent is used as a foundation for argument, it must be from the new constitution.

KarmaCourt,2uqn2z,HHGofAntioch,3,Tue Feb 10 09:50:52 2015 UTC,So does this mean that we use the definitions from the old constitution? Just wanted to get some clarification on that. Or do you have it tabled for later?

Yes, it's not actually a rap album, it's a ... well ... reasonable doubt. get's poked in the back by the person Ouch!  Well, let's begin, it's a dramatic call and response act this person brings, listen:   What does the photo show? A driveway where to paramedics shovel snow! What did the defendant call his postey thing? Ghost, punch Ouuuu! That is too big for a rhyme response: 'An elderly man in my neighborhood had a heart attack while shoveling his driveway. Paramedics took him to the hospital, then returned to finish shoveling his driveway for him'. Still rhymes, Doubt. Still rhymes. smack What is the comment in Exhibit C? Ghost, are you kidding me? That's even longer! thud Eyh, I know you get that going! 'I knew this might be mentioned, I do indeed feel very bad. I didn't even know who lived there let alone someone who needed help. This is actually a few houses down; someone from the neighborhood with a snowblower will help them out from now on when it snows.'   See? Nice job, Doubt. holds up right hand, promptly regrets as his arm bends back roughly from the high five Now what are you trying to tell us?  Don't you see it? Feel it! SLAP Ouwww, man, I know! Damnit. turns to the prosecution   The good OP-opti-OPimo-/u/optimoprimo wrote what the picture showed. Look at Exhibit C, check back with the tied el-ee-tee to the tee-ee-arr-ass written to describe the mess in the post, look real close. That's just the same description OP chose to give when posting this to reddit at submission. That's for you, claiming, that OP may have been aiming at making that pic seem like his own, how could we have it known? Huh? We can't since he doesn't say it. You, I tell you what you do, interpret that into a pic, a title and the scene you chose to see as what you like it to. Represent, it does, just what the title claims, two paramedics, a drive, snow and they shovel up. Yup. Can it be, that OP may indeed live right in that street? Oh, how we know, no we don't, but he could since he would, say that it's just a few houses down. Context, I use to say, is a bitch, but hey let me say as a man, he is not, he's a dick. Plays a trick or two on me and you. You and me, tee-hee-hee. See there, it may be there that OP did see this pic on his FB newsfeed because he's friends with the Fire De-Part-Ment from around his block, what a shock. Sees it, knows the story, posts the story to reddit and there goes the story and you added that he might be claiming it's his pic, while context is a dick. There's no more. Just reasonable doubt that OP may indeed be who he wrote, where he said, what he saw and all is true. Bummer.

Okay, your honour, /u/Professor_Doodles! We all gestures around through the room came here for a good clean fight. But my colleague here points at the baffled prosecutor was overwhelmed by the defence's tactical statement. I can understand that, prosecuting is not a light task. Especially against this defence counsel right here. gestures to defence table  But the show must go on! The defendant /u/optimoprimo here wants to make us believe he never claimed anything here. But what did really happen? He submitted a photo of a driveway and to snow shovellers, yes. But the title made it seem, for any reasonable, objective viewer, that he had made this photo! He gave a back story, wherever he took it, that made it seem like he had been on scene.  And when confronted with it? He told those who he tricked into believing it was his photo, that he was sorry. May have been about something else from his point but we have to judge by what the public could perceive! So he perpetuated the situation by claiming he was sorry for something. And to the reasonable, objective observer that could only have been for making it seem like it was his picture. The defence counsel tells a great story. But the charges stand! Thank you.  drops mic, walks back over and stares at the prosecution table  OBJECTION!!! Your honour, the prosecution had claimed the case closed. We motion to strike this statement from the record!  wrinkles forehead  And by any means, these are all assumptions! The defendant would have to intend such interpretation of his title and comment where he does clearly not! How does the prosecution gestures at the prosecutor who has reclaimed his seat and looks over confusedly intend to prove this? Nothing in the title or the comment or elsewhere stated by the defendant points out any such intention. Finding the defendant guilty on such ground would mean that claiming a certain mindset does not require any proof of it. The defendant is still not guilty!  sits back and awaits the judge's ruling"

There are few things worse than lying on the internet, but nothing is worse than making up some slutty milf and posting it on /r/AdviceAnimals.      If the quality and creativity of his story aren't enough, it is obvious from the Defendant's post history that this is a lie. If he was truly capable of wooing mothers in such a way, would he need to be over at gonewild? (that's a nsfw link to a comment he made on a gonewild post, btw) The answer is no. If he were truly so skilled at wooing women as his meme implies, he would be ""drowning in pussy,"" as the kids say.   The next obvious bullshit indicator is the mother kissing the child. No matter how slutty or incesty she was, no real mother would kiss her prepubescent child in a public place in full view of a creeper like the Defendant.   Lastly, I submit for consideration the lack of contact information. Did this slutty milf give the Defendant any contact information? Well, there sure as hell was no mention of it. There was some winking, but no phone number, no email, no address, nothing that could help the Defendant find out what dirty little things that wink meant. Is this last detail a surefire sign of bullshit? Perhaps not, but it does call into question the validity of his story."

No, i don't believe you do. so calling him a creeper is just a low blow, nothing to do with the actual case at hand.  finally, we can all sit here and doubt the story, whatever. but maybe, just maybe, OP was charismatic enough to have this happen. look through his post history, look how he talks, the way he carries himself on reddit. is it that hard to believe that someone acts on reddit the same way they do irl? not everyone needs some magical character to hide behind, some of us are confident enough to just be ourselves. believe it or not, charisma will get you far in life, my bro in law can get any girl he wants pretty much at any time because of his charisma. he also makes 2300+ a month as a waiter in [somewhere]. and that's at a shitty chain restaurant. your honor, this case made out of simple jealousy. i see nothing wrong with what the /u/Aerolas posted. unless you can prove, without a doubt, that this didn't happen, i see no validity to the case...  one more thing, reading through some old cases I believe posting his history is a bad idea. your gonna get him downvoted, i think exhibit c needs to be removed... motion to remove exhibit c as it encourages downvoting"

I don't claim that he is a loner, only that the Defendant, if he is as charismatic as he would have us believe, would likely enjoy getting it on with a real woman more than his hand, a bottle of lotion, and a couple of photos. Creeper was less of a commentary on his physical appearance than one about the way he supposedly carefully observed the interaction between a mother and her child in a public location.

If you have a problem with that, then you can be the one to sue all the other bullshitters. That, however, is beside the case. Stop changing the subject away from the Defendant and his guilt."

Karma is the ultimate sign of what reddit thinks, yes?  if he doesn't care about the karma, then what possible motivation can you provide for him to lie? and, mind you, you also need evidence of this reason to lie.   the defense rests, ive got nothing else to say unless some real evidence of a crime is presented.

It doesn't mean it has a PURPOSE here (see above, literally first sentence as well). I see that it archives in the event of hosting failure, but WHY? We don't need that. To be more point blank:  My point is Few-fold.  1) We don't have the problem this bot is supposed to fix. Thus its PURPOSE and not its FUNCTION is being questioned. I am asking Why does the bull have a tit. And you are telling me because it has a fleshy patch of skin that pokes out in a nipple shape. I am asking WHY, you are telling me WHAT.  2) One thing we have made clear is when a user feels things have gone ""too far,"" we will remove the case and close her down. If someone genuinely feels threatened or harassed, this is no longer satire. This function actively prevents that.  3) As we are satire, when evidence is removed, goes missing, gets edited, get added, that is part of the case. It is not some impending wall we have not been able to climb before. It is intrigue. Mystery. A fold in the page.  Aditionally, I read well past the 1st sentence, and it seems even this thread you have posted has users asking ""Why?!"" as to this bot anyways. I am far from near sighted for asking the question, since the entire comment section seems dedicated to asking similar, or so it seems..."
KarmaCourt,2u7n94,dellmill,3,Fri Jan 30 18:40:03 2015 UTC,"Esteemed sort of colleague, I see your point. The point of this bot is to file a snapshot of the evidence in case the evidence gets nuked, which can happen. Your initial reserve is that when we make a bot do something we are stopping a user from doing the same thing, and naturally we don't want to take things to do away from us users because that makes the place less fun. However, no user has ever come forward to post a snapshot of evidence on  regular basis, and it has only rarely been done. So the bot has not replaced anybody, in that sense. Since we're all entitled to an opinion, here's mine. I am neither for nor against this bot, but in my mind it adds a post, and preserves evidence from being deleted. Also, there was a spate of people only using screencaps of the evidence for evidence, which could indeed harm the judicial process, so I guess this bot helped avoid that one."

KarmaCourt,2u7n94,dellmill,2,Fri Jan 30 19:08:17 2015 UTC,"While I partially agree with most of what you've said, having a case go under because evidence goes missing is rather bothersome and ruins the fun and satire of the case. No one will have fun arguing a moot point, correct?  But, there's no need for it to be announced every single time it archives something, especially when most cases don't have the issue of deleted evidence. But, as a non-participant, this is merely my 2 cents, and can be taken with a grain of salt... Or cheese... I'm hungry"

I debuted it a day before preserverbot, and to a good reception I might add. Preserverbot is meant to archive linkposts in arbitrary subreddits. KarmaCourt has linkposts disabled. As I outlined in the KCB post, the point of my bot is to keep evidence available. More than once, I've been a part of a case that got thrown out or died because at some point during the trial the evidence wasn't there. OK, that's fine, we got around that by taking screenshots and posting those (iolp does this all the time) as evidence. Except wait, now screenshots aren't admissible because they could've been ""tampered with."" Yes, this happened in a case I was part of.  Truth be told, archiving evidence manually so you can participate in cases is not one of the fun parts of KC. And as YDD pointed out, there's never been any human who did that. We have Elvis impersonators, Groots, taco vendors, etc. etc., but no archivists. Archiving is a simple, repetitive task --- perfect for a bot."

KarmaCourt,2tt2fr,The_Ghast_Hunter,2,Tue Jan 27 18:40:24 2015 UTC,"VERDICT  Both Prosecution and Defence Rest, and both have provided compelling arguments.   The argument that OP may be a lover of both men men and women is a valid defence. While OP may not have stated outright a bycurious nature, it would certainly explain the posts, and no evidence (real or otherwise) has been produced to counter this defence.  What DIDN'T factor into my ruling:   But the legal doctrine is innocent until proven guilty. Without proof that my client is not a homosexual, there is no case.    We here at KC don't assume anything. We allow the evidence to speak for itself, unless the prosecutor or defence want to speak to it (as they should, and as they did).    would like to add that this case has clearly targeted my client because of their sexuality    The Prosecution didn't attack sexuality, merely alluded to the possibility OP Was a Big. Stinky. Liar. So, with those 2 facts ignored and the rest of the evidence and arguments accounted for  I MUST FIND OP NOT GUILTY! On All (One) Counts. OP is however, to be forever known as a lover of both geneders. Be that as it may or may not. Perhaps. Somedays. Wednesdays mostly.  I would like to thank both attorneys for their great work, Justice has been served and I would be honoured to judge the shit out of both of you again.  Barring Anything else...

KarmaCourt,2to9d2,sasha_fedchenkov,5,Tue Jan 27 05:06:17 2015 UTC,Exhibit C makes it clear that /u/MrKuzco is the owner of the picture. The submission of the defendant /u/ThatGamerCreep contains a claim to ownership in the title. This makes him guilty of the crimes he is being tried for.  The prosecution will not be negotiating a deal at this time. The prosecution is confident that the defendant will be found guilty without having to compromise.

KarmaCourt,2tcwxl,acwarren492,2,Sat Jan 24 08:20:20 2015 UTC,"Ladies and Gentleman of the Court Room. Let me tell you a tail. A tail of a mod gone out of control for Karma. Yes, who doesn't love that sweet sweet karma? I know I do. Wha....what was I saying? Oh yeah, as you can see from the Evidence the defendant was  clearly on a karma rampage. This was not a simple crosspost, if that was the case we might be able to understand.   Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence, you know all the facts.We have the accused at the scene of the crime. We have a beautiful young woman and her lover(s) lying in each other's arms. They had sinned. But was their crime so great as to merit a repost? I suspect Mr. /r/Luvjuice's answer to that would be yes. We have all crossposted a link to one sub or another, but this is ridiculous. This is a clear violation of Karma Whoring most extreme."
KarmaCourt,2tcwxl,acwarren492,2,Sat Jan 24 20:50:19 2015 UTC,"Mr. /u/dellmill can couch his argument in whatsoever ornate rhetoric he wants, but Reddiquette is quite clear on the matter:   [Please do] [p]ost to the most appropriate community possible. Also, consider cross posting if the contents fits more communities.   And:   [Please don't] [c]omplain about cross posts. Just because you saw it in one place, doesn't mean everyone has seen it. Just vote and move on.   Crossposting is an integral part of Reddit, and complaining about it accomplishes nothing."
KarmaCourt,2tcwxl,dellmill,2,Sat Jan 24 21:52:20 2015 UTC,"The defendant is on trial here today for karmawhoring not crossposting. When you crosspost how do you title it? Do you not use the tag [x-post]? I see none of that in your clients history. I submit to the court that the defendant used these post to gain karma, and in this way also harmed other redditors by not allowing them the opportunity to crosspost said post.  The Prosecution has no further arguments at this time."
KarmaCourt,2tcwxl,acwarren492,2,Sun Jan 25 00:05:19 2015 UTC,Where in Reddiquette does it state one must use the [x-post] tag? On what basis do you declare this necessity?  Documentation lacks; so too must a conviction.

Karma Whoring and using an inappropriate title, also known as ""clickbaiting"". Let us first discuss the title: the defendant entitled his submission ""The new Canadian passport under black light will blow your mind.""  Let us refer to a few sections of Reddiquette which deal with submission titles:   Keep your submission titles factual and opinion free. If it is an outrageous topic, share your crazy outrage in the comment section.   and   [Please don't] [e]ditorialize or sensationalize your submission title.   The submission is in obvious violation of both of these guidelines. The statement ""will blow your mind"" is a clear statement of an opinion -- hardly a factual title. Not to mention, it is in an obvious sensationalization. Is the passport cool? Maybe. But ""mind-blowing""? Preposterous.  Moving on to the second charge: karma whoring. The use of violation of Reddiquette in order to gain karma is apparent. The defendant abused the trust of the users of /r/pics by making outlandish claims that were not just inappropriate but also deceptive.   I ask you, O good jurors, let Justice be served.   EDIT: Narrated!"
KarmaCourt,2stoa1,dellmill,2,Mon Jan 19 02:29:08 2015 UTC,"Honorable members of the jury, I ask you: what exactly does it mean to have your mind blown?  Anyone?  The term ""mind-blowing"" is almost entirely subjective.  What one may find mind-blowing, another may find mildly interesting, and vice versa.  Which begs the question: how could one determine the validity of a picture's mind-blowingness?  I assert that if CHACHICHACHICHICKEN finds that the subject blows his mind, then he is within his right to say as much in his own post.  I submit to the court, this comment claiming that the blacklit passport.   My apologies for the bad title. It was late and my own mind was blown. I should not have projected the same experience onto the interweb. I'm Canadian, and I'm sorry - what else is new. To appease the masses I present to you… more pages: http://imgur.com/a/3u8xP   /u/Chachichachichicken    This comment proves that CHACHICHACHICHICKEN did have his mind blown.  My client pleads innocent to this charge.  As to the second charge, I believe that my client is innocent.  He did not force any of those thousands of redditors to upvote his post.  Any one of them could have gone back and downvoted my client.  In a world that is saturated with hyperbolic clickbait, I wouldn't think any less or more of his post than if he called it ""just pretty neat"".  The defense rests, your honor.  Edited for formatting."
KarmaCourt,2stoa1,ItsAMeMitchell,2,Mon Jan 19 04:15:40 2015 UTC,"While the defense has handily proven that /u/chachichachichicken had his mind blown, whether his mind was blown is wholly immaterial. The post claimed it would ""blow your mind"", not that his own mind was blown. Therefore, his entire argument has nothing to do with the case.   Furthermore, the defense has failed to address any points made with concern to Reddiquette ... perhaps because he has no arguments relating to the case whatsoever?  Finally, the defense claims ""Which begs the question: how could one determine the validity of a picture's mind-blowingness?"" Well, the Oxford English Dictionary says:   blow someone's mind: informal Affect someone very strongly.   Here is your objective standard! Would a reasonable person be ""affected very strongly"" by the submission? I think not. The passport is pretty and kind of neat, but hardly strongly affecting, and certainly not very strongly affecting.  The prosecution rests, Your Honor."
KarmaCourt,2stoa1,dellmill,1 point,Mon Jan 19 05:12:03 2015 UTC,"Your honor, the prosecution claims that ""a reasonable person [would not] be 'affected very strongly' by the submission"".  I beg to differ.  I believe that this passport, a valuable form of legal identification, would strongly affect a person...if they were Canadian.  Please, imagine this: you are a Canadian buisness man/woman.  Once or twice a month, you must leave the country to meet with international clients.  Before your flight takes off, however, your co-worker casually mentions that your passports behave differently when shone with a black light.  You investigate for yourself.  Sure enough, your passport now has page after page after page of beautiful artwork.  This measly book of paper, that you have had for years, is secretly a work of art.  I believe that this is grounds for blown minds.  The defense rests."

While I did not intend to create a 'click bait' title and have no interest in 'karma', my actions seem to have broken rules I didn't know existed and I have offended thousands of Redditors and countless others around the globe. My ignorance of the rules and cultural sensitivities of Redditors, while it may explain my actions, does not undue the offenses I have caused. If it pleases the court and if it will ease the pain of those I've offended, I would voluntarily surrender or donate to a charity any karma I received from my post along with any other restitutions The Court deems suitable. If, however, this court exists so that those who like to argue have something to argue about, then I am glad to have provided such a thing. I await your decision and directions.

By this trial we hope that the rest of humanity, easily within reach of the Kourts of karma, shall realize that we are able to commit an error from time to time, but that such an error can induce us all to the depths of hell and beyond by being not any more above the law than any other mortal.   The victim whose name is too much to copy paste is entitled to compensation, and in no small order. We want cash. we want all the cash, and then some , because we believe that the role of victim is cash orientated, beyond any other measure of orientation, and we think, fuck it, yeah, give us some cash.

Oh prosecution, how the tables have turned. You were once my mentor, my rock, my reason to move forward. Now, I see you with open eyes. You are a new shade of death, a truer shade of red could not even be found in the blood that pumps through all our veins. No fiend has ever worn a mask so ominous, so vacant of life. I no longer know you... I don't think I ever did...  Here I stand, ready. I've come so far here in KC, but we all know I've seen my share of trouble. You see, this is far from my first time being sued. I've lost count of all the cases filed against me. But by  stroke of shear luck, and by the grace of Justice, case after case has been dismissed.  Today, as you can see, I would not accept that! I argued that it was time for a case against me to go to trial. And with good cause!  You all know me, at least through my words, so doing this... It truly saddens me, down to my very core.  My career has revolved around bringing down those who wrong others, when all along the defendant should have been me.  I, /u/iolpiolp8, am guilty. I have committed many a crime. I have wronged so many in KC, it's difficult to keep up. All these cases that have been thrown out... All of them true. And now this case, these charges? Also true.  I am guilty of each and every crime I have been accused of here in KC. Which is why this shall be my final case. Oh, don't think I'm leaving (I am in a month). I will still be here, still talking with you all, bitching about the good ol days, reminiscing with /u/Wolfdragoon97 about Tank 1, plotting to kill /u/Kell08, and guiding my minions (fuck no, BiasedLaw aint closing!).  But today shall mark my final day as prosecutor, defense or judge. As guilty as I am, I cannot continue this charade, this façade, I cannot lead cases forward knowing that I, /u/iolpiolp8, am the biggest criminal in all of KC.  Your Honor, I plead guilty on all charges, and stand before you, here and now, to face the consequences of my actions. The defense rests."
