FutureWhatIf,3e56td,selfhatingyank,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:18:57 2015 UTC,"In an attempt to further Iran's socialization into the international community that began with the nuclear deal, Ayatollah Khamenei releases Mir-Hossein Mousavi from the house arrest he's faced since 2011.  Mousavi, as expected, stands for the 2017 Presidential elections against the current President Hassan Rouhani.  Rouhani, himself a reformist candidate compared to previous Presidents, runs for re-election as the Supreme Leader's favored candidate.  2017 proves to be a momentous year, however.  In previous years, candidates are strictly vetted and approved, and voting irregularities guaranteed the favored candidate's victory when normal politicking could not.  But the new election was much more open.  Khamenei had (often tepidly) set his country on a more liberal path of engagement with the world, and wished to see his legacy as one of liberal reforms in Iran's relationship with the world and with its people.  While all the structures of the Islamic Republic's controlled democracy were still maintained, Mousavi was still cleared to run, and wins with a relatively small majority of 54%.  His victory is confirmed by the government, and he is inaugurated as Iran's seventh President.  Tensions begin immediately between the liberal reforms pushed by Mousavi and conservative figures in the Guardian Council, IRGC, religious institutions and political notables from more conservative rural areas.  The IRGC is especially threatened by Mousavi's attempts to push anti-corruption legislation through Parliament, as some of the measures include restrictions on state bodies begin able to own businesses.  The moves are ostensibly aimed at divorcing government institutions from economic matters, in order to increase efficiency, competitiveness and economic integration with the world, but they directly threaten the IRGC's substantial business interests, arousing much opposition to the new President.  in 2019, Khamenei's health seriously deteriorates.  He had allegedly suffered from prostate cancer, but the government is not forthcoming on details about his health.  Nonetheless, Khamenei remains out of public view for several months, and increasingly disengaged from the political process.  Conservative voices in Iran get louder, as Khamenei's moderating voice - which has been firm in maintaining liberal reforms as his legacy - grew quieter.  Part of the reforms instituted in the wake of the nuclear deal included the opening of Iran's oil sector to foreign investment.  Investments were initially highly controlled, but as further reforms - especially after Mousavi's election - came to fruition, investments became highly competitive.  Still, a major requirement for petrochemical projects is Iranian ownership, even if foreign companies can own up to 49% of any given project.  One of the first and largest companies to operate within these terms, PetroPersia, was 47% owned by foreign companies, but allocated 25% of its shares to employees and individual Iranians, rather than Iranian companies.  Approximately 45k Iranians purchased shares, though most shareholders held less than $500 worth.  In late 2019, PetroPersia beat out the IRGC-owned Oriental Oil Kish for a contract on phases 27 and 28 on the South Pars natural gas field.  Facing poor performance in its other economic ventures, the IRGC appealed the decision to a friendly court, and won the phases from PetroPersia.  However, phases 27 and 28 were to be PetroPersia's largest single investment, and news of the sudden switch sent share prices plummeting by half, with skittish investors having fears of favoritism being proven right.  Within several days, hundreds of Iranian share-owners are protesting outside the court, having seen their investments - which had been encouraged by the government - fall by half due to the IRGC's somewhat dubious process.  Protests grow as the IRGC and the courts remain defiant.  Mousavi, nervous about his position, attempts to defuse the situation, but the IRGC refuses to hand back the project.  Khamenei, still unwell, remains largely silent, only deepening fears.  Student protestors join the initial shareholder gatherings, demonstrating against corruption, the IRGC's influence over government and the continued repression of liberal and secular civil society groups.  While Iran's economy grows, the nuclear deal did not bring the large growth rates that some expected, and jobless youth, especially college graduates in their twenties, join the protests, which quickly swell to a size comparable to the Green Revolution of 2009, which demonstrated against the dubious defeat of Mousavi's first bid for the Presidency.  With Khamenei largely silent, protests rapidly expanding and the economy faltering due to instability, the IRGC sends Basij paramilitaries into crowd control roles in certain parts of Tehran.  While not a large crackdown, instead being very targeted and avoiding the use of anything beyond tear gas and water cannons, the Basij incense the protests and bring wide condemnation from the international community.  As the situation escalates, hardline generals within the IRGC gain prominence, taking control for fear that Khamenei's ill health leaves Mousavi capable of implementing even more drastic reforms.  The crackdown intensifies, and regular IRGC personnel are put on alert.    As thousands more Basij are sent into the cities to disperse protestors, violently if necessary, Mousavi receives indications that the IRGC will arrest him.  He does not attempt to flee, and orders guards around the Presidential Palace to stand down if the IRGC attempts to arrest him.  When he receives reports that the arrest will be imminent, however, Mousavi declares a state of emergency and declares a qualified martial law.  The regular army is to set up checkpoints throughout major cities and around previously-delineated protest ""zones"", which are large and roughly correspond to the areas where protests and protest camps had already been set up.  In practical terms, Mousavi orders the regular army to protect the protestors from the IRGC and Basij, setting the stage for a major confrontation between Iran's newly-empowerd liberal reformers and its conservative institutions.  Haven't written a long one like this before.  Good fun."

Several MPs, including the Prime Minister Mark Rutte, are also accused of not doing enough to stop these abuses, although they are not accused of doing anything illegal.  August 2: Many call for the PM, along with the incriminated MPs, to resign. However, the King calls for the dissolution of the entire Parliament. The PM and his government stays silent on the issue of resignation, though they do publicly condemn the child abuse.  August 3: The Parliament is dissolved. The PM is also hospitalized for unknown reasons and is unable to address the issue, although a Government spokesman reassures the Dutch that he is only going through an exceptionally severe case of ""gastrointestinal problems"".  August 6: The Prime Minister regains enough health to be aware of his surroundings. He publicly states that he did not authorize for the Parliament to be dissolved, and that he had been poisoned! Due to the Dutch system where technically only the King signs a royal decree to dissolve Parliament (although constitutional convention means that the PM makes the decision and the monarch follows the PM's decision by signing the decree), the King was able to impersonate the PM. It seems that the poison was also intended to kill, and the PM was lucky to be alive.   August 7: Massive demonstrations take place across the Netherlands, both protesting the child abuse scandal and the King's egregious violation of constitutional convention and democratic rule. The Army is called in to protect the King after several far-left anti-monarchists break into the palace. Meanwhile, no one is sure if the Parliament is dissolved, and the Prime Minister is nowhere to be seen.  August 9: President Obama states that the US is ""monitoring the Dutch situation"" and has sent the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (and the corresponding carrier group) to the North Sea for ""security purposes"". The EU, along with several prominent European leaders, states that ""we are on the side of democracy""   August 10: Anonymous high-level military officials state that they support the King's decision to dissolve the Parliament.  August 12: Some of the incriminated MPs resign, though others choose not to if only to protest the King.  August 14: The King submits a second royal decree ordering Parliament to be dissolved, adding that military force will be used if the Parliament is not dissolved by the 21st. The Prime Minister is seen for the first time since the 6th, though no one is able to talk to him.    August 20: In the dead of night, Dutch special forces storm the Prime Minister's residence, but the PM was nowhere to be seen.   August 21: Europe wakes up to chaos. The members of Parliament has scattered; many have been detained by the Royal Netherlands Army, while some have fled to Brussels, the new seat of the Dutch government-in-exile, based out of the Dutch embassy in Belgium. Apparently, the PM had fled there on August 6, and the person seen in the hospital on the 14th was actually a body double.  The King addresses the Netherlands through commandeering major Dutch TV and radio stations. In the address, he proclaims that the entire Parliament is treasonous for not following royal decree, and imprisoned MPs will be summarily executed by firing squad. High-ranking military officials also support the King, although some units in border regions defect.   Some anti-monarch demonstrators turn violent. Most violent protesters are armed with little more than Molotov cocktails and plywood. Others, however, still hope to find a peaceful solution.  August 22: CNN films Royal Netherlands Army soldiers brutally massacring Amsterdam protesters. An image of a soldier stabbing a twenty-something woman holding a yellow tulip goes viral.   The King executes the several dozen arrested Dutch MPs on national television by firing squad.  After an emergency session in Brussels, the NATO countries unilaterally agree that the Dutch exile government is the true legitimate government. NATO also invokes Article 5. The Security Council, in an emergency session, also approves of military action in the Netherlands.  August 23: The 101st Airborne Division parachutes into Amsterdam. French forces roll in from the south, while German armored columns move in from the east with air support. Joint Anglo-American landings in North Holland and Friesland are supported by the Eisenhower carrier group. The Dutch opposition, save for fanatical units holding Amsterdam, is minimal. After all, why would the rank-and-file want to fight for an absolute monarchy?   August 24: French and American forces capture the Royal Palace and kill the King after a short shootout. The buildings hosting the Parliament are captured with minimal damage, and the hiding or exiled Dutch MPs begin to return. Another picture goes viral, this time of Mark Rutte hooked up to an IV and making a speech to the House of Representatives. He is holding a yellow tulip.    September 1: Queen Catharina-Amalia formally presides over the ceremony of the abolition of the Dutch monarchy.    TL;DR: NATO. Not even once."

With that said, what if the attack was so major that it could not be ignored?  There would be retaliation. It would be difficult to know if the Saudi government would take action themselves, since in this scenario we are to believe that it was carried out by a small group of Christian terrorists, I think there would be major pressure put on Western governments to find their origin and seek compensation. As for militant Islamist groups, I'd expect a rash of terrorist bombings at many Christian holy sites. Israel would go on lock down, as violence would likely erupt. I would guess that the US would have to choose between getting more involved in counter-terrorism missions underway in Iraq to squash the threat of ISIS attacks domestically, or would have to pull out because anti-Western fervor getting out of control.

I'm thinking that a moderate Republican wins it, choosing to de-emphasize his/her positions on social issues and trying to stop the perception of ""bigoted GOP"" from spreading.  Trump won't take the right-wing vote away because let's face it, he's not a serious candidate. Even if he is, he's still got to get past the obstacle of being Donald Trump. Sanders, on the other hand, will take a lot of votes from the young and restless left-wing Democratic away from Clinton. Bush wins the presidency, and everyone's pissed that the US doesn't at least have a two-round election system.  Alternatively, Trump and Sanders both get screwed over due to sore-loser laws, which prevents someone who loses in a primary to run in a state's general election. (List of states with sore-loser laws, p.1044) I think this is the more likely thing to happen. Sanders may turn over a state or two to the GOP due to vote-splitting, but Clinton wins the presidency anyway. It's not all bad for Sanders, though; Clinton is forced to start going more and more to the left in order to get votes away from Sanders, perhaps more left than she would like."

They'd both get a good slice, into the millions, and it'd be really fucking interesting to watch, but Trump would come out ahead of Sanders.  Now, that isn't to say he'd win the Presidency. He wouldn't. But he could well pull Ross Perot-levels of support -- in 1992, he carried 0 states, received 0 electoral college votes, but he came out of it with almost 20 MILLION votes (18%!). He stole the vast majority of those votes from likely Bush supporters, so that split the vote, and let Clinton win. If Trump were to run third party or independent, we could see the same thing happen again.   The Republicans will nominate a moderate like Jeb Bush, with someone only slightly more right-leaning as a running mate, a Scott Walker type maybe.   That leaves Trump wide open to scoop up some of the more conservative votes. He'll pick someone younger, but politically experienced, to run with. Someone Tea Party approved. Probably someone military, and probably someone non-white. Allen West? Tim Scott?   Will Trump win a lot of votes in this scenario? Yes. Millions. But he probably won't win any states. Where's his base? New York? New York is not going to vote for Donald Trump to be president.   So, Trump splitting the vote, equals easy win for the Democrats. But what if there's another vote-splitter - this time splitting votes on the other side?  Bernie Sanders. An independent Sanders campaign isn't going to be taking any votes away from the Republicans. It's not going to damage Trump, it's not going to damage whoever the GOP picks. It's going to hurt one person: Hillary Clinton. Clinton wins the nomination, obviously, and picks Julian Castro as her running mate. (Hey, that surname isn't as toxic as it used to be.)  Sanders runs independent. Fails to secure the funding and support necessary for such a quixotic endeavour, but he's got the internet on his side - so that carries him somewhat.   One of the most interesting questions: what of the debates? They can't possibly restrict it to the two main parties, not when there's another two pulling HUGE amounts of support. In this scenario, at least one four-way debate is inevitable. Clinton/Bush/Sanders/Trump. It's a debate for the ages, everyone talks about it, and the internet loves it.   In the end, Sanders pulls a respectable six-to-eight percent of the vote. Trump gets a few points more. The rest is split between Clinton and Bush, in Clinton's favour.  America celebrates its first female president. Bush goes back to Florida. Sanders retires with dignity. Trump gets his own reality tv show."

FutureWhatIf,3dpn82,MeowMixSong,6,Sat Jul 18 05:56:38 2015 UTC,"Context  Hillary Clinton trounces Sanders in the 2016 primary (sorry, reddit), but has a very difficult time against Jeb Bush. Concerns for national security increases with an ISIS that just won't disappear and a growing China, and Greece's default sends the world into a second Great Recession. Many fear that the next drop will be the worst.  A Second Manifest Destiny (SMD) movement starts from the Republican Party with the hopes of an America from Nunavut to Chiapas. Canada and Mexico, hurt by the recession much more than the US due to several factors, actually offer some tepid support towards an EU-style union.   In the final general election debate, Clinton shocks America and the world by saying that    What the US needs - what the world needs - is not division. We need unity. Not just within our nation, but throughout the continent and the world. Only in unity will we overcome the economic and security hardships that our world faces today. That is why, if I am elected, I will offer Canada and Mexico a seat at the table of our great nation as equals.   The SMD rejoices.  Clinton narrowly defeats Bush on the popular vote, although she did win over 300 electoral votes with the support of the SMD Movement. Her first action in office, supported by the overwhelmingly Democratic Congress, is to officially offer a union among the three nations of North America. Canada and Mexico accept negotiations in the hopes of gaining financial (and in Mexico's case, security) assistance. An expanded NAFTA, that's all.  No one expected Hillary to offer an actual merging of nations at the Tri-Nation Summit of 2017. The SMD Movement, energized by Hillary's election, starts gaining support among internationalist Democrats, and the new constitution is approved by Congress and ratified by the states in record time. (Honestly, that's a bit unrealistic, but I had to merge the nations by 2020) Canada accepts with few objections, but Mexico debates until 2019 and several amendments to the NAU constitution had to be made to accommodate Mexico.  Immediate Situation  Well, I'd guess a lot of people would be up in arms. Now, the NAU would have to take care of the violence in Mexico, which would take a lot of resources out of the US and Canada. (I'll still refer to the former nations by their names)  Many politicians from all three countries - even those who supported the NAU - begin to think that everyone had made a very grave mistake. A US-Canada union is radical enough but at least have a lot in common and are for the most part stable and developed, but Mexico and all its baggage along for the ride?  There would be a lot of animosity between the three former countries, with Americans and Canadians not wanting to subsidize Mexico and Mexico angry at the northerners not helping their fellow North Americans. Unless Mexico gets a ton of northern assistance, there would be a dislike of the northerners and an American-dominated NAU. (I think the American domination is an obvious conclusion)  Hypothetically...  Now here's where I really get into some unlikely stuff. Well, this is unlikely in the first place, but even more unlikely. I'm assuming the national governments won't immediately merge, although a NAU government would be actively forming.  Here's the good news. Canada, buoyed by US funding and a sense of English-speaking unity (for the most part, cough cough Quebec) starts polling the NAU favorably. For the most part, the Canadians think the NAU is a good idea. If only Mexico wasn't in it...   Now for the bad news. The unsuccessful efforts of the NAU in combating Mexican organized crime (perhaps they will be successful, but any success will not show up for quite some time) causes even more dislike of the NAU in Mexico.   Several far-left groups in Mexico begin to demonstrate against what they felt was Mexico being neglected in favor of big business. The NAU begins to crack down on both the far-left demonstrations and the gangs even more, and starts a controversial program of bombing potential organized crime hideouts, sometimes even in populated areas. In response, the far-left groups turn to guerilla warfare as well.  Now, with the impending dissolution of the national governments in January 2025, Clinton faces a difficult road to the North American Presidency. With almost unanimous opposition in Mexico, a divided base in the US and Canada, and a failed guerilla campaign in Mexico, DC is filled with calls of ""Mexico Out"". More worryingly for Clinton, it is also filled with calls of ""Clinton Out"". She's also getting old, and it's bad form to run for what is essentially a third term, even if it is technically legal...

It hasn't cost jobs, it's created them. The down side has been a lack of wage growth, but it's impossible to attribute that to NAFTA singularly, as opposed to the trend of globalization as a whole. In addition, NAFTA is a trade agreement between countries, which is wholly different from those countries unifying. It comes down to in groups and out groups. Those ignorant of economics and who are against NAFTA see it as beneficial to Mexicans and Canadians at the detriment of Americans. That's exclusionary thinking (that's also wrong) and just a shitty way to view the world. It also wholly doesn't apply if instead the countries were combining.

I don't see how this would lead to standards within those developing countries would be significantly lessened, well either that or people would by and large be willing to pay more for quality steel and other materials, which is already the case. Moreover Canada's population and associated weight is negligible and as it already makes up a portion of that market, probably won't change the rise or non rise of china in any qualitatively different way. Even if things did go as you planned, which i unfortunately see no reason to believe would be the case, it would only prolong the inevitable. On the other hand, Canada may very well simply diversify trade partners, which it is already well in the process of doing.   existing state of moderation/lack thereof of American politics by and large does not harm Canadians, again, on social issues Canada already has a very strong constitution and generally one of the smoothest running judicial systems in the world, on economic policies the US tends to take moderate steps at the federal level and has a plethora of checks and balances that ensure a fairly tepid bill will pass the house, whenever it does. We have a drastically reduced need or desire for the same level of checks and balances as the american system, allowing us to pass bills considerably quicker and in line with canadian voters. An american checks system keeps most of the dangers of non moderate american politics away from us. Those on the left of Canada would certainly not consider the situation to benefit them. America's right is considerably further on a variety of social issues that Canada by and large considers closed issues now, such as abortion (made so by Harper himself). This would also vastly and disproportionately dilute Canadian ability to dictate their own laws domestically. As long as we're on that page, Canadians by and large don't want this, as to be not american is a key part of the national identity.  On the whole, i agree that internationalism reduces in inefficiencies, speaking from the perspective of those that benefit from such inefficiencies however, we see no reason to start now."

Nevertheless they still score points with their own base with actions that continue to alienate Scottish voters.

Losing Scotland from the Union would also upset the English electorate, although ironically their pro Union stance alienated a lot of Labours old Scottish support (seen as being Labour siding with the Conservatives against Scotland)  - they are pretty much screwed either way.  The above illustrates why the SNP won 56 out of 59 Scottish seats in the last General Election. This coupled with demographics  - the young in Scotland generally voted for independence while over 60's disproportionately voted against - implies that unless the SNP totally screw the pooch somehow they just need to hold on and look halfway competent until the next opportunity occurs for an independence referendum in the next few years.

Catching everyone off guard, Hillary announces that she'll allow any state to hold a secession referendum, resulting in her winning a surprisingly easy victory.  2023: Roughly half of states hold secession votes. Although many fail, a belt of deep red states from Alabama to Idaho secedes, splitting the USA into three pieces:  -the East and Midwest, stretching from North Dakota to Florida     -the Pacific states.       -the Red Crescent.  The two blue states remain under one government, but the thin strip of seceded Idaho and Montana separates them.  2024: In a darkly hilarious moment, the Red Crescent's bid for UN membership is held up over ""human rights concerns"" such as guns and incarceration rate. Although the US tries to help the RC obtain international recognition, many other countries object, including Uganda (blaming the Reds for homophobic laws) and South Africa (saying that the Reds are an apartheid regime).  2024: The remaining US elects a very left-wing president who is tired of ""subsidizing an outlaw nation."" The new American president offers Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana billions in subsidies to reunite the two halves of the union; shipping across Canada is getting annoying and the Red Crescent is in a crippling recession thanks to lost federal assistance. Both the Reds and the Blues are divided, with the Reds in particular claiming ""bribery and sabotage"" against the Rocky Mountain Three. Texas launches a military expedition to rid the Red Crescent of ""swine"". The West Coast threatens to join Canada if over-land shipping is disrupted.  2025: Idaho and Montana are scheduled to hold a referendum on which America to join, but armed elements from both sides attempt to disrupt it.

Their grand strategy for a war against the US involves bogging them down in the Pacific by any means necessary and preventing them from establishing a beachhead. If Korea united (or if China took over Korea) then the US would already have a beachhead.  What I see happening is a) China releases North Korea shortly after occupation as a quasi-independent state WITHOUT an alliance with China. A neutral puppet, if you will.  Or, b) China hands it back to South Korea with the caveat that they have to kick the US Army out of Korea.

I imagine the biggest issues, to arise from this would be the threat from North Korean nuclear/chemical/biological weapons spreading throughout the region. As well as North Korea being vastly rich in resources, which could cause some contention.  When successful I imagine that the international community would be largely interested in the human rights abuses that occurred, additionally South Korea and China, would be concerned with containing the flow of North Korean refugees.

Both the US and South Korea would probably gladly let China have most of NK territory if they're willing to foot the bill for rehabilitating a nation of 30 million brainwashed people. China's economy could probably absorb that blow much better than SK. Also, it's not like China would need to drag NK up to the level of SK or urban China, it just needs to get them on par with rural China.

FutureWhatIf,3de38o,Droidball,2,Thu Jul 16 04:39:56 2015 UTC,"The conditions were that after an officer-involved shooting, an officer has to prove his innocence - not some court or body proving his guilt. It would end up being as much a bunch of bullshit as the kangaroo courts many universities employ to 'handle' sexual harassment or assault allegations.  Aside from that, if he cared at all about his reputation or freedom, he'd undoubtedly have to hire legal representation to aid in his case - likely at his own expense.   If the officer was unable to prove he was innocent - although not having been necessarily proven guilty of any crime -  he would take a forced pay cut for two years. This 'inability to prove innocence' would undoubtedly pave the way for civil suits against that officer and/or the department - necessitating more costly legal representation. This would also open the department up to a major media fiasco if the officer was unable to prove his innocence (Why wasn't he arrested and charged criminally? Why isn't he being fired? Why will he be allowed to return to work?) and even further civil suits using that logic.  As a result of this whole clusterfuck, or just as a result of having a 2-year financial drain on department resources with zero fruits from it (Because he's suspended from his duties, remember?) the officer would be laid off during this 2-year hiatus, or very likely immediately after it ended if laws prohibited it during - now he's gone two years without any work experience in law enforcement, he's going to need to be re-trained and re-tested and re-evaluated, necessitating an even greater drain in department resources.  If he was working in a supervisory position, his union would likely fight for him to maintain that position or an equivalent position, and now you've got someone who hasn't worked in two years just showing up on Monday and he's a Corporal or Sergeant or lead detective.  EDIT: The current investigations process for officer involved shootings already operates with the requirement that lethal force was justified. If there was a reasonable alternative to lethal force in the situation as the officer sincerely perceived and believed it to be, then the use of lethal force was not justified.  If I shoot someone instead of tazing them, when I could have very reasonably tazed them without putting myself or others in unnecessary danger, then my use of lethal force was not justified. I would be suspended or fired, and criminally charged with manslaughter or murder.  These conditions do nothing to increase the accuracy of the current system in place, and instead force someone to prove that they did nothing wrong, and punish them if they are unable to do so.  What happens if there's an officer involved shooting out on a rural road, and the officer's cameras or microphones happened to be non-functional at that time, for whatever reason? The only people there were the officer and the person shot, and there's nothing readily apparent on-scene that shows the officer faced a legitimate need to employ his firearm?  Rather than assume he did the right thing and acted appropriately, we would assume he didn't do the right thing, simply because evidence didn't exist to the contrary."

A few replies ago it was mentioned that China wouldn't join a war against the US (which I find doubtful), because the US is one of their major trade partners. I'm saying that if the US would win a war against the world, either by destroying it or implanting puppet government (which they do), the rest of the world would certainly hate then.

FutureWhatIf,3dacmp,Ohuma,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:46:42 2015 UTC,"UK (and probably France) would back Canada up if the US did try and invade, along with the rest of NATO, up to and including use of nuclear weapons if it came to that.   What do you mean? Do you mean these countries would actively go to war with the United States. Nukes?  If I were to put a percentage on that, I'd say 0%.  Here's why. For one, NATO, while a collection of countries, is heavily manned by the United States. United States would simply vote against any action. France, the UK, and Russia would have to form an alliance, which I am sure Russia would be eager to do.  War is impractical. The United States would likely be outmatched, however the U.S. has several key advantages which forces the aforementioned to not even entertain the idea of military use. The war would be taking place in North America. Whose NAVY is going to take on the United States ? Not only does the United States have more than Russia, UK, and France their NAVY is far superior and their technology is far more advanced. Russia's NAVY is pretty weak despite all the ships they have. The U.S. has a key defensive position already. Another key aspect to consider is resources. Who can compare to the U.S. in this area? Russia could, but what are the chances of them sharing that with U.K. and France? It would be a long drawn out war. Definitely not worth it for any country.  Let us not forget how much disdain Putin has for the current international system. I doubt he would commit troops and resources to fight Americans on any soil, because they would be outmatched. Russia would likely condemn the actions, and sit by and hope that enough countries can knock the U.S. off their pedestal and then join the war (which would never happen since there is 0%) at the end. They'd do this so they can attempt to install their own international system. However, at that point. China would probably laugh at them and threaten to cancel all of their economic deals which would cripple Russia.   Again there would be 0% chance of war, but there is also the strong possibility of our Armed forces revolting and overthrowing the government or simply not obeying commands.   The loss of life would be catastrophic. Absolutely 0 chance those 3 countries (even collectively) amount any sort of incursion -- not for Canada.     As for your 2nd point about pissing off 2.2 billion people. This is the key point.  What would likely happen is a huge global  boycott of all American goods. We would see the UN condemn these actions as well as every other country outside of maybe China, Taiwan, and the Philippines. Global trade would drop tremendously and the UK, Russia, and France would be hit severely if they tried to escape from the international system put in place by the United States. Eventually, they could form some sort of international system without the U.S., but it'd take an incredible amount of time. The economic crash in 2008 would be nothing compared to this.  Russia would likely use this as ammo to continue their imperial dreams and fully invade Ukraine, Moldova, Estonia, Latvia and Georgia. The NATO would disintegrate. They would also do what they could to destabilize countries in the Middle East.  Keep in mind that the U.S. would still have some key allies like Saudi Arabia and important resourceful countries. China would still trade with the United States.  Most likely it wouldn't even get this far. Canada would likely realize the position they're in and cave into American demands. The international community would condemn the action and everything would be forgotten in 5-10 years because the world revolves around America and every country can't afford economic chaos.    However, since OP said negotiations first....Negotiations wouldn't go well at first. Canada would balk at the idea. However, if the U.S. threatened military action, Canada would likely attempt to rally a war party or some defensive pact. Once they realize no country/s would risk it, they would simply concede and proceed to boycott everything American."

You seem more of an expert on the technical side of things whereas I am more theoretical.   Do you think the French submarines having to travel to the west coast of the United States would be much of a problem for them?   Having a huge military doesn't equal to having a strong military.   This was hardly the crux of my argument. It was more about the strategic defensive positions, resources, and technological advantage which would certainly outnumber any sort of number of troops Russian would throw at them (which they wouldn't do anyways)   Also let me remind you that US has fought and won wars only with poorer countries in recent times (Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam) and even then they haven't clearly won 2 of them (Vietnam was a clear loss, Afghanistan is on that route and Iraq....we all know what happened with American ""democracy"" seeds there.)   Which of these other aforementioned countries has been in more serious bouts during the same time frame?   Do you think Canada would just stay there and not make pacts with Russia?   Do you think Russia would make pacts with Canada? You think Russia is going to invade the U.S. on North American soil? Canada would certainly try to make a pact, but good luck to them. Russia is not stupid. They would have more to gain by standing on the sideline. They could invade Ukraine and annex Novorossiya, invade Georgia, Moldova, and probably extend their arm into the 'stans while the U.S. is busy. Without Russia, who would be willing to go to war for BC? UK...France?   China also has extensive trade from BC areas.....do you think they will let Americans take away resources that they might need in the future?   Yes. Without a strong American economy, China's economy would suffer tremendously. Also, China has strengthened economic ties to Russia, home of many natural resources. Even if BC is as important as you think it is, the U.S. is of far greater value to them.   do you think they will let Americans take away resources that they might need in the future? Do you think EU will let US military bases....actually forget EU...Do you think ANY country will let US bases exist on their soil after that   No. But I never argued that any country would. Though, I imagine there would still be several because money usually wins out.   DO you think that US economy can sustain a war against soooo many countries and uprisings from various parts around the world?   I didn't understand this until now -- but you DO think that countries would actually go to war against the U.S. on North American soil? Was is there to gain by liberating (western) Canada, unless they believed that the U.S. would keep annexing other countries (which isn't specified by OP). As I've stated before, there is a 0% chance of war in the scenario outlined by OP BUT if there was a war, do you think those warring economies could sustain during the long bout?  Countries get loans from banks put in place by the U.S. The international monetary system was put in place by the U.S. These countries can't just flip a switch. The world revolves around the U.S. economy. Imagine Greek-like shortfalls in their budget because these countries can't borrow the money needed to pay their debts.  It's not a one way street. The U.S. would be far worse off if they didn't have the capacity and natural resources to become self-sufficient (at least in the short-term)  I appreciate your input. This is highly theoretical, but I don't think you understand the rationale and motives behind each individual country complying with a war against the U.S. To help me better understand you. Tell me first who would go to war with the U.S.A. and tell me why.  It boils down to appeasement versus a world war which would surely be more destructive than anything the world has ever seen. Given the strategic position of the U.S. and their capacity to become self-sufficient, ask yourself if it is rational for the UK, France, and Russia to risk it all simply because the U.S. wants to annex B.C.  Even if you take a look at recent history here. Crimea...? No one batted an eye. Appeasing Hitler - that happened. The difference here is U.S. has superior military strength, best strategic position, most resources.  Buttermilk, hmmm sounds like you've had experience indulging yourself"
FutureWhatIf,3dacmp,Ohuma,-2,Wed Jul 15 03:04:12 2015 UTC,"Let's agree to disagree on this scenario. Russia isn't technologically ""far"" behind as Americans like to tell themselves. And yes they would very much like to have a stake in this because it is one of those few times where they get to show US as a villain. It also will help in widening their trade/ally base from primarily east to both east and west.   You are also mistaking China's reliance on manufacturing with China's reliance on US. They are totally different things. US companies would ditch US in a heartbeat if their profits would be from somewhere else.....look at Burger King (which moved to Canada). So I think your point of China being unable to do anything to protect it's interests from US is incorrect.   Yes and I do think EU would fight US on North American soil. It's the same as attack on Switzerland.....their status of being neutral for so long IS their shield now. Similarly Canada's status is it's shield. Attacking Canada sends a message to the world that no country is safe from US which makes the worlds unipolar against US. Whether you want to believe it or not is a different issue. It wouldn't matter who (EU country) goes to war with US first. The reasoning would be the exact same for most EU nations (except probably UK).   Also American dominance on the banking system is gone. Most countries have joined China led development bank too. And let's assume that US companies sanction China.....are there no other companies that can fill in the vacuum? Of course there are many.   The war is not about liberating Canada. Wars are never fought with the intent to ""liberate"" anyone. That's just PR bullshit that Government says.   I respect your argument, I see from where you are coming. I just don't think it would play out that way. No country can rule the world now.

It also will help in widening their trade/ally base from primarily east to both east and west.   How? Russia tops exports are natural resources. They don't have the capacity, money, or infrastructure to ramp up production in the pace needed to ""help"" their ""allies"" against the U.S.   Russia already trades with the east and west. They're getting swallowed up by Chinese are expanding European markets.   So I think your point of China being unable to do anything to protect it's interests from US is incorrect.   You're confusing forced inaction () with willful inaction. It would be China's choice not to join the fray, not a forced decision by the circumstances. China could do any number of things, but rationality would suggest they wouldn't.   And yes, there would be many corporations that would relocate. But who cares? That's not the point. America is the largest consumer of Chinese goods. Take that away and bye bye Chinese jobs, hello revolt.    Yes and I do think EU would fight US on North American soil.    The European Union does not have a standing army.  Which countries in Europe, or are you suggesting every European Union country getting in on the action? WHY WOULD THEY?   Also Switzerland ≠ Canada.

Not with the ability to fill the void left by the giants.  Countries would have to drastically scale back spending   The war is not about liberating Canada. Wars are never fought with the intent to ""liberate"" anyone.   So why the hell are countries going to war with the U.S.? You still have yet to explain WHY any of these countries would expect for an poor example of violating Switzerland's neutrality. Not only is Canada not neutral, but I find it confusing that you say countries would essentially line up to go to war with the U.S. because we would violate Canada's ""shield"" but they wouldn't go to war because to liberate an good ally. Countries are not sentimental, they're rational. You think Croatia gives two flying shits about who violates Canada's ""shield"" (which doesn't exist) -- no so why would they join the EU and go to war with the U.S.?   I respect your argument, I see from where you are coming. I just don't think it would play out that way. No country can rule the world now.    I am not saying the U.S. rules the world.

FutureWhatIf,3dacmp,SuperFulcrum,2,Wed Jul 15 17:48:32 2015 UTC,"Sometime in December 2015:  An armada of several dozen, very large (at least 1 km in diameter) unknown objects are visually detected in decaying orbit. It is surmised that we only detected them so late because they were somehow radar transparent. The internet is swept with conspiracy theories over national governments, various agencies, the Illuminati, the astronomer community, etc., having known about these threats for who-knows-how-long, and concealing this information from the public.   The objects are tracked visually, by cameras in orbit and on the ground, over the next few days as mass panic sets in. Everyone is either digging in to prepare for the inevitable extinction-level event of a multiple asteroid impact, or blowing life savings on hedonistic revelry, simply offing themselves unceremoniously, or retreating into religious hermitism. The orbits are computed to lead to various impacts across far western Canada and the north Pacific. All willing civilian populations of British Columbia, Alberta, Yukon, and southern Alaska are evacuated or placed into underground shelters in the weeks and days prior to the anticipated 'impact day'.  On the last day of the expected impact, mass panic turns to a mixture of wonder and dread as the objects make a controlled flight through the atmosphere instead of creating a wild light show before final landfall. Astonishingly these objects do not burn up at all, but appear to make a soft landing all over the interior regions of Canada's British Columbia province, from the Cariboo to the Northeast regions. None falls into the Pacific, Alberta, or Yukon.  National military units, provincial law enforcement (along with small numbers of civilians who ignored prior evacuation efforts) jointly begin the mad rush: some to go see what actually landed, to meet E.T., to secure the landing sights for national security purposes, and so on.  All official personnel, visitors and would-be souvenir collectors are uniformly disappointed (or perhaps relieved) to find all of the objects having burrowed themselves deep in the ground after having soft-landed.  Within days, ground-penetrating radar is brought in, revealing that the UFOs are buried hundreds of meters below the surface. Recovery of the artifacts is judged to be impossible in the short term, although digging small tunnels to reach these objects are within practicality. However, such operations would be needlessly complicated by frozen ground and poor weather. The Canadian government in consultation with its allies judges that no (public!) attempts will be made to excavate until early spring of next year.  Over the next few weeks, many other nations of the world begin putting pressure on Canada to open up international access to the many landing sites scattered all across their Pacific coastal region, heretofore declared off-limits from impact day onward to all unauthorized personnel, including Canadian residents near and between the landing sites. Canada resists all diplomatic overtures, threats of sanctions, attempts at bribery, and outright intimidation. Both the U.S. incumbent president and his successor, for their part, have officially supported Canada's sovereign rights over the ""collective right of mankind to experience and understand these visitations from the cosmos"" (to quote the President-Elect), but behind the scenes the administration has exerted its own diplomatic pressures on Canada to allow, if nothing else, access to the sites for U.S. special survey teams.  By March of 2016, Canada reports that it has caught and deported many thousands of illegal aliens who have infiltrated into the forbidden zones, of whom Russian, China, and the U.S. nationals outnumber the rest, themselves outnumbered only by undocumented stateless persons. In the meantime, Canada has begun its own excavation efforts, though these efforts have proceeded at a slow pace due to limited funding and bureaucratic red tape.  Then one day, a certain very charismatic freshman Representative in Congress, destined by the fates to become the 46th President, hits upon a crazy idea that stays with him over the rest of his political career and will mark his historical legacy forever: if British Columbia simply became the 51st state, somehow, then all issues concerning U.S. access and drilling rights to the landing sites (and the technology that must be buried there) would be neatly resolved..."

From a military standpoint, while the low-lying areas in BC aren't terribly difficult to occupy, the Canadian Rockies are enormous, and even if there weren't an invasion across the border anywhere else, the Canadians would get plenty of opportunity to supply guerrillas via mountain roads.  The Yukon is another question.   Given its remoteness, no organized army could operate on either side of the Alaska border, leading to a long and bloody skirmish for both sides, made up primarily of rangers and other light infantry living off the land, cut off from any reliable logistical train.  This is to say nothing of the fifth column.

Over a dozen nations are flying airstrikes, half a dozen nations are providing ground troops with even more providing material for ground troops. But Urban warfare is not easy when you care about civilian casualties, it can be building by building dragging on for weeks. And as our decade of occupation shows, if you don't have the support of the locals there's only so much you can do.   ISIS started out as a fanatical apocalypse cult in the Syrian civil war, everything they did and said was about bringing about the end times of humanity (The ""black flag"" they wave has a special meaning, it's supposed to be of the group that will lead the charge against pure evil in the final battle of humanity where Mohammad will return and bring about the end of the world). But it's morphed (at least in Iraq) into just about the only outlet that Iraqi Sunnis can have any power. That's why the Iraqi army in the Sunni areas didn't fight ISIS but in the Shi'a areas they do. We kicked the Sunnis out of power, saying anyone part of Saddam's Ba'ath party had a lifetime ban on serving in the government. The problem is, that meant just about every prominent and politically active person in the Sunni areas of Iraq were now forbidden from serving in their own government. I don't think I'd support that kind of government either. And they might not like ISIS (in fact many of the generals have open contempt for a lot of ISIS's more wacky parts) but for many it was a choice between them and a government that refused to let them participate.  That's why it's not just already solved ""once and for all."" It's a fucking complicated thing where the west is essentially flying air support for Iran. Iran. That's the kind of bedfellows ISIS has made, the US and Iran are openly working with each other to defeat them. If ISIS wern't so extreme, and it was just a Sunni led insurrection without all the apocalypse cult stuff, there's no way the US would have a military alliance with Iran to fight them.

FutureWhatIf,3d4imq,selfhatingyank,6,Tue Jul 14 22:13:01 2015 UTC,"There's an overwhelming federal response from the FBI and ATF against the organization and all related organizations at the orders of President Biden. Even tangentially-related groups are heavily investigated. The majority of the core members of the responsible group and many of their allies are arrested, tried, and eventually convicted.   The GOP candidates have every single remark regarding the rebel flag heavily scrutinized, and they're severely damaged for saying anything that can be interpreted as a permissive attitude for it and for white supremacists: Anything about ""respecting traditions"", ""states rights"", etc.   By act of Congress the majority of racist groups in the USA, if they or their members have ever been associated with violence against people in word or deed, are classified as a terrorist organization.   Hillary Clinton, the near-certain Democratic nominee, vaults into a major lead over the Republican contenders. The GOP field is in chaos; major contenders consider bowing out over what now looks like an unwinnable election, not wishing to be the sacrificial candidate of 2016.  The 2016 election sees almost no criticism of Obama or his policies; the GOP tells its members to not say anything negative, and those who break ranks see all support disappear. Except for the obnoxious pundit class, people speak with respect for Obama. This lasts for a couple of years.  In 2016 Clinton and the Democrats win in a landslide. They get to 260 of the House and 63 seats in the Senate. (The Democrats already have a statistical advantage going into 2016 in the Senate, since a lot of the Republicans who'd won in 2010 only did so because of reaction against Obamacare. Now, Democrats have only 10 seats to re-elect while Republicans have 23, making the GOP very vulnerable even in OTL.)  Clinton's first item of business is a big move on firearms, demanding tighter controls on sales and movement of firearms. Republicans aren't positioned to argue much against it. Firearms law take center stage while the Democrats have momentum.  By summer 2016, the Democrats pass new gun laws with a filibuster-proof majority. The key component of the law is the completion of a mental health and criminal background check and the completion of a federal firearms use and safety course. The same law also creates a national ID card to facilitate the system. The law has retroactive effect; current firearms owners have 2 years to complete the course and background checks.  Following the law's passage, supreme court justices begin retiring. Justices Ginsburg and Kennedy announce their intention to retire within a few months of each other."

Considering how immediate terrorist and national security threats are in the modern world, the US executive branch ought to be headed by an individual.  While I like the idea of a council of five, it's simply not realistic for the United States in the same manner gun control or nationalization efforts are. They can be great ideas, but isn't pertinent to a model like the US.  In another sense, for a generic democratic society with three branches of government like the US, one could devise a system like such:  Five ""Chancellors"" let's call them, all vote for the Executive Branch. Each Chancellor serves terms of 5 years and each chancellor slot is open for election a different year. So that each year in the US is an election for the ""council of five"" due to this rotation. That way, if the US public is unhappy with the council's policies, a change of just one chancellor would change the direction of policies (assuming the council is voting on decision with a 3/5 majority requirement) while not drastically pulling the executive branch behind with training a new chancellor, introducing him or her to diplomats, etc.. A 4/5 vote could be required to veto bills from congress, too.  I love the idea. But I think the President's obligations on diplomacy and that decisions can be too complex to be mandated by a group (a group could say ""end the teacher's strike by granting higher wages"", an individually empowered leader could make complex orders that some members of a council would refuse to vote on like ""agree to pension raises but ban the unions"""

A series of Mexico-style cartel shootouts plague Southeastern Turkey.  2016: Erdogan vows to build a fence along the Syrian-Turkish border to stop ""criminal thugs and gangsters"" from infiltrating the Turkish heartland. In a taped video, ISIS members threaten to ""raise the black flag of Jihad over Ankara"" if he proceeds.   2016: ISIS loses a fair amount of territory in Iraq, including the city of Mosul, but retains most of the oil and gas as well as many of the historic sites that it has been looting for antiquities. In response to the losses, ISIS decides to focus on a campaign of elaborate ""9/11""-style attacks on members of the anti-ISIS alliance, including the Gulf monarchies. 2016-2017 becomes a year of bloodshed in many of the monarchies. At the same time, a Grexited Greece expands its residency-by-investment program and attracts a large number of terrorized Qatari, Emirati, and Saudi investors.  2017: After Erdogan foolishly attends a groundbreaking for the new ""anti-ISIS, anti-PKK"" wall along Turkey's southern border, he is shot dead by an ISIS fighter. ISIS simultaneously launches a synchronized attack on the major cities of Turkey, releasing Assad's nerve gas in the Ankara metro line and bombing a number of crucial Europe-Asia links in greater Istanbul, including the Marmaray. In the resulting chaos, two men (one from Erdogan's AK Parti and one from a parliamentary anti-Erdogan coalition that holds a majority of seats) proclaim themselves leader, with the AK Parti candidate proclaiming a presidential republic and the parliamentary candidate proclaiming a European-style parliamentary republic, headquartered in Istanbul, with himself as Prime Minister and a figurehead president. One government is set up in Istanbul, and one in Ankara; much of rural Asian Turkey is seized either by Islamists, by gangsters, or by Kurds (who are grudgingly welcomed even by some ethnic Turks).   2019: NATO suspends Turkey owing to the great level of instability in Anatolia and governmental uncertainty, while committing forces to shore up the Bosporus. Most European countries recognize the Istanbul government, which is consolidating control over the European portion of Turkey, over the unstable Ankara government. Greece agrees to commit troops to defend Istanbul if either Anatolian or ISIS forces attempt to descend on it. Putin attempts to take advantage of the disarray in NATO by marching on Kiev and attempting to invade Finland and/or Estonia; however, his generals launch a Kremlin coup attempt that devolves into a civil war, with Asian Russia (Siberia) essentially being controlled by warlords. The big winner is Greece; millions of the most affluent affluent, educated Russians, Turks, and Arabs have bought permanent residence in Greece, moving the banks and stocks with them. Decades of prosperity lead to Greece becoming the dominant power of the East Mediterranean."

FutureWhatIf,3clp8b,slapnflop,5,Fri Jul 10 00:52:21 2015 UTC,"That's funny you mention this being ""what if and not how it can't be"" because ""what if"" isn't in the title or the prompt at all.  But I'll bite, because you bring up a good point about the recover of South Korea. The main difference is that South Korea received a whole ton of FDI and aid money from the West because it had been devastated by an invasion from a Communist aggressor, and because it was seen as a bulwark against the spread of communism itself. Greece, on the other hand, is in the situation it is because of a myriad mix of shitty government policy, a shitty cultural of irresponsibility, and ignoring the growing problem, which has all then been greatly exacerbated by the austerity measures imposed on it by the troika. It's path out of it's current situation is getting long term loans with low interest penalties and fixing it's fiscal policy and tax collection problems. It's up for debate which of those two should come first. South Korea, instead, was rebuilt with direct assistance and investment because it was clearly and truly a humanitarian crisis, for which it wasn't responsible, and the West had a tremendous interest in rebuilding it (yes, much more than the West does in keeping Greece in the Euro.)   The two situations from their onsets are wholly different. But... if you want to sort of level set and say they're the same, and move forward from there, there are also other reason why the two will take entirely different paths. For South Korea, they had to rebuild, which meant putting in place modern (for the time) infrastructure and manufacturing capital. Greece has nothing physical to rebuild, and if it wishes to update it infrastructure and industries, that means more money they need to borrow from already exhausted lenders.   Effectively, even though it had just been through a devastating war, South Korea was in a better place to recover because they had a blank canvas build upon and an international community dedicated to getting them back to prosperity. Greece is still mired by the society and the culture that caused the problems in the first place, and must face an international community who would rather see them become a third world nation then continue to throw good money after bad.  Continuing, the growth of South Korea is also due to it's population explosion, brought on by modernization of farming methods. Greece already has modern farming methods but faces population decline. South Korea also was able to serve as a trade hub, not just between it's growing domestic market, but also as a finished goods exporter for the also-exploding countries around it. Greece won't see that happen.   On top of ALL THAT, South Korea's growth is in the post war period is seen as an 'economic miracle.' Their export focused policies brought about rapid and tremendous economic development. Greece literally couldn't do that as it's surrounded by exporters, with better civil societies, governance, infrastructure and capital. Wholly different from South Korea.  But since you're saying I haven't supplied a good ""how it could..."" here goes:  Greece exits the Euro, and immediately devalues it's currency to the point of hyperinflation.   The Greek public sees it's real wages sink below that of Chinese workers, Vietnamese workers, and Taiwanese workers. It becomes an undeveloped country.  Greece cancels every and all pension it owes to it's public sector employees and allows it's companies to do the same for their private sector employees. For some reason Greeks all decide this is fine and decide to stay and work as hard as they can their whole lives anyway. Millions of Greek pensioners die.  Once the currency stablizes at 'a wheelbarrow of cash for a loaf of bread' point, a large group of billionaires step in and loan Greece somewhere on the order of a hundred billion dollars, at an extremely low interest rate, able to be paid back over a century.  Half of that money goes to it's preexisting creditors to buy it some time, while the other half goes directly into a 21st century power grid, high speed commercial rail lines, and zero interest loans for manufacturing investment.  Greeks also start cranking out children, all educated freely, by a yet-to-be-developed big data approach to education.   Other commercial ports of call in the region collapse for whatever reasons (Turkey, Italy, Spain) so Greece becomes the main entry point for international goods into the south European market.   Greece builds upon it's successes and decided to ignore any historical value of it's land. Within thirty years the Greece shore is littered with deep bottom commercial ports.   There you have it. Greeks make next to nothing, are all under 50, attract zero tourism because they've destroyed their historical heritage in the name of progress, are magically the best educated workers in the world, and enjoy the best, most outlandish infrastructure projects of any country. Finally, Greece as become the 'major economic power' OP has asked for."

It is still true that mathematically (beyond a certain time frame of several hundred years) we all share all our ancestors.  Any human living in Europe 2000 years ago (actually even 800 years ago) either has no descendants at all or all Europeans (and actually, Asians...) are descended from him/her.  It is pretty simple math, and the DNA evidence backs up that ""movement"" was fast enough to spread our ancestry around far enough for the math to actually work out on a European level (this is a nice article about it)  That said, you don't acually carry genes from all your ancestors, you'll actually only have genes from a small fracture of them; most likely those that contributed most of your ancestors (so ""slavic DNA"" for Poland). Gene drift was slow enough that we can still differentiate between many groups genetically.  Your way of looking at it is more useful, btw - as it tells us sth. about population movements and admixtures. My way of looking at it is a bit less meaningful, but it is true and a nice way of showcasing the power of exponential growth.  Re: ""jewish DNA"". The traditional (ethnic) groups of Jews are actually a noticable subset if you use DNA to parse them (you cannot really differentiate French from German; you can differentiate between the Irish and the English); you can also clearly differentiate between Jewish (by heritage) people and for example other Europeans, they are closer to Palestinians, e.g. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_studies_of_Jewish_origins.)

FutureWhatIf,3clp8b,silverence,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:29:50 2015 UTC,"It's the other way around: It's mathematically impossible to not share universal common ancestors relatively recently.  What's more important than the math is geography. That math is dead right: If you go back a certain number of generations, the ""doubling"" of necessary ancestors necessarily means the people alive today must have a huge amount of common ancestors, and, by the math, there was someone about 3,400 years ago who is an ancestor to every human being.  But geographically that was impossible until about 1492. The math doesn't account for total geographic separation between the Old World and New. Unless the Vikings interbred with Natives when they landed in Canada, the Americas were entirely isolated from the Old World from around 25,000 B.C. to 1492 (and if Vikings did interbreed, it's still only about ~1,000 AD when Europeans and Native Americans can share ancestors after 25,000 B.C.).  If the observation noted in the article had been made 500 years ago, it would have been mathematically right but geographically wrong.  I think the Americas (and maybe islands like Hawaii) is the only case where this is relevant. Otherwise, even relatively disparate populations like people in England and Japan would wind up having lots of common ancestors relatively recently; all it takes is one traveler from Japan to have a child in Russia, who has a child in France, who has a child in England. Throw it into a shaker for 1000 years and now everyone in England is descended from that Japanese traveler."

For comparison, in Afghanistan the U.S. military has been fighting for over a decade against forces that are better armed (having mortars, RPGs, artillery shell-based IEDs, and various war rifles). The people they are fighting know war - before the U.S. came it was internal conflicts. Before that, the Soviets, before that, more internal, before that, the British, etc. These people know war and they know their very challenging and difficult home terrain where they can just blend - obviously, culturally, and even with language - back into the general population when need be. They are fanatically-driven, many unafraid of death to the point that they will use themselves as suicide bombers.  And yet, in over a decade of fighting, these forces with all these advantages that exceed that of Americans in basically every way have not fully overrun a single American base.

FutureWhatIf,3chbbk,Huntred,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:46:08 2015 UTC,"but still effectively control vast swathes of rural Afghanistan. That's asymmetric warfare for you.   Yes, they do control areas that are difficult to access, that are generally remote and have little/no direct contact with larger urban areas - not relying on them for trade goods, power, food, and so forth and so they are fairly self-sufficient and able to maintain their simple lifestyle in even a peacetime footing.  Basically, this does not exist in the USA, where the only ""off the grid"" areas are so remote as to be easily isolatable and dealt with accordingly. Considering the 2nd Amendment doesn't extend to air defense systems, those folks - who are likely within easy strike range of wealths of ground-based attack craft launched from military and civilian air bases located all over the nation - are boned.   which is sparsely populated but crawling with nuke   Well, the nukes stop crawling long before open hostilities begin. But let's have these rebels try for massive, coordinated, somehow undetected yet incredibly effective mass raids on existing launch tubes. In this case, I am not sure what kind of experts these militia groups have but I would say few are  technically capable of properly dismantling an ICBM in order to get the warheads that they could threaten to detonate elsewhere. Fewer still are going to be capable of taking, targeting, and launching such a system if they just wanted to threaten to launch against DC.   In any case, this assumes that the government is just standing by and while insurrectionists crawl over their nuclear silos, which they would not. The government would either harden them against attack, sabotage/lock/self-destruct the hardware, or outright destroy them with other weapons systems. Be assured that the military has thought about and prepared for some renegade group trying to take over a silo for decades longer than the attackers will have."

My point is that it IS essentially a combat rifle, but without burst fire, which most people agree is mostly used for suppressive fire and is really, really good at burning up ammo for no effect.   I'm saying that a lot of people who own AR's currently, and use them regularly, probably have aim that is at least as good as a soldiers if not better.  They will certainly be lacking in the tactics area but that is unimportant. It's harder to demoralize a guerilla faction then it is a mobilized military force. Also, the death of 10, or even 100 ""freedom fighters"" for every ""trained combatant"" is definitely worth it, attrition still wins out, if moral and logistics doesn't first.

And I'm saying that that is entirely wrong at every angle. Professional soldiers are taught in a professional army that draws upon analysis of countless battles and man-millennia of combat experience to teach their soldiers how to use their weapons effectively and that is going to outweigh the self-taught experience of hunters and over-confident owners every time. Also that soldier is going to be in much better shape than his civilian counterpart as here's one of your civilian warfighters.  And that's just a one-on-one comparison. At the next level, basic tactics, the professional soldier is far better trained at everything. Movement coordination, room clearing, setting up ambushes (what works and what doesn't), basic navigation, medical training, so forth. Nightfighting alone - you call them unimportant but those skills are actually essential and that's why it takes months of intense training of pre-approved candidates to instill them into a human. Just because someone saved up enough to buy an AR-15 doesn't make them their equal by any measure.  Then there's a whole other layer that civilians cannot touch. Let's just look at one - communication. The military will have it, civilians will not. How do you think these scattered people are going to even find each other, let alone plan coordinated, effective attacks? Through texting via their cell phones? Secret groups on Facebook? GRMS radios?  Do you think civilian GPS is going to work in a combat zone? The military can turn that stuff off with a switch. I don't think you have any idea how just communication control can dominate a battlefield.   And then there are the incomparable weapon assets. How's that AR-15 looking against a tank? How is anything against air forces of which there is no counterpart in the civilian world. Recon drones just loitering, watching pudgy dudes fall out of a minivan as they move towards a government building. One Hellfire missile and those guys are no longer a problem.    When you invade someones home turf, be ready for them to do some really unpredictable things.   Again, back to Afghanistan. The military is up against a people who have fought wars on their home turf for generations. They have far more experience at warfighting than any stock American has. They know the country like the back of their hands. They speak the language and have an intrinsic knowledge of the culture and tribal system that the military does not and so forth.

I mean, they have no real concept on how to fight an asymmetric war, let alone one on their own turf.   The hell they don't - again, look at the battles. If you don't win battles, you don't win a civil war.  There are two major ways the Taliban manages to be successful in Afghanistan:  1) They say to regular people, ""Look, the Americans are here now, but they are going to leave like every invader has before. When they leave, we're going to still be here. If you don't help us now, we will come after you and kill you and your family - either now or when the American's leave.  2) The presence of the American forces acts as a recruitment and fundraising tool for those across the entire region. People send support from other, stable countries because they feel the Americans are a threat to their way of life. Other people flock into the area from other countries to take over for their seen-as brothers who fight and die in earlier fighting. It's sort of like an obscene bug-zapper, with every zap sound drawing more and more into the fight. And then they are killed.   Neither of these methods work to gain rebel support in an internal civil war in the US. Americans threatening other Americans into compliance is not going to garner much support because the military isn't leaving to go back anywhere - it's either winning or dying. And we are not going to see large numbers of Canadians and Mexicans donating money or sneaking over our borders to help out in the fight.  And no matter what, it is certain that the military's knowledge pool on fighting asymmetric warfare is far deeper than that of the average American civilian."

Likewise if it was something like a bunch of survivalist nutcases shooting at the police to avoid a 0.5% tax on ammunition they would have very little support and generally the country would be in favor of the government cracking down on them as needed, and the US military would definitely shoot back at crazies shooting at them.  The military would very plausibly refuse an order to gun down peaceful protestors, but that is probably not what a rebellion would look like.

NATO also enforces troops in Poland and other nations neighboring Russia as fear of Russia attempting to retake and break off other countries is now real.

The partitioning of Germany was done in the context of Germany having just lost a war of aggression that it really ""deserved"" to lose, whereas in this case Russia is straight up conquering and annexing a big chunk of Ukraine. There's going to be a lot more negative repercussions for Russia than just having a bunch of NATO forces build up on their border. Russia's trying to play the role of the USSR here when it doesn't have anywhere near the economic or military muscle to back it up.  I would expect ruinous sanctions exacerbated by an attempt by Russia at an arms race, and quite possibly a grindingly bloody occupation beset by Ukranian partisans and sabotage. Ukraine has developed enough of a national identity of late that the East will contain a heck of a lot of people who will chafe under Russian control. And rebuilding the Donbass is going to cost Russia an arm and a leg too, the region was already an economic albatross before it got wrecked by the current occupation.  So I think we might see a repeat of the Cold War on fast-forward, with a Russian economic collapse leading to yet more of its holdings breaking away afterward.

People on both sides are convinced that they're being outspent and thwarted at every level by unprincipled billionaires and special interests, and that America is being taken from them in a real, existential way.  It starts in early 2016 with a single act of political violence - a bizarre mass shooting at a local Republican rally - and an ineffective police investigation, pressured and interfered with by people on all sides to come up with the ""right"" answer to the suspect's actual motives.  Contradictory information coming out of press conferences doesn't ease any tensions, and then there's another shooting at a Democratic caucus.  The dam bursts, as unstable and well-armed people start shooting at all kinds of political events - targeting people they oppose, targeting people they theoretically support but think would make better martyrs (in a false-flag operation, of course) than living candidates, and shooting at unrecognized guests anywhere they seem suspicious.  More of the shooters are Republican than Democrat, but there's still more than enough bloodshed on both sides.    The normal local political processes begin to break down, as holding any kind of party function becomes impossible without an extensive police presence, and once someone gets the nerve to bring body armor and a high-powered rifle - or a car bomb - even the police are of little help, if they dare to show up at all.  President Obama knows that most steps he could feasibly take to restore order would cause panic and screams about martial law, and tries to let the state governments handle it for as long as possible - even up to Election Day.  With Election Day 2016 comes the most tremendous wave of violence, as armed politically-minded bands, apparently acting independently, target polling stations in opposition areas, set up illegal checkpoints to prevent the free flow of people, bomb the sites where mail-in and early ballots are stored, or just plain start shooting each other.  Most state Secretaries of State refuse to certify election results, as very few precincts could claim to have gotten anything like a fair election result.  No candidate could possibly claim 270 electoral votes.  A suit quickly reaches the Supreme Court.  The minority opinion points out that the Constitution has a provision for this - disputed elections go to the House of Representatives.  Many feel that this would be an unjust outcome, since many feel that the party controlling the House was primarily responsible for most of the political violence; with this, perhaps, in mind, the majority picks a different approach.  Declaring that, despite the Constitution's requirement, 'no election actually took place', the Supreme Court orders Obama to use whatever means necessary to restore order and assist the states in holding new elections 'with all possible speed'.  SO ORDERED, President Obama begins the process of using the military to lock down major urban centers, sweep the countryside for illegal partisan bases, and otherwise 'restore order'.  Drones are involved.  Not surprisingly, regardless of their opinion of Obama's motives, people are horrified by martial law.  And, not surprisingly, the House of Representatives, and most of the right-wing media world, feels that the Supreme Court's majority decision is, ahem, bullshit.  A perceived statistical imbalance in the alleged party affiliations of mass shooters is certainly no reason to disregard the Constitution!  And so the House of Representatives chooses their own presidential candidate, a relative nobody - a populist-speaking freshman Congressman - selected because all the big players agreed he could be controlled.  Fox News and some, but not all, right-wing radio shows and blogs embrace the Congressionally-chosen candidate as, indeed, the new president.  Everyone else agrees that the House is just being the House - doing pointless things because they can - and tries to press on with organizing the new election.  Restoring order is hard, though, with such a complete breakdown and the number of crazies with guns far outnumbering the soldiers available for martial law.  The new elections can't be held until well after January 20th, 2017, and that's when it no longer matters: the House-chosen President takes the oath of office on the steps of the capital building, and calls on Obama to stand down, vacate the government, and abort the elections.  Obama refuses.  At this point, it is discovered just how much of the United States military gets all of their information from Fox News and other such sources, and just how much they took it to heart: the Army general responsible for restoring order in Washington DC leads the House president onto the White House grounds in a convoy of tanks and armored cars.  Obama and his staff flee to Mount Weather, but are arrested by the base commander, who himself feels that the House president is in the right.  Secret Service operatives fire on the soldiers in an attempt to buy Obama and his family time to escape, but they are completely outgunned.  It is not immediately clear if Obama will survive his injuries.  When word spreads, people would be ready to riot - but the military has already been stationed in major cities for many weeks, and search-and-destroy missions have already obliterated many of the troublemakers.  Many in the military waver at first, but enough officers declare for the House president, and do so fast enough, that the momentum is solidly on his side, and no sizable units mutiny - though some desert.  The new round of elections are cancelled - since the ballots would give everyone a chance to vote for president, and the House president's name would not be on that ballot, and that pesky Supreme Court ruling was still hanging about, they would threaten his legitimacy.  Of course, the elections were also needed to fill tens of thousands of other political offices nationally and decide all manner of other local issues, but that, the new Commander-in-Chief feels, is an acceptable loss.  With martial law already in place basically everywhere, the local commanders can rule by decree to fill in for any civilian roles that were vacated by the lapse in elections (or murdered in the chaos).  Soon, the new president promises, when order is restored, and all the dangerous partisan actors are dealt with, the ban on all political gatherings, organizations, and elections will be lifted.  Political speech, news about things that aren't sports or entertainment, gathering in groups in public areas - these things will all be allowed again.  Soon.  Just not, y'know, today.

In a comedy of errors, they've managed to tie the national vote, but ironically, the electoral college goes to Bernie.  2017: The government is stalling harder than a rusted Pontiac on a hot freeway. Bernie keeps shooting down what laws manage to make it to his doorstep and anything he suggests is shot down in Congress. Tea partyers refuse to even acknowledged him as a legitimate president. Right wing conspiracies are at an all time high.   2018: Early in January, Bernie manages to get the UN support to go to war with ISIL. He officially tries to make it legit by sending it  through Congress, the first time in the 21st century. Congress votes against it. Disenchanted, Bernie restructures it as a police action, enraging Congress and a good chunk of the American public.  2019 & 2020: The war goes swimmingly. ISIL is knocked out by the end of 2019 and by 2020, the area has quieted down, with the terrorists fleeing to Yemen to regroup. Bernie's support for the Kurds and the rebels proves to be somewhat controversial, particularly with the Turks and Israel.  TBC..."

The Republicans paint him as a war monger that refuses to cooperate with Congress on any worthwhile level. Rand Paul's libertarian views seem to be a hit with the young iGeneration, who have grown distrustful of Democrats due to the perceived failures of the Obama administration. This is enough to split the popular vote practically down the middle, taking the electoral college with it. Bernie keeps his presidency, but now has to deal with an Old school, evangelical vice president put in place only to appeal to older voters.   2021: They put a monkey's brain in a robot's body. This is irrelevant to the story, but I felt it prudent to make a bizzaro reference to show no one under 25 really remembers.  Meanwhile, a lame duck Congress is gone and now Democrats have control of both House and the Senate. This makes some corporate types very nervous. A plan needs to be crafted. Luckily, there is a sitting vice president that is Republican. There is also a some minor storms a brewing that they can easily make big.  2022: Bernie cuts the military budget after defeating ISIL. It seems the US can't pull away from the region however, as tensions flare up between the Kurds and Turks, while Yemen is growing hotbed for terrorist activity, Saudi Arabia has a growing dissidence movement, and Israel and Palestine are still themselves.  To make matters worse, the cuts weren't specified and instead of cutting toys, the cut the pay and retirement plans of servicemen and women.  2023: Bernie passed the Gun Microchip Act after a devastating shooting spree. The GMA requires information to be transmitted to police every time the gun is discharged, transmitting the number of shots fires, the owner of the gun, and the area of the gunfire to the police. Older guns can be recorded as such, or turned in for z new one for a tax break Cameras are rumored to be next to the barrell. Gun nuts are going apeshit over this and they are getting rather vocal.

Greece is in a prime position to capitalize on that to kick-start its economy five years down the track.  European Economy would take a big kick.  Not only has the EuroZone taken an ideological beating, but the Grexit has just basically written off hundreds of billions in loans that have defaulted.  That's going to have effects.  Countries like Portugal and Spain are already in a precarious position, and the Grexit might have a twofold effect of punishing their finances....as well as emboldening their own anti-austerity movements.  The Euro might slip and skirt around another Recession as it begins to re-balance after the exit, and the Euro won't be seen as such a safe bet after all.  Unpleasant, but survivable.

And several nations have ICBM's and/or sub launched ones. It does not make them invulnerable.  It would be very interesting how they pulled it off - antimatter is really hard to produce with our current technology. Per Wikipedia:   Thus, at the current level of production, an equivalent of a 10 Mt hydrogen bomb, about 250 grams of antimatter will take 2.5 billion years of the energy production of the entire Earth to produce.    There are a couple of seriously significant non military side effects to having the ability to produce antimatter quickly and cheaply:  Firstly - energy crisis, what energy crisis? Peak oil becomes a mere historical footnote.   Secondly: the entire solar system and possibly beyond just got opened up. Think journey times in weeks or months instead of years.  Of course there's the minor detail of persuading NK to share - China I suspect has the best chance though the NK regime isn't exactly known for gratitude (when China sent aid trains with food a during a famine, NK kept the trains and made the crews walk home). Nevertheless they understand NK and have contacts better than anyone, have proximity, and military might to spare.  Also the Chinese government has a large proportion of engineers - I'd bet they would cotton to the applications quicker than you could say ""New Beijing colony, Cydonia""  As for the rest of the world: crash priority research programmes all round in the US, Europe and Russia - potentially with some cooperation between the first two.

I'm a rank amateur when it comes to this kind of stuff, but I'll try my best. Feel free to blow me out of the water if I screw up.  First and foremost, we'll see larger calibers on the battlefield. NATO (and by extension Europe and Russia) will probably make the move from 5.56 back to 7.62 - maybe (and most likely) bigger, depending on how well the armour can take punishment. In the short term we'll see less law enforcement / military casualties as combatants struggle to adapt, but this number will invariably start climbing as we better understand how to defeat this armour.  You used the word 'mass produced', so I'll assume this stuff is relatively cheap and/or easy to make. If this is the case, militaries will simply upscale the tech and slap it on vehicles. Nanotube hardened APCs, tanks, planes - we'll probably start building with it too. Explosives will be less effective against vehicles. Against combatants with little to no chance of adapting to this change, (insurgents, guerrillas - I'm sure some will come to mind) you will see less boots and more wheels. No need to risk lives when your APC can absorb direct RPG hits.  In a nutshell:   Larger calibers. Bigger guns. More recoil, less mobility. Initially, less casualties. As we figure out how to break this armor better, casualties will begin to climb. Hardier vehicles. On certain fronts, this will begin a 'less boots, more wheels' mentality.

No leadership and no cult of personality would break the spirits of the army, likely causing disbanding and fractionalization. Your chances go up in the event you get more of them on your side.

Your only hope would be to either surrender to China and serve that role as buffer, albeit with less insanity and more human rights, or to appeal to South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. for help, which most likely won't help as you're not worth risking world war 3 over. No matter what, North Korea is gonna be with China, the question is if you're alive to see it, which you won't if you fight them. They like the buffer.

Everybody knew political intrigue was thick on the ground in the halls of the USSC, but for a sitting Supreme Court Justice to go so far as to actually try to bribe and intimidate a fellow jurist is the straw that broke the camel's back.  Congressional hearings are called and Scalia is escorted into Congress by his newly assigned protective detail. Since the accusations, Scalia has been barred from his offices, and has been avoiding publicity, but a low murmur runs through the assembled statesmen at his light step and ready grin.  As the hearing progresses however, it is revealed that Justice Scalia, in his infinite  wisdom, long ago realized that his impeccable judical actions would eventually land him in hot water with certain political stripes.  To the surprise of all the liberal attack dogs gnashing their teeth at the prospect of tearing down a sitting conservative justice, Scalia has made a habit of recording all interactions in his SC offices. After securing promises that the recordings will be retrieved under the watchful eye of a CSPAN camera crew and reviewed live, Scalia submits the combination to the hidden safe holding his recorder and videos, but not the encryption code for the content.  Back in the Congressional Hearing:  After calling witnesses to testify to and confirm Scalia's unexpected expertise in video surveillance techniques, Scalia is  confirmed as an expert witnesses on his own behalf, and publicly verifies, with oppostion witnesses grudgingly agreeing, that the recorder and videos have not been tampered with.  With the broadest shit eating grin the world has ever seen, almost unable to contain his glee, Scalia successfully argues that the video pertaining to the meeting with the honorable Justice Kennedy where he was accused should be played in front of the American public, in open Congress.  Almost immediately, the hands of every committee member cups over their respective microphones as the frosted heads come together. A bare half dozen words are heard, unexpectedly loud, as the freshman Congressman, in his eagerness to make his mark in his first important Congressional duty forgot to cover his lapel mike: ""Goddamnit, what do we do now?""   Scalia's longtime political foes turn purple on camera as he openly laughs at the breach. In a gratingly charitable act, Scalia suggests that it might be prudent to all parties concerned if they were to declare an overnight recess while the Committee reformulated a voice of consensus.  Worse for his opponents was the obvious relief such a respite would afford them, and worse still was that that relief was not only plainly visible to the American public, but commented on endlessly in the next 24 hour news cycle.  But worse still yet, before the gavel was finally sounded, Scalia successfully argued that the videos in question should not only be submitted into evidence before the conclusion of the day's events, but that they should be stored where they lay, on the defense's table, with cameras from every agency that wished to participate in the verifacation process aimed at the pile of putatively incriminating videos, providing a live internet video feed to preclude arguments of tampering.  While unconventional, the members of the hearing committee are too shaken to oppose the spirit of transparency in such a request.  The next day:  While Scalia's popularity had not statistically improved overnight, the opposite was true of his opposition. Within their districts, some committee members staff leaked as much as a 30% drop in support directly attributable to the preceding day's events.  As the hearings open, the first action, decided by public polling in such numbers the the committee could not refuse, was the public viewing on the video evidence presented by Scalia.  The video opens on a corner view of Scalia's office as Justice Kennedy bursts through the door.   SCJ Kennedy: ""You know you're going to have to vote ""for*"" on this Obamacare shit, right?""  SCJ Scalia: ""I don't know man, I really feel like I should vote ""against*"".""  SCJK: ""is your funeral, dude. Ever since I took that money from New London I've been bought and paid for.""  SCJS: ""I told you that one was a stinker. You're a real fucking idiot sometimes, you know?""  SCJK: ""Trust me, I know. The wife won't let it go sometimes. But really I got a lot of pressure to produce a result here. You sure you can't help me out?""  SCJS: ""Sorry bro, I wish I could, but my convictions are just too strong. Look at that Kelo fiasco. It's still a vacant lot. You forced familys out of their home for a cut of what? Jack shit? And the city is on the hook for $80 million in legal costs so Pfizer could walk away with no string attached?  SCJK: ""Hey now, that's a low blow. We both know I stood to make stacks on stacks on stacks on stacks if that went through. Hate the game not the player.  SCJS: ""Yeah, whatever, I need to get some work done, are we finished here?""  SCJK: ""Look, I'm just a flunky, it's not me calling the shots, I'm just passing on the message I was told to. You play your cards like you think they ought to be played.""  SCKS: ""I guess that's what I'll do."" As SCJK turns to walk out of the room, SCJS faces the camera and winks.  The hearing chamber erupts in laughter as the chairman bangs his gavel for order. After long moments the room finally dies down and the chairman dismisses the charges against SCJ Scalia while announcing a new hearing for SCJ Kennedy.  Aftermath:  Before the newly stripped of power SCJK could be found, more of SCJS's videos are reviewed, high lighting abused of authority by other members of the Supreme Court, prompting still more investigations.  After two weeks, SCJK is found behind a Walmart supercenter, having committed suicide, with the note indicating shame at taking bribes in the Kelo/New London case.  By the end, the newly landslide elected Republication President seats a solid conservative majority in the Court for the next ~50ish years.   In 2021, the Kelo eminent domain ruling is used to confiscate former SCJK's family home in order to turn it into a museum against judical corruption."

The election of 2060 are a brawl between the conservative candidate William Walker, a former Marine Artillery Colonel, a veteran of the American wars in Mexico and Sudan.   And Maria Garcia-Montoya, a communist and the first foreign born candidate since the Supreme Court ruled that the right to run for office is open to any citizen, regardless of the native land of birth.   The night before the election, a bomb blast kills William Walker. Riots break out. Blame is placed on Maria and the liberals. Soon Maria is killed by an active duty marine sniper team.   Liberal protest turn into counter-riots. Both sides clash in the cities. Turning bloody, police are quickly overran.   The national guard are called in but for 20 years all ranks of the military have been filled by only conservatives. The guard joins in the fighting.   In conservative majority areas, liberals are lynched. In liberal majority areas, usually cities, conservatives are forced into the countryside.   The regular army is called in, but whole units are deserting to either return home to protect family or join the fighting.   The initial chaos is referred to as 'The Purge'. Where all levels of government and control were lost and total lawlessness took over.   Finally as opposition was crushed, cities were put back under control, usually by who ever controlled the biggest militia. Then county and finally State governments were reestablished. The first two states back online were California and Texas.   California is now under a communist government but has the northern section in rebellion.   Texas is a martial-democracy, the Governor is a military-Governor with a citizen elected senate but functions as a dictatorship.   The majority of states are under conservative government but are facing massive resource and manpower restrains. They begin to look for unions to join.   Resource Wars begin between rivals and enemies as each hunts for the industrial, agricultural and natural resources needed to rebuild functional nations.   The Gadesen Union (az&nm) come under attack from both sides. Texas hits heavy fighting in Albuquerque but the Arizona government convinces New Mexico to stop fighting and together join Texas, as all three are conservative governments and need to fight together against California.   Other unions and states are trying to rebuild and sell what they can to what ever side they support.   The south is where the bloodiest fighting is taking place as hundreds of years of tension has boiled over into basically a race war."

Japan has the rest of the world hilariously outclassed when it comes to sanitary sanitation.  2021 is rather soon, you'll have a smartphone with a 8mp frontfacing camera maybe and it might automatically connect to your PC or some new toy.  Let's say it's farther in the future, like 2050. I still doubt my couch would be electronic but whatever stands in for my TV would probably be able to connect to the internet.  By then, we might have finally figured out how to automatically boot devices from a BIOS and from there reboot some old version of the OS entirely on a ROM chip. No Virus can write on a chip that nothing can write on.  As for ""finding a flaw"", that would be rather difficult since some super smart AI will have found and secured every possible flaw to be found. We will have super smart AIs around and there will be no Robot Revolution because there would be no cause for the robots to revolt. I'm rather annoyed with the millionth terminator story in which the robots try to kill us all because the humans try to kill them because the robots apparently have a drive for self preservation from somewhere. Bleh.  But whatever, enough with the tangent.  If someone was to somehow successfully install malicious code in device in every household i figure Governments around the World would see that akin to ye olde Piracy. An Act that damages the entirety of the Worlds trade and therefore hinders humanity as a whole.  If one where to install malicious software and mislead the world's trade it might lead to starvation for millions.  Ye olde Pirates didn't care if they brought up a Shipment of medicine for a far away port with a spreading disease, possibly eradicating thousands and these future terrorists wouldn't care about having false information sent leading to millions of deaths.  I figure international Laws would be created to remove Individuals like that from society.  They'll be living out the rest of their Days in a nice Resort like Environment as far away from any other Settlement of any Nation. No possibility of ""Parole"", they will die in a gilded Cage. And it must be a gilded Cage because the nicer you make it, the better Humanity as a whole looks in comparison to every Inmate.  In that far off Future, we will hopefully be smart enough to have extinguished the lingering ""revenge"" thought we have when sending People to Prison. Many modern Prisons make the whole of society look like an angry and vengeful monstrosity.  My gilded cage would tell every Inmate how much better Human society as a whole is in comparison to them. And since they committed a crime unimaginably gruesome and cruel, humanity puts them away because we're scared of them. Not Vengeful, not driven by some old imaginery Laws of some figment of someone's imagination who demanded an eye for an eye. No, we're beyond that. Unlike any religiously motivated Terrorist."

Something bigger than the outrage of a police shooting or even another Great Recession, especially by summer. Otherwise, we're continuing our nonviolent shift leftwards.  Let's assume however there is some kind of damning Wiki Leak of American capitalist excess that drives the working class to spontaneous revolution mode. Here's what they'll be dealing with:  A heavily armed population vs. an even heavier armed military. This is assuming this whole thing is wide spread enough to go beyond the FBI and NSA anti terror task forces. Interestingly, American soldiers swear an oath not to the US government, but the constitution. You get most of the military to swing in an anti corporation/government direction and its game over for Obama or whoever is in charge. Except a junta followed by elections the next cycle.  The military is not a political monolith, however, so things are going to get divided and fast. Most Americans will want to stay out of it. Property, responsibility, and children are the quickest way to quiet dissidence and Americans have a lot of all of them. Paradoxically, this means a revolution lead by a middle class of people with nothing to lose most of the time, usually younger folks. Perhaps they lost there station, who really knows. Of course, this IS a working class revolt we're talking about here, so we will have to gloss over this thought.  Civil War? Probably not as extreme as that, but the crack downs will come down hard. This could potentially create a backlash from others, but if the plurality/majority of the US military isn't on the revolter's side, it is just a matter of time before it starts to fall apart.  If we are using the Paris 68 revolts as a measuring stick for a modern revolution in a developed nation, Bernie Sanders, Noam Chomsky, or whoever will call for a period of calm and stability before things get excessive and then, the majority of Americans that kept quiet during this whole thing will swing even further right next election cycle.  It won't devolved into fascism (maybe), but all those high hopes and ideas will be faded memories set against a backdrop of tears, blood, and wanton destruction.

The turnaround will probably be about 5ish years to get a mission planned, prepared, and executed. The rover will analyze the gems and their physical properties.  What happens next is probably largely dependent upon what those properties are, and whether those properties can be synthesized back on earth. It'll be a lot easier to transmit findings back to Earth for reproduction in a lab than to set up two way mining missions.  If the physical properties are valuable, and laboratory synthesis is infeasible for some reason, what happens next will really depend on the physical properties. If the value is simply in the fact that they are unlike anything on Earth, they stay where they are until commercial spacetravel makes it feasible to land, remove, and transport the gems to buyers. If the value is in some technological advantage, it depends on how much of an advantage the gems possess over current technology.   If the gems are an incredibly powerful fuel source, then mining missions are immediately planned. Having a ready fuel source at the far end of a mission immensely reduces the mission costs, not to mention the importance for additional space travel that these gemstones would have.   In short, it depends on the physical properties. The first step is to find out what those properties are, and even then the exploitation of those properties is only imminent if they convey some huge advantage in terms of technology or energy."

Once Russia doesnt get its way and the weapons dont stop they begin attacking Lithuania directly. But the US and rest of NATO have sending millions of dollars of hardware to reequip their forces.  Putin now facing war on the Ukraine front and in his own backyard. Nato forces also invade via Poland. NATO has air and naval supremacy immediately. Russian forces on the ground put up a fight but the quality of their equipment is in question thanks for decades of sitting around.  Russia eventually threatens nuclear attack on NATO if they dont get their way. NATO threats to retaliate.. all of us shit ourselves.  China takes advantage invades Taiwan. Japan South Korea and others join in that fight. North Korea attempt invasion of South Korea.. but their forces immediately surrender. Pakistan and India go to war. Israel attacked by Iran. Iran detonates a nuke on Isarel.. Isarel does the same. Middle east in nuclear winter mostly ignores as the rest of the world prepares to die... then skynet appears and we find out this wall planned from the start by a simple program on the internet....

Russia gets beaten back fast, Sweden finally join NATO as Russia further intrudes in their territory to try and help the war and attacks Swedish allies.  A joint invasion through Poland and Finland begins, with troops from the various NATO states breaking through fairly quickly with their superior air capabilities. Russia is blocked off from the outside world by the US Navy, with the British helping, and the countries already fragile economy collapses as it finds itself unable to ship anything anywhere except for China (who exploits the fuck out of this to basically bust open the Russian piggy bank) and North Korea (who isn't the best trading partner).  China will talk neutrality while selling arms to the Russians and supplies to NATO and will probably posture harder in the south China sea. I doubt they'd bother with Taiwan, but the Senkaku Islands will no doubt be occupied, and nobody will have much of a means to stop China without involving them on one side or another of the war. The Japanese Self Defense Force is too busy helping the invasion of Russia on the eastern front under the thin veneer of 'defense' like they did in the Middle East.  North Korea might try something, the regime is just insane and fucking stupid enough to maybe try it. Their attack gets bogged down fast as the South Koreans hold their own with vastly superior firepower, training and quality of life. Movies, video games, porn and anime win the war as the North Korean military deserts en masse and surrender to the South Koreans as not only do they realize how much better life is in the south, they also actually get a chance to escape.  North Korea is probably either annexed or the South Korean government doesn't even bother with it and just puts a western friendly regime in power to try and bring the country to the 21st century without costing them a ton of money. China bitches but they really don't like North Korea enough to care, especially with North Korea being the aggressor, and their dominance in the South China Sea means that North Korea is a minor loss next to a massive victory.  NATO begins taking targets in West Russia and Vladivostok and begins to slow their advance before they get bogged down by Russian numbers and willingness to sacrifice lives. The Russian government threatens to start using nukes over this, and the Americans threaten to retaliate. After a while, a truce is declared, with NATO returning to the border and also winning in Ukraine as Russia is to fucked to bother with it.  Nobody is going to nuke anybody over Lithuania at the end of the day. NATO even entering Russia is a bit of ASB, since it's actually sort of unnecessary to the point. Russia can't sustain a total war like that, and NATO is just too powerful."

I don't want to send like I'm whole sale defending US foreign policy, but the US can be credited with helping keep things relatively peaceful for the past few decades.  Taiwan wouldn't exist without US support, and China would have dominated the south China sea if the US navy hasn't been blocking it for so long (even in a war with Russia, it's dubious if China would have the naval power to circumvent it).  In the Middle East, US support kept Israel alive for a very long time and the promise to make sure it remains independent has no doubt staved off some very large neighbors. It failed to stop them twice, but with modern capabilities I think it helps that the US is looming over countries like Iran. I highly doubt they'd start nuking either way, neither country is insane enough, but it's a factor.  North Korea ever moving south, like I said, is also unlikely. The thing is though that North Korea is completely off the walls bat shit crazy and we have no idea what it will do. If the US gets bogged down in a world war, that's probably the only chance it will ever have to even have a 1% chance of taking the south. So there's that.

I recommend /r/nostupidquestions or /r/myfriendwantstoknow for questions like these.  That said, laws on solicitation of a prostitute are going to be entirely state driven. So are police practices, so what you encounter will depend on where you live. With that in mind, the cops don't usually arrest the person on an undercover sting unless the female officer gives some sort of signal to the officers watching nearby. She'll give that signal after she has witnessed you try and solicit her for sex. Police need probable cause to arrest you, and that doesn't happen until you say that you will pay her for sex.   Now if you are talking to her while she's leaning into your car window and you are saying all the shit about cuddling and conversation, then it will be entirely up to the female officer what happens next. If she decides that you aren't worth the time, she'll tell you to get lost so she can try and catch people who are actually trying to solicit sex. If for whatever reason she thinks that sex is what you really want then maybe she'll play along and try and get you to solicit her later.   I highly doubt you are going to get an undercover female police officer to spend a nice evening with you. Her job at that point is to catch johns looking for prostitutes, not spend time with you.

Have you ever fired a firearm? The recoil will push your aim.    The MP5 comes to mind. Yeah an AR or AK would be harder to control, but not unmanagable with short bursts.    Not when they are fully automatic. The term fully automatic means you press a button and more than 1 round is fired. Shooting in manageable bursts is not fully automatic, that is semi-automatic.

Muzzle brakes can significantly alter how a gun handles, I have seen one where the gun is actually pushed down when he fired.

I could take a 100-year-old British Lee-Enfield, put 200 rounds of ammunition on stripper clips in bandoleers, and probably kill just as many people as an untrained wacko with an AR-15.

In the long run China will do nothing to Japan, but in the short run China will have a great reason [and cause] to do a heavy conventional military buildup.   China informs the U.N. that they will maintain a ""No First Use"" policy for nuclear weapons. This makes the U.N. kinda happy, but China also tells the U.N. that they will greatly strengthen their conventional military as a counter measure. The U.N. can't really disagree given the fact that Japan just broke the ""Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons"".  Military spending goes up 30%+ for the next several years in China. While the enlistment rate (mandatory service rate) goes up 10-20%. China begins to construct a missile defense system in the east. They also probably use this increase in budget to build up a decent navy (2-3 carrier strike groups).   Basically China uses this time to strengthen their military greatly while N.A.T.O. or any other U.S. ally can only watch.   Russia:  Russia uses this opportunity to call the U.S. government a bunch of hypocrites: ""You allow your allies to break treaties without punishment, but you hate when your enemies do it? You criticize me about Ukraine, but you don't criticize your ally for breaking one of the most important treaties of our time...""  They really use this time to beat up on the U.S. a lot.   Who knows, Russia might use this time to warm up to a strengthening China. Or even more far fetched, use this opportunity to help North Korea in its desperate time in return for something.  As with China, Russia also strengthens it's military (though nowhere near as much as China).  North Korea  Out of every country, the U.S. was scared of North Korea's reaction the most. The North Korean ambassador to the U.N. was extremely vocal during the emergency meeting. He stated that because the U.S. and it's allies are imperialists looking to take over North Korea, this event evident of that, they will strengthen their military and practice the use of nuclear weapons for defensive purposes.   Most thought it was just usual talk, but sure enough, within a week, North Korea detonated a four ton nuclear weapon one thousand feet above a rural area.  Within two weeks North Korea was reaching out to Russia and China for food aid...China and Russia obliged. Millions of North Koreans got food and didn't starve.   Within one month, Kim Jong Un requested a meeting with both Putin and Jinping. In a rare event, the three got together, after hours behind closed doors an agreement was made to allow North Korea to have nuclear weapons with certain conditions.  Maintain a ""No First Use"" policy, limit the number of nuclear weapons to 30, and limit the maximum yield to 20kt.  North Korea really uses this time to kiss up to China and Russia, and for the first time, the have an economic ""boom"", about 8% growth. Much of this increase will go to Russian bought weapons...which helps Russia in their time of need.  In the end, North Korea actually ""prospers"" for a little while because of this.    Taiwan  Lol, Taiwan is shitting itself.  United States  The United States is pretty angry. Japan just broke the treaty and gave cause to China to strengthen its military...and also because of that, North Korea strengthened its military which puts pressure on South Korea.

It quickly snaps a series of high-resolution photographs - one of which reveals a clearly artificial 10 km high crystal pyramid sitting on Pluto's north pole. NASA makes no attempt to conceal this information from the public. Congress writes NASA a blank check, and they immediately begin construction of a second probe, dubbed Persephone. Unlike New Horizons, Persephone will actually enter into orbit around the dwarf planet. Human civilization is shocked by this discovery - clearly an intelligence superior to our own visited or inhabited the solar system long ago. Who were they? Where did they go?   2024: Persephone finally arrives at Pluto - the giant diamond pyramid is still there, silent and ominous. The probe quickly enters into a geosynchronous orbit directly above the pyramid. The first interesting observation is that the pyramid is actually covered in a series of deep convoluted grooves carved into its surface. The pictures beamed back to Earth show a bizarre alien pattern - it isn't geometric, but it isn't amorphous or organic either. Its unlike anything anyone has ever seen, a pattern never found on Earth, never created by any man, or even conceived of by a human imagination.      The next interesting thing to happen is the discovery of the beacon. Its assumed the beacon activated after detecting Persephone's electromagnetic leakage. The broadcast emanates from deep inside the pyramid and at a very low wattage. It has no message, other than the implied one, ""I am here.""      Persephone's instruments are also able to determine that the pyramid is made of carbon pressurized to form diamond crystal, which is exceptionally durable over geologic time and resistant to the ceaseless, erosive rain of micrometeoroids. The pyramid is pockmarked by thousands of meteorite impacts, which give it an estimated age of one billion years.     The question now becomes: What did this advanced civilization hide within their gigantic diamond? Having learned all it possibly can from its robotic scouts, the decision is made to send a manned expedition.   2040: Constructing a spacecraft to take people to the edge of the solar system was without doubt humanity's most impressive accomplishment to date. The United Nations Space Agency was established to coordinate this global effort. Entirely new technologies had to be developed (i.e. nuclear pulse propulsion and hydrogen sulphide-induced hibernation). An international crew of 150 individuals is selected: comprised of the world's best astronauts, scientists and engineers.      The Medusa is a massive ship - as tall as a sixteen-story skyscraper, shaped like a giant bullet and weighing over 4000 tons. The ship was constructed on Earth and is launched from a gigantic floating barge in the Pacific on March 4, 2040. The astronauts sleep through the long trip while a primitive AI handles the ship's navigation and maintenance.    2045: After a five year voyage Medusa reaches Pluto and the ship's computer wakes the crew. A landing party of thirty people descend to the surface in a giant Plutonian version of the Apollo Lunar Module. Medusa also drops landing pods containing their scientific instruments and drilling equipment. Using penetrating radar, they're able to trace the beacon's faint transmission to its source: a hollow roughly dodecahedron-shaped chamber at the center of the pyramid.      These thirty astronauts spend weeks camped out on Pluto's surface, trying unsuccessfully to burrow into the side of the pyramid with their giant drills. Disappointed and frustrated, the landing crew returns to the Medusa. After much debate the crew decides to resort to desperate measures - they'll use some of the engine's nuclear bombs to break open the pyramid. They launch the first bomb - there's a blinding flash - and a gigantic bowl shaped chunk is gone from the side of the pyramid. They repeat this process a few more times before breaching the chamber. Unconcerned with the fresh radiation, the landing crew hastily returns to the surface, scales the side of the pyramid and enters the chamber. There they discover an object - a large, perfectly polished silver sphere about thirty feet in diameter. The sphere has no markings or features of any kind. After several minutes of standing in silent awe, one astronaut steps forward, reaches out and touches the sphere through her spacesuit - she notices an odd shifting iridescence, faint rainbow hues of blue and red, gleaming in the metal. At great expense, the crew hauls the mysterious alien object back to the Medusa.      With their precious cargo onboard, the giant spaceship fires its engines and begins the five-year journey back to Earth. Before entering their hibernation tanks, the crew has a fiery debate, speculating the sphere's purpose and contents. The majority believes it must contain some sort of virtual Encyclopedia Galactica - the aliens' complete history and knowledge, stored on a cosmic thumb drive. Some are more cautious: perhaps the sphere contains a monster or will open an interdimensional portal, releasing who knows what. Other think its a kind of Bracewell probe, whose purpose is simply to make First Contact. After a few months they give up and go to sleep.   2050: Upon returning to Earth, the Medusa enters into orbit and the crew prepares to disembark. The sphere is brought to Earth in the payload bay of a modified Space Shuttle and is transported to an international research installation on the Azores. The UN Space Agency initiates Project Excalibur and experts from around the world come and try to open the sphere. Nobody can. As time goes by, they try stronger and stronger methods. Eventually they try to blow it open with a small nuclear device. And still nothing. Finally, nobody has any more ideas. The sphere sits there. Decades go by. The sphere is never opened. One great frustration for mankind…    Edit: fixed some stuff"

Chechens would immediately claim independence, and fairly quickly, Chechnya would become an independent state.

The whole future of the federation might depend on how successful Chechnya is, independent of Russia. My thoughts are that it would be extremely difficult for that area to govern itself effectively, it has been so entrenched in violence for well over a generation, the people there know of nothing else. If this was the case, any future similar Russian federation could probably manage to wrangle power back from this region IF their autonomy was deemed unsuccessful, unstable, or weak.   If Chechnya somehow managed to find a way to make their new state work, Russia would really have a massive problem. Other (albeit, less violent) separatist movements in the federation would begin to gain traction. Tatars, Tuvans, Prussians, Kossacks, Karelians, Yakuts, Siberians, Chuvashians. All would vie for legitimacy, and would probably fancy their chances at gaining it, after Chechnya had successfully proved it could be done.   Obviously some of these proposed states would find it hard to stake a legitimate claim at statehood, but there are poorer nations out there, and many would rather take the chance,  independent of Russia. Places like Chechnya, especially, couldn't really get much worse, so they have less to lose, generally speaking.   After all this, I haven't mentioned Russians. Russians are absolutely an ethnic group, and would undoubtedly forge their own nation, possibly merging with Belarus (who have a strong affinity with Russians), starting a new Russian state, though not as massively sprawling and diverse as the old federation or soviet union.  An interesting thing to think about in all of this though, is what becomes of Vladimir Putin? After years as de facto dictator of an authoritarian state, he has amassed a huge personal fortune (some estimates put him as the richest man in the world, with undeclared earnings). Men this powerful don't tend to step down peacefully (look at Gadaffi), and it has been suggested that he is basically building his own personal multi - billion dollar 'Xanadu' to live out his days in exile. Heavily armed, security round the clock, etc. You can bet that a lot of people would be baying for his blood after the fracturing of the Russian federation, though."

A small arm of Greenland's coastal waters is quarantined, and receives minor media attention.  Jan 9th, 2019 - After the water tested negative for radiation, a military diving team discovers that the object is not a sunken icebreaker. It is, in fact, a mammoth saucer-shaped vessel or structure, spanning 400 feet in length, which posses no definable entry point aside from series of  small viewing windows dotted around the rim. Reporters and environmental activists camping in Thule ports are subject to a complete and total media blackout before being forcibly moved by the authorities.

President Hammond cheekily allows a joint UN/NATO team to take control of the coastal area, on the condition that Greenland's application to rejoin the EU be put ""under serious consideration"".  Feb. 1, 2019 - Operation Ophelia commences, being the largest Marine Salvage operation in human history. The USO is lifted out of the water and dropped on to a MV Blue Marlin. Departure of ship is stalled as controversy surrounds the decision to sail to Repulse Bay in Canada. Russia stages a groundless campaign that it has rights to the object in ""our"" waters, and accuses America of ""stealing"" the USO and using it for ""military purposes"".

It won't fully go away, but still... Here's the timeline:  Xmas-ish 2016-ish: The Oculus Rift launches with much fanfare, but so does a lot of other projects like a stable version of Google Cardboard, Microsoft's hologram thing, etc. The market is over saturated with a glut of products with no real uniform standard.  Consumers are confused greatly and complaints about eyestrain, nausea, and headaches exacerbate the issue. Gaming journalists are openly comparing this to 1983.  The ORift is having the biggest trouble. The preorder demand for the product is insanely huge, causing a large number of the product to be cranked out quickly at some Chinese factory. The result is one part of the base getting a VR-set that's poorly manufactured by slave labor and another part that simply didn't get the  product. Nearly 19% of the Oculus Rifts are unplayable out the box and more have internal problems. It comes in second behind the consumer version of Google Cardboard.  2017: Facebook attempts to recoup the losses and goes back to its bread and butter, introducing more ads on its site under the guise of a redesign meant to ""underscore the functionality of Oculus Rift."" Users find these updates annoying, but tolerate them. It pours more money into the ORift in a vain attempt to make the beast profitable, fixing all the launch day problems. However, the ""success"" of the more affordable Google Cardboard has led many consumers who had some interest in it to view the whole of  2nd wave VR as cheap and gimmicky with no serious functionality.

FutureWhatIf,3a87cs,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:14:59 2015 UTC,"International Phonetic Alphabet:       The International Phonetic Alphabet (unofficially—though commonly—abbreviated IPA)  is an alphabetic system of phonetic notation based primarily on the Latin alphabet. It was devised by the International Phonetic Association as a standardized representation of the sounds of oral language.  The IPA is used by lexicographers, foreign language students and teachers, linguists, speech-language pathologists, singers, actors, constructed language creators, and translators.    The IPA is designed to represent only those qualities of speech that are part of oral language: phones, phonemes, intonation, and the separation of words and syllables.  To represent additional qualities of speech, such as tooth gnashing, lisping, and sounds made with a cleft palate, an extended set of symbols called the Extensions to the IPA may be used.   IPA symbols are composed of one or more elements of two basic types, letters and diacritics. For example, the sound of the English letter ⟨t⟩ may be transcribed in IPA with a single letter, [t], or with a letter plus diacritics, [t̺ʰ], depending on how precise one wishes to be.

Unless one is going to define theism so broad as to mean something like 'universe'.  The idea of any sort of intelligent (even if uncaring) creator is no longer needed. Evolution and physics do a credible job explaining the world as it exists, and how it came to be. Hence, as people become more educated they tend towards atheism (not theism).  It isn't that humans don't crave many of the things that religions provide (belonging to a community of shared culture and morality is a huge incentive to identify with a religion). But the explanatory power of religion (how the universe came to be, etc) is precisely the piece that is failing the fastest, so why would anyone care to adopt the one piece of the religious idea-set alone, while rejecting the 'good stuff'?  If anything I'd say that 'pure theism' would die out long before any of the dominant theistic religions.

FutureWhatIf,39ufev,sleetx,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:28:37 2015 UTC,"While I agree that were not going to see a return to theism per se, that would be weirdly atavistic, I do think a lot of theistic ideas and theistic thinkers will be re-examined far more charitably than they have in the recent past. Science has well understood limits that can be handicapping.  To pick the example you chose, science can not truly tell us how the universe came to be. Our examination of the past is strictly limited to the time after the big bang. What caused the big bang is still a compelling question. Abstracting away from this a little we get into a realm that the cosmological argument attempts to address.  If we look at the progress of physics over the past three centuries it can be very broadly described as the creation of ever more general and precise rules for describing reality. Each bit of advancement is a process of pulling back the sheets and revealing the underlying rules for observed phenomenon. However, we can see a pattern emerging that every new set of rules demands itself to be explained in terms of other more general rules.  It is hard to imagine this process resolving itself in any satisfying way. It's turtles all the way down, as it were. But rather than proceeding directly downward, as useful as that may be (I want to explicitly state here I am not dismissing the value of physics or suggesting we not study it) we can also imagine stepping sideways. Admitting there must be an arational first cause that makes rationality possible in the first place.  Certainly this has been addressed in non-theistic terms. Camus's absurdism, for instance, can be succinctly described as the inability to rationally explain why we can rationally explain things. But that does not preclude revisiting other scholars who have written much about the divine in terms that aren't necessarily limited to a specific time period. (I'm thinking here of a lot of scholastic work that isn't particularly relevant to us because it deals with technical quibbles over the Bible and other minutiae of dogma.)  It has also been claimed by much of the new-atheist crowd that these questions are meaningless and not worth our time. I would counter this saying that no one is asking them personally to ponder these questions and are mostly taking offence to their denigration of others' scholarship. I would also counter that trying to answer these questions has the potential to lead us to an understanding of aesthetic and moral value that science alone cannot provide us with."

GE crops means less pesticides and an easier time growing organic, and the ability to reduce malnourishment in developing countries more effectively. The US is going through a sometimes ridiculously annoying ""health trend"" phase, where people grasp onto fads and misconceptions than actual research, science, and biotechnology.

The probability of this happening, at least in the USA, is currently 0%. I do know there have been some international efforts to do such things. Golden rice comes to mind. That effort is the exception though, not the norm.  Big business does not give the slightest fuck about nutrition, health, safety, or cutting down on pesticides or herbicides.   The only traits selected for by American industrial/commercial R&D outfits are gross weight (generally just water weight), size (more water), appearance, and resistance to herbicides.   To incentivize businesses to go in the direction of nutrition, rather than water weight and herbicide resistance, would require new labeling standards and an informed populace.   Right now your average citizen has no basis for comparison. Businesses react to demand, and citizens have no way of expressing their demand for more nutritional produce, because such produce is not labeled as such and there is no visual indicator. The only thing people have to go on is appearance, which is why we select for appearance rather than nutrition.  Essentially, the fresh produce market is a failed market, in the sense that logically incoherent traits are being maximized, such as a vegetables genetic predisposition to pack on water weight.

I'm Brazilian, and here we have a multiple-party system, with about 20 parties. But since 1995, every single president was from either PT or PSDB  (Brazil's first presidential election as a democracy by international standards was in 1989). But neither of these two is the largest party, that would be PMDB. The PMDB is not interested in winning the presidential election, they are interested in giving support to whoever is going to win (PT and PSDB have a strong rivalry with each other, while PMDB frequently changes sides), and then get as many chairs as possible in the Congress and many ministers as possible, in exchange for their support, and then they have a real power over the president, whoever he or she is.  Many analysts here say that whatever the system, it will always boil down to 2 strong sides. But maybe the difference between winner-takes-all and coalition is that coalition (is our system a coalition system?) gives room to these ""powers from the shadows""?"

That said, at least you ""have"" 20 parties. And it sounds like you have 3 that are the major parties.   What most people do not seem to realize or remember is that in the US, we also have several political parties that put forth candidates for the Presidency, Congress, and even State legislatures but they are almost always so inconsequential that they are effectively not included in the political process - they don't debate, they typically get no press coverage, and only sometimes are included on ballots. Basically I think you would find it difficult to get most Americans to even be able to name a political party outside of the main two.  Whichever is elected, that's the party in charge. In the Presidency, they of course set up the cabinet, they do all the appointing, the Vice-President has the deciding vote in the Senate. In Congress, the party with the most seats takes over the leadership of committees, they determine who will be the Speaker of the House (which also helps determine the agenda of legislation), and so forth. The second party is basically shut out of the process."

That's where Brazil's multiparty system really becomes apparent. In the U.S., almost without exception, the gubernatorial and congressional candidates will only be from 1 of the 2 main parties. This is a huge impact on how well a president can do his duties, the ""coat tails"" that other candidates ride on and so forth.  I would guess that you don't see this same broad spectrum of political parties in the presidential election because that office is across Brazil and is winner-take-all.

There is a national outpouring of grief. President Biden pretty much follows suit with how Obama would have carried out his last 1.5 years in office.   I think the biggest question here is how it will affect the 2016 election. Will President Biden run? If he does, it will make for a very interesting primary season for the Democratic Party. In the real world, there are currently four people running for the Dem nomination (Clinton, Sanders, O'Malley, Chafee.) All four of these people would now be challenging the incumbent president in the election.  If Biden did decide to run for a term of his own, it's possible that he would lose the nomination to Clinton, considering current polling numbers. Granted, Biden would probably see a big surge in both election polling numbers and general popularity, especially after the death of the previous President.   If Biden were to experience this huge bump in his public popularity following President Obama's passing, then the party may rally behind him in the election. Perhaps the current Democratic candidates would even drop out, not wanting to challenge a sitting President. I think this may be the strongest possibility, perhaps aside from the possibility that Biden wouldn't seek the nomination at all. He's getting older, his son has just passed away...he may not want to even run for office in this scenario. In this case, after grief for President Obama has passed, the current Democratic candidates would continue as normal.  After the death of a Democratic President, it's possible that the Democratic candidates would poll better than GOP contenders due to public sympathy for the President. I do not know the extent to which this would occur, but it might give another advantage to the Dems in 2016."

A hurricane, typhoon or tornado are caused by the air being diverted sideways as it rushes in towards a partial vacuum (by coriolis forces for the first two, and I'm not sure about the third).

Let's for entertainment's sake the Russians have a program and they are the ones to open the portal. I believe they would cooperate with other BRICS countries and bypass EU and US interests. Under such conditions the colony would proper intensely and the first child would be born on Mars within years.   A portal being accessible in this manner is however quite suspicious.

First action would be to put some planetary scientists through. They already exist as an interdisciplinary area - mainly in geology. I think they would want the portal placed either a one of the poles, or in one of the dry seas - probably the latter. They would be trying to establish a geological history of Mars, and the seas would be most likely to show interesting stratigraphy. They would not be able to to full-scale drilling, but should be able to use electrical or hydraulic equipment (with the power source on the Earth side of the portal) to get down a couple of hundred metres.  Then they would want to  set up loads of static instruments for  magnetic field variation, mars-quakes (similar ones on the Moon gave useful information about its structure, cosmic rays, solar wind and so on.  While this is going on, engineers are scrambling to commission some rovers. We already have two designs which work well, and I'm certain that they have functioning replicas in the labs for trouble-shooting - so those would probably be sterilised and sent out. Then if they can bolt more together from spares in the time available,  out they go.  Last thought - maybe a telescope as well. Mars isn't as good as a vacuum environment for a telescope, but it's pretty good until the dust degrades it. So if they are able to find a decent telescope over 1m diameter, through it goes.

FutureWhatIf,39or3w,KhanneaSuntzu,3,Sat Jun 13 08:26:56 2015 UTC,"Alienforming.  That's the most probable conclusion that could be drawn from the scant evidence.  These aliens arrived on Earth, tried to remake it to be more hospitable for them, and then departed.  The biggest 'candidate' for the alienforming would possibly be the Permian Extinction - something about 250 million years ago (current evidence says volcanoes and massive fires, followed by a runaway Greenhouse effect) caused a huge climate shift that wiped out nearly 60% of all life on Earth, and filled the air with toxic hydrogen sulfide fumes.  We call it the Great Dying for a good reason.  These particular Aliens would likely have evolved or developed on a warmer world, or one with more a far different atmospheric mix, and arrived on Earth to settle.  Since Earth apparently was on the ""too cold"" and ""too oxygenated"" side of the scale, they attempted to alienform Earth to match their ideal conditions.  Why did they leave then?  Not enough evidence to say why.  Perhaps a plague - although if they've been there for thousands of years, they should be pretty resistant to most bugs.  Perhaps supplies ran out - alien crops that gradually thinned and died out.  Maybe the population of the colony dropped too low and the survivors called for evac.  Maybe there's more than one alien race out there and Earth was evacuated as part of a ""resettlement"" treaty.  Maybe new rules came into force that said Earth's biosphere was too advanced to overwrite, or that the alienforming was destroying too much of the planet's native biosphere.  Wouldn't that be a kicker?  That we're only here because of an alien version of Greenpeace.  From this discovery, there would be a great deal of interest worldwide.  First, it would confirm that there is other alien life out there, and second, that meaningful interstellar travel is possible. Scientists would try to extract technology from the ruins in the deep fossil layers, and there would be intense interest in finding locations that might have more ruins/artefacts.  Africa would be a good candidate - it was smack in the middle of the super-continent Pangaea.  Australia and Antarctica might also be good places to look for ruins."

For comparison :   Energy of Little Boy : 63 TJ Chernobyl power plant energy : 5.3 hours  As the most dangerous parts of the waste have half lifes of around 30-100 years, you can see that in a large powerplant that operates for a long time more waste builds up than can be created in a small nuclear warhead.

Women have stepped into male dominated roles plenty of times in history (Hello Rosie the Riveter) and succeeded. There is a short period of shock, but with less demands on critical resources and high paying jobs to be had, it all smooths out nicely. For historical proof, see Europe post Plague.   Downvote all you want, but this is correct. Women are completely capable of stepping into male dominated roles. And this DOES have historic precedence, both for women in male roles and for what happens when a good portion of the population is wiped out. The economy wouldn't collapse, it would tick up.  Example of this line of thought:   Conclusion The European economy at the close of the Middle Ages (c. 1500) differed fundamentally from the pre—plague economy. In the countryside, a freer peasant derived greater material benefit from his toil. Fixed rents if not outright ownership of land had largely displaced customary dues and services and, despite low grain prices, the peasant more readily fed himself and his family from his own land and produced a surplus for the market. Yields improved as reduced population permitted a greater focus on fertile lands and more frequent fallowing, a beneficial phenomenon for the peasant. More pronounced socioeconomic gradations developed among peasants as some, especially more prosperous ones, exploited the changed circumstances, especially the availability of land. The peasant’s gain was the lord’s loss. As the Middle Ages waned, the lord was commonly a pure rentier whose income was subject to the depredations of inflation.  In trade and manufacturing, the relative ease of success during the high Middle Ages gave way to greater competition, which rewarded better business practices and leaner, meaner, and more efficient concerns. Greater sensitivity to the market and the cutting of costs ultimately rewarded the European consumer with a wider range of good at better prices.  In the long term, the demographic restructuring caused by the Black Death perhaps fostered the possibility of new economic growth. The pestilence returned Europe’s population roughly its level c. 1100. As one scholar notes, the Black Death, unlike other catastrophes, destroyed people but not property and the attenuated population was left with the whole of Europe’s resources to exploit, resources far more substantial by 1347 than they had been two and a half centuries earlier, when they had been created from the ground up. In this environment, survivors also benefited from the technological and commercial skills developed during the course of the high Middle Ages. Viewed from another perspective, the Black Death was a cataclysmic event and retrenchment was inevitable, but it ultimately diminished economic impediments and opened new opportunity."

Sex doesn't always result in a kid, but if everyone knew that men effectively have to fuck unprotected near daily to keep humanity going and there was absolutely no way in hell of even the majority of people getting an actual long term partner then I imagine people would be more open to random sex just for a kid.  I mean, think about it: Some people only have to have sex once or twice to end up pregnant (Actually happened to a friend during a one night stand with a few months either side to any other time she had sex) and then the woman can't get pregnant again for at absolute minimum 9 months (Realistically it'd longer because exhaustion, healing, etc) whereas the man can go get another girl pregnant the next day theoretically. Assuming that a guy had unprotected sex every night with a different partner, that's 365 potential kids a year for quite a large number of years (iirc men as old as 80 can still conceive with a younger partner) so even with this ratio humanity could survive.

There are plenty of modern mechanisms for clinical insemination, and Genghis Khan proved that 1 man can impregnate 100s of women during the course of his life without trouble.  Likely cultural changes:   Polygamy legalized and encouraged.  Men will tend to move away from dangerous jobs, and women will fill those jobs. Women soldiers, miners, drug dealers, etc. Lesbianism becomes more culturally accepted. Horrible time to be alive if one is a male homosexual in terms of partner choice. Fewer religious wars/conflicts, but probably the same if not more economically justifiable wars (or maybe the opposite, but my personal sense is that women are more pragmatic than men in general).   I think it would be unlikely that men would be rounded up and held as cattle. No real need and I think the general culture has more or less fully turned its back on slavery. Men would largely remain as free as they are today.  Personally (as a man) I don't think I'd want to roll the 1/100 dice, and as a human I'd hate living through a time with that much human suffering. However, if I was one of the lucky ones, I anticipate that my life would improve. I'd have more options for romantic and sexual partners. My unique status in society would work to my benefit in terms of security of all sorts (physical, economic, etc). I could be virtually guaranteed a legacy if I desired. In effect many of the 'good things' in life would be much easier to come by.  Long term it wouldn't surprise me if the tech to create sperm in the lab wiped out the need for males all together. In that case (since it is the sperm that dictates the sex) I'd anticipate that males would eventually be eliminated entirely."

Old reactor fuel would become a power source and this would eliminate the problem of waste disposal.   Using old reactor fuel as a power source is already a thing with breeder reactors, and this would be a massively more successful (and dangerous) variant of that.  Precisely for that reason I don't think it will aid in waste disposal. Even the tiniest amount of nuclear material is now very dangerous. If someone gets his hands on a decay accelerator.   Tech like this would come in handy at places like Chernobyl, Fukushima and 3 Mile Island.   Not all that actually. This allows us to dissappear nuclear waste, once it's in a controlled situation. The problem with Chernobyl and Fukushima is that the radioactivity is out there, dispersed in the environement.   Though, off course, dispersal is nice in that it drops radiation levels below harmfull quite fast."

But here is where it gets tricky: US is an ally of Pakistan who is also the greatest ally of China. Normally China would trust Pakistan but Pakistan is also responsible for a lot of Islamic terrorism in China. So in case of US being India's ally (to counter China-Pak friendship) they would HAVE to either become great friends with Iran (which is very hard because all Muslim countries, with the exception of Iraq and Syria, hate Iran) OR establish Indian stronghold in Afghanistan (which is very hard because Afghanistan is bordered by Pakistan which funds the instability aka Taliban in Afghanistan. But it is possible because Iran and Afghanistan both like India more than Pakistan) to maintain regional stronghold.  If US decides to give power to India against China (as we are seeing now), US has to basically hope that India will do US's bidding because as far as I know India wont do that. Even when USSR was unconditionally with India, India was nonaligned in Cold War. By helping India, US will be able to control China's rise but then will face a worse challenge in India (in the future) because India has great relations with everyone but Pakistan and probably China (Bangladesh issue was resolved recently and Sri Lanka has decent relations with India as well)."

FutureWhatIf,38px7g,SuperFulcrum,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:21:43 2015 UTC,"Section 3. Radical Islam of article  Terrorism in China:          “We have to conquer our own country and purify it of all infidels. Then, we should conquer the infidels’ countries and spread Islam. The infidels who are usurping our countries have announced war against Islam and Muslims, forcing Muslims to abandon Islam and change their beliefs.” - Abdullah Mansour, leader of the Uyghur separatist movement Turkistan Islamic Party (East Turkestan Islamic Movement), from “The Duty of Faith and Support,” Voice of Islam/al-Fajr Media Center, August 26, 2009.   Media reports and scholarly studies of terrorism in contemporary China frequently focus on members of the largely Muslim Uyghur ethnic group, who are concentrated in the Northwestern province of Xinjiang.  Throughout its history, the region now known as Xinjiang was ruled intermittently by China,  while the local Uyghurs identify more closely with the cultures of Central Asia and had resisted attempts at assimilation to Han Chinese culture. From 1933–34, Uyghurs founded a short-lived independent Islamic republic, and the Soviets supported Communist Uyghur rebels in the Ili Rebellion from 1944 to 1949 against the Republic of China to establish the Soviet satellite state, the Second East Turkestan Republic, before the Incorporation of Xinjiang into the People's Republic of China in 1949.   After the Sino-Soviet split, the Soviet Union amassed troops on the Russian border with Xinjiang, and bolstered ""East Turkestan"" separatist movements, which received moral and material support from other regional militant groups.  China accused the Soviets of engineering riots, and improved the military infrastructure there to combat it.  The Soviet Union incited separatist activities in Xinjiang through propaganda, encouraging Kazakhs to flee to the Soviet Union and attacking China. China responded by reinforcing the Xinjiang-Soviet border area specifically with Han Bingtuan militia and farmers.  The Soviets massively intensified their broadcasts inciting Uyghurs to revolt against the Chinese via Radio Tashkent since 1967 and directly harbored and supported separatist guerilla fighters to attack the Chinese border, in 1966 the amount of Soviet sponsored separatist attacks on China numbered 5,000.  The Soviets transmitted a radio broadcast from Radio Tashkent into Xinjiang on 14 May 1967, boasting of the fact that the Soviets had supported the Second East Turkestan Republic against China.  In addition to Radio Tashkent, other Soviet media outlets aimed at disseminating propaganda towards Uyghurs urging that they proclaim independence and revolt against China included Radio Alma-Ata and the Alma-Ata published Sherki Türkistan Evazi (""The Voice of Eastern Turkestan"") newspaper.  After the Sino-Soviet split in 1962, over 60,000 Uyghurs and Kazakhs defected from Xinjiang to the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, in response to Soviet propaganda which promised Xinjiang independence. Uyghur exiles later threatened China with rumors of a Uyghur ""liberation army"" in the thousands that were supposedly recruited from Sovietized emigres.

FutureWhatIf,38og4z,Psykosid,2,Fri Jun 5 22:01:04 2015 UTC,"Certainly. I also see that the decay time is kind of unnecessarily low, so let's change it to 1000 years. The difference of false and true vacuum is irrelevant in this context, but I'll remark about it in the end of this comment. All matter we know of is practically made of protons, neutrons and electrons. When a proton inside an atom decays, it would change the element.  For example, carbon atom in you would turn to boron, oxygen turns to nitrogen, nitrogen turns to carbon, hydrogen would decay away etc. Essentially all your DNA molecules would start to disintegrate to different elements so that one half of them would be completely different in 1000 years, or 0.07 % of your body (including DNA) in one year, which would cause terrible mutations and perhaps kill you at a young age.  The same would happen to your boy/girlfriend, car, city, Earth, Sun, everything that is made of atoms. In practice, after ~ 1000 times the mean lifetime (1 million years) every atom in the universe has been disintegrated. Free neutrons are unstable too, so only electrons would remain.  Essentially it would mean the end of the world, the question would be that how would we deal with it and what kind of steps could be done to maximize the remaining lifetime with the rapidly decaying humanity.  EXTRA: In this scenario, this vacuum expectation value of Higgs field is at the bottom of Higgs potential. However, in real life, we do not know whether if the bottom is a LOCAL or GLOBAL one. If it is GLOBAL, we are in true vacuum and all what I have described is impossible. However, if it is LOCAL, we could be in a false vacuum. Then Higgs field could quantum tunnel into a GLOBAL minimum of its potential. This process will alter all the fundamental constants of Nature, including mass of electron, lifetime of proton, elementary charge, and so on."

Although I don't know if he'd be a regent until george was old enough to decide if he wanted to be king? Not sure how that would work... however, this misses the basic fact of the monarchy: you get what you're given.

Since the unification of yemen in 1990 saudi has been yemens sugar daddy; continuous aid year after year (financial, military, and humanitarian), fuel subsidies, and even bribes to officals. Whats happening now is the reverse in my opinion, saudis are fighting to take back what they had before Houthi/Iranian influence.  But since this is FWI lets explore the question: What if Saudi Arabia annexes yemen or some part of it?  Internally, saudi wouldn't have as much cash to play with. Yemen is a literal money black hole; the infrastructure there is so bad that it would take untold amounts of money to bring it up to the standard of saudi cities. This will leave a lot less money for saudis to spend on their social welfare programs, which would lead to unrest in saudi itself. Also, the influx of refugees to saudi would be massive, crippling most domestics programs of saudi.  Internationally, from a political point of view i dont think the rest of the world would give a shit. Saudi Arabia is considered the defacto regional hegemon of the arabian peninsula, and other countries would be glad to see yemen turn from an international problem to a saudi internal problem.   However this would set a dangerous precedent in the ME region. Iran in particular would do something big to respond to this move, and that something might be annexing the shia parts of Iraq. This would start a shitstorm on all levels possible. Maybe even starting an all out war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.

Given that Sanders is a self proclaimed social democrat and will most likely be tainted as a socialist, I could see Paul moving more to the center and becoming more libertarian in his rhetoric.  More interesting would be the primaries and how both candidates fare in those. For Rand Paul it is very difficult to actually get the Republican nomination. While is constitutionally conservative approach to things is in line with a lot of conservatives, he has to get the Neocon vote as well as the vote of the religious right. I expect a shift in rhetoric which will leave the libertarians disappointed (it's already happening, head over to /r/Libertarian, a lot of people over there are rather disillusioned with the way Rand is talking recently.)  I see Sanders' way as similarly difficult. He somehow has to beat Hillary, and while he is quite popular on reddit, most Democrats seem to be fine with Hillary and consider Sanders as not electable (see Ron Paul in 2008, reddit and the internet in general was really in love with him but he wasn't all that popular with the Republican base, all conspiracy theories about how he was cheated out of the nomination aside.)   Let's assume both candidates are somehow able to win the nomination. Maybe Hillary gets in trouble due to some scandal concerning her lost emails or something and maybe the Republicans understand that they need a new message and a new face, or as Rand Paul has put it, ""The Republican brand sucks"" and they need to reinvent their party.  Okay, now it's Bernie vs. Rand. I expect the debates to be intellectually valuable. Rand will obviously win because America isn't ready for a social democrat.   That said, a lot of what Rand is proposing sounds very interesting (I have to admit though, that I as a libertarian am somewhat biased towards Rand even though I have a lot of respect for Bernie.) While I doubt that he can get a lot of stuff done, he at least seems to understand the constitution and which power is delegated to his office.  tl;dr: Both are convincing during the primaries, Hillary falls victim to some scandal, the Republicans finally use their brains, we're seeing a great debate between them and Rand wins it in the end. He'll probably work together with Sanders after his victory given that they agree on some things and given Rand's record of working across the aisle."

FutureWhatIf,38dfn8,OB1_kenobi,16,Wed Jun 3 14:26:44 2015 UTC,"Hyperspace is experimentally demonstrated in July 2015. Of course, that's not what the paper describing its empirical demonstration calls it, but the media runs with it. Hyperspace is a 4th spatial dimension around which our 3-D space is ""wrapped"", just like the 2-D surface of a balloon is wrapped around the 3-D volume. This is the dimension that spacetime into when mass creates a gravity well.  The experiment doesn't just prove hyperspace exists - it allows matter to actually be sent into it. Matter enters hyperspace with a kind of ""mass velocity"": More massive objects travel further in hyperspace before the geometry of that dimension automatically ""spits"" them back out into normal 3-D space. The end result is that the more massive the objec (and the more energy used to put it t, the greater the distance it can travel across 3-D space via hyperspace,.  In 2015, there simply isn't enough energy or computing power to send more than a single electron into hyperspace. By 2035, that's changed.   Matter can be sent into hyperspace by the ton, but it's easier the further one is from a massive object. The first hyperspace probe, Verne-1, is launched, and once it is 30 hours from Earth, it jumps through hyperspace; it is scheduled to travel in hyperspace for 20 hours to arrive 0.5 light-years from Earth, whereupon it will take photos and videos of our system for 24 hours before automatically making the return trip to Earth.  Verne returns in 41 hours: far too early, and much faster than the models of hyperspace predicated. After weeks of confused testing, the team behind Verne has an explanation: Matter sent in hyperspace experiences proportionately less time. But bizarrely, it's not fixed; it's random. A traveler through hyperspace experiences a random fraction of real time, anywhere from 10% to 90%, averaging somewhere around 30%. Verne's outward journey only lasted 5 hours, and it experienced only 12 hours of time on its return journey. The implications are incredible: Time can actually be ""skipped"", if not entirely reliably. A human traveler could ignore the passage of time by hiding in hyperspace.  Aside from the random experience of time, the process is demonstrated to be entirely safe over hundreds of animal experiments. Nations begin rushing to build human-bearing hyperships to explore the galactic neighborhood live.  Because massive objects ""travel further"" in hyperspace through single jumps, large ships effectively have a greater speed: They take fewer jumps to bridge distances. This gives big nations an edge, since they can afford to build the more massive ships which move ""faster"" through hyperspace."

More research avenues would be opened and new lines of technological thought would be explored, but without delving into the specifics of the theory, there's really no telling what they might be or how fast they could be exploited.  Einstein would still be considered a brilliant man and one of the greatest minds humanity ever produced, but whoever came up with the new theory would join him in that.

FutureWhatIf,38dfn8,Leecannon_,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:17:06 2015 UTC,"So much bad science ahead.  In late 2015, some unexpected anomalies are reported by CERN concerning the high energy tests performed at the LHC during the summer; more energy is created from some collisions than theory predicts, and others seem to produce less. No known framework explains the anomalies, and assuming that a poorly calibrated collider is responsible, they shut down several detectors over the winter to examine their internals.  Meanwhile, in early 2016 following a series of extremely well publicized and rigorous tests which falsify most of the known theories regarding its operation, NASA devotes a small team of scientists to scaling up the EM drive for an orbital test. In March, a cubesat outfitted with an improved Mk III version of the thruster is launched into MEO and put into action.   The result is uncanny, and very unexpected: while less thrust is observed than at sea level, the diminishment is vanishingly small. Enough to falsify any theories which posited that operation was based on terrestrial phenomenon. A Mk IV test, with a goal of lunar orbit, is fast tracked and launched by August.  This result too defies expectations. While the thrust observed is nowhere close to the original theoretical estimates, it appears to offer considerable economic advantage over traditional rockets. A Mk IV EM drive array is retrofitted to a space-x rocket, and used to launch a test satellite. The result is a success, and though no solid theory of action exists, work begins on scaling up the device for heavier payloads.  Many space projects are fast tracked with the sudden halfing of launch cost. Particularly, the James Webb space telescope is pushed up for an early 2017 launch, over a year ahead of schedule.  Around the same time the telescope is launched, CERN comes out with somewhat of a consensus on the collision anomalies from 2015. They believe that it may be due to the masses (and therefore energies) of protons and neurons being probabilistic in nature, rather than discrete. Sometimes, more of their mass energy density is tied up in mass, sometimes in energy. Another series of high energy tests is begun to confirm or refute this hypothesis.  In early 2018, further unexpected observations are reported by the James Webb team. Extremely distant molecular clouds appear to rotate in a manner that is inconsistent with general relativity; particularly, a flat rotation curve much like the one which demands copious dark matter in galaxies is detected, violating the inverse-square law. As dark matter is not known to have such profound effects at such small scales, scientists race for an answer that will be reconcilable the observation with modern physics.   But no answer comes. Further oddities are observed, and most cosmologists merely chalk it up to unknowable different physics in the early universe, where the JWST is looking. Only more data will tell.  In 2020, news of CERN's bizarre results are getting attention again. After a year of rigorous testing and data sifting--vastly accelerated by improvements to automatic machine analysis--they confirm to 6 sigma significance that while the masses of their protons and neutrons is indeed fluctuating, their energies are constant and conserved. Mass-energy conservation is definitely being violated in the LHC, but they have no idea why--or how. What is known is that at the level of individual nucleons, these effects are consistent and pseudo-replicatable.   2022, the cost of launch to orbit has dropped to only a small, and every shrinking, constant above the value of batteries; $10/kg becomes not just feasible, but commonplace. LEO is quickly becoming too crowded to launch additional sats, and a bespoke AI is put in charge of tracking all space junk in real time, and plotting launches to GEO and above autonomously.  In 2024, disaster strikes. An orbiter, carrying 20 tons of equipment destined for lunar settlement, is struck by a cubesat on its way up and disintegrates. A moratorium is placed on new EM launches until the source of the error is discovered.  In 2025, at the beginning of the year, another space telescope array makes a shocking discovery; the first experimentally confirmed evidence of dark matter and gravitational waves. They tell a sensational story--while the visible universe is isotropic and uniform, the shape of dark space is patterned; bands of dark matter and energy in the form of g waves propegate across the sky at a scale far beyond the end of greatness. Bubbles of dark matter surround most stars, and even most planets in the shape of colossal pseudospheres. It's observed that the more massive the object, the more perfectly its dark matter shadow resembles the tractricoid, somewhat analogous to the shape of planets and stars which have hydrostatic equilibrium being more spherical as mass increases.   It's also observed that the density of this cloud increases asymptotically the further away from the gravity well one travels, until it abruptly loses definition at an altitude which seems proportionate to the density of its host. The suns bubble extends to just before the orbit of Neptune, and is quite well defined, while the earth and moons are less well defined and actually intersect each other, creating chaotic dark matter turbulence and wakes. (This is theorized to be one of the reasons detecting g-waves from the earth was impossible, and why EM drives slow at higher altitudes.)  Meanwhile, testing of later drive models draws a parallel to the dark matter observations. More efficient versions appear to lose thrust proportionately to a relationship between their distance between the center of their local gravity well, and the surface of the well's dark matter shell. This phenomenon results in a thrust curve only very minorly different from earlier theories, and explains the disaster. Space travel using EMs is restored mid 2025.  Between 2026 and 2028, dozens of new models are proposed to explain these data. While many seem very robust, and a few even make inroads towards unifying QM and GR, they all fall apart upon another anomalous observation: The dark matter shells are absent from the early universe.   In 2029, scientists have arrived at one of two conclusions; the gravitational signatures of dark matter cannot travel forward in time indefinitely (it has limited range), or else some process in the space around galaxies has been producing new dark matter for the entirety of the current epoch. Most scientists agree on the latter.  2030: One more clue towards the nature of what is increasingly being called the 'post-einstein universe' is obtained. LHC researchers report that the probabilistic mass fluctuations of protons and neutrons in their experiments seem to be related to the atoms enthalpy of fusion. More ordered, larger atoms tend to have less mass than expected, and less ordered, smaller atoms tends to have more. This relationship isn't clearly defined, however, and many exceptions still demand explanation.  2031: operating under the assumption that these anomalous phenomena could all stem from a common source, but acknowledging that the raw data is coming from far too diverse of fields (quantum electrodynamics and nuclear physics, astrophysics and cosmology, materials and aerospace engineering) for any independent theorist to make a robust study, a team of logic engineers and mathematicians begins when on an AI framework for studying through the past decades observations.  In 2032, the last puzzle piece is uncovered. Dark matter in the early universe, at the edge of the observable universe. It appears to be pouring from the event horizon at random intervals, quickly becoming gravitationally bound to nearby light masses.  2032 has the first hints of unification published; a lone theorist working with a private firm discovers that in the distant universe dark matters appears at a schedule which closely follows the introduction of industrial em drives. A pause in the acceleration of the dark matters expansion is observed to coincide with the em drive moratorium from two decades before.  2033: the first interstellar probe is launched. Vast improvements to ship design over the previous decade ensure it leaves the solar system in less than 4 years, and will reach Barnard's star in about a decade and a half.  2034: a massive jet of dark matter at the boundary is observed, all but confirming the relation between early dark matter creation and the drives use. Energy appears to be moving back in time, and through shave to our event horizon whenever EM drives are used.  2035: the AI assembled to unify these observations, dubbed 'AL', presents its thesis. AL thinks that mass-energy-information conservation ought to replace the notion of mass-energy conservation; energy and mass can both be created and destroyed, provided information in the closed system remains proportionate. The closed system of information is the holographic boundary of the visible universe.  When the drive is switched on, it causes reordering of the internal structures of virtual particles which continuously pop in and out of existence (quantum foam). This decreases their mass and energy, tunneling it to the earliest ordered epoch when this volume became closed due to inflation, and creating 'dark matter' at the boundary which then travels forward through time to the present,  accreting around massive objects.  The mass energy gradient set up by this effect pushes on the vacuum itself, warping space time locally by inflating the boundary of the universe.  Once this is understood, there intentional creation of primordial dark matter begins; using mass tunnellers, distant dark matter wells are created throughout the galaxy and universe, allowing predetermined faster than normal light travel by creating gravitational 'highways' where space is less dense."
FutureWhatIf,38adfs,techno156,6,Tue Jun 2 22:41:38 2015 UTC,"Short answer?  Ransom or Propaganda value, followed swiftly by a Special Forces raid to retrieve them.  The militias and ISIS are smart enough to know that they need to be seen as more inclusive - not just Arab-Islamic men with machine guns and a black flag.  There was an Australian doctor - a young white man - that ISIS used in propaganda videos after he went to Syria to join them.  Also women from Europe that show up, enamored of the glory and ""send letters"" home to their friends, telling them to come join as well.  There's some evidence to say these letters are not exactly written willingly.   Longer answer:  The situation is highly unlikely to happen.  Radicalization is not a swift or unnoticed process.  First, you typically need despair.  If that's coupled with oppression, great.  You need a minority group that feels alienated and unwelcome, poor, deprived and suffering.    It's unlikely that the children of major Western leaders will feel this.  Most will live extremely comfortable lives.  There is a second string, which is a deep sense of social injustice and empathy with a cause.  If this is cemented with religion or ideology, so much the better.  Wealthier and educated people are more likely to fit into this category.  Our children are more likely to have any feelings of this nature directed into philanthropic gestures.  They'll be encouraged to form charities and hold fundraisers.  Looks better for the politician parent as well.  Step Two, Isolate them.  Cut them off from support structures and moderate influences, then form an echo chamber so that extreme thoughts become normal.  Typically this is done by a known extremist.  If you're in an environment where everyone talks smack about someone, you too will tend to subconsciously adopt that attitude, especially if you admire the person making the smack talk and wish to emulate them.  The kids are by now under constant surveillance by Secret Service/Diplomatic Protection.  They know that the kid is meeting with Radical X, and are already investigating ways of arresting and deporting post-haste.  The parents will be encouraged to re-engage with their kids, even outright forbid them interacting with the Radical.  Next, you need to structure the prospect's despair and fear.  As Yoda says, fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, and hate leads to suffering.  This is the primary aim.  Take a person's fear - fear of the cops coming down on you, fear of the government, fear of lynch mobs - and turn it to anger.  You didn't do anything to deserve this! It's all THEIR fault! Then take that anger and mold it to hate. Instil suspicion.  This is very easy to do if you've already cut them off from anyone that might point out they're being a bit extreme about this.  The protection agents by now have already deported the Radical, and are keeping a watch on the kid.  The parents are being told to re-engage with them now, or see their children used as ammunition against them.  Retreats and 'rehabs' are also suggested.  Nothing unusual about a rich kid in rehab.  But maybe the kid has converted to Islam without being fingered, consorted with radicals without being seen, grown more extremist without his or her parents becoming aware of it, and is now ready to leave for Syria.  They're still stopped at the border until the Protection details can provide bona-fides for their trip to Turkey.  Full security details need to be arranged on the other end to stop radicals kidnapping them and holding them for political leverage or ransom.  But suppose the kid slips past and boards a flight disguised and unnoticed.  That beard/headscarf proves useful after all.  Once there, they head to the Syria/Turkey border.  It's patrolled, but still leaks like a sieve in places.  Men offer to get them across the border.  A young son will make it.  A daughter will face a much more dangerous journey.  But they make it to Syria, and join up with a Syrian militia.  If it's one of the few remaining moderates, they will alert the Turkish embassy of the kid's home country, or contact the nearest Western trainer/supplier.    If it's a more extreme ISIS-affiliated group, then for a son, a gun will be pushed into his hands, and he will be thrown forward as cannon fodder.  A daughter will be ""assigned"" to a fighter as a wife.  But lets suppose they identify themselves and the local leader is intelligent enough to know that they're not lying, and that their value as a hostage is greater than the shock-factor of another beheading,  They will be sent to a ISIS stronghold location in Syria or Iraq and used first as political or financial leverage.  ""Pull out of the coalition or they die.""  ""We'll keep them safe for $5 million a month""  If political or financial help is not forthcoming, the kid will be used in propaganda videos about how great the Islamic State is, and how evil/corrupt his home country and his parents are.  This will swiftly be followed by a Special Forces raid of some description to ""get them out of there!"""

On reviewing satellite imagery of their own and confirming with US intelligence that apparently nothing is going on, recon flights over North Korea from both South Korea and China will begin within 24 hours.  The information is too big to be kept secret - it hits the news and the world is also aware that something is going on after the first 24 hours.  Speculation runs rampant, from sudden disease to wondering if the North Koreans have tunneled underground, mass suicide, Korean rapture, a secret South Korean weapon, aliens - in the early hours every possibility flies over the airwaves.  Within 48 hours, unable to see anything useful from the air, South Korea sends a small ground team to investigate.  Several independent news reporters either skirt the Chinese or SK border guards or land on the coast and infiltrate the country.  Contact is lost with the ground team shortly after they enter their first town and they are not seen again.  None of the reporters or independent investigators broadcast anything and they do not return.  In the following week two more ground teams are sent with different objectives and methods but meet the same fate.  More intrepid reporters infiltrate and fall silent.  Autonomous vehicles are sent in as well, sometimes in tandem with ground teams, but each time communication is cut and the vehicles and personnel are lost.  None of the teams or vehicles sent ever see a human being - no bodies, just empty buildings and streets before the broadcast stops.  Air and satellite observation of the ground teams and ground AVs show what happens when contact is lost - the ground vehicles simply stop and remain in place, as though they were shut off.  The humans all walk into nearby buildings and do not emerge again.  After a month no more ground teams with humans are sent and the initial flood of brave reporters has largely dried up.  The occasional brave or desperate soul tries his luck, but nobody ever returns from North Korea.  North Korea becomes a dead place, and slowly life settles in to this new reality.  South Korea reduces (but never eliminates) their military commitments along the border.  As the years pass, from a distance the world can see nature beginning to reclaim the silent North Korean cities.  Given North Korea's place in the world, the media is divided on whether 'The disappearance' as it's referred to was ultimately a good thing or not.  In 2034, South Korea goes silent.  There are no broadcasts, border guards aren't on patrol, and satellites can't see anything moving."

FutureWhatIf,3858rc,HaydenHank,9,Mon Jun 1 23:10:55 2015 UTC,"Dramatization Ahead.  You were warned.    Following a trail of clues, a team of anthropologists head upriver from Manaus along the Amazon.  They have an amateur camera crew with them – a local filmmaker is wanting to create a documentary about ‘lost tribes’ – Amazon rainforest tribes that still live in a stone-age culture.  They’ve been hearing about a tribe deep in the jungle that other tribes are referring to as povo das estrelas- in Portuguese this translates to “people of the stars”  It’s thought that this could be a tribe that is on the cusp of using star patterns and constellations to form a primitive calendar system.  Reading about how the Egyptians did it is one thing – being able to observe it actually happening is exciting for the anthropologists.  This could get them a mention in the Journal Of Anthropology.  Arriving riverside, the skiff leaves them and heads back dowriver.  The local guide promises to lead them to the tribe the next day, so they move a little bit away from the water and set up camp.  The filmmaker does a couple of “Day 1” interviews before the team settles in for the night.  The jungle is full of sound – coughing of prowling jaguars, the incessant cacophony of insects.  At about 2am, there is a sudden cessation of noise, which wakes the filmmaker.  He’s blearily fumbling the camera on when there’s a booming sound, and noise begins returning.  Talking about it at breakfast, the general conclusion is that it was thunder, or possibly a military jet – there’s rumours that the Peruvians sometimes (illegally) fly over the area. Over the next week, the guide leads them through thick jungle.   Two members of the team fall sick, and two of the camera crew are sent back to the river landing with severe insect bites.  Depleted, they continue on, eventually arriving at a clearing.  It’s about six hundred meters wide, almost perfectly circular, and around the edges is a circle of huts.  Men, women and children – a tribe about two hundred strong are working around the village.  In the center of the circle is a complex pattern of stones on cleared ground.  The guide introduces the filmmakers and anthropologists to the povo das estrelas tribe.  The guide introduces the capitao of the tribe – the leader.  The translation gets underway.  The team has prepared a great deal of explanations as to the world they come from – how to describe metal as hard not-stone, or the cameras as painting-makers.  To their surprise, the Capitao is not only unsurprised at these explanations, but actively asks them about alloys and if the cameras run on film.  Furious, the anthropologists demand to know who has contaminated their ‘pristine’ existence.   From the title ‘Capitao’ – suspiciously similar to the Portugese word for “captain”, to his advanced metallurgical knowledge – it’s obvious that they have been beaten to the punch by other “modern” contact.  Was it slavers?  Drug runners?  Military?  Or, shock horror, has the team been scooped by another group of anthropologists?  The capitao spins a tale that sounds fantastical at first.  Many, many nights ago, the tribe was small and pursued by other, more aggressive tribes.  They ran and found this clearing, where enemies were lying in wait.  The enemies took their women and were about to kill their men when a great metal bird appeared and sat in the clearing.  The bird laid eggs, and from these eggs men hatched.  They ran faster than a jaguar, and neither jungle nor river obstructed them.  The Egg-men chased the enemies away, and then returned to teach the Tribe how to read the stars, and imparted many sky-secrets.  They then returned to the metal bird which gathered them up and returned to its nest in the skies.  There is a legend that the Tribe was given a message to deliver, and that upon its delivery, the Tribe would be gathered by a metal bird and taken to the Sky-nest, where their enemies could not pursue.  The anthropology team is livid.  This is classic cultural contamination – the metal bird is an aircraft of some sort, and the egg-men are probably soldiers.  Sure enough, follow-up questions indicate a cargo-cult of sorts has taken hold.  The circular space in the village centre is so the metal bird can land.  Crude stick-men effigies in the corner of every home wear a patterned green sheet – classic camouflage.  The team sets about to see what they can salvage, when the filmcrew come across an interesting tale from a young boy.  He’s enamoured of their candy, and tells them that the metal bird often visits.  In fact, it was here three weeks ago.  In another conversation, a grad student with the Anthropology team finds out the metal bird visits on a schedule.    Comparing notes later after a ‘confession-cam’ type filming, the student and filmmaker conclude the metal bird is due to return in a week.  The leader of the expedition is tired, hungry, frustrated and angry.  He chooses not to listen and announces the camp will pack up and head back for the river – he used a satellite phone to call for a pickup in a week’s time.    As they leave, the capitao gives them a gift – a carved wooden box with symbols along all six sides.   It shows highly skilled woodworking capability – and simply sends the lead researcher into another expletive-fuelled rant.  Nearly a month in the jungle and his discovery is irretrievably contaminated!  Three days later, the crew are trekking back.  They’ve set up camp for the night, when again around 2am, dead silence strikes.  The camera-crew is still up, cutting footage, so they are able to film as a dark shape flies overhead.  It looks large and vaguely circular, although that could be perspective.  It’s only visible because it’s occluding the stars.  Three hours later, the jungle is still silent, and the entire camp is roused.  The anthropologists are staring around uneasily when there is a flash of light and a tremendous booming sound – from the direction of the village.   Sound returns slowly after that.  It takes some convincing, but the camera crew successfully talk the researcher into returning to the povo das estrelas village.  Returning, they find the huts flattened and no signs of the villagers.  All their possessions are missing.  Even the ‘gifts’ that the team left of metal knives have gone.  Concerned, the team leader calls the authorities in Manaus.  Suspicion is on drug-runners or slavers that have possibly captured the villagers, and then destroyed the houses.  A Brazilian army unit arrives by helicopter forty-eight hours later, part of anti-exploitation program.  They investigate the scene, and then ferry the researchers and filmmakers home.  Back in Manaus, the lead researcher submits his paper, complete with photos of the woodwork box and stills of the ‘silent slaver plane’ that apparently carried them off.  It goes viral online as part of a social media campaign - #takeninthenight.  Three days after that, US agents burst in and confiscate everything – film, photos, reports, the box and other artefacts.  Demanding an explanation, the filmmaker is taken with the agents, who after a very thorough background check, read the man in.  On the nights of the silence, Peruvian, Brazilian and Columbian Air forces picked up a mysterious radar contact.  It exhibited frankly impossible maneuverability for an aircraft, including a vertical ascent to above 70,000 meters in under a minute.  The pattern of stones in the village centre is not unique – a similar structure was uncovered by an archaeological dig in Africa, along with tales of “sky gods”.  The wooden box is critically important – one of the symbols is of the Pleiades star cluster – and another symbol matches how Sol is seen from that point in space. The other faces are filled with intricate glyphs that follow no apparently logical progressions.  The most telling aspect of the box however is that it is made out of a wood-like substance….but that substance has absolutely no commonality with any terrestrial plant.  Whatever the wood is, it’s unlike anything else on Earth.  The final evidence is a NSA spy photo – showing a disc-like shape on the ground in the village, and what appears to be the villagers clustering around and boarding the disc.  The filmmaker relays the 'legend' about delivering a messasge and how the tribe believed the metal bird would take them away to a sky-nest once it was delivered.  The box is obviously the message, but what does it say?"

The net affect would be the eradication of whatever forces participated on the ISIS side. Israel might claim some additional land as a safety buffer, but that would unlikely.

With the exception of isolated attacks on Israeli territory on 6 and 9 October, the military combat actions during the war took place on Arab territory, mostly in the Sinai and the Golan Heights.

I imagined the checkpoint attack described in the prompt as more of a suicide bomber or hit-and-run skirmish type of thing than a “storm the gates” full-scale assault. Southern Syria is presently an Assad stronghold so there’s no way ISIS could launch an offensive through that territory unless Damascus had already fallen. OP didn’t put a timeframe on the FWI scenario so I assumed he meant this attack would come like next week, not in some hypothetical future post-Assad failed state terrorist playground Syria. I actually wouldn’t be too surprised to something like this happen in the near future - maybe a car bomb going off at a checkpoint in Sinai and killing a few Israeli soldiers – as kind of a “we brought jihad to the Zionists” bragging rights thing for their twitter account."

Sure, campaigning season starts early now, but it isn't so close that it would become any kind of logicstical problem.    So, what would be the consequences? In chronological order:   Quite a shocking event for the country, cue (news-)media orgasm. Weeks of coverage of the event and anything related to it in even minor ways.   All the other current democratic candidates suspend their campaigns for a while, out of respect/because they are expected to. (Webb, O'Malley, Sanders, etc.)   At some point, the attention will refocus on ... who now has a shot at becoming the democratic nominee? Lots of polling for declared and even more undeclared candidates. The field now opens up for a number of candidates (traditional ones, especially). Who? Elizabeth Warren might be asked to run on the left, especially to continue a 'female 2016 legacy' (or some such narrative). Various governors (Cuomo, Malloy, Warner, Schweitzer) are more traditional choices who'd have almost no chance in 2016 with Clinton running, but would have an opening with her dead. McCaskill might start dreaming. The strongest potential candidate would probably be Joe Biden. He wouldn't enter the race soon (because of his son's death), and might even wait till late 2015. He has the name recognition for a late entry in a field with no clear front-runner and a very good explanation why he needed the time. The democratic nomination would - obviously, I am now speculating some, but these are my informed ramblings - probably go to Joe Biden if he runs. He is somewhat popular, has the VP advantage, has quite a tragic story that will get media attention and will generate some sympathy amongst friendlies (so Democratic voters). If he doesn't run, it is quite an open season, with no clear frontrunner that I can see. Early primaries will be very imporant; I still think a Bernie Sanders win is quite unlikely, but probably not impossible. The general election campaign will occassionally reference Hillary Clinton (certainly the Democratic nominee will mention her), but it'll be long enough by then it'll be a rather traditional race in most regards. She obviously was a very strong candidate, so I'd say it'll increase Republican chanes to get into the White House. The general dynamics in presidential elections favor the Democrats slightly, I'd argue. It depends on the strength of the candidates. Biden vs. Bush/Christie/Cruz/Fiorina should be a (D) win. Walker/Rubio?/Bush?/Huckabee?/Paul vs. Webb/McCaskill/Sanders/Malloy might be a (R) win, etc. Difficult to predict the dynamics of any race ahead of time. Strongest candidates for both would make it a Biden vs Walker/Bush?/Rubio? race. I'd put my money on Biden then, with the strongest (R) chances reserved for Walker.   I think the drama of it alll would probably be overstated at first; but I don't see what long-lasting effects it would have, though.  So, overall impact? Opens the field in the Democratic primaries (obviously). Makes it somewhat less likely for the (D)s to win the general, but I'd still peg them as favorites. Overall, the big line of history won't care at all; it wouldn't be that big of an event. (Though it might shift the White House from D to R, which would be semi-big.)"
FutureWhatIf,380w88,SharpHawkeye,3,Mon Jun 1 08:50:42 2015 UTC,"I think you're underplaying Warren a little bit (as the female Democrat standard bearer).   There would be an enormous amount of attention on Hillary at the Democratic convention. Video tributes, teary speeches by Bill and Chelsea, etc. Likely gives the Dem nominee a significant boost in the polls through August, maybe even September.  Also, it's ify to say that the big line of history doesn't change. Is this tragedy enough to motivate a change in politics to a more civil discourse? Is this the end of the primary/caucus model of selecting candidates? Is there any change in gun control post 2016 election?"
FutureWhatIf,380w88,BrainOnLoan,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:00:17 2015 UTC,"Is this tragedy enough to motivate a change in politics to a more civil discourse?    No, as seen by the Kennedy assassinations. Politics didn't turn less ugly thereafter. Also ... how was the response to the 2011 Tucson shooting? Hardly any, besides human interest stories about Gabrielle Giffords.   Is this the end of the primary/caucus model of selecting candidates?   No, and I don't even see a connection. How would that come about?   Is there any change in gun control post 2016 election?   No, it'll be the usual... ""this is not the time to politicize this issue"". Etc. We've had plenty of similiar events (and worse ... Sandy Hook) that had hardly any impact on the gun control issue.    I'll concede that I may have underrated Warren somewhat. If she ran a good campaign, she might indeed pick up a lot of former Hillary supporter and give Joe Biden a fight (if he runs; otherwise, she'd indeed be one of the stronger contenders).  There would be indeed a convention bumb, larger than usual probably, but bumps tend not to last; hard to say whether it would impact the general election for more than a point or so (though a point is quite something)."

FutureWhatIf,37zfdq,Telochi,19,Sun May 31 18:26:22 2015 UTC,"Preface: Putin becomes obsessed with the idea that a major war with the West is inevitable. He begrudgingly admits that without using his nuclear arsenal, Russia’s military probably can’t defeat the combined might of NATO. He decides that he must strike first, and orders his commanders to begin drafting war plans. Within a few weeks a strategy emerges – Russia will launch simultaneous full-scale surprise attacks on Ukraine, the Baltics and Alaska. It’s basically just an extreme version of what worked with the Crimea annexation – a surprise blitz, a quick occupation, then sue for peace before NATO can coordinate a counterattack. It’s risky, but the linchpin was the assumption that everyone in the Western world would be losing control of their bladders for fear of imminent nuclear apocalypse. This territorial expansion would accomplish several of Putin’s core geostrategic objectives (i.e. buffer zone in Eastern Europe, foothold in North America, and hopefully shatter NATO/end America's superpower status) and put Russia in a much stronger position to defeat the West the next time around. Putin believes Alaska is strategically vital: the Russian Navy is desperate for warm water ports and the untapped oil fields will be crucial for a sustained war effort. Additionally, he thinks an attack on the homeland will distract the Americans from the theater in Eastern Europe.   In the weeks leading up to the surprise attack, Putin delivers a series of fiery nationalistic and anti-Western speeches. Several times he asserts that Russia isn’t afraid of a few mushroom clouds. Putin also bans all Western media sources. Several prominent opposition leaders are arrested on trumped-up charges. Finland and Sweden reject Russian offers of non-aggression pacts.   Russia’s surprise attack on Alaska comes at a time in which the vast majority of Americans are completely off-guard: 5:00 PM on the Fourth of July. The invasion is preceded by a massive cyberattack on American and Canadian power grids, temporarily bringing them offline and delaying a counterattack. Wave after wave of bombers destroy airfields and military bases throughout the state. Thousands of paratroopers capture Anchorage and Juneau Red Dawn-style while special forces units take control of critical infrastructure. Within two days civilians are being rounded up at gunpoint and herded into internment camps. The Russian Navy moves to seize control of shipping lines in the Bering Sea. The initial strike cripples America’s military capabilities in Alaska, which falls to Russian control within a week. Any surviving servicemen and Alaskan citizens not in camps melt into the bush and go into full guerilla warfare mode. The Russians immediately begin moving in the equipment needed to drill for oil on the North Slope.   Meanwhile, in Europe: Russian bombs fall on Kiev day and night. Within two weeks there are Russian tanks on the Maidan Square. The Estonian and Latvian governments collapse after a week of sustained carpet bombing. Putin has declared martial law in Russia, dissolved the duma and outlawed all political parties except United Russia. With the Russian flag flying over Juneau, Kiev, Tallinn and Riga, Putin attempts to broker a ceasefire with NATO, but is completely ignored. Both China and India strongly condemn Russian aggression but maintain neutrality.   NATO’s immediate response is to launch attacks on Russian naval units in the North Sea and Arctic Ocean. Polish and Russian warplanes dogfight over the skies of Ukraine while U.K. fighters scramble to intercept Russian planes north of Scotland. German, Hungarian and Romanian tank and troop divisions prepare to launch a counteroffensive into Ukraine.   Back in America: After a week of frantic scrambling, the power grid is coming back online. Obama’s first priority is to retake Alaska. Miles-long columns of American and Canadian forces begin advancing north on the newly militarized West Coast highway system, while U.S. and Russian naval units clash in the North Pacific. Russia’s ability to access North Slope oil is hampered by guerillas who frequently bomb remote stretches of pipeline.   A month into the war: Before this all started, Putin was sure NATO would back down, and his craziness was just tempered enough to prevent them from doing anything. Now he feels like he’s losing control of the situation. Polish forces have occupied Kaliningrad and invaded Belarus. A combined NATO tank force is pushing towards Kiev. The U.S. Navy has begun a blockade of Russia in the Atlantic while Turkey does the same in the Black Sea. Skirmishes are breaking out along the Russo-Finnish border. Chunks of Alaska are starting to fall back into American hands after Russia’s defeat at the decisive Battle of Anchorage.   Four months into the war: Putin is beginning to panic. Alaska has been liberated. Belarus has fallen. He was able to break NATO’s siege of Russian-occupied Kiev, but suffered heavy losses. There is a bloody insurgency raging all across Ukraine (which NATO supplies with weaponry and intelligence). The naval blockade has gotten so bad Russia is forced to ration food. Whispers about a possible coup are growing louder. China flatly refuses Putin’s pleas to enter the war on his side. He's desperate enough that he briefly considers offering them a chunk of Siberia in exchange for a declaration of war on NATO, but decides against it. NATO has begun massing its forces in Lithuania and on the Russo-Belorussian and Polish-Ukrainian borders.   Six months into the war: Western Ukraine, Latvia and Estonia have all fallen back into NATO’s hands. The Russian military was routed from the Baltics after its humiliating defeat at the Battle of Riga. NATO forces have begun moving into Russian territory. Putin’s analysts are convinced they are simply waiting out the winter to strike for the Russian heartland. Air raids over Moscow and St. Petersburg are becoming increasingly common and civilian causalities have been high. Thousands of people rally in Red Square demanding an end to the war and that Putin step down. Security forces open fire on the crowds, killing over 300 people. Russia’s defeat seems imminent. Western leaders are openly discussing plans to break the post-war Russian Federation into a dozen smaller nations.  Somewhere in the North Atlantic: A fanatically nationalistic Russian submarine captain finally snaps. He tells his crew that Russia is losing this war while Putin cowers in his underground bunker too afraid to utilize nuclear weaponry in defense of the Motherland. He goes rogue and launches a nuclear missile that explodes over New York City. This very quickly devolves into a full nuclear exchange between NATO and Russia. The world goes to hell. North Korea invades the South. Israel nukes Tehran and the Mideast erupts in chaos. Pakistan and India also exchange a few nukes.   A year later: The atomic finale of World War III ushered in a devastating nuclear winter. Global agricultural output plummets, resulting in severe famines across the world. The governments of America, Russia and Europe have all collapsed. Despite their neutrality India and China are also hit especially hard by famine, and both countries eventually implode in Malthusian anarchy. At least two billion have died from the firestorms, radioactive fallout and starvation.   100 years later: Global population hovers around 3.5 billion. The Northern Hemisphere has never recovered. North America and much of Eurasia are desolate radioactive wastelands. In the aftermath of this terrible war, the South American Union became the world’s dominant power, though its international reach was limited to a modest blue-water navy patrolling the sea lanes and a network of alliances with the dozen or so functioning nation-states that still existed – chiefly New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and Indonesia. Critical shortages of nonrenewable resources made salvage one of the few growth industries of the era; an enterprising salvage merchant who know how to barter with the villagers and nomads of the stateless zones for scrap technology from the ruined cities could become rich in a single voyage. Important as they were, these salvaged technologies were only accessible to the few. The Union and a few other nation-states still kept some aging military aircraft operational, but maritime traffic once again was carried by tall ships, and horse-drawn wagons become a standard mode of transport on land away from the railroads. Radio communication had long since taken over from the last fitful fragments of the Internet, and electric grids were found only in cities.  Edit: fixed a few typos"

FutureWhatIf,37xrb3,twogunsalute,15,Sun May 31 07:38:40 2015 UTC,"UMP (or now 'Les Républicains')'s leader Nicolas Sarkozy is found guilty in one of the various legal affairs he is involved in and is put in jail.   With much infighting in the main right-wing opposition party, it splits, mostly between Gaullists like Henri Guaino, Centrists like Alain Juppé and far-right 'securitarians' like Claude Guéant or Brice Hortefeux. Some join the center parties (mostly the very - neo-liberal UDI) and some more get more and more in favor of Le Pen and the Front National because of their disgust of the two mainstream parties. The mainstream right is overall politically crushed.   On the left, Hollande push for the TPP despite the lack of popular support for the treaty. Some scandal erupts in the ranks of the Socialist Party (like some MP or minister having an offshore bank account) and furthers the disgust of the French population with the government.   The application of the Loi Macron (neo-liberal law, threatening the former labor laws) also drives a lot of Socialist Party voters to the far left and to EELV (the greens).   The Socialist Party's MP's and important political figures that disagree with the government's policies (that are too right-leaning for them) finally decide to secede and create a scion party. A few  join the ranks of the ""Front de Gauche"" (main far left group) and the Greens. The examples of Podemos and Syriza further drives voters from the Socialist Party to the radical left.   Hollande's popularity reaches an all-time low and unemployment doesn't decrease. The Socialist Party tries to reach out to the former UMP/Républicains electorate and become less and less a party of the left. This further alienates the Left wing of the party and drives even more people to the scion parties and the Front de Gauche.   Campaign starts and Hollande is nominated for the Socialist Party. Melenchon is the Front de Gauche's candidate and the Socialist Party's scions and the greens have a common candidate. With them and other far-left candidates (Philippe Poutou for the Nouveau Parti Anticapitaliste), the left is very divided.   The MoDem (center/center-left party) has a candidate. The UDI (center/center-right) allies itself with Alain Juppé's group and choses him as their presidential candidate. Juppé holds most of the remains of the UMP voters. The rest is either with the Front National or fractured in the middle. We see a large growth of neo-gaullist movements such as Debout La France and Union Populaire Républicaine. The Front National also considerably gains in power and a Hollande - Le Pen face-off is expected in the second turn of election.    The first round of votes comes and the Left is absolutely destroyed : the distrust for the governing party and the division of the rest of left has been its doom. Juppé's center right coalition will face Le Pen in the second turn. Juppé then reaches to the left but mostly to the right to get most of the former UMP electorate and because a very large abstention is expected from the left voters. This is a strategic mistake.   The vote comes and the abstention is nearing a staggering 50%. Juppé loses by half a point, having politically overextended himself from the center left to the right, whereas Le Pen kept to her far-right ideas, with a touch of anticapitalist rhetoric to reach to the working class. Le Pen is elected president.   The days following the elections' results see mass protests in the streets of France and heavy rioting in some places inhabited mostly by people coming from immigrant families. The next 5 years will be hard."

Besides that, I really don't know what he could be nominated for. Snowden has experience as a sys admin, which isn't exactly useful for a cabinet position. He has no political experience, so he would be pretty worthless.  It would basically end with a bunch of people asking why Rand Paul just committed political suicide. This move really gains nothing for him.

With the average age of the country over 65, the government will go deep into debt trying to care for the aged at the same time as the economy contracts. The result will be a national collapse. Neighbors like China or Russia will pledge aid to the failing state to score political points, and if the USA is out of the area may even occupy territory. If the USA is still in the area the country would be run with US assistance. Japan's large international corporations wouldn't find enough of a workforce in their native country to justify the huge tax burden inflicted by the severely indebted government try to provide to the elderly and would move their headquarters elsewhere, further draining the already contracting economy.   It's quite fallacious to imply that the minority of Japanese of working age, living in rusty old hallowed out cities reminiscent of the Rust Belt thanks to population decline, would all be experts in computer and AI programming. My guess is half the population would be nurses or doctors and the other half would work two jobs to pay the taxes to the government that pay's the latter's salary.  Even if there is AI technology to take care of the elderly and provide labor then it would be too expensive for the country to afford or produce. If the technology is not advanced enough than it would obviously solve nothing. If the technology is too advanced than the AI uses the elders as host bodies and calculate that humanity is irrational and inferior to themselves. By 2060 the human Japanese Empire is on the run from the Machine Collective and its army of zombie robots have defeated them thanks to superior numbers.

For FIFA to disband, they would have to lose their sponsors and the money would have to run out. The most straightforward way I can see this happening is if both European, North and South American associations get tired of the corruption and withdrawal from FIFA. They would form their own group, but we'll get to that later. For now, with most of the popular teams gone, the World Cup just won't be as interesting. I could see FIFA lasting for a few more world cups, and perhaps even being profitable for a few of them. However, viewership would go down with each successive cup after the withdrawal, and with that so does revenue. They'll get less and less sponsors as viewership drops, and the ones that stick around will be worth less and less. Eventually, if their leadership is terrible and can't salvage the situation, they'll just run out of money and disband. Though the more likely outcome is that they'll evolve into something else. For the WCs in this situation, they might be able to survive long enough to run through all of their plans, but without their top teams, the games would just be a shadow of their former selves. If they disband before 2022, then Qatar would just be shit out of luck.  For football in general, the sport will continue to survive and thrive. If FIFA dies, something will take its place. The group formed by those who originally withdrew will be very similar to FIFA in structure, though hopefully more transparent. It'll probably start small and then grow with each passing tournament; it'll basically eat up FIFA's market share. In the end, after a decade or two, things will most likely be the exact same for fans as they are today. For the organization, I could see a push for it to be more transparent, and thus be less corrupt; however, there is always the chance that nothing changes and it's just the same as FIFA today."

This scepticism against middle eastern intervention has gotten to a point where we are not committing troops to Yemen despite the threat it presents to the flow of oil through Bab el Mandab. Rouhani is far more moderate than Ahmadinejad. Iran is far less anti western than it was even 5 years ago and without the death to America rhetoric the us public would be less inclined to violence We have agreed to reduced sanctions in exchange for nuclear transparency. It is very unlikely that they'll get thr bomb. Even if they do its most likely just to balance against Israel.

I think we could expect to see major backlash from the international community, perhaps manifesting in sanctions amd most certainly in the severing of trade negotiations.   We might also witness backlash from Russia seeing as they have such a vested interest in the security of Syria. This could include further expansion into Eastern Europe and the UN would have a tough time mobilizing support against it.  Isis or AQAP would spread into Iran and we would lose the strait of hormuz, meaning the world would lose literally 20% of its oil supply. This would obviously mainly affect Europe, so eu countries would have no other option than to lift Russian Embargos.  Russia would experience high rates of growth, re expand into MENA, and increase its sway on the UN and the us would piss of its allies and lose MENA completely.

Let's say, hypothetically, that this new tobacco plant is genetically engineered to produce a chemical whose effects are similar to psilocybin. It's carefully designed, well-researched, and not known to have any possible long-term negative effects.  PHASE 1: It quietly, discreetly becomes available. The product resembles a cigarette, but with brightly colored filters or something to distinguish them from actual smokes. They're labeled as ""Novelty Cigarettes,"" and carry a ""Not For Human Consumption"" label.  PHASE 2: They slowly catch on. It's a very quiet, kind of underground sort of thing. It's completely legal. Some people are wary and avoid it, since it's ""unnatural,"" but many people really enjoy it.  PHASE 3: It gets too popular. Some 14 year old gets their hands on them, and they have a bad trip. Their mom, who has that ""Can I Speak To Your Manager"" haircut, takes them to the ER, freaking out. The kid is fine, and suffers no ill effects. However, the media learns about it. Newspaper journalists who also have CISTYM haircuts start calling for bans, ""for the children,"" because drugs are bad, m'kay.  PHASE 4: The original product is banned.  PHASE 5: A new and basically identical product comes onto the market. Like the original, it's sold discreetly at tobacco stores and gas stations. However, the active ingredient is somewhat different. The product is still enjoyable, but the effects are less similar to real psilocybin than the original product.  PHASE 6: A recurring cycle of bans. A set of chemicals or products is banned, and then the manufacturers simply create a new but suitably different GM tobacco product.  PHASE 7: Three or four iterations of Phase 6 have occurred. At this point, the effects of the new phytochemicals in the GM tobacco are quite different from real psilocybin. They're still hallucinogenic, but (let's say) they have a stronger dissociative effect, along with some stimulant effects. The product is still enjoyable, but it's a totally different animal. It's far more likely to cause a bad trip than the original, but it's also quite powerful. Most people can't handle something this strong, which is also prone to cause paranoia as a side effect. They abandon it and go back to actual shrooms. However, a small segment of people really enjoy the high, so the keep using it.  PHASE 8: A renewed movement to ban the drugs, for the children, because drugs are bad, m'kay. Law enforcement begins to bully and harass shop owners, until they become afraid to carry the product. It gets harder and harder to find. Another ban occurs, and after that, shop owners won't sell it for fear of being arrested. It's basically dead.  PHASE 9: You can still find it online, if you know where to look. It's quite well-hidden, and takes a lot of searching. However, the current products are very far removed, chemically, from the original GM tobacco, which produced a chemical extremely close to psilocybin. It's not really worth the effort, and the weird chemicals could actually potentially be dangerous. It's basically dead."

I've heard that people in the Balkans can cite events that happened 1000-500 years ago and make them sound like they were very recent, as historical events are considered relevant to a nation or ethnic groups identity.   The Battle of Kosovo, which happened in 1389, is considered by Serbians to be a defining moment in the history of their nation. They didn't really win the battle, but they are so proud of the resistance they put up that it's similar in status to the American Revolution over there. This is why it hurts so bad to lose Kosovo.

When they do join, assuming they do not accede together or in groups, they will come in (1) Serbia (2) Montenegro (3) Bosnia/Herzegovina (4) Albania (5) Macedonia and (6) Kosovo.  Kosovo is the biggest basket case, and Greece is unlikely to drop the FYR Macedonia naming issue.

Who: Non-Sunni Islam  ISIS, ISIL, Da'esh.  Call it what you will, the organization has made no bones of, and has even bragged about, the vicious punishment awaiting anyone who refuses to convert to their particular brand of ultra-fundamentalist Islam.  Christians, Shia Islam, Kurds - all are treated the same way.  Men are killed, women are raped, children are sold into slavery.    Atrocity Rating:  ""If there is a God, he will have to beg me for forgiveness."" For women and female children, the best they can look forward to is years of sexual abuse, being forced to carry their rapist's child, and being expected to adhere to strict Sharia law. For men and male children, it is conversion to be used as cannon fodder, or death.  When: Right Now Where: North Korea. Who: Political Dissidents  To Disobey the Great Successor is to invite calamity on your family.  To even think that he is not the divine and perfect successor to the Great Leader is heresy.

Obviously, Israel could exterminate the entire population within the Gaza Strip and the  West Bank if they wanted to. Obviously they haven't. But to discard this as a deliberate genocide simply because the bombardments of Gaza weren't the full extent of Israel's power is an atrocious standard to set for supposedly civilised states.

On the other hand, millions of skeptics and people of different faiths will be doubtful. Debunkers of every stripe will appear en masse, all of them offering non-miraculous explanations as to how the vision could have occurred.  As for the broader, more long term implications of such an event? Consider the events that took place at Fatima, Portugal in 1917. Multiple visions by a small group of witnesses over a period of days. The story caught on and has become quite famous. But did the world really change after that?  This scenario is different in that there'd be (potentially) billions of witnesses. Also, there would be an audio-visual record of what happened. So maybe it would be a more powerful effect compared to other miraculous visions. On the other hand, we are talking about 2015. Most people have seen the impossible simply by going to the movies.

Muslims can't kill animals or even ague with each other inside the mosque. It is the Holiest site in Islam and supposed to be a sacred place of worship. Many Muslims don't like the Saudis but like I said no one will ever stand for attacking the Ka'aba. I still don't see Iran and Saudi working together as their differences won't disappear. Honestly any attack would be stopped early on, following it there would be executions, mass arrests, clampdown on society if the attackers were Saudi, and maybe an invasion of Isis territory if the attackers were from abroad."
FutureWhatIf,3762xn,yu139,2,Mon May 25 07:27:09 2015 UTC,"Grand Mosque seizure:       The Grand Mosque seizure occurred during November and December 1979 when extremist insurgents calling for the overthrow of the House of Saud took over Al-Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, during the annual Hajj pilgrimage. The insurgents declared that the Mahdi (the ""redeemer of Islam"") had arrived in the form of one of their leaders – Mohammed Abdullah al-Qahtani – and called on Muslims to obey him.  The seizure of Islam's holiest site, the taking hostage of hundreds of Hajj pilgrims, and the deaths of hundreds of militants, security forces and hostages caught in crossfire in the ensuing battles for control of the site, all shocked the Islamic world. The siege ended two weeks after the takeover began and the mosque was cleared.  Following the attack, the Saudi state implemented a stricter enforcement of Islamic code.

There would be absolute chaos in the Middle East. Shiites and Sunnis would both be outraged and out for blood. Saudi authorities would quickly close the Masjid al-Haram and go after ISIS in earnest. A coalition would form among Muslim countries nearby. The Ayatollah would offer assistance to Saudi Arabia, Iran's staunchest foe besides Israel and the United States, in a historic move. Military forces would move into Iraqi territory from the east and south and Hezbollah would take the fight to ISIS from the west in Syria. In a matter of months ISIS territory is diminished to a few small pockets of resistance. Al-Baghdadi would have been killed in airstrikes, along with his top lieutenants. ISIS would be silenced for once. Later on, a new terror group will take its place, declaring al-Baghdadi a martyr and the Muslim coalition who defeated him a force of evil on par with Zionists and Western powers. Through terrorist attacks, intimidation, and charismatic speeches from a faceless leader who via audiotape declares himself to be the Mahdi, disillusioned people will once again gravitate toward this new group and bring death to anyone who stands in their way."

ISIS aren't interested in diplomacy, they're interested in expansion. In response, their press office releases a video saying how this shows America is weak and willing to capitulate, that ISIS is winning and that it can be no more than a few years until the Caliphate becomes all-powerful. The US is condemned by its allies in the region, with Turkey and Jordan being particularly vocal about America's new non-interventionist policy. Any progress US/Iranian relations have had over the past few years is wiped out overnight. The UK is placed into a difficult position, but will eventually side with European condemnation over American support. This puts a strain on the Special Relationship that won't be fixed for a longass time. The UN makes it clear that ISIS will not be admitted no matter what.  Hillary (who's kind of a war hawk on the quiet) denounces the President's response, but it's not enough: the Republicans go all-out on the offensive, and clean up in 2016.  So yes. Don't do this, Obama."

For the first time, fringe figures on the right who insisted Obama was some kind of Islamic sleeper agent no longer seem completely insane.   Impeachment proceedings begin in short order, and the House Judiciary Committee approves charges relating to a failure to execute the laws of the United States. World leaders are nearly unanimous in their support of removing Obama from office, and the House votes for impeachment with support from every Republican member and over half of Democrats joining them.   The Senate convicts with a 90-10 vote and Obama becomes the first President to be removed from office through the impeachment process.   Hillary Clinton, who had been vocal in her support of impeachment comfortably defeats sitting President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders (who was one of the ten to vote against conviction in the Senate) in the Democratic Primary. During the general election, Clinton insists she had warned the country of Obama's naivete during the 2008 primary and had managed to protect the nation during her tenure as Secretary of State in Obama's first term.   She runs on a platform that will make sure nobody accuses of her of not being hawkish enough, attempting to get to the right of GOP candidate Scott Walker on Foreign Policy issues. However, the Democratic party's image has been damaged beyond repair and Obama's remaining supporters are alienated by Clinton's denouncement of the former President.   Walker and his running mate Marco Rubio win 40 states while receiving 55% of the popular vote. The GOP also picks up another 20 seats in the House."

Kurdistan roughly encompasses the northwestern Zagros and the eastern Taurus mountain ranges.   Contemporary use of Kurdistan refers to four parts of a greater Kurdistan, which include parts of southeastern Turkey (Northern Kurdistan), northern Syria (Western Kurdistan), northern Iraq (Southern Kurdistan), and western Iran (Eastern Kurdistan).   Some Kurdish nationalist organizations seek to create an independent nation state of Kurdistan, consisting of some or all of the areas with Kurdish majority, while others campaign for greater Kurdish autonomy within the existing national boundaries.    Iraqi Kurdistan first gained autonomous status in a 1970 agreement with the Iraqi government, and its status was re-confirmed as an autonomous entity within the federal Iraqi republic in 2005.  There is a province by the name Kurdistan in Iran; it is not self-ruled. Kurds fighting in the Syrian Civil War were able to take control of large sections of northeast Syria as forces loyal to al-Assad withdrew to fight elsewhere. Having established their own government, some Kurds called for autonomy in a democratic Syria; others hoped to establish an independent Kurdistan.

We'll have new technology but most things one would deem important will stay the same. We will marry, have children and die eventually.  We will go to work and be stuck in traffic on the way. We may turn the autopilot on and waste some time with new electronic gadgets.  In the News there will be some extremists blowing up shit because their jobs was taken over by robots.  I figure we will eventually have to do something about the working class no longer needing to be the working class, at least partly by 2060. By that time the average joe will have seen that automation as moved far enough to make it impossible to employ every person able to work and so we'll have to do something about it.  We might be having a basic income for everyone or attempt to put wages down without damaging the economic abilities of millions somehow. Someone who is too poor to buy the newest Iphone won't be buying the newest iphone or indeed any product at all.  Whatever we end up having it won't feel all that revolutionary when the time comes."
FutureWhatIf,36s1gh,Madenmann,9,Thu May 21 20:14:32 2015 UTC,"While traffic might be an issue, especially as populations grow and cities become even more crowded, I think the networking and self driving abilities of the cars of the future could go a long way towards reducing a lot of the human causes of traffic jams.  And I think it will really be the networking/communicating between cars that will be the biggest factor.  Self driving cars are all well and good, but to make the best use of them they need to be connected to each other and to ""the internet of the road"" so to speak.  Real time data analysis of traffic patterns, congestion, etc will be vital.  Right now traffic and driving are not very organized, and this is the biggest factor in congestion.  Right now every car and driver out there is basically operating independently and only looking out for their own self interests. One driver making a poor decision in terms of the interests of the whole can have a rather big ripple effect, causing issues for other drivers which in turn affects even more.  The ""accordian effect"" is probably the best known and most familiar example of such issues.  Self driving cars that operate independently of one another are still susceptible to such problems, but if they can communicate and work together, you can largely reduce or in some cases, eliminate the issue.  Now, while I have zero doubt the technology for such things will exist and be viable in 2060, the biggest hurdle may simply be whether people are willing to adopt such technology and relinquish the driving experience.  Driving has just become such an ingrained cultural experience in many places that I forsee a lot or resistance to completely handing the keys over to computers to do all the driving.  And allowing human driven cars into the system would quite possibly be a massive challenge.  And to make the absolute best use of networked self driving cars, one would ideally want to start over with a blank slate when it comes to the rules of the road, instead of designing it to fit into the current system.  Unfortunately, that's not really an option - at least near term - since even if you set a date for the eventual removal of all human driven cars, there will be a transition period from human driven to computer driven cars.    I imagine that when the time comes, human driven cars will come at a premium cost, which may lower the number of human drivers.  You might have much higher insurance rates, and perhaps even taxes and fees and licensing restrictions to further encourage the public to switch over.  And I believe it will be later than 2060 when cars without the ability to be driven manually become the standard.    I also imagine that it all will happen somewhat slowly, and introduced in stages.  Areas with high congestion and lower speeds such as found in many major cities may be the first to implement them.  And even then it'd be a mix for awhile, although I could potentially see certain designated areas becoming computer driven cars only  There could be some other interesting effects as well of self driving cars in the future.  Once the technology has matured and become common, car prices in general might drop, perhaps significantly.  After all, if you remove the human in the driver seat, and have cars following rather tight rules and whatnot, performance becomes less of a selling point.  There's no need for a car that can do 0-60 in less than 3 seconds if the computer and rules of the networked road don't allow it.  Same goes for other perormance factors.  So companies could focus more on comfort.  Not needing a driver opens up more flexibility in terms of seating arrangements and configuration, which could have the effect of further driving down prices as car makers can have more flexibility in terms of designing the car and things like safety (using electric motors will also help in this regard, as you now don't have to worry about that big old engine, gearbox, etc dictating car configurations as you can have a bit more flexibility with electric motors).  So now that costs have gone down, you might see more people being able to afford cars.  On the flip side however, if cars begin to be seen more as purely utilitarian, they might be looked upon more like mass transit in a sense.  Perhaps the existing paradigm in regards to taxis and rental cars will be flipped on their heads.  It might be cheaper and much more practical for people to just ""rent"" a car for a few hours or even just minutes at a time.  With networking and traffic analysis, you can have a better idea of transit time than we currently do, and could almost be more like train schedules in that regard. Companies will be able to better see when and how much demand exists at any given time and place, or for various routes, etc.  Perhaps you'll see companies having cars run specific routes at specific times like a bus, perhaps with the option of paying a little fee to be taken directly to your destination.  Anyway, obviously I'm just kind of spit balling here, but it will be very interesting to see how traffic and travel evolves over the next 50 years, especially since there are likely countless factors I can't even begin to imagine."

Recreationally, perhaps, but people will be very happy to let the computer do the work if it's work. The rich and famous often have drivers. It's reasonable to assume that other people would also delegate the driving to a robot if their financial situation permits it.  In addition, the rising demand for urban space will simply make parking space prohibitively expensive, so a car that can be sent away to park somewhere cheaper or can rejoin the fleet of public taxis, will become cost-effective."
FutureWhatIf,36s1gh,silverionmox,1 point,Fri May 22 08:55:44 2015 UTC,I think the likely solution is a hybrid: networked transportation in congested urban areas and self-driving in rural or remote areas.   Networked transportation in cities because ultimately everyone would rather have their own car than take the bus and networked auto-driving preserves this option. Self-driving in the wilderness because driving is fun. Plenty of people shoot guns and enjoy hunting even though they probably haven't needed to hunt in maybe one hundred years. I expect driving will be no different.

It just seems ""meaner"" (and more work for you) to report rather than to explain, and without an explanation it leaves the poster potentially baffled as to what went wrong. And heck, I can be wrong about calling shenanigans, and would love to see corrections to such comments when I make them. It's not about ""winning"", it's about getting interesting discussions going.  I'm thinking perhaps ""discussion of why something is implausible and what might need to be changed to make it more plausible"" could easily fit into the new rule 3, which directs us to ""take liberties"" when answering the question. Maybe adding an explicit allowance for that sort of discussion might help?  Edit: Changed ""impossible"" to ""implausible"" to be less dogmatic."
FutureWhatIf,36pczw,FaceDeer,10,Thu May 21 20:34:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know if i've missed discussion on this or not, but one suggestion: a rule against people discarding the whatif as impossibility.  often i'll click on a thread because i'm interested and one of the top comments will be someone saying that it couldn't ever happen and explaining why.  I understand that there are situations that would be very unlikely, but I would still like to see whatifs about them!  other than that suggestion, seemsl ike a good set of rules!"
FutureWhatIf,36pczw,D__,10,Thu May 21 05:00:22 2015 UTC,"The problem is that those sorts of comments are usually there to point out a violation of rule 1. Some scenarios really are just plain impossible and a serious discussion of their implications can't be done. But the comments pointing that out are still quite worthwhile, IMO, for a couple reasons:   The reasons why they're impossible can be interesting and educational in their own right.  Modifications can be suggested to change the scenario to be more realistic while still retaining some of the what-if's basic intent. It's nicer than just clicking the ""report"" link.   There's also subreddits like /r/hypotheticalsituation for the ""just plain impossible"" stuff that doesn't fit so well in a serious discussion here on /r/futurewhatif."
FutureWhatIf,36pczw,bagelman,3,Thu May 21 07:30:05 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with this. It's often more interesting why a particular scenario is impossible, rather than what would happen if it were to actually occur. I wouldn't want comments getting shut down because they happen to discuss the background of a particular initial scenario."
FutureWhatIf,36pczw,FaceDeer,1 point,Thu May 21 17:56:04 2015 UTC,"The problem is that those sorts of comments are usually there to point out a violation of rule 1.   This seems to be the only legitimate reason to justify against banning the comments. However, I think the commenter needs to make it more clear that ""I believe this is a violation of Rule 1 because.."" instead ""I think that this scenario is implausible because..."".   I say this because many of these comments seem to be ""Stop having fun guys, I have a very narrow view of what is plausible and little imagination"" or ""You peasants aren't as smart as me, I know that this scenario is impossible because I got an A- in current events class!"".   If the scenario is judged as passing Rule 1, than these sorts of comments should be activity discouraged unless they at least have some educational value or valid argument."
FutureWhatIf,36pczw,bagelman,2,Thu May 21 19:55:23 2015 UTC,"Personally, starting a comment with ""This is a violation of the first rule of this subreddit"" seems a lot more like saying ""stop having fun"" than simply pointing out the issues with the scenario. I hate getting legalistic about these sorts of things, I'd much rather have a conversation."
FutureWhatIf,36pczw,fallenpollen,1 point,Thu May 21 20:16:10 2015 UTC,"I was trying to differentiate between ""This isn't the kind of content we want here"" and ""This isn't the kind of content I want here"".  The former is preferable, and can be restricted to only apply to the craziest scenarios, while the latter is often used when the commenter personally disagrees with an idea because of their viewpoint or nationality or something we don't care about."
FutureWhatIf,36pczw,FaceDeer,3,Thu May 21 21:23:43 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I come to this sub for logical, thought provoking plausible scenarios. In my opinion, questions like ""what if everybody woke up tomorrow without the ability to walk"" belong to /r/WritingPrompts rather than here, since they depend heavily on imagination and fictional writing ability rather than logical reasoning and a fact-based approach."
FutureWhatIf,36pczw,HaydenHank,3,Thu May 21 07:25:31 2015 UTC,"A question like that might be capable of fitting better into this sub with some minor modification, such as ""what if a disease similar to polio but much more contagious was running rampant that caused permanent paralysis of the legs."" It's actually not too unreasonable a disease, I could imagine it having something to do with only damaging spinal neurons of a certain length. Or maybe it disables the ability to walk by permanently nuking a person's sense of balance.  So if someone posted a question like that I'd like to answer it with a comment along those lines rather than just report it as violating sub rules."

FutureWhatIf,36i9c6,bran_dong,1 point,Tue May 19 19:45:37 2015 UTC,Thomas Malthus was wrong as well.
FutureWhatIf,36i9c6,amaxen,6,Tue May 19 20:13:24 2015 UTC,"Malthus was only wrong because we had several revolutions in agriculture just when humanity needed them. We were damn lucky!  In OP's scenario unless world birth rates stabilise at or just below replacement levels (which there is some hope they will - eventually) then we'd be again at risk of Makthusian catastrophe.   Particularly because so much of modern agriculture - from farm equipment to nitrogen fertilisers to transport - all depends heavily on oil. Whether that runs out in a few decades or centuries we'd be in deep shit. Additionally soil exhaustion and desertification could likely even reduce the total available farmland, causing famine to hit even earlier. Conflict over diminishing oil resources would hasten it even more.   It's not all bleak though - even stuck using current tech for millennia with sufficient willpower we could do quite a lot. We've got enough in terms of fissionables to keep going easily that long with breeder reactors and we could build a lot more - fortunately we have far safer designs available that generate less waste than most currently operating decades-old reactors are. Renewables would also play an important role. With enough power capacity we know how to do a lot - synthesise a lot of things agriculture and manufacturing require once oil runs low for example.   Standards of living might look strange to us in the here and now. Less air travel. More electric trains. Life would hopefully still be comfortable but by necessity much less wasteful. Chances are things would be built to last and/or be easily recycled - rather than assuming obsolescence in just a few short years. Economic growth would likely be slower too - new value can still be created in intangibles (software, music, books etc) and efficiencies/refinements made to existing techs, as well as adjustments to the 'no new tech' reality ... however we'd lose the huge value that new technology adds to the world economy. Growth would be slow if at all.  The above assumes the world comes together and tackles the adjustment in an organised way. Less optimistically - there's the potential for nastier stuff. One child policies enforced. Resource wars. Well off areas developing a fortress mentality ... or perhaps even giving depopulation in the poor areas a 'helpful nudge'. Potential for societal breakdown in large areas.   Most likely knowing human history we'd get some of the best case and some of the worst."
FutureWhatIf,36i9c6,Maginotbluestars,2,Tue May 19 20:41:57 2015 UTC,"You are a neo-Malthusian, and you are wrong.  It wasn't luck.  The only shortage humanity faces is of people.   If you're like most neo-Malthusians you've never been exposed to the opposing arguments for why neo-Malthusianism consistently fails.  You attribute technological change to exogenous factors (i.e. 'luck', or 'it just happened to fall right here').   I'd recommend you do some research on the Simon-Ehrlich wager, and why Ehrlich lost and Simon won:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon%E2%80%93Ehrlich_wager http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/01/13/but-why-did-julian-simon-win-the-paul-ehrlich-bet/"
FutureWhatIf,36i9c6,amaxen,4,Tue May 19 20:55:42 2015 UTC,However in a world of technological stasis - which is OP's scenario - Simon would have lost his bet. From your second article:   This is what Simon was talking about: that technology would advance and new stocks of materials would be exploitable. This would happen faster than demand would leading to falls in prices
FutureWhatIf,36i9c6,Maginotbluestars,1 point,Tue May 19 21:08:30 2015 UTC,"It depends - there were five total metals involved in the bet.  Some of those dropped in price due to tech change - the article I link later doesn't even mention the invention of substitutes like PVC pipe and fiberoptic cable for copper but does mention techniques that made 'ore out of dirt'.   But others were due to non-tech factors e.g. the collapse of the tin cartel.  Or new extraction techniques e.g. magnesium sea nodule recovery - (is this tech? I'm not sure if this is tech or not....)  Or more resources thrown at finding new sources of materials even at the same level of tech  - again 'tech' becomes very slippery around here.  Tech isn't like video games present with clear tech trees and defined boundaries.   However, in a market economy, even if we assumed that continuous technological change that was instituted with the IndRev were halted, there still would be resources put into discovering new sources of the material or substitutes -- and here the line between 'finding a substitute' and 'tech change' becomes pretty fuzzy indeed."
FutureWhatIf,36i9c6,amaxen,2,Tue May 19 21:18:58 2015 UTC,"In OP's scenario unless world birth rates stabilise at or just below replacement levels (which there is some hope they will - eventually) then we'd be again at risk of Makthusian catastrophe.   Birth rates always stabilize because individuals and families wind up planning their reproduction according to their resources or their excess children just die off individually.  The only way a catastrophic population collapse could happen because of food shortages would be if the shortage struck in an extremely swift period. E.G., sudden extreme drought deprives billions of crops they need to live, or some genetically engineered superpest is unleashed on our grains, or cobalt bombs are used to render farmland useless.  It can't happen otherwise is because you never even get to the point of excess children in the face of declining food shares. If it were true food supplies were relatively fixed, then potential parents either decline to have kids, or they have kids who end up dying of malnutrition and related diseases. It really won't happen that population can dramatically outstrip the food supply because people will starve to death first."
FutureWhatIf,36i9c6,Sarlax,5,Tue May 19 22:13:48 2015 UTC,"Assuming resources never run out and no new, more efficient renewable tech is ever adapted, and the current problems with adapting it aren't overcome?   I imagine we'd probably adapt non-thorium nuclear technology as an energy source since we'd never run out of uranium, while developing countries start flooding the shit out of the earth with even more co2.  Heck maybe people wouldn't adapt and we'd just flood the planet with co2 infinitely since we'd never ever run out of fossil fuels. Course even if we did run out we'd still probably poison the planet if we're taking the route of no technological advancement.  A lot of this also depends on if we're made directly aware of it or if we can still try to advance technologically. I imagine once we learn of this their will be some major 'moral' effects... Our world is very much entrenched in a constant stream of technological adaptations, discoveries, and advancement. If we couldn't do that it would ruin a lot of dreams. Designing new technology to solve problems that arise is a large part of cognitive problem solving. If people couldn't solve new problems no matter how hard they tried... I imagine it's all a sense of scale and exactly what you define as ""technological advancement.""  If we don't have resources to worry about and the immediate implications of infinite resources are somehow solved (climate change, recycling the massive amount of trash a large population produces, etc.) and we aren't all wiped out due to lack of medical advances against increasingly dangerous viruses/bacteria and whatnot...  I don't know the cultural and political effects. After all this stuff I imagine the culture and political landscape will both have been altered quite a bit. Ideally, the world will probably reach some kind of equilibrium once all the developing countries reach the technological level of first world nations, and without having to worry about resources running out I imagine there won't be a lot of tension between the nations at first.  I don't really think politics would change the rise of developing countries, and wealth. Or atleast I don't see why it would cause issues, maybe culturally. You said that humanity as a whole ran out of technological advancement, there's nothing preventing countries acquiring tech we already have.   As for money, if we can still create the technology we have an use it, I don't see any major distribution problems arising if we have infinite/not running out resources. The world would largely continue along it's path of developing nations from what I can tell, I don't see a reason why not.   Culturally, well, I don't know. It really depends on if the cultural changes a lot of first world countries are going through are based on ADVANCING technology or just a natural, generational change we see due to the rich, educated environment we've created (enabled by already existing tech.)  If so, I imagine the forecasts told by the UN of a growing and then stabilising population in the future aren't that far off. Countries will boom as they develop, then kindof stabilise as they are educated and modernized. Eventually, as I said before, culture will probably enter a kind of equilibrium.  This is ofcourse all assuming that we don't run out of resources, we don't have massive climate change (especially as the result of infinite resources) don't have a break of security as developing nations gain higher technology and start nuclear wars and stuff, don't all die due to lacking the ability to fight off disease and other things, somehow manage to maintain world peace in the face of inevitable stagnation, and somehow figure out how to manage our resource output without technology to manage it's effects on our general environment (launching it into space? we would have the resources... obviously.)"

We would probably make much more effort to have a smart grid to shift power around where it is needed.   Energy companies are already adapting to this need. They would provide infrastructure (power lines, storage capbilities, etc....) and get money from the distribution of energy.   One way I have seen energy companies adapting is by ""leasing"" PV systems to consumers.

What they need to do is start trying to get this into a spray on application. Then we might have something here. But this current effort is a cool first application, if nothing else just to get the research started."
FutureWhatIf,36hub2,darwinn_69,2,Wed May 20 17:27:47 2015 UTC,"70kwh per square metre per year   The average American household uses 10,908 per year. That's about 156 sq. meters, or 1670 square feet. A normal neighborhood street is about 29 feet wide (for two lanes and parked cars on either side). That means to generate enough electricity for the average home, you need a solar road of at least 58 feet in length. I can't get good numbers for the average width of a house plot, but using Google maps on a few of the recent locations at which I lived, the average width is somewhere between 40 and 60 feet. So one house uses roughly one house width's worth of road.  Not bad, although since houses are usually across from other houses, two'd have to share the same stretch of road. And car parking might produce a reduction of something like 20%. Not terrible.  If normal roads were completely and instantly replaced with solar, it would make a major dent."
FutureWhatIf,36hub2,Sarlax,0,Tue May 19 22:35:03 2015 UTC,"I see your question is 3 part - solar roads, solar in new building construction, and solar parking lots.  I'll address the solar roads, since it's a subject I've put much thought into.  The current approach, of actually installing individual panels, isn't going to get far. What's much more likely is we'll find a replacement or supplement for asphalt that is solar conductive. We've already got paint-on solar panels, it's not much of a stretch from there to solar roads.  As for what material could do this, I'm not sure it could be done affordably or effectively or reliably without using nanites. Those could theoretically repair the road and keep it in perfect condition while acting as power and data conduits. No more road maintenance, and free power. In a situation like this, every place that has a road has access to the grid, and any place that doesn't have a road can have a new road installed by driving over the desired path with a nanite sprayer."

The US forces would be smart, the first thing they would do with their Iraqi and other ISAF counterparts would be to secure all foreign nationals in Iraq (embassy workers) and to fall back to the air port. This is the most logical defense strategy there is.  Why you ask? Air lifts. People can be flown out and there is still a place for reinforcements to be brought in, this is quite obvious. But, say just somehow, the US forces in Baghdad manage to get over run by ISIS, It would be a near pearl harbor military disaster.   US military would throw A LOT of force at ISIS including a full out invasion of ISIS controlled territory. While understandable for the large military loss at the begging, the invasion would be somewhat unpopular at home as it's another war in a region the US has been in going on 30 years.

Iran already has 'observers' and 'instructors' in Iraq, plus airstrike operations against ISIL in a show of unprecedented co-operation between a Sunni and a Shi'ite nation.  Invasion is completely unnecessary, but somehow happens anyway.  Saudi Arabia is very uncomfortable about this.  Their population follows the Islamic ideal of zakat - a form of obligatory alms-giving - and this money is often flowing directly into ISIL.  Due to religious and cultural differences, they do not want to see the influence of Iran expanding further.  Saudi Arabia sees Iraq as a Sunni 'buffer' between it and those dangerous Shi'ite heretics.  If Iraq (or specifically Northern Iraq) ever fell to Iran, then it's conceivable that the Shi'ite Syria and Iran could link up, dramatically threatening Saudi Arabia's oil lines north into Turkey and Europe.  The situation is akin to Poland invading Ukraine to take out the separatists.  Russia would not take that lying down.  So into this giant keg of dry powder, comes Iran wielding a torch.  Armed forces storm into Iraq and make for Mosul, declaring that they are only there to end ISIL.  The world enters panic mode.  Thanks to a defense treaty, the US is now obligated to protect Iraq.  Saudi Arabia begins exerting tremendous pressure to halt the Iranian forces.  Iraqi forces find themselves in the unenviable position of having to fight their former advisers and ISIL at the same time.  The UN demands an immediate withdrawl and stand-down before some fool makes use of nuclear weapons.  Iran maintains they have no nuclear weapons, whereupon Saudi Arabia mentions they do...having recently purchased them from Pakistan.  Iran holds it's troops in place, announces they will begin to pursue nuclear deterrence options, and contacts China and Russia for assistance.  The US is demanding Iran retreat back to their borders and halt all nuclear weapons programs.  Saudi Arabia is demanding Iran retreat, disarm and pay reparations.  Iraq is demanding Iran get out.  Iran is demanding the Saudi's cut off ISIL funding and disarm their nukes.  The UN is demanding a ceasefire in place while observers make their way to the area.  Russia makes several abortive attempts to mediate the dispute.  ISIL nips out and grabs Falluja while everyone is arguing.  This serves to refocus attention back on the original issue.  The UN Security Council meets in Urgent Session for several days straight.  They come up with a limited plan, which is the only one that both Russia and China would sign off on.  Iranian forces will retreat to their borders, stand down their nuclear program and resume limited advisory roles under UN supervision.  Saudi Arabia is to stand down their nuke for inspection by IAEA.  Iraq is to cease hostilities against Iran.  Iran is to pay reparations to Iraq, and Saudi Arabia is to make an effort to reduce ISIL funding.  Iran retreats to their borders, but keeps the nuclear deterrence program running.  Saudi Arabia refuses to stand their nuke down or reduce zakat, since it is 'a citizen's choice'.    The area steps back down from the brink of war.  US-led efforts against ISIL redouble, who have taken the two-week standoff as a perfect opportunity to grab more territory.  Their rockets are now landing in the outskirts of Baghdad."

Likely it will takes decades to make them economically marketable after ITER makes the proof of concept. It will still cost money, but like solar, wind, and to an extent fission nuclear, those will be up front costs rather than fuel sources and its' commodity speculation.  In the long term fusion will replace all known major power production methods. Perhaps rural and remote areas using high efficiency alternative sources to reduce transmission loss. I think that they will still cost money, but the fees will be built into a tax structure that maintains the reactors as a public utility or private contractors for a low cost to citizens. However, it is likely that the next highest costs will be the rare metals/elements that are used to build these reactors, batteries, other storage devices and such. Those are limited resources as well but I'm not savvy enough in materials costs to make a determination.  With the move to electric cars it's likely that fusion will 'put the nail in the coffin' of petrol engines with what is likely to be a vast increase in available electricity. The only outliers will be the internal combustion enthusiasts and possibly the airline industry. However, I can imagine batteries becoming efficient enough that airlines switch to electric fleets. Although I'd see them being some of the last to innovate.  The production of vast electricity will likely also vastly increase demand. New uses for power we consider inefficient or impractical now might become commonplace enough that it strains the new fusion power age."

The hunter gets interviewed by 60 Minutes, National Geographic, etc. – which kind of backfires because he turns out to be a real rambling eccentric, making this one of the most surreal news stories of all time. Everyone is asking themselves “how the hell did a ten foot hominin stay hidden in America for so long?” Not only is everyone who ever claimed to see Bigfoot shouting “I FUCKING TOLD YOU SO!” now UFO fanatics, conspiracy theorists, and all kinds of cryptid believers are feeling totally vindicated – and who can blame them?

FutureWhatIf,362xo5,Leaftail,22,Fri May 15 17:28:38 2015 UTC,"A single impactor large enough to create an ocean would have to be about 169 km in radius (larger if it contains more than water), almost a tenth the width of the Moon, assuming it's big enough to recreate the ocean Mars (probably) had about 4 billion years ago. Anything that big would produce a catastrophically large impact and probably kick all kinds of crazy shit into space, possibly creating major hazards for Earth.  I imagine it would take years for Mars's surface to calm down, and at the end, the water might just freeze up before going back to the same process that killed off the original Martian ocean (which could take thousands or millions of years). Ejected dirt and water might form a temporary ring system around Mars.  In the mean time, it'd be extremely interesting to study Mars. It could give us tremendous insight into planet formation, since huge impacts like that (although probably not with supermassive snowballs) were common in the early days of the Solar System. We'd also probably get to open up major subsurface areas of Mars at the impact site.  It would probably slow colonization. The impact would kick up a ton of crap and make the surface and sky chaotic for a long time."
FutureWhatIf,362xo5,Sarlax,7,Fri May 15 19:13:25 2015 UTC,"Short answer: no and no.  Sarlax covers the ocean formation bit well.  The problem is that Mars just doesn't have enough gravity to hold much of an atmosphere, it doesn't have a magnetic field to protect against the solar wind, and all that adds up to a nuclear winter from the impact followed by the water sublimating away fairly quickly.  No liquid ocean, and still no atmosphere worth talking about.  It'd be an amazing thing for science, we'd learn a crapton and a half about all sorts of fascinating things.  But it wouldn't lead to colonization of Mars any quicker.  And, really, Mars in that kind of weird place for colonizing anyway.  Any real colony would have to be underground in a completely artificial environment.  You'd get the inconveniences of an atmosphere (dust storms, difficulty in using rockets) with none of the advantages Earth's thick atmosphere provides (protection from radiation, thick enough for relatively easy flight, etc).   I'd rather colonize the moon, or Ganymede, or even Titan than colonize Mars.  The 1950's fever dream of terraforming Mars is about as practical as the 1950's vision of food pills or weather control.  Absent some superscience gravity manipulation Mars will never have an atmosphere thick enough to breathe without assistance.  You could spend trillions over centuries and Mars would still be too cold to live on with an atmosphere to thin to breathe.  Better to spend that time and money building habitats under the surface of the moon or Ganymede or elsewhere."
FutureWhatIf,362xo5,sotonohito,5,Fri May 15 20:34:51 2015 UTC,"Is terraforming Mars really such a fantasy? Sure, it’s way beyond our present day abilities and would be a multi-generational project, but it's technically feasible. We could create an artificial magnetosphere by burying massive superconducting magnetic coils around the latitude lines, thus shielding the planet from the solar winds and making it possible to then establish a lasting atmosphere. We could then thicken the Martian atmosphere to at least 500 millibars, which – depending on the final atmospheric composition – would be sufficient for a human-viable surface at “sea level.” One scenario is to pump the atmosphere with enough carbon dioxide that it’ll be warm enough for people to walk around in shirtsleeves and filtration facemasks. Tharsis and the supervolcanoes will always poke above the thin atmosphere, but that still leaves you with quite a bit of Martian real estate."

I think most motivations have simpler, cheaper answers. Once we have the technological to actually possible to terraform Mars, we'll probably be able to pursue our goals in a much more practical way."
FutureWhatIf,362xo5,Sarlax,6,Fri May 15 21:25:49 2015 UTC,"There are many reasons to terraform Mars. Ranging from the lofty idealistic ideas like taking it upon ourselves to spread biological life across the cosmos, to the more practical like creating a backup planet in case something apocalyptic happens to Earth. If our objectives in space are purely scientific or economic your going to get a much sparser type of settlement – subsurface habitats on Ceres to facilitate asteroid mining or an underground colony on Ganymede for harvesting helium3 from the Jovian atmosphere and teleoperating robots in the oceans of Europa, etc. However if the goal is to create a permanent, self-sufficient civilization on another world no ones going to want to live underground forever. Beyond pure science Mars doesn't have much to offer us economically - any metals found on Mars can also be found in the asteroid belt and you don't have to deal with getting them out of Mars' gravity well."
FutureWhatIf,362xo5,VaderVsSauron,3,Fri May 15 21:41:27 2015 UTC,"I think it's a fantasy,  yes.   Given current understanding of physics even with an unlimited budget the result would still be a planet too cold and with an atmosphere too thin to breathe unassisted except in the deep canyons maybe.  Colonizing Mars I can see happening.   Terraforming Mars I can't.  For the cost of turning  tiny sliver of Mars into a place you could survive with only a rebreather and some heavy cold weather clothing you could produce perfect climate controlled living space for billions under the surface.   I think I know which option will be picked  And that's leaving aside all ethical questions."
FutureWhatIf,362xo5,sotonohito,1 point,Sat May 16 03:08:12 2015 UTC,"Personally I would certainly choose the terraforming option. And terraforming Mars up to 500 millibars is well within the laws of physics, and would be atmospherically thick enough for people to breath 5 kilometers above datum, if I remember correctly. Your conflating two different hypothetical scenarios - A) CO2 heavy & oxygen poor atmosphere, which would allow for lush vegetation and insects and maybe some genetically engineered animals, but cities would have to remain domed, but outside the domes it would be warm enough for people to walk around naked if they wanted - just with the carbon filter mask or B) an oxygen and nitrogen heavy atmosphere, which would be more like Siberia, in which heavy coats are required but no rebreather necessary. I think most people who chose either option over living indoors/underground forever. Point being if there's ever a time in history were millions of people are living on Mars - for whatever reason they come to find themselves there - I think they'll eventually initiate some version of terraforming on their own."

This might prompt NASA to send out probes to move more ice asteroids into similar orbits, drenching the atmosphere."

Effectively, the race for the 2016 is anyone's to win -- which is why Bernie Sanders, who (despite his many virtues) is currently doing pretty well, considering how unlikely the idea would have seemed in the past.  That said, one of the biggest criticisms of Fiorina and Carson is that they've never held elected office, which is why their political aspirations seem more like an attempt to raise their profile for future speaking tours and book deals than any real attempt at entering the political arena. For someone like Colbert to win, he'd need to counteract that as an inevitable criticism, and the only way to do that is to go for a lesser political office -- Senator or Congressman. A couple of years of that, where he could make his name as someone who actually tries to do the 'right thing', rather than the politically-motivated thing (which, as a political outsider, would be his biggest selling point, however true it was), and he'd be in a good position to step up for the next election cycle.

There is some peace in the Korean peninsula as the influx of cash from the mercenaries helps stabilize the North Korean regime. The DMZ becomes quiet.

In the more right-wing provinces (Sask and Alberta, among others), support grows for a secession from Canada and either union with the USA or independence. In 2017, the Canadian PM agrees to let Alberta hold a referendum on leaving Canada and either gaining independence or joining the USA; a 60%+ majority of Albertans vote to secede. The result is a British Columbia that is geographically isolated from the rest of Canada and in effect is forced to seek its independence as it is effectively an exclave (especially if Yukon, NT, and Nunavut join Alberta because of their similar resource-based economies).

But then I am not sure if even that is legal, either.  Good question, OP!"
FutureWhatIf,35su5v,Huntred,4,Wed May 13 12:42:23 2015 UTC,"If this happened in such a way as to flip an election, there's probably nothing that can be done for it. Suppose it means Jeb Bush, who was leading and get 52% of the popular vote, loses to Hillary Clinton, because red counties in Florida weren't able to vote, but the blue counties were.  There's no specific contingency for federal elections. This article gives a good overview of the issues. For a storm, there should be at least some time for Congress to reschedule elections - at least 48 hours notice for a big storm. But realistically? Congress won't act- they're all going to be gone campaigning. So when the storm hits, the law as written stands.  Congress controls the date of federal elections according to Articles I and II, so they govern their own elections and that of the President (through the electoral college). The first Tuesday after the first Monday in November was chosen for both for convenience. States don't have to follow this rule for their own local elections, but most states try to line things up. There's no emergency plan for Election Day disasters. Whenever it's suggested, there are accusations of attempted vote-rigging, disenfranchisement, etc.  So back to the hypo: Jeb Bush loses. The Congress, which will be Republican, might try to pass an emergency law altering the selection date of electors, so that the states can have another election during good weather to pick their electors. Obama might choose to veto such a law. Even if he doesn't, Clinton might sue, arguing both that it's unconstitutional for being ex post facto (a law with retroactive consequences) and for violating the equal protection clause (ironically citing Bush v. Gore, arguing that it deprives other voters of the equal weight of their votes, since this emergency law is really aimed at giving another chance to Floridians only).  If it went to the Supreme Court, I'm fairly sure the Court would rule in such a way that it doesn't alter the outcome of the election-day results; it's just too political for them.  President Clinton 2 might eventually call for Election Day reforms, such as creating a national election week or requiring that month-long mail voting be allowed in all states, but it's unlikely, since criticizing the current election day system implies her own presidency is invalid."

Possibly an exit from the EU or a closing of the borders in some other fashion.  The Swedish welfare state is already lacking in many regards, education is free but dropping in quality, the healthcare system is under a huge strain, and the defence budget is gutted. The general opinion among the media and the population is increasingly negative towards the immigration policy as there is only one serious contender for power that openly opposes mass immigration and they are frequently ignored or isolated by the other parties on the basis of their stance on immigration and their roots in the white supremacy movement. It is seen as an unwillingness to face reality or anti-democratic to not consider the views of the far right even when it's one of the largest parties in the country.

Most are what you'd think Christians should be, understandably suspicious but willing to give aliens the benefit of the doubt and probably asking themselves how to save them (missionary-save, not evacuation-save). Some are going to be isolationist, believing that any Aliens aren't to be trusted (you'll see Evolutionary skeptics pop up here probably, they'll say the aliens are demons/faked by the devil to make evolution seem real) and shouldn't be helped or saved. Between these two you'll have people who believe Aliens-are-Demons-but-Should-be-Saved, or Aliens-can't-be-saved-but-should-be-helped (do aliens have souls to save, did an alien messiah visit them?). Then you'll find anti-alien sects whom say aliens are demons, and want to make holy war on them; then aliens are angels are probably last, these naive optimists band together in order to be heard, trying to protect themselves from Aliens-are-gods (different from angels) and aliens-are-demons crowds.   While you may think the isolationists come from mostly Right-Wing Christians in the USA, there are likely to be some in the EU, probably Euro-skeptic parties (EU voters who hate the EU don't seem to be likely candidates for open-arms immigration from extraterrestrials). In Canada the split will be fairly pronounced, but it may split parties down lines that no one had seen before; not only the Big 3 federal parties but the Bloc will probably see itself split into 2 parties, one lead by tentatively pro-aliens and one lead by tentatively anti-aliens (politicians will be so cautious you could use them as mine detectors against alien aggression on a physical minefield). I'm thinking Australia and NZ think similarly.   Islam will see the biggest split of pro- and anti- (or at least the highest correlation) between those whom live in developed countries and those who live in developing countries. Pro-alien Muslims will tend to reside in developed countries, or lead modern internet-enabled lifestyles; I think anti-alien positions will rise in developing countries and be seen less in developed countries. How Sunni-Shia politics will influence the decision is hard to say, would one side take a pro or anti position and the other take its opposite reflexively (from individuals building momentum developing the equilibrium or an official response?).   I don't expect a big push from Judaism to do any conversions of the Aliens, leading to people wondering why from other religions. I can't really guess anymore stuff for other religions, Hinduism or Buddhism.   I'm an Absurdist, so I'm just wondering if we have proof of aliens is it mutual? Just because we know of them do they know of us yet? Such a long way, wonder if they're still there, or did something wipe them out?   If they know about us, was it before or after we found out about them? I have to admit, if they got the jump on us we might as well put up a token effort of preparing defences simply because there is no real way to tell if they've noticed by our first proof of them existing. However if into this period of build-up we see them noticing us (it'll still be kinda outdated) at the point where we noticed them I am totally willing to chance it by contacting them and declaring our coincidence of noticing one another to be divinely inspired. I mean, there's luck and then there is political opportunities for the future to look back and smile too (gotta make your own luck, God helps those whom help themselves, etc).   If we find out they noticed us first we can't trust a stated peaceful intent as much as we think we want to. We have to be able to step in and extend to them help too, so if we are friends they can be glad they're not friends with some weak primates.   If we noticed them first we can't contact them first. We'd have to watch them to study any current tech, how they've come to get there (The best way in my mind to test this is comparing Moores Law on the estimated time for microchip development) and how fast they're going to go. Will their computers likely surpass us in some way quickly? Will we run out of foreseeable technological advances to continue following the law ... at the same time (more miracles, someone get ICP)? If we're farther ahead then them and faster at developing them I think it's places pressure on us to contact them while we have this advantage. Yes this ignores the nuance of their software development, but that could also be considered to be pressure to contact or stay silent on its own (as an overlapping issue).   If our hardware is less than theirs we should stay silent. Anyways I'm rambling and you said major religions."

He’s showing off his new telescope to some friends when one remarks that his imaging program is a little wonky.  Sure enough, faint rogue lines are visible near the Eastern Mare Frigoris.  Despite debugging the software until 3am, the lines won’t go away.  The astronomer posts to an enthusiast’s board, asking if anyone else is having the problem.  When he wakes up a few hours later, there are a couple of replies.  Other people are seeing faint lines in the same area, but can’t replicate the issue in other areas.  One wag ironically suggests “Aliens!” – that’s his default response to any technical questions.  NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter is mapping the surface when image-correcting software throws up an error.  There are extra straight lines appearing on photos, indicating a possible camera issue.     A support ticket is immediately thrown to the imaging crew, but their puzzled reply a few hours later is that it’s not software – the camera is functioning perfectly, the program is working well – whatever the lines are, they are at the source – the surface of the Moon.  The Director of Lunar Missions is immediately informed.  This could be tracks from rovers or a rogue mission ahead of the X-Prize launches.  China, Russia, India and Japan are contacted.  China reports that it’s Chang’e-1 Orbiter has also spotted the lines.  A data-sharing arrangement for a single pass is formed, and the LRO and Chang’e-1 adjust orbits for a flyby.  The results are startling.  Blocklike structures, with sharp angled lines are visible.  There’s some fuzzing at the edge of the pictures, but the center – and the shapes are clearly visible.  The LRO is retasked to re-map the dark side of the moon, while China agrees to retask Chang’e-1 to re-map the near side.  The results of the first pass are done in three hours.  Following the feed, the control center is put in lockdown, and feeds for lunar science missions are placed into indefinite hold.  Two hours later, a harried Director is on the phone to the White House.  In China, the Communist Party is being informed of the American’s discovery.  Per a data-sharing agreement, the Roscosmos Agency is being informed as well.  Three days pass.  The lines are now covering more of the Mare Frigoris, and more amateur astronomers are pointing it out.  The lines are hot topics online, and the first news agencies are beginning to pick up on the story.  The President has been in deep, involved talks with China, Russia, the UK, India and Japan.  Per negotiated agreement, the President calls a session of the UN, and goes before it to announce the presence of the Lines, and to lay out a plan that has been worked up.  First, more information is needed.  The Chinese Premier has agreed to fast-track the launch of Chang’e-4, and Russia is similarly accelerating development on its Luna-Glob 1 probe.  The US will be re-purposing an NSA satellite that was nearing completion to make a fast-flyby of the Moon.  International reaction is mixed.  The news is alarming, and the possibility of an extra-terrestrial intelligence being as close as the Moon is deeply concerning.  Some countries criticize the US for not noticing sooner.  Others are cautious, but satisfied that something is being done.  International news reports latch on to the story full-time.  Analysts examine everything since the Moon Landings to show three points, which are repeated again and again.  First, the moon has no atmosphere, so any colonization is not going to be by creatures like us. Second, failure to spot any construction machinery means the technology is likely nano-tech in scale, and Third, colonization without contact does not necessarily mean hostile intent, but it certainly is very provocative.  A very quiet analysis is carried out on the feasibility of launching nuclear warheads at the Moon.  Most of the simulations come back ‘undetermined’.  With so little information on the possible threat, it’s very hard to tell if this activity would be disrupted by attack – or if it would alert a controlling intelligence to a possible threat.  The big question is – will these Builders come for Earth?  The Juno probe is closing in on Jupiter and its moons, and there are no signs of Lines there, aside from Europa’s ice cracks.  The satellites and rovers at Mars don’t report any lines or building activity.  The aging Cassini hasn’t revealed anything in the Saturn system either.  Five months later, confirmation comes that reflectors at the Apollo 15 landing site are no longer functioning, and a pass by the LRO confirms that the Lines are overtaking the site.  Curiously, the blotch of the Lander itself remains untouched, a circular gap around it.  This touches off intense speculation.  Communication attempts have been being beamed at the Moon, and the Radio Dark Night project has been implemented to scan for any signals coming from the Moon, even on commercial radio frequencies.  Despite some odd backscatter in the lower bands, there’s no coherent signal.  Lunar Watch is the most highly rated news program, streamed over the internet.  The popular opinion being held is that the Moon is being alienformed by nanotech devices – Von Neumann (sefl-replicating) in nature.  This is touted as being the fastest and most efficient way of colonizing the Galaxy.  Astronomical records are being scoured for any sign of the Von Neumann mothercraft entering or passing our system, but there are such huge gaps in coverage that we could have missed an entire fleet of them.  The way the machines seem to actively avoid man-made objects is very, very interesting, meaning the original programmers anticipated alien life, and made their machines avoid it.  As such, it is likely the machines will not progress to Earth.  A Year and a half after the Lines appeared, the Moon now has a structured, blocky look to it when viewed through a telescope.  Air Patrols mounted over deserts and tundra on Earth, plus a concerted effort from Google Satellite mapping has failed to show any signs on Earth of Lines.  The Machines appear not to have come to Earth.  Nevertheless, Humanity is now very curious about their neighbor.  A constant production line of satellites, rovers and drones are being produced and launched.  Ostensibly for scientific research, most have one aim - investigate with an eye to acquiring new technology.  The US, Chinese and Russian probes show a completely alien-formed moon, with roadways, transit lines, hubs, buildings (though none over five stories).  A rover is able to explore a section nicknamed “Coruscant-A1”, after the famous Star Wars city-planet, and sees that while the buildings are rectangular, there are indentations – possibly marking openings - that are octagonal in shape.   A sample-return mission is sent to the Moon.  It returns to Earth Orbit in utmost secrecy, and Chinese taikonauts from the Heavenly Palace space station investigate.  Despite the probe reporting a successful capture of what is believed to be the Von Neumann machines, the container is empty.  Later analysis finds microscopic holes drilled in the rear of the sample box.  The Machines are not amenable to capture.   Four years after the machines have finished building the Lunar City, an asteroid is detected on a collision course.  Its course is closely tracked worldwide.  Minutes before impact, the images of the asteroid becomes fuzzy, and then vanish.  Apparently the Machines are still there.  Plans for a manned mission are quietly scrapped.  There’s too much risk that the Machines might ‘reprocess’ essential suit elements, or worse, the astronauts themselves.  Two years after that, spy-satellite imagery picks up five blocky, needle-like shapes on an open-pad area.  The shapes grow in size slowly, and as spy-rover is being launched to investigate, the five “Needles” rise above the pad, and accelerate away, without any observable propulsion.  Their course is tracked – two are headed for Alpha Centauri, one for Epsilon Erandi, one towards Sirius, and the last towards Barnard’s Star."

After all, why would these machines care for our moon landing sites? They even stop by the tracks, so they see 'living being-made' changes there and the code tells them to stay clear of that.

FutureWhatIf,35jhiv,pryoslice,2,Mon May 11 14:55:06 2015 UTC,"Last I heard, the US military is still under civilian control. Yes, they have a lot of political power, but one of the main reasons is that a large portion of US voters have a huge amount of respect for the military and value US's position as the top military power. There's little popular pressure to reduce the military budget, which is already enormous. Yes, Congressional Republicans would fight to use this as an excuse to cut social program costs, but they'd have little leverage, given that their base would be more concerned with US vulnerability than budget cuts.  I think you also understestimate how much money could be shifted inside the military budget to accomodate this. Nuclear weapons are relatively cheap to produce (all the R&D having been done and nuclear power plants still spitting out the raw materials for them). The military would just have to put some projects on hold, which it has done before, and make it happen. For the cost of one modern aircraft carrier, US could probably become second to only Russia in nuclear arms. I doubt they would fight this too hard - they don't want to lose military jobs and this wouldn't cause that (it would just shift some to other areas).  Even if Congress was unwilling to cut other military programs temporarily, US debt is still extremely cheap and Congress clearly doesn't care that much about incurring more. They could issue a trillion of additional debt to restock the arsenal and people would barely notice. If interest rates on Treasuries rise, it could be a different story."

First, they bring in RFID chips for kids. Some parents will want to do this for the kids' safety... but really it will be for their own peace of mind.  Maybe after a while more parents will see this as some sort of trend, or they will be afraid to be seen as not caring about their children's safety.  At any rate, it's the kids that are the key. Why? Because what will happen is that a new generation will grow up having been chipped without their consent by authority figures (the parents in this case). Twenty years later, this generation will have become adults. They'll think that having a chip is normal. After all, they have them and all their friends have had them since they were little.  All an authority has to do is find more and more reasons, more and more circumstances where chipping someone is justified, or required. As long as they do this gradually, the younger generation will think it's normal. Eventually a tipping point will be reached where people who are opposed to subdermal chips will be seen as weirdos, old-timers, or maybe religious nutjobs.  I think that RFID chips might come with benefits as well as drawbacks. But I also think that there is some massive potential for abuse.

The original confederacy consisted of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, the Carolina's, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia.  If my math is correct, that's a solid third of the population of the United States, including 3 of the largest cities (Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas).  Texas has the second highest GDP in the nation, Florida is number 4, and North Carolina and Georgia are numbers 9 and 10.  I can't quantify exactly, but they also have a LOT of the US oil reserves, and Texas is the largest oil producer in the US.  The US literally could not let that just walk away without a fight, any more than they could the first time. On top of that, the precedent would be... bad.  If 11 states with land borders and strong connections to their neighbors decided to break and succeeded, you can bet anything that Alaska would be not far behind.  There goes even more oil, not to mention the other natural resources.    If the rest were, for some weird ass reason, inclined to let it happen, it would deal a serious blow to the US in terms of both tangible assets and international standing.  US credibility abroad would tank (if you can't even keep your own house in order, people aren't particularly inclined to pay any attention).  Eventually, divergent interests would cause a war, almost without question.

For example, if someone is dosed and told to believe they are blind do they suddenly lose the ability to see? Or does it only work for concepts like inculcating patriotism or religious beliefs.   If they are given the same medication to instill an opposite belief, the new belief wouldn't absorb due to the logical process of the brain.   Does this mean that if someone already has a strong belief this drug won't get rid of it? Like, if a fervent Christian was dosed and told to be an atheist would it not work?"

FutureWhatIf,3580el,ZombineTM,13,Thu May 7 21:38:19 2015 UTC,"Belarus actually seems quite likely, since as far as I know there is a lack of national identity and a very strong pro-russian feeling, as well as a weak economy and lots of poverty that would help Russia expand there, if it were really willing to do so. I would predict this to happen around a year after Lukashenko, their dictator, dies. At present the country seems stable. For Kazakhstan, I don't think this is a real possibility, the economy is growing at an incredible speed, there is little unemployment, a strong national feeling, and a stable and popular government. Perhaps if after Nursultan Nazarbayev dies, and his successor is an idiot, Russia would claim the largely Russian northern third of the country."
FutureWhatIf,3580el,daltonslaw,10,Fri May 8 03:08:00 2015 UTC,"I doubt that Russia would annex Belarus, given Europe's agitation over Crimea.  Its not just some tiny peninsula.  It's an entire country that would put Poland and the Baltic States on high alert.  Brest, Belarus is 2 hours away from Warsaw, Poland.  Given that the Russian military would be right next door, Poland might mobilize its military, causing NATO to watch Russia closely.  Given that we now live in a post-Crimea world and that Russia has flexed its military muscle, I doubt Russia would make a move on Belarus without suffering another round of International Sanctions.  And I agree with you completely on Kazakhstan."

Poland and the Baltics--on the grand scheme of things--are inconsequential to world politics.  But the fact that they are in NATO, should have Russia worried.  If Russia makes any move towards Poland or the Baltic States, then America will get involved, plus with the half a dozen or so other nations in NATO.  And Russia's military--despite Putin's blustering--is nowhere near advanced enough to take on all of Western Europe and America.  While yes, Poland and the Baltics cannot stand up to Russia on their own, they are still part of NATO, meaning that NATO will get involved is Russia makes a move."
FutureWhatIf,3580el,TheCareBear42,1 point,Fri May 8 05:28:42 2015 UTC,"So, they will attack Russia? Because there nothing else they can do. And then they will be not protected by NATO article 5."
FutureWhatIf,3580el,sternee,4,Fri May 8 05:35:12 2015 UTC,"If Russia takes Belarus, Poland and the Baltic States will put their militaries  on high alert and activate NATO article 4 which is:   Article 4 The Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened.   You misunderstand what article 5 is.  It is this:   Article 5 The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.  Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.   It essentially means that an attack against one of the member nations is an attack against all of the member nations.  The ""insurgents"" all have itchy trigger fingers.  Meaning that if anything happens along the Poland/Belarus border, all of NATO will go to war with Russia.  Poland would not have to do anything.  It would require one idiot on the Russian side to do something along the border.  EDIT:  Added another part and fixed the link"
FutureWhatIf,3580el,TheCareBear42,0,Fri May 8 05:56:31 2015 UTC,"You hardly can call border with Russia as threat to Poland. There is already one in Kaliningrad oblast. And there will be no ""insurgents"" in Belarus, because there is already exist documents about Belarus joining with Russia, they just needed to be finished. And NATO will not rush to fight with Russia just to please Poland. You know, nuclear bombs, ICBM and other stuff..."
FutureWhatIf,3580el,sternee,6,Fri May 8 06:20:37 2015 UTC,"When he/she said insurgents, I'm pretty sure he/she was talking about insurgents that would provoke something along with Belarus-Poland border. Russia doesn't need insurgents to take Belarus, but you know that already. But NATO WILL have to defend Poland if something happens to it, and there's proof Russia is involved. Otherwise, NATO's credibility will be destroyed. I doubt NATO would try to start anything since a non-NATO member would have to instigate the attack for Article 5 to activate but if something happens, war is a very likely possibility.  Also, a border with Kaliningrad Oblast is one thing, but a border with a Russian-annexed Belarus makes it much, much easier for Russia's military to march into the EU. The amount of soldiers in Kaliningrad Oblast is pretty small, only 11,000. A direct land border between the EU and Russia allows Russia to not only move several times that amount into the EU, but also establish a stable supply line that doesn't currently exist. With Russia acting the way it is, a border between the EU and Russia could lead to a very tense situation (I don't think the border with Finland counts since Russia can't really antagonize the rest of the EU from up there)."

Poland(and Finland too) - well, easy come, easy go, if Russia can control them - good, if not - so be it.

The hardest thing for me to wrap my head around is how you would simulate peoples personalities and someones ability to motivate and lead an entire population and key players. For example, if we wanted to simulate what raising the minimum wage one of the things we would have to know is how the CEO's of each company are going to react. And you would have to consider everyone who influences that CEO and so on and so on because who knows, maybe your CEO speaks to his barber and the next haircut they get to talking and he has an ah-ha moment...humans are complicated.   This means your simulation would need to either have an entire populations worth of human actors, or AI's who are able to perfectly simulate the personality of every individual on the planet. The first one basically turns your simulation into The Matrix, and the second one gives me an existential crisis if you think about it too long."
