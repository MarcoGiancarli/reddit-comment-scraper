The original gif looks nothing like this and I thought it was funny. But does my opinion matter? I'm not sure. Nonetheless, op shouldn't be downvoted based upon what one thinks op is trying to portray and or not portray.

I just don't like seeing hate in r/trees. I can see hate towards negativity, but hate(downvoting/negative comments) towards a comment such as OP's in this thread, to me, is unnecessary but then again we are talking about internet points so Its kind of like something happening in a dream. While your ""there"" in the dream, it feels as though it all matters. Once out if the dream(off the computer) it doesn't really matter.  On another note I believe we have gotten this down to a science.   Toke on brotha"
