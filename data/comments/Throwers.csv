Throwers,3e54ee,Joshapotamus,5,Wed Jul 22 00:58:40 2015 UTC,I recently acquired an N12 as well. It's my first unresponsive yoyo and it feels amazing. I can't imagine what throwing $100+ yoyo would feel like but I've just ordered a Buddha ripple bearing for my N12. I'm hoping I can notice a difference with the concave/string notch. I hope you love that new throw just as much as I do.
Throwers,3e54ee,TheTerrarian,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:42:44 2015 UTC,I do love it so far! It's a lot smaller than it looked in all the pictures though. I finally got binding down but it's still pretty hard to actually land it on the string. Lol

Throwers,3e54ee,SirCircularCube,2,Wed Jul 22 04:06:07 2015 UTC,I just got mine yesterday and I am really enjoying it. I started recently as well and found that you need to use more string than you think for a good bind. Make your loop bigger before you bind and make sure you pinch the string so the string doesn't roll over your finger. Strong clean throws seem to help for binds as well.
Throwers,3e5ep7,saruman0426,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:23:41 2015 UTC,Just got a few from /u/moby323. They're pretty legit. Almost like a happy medium between Blueprint and Kitty.

Throwers,3e4hrx,Cborne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:13:45 2015 UTC,"That's my plan exactly. I have a few more plastic throws that I want to try like the premiere and diffusion, but I'll probably get a nice metal throw before that."
Throwers,3e4hrx,Cborne,2,Tue Jul 21 22:25:37 2015 UTC,"That's a diverse selection of yoyos, nice.  How does the replay feel vs. the Classic?"
Throwers,3e4hrx,FullThrottleFRS,2,Tue Jul 21 22:29:21 2015 UTC,The stability seems fairly similar but they feel very different in the hand. My finger sits inside the gap on the classic while my finger is over the gap on the replay pro. I prefer the replay because the finish and weight help keep it spinning when I screw up a trick and bump the yoyo. I like and recommend both of them.
Throwers,3e4hrx,complexigon,2,Tue Jul 21 22:36:15 2015 UTC,"I have a classic and I really like it, but I have no other plastics. Might check it out so I can have something that feels different. Thanks!"
Throwers,3e4hrx,oscarian,2,Tue Jul 21 22:38:41 2015 UTC,"You could try lightly sanding the Classic with some 220-400 grit sandpaper, in order to give it a smoother feeling and more grindable surface. I've done it with a couple of my plastic throws and it turns out pretty nice."

Since you want something lighter, I'd lean towards the Premiere.  Is really is one of the best bang for the buck products out right now.  It's fairly like and is kinda more V shaped, and it is fairly floaty(not much rim weight), so it doesn't ""feel as fast"" as the Bench H."

Get the YYF One for the girls and a Classic for the boys. The One will be better for the younger kids' hands. Both of those yoyos have a lot of color options should you want to get each nibling something unique. Both also come with slim C size bearings, so if and when the kids become more proficient and wish to try out unresponsive play then they can seek out a full size C bearings for a quick and easy upgrade - the bearings would be a great future gift idea ;)  Edit: Just checked Amazon and it looks like the Classic is out of stock. I suppose you could get them all a YYF One. Another good option from YYF is the Velocity. If you want to get them an unresponsive throw off the bat then the Whip and OneStar are good options."

Throwers,3e0ky8,zareliman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:07:54 2015 UTC,Often grooves are intended to reduce surface area to decrease friction for things like grinds. The grooves on the rims here seem more for aesthetics and a different feel.

Throwers,3e3jfg,DeerDever,5,Tue Jul 21 18:03:23 2015 UTC,"Your throw is what's causing it to tilt.   Some YoYos are more susceptible too it. The reason you see it more than one or the other may also be because they are different size/shapes, fit in your hand differently, and may cause subtle changes in your release.   Either way, just practice a bit and it will go away.   One thing that helped me to throw straight is to not just let my arm go, I tried to visualize a target on the ground below me me sort of aimed the yoyo at that target.   Kind of the difference between simply throwing a baseball ""forward"" vs throwing a baseball to try and hit a target."
Throwers,3e3jfg,moby323,5,Tue Jul 21 18:15:48 2015 UTC,"I had this problem too, what I did to help was:   Grab the yoyo normally and flex your wrist back as if you were about to throw the yoyo Slowly roll the yoyo off your hand like you would when actually throwing it but don't let go. Make sure it isn't tilted while you're doing this motion and ""perpendicular"" to the ground. Do this a little faster (enough to make it sleep) and let go this time. Does it tilt? Adjust accordingly and keep trying until it's straighter. Work up to throwing normal speed.   For me, I was tilting it before I even threw it all the way and I didn't realize it. Don't know if this'll help, but it worked for me. Also, make sure you don't let the yoyo ""bounce"" when it hits the end of the string by compensating for the motion like they show in tutorial videos, since that can add some tilt/unpredictability in the yoyo motion."
Throwers,3e3jfg,Cborne,2,Tue Jul 21 18:32:00 2015 UTC,It is just your throw. Adjust your wrist a bit to the right to see how it affects the throw.
Throwers,3e3jfg,Neverendingend2,2,Tue Jul 21 18:07:56 2015 UTC,Its your throw. Because fast 201 has high walls that's why it tilts. While classic has no wall design.

There was also a post a week or two ago about how you can put a thickish half moon piece of paper (about the half size of where you put the string for your yoyo finger) between the first and second layer of your wrap.

Throwers,3e1xyl,Lemonzest1989,2,Tue Jul 21 09:58:37 2015 UTC,"Well, aside from being Bi-Metals with similar width/height and insanely long spin times, they are different shapes and they play very differently.  I haven't had as much experience with the Space Cowboy, but I can see how people might prefer it over the Rainfly. It feels light on the string and the H shape feels nice in the hand... definitely the more forgiving of the two when it quickly shoots back up to your hand. I might be crazy, but I also think it feels a bit more laid back than the Rainfly.  The Rainfly I've been throwing for a little while (this is my second one). It has a more aggressive V shape and if it comes back unexpectedly it can hurt a bit. It's fast but heavy, and in comparison to the Space Cowboy you can definitely feel that extra weight on the string. It has a wider catch zone and makes it really easy to lock onto strings. Rejections are also very easy with this throw. The finish on this one is a little more sticky than my matte black version, so its a bit harder to grind on, but its not a big deal.   Both are really excellent throws in my opinion."

It has similarities to the speedaholic, but it spins longer and the shape of it plays better. Feels really nice in the hand too.  I have 2 of them in clear now, my first one is my daily throw and the second is a backup in case it gets damaged. I may also get into 3a play."

We are working now on a redesign for the Yeti that will make it better playing and easier to produce. Once that is done we'll be able to produce as many as people want, and won't have all these problems with the design and supply. This release is just leftover parts from the first production run that we're trying to make available for fans and collectors.

I came across a strange creature in it's natural habitat, an out of focus area. So I did what anyone else would try to do, take some pictures of this weird thing.  It hadn't spotted me just yet so I began to approach the creature, maintaining some cover behind the local flora. I was feeling fairly bold at this point and decided to try and creep in closer, for a more definitive shot.  This was the last shot I took before I startled the beast when a twig had snapped underfoot; as it turned it's gaze towards me I was frozen with fear as it stared me down with it's brilliant blue eye. I was obviously frightened, so this blurry shot is the best I could manage while being this close to what I think might be... a Yeti.  Now you might say, Iron Knuckle, you're a dummy butt, Yetis don't live in the PNW, that's a Sasquatch! And to you I say: Have you ever seen a Sasquatch in the wild out here?

During Jan-June I'd also have another 3 hours each day on the weekends for my club sport.

Throwers,3e0wco,DSdavidDS,2,Tue Jul 21 02:36:41 2015 UTC,"Since it sounds like you want to do string tricks, I'd recommend getting a different yoyo. The YYJ Classic will work very nicely, and be much easier for what you're trying to do. The yoyo you found is an older style that is quite fun for basic tricks, but difficult to use for more modern tricks we do with unresponsive yoyos.  Pick up some extra polyester string while you're at it. They tend to wear out quickly."
Throwers,3e0wco,CobraMode-,2,Tue Jul 21 02:58:27 2015 UTC,"The boomerang Yoyo has a clutch system, which means it'll return on its own and won't do much of anything.  If you type superyo renegade in Google, you should find quite enough information on it. It seems to be an ok, moddable imperial-to-butterfly yoyo. As general recommendations, since I assume it's old, I would get new strings and clean the bearing in lighter fluid. If it no longer binds, then I would add something like 3-in-1 oil in your bearing to make it responsive.  Edit: Just to be safe, I should probably specify that cleaning and lubricating the bearing should be done away from the actual yoyo.   If that doesn't improve its performance, you can see about changing it."
Throwers,3e0wco,LNocto,2,Tue Jul 21 03:29:23 2015 UTC,This was a very popular yoyo back in 2001. Getting multi minute sleep times off of it is definitely doable and a lot of the common tricks you see today were developed on the renegade. That being said it definitely has a smaller gap than the modern yoyos you see today so expect to practice more on it in order to hit tricks and it will get more difficult as you go. Also keep in mind that the renegade has the ability to switch between butterfly and imperial mode so you'll want it in butterfly mode to get the most use out of it.
Throwers,3e0wco,spicklehawk,2,Tue Jul 21 03:29:29 2015 UTC,"Considering how inexpensive some really good modern yoyos are now days I would say to get a new one.  One of the most recommended yoyos on here for beginners is the YoYoJam Classic and it only costs around $9. It's a fantastic yoyo, I own two."
Throwers,3e03lw,_Yeu_,9,Mon Jul 20 22:44:40 2015 UTC,"Sounds Cooler.  It's a more accessible verb.

A lo of people will spin the bearing the the tip of a pencil as it dries or even use compressed air to dry it.

Throwers,3e0nfn,RaccoonyDave,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:42:07 2015 UTC,"And i think i know what the issue is, the rope keeps slipping to the side of the bearing and the string robes against the response system.   It's a string.  You need to practice. You don't need a new bearing or to lube the bearing you have.  You need to throw straighter and better."
Throwers,3e0nfn,hiltonking,-1,Tue Jul 21 10:26:33 2015 UTC,"Something may have gotten into it. Clean the bearing with paint thinner and let it dry by spinning it on a pencil.  If you wish it to be  unresponsive from the start after cleaning, you do not have to lube it."
Throwers,3dxjo2,G2Jake,4,Mon Jul 20 10:37:56 2015 UTC,The answer is clear...
Throwers,3dxjo2,Apoplectic1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:52:15 2015 UTC,I'm gonna be sad when these are over. I look forward to each round quite a bit!
Throwers,3dxjo2,Afult27,3,Mon Jul 20 11:11:10 2015 UTC,But imagine how good it will feel to pick one up and throw it.
Throwers,3dxjo2,Apoplectic1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:17:02 2015 UTC,Hoping I can get one! 100% of the thing's I've voted for have been picked so I feel like I designed it myself!
Throwers,3dxjo2,Afult27,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:51:01 2015 UTC,"Lol, not a single one that I've picked till now has, but I still want one because it was made for us, and this will be the first top shelf throw that I've bought new."
Throwers,3dxjo2,Apoplectic1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:55:08 2015 UTC,Same here :D  Really hoping I can get my hands on one.

Throwers,3dykdq,MikeMonty,2,Mon Jul 20 16:12:14 2015 UTC,Not new. Been around for quite some time actually. Hype grew after the release of the Draupnir. I think the first bimetal came out in 1998. It took a while...
Throwers,3dykdq,AmplifiedReturnTops,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:32:03 2015 UTC,"Bimetals help with the weight dsitributions.  One can make a throw much more rim weighted if they put on stainless steel rims on an aluminum hub than one could making a solid aluminum one with the same volume distribution.    It also helps with the noise of the yoyo much like if you flip a silver quarter it will make a loud ringing sound until it hits the ground, but if you flip a copper and nickle clad quarter (that's what they were made out of after 1964), it till make a slight tick noise when you first flip it, but them remain silent."
Throwers,3dykdq,Apoplectic1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:17:05 2015 UTC,"Part of it is hype, but the other part of it is being able to distribute weight in a way that would be impossible using one material. Another added bonus with external ring bimetals is the protection that hard stainless rings offer against dings.  Some dont really make use of the advantages of being bimetal. For those its mostly looks and hype. But one that makes full use of what bimetal can be is amazing. Something like a YYR Draupnir is on another level. Its lighter and faster than other throws, but also far more stable."
Throwers,3dykdq,CtrlGaltDelete,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:34:25 2015 UTC,Torque. So much torque.
Throwers,3dwwhi,zareliman,4,Mon Jul 20 05:17:53 2015 UTC,"Wow, I'd be interested to see how it plays. Slightly oversized, nice IGR and looks like a lot of the weight will be in the rims. Do you know how much it'll end up weighting?"
Throwers,3dwwhi,Cuniculata,2,Mon Jul 20 08:51:07 2015 UTC,"Each half will weight roughly 29.5g. Add the anodizing, axle, bearing and pads and I anticipate something like 64g for the whole yoyo."
Throwers,3dwwhi,Cuniculata,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:09:58 2015 UTC,"Phew, so light for a decent sized yoyo. I'm really interested now"
Throwers,3dwwhi,2girls1meme,3,Tue Jul 21 08:12:48 2015 UTC,What would it even cost to get your design milled?

Throwers,3dxt0l,mostlyjoe,2,Mon Jul 20 12:28:39 2015 UTC,"Most of that is probably a technique issue.  as it is spinning touch it gently with your fingernail.  If the wobble smoothes out, then that means it is 100% a technique issue.  is the a front throw or a breakaway?"
Throwers,3dxt0l,suburiboy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:38:53 2015 UTC,Front. I'm ubernoobing it.
Throwers,3dxt0l,suburiboy,2,Mon Jul 20 12:41:19 2015 UTC,"One of the quickest fixes I know:  throw slightly forward instead of straight down.  The swinging motion helps to correct tilt.  When you learn the breakaway, the swinging motion is the main determinate of spin direction.  On the front, it usually doesn't swing as much, but it can still help."
Throwers,3dxt0l,livenetwork,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:54:29 2015 UTC,Thanks. Going to work on my breakaway once I master basic binds again.
Throwers,3dxt0l,Apoplectic1,2,Mon Jul 20 17:58:31 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind it's a different bind, for a breakaway."
Throwers,3dxt0l,baughbberick,2,Mon Jul 20 21:23:54 2015 UTC,"Try to adjust the angle of your wrist as you throw, and I've found leaving the string between your throw and the finger loop before your throw just a bit loose before your throw helps too (not too loose, just give the yo like 1/10 of a turn, just enough so that it's not completely taught)."
Throwers,3dxt0l,songwind,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:16:38 2015 UTC,"I found learning to throw a top helped me a lot with throwing a yoyo, different technique for each one, but same process for learning to hone it."

Throwers,3dv920,luckshott,2,Sun Jul 19 20:59:09 2015 UTC,"I dont think the used shutter will come back in stock, I think the site gets used yoyos from people and resells them, so each will be unique he just wants to show the type of stock he had.  There are lots of nice yoyos on there though, the Genesis looks awesome, althought out of your price range a bit. I think I saw a nicely priced Superstar on their the other day.  Congrats!

That tutorial playlist is nice but make sure you are always looking around for other tricks, at this point in your progress there are lots of other tricks that build fundamentals you can be practicing;  The Plastic Whip  Laceration  Man on the Flying Trapeze and his Brother SLACK My favorite trick I can do.  Ripcord  Buddha's Revenge Basically a side mount Barrel Rolls.  I know all of these tricks, and am currently learning Skin the Gerbil, Atom Smasher, and Cold Fusion.

Throwers,3dwz62,spncrbrry,3,Mon Jul 20 06:33:16 2015 UTC,"When you uncross, make sure that your freehand (non-throwhand) goes through the center, this is what creates the double strings.  A lot of people, when learning, rush the trick and move through the center with their throwhand.  You'll also want to make sure that the throwhand base segment (coming directly from the knot) is tucked out of the way so that your throwhand underpass only uses the one string.  Hope that makes sense...if not let me know and I'll try to explain it another way."

Throwers,3dwikm,bunnytard49,2,Mon Jul 20 03:00:24 2015 UTC,"I can't believe nobody in this thread has given you a clear answer! It's such a simple fix!  So there are two ways to put the string on your finger: the right way and the wrong way. Assuming you are a righty, you should orient the slip knot so that the side with two strings is on the side of your ring finger and the side with one string is pointing towards your thumb if your hand is palm down. Putting the string on your finger this way will prevent the slippage. Eventually you'll put the string on the right way unconsciously and you won't even have to think about it."

Throwers,3dwikm,mosler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:42:06 2015 UTC,I put the side with the double string on my finger so it's on my thumb side. This seems to make it tighter on my finger when I throw.

Thanks to the conversion rate of the yen you'd only be spending $135 or so on a D bearing ultra light bimetal.  Here's another odd throw that goes for being ultra wide and undersized while staying undersized but I personally haven't gotten to test it:  http://spingear.jp/index.php?dispatch=products.view&product_id=1954  I think the chief is a bit slow considering your tastes and maybe the marvel from G2 could be worth checking out.   As for the 5A I'd probly grab the new audley positron:  http://spingear.jp/index.php?dispatch=products.view&product_id=1986  It should be pretty stable and good otherwise the iyoyo steel should fit it as well. As for plastic I'd be worried about the durability of the triad so maybe a rally or addiction if you want metal weight rings. Quest of course comes to mind but it's a bit more spendy unless you get it used. As a new yoyo the price is a bit outrageous.

Throwers,3duivr,saruman0426,5,Sun Jul 19 16:40:35 2015 UTC,"And CLYW makes regular aluminum YoYos that cost way more than those you mentioned.   But let's just compare the Anglam CC and the Space Cowboy.   The CC can be bought for around $160 if you order from Spingear, which is roughly $40 more than the SC.   My guess as to part of the price difference is that the SC is manufactured in much higher numbers, (and in China) so therefor the cost per unit is less. I also wouldn't be surprised if sOMEThing has higher quality control etc.   I love my space cowboy. As well as it is regarded, I still think it may be underrated. But do I think my Anglam CC is better? Absolutely. But is it 30% better? That's hard to say.   Remember that like most things, the more expensive they get the more diminished the improvement is.   The difference between a $6 yoyo and a $20 yoyo is pretty significant and obvious. The difference between an $80 yoyo and a $100 is less. The difference between a $120 and a $160 yoyo is even less.  But there is (usually) still a difference."
Throwers,3duivr,moby323,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:00:10 2015 UTC,"What I'm wondering (as a newer person to all this) is why someone would pick a CLYW over a bimetal for example. Doesn't bimetal allow for better weight distribution? Not hating on CLYW or anything, I'm just curious since I had looked at them and they're (as far as I can tell) mostly 6061 aluminum. Do they feel as good as most similarly priced bimetals? And also, why doesn't 7075 seem as popular as far as I can tell in general (especially on higher end)?  I guess it's a really subjective question but some insight into that would be great."
Throwers,3duivr,Cborne,3,Sun Jul 19 18:38:18 2015 UTC,"Variety. The type of person who is willing to drop $160 on a yoyo likely already has a significant collection, bi-metals included. They want to try different designs.   7075 should be more popular, I definitely notice a difference in toughness. But it is also more difficult to machine and (I believe) requires somewhat different equipment."
Throwers,3duivr,moby323,3,Sun Jul 19 18:41:42 2015 UTC,"7075 isn't too bad to work.  I actually find it easier to work than 6061 on my manual lathe, personally ... that shit gets gummy and burns up my tooling real quick, .  In a CNC environment, where you're programming in exact feed rates, using coolant, and the like... that's probably not an issue.  7075 might wear a bit more on tooling in a ""perfect"" scenario.  I think the ""difficult to machine"" part is overstated though.  I think the price increase also has to do with the fact that it costs a little more than twice as much.  Also, I unfortunately think, perhaps due to how young a lot of Yoyoers are, the majority market isn't willing to pay for premium materials... so that means smaller runs.  Smaller runs means less Yoyos to mitigate setup costs... coupled with the slight tooling and materials cost increase, and the price difference ends up being somewhat significant.    Same goes with Titanium... it's nothing a good machinist can't handle... it's just really expensive, and not enough people are willing to pay a premium, so they're smaller runs... which further increases the cost.  Personally, I'd welcome a shift to more 7075 (and Titanium!) Yoyos, though.  It's just a far superior alloy.  It is literally almost twice as ""strong"" (strength, toughness, hardness) as 6061.  I'd be willing to spend an extra ~$20 on all of my throws if that meant they'd be produced in 7075."
Throwers,3duivr,Weebus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:52:48 2015 UTC,"I agree re: wanting 7075 on a lot more yoyos but mainly because I expect to ding my first few throws a LOT and I'd rather have the anodization come off than have the metal deform as is more likely with 6061 :) Maybe I'll just start a 7075 collection lol.  I would have expected 7075 to be one of the first ""premium"" features on all mid to high end stuff since...well, it lasts longer, but it still seems like a lesser used material when I look at all the stuff out there.  Really good insight though, thanks!"
Throwers,3duivr,Cborne,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:15:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, to me... a little extra durability is worth it for sure.

Throwers,3duivr,Cborne,2,Sun Jul 19 18:44:53 2015 UTC,"Shape. The reason why someone would pick a certain aluminum yoyo over a bimetal is the shape and how the weight IS distributed. Sometimes, you look for centered weight, or a wide shape, or under/oversized diameters. The material involved also changes how you can shape the yoyo; I.e. a titanium yoyo can have much thinner walls than a 6061 yoyo because of the strength of titanium, so they can have more material around the center or the rim edges. A bimetal has to be cut down to make room for the heavy rings that would be put on the rims or it will be too heavy.  There isn't a ""better/best"" kind of scenario, so like you said; it's pretty subjective. It just boils down to different kinds of distribution of weight. Preference is something you develop over time (I still don't even know what I want)."

Throwers,3duivr,Iron_Knuckle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:04:10 2015 UTC,"So are bi-metals.  I'm not 100% on the process... but I can make educated guesses.  The two metals have to be machined to fit together separately, fit together, and I assume finished together.  That adds additional set-up and machining steps, which add a significant amount of time to a machining operation.  Different metals also require different cut speeds/feed rates/etc (and Stainless wears similarly on tooling to Titanium)... so if you're machining them together, you need to account for that in the CNC programming, or you're going to be wearing out or breaking tooling more often than you want."
Throwers,3duivr,Weebus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:29:41 2015 UTC,"Bimetal doesn't automatically mean superior, depending on how you play. I'm sure for some people a really high end aluminum yoyo works better than thee same range of bimetal. The heavy rim weight is going to add momentum which could interfere with someone that has a really frenetic sort of play style, I think."

Throwers,3duivr,Kuryaka,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:19:33 2015 UTC,"Probably little to none.  Labor and machine time costs in China are almost negligible by comparison to those in the US and other countries... and they happen to be VERY good at reproducing existing designs (and can get away with it due to extremely lax/non-existent international copyright laws).  You're probably paying only a few bucks more than materials+transportation costs when you buy a MagicYoYo.  They also don't need to play perfectly, as their customer base isn't necessarily the type of person who cares (especially at the price they pay).  So long as they're round and vaguely Yoyo shaped, they probably work just fine for the majority of people buying them.  Clones/counterfeits are a big deal/topic of conversation/etc in the knife collecting world.  There are a lot of ""clones"" coming out of China of popular designs made in the US, especially in recent years.    For comparison, the knife that this is a clone of costs over $1000... and has a several-month waiting list (for the real thing).  Materials probably cost ~$60 on either one... and the people at Direware are by no means raking in the cash.  They're just paying themselves fair value for their labor (plus other overhead), while the Chinese manufacturers aren't.  That said, I've handled both of the knives above... the differences come in the tolerances, attention to details, and finish.  They're by no means bad on the clone (in fact, they're extremely impressive), but little flaws wouldn't pass QC with Direware.  I haven't handled a MagicYoYo, but I assume it's a similar situation."

Throwers,3duivr,thekiyote,2,Sun Jul 19 18:24:58 2015 UTC,"Everybody's basically right, there is a culture in Japan that favors quality and attention to detail greater than cost.  Higher end metals, much longer design times, precision bearings, and such a low tolerance for errors you'd think they're designing tools for the space station, all lead to a ballooning production cost, which leads to a much higher consumer cost.    Both Japanese consumer are okay with the higher cost, and the producers are okay with with the smaller profits, though.  Japanese throwers are able to identify and recognize the smallest details and the manufacturers take pride in being able to satisfy them.  Someone outside the hobby couldn't recognize the difference, but to them, those details are worth it.  I posted a video the other day from Rewind (that I never did get around to translating) which was pretty much a critique on those types of details.  They're like unboxing vids cranked to 11.

They're not the best overall bearing, but they're by far the best price:performance ratio, at least on my opinion. I have much nicer bearings, but when they cost 4x as much or more than the Whipples, it's hard to justify the expensive ones for everything in my collection."

Been running the same one in one of my yoyos for over a year without lube. Tough as hell, and does it's job of centering string.  YoYoRecreation Double Straight - Like the TX Delta, but with another set of cuts to ease the transition into the center groove. Way more delicate but very quiet, even during the break in period. Great spin time, stacks string well, keeps string centered.  For shaped bearings, those are what I've liked.

I'm having to work a lot on my breakaway too, and my only advice is to watch this yotricks video and find the breakaway that works for you, don't worry about doing the best one, over the side of the hand.  Do the one that is comfortable and gives you the strongest throws, at least for now."
Throwers,3duhmz,sympathico,2,Sun Jul 19 18:06:27 2015 UTC,"Just think if you were standing up straight and facing a whiteboard/chalkboard, then drawl a circle as wide as your shoulders, without moving your shoulders or legs*.  This isn't exactly the motion (but close), because you'll begin by throwing your hand around the circle, but about 1/4 of the way around you stop the elbow and let the forearm/hand whip downwards the rest of the half-circle (You don't need to draw the other half of the circle...the yoyo will do that for you).  Or something like that.  I personally found this easy (luckily).  I just did normal throws and moved my body 90 degrees to the right of the yoyo (right-handed, but facing the side of the yoyo) while still doing my normal throws (except I had to do a bit more of an exaggerated arm movement and moved the elbow a little farther away from my body in order to feel natural...and it should feel natural.  If you feel awkward or pain you are not doing it right).  Edit: *Eventually, you'll want power.  By doing the basic motion a hundred-godzilla times (which you will), you'll find yourself pulling power from the ground:  It starts with your feet slightly shifting, pulling your knees ever so slightly to the left.  This is followed by a slight twitch of the hip, which forces the shoulders to shift to the left just a bit, then the elbow receives the culmination of these sequential body movements.  This entire action ends at the release of the yoyo from your hand (around the 1/4 circle point), and the entire motion lasts, perhaps, an eighth of a second.  But, the result is the coordinated momentum of your entire body focusing on the single release point and empowering the throw with lots of force...much like throwing a ball or snapping a whip."

Throwers,3dryy2,moby323,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:13:10 2015 UTC,You want to try to get the string to touch the o-rings as much as possible when you try to get the yoyo back to your hand. If you add a slight angle (left or right) when you pull on the string you will cause more friction between the o-ring and string making it more likely that the yoyo will 'grab' the string and return to your hand.  It's all about practice. If the method I mentioned still does not work just practice your throws and look for a tutorial on how to 'bind'. There should be one on yoyoexpert.
Throwers,3dryy2,Kuryaka,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:13:02 2015 UTC,"It comes responsive out of the box, but a lot of people don't like it's feeling. Putting the good response pads in and adding some thick lube to the bearing will make it a bit nicer, I hear.

Throwers,3dshpm,Pahlz,6,Sun Jul 19 00:56:29 2015 UTC,"Hey Pahlz. OneDrop is known to ship their wonderful ten ball bearings with a healthy dose of lube, which usually works itself out in just a few hours. If you want it to be unresponsive lube is not the way to go, it would only make it more responsive. A little bit if lube in a clean bearing is said to prolong the life of them, and it also helps shut them up a bit. :D  If you've already clocked some serious hours, then it is likely not needing breaking in. The next step is to open her up and check it out. Make sure there is no string fiber or hair or other debris in the bearing seat. Then you may want to try cleaning it. I can't link a tutorial at the moment but I'm sure one of our brothers will answer the call with a video. After you clean the bearing it may be worth adding Just a drop on thin lube.   If none of this helps I'd recommend emailing OneDrop, as the problem would likely be a defective bearing,  or potentially a defective yo-yo.  Best of luck."
Throwers,3dshpm,meech7607,3,Sun Jul 19 01:05:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies everyone, I'll keep throwing it for a while and if nothing changes I'll try cleaning the bearing. Also, upon further inspection I've noticed that the YoYo is pretty vibey and the vibe sort of pulsates, maybe that has something to do with it. I'm hesitant to contact OneDrop about it as I feel like it could be my fault due to screwing it together poorly, I'm not sure how to tell if I've been screwing it in properly or not.  EDIT: Grammar"

Throwers,3dsbqg,Buddah_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:26:09 2015 UTC,"You can fold aluminum foil very dense and heavy. But if you have something better like that golf tape, experiment with it. Hot glue isn't super permanent."
Throwers,3dsbqg,Lamasaurus,2,Sun Jul 19 06:09:21 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you could pour some hot glue into it, careful to not gum up any components. Not sure if having more weight near the center or near the sides is better for stability, but you could also use foam (covered with a more heat-resistant material to prevent rampant melting) to fill up some space to layer glue on the outside instead.   Actually, the easiest way to play around with weight distribution is using oily clay that doesn't dry up (like polymer clay) and trying to pack it in evenly. But then it's almost easier to just buy another yoyo."
Throwers,3dsbqg,Kuryaka,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:59:35 2015 UTC,The Replay Pro is 69.2 grams. I'm new to this but it seems a little heavy.
Throwers,3dsbqg,Trace3k,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:08:55 2015 UTC,"It's also a little big, apparently. Normal-sized for plastics though.  I do not have large hands (would say normal-sized for a small guy), nor do I have significantly different throws to compare it to, but the Replay Pro feels really nice."
Throwers,3dsbqg,Kuryaka,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:43:33 2015 UTC,I really like mine.
Throwers,3dsbqg,Trace3k,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:54:45 2015 UTC,It's on the heavier end but the Yeti's just as heavy and the NorthStar and DownBeat are heavier and people really like those as far as I can tell.  The Surge is like 70.7g (Are there heavier yoyos? I'm kinda curious but I only looked up about 40 of them and it was the heaviest) but I've seen pretty positive reviews of it.  I guess it's just what kind of feel you prefer and also the weight distribution is probably more important in terms of feel I would guess
Throwers,3dsbqg,Cborne,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:16:26 2015 UTC,"I like my whip... but yeah, it's too light; not unplayable, just too light..  IDK how you would make it heavier, though.  Trying to put glue or silicone in the caps may make it worse, since it will play like a black of glue. but that may be an option."

Throwers,3dsa9b,Kuryaka,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:31:44 2015 UTC,Where did the string break? You miiight be able to tie them back together depending on where they broke.That would also help pin down why your strings broke. Unless they're very well-used strings.  knotted string is weaker than pristine string though so you're risking breakage again.

Throwers,3dni9n,Guy_Faux,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:40:08 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to get the Rookie Thrower Ladder tricks down, gotten Dizzy Baby down but the two other tricks are....well, tricky."
Throwers,3dni9n,AetherRoamer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:30:26 2015 UTC,The one I'm having the most issues with is the 1.5 mount.... I can't get it for the life of me. That is the only thing stopping me from entering right now.
Throwers,3dni9n,TherealGallade,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:53:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would enter, but I think I'm too late, I won't get my first throw for a few days, and I won't be able to learn any tricks before the event ends, and I fear that I might not be able to keep up with the tricks they have you submit. For example, I probably wont be able to get the 1.5 mount (or the others) before he event ends, and once I do get them, they will be asking for new, harder tricks. So once I would be able to participate in the first one, they will have moved on, and I will always be 1 step behind :("
Throwers,3dni9n,Kuryaka,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:02:58 2015 UTC,"Being a few days behind shouldn't matter when you get to advanced tricks. It's more of how dedicated you are. There was the one guy who had a very clean performance in 2-3 days, but that was because he practiced for 3 hours straight to get the tricks down, as well as a lot of practice before the contest was even announced. Meanwhile, I've been ""practicing"" for about a week and haven't gotten there.  It is a sport and it takes dedication. While it's definitely ""possible"" to keep up with the contests, I think the contests right after this one are going to leave people behind unless they absolutely love throwing and have the time and dedication to practice every day. That's okay though, since I suspect they're going to be much harder to win and much more rewarding/fun to watch."
Throwers,3dni9n,TherealGallade,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:46:35 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the support, from what you said, I might be able to do it. I have lots of spare time, and I am so pumped to get started. Even if I don't have the chance to get into this one, I am determined, so I might get good enough to get into the next one!"
Throwers,3dni9n,AetherRoamer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:06:05 2015 UTC,"I found myself constantly leaving the PC to give throwing another go, which never really happened to me before with other hobbies (I'd spend half an hour on a hobby, then back to the pc for a day). I feel like I'll be able to keep up with competitions, not for the prizes, but because I want to get better, I want to learn more and it's the only sport (if you can call it that) that I've ever felt truly dedicated to and passionate about."
Throwers,3dni9n,moby323,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:30:51 2015 UTC,Nah mate you won't be 1 step behind. I thought I wasn't gonna be able to do anything since I just got my throws yesterday and I can atleast hit my bind and dizzy baby.. My Trapeze and brother is crap because I can't side style bind well and my 1.5 is uh... Non existent.
Throwers,3dni9n,Lemonzest1989,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:50:02 2015 UTC,Try doing it in two steps. Watch some of the videos submitted for the contest and see what I'm talking about.

Throwers,3dni9n,TherealGallade,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:05:10 2015 UTC,I wasnt able to ever get it until I started kind of pulling my non throw hand slightly towards myself and pushing my thrown hand just slightly away.   This for me creates enough room to get the 1.5 to go where you want it instead of on all the other strings.  good luck! you can do i!

It's not necessarily discouraged (I haven't heard anything from the mods, at least), but I normally don't do much of it in this sub, because the community is more likely to have younger people in it, and I want to respect that.  Although, I still bust out a cuss word when I get excited."
Throwers,3dni9n,TherealGallade,2,Sat Jul 18 13:52:47 2015 UTC,"Same. I'm all for a good expletive, but I never feel the need to within the /r/throwers community."

I was never told anything about it, but automatically assumed to keep that sh*t in check (something I've never felt on any sub-Reddit..with the except of /r/math, but even that has relaxed over the years as they allowed more fun and funny comments).  I cuss like a sailor in other communities, but never felt that here.  Personally, I like it (very much a sign of respect...not that if you do cuss you are bad, hell me, mobes, and alphuh were talking adult one night).  This is one of the most cool communities that I know, with a great mix of all ages, races, and professions/lifestyles.  I am fine holding back if it helps preserve the vibe that we have going, but I'm not going to get down on anyone for freely expressing themselves."

Throwers,3dn2a6,zrs42160,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:29:15 2015 UTC,@amish_electrician here! Your binds are legit! I really really like this one! Even more so because I have been messing around with that cross armed GT lately. Any tips for nailing this bind?!
Throwers,3dn2a6,zrs42160,2,Fri Jul 17 20:58:23 2015 UTC,"Whats up dude! Honored you like them, big fan of your stuff too. Im def all about the fun binds, and lately GT's also.    What helped me get this pretty consistent was  1) Having one handed/ onehanded+slap laceration binds pretty good without snags (gotta whip only enough in to get the bind going or it will snag) which I learned previously just because I love one handed binds. The slap isnt always needed but helps to get it 100% since the bind needs to be small to not snag.  2) I could do trapeze to lacerations which gave me a feel for lacerating into the gap decently with the string from a weird non slack position.  3) I could do the backwards wrist GT into a laceration (you have to whip the laceration really hard to untangle/unspin the GT before it gets to the gap, and also help it lacerate and untangle when you pop it off with your NTH)   I basically just combined those movements together and it worked out pretty great. I tried to do backwards wrist GT to brent stole first but couldnt make it happen. In the process I realized I could bind.   Here is a slow mo video that got cropped really badly by iMovie that might help you see the timing of everything.   https://vid.me/GmKP"
Throwers,3dn2a6,BirdinatorJack,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:59:34 2015 UTC,I am flattered man! Thanks! Definitely dig your stuff! It's fun to watch how we progress!    This advice is exactly what I was looking for! Thanks for typing it all out! And that slow mo video is perfect! I can do most of the lacerations/ whips you were referring too.   I'll practice that bind this weekend! Expect a video once I nail it!   Thanks again! :)

Throwers,3dpd0c,FullThrottleFRS,2,Sat Jul 18 10:47:33 2015 UTC,"I've done this with a Shaqlerstar that I had, and made it even more matte looking. If you live in a dry climate and have dry hands, yeah, it will grind slightly better, but still not great. I live in Minnesota, which can be pretty humid, and my hands aren't super dry, so it didn't help much for me, nowhere near a good blasted aluminum.  The biggest benefit, in my opinion, is the feel in hand. A matte finish just feels better to me than glossy does."
Throwers,3dmsap,Lamasaurus,2,Fri Jul 17 15:19:20 2015 UTC,"It's good, but slow down a bit, it looked as if you forgot where your fingers needed to be and fumbled a bit before the triangle."
Throwers,3dmsap,12Characters_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:27:04 2015 UTC,Right before the slack? Yeah that is a bit of a fumble part to be honest.

Throwers,3dmgd2,Weebus,2,Fri Jul 17 13:40:42 2015 UTC,"Rallys came in the mail yesterday... but a local gaming store also carries a small selection of Yoyos.  I got to play with the Downbeat a little bit when I stopped by last Saturday and loved it, but I was with my girlfriend and didn't want to sleep on the couch that night.  You've all been taunting me with your Downbeats all week, so I caved (not that difficult, haha)... snuck by yesterday while she was at work and bought it :D  It is seriously a fun one.  It's amazing what just a couple of grams does.  I love the Nickel finish on it.  I'm thinking about forcing a patina on it just to give it some extra character.  I had a bit of a poor experience with vibe in my first Rally... but these two are absolutely smooth.  I now see what they hype is all about.  They're just a lot of fun to play with.  Not to mention, the white looks SO good in person.  I loved the look from pictures online, but the matte finish just gives it that extra ""softness"" that you can't capture in a photo."

Throwers,3dmgd2,livenetwork,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:18:51 2015 UTC,"That's not necessarily true.  More expensive doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be more smooth.  My OneSTAR is similarly smooth to my Rally and smoother than some of my higher-end aluminum throws.  The Speedaholic is known to be very smooth.  Have you done the fingernail test on it to make sure it's not your throw?  Spin it, then bring your fingernail up to it to smooth out the spin.  Do you see it vibrating/shaking visibly?  Have you tried swapping a different bearing in there and making sure everything was tight and in place (make sure the rings, side effects, axle, etc aren't loose).  If not, those could sometimes be the root of the issue.  That said, my first Rally did have significantly more than anything else I own to the point where I knew something was up, regardless of what I tried.  This picture was taken after smoothing it with my fingernail... you can kind of see how much it was vibrating from the motion blur around it (it would pulsate, that was caught about midway in the pulse).  If yours looks like that on a fingernail test and nothing seems to help it, I'd definitely say something is up.  Shoot them an email and I'm sure they'd help you out.  I'm on my phone so I don't have their email address on me, but it should be Google-able."

Throwers,3dmgd2,ParvarSingh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:54:37 2015 UTC,"I do some metalwork as a hobby.  A common thing to do, especially in jewelry/other copper/silver/etc work is to ""force"" a patina to simulate natural aging/to achieve a certain look.  Different chemicals react to different metals in all sorts of ways to produce different sorts of oxidation, which in turn produces all sorts of different colors... so I've got all sorts of stuff for it.    The acids in Sprite/other sodas do the same thing... only they are significantly weaker concentration.  Other common things people use to force patinas are vinegars, coffee, and mustard.  I've even seen raw beef used to force it on steel.  I'm not 100% on what you can do with a nickel plating, so I'll most likely just darken it to give it a more antiqued look, similar to what the soda patinas look like... only I don't want to wait 20 hours for it to happen :P  Should also be able to get a darker/more consistent finish with a straight chemical."

Throwers,3dn93t,boopzilla,2,Fri Jul 17 17:27:13 2015 UTC,Have you tried the duncan flipside and the YYR diffusion 2? I'm also a fan of plastics and I thought that you might like those as well. :p
Throwers,3dn93t,Alarei,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:15:59 2015 UTC,"Nope, haven't tried either of those. Definitely gonna check em out now though. Thanks!"

Throwers,3dn93t,Afult27,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:29:09 2015 UTC,Awesome. Solid collection of quality plastic. I really need to buy a new Protostar
Throwers,3dn93t,Afult27,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:34:24 2015 UTC,Looks like you're getting ready to break into the world of metals soon!
Throwers,3dn93t,12Characters_,2,Fri Jul 17 17:44:02 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm not a huge fan of the metals I do have. Oops.
Throwers,3dn93t,benm36,2,Fri Jul 17 18:21:31 2015 UTC,"Haha, no need to ""oops"" about it, its all preference anyway!"
Throwers,3dn93t,benm36,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:05:51 2015 UTC,What is that bad one? o.O
Throwers,3dn93t,ParvarSingh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:04:49 2015 UTC,"RecRev Bad Rep. It's actually stacked, too, but it's stupid heavy with them on."
Throwers,3dn93t,xAcesHighx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:18:13 2015 UTC,How does it play? I've always wanted to try one
Throwers,3dn93t,moby323,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:02:52 2015 UTC,"With the stacks on, it's super heavy and slow. Without, it's actually really solid and buttery smooth. I got it at the same time as an 888x and ended up trading the 888x and keeping this one, when my original intention was to do the opposite. I've thought about selling/trading it a few times, because honestly I just don't throw a whole lot. It's a bit smaller than I like."
Throwers,3dn93t,moby323,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:31:18 2015 UTC,Nice. If you do end up trading it I'd be interested
Throwers,3dpm0f,FMHappy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:41:30 2015 UTC,"Bring hands towards the center, usually left hand is too far too the left and right too far to the right. If the yoyo tilts at all that means you ate losing spin. Pull your hands tight enough for all five strings to stay in the gap and no more than that. Pulling it tighter will lose spin."
Throwers,3dpm0f,robertterwilligerjr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:56:59 2015 UTC,this and try to keep your hands in one plane. Also move relatively fast but still controllable.
Throwers,3dpm0f,Tozzil,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:19:10 2015 UTC,Keep the string pretty tight.  Not breaking tight just pretty tight.  The rest is just practice.
Throwers,3dpitb,tttony2x,2,Sat Jul 18 05:04:31 2015 UTC,"I would get a replay pro for $15 and a protostar for about $35 some kitty string.   Replay pro and the protostar are really fun but are a different shapes. The protostar is a wing shape i think and the replay is organic. Another good thing is you don't have to worry about dinging them up while you're learning.   That would give you two different shapes to play and see how they differ, you may even have an easier time learning a trick on one shape than the other.   Both of them will do just about any trick you want, except looping"
Throwers,3dpitb,Stocke2,3,Sat Jul 18 13:55:51 2015 UTC,"Greetings!   Yoyofactory Classic (10 usd), Best beginner yoyo in my opinion. This yoyo will take you all the way to the intermediate tricks and some advanced ones.  To turn your YYJ Classic into an unresponsive (a yoyo that does not come back with a tug of your hand, but with a trick called a bind) yoyo, you have to buy a Size C Bearing and a new pair of response pads. Both of which will replace the ones that are currently installed in your responsive yoyo.  I recommend these two:  One Drop 10 Ball Bearing (8 usd) One Drop Response Pads, Slim Pad Size 19.mm (4 usd)  That will total to 22 usd, you can get a 10 pack of strings for 3.50 or a 100 pack for 18 to 20 usd.  Hopefully I didn't miss anything. Please do check the links in the sidebar also. :P"
Throwers,3dpitb,Alarei,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:57:46 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! I picked up a A YYF Classic and some kitty string. I'll grab the stuff to make it unresponsive if I enjoy this a bunch.

If you're standing in one spot, you're going to be shaking like a broken blender. Survey the stage before you start, walk around and claim it as yours. Make it your house and just put on the best show you can. First contests are always scary!"

Please keep us posted, we will so be rooting for you!"
Throwers,3dnrz2,Robsbot_the_robot,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:48:23 2015 UTC,"As with anything competitive chances are you aren't going to do outstanding first whack at it. That's OK! Use this as almost a practice for other competitions. Take in the atmosphere. Survey everything. Talk to and meet new people. Most importantly? Enjoy yourself! If you stress yourself out and don't have fun you'll end up quitting the hobby, which is worse than not placing. Have fun and do the best you can. Good luck!"
Throwers,3dojih,Apoplectic1,4,Fri Jul 17 23:28:22 2015 UTC,Momentum. Ideally you want it to go as low over your finger as possible to get a rejection. The most important magic drop tip is to keep your thumb pointed straight up.
Throwers,3dojih,Ichivonuno,2,Fri Jul 17 23:32:35 2015 UTC,go as low over your finger as possible to get a rejection   Wow this really did it for me! Good tip

Throwers,3dojih,Ichivonuno,3,Sat Jul 18 04:13:52 2015 UTC,It goes over like a suicide. Try to make an L shape as wide as tpy can.   Look up Brandon Vus video on youtube. Helped a ton

Throwers,3dmbln,suburiboy,3,Fri Jul 17 13:14:59 2015 UTC,"They really should just have called the new one something different. I mean, the shape is different, it costs almost 3X as much, and it doesn't come with both bearings anymore.  That's what I like about the ""old"" one, it comes with both bearings so I am quicker to recommend it for beginners."
Throwers,3dmbln,moby323,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:21:15 2015 UTC,My new Diffusion came with 2 bearings. Do the non-Clock Hazard editions only come with 1?
Throwers,3dmbln,neveranexit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:34:26 2015 UTC,It did? I wonder if the descriptions just don't mention it anymore
Throwers,3dmbln,moby323,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:43:51 2015 UTC,I grabbed a clear Diffusion 2 the week they came out. It came with a DS bearing and a thin bearing.
