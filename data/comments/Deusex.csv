Deusex,3e4opv,arcticBagel,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:12:53 2015 UTC,"I have not encountered this, but I'm intrigued.  The weird part is how a path that works in a harder difficulty doesn't work on an easier difficulty.  I would have expected that the opposite way around might happen - some choices that are accepted on an easier version not be good enough in a harder difficulty.   But this way around seems weird. Super weird."
Deusex,3e4opv,Berrr,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:13:58 2015 UTC,"I think the battles have always been a bit random, as in, the same options will not always work. There are several responses that may or may not show up. It was made that way to keep you on your toes and listen to the person talking. I don't remember whether it was affected by difficult though. I'll test it tonight."

Deusex,3e2ref,lacsativ,16,Tue Jul 21 14:46:08 2015 UTC,"That's a question that can only really be answered according to how fast you play, what difficulty you're on and how good you are at the game. If it took you 21 hours to get to Paris, I'd say you've probably got at least a good 5-10 hours of game left ahead of you, since you're basically only halfway through Paris at this point."
Deusex,3e2ref,Andreus,5,Tue Jul 21 14:55:01 2015 UTC,yea you've got a lot of game ahead of you.
Deusex,3e2ref,arcticBagel,7,Tue Jul 21 15:58:26 2015 UTC,"You've still got several significant missions and non-combat areas left to cover.  Depending on your skill level and how you're playing the game, I'd say you probably have about 10-15 hours left, assuming you want to explore the non-combat areas.  The primary missions from this point on are pretty lengthy, so be prepared to invest a fairly decent amount of time in the game.  I've played and beaten the game more times than I care to count, and it usually takes me about 29 hours to do everything, talk to everyone, etc.  If you're 21 hours in the middle of Paris, you've still got quite some time ahead of you."

Deusex,3e4w1y,Phototoxin,2,Wed Jul 22 01:06:55 2015 UTC,they are usually louder.  Remember a non-lethal takedown is always the most silent way to eliminate resistance so stick with the prod...

Deusex,3dzgsq,ep0nym1,5,Mon Jul 20 20:00:31 2015 UTC,"They haven't fixed it, no. Things like screen-space ambient occlusion and baked radiosity transfer are inferior in the Director's Cut, but you probably won't notice unless you know what to look for. I had graphical glitches with it too, but they were fortunately fixed by an Nvidia driver update a while ago.  Maybe check if you've hidden HR from your main games list? It should not simply disappear. Maybe file a support ticket if you can't find it.  Edit: http://m.imgur.com/a/XBebO should give a good idea of the graphical differences."
Deusex,3dzgsq,tombsar,4,Mon Jul 20 22:01:01 2015 UTC,"Strange, HR and HR:DC count as two different games, and they have to be bought separately. But anyway. DC didn't lower the graphics quality, in fact it improved it - they made the golden filter subtler and it uses better shading and textures, like in The Missing Link. Some people had problems with textures being weird, but that should be fixed now (it may be a rare problem on some machines, maybe)."
Deusex,3dzgsq,eliza__cassan,5,Mon Jul 20 20:41:58 2015 UTC,"They improved some aspects of the graphics, but a lot of things are noticeably worse since DC uses an earlier version of the engine.  Edit: Here are some good comparison screenshots http://m.imgur.com/a/XBebO although the problems with ssao are only really obvious when moving the camera around (there are subtle blotchy patterns that stay fixed relative to the screen, rather than the scene)."
Deusex,3dzgsq,tombsar,3,Mon Jul 20 21:55:56 2015 UTC,"I prefer the DC look. And now you've reminded me, I do have that glitch when there are white and black pixels on character's faces, though I've always chalked it down to playing on a laptop. The only other glitch I've encountered were the white flashes, but that one was fairly easy to fix. My textures seem fine as well (they are not ""zoomed in"" in Jensen's apartment like in the album you linked, for example).   Is the SSAO problem like a texture overlay that doesn't move?"
Deusex,3dzgsq,eliza__cassan,3,Mon Jul 20 22:16:17 2015 UTC,"I forgot the black/white pixels on characters' skin. I get it on both my desktops, so it's not limited to laptop gpus (but could be an nvidia problem).  That sounds like a good description of the SSAO problem. AFAIK some kind of noise is needed to disguise artefacts, so it is deliberate, but is done more crudely than in the original."
Deusex,3dzgsq,tombsar,2,Tue Jul 21 08:06:13 2015 UTC,"but could be an nvidia problem   Very likely, my laptop has an nVidia card...  I think they did a disservice to the game by removing the gold filter, it most likely helped mask some of the imperfections and make the noise filter more muted/uniform. It's unfortunate since I really like other changes."
Deusex,3dyccx,CaesarCzech,5,Mon Jul 20 15:13:46 2015 UTC,"Try the second or third method here.  I personally use ""set deusex.jcdentonmale bcheatsenabled true"" but it's a bit tedious to type it in each time."
Deusex,3dyccx,I-want-a-callisto,2,Mon Jul 20 15:43:46 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: you can just write ""human"" instead of ""deusex.jcdentonmale"" because the jcdentonmale class extends the human class. It's still a bit of an unwieldy command, but that shortcut saved me a lot of time back in the day."
Deusex,3dyccx,Umsakis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:52:28 2015 UTC,"i tried the haxor one but it doesnt work and i cant use  second method since i dont have any Deus ex in my documents on Gog Version.

Could someone just send my The hax0r exe,while mine didnt work perhaps yours will. Im seriously at loss"
Deusex,3dyccx,I-want-a-callisto,2,Mon Jul 20 15:53:38 2015 UTC,"I have the Steam version so I'm not sure what you mean by the ""hax0r exe"". Maybe someone else can help you out with that. But even if you don't have a DX folder in your documents, the third method should work for you. All you need to do is press ""t"" in-game, delete ""say"" and replace it with""set deusex.jcdentonmale bcheatsenabled true"". As I said though, you will have to do that every time you play the game."
Deusex,3dyccx,haunted_ninja,2,Mon Jul 20 16:04:48 2015 UTC,Check for a folder called 'System' wherever you installed Deus Ex. Inside there should be an 'User.ini' file.

Deusex,3dx0hl,I-want-a-callisto,3,Mon Jul 20 16:35:18 2015 UTC,"There's a file type called ""DRM"" within the games' bigfiles. Some of these are associated with particular environments such as Adam's apartment. You can use Gibbed's tools to have a look at whats in the DRM files. As well as textures and some other stuff, there are wave files in there that I'm betting are the ambient sounds you're talking about. Unfortunately I don't know how the extract the wave files from the DRM ones."
Deusex,3dx0hl,mKaelus,4,Mon Jul 20 11:09:58 2015 UTC,Probably. You need to extract the bigfiles on HR folder to find out if you can convert them.   I know you can convert the songs and the voice files because I tried that myself. http://i.cubeupload.com/RBCnLK.png

Deusex,3dx0hl,I-want-a-callisto,2,Mon Jul 20 16:51:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much, this is great! By the way, how exactly are you extracting them? I've been using the Gibbed tools but so far have only been able to unpack BIGFILE.000"
Deusex,3dx0hl,mKaelus,3,Mon Jul 20 17:35:49 2015 UTC,"You have to also unpack the bigfile_English.000. When you see a .mul file, you can double click and open it with the demuxer ""Gibbed.DeusEx3.Demux"" also presented in the Gibbed tools. You have to manually open these 15 at the time if you are doing mass convertions. Then you will get a bunch of FSB files. Most of the websites you google online on how to open these will give you the ""FSB extractor"". Don't use this, its seriously awful. Instead use the ""Ravioli game tools"" from http://www.scampers.org/steve/sms/other.htm#ravioli_download  It lets you open all FSB you want and extract them where you want all at the same time.  Open RExtractor, on the input files you will be able to select many files at the same time (more than 15 for sure), then on the output, just select a folder you want your files to be extracted to. And there you go, you have the sound files.  Since there are many .mul files I usually sort them by ""type"" so the extractions don't get mixed with the .mul files. Then you can simply search the entire folders for "".fsb"", and copy them all to a different folder for maximum organization."

I've been reading here that sometimes deaths you're not related to will not count against pacifist, specially dumb ones like an NPC shooting an explosive barrel and killing others around it. If you had nothing to do with it (as in, you didn't shoot/throw anything when this happened), you might still be in the clear, but there's no way to know until you finish the game, and if it doesn't work, you'll have to play it all over again from that part.  I'd just redo that part and make sure everything goes right. For peace of mind."
Deusex,3dvdi2,flyinthesoup,2,Sun Jul 19 21:51:24 2015 UTC,"thing is, im trying to do pacifist, save the person, and on hardest difficulty. its most likely impossible without an emp"
Deusex,3dvdi2,flyinthesoup,5,Sun Jul 19 22:01:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah I understand, I did that too. The key was to incapacitate the humans before EMPing the bot. Since they move randomly following you, I made sure they were away from the bot when I bombed it, otherwise they can die with the explosion even after being incapacitated. Mine were far from it. You could try luring it away. As long as it's trying to hit you and not the person, you have more time to save said person."
Deusex,3dvdi2,flyinthesoup,2,Sun Jul 19 22:05:10 2015 UTC,well I do have a save from when everyone was knocked out cold and only the bot was left. I tried luring it from the bodies but it wouldnt budge
Deusex,3dvdi2,flyinthesoup,2,Sun Jul 19 22:18:21 2015 UTC,"You don't have any save previous from that scene? When chasing achievements, I suggest saving in a different file everytime, and often, maybe after certain events happen and everything went right, stuff like that. My last run I topped out at the 100 saves and then I had to start deleting the oldest ones to keep going. But at least I could go back if things didn't go right or I wasn't sure.  Check the autosaves and the quicksave files. The game keeps two autosaves and one quicksave if you use it (or the other way around, I don't remember). Maybe there's one that will take you to the start of the scene and you'll be able to redo it."
Deusex,3dvdi2,flyinthesoup,2,Sun Jul 19 22:22:31 2015 UTC,"I made sure to save once everyone was out cold and only the bot remained because getting to that point alone was very frustrating for me haha. I normally have about 10 saves, where any new save overwrites the oldest."
Deusex,3dvdi2,thehellbean,2,Sun Jul 19 22:24:24 2015 UTC,"Hah yeah, it IS frustrating. I've heard a lot of people having the same problem you have, stupid bot exploding and killing people around. I honestly did not have any issues, maybe I just got lucky."
Deusex,3dvdi2,thehellbean,3,Sun Jul 19 22:28:05 2015 UTC,you definitely must have because I was in a good mood before that scene and now I have an unnatural hatred towards robotic quadropods.

Deusex,3ds9sd,ahyuknyuk,7,Sat Jul 18 23:38:06 2015 UTC,"Yep. The project was in fact, even more ambitious than the end product. A lot of stuff that was criticised in the game was only there because of time and budget constraints. The outsourced boss fights, the 'push this button to choose your ending' at the end, their was supposed to be a city hub for Montreal and their were supposed to be even more augmentations.  This is why I'm excited for Mankind Divided. Because they know the flaws of the last game, they've had time and since the last game was well received they probably have a better budget."
Deusex,3ds9sd,pom32456,2,Sun Jul 19 15:42:56 2015 UTC,very interesting!  looks like they had very good planning. I am pretty surprised that they totally embraced the first game since the original is pretty out there...

You could walk around there, talk to people, etc. and get to see what life is like for the rich peeps in Hengsha.

Deusex,3dm4ue,datenwolf,2,Fri Jul 17 16:23:19 2015 UTC,"Ion storm used a heavily modified variant of the then not released Unreal-2 engine for DX:IW and Thief:DS. Both games suffer from the same problems.  To make a long story short, the engine uses multiple threads but lacks to employ proper atomic locking mechanisms; as soon as code starts to run concurrently things break.  This is not a problem as long as you're running on a single core CPU. But these days you'll be hard pressed to find a CPU which doesn't have at least two virtual cores. Which means you'll get concurrency and hence the thing will crash.  There's a simple solution though: Make the game run on only a single CPU core. This so called CPU affinity can be configured in the EXE file header. There's a nice tool called ImageCFG which can set the relevant bitfields. You can download it here, together with a guide on how to use it. https://robpol86.com/guides/ImageCFG/"

I figured out that affinity thing myself rather fast; my solution then was a little wrapper launcher I wrote that would set the CPU affinity on the process group (I have that lying around somewhere – the ImageCFG method is nicer though).   IIRC correctly I did play at a resolution of 1600×1024 then (roughly 16:10). The trick is, that you must configure that very resolution in the engines Default.ini – it's an undocumented feature and IIRC actually the option is not the same as in the regular Unreal Engine, but if you poke around on the game CDs then you can find some forgotten .ini in which these options can be found (on the CDs you can also find a perl script that's being used by the devs to pack up the audio files of the game and years ago I wrote a little C program that allows you to extract all or only selected  parts of these files)."

Deusex,3ddfi4,TaonasB,3,Wed Jul 15 18:09:13 2015 UTC,"I might suggest that approaching a game like Deus Ex from a completionist perspective isn't the best way to go about it. There are so many secrets and hidden areas and side quests and subplots that to experience them all in a single playthrough would be very difficult. More than that, it might be detrimental to the roleplaying aspect, and you might run the risk of becoming so focused on ""ticking all the boxes"" so to speak, that you don't get fully immersed in the world.  One of the best parts of Deus Ex is finding stuff you missed the first time in subsequent playthroughs."

If only there were more games like it."
Deusex,3db02c,Wayrow,2,Wed Jul 15 19:21:10 2015 UTC,"In the Original DX, there's a janitor in a subway station in Paris selling expensive goods/equipment. If you find his journal, you can read that he's been stealing from the police and then use this information against him. Unfortunately, he just sort of gets pissed off and doesn't cut you a deal. You can inform the police, but they're not too interested either, given the bigger problem of gang fighting.  So the mechanic is/was there, it just wasn't really played with.  EDIT: On second thought, the whole thing with finding Gunther or Anna's killphrase(s) is exactly this idea - using stolen information against your opponents. This is more directly related to the plot, however."
Deusex,3db02c,psygnisfive,2,Thu Jul 16 00:39:25 2015 UTC,"This seems more Shadowrun than DX. We get the impression in HR that Jensen is more than well taken care of materially, so looting data for advantage or personal gain seems like something out of Adam's interest.  FWIW if we hack a high security level terminal in HR we get higher XP rewards (Black Hat, etc.), and there are always extra nodes that you can attack for guaranteed XP and/or ¥ bonus.  What would be GREAT to see in MD is a more robust acknowledgment of information gained via emails/terminals in character dialogues. It seemed like this was one of the larger failing points of HR - the more you discovered details about the backstories and secret maneuverings of those around you, the more the Adam you were watching in cutscenes/dialogues fell out of step with the Adam you were in your head. After a while it would get to the point where Adam would 'discover' things we already knew for hours just by reading emails and being attentive.  If MD would create a more fluid situation where the Adam we see directly reacts when he obtains critical information via hacking - thus modifying later character dialogues - it would plug a huge hole in the suspension of disbelief. I realize it's a HUGE ask of the devs, since this would create so many potential forks in the road, but there were a few bombshells in HR that seemed bizarre after Adam either doesn't react, or acts shocked when another character reveals the same news later on."

It would be really easy to overcommit to one reading of his character (given how novels can really get into a character's thoughts) and not let players of the game decide what kind of person they want Jensen to be. It's the same problem with Paul - we already know what kind of person he is, so it would be difficult to make him the protagonist of a game that's really in the spirit of Deus Ex.  Then again, Ben Saxon was the star of a novel and he got his own game, so I'm probably just overthinking it. In any case, I'll definitely reserve judgment until I've actually read it.

Deusex,3d5hp8,eliza__cassan,3,Tue Jul 14 22:59:43 2015 UTC,"“Deus Ex meets District 9″ is how the company described Deus Ex: Mankind Divided [official site] during a demo I attended at E3. Set two years after Human Revolution, Mankind Divided showcases a society still deeply fearful after the Aug Incident where mechanically augmented people turned violent, stripped of self-control after a signal deliberately interfered with their in-built bio-chips. The scale of the incident means augmentations are now viewed with suspicion and augmented people treated as outcasts. Adam Jensen himself is working as a counter-terrorist agent fighting some of the resultant crime. Well. That’s his day job. He secretly believes the task force was set up by the Illuminti for a different purpose and is working to take them down.  “He’s a tool and a weapon,” is executive game director Jean-François Dugas’ analysis of this Adam Jensen.  “In the first game he was more a blue collar kind of guy who got caught in something way bigger than him. Like the famous meme ‘I never asked for this’. But it’s true. The guy was not necessarily going to get augmented, to jump on the band wagon, even though his former employer David Sarif wanted him to do so.  “A big important choice was removed from him. It’s not that he hates [being augmented] but he didn’t choose it. He had to go through a journey to take back what he lost and take responsibility and do something about it. This time around we go for an Adam Jensen that’s fully embracing what he is today. He has a lot of possibilities. He’s a tool and a weapon so what does he choose to do? You know you are a weapon so how are you going to use that.”  According to Dugas the shift towards ownership of his augmentations should be reflected in increased fluidity of gameplay using Jensen’s new abilities. None of what I saw during my trip was hands-on so I couldn’t get a sense of that but it’s an interesting idea and one which was picked up by gameplay director Patrick Fortier.  “He’s the Jensen 2.0 and we have all these cool augmentations,” says Fortier. “How do we make that a little more visceral? A little bit more reactive so you can use a lot of these things really fluidly into combat? There’s a lot of work put into that. Even the low-level stuff like how we frame the weapon and what’s the recoil and the muzzle flash and all those little things that make it feel right. But also moving through the environment, cover to cover, or doing takedowns from cover – all these things so you never have to start fighting with the controller to do what you want to do and to push a little further from Human Revolution.”  The demo showed off a Tesla gun arm, a dash ability, a nano blade (which is essentially a sword thing which fires from your wrist like you’re a stabby Spider-man) a Titan Shield which lets Jensen withstand heavy fire for brief periods of time by way of a cool polygon effect. I ask which augments Dugas and Fortier were most pleased with and why.  “I like the gun arms a lot but I have to be consistent so I’m going to talk about the Icarus Dash,” says Fortier. “It’s a really interesting one because it’s very versatile. Augmentations for me are basically tools of expression for players. That’s how we think about them. How can you use them in creative ways and combine them in different settings and for stealth or combat? The Icarus Dash is a good example of that because you can use it to smash people and clear the way but you can dash straight into cover as well and combine it with the cloaking system and suddenly you have a really powerful tool to go across the environment stealthily or you can use it for exploration and reach hard-to-reach places and be really thorough.”  Dugas, however, is all about those gun arms. “Whether you’re stealthy or combat-oriented you can easily use them on the fly. Those gun arms are not just lethal, they’re also non-lethal so we’re bringing more flexibility into the overall experience. You might want to play combat but it doesn’t mean you want to kill. In the last game you were kind of forced – if you were stealthy you have options to go non-lethally but if you were the combat kind of guy you couldn’t do that so it has more flexibility with that. You can go full combat and still save human lives or you can decide to kill as well or use them in sleath fashion.”  He adds that “the fact that they’re just like a one-two punch kind of thing is really really cool.”  I remember Graham sharing links to just a small fraction of the material the Deus Ex team had been inspired by as they created their game world so I asked about the tech research for Mankind Divided.  “A lot of what you’re talking about – that research – was done on Human Revolution because we looked at a lot of material all over the place and a lot we didn’t use in Human Revolution. The world of Mankind Divided is only 2 years after Human Revolution and in that sense we wanted to keep a continuity so there wouldn’t be a huge gap in terms of what’s new and totally crazy that wasn’t there two years before. It’s continuity and evolution of the things that were existing in Human Revolution. If eventually we do have another game in the series about 6 or 10 years in the future we would try to make that gap bigger to show that time has passed.”"
Deusex,3d5hp8,I-want-a-callisto,3,Mon Jul 13 18:04:08 2015 UTC,"This is where the developer’s approach to world-building comes in.  When an idea comes up there’s a process to go through, questioning how that technology would fit in the world. “How do we justify it?” asks Fortier. “Where are those parts coming from? How’s he recharging it? It needs to make sense in the world. There’s no infinite magical thing. It needs to be rooted in reality.”  I ask whether that’s how Eidos Montreal keep an eye on feature creep. Is it the constant run of questions which stops Jensen becoming some fantastically over-complicated Swiss Army Knife of a man?  “The key is that sometimes you need to come from the fun side – “it would be cool if…” – and then we’ll go into researching in the real world if this would be credible. If it’s credible what would be the recipe to make that for Adam. Of course we’re taking some liberties – we’re a world of fiction – but we are always trying [keep in mind] what’s possible in the real world, whether that’s today or things we know [will happen] tomorrow.”  An element being included in several games I’ve seen at E3 or that I play already is a level editor. Watching the demo person zoom round the game environments, figuring out ways to reach objectives I wonder if giving players that toolset iss something under consideration for Deus Ex.  “It’s something that can be really really interesting depending on the kind of game you’re making,” says Dugas. “This time around we changed the engine. We’re now with the Dawn engine and we had to really rework everything. We wanted to focus on the first reason why you play a Deus Ex game and it’s for the journey. [Not only the] story but the choice and the consequences. We really, really focused on that. I’m not saying it wouldn’t happen in the future – it’s something I would love to see – but we would have to think how we would make it happen and fit the Deus Ex universe.”  Fortier adds, “I think it’s the same mindset we have for multiplayer and things like that. It’s not that it’s not possible within the context of the franchise but if we’re going to tackle something important like that it has to be the main focus of the whole thing and we need the right idea, the right structure.”  Skipping back to the subject of transhumanism which is so central to Deus Ex and to Adam Jensen, I ask about the developer’s mindset when it comes to approaching those subjects in-game, particularly with the extreme societal tensions and segregation brought about by the Aug Incident.  For Dugas it’s about presenting the conflict but staying neutral as developers. “It’s a message about who we are and our angle with that is that we don’t want to be preachy and say this is right, this is wrong,” he says.  Later he adds, “We love to explore those [issues] – whether the promise of augmentations or the segregation and let the player make up their own mind about these subjects, let them explore one angle of the conflict, then the other angle and have them think about those things and come up with their own stuff. I think this is what is important to us – to stay neutral and make sure people have a great experience and if they want to go deeper than that that they have meat to chew on.”  For Fortier this goes back to the world-building. “It’s not gameplay mechanics over a backdrop, it’s world-building. If you think in terms of world-building you have to justify everything. There’s a new technology. How would it be used? Who would be trying to control it? What would this company be trying to do? We have these discussions all the time when we’re adding elements and tools. Who’s using it? Well, that’s a commercial use and that company isn’t doing that so they wouldn’t do it that way so it’s not going to look like that and they’d have a portable version which would look different… All those discussions happen all the time. I think that’s ultimately what comes across in the game, it’s not just an excuse to shoot or hide, it’s a real world that deals with real topics and you can see the offshoot of all the shades of grey and all the consequences of that throughout the whole world.”  We’ve been speaking vaguely about transhumanism as if it’s this universally understood concept but the reality is that it means different things to different people. Same with augmentations – I’ve been to a few art exhibitions and talks on the subject and the point at which enhancements or technological developments interfere with whether you are considered “pure” varies wildly depending on who you talk to. I ask whether Eidos Montreal has to come to an internal consensus on the point at which someone would be a non-natural human.  The answer I get is more about how in Mankind Divided the society prefers a binary approach – augmented or not.  Trying to inch closer to the studio (or the game’s) cut off point for being a natural human I was going to work through a number of potential augmentations to see what would put you in the augmented camp. I started with something I’d consider super low-key and low-risk assuming we might work along a gradient to find the tipping point. “If somebody had had laser eye surgery would that put them in the augmented camp?” It turns out to be a short trip to that tipping point.  “They would be in the camp for augmented people because obviously they have something – even though it’s technically inoffensive,” explains Dugas. “The fear is not rational. When you fear something you’re not in the rational world anymore. You’re building this construct around you and you put everything into the same socket whether it belongs there or not. It’s one of the problems with seeing things in absolutes.”  “The impression is probably worse for people that have very visibly easy-to-identify augmentations. Anything that looks different,” adds Fortier. “What ultimately happened at the end of Human Revolution is there was the Aug Incident and everyone who was augmented was hacked into and went nuts. They killed people and killed themselves. They lost control of themselves and everybody in the world was a witness to that event or suffered in their own family or friends or were hurt in a close way. That’s where all the fear came from and the truth never really fully came out.  “Rumours, people trying to manipulate the truth, people hiding the truth, people choosing not to hear the truth – like in real life. That’s what led to this climate and then it obviously served the purpose of some people to dig that wedge between them and the people. But it’s very tangible what happened. It’s not just hearsay. They saw it and with the irrational fear it doesn’t matter how you were augmented, you were a victim of the Aug Incident.There was that backdoor that was exploited and you went nuts like everyone else.”  We have time for one more question so to round off I ask about Adam specifically. Dugas referred to him as a tool and a weapon so my question is about how Jensen sees himself at this point – is this a man with a balanced view or has he stopped seeing himself as human at all.  “From my point of view I think it just came – how do you say that – he came into an age?” says Dugas. “He came to maturity in the sense that he knows he has these powers and abilities, his body has obviously changed, and I think he came to peace with that. Now he decides to use it for the greater good but also for his personal quests like the score he couldn’t settle in the first place. He’s that kind of character. If you were talking with Mary Demarle – she’s one of the key [people] behind the creation of Adam Jensen – she might have a different spin on it but from my own perspective that’s how I see that character. I think that character is going to rest when he finds what he is looking for.”"

When all your body is replaced and what's still yours is just your brain, you depend on that one. Adult humans' brains don't renew as other cells in the body, or they have a very limited capacity to do so (they do, however, create new neural paths with what they already have). If for some reason they do have that tech, then I can't see why they wouldn't be able to live virtually forever. Any other body part/organ can be either fixed or replaced/augmented.  I can't find it on Google now, but I read long time ago about the issue of entropy of a living creature, on the body and on the lived experiences/willingness to keep living. The fact that you could live 500 years doesn't mean you'd want to. Some people say that we're ""programmed"" to die because of mental fatigue. Maybe it's not true."

For a hurt, and in a way, defeated Jensen to kindle a relationship with Malik would undo what drive he had to rescue Megan and undermine, in my eyes, much of the DX:HR story (even though her strength as a character was flimsy).  What's great about Malik and Jensen is that they are both true professionals with nothing but respect for one another. In DX:MD, I'm hoping to see both of them question that professionalism, but in a different way."

Deusex,3czl3w,Muffinsteeze,8,Sun Jul 12 05:30:17 2015 UTC,"JC's origins are muddled in the game. In Area 51, a datacube reveals JC's date of inception as March 17, 2054, with an ""assigned birth date"" of March 17, 2029. Since Deus Ex takes place in 2052 this would mean JC is physically 23 years old (this is supported by the fact Morpheus mentions JC is 23), and he was growth accelerated to his biological age. This would be assuming that the inception date was incorrect. This leaves no room for most of his original backstory, unless the acceleration was somehow irregular or his memories are in fact false (which raises serious questions about his relationship with Paul). Another datacube contains an email about ""creating genetically viable candidates for nano-augmentation through cloning"", speculating that ""in the future, this process could be streamlined through the application of accelerated growth and memory implantation"", which lends some credence to this theory.  This leaves open the possibilities that JC and/or Paul are the result of such a process (and that all references to their past and their parents are forged) or that the datacube with JC's age (and the appearance of fully-grown clones in tubes) is simply an inconsistency introduced by development of the game. Given the complexity of the plot of Deus Ex and its numerous twists, neither can be discounted.   Source"

Paul and JC were ""born"" as children and raised in a normal timeframe, but MJ12 were preparing to create a replacement JC, perhaps after they defected. Presumably they would use them against the Illuminati and other organizations who considered JC an ally.  It only looks empty because the clone is so early in development, since JC only defected a few days ago or something. Presumably it would take a couple years to grow to JC's age."
Deusex,3czl3w,PrinceCheddar,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:42:45 2015 UTC,"Well, they could just make it weird and go with his inception being in 1954 and he just grows really slowly.

The floral patterns on the shoulders aren't over-accentuated (which I can imagine might not be everyone's preference), and the inner lining and Sarif tag are just plain cool as hell for anyone who HAS played HR.  The downside? The packaging means you'll receive a crumpled heap of a coat, and you want to be VERY careful if you choose to iron it.  That aside - I'm really happy with it.

Rainbow coloring might be because Classic Lighting is disabled (that's what happens when textures are given too much light.

The artist did not know ( so he claims), but that doesn't really change the fact that some did not volunteer.  Amazing but oh so creepy."

Deusex,3cpt6c,SpotNL,4,Fri Jul 10 13:34:05 2015 UTC,I don't think the point of the room is to be an exhibit at all. It's at a black research site. It's more like a test/demo room for the gear Namir is wearing.
Deusex,3cpt6c,AdamJensensCoat,6,Fri Jul 10 07:21:27 2015 UTC,"The room looks too decorative to be a test room, though--if that were the case I'd expect it to feel a little more clinical. Plus, they're all on pedestals. Maybe not an exhibit, but kind of a showroom?"
Deusex,3cpt6c,magicwhistle,6,Fri Jul 10 11:19:08 2015 UTC,I think it's 90% down to 'rule of cool' - it's stated in the DC commentary that these exhibits were the inspiration for Namir's design. Then the idea was to use the bodies as camouflage for Namir during the boss fight.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU8r__PxGOg
Deusex,3cpt6c,kevio17,2,Fri Jul 10 11:27:37 2015 UTC,"Happened to have a save state of the room so I looked around. It's actually very lab/test-room like but with trademark DX cool lighting fixtures and some filigree detail. Each statue is labeled 'corpus 1, 2, etc.' The takeaway from the room is that whatever tech they developed at this black site has been used to engineer Namir's abilities - connecting a couple dots beween Tai Young, the Mercs and the Illuminati."
Deusex,3cpt6c,AdamJensensCoat,2,Sat Jul 11 05:05:45 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot of sense! I have a feeling Megan worked on improving Namir's augs, which would explain why she seems to be on friendly terms with him (I'm not buying the ""they had a relationship"" theory)."

You can side with one faction in one mission, and piss off the other. In the next mission, that doesn't matter anymore: both factions approach you as if nothing happened.  I understand the difficulty of building out a true branching story system, but there's very little wrong with a linear story. Linear levels suck, yes, but linear stories in games work quite well. IW should not have been marketed as ""player choices matter"" title when they blatantly did not (and seeing all four endings took about 15 minutes of replaying the last level)."

As long as the game doesn't outright contradict what you've just done then it can still continue on the same narrow path and leave you to enjoy the story you created in your own head.  I don't remember the specific scenarios you're talking about but I also don't remember any jarring discrepancies. It's possible if both sides still approach you it's because they're desperate and can't afford to piss you off further."

My PC is a laptop with an i5, 6 gb of ram and a Radeon 6470 graphics card. Those specs don't really cut it for current gen gaming so I need a replacement. I am currently torn between getting/building a decent desktop and getting a PS4.  I could either get the PC and an old used ps3 for the games I mentioned. Or I could get a PS4, it has an HD remake of the Last of Us, maybe someday an HD remake of Red Dead Redemption... I doubt it will ever have a remake of L.A. Noir."

If I had to recommend a plan, though I would say get a 360 for RDR and LA Noir. 360s tend to be cheaper than PS3s nowadays.  A PS4 will get you The Last of us but you can grab 1 PS3 and get all games on that console. I always enjoyed my PS3 more than the 360, anyway.  Ive found the best setup, for me anyway, is I do the bulk of my gaming on my PC and I keep a console, usually PS3, around to play exclusives.  Once the current gen consoles get better libraries it can be justified to get one but from what I can tell the games youve been really waiting to play are all availavle on last gen which makes it far less painful on your wallet."

Although the whole thing probably shouldn't be regarded as canon, the original DX continuity bible describes MJ12's successful bid for power as taking place in 2035. 2029 is close enough for Jensen to at least influence it.

They reject the idea, so he takes over and creates MJ12.  So the grey death must be complete or almost complete in a lab somewhere during the events of Mankind Divided."
Deusex,3cjtm9,I-want-a-callisto,10,Wed Jul 8 15:28:06 2015 UTC,"Stanton Dowd says ""It was Bob Page who wanted to develop [nanites] into a weapon."" - that makes it sound like Dowd knew about this when Page was still in the Illuminati. However, remember that initially Dowd has no idea who's behind the Gray Death. It takes Tong finding Page's ""signature"" on the Gray Death nanites to confirm he's responsible. So I'm guessing that while Page had proposed the idea before the coup, actual work didn't start on it until afterwards. It doesn't really make sense for Page to procrastinate using it until the 2050s if he already had it developed right after the coup.  One other thing that I'd like to mention since I see a few people saying it here: the ""nanite virus chimera"" isn't necessarily referring to the Gray Death. Regular nanites are essentially a viral protein shell with nano-machines inside it. If you were to stretch the definition (and its REALLY a stretch since neither nano-machines nor viruses are alive), this could be described as a ""chimera"" of a virus and the nano-machines i.e a nanite virus chimera. It just doesn't make sense for Megan to be 100% chill and interested in the Gray Death when 5 mins beforehand she was telling Adam to go stop the Panchaea signal so people wouldn't get hurt. It's way more likely that it's alluding to nanites being used for nano-augmentation (Hence why the achievement is ""The D Project"").  But going back to your original post, yeah I think the possibility of that happening is likely. It would be disheartening as a player to go around battling the Illuminati and making no impact whatsoever. I reckon we will see it weakening but won't be aware of the fact that we're playing right into the hand of Bob Page (until it's too late at least). I'd love to see that happen anyway!"
Deusex,3cjtm9,gepardcv,3,Wed Jul 8 17:43:31 2015 UTC,"Megan has a willful blindness streak which Page would have easily recognized and exploited. It would have been easy for him to enlist her to work on nanotech and nanoaugs in general, and keep the Gray Death plans from her."

We already know Page is working on the Gray Death from HR-he and Megan speak about the ""nanite-virus chimera"" in the post-credits sequence.  EDIT: I'd be shocked if they aren't consulting the DX1 bible for ideas, given the overall atmosphere of Mankind Divided and this bit from the bible:   ""Despite the effectiveness, and in some cases, the necessity of body modification, augmented humans are considered monsters. They look like primitive Borg and are widely feared by humans. The nano-augmented characters (like the player) are the first augmented humans who can ""pass."" To look at one, you might not even notice he or she is not a full human. This creates a tension among the three types of humans: Total humans consider themselves pure and are at the top of the heap. They need augmented humans but fear and distrust them. Most total humans don't even know nano-augmented humans exist.  Mechanically augmented humans have their own airport security systems and have to register with government authorities. They are second-class citizens, looked down upon even by the non-augmented poor. There's no way a mechanically augmented human can pass for normal for very long. They're not allowed in certain locations and have separate facilities, ostensibly tailored to their unique needs but really as a way of controlling them.  Nano-augmented humans are resented by their mechanically augmented brothers and sisters. They're as powerful as mechanically augmented humans but suffer none of the stigma associated with augmentation. They can pass through airport security and mingle with humans freely."""

Deusex,3cjtm9,coldfire201,3,Wed Jul 8 16:31:39 2015 UTC,My theory is that Janus (two headed god) is Page playing both sides. Definitely could be that the reason for helping adam is because he wants to make a power grab.

I've always wanted to build my own printer from scratch or from a kit, but I'd be concerned about making sure it's all calibrated perfectly, especially since they print on the micron level.  Yeah, getting the frame to stick to your head would be tricky. A temporary solution would be to use some non-toxic adhesive that could easily come off later. A slightly more extreme solution would be to get magnets implanted in the appropriate areas and then embed magnets in the frame so they stick with no effort. I have heard of people getting magnets implanted in their hands and fingers, but I'm not sure if anyone has done that to their face lol."

Deusex,3c9c5g,yth684,22,Mon Jul 6 02:41:46 2015 UTC,"Probably no need. Here's my educated guess:  Believe it or not, DE:HR is actually Eidos Montreal's launch title, which usually means limited scope, fund and manpower. The DC of DE:HR includes revamped boss-fights, and integrated the Missing Link DLC, which happened between Hengsha and Singapore, into the main game chronically. All of which seems to be things that they missed out first because they ran out of fund, or time, or both. Regardless, DE:HR is considered a classic, which probably means they have significantly more time and money this time. So unless they're announcing DLC plans, which they haven't, there's probably no point waiting for a Director's Cut for Mankind Divided."
Deusex,3c9c5g,helmstif,5,Mon Jul 6 03:39:14 2015 UTC,"To add to this (and I bring this up a LOT on this sub, purely for the fact that I love it) they built their own modified game engine to create Mankind Divided. The engine they used for Human Revolution, as anyone who's listened to the director's commentary knows, was so limiting to their vision, and really dragged them down. Honestly, the fact that they still created a great game when their vision sounded like such a cut above is a testament to what a great team this is. And the fact that the same core team is working on MD? Fugghedaboudit! It's going to be fantastic from the get go, I'm certain. Perhaps a little dangerous to be so optimistic, so sue me, but as someone else said, if and when a director's cut of MD is released, you'll get a discount for owning the ""original"" game anyway, so you might as well get it on launch day and enjoy the ride with the rest of us.  That said, please don't pre-order! Even with a game in a beloved franchise, with a game that looks as good as Mankind Divided does so far, it sends the wrong message from the consumer to the industry saying ""if you hype us up enough, we'll give you money before you're finished"", which can lead to diminished potential in the final products being shoved out the door. The dev team for DX is great. Publishers in the gaming industry? Mmmmmnot s'much."
Deusex,3c9c5g,analogfrequency,3,Mon Jul 6 21:13:01 2015 UTC,"I can't tell you what to buy, but it ultimately depends on how excited you are to play the game. I will be getting it day 1. If you can wait 12+ months for an edition that might never be released anyway, then wait."
Deusex,3c9c5g,Zoett,3,Mon Jul 6 03:41:25 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. The main reason for the directors cut was to fix the boss fights, which were terrible because they were outsourced to another company. As long as Eidos Montreal handle it themselves,  they should be fine this time."
Deusex,3c9c5g,Lacasax,3,Mon Jul 6 05:49:22 2015 UTC,"You could, but I bet that if they make a DC of MD, they will probably have the same kind of deal they had on HR, where you could upgrade for anywhere from $5 to $20, depending on what content you already had purchased."
Deusex,3c9c5g,Mulatto_Fury,3,Mon Jul 6 12:35:31 2015 UTC,DX HR Director's Cut was released 2 years after the original game so I don't think the wait is worth it. There may not even be a director's cut unless the game is broken like the Human Revolution.

Deusex,3c87ij,icyflamez96,31,Sun Jul 5 20:33:52 2015 UTC,"I think DXHR delivers its plot in stages; once a mystery is solved, Adam finds something out, which points him in a new direction and the previous question ceases to be relevant.   For instance, you spend a while trying to figure out who/where Arie van Bruggen is, but once you find him and he tells you about Tai Yong he ceases to be relevant and all that effort you put into digging him up is forgotten."
Deusex,3c87ij,Lankles,3,Sun Jul 5 23:15:08 2015 UTC,I hope they do a bit more with the supporting characters in Mankind Divided in general. Spend more time on the antagonists and have a bigger cast of recurring neutral and friendly characters. It was one of the things that made the original Deus Ex work so well.
Deusex,3c87ij,hobocactus,15,Mon Jul 6 12:59:36 2015 UTC,"The FEMA stuff is more like a nod to those familiar with the future of the universe in the original Deus Ex game.  You may have done six playthroughs, but what you need is one solid playthrough reading all the emails on all of the computers.  The universe as viewed through HR is not only wide, but deep, and without the full picture you end up with lots of unexplored threads.  I didn't play the original DX until a few years ago, but I knew of its influence and the general plot, including various themes including corporate subterfuge, human advancement, and such.  Of course, 2000 was a very different time for gaming and it's hard to imagine games like that coming out now.  I honestly didn't expect HR to deliver such a substantial helping of thematic depth as it did.  In short, invest the time to explore those murky depths and your effort will be rewarded in kind."

Deusex,3c87ij,Never-asked-for-this,3,Mon Jul 6 10:13:28 2015 UTC,"It's the type of game that you've to play multiple times to get the full pic. Multiple subplots, references, and allusions are crammed in every email & pocket secretary that are littered throughout the game."
Deusex,3c87ij,robotroller,3,Mon Jul 6 07:18:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's something really strange about the storytelling in HR. I read all pocket secretaries and e-mails every time I play, listen to NPCs and so on... yet it's so easy to forget what should be simple plot points. In a way, it's fun because there is always something new to discover/connect/be reminded of, and I suppose that's what's kept me digging for more info and trivia for years. And then it makes me feel stupid when someone asks what should be a simple plot question and I go ??? because it gets so convoluted sometimes."
Deusex,3c87ij,eliza__cassan,6,Mon Jul 6 20:59:04 2015 UTC,"The story and setting is pretty in depth but I can't help but think it wasn't told in the best way and I can't even figure out why. It makes  me appreciate how difficult it is to world build and tell a story like this and how much the original nailed it.  Half way though the game I forgot who Darrow is, I only met him once and after that there was all this jibberish in journals and some tv interviews about his 'project'. You're absorbing a lot of information at this point and are a bit to concerned with the immediate conspiracy to worry about a character you met for 30 seconds in a cutscene.  sandoval too, becuause of the nature of the game for the entire 2nd act I'm pretty sure his only name dropped.  They use the 'find the girl trope' that may as well not exist as it turns into a wild goose chase to help sarrif;  rescue typhoon - [secret aug conspiracy] get the chip [corrupt police conspiracy] - track signal to Fema (via some Detroit gang) [some sort of commentary here]-  Barret (gives up a location) - go china - track signal (i think)-  hacker is hiding -get to Tong [is he good or bad?]- find hacker- follow his clue...etc etc.  All while wondering what the hell is going on, not knowing anyones true intentions or even Jensen's hidden backstory. His genetics end up being the catalyst of the entire story and its hidden being a secret side mission.  You definitely need a 2nd/3rd playthroughs  The game is loaded with commentary and conspiracies and different viewpoints on augments too, but it doesn't have a central bad guy to focus on throughout or knowable 'bad thing' to stop.   Mass effect- stop saren. uncharted- get to the treasure before the bad guy. HR - follow the next clueee (oh yh revenge for megan is supposed to be our motivator)"
Deusex,3c87ij,pick-a-spot,7,Mon Jul 6 06:40:18 2015 UTC,"I think it lacked an emotional center, rather than a 'main mission'. We got a main mission, it's just so easily forgotten because the way the main character feels about it, depends a lot on the choices you make and how you make him respond to certain things. You don't really get a whole lot of insight into Jensen's mindset, with some exception that you may or may not get depending on your choices.  Memories are very much tied to emotions and if there isn't one strong, over-arching emotion, you lose the connection to the main objective and instead focus on the current, since that affects you immediately (emotionally, physically as a manner of speaking). The game doesn't remind you enough of what you're moving towards.  I think this is both a pro and a con of the game though, because on your first playthrough you kind of rush through it (well, I did) with little consideration for the long-term consequences, and it makes the ending more powerful. On the second you can maul things over a lot more and actually realize what people are really saying around you, on the streets, through the news, behind their own words, etc."
Deusex,3c87ij,Ebu-Gogo,7,Mon Jul 6 09:07:31 2015 UTC,Yh the 'find/avenge megan' angle was half arsed. Your character had one elevator journey with her.   And then you talked to her mum.   It's like they were going to make that the 'emotional centre' and then dropped it.   Compare that to max Payne.. Where you have entire dream levels and max Payne narrating how pissed about it he is.   The other emotional centre would have been jensen being heavily augmented against his will. The trailer and one conversation with Malik touched on this but then it's never mentioned again... Until the ending where the game decided how good or evil you were.   Even dishonoured had a better go at this.. Even though they fell short due to different reasons
Deusex,3c87ij,pick-a-spot,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:56:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think any of the issues center around there not being a central bad guy or the lack of a classical narrative structure - what made DX so special was that you found yourself in the middle of a power struggle between multiple parties, all whom are mostly concerned with maintaining their global preeminence. It makes sense that you're chasing ghosts half the time.  That said, were a few huge narrative flaws with HR that prevented the game from being ridiculously engrossing. I've played through the game 5ish times now and every time it bugged me more - especially since so much of the world is so well realized and the plot is a pretty good mouse trap once you read lots of journals, emails and play through The Missing Link.  First - The Megan/Serif intro on rails is a big misfire. There's no reason why the script couldn't have been tweaked to place Adam into the confrontation with the Humanity Front from the jump - using the mission as a way to build initial rapport with Megan. We would understand the nature of the relationship and then feel why Adam is invested in her later on. The original DX did something similar, putting you in the liberty island mission right away, building your relationship with Paul while the mission progressed, then revealing the larger world that Denton inhabits afterwards. It gave you perfect context to JC's relationships and immediately established the friction between Pauls' POV and that of UNATCO.   Second - When Serif introduces the Illuminati idea to Adam at his apartment it's handled in the laziest way possible. Serif goes from trying to handle a crisis of trust with Adam to making broad sweeping statements about how 'they' have had a role in every major world event and basically control the earth. The subject is only brushed upon for a moment - then the subject switches to Taggart. The problem with this is that the game misses a huge step were where Serif should define what his thoughts are on the Illuminati subject - who does he think they are, what does he believe they want and what does he want to do about it? Did they just want to stop him from dominating the aug market or does he think there's another layer to all this? This moment adds up to you going on a wild good chase for a boss who isn't sure what he wants...  The lazy handling of the Illuminati persists for the rest of the game. We see obvious Illuminati symbols below Picus, but Adam never talks about it. This should have been an obvious spot for Adam to take notice and say 'holy fucking shit, this is an Illuminati controlled news center? No way.'  Third - The relationship between Hugh Darrow and Zhao Yun is never established though it is important as they're both working behind the scenes on some big shit, at least semi-collaboratively.  Forth - The 3rd act is awful. We only learn that Hugh Darrow has a crazy comic-book villain plan when we meet him face to face - upon which he gives us his life story - and later we discover that Zhao Yun has been plotting to interface with the organic supercomputer at the bottom of Panchea so that she can... become omnipotent?  The problem is - especially with Darrow. That we've established almost nothing of their character or motive until we've actually met them face to face - we get the entire story all in one blob. Would have been nice to know that they had these nefarious plans while we were actually making our way to them so we'd know what's at stake and feel a sense of urgency.   And I realize it's asking a lot for a story like HR to gel, since the main narrative has so many spokes. But DX was able to pull this off by giving the audience a little more credit and having smart characters like the Daedalus and Icarus AIs give voice to the big picture motives that are shaping the events around you."

Deusex,3c87ij,Royness,2,Mon Jul 6 07:55:34 2015 UTC,"I definitely get all the companies and important people mixed up. Darrow, Serif, Tai Yong Medical, I have no continuing idea of who they are, what they do, or their motivations. About the only things in the game I can keep straight is Jensen, Megan, and Malik. I just concentrate on sneaking through levels and hacking through the security, who and what doesn't matter to me much (which is weird because I love diving into the lore of a single player story. I don't do multiplayer)"
Deusex,3c87ij,brent1123,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:35:02 2015 UTC,"Interesting thing is that while your in derelict row tracking down that signal, in the room before the ladder to the antenna, if you listen to the conversation between the two gang members they discuss how they only get news on their TV. The other one says that its been like that ever since he let a Purity First guy up on the roof. Thought that was interesting because right off the bat you know purity first is just a proxy of something greater ( the Humanity Front and therefore the group of leaders Taggart speaks of in panchea by extension.) Its amazing how easy it is to connect all the organizations once you play though enough times and pay attention to the details."

Deusex,3c7y7v,SientoTwo,5,Sun Jul 5 19:12:54 2015 UTC,"I thought this was an interesting video. I'm not sure if I agree with his assertion that the violent mechanics are more ""fun"" than the stealth mechanics. I agree that this was the case for Dishonored, but there you had a lot more opportunities to cause crazy and fun mayhem than in Human Revolution. For Deus Ex: HR I think which one you find more fun depends on whether you prefer a more action-oriented or a more planned-tactical approach.  I do think he has a valid point with his criticism of the ""Mechanical Apartheid"" theme. It seems very constructed, and not very realistic to happen. I mean yeah, there could be tensions between augmented and non-augmented people. It's just really unlikely that they play out like in the new Deus Ex games. The people who would immediately benefit the most from augmentation are those who hold most of the power - rich people who want to enhance their own abilities, capitalists who want to use augmented workers, people in industrialized welfare societies whose lives can be saved with this technology. These people all would have an interest in making augmentation as well-accepted as possible. I cannot imagine how anyone could think it a good idea to open a ghetto in Prague for augmented people in the near future.  What's regrettable about this is that it does not enable actual discussion abot the ethical and moral implications of transhumanism. Apartheid has absolutely nothing to do with transhumanism. There isn't even an interesting debate to be had about it independently of transhumanism. Apartheid has been tried, and collectively deemed as shitty. To me it seems like an alibi buzzword thrown into the game for it to appear ""deep"", along with the Icarus symbolism and whatnot. But this is a far cry from the original Deus Ex with its Gunther Herman story arc, or the conversations with the AIs."
Deusex,3c7y7v,decapodw,3,Sun Jul 5 20:43:41 2015 UTC,"I think HR's idea was to think of ways the whole 'upper class = augmented' tendency can backfire. Augs bite people in the ass due to neuropozene dependency and the backlash from the un-augmented majority  And on top of that, augmentation isn't necessarily a rich thing either, the gangs in hengsha are more like aug-scavengers, not rich at all.. edit: and construction workers augmented as part of their contracts.. im not sure how well off they were."

Deusex,3c7y7v,Webemperor,2,Sun Jul 5 19:38:10 2015 UTC,Care to elaborate?
Deusex,3c7y7v,3Nerd,3,Sun Jul 5 21:31:57 2015 UTC,"Was about to sleep then, so I couldn't write anything.  The second thing he talks about is full of wrong things. The game never tells you that being augmented is a bad thing essentially. It creates two sides of the arguements. In Detroit there people who mostly critisize you for your augmentations, while in Hengsha it's the opposite. Alot of people you talk talk about how badass your augmentations look. The game constantly forces you to think if your augmentations are a curse or a blessing.   Sure, you can punch through walls, jump down from any height and not die, but what cost? You no longer retain your flesh, you are no longer sure what you might feel is even real or not. You can no longer even be sure if the thoughts going about in your mind are real, or just created by the biochip tugged inside your brain, or if even what you see, what you hear is real, or if they are fabrications of many modifications inside your body. Game doesn't force these down your throat, but mentions them, like in your arguement with Taggart.  Also, the guy mentions that, economically, augmented people shouldn't be opressed, but instead revered. If he paid attention, alot of character already mention that only a small fraction of people that augmented, actually augmented because they wanted to. Most of them are forced into this situation by their governments, employers and such. Veterans, workers of all kinds are forced to get augmented if they want to still continue their line of work. You can actually both this and what I mentioned above in the sidequest Talion A.D, which we talk with an ex-soldier who was forced to get augmented and now hunts down the very person he trusted his body to, because they distorted his thoughts, his visions using augmentations. Game in fact hilariously, makes it seem that from outside, says that only people who don't think too much about what we are or why we exist or if what we see is real or not think augmentations are super badass and super cool.  And besides, it's mentioned several times that it's not augmentations itself that are expensive, but neuropozynes. Additionally, the guy just assumes that all augmentations are like Jensen's, when in fact majority of Jensen's augmentations are purely experimental, even some of them created on spot for Jensen by Sarif. We are constantly forced to see how being this heavily augmented causes our character to be less human and more of a living breathing warmachine, created for the sole purpose of revenge and obeying his CEO's orders. Game multiple times talks about how many people woke up in a surgery table, remembering nothing, with augmentations grafted on their body.  For the part where he talks about game mechanics, that is purely but purely opinion. He says that how game makes being a super badass with explosives coming out of your body cool, for him. Another person might think that hacking an entire security grid and turning turrets and robots against your enemies, or being able to go invisible and walking right next to your enemies, laughing at their faces seem cool. It's purely opinion."

Deusex,3c59bn,totally_a_red_pyro,3,Sun Jul 5 06:58:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I am going to check this out.   I like the simplified art style. Too much of cyberpunk is muddled, busy (and thus ugly) art that doesn't really pay attention to the elements that matter. Art doesn't have to look like a byzantine contraption to be appropriate and stylish (not primitive).   This game seems to understand what makes something appealing and focuses on the elements. I like it, it's a different direction than the race for graphical superiority that often leaves gameplay as a flagging secondary matter."
Deusex,3c59bn,Rasalom,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:50:22 2015 UTC,"I adore this game. The game plays more like thief than Deus Ex, but since they're cut from the same cloth, there are similarities. The plot & retro/future cyberpunk vibe is more deus ex, though. Oh, and the main character's initials are JC. : )   Don't go into it expecting something of the scale of Deus Ex. The game is smaller in scope, not as grand, but I think that's by design. There's a minimalism expressed, not just as it relates to the visuals. I think it tries to ""do more with less"" & succeeds. And the soundtrack is exceptional.   It has been confirmed that the game will support custom player made levels at some point in the future. Looking forward to seeing what the community comes up with."

Deusex,3c4j4l,BrassDragon,9,Sat Jul 4 18:33:22 2015 UTC,"In which game?  In Human Revolution you can accidentally kill knocked out NPCs by dragging their body too violently and/or throwing them into things too much. After you move any body, aim at them so the search tooltip shows. If there's a skull icon, they're dead. If there's a ""zzZ"" icon, they're fine.  In Deus Ex 1 there are actually very few non-lethal weapons. You can knock people out using the baton, the riot prod, or the mini crossbow tranq darts. The tranq darts don't take effect immediately, and the victim usually alerts everybody else in the mean time, so I would avoid using it in most circumstances. The riot prod has limited ammo. The baton won't knock out tough enemies in one hit unless you level your melee to advanced and invest in the combat strength aug.  There aren't many ways to accidentally kill people in DX1 though. And, after the first few missions, the game doesn't care whether you kill or not. The only way offhand that I can think I've accidentally killed NPCs is with LAMs. LAMs are really useful for opening locked doors, cabinets, etc. I often use them to blow open an entire room worth of lockers, etc. But the explosion can go through walls, so beware of any unsuspecting NPCs on the floors above and below.  Edit: I realize you're probably talking about the achievement, and Human Revolution. Whoops lol"

Deusex,3c2i8z,themanclaw,6,Sat Jul 4 03:51:47 2015 UTC,"""Good"" is subjective, especially in regards to storytelling. An ending which raises questions about Jensen's morality (and, by extension, that of the player) is no less ripe for narrative than one which highlights a morally pure route - which would likely be just as complex and nuanced.   While there will likely be some incentive to take a pacifist approach (in my eyes, a remarkably forward-thinking design choice), this is an intelligent studio, and there's no reason to believe the split will be as simple as ""killing is bad, not killing is good.""  Also note: there have been a few developer quotes suggesting that non-lethal options will not be limited to stealth. Rubber bullets have been questionably absent in previous games, but will probably make an appearance here - along with some more futuristic ammo possibilities. I personally am looking forward to both the combat challenges and story potential of pacifist combat, as it's a big frontier for game design which many studios are reluctant to explore.  This game has the potential to not only offer a (somewhat unprecedented) true pacifist route, but to be the first to really highlight the moral complexity of killing. From a narrative standpoint, that is enormous - and any concerns that the game might limit player freedom should be dwarfed by the fact that this choice is being offered in the first place."
Deusex,3c2i8z,neon-tarkus,3,Sat Jul 4 23:37:35 2015 UTC,"""Agressive Non-Leathal Combat"" is a compelling idea. We had bits of this in HR with the PEPS gun and concussion mines/grenades — but overall the non-lethal combat approach required you to use weapons that were slow and ineffective. Using the PEPS gun in a firefight for instance was impossible because of the slow reload combined with the amount of energy cells you need for takedowns.  It will be interesting to see if MD opens the possibility of a non-leathal guns blazing play style. From the looks of the play demo it seems like there's lots of options that have been opened, but many of them still tilt towards the 'slip around unnoticed and don't sound the alarm' mindset."
Deusex,3c2i8z,AdamJensensCoat,2,Thu Jul 9 02:20:04 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not, the PEPS is easily my favorite weapon to break out in a firefight - precisely because its usefulness is so limited that finding an opportunity to take anyone out with it becomes much more satisfying. I realize this makes me part of a gaming minority, but I'll almost always take an awkward, impractical weapon over something versatile like an assault rifle, because I enjoy the challenge of adapting to unfamiliar mechanics. Tactical masochism, I guess you could call it.  However, the fact that all of the nonlethal weapons in HR were in this category certainly limited the broader appeal of a pacifist route, especially when coupled with the fact that a no-kill choice made very little impact on the story. The alternate ammo types mean that most, if not all, combat weapons might have a nonlethal application - I will stick with my erratic spy devices if possible, but it's good to know that shotgun/AR playstyles won't be locked out of making kill-or-no-kill decisions.  Back to the original topic: this apparent concern that there will be a ""good"" ending and a ""bad"" one is very 1997. As with most open-ended modern games, there will be different endings for different playstyles, something I can only see as a very good thing. Naturally, anyone who wants to play violently should be free to do so without penalty - but the game will mean more if it emphasizes that as a decision made by the player, and as one more complex than ""did the right thing"" or ""did the wrong thing."""
Deusex,3c2i8z,neon-tarkus,2,Thu Jul 9 18:15:10 2015 UTC,Rubber bullets that are compatible with lots of the standard issue pistols and automatics would be a really cool change. Sometimes you want the take the game's implied moral high ground without having to sneak around everybody.
Deusex,3c2i8z,AdamJensensCoat,2,Fri Jul 10 05:23:18 2015 UTC,"Not only that: these don't necessarily have to be a realistic modern depiction of rubber bullets. Emphasis on the rubber.  A ricochet mechanic could make them a lot more than mere ""bullets for pacifists."" A bouncing projectile with chances for multiple impact has some interesting strategic potential - as luring enemies into tight corners becomes more rewarding than engaging in the open."
Deusex,3c2i8z,neon-tarkus,9,Fri Jul 10 17:34:04 2015 UTC,"I was listening to the post-E3 Co-optional Podcast a while ago, and here's how Jesse Cox described his DE:MD demo playthrough:   Everyone else there were playing it guns blazing, except him who did it the Deus Ex way and stealthed his way through. In the end of demo, where Jensen was suppose to persuade a rebel leader person to end the violence and surrender, everyone else got the ending where the rebel leader called Jensen a hypocrite, because he killed his way in, and committed suicide. Except for Jesse's playthrough, where the rebel leader actually surrendered.  So yeah, seems like you do have to be a pacifist to get the ending where key people survive. And I have no problem with that."

Deusex,3c2i8z,ChromeGhost,-3,Mon Jul 20 05:29:22 2015 UTC,"On one hand it makes sense, on the other, it penalizes people for playing the way that many would consider the most fun, which the developers have provided extensive mechanics for. I think they should have done it in such a way that you can go about the combat the way in which you find the most enjoyable, without that changing the story.  That's just my opinion."
Deusex,3c2i8z,dvdkon,24,Sat Jul 4 05:04:49 2015 UTC,It just makes sense that a person will be angry if you kill a lot of their friends/mercenaries and will be impressed if you manage to suddenly stand next to them without any alarms (in a highly guarded area). I think ignoring such obvious consequences of player choice is both stupid and unlike Deus Ex.

But when we are talking about good and bad endings you can't seriously ever expect that killing people will ever lead you into a good ending, at least if you aim for decent writing.  I mean when you kill these guards you potentially kill human beings who just want to earn an income because they of possible reasons such as: they have their own family to provide for, sick parents, alone.(but that doesn't remove the possibilities that they have typical desires such as they want to have a family or something that's innocent.)  That's just a part of a perspective of course and not every side of it all. But if we are playing a RPG with at least decent writing. Those examples I mentioned are relevant to what defines an ""evil"" or ""good"" player. Do you decide to take the simple way and end these peoples lives that you don't know about and you got no true justified reasons to do it other than you can't bother to try find a more humanistic (if that is the right word) approach. Or do you decide to consider the possibilities that some of those guards are just the average Joe trying to make a living and instead you try to do a more difficult approach that leaves those average people alive?  That should always be what defines if you are a good or a bad player, morally speaking of course."

Deusex,3bwsrx,flyinthesoup,5,Fri Jul 3 03:53:57 2015 UTC,"I think that it is a problem that is pretty common in entertainment media in general. Several tv shows come to mind where we hear constantly about how character x and character y are best friends, but they barely interact as friends onscreen. Show, don't tell, people!  Videogames I think suffer particularly badly when this happens, because it can really kill your engagement with the story. In DX:HR you are able to suck it up and just accept that Adam cares about her, but it would be much better if we as the player cared too.   It might not be an elegant solution, but if there had been a series of flashbacks throughout the game that actually showed Adam and Megan having fun as a couple etc, it would have improved the game for me."
Deusex,3bwsrx,Zoett,42,Fri Jul 3 14:18:28 2015 UTC,"I think the main reason is how little they showed of her as a character. They cut out a huge portion that explained her and Adam's relationship and just threw us into the story, hardly explaining her, or her motivations. And thus she's easily classified as ""a bitch"", though I tend to side-eye people for not even attempting to understand her. Your comparison with Sarif is excellent: he did much worse than she did, yet he's seen as awesome, ahahaa Aaaaadaaam ssssoon!   I personally like the idea of a career-driven scientists, especially a woman, since it's a role that's rarely explored and there's so much that can be done with it. Unfortunately, she's one of the biggest missed opportunities in DX:HR, and I can only wonder if they are going to ""fix"" her retrospectively, in MD. It's not impossible, but is definitely going to be a little too late. I can't really blame people for hating her, but I do blame Eidos for doing such a poor job with representing her in the final cut of the game."

And then he's really pissed off at her at the end, and we as players don't see any closure to that, just the sensation that she's a bitch. And the ""cutscene"" after the credits? (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻  You're right, Eidos did not do a good job representing her. It could have been a great character. Instead they went full ""princess that need to be rescued"" trope on her."

She's an excellently-characterized person with agency and with well-explored motivations.  I stand by my claim that Malik is one of the most likeable and empathetic characters from the entire previous generation.    I vaguely recall there being a hint that Reed didn't go with the Tyrants entirely unwillingly - during the opening scene when Namir attacks Jensen, she says something like ""You said you wouldn't kill anyone!"" which is a bit ambiguous as it lacks a bit of context.  Did she make an arrangement with the Tyrants, or is this just what they told her when they put a gun to her head and told her to come with them?"
Deusex,3bwsrx,GavinTheAlmighty,2,Fri Jul 3 13:27:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she's a sketchy character at best, without more context."

Deusex,3bwsrx,AtomicSans,10,Thu Jul 2 21:08:08 2015 UTC,"Perhaps - my observations within the fandom are that people tend to look at Sarif's good/humorous side and give him more passes than they do for Megan. But as I said, the problem with her is that she's not in the game much, and her motivations are not clearly explained, while Sarif is a well-rounded character, and thus easier to accept the way he is."
Deusex,3bwsrx,eliza__cassan,10,Thu Jul 2 21:29:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree.  The Tyrants are given context in the Icarus Effect novel. Why they put barely any of that info into the game itself is beyond me... why make them into seemingly random bosses that, I don't know, look cool? And nothing else? Siiiigh. DX:HR is so messy."

And not because of the game, just because of how I, as a player, leaned on the whole thing. I got an ""imaginary boner"" when I put him down in front of the press conference. Oh yeah.  I liked Sarif, but as the plot progressed he just became REALLY shady, and as I learned about the reality of the extent of Adam's augs, I just couldn't trust him anymore. I personally still leaned to his point of view, but just because I do think augs are the next step, not because he ""sold"" me the idea.  Zhao was fine as the evil Chinese lady. Nothing to say there. Fun to see her face when DX:HR Spoiler  And about Megan, I already said what I think about her. Basically my irrational self hates her guts, but my rational self knows that there isn't enough info to conclude she fucked him over, and it seemed to me they still cared about each other. If we only knew why they broke up, maybe that would have been better. I still don't understand why they couldn't be a ""active"" couple by the events of HR. Who knows."

Her team worked on the biochip for Darrow, and yet  the project was set up in a way that none of them knew how it could be misused. I suspect something similar happened with her job at Page Industries - she went off for a cool new job and was only interested in furthering her research. It's another part of the story that would be really, really awesome to explore. I want to know how she feels once she realises what Grey Death is, and whether it happens before or after she takes the job."

To be honest, I find it hard to believe that Megan went from someone who wanted to change the world with her discovery to someone who willingly worked on a project she knew would kill millions. I doubt she was fully aware of Page's intentions (especially since neither was the rest of the Illuminati at this time). She also seems a bit reluctant to join him saying ""Where else would I go?"""
Deusex,3bwsrx,SinghAkash101,3,Thu Jul 2 22:08:54 2015 UTC,"I mean.....  Maybe she dident know where to go, she wants her research to be evolutionary , presumebly sarrif died so where else do you go?

Deusex,3bwsrx,im_cody,2,Thu Jul 2 21:24:06 2015 UTC,That seems unfair seeing as how we're looking at that through the lens of what we know Page becomes by the end of Deus Ex and she doesn't have nearly as much information to go on.

Let's say she makes a breakthrough and then Sarif sells it and makes hundreds of billions (also recognising she did the work so obviously sharing in the spoils). Meanwhile you have to live on the salary of a security guard and in obscurity without even knowing the special genetic lottery that made you superhuman above others was fucking stolen from you and given away.   Fuck that!

Deusex,3bwsrx,Terr_,11,Fri Jul 3 01:43:57 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, she used Adam's DNA without his knowledge or consent. As opposed to that, Adam's contract with David mentioned that he could be augmented to save his life. It was something expected. Also, Sarif, while somewhat questionable, is a good man at heart. He could easily join the illuminati, but he doesn't. He's there to give Adam inspirational pep talks and he tells him about pretty much anything he wants to know (provided Adam asks for it nicely). Sarif could have let Adam die easily, but he kept him around because he did care for him to an extent. At least, that's the way I see things."
Deusex,3bwsrx,Webemperor,-5,Fri Jul 3 03:51:35 2015 UTC,"If it was expected that adam was going to be augmented , than david is to blame i doubt megan made up his contract.

Deusex,3bwsrx,Terr_,8,Fri Jul 3 02:44:30 2015 UTC,"She was a one dimensional love interest, a teenage boy's fantasy.  *To expand on this... Why do we even need a love interest in a violence fantasy?  (A few Robocop, Deus Ex, and HR spoilers.)  Well, Alex Murphy had a wife and child so it's definitely part of the genre but when he became Robocop that relationship ended. They do some cool things where he drives past her house and stuff and it hints that he is still partially the man he was before, they explore the relationship. But the characters don't really have a relationship, that's the point. When Murphy becomes OCP property he is denied the freedom to have relationships, when they make him into a machine they take everything from him.  JCDenton is completely engineered from scratch so that he can be more easily controlled, so that he is completely a product of his owners. His attitude is programmed to go from mission to mission without pause. Of course he still had elements of humanity and his love for his brother leads him to realize the truth about his situation and rise above it.  Megan was Adam Jensen's dead girlfriend. Sure she was the strong woman, scientist type but we only see this briefly at the start. Then she completely goes away princess peach in the castle style and is only occasionally referenced. When she is Adam has such a juvenile regard for her apparent death. I'm struggling to even remember her role once it is revealed she is alive.  If the Deus Ex protagonist must have a girlfriend... graaah... then can she at least be a woman with depth? Someone grieving for the loss of her man to the machine? That's the interesting love story with cyborgs. Who can love a cyborg? Even the man or woman who loved the person before the transition sees the person as dead."

I also tried some more combat-oriented gameplay on my most recent run, and I've found that it's actually very viable as long as you don't get pinned down.  Use things like the cloak and jump upgrade to get around the map and keep enemies guessing on where you are.

Deusex,3bq70t,BrooksConrad,14,Wed Jul 1 09:43:10 2015 UTC,"No, delivery food is the only possible way anyone would ever have one of these boxes.

Deusex,3bqyju,LavaMeteor,4,Sat Jul 4 00:31:21 2015 UTC,"For a first playthrough, I'd recommend vanilla Deus Ex anyway. Maybe use something like New Vision to make the textures look a little less crappy, but I'd steer clear of anything that affects the game too much - vanilla is a fantastic experience.  Also, I'm rather jealous! I hope you enjoy your first playthrough of the original Deus Ex, the mechanics are pretty clunky these days but I still think it's a fantastic game.   Personally, I'm waiting for Revision before my next playthrough (it's been a LONG wait!), but you should definitely just go ahead and go with vanilla for your first run.  Also, here's a pretty straight-forward guide to getting it to work on newer systems.  http://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-run-deus-ex-on-windows-78/"

It isn't out for a while, so it doesn't make much sense to pre-order early. In general I'd advise against pre-ordering, but that's just me.  It's actually kind of strange that you're surprised that there isn't a physical copy in NA. You guys don't get many physical PC versions anymore (mainly because they just don't sell there). It's mainly only us in European regions (technically I'm in Africa, but we often get lobbed together). Most new games get physical releases here, even Indies sometimes."

The remote hacking appears to have a slightly different panel compared to regular hacking. See here in the demo for remote hacking and here for the regular version.   I'm not sure if this means there are certain panels that can only be remotely hacked, and others which can only be hacked up close. Regardless, the demo confirms that the minigame itself is different for remote hacking; it isn't the tower control type thing from HR.

Related to that, Eidos needs more clothing merchandise. I haven't found any official Deus Ex tshirts, just a bunch from Red Bubble.

There was a trench coat, tho the first version did not have the floral shoulderpads and overall, it didn't look like Adam's that much. IIRC people said the quality wasn't that great. Then they re-designed it, and it's the one that is in their store right now.   I haven't found any official Deus Ex tshirts, just a bunch from Red Bubble.    They had a bunch of DX-related clothing, actually! I forget now, some of it was with Musterbrand, and they had some in their own store. There were Belltower and Sarif shirts, pants, the tattoo sleeve... and a bunch of different things I cannot recall right now. But all I'm getting from Musterbrand is that they don't design for women, like, at all, so what the fuck ever. I'd perhaps buy the bandana - it's so pretty - but at the same time, I don't want to support companies like them.  The official DX store has one t-shirt design, thankfully available in women's size, too."

What's so hard about taking the print, and put it over a standard female-shaped tshirt? I mean, ok, trenchcoat might be more difficult, but all I want is a tshirt! And the official store needs more designs!  I'm just so sad I missed the hype and related merchandise of the HR release. Back then I was more into Skyrim/LoL/WoW, so there were too many games consuming my time. I HAD the game, it was a gift from my husband, but I just never got around to play it. Cue 2015, release of MD trailer, me saying ""who the fuck is that hottie"", realizing I had ALSO bought the Director's cut version in a Steam sale, and then getting obsessed over it, getting all achievements and shit. Basically, Jensen sold me the game. And they say only men are swayed by pretty pixels.  Either way, I'm not missing out on the goodies this time. Hell no."

Also I was really hoping for either changeable armor's or upgradable looks this time around for more RPG elements. I guess thats not what the developers had in mind for the game though, probably for the best.  Edit: Also... I just realized how abnormally long Jenson's torso is in these concepts."

The more features in the game the better, as long as there able to be toggled, for instance I liked having the floating ammo indicator as its in the part of the screen I'm focused on in a firefight. I also like Jensen as a character, also I'm curious as to what you didn't like about the smart vision. I think how it reveals so much about opponents is a bit much, like I did with most of the content they showed, but you have to remember that this is a demo and I assume all the augs are unlocked for demo purposes. Therefore in the end game these will be balanced by praxis cost. For instance take the Smart Vision, I think it will be balanced by it being tiered, like the first two points just get you the initial see through walls, then another for equipment, then another for augs, and maybe some for distance or something."
Deusex,3bohsk,HalfLife420,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:52:39 2015 UTC,Go watch the alpha demo of HR on YouTube. Look at how different it was and then take a long deep breath. They'll change it.

Ireversable - have to re load earlier save. Stealth pistol is useless. With the normal pistol guards cant hear you from very far anyway   Personal preferences:   I like playing stealth but when I am spotted - I just adapt and play along instead of reloading and trying to get a perfect run. I didnt skill hacking/ computers the first playthrough and im glad I didn't. To get passwords for computers etc I had to investigate myself to find them out - with hacking you miss all of that and was less rewarding imo"

The new lighting system isn't great, but the new vision textures definitely make the game look better. Just press T, backspace to clear ""say"" (or talk or whatever it says) and type preferences. There are a lot of graphics options in there. Alternatively, just use the OpenGL renderer and the lighting wont be so bad."

Deusex,3bkckr,gepardcv,2,Tue Jun 30 17:45:18 2015 UTC,"Prob + baton is overkill for almost everything. A baton hit to the lower back will KO basic guys and with the right upgrades will KO just about everything. As a side bonus the stronger lethal melee weapons with cut down doors and even some safes with the same upgrades.  Even with having finding passwords felt useful to me. At low levels hacking yields less money from ATMs, doesn't give nearly enough time to read emails, and takes longer than just typing the password (you can copy text in your notes and paste into password fields which makes it very quick). Unless you take hacking to max using a password, if one exists, is always better but there aren't always passwords to find."

That reminded me of Crysis, especially when I thought of how there is a strength augment and speed augment. Similar to the strength and speed suit modes of the original crysis (best one imo)."
Deusex,3bgm3e,TheNickelSamurai,34,Mon Jun 29 01:25:20 2015 UTC,"The Helios ending, and there's a very simple reason why: it's the only ending which actually offers something new.  Tracer Tong starts out as a staunch, honest ally, and remains all three of these things up until the very end. However, as the game wears on, it also becomes increasingly obvious that technology scares him. He starts saying things like ""never rely on technological solutions when a simpler option exists."" At the end, his intent becomes worryingly clear - ""we must ensure that the abomination Page has made of himself is not technologically feasible for future generations."" Tong fears the tyranny of technology, but instead of attempting to fight tyranny, he wants to fight technology. Tong's goals are nothing but noble, but his methods - associating with criminal gangs, consorting with terrorists, destroying communications infrastructure - are not, and his confidence that the destruction of the modern world will bring an end to tyranny is painfully naive.  The technology of the modern world has brought new ways to oppress the masses, but it also brought with it more ways than ever for the masses to fight back against oppression. Personal weaponry made it harder for bullies and thugs to just take what they wanted. Audio and video recording meant that the promises and statements of political figures no longer had to be committed to fallible human memory. The internet allowed an open and equal platform for the sharing and dissemination of criticism, opinion and information - why do you think modern governments in the real world fight so hard to regulate it? Finally, in the world of Deus Ex, augmentation allowed humans to start stepping outside the limitations of their physical bodies. Tong just can't see that technology in itself cannot be inherently moral or immoral - it is its use by human beings that makes it so. Nanoaugmentation created the Gray Death - but it also created its cure.  Returning the world to the dark ages - to feudalism, city-states, serfdom, rule by whoever had the most military power - does Tong really think that was a better life? Who says it would even work? Who says Area 51's destruction would even be as devastating as Tong thinks it would? Does he think all that technology we created in the past 250 years will just disappear? Besides - we've seen the results of Tong's ending firsthand in DX:IW. Even Tracer Tong himself bitterly regrets his decision.  As for the Illuminati ending - this isn't even change! At least Tong's ending shakes things up, collapses existing hegemonies, disrupts the balance of power. The Illuminati ending just gets rid of one group of arrogant old men and replaces it with another - namely, a group that have notably already failed to make the world the better place they promise JC it will be if he works with them at least once before. Lucius DeBeers, Stanton Dowd, Morgan Everett? Look at them - miserable, sickly old men bitterly reminiscing about the glories of the past, wasting away fantasizing about revenge and dreaming of power that they either no longer possess or never did. We've seen these men at the height of their power in Human Revolution - plotting and scheming and pulling strings. Fomenting hatred and distrust instead of understanding and co-operation. Murdering and terrorising to prevent scientific progress simply because this would allow humans to move outside their control.  Paul Denton says it best - ""it will be 20th century capitalism - a corporate elite protected by laws and tax codes."" Doesn't that sound familiar to you? It should, people, because that's the world we already live in. The Illuminati might not be real, but corporate interests gaining increasing control over the planet's governments and resources at the expense of the rights and freedoms of the common man? That's frighteningly real.  And let us not forget that for all that MJ12 were monsters, it was the Illuminati that created them, the Illuminati that inspired them, the Illuminati that trained and nurtured them and it was the Illuminati whose power MJ12 usurped. Bob Page was an Illuminatus, as was Walton Simons, as was Maggie Chow, as was Howard Strong - all amoral sociopaths bent on control through equal parts fear, intrusion and violence. Everett talks a good game about how vile the atrocities Bob Page committed are, but Bob Page was his own protege - like a son to him. Bob Page, for all his faults, makes a good point to you during your final conversation - he is what the Illuminati aspire to be but cannot create for himselves. Bob Page's plan was nothing new - he merely followed a template laid down for him by men too cowardly to act upon it themselves.  The game starts with two men conversing beneath a giant black hand jealously clutching at the world - and if JC Denton joins the Illuminati, it ends with two men conversing beneath a giant black hand jealously clutching at the world. The symbolism is clear: nothing has changed. All of this has happened before, and all of it will happen again.  Helios is the only ending that offers the hope of something new, something different. Helios is something the world has never seen before because it has never previously possessed the technology to achieve it. Something with the power to control every electronic device on the planet, something capable of being anywhere, seeing anyone, building anything. Something that seeks to control human civilization simply for the sake of stable and fair government because it possesses no ambition, no lust for power, no ego or pride - yet something that knows it does not understand what humans are like, and needs to do so by merging its consciousness with a human. Helios recognises its own limitations and freely admits that it needs a human being to understand the world - but it chose you, chose you over the person it was literally created to provide ultimate power to. It doesn't want to be a slave to Bob Page's monumental ego and delusions of godhood - it wants to merge with you so that it can understand humanity and rule them fairly.  JC Denton says it himself - ""this is what I was made for, isn't it? This is why I exist."" Paul and JC Denton were nothing more than prototypes to perfect the nanotechnological augmentation process that would allow Bob Page to become his own image of God. In the end, they were eminently disposable to Page - but they're not just tools, they're human beings. They think for themselves and make decisions based on their own understanding of right and wrong. Through determination and clever use of the resources at their disposal, the Dentons were able to bring a centuries-old global conspiracy to its knees, with its supreme leader desperately begging for his life! This is what attracted Helios to JC Denton.  Helios replies to the question of ""and if I do, what becomes of me"" with ""you will be who you will be. We are our choices."" The results of the merger would largely be up to what sort of character JC Denton was when you merged him. Was he a ruthless murderer who slaughtered everything that stood in his path, bullying and threatening those who he could intimidate into submission? Maybe after merging with Helios, he becomes a tyrant whose atrocities would frighten even the Pages and Simons of the world. But what if he was a character who took a more reasonable path, always attempting to avoid conflict and death, to seek understanding and co-operation with others? Maybe humanity's future is brighter than it could ever have imagined with this sort of leader at the helm. What if he was the kind of idiot who drank every bottle of alcohol he could find and threw potted plants at every person in his line of sight to see what their responses would be? Well, that's probably best left to your imagination.  The ultimate point is, Helios is the only outcome whose end result is not known to us - and since neither of the known outcomes are remotely appetising, that in itself is reason to take it over the others. That it essentially makes the future of humanity a function of what sort of character you played also ties perfectly into the concepts of choice and agency for which the game is so famous."
Deusex,3bgm3e,Andreus,4,Mon Jun 29 09:42:21 2015 UTC,"Well said,  I chose the Helios ending as well for many of the exact same reasons.  I also had the same criticisms with Tongs ending and the Illuminati."
Deusex,3bgm3e,ChromeGhost,3,Mon Jun 29 22:43:40 2015 UTC,Excellent post. It amazes me that some people are okay with destroying the entire infrastructure and cause calamity to a point that the main village Bob Page himself calls you out on it and calls you insane. People who played a benevolent and understanding JC would likely want to save as many as they can right?  Helios has no interest in obtaining tons of wealth or power but instead wishes to understand and make choices based on said understanding.
Deusex,3bgm3e,Ein_Vist,29,Tue Jun 30 00:11:37 2015 UTC,"I chose the Helios ending. Ultimately, running with Tracer Tong and tearing it all down seemed like it would have caused too much unintentional harm, and handing control back over to Morgan Everett and the Illuminati seemed like I was allowing an uncontestable structure of power to fall into the hands of a group with a bad history of corruption.  It seemed heavily implied to me that merging with Helios would entail eventually letting everyone on earth know what's been going on behind the scenes.  I agreed with Tong that global governance was a bad idea, and agreed with Everett that some measure of control - overt or otherwise - was needed to ensure the world didn't tear itself apart - but I only saw these as issues insofar as humans, generally, aren't capable of transcending their base nature. They were both different variations on maintaining preexisting social structures. Helios seemed to be the only one interested in progress, whatever change that ultimately entailed.  Even though it was presented as a trichotomy, it was really more of a choice between two options: whether to go with something we know can work, or whether to tread new, uncharted territory and try something different."
Deusex,3bgm3e,siledas,6,Mon Jun 29 02:19:52 2015 UTC,I think I destroyed everything.  I felt that was the main problem with DX.

Deusex,3bgm3e,im_cody,13,Mon Jun 29 10:14:40 2015 UTC,between a few things none of which you'd want to choose   I think that's intentional. It's Cyberpunk. There is no happy ending.

Destroy everything and the world will just end up in the same situation again once they've rebuilt only with a lot more dying first.   With Helios, things might actually move forward."
Deusex,3bgm3e,essellburns,9,Mon Jun 29 18:52:00 2015 UTC,"Helios ending.  The Illuminati most likely had information on everything that went down in 51. The technology would exist again and someone would make a move for it's power. Tong's plan would only stall the process.  If JC just killed Page and walked away the Illuminati would just take the building and Helios for themselves.  The way I see it, someone's becoming a god at some point down the line. Out of the options provided, JC seemed the most preferable option.  DX:IW Spoiler"

Deusex,3bgm3e,StillCantCode,8,Mon Jun 29 06:10:45 2015 UTC,"I chose the Helios ending.  I couldn't imagine myself helping the Illuminati (which had a hand in all of this since Human Revolution/bringing Bob Page into its fold) regaining power only for the same scenario to repeat itself. JC himself says to Everett in Area 51 ""Isn't it time to end the tyranny? For everyone?"" Everett himself, as compassionate as he claims to be, was largely a huge butthole IMHO (i.e. leaving Lucius Debeers in cryostasis with no intention of restoring him, dodging JC's question about his motives, etc.). The guy just couldn't be trusted and for that reason I feel very uncomfortable leaving Area51/Helios in the hands of that guy.  As for the ""dark age"", I'm not sure how Tong's solution to destroy the facility to break free of MJ12's grip would solve the current crisis. How would Ambrosia be distributed to the masses? How would communications work? Is there an infrastructure ready to go to rebuild right away should JC pull the plug? It doesn't seem like his plan was well thought out which is odd considering how intelligent Tong/Savage are.  What made me choose Helios was that it has the capacity (when merged with the right individual) to rid the world of MJ12's cancerous grip, gain human understanding and make decisions based off of logic. Helios/JC could thoroughly explain to Tong that the plan to destroy Area 51 isn't the best of ideas and perhaps X-51/Tong could utilize it for the good of the people with JC/Helios at the helm. JC (at least in the way I played him) is a very understanding indivudual and cherishes life like Paul Denton and I'd much rather merge with an AI that has that much knowledge than let the Illuminati get a hold of it."

Deusex,3bgm3e,lame_corprus,6,Tue Jun 30 11:01:58 2015 UTC,"I think the Helios ending, but they're all so compelling from a philosophy angle.  What right does JC, and by extension the player, have to become an all powerful being; pretty much a god? He can never be disposed. He can never be replaced. He and he alone makes the greatest decisions in the world. He rules everyone and everyone has to just hope he's not going to get bored or something.  The Illuminati ending seems more moderate, but once again the people of the world are not allowed to know the truth. They must be kept ignorant, with their actions manipulated by a few powerful, potentially corrupt people. At least in the Helios ending JC will probably be open with what he's doing.  Tong's ending gives the world freedom, but at the cost of progress and security. How will the world react? Will order fall apart? Will despots and fascists come to power around the world, causing suffering and death? Will science, technology, medicine, art, history.. all be lost?  It's what I love about the endings, it's not ""good vs evil,"" it's ""Freedom and truth vs security, order and progress."" It doesn't say which is the real answer, the true answer, because there is no true answer. Do we remain ignorant or sacrifice freedom for the greater good, do we stick to our ideals of freedom despite incredible negative consequences, or do compromise, and in doing so get compromised freedom and compromised order and security."
Deusex,3bgm3e,PrinceCheddar,4,Mon Jun 29 09:45:55 2015 UTC,"I chose the ""dark age"" ending. While I don't agree with suddenly breaking everything, there was no ""gracefully decentralize Area 51 over the course of a few years"" option, so I decided for the one closest to it."
Deusex,3bgm3e,dvdkon,6,Mon Jun 29 07:11:39 2015 UTC,"Illuminati ending.  I didn't feel like I could totally trust HELIOS. How much would come out me and how much would come out him? There was too much doubt on the basest of things that I couldn't honestly go for it.  With the Illuminati, I knew it wouldn't be 100% either. But, all things considered, I felt that if I could handle distributing the vaccine as well as possible and looking over what was going on then I could help; and that's the best I could really do. Even when Everett and JC die, if that huge structure came tumbling down another totally unpredictable one would just take its place. The best I can do is help those that were really affected; make their lives a little brighter.  I wouldn't choose the dark age ending though. I didn't feel it would really help anyone. To destroy it all, to remove great archives of knowledge and methods of communication like that doesn't seem to really help anyone to me, especially not those who rely on these modern comforts to get by.  the Illuminati ending might have the least radical good to it, but it likewise has the least radical risks too. Bringing the world back to normal is what it needed, so that's I went to do. I didn't make my decision in the basis of taking the world to Heaven, I did to stop it from going to Hell."
Deusex,3bgm3e,Mr_Flippers,5,Mon Jun 29 04:34:33 2015 UTC,"I've never been comfortable with any of the endings, but for me distrust of Helios never figured in as much as distrust of self."

Deusex,3bgm3e,Mr_Flippers,3,Mon Jun 29 05:52:30 2015 UTC,"Deus Ex tends to make me think quite a lot about how I play it. Whether it's Icarus goading me or Paul guilt tripping, or the massive responsibility of the final choice, there's tons of opportunity to reflect on your actions.  Given JC's power, I tend to choose poorly.  Edit: /u/Andreus above brings up excellent points. I know how I'll choose this time."
Deusex,3bgm3e,macksting,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:15:44 2015 UTC,"I feel like the best thing to reflect on isnt just yourself, but those around you. Every characters agendas and dialogues have different impacts on not just JC but you yourself"
Deusex,3bgm3e,Mr_Flippers,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:27:55 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, why waste an opportunity for self-reflection? After all, you, as the player, are the only person with real agency in this scenario, and you're the only one making conscious choices; what's more, unless you engage, nothing happens. I know that's all a little obvious, but once you're familiar with the agendas of the NPCs, you're left with the mystery of yourself, and I honestly think that's where Deus Ex shines."
Deusex,3bgm3e,macksting,2,Mon Jun 29 17:37:12 2015 UTC,It's the illuminati responsible for all the crap that happened. Gray Death? Everett and Page. Daedalus/Icarus? Everett and Page. Morgan Everett is only a heroic character in the context of the game itself. Everything before and after it was Everett clawing for power and trying to take over the world. I wouldn't let him have anything after I was finished.

Deusex,3bgm3e,Mr_Flippers,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:45:57 2015 UTC,"There are some organizations that don't deserve fixing. The Illuminati deserves to be destroyed like MJ12. If not,then we get the WTO & The Order."
Deusex,3bgm3e,StillCantCode,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:58:49 2015 UTC,"Destroying their organisation based on ideals doesnt help anyone effected by them. Theyve got the means to distribute the vaccine to everyone and with JC overlooking it theres little chance of it being fucked up. Let the sins of the father die and build a brighter tomorrow for the rest. Even if the Illuminati were destroyed, give it time and someone will take their place. Nature abhors a vaccuum"
Deusex,3bgm3e,Mr_Flippers,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:05:32 2015 UTC,Helios also has the means to distribute the vaccine. It's also (not) affected by petty human selfishness -the thing that leads men to claw for power and riches. It would administrate the world using cold legal logic; human bullshit that makes the world the way it is would no longer be in the way.
Deusex,3bgm3e,StillCantCode,2,Mon Jun 29 07:08:35 2015 UTC,"And like I said, I have too much doubt to trust HELIOS and merging with him. It is an effective solution but not one that I find trustworthy, the result of such a powerful merge is unprecedented and is the kind of gamble I cant afford losing. Humanity is capable of great good and great evil, removing its influence on the world can lead HELIOS to all manner of things.   Which would HELIOS favour? Its human source or the environment? Surely it would lead itself, sooner or later, to destroy one in favour of the other. The unpredictability of humanity could be troublesome for HELIOS' environment and the planet, which it could come up with all manner of solutions to. Under the almighty eyes of HELIOS who knows how it would judge you? The very tyranny that JC fought against could pale in comparison to one he creates.  None if the endings are all that ""good"". Tong is probably the most trustworthy person you meet in game, furthermore he seems the most concerned with his community and environment, yet that doesnt mean I feel compelled to go with his option. The dark age would do more harm than good in my eyes, simplifying life doesnt seem as important to me as archiving and transmitting the knowledge of the world to everyone or enhancing those fields which keep us living healthier and safer. Erasing all record of it helps no one and only means history has no lesson to learn from until its repeated.  The Illuminati ending is like the opposite of such. Everett is not trustworthy at all and his friends dont convince me that theyre worth getting close and personal with. However, their connections around the world are vast and useful. Its only by JCs influence that they can make a change for the better, cause they sure didnt get off their ass to do much before. When they did, it was unnoticeable. It allows society to live under the guise of a freer and simpler world, regardless of whether its true or not. It is by no means wonderful, but they can be used to do good and allow everyone to live on with their lives. There is a distinct benefit out of using them. I would rather get cured for a fatal illness and have someone read my phone messages than be cut off from the outside world and maybe die from the flu. Neither are totally good, but one is better than the other (at least subjectively).  HELIOS is, at its core, absolutely powerful. Its a dangerous kind of power, the kind the Illuminati arguably have except HELIOS would actually use it a lot. It gives no leeway to anything else. It has the power to dictate over humanity, which could become worse than any scenario the Illuminati had ever put the world in. But it can also be used to vaccinate efficiently, solve crimes and create an incredibly stable environment. How it uses its power is impossible to estimate and its with that doubt that stops me from going ahead. Bob Page tried to set it up for the earth to be a temple to him and his absolute power, IIRC HELIOS even states that his will would be ultimate had he merged with HELIOS. However, I still cannot tell if thats HELIOS trying to lure JC into merging with him, either appealing to a lust for power or saviour complex. HELIOS seems more likely to benefit from the merge than JC and whether the two will be truly one is hard to determine and that even if they were, which personality would overpower the other one? Its these doubts over HELIOS' character and limitless potential that stops me from empowering it further. It could be fantastic and it could be cataclysmic, but its a gamble I wont take."
Deusex,3bgm3e,Mr_Flippers,3,Mon Jun 29 07:42:32 2015 UTC,"I quickly chose each in quick succession. Even as I played it for the first time, my indecision was such that I half-completed every possible solution in the Aquinas Hub, because I wasn't really comfortable with any of the probable results. When I tried one ending, I wasn't particularly pleased. When I tried another, I was horrified. When I tried the third, I was perturbed.  I'm playing again right now, and I still don't know what to do."
Deusex,3bgm3e,macksting,3,Mon Jun 29 05:47:39 2015 UTC,"The first time, the choice kinda blindsided me cause I came in there with one goal: to kill Bob Page. In the end I picked Helios, cause I didn't trust Everett one bit and Tong's idea just seemed crazy. When replaying the game, I still don't really know what to pick, but the Helios choice seems the most in line with how my JC usually acts in the rest of the game."
Deusex,3bgm3e,hobocactus,2,Mon Jun 29 21:22:07 2015 UTC,Helios for me too.   Did anyone else notice that JC's voice acting suddenly got expressive when you chose that option?
Deusex,3bgm3e,ahyuknyuk,2,Mon Jun 29 06:25:30 2015 UTC,"I saved just before I could make each choice and did them all because, well, it's just a video game and I wanted to see all the endings."

Deusex,3bgm3e,Breadman86,2,Mon Jun 29 13:38:00 2015 UTC,I chose the Everett ending :-    Everett offers Denton the chance to bring the Illuminati back to power by killing Bob Page and using the technology of Area 51 to rule the world with an invisible hand.    Why?  Because I want a imagine that in the future someone will be able to challenge the Illuminati and that will be a awesome game/book from a cosumer point of view.

Deusex,3bgm3e,StillCantCode,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:25:53 2015 UTC,"Helios ending.  Why?  Partly because I didn't trust the Illuminati at all, and because the ending that Tracer Tong suggested would not only destroy the global information network, but it would also completely tear apart families that live any distance from each other whatsoever.  Millions of people cut off, stranded, maybe never to see the people they love again.  I wasn't going to do that either.    But most of the reason I picked Helios was because it was the one that Paul endorsed.  And I absolutely adored Paul."
Deusex,3bgm3e,ChickadeeAce,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:18:27 2015 UTC,"I chose Tong's ending: destroy Area 51 and return the world to the dark ages. I chose this after coming to the conclusion that if the Illuminati returned to power, the events of the game would simply be repeated (the Illuminati would eventually lose power and be replaced with another Majestic 12). The Helios ending (Merge JC's mind with the Helios AI) would just create a Skynet scenario (see Terminator 2: Judgement Day), where a computer is given control of the world, becomes to brutal and cold towards its organic inhabitants (mainly the humans), and rebel factions rise up to the destroy it, costing thousands if not millions of lives in the process.   I agree with Tong that giving one government/organisation/individual control of all global communications is a terrible idea; it would lead to corruption and general misuse and, like the Skynet scenario, rebellions and the loss of lives. Destroying Area 51 and cutting off global communication for what is likely to be a very small amount of time (I imagine that technologies such as 2-way radios, snail mail, and other older, non-digital methods of communication would still be available) before it is re-established, now under the control of the people, would allow the world a chance to rebuild. Of course, history will almost certainly repeat itself again with this ending; a single organisation may once again gain control of global communication and misuse it. However, hopefully with the insight of people like Tong, Savage, JC, and Paul (assuming he was saved) this may be averted.  I also agree with what some other people have said; that with the Tong ending, there would be chaos, potential leading some loss of life, but probably not as great as with the other endings."

Helios states that it should administer the world because of the lack of ambition. It yearns to understand human beings and makes decisions that will benefit the many (with the help of JC). I wonder how you could infer that it could be ""threatened"" and just wipe out mankind...it would not accomplish its goal that way.   It's true that we don't get to interact with Helios for the amount of time that we interacted with Daedalus/Icarus, but we do know that Daedalus was benevolent and assisted JC Denton/Tong/Everett at every turn. Not all AIs have to be like SHODAN or HAL 9000.  I think Andreus said it best earlier...Tong is just scared of technology rather than utilizing it to keep future tyranny at bay. What he proposes is nothing short of catastrophic while Helios will go through each and every available scenario, tons of data, etc. and at least attempt to right the wrongs without destroying the entire infrastructure. The fact that it didn't wish to merge with Bob Page and desired you to me is testament enough."
Deusex,3bgm3e,Ein_Vist,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:04:21 2015 UTC,"You have a point: Helios may not turn into Skynet or HAL 9000. However, neither of them were evil to start of with; they both had functions to perform, but went too far in their quest to to so. Skynet wasn't even self-aware in the beginning. HAL's job was simply to manage a space station.  If the goal of Helios is to maintain order, how long will it be before radical groups, terrorists, and international crises force it to take more drastic measures. It doesn't matter how good at ruling it is, there will be people who will find out about it and will not be happy that the world is being run by a machine. I suppose that JC could act as the face of Helios to the world, but then how long will it be before their are anti-augmentation uprisings, people calling JC a living weapon, calls for elections, etc.  Helios didn't merge with Page because anyone, even a computer, could tell he is completely insane and unstable (""death will have no meaning""). He tries to bribe JC by offering him Europe if you begin the Tong ending.  All of the endings are unclear on what happens. I simply chose Tong's ending because it seemed like the one with the clearest outcome. If there was an ending to simple to reroute communication away from Area 51 and destroy Page and Helios, I would have chosen that instead."
Deusex,3bgm3e,GaiaBlade,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:03:30 2015 UTC,"The dark age ending.  Seeing how messed up and ultimately broken the world was, I strongly agreed that the best course of action was to simply hit the reset button and give everone more or less equal chances, even at the cost of potentially millions dying. But since overpopulation was also part of the problem, it wasn't so much a cost to pay but a part of the cure.  I know it might sound cruel, but I really thought - and still think - that it was the most reasonable option."

I want something I can sit on my desk and the bust looks like it'd be better for that. I went with the statue in the end though, it looks cooler. As well as the steelbook case and the art book <3"

Deusex,3b3osp,SinghAkash101,9,Thu Jun 25 18:33:57 2015 UTC,"There are a few things I really liked about the article.  -The header image: I don't think we've seen that one before?  -Confirmation that the demo was actually playable, not just a pre-recorded target render: it crashed midway through and the demonstrator speed-ran it back to where they were up to.  -Environments have increased emphasis on verticality.  -Emphasis on the desire for the stealth and combat approaches to be equally valid. This is especially exciting when coupled with the news from other articles that a non lethal approach will also be possible in an action play style, meaning that non-lethal players will be able to experience this improvement too.  -The developer's personal desire for 'flow' in all aspects of gameplay, a concept that seems like it means to him that all aspects of gameplay have equal polish and that switching between them should feel natural."
Deusex,3b3osp,Zoett,5,Thu Jun 25 20:26:22 2015 UTC,"-The header image: I don't think we've seen that one before?   We have, it was released along with the other screenshots, and Alex and Rucker character renders as a part of E3 promo. But not many articles use it for some reason, and definitely not at that resolution. It's such an awesome one. :D     -Environments have increased emphasis on verticality.     I'm so happy about this one, it made a world of difference between how levels felt in HR and TML."
Deusex,3b3osp,eliza__cassan,3,Thu Jun 25 22:06:47 2015 UTC,"More verticality is always welcome : )   Something I have been wondering about is if they are going to give Adam some default augs at the start of the game. I wonder this because assuming that a player has those traversal abilities probably gives them more freedom in designing the environment, and also avoids the need for an obvious 'default path' that can be completed without using any augmentations."
Deusex,3b3osp,Zoett,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:13:21 2015 UTC,"There should still be a no-aug way, if not obvious, because not everyone in the game will have Jensen's augmentations."

Deusex,3b3osp,ahyuknyuk,7,Thu Jun 25 21:31:18 2015 UTC,"What a ridiculous fluff peace. I expect no less of polygon.  I'm hoping I can criticise  positive mankind coverage without too much of a backlash here.   After the thief, hitman absolution and Tomb Raider marketing I think we've already noticed a pattern that square Enix are masters of marketing.  we saw how thief and absolution were received by old school fans when they actually got to play it... so I'm airing on the side of caution.   Does anyone know if this is the same team as HR or just the same studio.   There is no correct way to play?   Imo stealth should be slightly OP... I mean in real life surely sneaking past people is slightly easier then a massive fire fight. Surely you should evaluate a situation and decide on stealth or assault or a mixture. Not a hand holding 'do what you want no matter how inappropriate'.   I don't care how fun or responsive the combat is... I want it to be adaptive. If I shoot out a building will reinforcements arrive? Will the proceeding part have more alert guards? Or will it just be cool combat they are adding until the immediate area is dead in a vacuum?   You can play 2 ways...?   I'm apprehensive about this upon further reading based on my experiences from the last game, as the 'stealth'  way involves knocking everyone out silently with no repercussions. In hitman 2 knocked out people eventually woke up and alerted people,  in pretty much all hitman games  knocked out people would affect your rating. In old splinter cell games, and alpha protocol you actually had to leave everyone untouched on certain levels.  And in deus ex.....  Stab everyone in that back of the head as long as you don't get seen and you should still get 'ghost'  or was it 'smooth operator' .   Deus ex 1 and HR are amazing. But it's a new console generation in 2016...  will the stealth aspect of the game (which makes up about 25% of the game) actually improve.   This article told me nothing"
Deusex,3b3osp,pick-a-spot,3,Thu Jun 25 20:45:42 2015 UTC,Ghost is for remaining unseen and Smooth operator was for not setting off alarms.
Deusex,3b3osp,ahyuknyuk,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:33:27 2015 UTC,It's being made by the same team as Human Revolution.
Deusex,3b3osp,SHdude,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:03:09 2015 UTC,"If they truly want to make all playstyles equal, then they need to give the same amount of experience no matter which way you deal with enemies (lethal vs non-lethal, stealth vs non-stealth). I've never done a combat playthrough of DXHR because I feel like I'm gimping myself.   If I were the developer, I'd make it so only completing mission objectives would grant experience (obviously more than what DXHR gave out to balance out the loss of all the other experience sources); that would make all playstyles progress evenly and therefore make them equal."

Deusex,3b3tpt,ahyuknyuk,7,Thu Jun 25 19:10:48 2015 UTC,"Played the first Deus Ex for the first time in awhile last night. The conversation with the first NSF commander in the statue puts it squarely in the ""most relevant"" category...  ""You can't fight ideas with bullets.""  ""Do you ever ask what it's for? The surveillance, the police, the shoot-on-sight laws? Is that freedom?""  ""Corporations are so big, you don't even know who you're working for. That's terror. Terror built into the system."""
Deusex,3b3tpt,lachiemx,3,Fri Jun 26 05:32:59 2015 UTC,"I'll start by saying I didnt play Invisible War, I tried  few weeks back, but had time constraints and couldnt really get on board with the 'one ammo type for all guns' thing.  I feel sociologically, Human Revolution is most relevant. Back in 2000 when Deus Ex came out, the internet was still new. It hadnt gone as mainstream as it has today, it wasnt EVERYWHERE like it is today and children didnt have smartphones. Society hadnt been transformed by computers and the internet like it has now. In 2011 all of this had happened. Society has changed. And to me that is what HR is mostly about. Our endgame choices are mainly about whether we should stop technological progress, restrain it but let it move on, let it move ahead freely without any constraints whatsoever and there is the suicide button(which I dont really feel is relevant to this discussion). Issues like data mining and privacy were discussed in the original game, but it wasnt the central theme. In HR how technology is changing(some would say distorting) mankind is central to the story.  Politically, I feel Deus Ex is most relevant. The entire story to me is about how in any reasonable system that offers economic and physical security there will always be inequality. There will always be have and have nots. Elites and those who have nothing and control nothing. And that any pursuit of a different system will either lead to a different group of elites or complete and total chaos. Though I cant really say if this is most relevant simply TODAY. These are issues that have probably existed since the dawn of civilization."
Deusex,3b3tpt,Hotseflots,3,Thu Jun 25 19:26:01 2015 UTC,"Definitely the original Deus Ex.   The whole ""would you augment yourself"" spin of Human Revolution is just not relevant in our day and age.  Just pop in the original Deus Ex, talk with the NSF commander, and it's already more relevant than Human Revolution's themes. The whole terrorism fueling a security versus rights debate is so incredibly spot on, it's scary."
Deusex,3b3tpt,robotroller,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:59:13 2015 UTC,I agree with you on the original being more relevant than HR but disagree with you about HR not having any relevance at all.  People are thoughtlessly lapping up any new technology these days. No matter how much it effects their freedom and privacy. So I think HR is relevant.
