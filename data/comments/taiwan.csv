ARC number) because they use different characters that won't pass a typical sum check. I won't put a direct link but you might start here....  Or if you have an Amazon account you can order direct. They will ship to Taiwan. They typically take care of all customs duties and taxes. In the end, it often works out to about even with what you'll find listed on Taiwanese sites.

taiwan,3e1qck,lostalien,13,Tue Jul 21 10:16:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not even sure getting police on the roads is going to help, I think there needs to be a major drive to start enforcing the traffic laws, possibly even retraining the police force to recognize violations. It would surprise me at all if a significant amount of the police force wasn't even aware of many of the unsafe actions they witness every day.  Some of it is that police just clearly don't give a damn; I've seen officers watch as people blow through red lights, and completely ignore it. Maybe there's no incentive to pull over unsafe drivers, or maybe it's too much of a hassle for them to do their jobs properly, but just compare the amount of accidents you pass to the amount of times you see a cop with anyone pulled over."

However performance reviews do look at an officers ticketing statistics so if you've been on a steady decline while your peers are holding flat or increasing in ticketing rate then you could get fired. Therefore the cops are motivated to continue ticketing.

taiwan,3dy3gn,Get9,7,Mon Jul 20 19:27:33 2015 UTC,"It's just a singular instance and anecdote, but:  A great example of this is one student I had. I generally teach on the junior high school level, but my admins needed someone to teach a remedial reading class for fourth grade students that were having trouble catching up. In my class was one student: He was really nice, but had cognitive difficulties as well as hallucinations. Apparently, he had been on medication the previous year, but his parents took him off of his medications because ""he needed to learn how to live normally and without drugs."" They maintained that his breaks with reality were just a phase and that he would grow out of them. Meanwhile, I needed to deal with a student who ""saw"" worms and walking edibles on the ground, which he rolled around next to and tried to consume.   Though his condition worsened throughout the year without medication, his parents refused to acknowledge that there was a problem, mainly due to stigma, and everyone at the school was left to deal with him.   I truly do hope that those with mental health issues are taken more seriously in Taiwanese culture. I may be a teacher, but I was schooled in how to convey the concepts of English effectively, not deal with students who obviously need professional help.  This applies to some people I've met on the street, as well. They don't need to be on the street; they need help."

taiwan,3dy3gn,x3nomik,2,Tue Jul 21 05:30:07 2015 UTC,I don't know about police state but Taiwan is already a surveillance state. Have you noticed how many cameras there are everywhere?  Edit: this is getting downvoted for some reason. Perhaps we're not on the same page? Some Wikipedia reading on both subjects: police state and surveillance state.
taiwan,3dy3gn,Tyr808,9,Mon Jul 20 19:35:52 2015 UTC,"As much as I'm in favor of freedom, as long as the police stay decent and respectful, I'm not personally against the cameras. I've never had any negative things come out of it and Taipei does have less crime than other areas. It's simply not viable to be a criminal when you can't get away with it.   I've had it play in my favor twice. Once I was out with my girlfriend and we parked on the side of the street like everyone else (someone else had even double parked next to us afterwards), but for whatever reason someone decided to walk by and key the hood of her car. The dumbass did it right in clear view of two cameras and the police had taken care of it all and he had to pay for it.   My friend borrowed my bike and got it stolen by forgetting to lock it. Caught the perp on camera again.  I will agree though that it is indeed the kind of issue that is balanced on the edge of a knife though."
taiwan,3dy3gn,x3nomik,2,Mon Jul 20 20:46:22 2015 UTC,Police state and surveillance state are two different things IMO. I also don't mind the cameras if they're not abused by the state since they obviously help to keep the crime rate down (or at least solve crimes that do go on).  An aside: I used to think that Taiwanese were unusually moral people not prone to theft. But what about all the bars on the windows? This perplexed me until I realized there are cameras everywhere. CCTV > Confucian values. (Now if only there were something for white collar crime...)

Your title is looking for a demographic analysis, for which you can contact the Department of Statistics at the Ministry of the Interior, however keep in mind that sometimes they charge for specific documents and that many are outdated.  As far as jobs are concerned, it's analogous to Edward Abbey's quote from Desert Solitaire, ""There is no shortage of water in the desert but exactly the right amount , a perfect ratio of water to rock, water to sand."" In other words, those jobs exist, but they may be equally matched with present demand.  However, local openings are frequently posted on local boards, typically through Facebook since few people want to pay for ads.

taiwan,3e15sv,Karmayana,2,Tue Jul 21 04:14:55 2015 UTC,"Found it. Look further down the page for an age breakdown of individual cities.  Or I'll just put it here. I'm using the new administrative districts.    Data New Taipei City Kaohsiung City Taiwan (All)    Under 15 15.2% 14.9% 15.8%   15-64 77% 75.1% 73.5%   65+ 7.7% 10.1% 10.7%   Average 36.3 y.o. 37.7 y.o. 37.5 y.o.

If you want to do an economic breakdown you can look for the Stats here. I'm off to lunch."
taiwan,3e15sv,Karmayana,2,Tue Jul 21 04:38:44 2015 UTC,"difference of less than 5% is insignificant   I'm not getting that.  Do you mean ""statistically insignificant""?  Because that's not a confidence interval for a statistical test, it's just a number."
taiwan,3e15sv,richardtheassassin,2,Tue Jul 21 05:26:42 2015 UTC,"If anything, Taipei skews 'young' compared to Taiwan as a whole simply by looking at the differences between the means. The average age in Taichung is even lower at 36.0. So  it should be said that the two cities mentioned as primo job locations (Taipei and Taichung) would actually fit the bill for having more youth educational jobs (per capita) since they are 'younger' upon cursory glance. Whether that is a statistically significant difference would take a little more parsing of the data and it's been a while since I've done any ANOVA or other statistics.  In other words, this is back of the napkin math with a tiny subset of the data present in the report. I think it's (the report I linked) a worthwhile read (that I currently don't have time for). But I'd say it sure beats the anecdotal evidence, and almost mythologized 'story,' that Kaohsiung is old and busted and Taipei is hip and happening.  And to pre-empt: Yes I am cherry picking the data."

taiwan,3e15sv,richardtheassassin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:51:07 2015 UTC,"Fixed above. I've been reading a bit of the publication. Here's a worthwhile quote that hits at what OP was going after.   The dependency ratio for children declined all the way from 82.8% in 1956 to 21.4% in 2010 due to the change of the population age structure. It indicated that each child was supported by 1.2 persons of the working-age population in 1956, but each child was supported by 4.7 persons in 2010. The dependency ratio for the elder increased considerably from 4.6% in 1956 to 14.6% in 2010. In other words, each elder was supported by 21.4 persons of the working-age population in 1956; however, each elder was supported by only 6.9 persons in 2010. It indicated a heavy burden on the working-age population for the support and wellbeing of the elder population. The aging index was only 5.6% in 1956 or the proportion of the elder population to the children was 1 to 17.7. Merely 7.0 percentage points were increased between 1956 and 1980. However, a higher level of increase was observed thereafter. Comparing with the last census, the aging index increased from 40.4% in 2000 to 68.2% in 2010 by 27.8 percentage points. The proportion of the elder population to the children increased to 1 to 1.5. The population under 15 years decreased by 1,082 thousand persons and the elder population increased by 558 thousand persons in ten years, leading to the aging index rose up substantially. Observing by county and city, a total of fifteen counties and cities reported the aging index higher than the national average, Chiayi County ranked the highest at 102.9%, Yunlin County and Penghu County both stood at 95.6%, mainly due to population aging; Taipei City stood the fourth place at 94.2% and was primarily attributed to the childlessness. A total of seven counties and cities had the aging index lower than the national average, of which Taoyuan County was at the lowest level 47.5%, followed by New Taipei City 50.9% and Taichung City 51.7%.   And one more tidbit.   The average age increased to 37.5 years in 2010 by 15.8 years from 21.7 years in 1956.   So when you really start to dig into it, it's more like Taipei and Taichung are anomalous and that Taiwan on the the whole is old and getting older."

taiwan,3e15sv,Roygbiv0415,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:34:57 2015 UTC,"By personal observation, I do feel that the children population in downtown Kaohsiung is declining fast. I grew up in Kaohsiung, lived there till graduating from college, but had been working in Taipei since. The majority of my high school and college classmates are now in Taipei, and the very few (prolly less than 10%) are either not employed or are considering quitting and moving up to Taipei. As such, I won't be surprised if services catering to children are also on the decline. Another thing: the elementary school I went to at the time exceeded some 4000 students, but I learned that it would be closed down before school starts in September, as the total number of students had dropped below 500.  It has nothing to do with being nice/modern/developed quickly. Kaohsiung was a large industrial port, but had been overshadowed by Chinese ports in recent years, plus many of the more polluting industries had been shut down. Jobs are now mostly in the Kaohsiung's northern suburbs (in what used to be Kaohsiung county), but most are pretty low paying and people working there tend to move around the area for convenience and lower living costs, leaving Kaohsiung City with mostly service industries and older people living comfortably off pensions. It's still a nice and modern city -- I enjoy going back once every month -- just not one with an abundance of young people and kids."

People are generally nicer in Kaohsiung (so I've heard) but I don't really notice the difference.  As for transportation, I mainly use the MRT because it'll reach just about anywhere in the city. But in Kaohsiung there are only two lines. In Taipei there are also bicycles that you can use for 5NT with no time limit. So you can use that to ride around until you get tired."
taiwan,3dw9qm,Laser-circus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:34:20 2015 UTC,"Just an island??  You are really missing out on the perks of Taiwan, my friend.  There is plenty to do in Kaohsiung.  And on the island, well, there are lots of unique opportunities.  For example, hiking and snorkeling are two things you could do in the same weekend!  That is not possible in most of the world.  For transportation, I prefer to scooter around since population density is lower.  It's easy to park and faster to get from A to B even if there were MRT lines everywhere.  Kaohsiung has the city bikes too which are free for < 1 hour, and yes no time limit although you of course pay more as you use it longer.  In Taipei you get 30 minutes for 5 NT.  Both are great systems, and I'm not trying to say one is better than the other (lest we devolve into a Taipei vs. Kaohsiung spat).

Another impression is, as a white foreigner, you get a lot more stares than in Taipei. It seems that, once you scratch the veneer of newness, it's probably pretty local-yokel, if you like that sort of thing.  One thing about Taipei that I do enjoy is because it's close to mountains.

taiwan,3dvofr,richardtheassassin,2,Tue Jul 21 18:19:23 2015 UTC,"So, the one major factor here is housing. Without the issue of housing, a comfortable living wouldn't be too difficult, even in Taipei (though, it would be hard to compare it to Americans, as the needs are generally different. Whether or no there's a need to buy a car, for example.) Not adding housing into account, I'd put down 40k as a reasonably comfortable number in Taipei (plus luxuries and entertainment), more so elsewhere.   If you buy a house in city center, a normal 35-ish ping 3LDK apartment at 800k/ping would amount to 28mil, assuming 80% mortgage, you can be looking at over 120k a month just for mortgage payment (if my calculations are correct). Realistically you could live small, or live further out, but even halfing either the size or the per ping cost would still mean 60k/mo into the sinkhole.  Renting would be cheaper, but still nearly half that of buying, and you don't own anything in the end. at least the living is comfortable..."

taiwan,3dvofr,Get9,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:32:03 2015 UTC,"Renting an apartment is much cheaper than buying in Taipei.  Based on your example, there is no way that a 35 ping apartment would rent for anywhere close to 60k a month, unless you are talking a fully furnished apartment in a luxury building in a prime location (in which case your mortgage would definitely be much more than 120k a month as well).  For a 35 ping apartment, I would say your rent is more likely to be around $30-35k depending on age and location."

taiwan,3dvofr,Get9,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:31:50 2015 UTC,"Does everyone agree that 80k to 100k is comfortable?   There are people in this sub that feel that 100k a month for two people is fine, and others that believe 100k per person is completely necessary. It depends on what you need money to spend on, how much you intend to save, and what you view as ""comfortable."" If you have two people and you're making around 100k total, you may be able to live simply and save some each month.   Figure it like this per month:   apartment (18-23坪) - 10k utilities - 2k phone - 1-2k food - 6k travel - 2-3k   What else do you need? Throw that in there. My estimate is at about 22k with all of the above. I estimated for a scooter, not the MRT, by the way, and for a district in New Taipei City that's not right next to Taipei City. Your estimate will probably vary widely from mine, but it's a decent start.  You want to live like an upper-middle class American?

I can get a 40-80 ping house in Tainan for the same price.

Or an apartment featured in local architectural magazines?  80k can get you a large apartment across the street from Daan Eslite with futuristic furnishings a few paces from the station, floor to ceiling windows covering every angle and featured in magazines. 75k can get you a first floor two story apartment with first and basement parking in the center of Technology Building. 120k can get you a nice huge apartment overlooking Taipei 101 all the way to Xinyi Eslite with a living room with 20 foot ceilings, and a nice floor to ceiling window to match and featured in the cover of multiple local architectural magazines.  PS: I think you may have some confusion. 80k a month in Taipei can get you many of the best apartments in most downtown locations right next to the hottest spots. There's no way that's just ""upper middle class"". 80k is enough to get you an entire floor in nearly any moderate apartment, is enough to rent multiple 3-story low-rises in New Taipei City, and it's enough to get you nearly any apartment at any luxury high rise in the center of Daan district with only a few exceptions. Even the average apartments surrounding Renai Circle in downtown Taipei are much less than that."

taiwan,3dtcjg,ferinoth,0,Mon Jul 20 05:10:14 2015 UTC,Truman was loathe to do any such thing. The fact that Taiwan had some semblance of the military encouraged them to threaten intervention. The KMT also held the CCP down in the mainland.

taiwan,3dtcjg,ShrimpCrackers,0,Tue Jul 21 19:52:27 2015 UTC,"Actually you completely missed my point. Okinawa, also a military colony of the USA returned the island to Japan. If the ROC never had made claims over Taiwan, it's likely that would have been the result or independence like the Phillippines. It is unfathomable in an alternate scenario that the USA would willingly give Taiwan to the PRC, especially in the 1970's.  I'm sorry that you have not been following the news closely, but China has begun to claim Okinawa and the rest of the Ryukyu Island chain beginning this year. This process has been in the works for the last 5-6 years. PRC think tanks are also making hundreds of claims all around Asia expanding as wide as the American continent and as high as and low as both the Arctic and Antarctica.  This is similar to what happened prior to claims in the late 1940's and 50's with them creating claims on Taiwan. The same pretext was done to make claims over Korean territories which began in the 1970's which has culminated in the Goguryeo Kingdom reduced to a vassal state in Chinese textbooks, along with attempts to claim UN world heritage sites Korean locales as well as the defacement of Korean artifacts to make them more Chinese."
taiwan,3dtcjg,ferinoth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:39:21 2015 UTC,"it's likely that would have been the result or independence like the Phillippines  Neither side would ever have allowed Taiwan to declare independence while they had the means to prevent it. Simply put without the KMT the PRC would have had control of all of China a long time ago, if not the Japanese.  I'm well aware of the so-called Ryukyu claim: it was a one-off provocation by a certain group of people. It's not official policy. Btw it says May of 2013, this was two years ago.  PRC think tanks are also making hundreds of claims all around Asia expanding as wide as the American continent and as high as and low as both the Arctic and Antarctica.  PRC think tanks are not the PRC, fortunately. They consider, but do not decide PRC foreign policy."
taiwan,3dtcjg,ShrimpCrackers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:19:01 2015 UTC,"It's not a one-off in 2013. They've made claims earlier in state papers in 2012 as well.. In fact a half a dozen events have occurred and a change in history textbooks. They're testing the waters. The reaction was overwhelmingly negative when they did it. But traditionally we follow the think tanks and eventually it makes its way to policy. China still claims that the Ryukyu and Okinawan are not Japanese and they still say they the powers paid tribute to the Chinese dynasties of then.  I'm saying history repeats itself and we've seen this happen half a dozen times already with the PRC. If anything, they're not process unique, they operate the same way.  You claim this is a one off provocation by senior members of China's top think tank and left out an editorial in their state papers and the fact that China has now changed its history books to basically say all of Asia paid tribute to Ancient China, and the other hand saying all nations that paid tribute can and may possible be returned to China one day. Way to downplay this thorn in your argument by ignoring one and the other and pretending it's just ""a certain group of people"" who happen to create policy ideas for the PRC and then dismissing the other related events.  Again, China is doing the same thing it did when it laid claims on Mongolia, East Turkestan, Tibet, parts of Russia, Nepal, India, Vietnam, etc. It's primary think tanks come up with the idea, along with military officials and they push for it, test it, adjust and then retry. The process takes decades but it's worked well so far. In the last 70 years, China has expanded it's circle of influence and border lines dramatically and more than doubled in size, especially if we count its expanding presence in the South China Seas. It's naive to pretend they're content."

Wang Jin-ping might the candidate with the best odds, but without any experience in the executive system (Tsai was at least Vice Premier once), he would be a hard sell.  Now knowing that this is basically a fight that is sure to lose, it is not surprising that every possible candidate in KMT is avoiding it like the plague. Which means in a sense, I think KMT put Hung up there to lose -- While Hung will certainly see this as an opportunity to put up a fight, KMT is realistically looking 4 years down the road already."

So unless your ""Verizon phone"" is dual-band, like recent models of Apple and Samsung phones (not sure about other models), then chances are your phone is CDMA and won't work in Taiwan. So first find out if your phone is dual-band or not.  Even if your phone is dual-band, you may not get 4G in Taiwan depending on which frequencies it uses. For example, during my recent trip, my wife and I both brought our phones, namely an AT&T GSM iPhone 6 Plus and Sprint dual-band Galaxy S5, both unlocked. I was able to get 4G (and amazingly fast speed) with the iPhone but only 3G with the Galaxy S5 and this was with FarEasTone. You can just Google and find out the 4G frequencies used by your phone and the mobile company you will be using."

taiwan,3dutyi,mantrap2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:32:31 2015 UTC,The world plan is annoying in that you retain the US number and people are reluctant to call it.  Also it sometimes shows up on caller ID as unknown caller.
taiwan,3dutyi,fu_ben,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:47:29 2015 UTC,Phone companies work her similarly to the US but not exactly.  You can bring your own unlocked device but you want to double check which LTE bands it has and which LTE bands your carrier supports.  Otherwise you will not be able to use LTE.  Also until you get your ARC you will need to do a prepaid as they wont give you a contract without the ARC/APRC.  If you do the contract they will offer you a phone similar to the US.  You would then need to put a deposit down and you basically wont have a phone bill for the first 5-8 months.  If you do get a phone though it should be fully unlocked.

taiwan,3dutyi,worldwidethrowaway,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:10:40 2015 UTC,"I just did this.  Here is the short version of what I found for prepaid (your mileage may differ): - You need a GSM unlocked phone - Phone must be compatible with 3G or 4G - Plans always include data - There are phone stores everywhere - Only limited Mandarin required - Two forms of ID - Cheapest phones for purchase were around $250-270 TWD - Free wi-fi was not so good, although the online signup said you had to have a registered phone and I don't and it still worked  The longer version:  Most people told me that it is easiest to buy prepaid at the airport, but the stores there closed earlier than I arrived.  I don't speak much Mandarin, but was able to get by with some vocabulary learned in advance.  Most of the clerks probably speak English and they use English for many of the things like ""3G.""     I'd be leery of signing a contract, because I can't read Chinese.  If you can read Chinese or have a friend who could do it for you, that will be a cheaper option.  Overall phone service is much cheaper in Taiwan than the U.S.; buying prepaid in the U.S. is cheap but the cost per unit is very expensive.  A potential option:  T-mobile sells really cheap phones in the U.S. that are 3G/GSM for prepaid.  Like $30-40 USD cheap.  However, the unlock requirements say something about having to use a particular dollar amount and having owned the phone for a certain period of time.  Neither requirement was very high.  You can buy these phones at places like Walgreens, CVS, Target, etc."

If you don't have a car you'll waste time getting to and from CingJing.   Yilan has farms and agrotourism and you can get lots of good information about all that at the Yilan station. There is also a small town one strain stop away called Jiaoxi which is famous for hot springs. You may get more bang for your buck skipping CingJing.   You have such a short amount of time in Taiwan, but I have to say coming to Taiwan and not seeing at least Taroko Gorge and maybe even Kenting seems to be a shame. Hualien (Taroko Gorge) is about an hour-an hour and a half south of Yilan and is one of my favourite places on the island. Great and cheap food, charming town (as Taiwanese towns go) and easy access by taxi, private car, rented scooter, or tour bus through the gorge. Taking your health into account, the gorge is still easily accessible by vehicle and you don't have to walk or hike at all if you don't want to.   The last thing is that a tunnel from Taipei to Yilan opened up relatively recently and by bus takes about half the time to get to Taipei that the train does.

Those roads have lots of twists and turns and go quite high up the elevation. There could be road blocks after a typhoon. If you were coming during the summer for only 1 week, I would just spend 2 night in Taipei, 2 in Yi-Lan and 2 in Taroko.   Yi-lan has became a very popular weekend getaway destination.

taiwan,3du5rj,just_face,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:04:31 2015 UTC,"Doctors in Taiwan can easily just tell the Taiwanese public to suck their AIDS dispenser.  Doctors are underpaid and the system is way overtaxed, what is the public really going to do about shit treatment?"
taiwan,3du5rj,Roygbiv0415,0,Sun Jul 19 14:44:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I'm understanding this article right.  The reason doctors can only complain privately on facebook, is because what the patient's family is doing is legal. They have to right to record everything the doctor says and does, and they have to right to sue the doctor with these evidence if they believe the doctor indeed mistreat. You can't tell them to stop, as they can sue you if you do that.  Therefore, it's not a legal issue, but rather the mistrust of the families that are disappointing to doctors. There are no guarantees in treatment, especially in a overwhelming situation like the Formosa Fun Park disaster. And by recording, the families are showing great disrespect to the doctors that are doing everything they can to save people, as they can become more constrained by the worry about being sued afterwards.   I have friends and classmates working in the medicine field, and I can say that they went on becoming doctors knowing full well that this is the reality -- that you will work day in and day out, sacrificing personal time and family, just so you can get sued. Most of them are already submitted to the fact, and generally don't complain on social media. From what I know, it would take some really extra irksome relatives to have these people complain out loud.  In the end, I think this is a very badly written post, with no regards to reality, and would do nothing but hurt our helpless and overworked doctors even more. Personally I'd put all those recording equipment away and thank my doctor everyday if I'm hospitalized, they deserve nothing less."
taiwan,3du5rj,TaiwanLawBlog,2,Sun Jul 19 17:19:33 2015 UTC,"It is definitely a legal issue. Hospitals can definitely ban the use of recording devices based on privacy concerns for other patients and the fact that they are not public spaces. It is just a matter of whether the legal counsels of the hospitals want to protect their employees, and clearly, they don't. This is what I was getting at with #4 though I chose to not be explicit about it in the post: ""If that doesn’t work, call security. Help create a standard safety protocol for dealing with uncooperative or hostile patients and relatives that protects your legal rights. Seek the prosecution of the harassers if warranted.""  There's really no point in arguing whether my post is based on reality if you don't think it comports with yours. I'll just say that I view things from a legal angle. I do disagree with you though that looking for legal solutions would ""do nothing but hurt our helpless and overworked doctors even more"" but since you do not back up this conclusory statement, there is nothing for me to say in response."

taiwan,3dr40b,richardtheassassin,3,Sat Jul 18 22:19:04 2015 UTC,"You need the work permit to get a resident visa.  Then, within 15 days of arrival in Taiwan, you need to apply for your work ARC. You'll need your health check for that, so you can get that when you arrive. It takes about ten days for the health check to be completed (or sooner), so it's best to do it immediately.  Keep the receipt from the health check, as you may be able to be reimbursed a slight amount. Basically, if you see a doctor without national healthcare, it may cost a little bit more, but you have about a month to bring the receipt and your health card to be reimbursed the difference between NHS cost and personal cost. I'm not sure if there is a difference between the health check, though."
taiwan,3dr40b,ShrimpCrackers,2,Sun Jul 19 03:29:03 2015 UTC,"The way I remember it, I got a resident visa and work permit prior to arrival, and my ARC was then processed within the first two weeks after arrival.  I did not do anything myself for the ARC, other than giving the necessary documents to my employer after arrival.  The process may be different for English teachers, however, since you folks need to get tested for worms and get approved by the Ministry of Education."

I kept saying, ""I just got back from X country, and my research says this happened within the last 4 years"". And he's like ""Well my data is from 10-30 years ago and it's still true even though I haven't kept up in a decade"". As if things in East Asia don't change, ever.

You can make the same criticism about any industry as soon as you become an expert, you realize the vast majority in any industry are terrible. It's as if you guys from /r/TCJ are not familiar with any industries in general or at least haven't thought about this and are just picking an easy target. Lets face it, you guys are just bullies.  Do you know how many shitty engineers infest major companies? Or how many crappy contractors there are in construction? Or terrible doctors and nurses in hospitals all across the world leading to many deaths that could have been prevented (and made unknown to relatives)? Or horrible lawyers? I'm lucky enough to work across a few industries, every industry is filled to the brim with incompetents.  There might be a lack of verification, regulations and enforcement in ESL, just like most professions in Taiwan. that said, it doesn't give Tyberos the right to assume everyone doing ESL is an asshole. There are plenty that work hard and try their best and are pretty effective."
taiwan,3dpgq2,DerpyDogs,0,Sat Jul 18 09:59:14 2015 UTC,"No not really.

taiwan,3dpgq2,ShrimpCrackers,2,Sat Jul 18 13:17:40 2015 UTC,"Actually no, racism gives foreigners a bad name. The number of crimes and what not among foreigners is not really that much higher or crazier than locals and to be honest the ratio of local ESL teachers that are terrible are not any less as well.  How often do you have some local that can only speak Chinglish, trying to teach at some cafe in Taiwan? I witness this kind of thing all the time while grabbing a drink at Starbucks. How often do you see some English series written by some local (like One Breath English) who can barely piece together a sentence doing some special at Eslite or another bookstore? Yeah all the time. Exactly. So ESL in general is a questionable field because some person who scored a 106 on his TOEFL can still sound like an idiot when speaking. However you singling them out because /r/TaiwanCircleJerk has chosen to blame them for all their little problems is embarrassing and kind of petty.  I am an engineer, don't tell me how they don't try and skirt professionalism or ethics out of fear or being punished. You think our awesome infrastructure delays in Taiwan is due to competence and ethics? How about Nuclear Plant #4 where they skirted so many safety mechanisms that GE pulled out?

Everyone agrees that there are serious deficits in the quality of ESL teachers in Taiwan. The most ridiculous thing about these conversations in /r/Taiwan is that I still get massively downvoted for being serious and saying something like   Taiwanese students deserve qualified teachers and teaching standards should be higher.

You've wrote that they are preying on children and are unqualified and should get out and let the local Taiwanese ESL teachers teach, yet on the same page will say, ""I'm not attacking their character"".  So clearly the downvote but don't reply didn't work and now you're trying to say, ""Oh noes, I'm getting criticized here, please don't reply"". But you're missing the fact that the only reason I'm replying is not because I feel like changing your mind or pointing out your actions, you know full well what you're doing considering you made an entire subreddit mostly dedicated to attacking ESL teachers, but because I feel they need defending. It's not fair that we have regulars here who do work hard and are qualified but you get to bash their profession and their person all the time before you even know who they are yet ironically get concerned when the same is applied to you based on your writing.  Too often you get free reign to attack them and few of them have any clue that most of /r/Taiwan simply doesn't feel this way.

taiwan,3dpgq2,Tyberos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:12:05 2015 UTC,"They should raise the minimum teaching requirements to ensure Taiwanese kids are getting the best education they can get. Foreign teachers should be required to pass an exam, proving that they understand the language they are expected to teach. Teachers should, at a minimum, have teaching credentials. There shouldn't be foreigners teaching very young children. There are plenty of qualified English-speaking Taiwanese that can teach basic English courses. Schools that can't hire the minimally qualified should go out of business."
taiwan,3dpgq2,ShrimpCrackers,4,Sat Jul 18 19:11:56 2015 UTC,"Edit: The one regular poster here who is an ESL teacher actually has a masters in linguistics from a well renowned US university. It's stupid to be like this.  First, it's a fallacy to assume there's a correlation with what you assume are specialized ESL professionals with better results. Lets take Japan for an example. Yes the ESL teaching standards there are higher through the JET program and most Japanese students get just as many years of English as standard curriculum. How many people on the street in Japan speak English really well? Compare that to Taiwan. Most Japanese people couldn't speak English on the most basic communicable level. How about South Korea? You've been there right? How many people actually speak English there?  Half the people even in 7-Eleven's in Taiwan speak some English. Good luck trying that in Lawson's Station, I know because I've tried. I've had Japanese people bow on the ground in apologies because they couldn't help at all. Or Family Mart in Pusan where I had no luck. Yet we have plenty of people that can speak some English working in convenience stores all over Taiwan, and these guys are supposedly some of the most common laborers in Taiwan working in a job that has almost no barrier to entry. So easily you've got a ton more people speaking much better English in Taiwan than Japan and South Korea.  Secondly you mention that there are plenty of qualified English speaking Taiwanese. You must be kidding because that avoids the problem where parents are not willing to send their kids to a buxiban where some local Taiwanese may speak questionable English. How often have you been to Starbucks to grab or drink and you hear some local Taiwanese guy totally screwing up what they're teaching to adults? I've talked to some of my ""local"" Taiwanese English teachers for my nephew and most of them couldn't communicate in English on the most basic level either. They did have certifications and degrees though. It's as you said, if the buxibans can't afford a decent teacher, then they shouldn't be open. True. How is that the fault of the some random guy getting hired as an ESL teacher. That's the fault of the buxiban. You're expecting someone to care? OP may not have a TESOL, but if he's been with the JET program for three years, he's already better than the pool that many people have right now.  Third, to be honest, most Taiwanese students are NOT willing to learn English either. Look at how many great non-native Spanish speakers there are in America? I can barely piece together a few words and I've been learning Spanish as a secondary language for over a decade in public school, yet my average was something like the 90's for that. Most Americans take many years of Spanish yet those that don't speak or live in a Spanish neighborhood barely speak the language. In Japan almost no one cares about learning English.  So basically you're blaming ESL teachers in Taiwan for the fact that by ratio, more Taiwanese people speak English along with better proficiency than Japan and South Korea and in much better proficiency in most except Singapore and Hong Kong? All in the guise of ""What Taiwanese students deserve?""  Please, it's as you said, you make fun of them because they're easy targets and you wrote that you think it's funny."
taiwan,3dpgq2,Tyberos,-1,Sat Jul 18 20:17:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know anything about Japan or Korea, and I don't know about the English proficiency of 7-11 employees in Taiwan, because I only speak Mandarin when I'm dealing with Taiwanese.  My opinion on the quality of ESL teachers in Taiwan is based on the quality of the people in that profession that I have met, and based on the opinions of many Taiwanese I talked to about this issue. You can write five more pages to prove your point, but it doesn't change my opinion of some of the lousy teachers I've met and it won't change my spouse's opinion of ESL education for young children."
taiwan,3dpgq2,ShrimpCrackers,3,Sat Jul 18 20:39:58 2015 UTC,"I can't hope to change your anecdotal opinion. But the facts are a much higher ratio of the Taiwanese population speaks English and better English than say virtually all the other nations in Asia except for Singapore and Hong Kong. We can't hope to match the latter two because we can't even approach the pay rates they offer.  I strongly disagree with your earlier assumption that local Taiwanese teachers must be better qualified to teach English. Many are actually even worse.  We both agree that they need to raise the standards, but I don't think it's the fault of ESL teachers in general, but the fault of the buxibans and schools. Regardless some of the blame must be given to students, considering how few Americans even speak passable Spanish, I think you should forgive how well Taiwan has come in this department, relatively speaking.  Wow you're married? I thought you were still in your early 20's."

Anyway, native speakers are perhaps most essential for the youngest kids. Extended exposure to a native English accent from a young age can benefit kids a lot in terms of syntax, grammar and phonics. Some kids I know here take an intensive reading class five days a week and, as a result, have no distinguishable accent. English is completely normalized in their lives, and they can absorb culture and knowledge almost equally in Mandarin and English. But it's because they've been doing it since kindergarten and always from a native-speaking English teacher.  English is improving here, but I've met very few Taiwanese people, however capable, who don't have some kind of accent or Taiwanese Mandarin inflection in their speech. The longer kids learn those inflections at a young age, the more they stick. It might seem ironic, but locals right now are better suited to teaching the more technical grammar skills that are best understood through analyzing them in books.  Also, on the subject of credentials, if it were easy to acquire and pay for all these certified teachers, then I'm sure Taiwan would be doing that. Things aren't so bad in the west yet for that many certified teachers to have to leave home for work, but don't worry, it's getting there. If western economies continue to degrade, and universities keep pumping out this many BEd's, then perhaps it will be the norm in the future for young teachers to do their first few years overseas. The economy in Taiwan seems quite viable, and supply and demand are playing their role. You're hating the players when it's the game that you seem frustrated about."

If you're not smiling at old ladies at the traditional market (for example) you're really missing out on part of the vibe :) anyway, there's no expat secret handshake and you'll start to look pretty goofy if you're giving other westerners a knowing nod or wink when you pass by.  That being said, there is something a little different about seeing another obvious westerner in a more local part of Taiwan. I lived in Changhua City all winter and it was quite rare that I'd see any if I wasn't riding my bike down buxiban lane. I struck up a few conversations here and there and definitely encountered a few anti-social people who were obviously used to living in a bubble, but also several friendly people with whom it was nice to exchange a word or two in English. It sounds as if you're already sensitive to social cues... so the only other thing I'd advise is not falling into the trap of assuming you have much in common with someone just because they resemble you.  By the same token, you also shouldn't assume that Asian-looking people are Taiwanese, born in Taiwan, can't speak English, etc. There's a sizable community of culturally western and ethnically Asian people in Taiwan too (not to mention all the non-Taiwanese Asians living in Taiwan who are, after all, the vast majority of the expat or foreign population).

taiwan,3dp4ov,ShrimpCrackers,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:37:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks - you make some good points. I think the ""look, another human"" point of view is valid, but from living in Japan, there is also that thing that happens when you encounter someone who seems like they may be from the West and might speak your language, and you're in an area where it's uncommon (not Tokyo or other big metropolis). I wouldn't assume they speak English, though they usually do, and there is often mutual curiosity in those situations.   I've heard members of minority races talk about a similar thing in the US when they're in an overwhelmingly white area and they come across each other, and that commonality can create an instant connection. And I've heard others say this is silly, and ""don't come over to me at the party just because we're the only two black guys here.""    Of course you can ""acknowledge"" people on the street but don't you do that with Taiwanese people anyway? If you're not smiling at old ladies at the traditional market (for example) you're really missing out on part of the vibe :)   Since I'm so new, I'm currently just being overwhelmed with sensation and trying not to get hit by scooters and trying to stay out of the way, but I def try to be warm to others. This is Day 4 for me and I've jumped around a bit, so I don't have a market routine or anything - I'm missing out on pretty much everything at this point, not just the vibe.   By the same token, you also shouldn't assume that Asian-looking people are Taiwanese, born in Taiwan, can't speak English, etc.    Oh, I definitely don't - I hear people speaking all sorts of languages on the train and such, and I'm aware that there are many residents here who could pass for Taiwanese and speak the language perfectly but are expats.

taiwan,3dl6tc,JillyPolla,5,Fri Jul 17 21:31:16 2015 UTC,"First, that's a terrible idea. Lets point out that we always end up spending more (or losing lives) because we want to save money.  It's like no one learns from the past that hiring cheap and going cheap is always a bad idea. Like the dust explosion that occurred a few weeks ago because they went cheap and made their own flammable version or the MRT construction failure that crushed a few people. Look at our Taipei MRT system where we went cheap and then ended up paying so much to fix it that at one point it was the most expensive Metro system in the world by kilometer, and it was delayed by many years also. We can also look at the cost of the #4 Nuclear Power Plant which is being dismantled before it even began because it can't pass safety inspections since we went cheap on safety, so much so that we could have built another two plants. So nothing good is going to come with Chinese companies, which have dubious safety records, from building in Taiwan in an area far more ""hostile"" than terrain in China with safety standards that exceeds China. And it's not like if anyone dies from safety issues, we can just bury the trains and the bodies outright and forbid any actual investigation, just like they did in China a few years back to international shock and horror.  We could do the right thing; buying it off the shelf from existing Japanese or Canadian companies (like Bombardier) that are world famous with an excellent track record (pun not intended). The up front cost would be more, but it's cheaper in the long run than having half a decade of delays and a bunch of problems that wouldn't have existed if we did it right. Had we done so, we'd have a far more efficient MRT system by now. We almost always end up going to them anyway, look at our own Shinkansen (I mean, HSR, even the train cars are straight from Japan) look at our MRT system which ended up using Bombardier anyway.  We keep making the same mistakes by going cheap, and it keeps biting us in the ass. Shouldn't we have learned by now?"
taiwan,3dl6tc,ShrimpCrackers,6,Sat Jul 18 00:24:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Taiwanese companies mostly go for cheap and then end up delivering shit products, will they ever learn to put quality first? (no)"
taiwan,3dl6tc,Orangetinyfeet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:11:44 2015 UTC,"There's no such thing as buying trains ""off the shelf,"" which implies that there are trains lying around unused in Japan or Germany waiting for operators to buy them. Trains are made to order in accordance with the specifications provided by the purchaser. I suspect you mean match the specifications to an existing product line, which, sure, let's go with that definition. It might be cheaper to do this, but then you end up with products that don't match your needs.  The Muzha Line MRT that went so wildly over time and over budget? That was bought off the shelf! There's a very similar system being used as a people mover in O'Hare International Airport! Of course the problem was that it was designed for 2-car operation which wouldn't have provided nearly enough capacity, so the manufacturer promised that it would develop a 4-car solution by joining together two trainsets--only they did it so incompetently that they caused a fire accident, a huge delay, money down the drain, etc.  I also find it odd that you're praising Taiwan HSR in the same breath as bashing the Airport MRT, considering its opening was delayed nearly two years due to a very difficult systems testing phase (exactly the same reason that the Airport MRT keeps getting delayed). Not to mention the Banqiao-Taipei section has that one switch that STILL fails every now and then without anyone knowing why exactly.  Back to the Airport MRT--I don't expect we'll ever find out exactly why they keep failing operation stability tests, but I suspect it'll be because this particular line's operations are much more complex than any other metro line in Taiwan. Two different types of trains, with a different number of cars, that need to sync up perfectly with platform doors, and also need to overtake each other using passing sidings--only the TRA needs to deal with this level of complexity, and we all know how well it does with that (and come to think of it, the TRA doesn't have to deal with platform doors either). These specifications are extremely unique among urban rail systems around the world, and I honestly can't think of one off the top of my head that has all of these features--maybe one of the Tokyo commuter rail lines would use both passing sidings and platform doors? Anyway this certainly precludes buying existing train sets, unless you want to go back and redesign the entire system.  Oh, and the overall technical systems for the Airport MRT is being handled by Marubeni, and the rolling stock is being made by Kawasaki. Both Japanese companies that have plenty of experience with major transport projects. I'm sure there's a lot to criticize about the bidding process for this particular project, but choosing no-name contractors is not one of them."
taiwan,3dl6tc,pipedreamer220,2,Sat Jul 18 14:22:21 2015 UTC,"By off the shelf, I am using the colloquial term, similarly to how China's space program is basically off the shelf from the Russian one, considering they can even dock with Soyuz and have interchangeable parts.  Secondly, I didn't say the HSR was amazing. I said they ended up doing the same thing, the HSR is exactly the same as the Japanese Shinkansen with a different interior color scheme.  Why mess around so much and then end up going to the same exact companies anyway.  The ONLY reason we went the Airport Tram route for the Muzha line is just like why the MaoKong Gondola uses stock ski-gondolas, its because they thought they could do it cheaper rather than using a proper system designed for it."
taiwan,3dl6tc,ShrimpCrackers,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:49:52 2015 UTC,"But that's what I was saying--by using off the shelf trains, you risk getting trains and systems that don't fit your needs.  The Airport MRT has some really unusual specifications, including the steep grade needed to climb up the Linkou plateau, the need for a separate baggage car, and the complex operations involved. They would always have needed to start from scratch with this."
taiwan,3dl6tc,pipedreamer220,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:11:45 2015 UTC,"Seriously, there was no one else with this kind of experience and the same kind of issues? Is it much more technical challenging than say, Osaka International Airport? I'm having a hard time believing that it's that difficult."
taiwan,3dl6tc,ShrimpCrackers,2,Sun Jul 19 06:10:44 2015 UTC,"The Osaka Airport rail connection is a spur off existing mainline rail, using the same signalling and train control systems as JR West and Nankai (the two rail operators serving the airport) were already using. Of course the two companies also bought new trainsets to run the service, but it's usually a lot easier to add new trainsets when your systems are up and running smoothly. If you want to draw a comparison, that project was more like when the TRA Eastern mainline was electrified and the Taroko and Puyuma trains entered service--some new infrastructure (bridges and tunnels) and new trains, but no new systems. And it went smoothly.  There was actually a proposal to serve Taoyuan Airport through upgrading and slightly extending the existing TRA Linkou Line, instead of building a whole new system. That would have been done cheaper and faster than what we're seeing now, but it would have massively screwed over capacity on the TRA mainline. And of course people were pretty wary of the TRA as a service provider."
taiwan,3dl6tc,pipedreamer220,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:51:07 2015 UTC,"Then I can't be thinking of Osaka then, I'm thinking of one of the airports in the Kansai area that has its own rail system and is also automatically run, does not have a conductor or anything like that.  I concede that you seem a lot more knowledgable on this specific case, it's just my impression that Taiwan authorities are always trying to ""save money"" by going the cheap yet obviously more expensive route (for graft purposes), so their solution is always to build crap and then purposely make sure it never gets completed.  I mean think of it this way, the new Syntrend Building, which is much larger took less time to build than the ""new"" Guanghwa building that looks ancient and old and in some places is already falling apart. That new building (not Syntrend's) in Taipei was supposed to take just 2.5 or so years to complete, and it ended up taking like 6 years with extensive cost overruns. Pretty clear that compared to Syntrend, the new Guanghwa building is just about 10 years older and it's terribly designed and not actually cheaper. So the whole project was basically a waste of time and money and I'm told by some that there are considerations behind the scenes to tear down this building in around a decade to build a new one."
taiwan,3dl6tc,ShrimpCrackers,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:57:47 2015 UTC,"Ah, you're talking about Osaka's smaller airport, which serves domestic flights. It is indeed served by a dedicated monorail system. (Monorails are kind of controversial, as seen by the fact that there's a Simpsons episode devoted to mocking them, but that's not really relevant here.)  I agree that many projects in Taiwan are harmed by going cheap. I just disagree that this is a common problem for rail transport projects. I think the only rail project where trying to save money completely backfired was the Taichung Blue Line, and that was ""we're not building this project anymore, have fun with a much more inferior substitute"" instead of ""we're skimping on design/materials."""

Trains that run once every 10 or 15 minutes just don't have the capacity to handle that kind of crowds. Pingxi relies on buses (and strict control of private cars) and does fine every year.

What exact options you have will depend on your location, but throughout most of Taipei, it is a duopoly between Kbro and CNS. There is normally first a fee for standard definition (SD) content, paid either monthly, seasonally, bi-annually, or annually. I can't find the numbers for Kbro, but CNS reports NT$495 a month for some 100 odd channels.  On top of that, there are the digital HD channels. CNS only has Fox Sports, and the cheapest package that includes this channel asks for a further NT$99/mo.  Kbro on the other hand, has Fox Sports and Euro Sport in its sport package, but I (again) could not find pricing info.  Adding Wi-Fi to the mix would total NT$850/mo for a 60M/5M connection on the CNS side (here is the page with all the packages, but it's in Chinese though), and... gawd, I give up looking for prices on Kbro. Their website isn't helpful at all.  That said, absolutely no one I know of uses coaxial cable internet. I'm not entirely certain as to why (maybe some other redditor who have tried can shed some light on the issue) but the consensus seems to be that the speed is unreliable and international connection slow. Most Taiwanese will go to cable providers for TV only, and use CHT, TFN, or other provider's FTTH / FTTB service for internet. Total cost would be much higher -- that would be NT$600 on the cable TV side, and a further NT$935/mo for CHT's 60M/20M service -- but FTTH is much more stable (or so I'm told).  FTTH service goes up to 300M/100M. Coaxial service goes up to 300M/30M for Kbro, and 120M/10M for CNS."

Would you say pushing Beijing for de jure recognition of the ROC and the fact that Taiwan does not belong to the PRC, and making them promise that they would not solve the Taiwan problem with force sound like pro-unification to you?

Hung Hsiu-chu's eye is clearly opposed to outright independence and she represents a party racked with disfunction and not in tune with the Taiwanese people.  I am not certain Tsai Ing-wen favors de-jure independence for the foreseeable future due to the realities of an increasingly belligerent China, but at least her past comments suggests to me that she supports the idea, even if only theoretically.

My question is: how and why is this happening? Does she really enjoy the support of a majority of the KMT and this latest shakeup is just the ejection of those on the distant side within the party? Is nobody reading the writing on the walls?"
taiwan,3dgutl,dorylinus,8,Thu Jul 16 05:01:47 2015 UTC,"The KMT's power structure allows it to more or less ignore the rank and file if the deep-blue core is committed enough. You've probably heard of the infamous 黃復興黨部, the veterans' wing of the party which is deeply pro-China and generally supports the KMT's core political dynasty. They're small in terms of headcount but have outsize influence on the KMT's policies. Last year they were the ones who screwed Ting Shou-chung 丁守中 out of the Taipei mayor nomination despite him being a highly popular legislator who was outpolling Sean Lien. Most people agree that Ting would likely have beaten Ko, or at least kept it close and avoided the catastrophic drag that Lien had on other KMT candidates. But 黃復興 wants what it wants, and what it wanted was Lien.  To some extent this is what is happening now. But you also have to remember that the deep blue support for Hung would not have materialized if Eric Chu hadn't run screaming from the nomination. Chu was the anointed successor of the party, and his nomination would have been a foregone conclusion the moment he declared that he was running. But he didn't have the balls to swallow the probable loss that was coming to him, and so the deep blues' id was allowed to run unchecked in the form of Hung."
taiwan,3dgutl,pipedreamer220,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:47:24 2015 UTC,"Curiously, google renders ""復興黨"" as ""Baath party"". Is this intentional?  I'm mostly surprised that the KMT would allow themselves to march straight into a loss like this without at least trying to pivot to more popular positions, or at least recognizing their specific weaknesses and trying to focus or ""rebaseline"" the discussion elsewhere.   I could hypothesize all sorts of reasons why this is could happen, but I'm still just a newcomer here and not familiar enough with Taiwan politics. It's possible that I'm missing some part of the story here."
taiwan,3dgutl,dorylinus,3,Thu Jul 16 06:52:13 2015 UTC,"without at least trying to pivot to more popular positions   They've been trying to get Hung to tone down her deep, deep Blue rhetoric. I do recall reading something a few days ago that Hung had, essentially, given in a bit and agreed to come a bit closer to the party line, though not as near as the KMT would like."
taiwan,3dgutl,Get9,3,Thu Jul 16 07:02:43 2015 UTC,"Haha--復興 means ""revitalization/revival,"" especially of a culture or nation, and Wiki tells me that Ba'ath means renaissance or resurrection, so it's no wonder that Google Translate got confused.  I really don't think it's confusing that the KMT is doubling down on unpopular positions, because plenty of political parties do that. Look at what the Republicans are doing with regards to gay marriage/Obamacare/immigration reform--it's a similar dynamic.  Of course there are also unique cultural factors--for one, the KMT has never been too concerned with electoral popularity, because for a good 80% of its lifetime in Taiwan it could always win elections simply by overwhelming the opposition with its resources. It's also been a longstanding narrative in Taiwanese politics that voters look for ""stability"" and thus the KMT will always retain a majority of votes nationally barring extenuating circumstances. All of this has led to the KMT being unskilled at appealing to the electorate (except through corruption, of course) and not caring that much about it."

I have heard this particular narrative before as well. My friend was explaining that (in his opinion) Taiwanese people were not used to, and didn't really like, division in their government, and would vote KMT just because they preferred a consistent position and consistent voice."
taiwan,3dgutl,dorylinus,3,Thu Jul 16 07:33:54 2015 UTC,"I think that last year and 2016 will prove the final deathblow to this narrative.  I do think that it was true for the 1990s all the way into the mid-2000s. Really, the whole reason that the DPP managed to become a viable contender for national office was because the KMT just could not keep its shit together. The KMT should easily have won both 2000 and 2004 if it had just put James Soong on the top of the ticket. Chen Shui-bian became a political superstar by winning the 1994 Taipei mayoral election with 43% of the vote, against two pan-blue candidates who split the votes 30-25. And the DPP's first significant nation-wide electoral win, the 1997 local elections when it won a bunch of county magistrate seats, was also in the context of a shambolic performance by the KMT (including not one but two races in which the KMT managed to nominate two candidates)."
taiwan,3dgutl,pipedreamer220,3,Thu Jul 16 07:47:03 2015 UTC,It pretty much is a blow. I've heard a few times back in 2008 that the KMT was better at managing the economy or whatever nonsense they came up with. But their handling of the agreements with China and Taiwan's economy has pretty much trashed that image. Nobody says that now.
taiwan,3dgutl,DarkLiberator,0,Thu Jul 16 07:57:06 2015 UTC,"I really doubt James Soong wanted to actually cooperate with the KMT. His whole gimmick is basically threatening to run in elections to split the vote in order to get political concessions. At the time of the 2000 election, Soong actually had his own design for the KMT."
taiwan,3dgutl,JillyPolla,5,Thu Jul 16 07:58:27 2015 UTC,"What? Soong only left the KMT because he didn't get the presidential nomination he was expecting. He would easily have been a two-term KMT president if the party had run him in 2000. And in 2004 he ran on the KMT ticket.   What do you mean that he ""has his own design for the KMT""? He wanted to run the party after Lee retired, yes, but I don't see how this (completely justified, completely open) desire makes him some sort of nefarious schemer. When you're the party's most popular and gifted politician of your generation, then of course you'd expect that you'll eventually lead your party and run for president on its nomination."
taiwan,3dgutl,pipedreamer220,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:10:19 2015 UTC,"My point was that he wanted to get the nomination, where he'd be leading the KMT as opposed to Lee. With Lee at the leadership position of KMT, Soong was not going to get the nomination. The streamlining of Taiwan Province was basically a power struggle between Lee and Soong, where Lee eliminated Soong's power base.   Thus, there was no chance that Soong would've cooperated with Lee's KMT. At that time, many of the KMT were dissatisfied with Lee's Taiwan Independence bent. So no, I don't blame him for doing what he did. But at the same time, it's quite clear to see why Soong wouldn't have gotten the nomination and worked with the KMT at that time."
taiwan,3dgutl,JillyPolla,3,Thu Jul 16 08:22:33 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, obviously Soong was prevented from getting the nomination by an internal KMT power struggle--but that's part of the KMT dysfunction I was talking about, where (a) the wrong people (from an electoral perspective) win power struggles because of the party power structure/cultural factors I talked about above, and (b) people who lose power struggles just up and leave instead of working with the party.  Contrast this with the DPP--the so-called 四大天王 were pissed after 2008 that an upstart like Tsai Ing-wen, who didn't even join the party until the mid-2000s, nipped them all to become party chairwoman. But Su Tseng-chang didn't leave the party, he continued to work with it. Su and Tsai are not friends but they are capable of working toward a common goal, which has not been the case with KMT infighting."
taiwan,3dgutl,pipedreamer220,3,Thu Jul 16 08:36:47 2015 UTC,"This is probably true of much of the older generations--I've heard an older man discussing his first time voting, who said something along the lines of 'Of course I just voted for the KMT, we were all 乖 [well-behaved/obedient] students...'. I think it has less to do with a consistent position and voice for the nation than being raised in a culture where the party is bigger than the nation, and those outside the party are a threat. Not a big surprise that it would take a generation after the end of that thought to really start seeing change."
taiwan,3dgutl,Ifkl,-1,Thu Jul 16 12:09:56 2015 UTC,"Well, you have to realize the stability can also apply to economy as well. Since Taiwan Independence is more likely to cause catastrophic events, Taiwan would like stability in the sense that supporting the KMT means less likely to get into war. On the other hand, many actually have strong business ties with the Mainland, nad they fear that DPP's anti China trade policies will adversely harm their business."

taiwan,3dgutl,JillyPolla,11,Thu Jul 16 05:07:46 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but that's not the case. For one thing, the Foundation was created AFTER Tsai was defeated in the 2012 elections, not, as you claim, ""when she was gearing up for a presidential run."" Secondly, it is not a DPP propaganda media and is not institutionally linked to the DPP; it's like any other think tank in the U.S. Lastly, when Tsai hired me, I made her promise that I would never be pressured to write anything or asked to self-censor, a promise that she has 100% abided by. Thus, the arguments are my own, and one doesn't have to work for a think tank that was started by Tsai three years ago to believe that Hung is a bad thing for Taiwan. In fact, I argue that this is bad for the KMT. You'll find plenty of criticism of the DPP in my articles and books if you bother to look. Yes, I have my biases, just like every other on the face of the planet. But I also have a mind of my own and have already quit two jobs when I was forced to censor - one in intelligence, one in the media. I would not hesitate to do so again."

I'm also a senior fellow with the China Policy Institute at the University of Nottingham, a centre that is largely funded by PRC money. Do you then say that I am paid by Beijing to spew propaganda in its favour, especially when, as we all know, Beijing has a much worse track record of forcing its views on the media and academics than does the pro-democracy DPP? It would be foolish of me to hope that everybody will agree with what I say. I know that's not the case, and I put my name -- and reputation -- out there every time I publish something. But please, if you disagree with something that I say, do so on the field of ideas with your own counterarguments, not through cheap guilt-by-association-type character assassination -- especially when you don't have all the necessary information to pass such judgments."
taiwan,3dgutl,JMichaelCole_AMA,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:15:59 2015 UTC,"First of all, let's not pretend that Thinking Taiwan and University of Nottingham is on the same level. One is a foundation financed by a current presidential candidate. The other is a well established university with history, where one research institute have received financial grants from the PRC. So no, I am not worried about China Policy Institute at Nottingham, at least not as much as I am worried about the integrity and bias of Thinking Taiwan. (Side note: there has been much talk, which I am sure you're aware, of PRC using financial leverage to stifle programs in foreign university).  And since you're here, I will tell you directly where I disagree with you. You characterize Hung's position as pro-Beijing, where the ""one interpretation"" is shown to be One PR China with Taiwan SAR. In reality, her position is actually the most anti-Beijing out of all current main stream ones (no, I don't consider ""recovering the mainland"" or becoming part of Japan ones to be mainstream). From her own words seen here:   所謂和平協定，即是與北京政府談判，要求其接受並白紙黑字承認中華民國，且不能擴大解釋，台灣並不屬於中華人民共和國，也不同意中華民國喪失主權或中方以武力解決兩岸問題，更不同意大陸企圖改變台灣的憲政體制或生活方式  「一中同表」是「92共識的2.0版」，以往只有台灣自己在唱「獨腳戲」，出了國門外，中共卻與各邦交國大肆宣揚「一中」，讓世界各國誤以為「台灣就是中國的一部分」。   So Hung actually wants Beijing to recognize the existence of ROC, and that Taiwan is NOT A PART OF PR CHINA. She also wants Beijing to formally agree to safeguarding the sovereignty of Taiwan and to give up the use of force, and to treat the Taiwanese government as equals. She also calls them out on their diplomatic games. If this is not anti-Beijing, I don't know what is. On the other hand, Tsai's own stance on this issue is not totally clear, but she said that she's for the status quo.  As you can see, Hung doesn't actually want to be part of PR China, she wants to formalize the current status quo with two constitutional governments that's within the same nation."
taiwan,3dgutl,JillyPolla,5,Thu Jul 16 07:00:10 2015 UTC,But she says she doesn't recognize the ROC lol...  She doesn't have any consistency. Nobody trusts her to handle an agreement with China.
taiwan,3dgutl,DarkLiberator,0,Thu Jul 16 07:54:56 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, this is more of DPP cherry picking and twisting words. If you actually look at what she said after the sentence, you'd realize she was talking about ROC and PRC both existing together as two separate nations. As you know, she's against two Chinas, so there's no inconsistency in this."
taiwan,3dgutl,JillyPolla,2,Thu Jul 16 08:16:49 2015 UTC,"So ""one China, common interpretation,"" in which the PRC is asked only to recognize the existence of...the ROC government, not ROC/Taiwan. If Hung's views are so great, them when are party elders leaning on her? Why is Wang Jyn-ping distancing himself from her? Why did Eric Chu after the CSC meeting yesterday grumble about her views? Why did Ma complain that Hung was threatening to undo all his good work (until she watered down the rhetoric after being leaned on by party elders). Why are members in the south threatening a walkout? I find it odd that everybody, including many people within the KMT, seems unable to understand what she means/wants."
taiwan,3dgutl,JMichaelCole_AMA,-4,Thu Jul 16 08:25:46 2015 UTC,"Ahh, so your argument has now been changed from ""she is pro-Beijing"" to ""her view sucks because people tell her it sucks"". To be honest if you don't like her view, that's fine. But don't try to misrepresent it and put your own spin behind it and present it as truth."
taiwan,3dgutl,JillyPolla,3,Thu Jul 16 12:50:16 2015 UTC,You're killing a straw man. It seems like everyone knows exactly what he meant. The fact that members of Hungsnown party are lambasting her is proof enough.
taiwan,3dgutl,ShrimpCrackers,2,Fri Jul 17 10:27:52 2015 UTC,"一中同表   Honestly, this complicates things a lot more. 一中同表 essentially says there's only one China, but with two legitimate governments. If PRC did sign this (which I doubt they will), essentially both PRC and ROC becomes China, a country. What happens when each party is signing separate legal-binding documents with other countries? Do those countries also apply what was negotiated with one to the other? Furthermore, saying there's only ""one China"" with two governments basically admits that we are currently split politically, but not legally. This paves the way for a reunification agreement to be signed.  At least with 一中各表, either party does not admit the legality of each other, and the situation will remain ambiguous."
taiwan,3dgutl,viperabyss,4,Thu Jul 16 13:10:19 2015 UTC,"Though initially funded in part with money obtained from the 2012 election, the Thinking Taiwan Foundation is now funded via fundraising, not by Tsai.  The problem with Hung is that her story keeps changing. A few weeks ago she said that the ROC could not possibly exist because this would create ""two Chinas,"" which was ""unacceptable""! And no, the PRC certainly does not essentially accept two constitutional government -- it's anathema to the CCP."
taiwan,3dgutl,JMichaelCole_AMA,3,Thu Jul 16 07:50:40 2015 UTC,Can you show us the source of the fund from fundraising?  Can I also have the source for her saying ROC cannot exist? I mean I'd understand that she's against Two Chinas as that's basically what she's been saying the whole time.
taiwan,3dgutl,JillyPolla,2,Thu Jul 16 08:04:37 2015 UTC,"To be honest, this is fallacious anyway. You're basically saying anyone associated with Tsai, the DPP and the Pan Greens automatically gets their detailed arguments dismissed. That's a huge logical fallacy and an ad hominem.  You don't see anyone else go, ""She's KMT so anything she says is dismissed."" That's dumb and exclusionary on so many levels. Just let the arguments stand on their own merits. If you're incapable of countering the points then you don't have much of a counter argument."

taiwan,3dgutl,FormosaNation,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:06:24 2015 UTC,"As good as that sounds for Taiwan, Beijing will never agree to that, and Taiwan isn't in any kind of a position to force Beijing into recognising ROC sovereignty. I think this will enrage CCP even more."
taiwan,3dgutl,cosimonh,0,Thu Jul 16 07:10:12 2015 UTC,"At first glance, probably not. But if you really think about it, what is the Hung's proposed peace treaty? It essentially is the recognition of the status quo. All her talk about two constitutional government within Greater China, existence of ROC, etc are essentially accepted as fact by the world, and also by Beijing itself. She just wants this unique situation to be put down on paper, as the starting position of future dealings between both sides. So if Beijing were to agree to that, they'd lose face, but not very much else in reality."

And right after her loss in the election, so when she was gearing up for a second presidential run, like I said.   You talk about think tanks in the US, as if those don't have their own reliability and bias problems? And Tsai's think tank is not even 5 years old, when she is currently in the full midst of a presidential run. Obviously, I cannot comment on your (if you're really JM Cole) arrangement with your employer, since you were there and I wasn't. But to continue the US think tank analogy, I would be suspicious of a think tank started by Hilary Clinton 3 years ago, and whatever studies or articles it may publish, even though I generally vote Democratic personally.  Sure, the foundation is not formally affiliated with the DPP, but given the founding and funding by Tsai, her current presidential run, and her capacity as the head of the DPP, it would not be hard to look at the circumstances and reach one's conclusion about this foundation and its true purposes, especially on an article written on Hung, who, let me remind everyone, is the current chief opponent of Tsai right now."
taiwan,3dgutl,JillyPolla,3,Thu Jul 16 06:43:34 2015 UTC,"Basic media literacy involves recognizing and acknowledging biases, not necessarily rejecting something out of hand. If TT were churning out some equivalent to the kind of global warming denialism you see coming out of some right-wing American think tanks then sure, there'd be good reason to ignore whatever they were putting out... but TT is actually home to some of the better and more insightful English language analysis you'll find about domestic affairs in Taiwan. So, sure, it's valid to point out the source of funding and the kind of spin readers should expect, but TT isn't even close to realm of media outlets you can ignore for this reason alone.  Besides, like I sometimes joke in this sub, reality has a well-known pan-green bias ;)"

Tsai was sort of like that, where she said she wasn't running, but everyone knew that she was coming back.  And of course individuals can have their own will. But ultimately, the salary is paid by the ""paymaster"" and with the foundations founding by Tsai, you'd have to excuse me to view an article on Tsai's chief opponent with a bit of skeptisicm."
taiwan,3dgutl,JillyPolla,2,Thu Jul 16 08:40:15 2015 UTC,"""Everyone knew that she was coming back."" Well, I can tell you that ""everybody"" knew more about that than Tsai herself did, then, as ""coming back"" certainly wasn't her intention after going through the grinder of 2012.  My last comment on this thread: Regardless of what you think about my affiliations and what this means about what I write, my point on Hung is that in my view she is not a good thing for Taiwan, and not for the KMT. If I were a mere DPP mouthpiece, I'd revel at the idea of the KMT having a candidate whose views will very likely cost the party the presidency and perhaps its majority in the LY. Instead, I'd much rather the KMT had a candidate whose views are more aligned with those of the majority of the people in Taiwan -- even if this meant that said candidate would have a better chance of defeating Tsai. My bottom line, and I told her that when she hired me, is what's (in my view) best for Taiwan, not for any political party or politician. And I firmly believe that a KMT that learns to more closely reflect the wishes of the Taiwanese would be beneficial to Taiwan. You'll notice, in fact, that I'm not among those who are revelling at the prospects of the imminent death of the KMT (which I don't believe will happen anyway)."

Chances are that KMT will have to be dismantled if they lose terribly the next presidential election so they dont want to use the more-appropriate candidates for this election (yes, Hung is not appropriate, its like making sarah palin a presidential candidate).   In the next few weeks and months while the KMT is in freefall the ""core"" (meaning anyone with access to party funds) KMT will eventually break off to form a rebranded KMT and make off with the magical KMT party funds in the meantime through magic loophole jumping in order to forever solidify their ill-gotten party assets as private property."

You are more off your rocker than I thought.  Below is the EXACT quoted paragraph from the Time Magazine article. The article ITSELF provides the exact definition of ""wonky"" used immediately following the word. And yes, your English skills have regressed tremendously.   Times Article quote:   This is not an average breakfast for the 58-year-old lawyer turned politician running to become Taiwan’s next President - most days she grabs a coffee and books it to the car. But it is, in many ways, oh so Tsai. The Taipei-raised, U.S.- and U.K.-educated former negotiator wrote her doctoral thesis on international trade law. As a minister, party chair and presidential candidate (she narrowly lost to two-term incumbent Ma Ying-jeou in the 2012 race), Tsai gained a reputation for being wonky - the type who likes to debate protectionism over early-morning sips of black coffee or oolong tea."

taiwan,3det9c,jamiepitts,4,Wed Jul 15 18:37:38 2015 UTC,"Taiwan is a tiny island with a huge mountain range cutting through the center. There are two main reasons for a buyer when buying their property. Personal house, investment property. The problem starts when a person who is buying a personal house starts asking about investment value of that personal house. Basically every real estate property here is valued for investment property. Each transaction around the area bumps up the market value. Tiny amount of land, same high transaction rate, its quite easy to figure why the housing price is so high in Taiwan. If you or your friends are looking to buy a property, do it before the end of this year (best at December but start looking out for it now. Next year would be quite chaotic due to the new real estate transaction tax and the fact that Chinese will be allowed to purchase 10% of the total lot. If you din't know, Chinese can't own properties in China, they can only rent (70 years). The only thing Taiwan has to offer that they will be interested in real estate / land."

taiwan,3det9c,pork_orc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:38:44 2015 UTC,"Cheap rent, good health care, and an overall low cost of living will go a long way to prevent revolt. Maybe I'm just jaded by how bad these simple things can be elsewhere, and it's by no means a perfect situation, but I genuinely feel that most Taiwanese don't understand how good they actually have it.   Granted that's not a reason to not want to fix what's wrong or strive for more, but I don't think Taiwanese people (at least anyone under 25-30 ish) have actually faced enough ""struggle"" to genuinely revolt. At least not in the traditional sense of the word.  Note that I don't own anything here in Taiwan or have a cushy job and I do plan to live here for the long term short of unforeseeable changes, so I'm not coming from a place of ""fuck you I got mine"", just sharing my personal thoughts on it all.   As an American, I can say first hand, a real estate market crash or even just sinking property values isn't in favor for anyone but the wealthy. Poor people still can't buy houses, but suddenly the middle class with houses but low disposable income are fucked, which slows the economy (the middle class are always the biggest supporters of local economies), and in the end the wealthy will just absorb more property during a recession anyway because it's a small island - even if prices go down temporarily, the land itself can't ever truly lose value unless something drastically shifts in Taiwan that makes nobody ever want to live here."
taiwan,3det9c,Tyr808,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:51:45 2015 UTC,"Why would it be a high risk investment if there is no war to reset land ownership. Also since Taiwan is so tiny, its best to compare real estate with other tiny countries."

I also don't have a problem with renting if I can't afford to buy. There are so many options available. I can understand why Hong Kong people would be in a predicament because they have nowhere else to go other than cross the border into Shenzhen. But Taiwan? You have so many options."

taiwan,3det9c,mprey,2,Thu Jul 16 08:26:13 2015 UTC,I totally agree with living outside of hot zones because of the transportation. There is another mentality thats hurting Taiwanese which is that they can only find a job in Taipei.

taiwan,3dcb6c,just_face,14,Wed Jul 15 05:12:00 2015 UTC,PPP has been strongly in favor for Taiwan so GDP (PPP) per capita always ranks Taiwan high. It may be more precisely to say life quality instead of rich I guess.

taiwan,3dcb6c,Gain007004,3,Wed Jul 15 15:35:09 2015 UTC,In what sense is PPP bullshit?  Is there a better way to adjust for the obvious differences in cost of living between different countries?
taiwan,3dcb6c,qlube,2,Thu Jul 16 17:26:43 2015 UTC,"PPP isn't bullshit at all, it directly represents what you can buy with your income. Now I won't argue at all that Taiwanese workers are barely better off than slaves in many aspects, but the cost of living here (and living well) is very very low comparatively. I'd say the costs of living vs wages is indeed better than many areas, hence Taiwan ranking 17th.   The only way this will feel broken is when you want or need anything imported, or especially if you were trying to save money to travel or move elsewhere. The latter is a really fucked up situation because you'll be saving for so much longer because say if your goal was to move to the west coast US, suddenly everything is 2-3 times more expensive and instead of saving a year or two of wages you're going to have to save 4-6 years wages, and that is completely fucked.   Work laws and mentality (but also ethics) absolutely need an overhaul in Taiwan, no arguing that."

This reminds of the days when I'm still a kid, and mom would give me NT50 to buy whatever I want in one of these traditional day markets, while she buys the necessary groceries. I almost always spend them on stinky tofu and sugar cane juice :D. Modern life means people cook less often (contributing to the proliferation of night markets in a sense), and buy from supermarkets a lot more. This post really reminds me how many years have I not set foot in a traditional day market.  This is the market I visited most often. While it's common in Taiwan to have a temple as the centerpiece of day/night markets, this one is under a giant temple. Always intrigued me as a child to see a place of worship directly above a bustling commercial installation."

I'm really bad It, but copy and paste it on google). You can eat plenty of food there, play some games.   2) Nightmarkets. My favorite one is Shilin (士林), eat some traditional food there (Stinky tofu, those bigass fried chicken steak, snowflake ice, oyster pancake [sounds nasty, but it's good], some boba tea). But be careful... If you choose the wrong store, you might run into some stomach problem (had it before, not pleasant)  3) 永康街 (Yongkang street). There's a really good snowflake ice store there, line is usually REALLY long (worth the wait because of the weather 8)). Accessible from metro at 東門 (dongmr not station).  It really depends what your interests are, but feel free to reply and I'll think of some place nice. Right now I'm just thinking of places accessible by MRT (should be your main ways to travel in TAipei, hella cheap)"

(I'm not doubting you, I just can't wrap my mind around this.)  OP, 永康街 (Yongkang Street) is a good suggestion, I always enjoyed going to a very small, easy to overlook restaurant called 大隱酒食, the English name is James' Kitchen I think. A little pricey (and no English menus AFAIK), but worth it. Also at the end of Yongkang Street is the original location of DinTaiFung (鼎泰豐), near the Dongmen (東門) station. DinTaiFeng is a Taiwan institution (with locations around the world), and while people who live here debate whether it's worth the price and/or is the best Xiao Long Bao (小籠包) you can get, as someone visiting for just two days, you should go.  Lastly, another recommended night market is Raohe (饒河), which is now easily accessible on the Song Shan MRT line."

When I envision the night market in my mind, I picture the scene you see as you exit the 劍潭 station: a ""V"" formed by Wenlin Road (文林路) and Jihe Road (基河路): numerous vendors on both roads (actually, on both roads, the vendors are mostly on just one side), and the ""bulk"" of the market is in the space behind the apex formed by these roads, with DaDong Road (大東路) being one entry way into the heart of the market. The underground 美食區 is located closer to Jihe Road. Although I haven't been to Shilin in ~6-8 months, I recall many dozens of above ground food vendors and countless shops selling the typical night market wares. Since my first visit in mid-2012, I've always remembered Shilin to be quite crowded, a ""meat grinder"" of a night market, so to speak, and I don't recall it changing that much since my first visit. That said, I usually only go ~2x/year. I think my source of confusion is  simply due to the fact that my memory doesn't go back far enough; i.e, I don't know what Shilin was like before many food vendors were forced to move underground (I found articles as early as ~2011 referencing the move, which was before my first visit to the market).  In any case, I'm overdue for a visit and will go this weekend to see how things are now."
taiwan,3de958,foggysf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:59:59 2015 UTC,"The whole thing used to be above ground but now the ""official"" Shilin market is now in a complex underground. There are shops surround the areas but that's not part of Shilin rented out by the gov. I think they are building a park(?) at the original location of the night market. It's been underground a couple of years now. Having it underground caused bad ventilation and IMHO a fire hazard."

Also, figuring out destinations and buying tokens every time is a pain in the ass.  You get a partial refund of the 100NT cost if you turn in the card before you leave.

taiwan,3dcigp,deelo23,2,Wed Jul 15 08:11:29 2015 UTC,"Just a small correction: If you are taking the MRT, you're going to be taking it to Tamsui; street signs also use this form of Taiwanese romanization. I don't know about buses, but they may vary spelling between Tamsui and Danshui."
taiwan,3dcigp,Get9,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:27:55 2015 UTC,"These are all good suggestions. I would add:   Jiufen: go further up the mountain to the Jinguashi (金瓜石) gold mine and museum, then finish the rest of your day in Jiufen. Danshui:  ""across from Danshui is a little town that has a museum about ancient Taiwanese culture"" Are talking about taking the ferry across the river to Bali (八里)? I suggest renting a bike on the Bali side of the river, which you can ride to the museum. There is a public bike rental station operated by the New Taipei City government. The rates are competitive with the private bike rental shops unless you are renting over ~2-3 hours, in which case the flat rate offered by the private shops is usually better. Danshui (part 2): it's worth walking up the hill to see the fort/customs house, and the little White House. There's also a restaurant/cafe up the hill that offers nice views (I forgot the name; it's the large red brick building). Generally I've never found the street food in Danshui to be that great, but I prefer it over what you will find on the other side of the river in Bali. Wulai: if going to the hot springs along the river, follow this basic hot spring etiquette: rinse your body with water from the hot spring before you enter it. (Some of the old people are really particular about not ""mixing"" the waters between each hot spring). Also, take the little log train from Wulai up to the waterfall, then walk down.   Some of my own suggestions:   Take the HSR down to Tainan and/or Kending (墾丁). The weather down there will be warmer and sunnier than Taipei. (OP: the weather in Taipei is usually damp and cool in the winter).  Other day trips from Taipei include Yingge (鶯歌) (known for it's pottery, and you can throw pottery at one of the studios there if you want),  Yehliu (野柳) (often crowded with (Chinese) tourists; follow the path that takes you all the way to the overlook at the far end of the park) and Cihu (慈湖) (there are a series of attractions on the way to Cihu, you can buy a single bus ticket ($100) to see them all; going to Cihui will take an entire day and evening). Between Yehliu, Yingge, and Cihu, I recommend Yehliu first and Cihu second. Taipei museums: you'd be remiss not to visit the National Palace Museum (and yes, it'll be crowded with (Chinese) tourists). The Taipei MoCA is actually pretty good too. Taipei night markets: go to Shi Lin (士林) just for the experience (everyone should go at least once), and Rao He (饒河) (most people will recommend the food at Rao He over Shi Lin).   OP, the weather in December in Taipei is not great. If you can, try coming in mid-November (there's still a chance of a typhoon that time of year, but it's less likely)."

Rent one after getting off the MRT and take the ferry, and your bike, over. I've seen people do this all the time.  An aside about the ferry: If you buy a ticket for you and your scooter, you can skip the line no matter how long it is. Two hour line on a really busy Saturday? Scooter gets you to the front."

You can say this about a lot of things that go on right now, but in 40-50 years people will be say ""WHAT THE FUCK WERE THEY THINKING?"".  So many people needlessly die on the roads every year because of those things.  Some people would call me a wuss, I don't give a shit.  I also think Taiwan is beautiful, even in the crazy heat of the summer.  Riding a scooter will probably make it much cooler and much more pleasant.

I've heard that society is more standoffish and insular in general, and that for women it can be especially alienating. Expats seem to spend comparatively more time at the bar because it's not as easy to get in on other social activities. In Taiwan, an effort to learn Chinese and a good attitude can land you good friends. I've heard that this is harder in Korea, but the money is better."
taiwan,3d31d0,Socuta,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:42:30 2015 UTC,"One thing I've picked up about Chinese culture, is how important identity is in who you make friends and associate with. Very, ""They are them, and we are us,"" type thinking. A person from Taipei is ""out of place"" in Kaohsiung and vice versa, and even they might feel alienated. I've even heard Sichuanese consider Cantonese to be ""foreigners"". Friendships are based on shared identities. You're friends ""because you're in the same class"" or ""From the same place."" It's not that Chinese are alienating, but friendships are based on identity, and foreigners don't share any identity.  So as far as this goes, definitely things such as learning Chinese helps to bridge the gap between ""us"" and ""them,"" and opens up a lot of opportunities to make friends."
taiwan,3d31d0,BrainDeadUnit,11,Tue Jul 14 02:37:54 2015 UTC,"Never spent time in South Korea, but here's my anecdotal evidence that Taiwan is better:  Three friends (separately) did stints in Korea for no more than a year before coming to Taiwan. Of those three, only one has gone back home. The other two have done some serious 落地生根ing here. Their huge beef with Korea was its insularity. Taiwan can be an alienating country for us foreigners at times, so I can only imagine how hugely alienating Korea is.  Also, girls here (that haven't gone under the knife) are without a doubt overall more attractive."
taiwan,3d31d0,Panseared_Tuna,4,Mon Jul 13 06:04:58 2015 UTC,I think this is key. From what expat tells me you'll never feel at home in South Korea. Taiwan at least is somewhat more accepting of foreigners.

taiwan,3d31d0,Minahhhh,4,Tue Jul 14 02:16:27 2015 UTC,"Korea has a very bad reputation in the expat blogging world. Google around and you'll find heaps of awful stuff written about the experience of living, working, and particularly dating there. This is a particularly involved example of the genre. If you're feeling brave you can also try Expat Hell (trigger warning: not exactly the most politically correct blog ever written).  Personally I spent a week in Seoul on a long layover and absolutely loved it. But when you're clueless about social cues and don't know the language it's easy to have a positive experience almost by accident. You can do the same thing in Taiwan, too, for nobody's going to get all up in your face about anything (though for sure they'll snap photos or mutter imprecations in Chinese or Taiwanese if you're doing something daft in public or dating someone local). There's plenty of goofy anti-foreigner type news on the telly but it's easily ignored. Essentially you have the choice whether to get worked up about being a tiny minority in a mostly homogeneous society or not. I suppose in Korea that choice may be taken from you, but that's just a guess really.  And yeah, read the previous discussions on this topic. There's been some good perspective shared here.  P.S. I'd absolutely go live in Korea some day."

Every jibe a foreigner has ever come up with about bosses or adjummas/adjossis or girl troubles or how kids in hogwons act up or social pressure or literally ANYTHING has been made by a Korean in the same situation before. Not that it makes shitty things that happen less shitty but realizing that everyone has their own problems (and often the same problems) might make foreigners here feel a little less singled out."

But then again, I've invested a lot of time in the language and the place, so leaving would almost feel like a bit of a defeat for me.  Since a lot of Koreans bitch about Korea too, it kinda makes me feel like improving my own situation (better job, better language skills, go to the gym more, generally get my shit together more) might make me feel differently just as much as a new country would. Sure Korea's a bit of a challenge, but as the saying goes wherever you go, there you are. I posted this more out of idle curiosity rather than a serious desire or plan to move there; I've been to Taiwan before and know what it's like, I just wondered what teachers from here thought of the move.  Your comment about the whole ""my situation"" meme is ridiculous. No, I'm not going to censor myself out of fear of pissing people at Gasengi or Gesomoon off.

Many people here do cycle, and cycling is especially popular among the student population.  However, one thing to bear in mind is that the cycling conditions here can be very dangerous. While the quality of the roads in Tainan is pretty good, the average driving standard is poor.  As a cyclist in Tainan, it is wise to assume that the majority of road users here are not familiar with the concepts of ""right of way"" or ""keeping a safe distance"". You might have to contend with:   motorists trying to pass you at high speeds without leaving a suitable gap motorcyclists attempting to overtake you on your right hand side people opening car doors in your path motorcyclists / scooters shooting out from side roads without looking people generally trying to ""get ahead of you"" and cutting you up motorists running red lights with reckless abandon   These are regular occurrences in Tainan. You can expect that the police will do nothing / very little to enforce the traffic laws.  Don't let this put you off Tainan (it's a really interesting city, with some wonderful people), but please take care on the roads.

taiwan,3d2aoe,Orangetinyfeet,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:42:31 2015 UTC,Thank you.  Is it walking distance from either place?  Or will I need to take taxi or bus or train to get there?
taiwan,3d2aoe,deelo23,2,Mon Jul 13 02:47:19 2015 UTC,"Around Sun Moon Lake be sure to visit Wenwu Temple (文武廟) , De Hua Village (德化社), Shui Village (水社). These three are the most visited place there in my opinion. Also try out their deer meat if you like, and roasted pork sausages.   You can take a ferry ride circling the lake at either De Hua Village's Itashao Wharf (伊達邵碼頭) or Shui Village's Wharf (水社碼頭). A full trip should cost no more than 300NT and should be around an hour ride.  You can also go to Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village 九族文化村 nearby, either take the gondola (覽車) or take a taxi.   中台禪寺 is actually not that far from Sun Moon Lake, around 25km or so, but considering you don't have your own transportation, taking a bus can be painfully long. You need to take a bus to Puli district's bus station (埔里轉運站), and from there it's a 1km walk to 中台禪寺 or you can take a cab instead.   If you have the time, go with BioDerm's suggestion and rent a scooter.   Haven't been to Qing Jing so can't help you with that, sorry. Hope this helps a bit! Have a nice trip!"

They aren't super expensive unless you want to try and be stuntin with bottles and standing on couches like P Diddy. Entry fee isn't crazy and a bottle of beer is the same as Revolver or Corner Office.   Also, I may have been the Tim you've seen in the past owning that dancefloor!!! Cargo short swag on fleek."

taiwan,3d3z33,kzilla88,24,Mon Jul 13 09:44:20 2015 UTC,"I married Taiwanese. She also thinks my friend's girlfriends are not that attractive. Because of the different beauty standards, foreigners usually (my personal experience for Kaohsiung) go for the darker skinned, more athletic Taiwanese girl. The girl who enjoys the beach, biking, hiking, and the like. Even though I've gotten my wife to spend more time outside and not worry about her skin getting dark, it's hard to go against a lifetime of training.    It would be equally difficult for me to see a super-white girl, with big eyes, a small mouth, and no muscle-tone whatsoever as attractive. I just can't see myself holding a little dog in its little dog purse while she shops. It just wouldn't happen.     So yeah, according to the Taiwanese, the foreigners are scooping up the darker, uglier girls. According to the foreigners, we're picking up girls way hotter than what we would get at home. It only matters if you care what other people think."
taiwan,3d3z33,Jabarumba,8,Mon Jul 13 13:16:10 2015 UTC,"This is the answer. When I lived in Thailand (and spoke fluent Thai), locals would always ask me the questions they couldn't ask foreigners who didn't speak decent Thai, which at the time was just about all of them. The number one question? ""Why do foreigners like dark / short / ugly women?""  My answer was basically yours -- the skin color of the upper-middle class (tan vs. lily white) makes the difference.  To the people who are saying that foreigners mostly end up with hot women, I'll say ""They're hot to you, but likely not to their friends and family."" My girl of thirteen years has almost constantly gotten shit about her looks by her countrymen, family, Taiwanese, or whatever Asians we meet, while at the same time she used to get (back when we lifestyled) get ""hotness awards"" at parties we used to frequent. It's just a matter of different cultural expectations of beauty."
taiwan,3d3z33,bodangren2,3,Mon Jul 13 13:50:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with you wholeheartedly, this is indeed one of the key factors in the difference in terms of the look that Taiwanese wives of foreigners have in comparison to the typical standard of the pinnacle of Taiwanese beauty."

taiwan,3d3z33,st0815,10,Tue Jul 14 04:37:11 2015 UTC,"It's kinda bizarre. If a hot girl dates a foreigner, then there are complaints how all the girls want to be with foreigners. If an average girl dates a foreigner, then there are complaints like ""why did he go for her, she is not so beautiful"" ...  It would stand to reason that not all foreigners in Taiwan are equally attractive, so presumably there should be a different range of dating options depending on that.   I suspect it's just a lot of average people dating other average people with the odd exception here and there, and confirmation bias sorting them neatly into the desired categories."

taiwan,3cz182,talesfromthecryptt,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:46:48 2015 UTC,"Hi Sorry for the late reply, that's not how it works. If you are on conscription age, since you're post 1984, you can stay in the country for 183 days per calendar year. When you exit the country, you will need to get an extra stamp (役男出境) at the immigration booth at the airport (takes like 5 mins to get it). This will be stamped over at immigration and you'll be able to leave.   When you enter with your US passport, whilst it is technically a different person, the Taiwan customs don't register it as a different person, but if they investigated, the law states that no matter which passport you enter with, it all counts towards the 183 days per calendar year. But i normally just state, i'm here for shopping and plan on claiming VAT, never had a problem using this excuse."

taiwan,3cwh0b,wkwrd,12,Sat Jul 11 10:43:16 2015 UTC,"So I asked my grandma what she remembers of the end of the Sino-Japanese war, and what the general Taiwanese populace felt when the news broke out.  She said that Taiwan is firmly by Japan's side by WWII, and when Japan surrendered, it was a feeling or horror and dismay. They knew this meant that Taiwan would likely be returned to China, and no one she remembers welcomed that thought. While not flourishing as in the years just before the war, Taiwan was largely spared WWII compared to all the surrounding countries. Even though still colonial in nature, Japanese rule was shifting towards integration of Taiwan instead of treating it as a colony. So both economically and politically, Taiwanese at the time see no reason life would become any better returning to China.  And it got much worse than they thought. The interim government between Japan's surrender and the ROC government seating in Taiwan cared very little for the livelihood of Taiwanese people, and there was a runaway inflation and food shortage while KMT used Taiwan to supply the Civil War in China. Taiwanese people were even worst off than the closing years of WWII. These and political matters would eventually lead to the 228 incident.  So no, she sees no reason at all to celebrate the ""victory"" of the Sino-Japanese war, as Taiwan was on the ""losing"" side. And the ""victors"" now celebrating are very hated by the Taiwanese of the era."

I had one that was crapping out intermittently, and the reason was a spiderweb in the pipe where the gas comes out.

While technically you have to have been undergoing treatment for over 6 months, and if your motor capabilities are not affected and there are no sequlae, you still have to serve, HIV is something nobody wants to gamble on (especially government workers) and military training is a high-risk environment for communicable diseases. So without exception HIV positive means you are exempt.  Now be extremely careful with how you apply for it. There have been numerous cases of HIV positive exemption documentation getting delivered in ways that basically made everyone know about it. So you must be very specific that you want to pick up all documentation yourself, not sent via post or any other means.  A good way to make sure is to inquire with relevant NGOs such as these:     http://www.praatw.org/index.asp http://www.lourdes.org.tw/list_1.asp?id=161&menu1=4&menu2=23#   Some additional info to convince you to be extra careful:   http://www.praatw.org/right_2_cont.asp?id=372 http://www.praatw.org/right_2_cont.asp?id=165"

HOWEVER, there are conditions where you can are HIV positive and may end up doing conscription or 替代役. The terms state that if you have been treated for longer than 6 months with no signs of improvement, you may be exempt. This is something you'd need to call conscription department to enquire about. They would be able to tell you exactly what the terms are and what paper works/examination you'll need.   As for taking the exam in another location, the results are sent to your registered address, if your parents open your mail then your efforts will be voided.

taiwan,3cxugj,bertfivesix,4,Sun Jul 12 03:36:30 2015 UTC,"Haha, just messing around here.  Though most of your questions have been answered many times here, and tend to elicit these kinds of responses.  To answer one of them, if you're coming from the US, you can go in visa-exempt, obtain your work permit from your employer, then go to the immigration office to get a work visa.  If they're even close to a reputable company, they'll be well practiced at getting you through that process.  You can try to get all the documentation from your employer beforehand and visit your nearest TECO office stateside to get a work visa, but that's an unnecessary hassle.  As for cultural nuances, Taiwan is pretty fuckin' laid back about that.  You're not going to get into fistfights over using the wrong honorific unless you're also a loud/rude/obnoxious person, and the vast majority of people are friendly and helpful towards foreigners.  Mainly just practice good subway manners.  I think the best part of the experience is learning as you go, whether it's from more experienced expats, local friends, language exchange partners, night market vendors, etc.  But if you really want to get a head start (it would help if you had some kind of basic Mandarin skills), there are plenty of articles on Taiwanese etiquette floating around out there, and in here.  Get the Pleco app and download the Traditional keyboard for your phone, and be a sponge."

taiwan,3cxugj,Tyberos,3,Sun Jul 12 03:33:27 2015 UTC,"Ok.  Your school should have arranged the residence permit and work visa for you before you arrive.  If not, you may need to fly out of the country again in order to reenter on the valid visa.  The laws may have changed, but when I first came here it didn't matter whether one had a tourist visa or just used a landing visa, you still had to fly out and back for the work visa and residence permit to take effect.  Perhaps someone else will have an answer.  In terms of weird Ken-sama levels of cultural quirk appreciation, I haven't noticed any that are critical to success, other than of course being able to navigate the office backstabbing which the Taiwanese can take to a high art form in some companies.  As others have mentioned, your employer will tell you which bank to use and will probably have to go with you to set it up, because the bank employees will be useless if they have to try to communicate with you in English -- not because they are incapable of it, but rather because they'll be so panicked about it that they will refuse to.  Actually, that's a cultural quirk that you'll get used to, Taiwanese being so freaked out by the foreigner that they won't even take a fast-food order from you when you are pointing at a menu card to show them which item you want."

No, you don't need a work ARC, but you need a visa before entering Taiwan. Whether it's a visitor's visa (technically visa fraud) or a resident visa (you'll need a work permit for this) doesn't matter. You can't apply for the ARC in Taiwan without a visa."
taiwan,3cxugj,just_face,3,Sun Jul 12 13:41:44 2015 UTC,"Already lots of info but I want to add my two cents.  Clothing:  Do not be fooled by the subtropical climate. In winter temperatures can drop as low as 46 degrees Fahrenheit, may not sound too bad, but as there literally is no heating that temp is around 24/7 for a few weeks. If you don't want to buy stuff here bring it along.  If you and/or your GF have large feet (by US standards) bring shoes, it can be hard to find larger sizes here. Same applies to bras if your GF is (for lack of better terms) well endowed. Also consider most bras here are padded which does not help with summer heat. Cultural thing: Taiwanese women do not show cleavage or side boob, short shorthorts on the OTH are no problem. Swimwear is usually boxer shorts (men) and one piece swimsuit or tankini (female), though bikinis are becoming more and more common (expect same stares). Bathing caps are obligatory, even if you are bald.  Transportation:  If you go to Taipei get an Easycard, info here: https://www.easycard.com.tw/english/easycard/index.asp  If you go elsewhere and its a larger city like Taichung or Kaohsiung still get one but also bring an international driving permit; you most likely want to get a scooter to get around. You might also want to get a Taiwanese driver license. More info here: http://acs.ait.org.tw/driving.html  and here: http://www.tealit.com/article_categories.php?section=transportation&article=drivers_license  The links to the practice tests are not working, try this one: https://www.mvdis.gov.tw/m3-simulator-drv/index.zul  Note:  There will be some chinese but, its fairly self explanatory. Ignore the scary warning about fraudulent practices (item 4), the simulation is a bit too real...  True = circle, false = x on true/false questions, after answering the last question click on the indicated button on the right bottom corner and follow the instructions. The questions you answered wrong will be displayed (for a certain time, I did not wait for the timer to time out, so try yourself....)  NOTE: Testing is available in english in (at least) the Taichung DMV as well. After getting the license forget all rules and keep your head on a constant swivel while driving. Scary in the beginning, but you will get used to it. Also no right turn on red traffic lights!  Important!  Do not DUI! Even if the chances are low at getting caught (road checks usually only on weekends and public holidays at known locations), unless you are involved in an accident (mandatory alcohol breathalyser test), if you get caught that's at least 60,000 NTD and possible jail time if you exceed what amounts to one 0.3 liter (less than a pint) can of beer. Even if you are a sober passenger in a car with a drunk driver you can be fined 30,000 NTD. On top of that it probably will get you kicked out of your job, rendering your work visa invalid and subsequently getting you kicked out of the country for visa violation. NOT GOOD. All of that for just exceeding the legal limit, much worse in case of an accident or anyone injured or killed, no matter of actual guilt on your party.

The brown line of the MRT doesn't go directly to NCCU. You need to either transfer by bus or walk from the Taipei Zoo Station.

Wind had not been an issue since at least the 90s, and now the danger lies mostly with rain, or more specifically, flooding and mud slides associated with rain.   However, whether or not there's a typhoon break still lies mostly with the wind factor, though in recent years rain has sparsely been taken into account. The primary reason really is the danger of riding scooters in the strong wind, as well as organizing students to arrive at and return from school in typhoon conditions, rather than anticipating any specific issue one might encounter at home.   When a typhoon comes, it is mostly just a cool and comfortable day off for most of Taiwan now, unless you happened to live in the mountains, or somewhere easily flooded."

Now, I would suggest to do your research not only on the buildings' in regards to the walls first and tenants second. Tenants come and go so even if you have someone who doesn't mind hearing your music, it's a coin toss when a new tenant moves in. Also keep in mind of the flooring/ceiling too vs just the walls. My aunt lives in a building where her neighbors upstairs (yes upstairs) sing KTV and the muffled sound would still seep through to my aunt's apartment. In terms of neighborhoods different districts will have different demographic, but I feel that's too broad of a factor to make any decision in your case. Good luck!"

taiwan,3cqzmg,laopi,6,Fri Jul 10 01:58:31 2015 UTC,"I've found the system to be phenomenal. Unfortunately, it's also completely unsustainable. It's severely underfunded, overused and likely to collapse under the weight of an aging population.  The biggest advantage so far has been the ability to 'shop around' without breaking the bank. I've been injured a few times (sports, accidents) and have almost always had to see four or five different doctors before I found one that was able to properly assess and treat the problem. If I had been in America I expect the situation would have been similar, but the cost of doing so would likely have crushed my bank account.  I think the US could learn a lot from the Taiwanese system, but I also have a great deal of pity for the non-doctors (i.e. nursing staff) here. The pay is abysmal compared to the US and the working hours (while similar) can be draining due the much higher patient load at most facilities. However, the biggest difference (I have family in medical care back home) has been the respect given to medical staff here and the general promptness of service.  When I went to visit family at the hospital back home, you had a bag search and an x-ray just to get into the building. Not even a year ago there was a drive-by shooting at the hospital. I know this isn't necessarily true for all medical facilities in the States and there have been incidences of violence here too, but I think the frequency here is much lower."

taiwan,3cqzmg,pork_orc,0,Fri Jul 10 18:40:12 2015 UTC,This. Every appointment with the doctor only lasts for 5-10 minutes and patients ended up seeing multiple doctors because they don't feel satisfied with the short appointment. The program is also extremely underfunded. The doctors are taught to prescribe medications for everything to get the maximum reimbursement from the national health insurance reimbursed hospitals.  What I think is totally fucked up- Doctors have to work SIX days a week to get the most reimbursement for the hospitals even if they see/treat the exact same number of patients and work the same number of hours but in 5 days.

Wait times were minimal etc.  However, I had various health issues over the years that required me to get check ups bi-weekly and I saw various doctors.  The overall treatment was inconsistent and of overall poor quality.  Medicines where over-prescribed and there was a sense of the doctor just wanting you out so he could see the next patient and when you came back a couple weeks later...it was like seeing them for the first time again.  They seemed to make their judgement in haste and stuck with it.  There is no sense of doctor patient relationship.  Back in the US (with decent health coverage from work) and things are just simply better (Overall health is better just from the environment).  However I can't speak for someone right now without insurance or someone who is seriously ill in the US...that can of course be a huge problem.    I'd like to see something in between.

Is it also normal to have overworked and shitpayed medical workers? Or is that also the case in France?  People always think of European/French healthcare are so perfect, but I read an article sometimes ago which doesn't paint the same rosy picture.   I have a friend who is an MD in France. She says that four days each week she is a “government doctor” and rushes patients through as fast as possible because she earns so little with the country’s socialized medicine policy. One day each week she has a private practice and she earns more in her private practice in the one day than she does in four days in the government program. Consequently, the patients she sees in the private practice get as much attention as needed and receive much better care. She says she would love to be able to practice the way doctors in America do but she will not leave her native France.   and   Bottom line is that there IS no free healthcare in Europe. People there pay for it, and quite dearly as their economies collapse."

One bad illness could bankrupt me. But ... if I'm covered, even with an HMO, I have decent confidence that I will be properly diagnosed and treated before I lose all my money. I'm not terrified of getting sick here, but I am afraid of not being properly treated.  My gal recently went in because she had a migraine for a week and constantly felt nauseous. The doctor gave her anti-nausea medicine and sent her home. No attempt to find the cause at all.  A couple of years ago, I was in the hospital for several days after I went to the doctor because of a migraine. I mentioned that it caused me to vomit and that I noticed some blood. That blood was all they worried about until the moment i was released. Scopes tests, everything. I appreciate they were concerned about the blood, but it was a single time in a week of vomiting and it never recurred, No doctor ever listened to any of my other symptoms, including my inability to open my eyes and look at anyone for my entire stay. Sure, the stay was cheap, but it did nothing for me at all.  If I've got the flu, Taiwan is a great place to be. Something obscure? FML."
taiwan,3cqzmg,zjnetil,0,Fri Jul 10 06:30:05 2015 UTC,"I agree. Let me share my story, too.  When I was in boot camp, I caught the cold (half our platoon caught it by the end of training). By the time I arrived at my unit, I could not stay silent for more than 1 minute without coughing. I went to a nearby clinic on my days off and were prescribed the usual stuff to fight cold. It didn't help. I went to doctors every week when I got days off and it never worked. A month later, I was still coughing. It got so bad that I could not speak three words before I cough. Then one day I woke up with a 39 degrees fever.  I was taken to the Tri-service hospital (the biggest and best military hospital in Taiwan) because we were stationed near it, and ER sent me to get an x-ray of my chest. Afterwards they decided it was common cold and sent me back with the usual meds.  The next morning I took my temperature under orders and was again 39 degrees. So again I was whisked off to Tri-service because that's standard procedure. A different ER doctor called up the X-ray they took the previous day to make sure, and I was sent back with an order to rest. Common cold. Nothing to worry about.  Then the next morning I was again at 39 degrees. This time one sergeant suggested that we go to regular outpatient instead of the ER. We got an old army doctor who also called up that X-ray shot, but he took 3 seconds to look at my X-ray and said, ""you've got pneumonia, didn't the ER doctors tell you?"" ""Um, no?"" ""Get your sergeant to pick up your personal stuff, you're hospitalized as of now. That's an order.""  I was hospitalized for a week. My white blood cell count was at dangerous levels, getting me into isolation for like two days. The ER doctors who failed to find pneumonia in my X-ray were interns..."

taiwan,3cq5ay,some_uw_student,8,Thu Jul 9 21:49:50 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Blame Sun Yat-sen.  Sun Yat-sen was inspired by the tradition of imperial examinations in China, as well as the tradition of government officials whose sole job is to snitch on other officials, so he decided that those should totally be branches of the government as well! The Control Yuan will be in charge of monitoring government ethics and performance, and the Examination Yuan will be in charge of selecting and hiring the civil service, as well as paying out their retirement benefits.  If I remember my high school classes correctly, Sun never envisioned direct elections of any kind for the central government--he wanted an elected National Assembly to appoint the central government leaders (including the president). When they finally got around to writing the constitution in 1946, though, I think they realized this is not very tenable. So the original constitution made Control Yuan members indirectly elected by provincial legislatures (similar to how US senators  were elected prior to the 20th century). Examination Yuan members were always appointed by the president with legislative approval.  Of course, pretty soon all central government elections were suspended due to the civil war and martial law. Before they started up again in the 1990s, there was a constitutional amendment that made the Control Yuan appointed by the president. So i don't think there have ever been Control Yuan elections in Taiwan.  My opinion is that the Control Yuan is completely useless, because it's unclear what legal force their decisions have. Basically every single government entity can just ignore whatever orders from the Control Yuan that they don't like. The Examination Yuan does useful stuff but there's no reason for it to be an entirely separate branch of government--it should just be part of the civil service.  Also worth noting that Control Yuan positions went unfilled during most of Chen Shui-bian's second term due to legislative gridlock. I don't think anyone actually noticed."
taiwan,3cq5ay,pipedreamer220,2,Fri Jul 10 06:49:41 2015 UTC,"In my opinion,Control Yuan also decreases the power of Legislator and Court. Without it, Legislator can have more power to regulate government officials and relay the comments from citizen. But now, Legislator can only threaten goveriment by cutting budget. And there are no other ways to accuse them when they do something wrong. If they don't afraid of Legislator, then there are no other way to stop goveriment."
taiwan,3cq5ay,justinCandy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:00:57 2015 UTC,"so if Legislator and the court has limit power to stop government and leave to control yuan. How can it let things like the Chen Shui-bian corruption and the close door deal with China get by?Also since control yuan is appoint by the President, make it bipartisan and undemocratic entity. is it better get  abolish the control yuan opposite party more power to stand against unfavorable behavior of the main party? And saving money and reduce the bureaucracy."
taiwan,3cq5ay,justinCandy,3,Fri Jul 10 15:31:07 2015 UTC,"as /u/PotbellyPanda says, the problem is that Control Yuan don't have enough power. Their judgment of impeachment and reprimand* has no much co-acting force. Many government institution still ignore their judgment. And if they want to punish government officer, They can't do it directly. The final decision is made by 公務人員懲戒委員會 under Judicial Yuan, which is usually a lenient sentence then we expected.  He says about ""Controllers are not responsible to anyone"" is also correct,  That's why their investigation takes a long time. No one can actually supervise them. So if they don't work, We can't do anything.  *I don't know the exact word in English, the Chinese word of them is '彈劾', '糾正'."
taiwan,3cq5ay,justinCandy,2,Sat Jul 11 00:10:18 2015 UTC,wait you mean Control Yuan is no better than decoration?  why is nobody try to abolish the part of government that is have no important fuction? this remind me of my current country's senate fiasco. these lazy Senator never does their work yet spend millions of my tax dollar.

taiwan,3cq5ay,JillyPolla,2,Sat Jul 11 05:45:07 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that it is somewhat useless. But the problem to restructure them might be:   Taiwan (or ROC) is highly respect Dr. Sun Yat-sen, our education usually elaborate the contribution of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. So it is hard to convince us that his idea is wrong. To pass the amendment of constitution, we need at least 3/4 Legislators to agree. Then running a referendum, we need over a helf of citizen vote agree(All citizen, not just those to vote on that day). so it is almost impossible to pass amendment."

taiwan,3cq5ay,PotbellyPanda,2,Sat Jul 11 05:31:06 2015 UTC,"For Chen's corruption part:   As mentioned, Controllers were unfilled during most of Chen's 2nd term, make impeachment unable to be even investigated. Recalling the President first requires 2/3 vote of the Legislators pass the motion, then there's the recall referendum; once the recall has been vetoed by either phase, it shall not to be initiated again during the same term. There did was a recall motion in 2006, which 1) pan-Green controls over 1/3 seats and 2) it was initiated too early that prosecutors has not yet done all investigations, gave Chen a chance to (and succesfully) persuade his supporters and party members that he's not involved.   For Ma's part:   Although polls show he is quite unpopular (and resulted landslide defeat in local election last year), it seems that Ma still manage to consolidate his power within KMT even he's already not the chairperson. That makes Legislators unable to turn their back on Ma like supporting recall or motion of no confidence to his cabinet. This is quite similar to the situation DPP members faced in 2007: Chen was highly unpopular in median voters, but he was still controlled the party, pushed his radical supporters to call members who criticized Chen ""betrayers"", and resulted landslide defeat in 2008 general election."
taiwan,3cq5ay,JillyPolla,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:25:21 2015 UTC,so I see Taiwan is a classic two party system. hows is this pan green and pan blue still a thing? how are they different ? what are their political spectrum? do you like any of these?  do you think the first past the post system is one of cause of the legislator dead lock for many years.
taiwan,3cq5ay,PotbellyPanda,2,Sat Jul 11 16:53:39 2015 UTC,"Pan-Blue is basically KMT and its derived parties, so the the ideology within the camps is quite similar: conservatism, Chinese-nationalism and reunification-leaning.  Pan-Green is more complicated since DPP itself was formed by a coalition of ""those who against KMT"". Generally we consider its ideology is independence-leaning, Taiwanese-nationalism and central-liberal.  Noticed that the major ideological difference in two camps is the attitude toward Chinese/Taiwanese-nationalism and reunification/independence. Blue camp can be considered conservative, but it's not easy to categorize Green camp into either left or right politics. The latter are more support civil rights and liberal ideas but does not coherent on economical policy.    Voting system:   I think FPTP is part of the reason why it is easily go to a deadlock. My reason is that both KMT and DPP are consist of many different factions of ideas (KMT is a clientelism party, and DPP is still a coalition), but forced to run under a same banner. That makes politics inflexible. However I personally think the (bad) constitutional tradition (and political culture) may be bigger issue. The President doesn't have to sever with his party and in fact often controls and served as party chair, which makes parliament unlike a presidential system but more like Westminster-system; meanwhile, MPs doesn't gain any benefit to backfire the unpopular President (think of Australian Labour). And that also make Premier an awkward position that he is de facto only responsible to the President but have to resign for the President's policy thus become a scapegoat."

Remember there will be lines you have to recite before you throw the grenade and you will need to fake pulling out the pin. Then after you throw remember to throw yourself on the ground and take cover. Have fun =)  Remember grenades are much heavier than a baseball.

I registered at the front desk, waited for half an hour, and was seen by an American-trained, English speaking orthopedic doctor/surgeon. He gave me a 20 minute examination and ordered x-rays. I got the x-rays the same day, returned to the doctor for a review of the results, received a prescription for pain medication and a muscle relaxer, and was referred to physical therapy. The total was less than 2000 TWD. Each physical therapy visit was 300 NT."
taiwan,3co53z,Tyberos,2,Thu Jul 9 22:57:26 2015 UTC,"Cheap, but obviously I couldn't tell you an exact price. I've used docs office before without healthcare and never paid more than ~1000 NT"

taiwan,3co53z,foggysf,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:19:15 2015 UTC,"It likely also depends on where you are at. Taipei will be more expensive for out of pocket. I had a full on check up with X-rays, MRI, blood work, you name it, for ~NT$20k in Chiayi. Can't imagine what you're asking for would be more than $5k.  You maybe want to skip the hospital, which could very well charge a lot more, and instead try a private clinic. Ask around for a recommendation from your Taiwanese friends."

taiwan,3co0dp,daBlackestBerry,2,Thu Jul 9 11:48:24 2015 UTC,It's legit that it's a online store platform. But some of them may be sold by individuals (kind of like Amazon) and the quality can vary. Read the return policy before you buy. At some shops you can get 24 hrs delivery if the purchase is over the certain amount (around $1500NT).   There's also these other ones if you are interested.  http://www.momoshop.com.tw/main/Main.jsp  http://www.pchome.com.tw/

taiwan,3co0dp,justinCandy,3,Thu Jul 9 14:01:15 2015 UTC,"Take care of the ""平輸中文"" or something like ""平行輸入""  when buying a camera at Taiwan. It means this is imported by individual, not the authorized agent.  Although it states ""- 保固期限：1年"", means 1 year warranty. You may need to contact Yahoo in case it has problems. If you ask authorized agent, they may refuse to fix it, or you need to pay more to fix it."
taiwan,3co0dp,foggysf,2,Thu Jul 9 14:07:33 2015 UTC,"It's not sketch. And the link helps. Like what /u/justincandy said, 平輸中文 means it's not sold by the authorized dealer but an individual have bought it or brought it from overseas. Warranty is through Yahoo.   Yahoo's shopping mall divides itself into two parts. It's listed under Yahoo's own 購物中心 (essentially sold by Yahoo) and not Yahoo 超級商城 (individual storefronts) with 24 hrs delivery. What you might want to google up is idk if Nikon D3300+Tamron 18-200mm lens are usually sold as a combo, its possible one of the parts is a newer model and the other one is what they are trying to get rid of. And there's a slight possibility that 平輸中文 means the camera setting is all in Chinese, but if it's Nikon I think there would be a way for you to switch the language to English.  And if you want to return it, you have to make sure that it's in all the original packaging and the seal (if there's one) can't be broken..be very careful when you open it!"
taiwan,3co0dp,foggysf,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:49:27 2015 UTC,So like....if it comes in a box and the box is plastic-wrapped....I can't open the plastic wrap if I want to return it?  Or I just have to make sure the box isn't tampered with?  How will I know the quality of the camera/lens unless I see it!?  Oy vey.  What are the chances that these are knockoffs or grey market products with Nikon and Tamron logos stuck on them?

taiwan,3cmaw6,Poro_Sorceress,7,Thu Jul 9 00:42:23 2015 UTC,"1) You don't schedule it. Instead, you go to whatever hospital does those in Taoyuan. You'll also need an International Certificate of Vaccination if you don't want to get a bunch of vaccinations, again, or be checked for antibodies.  2) Yes. Ask wherever you're working what bank they use and to assist you in setting up the account.  3) First month's rent and another two months' rent as a deposit. Article 99 of the Land Act sets this as law; it's illegal to ask you for more than the two months for deposit.  4) Information on JFRV for foreign spouses of...foreigners.... I don't know anything about foreigner couples coming over together, though.  5) Clothes are fine. What do you mean power cords? You're US stuff works, here. Some people don't like the deodorant selection in Taiwan. Other than that, I'm not sure.  6) Find a store called 臺灣大哥大 (I think it's written 台湾大哥大 on the signs), or, in English, Taiwan Mobile. Tell them you want a phone plan and ask if someone speaks English. They have pamphlets that have the plans on them, though I think they don't have English ones. If you have any Taiwanese friends (or a coworker), they can come with you. You'll have to give them a deposit of some amount, maybe nt$2,000, or have a Taiwanese person sign for you (something about taking responsibility for you if you skip out of the country, which is their reasoning for the deposit).  There are also prepaid cards at 7-11 and Taiwan Mobile and all the other mobile stores. Basically, you pay nt$500 or more and you have prepaid minutes and 3G (4G, too, maybe?).  7) Phrases:   你好嗎？(Nǐ hǎo ma?) - How are you? 你說英文嗎？(Nǐ shuō yīngwén ma?) - Do you speak English? 多少錢？(Duōshǎo qián?) - What is the cost? 廁所在哪裡？(Cèsuǒ zài nǎlǐ?) - Where is the bathroom? 謝謝你！(Xièxiè nǐ!) - Thank you! 不客氣。(Bù kèqì.) - You're welcome. 沒有問題。(Méiyǒu wèntí.) - No problem. 不好意思。(Bùhǎo yìsi) - Excuse me (like, passing someone or bumping into someone lightly) 對不起！ (Duìbùqǐ) -  Sorry!"

taiwan,3cmaw6,Get9,2,Thu Jul 9 14:48:22 2015 UTC,"I think the above Chinese phrases are helpful, but found that when I was first learning Chinese it was harder to get what I needed using bad Chinese than it was using English. Chinese can have a pretty steep learning curve when you're starting out, and it's easy to mispronounce words.   I second the other redditors opinion on having your husband study Chinese like a mofo, but for now you'll be fine enough asking your school for help or trying to get by in English. Most young Taiwanese have studied English in school, so at the very least they understand basic sentences.  Edit: I just want to add that there is a university in Taoyuan that your husband can do a full time Chinese program at. I'm not sure of the name, but I have a friend that teaches there--the classes are 3 hours a day 5 days a week.   Also, are you by chance teaching at Taoyuan American School? If so, my girlfriend works there and probably could help you out once you get there. Feel free to PM me if that happens to be the case. :)"
taiwan,3cmaw6,Roboprobe,2,Thu Jul 9 06:52:27 2015 UTC,"Essentially what is going to happen is that when you land in Taiwan your new company will probably arrange for you to go to one of the area hospitals for a medical exam.  No previous medical records are required, as they are mostly checking that you don't have any infectious diseases and are generally okay to work. I'm sure if you have them on hand, it's worth bringing them, but if not I wouldn't sweat it. You can't setup a bank account in Taiwan unless you register with the Taoyuan Immigration Office.  Usually the procedure is once you have your ARC, resident visa, then you can open a bank account.  If it is truly urgent you can register with them before that, but yet again depends on your needs. Depending on your landlord, you usually have to pay two months rent to act as a deposit as well as your actual first months' rent, so if your apartment is 300 USD a month, expect to put down 900 USD in the beginning.  I'm sure your company can help with discounting this though. Once you officially have your ARC(takes between 1-2 months) you can file for your husband's resident ARC.  He will be unable to work (legally) with this though as its just a resident visa.  You can get a pay as you go SIM card just using your passport, so this isn't really an issue.  If you want official service from any major telecom company, you will need an ARC.  Not as many people are fluent in English in Taoyuan, so it would be in your best interest to learn the basics, like numbers and counting.  Of course in Taiwan, traditional characters are used, so please use a suitable textbook.  There isn't a certain phrase I can tell you to make your stay more convenient.  The question about the things you ""need"" to bring is entirely up to you.  As far as work clothes go, that would be in the regulations of your new company.    I lived in Zhongli for over 4 years, and the most highly recommended thing I would suggest buying would be either a good bicycle or a decent scooter.  Driving in Taoyuan can be scary at times, but the convenience of having one can't be denied."

A lot of places with free wifi (Starbucks, McDonald, MRT, some 7-11,etc) will require a wifi account to use their free wifi. Once you have a sim card and a local number, you would then be able to set that up and use the free wifi at certain locations.

Funding for college athletics, and the overall picture for college tuition, are completely different in Taiwan compared to the US. You're not going to get universities to offer many full-ride scholarships for athletes, and college isn't expensive enough that it will be enticing for parents to encourage their children to pursue sports instead of academics.  Plus the description of gender roles in high school women's basketball teams is years if not decades out of date.

taiwan,3cn1z5,JillyPolla,2,Thu Jul 9 16:29:37 2015 UTC,"I think Taiwanese people in general deserve better support in athletics, regardless of gender.  This country could excel in many sports but there just isn't a great infrastructure there for anyone, boys or girls, to grow into world class athletes.  When I ask my students, ""who plays on a sports team?"" it is very rare to have more than one.  If I ask ""who has EVER played on a sports team"" it is usually the same number. Kids from a young age should be playing organized sports in rec leagues.    Too much damn book learning, these kids need to run around and get their knees scraped up a little bit.  P.S. I am referring to Taipei before anyone jumps down my throat about that.  Maybe kids who live in the country get to participate in sport more? I dunno.  I just find it sad how many of my students LOVE basketball or baseball or soccer but rarely get the chance to be on a team and learn the intricacies of the sport. For BOTH boys and girls.  /rant"

How many of those same players have been on the team at each level through elementary, JH and HS? Maybe 15 out of 3,000 or whatever?  It should start in elementary where kids are all playing multiple sports, just for fun, exercise and to advance skill if they are truly good enough.  I have a student who is apparently amazing at badminton, he is in grade 6 and on the team.  This will get him fast tracked to the junior high team and so on. It seems in Taiwan you are either top level elite and on the team OR you are relegated to playing in the park with your grandma or friends  In basketball, you either play on the team at a high level from very early OR you play terrible no rules 3 on 3 and never learn the rules and skills of the game properly."

I am glad that they exist and they are fun but it isn't a realistic way to get competitive at a sport.    I keep using basketball as an example, but that is the sport I play and have played in Taiwan for a long time.  A lot of  basic knowledge and skills just don't exist that lead to Taiwan being competitive. Admittedly, I am not an expert on the subject but I see a lot of the flaws that exist from a developmental side.  The best player on the Taiwan basketball team was the MVP of the American division 2 NCAA.  That isn't good enough. In a country of 20+ million people, they should be outputting a higher number and skill level of professional athletes. In a country that LOVES baseball, how many players are currently in the MLB? NBA?   I dunno, just some observances I have, maybe I am off base a little but I'd love to see Taiwan start advancing and dominating in sport more, closer to what Japan and Korea are doing."

We typically start training for track and field in September (two months before the actual event). Our sports teams train daily and scrim with each other or rival schools at least once or twice a week.   You're right about the local culture, though, given that the overwhelming majority of my community are ABCs, which means that we were born and bred from a totally different environment, one that has a much stronger athletic tradition.   I think the disproportionate lack of Taiwanese representation in international sports isn't just because of an apathy about sports, it's apathy towards active participation in everything in general. I'm an aspiring writer. A few days ago I was ranting to a fellow ABC about how America and Japan have no shortage of insane scifi / fantasy, which Taiwanese people do consume in the forms of novels, cartoons, movies, and videogames, and yet there is pretty much zero of that being natively produced by the Sinosphere, aside from Three Kingdoms dramas over and over.   Most students here focus largely on academic performance and want to be engineers, doctors, lawyers, politicians, and such. Unfortunately, the youth culture here is still largely too afraid to embrace athleticism and creativity as anything more than isolated, casual hobbies."

Creating isn't really seen as hugely important. My school had a secretary, she was kind of shy so I'd try and chat with her.  My boss told me she is quite well known as a pianist, so we had a chat about it one day, I asked her if she writes her own songs, ""Wh....why would I do that? Of course NOT!"" Errr??? ok???

taiwan,3cevg1,zakazaw,5,Tue Jul 7 10:58:41 2015 UTC,"Taiwan’s precarious balance By Dan Bogler  Superficially, Taiwan looks stable, calm, even a little boring. Its people are mostly prosperous, with gross domestic capital per capita of more than $30,000 — not as high as Singapore or Hong Kong but well ahead of South Korea and most of the rest of Asia. Growth, while no longer spectacular, is chugging along at slightly more than 3 per cent a year and inflation is under control.  The central bank has kept interest rates steady at a marvellously precise 1.875 per cent since July 2011 and Medley Global Advisors, a macro research service owned by the FT, expects it to stand pat for at least the rest of this year.  Dig a little deeper, though, and Taiwan is battling to retool a mercantilist economic model that is no longer working well either for it or, indeed, for many of its regional peers. The island’s exports have dropped every month so far this year and are now expected to shrink 2.6 per cent in 2015, the first contraction since the crisis year of 2009.  While some of that can be blamed on an anaemic global recovery and weakness in mainland China specifically, the truth is that Taiwan’s largely anonymous component suppliers and middlemen are losing out to branded rivals in Korea and Japan. And the strength of the Taiwan dollar against both won and yen is certainly not helping.  Politically, too, the calm is superficial. Domestically, the former authoritarian nation has turned into a rowdy democracy, where half a million people marched in the streets last year and activists stormed parliament. Geopolitically, Taiwan is caught between the economic and cultural pull of the mainland, which has sworn to eventually reunite with it, and a growing sense of independence from China, underpinned by the US pledge to come to its military aid if necessary.  These tensions will come to a head again in the run-up to next January’s presidential elections, likely to be won by Tsai Ing-wen from the opposition Democratic Progressive party — who has been denounced as a “splittist” by Beijing. Under a President Tsai, further economic integration with the mainland would be unlikely, to put it mildly.  Which leaves investors in a tricky position. Over the medium term, there is scope to raise the country’s potential growth rate by opening up the service sector, investing in infrastructure and education and promoting other supply-side reforms. More immediately, policy makers are talking about relaxing fiscal policy next year in order to boost economic expansion.  Against that, however, the central bank will have to raise rates at some point if only to follow the US Federal Reserve. While it can use open market interventions to keep the currency reasonably stable at about 31 to the US dollar, the island’s exporters are likely to continue to lose competitiveness to the Samsungs of this world. Higher borrowing costs are also likely to constrain consumption given household debt at more than 80 per cent of GDP. So a steady performance is probably the best that can be expected from Taiwanese assets . . . which is unexciting."
taiwan,3cevg1,HolyShazam,4,Tue Jul 7 11:00:14 2015 UTC,"Two things about this article surprised me: Taiwan's GDP per capita is higher than S. Korea's, and household debt is higher than 80% of GDP.

This is also ignoring the fact that the proportion of white collar workers in Taiwan is much higher than that in China. So even under the assumption that Taiwanese white collars are making the same as those in China, you still have a huge mass of laborers that would have a much lower income.

He was involved in massive kickback scandal and sentenced to jail; however, he managed to granted medical bail, and successfully get elected as legislator during bail period to avoid sentence. He then fled to China to avoid further trial (for his another kickback accuse).  For Wang J-P himself, he is known for involved in loan fraud in the 80's which several legislators were granted overlending from bank in order to push some bank-friendly laws. The scandal caused massive bank run at the time. Other involved legislators were either fled or gradually retired from politics (and get caught by other money laundering scandal), only Wang remained as notable figure in the scene."
taiwan,3cfokc,PotbellyPanda,3,Wed Jul 8 03:51:54 2015 UTC,"Worth noting is that 伍澤元 had a protege named Cheng Tai-chi 鄭太吉, who was actually sentenced to death and executed in 2000 (the early days of Chen Shui-bian's administration).

Certainly in Australia people can be extremely insensitive to price when planning their wedding meaning that prices go up but people just accept it and pay anyway. Everyone grumbles but ultimately coughs up 2-5 times the regular price for wedding specific items. ""Those flowers will be $1500. Oh its for a wedding? $3000."" The same happens for cake, venue hire, car hire and most other things.  People assume they will only get married once, ""it's your special day!"" etc etc so you have vendors pushing prices up and little resistance from customers to price hikes, with the customers often showing up assuming they are going to spend tens of thousands of dollars on their wedding so what the hell.

taiwan,3cfzsv,Get9,3,Tue Jul 7 17:29:34 2015 UTC,"Going on Tealit.com or one of the Chinese language job sites and searching for a job. You can also use agencies like Teach Taiwan or DeWey, though I caution that agencies are generally pretty annoying/bad to work with.  Regardless, you find jobs available, e-mail the potential employer, have your Skype interview, have them apply for your work permit, and then send that in to one of the TECO offices for your resident visa. After arriving in Taiwan on your resident visa, you have fifteen days to apply for your working ARC.  That is the completely legal way of doing it."
taiwan,3cfzsv,JillyPolla,2,Tue Jul 7 19:52:17 2015 UTC,"To be totally legal, yes. Like it's complicated. I believe that if you go in on a tourist visa with express intent of looking for employment, then that's against the rules.

If Taiwanese asset prices are hurt it will have some negative wealth effects on the island which would be pretty bad, but nothing world-ending.  Looking forward, it could be expected that Taiwan might need to start shopping elsewhere for low-cost manufacturing.  Taiwanese companies already manufacture in Mexico, Southeast Asia, South America, and Africa, so it's not unknown territory.

taiwan,3cdr35,mantrap2,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:27:53 2015 UTC,It will be bad because China will have to devalue their currency in order to drive exports up. In that case it will be very expensive for China as a main importer of Taiwanese goods to buy anything from Taiwan. Taiwan will most likely have no other choice just to do the same with their currency.   On the other hand it also means buying cheap NTD with euros.

taiwan,3cdr35,just_face,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:30:46 2015 UTC,That's not how things work. I find way way way way too many people /r/taiwan and /r/china posters just are... not informed. They read articles about China and then think they know how the stock market works or how the economy functions.     The stock market is regarded as a way to funnel money into the hands of people. Part of the reason why the US went the route of QE is so people wouldn't lose all their savings/accumulated wealth and go apeshit.      China does not want the stock market to be high just to look cool. It's used as a way to get money into the hands of normal (and rich) people. The capital location aspect can almost be seen as a secondary purpose.
taiwan,3cdr35,pork_orc,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:46:03 2015 UTC,"China does not want its people to get a competitive return on their savings, as a matter of macroeconomic policy.  Hence low-interest rates paid on savings, mandatory currency repatriation for companies, and with the stock market now, high prices for what are small pieces of a company that grant little control over how it runs.  China is continually bleeding out the household sector to subsidize banks and industry.    Your opinions seem like standard economics/finance undergrad.  I would strongly recommend getting a solid foundation in macroeconomics.  Make sure you memorize all the relationships and be able to do national-level accounting.  Also check out some newer economic research on issues like Japan's monetary policy."

To get a 身分證, you still need to go to Taiwan."

I'm really pleased that things seems to be shifting in regards to medical care and the ability to accept outside help. Taiwan offered help during the Fukushima Daiichi disaster and Japan offered assistance with the current water park incident; both times one side rejected the other because there was no agreement or law allowing it.  It's great that the government is willing to bend and allow foreign assistance, as current Taiwanese staff are overwhelmed."

It seems a lot of the ads aren't really available or the price actually is double once you contact them. It's really weird. I've never used Airbnb before living here so maybe that's how it is everywhere. For example, on a recent trip to Kenting, I started contacting properties two weeks in advance and still couldn't manage to book one and ended up staying at a hotel. That being said, I've never been in a loud hotel or hostel in Taiwan. (This could just be my experience) But, it seems like everyone has been pretty respectful of noise, etc. I think the best advice for airbnb is, contact a lot of people and make sure you send them a message in Chinese along with the English (in case it's easier for them). If you contact many and in advance, then you should be alright. There are some cute listings even if they hard to reserve. Good luck!"

taiwan,3c6zst,just_face,9,Sun Jul 5 13:53:32 2015 UTC,"The High Court said it based its ruling on the grounds that the victim had given contradicting testimony and the Yamur had passed lie detection tests.  According to the police, Yamur brought a woman to his apartment in April 2013 under the pretense of feeding medicine to his rabbit, and then attempted to rape her. He also sexually assaulted a 16-year-old girl that same year, the police said.  The Taipei District Court sentenced Yamur to one year and 10 months' imprisonment for attempted rape in April 2013, but acquitted him of sexual assault due to inconsistencies in the 16-year-old victim's testimony. Yamur appealed the first ruling to the High Court.   There's nothing wrong with having high standards of proof for convicting people of rape but I think if it is so hard to convict people they ought to get more than 1 year 10 months when they are convicted. That's an absurdly low sentence for rape."

Yes of course there are those who are interested in foreigners, but most certainly not all of them. This is your bias due to the circles you find yourself in and the girls who do want to talk to you, who you seem to think count for the majority. Honestly the type of Taiwanese girls I see who are mad about foreigners are mostly unattractive ones.  Yeah I agree this guy is an almost 30 year old loser.

There really is no demographic of women in Taiwan in which a local guy--other than one who is rich as hell--could go wild and bang a different girl every weekend or whatever.

It's annoying enough to be stuck constantly being an informal ambassador for one's own country, but if literally any white person (are Turkish people even considered white?) does anything ever, Taiwanese people will use it as an excuse to bitch and moan about how All Foreigners Forever are Being Mean to We Poor Defenseless Taiwanese. Ignoring that: 1. Taiwanese women are not children and they have agency. They chose to sleep with this sleaze. 2. Taiwanese themselves do the same thing to Vietnamese/other southeast Asians and then act like their shit doesn't stink.

taiwan,3c6fyd,omkmg,14,Sun Jul 5 07:37:48 2015 UTC,"Are you landing at TPE or Songshan? That is super important for us to know. I'm going to continue based on the assumption you're landing at TPE in Taoyuan, outside Taipei. If you land at Songshan, it's in the center of Taipei.  Whether you'll have time to go to Taipei and walk around depends on several factors, including immigration, the return security check, and how much you're willing to spend. You may breeze through immigration, or you may arrive at the queue behind 400 tourists from Beijing. You may breeze through the return security check, or you may get stuck in line. On a good day, you can get through immigration in 20 minutes, and get through security in 10.  A taxi (1000 TWD each way) can get you from TPE to Taipei Main within 45 minutes, depending on traffic and how crazy your driver is. If you run into traffic, maybe one hour. Barring an extreme event that backs up traffic for hours, it should only take a maximum of two hours for the round trip between TPE and Taipei via taxi.  A bus (Kuoguang - 130 TWD each way) can get you to Taipei main within an hour, but they leave in intervals of like, 10 or 15 minutes. If you're lucky, you could get on the bus just as it departs, and have the same luck on your return to the airport.  There is also a shuttle + high speed rail option (around 200 TWD total?). Again, there are variables, but the trip should take a little over 40 minutes on a good day.  So, with these three options, under the best of conditions, including both immigration and security, you can expect a total round trip transit time of anywhere between 2 to 2.5 hours. That would give you 3.5 to 4 hours in Taipei.  Of course, you could get stuck in immigration, could get stuck waiting for the bus, get stuck in traffic, get lost in Taipei, get on the wrong bus on the way back and get stuck in security and miss your flight by hours.  It's all up to luck, cost, and how you manage your time.  Edit: last time I arrived at TPE (during the early evening), it took two hours to get through immigration, 30 minutes to get my bag, an hour to in the taxi line, and an hour to get to Taipei)"

The only problem is when I'm in a hurry and need something urgently, I just tell them to go ahead and speak Chinese because I don't have time to give them the free English lesson.   My non-Chinese Asian colleagues get a kick out of watching the bizarre exchange between the foreigner speaking Chinese and the Taiwanese speaking English. They always ask one of my Asian colleagues if I'm their English teacher. Talk about deep-rooted stereotypes."

My girlfriend doesn't speak English well so my Mandarin is pretty decent in daily conversation. There is one thing that just fucking pisses me off though. I can't fucking stand it when I try to order something at a restaurant or talk to an employee at a store and the person really loudly replies in English because they wan't to show off to their coworkers how well they speak. I let it go most of the time but occasionally I just have to put them down a bit and respond like I can't understand them.

I get nearly physically angry lately when I was at a pool joint and these Chinese mostly likely overseas students had no idea how to order at the bar. They were all banter with each other on how to get a table and order drinks and I was just kind of giggling at them. They finally finally got a ticket for a table - one of them noticed how I kind of giggled right after every silly thing they said and I think he kind of realized I mostly understood him. So I come out in Chinese and ask if he's here studying or working. Dumb founded he answered studying, in English. Then I ask, again in Chinese, if he's been here long, I forget whether he responded in English or Chinese but again he said not long. Later, they just so happen to have the table next to me, in between shots I ask some really simple questions, 'How are you licking it so far, what are you studying, are you at XXX uni etc.' and he comes out in completely broken English to my every question, 'I'm sorry I don't understand you.' I wanted to push him under a train. You fucking cock you just responded to me in Chinese and I know my Chinese is good enough that you understand - there's just a mental blockage that refuses to allow you to process that I'm speaking Chinese. And if that's the case, fuck off you should not be studying for a higher degree in the U.S."

The problem is that the names in the game share the same characters in the TC and JAP versions, but Japanese uses its own pronunciation（音読み）, instead of the real Chinese pronunciation, which the EN version is based off. So for English fans of the game, they only know of ""Cao Cao"", which is the Chinese pronunciation of 曹操, but makes no sense in Japanese.

The former two had Uncle Sam pay for it, while the latter have technical skills/ethnic privilege that got them the job.

And as someone that's currently in Taiwan for summer vacation, I really want to try this trip hopefully before I leave. I have a couple question though, How did you know where you were going? like was there signs that show you? and if you ended up using your phone for direction, do you think it'll be inconvenient without? (because I don't have data =/) Finally, when you stop for lunch/dinner, where did you park your bike? (i assume you went to restaurants)."
taiwan,3c2f7f,DerpyDogs,2,Sat Jul 4 15:33:55 2015 UTC,"Hi! As for the questions...  How did I know where I was going? I began blindfolded to be honest but the route is pretty much straight forward. As long as you stay in the ""cycling"" trail you shall reach your destination. From what I understand you can technically begin from Xindian and also in the route from time to time you find signs with maps of the area and also telling you where does this lead to in the case of a split. I never used my phone for GPS, just to take photos. I didnt have data that day either so I guess you should be fine.   And about the lunch/dinner...I ate lunch before beggining and the place where I ate dinner was a small ""resting station"" or something and you could park your bicycle there without any problem. But I wouldn't consider that a restaurant, it was more of the like of a kiosk. In some of the ""parks"" you could also find street vendors to buy snacks  Otherwise you can always derail from the route and take one of the exits into the main streets and there should be restaurants around. Also in Tamsui there is a night market and quite a lot of restaurants if you feel like going all the way down there to eat."

taiwan,3bylmc,laopi,6,Fri Jul 3 05:38:01 2015 UTC,"However, I always had difficulties understanding exactly what pro-independence wants to achieve. The key is not really what Taiwan thinks, or to a great extent, what China thinks. If the world at large does not see Taiwan as an independent country, then nothing we do or say internally will make any difference, and the sad thing is, no country in the world dares to challenge China at the moment.  I identify as Taiwanese, and I am vehemently opposed to unification with China. But at the same time, I see no point of an internal movement for ""independence"", as a) it will not change anything, and b) it would make diplomatic maneuvering even more difficult than it is now. We don't need to tell ourselves that we are independent -- that is a de facto truth and all but a few percent of Taiwanese people know that -- we need to tell the wider world that we are, and what makes us different from China.  It always strikes me how clearly the Japanese distinguish between Chinese and Taiwanese people. If the same kind of distinguishment can be made by a majority of people in the world, we are most of the way there."
taiwan,3bylmc,Roygbiv0415,4,Fri Jul 3 06:45:29 2015 UTC,I completely agree but it's an uphill battle when we have to participate as Chinese Taipei on the world stage and not having any consulates/embassies abroad (TECO notwithstanding)
taiwan,3bylmc,dajackal,2,Fri Jul 3 07:58:23 2015 UTC,"The presumptive presidential candidate of the biggest political party in the country is running on the platform of Taiwan and China being two governments of the same country (near as anybody could tell). I would say an internal independence movement is pretty useful for ensuring that this becomes an increasingly less mainstream position to take, not to mention keeping the weird Sino-centrism out of our textbooks.  (Not to say that this particular party will be particularly successful in doing so. They probably won't.)"
taiwan,3bylmc,pipedreamer220,2,Fri Jul 3 07:31:04 2015 UTC,"If the world at large does not see Taiwan as an independent country   The World at large still think Taiwan and Thailand are the same thing, so don't expect much from the World at large :(  As for the rest of your comment, I agree, but the problem is even if other countries have an opinion on what Taiwan is or is not, this opinion disappears behind the magic curtain of global economy and the famous ""we don't want China to be angry at us, it's too big of a market"". Good luck to fight this off."
taiwan,3bylmc,RawKriexy,2,Fri Jul 3 09:37:02 2015 UTC,"I believe declarcing themselves to be an independent nation will strengthen Taiwan's already pretty weak identity. Many people barely know Taiwan and how it differs from the rest of East Asia. I've got the feeling that Taiwan as a whole is in a sort of a Identity crisis. Are they Chinese? No? Then what are they? Taiwanese seems to be more positive to Japan than China, and were once ruled by them. Does that make them Japanese? No... then what are Taiwanese?  I think this is sort of a question the nation asks itself right now- Declaring clearly to be a distinct country from China would then not only give Taiwan the world's attention (Imagine this over the world news, Taiwan vs China...), but also clearly label the population as ""Taiwanese.""  I think the reason the US is putting so much pressure on Taiwan is that if Taiwan would declare independence,  it will most likely lead to utter chaos in the world. Technically, it would be totally wrong NOT to recognise a democratic, rather well developed country that's an ally. Not only for the US, but for Europe too. It's just inevitable that such countries as these WILL have to recognise Taiwan as a country. Or else, they will directly give the signal that China is the king of the world. Of course, this is a situation neither US nor EU would like to ever reach in coming years. So they pressure Taiwan's politicians to not pursuit declaring Taiwan as a seperate nation."

taiwan,3by7k7,sugarpopsrock,5,Fri Jul 3 03:26:49 2015 UTC,"It's pretty nice here.     Weather-wise, it's very (miserably) hot in the summer, especially if you are out in the sun, but autumn, winter, and spring have very nice weather, especially compared to cold, rainy Taipei.    Air pollution can be bad at times (AQI in the low to mid hundreds), but this depends on the day and where you are in the city.  On some days the air quality is great, with sunny blue skies.  Apparently they are closing a refinery in the near future that's going to help with this.  Public transportation is not bad, but it doesn't come close to Taipei's.  Driving is by far the easiest way to get around unless the start and end of your destination are both near stations on the limited MRT network, but driving may not be an option for you.  If you have or make friends who have cars (or get a car yourself), it will make your life a lot easier.  The bike share is not a bad option to get to places where the MRT doesn't go, as long as you are comfortable riding in the traffic here, which is quite chaotic  compared to up north (lots more running red lights, etc.).    The bus system is typically too infrequent to be reliable in my experience, unless you're on a popular line or at the beginning of a route that has scheduled, posted departures (and those departure times line up with when you need to leave).  There is a good bit of variety in things to do, but nowhere near the variety of Taipei, especially when it comes to live music, bars, clubs, art, shopping, etc.  Still, everything is quite a bit cheaper here, especially rent, so you do see new ventures opening fairly often, though whether they last is another story.  It's enough to keep things interesting if you know where to look, but if you're in need of variety and new things to do all the time, you will probably find it lacking.  Tainan is very easy to get to by train, and Kenting is not too far via bus or taxi.  The Donggang/Dapeng Bay area is nice if you like sailing, windsurfing and seafood.  Weekend trips to Taipei via HSR are easy and comfortable, but not super cheap (though what you save on cost of living down here can pay for several such trips after a few months).  There's very little you can't find or buy here, whether it's food or other things, it just may be found in a less obvious place than in Taipei.  The various Facebook groups help if you need to find something specific.    Money-wise, it obviously depends on how much you are working.  Five hours per week at that wage is going to be very tough.  Forty hours per week at that wage won't be a problem at all, especially if you don't need to pay rent.  Overall, I think it's a nice place, especially for a year.  The main issue for most people here is finding work, but that's not an issue for you."

taiwan,3by7k7,Roygbiv0415,2,Fri Jul 3 07:54:38 2015 UTC,"Expanding a few thoughts of my own.   Not that this matters, but Taipei has even more miserable summers, so I consider Kaohsiung to be acceptable. At least there's some semblance of a breeze at night... Not only the air, but the tap water is also more mineral laden, and gives a ""rough"" feeling when taking a shower. Or a scooter. Kaohsiung people love their scooters, but then again, see issue No.1. And people riding their scooters in reverse. Sigh. That can somewhat be alleviated by the real-time bus arrival info system, but you need to plan ahead. Well, it's quite boring indeed, and commerce centers shift around a lot. The older districts really feel quite deserted. Again, with the exception of Taipei, you might find yourself reaching a place (Tainan train station for example), but can't figure out how to move around from there. A car or scooter, or at least a driver's licence so you can rent one on the spot would definitely be a huge plus when traveling around. In general Kaohsiung feels like a retirement home now, mostly populated by moms and dads, while younger people seek work up north. It's still a great place, but rather sleepy compared to Taipei or even Taichung."

It can actually feel kind of depressing sometimes, but it's also very nice not to have to deal with the crowds that you find in Taipei and other big(ger) cities in Asia."

My monthly expenses are anywhere from $10000 to $20000 ($16000 being a max most of the time) depending on how much I cook and how much I drink. This city is really cheap if you stay off bars and if you're not really interested in Western restaurants (which I am only once or twice a month). However I do drink quite a lot, but instead of sitting in expensive bars most of the time, I sit at convenience stores watching the life on streets, or I enjoy my beers by the Love River, the beach, on rooftops, in parks or just walking around etc.   You'll be more than fine if you share an apartment and work at least 10hrs a week with that pay which is much more than many locals earn."

taiwan,3bxm0u,behtyas,5,Fri Jul 3 00:10:32 2015 UTC,"Facebook group for housing https://www.facebook.com/groups/Taiwanapartmentsandroommates/  Know what you want before going in. Some things came to mind-   Taiwanese use ping ""坪"" as the area unit instead of sq ft or sq meter. 1 坪 = 3.3 sq meter. 15 to 20坪 should be more than comfortable for two people.  套房 usually equals to a bachelor or studio, may or may not have a proper stove. Finding a place with an full size oven is going to be hard, but real estate agents can help you out on that.  Most rentals will come semi to fully furnished. If you don't like a piece of furniture, you can have them remove it, or if you don't see something you need, ask the landlord if they would split the cost with you 50/50. Taiwanese mattress can be hard as rock...because supposedly it's better for your back. Test it out while you view the apt.  A lot of the older apt have just 1 room for both shower and toilet with no curtain separating the wet and dry area. Water might get to the toilet when you shower (and some people are really bothered by this.)  Older buildings (5 floors or less with no elevators) are more prone to plumbing problems. Try to find something near a MRT station even if it's not one right in the middle of the city, it will make your life a lot easier.  The most expensive areas are Xinyi ""信義區"" (near Taipei 101) and parts of Da'an ""大安區"" (the ""East District""). IMO a nice neighborhood in town would be something like the Taipei arena or 南港 along the river.  A top floor addition ""頂樓加蓋"" to the main building usually is a cheaper option. Not the best insulation but lot of them would give you enough outdoor space to make your own patio. Most apt building will have some sort of h&h fee, try to figure out if it's included in the rent. Since you are in Taipei, I'm guessing you have seen the garbage trucks... some building will use the h&h fee to hire someone to take the trash out for the whole building. Make sure you figure out if they have someone to do it or if you would have to do it yourself.  Real estate agents will literally show you the place at your convenience..late at night if need to be. They can probably show you some units this weekend, just walk into one in an area that you want to live in and they will figure the rest for you. Some landlords will not rent to foreigners, they are racists but just move on. Make sure you have someone who can read Chinese go through the lease with you before you sign.    Edit: spelling"

Could be that the regulations were written primarily by administrators and not medical professionals, or that they were written based on outdated information which nobody has bothered to update (especially given how small the affected donor pool is).

We found our way to this mall that was doing an America week ending with a fireworks show on the 4th and donuts being sold. It was full of the most stereotypical Americana that you can picture. I loved it.   This week, back in the U.S., will mostly feature BBQ and fireworks."

taiwan,3btx01,kylesuo,4,Thu Jul 2 03:01:47 2015 UTC,"Well, speaking about left turns, the left turn arrow in the location you're talking about says that there are no left turns in that area. So, you could make your way from the side lane into the center lane, or center to side, but you can't turn left from the center. Instead, you'd need to go to an intersection and make the required turns (like a u-turn into the other center lanes and then get over). As long as u-turns are not forbidden at the intersection, they should be OK.  If the road doesn't have the no left turns sign, you can turn left from the center lanes.  Basically, just follow the signs.  I'm not sure what confuses you about the roundabouts. Basically, you get on it from wherever you're coming from, move into a lane that's taking you around the circle until you get nearer your destination road, then you move back over and leave the roundabout. If you miss your turnoff, then you just go around again!"
taiwan,3btx01,Get9,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:29:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the helpful response! So to clarify, there's no reason I couldn't move over to the center lanes here, I just can't actually turn left until I reach a proper intersection?"
taiwan,3btx01,Get9,2,Thu Jul 2 03:42:08 2015 UTC,"Unless there is a sign I'm missing, you should be able to move into the center lanes. Just be careful about it because nobody is watching for you."

No left turn arrow: Turn when it is safe, unless there is a no left turn sign.  Ah, the Rennai Roundabout: I drive this every day multiple times a day. PRACTICE. Next time just drive in circles a dozen times and you'll master that roundabout. Merge across all lanes of traffic while on the roundabout to achieve expert level. Also, a lot of drivers don't know how to drive it, so keep one hand on the horn when merging lanes."

taiwan,3bpj5a,x3nomik,20,Wed Jul 1 11:49:59 2015 UTC,"Taiwan didn't rise up against the Chinese during the Chinese Civil War. The Nationalists (KMT/ROC) fought against the Communists (CCP/PRC). As you know, the former lost and ran off to Taiwan.  In every way, shape, and form, Taiwan functions as a country, and is only belittled and bullied by China. There is nothing absurd about Taiwan knowing it is a country.  Additionally, the Confederacy just stayed on what land they already owned (though some borders changed). Nobody ran off and occupied Puerto Rico or Cuba or some other island/land, so your analogy doesn't really work."

We vote for the KMT next time. The KMT is plain stupid? We vote for a non-aligned candidate next time.   Even though it's a pity we often had to pick the least worse from two lousy ones, the choice is there, unlike HK right now, where basically a group of 500 ""elites"" decided everything for everyone.

taiwan,3bpj5a,Laser-circus,3,Thu Jul 2 04:46:34 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how anyone can answer this with anything other than ""worse off.""  Taiwan has almost everything that an independent nation has, except for complete representation in a few international bodies (the only notable ones being the UN and the WHO).  And Taiwan declaring independence would unlikely change that given China's influence and its presence on the UN Security Council.  In exchange for nothing practical, Taiwan loses its largest trading partner, leading to an instant recession with nothing on the horizon to make up for it.  Why would anyone want that when Taiwan is already independent in all but name?  edit: just some back of the envelope calculations.  Taiwan's trade surplus with China in 2012 was roughly ~$40 billion.  Its total GDP for that year was $650 billion.  That's a 6% decrease in GDP that just disappears over night, worse than the US Great Recession.  And you can't inflate your way out of a real economic shock like that.  This also ignores capital income from Taiwanese investments in China (which have totaled $60 billion) and labor income from China's investments in Taiwan."

taiwan,3bua4a,PotbellyPanda,2,Thu Jul 2 20:53:46 2015 UTC,"At the end of the Qing Dynasty, there were two main schools of reform. One is represented by Kang Yu-Wei, which proposed that a reformed system of Monarchy with limited power by the emperors would serve the Chinese culture the best. The other school, represented by Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, were revolutionaries. They thought that the Imperial system was beyond repair, and that the only way to save China was to start anew with a Republican system.  Kang's thoughts on reform was accepted by the Kuang-hsu Emperor, and other more progressive people within the imperial circles for obvious reasons. The Hundred Days Reform was an implementation of Kang's ideas, but the reform was stopped abruptly by more conservative factions of the court. This meant that the only way forward for possible reform was the revolutionary Nationalists headed by Sun Yat-Sen.  What's curious, is that Puyi really hated the Nationalists. He blamed them for causing the troubles within his life. During WWII, he cooperated with the Japanese. At the end of the Civil War, he chose not to go to Taiwan with the Nationalists government. Instead, he stayed in Mainland China, and as a result was sent to labor camp. He died after he was released, and basically had a hard life. I think had he chose to go to Taiwan, he would've been paid a generous salary by the government, put up in some comfortable dwelling, and had a title of former Emperor. Today, Taiwan might still have direct descendants of his."

His family did reign over this island for 3 decades. Unlike all other foreign regime, (including KMT today as well as Japan,Spain,Dutch) he did care about local people and did built a quite successful country at that time.

Next as far as learning Chinese fluently goes, the ROI isn't really there unless you want to do it as an academic hobby. The only people I know that can fluently hui the zhong have either had Uncle Sam pay for it or are a natural savant at languages.

I don't know why availability can't be determined by the country associated with your Apple ID, as with the iTunes/App Store, etc. I'm guessing licensing is the problem. Which makes me think: let's say you are in a country that supports Apple Music/Radio, then you go on vacation to a country where one or both of the services is unsupported. Would you simply no longer be able to use the service(s) while you are away? That seems ridiculous. It certainly is a good way to piss people off.  I wonder why it took Spotify so long to come to Taiwan, and why Taiwan isn't supported by Apple Music. I would think Spotify/Apple would be happy to compete in a market of >20M people. Again, maybe licensing (costs) are the root issue. That said, KKBox has been operating in Taiwan for quite a while."

taiwan,3blh5v,x3nomik,19,Tue Jun 30 04:37:14 2015 UTC,"All right it's 1:45 AM, what better time than this to try to dig up repressed memories!?  I was (or more specifically, my unit was) in charge of a huge veteran's housing project. Exactly how this happened is completely beyond me, seeing as my unit is a training school, but hey, that's how the military works. Anyway, the veterans this project was built for are all pretty old, they came here with the KMT in '49. The housing project was built with the express purpose of housing single retired veterans--I'm pretty sure the government's thinking was that they were all going to die pretty soon, and then the land could be redeveloped as all land in Taipei must be.  Well, unfortunately these guys were single when they moved in, but they certainly didn't stay single. When China was opened for family visitation in the late 1980s, a bunch of them went back and came back with young wives. Soon they were having kids. Some of them died, and theoretically when that happens their rooms were supposed to be sealed off so that nobody could use them (remember, the government was counting on all of them dying sometime soon). But of course, since  those rooms were designed for a single old man and not a young family, the wives and children usually took over the empty rooms. All of this was happening without anybody really caring.  So that's how things were when I took over. Unfortunately my arrival coincided with that of new higher-ups, and they wanted things to be done by the book. They wanted to know how many people were still living in that project. They wanted a  clear count of the occupied and unoccupied rooms. They wanted the wives and children evicted. None of this was possible. We're talking about three enormous five-story apartment blocks, with a total of something like 700 rooms. The name lists I was given was years out of date. A new census of the complex was impossible unless I could devote months of my time to it, and frankly still unlike to do anything seeing as everybody there was accustomed to lying their ass off about how many people lived where. And me evicting anyone there was an absurd idea--these people were colonels and major before they retired, and they're not going to listen to some 24-year-old second lieutenant who was barely out of basic training.   What happened over the next half-year was basically a game of whack-a-mole in slow motion. I would make some headway with the census, and identify a few rooms as empty. I would post huge EMPTY signs on the doors. The next time I was there those rooms would be occupied, and different rooms would be empty. Every month the higher-ups would come for an inspection, see that there were still wives and children running around and that I still couldn't give them an accurate count of who was living there, and hurl abuse at me for my incompetence. They threatened to take away my leave a few times, too, but they never followed through--I think they realized that they themselves would be pretty screwed over if they put an accurate account of the situation in writing.  The best part was when another veterans housing complex nearby had an expose run on 壹週刊 about it, because apparently somebody was running an brothel out of it. We were spared the brunt of the torrent of bullshit that came after that, but a bunch of higher-higher-ups did come to inspect ""my"" complex, and they decided... that the space was decrepit. WELL NO SHIT SHERLOCK. So I spent the entire following week helping paint the common areas in the three apartment blocks by day, and then going back to the office at night to deal with all my other shit.   To be honest, I suspect the people who are loudest in judge the draft dodgers are the ones who never had to serve themselves. Anybody who's actually done it would know that it's the only rational choice. You should 100% do it if you have a legal way of getting out. Nobody deserves the Kafkaesqe/Sisyphean nightmare that is our armed forces."

taiwan,3blh5v,pipedreamer220,9,Tue Jun 30 08:34:14 2015 UTC,"It's not about the physical demands (which are indeed not that high), it's about the deeply fucked up institutional culture in which careerist officers focus all their energies on passing the buck to the endless stream of draftees that come up through the pipeline, who are given responsibilities that they don't have the training, the experience, or the support to take. Every single person who's done national service has had the experience of being responsible for things that are entirely beyond their control, and when things go pear-shaped--whoops, you just lost an entire month's worth of leave, guess you should've been more careful, right?  In fact, most people I've talked to have said that the most physically harsh part of their service (for instance, training for major exercises) is the least sucky part, because at least you'll no longer have to be responsible for the maintenance of some worthless MacGuffin that probably had never ever worked right anyway.  To be honest, I suspect that most of the worst aspects of organizational culture you see in Taiwan have their roots in bad habits picked up in the military (especially in the past, when you had to serve two years). I do think there will be a change for the better once the post-conscription generation comes into power... if that ever happens."

taiwan,3blh5v,gandalfonacid,2,Tue Jun 30 05:23:07 2015 UTC,"This is sort of an old post, but seeing everyone here had a negative experience with Taiwanese military, I'd like to share something different.  I am not that old, and was only required one year of service. My unit was located on Tungyin Island, one of the Matsu Islands. Most people don't like going to remote islands, but I kind of liked it, I liked the scenery and the different experience, a few months isn't really long enough to get too tired of it. There were some minor inconveniences serving on an island, thinking back, it's actually sort of a good thing, it keeps people busy. During my eight months on the island, we had three minor and two major exercises, this plus daily life on an island, we almost always had something to work on. People were generally friendly, worked together, and had a good relationship. Even though nothing really interesting happened, skills learned in the military don't carry into society, I don't feel my time wasted, it was an okay one time experience.  What I think made my experience better compared to most others I talked to, was actually my officer lieutenant. He was strict and fair, the most important thing is he made sure tasks were evenly distributed, and to the right people. This isn't easy when managing an unit of a hundred people. Often, some are overloaded, or assigned something they don't can't handle, while others are bored/slacking off. Most bad military experiences I heard of, come from bad management, which probaby comes from putting twenty-somethings in charge of a hundred people."

When I priced a few things at duty-free, I found they were more expensive than at grocery stores in Taipei, such as the Tienmu Carrefour.  Possibly the more unusual things are cheaper (or unavailable at the regular stores in Taipei), for example the holiday decanters with glass figurines inside.  Liquor stores in Taipei are more expensive than grocery stores, though, so if it's not a mass-bottled product (like, say, Absolut Vodka), then it might be closer to the duty-free's prices, but probably not the same.

The bus runs 24 hours and it departs every 15-20 minutes or so. It costs about 125 NT (~$4 USD) for a full-price ticket and it takes about 50-60 minutes to get to the airport.  This gives you more information about the bus (1819 - the first one).  Also, this gives you details on taking the bus to the airport and where its located etc.  Another option is to take a taxi, which would probably cost about 1200-1500 NT (~$40-50 USD).

As someone who did 2 years back in the day.  It was boring, plenty of sweeping the floors and dealing with officers with bricks in their head. However, your stamina will increase by 400% for the next 10 years. You'll be meeting a lot of very interesting people from all over Taiwan. Good fun experiences overall apart from the boring part.  National service is like summer camp these day.  Only 4 months for you guys, it will be over before you know it."
taiwan,3bl0uh,PNR_Robots,3,Tue Jun 30 03:51:27 2015 UTC,"Are you still in school? If you are you need to prepare some documents to be authenticated in order for you to go in and out. Otherwise you risk not being able to leave Taiwan and will have to serve the military.  4 months vs 1 year 15 days depends on your age. If you're born after 1994 you only have to serve for 4 months, otherwise it's a year like the rest of us."
taiwan,3bl0uh,jewson,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:23:14 2015 UTC,Yes im still studying(Im going to first year university). Where do I get the documents?  Im after 1994 so 4 months i guess even though I dont want to lol
taiwan,3bl0uh,jewson,3,Tue Jun 30 02:28:17 2015 UTC,"You need your university to provide a proof of enrollment, which you'll then need to get authenticated at the consulate in the Netherlands. After that is done and you land in Taiwan, you need to head to the immigration agency to get an approval stamp on your Taiwanese passport which will grant you I believe a month to 3 months (I can't remember because it's been a while) in Taiwan."

Edit: all you Taiwanese-born Americans/Canadians/Europeans, or whatever you call yourselves, pay attention; many of you sing the praises of Taiwan to everyone you meet - you tell everyone how friendly, safe, and exciting Taiwan is, how great the food is, how great the nightlife is, etc. You defend the honor of this island nation to anyone who dares suggest that Taiwan is part of China. But when it comes to actually defending your home or your parents' home, you'd rather draft dodge than spend four months learning how to shoot a rifle. Grow a fucking dick."

But the internet meltdowns wouldn't have been nearly as entertaining and Jolin won Album of the Year anyway so I ain't complaining!"
taiwan,3bh3jg,pipedreamer220,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:29:31 2015 UTC,"I don't get his point about media not covering Fire Ex's win. There are plenty of coverages from what I've seen. And it'd make sense that mass media would be more focused on much much more popular and established artist like A-Mei, Jolin, and Eason Chan. It's not that the media were censoring them, they just wanted to report what people would care.  On a side note, it's weird that Mainland China allows the direct viewing of Golden Melody, but not the Golden Horse, which is a much more authoritative and legitimate award."
taiwan,3bh3jg,JillyPolla,3,Mon Jun 29 05:37:44 2015 UTC,The Golden Melody Awards are a lot less political and a lot more mainstream in their tastes. Many major Golden Horse nominations go to films that are banned in China.
taiwan,3bh3jg,pipedreamer220,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:25:51 2015 UTC,"Ah, interesting point."
taiwan,3bh3jg,crimsonSoldier,4,Mon Jun 29 06:28:16 2015 UTC,"I believe you were looking at Taiwan's coverage. The coverage of Fire Ex's win was either non-existent or scathing, in China; at least from the 4 news articles I was linked from Baidu. Also, Baidu Baike's entry on 2015 GMA has no mention about Song of the Year, only for this year."
taiwan,3bh3jg,JillyPolla,2,Mon Jun 29 06:35:50 2015 UTC,The author talked about Taiwanese media not reporting their win. Obviously nobody expect mainland media to report them. But his characterization of Taiwanese media shutting them out and the implication of political censoring is not correct.
taiwan,3bh3jg,crimsonSoldier,3,Mon Jun 29 12:53:09 2015 UTC,"No, the author's PRIMARY concern in the article was regarding the treatment of Fire Ex by the authorities in Singapore and China. At the end of the article, he mentioned a ""less nefarious, but still troubling"" problem in Taiwan.  I'm a Singaporean Chinese and a big fan of Fire Ex, even more so after their performance in Singapore which attracted only 20 fans. Despite the small turnout, they gave it their absolute best. Fire Ex will never gain a fan-base in Singapore, where the government has banned non-Mandarin Chinese languages from mainstream media. All the best to those guys!"
taiwan,3bh3jg,JillyPolla,3,Mon Jun 29 14:06:17 2015 UTC,"And I'm addressing his concern about Taiwanese media, not the main concern of the article.   I'm saying his concern is unfounded, because Taiwanese media is not purposely censoring them. They're just not as well known as the big names."

taiwan,3bku21,spittingalpacas,3,Tue Jun 30 04:18:31 2015 UTC,"Taiwanese people are pretty cool with foreigners in general. A lot of people (especially the younger generations) speak at least some basic english and are really helpful too in terms of directions, questions about transportation, and food.  As long as you have a general respect for culture (not littering, politeness, not being too loud, etc.) and keep an open mind about trying new things (and eating new foods) you'll have a great time in Taiwan!"
taiwan,3bku21,PNR_Robots,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:13:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the confirmation, that is what I sensed when I was there.  In Korea you can find a young person and ask if they speak English.  They will say no, but when you ask where is the bus station they will start speaking english (sometimes, most Koreans can't actually speak English of course)...  In Taiwan they would instead say yes to the English question regardless of whether or not they could really speak English.  Was really sweet of them even if there English wasn't very good.  So very different in that respect."

Don't get me wrong, I think Korea is great in its own ways, and there are things I definitely miss from my time there. But there are a lot of negatives that just don't show up to the same extent in Taiwan. Things like oppressive work environments, the overall pressure and stress put on people, the institutionalised misogyny, they're things you just don't see in Taiwan to nearly the same extent.  I think I'd sum it up as, Korea is very judgey, and Taiwan is very chill."

Fortunately there are a lot of hot guys in Taiwan and Taiwan is one of the more progressive countries in Asia towards the whole gay thing.    There are plenty of men's saunas so that you can get sex pretty much on demand.  Lots of guys like to party and play here, poppers are legal.  Also, you should consider switching to NTNU rather than NTU's chinese program.  NTU's chinese program is really hardcore and won't allow an all-pro sexman such as yourself much free time."

For 3 on 3, i suggest Shida and Taida Universities, NCCU has some indoor games Sat afternoon but they cunty about non students.   Xinsheng court is good from 9-1130 till lights go out, but I hate the surface and competition.  I'd suggest Daan park, my friends and I often play 9-1130ish on Wed oe Thurs depensing on the week.

taiwan,3bb6cr,just_face,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:14:33 2015 UTC,A wide spectrum of substances can become flammable once produced in a powder forum and released in the air. Even baby powder and cinnamon can be highly flammable.
taiwan,3bb6cr,kzilla88,11,Mon Jun 29 04:32:55 2015 UTC,Oh god. Appears to be a dust explosion. The flame spread so fast.  Wish the best for those caught in it...
taiwan,3bb6cr,Roygbiv0415,24,Sat Jun 27 19:01:44 2015 UTC,"I really hate to say this, because I don't at all want to make light of such a literally hellish tragedy, but I can't help but feel this is a direct consequence of the prevalent ""chabuduo"" attitude in Taiwan. Of course it could be a pure freak accident, I don't want to point fingers, but I feel like this lackadaisical attitude towards regulations and standards really needs to start being cracked down upon.  Although it's not at all unique to Taiwan, it's one of the few negative things I've experienced in my years here and it could so easily be fixed with better training and bigger consequences for those outside of specifications.  Edit: looking at the news, given how flammable the various starches and flours they're testing are, I wouldn't be surprised if a cigarette ignited it. Hopefully now the various anti smoking laws will be enforced?  That's always been something that's bothered me in Taiwan. Bars, pool halls, etc with blatant no smoking laws and signs posted everywhere, but nothing being enforced. I mean, I totally understand without police giving a fuck business owners won't want to alienate they're customers, but indoor rooms running on constant air conditioning filled with smokers become pretty terrible. Of course it's not ""worth it"", but I'd personally love to see smoking laws actually enforced. It's hardly unreasonable to have a dedicated smoking area or ask people to go outdoors to smoke."
taiwan,3bb6cr,Tyr808,14,Sun Jun 28 05:34:35 2015 UTC,"You're not making light of it, it's a pertinent observation.  I don't think ""chabuduo"" is applicable to this, though.  I doubt that the festival organizers even thought of the risk, much less said ""ah, what are the odds, who cares"".  It looks like the ignition source was the overhead lights, not open flames or fireworks.  Outside of specific at-risk industries or the military, most people in the U.S. wouldn't know about dust explosions.  Here, I'm finding that my nontechnical Taiwanese coworkers never learned even a lot of the simple science that I was taught in grade school, much less Macgyvering how to blow up a building with a bag of flour and a candle."
taiwan,3bb6cr,richardtheassassin,7,Sun Jun 28 09:08:13 2015 UTC,"If the festival organizers were not aware of the risk, then the management probably should have been more careful and have maybe some warnings of things to avoid. Especially when you have about a thousand people, like at that event. But with the Taiwanese, it's probably more like people paid to rent the place, so the park let them do and use whatever and no one cares... which goes back to this ""chabuduo"". It just feels like there should have been something to avoid this from happening."
taiwan,3bb6cr,lalamountain,7,Sun Jun 28 12:30:15 2015 UTC,"In other countries for a large event like this, statutory regulations and/or the insurance company  may require inspections by a ""fire marshal"" and/or the presence of fire/rescue personnel during the event. I'm not sure this would necessarily have prevented what happened, but you have to wonder.   Speaking of insurance, I saw on the news that the maximum payout for the entire event was $50,000,000NTD. I wasn't able today catch whether that was a limit set in law or just the amount of coverage purchased. The news also showed maximum payouts for the injured but I wasn't able to catch what they were. That said, given the number injured and the serious of the injuries and requisite medical care these people are going to need (as well as future loss of income, pain and suffering, etc.), 500萬 seems awfully low.   As for the 差不多/chabuduo culture others have noted, I was watching the news with a Taiwanese friend and I said, ""Geez it always seems like something awful like this has to happen before anyone takes action (and then I recited all the things that have happened in the past few years). Do you think anyone will be arrested?"" There are many great things about TW, but this chabuduo attitude (or whatever you want to call it), lack of safety standards (or lax enforcement thereof), combined with responsible parties not going to jail and/or just paying the fines and calling it a day, is really disappointing.  (Note: these things are not unique to Taiwan).   The one event that I still have a hard time accepting is the woman who got crushed in her car a few months ago in Taichung when they were erecting the MRT there. How anyone thought it was OK to let traffic flow under or nearby when they were erecting that portion of the structure is beyond me."

This is the major negative during my time living in Taiwan.  Just look at the buildings.  Look at the way people drive.  Look at all the food scandals to no end.  There is no real punishment and no consistent oversight on anything.  Nobody wants to take responsibility if they don't have to and especially if it costs money.    The owners will weep and bow on TV, the city will do some random inspections for a couple weeks and the next ""Chabuduo"" event will occur and all will be forgotten."

After the owner of the park (Wan Hai Lines) pushed responsibility onto the lessee of the event, English Tsai had the balls to say Eric Chu's local government should be held  ultimately responsible for this incident.  Isnt it funny, whenever shit hits the fan in a Blue administered city/county, the LGU is always blamed and held to account. On the flipside, when shit hits the fan in a Green controlled city/county, its suddenly the central governments responsibility. Take the sidewalk explosions in Gaohsiung last year. Responsibility was pushed onto central gov and the local little scumbags not only got away scot free but many got promoted.   So if Wan Hai (owner of the water park) and the lessee of this color event are held accountable why did Gaohsiung government not get a single slap on the wrist but the lessee (owner of pipes) get hit with fines and jail time? Gaohsiung city government leased out the underground land for the pipes and they receive monthly rent from those underground pipes so why were they not held accountable like Wan Hai is now?"

At the time of this writing, that was approximately $NT430,000 a year, but if there's any doubt, check to make sure that this number is still valid.     I don't believe you can get an APRC while on a student visa, even if you stay here for a long time. If you are a native English speaker, what I can recommend to you would be to find a job here (that gives you a work visa) and study Chinese on the side. You can definitely make enough to live and study here, even if you work part-time."

The most popular program is NTNU Mandarin Training Center (studied here for a couple years). If you have any questions, i can go into detail."
taiwan,3basvq,vigernere1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:48:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks you for this reply. I've heard similar things, and I think you're correct. Taipei is probably where I should live first.  Also, after looking at the NTNU MTC website, I must say it looks very cool. I can see why it's popular. Did you get a ARC while studying at the MTC? If you did, I'm curious what your path was. What visas did you get, did you arrive in Taipei then do a visa-run to HK once you got admitted into the MTC, for student visa? (Just looking for a brief walkthrough from the time you decided to go to Taiwan to you getting a ARC)"
taiwan,3basvq,talesfromthecryptt,3,Sun Jun 28 04:22:53 2015 UTC,"The website you linked to isn't loading correctly for me on mobile, so I'm not sure what program you discovered for this price. In Taipei, in terms of private schools, Taiwan Language Institute (TLI) is well regarded, much more so than Taiwan Mandarin Institute (TMI).   For more information on the MTC, review the mega thread on www.chinese-forums.com, which I've linked to previously in this subreddit (sorry I'm on mobile and don't have the link).  It seems like you want to stay in Taiwan long term, because otherwise I don't see the point or getting an ARC for most students. That said, you need to be in Taiwan on a work or student visa (visa code ""FR"") in order to qualify for an ARC. If you come on a student visa, make sure it's a 90 day visa and not a 60 day visa. Also make sure it's a multiple entry visa.   After 4 months of study at a government approved school, you can apply for an ARC. Note that when you apply, you must prove that you are enrolled in ongoing classes - you can't just get the ARC and stop going to school. Your ARC will expire when your school tearm ends. You have to pay a fee when first applying for the ARC, but subsequent renewals are free for 1 year.    Having the ARC won't make much of an immediate deference in your life, although it can help when signing up  for certain services (e.g. phone service, etc.) Six months after receiving it, you can apply for national health insurance. You have to pass and basic medical exam (which varies slightly depending on what country you come from). Health insurance is now billed every 2 months, and its costs ~$750/month for a student. Note: to qualify for health insurance you may be required to reside in Taiwan and not leave the country for 6-10 months (i.e. basically not leaving the country once you arrive for school, or not leave after receiving your first ARC). The don't quite remember the details, but nothing is more frustrating than having the waiting period for health insurance reset because you took a trip somewhere.   You may also want to consider coming to Taiwan to work (teaching English) and going to school. In this way you will have health insurance immediately, as well as a way to pay for you school (the MTC costs ~$25-27,000 per quarter AFAIK). English teachers usually work ~15-20hrs/week, make ~$45,000/month (this varies by school, city, and your qualifications), leaving plenty of time for school (although I suppose it depends on how much to me you want to devote to your studies)."

taiwan,3basvq,talesfromthecryptt,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:47:33 2015 UTC,"I never got an ARC, i just left the country every 90 days to HK and back. If my memory is correct, there were classmates that entered with a visitor visa, got the necessary paperwork from the school when they arrived and went to the immigration ministry in Taipei and converted to a student ARC there. One thing to note is that the immigration ministry REQUIRES you to actually attend class and get a decent grade to have it renewed every semester... so if you think you might skip class sometimes cuz youre hungover (taipei is a great party city), i suggest doing the 90 day hop or choosing a class time that is late in the day."

taiwan,3b6mne,Crackers_Water,7,Fri Jun 26 11:55:05 2015 UTC,"I'm something of an apartment hunting guru. There are any factors to consider.   There are nice and shitty apartments in any district in Taipei and New Taipei City, more likely a new building will be right next to some decrepit ones. You'll need to make sure it isn't too close to a restaurant's vents otherwise you will get that ""kitchen oil"" smell eventually everywhere. How to spot it is important. Plus there's how to recognize roach infestations. You also have to consider your mode of transportation in how close it is to the MRT or to the Youbike bikeshare or if you want a place too park your scooter if you plan to get one. Scooter parking is super important for me because it's a hassle, as is bike parking. You also have to consider that rooftop apartments are hotter but much cheaper and more towards your budget. However you'll even it out with electricity bills for the AC, they also tend to be poorly insulated. A mid level apartment will do better because you can have the upper and lower and surrounding apartments act as insulation. Avoid apartments that share a wall with the sun for most of the day, those walls will be hot and drastrcally increase your AC bill. Roommates are a hassle too because there's the trash and electricity sharing problem and a whole host of other issues. There are special apartments that run  your price that even include cleaning, but you're basically living in a hostel type situation, you get your own room, someone is hired to clean it often, but the room will be tiny, and you'll be sharing with like 12 other people. Some apartments will handle garbage for you, others will require you to run outside and toss it. If the midrise is above 5 floors, then you will likely have an elevator. Otherwise it's steps. This means if you live in a 5 floor mid-rise on the 6th floor ""roof hut"", you will need to run down all 5 flights and up again, twice or thrice a week at specific times of the day to toss the trash and you will need to purchase the garbage truck garbage bags to do so. You won't necessarily if your apartment handles trash for you. This one's a huge one for me. Buying water is a must if you don't have a filter, forcing you to lug huge jugs of water up and then having to recycle them later. There are easy to install filters, I recommend it for the convenience alone. You will likely be paid on the 5th of every month, this can be a hassle if your landlord wishes you to pay all bills and what not on the 1st or 30th. Make sure that your electricity bill is paid for you directly, if you live in a divided space and the landlord sets the bill, they may have you pay 6-8NT per kilowatt (I've heard even higher) which might result in high bills. This is why I always prefer to rent where I get and pay the electricity bills directly. Water can often be considered included with the rent, or you may have to pay it. These come every two months. There are lots of potential other ancillary costs, besides electricity and water, and can include internet, building maintenance, garbage bags (you need to buy specific ones), drinking water, and so forth. It can add up, don't just take the cost of the apartment at face value. Water heaters are often in two types, electric and gas and some work on-demand while others maintain a tank. The electric heated water tank is by far the most expensive option and in an apartment can add 1000NT-1500NT a month to your bill. A fridge, washing machine, and dryer are super important. If renting an old apartment, know that the landlord is only responsible for the AC in most cases for one year. If it breaks after that, you're SOL and in many cases on your own or will have to negotiate. Makes sure that the AC cools. Winter time insulation, and mold and moisture is a problem in many apartment. You really don't want an apartment that quickly grows mold so you'll need to buy a dehumidifier if your apartment does not come with one. If you have cameras or telescopes or other sensitive electronic equipment, you'll need a dry cabinet otherwise the lenses will oxidize and go bad. Living near busy roads usually means tons of soot. It's annoying to clean and can be a hassle. Consider that a dryer and washer is a must-have convenience. No dryer? Okay you'll hang things out. If you do, it is a shaded area? It rains in Taipei often and can ruin things. Its humid in Taiwan so clothes can take days to air-dry if in a shaded area but can get wet in spontaneous rain out in the open sun. You'll probably want a fridge, but fridges in Taiwan go bad quickly, and can smell and what not. You want to clear your things out. You can't just put fruits out on a pantry in a rooftop apartment, it'll go bad in hours or a day or two. So factor in a fridge."
taiwan,3b6mne,ShrimpCrackers,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:47:56 2015 UTC,"It's been my impression that many apartments come with dehumidifiers. It should be considered as must-have as a dryer (which is much rarer in Taiwan in my experience).  Also I've never heard of anyone in Taipei buying all of their drinking water (in the south, yes, because tap water there is just beyond saving). If the apartment doesn't have a filter dispenser, you could just get an electric kettle and boil the water a few minutes--that's what my family has always done and so far none of us have died."
taiwan,3b6mne,pipedreamer220,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:16:57 2015 UTC,"Yes there's the dehumidifier too!  Thats true, but if he's paying 11,000 his apartment might not even have a proper kitchen, assuming it's a separated all-in-one.  Electric Kettle would work too. In fact you could probably get away drinking the water directly. To be honest, I haven't heard of anyone dying from drinking the tap water in Taipei regularly and there are places with far worse drinking conditions. Personally a decent filter is like 2000NT and pretty easy to install and you can bring it with you, so... why not?"

Not too expensive, convenient from a transit point of view, and you can use the NTU campus as a park for walking and relaxing. (And even chat with the students.) I lived around there for a year and loved it!   Here's the front door of the place I used to live. The upper floors were owned by a Taiwanese who renovated them and rented them exclusively to foreigners, although I'm not sure if he's still doing it (Been a couple years since I left, and I don't have his contact info anymore.) We had a nice rooftop patio too. About the only issue was that the apartments were small, and the walls were thin, but if you can handle that it wasn't a bad place to live."

We also know that the term 老外 is used only to refer to white people, sometimes black and brown people but never other Asians.

This is no surprise, as the going price in the states is $399, or NT$12,350. What they will do is bundle in a second controller for NT$1500 (compared to $60 or NT$1850 from the states), and a game of your choice for NT$1000 (usually a NT$1300-1700 value). If you ask, usually they'll bundle in a second game for that price too (I didn't test my luck on a third game). Best of luck!"

taiwan,3b5m7u,Big_Dave_TW,2,Fri Jun 26 08:14:02 2015 UTC,"One thing to watch out for. Although the consoles are not region locked, there is something to watch out for with the DLC.  My family bought me BF4 from the UK as a present and sent it over. It worked fine on my Taiwanese PS4.   When I wanted to buy the DLC for it, I purchased it from the PSN store. My PSN account is Taiwanese given that I live here and want to pay in local currency. PSN allowed me to purchase the DLC but would not install after downloading.    So even though games from other regions will play, I think the DLC purchase needs to match the origin of the game....I.e UK game needs UK DLC (which I cannot purchase on a Taiwanese account)  So when you buy, watch out for this when selecting your games."
taiwan,3b5m7u,CaptainFormosa,3,Fri Jun 26 05:26:42 2015 UTC,"To clarify, it isn't the console that is region locked! It's your psn accounts with your corresponding game.   Playstations are very good with region locking (wii and nds on the other hand is always region locked). Both the Playstations 3 and the Playstation 4 are region free. It doesn't matter where you buy the console, you can buy games from region and it will work.   When you sign up for a Playstation network account, however, that is when you are restricted to the content/dlc of THAT region. For example, I bought Witcher 3 in Taiwan,but my PSN is an American account, therefore, I had to create a Taiwanese PSN in order for download dlc that will work with my copy of Witcher 3.   Luckily, on the Playstation, you can create multiple PSN from all different region, that works with different currencies.   For an expat like myself, I have an American PSN(main), Taiwanese PSN, and a Japanese PSN. I switch accordingly depending on where I bought my game!   Hope this helps :)"

I get mileage for every purchase. I get cash back in places like Muji. I get huge discounts at fine restaurants. I make a ton of credit and points just by making purchases for other people in exchange for cash since so many people don't have credit cards in Taiwan.  Credit Cards are awesome in Taiwan."

taiwan,3b67cx,inthecahoots,5,Fri Jun 26 19:09:55 2015 UTC,"Ubers in Taipei are relatively scarce compared to cities in the states from what I've seen and taxi prices here are low enough that calling an Uber isn't really worth the waiting time and effort.  If you're scared of sus drivers at night just look for recognized taxi companies like 台灣大車隊, but from my experience, most Taiwanese drivers are pretty friendly."
taiwan,3b67cx,Brownfacedog,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:32:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this. I tried using it once and ""wait time was off the charts!"" I've been able to get a cab within 30 seconds everywhere I go for the last 2 weeks, and even across town it's like NT200 or less."
taiwan,3b67cx,HolySwagg,2,Mon Jun 29 22:31:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, not as convenient as regular taxi or MRT due to wait time.  Much easier to just hail a cab off the road.  Speed - go with taxi  Service/ overall package - go with Uber."
taiwan,3b67cx,PNR_Robots,2,Fri Jun 26 09:50:16 2015 UTC,"YES! I've used it so many times and my older sister, who lives there, uses it as often as taxis. It's pretty awesome, but sometimes inconvenient if you are in a rush. I'd use it when I was coming back from a late night outing, or when it was with my grandparents, because they  liked how nice the cars were. I also can't stand that some people suck on betel nuts, so I'm more drawn to Uber in that way, as well."
taiwan,3b67cx,violentlyshy,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:09:31 2015 UTC,"Uber Pros: Uber X is cheaper for longer distances, good if you're in a strange/barren part of town at 3am, cars will be much nicer and cleaner. No confusion on where you're going to. There is actually more demand and more Uber taxis now than before so some people think its ""scarcity"" but it's actually not. Uber Black and some Uber X often come with free water and phone charging.  Uber Cons: Waiting time can be anywhere from 2 minutes to 15, Uber Black is more expensive (though Uber X is cheaper), sometimes there is elevated charges during hot hours (they inform you when it's dropped though).  Cab Pros: Available almost anywhere. Some will take MRT cards if they have the logo. You can be certain to get the bigger yellow taxis if you need to move some items. No phone charging, no free water.  Cab Cons: A little more expensive than Uber X. It's often not clean, sometimes you end up with a dirty or smelly taxi. Service is not guaranteed that you may be taken for a ride via the cabbie taking a longer route or driving super slowly. Sometimes cabs are really in bad shape and not actually the certified licensed driver (cabbies in Taiwan often lend their cabs to their brother or son to make more money at more hours)."

taiwan,3b5k5h,freeple,2,Fri Jun 26 03:54:40 2015 UTC,"In addition to your options from Matsu, a lot of businessmen and tourists take the connecting ferry (小三通) between Xiamen and Kinmen that runs every half hour for most of the day, and take a plane between Kinmen and Taiwan.   From the Xiamen side, you buy tickets and board the ferries at 五通碼頭 (Wutong 五通客运码头). You're allowed to reserve seats (I couldn't find a website for that, you'd have to call), but you have to buy tickets on the spot which sort of defeats the purpose. Given that there's a ferry every half an hour, I don't think you'll have an issue with not getting on board.  Here's a blog post that provides some contact information to the operating ferry companies at the bottom."

If it's good, then Taiwan is your oyster. If not, I'd probably recommend contacting a local Sinopac. My friend invests mostly in international bonds through the Bank Of Kaohsiung.   To be honest, Taiwan can be a fantastic place to do investments, primarily because there is much more availability of international markets and the capital gains tax on certain things is insanely low. I'd actually say it's a better place than the U.S., but much more freewheeling and unregulated in some ways. Buyer beware. Best of luck!"

taiwan,3b1nq3,Karmayana,2,Fri Jun 26 01:02:06 2015 UTC,That's not entirely true. There are forms you can file in the U.S. that avoid double taxation in such an event. Typically you never pay more than the maximum of the two. For example if you would be required to pay 15% under American law and 10% under Taiwanese law you would pay the 10% in Taiwan and then 5% in America (after you filed appropriately). Obviously this is a gross simplification but in practice your overall tax burden should not (theoretically) increase beyond what you would normally pay. YMMV.

taiwan,3b1kyh,poorman99,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:27:07 2015 UTC,"You can blame the monopoly for CHT/Hinet. In Taiwan, no matter how the inbound/outbound traffic distributes, if you want to peer with CHT, which is the biggest ISP for consumers, you have to pay them. In a more competitive market, usually the cost is divided based on the inflow of the traffic (if more users on my side want to see the content on your side, I will share more cost).  The monopoly is kind of hard to break, because no business wants to host their website in a slower network to the consumer, so the top choice for business internet is Hinet. Even if someone takes the courage to host in other networks, the peering network is so congested that your customers using Hinet won't have a good experience."
taiwan,3b1kyh,loserkids,2,Thu Jun 25 20:09:00 2015 UTC,Your best bet is to go to Singapore. You can get amazon's AWS for free for the first year. It runs great and their customer support is probably best in the world.

taiwan,3b1kyh,poorman99,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:35:52 2015 UTC,I don't think that price is possible in Taiwan. Usually the providers in Taiwan are more expensive. Most people end up using providers in Japan or Singapore. Linode's data center in Japan could be one good option for $10/month.

taiwan,3b1u07,dajackal,2,Thu Jun 25 22:23:50 2015 UTC,"haha dont get me wrong i love bian dang too, i was just using Friday as an example. but literally eating bian dang 2 times a day for 5 years eventually you get kinda sick of it D:"
taiwan,3b1u07,Luomulanren,3,Fri Jun 26 04:53:24 2015 UTC,"but i think the major disadvantage for me is that because your considered Taiwanese, people treat you like local people and expect you to understand the taiwanese culture even if your still use to western culture.   That's the characteristic of the Chinese culture being an inclusive culture. The upside is that you will be treated as ""one of us"" instead of an outsider.  But in any case, if you choose to live in Taiwan, you SHOULD adapt to Taiwanese culture no different than if a Taiwanese choose to live in the US, he or she should adapt to the American culture.    I find it that elders tend to find it offensive if they think your not putting any effort trying to blend into their culture.   And why shouldn't they? Even Americans find it offensive when immigrants don't ""act American"" even though they don't consider them ""one of them"".   Personally, its difficult for me not to be judged by certain things e.g once in a while i like to enjoy a decent meal maybe like Friday's (apparently considered to be a expensive meal according to my local friends) isntead of the local bian dang (which i eat almost everyday), my girlfriends parents think I'm wasting money and ask ""why are you eating such expensive food,"" I grew up in Australia and back when i was still in Australia, its normal to hang out with friends eating a decent meal once in a while.   Whether Friday's is considered expensive or not, it exists and is profitable in Taiwan for a reason, because many Taiwanese eat there. So I think your problem is more ""universal"" than you may think, which is people not minding their own business. If your girlfriend's parents choose to live a lifestyle where they never enjoy anything, that's their business, they shouldn't force that on you.  I can tell you right now, not indulging is definitely not ""the local way"". You can tell just by looking around at the kind of shops and restaurants there are.   even though i lived in taiwan for 5 years, i still find it difficult to think locally.   I can't speak for Australia, but here in the US, there are plenty of immigrants who have lived here all their lives but still find it difficult, if not impossible, to think the American way."

I have a Taiwanese number now, I'm going overseas (to Europe) without an international plan, so I was wondering if there was a way to use e-mail to send SMS to a dumbphone (Taiwan#) or an app that can send SMS via WiFi.   I have found apps that provide numbers to use but they're all US numbers. I have found some apps like Roamer, Maxis, and a couple others that utilize my existing number but either have less than stellar reviews or cannot be used to their full capabilities because Taiwan isn't a (fully) supported country.* I've yet to find one that provides another Taiwanese one to use.   If the other party had a smartphone there would be no issues because I could just use Line. However, because they have a dumbphone I can only communicate through SMS and phone calls. :<  *Like I can send via my number with Roamer but not receive.   I'm not opposed to spending money, I'd like to find an alternative before just going to add international roaming to my plan."

taiwan,3axquw,st0815,3,Wed Jun 24 11:24:08 2015 UTC,"So basically there are four ways you can do it:   Become a citizen of another nation, go in through an investment visa or a work visa Be married to an ROC national, and after many years of limbo, you will be able to get an ROC identity, which will allow you to get a job just like any other Taiwanese. Be a high performing high skilled labor, and be hired by a giant Taiwanese corporation that would be able to sponsor you through the process. Your application for a job visa would need to be approved on a case-by-case basis, and is very hard. Be an accomplished academic in some in-demand field in Taiwan, and you can be invited as a visiting professor (or scholar) to Taiwanese universities.    As you can see, it's very very hard unless you're very capable.   EDIT: An addendum to 4 is if you're doing some kind of (non-sensitive) research which can only be done in Taiwan and you have an established plan, you'd be granted as a exchange researcher to Taiwan. I've met mainland grad students who are in Taiwan researching Republican history, and another doing art history research in which she needed access to Palace Museum.

taiwan,3axdts,JillyPolla,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:17:15 2015 UTC,"They fought for the ROC, not Taiwan. You mean a lot of them were forcibly drafted to fight in a civil war.  And quite a few of them killed a lot of Taiwanese people, randomly, on the streets based on their hate for the Japanese or anyone rumored to be a former member of the Imperial army. Make no mistake, they are only getting recognized by the PRC for the ""Hate the Japanese people even today"" part.  Yeah they certainly were ""fighting for the people of Taiwan"" when they fired dum dum bullets in roving bands around Taiwan or held kids hostage at school or tied together lots of Taiwanese civilians and executed them en-masse.  If we simply overlook about 50+ years of Taiwan history, then yeah, maybe we can then begin to make a flimsy argument that they fought for the people of Taiwan, somehow."
taiwan,3axdts,ShrimpCrackers,-2,Thu Jun 25 06:47:12 2015 UTC,So you saying those who fought in Quemoy and Matsu weren't fighting for the Taiwanese?  These mainland soldiers formed the core of army that prevented Taiwan from being taken over by PRC.
taiwan,3axdts,JillyPolla,3,Thu Jun 25 13:33:55 2015 UTC,"They got pummeled and it was the USA that stopped the PRC.  Also, do a survey of those in Quemoy and Matsu, and the vast majority can't wait for annexation, they're just fighting for the ROC, not the Taiwanese. There's a difference."
taiwan,3axdts,ShrimpCrackers,-1,Thu Jun 25 15:15:42 2015 UTC,"I love this fantasy straw man world that you live in where if you're not for immediate independence, you want annexation by the PRC.

taiwan,3axdts,JillyPolla,3,Thu Jun 25 15:44:33 2015 UTC,"So you agree that it was the US and not our soldiers huddled in bunkers that really defended Matzu and Kinmen. Great. You also acknowledge those aren't the guys being honored here. Great. So it's just a giant red herring you've presented here.  My point is, the people being honored, have done absolutely nothing to defend the people of Taiwan. In fact, many ROC soldiers of their era have done GREAT HARM, including MASS MURDER towards the Taiwanese people.  PS: To be honest, we should return Matzu and Kinmen to the PRC. The only reason we're hanging on to them is kind of silly."
taiwan,3axdts,ShrimpCrackers,-1,Thu Jun 25 15:53:51 2015 UTC,"No, I don't agree with those. The people being honored here also fought on quemoy and matsu. That was a common army posting back in those days. The US were nowhere to be found during Kuningtou.   Giving the outlying islands back to China would be a big betrayal of those people who live there. None of them want to be annexed by PRC. For somebody who support self determination for Taiwanese, you seem to be very against the self determination of the citizens on the outlying islands. The problem with independence supporters like you is that they don't consider the collateral damage of others I their mindless pursuit of independence.   And I love how you just outright ignored atrocities committed by the Taiwanese people against mainland residents, government workers, and other Taiwanese people. Those same Taiwanese who set up their own guerrilla to kill, and ended up running off to PRC for protection."

taiwan,3atj2j,chugopunk,12,Tue Jun 23 11:43:00 2015 UTC,"Well, the thing that helped me most in learning the characters is using the Heisig book, ""Remembering Traditional Hanzi."" That book focuses on learning the characters first  with just an English meaning and learning the Chinese pronunciation later. When you finish the first book you'll know how to write 1500 characters and a basic meaning in English, giving you the same advantage that the Japanese have when learning Chinese.   The main draw of the book is the order in which you learn the characters. Instead of learning 我，你，得，的(in order of frequency), you'll learn in order of complexity, which is much more efficient. For example: 青，請，清，情... When you finish the book you can look at the characters the same way that native speakers do, as simply two components combined.  Even if you decide not to use Heisig, I highly recommend using Anki, a spaced-repetition software. It'll help you remember everything SOOOOOO much more efficiently. Simply enter the example sentences from your textbook (characters only) into the front, and use mdbg.net to put the pronunciation/meaning on the back. For extra awesomeness, there's a plugin for Anki called AwesomeTTS (text-to-speech) which can read aloud the sentences that you type in.   Good luck!"

I know that you can order them off Amazon pretty easily. If you're in China or Taiwan, I don't think you'll find those books in a bookstore.

I got here by getting over the initial stumbling blocks with the best motivation -- grades. I majored in Chinese and moved to Taiwan with a wonky-at-best grasp on the language.  What really catapulted me forward was putting myself in situations where Chinese wasn't the end goal, but a tool to get there. I worked in an office and then in news for several years, as well as doing grad school in Chinese, so it was sort of ""sink or swim"" -- be able to keep up with local coworkers and classmates or face failure.   I supplemented that with a healthy dose of pop culture. Tons of wuxia movies and novels, music videos and KTV, magazines and TV news, and so on.  Working in translation also helped. As one of my teachers said, ""translation is the most intimate form of readership"" (翻譯是最親密的閱讀行為). You have to truly grasp the underlying principles of the language to render an effective translation.  Oh, also it was probably pretty beneficial that all but two or three of my friends for the past several years are native speakers of Chinese...  Best of luck!    Edit: PS, for a timeline, I was shakily conversational after graduating college but could read a lot. After three years in Taiwan I was functional in an all-chinese work environment. After 6 years or so -- a full 10 years since starting in college -- I am fluent enough to translate and interpret E>C.

I don't know if there's something as useful as the NY Times Best Seller list, though.   Also, I second the 古龍 recommendation. He's like 金庸 but more pulp-fiction-like, if that makes sense."

taiwan,3atj2j,Wanrenmi,3,Wed Jun 24 17:22:33 2015 UTC,"My best advice to you is to try everything but don't hold yourself to other peoples' standards. What works for them might not work for you. But what doesn't work for them might work for you.   For me, I have to keep mixing it up. One week I'll be on some Chinese drama, the next week I'll be memorizing songs and another week I'll find some website that keeps my interest. I have a bit of study ADD so I have to constantly find sources to keep my mind engaged."

taiwan,3atj2j,vigernere1,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:51:48 2015 UTC,"BuT you might Be able To find the MP3s in other places on the internet   lol. AFAIK, in its early years ChinesePod freely released their podcasts online, and so it's legal to download those episodes.   it's going to be a while before you're able to watch and understand TV shows if you've only been studying for a month   I completely agree. I would recommend that OP watch cartoons aimed at young children. It might feel silly watching them, but doing so will be far more effective than trying to decipher what's being said in a drama or on a news channel.  OP, I saw some kids watching a cartoon version of the LINE characters and it look amusing. Perhaps you can find episodes online."
taiwan,3atj2j,falloutgoy,5,Wed Jun 24 04:16:09 2015 UTC,"Check out www.chinese-forums.com if you haven't already. There's a lot of great information on that site. Other helpful learning tools:   Pleco (including flashcard functionality) Anki (some prefer using Anki in lieu of Pleco flashcards) Skritter HelloTalk AllSet Chinese Grammar Wiki 宝贝听听 蜻蜓FM收音机   I never used Skritter because I found the monthly/yearly pricing to be much too high. The Anki desktop app is free, but it costs ~$25 to use on a mobile device, which is the main reason why I never used it (Pleco flashcards work perfectly fine for me). HelloTalk is a language exchange app that supports both type- and voice-based chat. 宝贝听听 is a story app for children (i.e., bedtime stories, etc. The interface is in simplified Chinese, but you can figure it out easily enough just by looking at the app's icons). 蜻蜓FM收音机 is a pretty good radio app, which sources most/all of its channels from mainland China.   You mentioned that you were in a class, so presumably you have to write Chinese on paper, which actually - at least in the beginning - is a great way to reinforce the characters in your mind. At this point I almost never write using a pen and paper, but I'm glad I did when I first learned Chinese.  Edit: I think everyone in this thread knows this, but no one has explicitly stated it: the best way to learn and retain characters is to use flashcards, and specifically use a spaced repetition flashcard program (i.e., either Pleco or Anki).  Edit 2: if you are studying in Taiwan, one question that comes up is whether to learn bopomofo (注音). In short, you certainly do not have to learn bopomofo, even if studying in Taiwan. However, I did find knowing bopomofo helpful when reading material written for children and young adolescents, as those materials often had bopomofo alongside the Chinese characters. To learn bopomofo, I found some courses on Memrise (note: some of the bopomofo courses on Memrise contain small errors), and I started to use the bopomofo input method on my mobile phone when chatting (that said, I still type much, much slower using bopomofo as compared to pinyin, so when I need to respond quickly, or if I am having a long conversation, I will type in pinyin). Speaking of input methods: I recommend trying Google Pinyin (Android), or the Baidu or Sogou input methods (iPhone/Android). (Baidu/Sogou are from China, so you have to set them to output traditional characters). Baidu/Sogou are also available as input methods on PCs and Macs."

Not that I plan to buy the iOS version, of course..."

taiwan,3atj2j,HarveyHound,2,Wed Jun 24 08:20:47 2015 UTC,"If you're studying in a local language center, you can try out Providence Chinese which provides flashcards, character stroke order and exercises for the PAVC book series that they use.   It's a great way to catch up with other members of your class, as you can focus on the skills you need to develop.  For me personally, I really liked the Pimsleur system when I first got started, although that focused just on the basics and on listening and was very Beijing centric.  CLO takes that progressive concept further with more lessons and reading tools, and also uses Taiwanese speakers."
taiwan,3atj2j,vigernere1,4,Wed Jun 24 00:47:56 2015 UTC,"exercises for the PAVC book series that they use.   Just an FYI, the MTC published a new set of books that replaced the PAVC books. I believe the series is called ""A Contemporary Course in Chinese"" or something similar.  Edit: oh, also I used CLO when I first started learning Chinese, and I thought it was helpful (I think I bought the full package). What I liked about CLO was that, different from ChinesePod, each lesson was designed to build upon previous lessons, and incorporated prior vocabulary and grammar in a ""building block"" approach. If I recall correctly, each ChinesePod podcast is topic-specific and doesn't assume you listened to any previous episode (this approach also has its advantages, perhaps more so for non-beginners)."
taiwan,3atj2j,HarveyHound,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:00:01 2015 UTC,Thanks - do you have any feedback on the new book series? The old ones were quite dated.
taiwan,3atj2j,vigernere1,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:31:26 2015 UTC,"I browsed through the first book in the series, and overall it seemed like a solid update. As far as I can tell, each book glosses roughly the same number of vocabulary and grammar terms as the old books. In the first book, each chapter has two dialogs instead of one, and the pinyin for each dialog is written above the Chinese characters (this is a good or bad thing, depending on your perspective. In the old books, the dialog was written in pinyin separate from the Chinese characters).  I saw a copy of the book from last quarter and was disappointed with the layout/design, but apparently it was an interim version while they were finishing the final layout. I saw the updated layout and it looks professional. The illustrations look like those in the books published by LiveABC, which are always well done.  There is an accompanying workbook, character workbook, and audio CDs. I workbook and character workbook both looked solid; I didn't listen to any of the audio. Sadly, there is no accompanying videos, so you won't get to follow the life of 高偉立 as with the old PAVC books.   P.S. I have to say, I agree that the PAVC books were outdated. That said, if you set aside the dated layout and lack of modern term (i.e., Internet, etc.), I didn't think they were that bad. I feel like they did a good job (along with a lot of supplemental self study) creating a solid foundation of Chinese."
taiwan,3atj2j,himit,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:34:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the update - I'll take a look.  I went through the first 4 books of PAVC and learned a lot from them. However if I recall correctly, after the first few lessons of book 5, there was suddenly a huge increase in difficulty, with lots of words and phrases that weren't taught before.  I asked someone why this was the case, and they said that the teacher assigned to book 5 was different from the ones assigned to the earlier books.  Hopefully those types of issues are resolved in the new series."
taiwan,3atj2j,falloutgoy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:10:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah I never quite got around to Book 5, although keep meaning to. I don't feel too bad about that, since I've kept myself occupied with many other books.  In this post over at www.chinese-forums.com, there's a nice list of supplemental study materials. Some are a bit boring and/or dated (Thought and Society, The Independent Reader), but overall I've found value in many of them."
taiwan,3atj2j,Wanrenmi,2,Wed Jun 24 06:57:51 2015 UTC,"Copying what other people said, for speaking.  I see too many foreigners say something wrong, have the native speaker repeat the 'correct' sentence, and then say 'Yeah, that's what I said! wrong sentence'.  Copy what you hear, however strange it sounds to your foreign ears.  It's a foreign language, it'll sound strange until you internalise it.  With characters... just writing all the damn time.  Copying out song lyrics over and over and over was my thing before, but you could always grab some of the elementary school teaching books and copy each character out 50 times like the kids have to.  The more you write them the more you internalise the system behind it... I found this much easier than trying to wrap my head around 'Well, this part means this and that parts means that and that makes the whole character mean... bacon?""  Characters make much more sense once you already understand them and the language, unfortunately :S"

Maybe write it 3 times, then combine it with another word or sentence."

taiwan,3arziz,JillyPolla,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:04:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks to Hung Hsiu-chu's hardcore unification positions, this upcoming election will likely become a proxy referendum between maintaining the nation of Taiwan's de-facto independence VS. unification (whether it be immediate or even in the future). A KMT defeat in 2016 will likely eliminate the unification issue for the foreseeable future. No politician will dare approach it ever again.  Hung's recent praises of the Communist M503 flight route as ""making Taiwan safer"", her comments that China's missiles aimed at Taiwan as ""no big deal"", her complete disregard of America's importance to Taiwan's security, as well as her urgent desire for the signing of political agreements between the two countries....they are all completely contrary to the mainstream Taiwan consensus.  Your KMT candidate is going to be completely destroyed on Election Day, and her insane rhetoric will likely doom her fellow legislative candidates as well."
taiwan,3arziz,FormosaNation,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:41:03 2015 UTC,"You're acting like she wants to be part of Taiwan SAR, but failed to address my point that she is the candidate that's challenging Beijing for recognition. Hung is more anti communist than the other candidates. Tsai is a fuerdai, and her family hand extensive business dealings on the mainland. Hung on the other hand refuses campaign contributions from the big money interests.   It's ironic that DPP supporters are actually supporting a privileged princessling who are soft on communist and addled with big money."
taiwan,3arziz,JillyPolla,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:20:39 2015 UTC,"In Hung's recent interview with pro-Beijing media from China, she reiterated her stance that she believes the continued maintenance of the status quo is untenable as it would lead to the inevitable conclusion of independence... Hence her belief that the KMT's so-called ""1992 Consensus"" has served its purpose and a new ""One China, Same Interpretation"" must arise to prevent Taiwan independence and resolve the Taiwan/China divide as soon as possible.  Yes, I do believe she vehemently wants Taiwan to be part of China. Because the trend over the decades in Taiwan has been towards a stronger pro-Taiwanese identity and towards an emerging consensus for independence, Hung Hsiu-chu is alarmed and sees the need for political actions that stem this tide. She never acknowledges the Taiwanese people's inherent democratic right to make this self determination for themselves.   If Hung goes on and is finally confirmed as the KMT candidate, not only will the Kuomingtang lose the Presidential and Legislative Elections in a massive landslide, this will ultimately destroy the KMT due to the party's ideological shift towards the New Party's extremist right."

Her one China same interpretation means there are two constitutional governments inside the entire China. As opposed to now, where both side recognize only one constitutional authority. You're acting like she thinks Taiwan should be part of PRC, but your misrepresenting her ideas.

And yes there are tons of scammers. At least from what I experienced on Taiwan's renting website www.591.com.tw (It is in Chinese, but you can google translate the page) where most young people here use to rent a room.  It is either trying to sell you expensive electricity, gas or water. There are even people posting Free wifi and when you go and check the room, they will tell you ""it is not free, what you saw was an error""... Also adding some cleaning service 800 NTD a month. Then when you rent it you will realize you actually have to clean it by yourself with 5 other students who don't give a bull about being dirty. After all those kind of charges you'll suddenly find that you are above 10k from 7k. Because they know foreigners are in need of a room and you have no other choice but to rent it! Remember 1kW electricity is never above 5 NTD and make sure your contract is real, most are not.  So be careful, don't get stripped ;)  EDIT: Go to facebook and search Taiwan apartment, there are foreigners/taiwanese renting out."

I would say 95% of the apartments listed have internet connection included in the rent, but very few have WIFI (You need a router for that). I don't know why this is brought up.   All the things you mentioned can be easily prevented through a proper contract, all the contracts I've seen are the same format, I think they are sold in book stores or 7-11.  There is no such thing as a fake contract, it doesn't matter if it's a tissue paper or a napkin, if both of you agree on the terms written on it and then sign it, it is a proper contact and has legal effect.       tl;dr: There is a chance that you will get scammed, but definitely lower than what /LOLAHAHS seems to suggest."

You can't do shit because the landlord never sent the contract to the tax agency.   Well most people don't know if the contract is proper or not.  Out of 8 times coming back to Taiwan to rent a short term apartment 3 months, 5 times some granny would come up with excuses why they have to rise the price."
taiwan,3ampvz,milkman_jimmy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:43:36 2015 UTC,"I think you have no idea what you are talking about. It has nothing to do with tax agencies and if your landlord increases your price 5 out of 8 times (which I doubt it really did happen) and you did nothing about it, then it is your problem.    A contract would have 2 copies (both signed by both parties), you get to keep the contract aswell. If you are really worried about the contract you can find a notary party to be present. If shit happens, you simply take your contract, buy a legal attest letter in book stores, write it down and give it to your landlord. If she does not comply then you would go to Sunday courts and sue him/her (Or you simply go to the police station and they will help you with everything else).  There are multiple civil laws that prevent you from being scammed and I seriously doubt landlords are interested in scamming you a few thousand NTD's while risking so much more. I'm sure there are shitty landlords, but just ask anyone who lives in Taiwan regardless of local or foreign resident, the general consensus is that there isn't a lot of issues renting houses in Taiwan. So no, there aren't ""tons of scammers"" and this is a misguided and misinformed information that could serve negatively for people who are really interested in searching apartments through 591.com.tw"

The KMT is arguably more realistic with their plan to foster tight ties to China, as it seems that's where everyone is making money nowadays.  The DPP wants to return to the 1970s where the US is giving away money/aid/industry/trade to Taiwan in order to keep it out of communist hands."

Same goes for Taiwan Mobile (the ""da-ge-da"" you mentioned), FarEastone and GT.

So basically, as I mentioned previously, Taiwan telecoms are phasing out 2G networks in favor of transferring that bandwidth to 4G LTE. For those who they are contractually obliged to provide 2G service (i.e., those who they have a contract in place), 2G network is indeed still available, but the telecoms are pushing hard for these people to move over to 3G/4G contracts, and I believe all recent contracts have dropped 2G capability, and now provide just 4G+3G or 3G only options.

Legitimately interested in your thoughts - thanks!
taiwan,3ajepf,Tyberos,4,Sun Jun 21 10:27:02 2015 UTC,"Does the program at MTC generally attract undesirable people   If you haven't already, you should read this thread about the MTC at www.chinese-forums.com. The first post is from 2011 and the most recent is from 2015. It provides a number of first-hand, detailed accounts from people who attended the  MTC. The posts are fairly balanced, listing both the good and the bad about the program.  As others have noted, there are - by far- more Japanese and Korean students studying at the MTC than any other nationality. There's a healthy representation of students from Latin America (i.e., especially from countries that recognize Taiwan, and thus Taiwan offers scholarships to students from those countries). I'd say there are more European students than American students at the MTC. Regardless of nationality, there are always students who don't take their studies seriously. By and large, I'd say most of the students at the MTC are diligent and focused. If for some reason you end up in a class where your fellow students are unfocused or slacking off, then just transfer into a different class (there is a transfer period at the beginning of each quarter). Next to having a bad teacher (of which there aren't many at MTC; mostly it's a question of whether you like their teaching style or not, but all seem to be sincere and take their job seriously), the worst is sitting in a class with other students who aren't focused and who slack off (Actually, after 2-3 weeks many of those students stop showing up to class, or show up infrequently, so you may end up with just ~4 students regularly attending, and thus you will receive a lot of one-on-one attention from the teacher. Not bad!)  Good luck!"

I think I paid 10,000 for 13 weeks, 4 hours a week if I recall correctly. I suppose it's better than independent studies. Also time is super flexible.    Changed to Fengjia, it's great.

The staff told me to try schools in Taipei since more foreigners are there and there's more schools there. I already could speak basic chinese but couldn't read at all.

If it's a monthly salary, you make enough to have eat decent during the week and go out on the weekends. Young locals rarely cook at home.. it's all about eating out. You will know what I mean when you get there.   Kaohsiung and the country as a whole are both very safe, the only things you need to watch out are drunk drivers and crazy scooters. Taiwan (Taipei especially) is known as the ""gaysia,"" capital of Asia. It also has the best pride parade in the region. Most ppl are very open minded and won't give a ____ about it. You will find more night clubs in Taipei, but still plenty to keep you busy in Kaohsiung.   Young Taiwanese will know that Mexico is a country south of the US and think ""burrito"" and guacamole is from there, but I doubt they can name a single historic figure.   There are lots of Youtube channels out for expats living in Kaohsiung, have a look and try to see if you can picture yourself there.   Lots of good stuff here too. http://kaohsiungliving.org/"

The pay-for-what-you-get type of buffet is also popular, and can run from NT$45 to NT$200 for a lunch.  The place I go to seems to decide randomly on how much to charge depending on which person is being cashier that day.  One old lady always nails me for 200, fatty charges me 150-ish;  I think the twenty-something chick has the hots for me 'cause she's usually around 120."

taiwan,3ah0f1,keyilan,2,Sat Jun 20 05:44:13 2015 UTC,I've gotten a ticket from a camera in Miaoli. That's the only time I've gotten a speeding ticket. I was going maybe 60 as I was approaching a town with a slower limit and I guess I didn't slow down quick enough.  It was about NT$1200 but it got mailed to the wrong address so by the time I figured it out there was an extra fine and I ended up paying maybe $1400.  It wasn't a lot but I would still rather have no had to pay it.
taiwan,3ah0f1,Get9,3,Sat Jun 20 09:23:24 2015 UTC,"Well, they can either give you a ticket personally (as in, an officer caught you) or you can be mailed a ticket (if a camera catches you). If you experience the latter, but have neglected to update your address, you may not know you have tickets at all.   Speeding tickets seem to just accumulate with the occasional increase for lack of payment.  I've received tickets and not known about them until years later. I also have a Taiwanese in-law that has many, many, many tickets that just sit there (he's not going to pay them, the bastard), so it doesn't seem there is anything like a three-strikes law.  I am not a lawyer and this is all anecdotal, however."

taiwan,3ah0f1,Get9,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:08:48 2015 UTC,"what's the procedure to do that?   Well, if you live in Taipei City or New Taipei City, you can go to the Taipei City Motor Vehicle Supervision Office at 臺北市士林區承德路80號 (No. 80, Chengde Rd., Shilin Dist., Taipei City). Otherwise, you can go to wherever you took your test and talk to the people there about having your address updated. I usually update my address at a testing center in Banciao, though I don't know the name or location off-hand.   Also, how do you check?   Go to the Motor Vehicle Driver Information Service website and select ""inquiry."" Then, select ""Fine payment for traffic violation."" You should then be able to type in you ARC number and birth date, which should result in your desired information. I input my ID and birth date, as well as the ID and birth date of two other people I know (I asked), and they all came up with a pop-up that said No Data! I'm not sure if that means the three of us have no tickets (well, we don't) or if there's something wrong.  I believe you can also check tickets at 7-11s by using the ibon kiosk. I can't remember the exact procedure right now, but if you ask a clerk there, they'll usually be able to assist. You just type in your license plate number."

Remember to put in your old and new regions for your registration because it could be in either.  I was surprised to find out that I had 3,600NT in tickets.

You should be able to find a hob/stovetop kettle and any of the ""knick-knack/hardware"" type stores scattered throughout Taipei. Failing that, you certain can find one at Ikea. If you are looking for an electric kettle, like ones used in the UK/Europe, you'll need to visit an appliance store. I'm not sure if they will stock that kind of electric kettle; hot water dispensers are much more common/popular in Taiwan.  As for a grinder, www.beecoffee.com.tw sales a wide range of coffee making equipment. I bought a 2-cup Hario burr hand grinder there (it's a fantastic grinder, but if you drink >3 cups of coffee a day, grinding the beans by hand might get tedious). Bee Coffee probably sells hob/stovetop and electric kettles there too, although I don't recall specifically. I'm sure they sell drip coffee makers. (I use a press pot (aka French press) for making coffee. I bought one at Ikea (~$300  if I recall correctly) which has served me perfectly well).   There is a coffee equipment shop in the ShiDa night market. It's at the extreme end of the market closest to Heping Road. I've never been in it, but I've walked by it many times and it seemed reasonably well stocked.  Lastly, many of the independent coffee shops around Taipei sell coffee making equipment, although probably at premium prices."

I bought my electric grinder (which was able to produce okay grinds for pour-overs, but not espressos) there for 2400NT. Hand grinders, which Hario also makes, you should be able to find one for below 1000NT. I used to frequent the one in Xindian (when I did pour-overs) for their beans, which were decently priced for what they are, if you sign up for their VIP program (which gets you a buy 2 get 1 free discount, and you can prepay for beans for pick up as you use them up).

When it comes to Taiwan history, you need to be able to read Japanese, Portuguese, Dutch, and English as well. At least that's the way it goes in the history departments of NTU and NTNU. The records kept by the Japanese far exceed anything else because they not only kept records on vast amounts of data concerning everything from parasitical infections to military volunteerism, but also the United States would take that data and make their own inferences, especially in anticipation of War and the long term consequences of US occupation and control over Taiwan. Yes, before CKS demanded Taiwan, the USA had huge lengthy plans for a governorship of Taiwan that's well detailed. This latter part is heavily inconvenient for certain people and they like to discuss it as little as possible since it opens the possibility of a 228-less and White Terrorless Taiwan ."

Since the patent expired, we now have a variety of generic brands. I've been on a low dose maintenance program for some time now. I've gone through several generic brands. It just depends on the pharmacy, and what they have in stock, however, it all works the same. My current brand is called Zenatane. I brought a bunch when I came to Taiwan, and I actually just received a package with a few extra from my parents.   As far as getting prescribed the medication here in Taiwan, my opinion is that it will be harder in the Taiwan than the US. I'm sure if you have resolved to Isotretinoin Capsules, you must know that even dermatologists in the US only use it as a last resort. In the US, if your MD prescribes this medication to you, you must also register with some program connected to the medication. The program is just reading material about the cautions and dangers that may happen while on the med. The biggest thing is for females and getting pregnant. I remember my old actual Accutane packets, which contained 10 pills in a blister package, and the back of each pill, there was a picture of an alien baby. The picture now is just a picture of a pregnant female, and a do not cross symbol. Anyways, my point is that they are pretty serious about this medication in the US. Oh, I forgot to add that you a required by your MD to get blood tests every month.   In my opinion, Taiwan MD's are a little more reserved on Western medicine. I don't know any MD's or even a dermatologist here, but I did have to make a visit to the local hospital for something. Can you give us a little more background on your case, so that we can help you with more specific info?"

taiwan,3aaae8,MischaG,6,Thu Jun 18 13:56:05 2015 UTC,"There are two cultural differences (that I can think of) that make a direct translation very difficult. First of all, instead of serving individually, Chinese traditions is to eat round a large table, and share dishes. That makes to notion of ""enjoy your meal"" rather odd, since everyone is having the same meal. Secondly, an elder or senior or host of the table is supposed to eat first from a dish   (and juniors last), so at the beginning of a meal, when everyone is properly seated and ready, the host/senior would signal the start by saying something akin to ""Dig in!"".  That's what the ""Jiah Bong"" really means. It's similar because it is also used before meal start, but the meaning behind it is very different. It should also be noted that Jiah Bong is used primarily in a family setting, spoken by the elder of the table. Other phrases may be used in a more business setting."

If you're not attending the banquet, maybe even just 1500.    Basically, it comes out to these things, in order of importance:     How expensive the wedding is How close you are to the bride and groom Whether you are attending the banquet or not   Notes:     The price of the wedding sets the base amount, generally the cost of the meal. If you are really close, you might be giving them upwards of 1.5-2x the cost of the meal. If you're like, their boss, then you might be giving them 2-3x the cost of the meal. If attending the banquet, the lowest acceptable amount is the cost of the meal. This is for those who make little money and are not close with the bride and groom. If not attending the banquet AND make little money AND are not close to the bride and groom, you should aim for around 75% of the cost of the meal."

The idea is that you give enough to cover the cost of your food in the wedding, and in Taipei,  most places are going for at least NT20000 for a 12 ppl table. (NT20000 per table is going to be crappy food..so chances are this 5 star hotel will costs more than that) Just know that at most weddings they will open your red envelope and count how much is inside at reception once you arrive.   http://www.cmoney.tw/notes/note-detail.aspx?nid=21211"
taiwan,3a7izo,foggysf,3,Wed Jun 17 22:41:18 2015 UTC,The best way to see how much is acceptable is to google the restaurant and see how much a table is. Then divide that by 10~12 depending on how many people per table. Thats usually the amount you should give. Remember to always give an amount that is an even number. An odd number is considered disrespectful.  If you do not know them that well you can always just give 1000 less than the table since you arent close. Theres really nothing wrong with giving less many people do and they will just remember and give you less when they are invited to your wedding.
taiwan,3a7izo,stoptherage,5,Thu Jun 18 00:35:22 2015 UTC,"1,500 each on the low end. No more than 2,000.   With that said, do not give an envelope with 4,000, that is bad luck. So now you are forced to give either 3,800 or 5,000.  And they do coint it in front of you and people will gossip about who the cheap people were."
taiwan,3a7izo,locdogjr,5,Thu Jun 18 00:26:08 2015 UTC,"4 is bad luck. 8 is usually a lucky number but in the case of wedding it is not the best number because 八 in some Chinese languages (including Taiwanese) sounds like 別 separate. Avoid odd numbers as much as you can, as they are for funerals.    Usually people choose from these numbers (in NT$): 600, 1200, 1600, 2000, 2200, 2600, 3200, 3600, 6000, 6600, 10000, 12000..."

taiwan,3a7izo,locdogjr,2,Thu Jun 18 01:52:41 2015 UTC,This. It depend on who's running the reception table. They might ask you to write your name and amount on the envelope but it's also seem acceptable if they count what's inside as you sign on the guest book.

Don't worry about your reputation. Don't think too much. Only the bride and groom will have a record of who gave how much. The rest is just 5 seconds of gossip and then onto the next victim.

Personally I don't think you need to worry too much whether or not the red envelop could pay off their expense if you give between $1,600 and $3,600, assuming you don't bring 4 kids with you. The couple should not expect to get all the expenses covered by red envelop, though usually it's close to break even because the relatives usually give more."

That's how ridiculously expensive it is. For a hotel or wedding hall in Taipei, I still wouldn't expect much if I knew it was 25k / table. They really jack up the prices for wedding here."

So you're looking at a 120k scooter, minus government subsidies (we don't know how much that is yet) for two years. It comes out to equivalent to an 80k scooter even when we aren't factoring in the government subsidies.  All in all this might be a good thing. Strong Might though. I'm getting one anyway.

That would bring the net cost down to 128 - 30 = 98k, still a lot more than 70k + 12k fuel for 2 years = 82k.  Tesla is a lot more expensive, but its also at parity with similarly-classed luxury vehicles after a few years of ownership given gas/maintenance costs. I don't think people will shell out an extra 26k for a scooter - there really is no such thing as ""luxury"" in this market - so I'm still betting it won't sell well.

You hear about people going to Japan, China, France, Thailand and other countries that have its unique cuisine to learn about fine dining, cooking and baking. You don't hear about people coming here for a ""fine dining experience"" or learn from Taiwanese chefs.   Taiwanese food to me will always be 小吃.

Just enjoy your pineapple cakes and think about the next time you're going back to visit. That's what I do every time I leave with a luggage full of gifted pineapple cakes.  Also make sure you reciprocate gifts and generosity when they visit the US. Oddly enough, my Taiwanese family loves sour gummy worms and request them all the time when they visit.

If you are a local, what shops in Taipei would sell this kind of watch?  Once again thanks all!"
taiwan,3a110y,vigernere1,3,Tue Jun 16 15:00:11 2015 UTC,"www.ruten.com.tw, along with www.pchome.com and yahoo.com.tw is one of the largest on marketplaces in Taiwan. It's equivalent to Amazon Marketplace or eBay, although AFAIK it doesn't offer auctions.  The Taiwanese Garmin website lists a number of major department/electronics stores in Taiwan as resellers, as well as small store resellers of Garmin's hiking/outdoor products and cycling products.  A small independent sports/running store might also carry it. Here's a Google search for exercise equipment stores for Taipei, and here's one for sports equipment. There's a chance that hiking/climbing stores may sell it, and this article talks about a cluster of such stores not too far from Taipei Main Station. Howard's Bike Shop is centrally located in Taipei and sells Garmin products, although according to their website they don't have the Forerunner 225. That said, maybe you can send them an email to verify, and/or ask them to suggest another store that might sell it.  P.S. Honestly the easiest thing to do is to buy the product from Ruten and have it shipped to a 7-11 for pay and pick-up. However, if you don't have a Taiwanese friend who can complete the online transaction for you, then shopping in a physical store may be the only way to go."
taiwan,3a110y,carlito99,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:49:39 2015 UTC,"Hi Vigernere1, thanx so much for your elaborate reply! I wanted to reply earlier, but things have been hectic here as of late. However, I have searched through many of the links you supplied, and managed to email several stores. I got one reply thusfar, stating the watch would be in stock on the 27th. Too bad, that would be too late for my friend who is visiting this monday.   Howard's bike shop, judging from their site, sells mostly Garmin GPS units meant for cycling and sorts, and a couple of watches. But not the 225 I am afraid. They do not list an email address on their ste, so I have no way to contact them.  Sadly, I am not able to order through Ruten. I can't find a way to contact the sellers on that site, since there isn't an email address listed anywhere. And I do need to ask them what color they are selling. It is a mystery why they wouldn't just mention the color in the advertisement anyway; people want to know what product they are buying don't they? Also, I am short of one Taiwanese friend. :P Ruten is not going to help me in this matter I am afraid.  Still, I wanted to thank you for the time you took to send me such an elaborate reply, it is good to know that there are people from the other side of the world who will take the time to help a stranger out!

In particular, there's a spot next to the elementary school where you might see some scuba divers. It's actually marked on google maps as a snorkeling spot, and it's really nice for snorkeling.  The people I talked to there warned us not to snorkel outside of the pen because of the dangerous tides, but it seemed very safe to me. I guess you should always be careful, but I do recommend going."

taiwan,39xxb5,warkweh,2,Tue Jun 16 07:49:29 2015 UTC,the large pen is called dragon hole. It's actually not a bad snorkeling spot provided you get there before the frenetic busloads of Taiwanese people who snorkel wearing lifejackets. I. e. before about 11am on weekends. I don't know about weekdays. If the place is not overcrowded the water is really nice and clear. If there are too many people there it does get kind of gross because many Taiwanese prefer to stand/walk on the rocks and sea floor where possible and kick up a lot of dirt.  The distance between dragon hole and the area near the elementary school that someone mentioned in this thread is about 15 minutes walk/climb and you pass it on your way from the bus to dragon hole. So you can easily do both.

Have we considered a house party-esque event? There are many pros.     Cheaper booze. Buying bottles and mixing yourself is several times cheaper than buying at a bar. Space is as big or as small as you want, and you can arrange tables/chairs however you want. You can choose the music (BIG win here). No closing time. You only get kicked out when you leave. Or when the host says so. Hopefully after midnight. Not limited in food. You can order a bunch of takeout. Or go American and get pizza and chips.   There are a couple cons, but they are avoidable/fixable.     The mess. A house party is bound to make a mess. To mend this, if I can sleep at the host's place, I am very willing to help clean up in the morning. Splitting costs.

taiwan,39xjvq,jscott4321,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:48:20 2015 UTC,"Is it possible to apply to the school while in Taiwan, then fly to hong kong for a couple of days to have a visitors visa issued?   According to the BOCA website, the maximum length of a visitor visa is 90 days. Since you are a US citizen, this is the same as landing visa exempt for 90 days. You can apply for a visitor visa with code ""FR"" (i.e., studying in Taiwan) from a ROC overseas mission. I also believe the maximum duration of an ""FR"" visa is 90 days. However,  you can remain in the country and extend the visa by showing proof of continuing enrollment at a government approved school.   The benefit of getting a code""FR"" visa is that it lays the foundation for getting a resident visa (i.e., and ARC), and eventually health insurance. But if you are not staying in Taiwan long-term, then applying for an ""FR"" visitor visa might not be worth the hassle, although it could save you from having to hop over to HKG (or some other locale) 1-2 times within a year, due to your  visa exempt status expiring.  Note: I am not an expert. It's up to you to review the information published by the ROC and determine what your best course of action is."
taiwan,39xjvq,vigernere1,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:00:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the response!  I'm attempting to compile all of the information together on short notice, so this is incredibly helpful.  I'm trying to reach out to the closest Teco branch, but it may take a while to hear back.  Do you have any experience on what that process looks like from the hong kong side? in particular, the time frame for sorting this.  I know The timeframe may not be exact, just looking at other experiences to try and plan accordingly."
taiwan,39xjvq,Orangetinyfeet,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:14:12 2015 UTC,"Since last year you should be able to change your landing visa into a visitor visa without leaving Taiwan (I did this when I got my working permit). Ask your school, they should know best."

taiwan,39vkae,ShrimpCrackers,0,Wed Jun 17 06:15:30 2015 UTC,"You know it's sad when a supposedly politically backward country had more progressive immigration policy than you.   It's pretty much impossible for a mainland Chinese to even get a job in Taiwan, while China doesn't have this restriction. I think Taiwan should reconsider relaxing their policy regarding mainland skilled workers a bit."
taiwan,39vkae,JillyPolla,8,Mon Jun 15 12:07:26 2015 UTC,"First of all, this is only a visitor's visa, not a working visa, and has anything to do with immigration.  Secondly, what type of ""skilled workers"" does Taiwan lack? There's nothing wrong with restricting immigrant workers, when there are an excess locally."
taiwan,39vkae,Roygbiv0415,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:58:33 2015 UTC,"I find it funny that you would say Taiwan doesn't lack skilled workers, when there's so much talk about brain drain into US and now China. Some Chinese firms are paying very good money for Taiwanese workers and there are articles about these all the times."
taiwan,39vkae,JillyPolla,9,Mon Jun 15 13:04:50 2015 UTC,"""Brain drain"" correlates only to a worker's prospects in a country, and not the number of skilled workers. It is entirely possible (and is likely the case) that there's an oversaturation of skilled workers, thus lowering an individual's prospects, and resulting in brain drain. Bringing in more workers will only complicated the problem even further."
taiwan,39vkae,Roygbiv0415,0,Mon Jun 15 13:24:24 2015 UTC,"Except the current policy is discriminatory toward mainland skilled workers. Two otherwise equal people with one from US and the other from China would mean one of them have a much easier time and the other simply cannot.   That's the crux of the issue, that Taiwan's policy is discriminatory toward 1/5 of the population of the world. If we think that skilled workers from America should be able to come to work in Taiwan, then why not skilled worker from China? Clearly we don't think there's a saturation because we still allow those people to come. Unless you're in supportive of stopping skilled workers from Europe, America, and Japan as well?"
taiwan,39vkae,JillyPolla,5,Mon Jun 15 15:33:02 2015 UTC,"There's the tiny matter of China claiming Taiwan belongs to them and using all kinds of methods to prevent Taiwan from being treated as a nation. Also China has over a billion people, Taiwan has 23 million, which country do you think needs to guard against a mass influx of outsiders coming in to take jobs?"
taiwan,39vkae,zakazaw,0,Mon Jun 15 17:03:06 2015 UTC,"Nobody is arguing for unconditional entry of mainlanders into Taiwan, you're straw manning."
taiwan,39vkae,JillyPolla,4,Mon Jun 15 18:22:45 2015 UTC,"Not at all, I'm referring to your argument about letting mainland skilled workers into Taiwan. There is no local shortage of skilled workers so the only reason to let mainland skilled workers would be for cheap wages, which would impact the already low wages in Taiwan."
taiwan,39vkae,zakazaw,2,Tue Jun 16 04:29:09 2015 UTC,There are so many obvious reasons not to allow Chinese to work in Taiwan.
taiwan,39vkae,DerpyDogs,-11,Tue Jun 16 09:26:51 2015 UTC,"Rejoice my fellow blue taishang! Now we can sell-out and become traitors much faster!  Speaking of traitors and sell outs, did anyone catch that deal between DPP ass licking media group 三立 and China? Their boss just signed a huge deal with Zhejiang government to turn that place into the Hollywood of China. Meanwhile, 三立 slams everyone and anyone associated with ""China"" and ""Chinese"" 24/7. So its ok for this green scumbag to cozy up to China but not OK when others do it? When its a blue he/she is labeled a traitor. When a green does the same its being pragmatic?

taiwan,39vkae,BigOrbitalStrike,-13,Mon Jun 15 13:38:30 2015 UTC,Don't you find it funny the DPP standard bearer can't even Taiwanese? Watch her speeches and 99.9% is in putonghua. And here we have the green brigade trying to discredit KMT's Lil'Chili about her Taiwanese when in fact she speaks it better than everybody else. She speaks it better than Da-Bian. Lil'Chili even wants the national debate in Taiwanese.   Watch English Tsai's videos on youtube. You can see her struggle. She will start off with the elementary basics dage-ho then she switches into 100% putonghua. She is probably worse than President Ma in speaking Taiwanese lmao.  edit: OH SHIT WRONG THREAD!
taiwan,39vkae,zakazaw,6,Mon Jun 15 13:58:24 2015 UTC,"Well, she is Hakka and moved to Taipei when she was 11. I'm not sure many Hakka speak Taiwanese, especially those who live in the north. Maybe she should try to improve her Taiwanese if she really doesn't speak it, but it doesn't discredit her at all as a presidential candidate."
taiwan,39vkae,FormosaNation,5,Mon Jun 15 17:06:37 2015 UTC,These type of pro-KMT rants don't seem to have much of an effect these days. It's the whole Taiwanese tide you're trying to fight against as the Kuomintang as we know it is on its final existential legs. The KMT will lose the Presidency and Legislature on a massive scale no matter what happens at this point. Might be best to come to grips with this reality rather than pop another blood vessel.

Heck I'm sitting right now in Shibuya, people watching/browsing reddit near the hill of my hotel, and there's three Northern Chinese prostitutes/pimpettes trying to hook men for the past hour. I wonder what visa this is.

To OP:  without knowing your specific nation (you intimate it's not a G7 nation) it's hard to tell.

I was transferred into the course about a week late because of scheduling conflicts, and my first class was on the day of transfer. As such, I opened the door to a class that had already started and they were learning in Mandarin. The professor asked me what I needed, and I told him I had been transferred and gave him my papers. His response was, ""Well, I guess we have to switch languages!""  Finals rolled around and we needed to do a group paper using various modes of policy argument (ethical, analytic-metaphorical, parallel, etc.). When the time came, nobody wanted me in their group, so I just went ahead and said I'd do the paper myself.

taiwan,39stme,loserkids,-5,Tue Jun 16 19:32:35 2015 UTC,"I can only guess it's a combination of:    far more traditional gender roles   losing face  specific personal situation.   The first two apparently are a mystery to many Americans though they shouldn't be.    To me Taiwan is very similar to 1950s US in terms of gender roles - the man is the man.  I grew up with a ""Mad Men"" era of US society so it's pretty familiar to me when I see it.   Traditional gender roles are pretty universal throughout Asia.    The entire SFW/feminist extremism pretty much isn't going to ever get any traction in Asia and even moderate feminism  is NOTHING remotely like it is in the US or even Europe (which tends to be more pragmatic than the US).  American women live and breath it in the recent generations to a degree they probably don't even recognize.   There are certain expectations of women and this could be the problem.   Asia is very much a Man's World and I don't see that changing and particular NEVER for any individual - society and the group trump the individual in Asia.  The ""face"" thing is hard to explain but the closest analog in the US is ""Southern Honor"".  Or perhaps what you see with Catholic Guilt.  Asian ""face"" has a more internalize yet socially pervasive aspect than these.  This is part of ""social cohesion and harmony"" as a cultural value.  Being forcible paired with not just a foreigner but a woman might have shamed him with his friends or classmates or even others (e.g. family if they find out).  If there's a chance that either he'll have to ride on her coattails or be bettered, grade-wise or even if the ""tone"" of the shared work is more Western than Chinese, it could cause stress.    Odds are a Western male would stir a reaction as well in this case only it would be handled with more male-to-male communication/signaling (e.g. aggression, competitiveness, deception, etc.)  Lastly you can never tell about individuals.  They are, well, individual so you get extremes sometimes."

taiwan,39f32j,kelev,5,Thu Jun 11 08:13:53 2015 UTC,"The first issue you are having is your word choice. You probably mean to say 少 and not 小. Also, not all stores offer the same options. 少糖 at one place might be 微糖 at another place. 正常 at one store might be 七分 at another. It would behoove you to learn the way the major brands operate. I liked more sugar when I got to Taiwan, but wanted it less and less sweet after a few weeks. At Coco I get 七分, which might be their lowest amount of sugar. If it's not Coco, I'll say ""我要最少唐"". For ice, I just ask for 正常, but you could always ask for 少一點的冰塊. I think ""half ice"" might be confusing, because it's usually either ""do you want ice or not?"". As a foreigner speaking Mandarin as a second language, I try to speak in full sentences so my meaning is better understood."

taiwan,39f32j,Tyberos,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:28:18 2015 UTC,My bad. I've clearly spent too much time on mainland Chinese learning resources.   Surprised first tone would generate that kind of a reaction though. Is it a political thing?
taiwan,39f32j,no_shoes_in_house,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:53:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I didn't fully think about it because she (the native speaker) didn't say anything about mainlanders when I asked her opinion, but then I started thinking of words with 微 and I realized I pronounce them with first tone sometimes and second tone other times. I asked her to explain why ""微波"" and ""微薄"" are first tone, and she said ""because you're saying it like a mainlander."" So I think it's one of those small speaking difference between CN and TW.

taiwan,39ec8u,lalamountain,8,Thu Jun 11 04:15:52 2015 UTC,"For the first time, I think this electric scooter might actually get some buyin from the younger consumers.

The more people can switch to electric scooters the less pollution we'll all be breathing in on this island."
taiwan,39ec8u,kzilla88,9,Thu Jun 11 08:26:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, young people making 30k NT a month are dying to spend 100k NT on an electric scooter that's tied to a proprietary battery managed by a princeling known for ill-conceived business moves."
taiwan,39ec8u,just_face,2,Thu Jun 11 08:58:39 2015 UTC,"A higher-end gasoline 125cc scooter costs 80k+ anyways, and must I remind you (again) that the price is not yet set? There is a NT$10,000 government subsidy plus a further NT$13,000 Taipei City subsidy to put in consideration as well.  Cher Wang is an investor. She does not decide the business moves. If anything, the current CEO (Horace Luke) is the one who propelled HTC to where it is today, and left to start Gogoro before HTC's decline. Horace Luke knows his shit. Two hours of interviewing him convinced me that Gogoro did indeed have every detail thought out. The only thing they can't be sure about, is whether they can price their battery exchange scheme attractively, not the price of the scooter.  I'm in my early 30s. 100k NT is acceptable for me, and I'm seriously considering buying one when it comes out."
taiwan,39ec8u,Roygbiv0415,3,Thu Jun 11 09:15:40 2015 UTC,"I think the point is that the comparison for very many people is not ""Do I buy the brand new 100k electric scooter with the battery thing or the brand new 80k scooter that runs on gas"" but rather ""Do I buy the brand new 100k electric scooter with the battery thing or a used junker scooter that is going to get me around just the same for 7k?""; I think the idea has a lot of promise, and they definitely seem to have a good deal of the investment they need to make it work, but it's absolutely vital to remember that the scooter industry in Taiwan is largely based in how cheap everything is for those without the money to spend. Not just the bike itself, but the accessories, insurance, fuel, repair/maintenance, and the irregularity of fines.   There's not a lot about the scooter itself that makes it more desirable to most people; the battery infrastructure is where this project could go extremely well, but it requires that people buy into it. Given that the battery network is going to be inferior to the existing petrol network for an indefinite period of time, the total cost of ownership is almost certainly going to be lower for the old gas scooter, and the environmental impact of creating a new scooter is probably higher than the exhaust output from an old one, what reasons are there to buy in here for the majority of drivers?"
taiwan,39ec8u,Ifkl,3,Thu Jun 11 10:32:57 2015 UTC,"Granted, the launch product is not for the majority of potential buyers. Gogoro has stated that they can make a NT$75000-ish bike with current technology, or perhaps even less, but they're not looking into selling high volumes of the (first version) vehicle anyways. There will be 80 or so battery exchange stations at launch, with on average about 24 batteries (each scooter uses 2) at each station. Gogoro can turn around a set of batteries in about 4-6 hours (faster if needs be, but at a cost of battery lifespan), which is about... 50 sets a day? Most scooters, according to Gogoro's estimates, exchange batteries every 3 days, so a station could service about 150 scooters on average, and 80 stations would equate 12,000 scooters.  80 stations might be plenty for commuting in and out of Taipei City. But to scale beyond that, either the number of batteries at each station need to be increased, or more stations need to be in place. This basically puts a limit on the total number of Gogoros running around before the system is significantly scaled up. Gogoro considers 80,000 sold in the first year to be a wild success, but not necessarily the success Gogoro wants to see, as the pressure to increase exchange stations will be very high.  In that sense, perhaps Gogoro could be deliberately pricing the launch scooter out of a competitive price range (though again, we don't know until June 17 if that's actually true), to keep sales of the first model in range of exchange station growth. And, ""Of course we have more premium and economic models in development. It's really a matter of figuring out if we can supply the infrastructure to make this succeed."""
taiwan,39ec8u,Roygbiv0415,2,Thu Jun 11 10:57:05 2015 UTC,"Interesting to hear the numbers. I suppose youbike stands are slightly flawed as an example--you have to end your youbike usage at a given stop (or walk the rest of the way, defeating the point), but batteries could be changed at numerous points along a route. Still, given that there are going to be areas of significantly lighter and significantly heavier usage, not to mention batteries are not going to be exchanged with perfect timing, so 12000 seems incredibly optimistic. If 80k is ""wild success"", I wonder what ""acceptable minimum"" is; this whole thing is a huge balancing act. The one thing they may have in their favor is that a battery terminal of that size could be installed much cheaper than a charging/battery exchange station the likes Tesla makes; you could probably fit at least one of these terminals anywhere you could stuff an ATM or vending machine. Still, then you have issues with manufacturing the terminals, and making people aware of their location.  One other major concern is that they seem to have the ability to track consumer's locations; on the one hand, without this ability, their business would have a hugely more difficult time assessing where battery terminals are needed, but on the other, this raises huge privacy concerns. Police use of ETC information already has controversy, imagine hijacking of this information, either by gogoro itself (targeted ads being one obvious application), or by the state. Depending on how they handle access to the information, things could be even worse--imagine a mechanic who, as part of servicing your vehicle, has access to your location history. I'm not sure how much this will matter to most consumers, but one big scandal or lawsuit could ruin a company like this."
taiwan,39ec8u,Ifkl,2,Thu Jun 11 11:24:34 2015 UTC,"Most people pay monthly for their scooter in Taiwan, few can afford to pay outright. The difference is more likely something like 500nt a month."
taiwan,39ec8u,ShrimpCrackers,2,Thu Jun 11 18:09:18 2015 UTC,"To tell you the truth, if the seat wasn't so damned tiny and it had a little more power. I take my scooter everywhere and the Gogoro just isn't going to cut it for me.  ""Get a car if you need carrying space."" I don't carry that much, but what I do have with me generally fits inside of, say, a KYMCO G5/6 (125cc) or higher models. Additionally, I need that second seat.  Another flaw, for me, is I just don't think this guy is going to make it up the steep mountains I take scooters. Granted, look at the thing and who it is marketed at, and then think about that statement. It's not made for me, so I can't complain about this.  These designs are slick, but impractical for some scooter users.  I'd love to pick up an electric, proprietary parts or not, but I'm going to need to keep using my gasoline-burner until the right vehicle comes out."
taiwan,39ec8u,Get9,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:06:57 2015 UTC,"The mere fact you cannot take the battery and charge it FROM THE COMFORT OF YOUR OWN HOME WITH A REGULAR 110V PLUG shows how shortsighted and retarded Gegoro is.  The whole point of a portable battery that can power your scooter is so you can CHARGE it at the convenience of your home, not tied to random stations over the city.  Gegoro will fail, just like hundreds of ""electric scooter"" proposals that came before it. I cannot believe they think a system of battery swaps at 7-elevens is enough.  http://cleantechnica.com/2015/01/08/why-the-gorgeous-gogoro-electric-scooter-cant-be-plugged-in/  It still boggles my mind why a single battery charger cannot be purchased. If the battery is small enough to carry upstairs to your apartment, why not let them be charged privately?  This is just like another of those stupid bike sharing stations that does nothing to help with traffic congestion and pollution. I hope someone figures out a hack or create a portable charger rather than relying on ""stations."""
taiwan,39ec8u,Doremi-fansubs,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:33:39 2015 UTC,"Because the battery cell is really expensive (we're talking about prices approaching the cost of half the scooter itself or more), and Gogoro wants to make that money back by selling electricity (very) expensively. Makes sense?"
taiwan,39ec8u,Roygbiv0415,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:08:35 2015 UTC,So? They should either have a deposit program for the battery or roll it into the price of the scooter.  Neglecting the best part about electric vehicles (HOME BASED CHARGING) is just plain stupid. It's battery DRM. Pointless.
taiwan,39ec8u,Doremi-fansubs,-1,Wed Jun 17 15:06:58 2015 UTC,"the current CEO (Horace Luke) is the one who propelled HTC to where it is today, and left to start Gogoro before HTC's decline   lol, he was there at the time where they really just coasted on a major wave of industry expansion   I'm in my early 30s. 100k NT is acceptable for me, and I'm seriously considering buying one when it comes out.   I can't imagine any scenario where I am commuting regularly by scooter in my 30s.  I will almost certainly have an electric motorcycle though."
taiwan,39ec8u,just_face,2,Thu Jun 11 09:30:22 2015 UTC,"I don't get your fixation with motorcycles in this crowded little island. It's obvious that the scooter is king in Taiwan. The problem is that there already way too many scooters at over 20 million, the last thing Taiwan needs is motorcycles. How do motorcycles solve Taiwan's pollution problems?   Also, back in mainland China, e-bikes are hugely popular. There's millions of people riding them in Beijing alone. E-bikes and electric scooters are pretty much the same thing, so I see no reason why they can't succeed here. I think there just needs to be some incentive by the government and people should start switching."

taiwan,39ec8u,keyilan,2,Thu Jun 11 11:53:36 2015 UTC,"Gogoro's response is quite interesting in this regard. In their test data, peak battery exchange happens at 7-8 AM, and a smaller peak at 6-8 PM. So they'll be charging the battery for the morning crowd using excess power production at nighttime, and drawing little, even giving back power to the grid in the morning till afternoon, before charging again. So while burden is indeed shifted to the grid in general, the net increase is pretty minimal.  One figure Gogoro gave but I'm not sure of, is that even every scooter in Taiwan is a Gogoro, total daily power usage would only go up by 3%, and much of that would be generated in nighttime anyways."

In the US, we have cars and legit cool (250cc and up) motorcycles.  The US doesn't need this shit, and honestly Taiwan should try to minimize scooters as a mode of transport, nudging people towards public transit or heavily restricted auto ownership."

Scooters larger than 125cc are normally too big for the standard-sized scooter parking spaces in Taiwan, and are quite a PITA to find a parking spot. Gogoro, OTOH, is the same size as a 125 and should be easy to find parking.  Gogoros can go pretty fast. The acceleration from 0-50km is about the same as a 250cc (or so I'm told by a 250cc Vespa owner), and it goes up to slightly over 90km/h. Not quite 150cc levels of speed, but could compare favorably against 125s."
taiwan,39ec8u,just_face,-1,Thu Jun 11 05:27:57 2015 UTC,"You know they are going to fail when the company is trying desperately to market itself as an upmarket/luxury solution, but the company has to carefully dance around issues like MSRP and efficiency at speed.  A 250cc equivalent electric motor is surprisingly small and I have no doubt the motor is capable of delivering the power, but it's less clear that the power system and batter will be capable of delivering 20KW on demand or for very long."
taiwan,39ec8u,Roygbiv0415,9,Thu Jun 11 05:37:59 2015 UTC,"Then again, the gogoro seems to be marketed for urban transportation, not racing or doing a road trip around the island, I mean, you certainly don't need to be driving 90km/h in the city."

It's a product without a market.  People who can afford to pay the high cost of a Gogoro would rather buy a car, and the concept requires a large network of people to ride to justify the power distribution model.  The ideal customer Gogoro is designed for:   Likes design Big fan of new technology, commutes to his/her job at a startup Has the disposable income to spend on nice things and does so   There's only a small number of these kind of people, and most of them are not interested in driving a scooter.  *I know the price has not been released, but if the price was reasonable, I would expect it would have been at least revealed by now, if not openly advertised"

It is not the price of the scooter that we can't decide, it's the price and model of battery exchanges. We are still working on that.""

I feel that if you were going for a pure subscription model though, some sort of car-sharing scheme would be much more profitable and valuable.

That's why we choose scooters, and that's why we choose Taipei. It's our hometown, and we know it well. There are 15 million scooters in Taiwan, but annual sales figures of new scooters is only about 670k. This tells us that there are large amounts of people riding old scooters (15~20 years old) that are both outdated and polluting. We hope to use a brand new product and concept, to not only tap into this market, but also help remove some of the most polluting scooters off Taipei's streets. Taipei City provides a NT13,000 subsidy for citizens turning in old scooters in exchange for a new EV model, and we believe that this works perfectly with our product, and will help greatly with spreading the use of our system."""

Honestly, it would be pretty cool if Gogoro was cool with people completely thrashing their batteries.

Douse everything in their orange spicy sauce. The chimichanga is actually pretty bomb, but I usually go for tacos because I'm usually craving tacos every other day even though they're not that great in Taipei.   If you like gyros and shawarmas, I highly recommend Sababa Pita Bar. Boooooooooomb! Ask for a side of the spicy jalapeño sauce. Sooooo grub.   For hot wings, I think Burger and Co. is straight up delish.   The poutine at Whalen's is amaaaaaazing. I like the Canadian Classic, but the ones with toppings are bomb as well."

taiwan,39d2js,throwaway367285,5,Wed Jun 10 23:16:24 2015 UTC,"The Taiwanese tourism bureau sponsors free half-day tours specifically for transiting passengers with long layovers. The morning tour departing at 8AM-ish, and returning at 1PM-ish, though it doesn't go to Taipei, but a couple of spots nearby instead."
taiwan,39d2js,Roygbiv0415,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:49:49 2015 UTC,This. I have heard good reviews about this.
taiwan,39d2js,foggysf,4,Fri Jun 12 15:35:53 2015 UTC,"Let's assume you land exactly at 5AM and deplane and clear passport control/customs by 6AM (early morning is actually a busy time at the airport, so it could be later). Let's also assume you want to be back at the airport by 12PM for a 2PM departure. This gives you ~6 hours.   You can take the Evergreen bus from the airport to Taipei, getting off at the Zhongxiao Fuxing MRT stop. It's a ~1 hour ride in normal conditions, perhaps slightly less early in the morning. If you take the Evergreen bus back to the airport (another ~1 hour ride; you'll board the bus exactly where it dropped you off at  Zhongxiao Fuxing) you have ~4 hours of time to explore Taipei.   Early in the morning (~7AM) virtually everything will be closed, so you might want to focus on outdoor sights. You could visit the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, a large open-air pavilion (there is small memorial museum bit it will be closed that early in the morning). Another option is to take a ride on the Maokong Gondola and enjoy the view of the city (opens at 9AM; early in the morning there's not much to do at the peak, so I suggest just immediately riding back down). Another great view is available from the Taipei 101 Observatory which also opens at 9AM. If you are in modest shape and don't mind sweating a bit (it's quite hot in the summer time), consider climbing the Elephant Mountain Trail (which is really just one long stair climb); base to the first summit (the trail continues onwards but you won't have time to keep going) is about ~30-40 minutes if you are in modest shape and climb at a reasonable pace.  FYI, this kind of question (i.e., ""I have an X hour layover in Tapei, what should I do) has been asked many times before in this subreddit, you should be able to find many other suggestions using the search function.  Edit: some other, random thoughts:   You can withdraw USD from the ATMs at the airport, or if you have cash there are several currency exchange counters. Since your layover is so short, you won't need much money. The MRT is extremely convenient, easy to use, and affordable. Every MRT station has vending machines that sell single journey tokens that you use to enter/exit the station. Each kiosk has a map of the MRT system above it, displaying the cost of a single journey from the station you are at to your destination station. There is also ""one day pass"" available for $150NTD (not including refundable deposit), but again, given your short stay it's probably not worth buying. Taipei offers a bike rental program called ""UBike"" which is a great way to get around and see the city. I don't recommend it for you, since your time will be limited. The Evergreen bus costs ~$140NTD one-way. If taking the Evergreen bus back to the airport Zhongxiao Fuxing, you will most likely see small groups of other travelers waiting for the bus too (they'll have suitcases). You'll also notice a woman approaching them (or possibly you) selling bus tickets. Don't worry, it's not a scam. Although she doesn't wear a uniform, the tickets she sells are valid. You will keep the ticket and give it to the bus driver when you exit the bus at the airport. The Evergreen bus stops at both Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 at the airport. The first stop at the airport (coming back from Taipei) is Terminal 2. There is an MRT line under construction from Taipei to the airport, but it's extremely unlikely it'll operating when you arrive. That said, it wouldn't hurt to do a quick Google search before you come to confirm. In the .0005% chance the line is operating, it'll be much easier to take it rather than the bus."
taiwan,39d2js,vigernere1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:37:18 2015 UTC,It will take about 1-1.5 hours to leave the airport and then you need to be there 2 hours for check in.  That leave you with 5.5 hours at the most to sight-see.  In my personal opinion I would stay away from Taipei.  It is at least an hour away There is traffic and other variable to consider that might make you late for you flight.  Stick close to the airport.  Don't stress yourself out.
taiwan,39d2js,wobijiaohao,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:35:58 2015 UTC,"Well there isn't much to do.  Your closest city from the airport with something to do would be Zhongli 中壢.  There is a really nice department store there called Sogo and a movie theater across the street called Venice Theaters.  Around that area are nice shops, breakfast shops, coffee shops, ect.  Sogo is on Yuan Hua Rd #357 (元化路357號.  You can also walk around the train station.  There are fun little shops around there.  The train station in Chinese is 中壢火車站 (Zhongli Huo che Zhan) Sogo is within walking distance if you can find the way or about a 80-100nt taxi ride from each other.  From the airport Zhongli is about 15 min away depending on traffic and about a 600nt taxi ride.  This is probably your best option.  It is better than sitting in the Taoyuan airport.  That airport is terrible.  Not much to do.  Get out and enjoy some Taiwanese breakfast and enjoy Taiwan for a few hours.  Get yourself a danbing (蛋餅）I think it is a rice based burrito with egg.  You can add bacon, cheese, even tuna.  They are wonderful!  The Taiwanese are extremely friendly too and will help you out.  Good luck."
taiwan,39d2js,wobijiaohao,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:39:41 2015 UTC,"You could take a cab to the HSR station, be in Taipei two hours after landing.  That's 7am-ish, enough time to grab breakfast and then start looking around.  Go back to the HSR by around 11am to make it back for your flight;  you don't want to miss it.  I wouldn't recommend waiting for the shuttle bus on the way from the airport to the HSR;  they are irregular, and depending on which terminal you are at, they may have filled up at the other one before arriving at yours.  I missed the last train one time because of that -- only one or two people could get on each bus at my terminal.  Stupid system."
taiwan,39d2js,richardtheassassin,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:54:53 2015 UTC,"Well, 5 am means at least things are open if you leave the airport.  Actually breakfast places are open between 5 am and 6 am (they were in my neighborhood).  Honestly it depends on what you enjoy.  That's a personal value choice no one can help you with.  You probably have time for 1 thing."
taiwan,39e0vw,Dorakeen,9,Thu Jun 11 02:59:44 2015 UTC,"The bigger deterrence comes from the question China must ask itself internally: is Taiwan worth it?  Regardless of whether the US lives up to its commitments under the TRA, if Taiwan faces an unprovoked war with China, China will certainly face global economic sanctions.  For China's upper class this would be absolutely crippling. Party Officials and State Owned Enterprise executives would see their overseas funds frozen, and visas revoked for foreign countries. Those $1 million condos in Sydney and Vancouver go bye-bye, and the kids come home from UBC... without the sports cars.   For military leadership this would be a tough choice as well. Why go after some piss-ant island, and have the potential to lose face with soldiers start dying, ships get sunk, and generally your equipment doesn't work as well as expected? The status-quo, getting rich off of the military industrial complex, is much better.   tl; dr for China Taiwan isn't worth it. It would lead to further instability of an already fractious society."
taiwan,39e0vw,DerpyDogs,5,Thu Jun 11 06:22:33 2015 UTC,"The question is more realistically: Is the Taiwanese population prepared to live in a besieged economy regardless of the win/lose result?  I imagine most anyone with the means will fuck off to other countries.  Remember that being at war means you don't get to go to night market, food imports are going to be really tricky, and creature comforts are going to vanish pretty quickly.  Basically the past 50 years of gains in prosperity will be gone and possibly also an entire generation of men."

A nation of 26 million isn't going to survive against 1.35 billion or whatever the mainland is up to now.  Even without China using nuclear weapons.  If Taiwan were to secretly have a few nukes stashed away to retailate against Beijing (and Shanghai, and a few other major industrial regions), it would give China some pause, but of course China has also said that the moment Taiwan moves to develop a nuclear bomb, China will invade, so there's that."

Read the story. Population numbers have little to do with the outcome of a conflict. In conflicts in which a much stronger power engaged a much weaker adversary, the weaker power won 90% of the time. It's estimated that less than 50,000-- actually, more in the neighborhood of 30,000-- insurgents took on 180,000 US troops and 50,000 mercenaries in Iraq. Did the US emerge victorious?

taiwan,3992qm,laopi,5,Wed Jun 10 03:27:16 2015 UTC,"Something I don't understand from the article, though:   starting wages for college graduates new to the workforce in July last year stood at NT$25,634, while college students 17 years ago received starting salaries of NT$27,209.   So it's clearly a step backwards, with salaries lower than those 17 years ago. But...   While the survey showed a steady increase in annual wages for all higher-education students — the survey showed that wages for people with bachelor’s degrees increased by 1.73 percent, wages for those with master’s degrees or higher rose by 1.03 percent, while master’s graduates with arts degrees saw increases of 0.79 percent — the increases were below average.   Isn't this in contradiction with the previous quote?"
taiwan,3992qm,JillyPolla,5,Wed Jun 10 03:28:55 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. The explanation could be that more people are going to college nowadays.

It could simply be that since everyone and their dogs are going to college, the value of a college as a signalling device is not worth much nowadays. 17 years ago, the avearge college grad is more capable, so s/he received higher starting pay."

Rarely do I see a general college (not the technik ones) that actually prepare their students for the work market, let alone internship opportunities or at least someone from the industry come and lecture on what skills are actually needed.  Students, on the other hand, have no idea what's needed to succeed outside school. Many seem to presume that by simply graduating, you get a (well-paying) job, and will be settled for life. Honestly if I were to employ people, the majority of college graduate these days are useless. Everything will have to be re-taught, and there is a very high possibility these newbies will just move on to more famous (but not necessarily higher pay) companies as soon as the get the chance, for the prestige of working at said company.  Finally, a rare object is no longer worthy if everyone has it. That's basic economics. College graduates are so numerous (and so undifferentiated) these days, that it's no longer a clear bonus. On the contrary, if you did not go to a top university or be at the top of your class, it might actually be detrimental.  These factors together mean that companies hiring newly-grads are reluctant to post out a high starting wage, but the wages don't necessarily stay low if your skills are in demand. Many classmates of mine who started out low, but stuck around and performed well got raised rather quickly, because the companies they work for are really keen to keep them. Though still not quite at the same level as US or Europe, a couple are earning NT$100,000+ monthly before bonuses at age 30."

Startup growth would help push Taiwan into the software industry, while also potentially reinforcing Taiwan’s strengths in hardware manufacturing and attracting new talent to the island.  New NDC funds set aside this year for startups will provide US$83 million to VC's and US $15 million to 500Startups to invest in Taiwanese entrepreneurs, which hopefully will lead to increased domestic support and a stronger foundation for other such Taiwanese startups looking to get off the ground.  Looking to South Korea (a major regional competitor) as an example, their focus on Internet development laid the foundation for one of the most successful IT economies in the world today. With Taiwanese startups like Gogolook, the News Lens, and others gaining international attention, hopefully Taiwan's startups will see more opportunities to grow in the near future."

taiwan,390639,zanglang,8,Mon Jun 8 07:51:58 2015 UTC,"For burritos you can try Juanita's near Zhongxiao Fuxing (here's a review from 2012) or Macho Taco near ShiDa (review from 2010 here). As someone else recommended, you can try Eddie's in Tianmu (2012 review here). Also, I remember seeing last year a burrito place open in Shilin, I think it was King Burrito. I think it's closed now, which if true isn't surprising - their burritos were insanely expensive.  As far as I recall, the burritos from Mach Taco are similar both in taste and price - about $180(?) for a basic burrito without extras like guacamole (of which, at both restaurants, you only get a tiny bit, and it's expensive. I say skip it). Juanita's provides Tabasco and Tapatio hot sauce, but I'm more of a Cholula kind of guy. Can you get better burritos back home? Of course. I would say both Macho Taco and Junita's burritos are pretty average. (Note: if you think Chipotle is the end-all-be-all of burritos, then sadly you've never eaten a great, ""authentic"" burrito. (What exactly is the definition of an ""authentic"" burrito anyway?) That said, I'd rate Chipotle a bit higher than both Juanita's and Macho Taco).  I just happened to eat at Eddy's this weekend, having had the fajitas, sopes, and fish tacos. Everything was good (I thought the fish tacos were quite good, actually). (FYI Eddie is from Canada with family from Guadalajara). Can you find better back home? Yes of course, but I think that's an unfair comparison - at a minimum the available ingredients and/or quality of those ingredients in Taiwan may be sufficiently different such that no matter how skilled Eddie is, or ""authentic"" his recipes/techniques are, the food will never taste quite the same as in America, Mexico, etc. (For example, Taiwan-raised pork tastes noticeably better different (not necessarily better or worse) than most American-raised pork). Also, a restaurant may have to alter a dish to better suit Taiwanese taste preferences (I'm not necessarily saying that's the case at Eddie's).  Oh, and yes - whether it's a burrito or dishes at Eddie's the prices across the board will be higher. At Eddie's I spent $1,600, which included the above dishes (2 fish tacos, 3 sopes), a glass of beer (~$190) and a glass of horchata (~$80, far too sweet for most Taiwanese people to enjoy, I think). It was admittedly a lot of food for two people, but we were quite hungry and wanted to sample a few dishes."

Note that like most everywhere, bespoke (i.e. multiple fittings, fully canvassed, ability to customize everything) costs a pretty penny, and Taiwan is no exception (though still much cheaper than London, NYC, or Milan).   Nobility Tailor (http://www.nobility.com.tw/) Nobility is a more conservative cut, leaning towards an american sack suit.  It's said that many TW presidents have their suits made here.  Price will depend on your choice of cloth.  Super 120s from Vitale Barberis Canonico was ~40K.  But they also have a bargain bin which is 28K (and can have some nice fabrics). Gentleman Tailor (http://www.gentlemen.com.tw/) Gentleman Tailor leans more modern, lots of waist suppression and fitted pants, it looks great but is less comfortable.  The current Mayor of Taipei gets his suits made here.  ~10-20% more expensive than Nobility.   Hope this helps."
taiwan,38zp7y,faceroll_it,5,Mon Jun 8 04:46:35 2015 UTC,Just show a picture on your phone of the style you want and ask for that style.
taiwan,38zp7y,dtails,2,Mon Jun 8 04:56:19 2015 UTC,"If your willing to spend some money for some really quality service, Eddie Tham is a great recommendation for a well spoken English speaking barber/stylist.   You basically feel super pampered with your choice of Tea/Coffee the moment you step in. Your asked what style you would prefer to be done and then given his recommendations and opinions. Afterwards your directed to a shampoo/massage before a final confirmation of your cut. Eddie will make sure not a single hair intrudes any of your clothing at the end result and style your hair while giving tips on how to stay slick with or without product. Overall i was super impressed with the service he provides, and have really never gotten such high standard services in the US at all. Its a real treat for sure. The pricing might be expensive for Taiwan standards, but isn't too far off from US standards. I'm telling you...bar none THE BEST.  He's moved to a new location which is on his website, i literally almost went to his old one.  His website:  http://www.eddietham.net/"
taiwan,38zp7y,oAnime,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:51:02 2015 UTC,"Eddie Tham is a great recommendation for a well spoken English speaking barber/stylist.   Eddie is fantastic, no doubt. Unfortunately the last time I went he charged $1,200 for a basic men's haircut, which is quite expensive, especially if you need your haircut every ~4 weeks.   OP, since you speak decent Mandarin, I'll recommend a place that I've had good luck with: QB House in the Zhongshan underground mall. It's $300 for a haircut. The stylists there give dozens of (men's) haircuts every day (in other words, they have good skills through lots of practice). If you've got a straightforward hairstyle (i.e., no highlights, perming, etc.) then give it a shot. As someone else suggested, you can bring some pictures of yourself to show them your ideal hairstyle too."

taiwan,38uvbv,mattintaiwan,17,Mon Jun 8 08:22:00 2015 UTC,"If you speak decent enough Mandarin (conversational or above) just do whatever you'd do normally in the States to make friends. Sports, video games, church, fashion, etc. I recommend this over ""language exchange"", because people at ""language exchange"" came specifically to practice English, whereas if you just join basketball club or whatever, people won't try to English you up, they'll just be like ""oh thank god you can speak Chinese"" and talk to you like normal people. Practice time!  Low-impact hiking is very popular -- they even put stairs on the mountains. You could probably get literally anyone to go hiking with you. NTU has a hiking club (登山社) but they're really hardcore (equipment, overnights, etc) if you're into that.  The one disadvantage of coming in summer is that many clubs won't be having meetings, but you can still try looking them up/introducing yourself and seeing if anyone's up for meeting up during summer -- google/facebook ""台大+[name of interest] and see what you find.     Gay is fine with the vast majority of people. You may be interested in gay bars around 西門紅樓."

I have many close Taiwanese friends now that I only converse in Mandarin with. It took me a little while to build them up.  I don't think bars or clubs are a good way to meet Taiwanese friends because their drinking culture is different from Western countries.  For me I am now really involved in the motorcycle scene here, so through Facebook groups I have met Taiwanese and have come to their riding events and shows.  I also did racing here as well, so that is how I met my Taiwanese friends.  What ever your hobbies are, I suggest you find that kind of group in Facebook and introduce yourself.  Start trying to meet some Taiwanese that like the same thing you do.  This worked for me, and over the years has improved my Mandarin speaking ability enormously.  Good luck!"

Specifically, as a cook, I wonder if he might be interested in some of the ingredients/cooking tools that are rarer in Taiwan. Like a blender or something.

taiwan,38r0i0,FormosaNation,3,Sat Jun 6 06:08:58 2015 UTC,"If the Kuomintang fails to transform itself from a Chinese party into a Taiwanese party, then they will ultimately fade away into history.   The KMT now face an existential crisis far more severe than the DPP ever faced. Even after past defeats, the DPP still held onto their electoral bases in the south and always had the growing pro-Taiwanese demographic in their favor. The KMT Party has already lost their key strongholds in the north, and face a daunting future without any political youth or leadership to power their ranks. The living KMT fossils still running the show will continue to age until they finally croak.....taking their dreams of unification to their graves."
taiwan,38r0i0,ShrimpCrackers,2,Sat Jun 6 22:04:44 2015 UTC,"It may not be apparent yet, but the KMT is also forging a new identity for themselves with their pro-china relations, pro-business, and pro-death penalty stance. This is an angle that will draw a lot of well-to-do taiwanese people that may have business on the mainland and a conservative mindset. Hung is actually leading in the latest polls due to the recent death penalty craze.  On the other hand, the DPP has gradually backed away from the exclusivity of their 本土化 campaign in favor of working with grassroots organizations, fighting for the poor and disadvantaged, and environmentalism. This, as the article argues, makes them more appealing to third-gen waishenren.  In other words, the future of taiwan's two-party system will not be benshenren vs waishenren, but left vs right like all the other mature democracies around the world."
taiwan,38r0i0,hiimsubclavian,3,Sun Jun 7 02:00:11 2015 UTC,"Hung is ""leading in the latest polls"" because DPP and independent voters are messing with survey outcomes to guarantee a Hung nomination as the KMT's candidate for President. If Sean Lien had thrown his hat into the KMT primary, I can guarantee you that he too would have greatly surpassed all KMT candidates in the surveys due to the opposition's glee at mocking these dark Blue types.

The KMT can no longer maintain power as an exclusive club for a group that arrived in Taiwan post-WWII nor can the DPP rely on Hoklo nationalism to get people out to vote.

In this article it's talking about how they're a voting bloc.  I understand how it's inconvenient for people to talk about the Elite ranks who are defined by key points of their heritage because it makes them highly unappealing and thats why you prefer we don't talk about it.  But that's a huge difference versus the ""Racism against Waishengren"" that you keep complaining about.  Anyway, even this article points out that the bloc is vanishing anyway, from age. Most of the kids of ""Waishengren"" identify as Taiwanese as well and some even Taiwanese first.'   For decades, official language, ancestral household registration, and connections were among the means used to enforce implicit apartheid in Taiwan...  ...gatekeepers of the social conversation...   But the article is not wrong. I mean seriously, people called us Taiwanese as ""Taike"" to put us down, even on TV today! They even say things like ""Taike are lazy"" and ""Taike are stupid"" while they got their wealth through connections that they themselves didn't create. They're just assholes. Kind of like when BigOrbitalStrike called the young generation in Taiwan, lazy, stupid and all other Taike memes and people on this subreddit were offended. The elitism of Waishengren is unfair, but its not unfounded because the elites of the Waishengren have called themselves and highlighted themselves as such, much the way Sean Lien drove fancy sports cars and spent millions of NT chasing starlets and showed off his wealth, then was upset when the people of Taiwan didn't see him as one of them.  It's also clear that there's a culture gap. Look at SkyAnvil posting about Philippino ships expecting the same backlash as on /r/China and then realizing that no one cares. He's from China. He's shocked. Maybe it'll dawn on him that there's a cultural gap too.  Acknowledging an issue is not the same as acting on it. People talking about racism doesn't make them racist. People talking about a voting bloc and talking about true issues about them is not racism. The article doesn't say Waishengren are evil, in fact the father of the writer is Waishengren if you actually paid attention!"

No surprise that the 80's and 90's were full of crimes involving vast flimsy conspiracies. With endless appeals they cannot win because they don't have an unlimited budget like the government.
taiwan,38qes2,ShrimpCrackers,-2,Sun Jun 7 16:13:28 2015 UTC,"Ok using your logic, since our justice system is not perfect, then just to be on the safe side, we should never punish anybody. And you want to talk about paranoia?"
taiwan,38qes2,JillyPolla,4,Sun Jun 7 16:32:29 2015 UTC,"No, what you have there is a Black and White fallacy. No one is asking for extremes but to fill out your weak position you need to do so.  You never considered that execution makes it impossible to undo the sentencing in any way since the defendant is dead nor bothered to address the point that there has been a long history of prisoners on death row sentenced with politics in mind."
taiwan,38qes2,ShrimpCrackers,-2,Sun Jun 7 16:36:05 2015 UTC,But you're going to the extremes yourself. You're coming from the assumption that Taiwan's justice system is full of conspiratorial intent where people are just locked up for no reason.
taiwan,38qes2,JillyPolla,4,Sun Jun 7 16:56:27 2015 UTC,"No I didn't say that, you keep using the Strawman logical fallacy.  What I said was that Taiwan's justice system is imperfect and the people on death row, especially those sentenced from the 80's and 90's do have sentencing that may be politically oriented and unjust. Back in the early 90's, confessions through beatings and torture was common practice. In the 80's and 70's it was standard procedure. Many of the people on death row in Taiwan come from this era and are still only guilty through confessions extracted by torture. In common law nations like the USA, if a detective is found to have extracted confessions through torture, all of his cases will then be deemed suspect and may qualify for retrial. In Taiwan, such is not effectively the case."

Furthermore, the only reason we do it is really because we want shit out of Japan. Notice once the fishing rights around the Senkaku's was signed, the next day they tore down the ""Senkaku Islands are ours!"" banners at Taipei Main Station and the comfort women brigade immediately stopped their protest."
taiwan,38lnlc,ShrimpCrackers,1 point,Fri Jun 5 08:07:48 2015 UTC,So how many must be alive for it to be an issue? Is there some threshold of survivors when it stops becoming an issue? When was that met?
taiwan,38lnlc,JillyPolla,5,Fri Jun 5 14:52:32 2015 UTC,"Red herring. Its not really an issue because not only was it over 70 years ago, and that we dont take the USA to task for continuing these comfort stations, but its blatantly obvious we milk the issue to the point where it just makes both sides look bad because a lot of the outrage is more manufactured. Its takes two to make peace but its turned into our holocaust card, and its clear meeting these groups, none of which are really that tied with the actual victims, that short of every Japanese person going extinct in slow perpetual torture and handing everything over, these groups will still probably/not be satisfied. Have you met them? They hate all Japanese people, even the modern day innocents, and there is no space for reconciliation because they literally post about getting vengeance with war.  They've turned into monsters themselves. They're right in that there will never be anything that can make up for it. However even after centuries of hostility and wars, the UK and France are strong allies today and have considered unifying as one nation. I'm not saying we need to go that far, but these guys have tried to sabotage every peace attempt and are not willing to even consider peace (they're against any friendly agreement with Japan, period). Finally most of them are political tools, watching them unpack just as talks began, then packing up moments after Japan agreed to the fishing rights arou d the Senkakus was disgraceful and shows that they're not really honest about their intentions. These guys are all politics, not human rights."
taiwan,38lnlc,ShrimpCrackers,6,Fri Jun 5 16:25:02 2015 UTC,"It is about getting justice for comfort women. The fact that Abe and his cabinet are all affiliated with right-wing comfort women denier shows that there still is a lot to be done. While past governments of Japan did apologize for the issue, the comfort women issue is still very contentious. You bring up holocaust, but the nation of Germany (fringe neo-Nazi group notwithstanding) has generally accepted the history and their fault in the perpetration of it. The nation of Japan has not done that, just from the fact that there is still a non-fringe significant group who would seek to even deny things like comfort women and Nanking Massacre. Abe himself has denied comfort women and seek to recant the previous apology. When you have somebody like that representing your country, it is not hard to see why people are unsatisfied.   All the other Sankaku Island whatever are the red herring that people use to dismiss the cause. How many more comfort women survivors must pass away before they get the justice they seek?"
taiwan,38lnlc,JillyPolla,5,Fri Jun 5 16:33:55 2015 UTC,"Except the people doing this don't care two shits about justice nor human rights.  Ma is a 228 apologist and his administration has hand picked people that are white washing not only 228 but the White Terror from student textbooks. I wished the KMT would go as far as the Japanese government did to apologize, except they have people saying that talking about 228 is ""racism"" and that its a ""DPP invention"". As much as they support Comfort women, they also ran brothels and had associates (their gangster princelings) participating in human trafficking and pimping. Please, they don't care.  Anyway if it really was about justice, then these groups would not keep moving their goalposts. They've made it impossible because its advantageous for them to not have peace. Furthermore as I said, most of these groups in actuality have nothing to do with the actual comfort women .They're not out for justice, they're out for vengeance and political points.  If you started a legitimate organization with clear goals and a viable peace option, I would not only join but donate to the cause and help out. But these groups are not it."
taiwan,38lnlc,ShrimpCrackers,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:33:44 2015 UTC,"Wait, we're talking about 228 now? But I will humor you. How can you say Ma is a 228 apologist, but he has publicly addressed this issue.   And exactly which group are you referring to? The leading group is Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation, which is a non-profit. They just want a formal apology and compensation for the survivors. Are you saying that they're merely a front for the government to bash Japan with? Like I said before, you can't really have a nation's Prime Minister deny something like this without angering former survivors and their descendants. Imagine if Angela Merkel denied the Holocaust, do you really think Israelis would be satisfied?"
taiwan,38lnlc,JillyPolla,2,Fri Jun 5 17:42:20 2015 UTC,"Ma said we don't have the ""truth"" about 228 yet, that Chiang Kai Shek should be excused for it. And they're white washing student textbooks over 228. Actions speak a lot louder than works. Remember in 2006 when Ma was defending the KMT for carrying out 228? That's some  ""addressing"". Under Ma we've had a regression on that, and transitional justice seems farther than before he took power. The difference between Japan is at least Japan is opening up greatly on these fronts while the KMT just wants to shut the lid on it. The consensus in Japan among their legislators is how to apologize and how to deal with it, not how to cover it up or white wash it.  They already got multiple formal apologies and compensations. They keep insisting they didn't, sometimes after taking the money. It's shady. Furthermore, Abe contests the high end estimates of the numbers, they're all made up anyway, no one knows how much there really were. That's far from denial.  Anyway it's telling when the guy who has the power but won't force his party to open up their files on 228. He won't speak out against senior members of his party white-washing and downplaying 228 and the White Terror and has supported textbook changes that whitewash 228 and the White Terror. At the same time he supposedly cares so much about Taiwanese people that he will be upset over comfort women and other stuff. It's really two faced and we all know why."
taiwan,38lnlc,ShrimpCrackers,2,Fri Jun 5 17:45:28 2015 UTC,"From the article you posted:   ""I apologized to the victims and their families because there were many injustices""  “Of course [Chiang] was responsible ... He was the national leader, and he should bear responsibility for what happened. I’ve never denied that,   And I don't see how you can see him promise to recover the truth of the event and still say that he's an apologist.  Source on the double dipping? From what I can tell, the compensatory mechanism is through Asian Women's Fund. To date, only 266 women have applied for compensation (of ~$17K USD each). Many object to this, because the condition for accepting compensation is to hold Japanese government faultless. The compensation is not through the Japanese government, but a private organization.  And then you also have Abe who wants to recant the apology, which is why even to this day the controversy continues."
taiwan,38lnlc,JillyPolla,4,Fri Jun 5 18:04:05 2015 UTC,"Yes but then Ma finishes the rest of his speech saying Chiang shouldn't be judged by 228. I mean come on. That's like saying, ""Yeah I'm not going to be racist, but...""  We already have the truth about 228. Note how his administration and as former chairman he still will NOT open up and release all the documents regarding 228. The Japanese have. The people calling for the truth on the KMT side are not the ones asking to open up the documents, but they're the ones trying to downplay 228 by saying it didn't happen or was a ""DPP Conspiracy"".  Abe has not recanted any apology, there's a huge difference between ""Propaganda on what the evil Abe will do"" on the same style of ""Obama the evil Muslim"" (we just roll our eyes) versus the fact that President Ma still has not ordered the KMT to release everything they have on 228 and the White Terror period. At least the Japanese have. Huge difference.  PS: Like I said, if YOU are willing to spearhead a proper Comfort Women's Justice group, I am all for it. My main qualm is these groups are more for ""supporting the ROC"" and winning political points than really representing Taiwan in this issue. I've met them personally and a lot of them are distasteful and racist people, they're not actually championing anyone's rights or for justice. They're too politically intertwined and none of them are actually neutral politically."

taiwan,38m81j,vigernere1,2,Fri Jun 5 04:56:31 2015 UTC,"There's a long, detailed thread at www.chinese-forums.com about studying at the MTC. The thread has posts from 2011 up to 2015, and I recommend it to anyone studying at the MTC.  The ""normal"" intensive program at MTC typically covers one chapter every ~4 days; I'm not sure if the summer intensive program differs from that pace, if at all. Assuming that it doesn't, you would cover ~10 chapters. Previously, that would have covered most of the chapters in one of the old PAVC books (~10-14 chapters in PAVC books 1-3, 20 chapters in book five). The MTC is using new books now, which I believe have slightly more chapters, but otherwise are similar in total vocabulary/grammar as the old PAVC books.  As to your question, re: skipping a year's worth of study in college, I think it's possible, but probably a stretch for an average student. You definitely should be able to skip a semester, though. The pace of study at the MTC is more intense than an average college course AFAIK, and if you are diligent both inside and outside of the classroom, you can make a lot of progress very quickly.  One final thought: have you been studying traditional characters (繁體字)? If not, then this is the biggest hurdle you will face at the MTC, by far. (I'm assuming your Chinese classes in college are conducted entirely in Chinese. If not, then this something else which might also be challenging for you at the MTC, but you will adjust very quickly)."

On the 7th floor of the MTC there is a large bulletin board where local Taiwanese people often post looking for English/Mandarin language exchange. (I guess you can have Mandarin/Cantonese language exchange too).  I don't think many students have private tutors outside of class.  You certainly could take supplemental lessons at a private school, but I think you'll have plenty of school work to keep you busy in the intensive program."

taiwan,38j735,middayramadanbuffet,3,Fri Jun 5 00:15:31 2015 UTC,"There are more details to the proposed regulations in this article from the Liberty Times, but what they amount to is: hikers must have a GPS unit and/or hiking beacon, there should no longer be solo hikers, and/or hikers must have a guide.  I can kind of understand this for Nantou, being that the region definitely is not safe for beginner solo hikers (or just beginner hikers in general). However, I'm not sure how necessary they are for all people. That being said, how would regulators differentiate between or determine those with enough skill to take on the mountains alone?  My opinion is just that people that are dumb enough to go hiking without adequate skill and end up injured/dead should be allowed to seek (or have others seek on their behalf) damages from government agencies.  The wider reaching implications of this could be bad for hikers. I mean, what if this proposal catches the ears of other counties/cities?  (The rest of this might be considered a rant, but I'd like to start a discussion.)  This reminds me of when that one South African got lost in Wulai and the police had to go find him. Luckily, that one ended with him being found, though he reportedly had inadequately prepared for his hike. If he had suffered injury as a ""result of"" police not finding him quickly enough, would he then have been allowed to sue? Would he have sued? My question isn't to differentiate foreigners from Taiwanese, but just in general.  Stuff like this just makes me angry. It's like in 2012, there were four people who drowned at Shalun Beach, in Tamsui, because they didn't know how to swim. Then, the beach had concrete posts erected and it was then ""shut down"" (though that doesn't really prevent all people from going there).

So something negative   Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) made the call on the eve of the 26 anniversary of the 1989 incident during which China launched military suppression of the student-led democratic movement in Beijing.  Different estimates put the number of deaths from the military crackdown at between hundreds and thousands.  The top China policy planner, however, praised China for taking the initiative in an important meeting of the Communist Party of China last year to protect the people' personal and political rights and the rights to property.   Something positive   The MAC said that mainland China should make greater efforts to push forward political reforms, respect diverse opinions and treat its human rights activists fairly because all these are fundamental to promoting social harmony and stability as well as improving the people's wellbeing.  Over the past seven-odd years, the government of the Republic of China has taken advantage of institutionalized cross-strait talks to beam the universal values of democracy and freedom to the mainland, it said.  The MAC said that both Taiwan the mainland, based on their hard-earned mutual trust, should continue to engage in ""mutual upgrading"" of themselves, allowing their people to share the core values of freedom, democracy, rule of law and peace and prosperity.    An attempt to say that both sides should 'upgrade themselves' and share the same values, by which the MAC means ROC values.  I.e. it's all rather carefully calibrated and diplomatic.

It essentially insures that each country retains sovereignty over its Internet as far as disallowing fees on electronic deliveries between countries, overriding laws that would force other countries to establish local service centers in order to operate in another country, and disallow requirements that source code be made available to a country in which one would want to do business.   In other words, its intention appears to be such that no country would be able to gain an unfair advantage for local electronic service providers by legally mandating onerous conditions of local operation.   It's intended to level the playing field between electronic businesses between participating countries. How this will play out in the long run is hard to see, but the text as written seems fairly innocuous.   What would be more concerning are the provisions in some of the other documents. But even then, much of it seems to be more of a way to reduce paperwork and restrictions on traveling professionals (i.e. near universal 90 day working visa, eased restrictions on spousal travel, etc.)  Am I misreading this or what? Other than the secrecy involved (the text is far from final, so I can understand why they wouldn't want it to be cut apart before it's even finished) I don't understand the conspiracy theories and whatnot.

If you really don't think that the fact we're only learning about the content of the trade agreement from Wikileaks is a problem, or that the representatives who are supposed to be voting on this has not been informed of anything, then I don't know what to tell you. I get that these trade agreements kind of have to be conducted behind closed doors, as it involves many nations. But the people of these partner nations are not being participants AT ALL, and we're expected to just vote yes/no on this?  There will only be 60 days after the finalization of the actual content to vote to accept or reject in whole. There's no chance for our representative to even have any say on the provisions. So basically this will be casted in the light of: ""why are you against trade for Taiwan with other developed nations? Are you an isolationists"" (which is already happening right in this thread), when in fact people are objecting not necessarily to a trade agreement, but to the lack of involvement on the part of the people."

Same with laws and many other things that affect people daily and which most of us are largely ignorant of.  If you check the classification information, on a few pages it's listed as Level 1.4(b), which comes from E.O. 12958, which states that documents involving high level talks with other countries may be classified except to people of a certain level within the respective countries. In the states, members of the government services are given a GS-Level that corresponds to what sorts of information they might be privy to.  It's posted on Wikileaks, which is fantastic, and allows a level of discussion that previously would have been unheard of throughout history as far as the ability for non-government officials to sideline guess what's going on at the highest levels. However, the day-to-day business of government officials certainly lacks the level of transparency many would like. There are perfectly reasonable explanations for that (state secrets, national security, etc.) Just because something is conducted behind closed doors does not mean it is a conspiracy.  Also, it's important to note that Taiwan has a representative at these talks. Who it is, I don't know, but they are clearly being represented, and under reasonable assumption, by a government official of some sort. There's no calls against isolationism, but closer US-European-Taiwanese ties seems to be a reasonable hope as a counterbalance against China, who is specifically excluded from these talks. Perhaps they are classified so the Chinese aren't able to read the text and use them as an indication that the US is betraying the One China policy..... and perhaps these leaks might damage US interests regarding Chinese diplomacy.....

And again, I'm still looking for specific examples of how the contents ""do not look good"". I've read about half of them posted at Wikileaks and, as I said in another post, they look like they are primarily intended to reduce paperwork foremost, and to insure that services between countries won't be unilaterally restricted via laws.  I can understand being wary because the implications of this leveling of barriers are hard to ascertain but there isn't anything that jumps out as particularly nefarious here (for instance quotas). My point is that instead of spreading FUD it would be nice to point out a concrete instance of where a clause within the agreement would, theoretically or otherwise, harm Taiwan."

Given the NSA and GCHQ backdoors found in everything, this makes it hard to guard against those   Article 9.1 of e-Commerce Annex: No Party may require a service supplier, as a condition for supplying a service or investing in its territory, to: (a) use computing facilities located in the Party’s territory.   This makes it so that countries cannot mandate computing facilities in a territory, which again means that personal data will be free flowing  From the financial services annex, the content would be declassified:   five years from entry into force of the TISA agreement or, if no agreement enters into force, five years from the close of the negotiations   So regulations regarding global finance are a secret until it is entered into.   Article 3.1 of financial services Annex: Each Party shall inscribe in its Schedule, pursuant to Article I-3 of the Agreement, a commitment with respect to the supply of financial services through commercial presence; and the supply of financial services listed in Article X.8 [cross-border trade] with respect to the supply of a financial service from the territory of one Party into the territory of any other Party, or in the territory of one Party to the service consumer of any other Party.   Basically, banking interests would be able to establish across any nations, and operating in any nation should be just like opeating domestically  The rule aim to ‘discipline’ governments in favour of a light handed and self-regulatory model of financial regulation. The substantive rules target what the financial services industry sees as obstacles to its seamless global operations, including:   limits on the size of financial institutions (too big to fail); restrictions on activities (eg deposit taking banks that also trade on their own account); requiring foreign investment through subsidiaries (regulated by the host) rather than branches (regulated from their parent state); requiring that financial data is held onshore; limits on funds transfers for cross-border transactions (e-finance); authorisation of cross-border providers; state monopolies on pension funds or disaster insurance; disclosure requirements on offshore operations in tax havens; certain transactions must be conducted through public exchanges, rather than invisible over-the counter operations; approval for sale of ‘innovative’ (potentially toxic) financial products; regulation of credit rating agencies or financial advisers; controls on hot money inflows and outflows of capital; requirements that a majority of directors are locally domiciled; authorisation and regulation of hedge funds; etc."

That's the kind of 'smoking gun' I was looking for and didn't really see.  But with that in mind, there's little that can be done at this point in time because the actual treaty has yet to be presented to any appropriate government figure for review (i.e. an elected official whose name is known). Unfortunately at this point you can only build a consensus among voters on a case-by-case basis in the hopes that, once the treaty is available for legislative review, a grassroots campaign opposing it can quickly be organized to convince elected officials to shoot it down."

Obviously the sunflowers don't all agree with each other regarding free trade (some are against free trade entirely, some are just upset about the process) but I don't think it's at all surprising, or indicative of some sort of intellectual failing, that people are warier of a trade deal with China than one with the US.

Public and private Taiwanese schools require a teaching license (through a teaching degree or substitute license), though it doesn't have to be English education, in order to teach at schools. Buxiban generally require a degree, so your English BA would be fine for that.   If you have TESOL certification or a substitute certificate, some actual schools, not buxiban, will look at you. I can't speak to how far experience goes versus a teaching degree in that respect. Generally, I've seen schools go Teaching MS > English BS > Teaching BS > TESOL Certification/Substitute. I can tell you that my teaching experience and content area (secondary English) get me around the same pay as MS degrees for Private/Public schools; when I started, I would get entry level for teaching degrees while a master's was definitely higher."

If you are not returning soon or if the sum of money is large, then a wire transfer from a TW bank to a US bank is the best option.  If you don't have a Taiwanese bank account, you can open one for free at most banks or at the post office. I believe you can open an account with just a passport, but I'm not sure. (It may vary by bank). If you decide to open a Taiwanese bank account, bring a Taiwanese friend with you if you don't speak Mandarin well.   Before performing a wire transfer at a Taiwanese bank:   Verbally verify with your US bank that wire transfers are routed directly to the bank, and that they are not first routed to an intermediate bank.  Look up your bank's SWIFT code online. If the name of the bank associated with the SWIFT code does not match your bank, then in fact funds will be routed to an intermediate bank. (It's important to know this when filling out the wire transfer form at the Taiwanese bank).   When you are ready to perform a wire transfer, bring the following with you to the bank:   Passport, Taiwanese ARC card (if you have one), Taiwanese phone number, and Taiwanese address on file with the bank Taiwanese bank passbook and debit card US bank details: name, address, telephone number, routing number (also know as an ABA routing number), and SWIFT code. Also your account type and account number. (If you've successfully executed a wire transfer at the Taiwanese bank before, bring the paperwork from that last transfer. This will help the teller fill out the paperwork for the new transfer (assuming the information has not changed).   The Taiwanese bank will charge a wire transfer fee. At my bank it is $600, which can be debited from the available funds in your Taiwanese account. On the US side, my bank does not charge any fee for receiving the incoming funds. In my experience the Taiwanese bank will be super, super particular about having all the information on the form be 100% correct. Thus, be sure to write very legibly and clearly. If you make a mistake when writing a piece of information, simply strike it out, write the correct information, and initial the change you made. Lastly, there was data on the form which, although the bank teller calculated it (e.g., the total amount to be debited from my account), I was required to write the data on the form myself. This information (mostly numbers) was said to me verbally in Chinese. So again, if you don't speak good Chinese, bringing a Taiwanese friend is a good idea.  Ninja edit: on the wire transfer form, write your name exactly as it appears on your passport or ARC card (on a US passport, your surname is listed first, followed by your first name and middle name (if you have one)."

From what I understand, after Level 2 for native speakers, some students begin courses on a little bit of newspaper reading.   During orientation you will be interviewed one on one by a person to determine if you'll be put into the native speakers course.  My class had speakers of various levels.  There were perfectly fluent speakers (born in China/Taiwan) but never learned to read/write, then there are ABCs like me that wasn't as fluent  that grew up speaking mixed Chinese/English to parents.  If you can hold a basic conversation and understand the interviewer, you'll be put into the same courses.

Did you enjoy your time in Taiwan?"
taiwan,38gu6y,dajackal,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:31:03 2015 UTC,"Just like me, I took time out of work to learn Chinese the right way!  You should have no problem getting into a full class with other speakers.  Last semester there were 3 full classes of native speakers (about 21-24 students total) in the intensive course (3 hrs/day).  You will definitely reach another level here after 3 months of intense study.  It feels pretty good to be able to mostly read menus now (still needs effort though.)  My vocabulary has definitely expanded.  Listening has improved, before everything on the news just went over my head, but now I can get the general meaning, even though there are still words I don't fully know.  Learning new characters feels faster now too, so I felt like they really give you a solid foundation here.  I definitely enjoyed my time here.  Everyone's experience will differ, It depends on the individual. Some people I've met love it here enough to stay permanently, others like myself are over it after a few months.  My only advice to make the best usage of your time is to NOT hang out with your classmates too much.  You're likely to be placed in the native speaker class, and it's common for all of you to still default to using English because more than likely that will be most of your comfortable native tongue.  I've met ABCs that have lived in Taipei for 2-3 years where their Chinese was still awful because they continue to use English with other ABCs and expats.  Make friends with locals.  7th floor has a bunch of language exchange postings too for you to meet locals.   That way you will be forced to speak Chinese as much as possible.  Even outside the bulletin boards you'll find its easy to make friends in TW.  A lot of people have a general interest in foreigners.  Good luck and have fun, I'm generally excited for your experience.   :]"

But that depends on how they view their employees, where usually the mainlanders get the worst treatment.  (3) They don't pay that well.  Expats may not get the worst treatment, and usually get paid better than the Taiwanese, HK'er, mainlander coworkers."
taiwan,38d3ee,just_face,4,Wed Jun 3 16:25:45 2015 UTC,"Many places are not that bad, but the pay thing is a major pain point if you are stuck in Taiwan while watching salaries explode practically everywhere else.  Even in China the salaries are much better, which represents a major threat to Taiwanese industry, moreso than crazy Silicon Valley salaries."

taiwan,38d3ee,rousimarpalhares_,2,Wed Jun 3 17:37:43 2015 UTC,"A friend of mine (foreigner) got to work for HTC for more than 3 years.  On his first day at work, he saw everyone standing up at 6PM and thought ""oh cool, people work reasonable hours here!"". Nope. They were all going to have a quick dinner before going back and working until 10PM.  Not to mention their business was basically ""Oh wait! Apple just announced this new feature in their phone! Stop anything you are doing and develop a clone of that!"". No need to tell you when the buggy HTC clone appeared 6-8 months after the Apple feature, no one gave a shit."
taiwan,38d3ee,ShrimpCrackers,2,Thu Jun 4 07:06:54 2015 UTC,Apple is usually copying Android though. The only thing that I can think of recently that has been a copy is the gold color thing. Very tacky IMO. Apple is desperate enough to try to appeal to noveau rich Chinese people?     I used to work at a copy that produced all types of games. During the time I was there I transferred from one floor to another. The culture on one floor was completely different than the other. In the first one if I left at 6 it would be pretty normal. A group of people would actually race to get to the lunchroom first. On the other floor it would be a huge violation of floor culture or whatever.
taiwan,38d3ee,singularCat,2,Thu Jun 4 07:50:33 2015 UTC,"There's a reason no one wants to work at HTC.

taiwan,38d3ee,rousimarpalhares_,6,Wed Jun 3 17:40:57 2015 UTC,"Of course, but Foxconn's suicide rate is actually lower than the US industry average. They have unwarranted bad PR. The conditions at Foxconn is far greater than the vast majority of companies in China. The person making the original allegations was discredited as lying (it also gave a lot of PR for his performance act and he admitted it), the paper that made the allegations retracted it, and independent reputable third party inspectors said the working conditions at Foxconn was actually very good.  Since you're a professional and not going to be line factory worker, if you come to Taiwan I should show you pictures of their campus for their engineers and managers. I wish I got a free luxury highrise apartment with floor to ceiling windows. Foxconn actually treats its professionals quite well."
taiwan,38d3ee,ShrimpCrackers,3,Wed Jun 3 17:55:26 2015 UTC,"I've heard stories from a previous coworker that the CEO of Foxconn is a dick. He said that he (the CEO) would call people up late at night just to listen to make them listen to him talk about nothing. He also said he basically does not value employees time and generally just treats them like shit. But yes, the salaries at Foxconn are above market averages.  Also if you take a look at glassdoor.com not a single Taiwanese company (I think) has more than 3.5 star rating. Most are below 3. To add to skyanvil's comment Taiwanese bosses believe that workers are merely expenses and that one is replaceable with another. Flexible hours is not a thing. They want to see you in your seat more or less just to satisfy their ego.     I don't think much will change until that generation of people die."
taiwan,38d3ee,LumpyLump76,6,Wed Jun 3 18:03:30 2015 UTC,"Also if you take a look at glassdoor.com not a single Taiwanese company (I think) has more than 3.5 star rating.   Actually TSMC, MediaTek, ChinaTrust Bank, Nvidia, Zappos, Garmin, Delta Electronics, Realtek are 3.8, 3.7, 3.6, 3.8, 3.7, 3.7, 3.7 and 3.7 respectively on Glassdoor. There's many more (such as LandBank which got 4.0) but I wanted to put in companies that everyone recognizes. Compare that to IBM, HSBC, Microsoft and Apple which are 3.0, 3.4, 3.8 and 4.0 respectively. The average rating on Glassdoor is just 3.4. Note that very few Taiwanese use Glassdoor so most of these ratings for Taiwanese companies are for American engineers that could be paid a lot more in the USA or Europe...  Note also that many international companies also have offices in Taiwan. Google is hiring and they're based in Taipei 101 and they have a 4.4 Glassdoor rating.  Also, your stereotypical description of Taiwanese bosses is generally true of any at-will employment nation. While Taiwan employment isn't entirely at-will, this is the reality in any market where there is an abundance of said majors in a capitalistic society. If you're in a STEM major, in the right specialization, you'll find people talking to you with a lot more respect versus, say, sales."

Why pound the pavement when you could start making money right off the bat, and have someone else cover some of your startup costs?

taiwan,386ltf,davidonformosa,9,Tue Jun 2 05:41:10 2015 UTC,"Full text for those who can't jump the paywall:   For more than three decades, the U.S.-Taiwan relationship has served as a cornerstone of peace and stability in Asia. There is no question that the United States will be Taiwan’s most important strategic partner. But Taiwan must also expand our contributions toward a more promising future for the region.  As a vibrant democracy, Taiwan is situated within an exciting yet intricate and ever-evolving security and economic environment. To successfully navigate this arena, Taiwan will need to articulate an open and forward-looking strategy for the future. This agenda is fundamentally premised on robust economic, defense and people-to-people relationships with the U.S., in parallel with a comprehensive and principled engagement with China.  I believe that Taiwan’s foreign policy requires a four-pronged approach: first, broadening multifaceted cooperation with the U.S.; second, identifying and participating in international projects that Taiwan can support for the benefit of the world community; third, protecting Taiwan’s economic autonomy through trade diversification; and fourth, enhancing principled cooperation with China.  The net impact of this strategy will not only depend on the successful execution of each pillar, but on how we are able to draw linkages between the four elements and put forth a comprehensive paradigm for Taiwan’s international role. As I have stated time and again, a strong, comprehensive and enduring partnership with the U.S. is a fundamental characteristic of Taiwan’s overall national-security identity. Along these lines, I am committed to enhancing cooperation on joint training, exercises and defense-industrial cooperation.  In addition to strengthening our already extensive ties in these traditional security areas, it is equally important for Taiwan to support the region’s capabilities to address nontraditional security threats, highlighted by the growing challenges presented by climate change and the increasing frequency of natural disasters across the Asia-Pacific. I am committed to advancing an open dialogue with the U.S., China, Japan, South Korea and other like-minded nations on how we can fortify the region’s humanitarian and natural-disaster relief architecture and capabilities.  Beyond security cooperation, I believe that the diversification of our economic ties will prove equally critical in charting the course ahead for U.S.-Taiwan relations. Already, with more than $63 billion worth of goods in bilateral trade last year, Taiwan ranks as America’s 10th-largest trading partner today. As Taiwan seeks to diversify its drivers of growth in the next phase of our economic development, we must work to establish robust economic linkages throughout the world, attract long-term foreign investment and cultivate our human capital.  As a first step toward this goal, Taiwan must articulate a stronger trade agenda, which will necessitate changes in how we conduct business and establish strong frameworks to bolster investor confidence. In the near term, ensuring that Taiwan is ready for future candidacy into the Trans-Pacific Partnership and other regional economic agreements will be an important cornerstone of my economic policy. Adhering to international standards, reducing bureaucratic red-tape and streamlining our investment processes are all integral components of this policy fabric that will make Taiwan more nimble, globally competitive and attractive to investment.  Taiwan’s integration into regional trade partnerships and investment agreements will catalyze its broader participation in international projects and efforts. As a responsible citizen of the global community, Taiwan already strives to adhere to numerous international standards and frameworks, including those in which Taiwan is not a member.  As Taiwan seeks more meaningful participation in the international arena, it has developed a number of capabilities and skill-sets that it can contribute to the broader knowledge base of the international community. For example, as a leading hub for the high-tech industry, Taiwan is well-positioned to support the development of international trade standards and regulations on cutting-edge, 21st-century trade issues, such as data flows and intellectual-property standards.  Underpinning all of these aims, a more consistent and sustainable relationship with China will be a core goal of my administration. That requires open channels of communication, both with China’s leadership and the Taiwanese people. Last March’s Sunflower Movement—when activists took over the legislature to protest the lack of transparency in the review of a trade agreement with China—demonstrates what can result when the Taiwanese people feel they have been left out of the discussion.  My priority will be to implement a transparent process to enhance trust and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait. Through principled engagements, joint initiatives and dialogue, I will ensure that the spirit of cooperation that has guided the betterment of China-Taiwan relations continues.  Thirty-six years ago, the U.S. Congress enacted the Taiwan Relations Act that captured the essence of our partnership with the United States. Through six U.S. administrations, both Republican and Democratic, we have continued to sustain this historic friendship through extensive economic and security cooperation. I have no doubt that our mutual interests in the region’s peace and prosperity will further strengthen these bonds and ensure that they will endure for many decades to come."

If something small happen in Taiwan, it'll be on the front page and one of the dozens of 24 hour news stations.   When people see Taiwanese legislators fight, they think Taiwanese politics is a mess. But what about the whole Bo Xilai affair? That's basically China's version of political violence, yet the public aren't privy to the internal power struggles within China.   Then they see Taiwanese storming into government building, and they think there's no rule of law. But the public also don't know about the protests happening in China, or how much the rule of law has been harmed, because it's all happening without much fanfare and scrutiny.   So basically the idea that Taiwan and Hong Kong is more chaotic is basically wishful thinking and communist propaganda."

There's actually an awesome game called ""Victoria 2"". It's a complex social-economic simulator / grand strategy game with a learning curve like a brick wall, but it captures the dynamics of this ""I'm confused whether freedom is good or not"" feeling pretty well.

Israel is the second-largest foreign supplier of arms to the People's Republic of China, only after the Russian Federation. China has purchased a wide array of military hardware from Israel, including Unmanned aerial vehicles and communications satellites.   So why does Taiwan always get the shitty hand-me-downs?

No one wants to feed more technology to China, and the US doesn't let Israel get much of the best technology, because they know that Israel will turn around and give it to China, if they think that it will profit Israel in the long run.

What a naval CMS does, is to take different radars, sensors, weapons, countermeasures, et cetera, and enable them to work together in a cohesive fashion, giving the commanding officer the data that s/he needs in order to issue the proper orders, at the proper moment.  The PRC uses a (considerably upgraded in China) older French naval CMS for the PLAN, so once Taiwan figures out all of the programming for itself, then it could make a naval CMS of its own.  Even buying a single example of the Chilean CMS that I was talking about earlier would bridge most, if not all of the gaps that still affect Taiwan.  Of course, Taiwan would also need to have their own Standard/Aster class naval SAM for full effect."

It's sad. All that money for some blueprints. To think we were the first backers of the system and we don't even get to use it.
taiwan,381hk4,BigOrbitalStrike,0,Tue Jun 2 01:03:37 2015 UTC,It was the AEGIS system that was 100% neutralized by Russian ECCM in the Black Sea back in April 2014.  A Russian fighter-bomber was able to make twelve (12!) low level faux-attack runs on the paralyzed ship - had they been real attack runs the entire ship and crew would have been lost and at the bottom of the sea quite trivially.    I wouldn't be surprised if the Chinese could either duplicate or obtain the same technology.  The US has not stuck to the fundamentals when it comes to weapons design and has largely squander both what capabilities it has had and buying systems that are obsolete before delivered (e.g. F35 and Ford-class carriers).  So I'm not sure having an AEGIS system is all that.
taiwan,381hk4,mantrap2,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:01:06 2015 UTC,"The claim that AEGIS was neutralized by Russian ECCM is false.  First of all, the function of ECCM is to counter jamming, and while AEGIS will allow the use of jammers on a ship, AEGIS does not by itself perform ECM."

Not even America has the logistical capability to mount an armored force comprised of MBTs in such an attempt as a part of the initial assault.  There'd be hundreds of amphibs fighting inland long before more than a handful of Abrams lands.  So, the bigger issue, by far, is preventing China from reaching this stage. Strong AD weaponry should be the prime focus.  Also, nice downvoting. Good to see that is the community I'm dealing with here."
taiwan,381hk4,ihatehappyendings,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:24:20 2015 UTC,"Of course taking small islands would be different from taking Taiwan.  What do you take me for?  The thing that should be more worrying for you is that the ability to take those islands is only a stepping stone towards taking Taiwan, when/if the PRC decides to do so.  Right now, China is developing STOVL aircraft, and new amphibious assault ships in the mould of the American Wasp class (Type 081 amphibious assault ship), along with proper escorts for them.  Will it take them a few years to do R&D, construction, and training?  Yes, it will.  But when complete, China could deliver 1,068-1,250 troops plus vehicles per ship.  This would have major implications for the Taiwan Strait, as well as Taiwan proper.  Getting back to the tanks, they do more than just fight other tanks (but are very good for tank on tank battles).  They can help support infantry in urban combat, they can provide heavier firepower to help defeat amphibious assaults, they can delay the enemy until additional ground units can get to the location, and they force the PLA to put more time and effort into countermeasures against the tanks.  There is also the matter of spare parts for the M-60 tanks becoming harder and harder to get, as the M-60 is retired, and cut up for scrap metal all over the world.  If your nation is named Taiwan, that just automatically makes it harder for you to get spare parts anyway.  Better to have a tank that compares favorably against what your enemy uses, and you can get parts for."

taiwan,381hk4,JillyPolla,-1,Tue Jun 2 16:48:57 2015 UTC,How would tanks be used in Taiwan? I've always seen it as an air-sea battle.
taiwan,381hk4,SailTheWorldWithMe,-3,Mon Jun 1 11:47:29 2015 UTC,There are two environments in which tanks are poorly suited:   Urban environments Mountainous terrain   Taiwan has both of these in abundance. I'm baffled as to why Taiwanese military leaders thinks this is a good purchase.
taiwan,381hk4,vigernere1,8,Mon Jun 1 11:59:21 2015 UTC,"Actually, tanks are good things to have in urban environments, it has just been the lack of proper urban combat tactics that make people think that ""tanks have no place in urban warfare.""  Remember how the US Navy has various ships surrounding the carrier, all of which contribute to the defense of the carrier?  The same principle applies here.  You could send the tanks in by themselves, but they would take shots from infantry or insurgents.  By the same token, you could send only infantry into a city, but they would just get shot up if the enemy has heavier weapons in that area.  So what you do, is to team infantry up with vehicles like tanks, which can provide heavier firepower, while the infantry protects the tanks by clearing enemy hiding spots.  Both the tanks and infantry mutually support each other, in order to get the job done.  As for mountainous terrain, i'm sure that the ROC Army figured out the best places to put tanks when they were building those top secret bunkers in the mountains."

While urban environments are not suited for tanks, the plains areas are far less densely packed than the big cities and many other areas. I guess if the PRC decided to attack Changhua City, first, then the tanks wouldn't be useful.   My guess is that they'd be stationed near bases along the western coast, near areas without tetrapods (the things that reduce the force of waves hitting shores) and that can be more easily landed upon."

Tanks require a lot of fuel and maintenance, neither of which are insurmountable obstacles, but definitely a consideration.  I didn't know much about Taiwan's air defense capabilities, but this article makes it sound fairly robust, and this article goes into more detail regarding Taiwan's force modernization efforts.

There is a fundamental failure in the logic of the Taipei Times debate article: It's asking whether the death penalty has failed as a deterrent to violent crime, but it could well be that it's acting as a VERY GOOD deterrent, and thus we don't see as much violent crime as there might be if the death penalty was not in place.  There is an inherent danger of wrongly sentencing an innocent person, yes; but if there is absolutely no doubt as to who the murderer is, as in the case today, death penalty in my view carries no moral burden."
taiwan,37xa8y,Roygbiv0415,1 point,Sun May 31 04:33:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, considering the low crime rate in Taiwan, they must be doing something right. Traditionally harsh laws have worked very well in Asian nations, with countries like Japan and Singapore having some of the lowest crime rates in the world.  On the other hand, being so unabashedly pro-death penalty hurts Taiwan's international standing, as many western countries view the practice as barbaric. Some asian nations such as South Korea have also successfully scaled back executions without an accompanying increase in murders. Should Taiwan also make the effort to try and execute less people (while still keeping the death penalty as an option)?  It might be disastrous for Taiwan to quit the death penalty cold turkey, but a gradual scaling back like the Koreans is also an option."
taiwan,37xa8y,Roygbiv0415,6,Sun May 31 06:35:50 2015 UTC,"Taiwan was working towards that, until an event in 2012, where the murderer said ""I checked on the internet, killing one or two people won't get you the death sentence, I'll just spend my life in prison."" followed by: ""If I'm not caught today, I'll keep murdering people until I get caught."" Wikipedia source of the event (Chinese)  The murderer was in fact not sentenced to death in the first trial, and this caused such a huge uproar that not only had the supreme court step in and require a new trial, but also swayed public opinion firmly towards capital punishment in Taiwan.   This had been since reinforced by the random MRT killings last year, when the murderer said: ""My parents had very high expectations of me, it's too tiring, and life is too difficult. I've been planning this since 5th grade, and I have absolutely no regrets in doing so. In fact I feel happy, because my dream had come true. If I have the chance, I will definitely do it again.""

So it seems like random killings are becoming more common (the article mentioned the 2012 incident was the second case of random killings in Taiwan history, yet we just witnessed Kung and Jen in the span of a year).  So my question is, is the death penalty an adequate deterrent for these types of killings? Both Kung and Jen stated they wanted to die (though Jen later recanted, if I'm not mistaken), and I guess these incidents could be construed as a sort of ""suicide by cop"". Then again, as you stated before maybe capital punishment deterred a lot of wannabe killers so only the craziest go through with it."

Does it make a difference then, that the citizens understand the implications of a death sentence as punishment for murder, and confer the right to do so to the state?  I believe the thinking is, once you willingly take the life of someone else, you cease to be ""human"", and thus human rights are no longer applicable. There should be very hard and thorough scrutiny into whether the act was done ""willingly"", but once that is adequately established, then there is no moral burden in doing so.  Does capital punishment reduce crime? Maybe, maybe not. But does it appeal to the Asian culture that ""Bad people should repay for their wrongdoings, instead of living a luxurious and comfortable life in prison""? Most certainly. To see convicted murderers repay for their crime in the ultimate way (殺人償命), is what is expected in east Asian culture, thus it would be difficult to see it go away.   Currently, more than 80% of Taiwanese support capital punishment, while the number within judicial circles is even higher, closer to 90%."

I think this is really the only reason why the Taiwanese public is so supportive of the death penalty. From what I can see, there is very little rational discussion on the merits and demerits of the death penalty. The supporters of the death penalty don't care if it actually deters crime. It ultimately boils down to their belief that ""murderers deserve to die"", and no one bothers to question why. It seems to me the whole ""debate"" on the death penalty is purely fuelled by emotions.   It's also very disheartening to see how some people refuse to take mental disorders seriously and believe they are just ""an excuse for murderers to get away from what they deserve"".

taiwan,37xa8y,x3nomik,2,Mon Jun 1 07:32:26 2015 UTC,"My opinion:  (1) I'm not against Death Penalty.  Rationally, there are crimes where the magnitude would warrant a death penalty.    The chief argument against that is that society should do better jobs in prevention and detection, so to prevent severe crimes.  A death penalty is sometimes seen as society's way of punishing people who are victims of social ills and society's irresponsibility.  That counter argument is true to a point.  It is very possible for some to be driven to heinous crimes.  However, punishment is not the only reason for the justice system, which should be used to rehabilitate criminal behavior.    If a crime is so severe that it cannot be seen that the criminal can ever rehabilitate him/herself, then there is no point for rehabilitation, and the death penalty may be the only reasonable and rational option.  (2) Life sentences (or severely long sentences) often are more inhumane and torturous than a quick death penalty, since in such options, there is no expectation of rehabilitation.  (3) The only caveat I have with Death Penalty is that, society should not implement ""painless deaths"", because doing so does not reduce pain for the condemned (how could anyone know if the condemned didn't suffer?).  There are law cases, where the condemned survived 2 or 3 botched executions, and were then let go, because it was thought that more executions would be considered ""cruel and inhumane"".  Logically, it makes no sense, if 1 execution is ""painless"", then why would 2 or 3 or more be considered ""cruel and inhumane""?  If nothing else, the 1st execution should be considered the most painful.  Modern ""painless deaths"" are more to reduce the pain of the society, as an excuse that somehow executions are ""painless"", thus to lessen the moral guilt of killing a person.  Doing so only de-sensitizes society, and make society more willing to reach for the death penalty more casually.  US in the 1950's onward had a lot of death sentences issued on flimsy evidence.  This is very wrong, because the justice system treats the death penalty too lightly.  If one must issue the death penalty, then one should have the courage to confront execution.  Only then, society can fully understand how serious death penalty is."

Widespread support for the death penalty makes a lot more sense when you consider that most people have no problem with unauthorized police searches and the presence of surveillance cameras everywhere, and that a surprising amount of people think that corporal punishment should be brought back in schools. People are generally okay with any kind of violence as long as it's handed down from an authority that they view as legitimate.  2) Many people believe that the goal of punishment should be about retribution and causing pain, not about deterrence or rehabilitation. I firmly believe that, even if evidence emerges suggesting that the death penalty would actually lead to a higher crime rate, people will still be in favor of it because ""justice."" I remember seeing an internet poll a few months back, in which people were asked in which way they most wanted Taiwan to become more like Singapore. The top choice by the respondents was caning. People would rather see delinquents be caned in public than for everyone to be able to enjoy low-cost housing. Think about that.  3) Taiwanese people love a victim narrative. Because so many families of murder victims go on TV news crying about how they'll never again feel safe or at peace until they see their loved one's killer dead, the death penalty has become a ""right"" for the victim's family. Whether the family members actually want this ""right"" or not.  (I don't know if you know the name 洪慈庸, who is the sister of a young man who died two years ago after suffering inhumane punishment when doing the national service. She is now running for a legislative seat in Taichung, and a few months ago she came out publicly against the death penalty. A tidal wave of disappointed ""I can't believe you're one of them"" comments ensued. Not even the sister of a man who was literally killed by state violence can express an opinion against state violence. That's how deeply ingrained it is.)"

The top choice by the respondents was caning. People would rather see delinquents be caned in public than for everyone to be able to enjoy low-cost housing. Think about that.   :-O  I'm shocked by this.  Thanks for your comment, though, it's very interesting."

For example, Malaysia has a disproportionally high rate of psychotic outburst killing sprees, the northwest United States has disproportionally more cases of humans eating other humans. It's weird as fuck, doesn't make it common and absolutely does not mean every person in that region is like that, it's just a weird chain of events tied to specific areas.

Using me as an example: I have large eyes, a big nose, dark skin, big boobs and ass. Even when I was little, people always though I was foreign. Even though I can speak Taiwanese and Chinese. The first day of junior high, the teacher was doing a survey. He asked the aboriginal students to raise their hands, everyone turned around and looked at me. I didn't raise my hand. The teacher asked multiracial students to raise their hands, everyone turned around and looked at me, again. I still didn't raise my hand. Finally, the teacher asked foreign students to raise their hands. I didn't raise my hand at all. Someone yelled ""why don't you raise you hands?"". I was confused. ""I'm Taiwanese. Like all of you."" The kid said ""No, you are not!"" I replied ""What do you think I am then?"" He said ""I thought you were half black.""  That doesn't stop there, throughout my life, I was asked ""which country are you from? 你哪國人啊？"" constantly. Even after speaking to me in both Taiwanese and Chinese. I can pull out my passport, ID, birth certificate, and family tree book家譜, Taiwanese still see me as an outsider.   So you see, as long as you look some what different from the majority of Taiwanese, you are going to be treated differently. Even if you can prove that you were born and raised here."

I had the exactly same experience: even after a year people invite you to a beach trip so they can attract girls by having a white guy there. When these girls couldn't come, I was uninvited because ""there is no point in bringing you when the girls don't come anyway"". I had an amazing time and still love Taiwan, but they do make living there for foreigners harder by not allowing foreigners to integrate"
taiwan,37t7uq,ruggar,16,Sat May 30 06:17:06 2015 UTC,"I hate to say this, but it ""living here for 20 years"" will not change how Taiwanese treat you, because it's not your fault. Truth is, foreigners as a whole, the ones visiting, the ones studying, as well as the ones living here for a long time, together shape the way Taiwanese people perceive foreigners as a whole. While the numbers of expats in Taiwan is rising, Taiwanese society is still overwhelmingly Taiwanese, and the racial composition is homogeneous enough that any foreigner -- not just Caucasian, we can also tell Japanese, Korean, and Chinese people apart too -- will be easily spotted, and stereotypes applied.  Take the seating issue mentioned for example:   “Often on the MRT, the only empty seat is the one next to mine. Yet when I get up to leave, the seats fill up quickly,”   To be honest, I rarely see this behavior, but the ones I saw were (mostly) Americans who tend to require more personal space, so their body language when seated tends toward a more open gesture, taking up more space next to them. Not all foreigners are so ""inconsiderate"" (in the views of a Taiwnese), but since we can't tell if you're German or American, whether you're just visiting or have lived here for 20 years, the safe (and ""polite"") thing for is just leave the seats for you to enjoy. Yes, this might be called ""racist"" to some extent, but there are no negative intentions, just Taiwanese people hoping to show hospitality to people who looks to be from a culture they do not understand.  Now, I have no experience dealing with banks or businesses as a foreigner (obviously), but I would imagine many bad experiences would come from the simple fact that Taiwanese people don't speak good English. Hell, some Taiwanese don't even speak good Mandarin. My Taiwanese is mediocre at best, so I prefer Mandarin if possible, and guess what? When I asked (as a Taiwanese) for a contact to use Mandarin in a meeting, I also got laughed at and the meeting continued in Taiwanese.  And just as an end note, ""老外"" really, really does not have any negative implications in Taiwan. Yes, it categorizes you, and may be offending for long time residents and naturalized citizens, but it is not derogatory. It's no different from calling a colleague ""老王"" or ""老陳"", just a general description of a foreigner that is actually more cordial than 外國人 or 外國朋友。"

He finally snapped out of it, he then said ""Wow, you speak really good Chinese for an Indian.""  So I've been told I look half-black, aboriginal Taiwanese, Indian, and Thai."

taiwan,37t7uq,meimeiw,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:33:13 2015 UTC,It's sad that I felt more accepted in a small town in American Midwest than in Taiwan. People didn't question where I was from constantly (probably because I'm really good at picking up accent).
taiwan,37t7uq,meimeiw,4,Mon Jun 1 04:57:05 2015 UTC,"If we first brush racism issues aside, and just discuss the term ""外國人"" on its own, I think it is important for any language to be first and foremost clear in communications. Suppose there are 20 people outside the ramen shop, three being Caucasian (or Black). Wouldn't referring to these individuals as ""those three white men"", ""those three black men"", or ""those three foreigners"" the most straightforward and and clear way of referring to those individuals, with the least possibility of error?  Now, I can say that's probably just the way things are, because the Chinese, throughout history, had been more or less impervious to the idea of ""racism"" as the west. Everyone looks alike, uses the same language, and identifies as Chinese. Even the majority of Taiwanese branching off and identifying as Taiwanese rather Chinese is a very recent phenomenon. Under such situations, we don't hold any specific grudge against any other race -- You are all alien. There's no racism in calling a person black, or foreign, in Taiwan, because there isn't. It's just a label to identify a person easily, no different from ""the guy in the red shirt"" or ""the girl in short hair"". It just happens that your ""foreign"" complexion makes it the easiest descriptor to notice, and nothing more.  Honestly, I often do feel that westerners, particularly the Americans with their special history, takes the idea of ""racism"" too far. If everyone can agree calling someone ""black"" or ""foreign"" as just a identifying descriptor, with no additional hidden meaning or emotions attached, the world would be a much simpler and happier place."
taiwan,37t7uq,Roygbiv0415,2,Sat May 30 12:48:03 2015 UTC,"But do you really believe that 外國人 is only a physical descriptor? If I use ""the guy in the red shirt"" to describe someone, there is no implied meaning about his character or whether or not he belongs here. Perhaps I've been too sensitive, but it has always seemed to me that 外國人 immediately indicates that a person is not one of us.  It is possible for something to be accurate and descriptive while still being offensive. Outside this hypothetical ramen shop, what if there were two fat people? Would the staff be justified in openly saying ""the fat guys can sit over there""? What about a particularly ugly woman? A man with only one arm? Just because something is the most obvious descriptor does not mean it should be used to indicate a person."
taiwan,37t7uq,wrychime,2,Sat May 30 13:11:34 2015 UTC,"The west does not take ""racism"" too far, but I think there are some folks at Fox News who would love to quote you on it. Taiwan (and since you brough it up, China) continue to be very racists societies because of the shared denial of racism, not the other way around.  This is horse shit:    Everyone looks alike, uses the same language, and identifies as Chinese.   Thinking the labels are completely innocuous is naive, but that might just be because it is the soup you swim in."

Turns out that the word ""mister"" is derogertory in the second person's language, but to the first person it's just a common greeting.  Do you consider the first person to be naive but racist?  In the same vein, if a person who never knew any of the history associated with the word Negro, and uses it casually referring to an African American in conversation, is this person naive but racist?"

Turns out that the word ""mister"" is derogertory in the second person's language, but to the first person it's just a common greeting.   No, it's not like that at all. No one is calling any Taiwanese person ""a racist fuck"" for saying 外國人. Straw man. I'm calling you out for ""Han""-washing Taiwan (and China of all places, what a poor choice on your part), and then pretending it is impossible for Taiwan to be racist because of that completely fictional history and demography you just made up. That's like sticking your head in the sand saying it's night time.   Now back to 外國人。 The labels themselves are not completely benign, and you cannot meaningfully analyze in isolation from the bigger picture.  White Americans get called 外國人 or 美國人 but a black American is 黑人. Ask some Taiwanese to describe a white person they met previously and watch as their hair magically turns blonde. Filipinos and other so-called ""菲傭"" are almost never called 外國人 or 老外. Aboriginals and the word huan-ah.  The clearest example is mixed race Taiwanese. Just wow, it's amazing to watch the cognitive dissonance twist people's logic as their trusty clear cut labels and cultural expectations completely fail to box these people in. Generally they are ascribed to the foreign group, no matter where they were raised.   Yes, the labels are part and parcel of the racism. Yes, a lot of white foreigners are oversensitive to it because of cultural differences. No, white people aren't generally materially hurt by the labelling b/c they are empowered by the racist BS. A lot of other people are disempowered though, and it shows through in the labels plain as day."

Now, I have no experience dealing with banks or businesses as a foreigner (obviously), but I would imagine many bad experiences would come from the simple fact that Taiwanese people don't speak good English.

Disassociate the negative connotations and just accept that it's a means of establishing distinction.  Why does unlucky even come in to play? I'm very happy to come from a country where we at least pay tribute to the idea that everyone is equal, but in our effort to appease everyone, Western culture seems to forget that there are visible differences between races. The fact that this is acknowledged here isn't something to be frowned upon."
taiwan,37t7uq,Leolisk,2,Sat May 30 07:44:18 2015 UTC,"Seriously I don't even know what to say. It means ""not of this place"". Distinction between people looking different is fine. You can tell me I look different all you want. That is not what I am talking about. I was born and raised here, this is my country, I don't come from somewhere else. But the word for ""coming from somewhere else"" is a synonym for how I look. This is not about negative or positive. You can try to justify it all you want, claim cultural relativism. But to single out a certain look, or race, as foreign and refuse to accept (even after knowing someone for years) that a person of that race is nothing but an outsider is ""to be frowned upon""."

taiwan,37t7uq,ShrimpCrackers,16,Sat May 30 11:00:20 2015 UTC,"Ooh looks like someone finally found out what it's like to be like an immigrant and minority. A lot of his gripes seems one-sided and petty though and are no worse than my experience growing up in America. There too, we couldn't get decent loans, got the absolute worst credit cards, most people looked and treated us strangely or as a novel object. But it gets worse, as an Asian person I also made a lot less than my peers, we were attacked physically at some points in our lives for being Asian. While Asian Americans make up 10% of America's professional workforce, we only have a 3% chance of being promoted to the management executive level, individually. The Model Minority myth hurt us quite often because these issues and many more aren't being addressed. I have yet to see him having to deal with any of the latter hardships.  Now I do recognize that there are real problems that need to be solved, but I would also be a lot more sympathetic if this post was from housekeeping/elderly care workers or other migrant worker. But It's funny when I hear this from middle or upper class white people. On the risk of sounding SJW-like, the problem is because there's a huge failure to recognize where they're benefiting incredibly also. Yeah so he's got a few assholes as friends, but he also has a lot of other good ones too. Yeah he can't get the same kind of credit card or loan as a foreigner but that's true of almost any nation. Plus he makes so much more right off the bat for being a white foreigner that it easily offsets any loan.  I mean, judging by his description, its' very safe to say that this guy is making 3-5x the average Taiwanese around his level. In fact if he got a job as an English teacher, he's looking at starting around 50k/60k a month with minimal experience and credentials, the same amount as a management position for a Taiwanese person after many years, for a company management position in China where he has to work 6 days a week every other week.   I remember this white guy who runs a bar in Taipei, who comes from a upper class white family telling me that there's so much racism in Taiwan. He's got a beautiful wife, he's got enough to start a business. He claims that he couldn't get a big enough loan because he's a foreigner, but he also boasts about making 2,500 NT an hour teaching at NTU. 2,500NT is what a lot of Taiwanese make an entire day, he does this in an hour. Meanwhile my Malaysian friend in America can't even get a loan, period, and can't even get a credit card with credit over $1,000 USD and black people are getting shot by cops left and right. Yet supposedly I'm the one not recognizing that Taiwan is super racist...  ""Where are you really from?"" is a short summation and the ""You can't really be American can you?"" are words I often hear when I grew up in America, along with intent that was not friendly. At least in Taiwan people aren't hostile against him. He's not being attacked, he gets to make lots of faux pas and people will let him be, and he can also bank a lot more cash than normal. Everywhere you live has trade offs.  When I was in Japan, sometimes people would get nervous thinking that I was Chinese but then a lot more people were super friendly as well. Living life means taking it all in, the good with the bad, not just hoping the bad doesn't exist. I love America, but goddamn I'd be lying if I said this guy's problems is anything at all comparable to what I went through."

You do if you're Asian American. Or that an Asian American male needs to make $247,000 USD more just to be equally appealing as a White male in America. The statistics pile on and it's just plain demoralizing.  So while this article has some German dude making way more than the average Taiwanese guy, and he's pissed off that sometimes people don't want to sit next to him on the MRT (people don't sit next to me either and I'm Asian) real Taiwanese Americans are getting screwed in both Europe and America in far more tangible terms.  I've met so many Asians abroad as of late leaving large companies or being fed up for these reasons alone. One of my buddies at Google was passed up for a promotion 4 times already despite statistically outdoing his peers.

On the converse, Taiwan is still so homogeneous and insular that the Taiwanese have been given no such reasons to show any truly negative sentiments towards white people.   In fact, judging by all the white models in fashion ads and the Hollywood movie ads all over Taiwanese TV, I'd say that Taiwanese society tacitly worships white people from a distance more than it actually hates them. Sure, there is discriminatory treatment on a sociopolitical level such as foreigners not being able to obtain citizenship and having to deal with all the restrictions that come as a result, which is a legitimate problem, but as far as the culture itself goes, the words we use are usually just casual categorization rather than racist slurs."

taiwan,37sb1x,Panseared_Tuna,4,Sat May 30 01:58:29 2015 UTC,"To be fair though, Zh doesn't capture the 汁 sound either."
taiwan,37sb1x,Roygbiv0415,1 point,Sat May 30 02:31:04 2015 UTC,It does in Russian. Pinyin is based off of Russian pronunciation.
taiwan,37sb1x,JillyPolla,-3,Mon Jun 1 01:20:08 2015 UTC,"To be fair though, Ch is so far away from the 張/汁 sound--and represents another beginning consonant in Chinese much better--that it's possibly the worst two letters to drop into the county's name.  To be fair though, Zh definitely does represent the sound within the limits of the roman alphabet. There is a very definable and clear and logical and makes-sensey move from 自/子/資 ""zi"" to 之/汁/制 ""zhi""."
taiwan,37sb1x,Panseared_Tuna,3,Sat May 30 02:49:30 2015 UTC,"Taiwan's historical usage of ""ch"" to represent Changhua derives from Wade-Giles, a system that was treated as the standard romanization system of Chinese for most of the 20th century. It was only in the 1970s with the switching of recognition of the Chinese state in the West from ROC to PRC did we see the popularization of the Mainland's Pinyin system. This was something that Taiwan did not adopt officially until 2008, and thus why Changhua and Taipei are spelled the way it is.  Even then, Pinyin isn't the closest representation of Mandarin available for English speakers. In fact, part of the reason why Pinyin uses the bizarre ""zh"" combination is because of its closer correspondence with the Russian language, a key diplomatic ally of the PRC since its inception as a state. The closest romanization system of Mandarin we've seen for English speakers has been the Yale system, popular up to the 1970s when diplomatic relations with the West switched from the ROC to the PRC. In Yale, we see what Pinyin represents as ""zh"" is actually represented as ""j"", the most logical letter of the alphabet for English speakers to represent that sound.   彰化 in this case will be ""Jang-hua"" (Yale) rather than ""Zhanghua"" (Pinyin), avoiding the common mistake of reading z and h separately rather than as a grouping. If my name was 張小全, my name in Yale would be the more logical ""Jang Syao-chyuan"" as opposed to ""Zhang Xiaoquan"" which for English speakers would likely be read as ""Z-hang Zyao Kwan"" to begin with.  For something like 知識, Yale also prevents the mispronunciation of the vowel ""i"" sound in ""zhishi"" like in the letter ""E"", and rather spells it out like ""jr-shr"". Seems weird at first, but reading as you would pronounce it in English will get you as close as you possibly can to the Mandarin counterpart.   EDIT: Forgot to mention, I do agree Wade-Giles was rubbish for all intensive purposes. I disagree that Pinyin does the best job in the most direct fashion. Pinyin falls short with its usage of for instance ""zh"" or ""x"" rather than say ""j"" or ""sy"". There's not a single native English speaker that will read ""zh"" and pick out that it's pronounced much like ""j"" without specifically studying Pinyin in the first place. Sure, you lose the linguistic connection of  the ""z/c/s"" sounds to ""zh/ch/sh"", but the Yale system's method at least gets you much closer to the proper pronunciation of the language which is what a romanization system should be doing in the first place."
taiwan,37sb1x,Yensuji,5,Sat May 30 08:28:36 2015 UTC,"The thing is though, Taiwan already had a system for people to efficiently learn and type Chinese in Bopomofo (Zhuyin). It wasn't necessary to adopt a Romanized system like Pinyin for that purpose. Romanization was a separate case in Taiwan, with its sole purpose being to represent Chinese to international speakers (in particular English language speakers such as for diplomatic purposes). The government in Taiwan therefore stuck to what was the international consensus in Wade-Giles for that reason, as that was the system recognized in the West right up until it finally dropped diplomatic ties with the ROC. ""Kaohsiung"", ""Changhua"", and ""Taitung"" were never good spellings, but the point is they were the correct spellings under the framework that people operated in at the time. From the government's perspective today, it makes little sense to change the names of its first and second-level divisions in Taiwan (i.e. special municipalities, counties) given the longstanding establishment or historical significance of these terms in the international system. As such it's hard to justify renaming Kaohsiung to Gaoxiong or anything similar given its status as a major regional port city without causing potentially significant confusion internationally.  Even then, romanization was never an issue of ""we're not China"" until recently when the government pushed for the Tongyong Pinyin system in 2002. Up until then, Taiwan stuck largely with Wade-Giles given as it was the way the Chinese language was recognized for the longest time."
taiwan,37sb1x,Yensuji,2,Sat May 30 13:11:34 2015 UTC,"I think romanization in Taiwan is only problematic because of the multiple attempts by governments to reform the system. Despite staying faithful to Wade-Giles on major placenames and personal names, there's been numerous tries at reforming the underlying romanization system throughout recent Taiwanese history. Your example of 竹林路 is an excellent case, as it highlights three ""generations"" of romanization reform: Ju-lin Road is a remnant of Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II (國語注音符號第二式) adopted in 1986 to ""co-exist"" with Wade-Giles; Jhulin Road is from Tongyong Pinyin pushed by the government in 2002; Zhulin Road is Hanyu Pinyin as adopted in 2009. ""Cuanzihling"" is Tongyong Pinyin, while ""Chuenr Road"" is MPS II.   The important issue with these multiple transitions in romanization systems is that the national government has never officially forced Taiwan's municipalities and counties to adopt any system. That is, these systems were never mandatory within Taiwan, and their adoption was considered voluntary. MPS II was rarely seen outside of government publications in its twenty years of existence. Tongyong Pinyin was only officially ""forced"" onto the signage of national highways (as that's under the jurisdiction a bureau of the Ministry of Transportation), with many counties and municipalities opting in locally on a voluntary basis. The transition to Hanyu Pinyin in 2009 was similar, with only some counties and municipalities choosing to switch systems again with the changes at the national level. Kaohsiung today still officiallly uses Tongyong Pinyin as a result, while in contrast Taichung has utilised Hanyu Pinyin since 2004, before its adoption at the national level. The problem for Taiwan lies in the lack of incentive for the national government to force the universal adoption of one romanization system, and the lack of programs at the local levels to ""clean up"" for the multiple changes in systems Taiwan has seen in the recent past. A rare example is when Kaohsiung sponsored a ""Say It Right"" campaign prior to hosting the World Games 2009 to fix the city's romanization. This needs to occur on a national level if Taiwan can have any hope of fixing the comical disparities in spellings around the country."

Should I use Wade-Giles or Pinyin? I'm leaning towards pinyin from a conformity perspective. But wouldnt mind Wade-Giles to maintain affinity with Taiwan
taiwan,37sb1x,dajackal,2,Sun May 31 13:33:11 2015 UTC,"That's something you get to decide on your own. In fact, I believe Taiwanese citizens are allowed the choice of Wade-Giles and Pinyin even today. If ""Taiwanese affinity"" is an important value to you then Wade-Giles is a reasonable option as most Taiwanese are registered under that system."

taiwan,37oxmf,Panseared_Tuna,12,Fri May 29 11:20:14 2015 UTC,"You're right in that ""din"" isn't proper Hanyu Pinyin, but if they use ""Din"" in their official name, is that not, then, their official name?

taiwan,37oxmf,Panseared_Tuna,12,Fri May 29 13:12:54 2015 UTC,"Din Tai Fung was established in 1958, whereas Hanyu Pinyin was adopted as the romanization standard by the PRC in the 1980s.   When the founder of Din Tai Fung established his restaurant, it was a combination of a previous employer's name (Heng Tai Fung) and his supplier (DinMei Oils).  It's not really a free pass when it's an established brand, like Tatung and ChingWin Publishing.   Maybe it'd be easier for some people to pronounce, but then again I find people that don't already know Pinyin have a hard time pronouncing it correctly, anyway.  Finally, they're just names, so companies can go ahead and spell them the way they want to. I mean, who cares that Google spells googol incorrectly, anyway?  Edit: Fixed slight error in historical recollection"
taiwan,37oxmf,Get9,3,Fri May 29 13:25:34 2015 UTC,"Hanyu Pinyin was adopted as the romanization standard by the PRC in the 1980s.   1958 was the officially adoption, not the 1980s. The 80's is when ISO accepted it as a standard, and also when you started seeing foreigners using it more than things like Wade Giles.  Still, Din Tai Fung can spell it however they want for all I care. In Hsinchu the street next to my local Din Tai Fung spells 石 as she. The government can't get stuff in standard pinyin. I don't see why a company should have to."

And yet, here in /r/Taiwan, you are angrily demanding that people conform to the pinyin of PRC origin, ignoring the fact that many of these uses were established before it.  Which is it?

It's not even a case of following in lock-step with mainland pinyin. It's about having enough brain cells to rub together to recognize that 巧 and 家 do not have the same initial sound.

taiwan,37p40m,tchaikmqrk,2,Fri May 29 16:51:07 2015 UTC,"Hey! Tonghua Night Market is one of the largest night markets, but I think it is only open until midnight. There is only one 24 hour Eslite open, on Dunhua Road.  I'm not well versed in the bars around here so I'll skip over that...  If I remember correctly, a taxi ride from Taoyuan to around the Tonghua area is about 900 NTD (30 USD) and takes about 45 minutes.  Taxis do roam the streets around that early, but if you are not sure, you could go to a nearby hotel (there is one near Daan Station) and ask them to call a taxi.  Taxi drivers should know the terms night market and airport, but in Chinese, the night market is ""Tonghua Ye Shi"" (the ""shi"" is kind of pronounced ""shuh"") snd the airport is ""Taoyuan Jichang"" (with the ""a"" pronounced as it is in father).  I hear drinks at bars can fetch about 200-300 for a drink, not sure about beers.  Food at the night market is at most 150 for a full meal, 30-50 for small snacks like sausages.  There should be an ATM at the arrival lobby.   Sorry if it's not super clear (in class at the moment). Feel free to PM me for more questions as I live around the area! Enjoy your stay :)"

I've heard from others that at least some of it should remain open until after midnight, like 1-2. Is this not true? I'm arriving on a Tuesday night if that makes a difference.  From there I'm hoping on just wandering northwest until I get to the Dunhua Road Eslite, hopefully finding some bars or other food along the way.  For money I'll budget about 2400 NTD for taxi, and probably 2000 NTD for food/drinks, so around 4400 NTD. Does that sound reasonable? I'd like to have little to no money left at the end of the day so I don't have to exchange it back.  I heard one can buy a beer at a convenience store and walk around town drinking it. Is this true?    Any other suggestions on what I can do to kill time? Eslite sounds nice and comfy but I'm afraid that if I sit down and start reading I'm gonna fall asleep :)"
taiwan,37p40m,vigernere1,3,Fri May 29 08:54:39 2015 UTC,"More than happy to help! I was never a night owl, so I honestly dont know when the night market closes unfortunately. The hubbub definitely dies down after twelve though.  The money looks good! That should get you through the night. Taiwanese street food is notoriously cheap and good.  I believe there is no public drinking law.  I have to look this up, but I've had people in my dorm walk in drinking beer uncovered, and I had a friend pay for a beer last year and just drink it in the store.  The Xinyi area (Taipei 101) will for sure have clubs and places like that open through the night.  Other than that, especially in the Dunhua area, I wouldn't be able to tell you for sure.  I'll do some extra research tonight and let you know if I find anything!"

As far as night markets go, it's nothing special IMHO. If you can, try to make it to Raohe (繞河) instead.  Also if I recall correctly many of the vendors that setup their stalls in the middle of the night market (i.e., in the middle of the street) are required to pack up between 9-10PM, making the market feel a little bit empty."

taiwan,37p40m,foggysf,2,Fri May 29 16:50:48 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, all night markets are mostly closed by 12AM.   As for ShiLin, for night market aficionados who live in Taipei it might not be the first choice, but that doesn't mean it's a bad night market. Yes it's huge and packed with people, but everyone should go at least once. And if you've never experienced a Taiwanese night market, then trust me when I say you'll enjoy the experience. And for your first night market experience (if that's what it is) I'd definitely tell you to go to ShiLin over Tonghua. That said, if you go to Tonghua, don't worry, you'll enjoy it too.   Good luck!"
taiwan,37p5fh,rokie7,5,Fri May 29 08:21:35 2015 UTC,"Is this your first time in Taipei?  It would take about 20 minutes to clear immigration (I'm guessing) and about 40 minutes to get to Taipei.    You can have lunch at Diamond Tony (隨意鳥地方) on the 86th floor of Taipei 101.  The food isn't great, but I think it's better than going up to the observatory with all the tour groups.  Call ahead for reservations!  If you are interested in history, you could spend the afternoon at the National Palace Museum (故宮博物館).    If you just want to go somewhere less crowded, you could take a walk at either National Taiwan University (台灣大學; will only take an hour) or rent a U-Bike to ride along Keelung River (基隆河).  It's expected to be really hot tomorrow, so be careful!  I am not religious, but I like the atmosphere of Xingtian Temple (行天宮; also will not take very long) to clear my mind (but haven't been back since they banned incense).  If you are into electronics or anime, there is Guang Hua Digital Plaza (光華商場), along with the newly opened 三創生活園區.  Nearby is also the Huashan 1914 Creative Park (華山), but it will also be crowded on the weekend.  Around 5:00, you can take the MRT (subway) to Jiantan station (捷運劍潭站) and go to the night market.

taiwan,37gjaa,TheColorWolf,8,Wed May 27 23:14:27 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm a kiwi with a Taiwanese lover or two.   Honestly, people pretend to be conservative about sex but it's more a face thing than a reality. MAKE SURE you buy condoms, a lot of Taiwanese women are schooled against birthcontrol because of social pressure (Doctors sometimes refuse to perscribe if  a woman hasn't done her ""biological duty."") or traditional chinese medicine, and Taiwanese men are loathe to use them for some reason. I know FAR too many couples who got married thanks to lack of birth control, and Taiwan has an incredibly high abortion rate.  Going dutch is not normal for them, but it's something that can be negotiated.   Codependant relationships are very normal in Taiwan so there's a good chance she will invest MUCH more of her time and mental stability on the relationship than a typical kiwi girl. (Who are far less codependent than most of the anglosphere anyway.) Be sure to be clear about what you want and need, and ask her repeatedly in safe spaces about what she wants and needs.  If a breakup happens, expect her to cut herself out of your life and all your friends lives. In Taiwan breaking up with someone often means cutting of that area of your life. In NZ because of our small population the 'lets be friends/keep the same social circle' thing is normal. It's a pragmatic part of our culture only having a couple of thousand potential mates in the country. In Taiwan, it's pretty easy to meet an entire new set of people. It's more like America's New York than our Brooklyn.   if you want specific advice from me or my fiance, PM me and we will respond together. Best of luck."

You are not a Taiwanese guy 2. Neither of you are in Taiwan and 3. She might want to adopt NZ culture Oh yeah 4. She's probably not a standard Taiwanese girl simply because she's studying in NZ (sampling bias).
taiwan,37gjaa,Domlr,3,Wed May 27 20:39:23 2015 UTC,"Will she expect me to pay, is it normal to split, or will she get offended if I offer to pay? This is one of the larger concerns.   I don't think she'll be offended if you offer to pay. There is no general taboo about this in Taiwan, and in any case she knows that your culture differs from her own too - so I doubt she's out to take offense over minor stuff like that.   I think just focus on showing her things she doesn't know yet - you are on your home turf, you should be able to make the date interesting for her."

I should be OK with that but it also depends on the girl. We'll see :)"

taiwan,37f823,muubi,5,Wed May 27 04:44:55 2015 UTC,"In regards to food expenses, here's a post on www.chinese-forums.com, written in 2012. An excerpt from the post:    ...here are some rough estimates for eating out:  Extremely cheap, dirt poor student: $100/day.   $50 lunch $50 for dinner No additional snacks or drinks throughout the day (bring them from home, etc.)   Modest, no-frills: $180/day   $50 for lunch $100 for dinner $30 miscellaneous drink/snacks   Mid-range: $255/day   $75 for lunch $130 for dinner $50 miscellaneous drinks/snack   High-end $450/day   $100 for lunch $200 for dinner $150 miscellaneous drinks/snacks (i.e., buying a coffee every day, etc.)   Big spender: $580/day   $150 lunch $280 dinner $150 miscellaneous drinks/snacks   The above assumes that you eat breakfast at home. The estimates are from a student's budgetary perspective (i.e., ""high end"" for a student is not the same as ""high end"" for someone with a job, etc.) I would not recommend trying to get by on the ""extremely poor student"" budget - there's too much good food in Taipei to eat!    On a student budget, the ""mid-range"" seems realistic, give or take a few dollars."
taiwan,37f823,vigernere1,0,Wed May 27 05:56:58 2015 UTC,"I call bullshit on that list.  In Taipei, any budget below the ""High-end"" tier on that list is going to make you want to kill yourself eventually, if the scurvy doesn't get you first.  Maybe you could make it on the Mid-range budget, but it would be pretty horrible.  NT$50 for lunch?  That's either 滷肉飯 or a 7-11 飯糰 for lunch every day for a year.  Plus, does breakfast magically appear for free at other people's homes?"
taiwan,37f823,chuiniu,5,Wed May 27 08:35:25 2015 UTC,"I call bullshit on that list.   Where's the bullshit? The estimates on the list ""...are from a student's budgetary perspective.""    NT$50 for lunch? That's either 滷肉飯 or a 7-11 飯糰 for lunch every day for a year.   Yeah it sucks. Nobody is recommending it.    Plus, does breakfast magically appear for free at other people's homes?   It assumes you save a little on cost by making breakfast at home, using bulk ingredients you buy at the store. Breakfast is the simplest meal of the day, and therefore least expensive (on average).   In Taipei, any budget below the ""High-end"" tier on that list is going to make you want to kill yourself eventually, if the scurvy doesn't get you first.    Mid-range ($255/day) is what plenty of working people spend each day for lunch/dinner in Taipei: $75-$100 for a 便當 (or equivalent), and $130-$160 to eat something at the local 小吃 (this still assumes $50/day for miscellaneous drink/snack). At these prices you have a range of Chinese/Taiwanese foods from which to choose. Will you get bored eating this food after a while? Maybe, especially if you didn't grow up eating it. And no one is saying you can't splurge on something more expensive once in a while.  Actually I don't think it's unreasonable to revise the ""mid-range"" up to $300/day or $325/day. For an average day's lunch/dinner/snacks, that should be perfectly fine for most students."
taiwan,37f823,vigernere1,1 point,Wed May 27 11:13:37 2015 UTC,"This information is supposed to be used by OP as a basis for a budget for total food costs.  If OP doesn't include breakfast then the budget doesn't include 1/3 of the meals one typically eats in a day.  I know everyone's different, but I personally wouldn't be very effective in class all morning after having eaten the cheapest possible dorm room breakfast.  The same goes for splurging once in a while.  If that's something OP's friend is ever going to plan to do, then this should be accounted for in the budget.    Leaving such costs out of a list meant for budgeting food costs doesn't help anyone, and makes eating in Taipei seem cheaper than it actually is in 2015.  That's my reasoning behind saying the list is bullshit.  Adding another NT$75 per day for breakfast and another NT$25 per day for splurging (to have another NT$175 to add on to one lunch or dinner on the weekend) is going to be another NT$100.  This makes $425 per day which is just below the ""High-end"" on that list.  I understand we're discussing semantics here to a point, but I just don't want anyone to look at that list and get the idea that one can budget NT$8,000 per month total for food and feel like they're in the ""Mid-range"", which is what OP seems to have done based on that list."

OP can take our back-and-forth for discussion, along with other estimates (other stated $8,000-$10,000/month) and go from there.   Just out of curiosity, on most days do you buy breakfast/lunch/dinner? If so, how much do you typically spend per month (excluding bars, alcohol, etc.)? How much do you spend on an average lunch, and an average dinner?"
taiwan,37f823,vigernere1,2,Wed May 27 13:40:09 2015 UTC,"I probably eat out for lunch and dinner around 3 times per week each on average.  I'll maybe go out for breakfast/brunch once a week if that.  The rest of my meals I cook at home.    I spend around NT$18,000 per month on food.   I typically spend around NT$250 going out to lunch.  Dinners out vary quite a bit, anywhere from NT$300 to NT$1000+, but I'd guess they average out to around NT$500.  This all varies quite a bit week to week depending on how busy I am with work and other things, but it's more or less consistent over the long term."

taiwan,37f823,Roygbiv0415,2,Thu Jun 11 02:09:37 2015 UTC,"Costs can vary A LOT depending on location. NTNU is at the center of Taipei City, so food estimates might be on the high side; but OTOH, some money might be saved on the transportation front, since public transport in Taipei is good enough that you generally won't need a scooter, like just about anywhere else.  Dorm estimates are also particular to each school (and some schools won't guarantee you get one), NT$4,600 might be on the low end."
taiwan,37f823,richardtheassassin,2,Wed May 27 05:01:41 2015 UTC,"200NT per day for food?  Holy crap.  I can get two medium meals a day at the buffet for about 300.  I wouldn't want to go a hell of a lot lower than that.  Edit: realistically, NT$30,000 per month for everything except tuition and fees is doable, IMHO.  If you share a really crappy apartment with others and don't ever get alcohol or higher-end western food, you might be able to get it down to 26000.  Add tuition on top of that.  I don't know if the government will require you to pay into the health insurance system or have other fees."
taiwan,37f823,pipedreamer220,1 point,Wed May 27 16:19:58 2015 UTC,"The quoted dorm price is per-semester, not per-month. However you will NOT want to live in a $4,600 dorm (and I'm not even sure they'll be open to your friend--in my university only the ""nicer"" dorms were available for international students.)  6,000 is very optimistic for food if you're living in Taipei. Taiwanese dorms don't have kitchens so you'll be eating out a lot, and NTNU is in an expensive area even for street food. I would say 8,000-10,000 is more realistic.  The transportation/books/utilities thing... well, the price of books would really depend on your major (I was an English lit major, I bought a whole bunch of literary anthologies in my first and second years and basically no books for third and fourth years because we used those anthologies over and over). You can spend very very little on transportation if you get a cheap used bike and use it for short trips. Never lived in a dorm so I wouldn't know what the utilities situation is like.  Frankly, the biggest expense for international students from what I've seen is booze and drunken late-night taxi rides, and obviously a calculator provided by the university isn't going to take that into account..."

Here's my awesome scrubby student budget: -Tuition: free -Rent: $2000/mo including utilities (dorms) -Food: $150/day at the minimum, I did this for a few months before. $50 per meal IS possible -- eat at the buffet (自助餐) places and you can even get a fairly balanced if boring meal. A tasty restaurant meal is at least $100-200ish, or you'll go to a night market and a bunch of $40ish items will add up to the same amount. Something like $300/day is more realistic. -Transportation: Bicycle for $1000ish (one time investment) -Health insurance: I believe it's about $700/month for students, have to pay a semester upfront... -Books/printing: Maybe $2500/semester? -You do need to consider other miscellaneous expenses (clothing, toiletries, computer, cell phone)... Overall I don't exceed $15000/month even living in Taipei. Don't listen to the expats/English teachers whose idea of fun is blowing all their money at a club or bar. As a student your friend will be surrounded with other students whose idea of fun is more like going hiking/sightseeing/board games (free) or zoo or museum (<$100), or having a dinner together.

Being bilingual is the fast track to shit jobs like translator, teacher, and copyeditor.  Just ask my wife who knows 4 languages because she's a linguistics nerd!

Fracking wasn't viable until the oil price had risen to a certain level. I'm asking the question of cost benefit regarding the oil there. If the oil could be profitable at current price, it would be very different than if the oil would only be profitable at $200 per barrel.

taiwan,37bq4n,pipedreamer220,7,Tue May 26 13:26:49 2015 UTC,"Inspired by this discussion.  The source is 漢聲小百科, a children's book series that I can only describe as Magic School Bus on steroids. The series consists of 12 huge, full-color hardcover books, one for each month of the year, with one ""story"" for each day of the month that teaches kids about the world they live in--mostly science, but also a lot on the culture, geography, and history of Taiwan.  The 1980s were arguably the nadir for environmental pollution and the destruction of historical sites in Taiwan, and this book series made earnest and heartfelt pleas to preserve Taiwan's remaining cultural heritage and environment. This story, which involves the personification of Taipei's North Gate filing a lawsuit against mankind for mistreating and abusing him and his fellow historical buildings, was one of the most vivid examples.  All of the historical buildings mentioned in this story are from the Qing dynasty, with no mention whatsoever of the Japanese-era buildings that were torn down and otherwise mistreated by the KMT government. (The KMT's disastrous ""renovation"" of the three other surviving Taipei city gates, which completely destroyed their unique architectural style, is mentioned but mostly glossed over.) The book does date from the martial law period, after all."

Whose hand is 北門公公 holding in the bottom right corner of the second picture when he's going to file his lawsuit?  It looks like a grey dragon, but what 古蹟 is that supposed to represent?

taiwan,37bq4n,chuiniu,2,Tue May 26 15:48:26 2015 UTC,"The dragon represents those ornate carved dragon pillars (like this). The crime is unlawful imprisonment; the dragon pillars are often surrounded with metal bars or cages to prevent vandalism. Sadly it's still a common sight.  This series is absolutely a fascinating document of the emergence of Taiwan's local consciousness. The idea that kids should be learning about Taiwan's culture and geography, that nonfiction children's books could include full-color illustrations of Taiwan's endemic wildlife and landmarks like Taroko and Alishan, was groundbreaking at that time. But at the same time the books had a very orthodox Chinese identity. The two child protagonists always referred to themselves as 中國人 or 中國孩子, and never 台灣人 (impressive feat considering so much of the content was focused on Taiwan's historic sites and Taiwan's environmental problems!) There was also one story that featured a map of China that included Mongolia, which I found pret-ty confusing as a kid."

It makes sense that it's a reference to those pillars, but it's even more interesting that the pillars want to sue because they are being imprisoned, not necessarily because they're being torn down.  I've always thought it to be a shame that those pillars are almost always encaged when I see them, so it's good to know that the pillars themselves feel the same way.

taiwan,37brv5,mo0k,2,Wed May 27 04:54:24 2015 UTC,"I hope you haven't bought it yet.  Because for 7K you can definitely get a road bike.  There are several place to check out.   If you check online (ruten), the starting price is 3K and up for road bike with 21 speed.  If you can't register to ruten, not to worry, most seller also have their webstore in yahoo buy. But Ruten is good because you can check prices, or just contact seller.   Last time I was Merida bike shop, they have simple road bike 4K and up. (in actual store, not on website) To my limited knowledge, these are targeted for students.  The bike has less expensive parts and frame.   You can't haggle in price, but I believe you can get 10%~15% off on items off store. ie: locks, lights, gloves, bike accessories.  (I'm not sure if you can haggle price with Giant cycling)  Lastly, local bike shop.  These places, you will able to haggle prices.    Personally, I would recommend Merida or Giants.  Because I tend to get after service on my bike.  I'm too stupid to take apart my bike and clean all its part after year of riding.  While they do sell high end bike, I think you might able to find some in your price range.     Last tip, must get a helmet.  Not all road has bike path.  Taipei motorist are notorious.  Moped tend to cut people off and don't get me started on buses during rush hour, they are just nascar drivers at times."

I think was the shops brand), then I hit the Giant and Merida stores near Linguang Station, I narrowed down to two models I like and are in my budget, Giant's Snap 21 (or Snap 24) or Merida's Warrior 300 (or Warrior 600)  Links to bikes specs:  Giant Snap 21  Giant Sanp 24  Merida Warrior 300  Merida Warrior 600"

taiwan,37auih,Monkeyfeng,3,Wed May 27 18:42:54 2015 UTC,"I would suggest bringing it back to the US. Taiwan has a very strict animal control import laws. I have no idea why. My sister a dog she adopted from China to the US without any issue as long as it had proof of vaccination. Taiwan, on the other hand, is very different. The animal needs to spend weeks if not months in poorly operated quarantine warehouse with other animals.  My friend has horror story of bringing his dog from the US to Taiwan and the dog was skinny when it came out of quarantine."
taiwan,37auih,Karmayana,3,Tue May 26 07:08:01 2015 UTC,I believe it's largely due to the lack of rabies and the fact that it's an island. They want to keep it that way. You'd have similar trouble going from the mainland U.S. to Hawaii.
taiwan,37auih,Monkeyfeng,2,Tue May 26 07:16:40 2015 UTC,"That's true but it's rather lacking animal rights. I think as long as it has ample evidence that the animal has rabies vaccination, it should be fine.   I just think it's an archaic law from the past that nobody bothered to change it."

taiwan,37auih,Monkeyfeng,3,Tue May 26 08:30:15 2015 UTC,That why there is vaccine certification. I don't think quarantine an animal for several months is necessary. 2 weeks is enough for most cases.

taiwan,37auih,Monkeyfeng,1 point,Tue May 26 08:32:16 2015 UTC,The fact that China is not a rabies free country is definitely part of the issue but it's more than just that. The US isn't rabies free either but it would be a lot easier if I was bringing him from there. I think it has to do with the political situation as well...at least that's what the government agent said. I was really hoping that there was a work around.

taiwan,37auih,hitension,2,Tue May 26 07:16:38 2015 UTC,"If you send him back to the US for 6 months, you can do the rabies paperwork there and then bring him back to Taiwan. I know it's a really annoying hassle, otherwise you could just fly through the US (switch to a 'new' US cat) and he will have to be in quarantine for 6 months in Taiwan (you can visit 2x week).   If you could fly him to the US to start the paperwork, then back to china, and then back to US again before going to Taiwan also seems like a possibility. You could also reach out to people that could carry the cat with them ie, friend or family that are flying to Taiwan anyway or to visit you.   AFAIK the policy is absolutely no animals from China. Im not sure about HK though, you should check the taiwan government website about importing animals."
taiwan,37auih,hitension,2,Tue May 26 12:24:19 2015 UTC,"You're correct that their stated policy is that it's impossible to import pets from the mainland. It was a government agent in Taiwan who suggested the China to HK to TW route I mentioned in the original post. But, it's crazy expensive and at least 7 months in quarantine which IMO is inhumane.

There should also be plans to build some sort of water diversion network.

There's nothing wrong with the current priority system, it's just that the drought is so severe that all non essential uses have already been on hold, and ordinary citizens start seeing the effect.  Adapt to... what? Historically, drought episodes occured in 1980, 1995, 2002, and 2015, about once a decade. That is short enough that most Taiwanese will, in the back of their minds, know that it's an inevitable issue, but long enough that there's really nothing to do about it. Maybe you could elaborate on what you mean by adaptation?  Sustainability would be one that I totally agree with.  We could start by fixing the pipes and ramping up water prices a little, and perhaps enforce the use of water-saving appliances and devices. But that all costs money, and whenever money is concerned, you know people will complain and protest."

That's why it was never ""renovated"" in the northern Chinese style like the other three surviving gates. It was supposed to come down to make room for the Zhongxiao West Road elevated viaduct at the same time the ""renovations"" were taking place, so the government thought it might as well not bother.  The viaduct actually used to have an exit ramp that basically made the gate look like it was being choked off, like this. The exit ramp was demolished sometime in the 90s.  The remaining viaduct behind the gate is scheduled to come down next year too, so the gate's not going to look quite as out of place in the future."

taiwan,375xll,Roygbiv0415,1 point,Tue May 26 15:59:15 2015 UTC,"The exit ramp actually connected to Yanping, not Zhonghua. Yes, it dumped cars right into the narrow little street. It was torn down when the city was still in the rah-rah-more-expressways phase, which says a lot about how bad an idea it was.

It's the only one of five Old Taipei City gates to keep its appearance as-built, and one of very few buildings in Taipei from the Qing era still intact.

I have regular aneurysms trying to shop at Costco. Carts sideways blocking an entire aisle, zero awareness.   I'm from Hawaii and this type of getting in peoples way would just about start fist fights and definitely get profanity thrown your way at the very least. People are definitely too aggressive there though and overall I much prefer most interactions here, but every now and then I just want to summon by big Hawaiian friend to go on a rampage here: throw some scooters into orbit, rhino-charge down Costco aisles and take out anyone in the way.   I'm also the type to be very conscious about spatial awareness and not get in peoples way, hold doors for people I see behind me, etc. Totally different culture and I don't blame people here or hold it against them - I wasn't raised in a hyper-crowded city, they were.

I'm slightly concerned about the ""foreigner in hell"" part though, as I've never heard of such connections even as a Zuoying local. Given that the two towers were built in 1976, and the murals just recently remade, I highly doubt such depictions of foreigners could be possible. Just looking at it I'd simply explain it to represent a gangster with dyed hair, rather than a white foreigner. Who was it that explained this to you?  Also curious: What was the camera you're using? It's producing a style that's rarely seen on digital cameras, rather more like film scans. Or is it after-effects?"

Blue jeans, vintage gun, blonde mullet... when everything else on the wall is traditional Chinese stuff? Weird :D but if your gangster hypothesis is correct, is goring a common punishment for whatever it is that gangsters do?  As for my photos, I post-process everything in Lightroom. These days I'm trying not to overdo it... just a bit of a vintage feel is nice. The originals look a bit more muted and less warm."
taiwan,373gk5,BioDerm,3,Sun May 24 16:33:01 2015 UTC,"I did a bit of research afterwards, and it appears that the only ""hell"" that punishes by goring, is the tenth level, called 牛坑地獄 (lit. bull pit hell). It is for those who take pleasure in killing animal, i.e. recreational hunters.  So my guess is that since recreational hunting is very much banned (if at all possible) in Taiwan, they used a foreigner (likely American) to represent recreational hunters?"
taiwan,3723vd,MercuryBlu3,62,Sun May 24 03:41:23 2015 UTC,"I recommend you prepare for the worst case scenario that it doesn't get returned. If you haven't already started, begin the process of getting a new passport from the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT). You will need to schedule an appointment, which sometimes needs to be booked a week or two in advance. After submitting all your paperwork, you will need to wait three weeks for normal turn-around. If you are just travelling and don't have a lot of time, it's imperative you get started on this right away. This is the guidance on lost passports from the AIT. The following is a basic guide through the process.   Schedule an appointment with AIT. PRINT AND RETAIN your appointment confirmation. Take note of the list of required documents. You should file a police report with the police station closest to the location to potentially lost your passport. The police station closest to Myst is probably the Xinyi Substation at No. 17, Section 5, Xinyi Road (信義區信義路五段17號), closest MRT is Xiangshan Station. The address for Myst is 12 Songshou Rd (信義區松壽路12號). You will need the address when filing a police report.You may need other ID when filing your report. Take a copy of your police report to the National Immigration Authority of Taiwan - they have offices in Taipei at No.15, Guangzhou St., Zhongzheng Dist (中正區廣州街15號) and you don't need an appointment. Go downstairs and use the Japanese-style photobooth to print six 2""x2"" photos to use at NIA and AIT. It costs about 120 NT. Go back upstairs to the help desk. Tell them you lost your US passport. They will direct you to the correct window to report it to NIA. YOU MUST DO THIS STEP to receive your passport from AIT. Locate additional documentation required by AIT - US Government issued ID card, photocopy of passport, photocopy of birth certificate, etc. Follow the guidance posted above and here for what you need to bring to your AIT appointment. Don't miss your AIT appointment. The system works like this; let's say 50 people book an appointment for June 1. They will be put into different service categories based on the service they need. For the example, let's say 20 people are there for passport services like you are. Five people might have an 8 AM appointment, five might have an 8:15 AM appointment, and so on. Arrive at AIT early, head upstairs to US citizen services, stand directly in front of the window to check in and wait for them to open. If you are the first person to be checked in, you will be the first person in your time slot to be seen. Don't forget, you will need a Taiwan address to have the passport delivered for you. You pay the delivery service upon delivery of your passport. It's not expensive. Don't forget this step:    After you have received a replacement passport from AIT, you must return to the nearest National Immigration Agency office where you filed the initial lost/stolen passport report. There, you must apply for an Exit Permit. An Exit Permit is required in order to leave Taiwan using this new passport."
taiwan,3723vd,Tyberos,9,Sun May 24 04:30:40 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the details my friend
taiwan,3723vd,ShrimpCrackers,2,Sun May 24 04:42:32 2015 UTC,"You should also call Myst and ATT (the building where you were at) and ask if they found a passport. People tend to return things here. Go through the AIT process first though, better egg on your face than delaying the process.  Other tips:  Furthermore here are a few tips, always carry your passport (if you really need to on your direct person) in a front pocket. It's a little harder to pick pocket than from the back and it's more obvious if it disappears.  Don't go clubbing with anything important. People always get drunk and do stupid things or get forgetful."

I THINK recall seeing him having little juice looking cartridges, but I don't e-cig or use any tobacco anyway so I'm not really sure.  I've seen his ""store"" (it's basically an open briefcase propped up on a stand) about in the middle of this route I drew on the map.

I don't have an Instagram account and I really want to see what other people think because I found this utterly bewildering.)  So, um, do people really think that this is depicting a white person? Because I'm not seeing the obviousness here. He has the exact same skin tone as the cop and the same hair color as the woman he's pickpocketing. I GUESS I can see where the nose leads to that conclusion, but men having more prominent noses than women is a fairly common thing in anime-inspired drawing styles--see this other crime prevention comic.  This reminds me of the are-anime-artists-drawing-white-people argument that crops up sometimes."
taiwan,36uvz2,x3nomik,3,Fri May 22 11:10:58 2015 UTC,"It's a bit weird to cross the streams, but okay. Reality check: it's a cartoon so there's no objective answer :)  I based my original off-the-cuff assessment on things I mentioned (the overall impression created by the big nose, wider eyes, hair colour (a bit red, actually), etc.) combined with the fact that there are a disproportionate number of western-looking people appearing as antagonists in MRT public service announcements. This immediately came up on Twitter and I have a few more examples kicking around (the most obvious of which is an actual photograph of a white guy eating a donut on the MRT while Taiwanese people scowl at him).  But let's not get crazy here; I'm not standing up and shouting ""racism"", I'm having a laugh about it on a casual, throwaway medium. I've commented on this sort of thing before and wondered whether illustrators are borrowing technique from western artists, expressing a subconscious bias, or if non-Asian people are seeing things that simply aren't there at all. To be vaguely more scientific about it we'd have to survey all the different PSAs that come out... but perhaps we're all reading way too much into this... ;)"
taiwan,36uvz2,pipedreamer220,3,Fri May 22 11:56:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the metro ad about eating and drinking was just a really odd decision to add diversity at the weirdest time.  I feel like there's definitely a gap between East Asia and the west in the way that cartoon characters are viewed, where westerners care much more about cartoons mapping on to real life, but Asians usually chalk it up to an aesthetic choice. I remember reading more than one discussion on the English internet about whether anime characters ""really"" have pink/blue/green hair, or if it's just a stylized representation of ""normal"" hair colors, and that entire discussion is so far out of my frame of reference that I don't even know how to approach it.  For instance--I don't know if you know about Chibi Maruko-chan 櫻桃小丸子, which is a really, really popular kids' anime that's generally a fairly naturalistic story of a girl going to elementary school in 1970s Japan. One of the boys in the main character's class has light brown hair; everybody else in the class has black hair. This has never ever been commented on either within the show or by fans, as far as I know. I wonder if there would be fan theories about him being mixed-race, if the cartoon were bigger in the West?"

Could be. I mean, I'm not sure if I just remember more when it's a malicious or negative act committed (in a PSA) by someone of my own skin tone or if the discrepancy truly exists. I'll do a quick trial, here: Without looking elsewhere, it seems to me that people depicted in PSAs in which a person is being injured or is the victim are Asian, whereas the violator or aggressor is not. If it's a PSA like the ones in elevators where you have the woman falling down the shaft, it seems the characters are all Asian.  Now, after doing a cursory search of Taiwan PSAs on Google Image Search, I found the aforementioned elevator cartoon and another cartoon that seems to depict an all white family and their difficulties during a fire. Another cartoon reminded me of those videos you see on some buses that had a bunch of creepy guys either being sick to their stomach or eating on public transit; I believe they were rather ambiguous. All I could find was this screencap, where the woman seems Asian, as does the guy (as per my recollection of his entire face).  My conclusion is that it's involuntarily selective recollection."

Unfortunately, the Taiwanese economy sucks, so there's not many job opps.    The top jobs in Taiwan that MBA students want (e.g. McKinsey/Goldman Sachs/Google) are recruited out of elite MBA programs in the US or maybe HKUST/INSEAD Singapore, not Taiwanese programs.

Cape No. 7 is not really well designed for an international audience.  They'd have to spend more time explaining the backgrounds and cultural and class significance of the different characters otherwise their interactions are all 'lost in translation'.

taiwan,36u6mu,schatbot,1 point,Fri May 22 03:44:52 2015 UTC,"I'll shoot! I'm just genuinely curious about a couple of things.   1) Gangs- How prevalent are they in visible society? I've been here a year and I've never seen anything remotely gangish aside from a convoy of about 5 black mazdas following eachother. How likely is it that organized crime will ever affect me- your average american expat teacher?  2)Massages- yes that kind of massage. What's the legality on it here? Have you ever done it? I'm not particularly interested in going myself, frankly, my girlfriend would murder me if I did. But how do you even begin to waltz into a massage parlor and be like, ""Hey, do you guys do happy endings?"" Are there like signs to look for?  3) Can I find an apartment without going through a realtor? I'm searching for a new place, and it seems everything is dominated by realty agencies who charge a pretty hefty fee.   4) Scooter ownership- Would you recommend buying a scooter? I have an IDL, but I would be kind of terrified to drive a scooter amongst the insanity that is traffic here. I almost get run over by people everyday walking to my job.  5) What's my legal recourse if I ever do get hit by a cab or other vehicle? Do I as an alien resident have access to the legal system to sue the shit out of some idiot who runs me over while I'm legally crossing the street?  Take your time answering all these, I'm in no rush. Just some thoughts I've had rolling around in my head since I got here. But overall, I love the place. It's really a cool living situation."
taiwan,36u6mu,shadow_fox09,1 point,Mon May 25 07:53:54 2015 UTC,"I answered the scooter question on the blog in the pages section, and the apartment one will be showing up soon. If you get hit by a car you can sue, even as a foreigner, but you'll need to collect all the evidence yourself and there is a lot of lawyering that goes into it. More info on that will eventually show up on the blog. Unlikely to get blogged is about the gangs, which won't hurt you unless you get into a fight with them, and you've definitely seen some, but they just look like regular people. The word gang is used more loosely than what is expected in the west, although some gangs are quite notorious for being brutal. Basically, if you don't mess with their business - like night clubs, KTV's, bars, blue collar labor rights, etc - or try to fight them, you're totally safe. Also, many gangsters are reasonably nice people and there are some who are quite nice to foreigners. You can find those massages, never got one but know a lot of locals who have. Never been too interested, to be honest. So far as I know it's not on the level, but there seem to be a lot of turning a blind eye for (quickly deduced) reasons not worth posting online. I can only really help by saying that some stores seem to have a full roster of only male clients and the people working there dress provocatively. In my opinion they are real massage joints which have staff that apparently make their customers happy. If that includes what you're looking for... no idea."
taiwan,36qzvg,shorttermobsessions,2,Thu May 21 12:55:19 2015 UTC,"AirBNB is easiest and most convenient but will cost you a pretty penny. Contrary to how things often are in the west most of the listings in Taiwan are hostels, hotels, and serviced apartments... which isn't necessarily bad given what some people's homes look like around here.  Facebook groups are actually your best bet; there's one called ""looking for roommates in Taipei"" or something along those lines that gets a ton of traffic... but you're shit out of luck unless you move to the student ghettos of Taipei most of the time.  Beyond that... you'll need Chinese or some local assistance. If I had to do this all over again I'd probably wander into some Facebook group for the city I want to live in (""Kaohsiung language exchange"" or ""Hsinchu English teachers lounge"" or some such search) and offer some money for someone bilingual to help find a place on 591 and co-sign the lease."

Privacy concerns could be answered with your own birth certificate, if you still have access to that. Although older records may stay in only paper form, causing some complications. One thing you could also try is to go through the Taipei Representative Office in your local area, they might be able to forward your information back to Taiwan. Find the nearest office and call them up, there's no harm asking.  http://www.roc-taiwan.org/US/mp.asp?mp=12  EDIT: They are called a cultural and economic representative but they are de facto embassy, having the authority of any full-fledged embassy and are staffed with official Ministry of Foreign Affairs personnel."

They are usually polite towards Taiwanese nationals but can be very rude to locals at times. Perhaps that's the same in the US.  Or perhaps she's just trying to avoid work like many undeserving public sector employees... :(  A good way to deal with these people is to send a small gift along with your letter. Nothing big, maybe a small box of chocolates. When the matter gains some kind of personal association (""the case from the one that sent the chocolates"" vs ""the case about someone---don't remember the name---looking up someone""), these people usually are more willing to go that extra step than when it was dealt like pure work. It may seem borderline bribery, but that's the age-old Chinese culture for you. Sad reality. :(  (And the same thing applies with small gifts, if you ever end up personally in Taiwan and work with the household registration staff.)  Anyways, good luck on the search.

taiwan,36qjw6,Bacilli,5,Thu May 21 09:34:11 2015 UTC,"Regarding the license plate:  China is a region with special controls and all vehicles from China need to first apply to the Ministry of Economic Affairs with a local (Taiwanese) representative providing relevant documentation, for an import permit. Once approved, you can apply to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications for a temporary license plate. When you receive your temporary license plate, your existing Chinese plate will be kept at the ministry.  In the past 10 years, only 8 Chinese vehicles have been permitted to enter Taiwan:   3 were mobile comms relay cars to support in a typhoon disaster relief effort 4 were trailer cars as part of a boat-to-land transportation route trial project 1 was some kind of semi-official cross-strait relations association's passenger car   Currently permits are issued very sparingly. The base law basically forbids Chinese vehicles from entering Taiwan in whole (importing parts is a different matter). Bottom line, do not expect to be able to wander around Taiwan on a Chinese-plated vehicle. It's a very sensitive issue. Even if you somehow manage to do it just for lols, you'll most likely have the police holding your motorcycle and the mass media all over you.  On the other hand, if you have enough guangxi, it's not impossible to get a temporary plate like #3 in the list above. In that case, just do it but don't tell. ;-)  Regarding the driver's license:  Taiwan does not recognize Chinese driver's licenses. (You may hear that we do, but that is only for people who have resided in Taiwan for over 1 year.) To be permitted to drive in Taiwan, you need an official license issued by a mutually recognizing country, or an international driver's license.  To get the latest info and the most accurate rules, you should probably check with these official bodies:   Mainland Affairs Council: http://www.mac.gov.tw/mp.asp?mp=3 Taipei City Motor Vehicles Office: http://tpcmv.thb.gov.tw/EMP.aspx"

There is a section of the Love River between two bridges (Wufu Road and whatever is the next one down where the history museum is) where most stuff is. Vendors (food, jewelry, pets, etc.) are lined along the side like a night market.  Since it's so contained in that one small part (in Kaohsiung, anyway), traffic is not affected very much.

It's likely after the KMT's imminent beatdown in the upcoming January 2016 Presidential elections, the party will be forced to reform - and ultimately turn itself from a pro-Chinese party, into a pro-Taiwanese party."
taiwan,36myxg,FormosaNation,5,Wed May 20 21:51:48 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'll believe that when I see it. Any steps toward reform that the KMT takes always seems to be beaten back by the party's extreme faction sooner or later.  Plus, I don't believe there will be much impetus for the KMT to transform itself if they maintain their legislative majority next year, which is still possible (and arguably still probable). Even though I think Tsai will be more effectual at dealing with divided government than Chen was, they can still obstruct the hell out of her agenda and block any attempt to deal with their party assets, which will ensure their continued viability.  I know it's dangerous to draw parallels between Taiwan and US politics, but the Republicans suffered two straight electoral beatdowns in 2006 and 2008. They doubled down on the crazy and (thanks to a very favorable congressional map and their media and money machine) not only do they remain viable, they're going to keep the House majority until 2020 at the earliest. I see no reason why the KMT can't follow a similar path."

I don't know how the KMT can sustain a pro-unification agenda for the long term when the overwhelming trend now is towards becoming more Taiwanese rather than Chinese.  The crazy (郝柏村, 連戰) wing of the KMT will keep trying to drag the party down, but eventually, the younger Taiwanese KMT generation (does the KMT really have such a thing?) will ultimately win out in favor of major reform."

taiwan,36myxg,ShrimpCrackers,2,Fri May 22 02:36:31 2015 UTC,"Not really. DPP's policy is based on exclusion and Hoklo supremacy, which is hardly progressive. I would qualify their position as more anti-establishment, but that in itself is not necessarily progressive.   If you think about, both DPP and Republicans draw their core support from rural, working class, and uneducated. They both play race politics and hold the ideal of the ""native"" above more recent arrivals."
taiwan,36myxg,JillyPolla,3,Fri May 22 02:51:53 2015 UTC,"Eh I think it has a lot more to do with your biases than anything because if we start going into policy, your argument breaks down completely. Note that the DPP is part of world democrats just like the US Democrats while the KMT is in the same international body as the US Republican party.  The reality is most political parties pander to the uneducated. The KMT doesn't appeal specifically to the intellectually elite, it just propagandizes itself as saying the DPP core base is stupid. Who is the core deep blue base of the KMT? That's right, retired, uneducated, former soldiers, most of whom don't even have undergraduate degrees."
taiwan,36myxg,ShrimpCrackers,1 point,Fri May 22 02:58:26 2015 UTC,"The fact is if you look at the support for each party in terms of breakdown of education, you'll see a lot more green at the bottom and more blue at the top. The core KMT supporters obviously include the people who came with them from the mainland. But they are dying and their numbers are small nowadays. I would say a lot of their core supporters are civil servants, teachers, business community, and current military. If you look at rural farmers or laborers, you'll certainly find a lot more green supporters.   And you cannot deny that DPP policy has a bent of anti-non Hoklo. They were politicans telling mainland descendants to go home, or how non-Hoklos are not real-Taiwanes, and that the descendants of mainlanders don't really love Taiwan. These are the same kind of strategy you see with ""real Americans"" and ""illegal immigrants"" arguments.

taiwan,36o0zb,treskro,-5,Wed May 20 20:11:37 2015 UTC,"What is the difference between Taiwanese and Mandarin?   The reason I ask about Cantonese in Taiwan is because the way Taiwanese and Cantonese sound similar when spoken and in pinyin.  Using the word ""Mandarin"" as an example   Google's translation of ""Mandarin"": 普通話 (Pu Tong Hua); which my friend said is how people in China/Mainlanders say it My friend said in Taiwanese ""Mandarin"" is: 國語 (Guo Yu); which is really similar to Cantonese Cantonese translation of ""Mandarin"" is: 國語 (Gwok Jyu <-Jyutping)    Side question:   Is this the right keyboard for Taiwanese? http://puu.sh/hUM0r.png (Chinese Traditional, Taiwan, New Phonetic with the keyboard set to HanYu pinyin)?  When I try to type Guo Yu (with hitting the space once after I type Guo), I get this 過於, and when I type Guo Yu (with pressing space twice after I type Guo), I get this 國 與. How do I get it to type 國語 normally? I tried typing Yu as Yv, but nothing even comes up; which is odd to me because for 女 I have to type it as Nv."
taiwan,36o0zb,treskro,12,Thu May 21 00:06:27 2015 UTC,"Nope, you're confusing Taiwanese Mandarin (which is the accent of Mandarin spoken in Taiwan) with Taiwanese (which is a dialect of Minnan/Hokkien also spoken in Taiwan).   Mandarin is called 普通話 'common speech' on the mainland, but 國語 'national language' in Taiwan. Different terminology, but effectively the same language with different accents, sort of like the difference between standard American and British English accents. Cantonese <gwok jyu> is cognate with the Mandarin pronunciation 國語 <guo2 yu3>, but Cantonese 普通話  <pou tung waa>  is also cognate with 普通話 <pu3 tong1 hua4>.  Taiwanese (台語 [Mandarin tai2 yu3] [Taiwanese tai-gi] [Cantonese toi jyu??]) is the local name for a variety of Min Chinese that is the native language of the Hokkien (Fujianese) group, which makes up the Chinese population of Taiwan (around 70%). This (along with a smaller Hakka contingent) was introduced during the late Ming/early Qing period migrations of Southern Min speakers from Fujian province. Fluency among younger people is spotty as a result of Mandarin focused education, but in general the further south you are, the more Taiwanese you will hear spoken. Like Cantonese, it is a separate language which is related to but not mutually intelligible with Mandarin.    Your keyboard setup is correct. When you type in pinyin you should get a pop up that shows different characters corresponding to the pinyin you typed in, and if it doesn't get it right on the first conversion pass, you will have to manually select the right one. The IME software will do better at predicting the appropriate character if you give it more context by holding off on pressing space until you've entered more syllables.   For example, if I wanted to type 我要睡覺, you could either:   type each syllable individually and select the correct character from the dropdown box．   OR   type woyaoshuijiao[space] and have the entire thing converted correctly. here's a screenshot of what I'm talking about     last note, IME's usually require <nv/nü> for 女 in order to differentiate it from <nu>. <yu> although having the same vowel sound as <nv/nü>, doesn't require the umlauted <-u> because there is no difference between <yu> and <yü>."

Public transport is cheap and reliable. The MRT (subway) in Taipei is extremely easy to use.

taiwan,36lcqv,iamatool123,5,Wed May 20 06:07:29 2015 UTC,"US$20K = NT$600K, which is definitely on the very high side but possible with three years of high school + four years of university, especially if she went to private schools.  I actually just translated a Ministry of Education document on student loans a few weeks back. There are definitely renegotiation and forgiveness mechanisms but I think you may need to be able to prove hardship. I'll dig it up for you this evening if nobody else has replied with something more concrete"
taiwan,36lcqv,pipedreamer220,1 point,Wed May 20 06:24:49 2015 UTC,"definitely on the very high side   That's about NT 70K a semester even if she went to public high school. It's high for public schools, but about right for private schools. Also, there's an extra NT$40K that could be loaned each month for low income families, to cover living expenses. Maybe she had those as well?"
taiwan,36lcqv,Roygbiv0415,1 point,Wed May 20 06:40:22 2015 UTC,"Fees for public high school were definitely less than 10K and probably less than 5K per semester when I was going. They've probably went up but certainly not by that much?  And at any rate, very few people take student loans for high school in my experience, so they don't rack up that much debt."
taiwan,36lcqv,pipedreamer220,1 point,Wed May 20 06:44:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah by Taiwan's standards, OP's wife spent a lot of money. NTU is only a couple thousand dollars a year. How she racked up that much must mean she went to a very expensive private school, such as KCIS. However, everyone I tutor at KCIS are from ultra rich families with dads or moms being people like chief hospital surgeons or a  top executive for UniPresident and they can easily pay for these services. Anyway I don't even think KCIS is that pricey, so I'm really curious where she went?"
taiwan,36lcqv,ShrimpCrackers,1 point,Wed May 20 16:17:44 2015 UTC,She went to CCU.
taiwan,36lcqv,ShrimpCrackers,1 point,Sun May 24 03:36:59 2015 UTC,"Then it's like $1500 USD a semester or $3000 a year. Multiplied by roughly 7 years, that is $21,000 USD. Perhaps she didn't pay any of it while at school, so her parents didn't really support her.  You'll need to find a payment plan and work it out with the university. It's honestly not that much if well sorted. /r/personalfinance can help you come up with a plan and they're VERY good at it.  Drop everything and cross post there.  I'm at a point in my career where paying that off in installments wouldn't even take two years, comfortably. It's honestly, comparatively, not so bad. I know quite a few graduates that owe a quarter million USD upon graduation because they poorly chose the most expensive private school in America. CCU isn't a bad institution and in America many private schools cost that much per semester anyway.  Best of luck. Seriously, run to /r/personalfinance right now."
taiwan,36lcqv,pipedreamer220,3,Sun May 24 08:25:00 2015 UTC,"Oooookay. I just looked it up and there's some pretty bad news for you: If you have student debt and you permanently move out of the country, you're supposed to repay the entire amount before you leave. I don't know how your wife got around that, if she's maintaining residency in Taiwan some way or another, but this is something you guys need to sort out first before you start thinking of extensions.  If you get that out of the way, you can get up to three one-year extensions on the principal payment if your average monthly income for the preceding year is less than NT$30,000. Further extensions are possible after that, I think, if you maintain that (low) level of income."
taiwan,36lcqv,Roygbiv0415,2,Wed May 20 10:40:35 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear of your difficulties, but neither the principle (that's the total amount, right?) , the interest rate, nor the payback time seems particularly unreasonable. I have a friend who successfully negotiated to defer beginning of payment by two years, but not total payback period. Maybe you could try that to give some padding to your situation, but that you're both abroad probably works against your favor."

taiwan,36lcqv,DerpyDogs,1 point,Wed May 20 10:43:40 2015 UTC,That seems like an insane amount considering the low salaries in Taiwan. On par with Canadian levels and some US kids too.
taiwan,36lcqv,mantrap2,1 point,Wed May 20 10:32:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly at 1.8% interest, this is the VERY LAST loan you want to bother ""refinancing"".   Seriously all other loans (especially credit cards running from 10%-25%) far higher.  This is a dream loan - let it ride but pay off any other loans at higher rates sooner, no matter how small.  Do you understand compounded interest?   Not trying to be an ass but seriously."
taiwan,36lyfj,HarveyHound,2,Wed May 20 10:46:55 2015 UTC,"I'll be moving out at the end of the year.    Will you be leaving Taiwan? If, not what are the odds your next place will have an AC? (You can skew those odds in the future by preferring places that have AC). I raise these points because they might affect the calculus of your decision. The way I see it:   If you are staying and expect that future places will not offer AC, then a portable AC makes more sense. If you are leaving Taiwan, then you should maximize your utility at the lowest price possible. ""Utility"" in this case is 1) an AC that adequately cools your room, 2) an AC that has a low marginal operating cost, and possibly 3) an AC that you can easily resell when you leave.   I'll let it to you to consider how much, if at all, any of the above applies to you. But by way of reference: I bought a brand new Sanyo window-mounted AC for ~$10,000 and had it delivered/installed for an additional ~$1,000. This is less than the $18,000 price for the cheapest portable units you've found. So if you are leaving Taiwan and/or expect your future place will have AC, then it would make sense to go for a window-mounted unit like mine, which costs less and works better than a portable AC.   If you are staying in Taiwan and want to take the AC with you, then a portable unit is obviously easier to move (assuming it's on castors, which I think most are). That said, I know people who moved and took their window-mounted ACs with them, paying a handyman about $500 to uninstall it at the old location, and $500 to install it at the new location (price could be slightly higher depending on where you live, etc. It may also be the case that, if you are using a moving company, they can uninstall/install the AC for you).  Oh, and I almost forgot: you can always buy a used AC. Most places will offer at least a 3 month guarantee, which would cover you for most of the remaining hot months this year. You might end up only spending $3,000-$5,000 for an AC that will adequately cool a bedroom, including installation.  Good luck!"

taiwan,36kp12,torgian,2,Wed May 20 03:27:16 2015 UTC,"God damn that's a lot. I was calculating everything for my lifestyle, and I came up with no more than $1000 US a month. That's with a nicer 10,000NTD apartment, bills, and food. I'm more of an outdoors type, so I eat quite a bit.   Looks to me this guy is living a higher type of living than what I'm used to."
taiwan,36kp12,torgian,1 point,Wed May 20 08:45:06 2015 UTC,"It also looks like he has a lot of travel involved. And visa runs? I won't need to go outside of Taiwan to renew my student visa, is he working illegally?   And a housekeeper?   Really? God damn, I'm glad I do my own cleaning."
taiwan,36kp12,Karmayana,5,Wed May 20 08:48:19 2015 UTC,"Sounds about right for someone who is living alone at an average level of comfort, though the electricity bill is a bit on the high side, so I'd say he's running the A/C fairly often. I'd also say that he eats out (sit-down restaurant) infrequently on that budget.  Typically a housekeeper will come once or twice a month for a few hours to sweep, mop, dust. We aren't talking about a live-in. If you have roommates, it's totally justifiable since you don't have to fight about who does what. People with several pets tend to go for it as well.  Overall the numbers look right. His actual living costs are closer to 30k a month. You are adding in voluntary expenses (i.e. travel) to your estimate. And the fact that he's doing visa runs means he's likely working illegally and therefore not paying taxes or health insurance - a questionable choice.  His rent is around $12k a month, which is cheap for a 30 ping place as he has listed, though it depends on what district and the quality of the place. Could easily be a walk-up with no guan li in a less central part of town.  You could live on less or more in Taipei. There's no one 'cost of living.' I'd say it's more like a like a ratio of money spent divided by quality of life obtained. My friend lives in Taipei fairly comfortably (for him) on 20k a month. I couldn't do it though. I'd say it's doable to live just about anywhere in Taiwan on 10-15k a month - if you wear a few sets of clothes over and over again, eat cheap lunch boxes, live with multiple roommates (or in a sublet room), walk everywhere, never use A/C, take cold showers, etc.  I could match the lifestyle of a lot of different people in the world. Which lifestyle specifically? My best friend in high school still had an outhouse and limited indoor plumbing, while another friend lived in a 10-bedroom mansion, both within 25 miles of each other.  I'd say these estimates are middle of the road. From those numbers, this guy:   1) Lives alone in a 2-3 bedroom, 1-2 bath place (likely a walk-up) 2) Runs his air con fairly often (more than just nighttime) or has a large bedroom 3) Eats at home frequently, maybe goes out for a nice meal once or twice a week, though maybe not foreign food 4) Drives his scooter to and from work, which is probably less than 5-10 km from his home 5) Works illegally and leaves the country once every 3 months 6) Likely drives illegally too and probably doesn't have papers or insurance for his scooter   A quick perusal of his blog and videos backs most of this up. I'd say this will easily match the lifestyle of someone coming out of university having lived in a dorm or off-campus with a roommate or two. Your mileage may vary.  Also I'd like to point out that for someone who only works 20 hours a week he's living a very comfortable life all things considered. Most people in the world would struggle to survive on such a limited amount of income."

I'd say it's doable to live just about anywhere in Taiwan on 10-15k a month   Even if I did everything you listed, it'd be a very very tight budget for Taipei."
taiwan,36kp12,DerpyDogs,2,Wed May 20 06:26:49 2015 UTC,"It may be theoretically possible for a Taiwanese person if they manage to finagle a university dorm bed sublet from a student who has one but wants to move off campus.

taiwan,36hmli,Roygbiv0415,3,Tue May 19 18:33:09 2015 UTC,"I was also a delegate of Taiwan in a MUN back in my high school days. But unlike yours, our delegates were actually from their respective countries. The experience resembled real life so much it was uncanny.  The first thing the Chinese delegate tried to do was to expel us from the conference, on the grounds that Taiwan is already represented by them. The constant nagging never ended throughout the entire conference. The U.S. delegates have no clue what's wrong between us, the Koreans won't help, and only the Japanese sympathize us and helped us whenever they can. It was a constant struggle to wrestle influence from the Chinese, and we ended up in a coalition with an African pact for mutual support on numerous issues.   If I learnt anything, it would be that Taiwan's position in the international community won't really improve much even if we are properly represented. The economic power China welds is too great for most countries to ignore, and even for those countries that sympathize Taiwan, eventually must cave in to China's demands."

Xitun is probably the area to go looking. If you browse around on 591 you should be able to get a feel for the possibilities.  Good luck connecting with nature in Taichung though... you'd have to be living out east in Beitun or something and your commute would be killer. Taichung is known for having terrible transit and lots of traffic so stay close enough to the university for your comfort."
taiwan,36gumj,x3nomik,2,Tue May 19 09:00:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, from the university to the mountains seems to be only about 13 kms, but traffic changes that I'm sure. I know back in Colorado, 13 kms would only take me half an hour on my bicycle, but here in Osaka, 20 kms took me 2 hours because of traffic and stoplights.   So I guess long rides will have to be well-planned. I heard cycling is huge in Taiwan though.  I'll check out the area you suggested. Thanks mate!"
taiwan,36gumj,x3nomik,3,Tue May 19 10:34:13 2015 UTC,Cycling is huge here... just look up Taiwan In Cycles or Michael Turton's posts about cycling in Taichung. There's a huge amount of info and you can really get a feel for what's possible.

taiwan,36gumj,davidonformosa,3,Wed May 20 02:10:45 2015 UTC,I used to live near Providence University which is a bit further out from the city than Tunghai University. You could rent a studio apartment there for as little as NT$3000 per month. For around NT$5000 you could get something a bit bigger and more comfortable. You could probably rent a house for less than NT$10000. It will certainly you get you a big and comfortable apartment.   The environment around that area is not great. You can probably find some good trails for running around Dadu Mountain (the hill which Tunghai University sits on). Most of the good cycling roads are on the other side of Taichung. They are great when you get there but riding across the city on a bike to reach them isn't really pleasant.
taiwan,36gumj,Under-The-Veil,3,Tue May 19 12:51:31 2015 UTC,I really like the neighborhood around Tunghai there is a good night market and the campus is nice. You will be able to score a nice rental for 10k with no problem a older place will run you 5K for a 1 bedroom. I would not want to move into Taichung if I was going to that university as the traffic pretty bad.   Dave has some good advice if you want to save some bucks and still be pretty close.  100Mbit internet is around $1000ntd  3G phone plan is - 400ntd  4g ultimate plan is around $1200ntd  Electricity can get expensive in the summer if you run the AC a lot. Make sure your place has one that works. Water and gas is cheap.  Food is cheap but eating healthy can take a little extra work. I don't think there is any grocery store around the university and am not sure about the traditional markets.

I have an iPhone 5s from Japan, btw... do you know if I will be able to use it in Taiwan with a sim card from a place in Taiwan? Or will I have to get a different phone?   It sounds like I can live pretty well for 1000 USD a month. If I'm able to start doing freelance web development or even some Japanese translation work online, I'll be pretty well set."

taiwan,36gumj,pipedreamer220,1 point,Tue May 19 10:32:40 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm a Taichung local.   What I'd suggest you to do is find an apartment that is close to Zhonggang road 中港路. There is a BRT line that goes straight to Donghai university with its own lane, so you don't have to worry about traffic. Also it's free with an easy card (a prepaid card that can be used for public transit, at convenient stores, and very recently, night market).   Rent in Nantun district and Bei district isn't too bad. Plus in the city you can pretty much find food around the clock, convenient stores within walking distance, more selection of restaurants, supermarkets are close by, and plenty of traditional markets were you can buy fresh fruit and veggie for cheap. Also more gyms, mall, pubs, and cinemas in the city.   Donghai art street and night market area is convenient and all, but I absolutely hate going there. The tiny streets are filled with people, scooters, and cars. The air quality is just awful. My allergy acts up whenever I go there.   Do get a scooter. Taichung public transit can be confusing and messy.   Edit: forgot to add, my dad is also into cycling and he normally goes cycling in Dakeng, sometimes all the way to Xingshe. He lives close to the science museum and he bikes to Fengyuan for work all the time. There are cycling routes, you just have to get out of your way to get to them."

taiwan,36crp2,thundrd22,1 point,Mon May 18 12:02:00 2015 UTC,"Stop into any of the local fruit markets near your house. Head to to their refrigerated section, and they are bound to have at least one or two. They'll probably be bigger, fresher, and unfortunately a little more expensive than the ones at the Wellcome.  Wellcome is not known for their produce department or low prices. Carrefour produce can at times be an insanely good deal, but check the quality before you buy them."

taiwan,36de83,MaryboRichard,9,Mon May 18 14:26:41 2015 UTC,I think lenses here are extremely expensive because I see so many students and young people wearing glasses without lenses. They must not be able to purchase them.

taiwan,36dcrt,Tyberos,3,Tue May 19 03:22:20 2015 UTC,"When you cut an audio wire you get either three or four wires. left, right, mic, and ground. Mic is usually the fourth wire.  The first thing I can think of is: 1) Have you used regular headphones and verified that your audio out jack is functioning? 2) Are you measuring DC or AC voltage? There should be no DC voltage in an audio signal as DC signals could possibly damage your cone. 3) Did you verify that the earplug (headphone?) cable was working beforehand? If not, get a protoboard and a resistor and make a simple RLC circuit. 4) When you say no voltage, do you mean 0.0 V or do you mean negligible voltage? 5) Are you plugging the cable directly into the speakers or through some sort of amp?"
taiwan,36dcrt,fhsd4264,2,Mon May 18 17:43:43 2015 UTC,if you've reconnected to an earphone and get nothing then you're either missing a connection or short circuiting... take some pictures of what you get... when you reconnected did you sand the wires lightly to get rid of the coating? did you solder or just twist... finally did you insulate with tape or shrinkwrap?

Almost any company here can hire you and help you obtain an ARC, but some companies don't know how to do that or possibly just feel like it is a waste of time. There are a lot of qualified foreigners now that speak amazing Chinese and also hold masters degrees with permanent resident cards (APRC) or marriage resident cadrs (JFRV) that don't need a company to sponsor them.

I bring this up because, depending on where OP is from, this might come as a surprise (i.e., for me back home a ""trail"" is unpaved and nothing like the stepped/paved trails around Taipei area).   Bring...sun protection however, with this weather it's very important.   OP this is an excellent point, it cannot be stressed enough. The summer sun is brutal and can quickly wear you down. I finally broke down and bought a big floppy hat that covers the entirety of my head, and while I know I look silly wearing it, I just don't care. (In the past I tried using sunscreen, but my sweat would cause it to run off. Since the sunscreen was white it made me look like a 鬼.) OP, consider some kind of hat that covers your face, ears, and neck. Also consider carrying a small hand towel that you can use to wipe away sweat.   Bring a truckload of water   OP, I don't recall there being a 7-11 on the road that leads form the MRT station to the start of the Elephant Mountain trail (I'm sure there is one somewhere close by, I just didn't see one). Consider purchasing your bottles of water at a 7-11 before getting on the MRT. The big bottles of water are inexpensive (maybe $25?). If you prefer, you can buy sports water (i.e., like Gatorade in the USA), the largest bottle of which at 7-11 costs about $30-$35. The brand names are ""Pocari Sweat"" and ""Shupao"" (舒跑)."

This does happen in northern Taiwan, but I just saw ""considerable cloudiness"" mentioned in one of the weather reports. Honestly, you are not going to have great weather while you are here. Welcome to (northern) Taiwan.    You can buy a cheap umbrella at 7-11 (about $120-$140). If you're hiking, you might not want to hold an umbrella. If you plan on brining a shell, be sure it is the lightest weight possible, and has pit zips, because it will still be warm (highs of ~28C starting Wednesday, which actually a touch cooler than the recent highs of ~33C).  Pro tip: the sidewalks in Taipei are notoriously slippery when wet (many businesses pave the sidewalk in front of their store with tiles/stones that look nice, but which have absolutely no traction. Why on God's Earth they do this - given how wet it usually is here, I don't know). Be careful.  Edit: I was just thing that, although the weather won't be great while you are here, there's a silver lining: the trails should have far fewer people on them than usual.

I'm not sure how long you will be here, but if you purchase an MRT card, you can use it to rent a YouBike, which is a great way to get around (although the weather while you will be here won't be good). Note: in order to rent a YouBike, you have to register on the YouBike website, which requires providing a Taiwanese telephone number. If you plan on buying a Taiwanese SIM card while you are here (easy to do), then registration will be a snap.  MRT cards can be purchased at any MRT station. There's a $200 deposit (refundable, I believe), and you can use the MRT card on buses too. (The card is called 悠遊卡 in Chinese).  Also, there are YouBike apps you can use to see which stations have available bikes for rent."

taiwan,369c4s,pipedreamer220,3,Mon May 18 14:05:49 2015 UTC,"CKS was only focused on getting back to the mainland, his military spending in the early days of ROC rule over Taiwan was part of the reason for the widespread poverty that followed. His gang of privileged followers that brought rampant corruption to Taiwan was also one main reason he's hated by many.  Those who are reminiscent of CKS mostly were his loyal followers still dreaming of the great dream of a unified China under the ROC flag.  On the other hand, CKS's son accepted that the KMT is never going to rule over China again, so he initiated projects to modernize Taiwan's infrastructure and industry (which had been ignored and steadily deteriorated under a corrupt government since 1949). In his term, he also announced the dissolution of martial law, and Taiwan's democratization could be said to have started with him (although in fact he had no choice due to both domestic and foreign pressure). His continued authoritarian rule also contributes to his negative image.  Generally speaking, if one asks who had done more for Taiwan, then CCK outperforms his father by light-years."

He's a bad dictator, and shouldn't be celebrated, but I don't think most have his actions had a lasting impact on modern day Taiwan (well, except for getting us stuck in an international relations limbo).  There's too much everyday shit going on for me to care about hating CKS really."
taiwan,369c4s,Roygbiv0415,2,Sun May 17 19:19:02 2015 UTC,"CKS is kind of like Columbus in America. Most people don't care, even though Columbus was a terrible and sick individual who knowingly enslaved and tortured and kidnapped innocent people.  Most don't care though however most don't even know that CKS killed 10 million innocent Chinese or that he was the number 4 biggest ""mass murdering dictator"" of the 20th century; mainly because the education system in Taiwan omits this. Some even buy the propaganda that CKS ""modernized Taiwan"" as if Japan did nothing (just like how Columbus never actually discovered North America).  However a lot of universities have had professors and students ask that their local CKS statue be taken down, especially from their history departments which are aware of the crimes of CKS. This was the case for well over 10 years at NTNU (Shida) where they'd petition to take down that CKS statue at the main gate. But NTNU only took it down because NTNU started taking in PRC students (of course the latter is denied officially, but everyone I know who was sitting on the council meetings essentially admit this).  It's basically the same in the USA with Columbus; we still have Columbus Circle, Columbus Square, Columbus High School and so forth and slowly but surely they are having their names changed by people who do care."

Not sure what my parents think. Don't think young people care enough. I was under the impression as a young child that I'm supposed to revere him due to the memorial hall etc. Only when I was in university and I read up about him and realised how horrible he was that I realised I shouldn't like him at all. My mum likes CKS junior. I think that is the consensus that he was the better leader as he ended martial law and changed a couple of laws which allowed Taiwan's economy to boost in the 70s (read wikipedia. I can't remember exactly)."

taiwan,369c4s,laopi,5,Mon May 18 02:15:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, modernization started with Japan. You can start by reading the Wiki article on Taiwan under Japanese rule. Taiwan was being treated as Japan's ""model home"" amongst its colonizations. They put great effort into improving much of Taiwan's infrastructure.   This is not to say that the Japanese were saints (far from it), but the fact remains that it wasn't CKS that brought with him modernization. There's a reason the phrase ""When the dogs left, the pigs came"" (狗走了，豬來了) came to be post-Chinese Nationalist arrival."

The CKS Memorial Hall itself officially had it's named changed in 2007, but has since had the CKS name reinstated.

So thank you, it's very good to know about the ER for the future!  Apparently I'd be SOL tomorrow, as doctors are closed on Sundays.    If anyone checks for doctors in this sub in the future:  A Taiwanese friend actually got back to me and told me about a place on Heping Road near the Starbucks on Roosevelt Ave.  Walk towards that university on Heping from the Starbucks and look to your right.  Tiny place.  It was NT$500 for everything including medicine (fun pack with what I'm guessing is an antibiotic and some versions of Tylenol/pseudo, it's not labeled), I filled out a form with my basic info (have an ID like your passport or ARC), and I got to fumble through my limited medical Chinese.  So bring a Taiwanese friend if you don't have any Chinese skills.  Additional FYI, apparently HIPAA doesn't have a similar manifestation in Taiwan so your problems are for everyone in the room to hear including the patient who came before you waiting for her meds, the next patient in line, and the receptionists, so if you've got a more... sensitive... issue, I wouldn't recommend it."

But yes, it's very common that other patients could overhear your problem. If you do have concerns, I think you could ask the nurse to ask others to leave the room (or not to ask the next patient to come to the room before you finish). Otherwise, the setup is optimized for max efficiency, with little respect to privacy.  Also, the medicine should come with a prescription with name of the drug the doctor prescribes. At least by law they have to. Many clinics here profit from the in-house pharmacy so it's very common to get your medicine there. However, you have your right to ask for prescription and not to fill the prescription there. It may not be a cheaper option though."

taiwan,366769,Carolinerzzz,3,Sat May 16 15:19:41 2015 UTC,"I've generally found my apartments via 591. The site is all in Chinese (don't know if that's an issue or not) but as far as I know that's where the bulk of rental postings are. At one point needed an apartment for just 2 months, found one I liked listed as 6 month leases, so I asked the landlord if 2 months was possible. It was and he just added 1,000 NT per month to the rent.   That being said I've always been physically in Taiwan when apartment hunting, in my experience I wouldn't want to agree to anything before actually checking the place out myself, but maybe for you it's not a huge concern as you'll only be here three months."
taiwan,366769,AlphaMallard,2,Sat May 16 15:55:45 2015 UTC,"What I did was I did airbnb short term to a few places that I like. Maybe for 2-4 days. Then if I really like that place, I'll negotiate with the landlord if they will allow me to stay for longer term with cheaper rate. I can usually get 25-30% cheaper talking directly to the landlord. Just promise them you'll keep it clean and no crazies.   I have done this twice and it worked both times. Now every time I go back I'll let the landlord know a few weeks in advance."
taiwan,366769,qazed,1 point,Sat May 16 16:15:10 2015 UTC,Same here. Except looking for two month lease or sublease :/
taiwan,366769,throwthediary,1 point,Sat May 16 15:45:44 2015 UTC,"591.com.tw has the most listings, but short-term rentals are sparse.  You can try contacting landlords through that site and ask if they are cool with a short term rental in exchange for either paying for the entire 3 months' rent up front, paying a higher monthly rate, or forfeiting a portion or the entirety of the deposit.  Finding a studio apartment (套房) this way will be easier than finding a 2 bedroom.  You can also try a ""Looking for Roommates Taipei"" Facebook group, which sometimes have listings for entire places.  You might luck out and find someone who wants to move out of their 2 bedroom apartment with 3 months remaining on their lease.  Finally, you can try booking an Airbnb for a week or so to start out and then negotiate a longer stay directly with the landlord either at the same property, one of the landlord's additional properties, or possibly the landlord knows someone who has something that's open.  Note that if you work out something like this directly with the landlord then you'll no longer be covered by any insurance/guarantees from Airbnb.  Listings on sites like tealit are typically a ripoff versus the local sites, but you are more likely to find short term rentals there.  In general, reasonably priced short term rentals (especially furnished 2 bedroom apartments) are rare in Taipei, as they are not worth the hassle to landlords who are mostly looking to get returns via appreciation of their property versus rental income.  Most places that list as available for short term rentals will be significantly marked up relative to a year long lease.  So, be prepared to negotiate and search a bit if price is a primary concern."

Your last thread about how you were offended because a local police officer would not speak English with you was enough to convince me. I have rarely seen someone as entitled as you are and I do hope you are trolling, and this is not actually your life. In both cases, I feel very sad and sorry for you. If you check my history, you'll see that I rarely express my views like this, so at least there is this to make you special.   For transparency sake, I will leave this thread open, and I won't ban you right on the spot like I was tempted to do. But bear in mind that you are not welcome in /r/taiwan   That would be the last comment you have from me. I won't engage you in further discussions and I won't even bother about your critics.

taiwan,361kgc,benson2009,15,Fri May 15 09:20:39 2015 UTC,"Cultural difference, really. There are social norms that Taiwanese people expect others to observe, and when an oblivious ABT shows up, it really irks some people. It's not really that the person is bad, just his behavior that was ok in the states are not acceptable in Taiwanese eyes. It would be similar to an oblivious Taiwanese going to the states, and calling an African American ""Negro"".  When enough ABT people (unknowingly) do such ""weird"" things, the whole group gets labeled and rejected."
taiwan,361kgc,Roygbiv0415,13,Fri May 15 09:43:15 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. As an ABC/T myself, I can't help but admit that many of the negative stereotypes are true. Other than being oblivious to customs and cultural norms, many ABCs I know carry this superiority, or inferiority, complex when they're in Taiwan. They talk loudly and flaunt their superior English skills thinking no one can understand. And whether you like it or not, it is true that most ABCs are rich and party a lot. I get a similar response to OP when locals first encounter me, but after a few minutes of conversation they often tell me that I'm not like the typical ABC, which then I tell them that we're not all the same. I completely understand where they're coming from though, especially having studied at an American school in Taiwan which are 70 -80% ABC. The truth is, in fact, we are rich spoiled bastards."

This is a question I've been wondering for a while and only because it's from what I observe here in this subreddit. A lot the posts from CBT/CBC/ABC/ABT asking about repatriation/working in Taiwan are almost immediately downvoted.  Case and point: https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/360k1x/studying_chinese_convert_a_visitor_visa_or_apply/  75% downvoted, and not a single response.  I understand that this sub has an extremely informative sidebar, but all the downvotes seem to give off a hostile/resentful vibe instead of a 'downvote cause didn't read sidebar' feel.  Now onto the topic at hand. As a CBC that doesn't come from a rich family, I just want to say that it's not just a one way street. A lot of Chinese/Taiwanese Nationals that come to Canada/America also display the same type of flauntulous and superiority complex behaviour here; some of us resent them for it, some of us don't. So this behaviour is not exclusive to just North Americans visiting Asia, it's just how some well off people are. Please keep in mind that not every North American that visits China/Taiwan are loaded with money.  The question I want to ask is; How does a CBC/CBT/ABC/ABT visit Taiwan without locals thinking we're snobs or something?

I think it's my fault for not knowing Chinese. If I knew,  I could tear down this language barrier from my side. But I also think that not only the local students, but Taiwanese people in general are not experienced in dealing with ABCs and Westerners. Not many get to live/study abroad in Western countries to broaden their perspective because it's expensive to do so. Much of what they know about Western culture comes from what they see on the Internet and TV. So it's not just the language barrier, it's also the lack of understanding and experience. I think this would also explain why some locals would resent ABCs. If they got to know more foreigners from say America or Europe, they would probably feel different. The reality is... they don't."

On a bit of a side note, I have the weird habit of immediately counting the money I take out and showing this process to the security camera, but it's not like it's really helpful for me to do that (i.e. there's likely no situation in which it's going to benefit me to prove that I was given the correct amount of money)."

Whether paying my mobile phone bill, or performing a transaction at the bank, it seems like many transactions require duplicate/triplicate paperwork and a minimum of 4 different stamps (of red and blue color). I kid...but only slightly. Taiwan is a modern country with a staggering number of engineers and many leading technology companies. It's not some backwater like Japan (again, I'm just teasing. But it's no exaggeration to say that Japan is singlehandedly keeping the fax machine industry in business...)  To answer my own question: my best guess is simply that a piece of paper is tangible - something you can see and hold in your hand, which culturally may still be more trustworthy that something you see on a screen. (See also: using cash for (almost) everything in Taiwan).   Oh, and while I'm at it: web design. So I feel like Taiwanese websites are still stuck in Web 1.0. The best example I can think of is  pchome.com.tw. Why? (To be fair, I don't think amazon.com is much better, frankly. Ugh.)

taiwan,360au3,chuiniu,1 point,Mon May 18 23:39:08 2015 UTC,"One of my friends recently moved to Taiwan (was there for vacation, but ended up being offered a job). She was offered a job as an english tutor/teacher at I guess a buxiban. She says she usually has one on one tutoring sessions for about an hour and a half each, and it's normal to have a small class to teach as well.   She's in Kaohsiung, and a CBT, her salary (under a year contract) is 38,000NTD. Is this considered the low end as an English teacher? Do the buxibans usually end the contract after 1-2 years, or do they keep going as long as the teacher is good?"
taiwan,360au3,463dxj,1 point,Sun May 17 18:57:53 2015 UTC,How many hours per week is she contracted to work?
taiwan,360au3,chuiniu,1 point,Sun May 17 19:01:42 2015 UTC,"She's been doing unpaid training for the past 3 weeks (about 15hrs/week). Her contract officially begins tomorrow (May 18), and she told me she's scheduled to work 2PM-930PM Monday-Friday. She also mentioned that there may be some weekend hours with extra pay as well.  Are buxibans extremely keen to hire native English speakers when given the opportunity? My friend said her interview was extremely short, and she was pretty much hired on the spot.   Long story short, it was originally her brother that applied for the job while still in Canada, but they asked her if she wanted to work with them as well since she is already in Taiwan.  -> Went in for interview, it was their first time seeing her resume, but she was hired right then and there.  She was pretty much the perfect candidate for the job. Recent university graduate, prior teaching/tutoring experience (piano/Sunday school), and natively spoke English."
taiwan,360au3,463dxj,3,Sun May 17 19:10:02 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to rain on her (or your) parade and I am not involved in the buxiban scene so take this with a grain of salt, but that contract sounds absolutely horrible.    Working ~37.5 hours per week at NT$38k per month puts her at ~NT$250 per hour.  For reference, the starting rate for (edit: foreign) buxiban teachers tends to be ~NT$600 per hour.    Sure, she has guaranteed full time hours, but she could be working less than 20 hours per week and still take home the same amount of money.  Just take a look around TEALIT, the Kaohsiung Teaching Jobs Facebook group, or other job sites and compare.  Additionally, if she is a CBT with Taiwan citizenship then she doesn't even need a work permit, so she could (with a bit of work on her part) find her own work with private students completely legally and probably charge NT$1000+ per hour or at least find a job that's not going to lock her into a contract (which schools that offer a work permit require).  Locking herself into this contract for a year seems like a horrible idea unless there is something I'm missing.  This school is getting a hell of a deal.  edit: regarding the renewal of the contract, this school will probably want to renew her contract as many times as possible unless there are significant problems with her teaching or other issues."
taiwan,360au3,chuiniu,1 point,Sun May 17 19:23:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the informative reply. Yeah I thought something might've seemed a bit fishy by the way they wanted her to sign the contract ASAP. I wish I could've informed her of her options before she agreed to the contract. She had the interview a week before she planned to come back to Canada; so I guess she didn't really think to research her options and just jumped to say yes because living in Taiwan and teaching in general were things she really wanted to do.  38,000NTD/month comes up to about the equivalence of $10CDN/hr full time here in Canada; which is below our minimum required wage, but I thought it was a bit above average in Taiwan considering the difference in cost of living..."
taiwan,360au3,463dxj,3,Sun May 17 19:45:16 2015 UTC,"Sure, if she was a newly minted local Taiwanese university graduate then this would be a decent salary.  After all, it beats working at McDonalds or 7-11 for ~NT$100 per hour.  However, your friend is obviously in a completely different category and let herself get taken advantage of.  She should look into what her options are with regard to extricating herself from this contract.  I would love to hear the school's justification of why they are paying her so little.  edit regarding extricating herself from this contract: If she's happy with the contract, even after looking at alternative options, and can live on that amount of money comfortably, she should do what she wants.  However, salary is not only about current income.  She could be hurting her ability to negotiate her salary at her next job by taking a salary that's so low."
taiwan,360au3,chuiniu,1 point,Sun May 17 19:58:12 2015 UTC,"She graduated from an Ontario (Canada) university last year, and she has been in Taiwan just over a year now. She studied Communications.  Honestly, she seems to be enjoying her job, and just loving the fact that she's able to work and live in Taiwan now. So it'll be hard to kind of rain on her parade right when her contract begins.  I looked up the buxiban that hired her, and they had a listing for the position she took. The position has a pay range of 35000NTD-45000NTD (updated to 40000NTD now).  To correct myself earlier, her monthly salary is actually 36000NTD/month, not 38000NTD/month.  Also, another question about Buxibans, are they something that only wealthy children go to, or is it some extra curricular thing that every student goes to? She says most of her students are from the American School in Kaohsiung."
taiwan,360au3,463dxj,2,Sun May 17 20:13:24 2015 UTC,"Hey, if she's happy, she's happy.  I had no idea the hiring situation for buxiban teachers in this town was so dire, but like I said I'm not involved in that scene.  KAS students are going to be some of the top students in the city.  If she were to tutor these students independently, she could probably command ten times what she's currently making more per hour.  It is very common for students of all income levels in Taiwan to attend a buxiban."
taiwan,360au3,chuiniu,1 point,Sun May 17 20:26:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're exactly right. Perhaps if she ever complains about her job, I'll let her know, but for now she deserves to be happy.  You mentioned earlier that 38000NTD/month would be good for a recent graduate of a Taiwanese university. How are Taiwanese universities seen to people in Taiwan? If you've been educated in Taiwan your whole life, are you automatically accepted, or is there a high competition rate with high grade requirements, etc? We have Universities and Colleges in Canada, and I went to a college instead of University, how would my education level be seen in Taiwan? What are Taiwan's nationally accredited/recognized Universities?  I appreciate you answering my questions btw :)"
taiwan,360au3,lalamountain,1 point,Sun May 17 20:43:30 2015 UTC,"Not being Taiwanese, I am not an expert in Taiwanese university admissions and don't know about every step of the process, but from what I understand, placement in the top Taiwanese universities (e.g. NTU) is extremely competitive and is based primarily on university entrance exams.    I don't know how competitive the lower tier universities are and I don't know whether you are automatically guaranteed a spot in a Taiwanese university as a Taiwanese student who has completed high school.  I'm not sure what the difference is between a university and a college in Canada, but I would imagine a degree from either would be considered to be equivalent to a Taiwanese university degree, but it depends for what purpose.  Foreign university degrees from the US, Canada, the UK, etc. are generally looked upon quite favorably here.  As I mentioned, this is not really my realm of expertise, so anyone is welcome to correct me here.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_universities_in_Taiwan  No problem.

taiwan,360au3,chuiniu,1 point,Sun May 17 21:24:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with chuiniu, it sounds like your CBT friend is simply being discriminated for not being white, so the buxiban is paying her way less.

taiwan,360au3,chuiniu,1 point,Mon May 18 03:06:02 2015 UTC,"Here's something I remembered while I was trying to think of a reason why the pay would be considered low...  She said that all the KAS students have their own English homework/workbooks; so all the teachers/tutors need to do are just supplement and reinforce what their books are teaching, just pretty much help them understand more if they don't understand while in KAS.  However, for the students not in KAS, the buxiban has their own books/materials that they give to her to teach. So (for now maybe) all she's doing is just teaching the book and providing activities to reinforce their learning. She's not actually making up lessons from scratch. I'm not sure if all buxibans operate this way or not, it's just what she told me.   She does mention that a lot of the students families drive luxury cars like Maserati, Bentley, etc. So maybe the buxiban is able to charge a high premium while keeping overhead costs down to maximize profit? I don't know how these kinds of places operate, just throwing out ideas :P  I've never heard of buxibans/cram schools until I searched up ""english teaching job in Taiwan"" in Google."
taiwan,360au3,vigernere1,2,Mon May 18 05:37:06 2015 UTC,"At least that means that she won't be doing much unpaid prep outside of her 37 hours that she'll be working per week as she's earning less than a quarter of what those kids' KAS teachers are probably making.  If she was expected to plan all of her lessons (almost surely unpaid) in addition to the horrible deal she's already getting, then that would be an even greater fuck you.  There are teachers in this country who are making twice as much per hour as your friend is by singing songs and playing games with 6 year olds.  It sounds like she's going to be expected to do actual work with actual results.  These parents didn't make enough to buy Bentleys and send their kids to KAS by being careless with money and not demanding the best for what they are spending."
taiwan,360au3,463dxj,1 point,Mon May 18 05:58:44 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to rain on her (or your) parade and I am not involved in the buxiban scene so take this with a grain of salt, but that contract sounds absolutely horrible. Working ~37.5 hours per week at NT$38k per month puts her at ~NT$250 per hour. For reference, the starting rate for (edit: foreign) buxiban teachers tends to be ~NT$600 per hour.   I agree, this is horrible. I have friends that teach online (and no, not for TutorABC) for ~$720/hour (lessons are 45 minutes actually, so the pay is adjusted accordingly). They teach a ~3 lessons a day, none on the weekends, and live a decent life in Taipei (definitely not making $$$, but they seem to cover all their basic expenses, unless they booze it up too much on the weekends)."

My question is, to redeem them, are only the stickers with the current promotion on them valid, or can I use older stickers for newer things?

taiwan,3606gl,Falmer5,2,Fri May 15 04:39:40 2015 UTC,"I was thinking maybe booking for 2 weeks via airbnb   Booking some time in an airbnb place sounds like a good plan and will give you time to find something longer term. Its often what my wife and I do when arriving in a new country/city. We actually start a 1 week start in an airbnb place in Penang on Monday and will be finding something else more long term during that time. That way you can go and see your prospective long term places in person which I highly recommend doing. Stuff like being next door to a night club, being on a street that makes you feel like you are going to get robbed, being next door to a construction site etc are very easy to spot in person but very hard to spot online.   Whatever you do for your long term place it will likely be a fair amount cheaper than what you are paying for those first two weeks on airbnb. Airbnb is great and we use it a great deal but it tends to be significantly more expensive than what is available once you are there in person. I suspect its because most airbnb renters are people on short vacations who are less price sensitive plus there are lots of apartment owners who can't be bothered with the Internet so you pay the ""booked on the Internet tax""."

That said, I highly recommend you practice your reversing skills (parallel; right angle into parking spots, backwards through s-curves) before coming that day.  Expect to fail the practical once and have to return to retake it:  the test heavily favors those who learned the course through their training program.  You can use the car of the driving office.

Not only for the chop but to be added to the family registry (if that's something you're doing). It can be absolutely anything. I joked about naming myself 巧克力, but in the end stuck with something closer to my real name.   I've been married to my husband for 3.5years by the time we came over here and added me to the registry. We're married in the States, so the process may be different for you but this is what we had to do: get our marriage certificate notarized/verified in the issuing country (issuing county's Taiwanese embassy to be exact), get it translated (did that here in Taiwan), and bring it into the registration office. I did not have a chop at the time, but I did have to sign papers using my Chinese name.   I am pretty sure you are correct in having to go to your specific household registry office to go this.   Also: Taiwan gave us a sweet ""Congrats on your marriage! Now start having babies. Please?"" gift haha it was two mugs and a few brochures on how to adjust to your life in Taiwan as a foreigner. It's pretty cute.   I know you state that you're not concerned if your fiance gets a Taiwanese passports or not, but because you also say you're hazy on the legal mumbo-jumbo I'll note somethings. Again this is from a US perspective and things may be different for Aussie, but some things are set for everyone across the board: In order to at least get permanent residency in Taiwan, the applicant (your fiance in this case) will have to live in Taiwan for 5 years.  The easiest thing to do is to come in on a visitor visa and within 15 days of entering apply for an ARC.  Registering your marriage can be done in a day if you have everything prepared, and getting the health exam result can take up to a week and a half. Americans needed to have a verified criminal report from the FBI. We had to wait on this do I was leaving the country every three months waiting for that to come in.  The ARC will allow the holder to stay in the country (and work) legally for 1 year. Before the 1 year expires the ARC can be renewed for a 3 year stay. Once he gets the ARC he can also apply to use the e-gate to bypass the immigration lines (coming into and leaving Taiwan) like a Taiwan Passport holder can.   I'm on my phone right now, if I think of anything else I'll update later.   Source: Foreign spouse living in Taiwan. Just finished going through the motions."

My advice is to skip the household registration office because it requires a lot of work before you can go there.  If you want a pretty marriage certificate, just have someone make it.  The marriage certificate from the household registration office is boring and apparently there's some cottage industry of people who make the (legally meaningless) decorative licenses."
taiwan,35v4we,nice_wigJanis,5,Wed May 13 19:44:03 2015 UTC,"Get your scooter license. CCU is pretty rural and scooters are definitely the way to go if you want to get anywhere off campus (e.g. Chiayi and surrounding). BTW You might get hit by falling mangos on the road to the university. There are plenty of housing complexes for students off campus. Some are named after Ivy League schools. 'Big Eat Market' (大吃市) is located directly in front of the main gate, and offers lots of good, cheap food. As a student you get access to pools, gym, tennis courts and even a bowling alley. The school probably enrolled you in the National Health Insurance, so you can go to any hospital you choose with minimal copayment. The nearest ones are Tzu Chi at Dalin and Chiayi Christian. Other general advice: Summers can be really really hot, with lots of mosquitoes, so watch out! Stay off grass in general because it's infested with 'Ohbee', an annoying tiny pest the size of a spec of sand that feeds off your blood. Their bites itch far worse than mosquitoes. Also, try the guy's pineapples at the bend of the road leading up the university. They're pretty awesome!"
taiwan,35v4we,dasistkaputt,2,Wed May 13 21:11:00 2015 UTC,"I'd like to refer to some general pieces of information for staying in Taiwan.   /u/dasistkaputt mentioned that a scooter is incredibly useful, which is true, but it's not that you will be stuck in the middle of nowhere. You can also take buses from the university directly. A scooter is more convenient though.   CCU's dormitories are kinda meh. It's super cheap and very easy to make friends with people, because it's directly on the campus and there're always people around, but especially coming from the US, you might ... well ... not like it. Still, I suggest you live there first and then decide if you like it or not.  As an international student or as an exchange student, you can take Chinese lessons for free in the language center. Depending on your regulations, it might even be required. The courses are not bad, but don't expect too much progress if you take one once-per-week-course.  Feel free to ask me anything; I study at this university."

I got my degree from NTHU. It was a great experience. It was a great department in a good school that is reasonably well known in my field. And it's greatest value is getting the next higher degree from a uni somewhere else.

That being said, NTHU is a pretty good university in my field as well. But isn't it way above CCU in terms of reputation at least?  I've seen such abysmal levels in some parts of Taiwanese academia (and to be fair, in other countries as well) that I think OP should be very careful when picking a school.

taiwan,35v4we,keyilan,1 point,Fri May 15 08:09:09 2015 UTC,"Also, you need to be careful because professors will hold you hostage and force you to publish for them before they let you leave, even for a simple masters.

Lots of people say the south only Taiwanese but people generally only speak Mandarin to foreigners (I lived in Tainan for seven years actively trying to learn Taiwanese and it's still pretty crap).  One thing I noticed with language schools is that they teach you the proper pronunciation a la Beijing... Which you barely hear in Taipei, never mind anywhere else. If you have the money do one on one and learn the local accent, it'll help you become fluent and once you're fluent in one variant you can understand and communicate with pretty much all the other variants of Mandarin (you might struggle a bit with someone from Hunan, but people from Beijing also struggle with people from Hunan so whatever). If you only understand Beijing Mandarin you're very limited in who you can talk to and improve your Chinese with in Taiwan.  One thing about ncku is that it's a top university, so most of the university classes are in English and the students are desperate to improve. You'll Find it hard to make friends who don't speak English. Joining a club will help, as long as it's not the international club."

taiwan,35tkkf,chuiniu,3,Wed May 13 21:56:40 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  The thing that native English speakers struggle with most when learning Mandarin is pronunciation, and complete beginners need to learn with someone who will consistently correct them on this.    Beginners are almost never going to get that outside of the classroom, and instead they'll most likely end up as one of those foreigners who are constantly complaining about how they're speaking perfectly yet no one understands what they are saying."
taiwan,35t91c,justanotherwaiguoren,12,Wed May 13 09:08:07 2015 UTC,"I would argue, once again, that for the Taiwanese to at least have options when the time arrives, we need closer ties with at least one other local power that is friendly to Taiwan and at odds with China -- i.e. Japan.  Yes, I know there are historical complications, but if the Taiwanese economy is as reliant on Japan as on China or the US, we're reducing the risk of an economic takeover, and if enough Japanese investment is in Taiwan, hopefully increase protection against Chinese military action.  As for the title, no, I'm a Taiwanese who's not sure exactly what I want, but I know exactly what I do not: political union with China. I would rather emigrate than live as a Chinese."

taiwan,35u8gk,eggimage,3,Wed May 13 15:35:56 2015 UTC,"I'll elaborate for anyone interested. Syntrend is a new computer and tech department of sorts, built next to the Guanhua digital plaza building (It was originally licensed as a public parking lot, that somehow managed to become a 9 story department store -- but that's another story). The idea is to make it the boutique of the Guanhua area, gearing more towards brand / concepts instead of retail. Most major consumer electronics brands (Samsung, HTC, Apple, Canon, Nikon) are represented here, as well as telecoms (Chunghua, TWGSM, and FarEastone) system integrators (Asus, Acer, Lenovo) and peripherals (Razer). Intel is quite a special case here, as it really doesn't expect to sell anything at all -- it's just a place for tech demo and partner support (i.e. Displaying ""Intel inside"" products).  In general I think it's a good compliment to what is already offered at the Guanghua region. People looking to DIY computers and buy components will still look to the old digital plaza building, while those looking for out-of-the-box products can get a taste of what the latest offerings are like, before heading out for the numerous stores lining the alleyways for a bargain. Though on the flip side, I can't see many people actually buying at Syntrend, which makes me question the long term viability of its brand display shops.  Syntrend opens to the public this Friday (May 15). I'd advice all to avoid going this weekend (It's not a trade show, so it'll be there for a while :D), though many shops are holding events and giveaways for the opening. Razer, for example, is giving out 1000 Nabu Xes to the first 300 or so customers for each of the first three days of Syntrend's opening."

taiwan,35u8gk,laopi,1 point,Thu May 14 09:18:05 2015 UTC,"To clarify, it's a tax loophole on how the parking lot became a store; the neighboring and connected Syntrend Building to the Guanghwa Digital Plaza building is basically more of the first floor of Guanghwa Digital Plaza. I remember some people complaining that you can't actually purchase anything directly from the display area of the first floor, that's because it's government built and the first floor is mainly for exhibitions and showing display products for tax reasons. That's why someone has to run stock over from another floor or they'd redirect you to another floor shop to actually buy things. Syntrend is an expansion of that."

Even at its largest font size, the iPad text is tiny. You might think its easy to use, for you, but it's really not for granny. My granny is 87 years young! 87 years where she did without electronics. She can't operate an iPad, period.  So I found through trial and error that an Android tablet is better for this because you can genuinely make large text. Even the smaller screen Xiaomi Mi Pad (its super cheap and shipping is free and overnight) is better for this combined with Wiser, a launcher for Grandma.  http://www.wiser-me.com/  There are other alternatives such as:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=magootablet.com.magoolauncher   https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koalaphone.launcher https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.big.launcher https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.necta.launcher   Ultimately now granny reads her Want Want China Times and newspapers because I set the link there for her. I have it plugged in on an extra long cable that is permanently attached with Sugru putty. Calls to her come in loud and clear since I made sure she can't adjust the volume. The camera is positioned so she can see me and her. Also, unlike the iPad, I have remote control over the android tablet so I can fix things for her remotely. I also purchased a Xiaomi Yi camera positioned over the area so I can help her remotely over the phone, which also is placed conveniently nearby.  I went all out, so total costs was 6999NT for the Xiaomi tablet, 500NT for the Sugru, 150NT for the extra long cable for the tablet, and 1299NT for the Xiaomi Yi monitoring cameras (I brought two more for the bathrooms just in case) and associated memory cards at $399 so I have a week's worth of monitoring if I need to go back."

And unless things have changed enormously since I was applying for college a decade ago, there are very few students clamoring to study literature; the perception is that literature is what you study if you fail to get into law or business.  This is a collective action problem. Everybody agrees that college shouldn't be for everyone... when it comes to other people. My precious little Yen-ting or Yi-chun was obviously born to attend Taida, even if it takes cram school until 10 every day and all day on weekends.  You see people advocating for German-style vocational education (where kids are placed on academic or vocational tracks as early as fourth grade). Somehow these people always seem to miss the fact that all such a system will do is make every parent send their second- and third-grade kids to cram schools so that they'll avoid the dreaded vocational track, which will obviously be the worst thing that could possibly happen to the family."
taiwan,35oxuw,pipedreamer220,8,Tue May 12 09:55:02 2015 UTC,"I've told both my sons that university is not a necessity. If I can find out what they are good at / enjoy, I can provide whatever they need for that, if university is worth doing, then fair enough. If they can learn an ability, like coding for example that does not require a degree to be good at or even to get a job, then uni is not a concern. If they can be entrepreneurial then uni is not needed. Basically for me uni is a necessity only if you require the further studies for something or if you generally lack in motivation/discipline to go out there and claim some part of the world. It's more a back-up just in case you can't be an entrepreneur. Part of the problem in Taiwan is (like with most things in Taiwan) everyone wants the same thing from their kids, high scores, uni, safe job. They all come out of the education factory scared to do anything differently. They don't look for what makes their kid different. Whats the point of being the same as everyone else if you have to join a queue of 100 applicants to earn 25k a month and work 10 hour days, even with a degree. I'm doing my best to encourage my kids to be different, entrepreneurial, at least that's the plan. I shall do my best to avoid sending them to cram schools, so far so good. I want them to go out there and not be afraid of failure. My wife is literally petrified of failure, so much so she refuses to do anything that could risk failure. She works non stop at cram schools and Elementary schools. She's a really hard worker, and good at her job, but she does it all for other people, other people who reap the benefits of her hard work, but she is too petrified to do anything outside the box."

taiwan,35oxuw,pipedreamer220,2,Wed May 13 01:50:12 2015 UTC,"Nice of you to say, thank you. I'm not perfect. The thing is every day with a kid is just as much about changing yourself for the better as it is them. I think the important thing about being a parent is you look for what makes your child special. Like you said, not every child is academically inclined, so you look for (initially) what they are interested in naturally. You can introduce them to things at a young age and see if they stick, think 6 year old skateboarders or pianists. Don't assume they have to be academics. It is important they learn some kind of skill, in my opinion.  My two sons are very different. The eldest who is now 8 loves learning about things, he loves maths, even says its fun. He picks up things very quickly. The other one who is now 6 hates authority, learning, studying etc etc even hates sleeping. I just hope I can find out what he's interested in, but I can't keep him focused as easily as I can the other one. My plan for the eldest is coding, but I'm still learning that myself. I'm currently working on his English.  Just remember a lot of entrepreneurs got where they are by being the type of person they are, hard working, aggressively going after what they wanted, being self reliable, punctual, being ahead of the crowd, being motivated and disciplined. 1 All a degree does these days is put you IN the crowd. Not saying they are totally useless because they aren't. I do my best to make sure my kids keep up with the curve, but I (at least at the moment) refuse to send my sons to cram schools unless its a subject they love or they are being unnecessarily lazy at school/struggling for some other reason.  I guess my final advice would be, whatever you can do, just make sure they don't turn out lazy. It doesn't matter how smart they are, if they are lazy, they won't get anywhere anyway. Get them on track before they hit puberty, otherwise then it's pretty much all over lol At least it was in my case! Now I'm in my 30s trying to make amends."

Now he's got a good reputation and does a decent amount of business and seems to be doing about as well as a small-time SYM repair shop can do. I've got a lot of respect for that guy.

Plenty of coworkers that have graduate degree don't even know what I consider basic knowledge. I, as someone younger, had less working experience, and only have a undergraduate degree, had to teach them.  But yeah, I really shouldn't expect much out of most Taiwanese students.

taiwan,35nd39,vigernere1,3,Tue May 12 01:06:01 2015 UTC,"Taiwanese here, and I can assure you that Laowai has zero derogatory meaning here.   ""老"" (lao) is a general prefix mostly added to relatively older people's last names, to create friendly sounding nicknames, e.g. ""老陳"". ""小"" (xiao) is used in the same manner as well for relatively younger people (though 老王 laowang and 小王 xiaowang has special meanings). Calling a foreigner 老外 laowai goes in the same vein, essentially making a nickname that is pretty neutural in meaning. We also do specific countries in this manner, i.e. 老美 laomei for Americans, 老中 laozhong for Chinese, and 老法 laofa for French, etc. None of these have any derisive meanings."

I'm not sure what romanization you are using, - Tongyong? In Hanyu pinyin it would be hùnxiě/混血（mainland pronunciation would be hùnxuè). I think a better translation would be ""mixed blood"" or ""ethnically mixed"". I've had conversations with Taiwanese in which the term 混血 was used merely as a statement of fact rather than as a derogatory term. ""Mixed blood"" has negative connotations in the West (or at least it does in the USA) but so far I haven't gotten quite the same sense here in Taiwan.  老外 like ""gringo"" in Spanish is a term whose meaning is context dependent. In other words, it can range from innocuous to pejorative. So yeah, I suppose little kids on the playground could call an ethnically mixed kid 混血 as a pejorative term. (I can't think of a single time I've ever heard 老外 used in Taiwan (as opposed to 外國人), but I guess if it was used being used in a pejorative fashion, perhaps I'd be the last to hear it).  From a marketing/advertising perspective, ethnically mixed individuals are in high demand for their ""unique"" look. I have a friend who works for an advertising agency, specifically with children, and it's no exaggeration when I say that a huge majority of the kids are ethnically mixed.   As for how an ethnically mixed kid (or adult) would be treated by an average person in Taiwan? Sure a Taiwanese person will take notice of the person's ""mixed"" features (as would plenty of people in many other countries, including places like the USA), but frankly I think they couldn't care less otherwise."

For whatever reason, it looks like he combined YALE (hwun) and MPS2 (huen).   I can't think of a single time I've ever heard 老外 used in Taiwan.    I have this slightly amusing anecdote: I was walking along Zhongxiao East Rd. When I came up to a crosswalk, there was a woman with her young daughter. The daughter happily exclaimed, ""外國人! 外國人!"" Her mother replied, ""Shh!有些外國人聽得懂妳!"" The daughter then retorted, ""老外! 老外!""  It was cute.

taiwan,35nd39,stoptherage,3,Tue May 12 01:56:45 2015 UTC,"老外 and 混血 are not offensive.  They're simple descriptions，same as 外國人。  Are you really comparing the term to the the n word?   In my experience here, many Taiwanese I've met really don't know the historical meaning and weight of this word.   I've had to tell a couple of local friends here that the word should not be used even as a joke.   They were just stringing together bad words to sound cool.   One person told me he used that term when he got angry at a black person in Taiwan.  This leads me to believe that many Taiwanese here don't understand the historical weight of the word.  Your students obviously don't understand the gravity of the word.   Growing up in a predominately black community until graduating highschool and having best friends that are black growing up, I was shocked when I heard the word being used here."
taiwan,35nd39,PNR_Robots,2,Tue May 12 12:26:32 2015 UTC,being called lao wai is like being called african american for black people.... I am not sure there is any derogatory intent when people here say it. When used it is just a shorter version of 外國人.

taiwan,35lrk0,jamiepitts,3,Mon May 11 15:28:05 2015 UTC,"I live in one! Currently listening to the frogs outside the window (our complex is full of little streams and ponds).   Honestly I really like them compared to the old houses. The build quality is good and there's a place to park your car. Community events, complex facilities like pools and classrooms and since people wander the complex to relax you actually meet your neighbours. It's nice.  There's a lot of charm in the old neighbourhoods, particularly the village ones where everybody still knows each other and grew up together. But we must admit that most of them look like slums, especially from above. And the community feel is almost non existent in most of Taipei now, unless you live in a community that organizes events.  Our community is on the edge of Tamsui in the new area being developed amongst fields (reclaimed land maybe?) So I don't know much about old streets. I think there's should be some type of planning regulations to stop people building shiny skyscrapers right next to century houses, but it doesn't seem likely.  Edit: just read the articles. No development around the old street up here, it's a major asset so I'd be surprised if they ever allowed it. It's all along the edges. What happened in Xinzhuang sounds like a travesty though."
taiwan,35lrk0,himit,2,Mon May 11 16:04:48 2015 UTC,"Eh, the vast majority of Taipei's houses were built postwar and frankly nothing of value would be lost if they were all torn down. There are some surviving Japanese-period row houses on the west side (including a surprising number lining Hengyang Road) that would look really nice if they were cleaned and restored. The rest? Bring on the skyscrapers I say.  I'm not proposing building those 20-30 story buildings with horrible kitschy ""European-inspired"" designs everywhere. But you can find modern 5-10 story apartment buildings with elevators and parking, but still allow for nice old-school designs like roof overhangs and first-floor retail, all over Taipei. They're just usually the only new buildings among blocks of 60s-style apartments. If most of the city could be like that it would be a huge improvement."

taiwan,35lrk0,tedmisc,1 point,Tue May 12 18:24:17 2015 UTC,"I'm familiar with the place you're referring to: 淡海新市鎮 am I correct? I also closely follow Taipei urban planning as a hobby and am quite excited about the 公辦都更 governement mandated urban renewal projects the current Taipei mayor is initiating.   淡海新市鎮 mainly grew out of a severe affordable housing shortage in the city. They are currently building a new light rail system which connects the complex with the MRT system. If it weren't for that, the new city would wind up a ghost town just like the ones in China. This sort of explains why the new city is completely residential with an unusually high planned population density. The original purpose was to provide future potential Taipei residents with affordable housing, compared to the city center, and with a convenient means of transportation to downtown. Though I agree, due to the completely residential design of Danhai, the streets will probably look deserted for the most part. That being said, Danhai hasn't been living up to its intended purpose. Due to wealthy domestic and foreign investors, many of the apartments have become, once again, unaffordable to the average household. Fortunately, there's been an attempt to cap the prices but I haven't followed up on that.   Until recently, there's been a lack of government intervention in trying to provide convenient affordable housing in Taipei. I have high hopes for the new mayor's plans which will hopefully improve some of the major housing issues. Urban renewal projects, however, come with a cost. A lot of local culture and communities might be lost in the process. Except for a few instances, Taipei has been preserving designated historical buildings, but it is the non-designated ones that are of concern. For instance, there's been a great deal of controversy regarding the preservation of a former military village near Taida, which hasn't qualified as a historical site. I personally believe preserving historical buildings is one of the most import considerations during urban renewal projects, but I'm also for improving living conditions in disadvantaged areas. A balance needs to be struck. With all the recent talk about urban renewal, we'll just have to wait and see and hope for the best."

Since they made the train tracks underground, it frees up a lot of useable space. Also, he selected over two dozen former shoddy government housing complexes built almost 50 years ago for urban renewal. Those living in the existing housing complexes would be subsidized accordingly and transferred into the new complexes once completed. As for the new projects, I think they will mostly be for rent at a low price. He plans to build 50 thousand units within 8 years which is very ambitious."
taiwan,35lrk0,TotesMessenger,1 point,Tue May 12 11:20:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this great info!   Historic preservation is so important, and often very special places such as veteran's villages or even interesting alleyways are overlooked and lost to redevelopment. In a way, cities should make it a goal to not only preserve, but to also create the street structure that allows for the generation of new interesting places by common people. Similar to how a coral reef promotes life.  It may seem infeasible that 淡海新市鎮 could become a bad place to live, but planned places often become so. So many details are overlooked, and if locals aren't able to fix things ad-hoc, social problems can accumulate. For example, crime may increase in places without small street businesses to keep ""eyes on the street"".   If the society in 淡海新市鎮 becomes a perceived failure, it may then be concluded that providing affordable housing is a failure (when in fact it is the ""structure"" that often creates bad living conditions). This happened in many cases in the United States -- large housing projects were built, but 1. only a limited band of economic classes were moved in and 2. few opportunities for naturally-occurring ""street life"" were created. A lot of interesting, old communities were destroyed in order to ""solve"" social problems.   I wonder if it is possible for affordable housing to get built among the historic parts of Taipei, spread evenly throughout the city, preventing concentration of one form of architecture. This way any structural problems that emerge can get mitigated by adjacent ""normalcy"". Furthermore, unintended effects such as wealthy people accumulating empty units are somewhat predictable and means that even more total units need to be created."

taiwan,35k4gf,lalamountain,9,Mon May 11 04:38:51 2015 UTC,"Basically, Chu is the only remotely electable candidate the KMT has left. Problem is, he's said repeatedly that he's not running in 2016. This being the KMT, everybody assumed that he was just feigning disinterest and waiting for the ""right moment."" Along the way it got into some people's heads that ""the right moment"" was going to be immediately after Chu meets with Xi.  Because of this, people were expecting that there will be some major announcement out of Chu's meeting with Xi, so that Chu can prove that he's better at dealing with China than Tsai is.  That obviously failed to happen, Chu is still insisting that he's not running, and KMT primary registration is closing in five days. So KMT people (especially legislators who were hoping that Chu will help turn out straight-blue voters) are getting desperate.  (Personally, I suspect they'll find some way to nominate Chu anyway even if he doesn't register by the deadline. That's how the KMT works. But they need to get him to agree, and I think he genuinely doesn't want to run.)"

Chu and Xi reassured KMT-CCP platform and affirmed again that any negotiation should based on the ""consensus from 1992 meetings"". Chu called for more global participant for Taiwan while Xi responded generically (that is, PRC will not change attitude toward this topic). In short, CCP doesn't make any new commitments or deals, just repeat their previous stance (cooperating with KMT and questioning DPP). KMT want to show that they can still have ""peaceful and meaningful talk with China while DPP couldn't"", though they only get limited supports -- no meaningful topic brought up and none were agreed by both parties."

While they are in Taiwan these people are the loudest and most vocal taidu supporters. Funny isnt it? What kind of pathetic hypocrites are these?   I fail to see the problem with this. Profiting from the current setup and wanting that setup changed would not be hypocritical. Pretending to want it changed but not doing anything to change it, that would be hypocritical - but you say they vote DPP which would mean they are doing something to change it.  Or do you feel that not complaining about Taiwanese dependency on trade with China while being in China is hypocritical? You have a point there, but then China is not a free country, freedom of expression is not guaranteed there.

Its clear to me you have not seen DPP sponsored dinner events during the run up to elections. KMT also have these dinner events. DPP/KMT sponsor these events to drum up election fervor in every single mainland Chinese province where Taisang are strong in numbers.

My concern/question is am I supposed to eat the cost of that (~$900 USD) exit ticket if I get a TEFL in the country? Or is there a better way to buy an exit ticket?

taiwan,35klmr,kaidi86,1 point,Tue May 12 09:36:01 2015 UTC,"Well you won't be making that much here unless you have connections or awesome credentials. The reason why your buddy gets paid that much is probably because of the lack of availability of western instructors. Taiwan is awash in western instructors. So it's a crowded market. Fluency in Mandarin makes no difference and can in fact hinder the learning process because your students are not forced to use English to communicate with you. Being fluent probably helps in negotiation with the families and/or being familiar with the culture so that they feel more comfortable.  If your hell-bent on teaching in Taiwan, then it's best to go with a ""chain"" school such as Hess, where they will train you up a bit before they throw you into a classroom.   To be honest, the people who run these language institutes do it for the money.  It is terribly regulated. They are typical business folks who are not so honest. So you got to be careful before signing contracts. They are well-known to take advantage of unwitting foreign newcomers. You'll be working your butt off 6 days a week, working with kids. Sound good? Some can handle it for a while and you will make some money. Just not oodles of cash as you might imagine. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, there is no shortage of instructors here, and hourly wages have gone down over the years as a result.  If you are into making money, the Mainland or South Korea are a better bet."
taiwan,35klmr,kaidi86,1 point,Tue May 12 15:36:07 2015 UTC,"You don't really need a TESOL or TEFL certificate to teach English in Taiwan (though it doesn't hurt and can be especially useful if you don't have any prior teaching experience). You do, however, need at least a BA degree. As an American, you can enter Taiwan with a 90 day landing visa to look for work or while your employer applies for your ARC (Alien Residency Certificate). You don't need to apply for the landing visa in advance. You can get it when you arrive in the airport.   Just as an FYI it's pretty easy to get decent jobs at public elementary schools in places like Yunlin County where you definitely won't be surrounded by foreigners. Those places have a lot of need because they can be difficult (read: isolating, boring) for foreigners who can't speak Chinese. I'd pay attention to how far your village is from the nearest train station though because if it's too far, traveling on the weekends can be a bit of a pain.  One thing to consider...have you been studying simplified or traditional characters? If simplified (and you want to continue learning simplified) you might be better off looking for work in China. Also, spoken Taiwanese Mandarin (local languages aside) is a little different than spoken Mandarin used in China. Coming from China, I haven't had too many problems (especially because I lived in the south where they say ""nali"" instead of ""nar"", etc) but even still there are variations in both vocabulary and some sentence structures. It's not a night and day difference but if your goal in coming here is to learn Mandarin you might consider exactly what you want to learn and what you want to do with the knowledge in the future to be sure you're coming to the right place.   All that being said, I certainly don't mean to discourage you from choosing to Taiwan. I lived in China for three years before moving here and while there are things I miss about China, Taiwan is definitely a more comfortable place to live and, of course, it can be a very good place to study/improve Mandarin. Good luck!  Edit: Somehow missed your question about applying for jobs before or after arrival...you shouldn't have too much of a problem either way. I think if you want a job in a more rural environment it's probably easier to apply in advance and do a skype interview (this is just my opinion, though). Also, the hiring season for the fall is well under way so I'd start looking into it soon...but if you're happy to work at a buxiban then you can always look for something later. You can check out http://www.eslcafe.com/  or http://www.tealit.com/  for jobs....And, there are loads of facebook groups devoted to this as well."

taiwan,35klmr,kaidi86,1 point,Mon May 11 08:36:31 2015 UTC,Not exactly... I did forget that you need at least a sub-license though. I don't have a teaching license and I was instructed by the school to apply for a substitute teaching license in my home country and that was sufficient. Most public schools outside of Taipei (I've heard different things about Taipei and have never worked there so can't comment on it) will accept this kind of certificate in lieu of an actual teaching license. This isn't some shady scheme I hatched up to scam the school...Perhaps it's shady on the part of the school as a way to get around government regulations but it does seem to be quit common. I never claimed to have any more experience or qualifications than I actually do. I've also met numerous other teachers who taught at other public schools who were instructed to do the same. It's not hard to get a sub certificate for most US citizens (if you have a degree and no criminal record). My advice here is just be up-front and honest about qualifications when applying for jobs and see what they tell you during the hire process but not having a teaching license isn't an immediate game-ender.

As others have said, it'll be better (less staring) in Taipei or Taichung, worse in rural areas. Your girlfriend will probably get more of it than you, but it might help to keep in mind that it happens for all non-asians.  Also, there's a saying that people use a lot, ""na ga,"" which means ""that is"" or ""it is"" that is used like 'um' or 'uh' in english. When people are saying it fast and repeatedly (like um, um, um...) it can sound a whole lot like the n-word. We found it rather disconcerting at first, but its not malicious in any way.  Lastly, Taiwan is awesome. The people we encountered were almost all incredibly kind and generous, and any actions directed toward us that we perceived as rude came from a place of genuine curiosity. It's obvious now, but it can be hard to remember in the moment that not all of your social customs apply, so people may not know they're doing anything you consider offensive."

This is less so in larger cities. Taipei has seen it all and shouldn't be much different than any other world capital.  I traveled to very small villages with my Taiwanese wife and was asked a couple of times if I had hired her as a sexual escort. I smiled and said she's my wife!

taiwan,35ehl2,rhascal,14,Sat May 9 15:50:27 2015 UTC,"Over 95% are Han Chinese, the majority of which belong to the Hoklo subgroup, followed by the Hakka subgroup. The remaining population are descendants of Taiwanese aborigines, with multiple subgroups, and people of mixed ethnicity due to colonization by the Dutch, the Portuguese, and most recently the Japanese. But to most westerners it's going to look like a 99.99% homogeneous society, and very few Taiwanese will go far out of their way to explain to you their exact bloodline. And unless you're talking about aboriginal people, it's very tricky to define ""native"", as there has been massive numbers of Chinese that have emigrated here since the 1600s and earlier. Most recently, approximately two million mainland Chinese escaped to Taiwan after the fall of the ROC government in China in 1949. My SO is Han, but her family has existed on this island for a hundred years or so. I would say they are native by now? Here is an article about blacks in Taipei. And here are the most recent statistics regarding the number of foreign residents by nationality in Taiwan. This doesn't include people here on visas or visa-exempt status, by the way. As a personal anecdote, I live in Taipei and I see foreigners every day. I see a black person once every three days or so, and I consider that a reliable estimate, because it is noteworthy every time I see one due to how few there seem to be. Go outside of Taipei to the country side, and those sightings drop dramatically. But Taiwan isn't so rural that people living way out in the wilds will lose their minds when they see a foreigner. It's a small island of only 23 million. They've all seen foreigners before, black and white and every shade between, and no one really seems to care."
taiwan,35ehl2,Tyberos,3,Sat May 9 16:04:01 2015 UTC,"Depends on where you are. If you are in the middle of Taipei then non-asian people are not rare. There are certain areas such as Taipei 101 where you see quite a few non-asian people. I wouldn't be too concerned about being a foreigner, in fact some times you get positive attention.

Probably no worse response than the US: being stared at or an occasional insensitive comment (ask her about how that happens in the US if you haven't already).  Note that white people can get stares also - I was always ""monitored"" by my neighbors in New Taipei, partly out of interest, partly out of concern and partly out of simply being one of the only foreigners living in the neighborhood.   I've experienced far ""worse"" - it's a little creepy as a white guy (-: to walk down the street of an out-of-the-way provincial village in the Philippines and have all the kids and many adults run out into the street in a mob and point and jabber at you, all the time you are wondering if it was them being awestruck, bemused or angry (like Thailand, the Philippines is a land of smiles where you can't always read their emotions).  I chose to interpret it positively and everything worked out fine.  Now I would worry about physical harm if she went to the Eastern part of Germany or Poland or Ukraine.  You have some fucked up white supremacist/Nazi shit going on in those places that is actually dangerous to non-whites.  :-(  I hope she has a fantastic experience.  I think it likely."

It's entirely probable that black people would get it worse than an East Asian like myself, but racist stuff is pretty limited to occasional shouting by skin heads and hooligans. The majority of the Polish people are ashamed of those guys. Often when I do encounter racism another Polish man would later come up to me and apologize that I had to go through that.

I don't think anyone should go into the profession and think, ""Aw, yeah, I'm going to make bank!""  /u/thordwilk, are you an English teacher or do you just happen to currently teach English? The distinction is: Do you have a teaching degree or are you someone with a college degree that speaks English [as a native or second language]?   If the former, you can make similar wages to those in Korea (it's going to be around nt$10,000 less or so). Also, if you are an English teacher by trade, you may make more than if you are certified to teacher another content area.  If the latter, /u/x3nomik hit it right on the money. Starting wages are between nt$600~650 for a cram school, and then any raise you may get it a paltry sum. However, you can supplement this with tutoring outside of your work (though this is technically illegal).  On another note, your post is riddled with errors, which I believe /u/Tyberos and /u/bodangren2 were alluding to.

Also your pay for 21 hours work is higher than you'll find here.  Just my opinion, I'm sure others can chime in too.

I keep irregular hours so this was not an issue for me, but if you work 9-5 then you will find it problematic. Also, my primary focus is weightlifting, so I eventually came to find both the vibe and equipment lacking in that area. The free weight selection is pretty limited, and I also got tired of all of giant packs of Taiwanese bros bogarting the ONE available barbell. I mean, for $50NT/hour you can only expect so much I guess.  I recently joined Taipei Gym and I highly recommend it. No contracts, no nonsense - just $8,000NT/year with no blackout restrictions.

Also, prepare to pay through the nose for music equipment, much of which will likely be old, outdated or somewhat pre-worn from having sat unsold on a shelf for months / years.

What was illegal was not the farm, but the ""farmhouses"" (農舍) built on farming lands.   Farmhouse issue is a very old land usage issue in Taiwan. Due to the decline of agriculture and changes of economic climate, many farmland owners in near-city counties (such as Yilan and Taoyuan) seek to convert their farms into something much more profitable -- country mansions. However, due to many reasons (building codes, taxation, FA leasing policies and whatnot), they never bothered to register their changes of land use, making these ""farmhouses"" illegal. Such ""mansion building"" economic trend also caused much public uproars, for it is often associated with real estate speculations, class strifes, negative impacts on agriculture, and other negative imagery.   For foreigners, to understand the news, some explanations are needed. It's just like how difficult it is for rest of the world to understand USA's abortion issue such as the RU486 controversy that happened around 20 years ago."

Twenty of these passed investigations, while 82 farms were found to be illegal. That means 75.9 per cent of the farms that have been inspected were found to breach regulations.   I read this to mean that ""less than 10% of all farms nation wide are illegal, of this 10%, a minuscule 4% have been inspected, and of this 4%, 75.9% are indeed in breach of regulations, while a quarter actually passed?"

taiwan,359gqb,Pajamas86,23,Fri May 8 05:39:43 2015 UTC,"I guess I'll be the different voice here and say that living in Taiwan has changed me for the better.   Unfortunately, the nature of being a ""typical foreigner"" in Taiwan can make it very difficult to become a better person. The thing is, for the ""average foreigner"" (by which I mean a white, male, younger Anglo-speaking ESL teacher), life in Taiwan can be very, very easy, and this is a double edged sword. We make a lot of money and the cost of living is low. It's easy (easier) to get laid. And if you don't give a shit about being a good teacher, the work can be very, very easy.   The point is, it's easy (if you are a foreign male ESL teacher) to just become a man-child. Especially if you choose to blow your disposable income on booze.   I reached a crisis point a few years back where I saw myself becoming one of these man-children. I decided I didn't want to do that (not that I'm noble or something, it just frightened the shit out of me to imagine myself as a bitter 36 year old pounding beers at the 7-11 and chasing 19 year old club skanks in my cargo shorts).   The fact that foreigners are generally able to make a lot of money is good, if you learn to use it to your advantage. If you work hard and save so that you can move onto something else, it's great (I have several friends who hated teaching and have now moved into starting businesses of their own). Or, if you're like me, you can take advantage of the fact that you can make a living and not have to work all the time (if you live outside of Taipei you can survive on teaching 10 hours a week, if you have some savings). I've used the time not having to work to improve myself by learning skills (guitar, organic gardening, yoga) and exploring creative pursuits.   Just don't flush it down the drain on fucking booze, y'all.   Alcohol is the bane of the working class."

After coming to the US with my Taiwanese wife and kids, I have spend much time thinking about this.  It's difficult to know exactly what Taiwan did for my inner growth which would not have taken place regardless, but maybe we can say a few things.  Living in Taipei gave me an extended, in-depth experience in:   Negotiation,  Marketing myself,  Bending and circumventing rules,  Socializing and networking,  Detecting bullshit,  Speaking Chinese daily, and  Networking to build my business (up to US$10,000 a month when I returned to the US).   From the hundreds of business clients i worked with over the decades (not as an ""English teacher"" but as a ""Language Consultant/Coach""), I learned things about business tactics and strategy which I doubt an MBA program could have provided.    That's de rigeur, and fairly predictable.  I would add something else which was quite unexpected, though.  I find when I am speaking Chinese, I feel differently in myself, as myself, as though a different, happier personality is being constellated.  I really do feel like I am being someone else.

If I had studied here for at least two years of my university undergraduate degree program, I would be able to take any job I wanted in Taiwan. I studied at NTU for one semester, and that's it.  Long story short my dayjob is the same line of work I was in before I even began studying in university: Teaching English. I have a highly technical and legitimate skillset, but it is extremely difficult for any Confucian society (except Korea perhaps) to accept it as mainstream.

taiwan,359gqb,shrimpsnwhitewine,1 point,Tue May 12 16:43:06 2015 UTC,"Great question!  (I want to state that these are my personal experiences.  If I talk about a particular experience that I had, I am aware that not every foreigner will have had that experience, nonetheless, that does not negate my experience.)  I just recently left Taiwan after living there for six years.  For a little background, I arrived shortly after graduating from university and taught in buxibans while also spending a year formally studying Mandarin.    I loved the first two years of living in Taiwan and then I slowly started to dread and eventually hate living there.  I became more cynical, more fearful, and less trusting (and I'll break that down).  More cynical = as an attractive woman with northern European features, I was constantly stopped on the street, at restaurants, in the train station, and given job offers because I ""look like the perfect English teacher.""  In reality, I don't like small children and my looks do not correlate at all to a Mary-Poppins-like magical teaching ability.  The fact that looks count for so much more than actually ability to teach was disheartening as I would see many of my non-white friends refused work when they were much more qualified that I was.  On three separate occasions, I was stopped by people that turned out to own schools and asked by them if I would leave my current job to teach with them.  To be clear, they were asking me to break my contract-- and yet bosses here treat foreign workers like we're the only ones responsible for broken contracts.    More fearful = scooter/car accidents!  At least in Kaohsiung, people just straight up ignored red lights, and when they did stop, it was usually on the zebra crossing.  After several accidents, one slightly serious, I dreaded having to drive anywhere and resorted to walking (no bus route to my job, cycling was just as nerve-wracking as driving).  Less trusting = perhaps because the English-teaching market in Kaohsiung is over-saturated, schools fired a lot of my friends, my bf, and myself for terrible reasons.  The reasons included, but were not limited to-- not playing enough fun games, not being ""white"" enough, refusing to do unpaid ""gym"" classes, and giving too much notice that they weren't going to renew their contracts (ie, giving 3 months notice and getting fired as soon as the school found a replacement).  People say that Taiwanese people are really friendly, and that's usually true, but I'm tempted to see a more cynical side of that.  If you're white and good-looking, it's just kind of a novelty for a Taiwanese person to be able to interact with you, so why wouldn't they be on their best behavior?  Show off the English ability a little?  Break up the monotony of a 60-hour workweek?  Overall, I just got the feeling that the government and people of Taiwan didn't really want foreign teachers to stick around for longer than a couple of years. No matter how good your Mandarin is, how much you try to understand face, or how much you integrate yourself into your community, you won't be truly accepted.  This is evidenced by the fact that is actually illegal to do any volunteer work in Taiwan as a foreigner.  You can be thrown out of the country for doing anything that is not stated as the purpose of residence on your Alien Resident Certificate, for example, playing your guitar at a small concert.  So you can teach here, or if you have a Taiwanese spouse, you could expand into other markets, but rarely without a lot of capital.  Even to obtain a permanent residence card, you would need to have an especially high income, and if your school was one of many that under-reported your earnings for a tax break, you would have a very difficult time reaching the necessary income level.  One last impression-- most buxibans hired only white native-English speakers and gave the reasoning that they were the only ones who could properly teach English.  I think this gave an impression to the students that only white people can ever master English, which as a language learner, must be pretty disheartening.  Schools would claim that it was the parents' desire to have white teachers, but whatever the reason, it can only negatively impact the students' worldview."

Tokyo alleys are the same, lacking sidewalks in many cases. New construction by law are required to have sidewalks and building out over the street is now uncommonly approved. I just got back from Tokyo and I am headed there again, even in districts like Asakusa, sidewalks are non-existent in many alleyways.   I got an expensive apartment at one point in a nice new building and it turned out that the build was apparently made of cardboard and was the noisiest fucking place and everything broke all the time.   I think you may have been severely ripped off then. Any decent apartment will have, at minimum, concrete walls making sound difficult to get through. Dividing apartments with plaster or anything thinner is almost unheard of even in Taiwan. Methinks illegal partitions by a very very cheap landlord. Something is very wrong here or we have different standards towards what constitutes an expensive apartment.   Your choices in Taipei are essentially tiny old concrete shitboxes, or new construction that is put together hastily with extremely poor quality and shortcuts taken at every turn. And the more I look, the more I am displeased with the quality of housing available in Taipei at any price point.   I don't know, I pay in the 30's per month and it's nice. I've been in every hovel and luxury place in Manhattan from Hells Kitchen to some really swanky places on the UWS, aside from low ceilings (we're Hobbits!). I've also been in quite a few places in Taipei and I can tell what a good place is. Near Renai circle are a few really swank places.   Maybe Taiwan could benefit from central air that keeps apartments out of the temperature ranges that breed mold?   That's the thing, good apartments in Taipei do have that."
taiwan,359gqb,just_face,-6,Fri May 8 07:43:12 2015 UTC,"You have to understand, Taipei and New Taipei has the population matching NYC, with a much higher density.    Manhattan is at least twice as dense as Taipei City proper and isn't an urban planning catastrophe.   Taipei was districted by the Japanese so many of the alleys do not have sidewalks.   I am assuming that Japan does things to make this not result in fucking disaster though, with scooters and cars blocking the street while people try to filter by.   I think you may have been severely ripped off then. Any decent apartment will have, at minimum, concrete walls making sound difficult to get through.   The problem was the single-pane windows that allow every sound from every one of your neighbors to permeate your house.  Also, the walls between units were really thin.  I've paid mid-30's for an apartment on two occasions, and both times I was extremely disappointed.  With my last apartment, I just elected to save the extra money because the extra money always seems to go for cheap facades.     That's the thing, good apartments in Taipei do have that.   I've never been in a single residential building that had anything except those janky wall-mounted ACs, and this includes a single family detached house on the outskirts of Taipei.

taiwan,359gqb,ShrimpCrackers,8,Fri May 8 07:59:40 2015 UTC,"Manhattan is at least twice as dense as Taipei City proper and isn't an urban planning catastrophe.   Taipei's population density is 7th in the world. NYC is 114th. New Taipei City has places 7 times more dense than Manhattan. Manhattan is a bit unique because it has the third most skyscrapers in the world for any city. There are tons of huge  apartment buildings and office highrises in NYC which Taipei doesnt have yet. Theres also a lot of complicated factors left out, such as how Taipei buildings mist be able to withstand heavy sun, hot temperatures, earthquakes, and typhoons. As someone who lived in Manhattan for decades, Taiwan apartments aren't half bad.  Depending on where you're living at in NYC, it can ve aweful. Seriously, those tenement houses that we learn about in history where families get diseases... yeah, people still live there.  I take it you've never lived in Chinatown. I have. Heck I lived right next to the Tenement Museum, it was really, really awful to the point where I was catching mice with my bare hands and you couldn't fit an Ikea shelf against the wall because the floors were all at weird angles. My buddies called it the ""Fun House"". There are places in Flushing that are not any better with potholes in sidewalks where I could fit my scooter in. Then there's the traffic, Taipei's MRT and public transportation is leagues better than almost anywhere in the USA. It certainly destroys Manhattan. Also property prices in Manhattan are bad too. It's not really a fair comparison, but given how much you're griping about Taiwan and Taipei, I really think this isn't the place for you. What annoys you may be different from what annoys others but I will see the positives as well, but they're not found in your post. I get it, the same or similar annoyances are why I left NYC.  That said, I'll agree with you that Taipei City isn't the best managed, and it could be run a lot better. Hopefully Ko helps. I'm starting to see parking improvements, while unpopular, I'm starting to see the wisdom in making clear parking slots for scooters.   The problem was the single-pane windows that allow every sound from every one of your neighbors to permeate your house. Also, the walls between units were really thin. I've paid mid-30's for an apartment on two occasions, and both times I was extremely disappointed. With my last apartment, I just elected to save the extra money because the extra money always seems to go for cheap facades.   Like I said, I really think you were ripped off. To be fair, I always apartment hunt with my girlfriend and she's an apartment hunting goddess. Hell, she's great at spending money at anything, like cheap plane tickets, so maybe it's just her. But a luxury apartment without central air and uses plaster walls to divide neighbors? No fucking way, something is up my friend.   I've never been in a single residential building that had anything except those janky wall-mounted ACs, and this includes a single family detached house on the outskirts of Taipei.   Wall mounted AC's are much better than window mounts for so many reasons. But yeah that's what I mean, you weren't living at a modern luxury apartment if you don't have central air, period. You were paying for someone's renovations in a cheap building.   Edit: Also as I leave work today, i'm going to take some photos that really show some annoying as shit issues in Taipei in supposedly nice areas   I don't know, I seriously think your definition of a good neighborhood and mine are different. And while you focus on the negatives, I focus on the positives as well. Public transportation is a hell of a lot better in Taipei than in Manhattan. Furthermore Manhattan is a different sort of place than Taipei. It's not on a subtropical island, and historically the people living in Manhattan are much more richer. Furthermore, the urban planning has always been better in Manhattan. That said, if there is something wrong with where I'm living, I tend to do something about it. It's easier to just move on, but I tend not to. I like to get problems solved.  PS: Sorry for spelling etc. I wrote this on my phone."

For what it's worth, I scored into level 3 for both the reading and listening.

taiwan,355jax,DarkLiberator,2,Fri May 8 02:41:24 2015 UTC,Everyone around me talks about this game. Is it really that good?
taiwan,355jax,DarkLiberator,2,Fri May 8 02:59:23 2015 UTC,Yes. EU4 is my favorite strategy game now. I can't go back to Total War or Civ. Paradox's support for it is also phenomenal.   I'd get it if you're interested in grand strategy games. Its realtime though you can speed or slow it down. For multiplayer the host can speed up or slow down the game. Watch some gameplay on Youtube. If you do get it I can happily teach you the ropes.
taiwan,355jax,DarkLiberator,2,Fri May 8 03:04:22 2015 UTC,I'll have a look but it seems to me like a huge time sink. I need to finish Dragon Age Inquisition before The Witcher 3 and I haven't started GTA V yet :(

taiwan,356w3f,just_face,5,Thu May 7 16:40:31 2015 UTC,"My friend broke his contract with HESS because he got a job at a better school. They said they would fine him the contract breach fee, he threatened to get a lawyer involved, then they just gave him his money and he left. Hess is a corporate cram school that I believe is fairly deceitful In it's hiring practices. I worked there for a year before moving on. I wouldn't feel bad demanding money that I already earned Teachers might have a bad reputation ,but let's not forget the bad reputation of cram schools ripping off foreign workers."
taiwan,356w3f,Pajamas86,4,Fri May 8 04:41:00 2015 UTC,"How much time is left on your contract? Do you NEED to leave now? If it's not so long, just play it out. You keep your money, you'll keep everyone involved from having to clean up after you (I've been there, it sucks rearranging things at the drop of a hat because somebody left without telling anyone), and you can spend the meantime looking for a better job after your contract ends. At the very least, go to the person you trust most in management/EHRD and tell them the situation. See if you can work something out. But above all, communicate."
taiwan,356w3f,majungo,6,Fri May 8 00:34:46 2015 UTC,"I broke my contract with Hess. I gave them notice (about 2 months actually). I wanted to switch to another school because Hess is a terrible fucking place to work (especially if you actually give a shit about teaching, not being a robot/clown/McDonald's flipper of ESL burgers) and also I needed to make more money.  That being said, it's technically illegal for them to withhold that money, and if you're willing to swing your balls around and threaten to take them to court, they won't take it. In my case, they paid me and then asked me to hand over the money. I did it because I didn't want a negative reference, and it wasn't worth the hassle, but I'm pretty sure I could have just said ""Fuck off"" and walked out the door and nobody would have done anything (I had already been hired by my other school at this point).   But also, I would recommend not just bouncing. But Hess is a terrible, greedy, god-awful place and they sure as hell don't deserve your 20k. Again, just think about your comrade teachers."

Fortunately, NT20k isn't that bad (still sucks though). I've seen much worse than this over the years, and every time I've seen it I've said no to the contract. If a contract is entirely one-sided, you shouldn't sign it (unless that one side is in your favor, of course)."

taiwan,356w3f,ThorsMallet,3,Fri May 8 08:15:41 2015 UTC,"According to Article 26 of the Labor Standards Act, deducting money in advance for breach of contract is not allowed. Notice that is ""in advance,"" since you are allowed to be fined, but there is a legal process they are supposed to go through.  Now, I've gone through the process of taking a previous employer to the Ministry of Labor (MOL) not for me breaching a contract, but for the employer doing so. Things worked out in my favor after arbitration. I bring this up because you can fight unreasonable clauses in your contract, as you've signed with little chance to consider the terms of the agreement (in most situations). If you have reasonable cause to break the contract with your employer, you may go this route if HESS tries to take it further."

The US doesn't want to being dragged into a conflict it didn't want. They know they have to control first island chain for their interest, but they don't want and have never committed that they will defend Taiwan in any time in any situation -- because being dragged into a conflict may be harmful to American's interest. (Remember WWI when Serbia (edit: Austria) drag Germany into a fight that Germans didn't want?) That is what Americans called status quo. They've always warned both sides of strait not to act like a d*ck, and pathetically Taiwan is a smaller player here. Of course, interest of USA isn't equals to interest of Taiwan, but we have to make US realize what we are doing rather than do whatever we want and piss Washington off."
taiwan,351bvx,PotbellyPanda,6,Wed May 6 09:28:48 2015 UTC,"But the main thing is, the USA not making it clear whether it will or won't is perhaps the best deterrent. That uncertainty on what constitutes guaranteeing US defense puts a huge leash on both Taiwan and China in terms of actions. Think tanks have all but agreed that this is the real and right reason why the USA should not draw lines on what can or can't be done on all sides otherwise you can be sure that China and Taiwan would park themselves at the very lines of this limitation."
taiwan,351bvx,ShrimpCrackers,4,Wed May 6 17:05:44 2015 UTC,"This assumes China would attack the main Island of Taiwan. I don't think that's how China operate, they work on increments and an attack on the main Island will be self defeating in many ways.  More likely, if they chose military force, IMO, they would try to take Kinmen, no more no less to begin. It's not covered by the TRA so unlikely to have anyone wanting to get involved, its location is right next to China, it would have low civilian casualties, increases strategic superiority. leaves the island of Taiwan intact and then they can sit back and put the pressure on again and see if the Taiwanese dare elect a party that refuses to acknowledge the one China principle.  Assuming this happens under a DPP government, China will have already manipulated world opinion towards the narrative that the DPP reneged on the deal and the last 8 years of negotiations set up by the KMT under the '92 consensus framework."
taiwan,351bvx,JellyBeans99,3,Wed May 6 09:05:44 2015 UTC,"Basically, China can probably take over Kinmen a la Crimea style. On the other hand, Taiwan has a lot more to say and is a lot more politically stable than Ukraine was. It'd be harder for them to get an excuse to invade Kinmen.

taiwan,351bvx,RawKriexy,1 point,Wed May 6 21:46:28 2015 UTC,"You're right in the current state of affairs China must grit it's teeth and pretend to be all palsy walsy with the KMT. But in 2 or 3 years we will most likely have seen a transition to DPP power and a rejection of the '92 consensus. In light of Xi JinPin's statements, they will go ballistic and tensions across the Taiwan strait will be much more tense.  If I were China I couldn't think of anything more powerful than taking Kinmen and Matsu. Nothing I can think of comes even close. It wouldn't even hurt them economically that much as far as I see. Do you think the DPP would ever win another election running on a platform that rejects the one China principle after that? As I noted before, they are not covered by the Taiwan Relations Act, no one is going to come running to engage China in a war 1km off its coast."
taiwan,351bvx,JellyBeans99,1 point,Thu May 7 06:24:32 2015 UTC,Do you think China would copy Russia's strategy with Ukraine by annexing a small area like Kinmen then using proxy forces to wage a low-intensity civil war in order to have deniability?
taiwan,351bvx,Plowbeast,2,Wed May 6 19:27:14 2015 UTC,"The situation is not the same. Kinmen and Matsu are not covered by any international treaty. It's the first line of offense from the PRC and judging the words of Xi JinPing,rejecting the '92 consensus will result with a  “trigger an earthquake and topple hills.”    Indeed if one thinks that China is engaged in an incremental take over of Taiwan, having an antagonistic DPP in power is necessary."

In such a situation, it would be unlikely that the 工廠當 could continue to provide an improving standard of living in China. Since that's what the Chinese populace has come to expect, a huge amount of internal unrest, or even a revolt, would be quite likely. The Chines government is certainly prudent and circumspect in its actions, trying generally to maintain stability and not rock the boat.  Would America defend Taiwan militarily? Probably, but maybe not-- either way it doesn't really matter since it will very likely never be called upon to do so."
taiwan,351bvx,dorylinus,2,Wed May 6 09:30:13 2015 UTC,"I does believe this strategy, but I also have some doubt since Russia seems to be quite tying with EU but still acts like a d*ck.

taiwan,351bvx,PotbellyPanda,4,Wed May 6 10:20:40 2015 UTC,"One thing to note is how much the global community's response to Russia is actually hurting Russia, just in a way that takes some time to show. The PRC government is surely watching this-- and in fact enjoying the fact that Russia is now having to 磕頭 to the PRC a bit in order to make some new economic friends. Unlike Russia, though, China can't just rely on natural resources, like oil, to keep it going, and would face much more serious consequences to its manufacturing based economy if it were to suffer the same levels of sanctions that Russia is incurring."
taiwan,351bvx,dorylinus,4,Wed May 6 10:57:13 2015 UTC,This is a silly question. China wouldn't attack Taiwan in the first place. Why? All the money embezzled offshore by CCP officials would suddenly vanish.

We wouldn't have the modern world we have today in that scenario, I don't think, since another 5 years of war (or even more) could well have bankrupted the US as well. Don't forget that the USSR had the US outnumbered in terms of men under arms (as well as tanks, vehicles, etc.) by a factor of 4 at the end of the war; the American superiority over the USSR was limited to naval and air force. Also remember that the only two nuclear weapons in the world had already been expended; making more was not easy, and took a serious amount of time and effort; they would certainly have not been available for at least six months, if not a year.  It would have been a long, horrible war just as bad as the one that had just ended.

If we were having this conversation in a bizzaro-reality where America never nuked Japan, we'd be talking about how Japan would've never surrendered and how the cost would've been so high and how we were better off with the agreement that we came to with the Empire of Japan.   Japan would probably be some kind of isolated shithole in that reality. Or back on the warpath in a few years.  Similarly, we're in a sort of bizzaro-reality right now regarding the USSR.

If either side attempts to rock the boat on that front, it will likely be met with some efforts to return to the status quo, though I think it's also likely that the US would prefer to see a resolution that maintains a free and democratic Taiwan in favor of one controlled by the currently repressive PRC. Only time will tell on that, of course, but it does mean that Taiwan may be on its own in terms of deciding its future.  I also have to agree that Israel gets much more attention in America, both from the government and the people at large, for a number of mostly historical reasons.

The small old shrine mentioned in the post can be traced back to Koxinga's era, though its current form was rebuilt in 1961. In addition to the two gates featured, the south gate (啟文門) is also preserved, now sitting in the middle of a roundabout. It is the only gate of the remaining three to have a structure on the gate, however the structure is not in the form as first built. Yongqing elementary school uses a portion of the walls next to the east gate to mark school grounds, which my mom (an alumni) remember street vendors on the strip of land which has now been restored as the moat. My brother (also an alumni) recalls the wall being too high to climb over (dah). I myself went to Zhongshan elementary school, next to the south gate."

I don't recall any exciting memories of these relics, having only leaned about them in detail after a high school project. However, for a very long time I've always thought gates are meant to be built in the middle of roundabouts, because the east gate of old Taipei city is also in the middle of one ._.  Bonus fact: Four of the five gates of old Taipei city still remain, with only the west gate torn down in the Japanese era. It should be fun hike to seek them all out.

Or are you just trying to make something that can generate sustainable cash flow?  I also work in digital marketing though I'm more specialized on the search side. For various reasons, I've also investigated the Taiwanese market for fashion/makeup blogging.   The digital sphere in Taiwan for fashion and makeup has a ridiculously low signal to noise ratio. You have a chance if you are actually able produce quality content and build out a network, but most people think their content is quality when it's not. At 50k, you have enough to build out the content for a decent site with modern design and then some left over.   If you're going B2B with the above scenario, the importance of networking cannot be understated. You will never tap into the big dollars if you can't build out a network with yourself either at the center or near the center. If you're going B2C, then I don't think any of your specialties will be enough generate a decent income (I'm using U.S. standards here). At 100k you might be able to sufficiently diversify your marketing channels outside of the internet but if that's all you can throw down, it's sink or swim.  The real power of internet marketing and businesses leveraging the internet is the ability to scale in a market. If your target market is small, which Taiwan's is, you lose out on that advantage.

There are a few notable brand exceptions but I would make the argument that the marketing dollars of these brands had/have relatively low impact and they're surfing by on international brand recognition alone. We conducted a regression analysis once and the highest impact variable was simply price. The product still needs to be presented correctly and communicated effectively, but price was the key.  A lot of marketing flatters itself with ""communicating"", ""leveraging"", ""aligning with consumers"" or whatever nonsense. Chinese markets in general really don't respond well to that. It's not even negative sentiment, they just realize it for what it is and lose interest.   A more concrete example is one time we sponsored a fairly well-known celebrity in Taiwan. Not top tier, but most people knew who she was. Initial engagement metrics were good. Over the course of the campaign, engagement dropped precipitously.

I have a close affiliate friend who made tons during his days and also met a Taiwanese girl and went back to start an affiliate network.   This feels like the modern American romance story. Meet girl from Taiwan. Move to Taiwan.   He said educating his client is so tough.   This is not surprising to me. I've worked with some of Taiwan's largest companies, and client education has been an uphill battle every single time, and depending on the client, it isn't one we always win. Taiwan's digital marketing is still stuck in the 90s. I don't have any good advice on selling CPL. A lot of people there just don't care what you have to say about it. If you're confident in your ability to generate final point conversions, then go with CPS. You'll save a shit ton of time and effort on client education that probably would not have been effective anyways.  The online dating thing doesn't surprise me. I do want to caution that the monetization strategies used by the more well-known dating sites in the U.S. may not be tenable in Taiwan."
taiwan,3535sj,Tyberos,1 point,Thu May 7 15:33:43 2015 UTC,Yeah I spoke to a friend of mine who moved back to Taiwan and started an affiliate network. He said the biggest challenges is trying to educate his clients about performance marketing. The clients still don't understand it. He also mentioned that most digital marketing are cost per sale (CPS) type.  He's doing well though. I still talk to him from time to time. Happy for him.

If you want to get one here, I would say avoid the night market locations at all cost. I have seen them tattooing without gloves out in the open. Go check out the shop and make sure they have a clean shop, use brand new needles, and wear gloves.  In Taiwan, tattoos are not as big of a taboo as in Korea and Japan. However, it is still frowned upon when women have large visible tattoos."

taiwan,352jo4,richardtheassassin,1 point,Wed May 6 23:41:52 2015 UTC,"From what I remember:  There is a stupid interchange in Kaohsiung where there is a two-lane offramp and the two lanes eventually split up to individual lanes that then go on to merge onto different roads.  What always happens here is the one lane gets all backed up and so people stop in the middle of the other lane to try to cut in, blocking the traffic in the other lane.  In this case, there is a backup in the right lane and the woman in the car that is filming is in the left lane headed that direction.   The other car passes the woman on the left shoulder, cuts her off, and then stops to try to merge into bumper to bumper traffic in the right lane.  The woman, justifiably annoyed, honks at the guy, who eventually merges, and then continues driving in the completely open left lane onto the other road.  The honking apparently pissed this guy off, so I guess he merged back into the left lane, followed her, passed her, and then cut her off and stopped, blocking the woman in (there was fast traffic in the other lanes at this point so she couldn't go around him).  He then got out (not wearing shoes), started punching her car, went back to his car and got some sort of pipe with wires coming out of it, started bashing her windshield and hood in, ripped off her windshield wipers, etc.  Basically a SFII bonus stage type situation.    It looked like he might have been close to successfully bashing in the front windshield so he could have directly assaulted the woman.  You couldn't see the driver side window, but I'm amazed that it wasn't shattered.  Otherwise, I think the man would have directly assaulted the woman (maybe he actually did but it wasn't visible).  I think she she either started honking at him or whatever he was doing set off her horn (she was otherwise completely silent).  He then went back to his car, looked like he was getting in, and then came back at her for a third time and bashed her car with the pipe some more.  She eventually gets connected to the police around the time he finally gets in his car and drives off.  I didn't get around to reading the comments on the video, so perhaps there were details I missed or got wrong.  I'm sure it's on the news today."

There was a popular case a while back of an engineer at TSMC (Chinasmack link here) left his $1 MILLION DOLLAR SALARY JOB (NT dollars, lel) to work on farms in Australia.  Asking around various Taiwanese people I know, older Taiwanese were aghast that someone would leave a secure job to do this, but the younger generation is much more open to it.

That's how the TOEIC was born, and that's how Asian people that are unable to answer questions like ""How are you today?"" in real life score 100% at TOEIC :D  EDIT: So just to confirm, there are no mandatory driving lessons on the road in Taiwan, right?

I think it's currently required to have six or eight hours on the road or something, but that it's not very well-enforced. When I learned to drive there was one all-day road trip, where I drove from Banqiao all the way to the Shimen Resevoir. Unfortunately I don't think freeways are open to learners so the OP's annoyance still wouldn't be solved even with better enforcement...

taiwan,34xetm,laopi,9,Wed May 6 08:49:01 2015 UTC,"I'm actually impressed that merging is your only complaint about drivers in Taiwan. Drivers in Taiwan are not aware of what's going on around them. Nor are they aware that their actions may affect others in a way that should be avoided. It's outcome based logic (or ""the ends justify the means"" if you want to expand to the whole culture). If there was no accident, then it's OK. Each action occurs independently from any other action, so logical follow-through, or learning curves tend to remain flat. Also, one never needs to drive on actual roads to get a license. You can pass the written test, then pass the driving test which is on a closed-course in a standardized car. At no point are you tested ""outside."" Hope that helps. Stay vigilant. Be aware: compared to the south, (I'm in KHH) the north is a driving wonderland where everyone obeys the rules."

A lot of people (especially recent college grads) in Taiwan live at home because they don't make enough money as recent grads to move out and support themselves. Average Taiwanese salary 22k NTD per month is not enough to move out and do what you expect as an American recent college grad.   Another reason people live at home with their parents is the culture difference between the western culture and the rest of the world (from my surrounding friends). I have friends from Mexico and the middle east and they told me it is normal and common to live with the parents as an adult.   So it's not because they are large infants."

Cautious drivers stop and look - because gravel trucks and gangsters won't stop and you can't win.  This becomes ingrained  - a mistrust of sorts  - even when the on-ramp provides a distance to pick up speed and merge.  Again it isn't logic but conditioning."

taiwan,34xetm,grozzle,6,Tue May 5 11:37:50 2015 UTC,"In general, I've noticed drivers here slow down a lot on any kind of incline. This happens on the main highways whenever you hit a slope... traffic drops from 120 to 90 because people are simply failing to compensate by pressing down on the gas, and almost no one has or uses cruise control (it's probably dangerous to do so given how erratically others drive here).   The other one that makes me mental is how everyone slows down 10-20 kmph as soon as they enter a tunnel. Xueshan to Yilan is a perfect example. Originally, they had posted 80KM limit all over the tunnel, but now the tunnel is lined with signs urging people to ""加速"" speed up!  Of course all the above is probably true of drivers in many countries to some degree so... meh, just go with the flow."
taiwan,34xetm,davidonformosa,4,Tue May 5 13:14:01 2015 UTC,The Yilan tunnel may be an anomaly. Most tunnels in Taiwan have significantly reduced speed limits. Maybe people are just used to slowing down whenever they enter a tunnel.

I did the Sears driving school and it was great. Taught me everything.  Companies should also teach Taiwanese how to ride a scooter/motorcycle. If I was a parent with an 18 year old kid, I would definitely want my child to take a course like this instead of teaching them in a parking lot.  I think if Taiwan had something like this it could greatly improve the driving here especially if it was modeled after other countries that mostly obey traffic laws.  Also, why don't they have driving permits here.  Before I could get my license I had to get a permit and drive with my parents for 6 months.  This also helped teach me how to drive with my parents telling me what to do."
taiwan,34xetm,Tyr808,3,Wed May 6 03:52:11 2015 UTC,"Many ramps specifically have a speed limit of 60 km/h, while the highways themselves usually have limits set at 90~110 km/h. During peak times, ramps sometimes activate its traffic lights to throttle the traffic joining the highway so it is dangerous (in terms of getting fined) to accelerate on the ramp. Many tunnels have a speed limit of 90 km/h."
taiwan,34xetm,Tyr808,0,Tue May 5 15:14:34 2015 UTC,"Do you mean a 60 km/h when turning? There are some ramps that connect to other highways that require a bank turn with a set speed limit. This is of course for safety because going above a certain speed will cause your car to over-steer and collide with the wall (trucks may even flip). However, you are allowed to speed up once the ramp goes straight connecting back to the highway.  Of course when approaching an on-ramp traffic light a driver should pay attention. These traffic lights always have a timer though so a good driver will know how to handle the situation. Even if a driver is stopped at a red light, it is still their responsibility to accelerate up to the highway speed limit as the remaining on-ramp after the traffic light is sufficient enough."

I'm not sure if it's considered the longest old street, though it is rather long. Its one if the most beautiful ones up north so you should definitely check it out.

Another poster mentioned all the obvious candidates; I like Dihua Street but wasn't impressed by Shenkeng (too clean and touristy). Sanxia might be worth a look and I'd also suggest Daxi Old Street (though I haven't personally been) or maybe Tamsui. If you don't mind going further afield I'd say the old streets of Lukang, Xiluo, and Xinhua are perhaps the best in Taiwan (that I've seen, anyway)."
taiwan,34tcpk,tedmisc,1 point,Mon May 4 13:30:32 2015 UTC,I generally agree with you but Tamsui's is pretty terrible. It has basically no old architecture left and is now just an ordinary commercial street that happens to be exceptionally narrow.

There's not much in the way of stores up there,  but there are a few small eateries, a wonderful tea shop open at odd hours, a Land God temple, and a few visitable houses that hold interesting items. If anyone is ever interested, I can give you more information.   The current Old Street was developed into a place for tourists, seeing the success of other such market areas.  A few years ago, there was a ""sit-in"" on the stairs because the Tamsui local government wanted to revamp the somewhat difficult and steep stair system and locales behind Fuyou Temple. I believe a decision was made to leave it alone, at least for now."

taiwan,34uj2i,Tyberos,5,Mon May 4 18:03:51 2015 UTC,"I'm sure your SO has already informed you, but both of you should be pretty vigilant in not being lovey-dovey. I was always aware of my hands and proximity to the missus when I first met her father, but she forgot for some reason, sat really close to me, and even placed her hand on my knee. As a result, she had quite a few talks with her fairly traditional parents (and this was at the age of 21~22).   I wouldn't worry too much, but just be extra careful about this kind of thing.   As /u/Tyberos said, be polite, honest, and sincere. This cannot be stressed enough. The missus has three sisters, all older, and even with my social faux pas, I am probably the most well-liked significant other (or was, since one sister got married and had a boy) because of my manners and sincerity."
taiwan,34uj2i,Get9,6,Tue May 5 01:29:15 2015 UTC,"Like what you said in Asia if you are divorced( doesnt matter wether you are a man or woman) its really a big deal. I have asian parents and they told me that it doesnt matter how many chicks I have, you can and only have 1 marriage. (they are more tradiitonal though)  So yeah first of all you need to solve that problem, even though not every parents are the same, but if they are the typical traditional parents they might not accept a man who is divorced. (Its not that I dislike people who are divorced, actually I dont give a bloody damn about it, maybe its because I am born and raised up in the west?)  But once you overcome that problem, help them with whatever you can. They are cleaning the house? Help them. They are cooking and you think you can help them a hand(with whatever, slicing tomatoes or something lol)? Do it. 9/10 times they will say 'Oh no you dont need to we can do it ourselves!' Trust me, thats some kind of asian style of saying 'Actually Im really happy that you can help me' .(e.g. I brought something from The Netherlands I want to give it to you and mostly their responses are: Oh my you dont need to! Thanks but thats not necessary! Gosh no you really dont have to give it to me! Even though they really like it lel) Dont be too fake when you help them though.  Like /tyberos said earlier: Be respectful, polite honese and sincere. And when you are eager to learn the language, I think they will accept you much easier."
taiwan,34uj2i,3xphate,3,Mon May 4 21:21:03 2015 UTC,"Now as others have mentioned, definitely learn some of the language. Definitely help out even when you are not asked and even though you think of yourself as a guest (to me this is a strange tradition). They may decline the help, but offer at least 3 times. ALWAYS address a person's name when first greeting them and acknowledge each person (this can be difficult when everyone gets excited and jumps into immediate conversations in larger groups). Try differ foods and keep a straight face even if it's gross in front of the family. When handing anything to someone older than you, use both hands as a form of respect (not one hand). Stuff like this your GF will have to teach you to help make a good first impression. Hopefully, others here will bring up some other possible gestures. First impression is very important!  From an American female prospective (everyone is different, so take it with a grain of salt): Before I even met my future inlaws (very traditional), they already hated me because I wasn't Asian. They made assumptions about me based on stereo types etc. Because I was American, divorce was more likely to happen (they actually have more divorces in their family than I do). Of course they were nice to me I front of my face, but afterwards they pulled me apart and said nasty things about me to my husband. It took many years for them to accept me and realize I wasn't going away. 15-16 years later my husband still has to defend my ass to his parents. So be prepared and try not to get upset if that happens.  Good luck, OP!  Edit: Be prepared to answer any really tough questions about the future even thought you haven't put a ring on her finger yet. You mention the dad thinks his daughter will move back to Taiwan, so I'm sure they'll be questions regarding this (or maybe not). Example: Are willing to move to Taiwan? It's better to prepare for any possible questions and not be caught off guard."

The KMT provides them almost free for PR purposes. So if you are a foreign journalist for a paper or anything decently well known, expect to be swamped by these advocates disguised as fixers. They are also responsible for ensuring that most papers covering Taiwan never get to interview anyone from the wide opposition, be it eco groups all the way to the Pan Greens. Most people don't realize that the USA's One China Policy is separate and distinct from China's One China Policy. Most people abroad get confused by the KMT's One China Policy, which again is separate and distinct from China's One China Policy and the USA's One China Policy. All these policies, except for China's, are ambiguous and hazy for diplomatic and political purposes. No state power wants to clarify that there are three One China policies because that would ruin things for their diplomats (or their people)."

Eventually, I just stopped asking them, so perhaps their policy has changed recently."

taiwan,34r39b,WuStalin,1 point,Tue May 5 02:26:56 2015 UTC,"Replying to my own post with updated information.  I visited FET this evening, and here's what they told me for current 3G prepaid customers who purchase by the gigabyte:   Yes, 4G is available for prepaid customers. To switch to 4G, you have pay $500, which includes 2GB of data and 2,000 minutes of calling, good for 6 months. After the initial $500 transaction, future transactions can be as low as $300 (i.e., as it is now with 3G service, the minimum transaction when adding value/價值 is $300). With 4G, you must now buy in allotments of 2GB for $500 total (with 3G, you could buy 1GB at a time). Per GB, this represents an increase of ~$62/GB over the cost of 3G ($188/GB). The data is good for 6 months.   Hopefully I heard everything correctly, the sales rep was talking a bit fast and in a low voice. Also, I forgot to ask what the unlimited monthly price (吃到飽) is for 4G, and/or how the upgrade process differs from what I described the above.  Lastly, if FET is overing prepaid 4G, then I'm sure all the other carriers are now too."

It is certainly more common there but plenty of people speak it in Taipei as well. I think it is useful to recognise contexts or groups where it is more commonly spoken in.

They will be able to provide almost all wedding-related things, and will be cheaper than a hotel.  However, the larger rooms will be fully booked on the weekends for at least a year (at least in Taipei), so it will have to depend on your date and number of tables.  It would be easier to find a venue for weekday dinner or weekend lunch.  Congratulations!"
taiwan,34le3o,acheng312,3,Sat May 2 06:28:00 2015 UTC,Thank you!! I visited today and your suggestion was excellent. The roof top ceremony spot is pretty amazing and the location could not be better.

taiwan,34le3o,poorman99,2,Sun May 3 13:05:55 2015 UTC,"It really depends on where your fiance's family is coming from... let's hope he is not coming from Tainan... lol  There are many steps in a ""Taiwanese style"" wedding. Typically most guests just attend the wedding ""banquet"". There's another tea ceremony or traditional ceremony before that, which only involves family members or closed friends. You should know  your in-laws' plan about that. That part is tricky as the list of ""traditions"" could run really long...   Now, the venue is easier if you know which one you want but it's very common that good ones are booked for ""good days"" at least 6 months in advance. Most decent hotels could host the wedding, and in my opinion there are pretty much the same. They usually just provide the food & basic equipments (lighting, mics, projectors). Guests tend to rate a wedding based on food, not what happened at the wedding :p"

Just depends on your budget."

The swastika is a traditional European symbol and had been used by Germanic peoples for 1000s of years. More correctly, the swastika could be called a universal or primordial human symbol. No other symbol is more widely spread. From Ireland to Japan the symbol has been in use for longer than history has been recorded. It's a real shame Hitler had to go ruin the symbol  in the west (and the Roman salute) by picking them. If it hadn't been for the Nazis the swastika would be a prime candidate to be on a flag of the planet Earth."

That's why we in Asia can glorify someone like Hitler. Those Westerners should stop enforcing their ideals on us in Asia.

Also, don't forget, technically Taiwan is on the Axis side :D."
taiwan,34lxab,rhascal,3,Sat May 2 13:09:47 2015 UTC,Yes... The allies were a lot better than the axis. Maybe not the Soviet.
taiwan,34lxab,Roygbiv0415,6,Sat May 2 13:15:38 2015 UTC,"Both sides killed a lot of people, civilians and soldiers alike, but the scale of the attempted genocides and human experiments tip the scales in favor of the allied forces IMO.  One thing I'm curious about is representations of Imperial Japan in Taiwanese culture. There doesn't seem to be much of a taboo about this, if any at all."
taiwan,34lxab,rhascal,4,Sat May 2 13:21:27 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I rarely see any representation of Imperial Japan, if at all. The KMT regime did a very good job systematically removing all traces of Imperial Japanese rule from Taiwan, and is still very active in doing so. Case in point: the recent debate on whether to call the 50 years of Imperial Japan rule ""Japanese governed era (日治時期)"" or ""Japanese occupied era (日據時期)"". I have very high doubt that normal Taiwanese people seeing the Rising Sun Flag actually know what it means or symbolizes.  I think KMT have made the concept of Imperial Japan so foreign and distant, that young people these days have no idea what the era is like, and could not form an opinion based on that history. Therefore Taiwan appears to judge Japan only as the country as it is now, rather than the one in the past. Which, IMO, is a really good thing -- People really ought not to live in the hatred passed on by forefathers."

taiwan,34lh3e,Kjostid,3,Sat May 2 05:14:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, but I'll throw in my two cents:  1) Airports in Asia are much smoother than in the USA, as there is no TSA nonsense. Security is much faster and much less stressful. This certainly applies to Taiwan, perhaps even more so.   2) I honestly wouldn't worry about getting to HK late, personally. It's a pretty safe city, and it's a 24 hr city for the most part. So long as you can check into your hostel late, I wouldnt worry about the rest.  3) Not quite sure if I understand your question, but are you asking if you can arrive at the airport at 18:30 for a 19:00 flight? If so, no. If the flight is at 19:00, boarding probably starts at 18:15 or so and will end at 18:40 or so. You'd effectively have 10 minutes to check in, go through security, and get to your gate.   I'd suggest getting there at 17:30 at the latest for a 19:00 flight. Yeah, you might show up at your gate early, but it's just not worth risking a missed flight.  EDIT: Just read that you aren't checking bags, but that won't make it any faster. Still have to follow the same check-in and security process.  EDIT 2: Potential issue with arriving at HK after midnight: public transportation will probably be closed (I can't remember the exact hours for HK metro and the like, but give it a google). You could definitely get a cab from the airport at midnight, though."
taiwan,34lh3e,LovableContrarian,3,Sat May 2 07:13:52 2015 UTC,"I would get to the airport no later than 17:30 as well.  If they let you leave the tour, you could just hop on the MRT at Yingge and go see Taipei. All of the spots on their 2nd tour are near MRT stations"

Even without checked bag, I think 6pm is the latest you could get, assuming you have checked-in online and know how to use their cute hello kitty kiosk (which don't always work) to get your boarding pass (you can't print it at home). There are security check, immigration counter as well as the identify check at the gate. I ran through all these once at 11pm but I don't think at rush hour it's possible.  It would be better to book the later flight and enjoy a good dinner either in the city or at the airport before heading to Hong Kong."

taiwan,34hqxc,kzilla88,8,Fri May 1 06:46:31 2015 UTC,"It's a good idea on paper, but as with many Taiwanese laws, it will be enforced for a month and then totally forgotten, like the backseat seatbelt law or idling cars or illegal construction times (large trucks should not operate within Taipei during the day, but the fine is less than the overtime pay... if they get caught)  Policemen in Taiwan do the minimum amount of work to avoid any problems on themselves.  When they are out to do one thing, they ignore almost everything else.  For example, when they are patrolling (going to places like banks to sign a patrol card), they don't bother with traffic violations, like illegal parking in front of the banks they are patrolling.  I was told it is because they have a schedule they have to keep, and will be required to write reports if they deviate from their assigned duty, so they choose to ignore minor things.  Taiwanese people (especially the older generation) are also confrontational.  If a cop tries to fine someone for throwing a cigarette butt into the drain, they'll probably make a big scene, demand the policeman provide evidence, and probably call a congressman to complain.

I also missed the other thing you're supposed to do: eat at the temple on the old street. Just bad luck on that trip.  Jiaoxi in Yilan is pretty good (I've been three times now) and you shouldn't have any trouble finding a half-decent place for under 1,000 NT a night (I've had much less). The nightly activities in town are, shall we say, neither extensive nor family-friendly. The big night market in Yilan is a ways south of Jiaoxi in Luodong so you wouldn't be making a quick trip of it. Jiaoxi has a few other things to recommend, however: several nice waterfalls, for starters. And if you'd like to mix things up a bit I'd recommend taking the train around to Fulong the next day, grab a lunch box, rent a bike, and ride through Old Caoling Tunnel and around the eastern tip of the island."

taiwan,34dt1k,x3nomik,2,Thu Apr 30 20:19:23 2015 UTC,"The 1,000 NT and under hotels in Jiaoxi might not advertise online. Both had hot springs piped into a bathtub in the room as well as a ""spa"" downstairs. You just have to wander in, inquire about price, and ask to have a look. Takes a bit of time but you can find some pretty decent places that way.  Neither place has too much of a view at night (though Jinshan might if you get a place right next to the coast; I really don't have too much experience there). If the night market is a draw you can probably take a shuttle bus from Jiaoxi to Luodong and back... or a taxi. I can't imagine it costing too much; it's probably a common thing to do. Just keep in mind Luodong closes down a little early (around 10ish on a weekday night) since it's mostly a tourist night market (and the tourists go back to Taipei or wherever)."

taiwan,34abm7,x3nomik,16,Wed Apr 29 15:41:03 2015 UTC,"私娼寮 literally means private prostitution hut, or private brothel. The 私娼 (private prostitute) is in comparison to 公娼, which are government sanctioned prostitutes. While prostitution was criminalized in Taiwan in 1991, it continued on under government operated brothels in Taipei until then mayor and future president, Chen Shui-Bian, stopped them in 1997. So 私娼寮 essentially means illegal brothels (since all privately operated brothels are illegal)."

taiwan,34abm7,Get9,2,Wed Apr 29 19:56:57 2015 UTC,"In regards to abandoned gods:  Sometimes, they can't be removed. Certain gods require certain ceremonies, and if it is determined that their best place is where they currently are, they stay.  I'm sure some are forgotten, however.  Anyway, there are two abandoned buildings in New Taipei City I've seen with remaining gods: one in a supplier's building in Tamsui and the other in a ceramics factory in Sanjhih. In both cases, the god was 土地公 (Land God). This makes sense, since he seems to be the hardest god to move.   The god in your picture could be Land God; he shares a lot of similarities (although, many gods do, too :P)."
taiwan,34abm7,Get9,2,Thu Apr 30 01:45:29 2015 UTC,This is also super informative. I didn't know some gods can't be moved can be difficult to move... but wouldn't someone always come by to light some incense now and then? That's the impression I got from this half-abandoned temple in Changhua.
taiwan,34abm7,True_Story_,3,Thu Apr 30 19:28:58 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine that it's just up to circumstance. In the case of the ceramics factory, and this is hearsay from the farmer who has been next door for decades, the owner closed up shop and moved away. The Land God statue in this location was behind a door, which was behind another door, which was up some stairs. I guess nobody locally knows about it (they seem to only use the bottom for keeping things like seed and buckets).  In the case of the supplier, the statue was actually at the top floor of the building, which itself had the entrances boarded up. So, I assume that the previous owner moved on and didn't want to go through the trouble.  I'm not sure about the abandoned entertainment complex, but I think it's safe to say that it's because of the location.   The link that you just posted is a temple that's fairly out in the open. It's a bit run-down, yeah, but it's not difficult to get to. I'd also say that it seems neglected, but when you consider that the important part is the god housing and the incense burners, it's not. The rest is just disused, and given the obvious difference in property value that Taiwanese hold, I don't find it that odd.  As to your other point, it's not that they can't be moved, but they can be difficult to move. Some people aren't strict about this and just move a statue wherever, but some need it to be the correct date and it must be in the ""correct way"" to a ""suitable"" place.  Edit 1: I found out about moving statues when I wanted to purchase my own proper Land God statue. The local shop I went to started talking to me about this stuff, and that's when I decided that I wasn't getting one at that moment, hah.  Edit 2: Just thought of another abandoned statue, but this time it was 灶君 (Stove/Kitchen God). It was located at the abandoned shops at 十八王宮, up in Shihmen, in what used to be a restaurant. Workers tore down all those shops, though, and I'm curious as to what would have happened to him. There was one man left up there that ran a ""hit the balloons with darts"" stand. I never asked who lit essence for Stove God, but someone obviously was. I mention all of this because the location, though extremely run down, wasn't hard to get to."

taiwan,348ri2,Roygbiv0415,2,Wed Apr 29 05:43:40 2015 UTC,"Ko has made revamping the bus system a priority (it was one of the first concrete policy statements he made in his run) but I'm not optimistic about it. Taipei's bus system has 15 private companies running buses, which are kind of competing and also kind of in collusion with each other. Trying to get all 15 to agree on anything is going to be like herding cats. There's a reason why Taipei was never able to offer free or even discounted transfers for buses--the government and the companies couldn't agree on who was going to be on the hook for the lost revenue.  That's not even considering the riders, many of whom are going to be pissed about losing their one-seat commutes.  I feel like currently the Taipei bus system is a huge lumbering mess that nonetheless works kind of well for everybody. An overhaul is going to make a lot of people very unhappy for a pretty long time--which I suppose Ko could afford, but we'll see."

But Taipei City spun off its own bus operations in the early 2000s (forming Metropolitan Bus Company) and I doubt it's interested in becoming a bus operator again--and I can't imagine what an expensive headache it would be to absorb all those companies, many of which date back to the Japanese period and are older than the government of Taipei City itself."

taiwan,348hjj,laopi,2,Wed Apr 29 03:17:18 2015 UTC,"So, some numbers. 1st Nuclear Plant has a capacity of 1208MW, 2nd Plant has 1896MW, and 3rd plant has 1780MW. The 4th plant under constuction has a rated capacity of 2700MW, not quite enough to replace Nuclear plants 1 and 2 outright. But if the 4th plant is to be put into service, I believe that should be done.  Now, to put things into perspective, Taichung power plant I mentioned a couple of days ago has a capacity of 5832MW (and gives off carbon dioxide emission on par with the whole of Switzerland), but it's far from the only major non-renewable plant in Taiwan. Hsinta Power Plant in Kaohsiung produces 4326MW and Mailiao Power Plant in Yunlin produces 4200MW, both coal-fired plants. Tatan power plant in Taoyuan produces 4384MW, and is gas powered.   We could, in theory, turn to coal power today, build another Taichung power plant, and decommission all the nuclear plants. But yes, that's another Switzerland in emissions.

Don't get me wrong, I'm an advocate for nuclear energy, but firing that old boy up just sounds like a bad idea."
taiwan,348hjj,Marckoz,2,Thu Apr 30 14:48:47 2015 UTC,"We should also keep in mind that the designers of Plant 4, including GE has pulled out because of safety and liability concerns. The Taiwan government also admits that significant safety measures were cut from Plant 4 in a bid to save money.  Do we really want to turn on Plant 4? I'm not against nuclear power, I'm just against  unsafe construction and online an already outdated design. If Plant 4 goes online and causes problems, it'll again hurt the entire industry, not just in Taiwan. If something catastrophic happens, we merely have to evacuate Taipei. Hrm. I guess it's not so bad after all."

The government had Plant 4 as the perfect opportunity to quell this fear, but they messed up Plant 4 with an old uncertified design, with faulty construction (reactor base cracking, wtf), with questionable safety inspections (safety committee resigning, wtf), with no established program to dispose of the wastes.  If only Plant 4 was executed properly, people would have had confidence in the government's ability to maintain a safe nuclear program. But Plant 4 is so full of problems it actually fuels the fear.

I understand that raising electricity prices would be unpopular, but so would be having Beijing-pollution level, or watching a nuclear reactor blow up.  In my opinion, better price incentives for energy efficiency on the demand side, investment in storage and offshore wind are the only real hope for Taiwan's energy crisis.

taiwan,348hjj,mvrofiq,6,Wed Apr 29 04:47:17 2015 UTC,"Even though at some point in history, the main goal for the 4th nuclear power plant was to replace the first two, it's now clear it will never be possible because of the amount of energy consumed in Taiwan (to maintain every single building of the island at a refrigerator-like temperature, for instance).  As for the ""fabled promised technology"", France, one of the biggest nuclear power plant maker and user (19 nuclear power plants totalling 58 nuclear reactors on the French territory so far), recently released a report that shows 100% of the energy consumed in France could be made out of renewable energy by 2050, mostly using wind and solar energy."

taiwan,348hjj,rousimarpalhares_,2,Wed Apr 29 06:47:13 2015 UTC,"I think it's rather more urgent for Taiwan to switch to renewable energy. It is clear that in the long term Nuclear isn't a solution, not only because of safety concerns (Earthquakes and tsunamis are inevitable), but also a lack of both nuclear fuel and nuclear waste disposal options. But at the same time, neither is fossil fuel a viable option, not only because of the crazy carbon emissions, but also because the fuels must be imported.   Unfortunately, Taiwan is too small and rainy for solar, hyrdo seems to be fully developed (at least new developments looks highly unlikely), and while wind has great potential, is stuck in limbo. Of all the current options, Nuclear does seem like the only good compromise, at least until the government can finally get their shit together, and figure out a viable future plan."

taiwan,348hjj,ShrimpCrackers,2,Thu Apr 30 04:54:37 2015 UTC,"I hate it when people say Plant 4 is a  crisis. No, the real crisis is that the government is not doing anything to improve the power situation in Taiwan. Whether we turn plant 4 on or not, it doesn't change the fact that Taiwan can afford neither carbon-based, nor nuclear power.   For me all Plant 4 means is that we have a choice between a new (and potentially unsafe) plant, and two old (and definitely unsafe) plants. It doesn't automagically solve all the power problems in Taiwan, as only 16% of Taiwan's power is reliant on nuclear. I'd gladly ditch nuclear any day if a clear alternative can make up for that 16%, either through renewables or power saving measures, are implemented."

taiwan,343kef,lalamountain,2,Tue Apr 28 05:08:43 2015 UTC,My guess is that it's because you don't want to close the roads and make some business lose a contract worth millions because its truck or messenger or rep couldn't get somewhere.

taiwan,343kef,DerpyDogs,3,Tue Apr 28 02:17:39 2015 UTC,"The drills will include actual training drill for multiple branches of public service including the fire brigades, police, EMT, etc. but only for a few selected units. All the info should be announced beforehand. But I'm not sure where...  There will not be military flybys, as these drills are for the public services branches, not for the military. There may be some involvement, but those won't involve combat units. Only logistics and engineering units that participate in support scenarios.  The armed forces have their own drill that involve randomly selected scenarios to which the drilling units must respond. For example a radar station may get a commando assault scenario; an air defense unit may get an incoming missile scenario. But all these are classified. When I was serving in an air defense unit, we knew in advance when the drill will take place (all passes will be revoked as it's treated as war-time), but we may not tell anyone about it, not even our family (although most of the male population would know exactly the reason). Nobody would know who gets selected for drilling. We just had to stay put in combat-ready status and wait to see if the inspectors roll in through the gates."

Infrastructure is a little bit older.  Some good hiking spots.   Green Island (keep in mind we went in December) was practically empty. We had the entire island to explore to ourselves. At the natural salt hotsprings, there were probably only 3 or 4 other people there. We booked snorkeling off the coast in the reef with a local tour guide, and once he realized we've done this before (We lived in San Diego) he left us to do our own thing with zero people around, even at the beach.

If I were in their position, I'd do the same thing, as that's the rational choice. Would I rather get help from China, a neighboring country with a gigantic budget, or from Taiwan, who is obviously a well wisher, but still is further away and doesn't have the same kind of purse?   The bad guy here is the Chinese government who would put their political agenda ahead of humanitarian aid. They're the ones presenting a false and terrible choice in front of the government of Nepal.  FYI, you guys should know Nepalis like Taiwan and love stuff made there.

Yes, people on the ground are in desperate need of help, but alas this is politics; long after people are thankful for your help, China will still remember.

There is also the Taiwanese tendency to neglect property maintenance to consider. Most of the units in the Wanli UFO village and Harbour City were bought and occupied at some point... but things fall apart. Even in the city many buildings seem to have a lifespan of about 30 years before being knocked down so something newer can be built. Along the northern coast it's cheaper to build elsewhere rather than demolish something that is already there. That's my general understanding of what's going on anyway. (And if you expand the discussion to include the Keelung to Magang stretch we'd also have to talk about the mining and fishing industries... but I digress.)"

Public transport can only reliably get you to Tamshui, and bus service from there on is spotty at best. Private motoring is much worse -- The western route to Tamshui is notoriously congested, while the eastern route to Keelung is a whole lotta extra mileage.

If you and your pet comes from a quarantine zone(country) then we have to lock your pet up for almost a month to see if she or he have any thing in her or him. If she's from a safe zone. Then no problem at all.

The only reason I decided to stay in United States with my dog was because I didn't think my dog would make it through the long travel from US to Taiwan, especially after I read tons of Air Travel Consumer Report for Redacted Animal Incident Reports (animals get injured even on domestic travel...so I don't want to risk my dog's life)"

I guess for some calm happy big dog, travel may not be too bad!  By fly here, you meant from Taiwan to United States? If so, I'd think the flight process is the same...the good thing is the pets won't have to go though quarantine :)"
taiwan,33zksg,thethrowawaymua,3,Mon Apr 27 14:45:02 2015 UTC,"I am currently in the process of bringing 2 cats over from the US. They are not yet here, so please bear that in mind.  First and foremost, if your friend is coming from a rabies-infected country (like the US) then the pet not only needs to get its rabies shot but needs a FAVN test proving that the rabies vaccine worked. The FAVN test results have to be a minimum of 180days old before importation can be considered.  Next, after the 180days is up, your friend can apply for an import permit for the animal. https://pet-epermit.baphiq.gov.tw/  Once you get the permit, you can then proceed to arranging a spot in a quarantine facility and bring the animal over.  *Though airlines sometimes don't check, your friend should have a copy of the animal's health reports from a vet within 10 days of flying.  Also, your friend needs to make sure that the pet is microchipped with an international standard chip. http://www.pettravel.com/0001225.cfm  Quarantine is stated to be 21 days. I have read some people getting their animals a couple days before 21 days, but it's safest to bet on the full stay. I have also read that visitations are limited. As this is hearsay to me, I cannot vouch for its validity. I read that visitations can be as limited as 1-2 times a week for 30minute sessions.  If your friend has a small dog then they may luck out in terms of flight accommodations. I say this because some airlines allow small pets to be brought into the cabin as a carry on item, this will save the worry about the animal being in the luggage hold.  Source: Have flown on airplanes with the cats at our feet (one animal per person, my husband had one and I had the other)  Many airlines won't allow pets that have to be in the hold to fly during summer because of the risk of the animal dying from the heat. I would suggest avoiding the extreme weather seasons (summer and winter) and opting for the mild weathered ones (spring and fall)  As /u/jjtlp linked, this file will have the process outlined."

Both had been usable interchangeably outside of metro systems (local buses and TRA trains, for example) for years, but due to insistence on TRTC's part (proxy of Taipei City Government), Taipei Metro will not allow the use of iPass cards in the system unless EasyCard is allowed in the Kaohsiung Metro system.

They asked you if you've tried it! ""Yes, I have! It's delicious!"" would be a great answer. Then they'll ask you if you'd like some and you can say you're not hungry. After that they can't ask if you don't like it because you've already stated you think it tastes great!   Idk... sorry, I don't mean to offend. I know you were probably just giving out an example but I felt bad for your wife's family... lol."
taiwan,33p2cn,Jabarumba,3,Fri Apr 24 14:07:54 2015 UTC,"No worries. No offence. It was just a quick example for a more complicated situation. It was meant to show that no matter how long I've been here, the assumption is that I haven't tried any Taiwanese food. Expectations for foreigners are at rock bottom. I still get people surprised that I can use chopsticks. As for OP's question, it was an example of how underestimating foreigners usually just frustrates the foreigner and makes the Taiwanese seem naive about how willing or unwilling foreigners in Taiwan are about trying new things. I get the impression that people here sometimes forget that most travelers crossed and ocean or a continent to get here and we're pretty open to trying new things. Then again, most Taiwanese have never left the island (or have just been to Hong Kong) and don't have a reference point."

Oyster pancakes, pig blood cake, and the rest are alright, but they're not my favorites and I wouldn't recommend them to Western friends who didn't explicitly say they wanted something relatively ""unusual"".

James Kitchen on YongKang, 秀蘭小館 also near yongkang, as far as 牛肉麵 goes, on the pricier end 天下三絶  near zhongxiao fuxing,  牛店 near ximen.   there is also the numerous japanese restaurants, izakaya, ramen, and sushi.

taiwan,33ooit,wkwrd,3,Fri Apr 24 06:22:43 2015 UTC,"Down here in Changhua I have random conversations with people maybe once a week (due to my lousy Chinese and the general timidity of local people). Today, remarkably, I had two interactions:  1) I'm sipping coffee and mowing down a breakfast hanbao when a Taiwanese guy walks up and stutters ""where are you from?"" Reflexively I answer and, seemingly satisfied, he turns tail and zips around the corner. How's that for conversation? That narrowly beats yesterday's sole interaction when a woman heard me sniffling in a cafe (I'm nursing a cold) and came over to drop some tissue next to me before high-tailing it outta there. Hey, slow down already! I'm not going to bite.  2) I go to the bank to change some Hong Kong dollars from my last visa run and everyone fumbles over themselves trying to help me out. Some days I just wanna say ""relax everyone, I've done this before"" but at times I know it's best to just let people do their thing so I don't create any more confusion or disarray. Anyhow, someone from another counter wanders by, ostensibly because she can speak a little more English than her co-workers, and we end up chatting while my forms are processed and such. As usual I am met with bewilderment when I explain that I don't teach English and, in fact, moved to Changhua by choice just to try it out. Handed out a business card in the hope that people at the bank will go check out my blog. I figure it must be kinda amusing for someone living here to find some random foreigner writing about trivial historic details of their hometown."
taiwan,33ooit,x3nomik,5,Fri Apr 24 07:02:17 2015 UTC,"someone from another counter wanders by, ostensibly because she can speak a little more English than her co-workers   It's funny how sometimes you enter a bank or a shop, and you can see the clerk starting freaking out because (s)he thinks (s)he's gonna have to talk English and starts running behind another coworker who, supposedly, knows more English... until you start talking Chinese and the first clerk realizes (s)he freaked out for nothing :)   Handed out a business card in the hope that people at the bank will go check out my blog.

Thankfully the usual situation is for people to be super cool and patient about everything."

Sometimes, it just seems like clerks' brains won't let them believe that a foreigner is speaking their languages to them. It doesn't happen everywhere, but, man, when it happens, it's frustrating to me.   Either that or some of them really want to practice English.  My favorite moment was in last July, when I went to a little store in Sanjhih (三芝). I walked in and the a-ma manning the store just started speaking Taiwanese to me, and wasn't taken aback by my replies. This was my very first time to experience this and is now known as my best conversation ever."

The girl who wrote it is a Tibetan ""Free Tibet"" activist, so that obviously wasn't her intention, but she gave many examples of how the people had been conditioned to unquestioningly accept the authority of their religious leaders, even if it meant dying in a refugee camp in India because some lama wanted bribe money before he'd say ""the Buddha smiles upon your marrying a Swiss citizen and emigrating to a safe, clean, and economically sound country instead of being used as forced labor until you drop from exhaustion, just like your husband died."""

For example, a small business at the entrance of town would be in charge of dealing with foreign clients, taking orders of teddy bears and arranging shipments. Next door would be a small business specializing in the design of teddy bears, and next to that, a few supplier of artificial fur. There might be a couple of button, eyes and nose part manufacturers, and yet another one imports cotton for the stuffing. At the end of the town will be a factory or two for assembly.   The whole town acts as if it's one company, though the different segments are interconnected through Chinese ethics and competition. Each SME is able to streamline it's own operations easily due to its small size, and competition between suppliers of similar products ensure innovation and lower costs. But in the end what's important is that this mess of SMEs actually still deliver the end product in time -- which is what's really amazing about Taiwan's SME economy, and something pretty difficult to copy outside of Taiwan."

India is too big to respect minority groups Taiwanese-style or else you'd have MRT announcements being repeated in 300 Indian languages. Launch Hong Kong-style anti-corruption campaigns.  Of course, I don't think any of what I just said is possible in India. It will remain a overcrowded, corrupt clusterfuck for decades to come. But it will be a culturally vibrant clusterfuck at least.

US could have a choice between seeing China as a friend, or seeing it as an enemy, but either way, US supremacy must be assured. That's really quite obvious.  Nothing else in the article really matters. The points listed afterwards are just what the US policy makers believe will ensure US supremacy, and the conlusion:   “Unlike other emergent countries, China wants to be China and accepted as such, not as an honorary member of the West. The Chinese will want to share this century as co-equals with the United States.”    Is exactly why US is doing what it did. China is clearly showing that it would not acknowledge the US as superior, so what's wrong with the US trying to contain it? I guess it's the old idea that economical power is not a zero sum game, and two countries can in fact benefit and grow more from cooperation and not competition.

The US can get away with just about anything they do, and they would likely wish to keep it that way. China is working hard to ensure they can get away with anything they do, while they might not be there yet, they're getting close.

It has been rapidly developing and will likely become the largest economy sometime within the next 50 years. Other developing countries will further shrink the relative power of the US.

I'm not suggesting that you can't or shouldn't ""fear"", but rather ""fear"" is not a rational reason for policies.  If ""Fear"" is all you can offer as US's policy rationale, then I think you pretty much admitted to the limited amount of thought put into something so important."

There are a lot of ex-pats who come to Taiwan to party, 把妹 (look it up),  etc. Those ex-pats are easy to find (i.e., just go to a bar/club and you will find them). But there are plenty of ex-pats like yourself who are not into those things, but they might be a bit more difficult to find.

taiwan,33madn,EastCoastAversion,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:58:01 2015 UTC,"It really depends on where. If your debit card can be used as a credit card, it can be used at some locations. So, if you'd rather use it, just ask; if they say no, just use cash.  A useful phrase: 我可不可以用信用卡？(Wǒ kě bù kěyǐ yòng xìnyòngkǎ? / Can I use my credit card or not?)  For example, if you were shopping in a department store in Taipei City, like SOGO or somewhere near Taipei Train Station or many other locations, they'd probably be fine with a credit card. Likewise, many more expensive restaurants [read: not street vendors or McDonald's-type places] will accept them.   It's better to have cash on you in case a place doesn't accept credit cards, but I've purchased computer parts, meals, clothing, and numerous other items using my card.  Be warned, though, that if a place accepts a card, the price of whatever you're buying may increase. When I bought my [brand new] scooter, I could've used a card, but that would've added a few thousand NT onto the price. As such, I paid in cash. Places like the clothing store NET and eateries like Outback Steakhouse, TGI Fridays, etc., don't seem to add a fee (though the latter may add a service charge as tip)."

I also once ate this veggie that resembled some sort of vine plant, with tendrils and a hairy stem. That tasted really odd..  streets - i find the streets in Singapore more organized and cleaner.

When I order 清粥 here,  I ask for a dish of salt because it's too bland. (And yes, when eating 清粥 you typically eat it with other dishes that lend flavor and/or salt to the 粥 (e.g.,  獅子頭), but sometimes it's still not enough flavoring (at least for me)).   Singapore dishes use a lot more spices/herbs.   Agreed, Singapore and many other Asian regions/cultures utilize a greater variety of  spices/herbs that here in Taiwan.   P.S.

Point A primarily relies on the project being long overdue, and have been given many extensions by the previous government. If the current government refuses to extend any further, Farglory could be in breach of contract.   Point B is what this is about: if the Taipei government halts Farglory for fire safety issues, it will of course have to be fixed, and either the Mall or the Stadium will have to be demolished.

Concrete box likely built by a company with questionable morals in a city that looks like a gulag.
taiwan,33kutl,mprey,3,Thu Apr 23 12:44:38 2015 UTC,"It's not just the shit quality of apartments here;  what's ridiculous is how many people buy them as ""investments"" because the price has gone up so it will keep going up.  It's the same logic that is destroying the economy in the U.S. -- the Federal Reserve couldn't stand to see overpriced housing (and, consequently, stocks) correct back to a rational market price, so they printed and pumped a few trillion USD into the economy.  If the government here tries that, without the ""world reserve currency"" status of the USD, the economic distortion will be much worse.  People here seem to think that they can't lose.  A friend owns a US$400,000 apartment that he rents out for US$450/month.  It doesn't come close to paying the mortgage, but the price gain supposedly will make up for it, if he ever sells it (and can find a bigger fool to buy it off him for the new, inflated price).  He can't rent it out for any more than that because the market won't support a higher rent.  I think most of the runup has been based on people's belief that relations with mainland China will open up and all the rich mainlanders will pay a million USD for a concrete box in Yonghe.  What I think they're missing is that some wealthy mainland schmuck can just as easily buy million dollar acreage in the U.S., or for that matter in France, Sweden, or wherever, in a scenic, peaceful, unpolluted area."
taiwan,33kutl,richardtheassassin,2,Thu Apr 23 19:40:10 2015 UTC,"A friend owns a US$400,000 apartment that he rents out for US$450/month. It doesn't come close to paying the mortgage   Exactly this. Typically a sliding scale, based on the market value of the property, is used to set the rent. (As the value of the property increases, the portion of that value you can charge in rent usually diminishes). For example, for a home worth $450,000, in many markets you might charge ~.075% in rent ($3,000). So, the $450/month your friend is charging (~$13,500NTD) for a $400,000USD ($12,000,000NTD) flat strikes me as a risky proposition (unless, as you noted, you can unload the property on someone else for profit - entirely possible when the market is in a bubble).  As others noted in this thread, $MEGA-WEALTHY-MAINLANDER can plow their money in more stable markets elsewhere in the world (or at least those that have already had their bubbles burst. See also: The United States circa 2008), and have a much nicer property, rather than the reinforced concrete boxes here in Taiwan."
taiwan,33kutl,vigernere1,3,Thu Apr 23 20:18:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in the U.S., from what I understand, a house is worth buying if you can charge about 1% of its price as rent, or 100:1.  The 2008 bubble imploded at around 160:1.  Here the valuation is more like 900:1, probably worse in the downtown area.  It's insane."

taiwan,33kutl,claimui,1 point,Fri Apr 24 05:22:07 2015 UTC,"Taiwan: not one single Michelin-starred restaurant.   A major reason is that Michelin simply doesn't review Taiwan, at least not for the ""red guide"" that gives out stars.  You can speculate whether or not Taiwan would get any stars if Michelin were to make a review, but until they actually do, it's just a guess.  It's worth noting that Din Tai Fung got one Michelin star in Hong Kong, where Michelin does review. (Maybe this is just a pity star for Taiwan, since they definitely don't give stars to DTF in, say, Tokyo or LA.)  L'atelier de Joel Robuchon also typically gets one or two stars in its other branches around the world.  So there's that."

taiwan,33j3n3,rhascal,20,Wed Apr 22 22:45:24 2015 UTC,"Average salaries of 20k and average childcare costs of 10k.  Just realised I'm oversimplifying the issue.  Money/society side:  High house prices, long working hours, lots of pressure to pump/supplement/buy stupidly expensive vitamins and books and shit to 'be a good mother'.    Pressure to abort babies conceived 'too early' or 'not at the right time' (I can think of five people in stable relationships who aborted surprise pregnancies due to familial pressure). The cost of doing zuoyuezi and the pressure to do so.  The lack of government promotion of the role of fathers, resulting in mothers being responsible for most of the childcare and fathers who take on the duties of looking after the kid or who help out at home being laughed at (hell, even Japan has the ikumen project).  Perceived cost of education..  (Before we had a baby everyone was telling us the baby would cost 25,000 a month.  The fuck?  What the fuck is everyone doing with their kids, plating them in solid gold?)  Biological side: Average marrying age of 35, large percentage of people who have had abortions due to poor sex ed.   There's a lot that goes into it.  Generally it's a very Taiwanese mix of the government being fucking useless and everybody trying to make live much harder for themselves than it needs to be."
taiwan,33j3n3,himit,2,Thu Apr 23 01:35:21 2015 UTC,Holy crap those childcare costs.
taiwan,33j3n3,girlintaiwan,4,Thu Apr 23 01:39:58 2015 UTC,10K is very low compared with what I've seen.
taiwan,33j3n3,himit,3,Thu Apr 23 02:10:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and those are the crap places.  The decent ones that I looked into were all 20k a month, and only took babies from the age of 2+.  For the first 2 years you're either lucky enough to have family who can help or find a place in a government baby daycare (only eligible if your hukou is in the area that you live, so that's a huge chunk of the norther population ruled out right there), or you need to find a place in one of the very, very few private daycares that specialize in babies, or find a nanny.  Some kindergartens will have a 'baby area' but they're not particularly... great.  I've heard that the kids spend most of the day strapped to their high chair in case they hurt themselves."
taiwan,33j3n3,locdogjr,2,Thu Apr 23 01:49:21 2015 UTC,"Oh goodness, every Taiwanese woman thinks she HAS to go to the ""mommy center"" or whatever it is for 45 days.Those places are like 150,000 on the cheap end or something, it is a ridiculous cost and if you don't do it you are considered low class or looked down on socially."
taiwan,33j3n3,himit,4,Thu Apr 23 03:20:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and they all compare how much pumped milk they have in the freezer, too.  A big chunk of Taiwanese culture seems to be making life as difficult as possible for yourself."
taiwan,33j3n3,locdogjr,4,Thu Apr 23 03:39:09 2015 UTC,"Never heard about comparing pumped milk!  I just see people pay so much money for weddings, apartments, and then baby centers and brand name things and wonder how people all say they make 24K a month... it simply doesn't add up unless your parents are paying for everything or conversely you save until you are 35 to get married or you have massive loans.   By the time you spend at least a million on a wedding it would take another 5 years just to save for one baby....."
taiwan,33j3n3,himit,3,Thu Apr 23 03:43:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, one of my local friends got caught up in it and surprise surprise, the stress was negatively affecting her milk supply.  Taiwanese women think it's really common not to have enough milk, really it's a combination of stress + being separated from the baby during the night during zuo yue zi.  Me and hubby are pretty hard up lately and we're on way more than 25k.  We have no idea how people do it, it's either debt or borrowing from parents."
taiwan,33j3n3,locdogjr,3,Thu Apr 23 03:49:26 2015 UTC,"Zuo yue zi is the mommy center correct? I just don't understand it. My wife claims it is why Taiwanese women look better after pregnancy and why they don't age, I personally thinl that is because Taiwanese women don't eat horrible during pregnancy with bad foods or have the idea of eating for two.   In my experiences that mommy center seems non-negotiable though! Such a racket and so expensive, I'd love to lnow the history of it and how long it has been around. I'm willing to bet most of the 50+ crowd never had that experience but I really dunno"
taiwan,33j3n3,himit,4,Thu Apr 23 04:07:59 2015 UTC,"There's decent history behind it!  In the west we actually had a period of lying in that was 50 or 60 days up until the 50s, where the woman wasn't supposed to get up from the bed. It's common across a lot of cultures.  I think it's important for the woman to rest after birth, and a month seems to be about right (though you really need 6 weeks for a C).  Chinese being Chinese they added a bunch of rules and stuff which made lots of sense during the olden days, not so much sense now - but the food is all TCM and nutritionally balanced and whatnot, so that's good.  Traditionally, your mother in law took care of you during the zuo yue zi (which is the month, not the center).  Now lots of mothers in law and mothers are working, so people either go to a yuezi center or hire a yuezi nanny (who comes to your house and cooks and helps you a bit with the baby).   Taiwanese women look better after pregnancy because they're well rested, and they don't age as much because they try to stay out of the sun (a lot of it is also genetics though, because Asians seem to retain their youth for longer and then age suddenly whereas white people gradually age).   As for the pregnancy weight issue, there's a lot of pressure here to stay thin while pregnant and not put on much weight (this isn't healthy) and being pregnant is stressful as fuck in Taiwan, with every man and his dog trying to tell you what you can and can't eat.  On the other hand, I don't think the 'eat lots of ice cream and get really fat' method is the best way to go either, but there's a balance that can be struck.   But generally different pregnant people will put on different amounts even if they eat the same thing."

I have one friend who did 2 weeks and then hired a nanny for a month.   My wife and I aren't quite there yet so unsure what we would do, but it seems like an astronomical cost right out the gate.  My brother in law went to some famous hospital, where the birth cost 80,000 and then the post-natal clinic was upwards of 200,000.  It seems insane to me! Add on all the other costs of having a child and it truly leaves me baffled."
taiwan,33j3n3,wijagain,2,Thu Apr 23 04:17:29 2015 UTC,"月子中心 is that costly in Taipei, and is not covered by national health insurance. You do not have to do the full 30 days, but most centers have a minimum (like 10 days or something).  Unsolicited advice:  Figure out what you and your wife want to do and start planning. If you are going to do it many of these places require reservations many months in advance, you'll probably need to save, and you'll want to discuss how closely your wife will want to follow traditional post-natal care (there are some ""interesting"" tradition Chinese medicine practices, most of which we did not follow).  You might qualify for a subsidy through the city, it's not much but it can help.   Aside from the costs, the cultural difference might give you (I'm assuming you're Western?) serious stress."
taiwan,33j3n3,locdogjr,2,Thu Apr 23 04:25:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, will keep it all in mind. My friend had a baby in November and I have seen a lot of what he has gone through, we lovingly refer to it as ""Chinese magic"", bathing the kid in ashes, amulets, certains times and days things need to happen for auspicious reasons, luckily my wife and her family aren't super traditional or into a lot of that stuff although some things will pop up I am sure.

taiwan,33j3n3,JillyPolla,5,Thu Apr 23 02:45:16 2015 UTC,"My take:   Taiwan has high education rate and female employment rate, which also leads to older age at first marriage. Taiwan do not have many real remote rural area, and have relatively few poverty people (if the poverty line stats are not skewed). Statistically, rural area and poor people have higher fertility rate. The abortion rate is high as mentioned in other comments. Apart from the abortion-friendly (relatively, again) law, major religion (Buddhism and Taoism/folk-religion) in Taiwan do not actively prohibit people from birth control and abortion. Perhaps more importantly, religious power isn't strong in Taiwan. Pressure to having marriage/children is loosen nowadays. People about 30-yrs of age more likely to seek career development instead of marriage or having babies. I think is would be the major difference between Taiwan and other similar country (crowded, long work hours, low pays) -- the society do not strongly expect younger people to form their own family as soon as possible. Parents allow their children stay at home until they get married."

As a country develops, not only do death rates drop due to improved health infrastructure, but the cost of raising children significantly increases.   Particularly, check out the section on Stage 5 for some info on why birth rates may drop below sub-replacement rate.   In addition to the negative correlation between national wealth (GDP per capita) and birth rates, low salaries in Taiwan might make raising children relatively more expensive than countries with similar GDP per capita.

Only if those are the only two variables in your ""model"" (we're really just chatting here, so ""model"" is an optimistic description).  I'm guessing salaries might be the missing variable here, and controlling for salaries might significantly improve any model relating GDP per capita to birth rates. I could actually run a model later if I have the time, I'll post if I do.    Also if they have similar GDP per capita, salaries would be similar so I don't see how your latter statement works.

Eat there.  Also, I recommend checking out Sun Moon Lake if you have a few days. Book early.  The summers can get pretty hot and humid. It's a jungle. During the rainy season, there would be torrential thundershowers one to three times a day. The thunder was so loud the windows shook and the first time I heard it I honestly thought a bomb went off. It was great. Also, earthquakes.

taiwan,33koql,st0815,0,Fri Apr 24 08:56:08 2015 UTC,"Depends on where your company is located. If it is located in Taipei then expect a very convenient and cramped lifestyle.  Taiwanese are generally friendly, but can be very feisty if you get on their bad side. My tip is to never seem disrespectful. Table manners are pretty lax here so expect a lot of burping and loud chewing. Taiwanese parents believe in allowing their children to roam free (really dangerously) especially in restaurants. So be careful where you step or you might bump some kid over, they will almost always blame you and demand payment. Also Taiwanese are horrible drivers so if you are susceptible to road rage I suggest you find other modes of transportation.   As far as racism goes, you won't find much as long as you have a friendly attitude, the Taiwanese that do discriminate aren't worth being around anyway. If you are single and average looking Taiwanese girls will flock to you (although this is really frowned upon by the locals). So don't openly be a player.  Climate is generally hot and humid 3/4 seasons. Winter it gets chilly, like around 18 C, and a bit drier.   Travel is ridiculously easy. You can get from the north to the south in about 1.5 hours using the High Speed Rail (I love how such a small island has a HSR). We have buses going everywhere and local trains going everywhere. You will be hard pressed to find a place you can't reach using local transportation.   I'm not well-versed in the legal system but it is generally fair as long as you keep a level-head. If you got anymore questions feel free to ask!"

Okay, so pretty standard then for most of the world. I asked because I know that Japan looks down on foreigners living in their country.   I know that Taiwan, China, Japan, Korea etc. are their own lands and cultures, but some cultural stuff could be shared.

With that said, if you are ever in a tight spot don't be afraid to ask. Even if the person is not fluent, they will have a good chance of understanding you and will communicate through a cute combination of words and expression.   Then again this is my personal experience so far, as someone ""kindly"" and ""informatively"" pointed out, I make a lot of generalizations. Not everyone experiences or views things the way I do.

Actually I'd never recommend someone going there.   The ""Cat Village"" had nothing quaint or charming about it. Much of it smelled of cat piss and the cats themselves looked in need of medical attention. I found it depressing. The old coal works across the railroad tracks were far more interesting. I was also baffled as to why people were going ga-ga over the cats, as if they'd never seen one before.  I seriously hope Murakami doesn't come to Taiwan specifically to see the ""Cat Village"".

Come to think of it, I wonder how much the Taiwan Vacation destination culture in Japan has had an influence on art. We already know that Miyazaki based the location in Spirited Away on Juifen. Is it that much of a stretch to imagine that Murakami read about a town of cats in Taiwan and wrote it into 1Q84?

The factory handed over the money in 2012. Presumably then the deforestation/replanting took place.  The environmental activist group quoted in the article has a series of videos on this issue on Youtube, also dating from 2013, I have no idea what drove the Taipei Times to run an article about this NOW.

Agencies might be hard to find, they tend to cater to rich expatriates (and if they speak English, there is 90% chance they are overpriced). If you feel bad about asking someone, you can propose to give him/her half of a month's rent for his/her work, that's the usual agency fee. This way, everyone is happy, especially since he/she might be able to talk to you landlord to lower a bit your rent :-)"

Do they give you all the advice you need on checking in, checking your pet in to cargo or the cabin (if that airline allows it and you opt for this)?

taiwan,33id9v,fireflysfiasco,4,Wed Apr 22 19:35:10 2015 UTC,"Having TEFL/TESL certification is definitely a plus. However, generally speaking, a bachelor's degree will get you work at a cram school (補習班/bǔxíbān), regardless of its type.  If you want to work at a school, they really look for someone with a teaching degree, but it seems to vary as to the required content area. Private schools in particular look for teaching degrees, whereas English programs at public schools may be more lenient, as long as you have TEFL/TESL certification.  My main example is me: I have a BSEd in secondary English. I am not TEFL/TESL certified, but I have a background in English teaching, which includes ESL. I've never really been asked about TEFL/TESL certification, and I've worked at grade-/secondary-school levels (not in cram schools).  If you are an English teacher already, I don't believe you need certification. If you have a teaching degree and want to work at a public/private school, TEFL/TESL may not be necessary, but it will definitely help you get that interview. If you are looking for any job, TEFL/TESL is not required, but it's always, always a plus.  tl;dr: TEFL/TESL certification is a good qualifier to snag that interview at a grade-/secondary-school; cram schools usually require just a bachelor's degree."

If you would say your grammar, syntax, and grasp of other language concepts (conjugation, tenses, pronunciation, etc.) are poor or that you ""don't really know about them,"" please become certified and, at the very least, familiar with what makes up the English language and how to teach it. You'll do yourself and your students a disservice otherwise. :)  (Sorry if that comes off as a bit too preachy, but I've had many students go to cram schools.

ChungHwa is very good overall, though having difficulty to China servers in traffic peak time (they limit bandwidth of PPPoE users to China during some specific time).

Soak for a minimum of 2 hours, preferably overnight or for 8 hours if you have the time.     Drain and rinse the cashews and place in the blender.     Add water, lemon, vinegar, and salt. Blend on high until smooth. You might have to stop to scrape down the blender now and then or add a touch more water to get it going.     Once it's super smooth, it's ready!

Link Corner Office: This place is fairly new and run by a bunch of great guys.  Decent beer selection to.  Link Speakeasy:  A small little Irish pub which is always a good time.  Link Pregame: Decent little bar they have beer pong down in the basement. Link DV8: A little dive style bar with good people. Link On Tap: The biggest bar on this list.  They have a ton of TVs showing sports. Link Little London:  Good beer selection with decent prices. Although I have to say since the original owner sold its not so great anymore.  Link   Places I would stay away from:   Beer and Cheese: Way over priced for what you get.  Bad atmosphere as well. Carnegies: Depending on the night it will be a meat market.

Botega Del Vin: Amazing Italian food but you may not be able to get a reservation. It's best to book far in advance if you can.  Link EiEiO: American style Gastropub with great mixed drinks as well.  For the appetizer definitely get the Devil's on a Horseback.  The steak, fried chicken and burger are all great.  Again you may need to book a day or two in advance.  Link"
taiwan,33c0q5,Planet86,2,Tue Apr 21 09:13:48 2015 UTC,Pork chop fried rice sounds real good.  Had lunch from an AWESOME street vendor selling dumplings today.

You will pay more for western food in Taiwan in general unless your getting shit like McDonalds.  This is a gastropub after all so the guys at EIEIO really care about their food and have a passion for it.  We took one of my coworkers there and he said it was the best meal hes ever had in his life,specifically the steak and the devils on a horseback(bacon wrapped dates filled with blue cheese).  The skirt steak is imported by them because you can't get it locally.  The bacon for their apps and burgers is made by them because most bacon here is terrible.  They said their fried chicken went through a crazy amount of recipes even going to different chicken farmers to get the right meat quality/texture.  Video Review"

This one is a bit more hidden, but a part of the fun is figuring it out where it is. :D  Also for a more quiet lounge scene, I came across Indulge the other day.  Impeccable service and delicious cocktails.  Beer and Cheese by Da'an Park has a wide variety of beers and nachos done right.  The beautiful thing about Taipei is public drinking is legal, so you can grab buy drinks at 7-11/Family Mart/convenience stores and keep hydrated en route when bar hopping. Hope this helps!

taiwan,33bfey,PotbellyPanda,3,Tue Apr 21 05:20:07 2015 UTC,"The railgun thing mentioned in the article is still very far away from actually capable for military services.  According to the principle of arms sales to Taiwan (which is, ""maintain the status quo""), it would only occur if China developed some overwhelming threat of invasion that Taiwan cannot defend by itself (kinda like how the patriot missiles comes to Taiwan); otherwise, that would make Taiwan over-confident about their safety."
taiwan,33bfey,BigOrbitalStrike,0,Tue Apr 21 06:24:37 2015 UTC,"Uncle Sam will not sell Taiwan its newest toy. We all know this. We have been asking for the AEGIS missile defense system for a decade now. What use is our PAC3 patriot missiles without the AEGIS? If you want Taiwan as a ally give us the AEGIS. If you value Taiwan as an ally give us the AEGIS. Anything short of this tells me how much Taiwan is worth in the eyes of Amerifats in suits.  On a side note, reading the comments in that thread gave me a good chuckle. Especially the farting. You can always count on the arm chair generals over at r/worldnews to give you a laugh.  edit: whenever I see ""railgun"" Im reminded of Ahhhnold Shewahzeneggger in Eraser.

taiwan,33bfey,buzzkill_aldrin,4,Tue Apr 21 05:16:27 2015 UTC,What does nuclear power have to do with anything?

There are some apartments that are reasonable, but obviously they're still more expensive than 6-12 month leases. With the short-term lease you are more likely to have electricity and internet included in the rent.  I had a place for about US$500, everything included. I looked for another place for the remaining two months and found a nicer place through a local agent, but would've been a little more expensive with electricity/internet. Would've been much cheaper if I could've stayed longer.  With Airbnb, you can sort of negotiate with the landlord to see if you can get it cheaper if you pay cash. For most places I stayed while traveling I booked through Airbnb for a week and talked directly to the landlord about extending at a discount for cash."

taiwan,33aaky,captainloveboat,3,Mon Apr 20 22:11:06 2015 UTC,"If it is that heavy and time isn't an issue, id suggest you look into shipping by boat. Takes about a month and cost a fraction of air delivery."
taiwan,33aaky,YNOTGNAIJ,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:04:12 2015 UTC,Is it possible to send to Taiwan via ship again? I came to Taiwan in 1999 and it was possible then but at some point air became the only option.
taiwan,33aaky,sqjtaipei,0,Tue Apr 21 04:40:47 2015 UTC,Of course it's possible.
taiwan,33aaky,rousimarpalhares_,1 point,Tue Apr 21 05:46:38 2015 UTC,at some point... 2005-ish... it became not possible to ship to Taiwan via surface mail via USPS which previously was a good option. I'm almost 100% positive that the USPS still does not ship to Taiwan via surface mail.  So... who does ship USA - Taiwan via surface mail?  I really hope this is true as it will save my family a small fortune.
taiwan,33aaky,sqjtaipei,1 point,Tue Apr 21 09:14:20 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's USPS. I moved to Taiwan in around 2010 and I used some shipping company to ship all my stuff via boat on a pallet."
taiwan,33aaky,rousimarpalhares_,3,Tue Apr 21 14:35:06 2015 UTC,"USPS has flat-rate shipping that is pretty affordable if you're within the weight limit, but I don't know off the top of my head what that is. That's how I've had stuff shipped here from the US. It's a much better deal than some of the other options.   I think 15 pounds may be okay but you'd need to check. Also the dimensions are going to matter."

taiwan,339ekv,sleggat,2,Sat Apr 25 12:45:08 2015 UTC,"Basically the music scene in Taiwan is too small so GigGuide.tw wasn't able to grow anymore, and I hated not being able to pay contributors (photographers, writers, translators) for their hard work. Venues, bands, labels and everyone else we approached were unwilling to pay for ads so we had to survive on about nt$2000/yr.

taiwan,339ekv,jcmatt,4,Wed Apr 22 07:49:33 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm the creator of Total Taipei. I know it's basic info--the site isn't solely focused on music listings. It's not easy to gather information on every event, concert, and activity going on around Taipei--it requires browsing a lot of information, which is time consuming. That's why on every listing page I have included a link for readers to submit information. I'd appreciate receiving such information for future events in the city. And I certainly would welcome bands submitting info on lesser known events and venues."
taiwan,339ekv,erectronics,2,Wed Apr 22 10:04:06 2015 UTC,"Hi! Thank you for reply! I think it would be a great idea to allow local bands/groups/artists to upload their own events on your site, using a from with html tagging (links images etc). I understand that it'll probably take awhile for it to take off... But, this way it'll be less work for your people to hunt down new venues/acts."

My current favorite burger shop is Burger & Company, located near the TongHua (通花) night market. They serve classic, all-American burgers, i.e., just meat, cheese (if you want it), and tomato, lettuce, etc. In this style of burger, the quality and seasoning of the beef is paramount, and at least when I went I thought they did a good job.

taiwan,337t5m,Tyr808,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:44:09 2015 UTC,In-n-out uses non-frozen beef.  How can beef from Australia be really fresh?
taiwan,337t5m,LumpyLump76,2,Mon Apr 20 19:39:34 2015 UTC,"My experience with frozen meats is, it depends highly on how it was frozen, and how well the temperatures were maintained while frozen. Fish that's been flash frozen and vacuum sealed (and not allowed to thaw and refreeze due to carelessness) is usually better than ""fresh"" unless it was literally caught that day, for example. Not sure how well this translates to beef, but frozen can be perfectly fine when handled well."
taiwan,337t5m,Tyr808,3,Mon Apr 20 20:36:07 2015 UTC,"In the case of In-n-out though, the meat is never frozen.    http://www.in-n-out.com/menu/food-quality.aspx  This is one of the reason they don't expand as fast.  They basically have to establish a supply chain of fresh meat.  Fish needs to be deeply frozen to kill anything that maybe harmful to humans."
taiwan,337t5m,LumpyLump76,2,Mon Apr 20 20:41:49 2015 UTC,"Oh I understand that all, just mentioning that frozen doesn't automatically equal bad.

taiwan,337t5m,Tyr808,2,Mon Apr 20 20:58:58 2015 UTC,One of the reason Taiwan pork tastes so good is because they were usually walking around that morning.....

In ""downtown"" Tamsui, there is a David's English Center and Kojen very close to the MRT, as well as various bǔxíbān scattered throughout.  As for your other question, commuting via the MRT is not difficult or uncomfortable. Getting down to Taipei City doesn't take very long and is relatively cheap. I cannot estimate the time you'll take, but it shouldn't take too much effort to find a bǔxíbān on the green/red line and not have to transfer at all.  Reading is quite easy; I rarely take the MRT, but when I do, I always bring my Kindle. Yes, they are a very smooth ride.  I can be a bit bias about Tamsui, but the general area is an excellent place to live.  As for Beach Riding Country Club, I've heard bad things* from equestrian friends about how they treat their horses. There is another place below Zhongzheng Mountain, in Tamsui right before Beitou, that also has a riding facility called Magical Equestrian Center. You will need a car or scooter (or bike if your legs are up for it) to the place, but it's worth it. The missus and I went there and found it excellent; the horses seemed to be taken care of and the staff were very nice. I don't have the name of the place, here, because I'm at work, but I'd be happy to provide you with information.  *I don't have personal experience with Beach Riding Country Club, so it's only hearsay. However, I trust the judgement of my friends, as they actually ride horses."
taiwan,339655,Get9,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:41:12 2015 UTC,Thanks very much! That's very reassuring.  I would love to get the name of the riding facility when you have a free moment :) Are there any buses that go out that direction?
taiwan,339655,Get9,2,Mon Apr 20 17:45:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, there are buses that go up there. but I'll have to look that up for you later.  There is bus information on this website, if you can read Chinese.  Basically, the easiest way is to take bus 631, from Tamsui MRT Station, to the stop 興福寮 (Xìngfú liáo). It leaves at these times: 6:15, 8:30, 10:30, 12:30, 17:30, and 20:15. You would take a bus continuing on in the previous buses' direction, through Beitou, to get back to Tamsui MRT Station.  There is another bus route option on the website, and it also says a taxi trip up there is about nt$200 one-way."
taiwan,339655,vigernere1,2,Mon Apr 20 17:46:17 2015 UTC,"If we do choose to commute, how comfortable is riding the MRT for an hour or more?   Just as a reference, Hong Shu Lin to Taipein Main Station is about  ~45 minutes AFAIK [Edit: according to the MRT website, it's 33 minutes, although during peak times it might be slightly longer]. As for how comfortable of a commute it is, I think that depends on whether you can find a seat. If I had to guess:   Weekdays, off-hours, going to Taipei: shouldn't be a problem. Weekdays, rush hour, going to Taipei: all the seats may be taken by commuters getting on in Tamsui. I can't say for sure, though. Weekends, going to Taipei: Tamsui is a popular destination. Every single time I've boarded at Tamsui station on a weekend day, all seats were immediately filled.   As for the commute back to Tamsui: you can't make accurate predictions. It depends on what station you board at, the time of day, etc. Obviously people will be getting on/off at each station. (Pro tip: a large number of people will disembark at Taipei Main Station, be ready to pounce on a seat there).  One last thought: don't underestimate the cost of two people commuting into Taipei. You average, one-way fare from Hong Shu Lin to stations in downtown Taipei will be anywhere from $35 to $45. Two people commuting 5 days a week will cost $2,800 to $3,600 per month. So you might want to see what kind of place you can rent closer to Taipei for $20,600 to $21,600 per month (i.e., this is $18,000 plus the cost of commuting to Taipei).  Good luck!"
taiwan,339655,pipedreamer220,3,Mon Apr 20 18:04:33 2015 UTC,"Hongshulin to Taipei Main is 33 minutes on the train. Of course it'll be closer to 40 or 45 factoring in the walk to the station and the wait time of course.  And the Metro fare starts at $16, so unless the downtown apartment allows them to walk to work the cost savings won't be nearly as much as what you're describing. And 20k isn't going to get them anything as nice in Taipei proper--I've seen studios with kitchens going for that price..."
taiwan,339655,vigernere1,2,Mon Apr 20 18:14:44 2015 UTC,"And the Metro fare starts at $16, so unless the downtown apartment allows them to walk to work the cost savings won't be nearly as much as what you're describing.    Not just walk to work, but potentially a short bike or scooter ride as well. (Riding a scooter in Taiwan is not for the faint of heart, though). But yes, your point is taken.   And 20k isn't going to get them anything as nice in Taipei proper--I've seen studios with kitchens going for that price...   I live in a spacious, quiet, three bedroom flat for $20,000/month in Zhong Zheng, a 30 second walk from the river parks, and a 5-7 minute walk from the MRT. And while it's far from luxurious, it's also far from being a sh*t hole.   OP, you certainly will have a nicer flat for $18,000/month near Tamsui than you would in Taipei, but that doesn't necessarily mean you have to live in a hovel for that price in Taipei either. Ask your father to see what's available for $18,000-$20,000 a little closer to the city. In the past when I was hunting for a place to live, just  crossing the Xindian River into New Taipei City resulted in a noticeable price drop, while my commute would have been extended only by 2-3 MRT stops at most."

This is definitely a good option, as avoiding a commute is generally preferable. I would say, though, that the further away you are from Taipei City center, the more bang for your buck you get in regard to furnishing, room number, total apartment size, etc. Since OP's apartment has a full kitchen, patio, and two bedrooms, maybe also furnishing?, it may be more beneficial to take that and add the commute into cost-of-living."

Like a lot of Taipei, the area has a mix of very old, almost falling down dumps, and very new nice places.  There are some single-family townhomes on Bashi-yi that might fit what you've mentioned.  They are far enough back that you might not get enough traffic to matter, but be aware that Taiwan is NOISY.  Housing has single-pane glass, sound reflects off the concrete jungle, and a lot of vehicles have inadequate mufflers.  Regarding my earlier comment, buses and cabs and taking the scooter to go get groceries gets old after not very long here.  Don't try to run around on a scooter until you've been here long enough to see what traffic, and drivers' behavior, is like."

Either do what the above mentioned or make sure to walk to the end of the platform to get a seat. It can be busy during peak hours though. But I don't find it too inconveniencing to have to stand as the MRT is quite smooth. You'll enjoy living in this area. The only downside is there isn't much for grocery stores in the Hongshulin area so we usually go to carefour in Tianmu. Or Costco, which is 1.5 hours one way. Hope you enjoy Taipei! I know I have."

Otherwise, Taipei 101 and Elephant mountain are in the same general vicinity, and there is a Din Tai Fung in the basement of Taipei 101.  The easiest hot springs to get to in Taipei is probably Beitou, it is accessible by MRT at Xinbeitou station. However if you're more adventurous and willing to spend more time, Wulai is also highly regarded by the foreign friends I know, but you'll have to take a taxi or track down a special bus to get there.  Maokong Gondola is also reachable by MRT, you would first get off Taipei Zoo station, and then walk a short distance to the Gondola station. note that Maokong Gondola does not run on Mondays, and it often shuts down when there are afternoon showers. Check the operation status before heading over.  Every night market has its ""personality"", some more geared towards food, some towards cheap clothing, some arcade games, and some tourists. Shihlin night market and MRT Jiantan station is almost always the one foreigners head for, and has a good mix of everything, but Taiwanese people consider it too touristy. Which of the night market you should visit would probably depend on what you expect :).  Jiufen is probably the only major problem here, as you'll have to take a bus at some point. You could either take a train to Ruifang station, and look for the Gold Fulong bus line, or take highway bus 1062 at MRT Zhongxiao Fuxing station, and get off at Jiufen old street. It's definitely worth the effort though.  Exchanging money is rather easy at the airport, and from what I've heard the exchange rates aren't too bad. It should be the easiest option if you're looking to exchange money in Taiwan."

taiwan,337ioi,x3nomik,2,Mon Apr 20 06:40:31 2015 UTC,"I was sound asleep in bed in Kaohsiung when the 921 quake struck. Books started tumbling from the bookshelf above me, and I distinctively remembered being struck by a rather thick tome of Calculus (which probably explained why I hate it so much). Mom was panicking, but remember to shut the gas pipe, while dad picked up my still asleep brother. We rushed downstairs in pajamas to the small park around the corner, the world shaking around us.   By the time we reached the small park, Dad realized that he hadn't brought the keys, but couldn't remember if he closed the doors or not. The first wave of quakes had subsided, and he was in an argument with Mom over whether he should rush back and grab the keys and some valuables. A major aftershock soon afterwards ended their debate, and we huddled down. I remember seeing people in underpants in the park with us too, and I never slept in underwear ever since.   I think it was about 3AM that we decided it would be safe to return, and fortunately (?) the door was indeed left open. We watched TV reports of a collapsed building in Taipei, not realizing that at the time it was only a very minor portion of the devastation that was 921.   It was an awful experience, but what really strikes me is how unprepared Taiwan was -- and still is -- for a major earthquake like this. During my year as exchange student in Tokyo, I had two earthquake drills, one in daytime conducted by the school, and another in nighttime conducted by the local government. What impressed me most, was how even though this was just a drill, everyone acted as if it were the real thing -- turning off gas and electricity mains, opening doors to main passageways, and retreating to a designated park with a piece of soft helmet protecting the head. At the park, there were officials and volunteers handing out water and emergency rations (I was told that part of the reason for the drill is to get rid of food packets that are near their best-by date), everyone had a sort-of picnic and then headed home.   Taiwan is just as prone to earthquake as Japan. Though Tokyo had been expecting ""The Big One"" for a while, there's no saying if a major earthquake would strike Taiwan out of the blue, like 921 did. Every time a big earthquake hits Taiwan, I always remember the chaos and panic that September night, and wonder if Taiwan would do better if it happens again. It might be overkill to have the readiness level Japan has (but it undoubtedly saved many, many lives in the 311 Tohuku earthquake), but at least some preparation plan, plus proper and updated education on what to do when an earthquake strikes could serve Taiwan well."

Usually cost is per photo and some other things, so the price gets high fast if you want a lot.   We had a pretty good experience with Catherine photography. We weren't happy with how one location photo turned out and they offered a free re-shoot, but we just opted for extra pages and portrait.   Some extra costs might be for an outside shoot (if it's out of the city I think), a driver for the shoot, if you want to bring the makeup artist, and some other items they'll tell you about if you ask. A lot of it is cut out while they try to get you to sign up.   I don't have experience with other studios, but I'm pretty satisfied with how everything went with Catherine. Our budget was under their cheapest package but they still worked with us. I think they're worth a look.   You could also look into hiring a freelance photographer and makeup artist online. We found one that had their own wardrobe of dresses to choose from and the photo quality is about as good.  They didn't charge per photo, so we ended up with a lot more keepers. The total price was about half vs a studio going this route."

I guess eligibility is in the eye of the beholder. Even if one is ""eligible,"" briefly becoming stateless, not being guaranteed citizenship even after this, and not having the same dual citizenship rights as Taiwanese is unappealing and uninviting.   [...] In fact, the government is considering just this sort of rule change, allowing those with exceptional skills, talents, or resources to obtain ROC citizenship without renouncing their own...The proposed rule change...is aimed at drawing such exceptional talent to Taiwan, but it...is extremely limited in scope and will not apply to most foreigners.

I'm saying that people who live in Taiwan for x-amount of years, have worked there, and/or are married and pass all other citizenship requirements, should be able to do so without giving up their citizenship to their original country. Taiwanese don't have to give up their Taiwanese citizenship to be dual-citizens of other countries (so, I would need to give up my US citizenship to gain Taiwanese citizenship, but my wife would be able to gain US citizenship while retaining her own).  Also, as it currently stands, in order to apply for Taiwanese citizenship, one has to give up their original citizenship with no actual guarantee that they will be granted Taiwanese citizenship. This has resulted in people becoming stateless in Taiwan after their citizenship applications were denied.  At the very least, a policy of reciprocation should be developed."

taiwan,334byp,himit,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:56:23 2015 UTC,"This is what management consultant salaries are typically like in the USA (scroll down to associate): http://managementconsulted.com/consulting-salaries/2015-management-consulting-salaries-undergraduate-mba-interns/  If you do a top-ranked MBA you can get one of these jobs.  These firms will also sponsor visas out of school.  A top-ranked MBA is expensive (160k+), but if you are making 140k base out of school, one doesn't need to worry too much about any debt required."
taiwan,334byp,rousimarpalhares_,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:59:25 2015 UTC,"Well that's interesting numbers. I'm still considering what to do once I got my permanent ARC (preparing for an MBA / start my own company / why not both?) and this is definitely helpful.   And I need to forward that to my French friends, we are severely underpaid compared to American people -_- But I blame the taxes"
taiwan,334byp,mvrofiq,1 point,Mon Apr 20 04:03:16 2015 UTC,"American MBA programs love western european passport holders.  They make up only a small percentage of American programs, compared to MBA factories like India and East Asia.  Schools are actively trying to get more of them.    I actually was talking about the salary issue with one of my French friends, who said that typical MBA pay in the US is really unusual in France, and would be reserved for a really senior person.  An interesting thing about European vs. US programs is that European programs are for career advancement and in the US, people typically change careers entirely.  It's not very common to do engineer -> banker or banker -> strategy consulting in Europe, but it's extremely common in the US.  Something like 90%+ of students at top 20 programs in the US switch industries after MBA.  Also lastly, a remark about APRC is that you don't really need it if you go to a top program and want to work somewhere.  Many of the top companies will do on-campus recruiting and let you bid for any location that you can be functional (i.e. know the language at a business level).  Or if you work for a top consultancy, many projects will staff globally if you can justify it.  An alum I met who works out of the Taipei office of a large consultancy basically spends most of his time in China, Korea, and Japan on various projects.  It's possible to be at a US office and get staffed on these projects as well, and some consultancies purposefully try to arrange that as a perk (Deloitte is famous for this if you agree to stay a third year)."

taiwan,330i4q,SwissStriker,7,Sat Apr 18 08:39:15 2015 UTC,"First, I really must emphasize, if you have been traveling around SEA and don't visit Taiwan, you're really missing out. It is a unique and amazing country!  Giant is manufactured in Taiwan and makes a fine bicycle. I have never tried it, but according to this site:  http://formosaguy.blogspot.com/2008/05/leave-your-bike-at-home.html  You can go to any wholly-owned Giant outlet and rent a bike, and return it to any other one in the country. It is $35 for the first 3 days and then $7/day after that.  Taiwanese people are very very friendly. You can probably ask around locally and have more luck than an internet search will provide. There is also very cheap mass transit going practically everywhere in the country, if you aren't married to the idea of biking.  Here is another interesting resource: http://joshdu.blogspot.com/2012/11/how-to-cycle-aalllll-way-around-taiwan.html  Good luck!"
taiwan,330i4q,itssheramie,4,Sat Apr 18 09:49:17 2015 UTC,"Hi there!  I biked around Taiwan in 8 days on a proper road bike and it was an absolutely fantastic experience. I highly recommend it if you're looking for an enjoyable challenge. Cycling's very popular in Taiwan and biking around the island is actually rather common. I know for a fact that Giant offers a rental program that caters to people looking to go on multi - day bike trips all over the island. From what I could find online, the bike they offer is a Giant Great Journey that comes with the panniers in the picture. It's a decent bike, but don't expect to get around the island in 8 days on it unless you're a seasoned cyclist. The base price is 1200 NT (38 USD) for the first 3 days and 200 NT (7 USD) for each day thereafter. (This info is from a blog post so take it with a grain of salt). Fixing your bike in case anything goes wrong should't be a big problem since Giant has shops all over the island. The west coast is comprised of flat roads while the east coast has some challenging mountains. But, quite simply, getting around Taiwan on a bike is absolutely possible."
taiwan,330i4q,Armadillou,3,Sat Apr 18 10:16:33 2015 UTC,Lots of good info on this blog:  http://taiwanincycles.blogspot.com  The author is a longtime expat in Taichung with a ton of experience riding around the island.
taiwan,330i4q,Damariscotta,2,Sat Apr 18 20:11:30 2015 UTC,Cycling around Taiwan is one of the best ways to see the country. There's a wealth of trip reports and advice in this subreddit and on Forumosa and various blogs. In a nutshell: many Giant shops rent out bikes with panniers (no need for that backpack at all) and a toolkit so you can easily get around and change tubes as needed. If you're just riding around the city then whatever... but in three weeks you could do the round-the-island tour and see some of the most beautiful parts of the island with hardly any preparation or planning.
taiwan,330i4q,x3nomik,1 point,Sat Apr 18 13:16:26 2015 UTC,"Giant is a decent brand to go with, the aluminum bikes are all very light now. Price would be around 30k NT brand new for a okay road bike. I'm not sure about renting bicycles to travel around."
taiwan,330i4q,jerk_twistie,1 point,Sat Apr 18 09:39:29 2015 UTC,"If you're used to riding around SEA, then this probably won't come as much surprise, but I've been struck by how dangerous the road traffic is, in addition to being literally struck by a few vehicles (low speed, no damage or injuries). Be extra careful, as drivers do not yield to bicycles (or anyone else for that matter) and aren't used to bicycle traffic on the roadways."
taiwan,330i4q,dorylinus,3,Mon Apr 20 00:22:05 2015 UTC,"I've been driving bikes and bicycles around Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia, I think this should be alright. Is the traffic as bad as in those countries? And what about the roads themselves?"
taiwan,330i4q,dorylinus,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:33:18 2015 UTC,"Of the three you mention, I've only been to Thailand. It's certainly not nearly as crazy as that. The roads aren't bad for the most part, though those that are fronted by shops and businesses tend to be rather bad for cycling with tons of double-parking, no sidewalks, etc. I often describe traffic in Taiwan as being halfway between Thailand and Japan-- they have working traffic signals, marked lanes, etc., though they are frequently ignored by crazy drivers."
taiwan,330i4q,Wanderer_Takezo,2,Mon Apr 20 01:12:18 2015 UTC,Sounds good to me!  I've cycled in quite a few places now and I think Taiwan might just be perfect for cycling.

Makes life easy for the rest of us. But seeing as Taiwanese are not used to dealing with these types, someone has to make a PSA. The trick to dealing with these guys is to politely pretend they don't exist. Don't look at them. Don't make too much noise. You see old guys in Thailand fighting with each other all the time. Threatening to stab each other. British guys always talk about ""stickin a knife in ya'."" 60-70 year old guys. But their vision is poor.

Using a phonetic writing system while omitting the tones is retarded. I don't know why mandarin learners don't get this. I am assuming this toneless pseudo-Pinyin crap has a lot to do with people's awful pronunciation. Even foreigners who can read and write excellently and have a wide vocabulary seem to have awful accents.

You'll most likely also be prohibited from leaving Taiwan until the prosecutor decides whether or not to press charges against you. Given the circumstances, though, you'll probably receive a deferred prosecution for a year unless you actually did cause significant injury (broken nose, cuts, blood, etc.)  If you handled it well, i.e. nobody gets hurt, no appearance of violence and no actual injury, then it's not too far fetched to imagine that you could get off with no charges. Maybe even a pat on the shoulder from the police and prosecutor in private. But you'll have to be extremely tactful, which probably isn't within the bounds of cleaning his clock.  Bottom line, don't go all hulk on him and smash windows and fling MRT cars 20 meters into the air."

Taiwan has the standard set of intellectual property laws including copyright, patent, and trademark laws that you would expect anywhere else.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs has a anti-counterfeit merchandise unit that works with local police on counterfeit merchandise.

Additionally, I think #3 is at least misstated. Preventing the spread of fire through a parking lot is actually relatively easy, since they're not generally made of flammable materials and the only flammable items in them will be the vehicles and the fuel (of all sorts) that they contain. What would be a major concern from linking the parking lots is the spread of smoke and fumes, much of which could be toxic in and of itself, which could spread not just to the parking lots but into the structures above, even ones that aren't on fire."

There are not enough events in Taiwan to sustain such a large dome, and it is well-known among the industry that it will be a huge money sink.  BOT projects such as this acknowledges that building a dome is not a profitable business, and therefore allows the company to build economic buildings to make up for the massive costs needed to build a dome.  Taipei Arena (台北小巨蛋) failed because it was completely dedicated to the dome, with minimal space for shops.  The Kaohsiung Arena (高雄巨蛋) has a mall next to it.  People have complained how these companies are allowed to use government-owned land for such a low rent, but often forget that hundreds of billions were spent to build the place.  Farglory would love to not build the dome and (from what it looks like in the picture) build a much smaller performance hall in its place.  It would then have all the advantages of a BOT (low rent, maximize money-making venues) and none of the disadvantages."

To this day, she is self-conscious about her skin color and not getting too dark. Why? 『妹妹，妳越來越黑！』  There are some things wrong with these different standards.

That way you are assured of a better salary than joining some regional player or local startup.  Like /u/Derpydog mentioned, if you are looking for a job IN Taiwan, the starting salary for PhDs is around 54K. A non-postdoc job in the industry relies heavily on local connections rather than merit or past accomplishments, so as a foreigner you're at a natural disadvantage. If you seriously consider going that route I'd suggest first doing a couple of years of postdoc work in an influential lab (academia sinica would be a good place to start, it's quite foreigner friendly), getting to know the local business landscape and having your boss introduce you to future employers."

All this being said, there are quite a few companies beavering away, biosensors are big in Taiwan, and a very significant % of the world's glucose sensors are MIT, with some very professional companies manufacturing own brand along with OEM business for the big (and small) names in the business.  There are some manufacturers of lab equipment too, more SME size and they often focus on OEM business too but some branded ones also.   There's a foreigner owned company making drug injectors in Taiwan, they are med devices in their own right.  All the big electronics companies in Taiwan have invested in or thinking of investing in med device and lab diagnostic equipment. You should send an e-mail to all of these companies, I'm talking about Lite-On, Compal, Quanta...those kind of companies..send an e-mail to HR and they may get back to you with some interest :). All of these companies are multi-billion USD revenue companies and are desperate to diversify their businesses. Their pay is relatively good for Taiwan and they have the investment money to make some impact and importantly pay your salary on time.  Taiwan also has some economic institutes that take on people to work on public-private technology partnerships, specifically ITRI which has it's main base in Hsinchu (along with the aforementioned electronics companies). Their pay, for Taiwan, can be quite good. By working in ITRI one can also get to know many industry contacts in Taiwan (or the other way round as can also happen)."

One or two of the Chinese biosensor companies are doing some more advanced stuff, insulin pumps, but mostly the big guys from the US have the patents sown up (outside China anyway).

I'm dropping off the idea of doing a postdoc, especially in Academia Sinica purely because I am very likely going to offend my supervisor because he has in many occasions, suggested funding my postdoc and making arrangements to have it partially done in the west.

When I first moved back to Taiwan I took an insane pay cut but I was determined to reasonably fill that gap and more within 3 years. It took a bit longer than that but I'm pulling in well comfortably into the 6 figures in NT a month here and well above the average engineer in Taiwan. I'm really aggressive and determined (I'm typing this from my office, and I'll still be here until 1-2am). However I'm happy with what I do. Everything decent I've got here was through connections too. I'm a little egotistical about myself because for every person that has met a challenge and failed at it, I at least found some way to overcome rather than moan about it.  There will be people here who are upset and grouchy about the whole thing, and they're right. In nearly any capitalistic country you'll have the same annoyances. In Guangzhou I was offered tons of dead end but well paying careers. Back in NYC and the Valley I'd be rolling in cash right about now but I'd be depressed.  There's a lot more than money in Taiwan. I really enjoy the short commute, the accessibility of things I enjoy and love, the people around me, the pace of the city, the food here, the accessibility of a quick vacation whenever I need it, it's location so I can take a quick and cheap trip to Singapore or Japan. Those are far more valuable than a few extra bucks, at least to me. That's why I live in Taiwan."

Taiwanese are some of the friendliest people I've met and this is exactly why I wish to make a move over. I just need to make sure that I'm not ""terminating"" my career prospects by moving to Taiwan (as commented by a Taiwanese friend of mine), hence I'm here to seek for advice.  I understand that 1) you're an engineer, 2) took a pay cut when moving back to Taiwan, 3) took more than three years to get back to your original pay. May I ask if your past experience in NYC (?) was the key to land you at the right place in Taiwan, or you practically started from scratch once again?  Honestly, long working hours is not my major concern. I work about 50-60 hours a week with no complains, mainly because I know I have to do this to graduate. It's also a relieve to know that it pays if you are willing to contribute, a very motivational comment for me to consider moving over."

If you're planning to stick to the high roads, you can manage with English in Taipei.  As for the night markets - hit up the big ones (Shilin is nice, a bit touristy, Raohe and Tonghua in my opinion have a nicer feel), but don't feel like you have to see all of them.  Some of them can be quite alike.  Also, while Taipei can be fun, there is a lot of stuff to see on the East side of Taiwan, including the beautiful county of Taitung (Taidong).

Is China making that an enticing option? I don't think so. There are visible differences in social norms and values, as well as major rifts in liberty and freedom. And most importantly, Hong Kong, which was supposed to be a model in showing the prospects of unification, now looks basically broken down, and exemplifies exactly why Taiwan would not reunite with China.  I don't care about the complicated history that stretches over the past century. It may have shaped why the situation had come to what it is, but it shouldn't frame us into certain future paths. If China wants unification with Taiwan, it must be more than just ""because history says you should"", but rather ""because your future says you should"". Until China shows clearly that unification will bring better prospects to Taiwan than their current offering,  I will stay in the ""status quo leaning towards independence"" camp, like most people I know."
taiwan,32mpaf,Roygbiv0415,2,Wed Apr 15 01:55:05 2015 UTC,"On the converse, what's the benefit of declaring outright independence?

What benefit is there on relinquishing claims to the mainland and changing the name of your country? Let's for a moment pretend that China would not use force. Would you have more international recognition? Definitely not.   Declaring independence is basically saying we will never unite with you again. I think the prudent thing is to maintain the status quo, wait and see if China liberalize enough to allow a quasi-two state solution, or that they modernize enough so that it would be in Taiwan's interest to reunite."

The only reason the ROC does not have recognition is due to PRC pressure. This is a fact. Two things really matter in any form of Taiwan Independence:   The PRC not using force. The PRC not coercing non-recognition of the entity we call ROC or Taiwan.   So your question is posed with a hidden assumption that precludes the question itself. Lack of recognition is due to PRC coercion, not due to PRC's threat of force.   Threat of force (acting on Taiwan) -> whether any form of Taiwan Independence could be realized. Coercion (acting on other nations) -> whether we can obtain recognition.   The two are intertwined but distinct.  Declaring independence, then acquiring international recognition, it is a two-step process, not a cause-effect relation."
taiwan,32mpaf,zjnetil,2,Thu Apr 16 23:18:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly this, Taiwan has no recognition due to PRC asserting pressure on other nations basically telling them to not recognize Taiwan. If China stopped threatening Taiwan AND stopped pressuring other nations to not recognize Taiwan, then Taiwan will  most likely quickly gain recognition.  Many countries will benefit for recognizing Taiwan officially due to how important some of Taiwan's key industries are on a global scale."
taiwan,32mpaf,jcs542,1 point,Fri Apr 17 07:47:15 2015 UTC,"On the converse, what's the benefit of declaring outright independence?   Recognition, diplomatic ties with other nations, and official representation at the UN for starters.    Declaring independence is basically saying we will never unite with you again.   I'm not sure that this is an accurate characterization. Certainly, it sends the message that Taiwan is not working towards unification, but it would not necessarily mean taking it off the table permanently. Barring the threats made by the PRC regarding their response to an official declaration of independence, it would in many ways be the best strategy for unification on Taiwan's own terms. It would establish a clear precedent and groundwork for future relations, which could then include slow integration (e.g. free-trade agreement, open borders, customs union, etc.) that could proceed as relations get better with time. This is, of course, assuming relations got better, but if they didn't then a declaration of independence would be the best choice anyway for obvious reasons.  EDIT: word missing"

I don't think so. My ancestry is Chinese but I have only been to China once. It is very different from Taiwan. Why should the Chinese descended Taiwanese millennials be part of a country they have never been to, have completely different values with, and now also use a different writing system. I am sure Xi Jinping wishes for a peaceful ""reunification"" with Taiwan and is not a villain that wants to destroy Taiwan but the PRC is a government. Governments do play as villains because decisions of a government no matter the intent will affect millions of people. Japan is not Voldemort either, should Taiwan join them?

And after all this time creating a completely different government, economy and society, China PRC has no right at all to any stake in Taiwan. However, Adam's point about PRC having a legal claim makes sense, even if I don't accept it.   (reposting from a comment I read) The problem, as I understand it, is that the U.N. has chosen PRC as the new ruler of China (and all of its territories), and Taiwan was never established as a nation, left in a state of limbo due to the treaty of San Francisco which only dissolves Japan's claim on Taiwan, but doesn't explicitly state that Taiwan is an independent nation. Of course, it doesn't say that Taiwan belongs to China either, and maybe independence could have been built off of that...that is, if only the ROC (KMT) hadn't been claiming until relatively recently that it was also the official government of China (and all of its territories). Leading us back to the switch between the ROC and PRC's status in the U.N.  Now things are different, Taiwan's government no longer considers itself the true ruler of Greater China. But in that time PRC has come to power, and is effectively using the ROC's original claim to show there is a basis for Taiwan and China to be together.

taiwan,32mpaf,mudpirate,9,Wed Apr 15 05:21:02 2015 UTC,"What I'm always surprised with is that people never seem to realize that history doesn't really matter in current politics. The interests of the parties involved is what matters. You need to look no further than the PRC replacing ROC in the UN for an excellent example.  Who this piece of land belongs to is a non issue at this point. A country is not a country if no one recognizes it -- it's what the international society sees that counts. So what Taiwan is currently doing -- aligning closely with China and at the same time claiming that China is always the one to blame for our failure in having a standing in the international field -- is precisely our own downfall. If we truly want dignity as an independent country, we need to figure out who has the best interest in Taiwan being independent, and align with them.   I would argue that in this case, blatantly, the answer would be Japan, perhaps followed by US and India. If we want to retain a choice in our future, we need to forward political, cultural and economical ties with these countries that will likely be at odds with China. Putting everything in China's basket is exactly what China is looking for and will ultimately end in unification."

You might be able to book tickets through a Taiwanese travel agency (I don't know much about them) but the ride itself won't be pleasant either. You need to delay the day in Hualien. Seriously.  Somebody else will probably be more knowledgeable about the logistics of driving from Hualien to Taichung, but I'm pretty sure Highway 8 is still out. I think there's an alternate way but you definitely need to find out.  You don't mention transport in Tainan so you probably need to know that Guanziling is very far out from the city itself and served by spotty public transit.

If so, then take it instead of the Evergreen bus).   Sept. 26-Sept. 27- full days in Taipei Holiday festivities? Visit Memorial Hall, Lungshan Temple, zoo, gondola ride, dinner in Taipei 101 building?   Taipei has a decent zoo and it's fairly large. It can easily take a half day to see it all. Also: 1) if you want to see the pandas, then be sure to buy your panda ticket right as soon as you enter the park (they use a reservation system); 2) it can be quite hot in Taipei even in late September (I went to the zoo once in September and it was brutally hot being under the sun all day).   Consider timing your ride on the Maokong gondola to coincide with sunset. Then have some tea or beer at one of the restaurants up there. Also, there's no need to pay extra for the ""crystal cabin"" gondola.  You don't want to visit the National Palace Museum? I'd pick that over Memorial Hall (and yes, the museum will be packed with tourists (many from China) - it's unavoidable, so just accept it).  Why do you want to eat in Taipei 101? Do you want to go to Din Tai Fung? Otherwise there are so many other (and less expensive) food options in Taipei. Why not visit the RaoHe night market? If you want to go to Din Tai Fung, consider going to the original location(?) at Yong Kang Street (永康街) - most people visiting like the atmosphere on Yong Kang street, and it's easily accessible from the DongMen MRT station.  Other random stuff (which you probably know):   You can buy a SIM card at the airport. Look for the cell phone store counters to the far left, after you exit customs on the ground level. You can also buy a SIM card at 7-11. You can buy 1, 2, and 3-day MRT cards at any MRT station (all stations have manned booths, as well as automated vending machines). A normal MRT card requires a $200 deposit; I'm not sure if a 3-day card requires a deposit or not. (And remember, absolutely no eating or drinking once you cross the yellow line in the station.) Also, I'm not sure if the 1,2,3 day MRT cards work on the buses (probably?)   Have fun!"
taiwan,32kfv2,onewaybackpacking,2,Tue Apr 14 15:58:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you! This was all super helpful. To answer a couple of questions... National Palace is on my list! Forgot to add, I will do that. Thanks.  I heard you can eat in Taipei 101 and get the beautiful view over dinner. Do you know about this?  Certainly plan on going to the night markets!"
taiwan,32kfv2,vigernere1,3,Tue Apr 14 16:02:34 2015 UTC,"I heard you can eat in Taipei 101 and get the beautiful view over dinner. Do you know about this?   The view is great - you certainly should go up to the top and check it out (this is also an activity you can try to time with sunset. The night view is spectacular). But I don't see any reason to eat up there. That's just me, though."
taiwan,32kfv2,pipedreamer220,2,Tue Apr 14 16:05:37 2015 UTC,"I've heard sunset was beautiful! That's why I thought dinner might be a good idea, but judging by a couple comments, that might not be the best idea. Looks like we will just plan to visit for sunset.  I was pretty shocked by the September temperatures! Will definitely consider bringing clothes/accessories that offer protection from the sun.  Thank you, again, for everything."
taiwan,32kfv2,pipedreamer220,3,Tue Apr 14 16:18:10 2015 UTC,"Oh and let me just say again: it can be quite hot, and the sun quite intense in late September.

taiwan,32kfv2,onewaybackpacking,2,Thu Apr 16 00:55:12 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Pack light and plan on buying one for 200Nt at a market or an umbrella for 100...   We are not disagreeing on the main point, which is protecting oneself from the sun.   OP, you'll be here during typhoon season, so it's likely to rain and you will want an umbrella or rain jacket/poncho. If you do choose to use an umbrella to shade yourself from the sun, just note that the fabric in many umbrellas may not block UV rays, and you still could bet sunburned.  The ultimate, most flexible rain/sun solution would be:    On sunny, non-rainy days, a hat protects your head while keeping your hands free.  On non-windy, rainy days, an umbrella works well. On windy, rainy days a rain jacket/poncho might work best.   OP, if you do bring (or buy in Taiwan) a rain jacket/poncho, buy the thinnest, lightest one that provides rain protection and has pit zippers, because the jacket will make you warmer, and you'll want to ventilate as much body heat as possible."
taiwan,32jo1i,lalilli,6,Tue Apr 14 09:40:51 2015 UTC,"Villa 32 is terribly overpriced. Go to Volando in Wulai. Excellent experience. Their French restaurant is actually almost ok too.   If you have time/money, spend the night there.  EDIT: https://www.volandospringpark.com.tw/en/04hotspring/view.asp  EDIT2: I am not sure about the hourly rooms, but be specific and ask for river view if you book there"

taiwan,32jo1i,vigernere1,3,Tue Apr 14 16:36:36 2015 UTC,"If you want a premium experience, consider the Hotel Royal (礁溪老爷酒店) located in Chiaohsi (an easy 1.5-2 hour bus ride from Taipei). I recommend booking a one night package, which includes a buffet dinner/breakfast (the buffet is fantastic), or you can upgrade and eat at their Western-style restaurant (which is quite good). The hotel has a nice outdoor pool, massage/spa services, etc.   The only drawbacks -  really small ones in my opinion - are 1) the views from the rooms are average, 2) there's  not much to do in Chiaohsi. Once you're finished at the hotel you'll probably want to take a bus directly to back to Taipei or your next destination.  Edit: I second the Wulai recommendation, although I prefer sitting outside in the hot springs by the river. Wulai is an easy ~45 minute bus ride from the Xindian MRT station. It also has a small Old Street (老街) with a typical variety of Taiwanese shops and night market food. If you go to Wulai, be sure to take a ride on the old log cart train up to the waterfall."

China is a tyranny that is clearly expansionistic, thus it should be contained. We fought in the bloodiest war in human history and secured the Pacific so that we would not be threatened by invasion ever again. Having the Chinese take Taiwan would allow for Chinese expansion into the Greater Pacific and put Japan at greater risk. And if China is going in the direction I think it is, the chance that somebody will do something stupid in regards to Japan will increase by the day. If war breaks out in regards to that, from Taiwan the Chinese can go to Guam and from Guam to Hawaii, a full state. They'll have to jump across a lot less islands in the future than we had to back during the War. Keeping Taiwan a de-facto, and perhaps one day a de-jure, independent democratic republic will stop this scenario from developing.

taiwan,32fc6k,ShrimpCrackers,2,Tue Apr 14 20:29:29 2015 UTC,"I've exchanged to Japan for my senior year (geez that's a long time ago), and in the end I really thought that the exchange experience itself is worth far more than the study. I'd urge you not to consider the prospects of studying as your NO.1 concern in picking a place and school, but rather have an experience that you would otherwise unable to get in your hometown.  Of the East Asian countries, I've never been to Korea (animosity towards Korea runs high in Taiwan), but I'd suggest the rest as such:  Japan is an excellent option. It has a truly unique culture, easy traveling, great food, and is very safe. However living can be expensive, and many cultural norms can feel very restrictive to outsiders. Learning Japanese can be a bonus if you're into Anime, Manga and Japanese stuff, but it's utility is somewhat less in the Global arena.  Taiwan is also an excellent option. It's a different kind of Chinese culture, due to the 50 year rift and different historical paths taken compared to the mainland. Living is relatively cheap, traveling is easy (though slightly less so than Japan), and of course Taiwanese cuisine is famous. But you'll learn (again) a different version of the Chinese language, both written and spoken -- I'm actually curious how useful expats find their knowledge of ""Taiwanese Chinese"" when they visit the mainland. Exactly what Taiwan will be like when you exchange here, will likely depend on the school and its location. If you have more details on which exchange partner schools are available, it might be easier to pinpoint the location and what it's like.  China is... China. It's huge, with endless places to visit, though not all are easy to get to. Living is cheap, unless you're in the biggest of cities, but living quality can suffer somewhat. The food varies greatly across the country, each location with its own signature dish. How good the food is will probably depend on where you end up. And of course, seeing that China's dominance in the region and beyond is almost a certainty, learning proper Chinese could be very useful to your future career. However, as a Taiwanese I'm probably not in the position to give China a fair assessment -- I helped out my aunt there for a summer vacation, and escaped back to Taiwan at the first opportunity. I hated the place.  Finally (I guess), there's also Hong Kong. It's basically one massive, densely packed city, with a unique flair and plenty of activities. You again get a different kind of Chinese culture, this time heavily influenced by the British, plus HK speaks mostly Cantonese, and their version of Chinese is slightly modified to portray their spoken language. HK also has great food, though traveling is (naturally) rather restricted."
taiwan,32fc6k,Roygbiv0415,5,Mon Apr 13 14:27:59 2015 UTC,"Just as a nitpick, people pretend as if Taiwan and China shared the same culture until 50 years ago (which is a strange number because that would place us around 1965?). That couldn't be further from the truth. If anything, Taiwan didn't share the same Chinese culture for hundreds of years, and certainly not during the Japanese era, and it was only after the 1940's did CKS try to import more Chinese culture into Taiwan.  That said, the culture of every decade changes dramatically in Taiwan so unless someone is arguing that Youth Taike is somehow Chinese culture, it's a bit more complicated than that.  Finally, not a lot of people put a lot of thought into these statements because its repeated so often, but once one does, it's clear there are a lot of historical and logical fallacies behind it."
taiwan,32fc6k,ShrimpCrackers,2,Tue Apr 14 08:31:38 2015 UTC,"You're right I guess. We're just so used to saying 50 years that it's become a habit. It should be around 65 by now.  As for sharing culture, it's not that different. Taiwan and China share more or less the same written language and spoken language, observe the same holidays, share similar aesthetics in architecture and art, and -- though I'm less willing to admit this one -- an authoritarian not-so-distant past.   As I stated before, I hated China, but it never felt foreign. I would never want to become a citizen of China, but that doesn't change my understanding that Taiwan and China share a generally similar cultural heritage."

They are lumped together because they're all part of this incident.The pilot is part of the privileged class. I'm not talking about some objective measure of how much wealth makes you the upper class. I'm talking about a privileged class where the association with someone in power/wealthy makes you part of that class.  With the many scandals now being uncovered in Taipei, people are infuriated and they want targets. But that's just the initial reaction.  The fact that the Ministry of Defense tried to downplay the punishments only made it worse, adding fuel to the rage.  Bottom-line, it's not about racial groups."

Once you get your ARC, they will take you to the DMV to set up insurance/registration.  At that point, you definitely want to consider getting your scooter license.  For foreigners, they have a computerized test that is pretty sketchy in some parts.  Some of the translations aren't very accurate, so it's possible to fail even though you answered correctly.  With that, then you take the road test.  After passing, then you can get the Taiwan license.  The license lets you drive any motorcycle or scooter up to 250cc.  Hope this is of some help!"

After getting my ARC, my husband was told he needed to get a basic health check done with a doctor before getting his driver license after he moved back (he was born in Taiwan). We decided to go ahead and get mine done at the same time because why not. Once we get to the driver license office, he got his with no problem. However, they told me I had to wait 1 year before I can get my drivers license (we were not aware of this). If I remember correctly, they told us if I have an international license then I could get the license without waiting a whole year. Now, I know there's some rules depending where you moved from. I'm from the US, so I can't say what it is for Canada. Now I still have the option to get an international DL through Triple A while overseas by mail. I haven't done it yet because I'm not in a hurry to do it. It might be in your best interest to go ahead and get an international DL.

Currently only Taipei and Kaohsiung has a proper MRT system, so you might have to rent a car / scooter, or figure out bus tables for the rest."

Maybe consider doing Tainan, Hualien and then Taipei, though I don't know how long Tainan to Hualien would be, but that'd be the only long ride of your trip."
taiwan,321l43,lalamountain,1 point,Fri Apr 10 06:22:53 2015 UTC,"Use the HSR (High Speed Rail) as much as possible. Taiwan isn't big so you can get from Taipei to Taichung in about an hour using the HSR. There will be buses to Sun Moon Lake from the HSR station. Taipei to Tainan is about an hour and a half. If you wake up early enough and are okay with just some light sight seeing you can easily do both Tainan and Taichung in two days using Taipei as your base of operations.   For Hualien you can either take the special local train (forgot the name), which is a 2-3 hour train ride, from Taipei to Hualien. and spend a few days there.  10 days is plenty of time to see all of what you want to see. The HSR is fast and makes Taiwan seem ridiculously small (You can get from Northern Taiwan too Southern Taiwan in 2 hours) Since you have family members that are fluent in Mandarin, just ask the help desk in every HSR station. They will give you everything you need to know on how to get somewhere."

There was nothing of military value that an adversary could gain from the pictures. The pilot should be punished, but not with some overblown charges. I thought the news was covering this topic so much because the pilot had a history of misconduct and Janet Lee brushed off criticism at first and acted like an apology was beneath her."
taiwan,31zkvc,Tyberos,5,Thu Apr 9 15:10:08 2015 UTC,"It's being blown up because only recently a conscript corporal was worked to death in confinement for ""attempting"" to bring a smart phone into his unit. The corporal had 10 days until his discharge, yet his superiors bent rules and rushed him into confinement.  If anything, the pilot should get at least the same if not heavier punishment. Yet he was initially going to be let off with 3 reprimands.  If you've been in Taiwan's military you'll know that reprimands mean absolutely nothing. Reprimands are easily made up for at year-end with made-up causes for merit and you break even. It's done at every level of the military. I know because I was company S1.  Probably a third of the Taiwanese population have been in the military and know that shit feeling when you're standing night sentry and waking up at 5 for PT and the high ranking officers get to leave base without a pass and bring their girlfriends on base to show off stuff, then wake up past 7 for a late breakfast which we set aside and kept warm just so they can enjoy a leisurely morning.  We want heavy punishment because we (as in most males from 20 to 50) have had enough of those assholes running the armed forces like it's their personal gang.  Janet Lee is not even worth mention.

taiwan,31xicf,atticusmass,13,Wed Apr 8 22:47:26 2015 UTC,"Despite the rant, I'll try to explain.  There are four phases of water saving measures, water rationing is phase three. The two phases before that, lowered water pressure at night and limiting water to swimming pools / car washes, have already been implemented. Here is a map of the water limiting situation in late March, where yellow are the areas already in phase one, and orange in phase 2. No one is enraged because there are in fact steps before a full cut off of water, and those have been implemented, however it is the worst drought in at least 60 years, so there's little anyone can do.  When there is a lockout, people store water beforehand. Most apartment buildings have their own little reservoir on the rooftop that will last quite a while. So what happens is that there is always a spike in water usage just before the cutoff, rendering a short (less than 1 1/2 days) lockout useless. Two days is barely effective as a means of directly limiting household water usage -- It's targeted more at commercial usage (again, car wash and the like), plus there's pretty substantial savings from having no pipe leaks.  Semiconductors, or the whole industry even, was never a huge concern in Taiwanese water usage -- industrial water usage only takes up 9% of the total water usage in Taiwan, and I'm sure there are provisions to keep them running through this water crisis. Household usage is, surprisingly, just another 20%. The rest, 71%, goes to irrigation and aquaculture. Being no expert, I have no interest in going too deep into exactly how and why water resources are distributed in such a manner, but blame the farmers if you must.  Taiwan receives plenty of rain every year. problem is, it's mostly in the summer, in the form of Typhoons. The rains come too fast and concentrated to be easily stored, so dams and reservoirs are all we could rely on. In a year with a relatively dry winter and late plum rains (as what's happening now), there's indeed little we could do but pray for rain. What should be fixed though, is the water price. No politician would risk stepping this mine, but it really needs to be done. I think instead of just raising the price of water by a certain amount, it could be a good idea to first collect a ""pipe maintenance fee"" that will go towards renewing the entire water supply system, cutting leaks from the current 18% down to more reasonable numbers. By the time the renovations are complete, people would have gotten used to the extra fee, and it could be made permanent."
taiwan,31xicf,Roygbiv0415,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:54:46 2015 UTC,Ok well thanks for taking the time to write that out. I was understand the impression (based what I have seen from the locals) that no real measures where being taken. I understand that the water supply is controlled by the economics group of the govt rather than an agricultural one. So raising the price may be too late by the time the water runs out due to how many ties the construction companies have and how the push to keep water prices low.

I suggest taking the first bus of the day all the way to the top and working your way down to the entrance.  We avoided crowds for almost half the day by doing this! It was great.  And there are a lot of taxis just hanging around at trails. We didn't try to use them though.
taiwan,31u9p7,Deivuh,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:40:04 2015 UTC,"Damn, should've checked this sub yesterday, I just went to Taroko Gorge today, ended up signing up for a tour bus service. It was good, as someone who likes to explore and take pictures, the time at each stop was pretty short, and there was a stop at a jade shop, which I was not really interested at all.   Anyway, hope that both of you had a great trip :)   Edit: Nevermind, I didn't read that you would be here on the 22th haha :)"

taiwan,31u9p7,Roygbiv0415,1 point,Wed Apr 8 08:17:03 2015 UTC,"LOL  I'm just curious about what the quoted NT2500 taxi tour offers, and whether it's worth it or not"
taiwan,31u9p7,Phos_,1 point,Wed Apr 8 08:36:18 2015 UTC,"Hmm from personal experience, it's a pretty standard Taroko tour, and they charge you extra if you go visit the cliff (I forgot the name...) next to the ocean. It's pretty good value overall if it's your first time in Taroko and you only have a day"
taiwan,31u9p7,Roygbiv0415,1 point,Wed Apr 8 08:46:05 2015 UTC,The itinerary is as follows: Hualien train station or any hotel in Hualien city - Cingshuei Cliff - Entrance of Taroko National Park - Taroko Gorge Eternal Spring Shrine - Swallow Grotto Trail - Tzu Mu Bridge - Holiu Suspension Bridge - Tiansiang - Baiyang Waterfall Trail -  Hualien train station or any hotel in Hualien city   It's a personal guided tour too. Given that the shuttle bus is already NT600 per person I think the taxi tour's really cost efficient to share for 4. Lots of time saved too!

Why there's so little diversity people leave their carts - filled with goods - unattended in the street. There aren't even any ""urban youths"" to make this a more vibrant experience for them. It makes me sick.   Such homogeneity is going to be the cause of Taiwan's downfall, just as it was the reason for Japan's woes.   I know right, Japan is such a shit hole.

I unlocked my phoned while I was in Taiwan it took me maybe 15 minutes to do.

The author apparently wrote it while instructing a Taiwanese language course at Harvard, but it's not a difficult book by any means. It uses stories, lists, dialog, songs and translations, and phonetic practice to learn spoken Taiwanese. The book comes with three CDs (can rip into MP3s or get them from the website) and I highly recommend it.   Also, it uses a tonal marking system to try and help you learn the eight tones. As for romanization, it uses a mixture of Tai-lo and POJ, but it fairly effective and easy to pick up. If you search for videos on YouTube, there are supplements for the book, and the book's website has the first ten chapters and additional resources.  This is nt$600.    大家來學臺語 (We Came to Learn Taiwanese)  I have also used 大家來學臺語, which also comes with a CD. I use this book for additional vocabulary and sentence/structural practice. It uses a romanization system that I'm not sure how to name, but once you get a foundation in Taiwanese, this book is easier to use (like I said, it's a supplement). It uses pictures for vocabulary and sentences for practice.  This is nt$350.    Glossika Taiwanese Fluency  For speaking drills, Glossika has a Taiwanese fluency package that uses language drills and a supplemental PDF guide to help you in learning. They will also send you a print out of the PDF if needed.  This is nt$2,320."

Easy to Say Taiwanese is written for native Mandarin speakers and is not a textbook per se. Practical Taiwanese Conversations is OK, but it's not my first choice.   I just checked books.com.tw and didn't find Harvard Taiwanese 101, although the Lucky Bookstore on Roosevelt Road near ShiDa/師大 usually has a copy (they can order it for you too). Spoken Hokkien is only available at one bookstore in Taipei (or possibly all of Taiwan):  台北市新生南路3段76巷6號1樓 Tel: 02-2362-5799  Sorry, I don't remember the name of this bookstore. (It's an old and musty bookstore. It looked like they specialized in indigenous languages). Another great book - although one you'd only buy if you are already far down the rabbit hole that is Taiwanese - is 台語根源, ISBN 957-9128-84-7. It's not a textbook, but rather it provides a cultural/historical background on the language and shows common origins (and divergences) between Taiwanese and Mandarin.   The last resource to mention - although probably far beyond what you are looking for - is the Glossika ""mass sentence"" audio package for Taiwanese. If you (or anyone else) is serious about learning Taiwanese, then this is the best collection of recorded Taiwanese learning material for foreign learners (note: it's not intended for pure beginners).  Oh, I forgot to mention what's probably the longest existing source of Taiwanese learning material: Maryknoll. This is a missionary organization that wrote a set of Taiwanese learning materials, as well as a freely available Taiwanese dictionary (which annoyingly is only available as multiple PDF downloads). I've never used their materials because, AFAIK, it's only for purchase if you contact/visit them directly.  P.S. It's not a bad idea to go to Eslite - maybe the big store at they have at 信義 - and just browse the books they have in the language learning section. I'm sure they'll have a collection of Taiwanese books (although most may be aimed at native Mandarin speakers).  Good luck!"

What they don't understand is that it in fact it makes it impossible to remove the stateless applicants from poorer nations and it makes it so very few of the applicants that we do want from becoming citizens.

They think doing what this letter suggests will result in a huge influx of people from poorer nations while not realizing that they're incentivizing them because Taiwan can't exactly kick out a stateless person wherever they want. Whereas a US citizen has too many incentives to give that up. It's ironic that most people in government and many Taiwan voters uneducated on the issue will think it's best the way it is now.  Therefore education is key. There are thousands of Americans running profitable businesses in Taiwan and living in Taiwan for 15-20 years or more, that would love to have a Taiwan citizenship."

You should eventually see a red light blink. Press the 電視機 button and the red light should blink once. Bring the remote close to the TV receiver (not sure if it's the TV or box), about 3-6cm away, and press 電視開關鍵 for 5 seconds (I guess it's talking about the infrared parts). The red light should slowly blink twice. The red light should be on now. Press the 學習 button. The red light should turn off and the process should be complete. Follow steps 1-4 again. This time, instead of pressing the 電視機 button in Step 2, press the 訊號源 button. This should finish setup of the signal and volume.     The button above the giant OK button, it's in between two others and ovular and has 選單 on it, should turn on/off.

As I have said before, this advocacy group is hilariously delusional.   Devils Advocate: Ben Goren though is for all intents and purposes Taiwanese and is living here permanently. He speaks Chinese and reads Chinese perfectly and participates in Taiwan culture and identifies with them. So unless we're going to conflate identity with citizenship and just call anyone white a foreigner, especially when some of these writers actually do have Taiwanese citizenship by giving up their home (and being technically stateless for a while), I don't think it's fair."
taiwan,315g0i,ShrimpCrackers,2,Thu Apr 2 18:58:27 2015 UTC,"Fair point and my comment was not directed at this particular person. I agree with your sentiment that people can become Taiwanese, sadly I am not sure the people here actually do, you will always be the other in Taiwanese eyes if you aren't the proper complexion. That is a bit of a tangent. My main point was just how many articles and topics are floating around about cross straight relations. I am sure I am not the only person who has been in Taiwan for many years and absolutely hates hearing about it or having ""that"" conversation. Very few people have a unique or interesting view that makes A Taiwan foreign policy discussion all that interesting.  Maybe it is just the time of year and AIIB thing happening, maybe I'm just being a grumpy Gus because my boss has become SUPER into politics after the SF movement or maybe one too many ""Dude, what if China attacked?!?!"" comments read and overheard over the past years."

taiwan,315g0i,ShrimpCrackers,1 point,Fri Apr 3 06:27:59 2015 UTC,"Well that's your opinion right, just because someone differs from yours doesn't mean you need to get insulting. In reference to your earlier post on this, American Citizens for Taiwan has every right to post what someone else from a different nationality has to say, because nationality isn't really the issue, it's the opinions or ideas. They can co-opt or adopt it. In fact every movement or advocacy group tends to adopt some ideas originating from elsewhere. Even the KMT has many of its ideas from abroad when it was founded and created, you don't hear me criticizing them for taking ideas from non Chinese nationals or non-Han.  As for your second notion, thing is, how do you know he doesn't? Unless you have proof that Ben Goren, who as-far-as-I-know, does indeed write tons of letters to the UK government about Taiwan isn't also advocating for Taiwan that way, then what else do you expect out of him? Most people who feel this passionate about Taiwan have done less. Regardless of how dismissive you may be about him or not, we can't say no one reads his blog either, or that he hasn't been printed in papers a few times. You may wish to argue the uselessness or illegitimacy of those papers too, such as the Taipei Times or Liberty Times, but whatever, there are people that see them and agree with him.  Also everyone volunteers or shows their love for Taiwan in different ways. It's not always political and its not limited to a race or nationality thing and you won't necessary agree with them. That's kind of the beauty of freedom of speech, ya know?"
taiwan,315g0i,openchan,1 point,Sat Apr 4 03:15:51 2015 UTC,"Well that's your opinion right, just because someone differs from yours doesn't mean you need to get insulting.   This is the internet though    This doesn't mean you need to get insulting even if it is the internet. You are on the /r/Taiwan Subreddit, and you can see the sidebar that the rules are that you must be polite. Other subreddits have different rules. This is the main point of my posts, the below are ancillary:   If nationality isn't important, why name the advocacy group American Citizens for Taiwan?   This is backtracking. Your initial post was basically about how because they're ""American Citizens for Taiwan"" they cannot publish articles from non-Americans that they agree with. I've already pointed out that most groups take ideas or articles from abroad, I have rarely seen few that haven't. Even Stormfront will publish supremacist articles that are not from America. Stormfront even gave people bonus points on their forums if they're Nationalist Chinese back in the 2000's because apparently Nationalist Chinese are better than ""the other lesser races"".  But, it's not any more silly than AIPAC making Israel the central focal point of US Middle Eastern policy for 5 decades or ACT here trying to make Taiwan a major focal point of US policy in Asia alongside Korea. Agree or disagree with it, it does happen and it is normal.   On top of that, most of the Taiwanese people in the US (i.e. ones who can vote and whose opinions matter) I would guess are KMT supporters, albeit KMT supporters who want an independent Taiwan.   As a once board member of TAA-NY and involved with USA national TAA embodiment organizations, such is not the case from my experience. The largest pro-KMT organization in the USA in my view right now isn't even the overseas KMT, it's the Chinese Benevolent Association and most of them aren't even Taiwanese. Many of them have never even set foot in Taiwan. Their leaders are, however, regularly invited to ROC leadership camps, which I have attended for a few years.   This brings up another point worth mentioning: Why do none of these advocacy groups support allowing diaspora with citizenship to vote in elections by mail? I'm sure all the Taiwanese citizens living in Mainland China, Singapore, the US and EU would love to have a say in the way the island is run. I've never seen ""pro-democracy"" advocates publicly push for this.   Actually this issue has been discussed a lot in the 90's and still occasionally is by the said groups you claim never discuss so. I have relatives that run or used to have factories in China. The amount of pressure they got to vote for the KMT from the PRC government was ridiculous. But this is anecdotal and you are welcome to dismiss it as you see fit. However the justification basically comes down to this; with apparently 2 million Taiwanese that may or may not be vote eligable in China, the Chinese government has too much incentives as is to use their influence to sway votes in Taiwan, and will continue doing so. They still do so even though currently flights are required but not enough in numbers to significantly change the tide in all but the most exceptional scenarios."

taiwan,30xw2y,JillyPolla,2,Tue Mar 31 16:27:37 2015 UTC,"So after all the fighting the opposition still agreed to send the letter of intent to join the AIIB? Just join ""with dignity"", and have the Executive branch provide evaluation reports to the Legislature.   經過約1小時的朝野協商之後，立法院副院長洪秀柱宣讀結論，取得下列共識。    (1)、決議行政院應有尊嚴加入亞投行，向亞投行籌備處遞交意向書，以維護國家最大利益不得自我矮化。 (2)、行政院相關部會應提出完整評估報告，就申請加入情形，向立院財政委員會作出專案報告，以落實國會監督。    https://tw.money.yahoo.com/亞投行-爭議-立院朝野協商獲共識-同意遞交申請意向書-080520789.html  The media keeps harping on how Ma is making all the decisions himself, when in fact the decision was reached in a 國安會議 (National Security meeting?). And then the opposition and a bunch of protestors are accusing Ma of selling Taiwan.  My question is, did the executive branch really do something illegal? Did they really strip the Taiwanese people of their democracy? Does the Taiwan Executive branch not have the authority to make these decisions? Is this not similar to what POTUS is allowed to do?   the Treaty Clause, which empowers the President of the United States to propose and chiefly negotiate agreements, which must be confirmed by the Senate,   In this case, is Ma empowered to submit a letter of intent to join AIIB? And then have the legislature confirm it afterwards?"
taiwan,30xw2y,gunnm27,7,Wed Apr 1 00:47:31 2015 UTC,"The key thing to understand is that current legislation authorizes the Mainland Affairs Council to negotiate on all matter related to the mainland. Because legally the PRC does not exist, it is just an ""interior"" region held illegally by rebels, any and all negotiations related to the PRC are not subject to legislative review, but instead processed as internal affairs.  That was also the key issue behind the CSSTA and ECFA negotiations: it in reality acts like a treaty with a foreign state, yet it is all handled as if negotiating with some NGO in the country.  One of the primary aims of the 318 occupation of the legislature was to establish a proper framework of legislative supervision over negotiations related to the PRC. While the KMT tentatively agreed to it, they've then carried on with their push of Chinese integration since then, while the relevant legislation sits there with two versions having key differences and no support from the KMT legislators for the more elaborate version.  At the same time, the Ma administration have taken the stance that they will just keep on negotiating and finalizing new agreements with China, with absolutely no regard to legislative supervision.  One mustn't forget that KMT still hold majority seat in the legislature. A lot of times the opposition back off after the closed-door ""negotiations"" so often done in the Legislative Yuan, because the KMT would threaten them on some other legislation. This is why a lot of citizen movements are targeted at cleaning out the legislation.  And don't forget, the National Security Council meetings are chaired by the president. Any and all decisions reached there are equivalent to a decision by the president. It is a meeting for the president to solicitate opinions, not for people to vote for or against something."
taiwan,30xw2y,zjnetil,1 point,Wed Apr 1 05:15:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation.  So if negations with the PRC is overseen by the legislature, then it's a kind of admission that PRC is a seperate country. Thus, Taiwan is an independent country too?"
taiwan,30xw2y,gunnm27,2,Wed Apr 1 15:05:49 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. In a nutshell all they have to do is to copy and paste the current laws regarding foreign treaty negotiations and search and replace the relevant words with ""Mainland China"". That in effect grants legislative oversight over agreements with China just like with any other nation, while avoiding the political sensitivity.  Just like how, for example, in dealing with the US and Japan, we have the Cultural and Economic Office instead of an ""Embassy"", we have Representatives instead of ""Ambassadors"". When we deal with the US and Japan, we give the personnel a different name yet everything works as if we have a formal diplomatic relation with them.  We could do the same with China. Yet the KMT strongly resists this for no real reason."
taiwan,30xw2y,zjnetil,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:18:24 2015 UTC,"There seems to be a lot of misinformation on both sides.  It seems to me that the opposition keeps acting immaturely with their various antics in legislature. Supporters constantly protesting (it seems) every action KMT takes. But the reasons are drowned out in slogans. I would have understood their cause  much better if they were communicated well like you have.  And on the KMT side, there seems to be an equally or worse communication of their reasons and intents. Perhaps they are stuck in the  past where government just do their job without the need to communicate with the public.  Would the opposition support what you have proposed? Treat PRC issues the way we deal with the US?"
taiwan,30xw2y,gunnm27,2,Wed Apr 1 20:39:59 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you mean by ""opposition"".  Even the opposition is divided into those that believe in Two Chinas and those that believe in Taiwan Independence. The former would prefer just legislative supervision, while the latter would prefer a completely normalized foreign relations with the PRC.  People tend to lump things together and look at Taiwan politics as KMT vs opposition, but it's actually way more divided than that. Especially considering how Taiwan hasn't undergone real political shuffling after the 318 incident, it's hard to tell what the ""opposition"" really consist of now. The real test comes in the 2016 elections.  Overshadowing all of this is the 1992 Consensus and the Anti-Secession Law of the PRC, i.e. the threat of war. It's hard to say what the opposition will accept because it (and public opinion) may change overnight the moment the PRC move its troops or fire a missile into the Taiwan Strait.  Although all this may be set to change, with outspoken ""newbie"" political figures like Ko (Taipei City Mayor) questioning the 1992 Consensus and a new generation of voters who are willing to entertain the idea of standing up against China."

taiwan,30xw2y,gunnm27,-3,Wed Apr 1 22:55:47 2015 UTC,If any KMT official turned Keelung river into Johnny Walker Blue Label grade whisky the opposition will still protest its not Taiwan made Kavalan grade whisky.

Notice, no mention that the protesters are unhappy about how the decision was made secretly and unilaterally by the Ma administration, or that once-again a major China-deal was made without consulting the legislature, or that it's not cool how it was first sent to China's Taiwan Affairs Office which is behaving like Taiwan into a province of the PRC.  By excluding all the major points, one might be mislead into thinking the Black Island Youth are simply protesting the application to the AIIB which is completely not the case."
taiwan,30xw2y,ShrimpCrackers,4,Thu Apr 2 19:05:56 2015 UTC,"This is just a letter of intent, not a final binding agreement. It was not first sent to Taiwan Affair Office. It was delivered to both the secretary of the AIIB and Taiwan Affair Office at the same time, with the title of Minister of Finance of Republic of China. There was no secret deal. They expressed their intent to send the letter to the media, and then sent it. Is there any legal basis that the executive branch needs explicit legislative approval to conduct foreign financial affairs? Ma met with heads of government and discussed before sending the letter. Did the other 40 or so countries get legislative approval to send the letter of intent? Why is this being categorized as a ""China deal""? It's not a direct deal with China. It's more of a membership to a supranational organization in which China would play a large part.  Did you read the part where they quoted the slogan? Isn't that showing what their grievances were? This is more reliable than Thinking-Taiwan, which is literally funded by the DPP. Those articles get posted to this sub all the time.   Again, it shows that these protesters are just reactionary sinophobes who pretty much will protest anything having to do with China. It's funny how DPP has to find a needle in a haystack to complain about. ""Why didn't you send it to mailbox A instead of mailbox B????"" So if going through the Taiwan Affairs Office is submission, is China submitting to Taiwan when they conduct business through the Mainland Affairs Council?"
taiwan,30xw2y,Get9,4,Tue Mar 31 20:27:11 2015 UTC,"I believe the answer to six is because of the concessions Taiwan will have to make to join the organization. Taiwan's membership approval necessitates making a deal with China, whether formally or informally known as ""a deal."" How many of those forty countries in question five need to concede their statehood to the PRC for membership?"
taiwan,30xw2y,Get9,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:40:30 2015 UTC,"WHat concession? Nobody even knows the specific terms of membership yet. All we know is that North Korea has been outrightly rejected out of 40 or so countries that have expressed interest in joining the AIIB.   I mean joining the AIIB as say something like Taiwan, province of China or Separate Custom Territory of TPKM or Chinese Taipei wouldn't be out of the ordinary to what is going on now. We both know that joining ROC wouldn't join under the ROC name, and that joining as something like Taiwan, province of PRC like Hong Kong is joining as HKSAR is unacceptable and wouldn't happen."
taiwan,30xw2y,gunnm27,3,Tue Mar 31 21:39:21 2015 UTC,"Which is a concession, even if it isn't out of the ordinary. One step further is requiring Taiwan to join under a One China Policy. Again, not out of the ordinary, but I don't see how that disqualifies concession."
taiwan,30xw2y,gunnm27,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:53:19 2015 UTC,"Eh, we're just arguing semantics at this point. I don't see it as a concesion as that point has long been concede in the 70s when ROC was no longer being recognized as China, but I get your point. I guess the alternative is to insist on joining as ROC and having the application denied."
taiwan,30xw2y,gunnm27,4,Tue Mar 31 22:04:08 2015 UTC,The solution is to have a non KMT party in power to submit the application. Then it will be praised as a huge step in improving Taiwan's international standing and economic future.
taiwan,30y1q8,mickeymousebest,8,Tue Mar 31 17:07:30 2015 UTC,"Pretty impressive how the Ma administration is pushing through another significant 'black box' agreement without consulting anyone, including the legislature.   Regardless of Pan-Blue papers claiming that it was also faxed to the AIIB directly (does it make a difference because it was also sent to TAO?), unilaterally secretly-planned actions like this is what largely what sparked the original Occupy LY / Sunflower Movement protests.  Given that police were caught in photos being passed all through facebook, hiding their identifying serials and manhandling some of the protestors, it might get ugly all over again."
taiwan,30y1q8,ShrimpCrackers,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:07:29 2015 UTC,"So if going through TAO is submission, then China is also submitting to Taiwan when they go through Mainland Affairs Council.

taiwan,30y1q8,JillyPolla,0,Tue Mar 31 21:02:24 2015 UTC,According to this they delivered the application to both the Taiwan Affair Office and the AIIB secretary at the same time.   The protesting group is hopeless. They pretty much have knee-jerk reaction to anything related to China. It's a wonder they haven't protested the name of Taichung to change it to Taitai yet.
taiwan,30y1q8,JillyPolla,0,Tue Mar 31 18:15:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, because I'm sure that the method of delivery is the only and most important reason they have. Not the black box ""negotations?"" Not the selling out of Taiwan under a ""One China"" agreement/policy? Not the skirting of normal, constitutional means of passing legislation?  The only way I can think of this being a ""knee-jerk reaction"" is that they didn't organize more before taking it, once again, to the streets."
taiwan,30y1q8,Get9,6,Tue Mar 31 20:32:35 2015 UTC,"This is just a letter of intent to join an international organization in which China would play a large role. You'll see that the letter of intent is signed by Ministry of Finance, Republic of China. So what's selling out about that?   There's no legislation to be passed. The whole idea of black-box negotiations is red herring by to denote anything they disagree with. There was no negotiation. There was no treaty/agreement. There's no reason why the executive branch needs explicit legislative approval to send a letter of intent, which should be an ordinary foreign affair operations.   Meanwhile, Chen Shui-Bian literally joined WTO as the ""Separate Custom Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu"", and nobody ever calls him a Taiwan sellout."
taiwan,30y1q8,JillyPolla,-1,Tue Mar 31 20:57:21 2015 UTC,"The dominating role, where Taiwan cannot be Taiwan and, according to this and other articles, must fall in line with China's One China Policy. ""But the Republic of China also agrees with this."" Yeah, and see how much the people really love that.  You know what? Maybe it's not legislation to be passed, but you'd think such a thing would be given far more consideration. You know this isn't just a letter of intent; it's going to happen. They intend for it to happen, whether or not the people of Taiwan agree with what is going on.  ""After Taipei expressed its interest in joining the AIIB, Beijing said it would welcome Taiwan as long as it joined under the 'one China' principle. Beijing’s terms also stipulated that Taiwan must apply through the Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO), the agency under the State Council that handles relations with Taiwan."" Sounds like negotiating to me. And, come on, don't be so naïve as to believe there is nothing going on behind the scenes.  Finally, though we're not talking about Chen Shui-Bian, his use of ""Separate Custom Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu"" was bullshit, too. Did it sell out Taiwan? Yep, just one of the many slivers the PRC is slicing away from Taiwan."
taiwan,30y1q8,Get9,2,Tue Mar 31 21:06:33 2015 UTC,"I would like to buy your crystal ball. What do you mean it isn't just a letter of intent? It literally is a letter of intent. I mean right now it's up to the AIIB to decide whether to consider Taiwan's application or outrightly refuse (as they did with DPRK). If they considered it and comes back with a list of demands, then the ROC government can then agree or disagree with those demands at that time. Why do you know what those are going to be, or that the ROC government will agree wit those wholesale?  Right now the consensus on both side is Special non-state-to-state relations. So the affairs between the two are conducted with TAO and MAC. Why is it submission when Taiwan goes through TAO, but not when China goes through MAC? What you said isn't really negotiation btw. I mean you're getting bogged down on the delivery of a letter, when what you should be concerned with is negotiation over the terms of the membership with AIIB once the reply comes back from AIIB (which I think it will).  I mean it's admirable that you are idealistic about naming, etc. But the fact  is if you want to join international organization as ROC, the end result is that you'll basically be a member of no organizations."
taiwan,30y1q8,JillyPolla,0,Tue Mar 31 21:14:08 2015 UTC,"I would like to buy your crystal ball. What do you mean it isn't just a letter of intent?   I'm sure if I had one I'd only be angrier. What I meant (and hence the word ""just"" there instead of just writing ""isn't a letter..."") was it's obvious there is only one way this is going to go, and if China has set terms for Taiwan to be ""part of this,"" I can only see this letter as basically a wink and a nod sayin, ""All right, we're in this.""   Why do you know what those are going to be, or that the ROC government will agree wit those wholesale?   I don't; it's speculation. However, general ROC policy seems to be to kowtow to Beijing, so it's not unheard of nor even that uncommon.   What you said isn't really negotiation btw.   You're right; they're terms. Taiwan can try negotiation, but there will be none of substance.   Why is it submission when Taiwan goes through TAO, but not when China goes through MAC?   I feel like it's because the PRC views both venues as just an extension of its overall control of Taiwan. ""Whatever little thing we can do to allow our compatriots across the Strait the illusion of freedom.""   I mean you're getting bogged down on the delivery of a letter, when what you should be concerned with is negotiation over the terms of the membership with AIIB once the reply comes back from AIIB (which I think it will).   I'm concerned about all aspects.   I mean it's admirable that you are idealistic about naming, etc.   That's the linguistic side of my heart, fighting wars against semantics. :P"
taiwan,30y1q8,Get9,2,Tue Mar 31 21:33:33 2015 UTC,"Proof on the general ROC policy being kowtow to Beijing?  I mean you're operating with double standards here. The idea of a Mainland Affairs Council basically shows that ROC doesn't recognize their sovereignty and dealing with their government require a special organ in the government to deal with it. So isn't it just the same thing? I mean you can't have it both ways. Either dealing with these special government organs is submission, or it's not. You can't have it be that when Taiwan deals with TAO, it's submission to China, but when China deals with MAC, Taiwan is submitting to China AGAIN."

Lets argue about every comma, apostrophe, and every possible instance our sovereignty will be stolen from us in this letter of intent to join.

taiwan,30vf2m,lalamountain,5,Tue Mar 31 00:44:52 2015 UTC,"I'd really like to know how much weight it can haul around, and if it will cause severe wear on it's components. ...   From their website it says it gets a maximum of 100km per charge at 40km/h, provided the total weight of the rider and scooter is between 165~185kg. The scooter is already 112kg with batteries. so it's optimal to be between 53~73kg. The gf, dog and I total 160kg already. :P  so it's really not going to be good for taking anyone along with you. I think that will seriously hamper their success."
taiwan,30vf2m,serpentax,2,Tue Mar 31 06:52:30 2015 UTC,"No it's not, its definitely a one-person scooter. That said, the real thing is they want to standardize the battery so there can be a 4-battery Gogoro scooter versus the current 2-battery ones.  Given how elegant the drivetrain is and how compact it is, it's easy to imagine that if these things were popular, the price would drop significantly, then they can even have a Gogoro compact car."

taiwan,30vf2m,laopi,6,Tue Mar 31 01:38:09 2015 UTC,"Yesssss! Well, when you see that Taiwanese people can be noisy even with a simple bicycle (by letting it rust to the point where cycling or braking make horrible noises), I wouldn't be surprise if they manage to make noise with an electric scooter as well."
taiwan,30vf2m,rob-on-reddit,2,Tue Mar 31 01:52:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  In China they banned electric bikes in some areas, for example Shenzhen, because of too many deaths."

taiwan,30vf2m,JillyPolla,4,Tue Mar 31 11:06:09 2015 UTC,"Assuming the problem is they are silent, the government would just need to mandate some sort of noisemaker for electric scooters and bicycles that are expected to share the roads with gassed up scooters and cars.  They should probably require helmets for electric bicycles in Shenzhen, but banning them altogether was easier I guess."

(Or require a form of license, since apparently ebikes don't).   Again, silent vehicles are certainly something that require both drivers and pedestrians to adjust to, but the backwardness of banning clean technology in a place that needs it so much is mind boggling."
taiwan,30vf2m,Tyr808,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:50:18 2015 UTC,"Apparently the e-bike ban has its roots in previous bans on motorcycles (see E-bike Wiki #China) in city centers.  Basically, after the motorcycle ban, everyone switched over to e-bikes, and then they banned those too.  I guess the government could allow them and do things like increase policing, add bicycle / scooter lanes, require licenses, helmets and noisemakers.  But there's an upfront cost for all that...  In my opinion, the cities would benefit a lot by taking the time to set up such systems, and bicycles deserve the road more than private cars in congested cities.  Anyway, not being a Chinese speaker myself, it's hard to know what direction they're moving in.  A quick perusal of English sources indicates some cities have some bike lanes, and some do require licenses for e-bikes.  They are allowed in certain areas of Shenzhen and are not banned in every city.  If you visit China you'll probably see a ton of e-bikes.  Not many wear helmets, unfortunately."

taiwan,30vf2m,ShrimpCrackers,6,Tue Mar 31 06:53:29 2015 UTC,"Gogoro did not reveal how much Smartscooters will cost.   I have a feeling it's gonna be much more expensive than a normal (or a second-hand) scooter. Don't forget vehicles are very important to keep the face here in Taiwan. Therefore, when you're poor you have a crappy scooter and as soon as you can, you upgrade to a shiny Lexus to show more face. So I think people will still prefer to invest into a shiny car rather than an electric scooter.   Taiwanese people are used to riding scooters and are also especially open to trying new products   That's very true. Maybe they will line up in front of Gogoro's store for the first three weeks, like when Krispy Kream and H&M open up? But after that they won't give a shit, really.   there is a focus on making cities cleaner and finding smarter energy sources   Really?! I stopped counting the scooters emitting thick black smoke (and the cops don't  do nothin', of course)"
taiwan,30vf2m,laopi,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:46:49 2015 UTC,"As for expense, quite a few ideas have been pushed forth, including a loaner or rental system. Personally I'd get one because they're really neat in person, customizable sounds and a drivetrain that is so elegant and compact.   Really?! I stopped counting the scooters emitting thick black smoke (and the cops don't do nothin', of course)   A lot of things can cause that momentarily and the cops are not mechanics. The big thing is the 50cc scooters that emit a cloud of smoke cannot easily pass the emissions test and will eventually fail and be forced to retire. Insurance companies certainly cannot insure a scooter that doesn't pass inspection."

The only policies with which I'm familiar:   the plan to move the railway station underground. But that hasn't really happened yet. the plan to clear out the arcades (騎樓) in central Tainan so that pedestrians can actually walk through the city. But again that hasn't really happened. Shops continue to build out stuff into the street. The sidewalks are completely unnavigable for disabled people.   When I ask my friends in Tainan why they like him, they all say things like ""he understands ordinary people"". But when I ask them about specific policies, they are generally unable to answer. Perhaps I'm just asking the wrong people.  I'm genuinely interested to hear about his real policies!"
taiwan,30wm84,lostalien,2,Wed Apr 1 02:28:07 2015 UTC,"Actually I've been down there a few times (mostly recently summer 2014), from my first hand perspective, even lived there for two weeks, but not long time resident so I can only give you some brief impressions.   English signs are everywhere now. I remember six years ago there were basic ones for streets mostly, but its mindboggling how they're everywhere, even in correct grammar. Apparently Lai is trying to promote English strongly (not just him of course) and he eventually wants questions to be asked in English in the city council.  Bus lanes are way better. Apparently before his ""MRT bus policy"" only under a percent of people in Tainan actually took the buses, according to him apparently he's managed to increase this four fold, though traffic is still a major issue in Tainan, probably because its more spread out then say Taipei. I've actually ridden on the buses and I can say they've improved. I dunno if they'll establish a subway metro line there since Tainan is not as populated as Taipei or Kaohsiung.   The city government seems to be promoting the cultural side of their city, understandable considering the history of Tainan, I can say from experience there's cultural parks and historical sites everywhere now. Tainan is definitely the cultural capital of Taiwan.  Lai was apparently highest for integrity in the recent mayor poll and like you said ""he understands ordinary people"", you get that response a lot I agree. Maybe Lai interacts with his residents more, who knows. I think he was a doctor before he became mayor, so maybe people cite that."

I was just listing the improvements while I was down there. Probably there were other factors I didn't notice, I don't live there. But I do live in Taichung.   Hu lost because of a number of factors, otherwise why would the voters vote him out if you thought he did a great job? The BRT was a fail, your cultural hot spots you mentioned like the Opera house were all hurriedly built which opened him up to an attack by the opposition, not to mention Hu made himself unpopular by closing those bars, and several high profile criminal incidents created the impression that Hu was ignoring organized crime or collaborating with them (well, its Taichung, who isn't collaborating with organized crime?). I do think the biggest reason Hu lost was he was there for too long, the DPP candidate was campaigning on CHANGE and apparently voters like that.

taiwan,30sfvu,Phos_,5,Mon Mar 30 10:10:54 2015 UTC,"One's JFRV ARC is, indeed, linked to their marriage. So, if that marriage is dissolved, the ARC becomes invalid because your reason for being in the country is no longer valid. The APRC allows one to reside in Taiwan without being the appendage of a company, spouse, religion, etc.   Honestly, I'd go ahead and apply for the APRC; it just makes life somewhat easier. For example, if one wants to get a credit card, banks can look at the APRC as an indication that someone won't ""run"" and be more inclined to grant you one (a lot of money in the bank also helps)."
taiwan,30sfvu,Get9,3,Mon Mar 30 11:42:53 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, if you wife divorces you, your marital ARC (not sure it's the right term) gets cancelled.    I have Taiwanese friend who just divorced her husband. Once the divorce papers were signed and delivered to the government, the husband had to leave the country within 10 days. (I'm not sure if that's accurate, but that's what she told me)."
taiwan,30sfvu,vigernere1,3,Mon Mar 30 13:04:36 2015 UTC,"Should be around two or three weeks, not ten days, but it's basically correct.  When dealing with a work ARC, you can get extensions if you talk to the visa office. In this case, you tell them you are working on getting job, but haven't signed the contract yet, or if you provide them with a copy of the paperwork showing your work permit was applied for.  With the JFRV ARC, however, it's not really possible to get that extension unless you're getting married right after your divorce. Even then, your other paperwork better be ready because a lot of it takes weeks to get back.  With that in mind, I'm not sure how lenient the NIA would be with someone who is divorcing rather than trying to work.  So, your Taiwanese friend was probably fairly accurate in her portrayal of the situation (or, at least in that part)."
taiwan,30sfvu,Get9,3,Mon Mar 30 14:08:24 2015 UTC,"There are advantages to the APRC that ARCs just don't have.    (this one seemingly doesn't apply to you) You're not tied to an employer or organization You're not tied to another person (JFRV) I don't know about JFRVs, but on APRCs you can leave the island for up to six months (more if you apply to the government) Banks tend to hassle you less about things because your APRC doesn't expire (you do have to update pictures, but it's not expired and no reapplication; it's an ID that you renew every ten years, in this sense). As such, it's sometimes easier to get things like credit cards."
taiwan,30sfvu,Get9,2,Mon Mar 30 14:15:23 2015 UTC,"Since the Plum Blossom APRC is free, and APRCs have no expiration, I don't see any reason not to.  IIRC, the marriage ARC has to be renewed every 3 years and costs NT4000?"
taiwan,30sfvu,kikichun,1 point,Tue Mar 31 02:14:36 2015 UTC,Well you will need to reapply and do a bunch of paperwork vs. just renew your marriage arc every 1/3 years.

Further up Fuxing Road there are lots of intercity bus stops, for leaving Taoyuan. Taoyuan HSR station holds much promise of leaving Taoyuan very quickly but it's actually quite far out of the city, (I think more than halfway to the airport, which is another good way to leave Taoyuan).  The main route to (New) Taipei by scooter would be Wanshou Road, which thankfully is a relatively pleasant drive by Taiwan standards. If you have a car, there's Freeway 1, which is another popular method of leaving Taoyuan.

I've found that for me the best way to do it is to put away your Canadian dollars and just go to an ATM (e.g. at 7-11) and take out a large amount at once in order to dilute the ATM fee."
taiwan,30j9ne,dorylinus,4,Sat Mar 28 02:10:41 2015 UTC,"I have not exchanged money myself in the Taoyuan airport, but according to the info I found online, there's a flat fee NT$100. The counter is operated by Bank of Taiwan so the rate should be the same. I hope someone could confirm if the rate is the same as their website."
taiwan,30j9ne,poorman99,2,Sat Mar 28 04:49:13 2015 UTC,"We recently exchanged money at TPE airport.    There is a flat fee, and they do have a slight margin.  However, compare to the rates I was googling up, it costed me like $4 USD to do the exchange there, which was a lot less than people have been posting (2-3%).  So there was no reason not to do the exchange ther IF you are carrying cash, and you are exchanging at least $1000 USD.  They do demand clean notes, and either not accept or charge additional fees for older bills.  A no Foreign exchange fee, no ATM fee, ATM card like the Schwab card would be the most ideal if you go with the ATM route."
taiwan,30j9ne,LumpyLump76,2,Sat Mar 28 15:48:39 2015 UTC,Actually this is not true with Taiwan and the bank rates are relatively okay too. I just did an exchange not 1 month ago and the rates were very fair.

I can certainly see the awful white lights used everywhere as damaging to your eyes. If I taught too long without leaving the classroom, I would get terrible headaches. On weekends, when I would either be home with my yellow/orange-tinted lights or outside hiking, my headaches were nonexistent.  Given that, I completely see how detrimental the use of white, fluorescent tubes everywhere could be.

Of course, it was that concentration that led to many of my professional successes which probably negates the concern in US authors - if it's wealth for ""us"" the sacrifice is noble - it's it wealth for ""them"" it's a crime.

You had to go drill some more. After school you would train until 9pm because becoming a pro athlete was the only thing that mattered.

Coincidentally, my parents were the first generation to pass high school, and my generation was when computers became a thing. You're telling me somehow my parents contracted the myopia gene while none of their ancestors have ever had myopia? This goes for all my cousins as well. My cousin, let's call him Jeff, works in IT, game design to be exact, and requires myopia correction lenses. His sister does not have myopia. Neither parents have myopia.

For easy access to the top of a hill, 小草山 (Xiaocao Mountain) is to the east, but it's not as dark as the other two.  For a fun night hike, go to the main peak of 七星山 (Qixing Mountain).

Many activities are made really expensive/impossible due to a lack of free space around the island, but it doesn't cost much to go grab some random food at a food stand.  I compare my childhood to that of your average Taiwanese, and mine was much richer because I could go golfing, pick apples, ride a horse, or play ball with my friends for basically zero money.  Most of these would be expensive as fuck for a highschooler in Taiwan, or just hard to arrange."

I guess if you do a one-off or something it's relatively inexpensive.

They'll all run up to about 1/4 of the field. Then pop out of cover for a few seconds shoot and then go back behind. There are no tactics, no flanking. It's almost just target shooting.

He was speeding down the wrong way of this one-way narrow lane, against plenty of traffic.

I held my breath as I thought I was certainly dead mere hours after landing (the road was empty though so we were fine).  To top it all off, about 100 meters down the highway from this whole debacle the cops had set up a drunk driving checkpoint (I still have never seen another one again, supposedly it was reactionary to a recent news story).  It completely looked like my GF's stepdad was drunk trying to avoid the checkpoint by trying to drive the wrong way down a highway at 3AM.    Eventually his senses came to him and he did another U-turn back and approached the checkpoint.  We drove through and the two policemen were laughing at probably something unrelated, waved at us, and we passed through without even being questioned.  In America I think we might have been murdered by cop for that stunt, at the very least my GF's stepdad would have been fined heavily and spent a bunch of days down at the courthouse.

One time it was my doctor who recognized me, the other time a guy was on his phone and stopped.  2 times I could remember out of thousands of experiences.

They will leave false bad reviews for good businesses, and good reviews for generally bad businesses.  Marketing agencies pay people to write good/bad reviews, you can't trust it at all.  Yelp itself doesn't treat these equally anyway.  Good reviews are often deleted without telling the poster for no given reason, and bad reviews really stick.  Yelp just manipulates them in order to increase traffic and earn money from advertisers (which was deemed legal in U.S. courts), and once it gains widespread use, it can really hurt small businesses."

However, I want to point out that what TripAdvisor does, (as described by the OP) while not nice doesn't nearly approach what yelp does (which I classify as fraud and extortion).  TripAdvisor lists by availability, and they only know availability if you are listed on a partner OTA.  Not a nice trick, but they aren't actually removing good reviews, or adding bad ones like Yelp has been accused of doing.    I can also re-sort the list by ranking (which as far as I have heard, hasn't been tampered with).  There is no way, on Yelp, to re-sort and deal with reviews that were removed, or fraudulently added.  I think of it like this.  Say I am on a dating site.  TripAdvisor seems to be sorting potential matches based on whether they are signed up for an extra service on a different site.  You can resort if you want.  Yelp, if you don't pay, is photoshopping pimples on your face and adding reviews saying that you have herpes.  If you do pay, they fix up your teeth and add reviews about how funny your stories are."

taiwan,30chmp,Monkeyfeng,4,Thu Mar 26 08:45:22 2015 UTC,"iPeen 愛評 is basically the Taiwanese Yelp. They also have an extremely cluttered website, but there is an app available for Androids and iPhones. It should be noted that the same problems that exist for Yelp (vote manipulation, pay-for-exposure, review shadiness, etc.) exist here. Also, it is only in Chinese.  If you don't want the potential voting/rating nonsense of Yelp-esque things (and I don't know how much of that goes on with iPeen).  Fon Food 瘋美食 is kind of what you are looking for, but they don't have an app, and, again, it's only in Chinese.  If you like Fon Food, though, then you can use Fooru 美食俘虜, which is a similar iPhone app."
taiwan,30chmp,Get9,5,Thu Mar 26 12:35:02 2015 UTC,Taiwanese marketing is literally all about vote manipulation (if possible). That and giving away iPhone 6's (raffle) in exchange for your contact info so they can spam you.

Landlords are responsible unless noted otherwise in the lease. If the landlord is responsible but refuses to fix it, after the renter has notified the landlord officially, he has the right to a) terminate the lease; b) fix the problem and deduct the cost from the rent."
taiwan,30av9s,poorman99,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:29:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the response. I'll have to go over the lease carefully and see what's spelled out, but are you certain about the default situation placing the obligation on the landlord? This would be very helpful."
taiwan,30av9s,Get9,4,Wed Mar 25 23:57:50 2015 UTC,"/u/poorman99 is definitely right, here. In the article he linked, which quotes the Civil Code Laws and Legislation, it says this:  民法第429條  租賃物之修繕,除契約另有訂定或另有習慣外,由出租人負擔。 出租人為保存租賃物所為之必要行為,承租人不得拒絕。  which means this:  Unless otherwise provided by the contract or customs, the lessor shall make all repairs to the thing leased. The lessee shall not refuse the lessor to do such actions as are necessary for the maintenance of the thing leased.  Here is an English version of the Civil Laws. Relevant articles to you would be around 429-440.  Like I said, make sure you read your lease and see what it says. If there is nothing about putting repair responsibility or cost on you, then your landlord is obliged to do it.   Sorry if I scared you with my initial comment; it turns out there is something for you, there! Hope the English version helps!"

taiwan,30av9s,cheesetease1,2,Thu Mar 26 00:13:37 2015 UTC,"I guess the first question that needs to be answered is: What are the terms set out by the lease? Does it say anything about landlords fixing things? I ask because I usually make sure my leases say something about it before I sign them, because landlords can sometimes be shady people (well, there're shady people in all walks of life, I guess).  I am not terrifically versed in all Taiwanese law, but I've never been able to find something close to a ""tenants rights act"" that lays all of this out.   If your lease says something about a landlord being responsible for upkeep and he isn't doing it, you could probably take it to small claims court, and at the very least would be able to break your lease without recourse. Even if he fixes it for you now, I would guess that he'd take it out of your security deposit (given his attitude). Did you take pictures of everything prior to moving in?  What kind of breaks/problems are we talking, here?"

It is not well-known, but the then leader of the Taiwanese militia, Qiu Fengjia, declared Taiwanese independence, and later aided Sun's revolutionary forces several times.

The entire idea started and created by the government, land space made available by the government, paid for by the government, bid for by only two 'private' corporations created with controls in large part by the government, with a promise of supposed zero net cost after profits.

taiwan,306ey1,belmakias,5,Tue Mar 24 21:19:19 2015 UTC,"Copying my comment over for discussion:   Taiwanese entertainment got it's start early as a result of its earlier economic development. Because of the Nationalist government, Taiwan kept its language as Mandarin. After the communist takeover, the pop entertainment industry (which was basically only in Shanghai) mostly moved to Hong Kong. Some went to Taiwan. In fact, HK had some early pop hits in the 50's. However, due to the dominance of Cantonese in Hong Kong, the pop music industry shifted toward cantopop. Taiwan's industry stayed with mandopop. Obviously, Mandopop is more palatable to Mainlanders.  Due to Taiwan ending its martial law, the entertainment industry was able to grow itself without as much government interference. Even today, if you look at movies, movies from the mainland consist of many party propaganda and historical epics. Taiwanese movies on the other hand, needs to appeal to the masses.    So these are the main reasons. If you look at the strong sectors of Taiwanese entertainment, they're good at making 1) Pop music, 2) urban romance TV drama, 3) Chinese fictions, 4) non fictions. They're weaker in things that require more expensive investment, such as feature films."
taiwan,306ey1,JillyPolla,3,Tue Mar 24 22:22:56 2015 UTC,"The film industry shifted from Shanghai to Hong Kong during WW2. But in the late 90s, the Hong Kong entertainment industry 'collapsed', also coinciding with Hong Kong's handover to China (along with Anita Mui and Leslie Cheung's deaths, Faye Wong's retirement, and renowned HK directors working in Hollywood etc)... then Taiwanese singers had the opportunity to rise, not to mention they sing mostly in Mandarin. People like Jay Chou, A-Mei, Wang Leehom became huge stars. Even singers from Singapore and Malaysia came to Taipei to develop their careers (JJ Lin, Gary Chow, Stefanie Sun).  As for Taiwanese drama and acting, it was only luck that Taiwan had one of the first ""modern"" drama crazes. Yes I'm talking about F4 and Meteor Garden. I think for a while Taiwanese drama could've competed in popularity with Korean ones, but unfortunately producers/government did not capitalize on that. But although Taiwanese drama was successful, Taiwanese film industry never picked up. 2008's Cape No 7 is considered revival of the Taiwanese box office so we'll see how our national cinema develops. I'm quite fond of Taiwanese New Wave cinema actually, but that's kind of another thing.  As for Chinese cinema, one of the heights was during the Fifth Generation (in the 80s and early 90s), like when Zhang Yimou did all his main collabs with Gong Li. The Sixth Generation of filmmakers (low budget films) came after the 00s as well as the era of Chinese blockbusters which stars Taiwanese formerly-'idol' actors, such as Eddie Peng and Chen Bolin, and actors like Shu Qi and Chang Chen.   So basically I agree with JillyPolla. Taiwanese entertainment achieved success esp in the 00s because of earlier economic development and the loss of Hong Kong entertainment industry at the time. Now Hong Kong film seems like it's doing well again with HK-Mainland co-productions and the use of international casts (Dante Lam, Johnnie To are popular, Angelababy lol)  Sorry this is really disorganized."

But there are little water stations everywhere. Brushing teeth etc is fine though, just don't drink it Depending on where you are, the Taiwanese toilets can not flush paper. In such cases, put your paper into the trashcan In Taiwan, you hear multiple languages. Majority of people will speak Mandarin Chinese. But be aware that they might actually speak Taiwanese or Hakka or another language natively. Try to learn Chinese, even if you're only here for a year. It's incredibly useful Don't be afraid to try stuff in the night market. But if you really don't want to, it's okay to say no. The majority of houses and apartments do not have kitchens (at least the one's for students). If you're hungry, just go out nd eat in one of the million restaurants on every corner. You should get a normal meal for for 100 NTD (might vary depending on your area) When you buy stuff, you will get a receipt. Take it with you, because every single receipt has a number on them that is used as a lottery especially if you look white and go to a more rural area (I went to Chiayi): people will look and state at you. They don't mean it unfriendly, it's usually because you might be the first white person they see except the ones on TV be friendly, as they will be friendly to you Taiwanese people don't usually know Hanyu Pinyin. For ""typing"" Chinese characters, they use Bopomofo (Zhuyin) because they are not used to Pinyin, some road signs or city names will have several ways to write them in Latin alphabet. (I was looking for a street once but couldn't find it, because it was written differently in my paper) If possible, print you destinations address on a piece of paper (in Chinese characters) so you can show the address to people in case you get lost *Have fun"

taiwan,3059cs,tomtam6,5,Tue Mar 24 16:22:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to encourage you to go about your foray into Taiwanese scooter riding by scootering to Keelung or Yilan, but, in my opinion, it's worthwhile.  I've made that trip a few times, but I must note:  1) I've never taken the missus with me on the back (farthest we went on a scooter was Yehliu)  2) My first time going to Yilan this way was a few months after purchasing and getting familiar with my vehicle  I do believe that scootering (or cycling) long distances gives you a different perspective on Taiwan, especially since you can stop and go wherever you please. In that way, I absolutely believe that it makes sense to use a scooter to travel to such places, with pre-planning your route (and there are many routes to those two destinations) being a must.  That being said, if this is your first time navigating Taiwan, I just wouldn't do it. Getting from here to there can be tricky, especially making it from Keelung to Rueifang on your way to Yilan (well, if you were to go the northern route).  I'm not sure why /u/poorman99 said there are a lot of dump trucks along the northern coast (can you elaborate?), because I frequently traveled that path with no ""dump truck"" trouble. Not trying to be argumentative, I'm just wondering if things have changed in the less-than-a-year that I've been away. (By the way, you're about right...takes between 2.5~3.5 hours, depending on traffic and weather.)  tl;dr: It's worth it, but inadvisable to make the trip on a scooter when you haven't been driving in Taiwan and it's such a brief period of time."
taiwan,3059cs,Get9,1 point,Tue Mar 24 23:25:20 2015 UTC,"I have to admit that I haven't done this for a while (last time was in college), but if I recall correctly, dump trucks from east coast (Yilan/Hualien) are not allowed to use highway no. 5 nor Beiyi road to go to Taipei. That basically means they have to go through the coastal line. It's pretty common for the dump trucks to connect at the beginning of no. 1 highway in Keelung. Now, it's possible that there are some new  shortcuts for them to bypass Keelung (I can see a route connecting Fulong and Xizhi (Province No. 2c) ). Even so, I think you should be able to see some dump trucks driving by when riding a scooter between Fulong and Yilan. I had a really bad experience on a windy rainy day there as I was honked and splashed all the way..."
taiwan,3059cs,poorman99,2,Wed Mar 25 00:07:09 2015 UTC,"I've seen dump trucks, though I figured you meant an excessive amount. They were generally easy to pass and didn't cause issues for me. Thanks for the explanation."

taiwan,3059cs,poorman99,1 point,Tue Mar 24 17:20:56 2015 UTC,That's what I had thought. I'll need to look into our itinerary and see if it fits in anywhere of our travels outside of public transport. Thanks for verifying.
taiwan,307m8x,BigOrbitalStrike,12,Wed Mar 25 02:52:50 2015 UTC,"The reality is that neither the DPP nor the KMT have clear cut Taiwan/China policies that have been fully accepted or understood by the Taiwanese people. The KMT's one-China policy based on both sides respecting each other's interpretation of the definition of ""China"" is but a mythical consensus and a fatal fallacy. Does any Taiwanese truly believe that Beijing accepts that the ROC and PRC coexist in a geographical, cultural and historical ""one China"" both as sovereign and non-subordinate entities? No, there is no genuine room for interpretation in the mind of Beijing as the Communists will always insist that Taiwan is but a mere subordinate province of the PRC.  Now, it is also definitely true that the independence-leaning DPP does not have a clear Taiwan/China policy as well. What we do know is that the aggressive and confrontational independence route has already been proven impossible under Chen Sui-bian, at least for the foreseeable future. Perhaps when more time has passed and a firmer Taiwanese identity consensus has taken hold, paired with a more belligerent China...there would be a stronger majority push for independence. But for now, the maintenance of the status quo with a peek towards independence is the most likely option.   The DPP is likely to walk the middle ground of status quo from now until the 2016 Presidential election. I know you want the DPP to throw out a clear cut Cross Strait Policy now, but I don't see them providing one until they win the race. But if the DPP were to win the upcoming Presidential election, it would likely mean the country begins to lean towards independence, if only step by step."
taiwan,307m8x,FormosaNation,16,Wed Mar 25 05:02:17 2015 UTC,"I'm up-voting this because some of the responses are good, not because this loaded question has any merit. (""DPP Mayor KP""? Give me a break, Big Orbital Spin.)"
taiwan,307m8x,x3nomik,5,Wed Mar 25 06:33:29 2015 UTC,"There's actually only one material difference between KMT & DPP's cross strait policies: KMT is willing to continue the talk even if Taiwan is denounced as a special region of China, and DPP is not willing. DPP's position today is no different than KMT's position back in 1992 when 1992 consensus was forged: there was no consensus, but let's put this aside and try to work together.  However, one has to ask himself, what if the other side doesn't really put the argument aside but just put their own version as the presumption for everything? KMT officials will tell you that's not an issue at all as long as we can make money in the next 4 years. No deal could be done if we don't bend our knee so let's do it. DPP officials will act like any normal diplomats with basic dignity to ask the other side to show basic respect and negotiate. Like I said, that's the only material difference. DPP will try to talk with China and increase the level of trust and cooperation, just like KMT will do. And hopefully, it will leave less loopholes than KMT does for its own interest. Just look at how KMT majors negotiated their contracts for BOT projects in Taipei, do you think they really care about the ""public interest""?"
taiwan,307m8x,poorman99,9,Wed Mar 25 04:48:30 2015 UTC,"Well, Taiwanese independence is a pillar of DPP policies (台獨黨綱), so essentially the existence of DPP is entirely at odds with China's policy of eventual unification.  Rather than asking what the DPP's cross strait policies are, it's more an issue of how far can DPP push its independence agenda, with China watching closely; and whether that will win them the next election, which is what a party is all about. Unless Taiwan as a whole leans toward independence significantly, I can't see the DPP coming out with an aggressive independence policy -- that simply does not serve the DPP's best interest in catering towards the ""status quo"" middle ground, which is ultimately necessary for winning an election.  If, one day, the DPP could win without being ambiguous about their cross strait policies, you'll see one. :D"
taiwan,307m8x,Roygbiv0415,3,Wed Mar 25 03:57:51 2015 UTC,"That's what most people would think. Truth is, just about as many DPP politicians have businesses or special interests in mainland China as the KMT. They are now really a shadow of its former self. You may think that they want complete independence, but what they really want is maintaining the status quo so they can extract as much profit as possible from their businesses in China and still appearing sticking to their core ideology to the masses."
taiwan,307m8x,Rhinexheart,0,Wed Mar 25 08:02:04 2015 UTC,"Another interesting issue is the general Taiwan policy of the State Department seems changed radically during Obama administration. I've read those books written by Richard C. Bush. If my memory is correct, in Untying the Knot (2006) he tried to explain the negotiation requirement China raised (basically the PRC version of One-China) are nearly unacceptable by both ROC government and Taiwanese people; however, in The Perils of Proximity (2010) he acclaimed President Ma (and China) for developing negotiation while both side keeps silent for what requirement they've offered/accepted."
taiwan,307m8x,PotbellyPanda,6,Wed Mar 25 06:40:53 2015 UTC,Former U.S. ambassador to Taiwan Barbara Schrage asked this very question during the Heritage Foundation conference but was immediately denounced by DPP members in the audience. She was effectively told to shut up. DPP later went on the offensive by saying the former ambassadors comments do not reflect the official line of thinking in D.C.   This is one of the lulziest things ever.  The DPP and KMT constantly have to dance around obvious truths.
taiwan,307m8x,just_face,1 point,Wed Mar 25 04:39:05 2015 UTC,"DPP cross strait policies are complicated as its a fine line between winning elections and keeping your base happy. (  An issue that the KMT will have too )   Its all going to be status quo publicly on both sides with the DPP angling for independence and the KMT for unification.  same is it always is-  ""The ROC Constitution governs Taiwan, the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) governs China. According to the ROC Constitution, Taiwan and China have a special relationship in that Taiwan is governed by the ROC and China is not. However, Taiwan and China are equally autonomous states and neither is a part of the other.""  from a editorial called how to fix DPP cross strait issue I don't buy into it but he has a point.  As you said  ""If you 'rock the boat' you will lose"" something that the KMT just found out."

OP majored in law. Depending on his law degree and experience he wishes to gain, he might do very well. There are tax avoidance companies that will hire him right off the bat for well over 70-80k/mo in Taoyuan for example if he happens to have knowledge (or simply be able to find them) in the right fields.

One can shit on Taiwanese business culture but I've seen so many so unbelievably lax compared to New York City where I grew up with people trying hard to train you. Back home in NYC it was a rat race, while in Taiwan it was relaxed. My first job in Taiwan was 60k/mo doing 9:30-5:30 with two hours for lunch + ""whatever"" breaks along with a daily mindless 20-40 minute meeting where I'd just have to sit there and look important while day dreaming. I mean look me right now, I'm pulling in far far more than that and I'm on Reddit all day with Popcorn Time on a secondary display. But I'm one of those luckier ones.

As usually happens in most countries, however, there will be a cusp where to be very last minute people will still have to do service (until they don't on the specific date).  What's the point of a specific date for a change-over if you don't actually use it?  Just change it 'effective immediately' otherwise.  How will it affect ""dodging""?  Hard to say.  It sort of depends on the laws that were enacted to make the switch (probably in Mandarin so I'm not up to that interpretive challenged).    For things ""left unsaid"", it depends on how the legal system works - Taiwan is a civil law system so likely the default will be that dodgers are still obligated eve after that date - that's just how civil law usually works.  Common law errs on the other direction (which is why the US is as crazy/fucked-up/etc. as it is - a good and bad thing).  The ""big picture"" of Civil vs. Common law systems:  Civil Law: all things are banned except for those specifically enabled by law  Common Law: all things are allowed except for those specifically banned by law  Common law is practiced in the US, UK and commonwealth countries generally while Civil law is everywhere else."

The average salary for college graduates in Taiwan is not much over NT$25,000 per month, so especially in Taipei the likelihood of dating anyone who technically ""earns enough money to support herself"" is quite low.  However, it seems like your question is really regarding a specific person whom you are dating.  What does the general culture in Taiwan with regard to dating have to do with a specific individual?

While Lee Kuan Yew should be credited for his achievements, it's highly debateable whether the once-pro-democracy politician shouldn't have liberalized in the last 15 years. There are people that say the Singaporeans are not capable for really ruling themselves and need an authoritarian state to prosper, but I personally find that insulting if not racist.  Once Lee Kuan Yew came into power, instead of liberalizing, he has installed his own relatives into power and made them grossly rich."

taiwan,301huq,piggybackshaw,6,Mon Mar 23 18:48:28 2015 UTC,"Tell you what I did.  Came back to Taiwan in 2012 after college in the US when i was 23 and applied for the Substitute Army Service (替代役) January of the same year, specifically selecting to be enlisted the following year. You have a choice of selecting to serve during the same year of your application or the next. The application requires you to have specific physical disabilities, special skills, or family needs eg. only child and sick father who needs care etc. Any one of the above would qualify you for the application. There are numerous divisions and departments of the Taiwanese government that you can apply for, eg. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Culture etc. Note that getting admitted into these departments depends on your skills that you have to list in your application. This service is 3 months longer than the national army requirements as it's ""easier"", so I served 1 year & 2 months without deducting any other local army cadet schooling.   In my case, having an undergraduate degree from the US qualifies as a language skill automatically. So naturally I applied to be in the Ministry of Education and be an English teacher. Note that if you have a business degree or international relations degree you could just as easily get into the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This is the summary of my process:   Apply online, wait for a letter saying you have been admitted and qualify for your department.  Go to your neighborhood 區公所 on a designated date to be drafted into the national army (Military, Navy, Airforce). This draft is for the national army and is required, you are legally required to be drafted once but you can opt out because you already have an alternative. However, this draft's benefit is that it allows you to serve in the army earlier than your Substitute service's start date, meaning you can start earlier and end earlier.  Sub service boot camp for 3 weeks in Taichung, then you are sent off to your department's bootcamp across the country (Education is in Kaoshiung). 2 more weeks of special training there. Then based on your grades in Taichung and Kaoshiung bootcamp, you get to pick your school of choice to serve at. Boot camp consists of running in the mornings, useless classes about things I can't even remember, lots of sweeping leaves and debris, cleaning toilets, standing guard at night, team exercises, running around in formation and singing army songs, lots of bed sheet folding, and learning how to fall into formation.  Then you serve in your school of choice for the remaining duration of your service. Every school is different, but you get the pleasure of leaving your post a few hours a day as most schools dont really care what you do with your free time as long as you dont get into trouble. So the benefit of this service is that you aren't confined to one place for the entire week. You get weekends off starting end of Friday to Sunday night where you have to report back to your post.    Overall the sub army is only beneficial if you make the most out of your time. You will get a lot of down time during your service so some people pick up part time jobs (illegal because you are an army personnel) or learn new skills. What I did was start working out and learning Chinese through books during my free time.   If you cant read or write, which was the same as me before I went in, I attended Mandarin classes during the year before my service so I wouldn't have such a hard time during service. Places such as Shi Da University provide decent Mandarin classes that are offered by 3 month semesters and can be catered to your specific need of reading and writing.   Army service would not help you in terms of getting a better job in the US, the only thing I can think of that could be beneficial is that you coming back to visit long term would not be a problem. To be honest, the main reason people actually complete their duties is only because they are moving back permanently or have to stay in Taiwan for long durations and cant afford the visa runs. If you don't fall into the above and plan to live and work in the US long term, don't bother coming back to complete your service.   Hope this helps."

With the exception of only a very select few individuals or very specific circles, everyone else says its a waste of time. You'll learn far more at a public-entry boot camp in the USA in a month (being generous here) than you do the entire time in Taiwan's draft.  One of my pals was a captain in the ROC military, fast-tracked there by means of long-standing party membership. That puts him at the top of the junior officer tier. His highlight? Being ordered to Illegally remove Chen Shui Bian campaign posters before the 2000 election and stealing construction material from a nearby site for the base. Not exactly amazing.

The US army has much more actual training and far less meaningless BS, but other than that it's the same: being yelled at, bullied/pranked, punished for no reason, following unnecessary formality, etc.   Military service can feel enlightening because, like survival and camping, it push you to your limits. You may get better appreciation of life and freedom, gain better self-control, or rethink the meaning of life, but I doubt there's anything I can't learn from elsewhere."

taiwan,301huq,ShrimpCrackers,2,Tue Mar 24 06:40:18 2015 UTC,"Typically you would go through a month of bootcamp training, in which you will learn how to follow the order. This means getting rid of yourself and follow whatever order they give you, including how to tie your shoes and fold the bed sheet like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AND4ZO6kAk .You will realize your life could be simplified to just half a locker of belongings. And KFC is THE best food in the world.   After that, they will assign you a unit based on a lottery. If you don't wear glasses, it's very likely you will be assigned to a MP unit and become a sentry somewhere important. Otherwise, there's a 50% chance you will be sent to Kinmen or Matsu island to serve. Different units have different trainings, but they also share the same basic duties: maintaining equipments, learning and training, or making endless reports. Since you cannot read Chinese, you probably cannot make the reports, but don't worry there are things for people who can't read.... like re-paint all the tanks or walls or trees or whatever they want to paint...  Most parts are pretty boring, and sometimes it's pretty sad to be yielded by a private with only high school degree. If you survive, you will probably be ok with any insult in real life :)"
taiwan,301huq,poorman99,4,Tue Mar 24 00:20:57 2015 UTC,"I have a Taiwanese born Canadian friend, about 24 now, the brother of a famous singer in Taiwan. He can speak but can't read or write Chinese. He did a year of service and became airborne qualified (5 jumps). He had some good experiences and made some lifelong friends. He can now put on his resume that he was a Corporal in an Airborne Infantry unit, which takes discipline, leadership skills, and it shows that his leadership trusted him to lead other men. If I was hiring for any position, I would place high value on someone who led other soldiers in an infantry platoon."
taiwan,301huq,Tyberos,2,Mon Mar 23 19:15:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying OP should draft dodge. He should just go for it. That said...   He can now put on his resume that he was a Corporal in an Airborne Infantry unit...   The caveat is that he was an ROC Corporal and the ROC is not exactly renowned because:   Everyone gets drafted so it's not really special. Most people in Taiwan call it a waste of time. It's easy to become fast-tracked into the junior officer tier by political means or guanxi. (Your Canadian friend may have had also since he is the brother of someone famous, but then again your Canadian friend only made it one step above a Private tier.) Most draftees will never make it into a position of leadership at all. So while your Canadian corporal friend worked his butt off, many of those above him did not, which mars everything. Plus OP is not joining to be an officer. The equipment draftees deal with is abysmal, and they rarely practice.    I would place high value on someone who led other soldiers in an infantry platoon.   But this is not applicable to OP given what he stated. He doesn't qualify. I don't see any benefits (nor cons except wasted time) for OP if he chooses to continue his life in the USA after this draft.  Plus if OP is even heavy set or too skinny, especially since he grew up in America, and with the recent change in standards in BMI and other health requirements, he may only qualify for alternative draft service in which he'll get a desk job or something else. If he even touches  ""overweight"" by American BMI standards (31), he doesn't even qualify for the Taiwan draft. If he's lucky, he might do some English work in a big city with weekends off, if he's unlucky he may act as guard for a mental ward."

According to people who came out of the new training program, the 4 months will be divided into 2 months boot camp and 2 months specialization training.  Boot camp is pretty much the same as before except longer, but they still cram most of the stuff into the first month. Things like learning archaic infantry tactics off by heart, rifle assembly and disassembly, bayonet training, grenade throw, etc. You'll have a tight schedule but if you have been doing sports you'll get used to it pretty soon. Only people who's been slacking on exercising will get their asses handed to them in the first 2 weeks.  You get like 2 days vacation out of the first month, that's just tradition. In the second month however, since everything that needs to be done are done, it becomes very relaxed and you even get early vacations if your company don't make big mistakes during training.  Then you will draw for specialization, for example for artillery training, or for armor, or for engineering, or for driving training, etc. There may be considerations to have you only draw from units that are close to your household registration address, but that's not guaranteed.  Specialization training is even lighter than boot camp because you'll be trained by school units, get weekends off, and you shouldn't even have sentry duty.  All in all it'll be like a slightly longer summer camp.  Not being able to write Chinese will have no effect because they'll just tell your squad members to help out. You'll still do fine as a rifleman. You just need to know that for the units responsible for training, they just want to get you past training with no incidents, that's all they ask for, they are not there to actually ""train"" you. They are there to create the illusion that you have been trained.  How much it helps your future life depends on how much you take away from it. If you go in with a negative attitude thinking there's nothing you can learn, you will learn nothing. If you go in with an open attitude and learn, you'll find little things that might or might not be of use to you later on."

That means nukes, icbms, drones, naval bombardment, oil embargoes, maybe even chemical weapons. This is not WW2. The truth is that an actual invasion using force of arms would obliterate any potential usefulness Taiwan would serve after unifying with China.

""The USA wouldn't defend Taiwan (and in effect is no longer interested in maintaining any real presence in East Asia) and I know this without any historical or current precedent because I just do."""
taiwan,302qfx,ShrimpCrackers,0,Tue Mar 24 06:56:27 2015 UTC,Fair point.But China seems to want to expand its naval presence.The Chinese military gets notably stronger every year while the US military faces cutbacks.What the US wants and what it can afford to do may change.
taiwan,302qfx,just_face,3,Tue Mar 24 03:59:02 2015 UTC,"You're talking about a decade plus naval gap in boats, strategy, and tactics.  The Chinese Air Force can barely take off of their retrofitted Varyag much less keep the carrier out to water for an extended period.  Their ambitions are well known but in an invasion their abilities not only have to best Taiwan's defense capabilities while minimizing damage to infrastructure both residential and commercial (what good is a devastated economy and populace?) while also holding off the considerably more capable US navy and Air Force.  The two could be equals and still China would have a very small window (maybe a month) in which to subdue Taiwan (right now I believe China's estimate is subduing Taiwan in two-three months).    So they're contending with two different timelines, a non-conventional approach to invasion (precision firing at air and defense infrastructure followed by painless amphibious assault after navy neutralization) and asymmetric defense against the U.S. Navy around the ENTIRE Taiwanese island.  That's a HUGE operation: two different, unconventional strategies against two enemies in two different operations.  I think you severely underestimate what China needs to accomplish a positive political outcome.  It's why China very delicately pursues a strategy of annexation via mutual persuasion while One in which they still have to include the US in negotiations.    China also has to consider the economic and political fallout not just for the entire region, but the world."
taiwan,302qfx,just_face,0,Tue Mar 24 04:39:09 2015 UTC,"I also hope the US would come to Taiwan's aid but consider the forces that would be against it.The US business community is far more concerned about its ties to and investments in China and it has the money and lobbyists to back that up and sway opinion.And how much US debt does China hold?Just as after Vietnam,the US public is tired of foreign wars and how much does the average voter care about Taiwan?Enough to risk war with a nuclear superpower?"
taiwan,302qfx,just_face,2,Tue Mar 24 02:44:30 2015 UTC,See this post about the maritime buffer. That in itself is why Taiwan's importance is not going away even if Taiwan's complete economic and political relevance went down the drain. Taiwan's physical location is very strategically important too.
taiwan,302qfx,wkwrd,5,Tue Mar 24 06:57:45 2015 UTC,There was a serious fear of this in the early 1980s after the USA announced that the PRC is the real China.    This fear has subsided as the Chinese economy eclipsed the Taiwanese economy and freely attracted the people and capital that the Chinese thought they would have to invade to acquire.  Now that China has the better economy they know they only need to play the waiting game.
taiwan,302qfx,wkwrd,0,Tue Mar 24 00:43:15 2015 UTC,"I agree the PRC is in a waiting game but it has also been clear that it is not willing to wait forever.Ask any politically connected mainlander about how the party has consistently stated that this is a historic mission to once and for all end the 19th cen.

You're correct that the world haven't really gain independence from the rare earth supply mostly by China that's why Japan and the US are wise to spending effort to find other places for them.

taiwan,302qfx,wkwrd,-1,Tue Mar 24 01:16:22 2015 UTC,"Russia would probably support a PRC invasion,in part because Putin's rationale for taking territory from the Ukraine is in tune with the PRC basis for an invasion."

The real questions is, when that day comes, are the Taiwanese people prepared to start a war against China?

taiwan,302qfx,dorylinus,1 point,Tue Mar 24 01:57:36 2015 UTC,My main concern is not history but whether Taiwan will still be an independent democracy in 20-30 years.I think there is a real danger that someday the ultimatum will come and Taiwan will have no choice but surrender.
taiwan,302qfx,ShrimpCrackers,2,Tue Mar 24 02:50:04 2015 UTC,"I think you may well be right and that worries me.The PLA is now believed capable of conquering Taiwan in 2-3 weeks and as things are going that figure will just decrease.Someday the PRC may be able to take over Taiwan with just an ultimatum.The strawberry generation will take some deal like HK instead  of engaging in a hopeless fight.Of course,that will be their choice but it would be a tragedy not just for Taiwan but for the world.It would be especially tragic because it could have been prevented."
taiwan,302qfx,dorylinus,3,Tue Mar 24 01:41:54 2015 UTC,Where do you get the estimate that the PLA can overtake Taiwan in 2-3 weeks? Mounting an invasion across the Taiwan Strait would be an absolutely massive undertaking that currently the PLA does not have the naval capability to mount or defend.

taiwan,302qfx,dorylinus,3,Tue Mar 24 03:46:42 2015 UTC,China is still in no position to go to war and retake Taiwan but things change.   To answer the OP's question people take war with china very seriously in Taiwan. Taiwan Independence vs unification vs status quo is the subtext of all the political discussion here. You can be talking about unrelated topics and it will always spiral down to what side you are on. The threat of war imo is a big part of the equation.  Taiwan is strategically very important. China could control the south china sea and make life hard for everyone in the region. Anyone that claims they know whats going to happen with certainty are crazy. Anything can happen.
taiwan,302qfx,OuiNon,-1,Tue Mar 24 01:44:31 2015 UTC,"But in all the in fighting between green and blue why is there no serious discussion of how far one is willing to go to protect Taiwan's de facto independence.If the current military force can only slow the PLA for a couple of weeks,maybe its time for some alternatives.There are weapons that would give the PRC pause.Should they be considered or is independence not that precious?That is a discussion much more important than whose statue is where.Should people on the Titanic worry about icebergs or argue about politics?"
taiwan,302qfx,OuiNon,2,Tue Mar 24 02:22:42 2015 UTC,There are weapons that would give the PRC pause.   I am strongly for independence and better anti ship missiles with a good mix of missile defense systems would be a good place to start but imo will not get us all the way there. Nukes are out of the question but god knows we have plenty of uranium laying around. I am curious to see how things may develop with Japan as they increase military spending. A defense pac is still a bit far fetched but you never know.
taiwan,302qfx,Dragon_Fisting,1 point,Tue Mar 24 07:35:56 2015 UTC,"There is zero threat.  If you think otherwise, you need to learn more about the history, the people and all of the issues involved."
taiwan,302qfx,Dragon_Fisting,4,Tue Mar 24 00:20:56 2015 UTC,"The PRC's long standing policy is that it will use military force to ""unite"" with Taiwan if independence is ever declared and even if Taiwan does not do so the mainland has the absolute right to takeover Taiwan by military means at a time of its choosing.Are you unaware  of this?Don't take my word,check for yourself."
taiwan,302qfx,PNR_Robots,3,Tue Mar 24 00:34:09 2015 UTC,"There's this other country that's taken an interest in the issue, called the USA.

taiwan,302qfx,LOLAHAHS,4,Tue Mar 24 00:35:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, look at how willing the world was to go to war with Russia over Its invasion of the Ukraine lol.  It's easy to make promises, but hard to muster up a war-weary military and general population to start a costly and bloody war."
taiwan,302qfx,rockpapertiger,7,Tue Mar 24 00:45:13 2015 UTC,"The US has gone to war multiple times in defense of similar obligations, as in Korea and Vietnam.  In the case of Ukraine, there were no similar diplomatic obligations-- in fact, the previous Ukrainian government had been trending very strongly towards Russia and away from the EU, which is what part of what prompted the revolution in Ukraine in the first place.  These are really apples and oranges in comparison."
taiwan,302qfx,dorylinus,2,Tue Mar 24 00:51:05 2015 UTC,But at least the US has diplomatic ties with the Ukraine.Not so with Taiwan.Also the US has never conceded that Ukraine is part of Russia.
taiwan,302qfx,dorylinus,4,Tue Mar 24 01:01:50 2015 UTC,".Also the US has never conceded that Ukraine is part of Russia.   As noted in the other thread, you are mistaken in the belief that the US has conceded that Taiwan is ""part of"" China in the sense of being part of the PRC."
taiwan,302qfx,rousimarpalhares_,0,Tue Mar 24 01:20:52 2015 UTC,But the US has agreed there is one China and recognised Beijing as the government of China.That  seems very close.So close that a small change in future interpretation could easily make it de facto recognition.

I haven't had the Vinho Barrique yet (ex-Bourbon Cask and Sherry Cask from the Solist line are both very good), but I've been meaning to pick up a bottle (even more so now that it's famous).  The main downside is that the bottles tend to be quite expensive, especially considering their age.  Worth it, though."
taiwan,2zwuq9,chuiniu,6,Sun Mar 22 17:44:46 2015 UTC,"Completely agree about the pricing. It's good, but it's not appropriately priced. I've often wondered if it's because Taiwan was thrown a new market and neither the producers no consumers had a good idea of what it should cost.  That said, I went to the distillery recently and by the looks of their grounds I doubt the price is going anywhere. Gotta pay for all that fancy somehow. I contributed with a bottle of their distillers reserve, which I do quite like."
taiwan,2zwuq9,keyilan,1 point,Sun Mar 22 20:32:53 2015 UTC,"The whisky market in Taiwan is so competitive, though. It seems unlikely the price is a result of consumer or produce ignorance or some sort of marketing ploy on the part of the producer.   I'm sure there's a reason behind the pricing (fancy new distilleries aren't free, I guess), I just haven't heard the explanation."
taiwan,2zwuq9,chuiniu,2,Mon Mar 23 00:19:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I just meant early on when they were getting started. Not a lot of people are whiskey drinkers here and those that were at that point were likely used to paying a lot of money for imported whiskeys, so at the time the market was supporting that.  Every had ""the Kougawa"" (幸川) they sell at 愛買 for NT$250? Based in Taichung I believe. Pretty bad all things considered, but locally made and dirt cheap by comparison. With Kavalan I think paying for the name is a big part of it at this point. Well, that and paying off their massive facilities in Yilan.

taiwan,2zwuq9,keyilan,3,Mon Mar 23 00:25:39 2015 UTC,"When Kavalan set up their distillery they imported a lot of very expensive stock from Scotland as their 'base', so that might be part of it too."
taiwan,2zwuq9,himit,1 point,Mon Mar 23 03:54:01 2015 UTC,"You're right that things were quite different in 2005 (at least from what I've heard/read), so that probably has something to do with it.  It's still impressive that they've been able to continue to sell at this price as such a premium product and expand overseas as one.    It think it speaks both for the fact that Kavalan's good whisky and for the fact that it has been branded quite well.  After all, in Taiwan in 2015 you have a ton of great whisky to choose from if you're spending up to NT$3,000 on a bottle."
taiwan,2zwuq9,chuiniu,2,Mon Mar 23 07:02:46 2015 UTC,They're not branded with ages for a reason; it's because age only really means something considering the aging context. Taiwan vs Scotland are seriously different in this respect. Age isn't a reliable indicator of quality or taste anyways. Most of the previous winners of best single malt aren't highly aged whiskies. It's just a marketing thing and a way to signal to your friends that you're better than them because you drink older scotch.
taiwan,2zwuq9,tjscobbie,1 point,Sun Mar 22 19:57:42 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong. I have no problem with NAS whisky and I understand why Kavalan is aged as briefly as it is.  My point is just that there are reasons why, all else being equal, older whisky costs more to produce than younger whisky does and thus can be expected to cost more.   This fact, combined with the fact that prices on Scotch in Taiwan are some of the lowest in the world, to me makes Kavalan's prices feel unexpectedly high, though not shockingly so."

taiwan,2zw6ap,kikichun,3,Sun Mar 22 14:41:04 2015 UTC,"This is not quite the case. Depends on time of day and what not.  Uber is not only cheaper, the rides standards are much higher. There are tons of decrepit cars part of Taiwan's yellow taxi fleet, and the habit of taxi cab drivers to have their brothers or fathers or friends drive (so it can be a 24 hour business) is rampant. Just yesterday I stepped in a cab and the smell of puke was overwhelming. I got up immediately and exited. Sometimes the taxi cab driver forgets to charge. Other times the car is falling apart.  Not to mention with Uber's rating system, cars tend not to mess around, yellow taxis mess around a lot, I know because I really know the roads around my regular commutes and sometimes they take stupid turns to earn a few extra NT which generally won't happen with Uber.  Finally, there are times and neighborhoods in which it is VERY hard to find a taxi. There are fewer taxis at night and you can't easily call them.  In Manhattan where Uber is matured, for example, the average Uber car arrives in 2.5 minutes. An ambulance in NYC takes 6 minutes. It can take 20 minutes to grab a cab in Manhattan. There are places in Taiwan such as Neihu where it'll take you 15 minutes before you can grab an available yellow taxi."

Most of the taxis in Taipei are brand new.   sometimes they take stupid turns to earn a few extra NT   There might be exceptions, but if the taxi takes a longer route it's usually because he doesn't know the best way. That happened to me once or twice and in those cases the taxi didn't charge for the end of the trip because he made a mistake.

For the longer way thing, as someone who rides the taxi every day, I've encountered so so much more shenanigans on the yellow taxis than I have on Uber.  Finally, I thought 55688 doesn't work if it's too late, negating its purpose and they don't always send someone over."
taiwan,2zw6ap,ShrimpCrackers,0,Mon Mar 23 15:40:25 2015 UTC,"Quick, honest question: in Taiwan, is it Uber who is requiring the drivers to clean their cars before every shift or is it the drivers themselves who are deciding this?    If it's the former, that to me is more evidence that they are a transportation company.    If it's the latter, then it's evidence to suggest that Uber is an information company that's providing a service to independent operators."
taiwan,2zw6ap,chuiniu,1 point,Mon Mar 23 06:57:09 2015 UTC,"It's the Former. Getting a car cleaned costs money and time, starting at 600NT. Most yellow taxis only do it once a month, maximum.  So there is no doubt that Uber is a transportation company.  Uber will even help negotiate and finance better rates for taxi drivers. In Taiwan it's with Toyota Taiwan. So if you don't mind being an Uber driver for a new Toyota at very attractive rates, Uber will do it for you. Uber has even been said to pay the fines of those fined from it's massive 4 billion USD war chest.  So yes, they are without a doubt a transportation company, despite all the posturing."

Whether it was a torrential downpour or not a cloud in the sky, no taxi company would come up the hill. Were it not for a coworker having a membership to one of the companies and him sometimes calling for me, I would've been stuck on days I couldn't use my scooter.   I would've loved Uber.

Their app is so convenient that I can just hail one in one painless step from the convenience of my mobile device. Their cars are consistently better kept.

In short:  Today is the 500 Startups G Camp in Taiwan.  Founder Squad, ThisWeekIn.Asia Startup, Venture Network, Startup Consulting, Taipei Women in Tech Lunch Club, Social Enterprise Insights Talk meets every week or every month. There are dozens of organizations in between that have events all the time like AppWorks Demo Day, AppTalk, Business Next... and so forth. I recommend checking the Startups Digest Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, etc by choosing Southern Taiwan Beta and Taipei You'll be able to eventually meet everyone that way.  In long:  In terms of tech, there are a lot of entrepreneurship societies that meet all the time. For those wanting to do business in Taiwan or for those in Taiwan wanting to do business outside, there are culture-connection societies to ensure the process goes smoothly. There's also the great Taiwan Digest Startup List which details events nearly every other day happening in the Northern and Southern parts of Taiwan so you'll see piles of talks going non-stop.  Its possible because there are tons of co-working and sharing spaces building a lot of stuff in Taiwan. The government has restarted with incubators in the Nangang area in Taipei. And there are piles of existing organizations doing exactly this. According to some metrics, 27% of the population of Taiwan are small business owners. There are cubical shops where people rent a .5 x 1 meter cubicle to sell their wares in a store full of these things (so they won't have to actually have to open a shop and hire employees, the collectivism pays for it without having to spend much at all up-front). There are tons of stands, recently the BBQ beef ones have been a fad, and the 30 year old owners have taken over every single night market in Taipei with it.  It's not just software tech-based either, a lot of it is hardware; there's a whole cottage industry of Etsy like products where knitted things, laser etched hand crafts or laser cut leather pieces are sold all over Taiwan and online, working sometimes in conjunction with the Maker spaces all around Taipei. Speaking of which the makerspaces and hackerspaces are really great places where people can get in, often for free, to build and design their ideas. MakerBar happens to be a center of one of these where people have invented their own double extruder heads for the Prusa i3 on their own (quite a technical feat really). There are designers using these centers to make furniture and lighting and an organization nearby has made much of their office furniture using CNCs. Related is the FabCafe which shows lots of this, and FabLab which is another center of entrepreneurship where people go to make prototypes of their ideas - last month I saw someone laser cut and CNC a new lightweight transmission and gearing system for bicycles. It's the norm to see new prototypes or mechanical inventions every week thanks to this. It's even transformed YANDEX, our young designers expo from drawn prototypes to working concepts thanks to 3d printing and cheap CNC use.  Also, starting a business even if you're a foreigner in Taiwan is rather easy, and an entrepreneuring fellow (originally from Germany I believe) started a book simply called ""How to Start a Business in Taiwan"" which has been a handbook for many to follow. For locals, most people are eager to start a business, it's seen as a much better opportunity rather than working 9-6 at a local company."

taiwan,2zts4l,taipeiren,5,Sun Mar 22 04:18:27 2015 UTC,"(Copy-pasting from an earlier post)  Taiwan receives a lot of rain every year -- more than 3x the world average, in fact -- but most come in bursts (i.e. typhoons) and are very hard to retain. Therefore Taiwan is very reliant on dams as buffers, but unfortunately dams can only hold so much, and could be drained pretty quickly in a prolonged drought, as is the case right now.  The last serious drought happened in 2002 (preceded by episodes in 1995 and 1980), so I don't think it's a common thing, though not rare either. We had a very dry winter, followed by late plum rains, thus the water level at Shimen dam is at a historically low level though, which is why the alarm bells are sounding off. If the plum rains come weak, or worse, don't come at all, it could be July or even August before typhoons finally bring an end to this drought.  Interestingly though, massive rainfall brought by typhoons could also shut down water supply: The silt brought into dams can prove too much for the filtering systems to handle, and water may be restricted for weeks before the silt settles. This had happened in the past as well."

You don't mean the bar in Taipei also called ""Chess Club"".   Chase Chess Academy has a monthly tourney and club. They're at Room 2, 2F, No. 8, Lane 151, Section 2, Fuxing South Road, Da-an District, Taipei . This is an established club and at a real office. You'll find some challenging players here of all ages. It's not quite as serious as say, New York's Marshall Chess Club which is 100 years old, but it's not casual either.  Taipei Chess & Backgammon Club is a lot more casual and meets on Wednesdays at Vinyl Decision. They've been meeting there for years and it was started by Betelnut on Forumosa.   These two are also the best launch pad to find other smaller groups. Board games in general are vogue in Taiwan now, so you can find tons of stuff related to board games, including chess, and it's quite often a smaller cafe or pub will play host to these gatherings."

So I'm not sure if they could even enforce it when push comes to shove. If you're in the tech industry I'm sure that it's an attempt to prevent 'theft'. Otherwise it's just an attempt to control, which seems to be an obsession."
taiwan,2zsv5o,circleback,3,Sat Mar 21 17:43:10 2015 UTC,We have non-competition clauses in the US.
taiwan,2zsv5o,Tyberos,3,Sat Mar 21 17:47:51 2015 UTC,Only in certain states and only at certain income levels.  California has explicit rules against non-competes - they are generally null-and-void from the get-go.
taiwan,2zsv5o,mantrap2,3,Sat Mar 21 18:17:16 2015 UTC,"Non competes are generally for people that make huge sums and deal with trade secrets. Even then the most extreme is usually about one or two years, and the compensation usually is really good as is severance. I've never heard of anyone making a petty salary and still burdened with a non compete."
taiwan,2zsv5o,ShrimpCrackers,2,Sun Mar 22 16:59:37 2015 UTC,"Taiwan is generally anti-worker and pro-laoban, so yes.  If the company is a big national hero such as TSMC/HTC, they can even get a chickenshit ruling from a sympathetic court (see example here).  Refusal to honor non-competes turns out to be a major contributor to growth, it's a shame that Taiwan hasn't refused to enforce these kinds of laws."
taiwan,2zsv5o,just_face,1 point,Sat Mar 21 13:22:48 2015 UTC,"It really depends because the non compete agreement can't last too long and is only enforceable for positions that deal with things like trade secrets. So a non compete won't work for (let's use an extreme example) someone working a 7-Eleven, but it will for 1 year for an chip fab engineer - if they're let go with some sort of compensation attached. They can't put an indefinite non compete and it can only be about a year anyway. Perhaps there might be an exception or two but they generally will not last past two years. However to earn a two year non compete, you probably are making huge sums. They dont bother so much with those for the little guys.   This is fairly standard practice in my field as an engineer."

However, outside of California, non-competes are a reality, it's not just limited to Taiwan, but nearly everywhere else in the world. I mean Google Drive is a great product, it's based in NYC, not California, and most those guys in the core team have non-competes for similar technology, though lasting months and very specific non-competes as well..  Also, for your link to Liang in your original post, I don't have much sympathy for him. Lets see, he clearly gave away trade secrets just because he didn't get promoted to the top position, even though he was making more than 99.999% of Taiwanese people and certainly was a top wage earner and officer at TSMC. He did sign a non-compete and he promised to take huge sums from TSMC as part of his quitting, with strings attached and betrayed that.  I wouldn't be surprised if Samsung lets him go if he can't timely produce anything after the 14mm fab process because no one in the industry trusts him anymore. Liang didn't produce that technology on his own; he had huge TSMC labs, nearly unlimited resources provided by TSMC, and the best TSMC scientists working under him, but he took the fruits of that with him to Samsung. He took billions in R&D that he didn't provide. The reasons WHY we have Non-Competes in the first place is because of people like Liang."

For example, for the cases in tech industry, this clause is not enforceable unless they offer signup bonus or extensive training (no including internal training). I won't be surprised that a similar case will be enforceable for the entertainment industry assuming they do spend money to promote a new star. On the other hand, usually 6 months - 1 year after termination is the max length the court will approve.  So, to your best interest, get a lawyer to review the contract. Have someone amended the contract assuming it's enforceable.

Boomsound is great, it doesn't have to take 30% of the face. They seriously need better marketers. The commercials are just silly or dumb. Especially the Taiwan ones. Their model names are nearly as confusing as Nokia's old and mysterious methods. Why not just make it clear and streamlined? They don't really have a known Phablet competitor even though it's one of the best markets out there. Having old 5"" flagship phones isn't going to cut it when virtually everyone else has 5.5""-6"" phones. They have an inability to expand into other accessories or related markets.

The total length of the walkway will be around 1km, and it is planned to stores in it as well, akin to the East Shopping Mall between Zhongxiao Fuxing and Zhongxiao Dunhua.

It's also a great way to launder money and a specific party in Taiwan has lots of money to launder as regulation gets tighter.  Sometimes its a government related project and then they use graft, such as Guanghwa Market's ""new building"" which wasn't made nearly to spec and was delayed by almost half a decade worth of graft-filled construction (it was supposed to be finished in just 1.5 years, devs pocketed all that money from the Taipei government). Another good example is right next door to it, the Syntech building in Guanghwa where the devs got all that prime real-estate for the price of a moderate apartment in Taipei. Since the land it rests on is so pricey, if the devs simply sold the land back to the government at market rates and gave away the new building for free, they'd still earn their money back a few times over. Sadly, a lot of the commercial space is already filled, so the devs basically got away with stealing from the Taipei government and in effect the Taipei tax payer. Someone was definitely paid a handsome amount of cash for that deal under the table."

taiwan,2zkh8y,Roygbiv0415,6,Thu Mar 19 09:26:54 2015 UTC,"Water rationing comes in phases. The first phase lowers pipe pressure at night, and the second phase reduces water supplied to heavy users (swimming pools, car wash, etc.) Both phases are already in effect throughout most of the worst hit areas.  The third phase is the one that starts affecting normal folks, and the one slated to begin in April. It will start on a 5-2 basis, meaning that you'll get 5 days of normal tap water supply, and 2 days without. It is advised that you have a small reserve of water (perhaps a filled tub or a couple of buckets) to get through.  If things get worse, we might enter further rationing on a 4-2 and eventually 2-2 basis. With a record low rainfall during the autumn / winter rain season, and the spring plum rains nowhere in sight, this bleak forecast is looking more and more likely.  There's even a fourth phase after that, but the fourth phase basically means water can no longer be provided freely, but instead will be rationed out on a priority basis.  TL;DR: No, the water will not just randomly stop. You will know beforehand when the water will stop flowing, and remember to stock up a bit while the water is running."
taiwan,2zkh8y,mo0k,3,Thu Mar 19 12:15:01 2015 UTC,Also if you live in a large building often times the water can shut off for a day or two without affecting you at all because of the storage tanks on the roof.

Therefore Taiwan is very reliant on dams as buffers, but unfortunately dams can only hold so much, and could be drained pretty quickly in a prolonged drought, as is the case right now.  The last serious drought happened in 2002 (preceded by episodes in 1995 and 1980), so I don't think it's a common thing, though not rare either. We had a very dry winter, followed by late plum rains, thus the water level at Shimen dam is at a historically low level though, which is why the alarm bells are sounding off. If the plum rains come weak, or worse, don't come at all, it could be July or even August before typhoons finally bring an end to this drought.  Interestingly though, massive rainfall brought by typhoons could also shut down water supply: The silt brought into dams can prove too much for the filtering systems to handle, and water may be restricted for weeks before the silt settles.

As a bonus, president Ma is now a lame duck and the new mayor of Taipei is a Sunflower sympathizer. Not bad, all in all, but like a lot of people who have been watching what's going on I remain skeptical about what comes next. How can all that energy be turned into real reform? Simply electing a DPP president and legislative majority won't guarantee that.  I am no expert nor do I have any great insight into politics in Taiwan but it feels a bit like watching how things go down in America with the Democrats and Republicans. There's a kind of political tribalism at work, particularly in the pan-blue camp, that polarizes public discourse to an absurd extreme. And so you have a bunch of the usual suspects slugging it out in the trenches while the rest of us sit on the sidelines shaking our heads. Mostly I am just hoping that elements of Taiwanese civil society continue to hold their major political parties accountable.

Every other NAC meeting in the past was chaired by the sitting President but this last Thursday the DPP called into question the legitimacy of Ma to chair such events. So the meeting was scrapped.

It would be to counter a Chinese invasion, you don't seriously think the USA wants to invade China right?  It's never going to be an open war over Taiwan alone because China has made it clear its ambitions don't end with Taiwan either, its just a stepping stone that severely weakens Japan and South Korea's ability to defend themselves. Once those gas and oil supply lines are cut, it's only a matter of time before South Korea or Japan falls in a war; neither will accept that. Also it's blatantly clear when Japan considered defending Taiwan in its reinterpretation of Article 9. If the USA loses Taiwan, it loses half of Asia."

taiwan,2zjbcb,FormosaNation,-1,Fri Mar 20 03:45:01 2015 UTC,"How exactly do you think declaring independence will help ""Taiwan thrive politically and economically""?  What, will all of the industries that fled Taiwan for China come back when independence is declared?  Will the housing market improve somehow?  Will economic growth be jumpstarted?  Will the countries Taiwan depends upon for trade be more willing to offer generous trading terms?  I'll be generous and assume there are no military/economic sanctions or attack from China.

We had running water for two hours in the AM and two hours in the PM. Not always on schedule.   Garbage everywhere. Goats butchered on the sidewalks. Everything cheap as you could want. Western food nowhere to be seen.  The food was delicious. The people were friendly.   This was all a decade ago now, so how much it's changed, I don't know.  Comparable to Taiwan? Not much."
taiwan,2zfh3j,TheColorWolf,5,Wed Mar 18 10:54:34 2015 UTC,"I worked in both and also Vietnam. Taiwan's quality of life and quality of 'not being dicked around by people' is way higher than any of the big Chinese cities. You can save more  money in China, but is it really worth it?"

I was in Nanning, Guangxi so it was a city but it's a third-tier city that few people have heard of. My quality of life there was...different. I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say worse though. My apartment was bigger and had a kitchen. I worked fewer hours and made less money however the money I did have went a lot farther. It was also a lot easier for me to make friends. The Taiwanese often really look down on the Chinese and talk about how ""terrible"" China is but it's really not. I didn't live in a village there so I can't tell you about that...but from my own limited experience...it was an easier place to live."

All I'm trying to say is that while in some ways Taiwan is more comfortable than the mainland, the mainland is definitely catching up. I had a really good experience there and the last 7 months I've spent in Taiwan have not been so great. But, that's just my experience. I know others who adore Taiwan and others who adore China. Maybe take a trip there and do some couchsurfing in one of the places you're interested in finding work. You could meet the local expats there and get a better feel for the place.

In itself teaching English for a buxiban is a dead-end career (versus say starting your own business), but you can use the money to build something more meaningful.

taiwan,2zcjov,x3nomik,8,Wed Mar 18 13:18:36 2015 UTC,"So on the NT$2000 and 200 bills: You can ask for them at mostly any bank, and the bank will gladly give you some for exchange. They don't know what to do with them either, but I think as a rule, they must always order a certain amount of each and have them in stock. The reason the 2000 notes are underused, is because they were introduced anticipating an inflation that didn't really come, while the 200 notes because they were not particularly useful, plus (as I've heard) it has Chiang Kai-Shek on it.  It's a lot of fun using 200 bills. Most cash registers don't design a designated slot for it, so when you pay using the bill, you'll often find the cashier fumbling with the note and trying to figure out where to stash it. :D"
taiwan,2zcjov,Roygbiv0415,-4,Tue Mar 17 20:33:40 2015 UTC,The other side of the story was that 2000 bill was created so Chen Shui-Bian could be bribed easier. And that they purposely put Chiang on the 200 bill since it's the least circulated one.

taiwan,2zcjov,laopi,4,Thu Mar 19 04:10:52 2015 UTC,"From the Mandarin version of the article: http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%89%E4%B8%83%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6  In the last section (my summarized translation):  After the incident was revealed, the then Chief of General Staff Hau Pei-tsun reported directly to the president (Chiang Ching-kuo). It was decided to repost the commander Zhào Wànfù and the command political officer Chang. The division commander, division political officer, regiment commander, battalion comander, and the company commanders were court marshaled.  Chiang asked Hau about the public reactions to the incident, and Hau wrote down in his diary that public attention will not die out so soon, it's still a difficult case to handle and we'll have to wait and see after half a year.  The regiment commander that was personally on site was convicted of 1 year 10 months for instigation of murder. Battalion commander 1 year 10 months for accessory to multiple murders. Two company commanders 1 year 8 months for accessory to murder. However all of the above sentences received 3 years stay of execution. No other ranking officers were punished.    My view on the sentences: the court marshal probably chose to look at everything up until the bazooka to conform to the rules of engagement. So the murder counts would probably start only from the 3 survivors who tried to communicate, and the other survivors the next day. There is no excuse for the stay of execution, however."

There were also mandatory classes on culture, history, language, etc, but I was too young and stupid to pay attention.  Most people were asleep in class, tired from the night before.  The rules were pretty lax, the only consequence was that you wouldn't get your yearbook if you don't attend all your classes.  In the end, someone found out where the yearbooks were and handed them out to everyone.  I also remember a tour around the island, but again I was too immature to really pay attention - I mostly remember the beauty of Taroko Gorge.

They're under obligation to pay you what they pay local Taiwan students: pennies. That said, teaching English is the main go-to for a lot of foreigners in Taipei. It's lucrative, flexible, and good for your resume. You can find substitute positions almost immediately by joining the Facebook group for it.  I don't know if the policy's changed, but when I wanted to get my work permit, it required that I had been learning Chinese for a year prior to applying for the permit. If that's still the case, you'll need to give private lessons or find a buxiban ('cram school') that will hire you under the table. That's also a risky proposition though, since if your found out you'll probably be kicked out of the county.  Source: Chinese Culture University MLC graduate; 3 years in Taiwan."

taiwan,2zadeq,Tyberos,2,Tue Mar 17 19:13:59 2015 UTC,"Yikes man. I don't know what got you in such a bad mood, but that hurts. Am I qualified? No; I don't have a certificate/degree to teach English, but neither do most English teachers in Asia. Those that do typically work at the private schools or higher-end buxibans. Those that don't (like me), work at whichever school needs a foreign-looking face to convince parents of their authenticity.  Teaching English in Asia doesn't rely on writing skills unless you're teaching upper-level high school or university students. Often, Asian students have very good writing skills, and really poor speaking/listening skills.  ""Private / Group English Teacher in Asia"" sounds great on a resume; it means you've had experience in a foreign country, where you managed and led a group of students who didn't even speak your language. For a young person, that sure looks better than ""Busboy"" or ""Sales Associate""."

Noting this, do you have an idea of what mountain(s) you were hiking up and/or near? That would give a better indication of what buildings would be in your area.  Briefly, some of the structures that may be seen are:   Military installations (old and relatively new that have fallen into disuse) Old mining structures and items Derelict park structures Abandoned housing Temples/shrines Gravesites   Do you have pictures of what you are referring to?

The entrance to two separate surveillance stations is across from Siaoyoukeng (小油坑).   Depending on the direction you went to Qixing, you either arrived at:   The parking lot of Siaoyoukeng, where there is a large, crater-like fumarole and the entrance to Qixing's main peak The Lengshuikeng Visitor Center (陽明山冷水坑), which is below Qixing's eastern peak   If #1, the structures were most likely military-related. In that same area are some old houses, of which some were turned into businesses like restaurants. Some of both of those categories have fallen out of use and have either been abandoned or shuttered.  If #2, the structures toward the bottom may have also been shuttered shops of some sort and old rest stops that have given way to newer pavilions for people to relax and wait for buses at. Hiking from here to Qixing East Peak (七星山東峰) does, depending on hiking route, pass some derelict military sheds and the like.

McKinsey, BCG, and Goldman Sachs have Taipei offices from what I know, and besides applying online you can at least try reaching out to the recruiters for those offices and see if anything's available.   Assuming you're at a North American school though, I don't think Taipei opportunities are as common.

However in the context of World War II Commemorations, we need to see what this event -- the surrendering of Japan and the reoccupation of Taiwan by KMT forces -- means for Taiwan, and for the Taiwanese, I can see very little cause for celebration. All that had been achieved through 50 years of struggle under Japanese colonial rule had been wiped out, and a new colonial master came demanding even more.

You seem to refer to the Kuomintang as just another foreign invader merely replacing the Japanese, yet the KMT has always maintained a presence in Taiwan and amongst its people since the First Sino-Japanese War:  http://65th.tpg.gov.tw/english/01/s-anti-japanese.html  http://www.taiwan-panorama.com/en/show_issue.php?id=2010119911070e.txt&table=2&cur_page=1&distype=text  You mention your grandmother and her fond thoughts of the Japanese occupation era.  People's identities consolidate during their formative years and persist afterwards - I've also got older relatives in my family who grew up as Japanese in everything but ethnicity (they still go by their Japanese nicknames) and are hardcore DPP supporters; their younger siblings grew up in a completely different culture and instead vote KMT.  I see the surrender of Japan and the retrocession of Taiwan in a much more positive light than you do.  First and foremost these events ended the unfathomable suffering both in Taiwan (conscription, comfort women, wartime economy, loss of infrastructure and further loss of lives due to American bombings, etc.) and on the mainland (no explanation necessary) inflicted by Japanese greed and aggression.  The retrocession of Taiwan also stands as a fulfillment of the dreams of the martyrs and revolutionaries who, upon seeing that Japan's rapacious seizure of Taiwan from the feeble Qing dynasty marked the end of an old era, dedicated their lives to the creation of a Republic of China that now stands as a fully democratic state.  What would have happened if Japan still retained control of Taiwan?  Besides depriving the world of its only Chinese democracy and traditional Chinese culture/writing/relics/etc., Taiwan would probably have the same fate as that of the Ryukyu Islands, with American military bases everywhere (due to Taiwan's strategic geographic location as an ""unsinkable aircraft carrier"") and the same issues with rapes by American military personnel.

Once you're in class, in good standing with the school, and have been in the country for about 9-10 weeks, you take your student information and your visa to the immigration office in Taipei (or where ever you are) and apply for an extension to 180 days. If you remain a student throughout that time and will continue beyond 180 days, you can apply for an alien residency card. If you do it this way, you won't need to do a visa run.  If you only plan on studying for less than 90 days but wish to remain after, you can come without a visa and you can find the cheapest flight to Hong Kong, Manila, Osaka, etc for your visa run. It'll maybe cost $150 - $300."

If you stay at the dorm on campus it's cheap as. If you eat like the locals then food is cheap as.  I was at Mingchuan University and we only had morning classes Mon - Fri. It was great.  Visa runs are cheap, you can fly to Hong Kong for a day. There used to be a day boat trip you could do that was even cheaper to get a new visa, I don't know if that still exists. The University should advise you on the ins and outs of a student visa."

taiwan,2yv5fr,chefjon,16,Fri Mar 13 01:50:50 2015 UTC,"Sweet and Salty. Not much cream or spicy.  Honestly, there aren't that many things unique to Taiwan. Off the top of my head 肉圓, 阿給, 鐵蛋, 蚵仔麵線.... and maybe 控肉 and 剉冰 but I think those are questionable.   Everything else originated in China or elsewhere. That being said, Taiwan has fabulous 滬菜, 川菜, and 粵菜. I personally like the Cantonese style food in Taiwan better than Hong Kong. It's to be noted some Taiwanese 小吃 are of Japanese or Western Origin. 甜不辣 and 鹽酥雞 are good examples.  At its best, Taiwanese food (strictly Taiwanese) is essentially the same as food from Fujian -- but what makes the place great is that it picks up dishes from all of China and makes them WELL. Food in Hong Kong, if you're not eating Cantonese style, basically tastes like crap (Shanghai Dumplings, Sichuanese food, Beijing Duck). If you go to other Chinese cities like Zhengzhou or Shenyang, you can forget about getting any sort of decent Dimsum.  In Taiwan, all of the above are accessible, and made WELL."

In all seriousness though, I could find pretty decent foreign food in Taiwan (Japanese especially), not top notch, but acceptable.

taiwan,2yv5fr,Y0tsuya,6,Fri Mar 13 20:07:41 2015 UTC,"I personally interpret ""Taiwanese food"" as food that is popular/common in Taiwan. A lot of people like to interpret it as food that originated in Taiwan, such as ""Mongolian BBQ"", which isn't that popular anymore. I don't usually include fad foods though, since many of those are actual foreign foods that become popular for a few months then disappear."
taiwan,2yv5fr,Snugglze,5,Fri Mar 13 02:12:30 2015 UTC,"To me, I think of Taiwanese food as what everyone eats all the time, so I think there are 2 kinds of Taiwanese food: breakfast and the lunchbox.    For breakfast, you get huge breakfast sandwiches with egg, meat, onions, and greens, then a dollop of ketchup or mayo or both. Every breakfast place I've seen has been super busy in the mornings, and having tried them, I know why.    Lunchboxes are simply a staple here. They all contain rice or noodles, vegetables, pickled vegetables, and some meat. There are lots of variations. I've even seen Hong Kong style fried noodles and chicken nuggets in some. But no matter how different they are, they are always in a box held together by a red or brown rubber band."
taiwan,2yv5fr,warkweh,12,Fri Mar 13 05:43:43 2015 UTC,"Was just talking about the difference between authentic Thai food and Taiwanese food with my Chinese-Thai friends. Basically, Taiwanese food doesn't use a lot of seasoning and spices. The flavor comes from the veggies, proteins, and fat. About the only spices Taiwanese use on the daily basis are garlic, basil, and green onions.   Also, Taiwanese always do their own twists on foreign cuisine, and you have to get out of your way or pay more to get the authentic version. I hate when people use mayo as salad dressing, corn on pizza and in salad, ketchup in place of marinara sauce, soupy pasta... to name some of my food pet peeve.   Overall, I think Taiwanese food is a bit boring, and Taiwanese fusion can either knock your socks off or just plain bad."

Taiwanese food is a type of Chinese food - that is the appropriate and clear starting point. Crankychopsticks below has the best answer IMO."
taiwan,2yv5fr,vivalavida86,4,Fri Mar 13 11:51:57 2015 UTC,"This thread is asking people's definition of Taiwanese food. That was my opinion. It was unnecessary for you to use that language.   Also, it does make a lot of sense to compare the two cultures. Both eat lots of rice, rice noodles. They both use a lot of vegetables, pork, and seafood. Both cultures use tofu as a non-animal based protein. And not to mention that both Thai and Taiwanese cuisine are influenced by Chinese culture. So, it does make sense to me."
taiwan,2yv5fr,meimeiw,-1,Fri Mar 13 13:00:00 2015 UTC,"To clarify, I was not calling you a bonehead. People who mix up the cultures are boneheads. Also I think bonehead is one of the most innocuous insults one could think of.   My point is that it is really unhelpful to compare disparate cuisines because you miss the nuance. Same as if we compared Taiwanese food to Japanese, which are completely different. We could easily say one is seafood-based while the other consists of more stir fry, but that doesn't say much. Vegetable pork, seafood, tofu and noodles pretty much applies to all Asian cuisine. So I'm going to disagree with you again.  You are entitled to your opinion of course. And I am entitled to my opinion of your opinion.  edit: i didn't see that you wrote rice noodles, not noodles. i'll give you that..."

taiwan,2yv5fr,mudokipo,10,Fri Mar 13 03:49:26 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to sum up Taiwanese food.  I personally dig their small dishes (sorry don't know the name but the 100-200 small plates).  I tell people back in the US it's Chinese food with less gooeyness.  Yeah I know.  Lot's of basil, garlic and focus on the natural flavors of Veg/protein.  Other than that, the night market items are pretty lackluster imo and extremely repetitive and inconsistent.  Their fusion of other cuisines is consistently average and no items really stand out.  They pride themselves on their food, but they need to take a step back and open up their pallets a bit more.  Overall quite disappointing...why it doesn't resonate outside of the island."

Popular restaurants become tourist destinations (I used to live on Yongkang St. in Taipei) and the whole night market phenomenon is so overblown, with mediocre dishes getting tons of fanfare.

The site is in Chinese, so it can be easy or difficult depending on level of understanding.  Apartments that I've had were found using 591.com.tw. Problem here is it's Chinese, like the rest of them. If you'd like to try, your dropdown boxes should look like this.   The first box is the city or county. After that is selected, you'll choose a district or city within that area. In my example, 新北市+淡水區 (New Taipei City + Tamsui District) is selected.  The second box is the kind of apartment, things like multiple rooms, shared bathroom with floormates, etc. In my example, 獨立套房 (independent suite) is selected, kind of like a studio apartment...but the size varies.  The third box is your price-range.   You are going to be looking at room sizes in 坪 (ping), with one 坪 being about the size of a tatami mat. For single students, somewhere around 8~10坪 is good (well, it was for me...it's about dorm size); my first ""studio"" was 8坪 and last was 14坪. In Tamsui, between nt$5,000~10,000 will get you a decent single room with a bathroom, but a few more can get you multiple rooms. The closer to a big city you are, the higher the cost can get.  Here is an example result..  What I circled:   Blue is the floor room is on / floors in building Red is location and address Purple is contact information   Tealit.com can sometimes help with rent, as can Taiwanease, but for the most part your best bet is to use these Chinese sites. There are others if you don't have luck with this one. If you want to try it and need more help, let me know!  Edit: spelling"

All the listings are terrible ripoffs aimed at expats, if not by price then by lackluster location or quality or furnishings. I've personally visited over 30 Tealit listings and learned the hard way. I know there are ""good hearted"" people in the shared apartment listings, and they may not want to rip you off, but the prices they're charging you are way over the top because it's a share of the amount that they were ripped off of in the first place.  Others I've met were doing it to profit. Basically you find a 3 bedroom house, you find two expats to pay 16,000NT a month, and then you're ""rent free"" or nearly rent free. Usually these are the same guys that charge 700-1000NT a month for internet per person, so they make money off that too. It's a vicious place to rent and not recommended.  Then there are the sublet guys, these people sub-rent out crappy apartments for prices like 20,000-25,000NT a month, hoping to snag a expat just wanting to settle down now. So basically an expat is paying an extra 5,000-10,000nt a month so someone else can rent a better place.  Avoid Tealit. 591 and PTT are the best places. 591 is where most people list anyway."

taiwan,2yvd5t,Phos_,1 point,Fri Mar 13 03:11:58 2015 UTC,"Yup, but no outrage if the landlord keeps the 1 month. Also if the landlord was saying it was fine to leave any time during the second year as long as there was 30 days notice, doesn't necessarily mean he won't invoke the fine, just that he won't get especially upset over it.  A lot of landlords will be pretty annoyed if you break a lease. I've had an apartment contract signed in the middle of Shida Nightmarket, and then I did a ton of cleanup before moving in and the contract would start, because the landlord promised that the smell was due to previous tenants being smokers. So I basically spent 5 afternoons and nights refurbishing that apartment until I realized the smell was from a vent from a popular Thai Chicken place. Also neighboring apartments (that she owned) were roach ridden smoking tenants (which the landlord promised me wouldn't be an issue) and it turns out that's why they were unable to rent it out for a year. I also found out the AC was broken so the landlord installed a new one but the neighbor was having parties every night. When I told her, she cried and wailed and said that I should reconsider. Either way the landlord kept the part of the deposit which was bullshit considering I made her apartment look new but that's what you get. By the way, after I ""fixed"" her apartment, people moved in 3 days later. So I basically paid to clean up her place.  Contract is a contract."

Sounded like a scam in a rest stop bathroom--someone left a bag there and claimed the tourists stole it. The article I saw seemed to focus more on the mainland Chinese calling the Taiwanese thugs and whatnot.  Anyone have a decent translation of it?
taiwan,2ytlxi,YelDohan,2,Fri Mar 13 05:21:45 2015 UTC,"Some Taiwanese gangster lost their bag in the restroom, went back, couldn't find it, and saw the Chinese tourist coming out of the restroom. They accused the tourist of theft, forcefully checked their luggage, did not find any evidence, but keep shouting. This eventually escalated into a fistfight. The police just tell them that if either side press charges, both sides will be take back to the station.  It's really just a isolated incident, but given the anti-Chinese sentiment brewing in Taiwan it's not surprising that some media are intentionally trying to spice things up."

If water rationing is indeed implemented, the plan is to provide water for two days followed by two without.   The last time this happened was about 10 years ago, though the previous drought happened rather late (in May), and water rationing lasted only two weeks before being relived by the June typhoon season. Having a water crisis this early is unprecedented, and could mean up to two month of potential rationing."

Too many people getting their ""news"" from facebook and hearsay with little to no actual research and thought involved as well as jumping on any and every media-fed bandwagon.

taiwan,2yrijm,poorman99,3,Thu Mar 12 18:06:22 2015 UTC,"The ugly truth is, there's no place to put the nuclear waste on the main island, and the frequent hurricane & earthquake make it hard to put it on a remote island (if there were any uninhabitable one). The seller of nuclear fuel does not deal with the spent fuel, so they can't send them back to the US. They can't send the waste to neither mainland China nor North Korea because you-know-who will be against it. So, where are you going to put the ""EXTREMELY fucking clean"" nuclear waste?  BTW, the storage pool for spent fuel of the 1st nuclear plant is almost full. They are building the dry cask storage to store them in the plant. I have no knowledge to comment if that would work well in Taiwan's temperature, but dealing the waste has always be the top issue for the nuclear policy after safety."
taiwan,2yrijm,Tyr808,2,Fri Mar 13 19:14:32 2015 UTC,"I'll admit that I completely overlooked that aspect of it when I wrote my earlier comment. When I said clean, I was referring to the airborne emissions and such, not the spent fuel. That is indeed a concern, although at the same time, the emissions from current energy production methods are hardly sustainable either and energy storage isn't at the point where solar or wind is viable as anything more than a supplementary source.   I guess all we can do in the current moment is choose the lesser of the evils.   We have nuclear waste that CAN be contained (mostly), but is indeed catastrophic under failure, and on the other hand we have coal, oil, etc that is a slow, steady, and sure poison, as well as being finite resources.   Well, dammit. Once again I sit awake at night depressed over the prospects of yet another aspect of human life."
taiwan,2yrijm,Panseared_Tuna,2,Fri Mar 13 20:20:01 2015 UTC,"Yes it is. And it was demonstrated that Fukushima went to shit because they skimped on the water wall of whatever it's called. Also, when was the last time Taiwan was affected by a tsunami? This is why people can't have nice things."

taiwan,2yqnot,Get9,3,Thu Mar 12 00:45:32 2015 UTC,"I went to Tamkang for a bit (exchange program) and lived in Tamsui for five years (may be moving back to Tamsui from the U.S., actually). If you have any questions about where to find things in the area, feel free to send me a message.   As for some brief things:  There is a Holiday KTV for karaoke on Old Street. There are a few bars, with 藍舍坊BLUE HOUSE being my personal favorite. There are more than that, some near Tamkang and others around Fisherman's Wharf (well, the latter are the ""gathering"" type rather than pubs). There is a bowling alley and three pool halls near campus, too, if those appeal to you.  The ""night life"" depends on what you enjoy. If you are talking about things like clubs, numerous bars/lounges, lots of entertainment venues (MTVs, KTVs, etc.), then Tamsui has little night life. It's more relaxed, in my opinion, than Taipei, but has more than rural areas.  It's near Beitou for hot springs, or you can go out towards Sanzhi, Shihmen, Wanli (the northern coast) to find other hot spring places.   There is a lot of hiking, as Guanyin Mountain is right across the river in Bali (has five ""strong man trails"") and Yangming National Park is right at the Tamsui/Sanzhi border (and, actually, portions are right on the Tamsui border. You can get to Zhongzheng Mountain and Hutou Mountain if you have a vehicle and ten minutes).  The beaches used to be better, but since two people died drowning (though the victims knew they didn't know how to swim), the beach is ""closed"" (quotations because Taiwan and people do what they want).  Tamkang itself is nice, but I do recommend living off campus when you can. Don't live in CHOCOLATE (it's an apartment complex that has illegal floors throughout and is just an obnoxious environment); if you need help finding apartments, there are good websites for finding apartments to rent (feel free to ask for help if you want).   In general, the campus is a peaceful place, and it's really close to many, many restaurants (fantastic bagels at Dun Street Cafe, and the best chicken I've ever had at a Grandma/Grandpa-run restaurant, which translates to Apollo, at the end of the main alley where you'll find everyone goes to eat lunch).   If you need a general doctor, I recommend going to 水碓瑞安診所, which is on Beixin Rd. really close to campus (address: No. 61, Lane 182, Beixin Road).  tl;dr: I like Tamsui a little bit and love to help people get around the area."

I googled some places, but besides AirBnB I cant seem to find many English sites. Should you know of one, I'd be happy to hear it. Are there any community sites where I might be able to get in contact with other students or people looking for shared flats? Despite Tamkang being so big, it is quite untransparent unfortunately.  Thanks again for the great advice!"
taiwan,2yqnot,Get9,3,Thu Mar 12 16:41:26 2015 UTC,"Taiwanese PTTs are good for finding like-minded individuals to do things with or, in this case, rent with. Unless you have a Taiwanese friend to assist you in using them, though, you may not want to go that route.  In Tamsui, there are four colleges/universities. As such, there is a very large amount of apartments and ""communal living"" areas. One of the most popular was the aforementioned CHOCOLATE, which I just don't recommend.  Tamkang is surrounded by places to live for students (and non-students), but it's the finding them using English that's the difficult part. Apartments that I've had were found using 591.com.tw. Problem here is it's Chinese, like the rest of them. If you'd like to try, your dropdown boxes should look like this. The first box is 新北市+淡水區 (New Taipei City + Tamsui District). The second box is 獨立套房 (independent suite), kind of like a studio apartment...but the size varies. The third box is your price-range.  You are going to be looking at room sizes in 坪 (ping), with one 坪 being about the size of a tatami mat. For single students, somewhere around 8~10坪 is good; my first ""studio"" was 8坪 and last was 14坪. In Tamsui, between nt$5,000~10,000 will get you a decent single room with a bathroom.  Here is an example result. (It's actually really close to campus, and it's a tall, ""communal"" building.)  What I circled:   Blue is the floor room is on / floors in building Red is location and address Purple is contact information   Tealit.com can sometimes help with rent, as can Taiwanease, but for the most part your best bet is to use these Chinese sites. There are others if you don't have luck with this one. If you want to try it and need more help, let me know!  Edit: Correction & Clarification"

taiwan,2yo4hl,drofdet,8,Wed Mar 11 12:08:56 2015 UTC,"I believe Hess has regular teaching hours (mostly daytime).  At least that's the job that was offered to me, however I declined it.    I work at another cram school chain and it isn't a good job.  It's afternoon/night only and Saturday mornings.  Luckily for me this is definitely not where I am headed in life, and I'll just go back home after the contract is over.  I could even leave early and the penalty isn't as strong as other schools, but I'm here for other reasons so I might as well just stick it out.    I definitely would not want to do this for life or even for another year.  Working at a cram school job is only a small part of the reason I'm here, and the job allows me to use the rest of the time to work on things I'll be doing when I go back home (programming).  I also make really good money for the hours and live frugally, so I'll be able to save thousands to bring back to give me some cushion to get settled back home.    You're going to get thousands of different testimonies on how people's time was here.  As you can see I don't like the job at all, but most of my   coworkers are mostly happy and don't cause trouble.  They also have no intention of learning Chinese and don't assimilate.  Like one of my coworkers has been here for 6 months and still can't count to 10 in Chinese, that's just disrespectful.  I don't know if I'm cool with that, but they aren't causing trouble so I'll give them a pass I guess.  Most people stay for at least year but I've heard of people disappearing after a few months.  One of my coworkers has been here for almost 15 years.  I can see why both cases happen.   Taiwan is generally a really nice place but the culture leaves something to be desired.  The kids are more immature than the USA I've found, but not terribly to where it's unbearable.  They are cute and funny mostly but they have to constantly be corralled because they don't know limits (like any other kid to be fair), and they definitely don't respect the foreign teachers as much as their normal teachers.  Not being able to scold them in Chinese definitely limits me from being effective, as some parents get really angry if you even say 你好.  The job definitely has an element of babysitting larger than perhaps you might realize, as a lot of parents are dumping their kids at these schools because they work all day/night, and that can get frustrating fast.  As for getting a job, I applied at a whole bunch of places and I was offered four jobs at four really large schools.  It was a mess that I won't get into but I ended up at one of them.  If you have no experience you aren't going to get a job at a small school unless you have an ""in"".  These schools also tend to hire people who ""graduate"" out of the large cram schools (as in they complete their year contract at Hess/Kojen/Sesame Street/etc. and leave for a better school) over people who come over with no experience teaching.  So expect to work at a large, annoying cram school chain for your first year here.  I think the verdict for me is you really don't want a cram school job and you should probably just stay home, but if you must it could be worse.  Not all cram schools are equal, even within the same company.  It's a crap-shoot.  It's kind of like rolling the dice on a year of your life.    I think the question you need to ask yourself is do you enjoy your life as it is now?  Like generally do you enjoy your life?  Because if you do you should stay home, because Taiwan won't be much better... or it could be horribly worse.  EDIT:  Also don't think you actually need any sort of TEFL or whatever those things are but I'm sure it won't hurt.  And you aren't getting a job better than cram school without a masters.  It just isn't going to happen, don't even try.  EDIT2:  I reread this because I just wrote it and threw it up without thinking much, but I want to add that unless you are a criminal or a complete idiot you will find a job here in Taiwan if you are white and have a bachelor's degree.  That's just how it goes.  It may not be a good job, but some cram school will give you a job.  So don't worry too much about that end of it.  Do some research and figure out the best option for you.    TL;DR: You aren't getting a job that is better than cram school, and that's life.  I think I would worry more about the existential issues that come up rather than the job, because in the end all these cram school jobs are the same and it's complete luck whether or not you end up at a good cram school.  Also the coworkers are generally nice but aren't always the best people."

You are either going to come as an educator (Preschool Teacher, yoga instructor, personal trainer, etc.) or as an entertainer (actor, professional musician, etc..) or as a business owner (with proven capital).  That's just about it.  You cannot work at a banks branch office.  You cannot just get a job in retail.  You cannot just work in a bar.  You just can't.  Taiwan is a small place, and unless the position is ""be marginally white, and teach English"" (and I use the word ""teach"" very loosely here), local people will be hired over you ever time, or the position will just not be available to you due to visa-related regulations.  You don't even speak Mandarin, what do you really expect to do?

I can and will do it if necessary, but I would prefer to work in a different field.   I don't like all the fake attached to being an English teacher in a foreign country. If there is a problem with a student I like to confront the child and parent and fix the problem, not pretend like everything is alright and fill the parents with compliments of their children just to keep their business to keep the private school happy.   Its a broken education system and I don't believe in it.

This is a great personality trait and was like that in person. Her recent review on Honey Pig, as someone who used to eat tons of Korean food in NYC, I'd bash the banchan as being the worst I've ever had and stale. However in her review, she says she hopes they'd add more variety and skips the negative fact altogether. No Korean restaurant that servers Kalbi should leave the Kalbi unreviewed, however maybe she didn't like it? I work across the street from Honey Pig and I always liked their Kalbi. Maybe it's just better at 3am. Anyway hopefully this makes her reviews a bit more useful for you."

Taiwan doesn't talk shit about Uyghurs, Tibetans, or black people, but mainly because there aren't any significant population of them in Taiwan. I am 90% certain that if the nationalists had won the civil war, China would be just as racist to minorities today as it is now. Taiwan is actually even more racially homogeneous than China, with over 95% of its population being Han Chinese. However, that is not to say there are not internal problems. You're more likely to hear shit about waishengren or benshengren than anything else. There's also somewhat of a Minnan/Mandarin divide, but if you're white or not Chinese they don't care.

Part of this is because, in my experience, Taiwanese people are less xenophobic and materialistic than Chinese people.  Part of this is because Taiwanese people are definitely more tactful and polite than Chinese people and thus won't be as in your face with their xenophobia and materialism.  The exact ratio?  Who knows.  Of course, white foreigners who have shitty buxiban teaching jobs here in Taiwan might have similar frustrations to yours in China, because getting their asses kissed because their skin is white is exactly what they are being paid for.  So, I don't exactly feel sorry for people here with such complaints.  All that being said, the number of places on this planet where you can go in as an obvious foreigner and just blend right in and become accepted right away are incredibly few.  In fact, getting your ass kissed in a foreign land because your skin is white is about as perfect of an example of a First World Problem as you're going to get."

There is less passion/fire amongst the Taiwanese people compared to the mainland.  Taiwanese are more westernized and perhaps knowledgable of world events but they won't delve into uncomfortable subjects or debates for an extended period of time.  Xenophobia and racism is pretty rampant but hidden carefully amongst primarily elders and men.  So be prepared to have foreign friends and meet lots of more open minded women...which are much more attractive than the mainland.   At the end if the day, after having lived in both places.  I would say I miss the strangeness of china.  Never knew what each day would bring, but it was just too intense. Taiwan is way more chill and I was able to settle and meet some great people but ultimately left because it just wasn't enough for me.

You might as well make a mini vacation out of it instead of just leaving and coming back really quickly. Hong Kong, Macau, Philippines and mainland China all should be pretty cheap to go to. Japan, South Korea and Thailand are options too.  If you are going to do the exit/re-enter method, you might need proof of that before you enter Taiwan for the first time.

I said it because I recall reading that for somewhere (I think more than one country, but not necessarily about Taiwan) that occasionally the customs people will ask when you plan to leave and/or ask to see your ticket to leave. If they see that you plan to stay longer than the allowed time, it could be a problem. I also remember reading on the same source (can't remember now where it was) that they usually don't do these sort of checks for Western tourists. It's unlikely a Swedish citizen is gonna decide to become an illegal immigrant in Taiwan, right? So it's highly unlikely they'll check anyway, but if they do in Taiwan, it might be best to have the ticket to HK or wherever when you come into Taiwan, so you can say you're staying for 60 days and coming back for 31 days later. I might just be over cautions, but look it up to be safe.  Another thing I just remembered, I came into Taiwan on a visitor visa even though I don't need it with a Canadian passport. The reason was it made my application for a visa via marriage faster and cheaper (supposedly, it still was slow as fuck). Anyhow, I remember reading that my visitor visa started the next full day, and not the day I entered Taiwan. Check if this also counts for a visa-free entry, since that might give you the 91 days."

Located in the centre of the capital for over a decade, she has witnessed the shifting of generations and the wavering nature of modern music culture since her first night in town. At first, no one expected LUXY would make any difference, some might even had trouble pronouncing her name, yet she would only go on and became the synonym of luxury and sexiness for the generations to come, and placed Taipei on the world map of nocturnal delights along the way.  In the last twelve years, LUXY has gathered on her stage with countless international acts ranging from world’s top DJs to hiphop heavyweights to even pop icons nonetheless, culminating an unprecedented scale of cultural influence upon the land. Not content with being on the receiving end of bewildering performances, she gradually conceived her own LUXY Boyz and LUXY Girls, armed them with cutting-edge gadgets and technologies, transforming traditional dancer crews to internationally-acclaimed performance artists and wowing audiences from continent to continent. The past decade has seen LUXY broaden our views and revolutionize the club industry. With her continuing devotion to the scene, our taste for nightlife entertainment will never be the same.  However, her quest for excellence is coming to an end. Since her first night in the city, LUXY has brought us waves after waves of invaluable memories. And yet, this time LUXY herself will become a memory, a memory which will be dearly missed by all the generations that grew up under her influence. Nevertheless, the significance of her parting rests not upon an end of an era, but her ascension to the state of becoming a legend. Just like Hamlet or The Great Gatsby, the demise of the heroes is the moment when the characters truly become immortal. This is not the end, this is transcendence.  This March 20 & 21, please join us to celebrate LUXY’s ascension.   It's no secret LUXY has had tons of police heat lately. Outside of that I'm not willing to speculate."

Chiayi is the gateway to Alishan and Hualien is the gateway to Taroko, two of the finest parts of Taiwan. If you're self-motivated enough to get on a bike at least every weekend you could have fun in both. Both will be convenient. Both will require more spoken Chinese to navigate. Both will lack a variety of good western dining options. Both will probably have crappy public transportation, necessitating the use of a scooter or bicycle to get around.  A few differences to consider: Chiayi is far better connected to many urban centers on the west coast. It's close enough to Tainan that you can hop on the train and go check out one of the famous night markets there if the mood struck you. Kaohsiung isn't much further. Of course, being on the west coast means you're going to deal with lots of nasty wintertime pollution... but it's also drier than Hualien. Finally, one more advantage to Chiayi: it has way more history than Hualien.  Hualien, on the other hand, is a rather small, remote city, and there aren't too many other built-up places you can escape to for a day once you're there (but you can get to Taipei in a jiffy if need be). Chiayi has mountains but Hualien has mountains and beautiful coastline so that's something to consider, but with all that extra natural beauty you're also going to deal with a bigger earthquake and typhoon threat.  Honestly I'd consider living in both cities if given the opportunity but I haven't spent enough time in either to know as much as I'd like. If you're more into nature and aboriginal culture then I think Hualien has a slight advantage. If you like night markets and history and access to big urban centers then Chiayi has a definite advantage."

taiwan,2ybx3e,DerpyDogs,1 point,Mon Mar 9 10:01:54 2015 UTC,"I was staying somewhere near the mountains and the air was rather good.   The air quality does vary according to the time of year. In winter months, the amount of fine particulate matter is usually two or three times greater than in summer months. (Partly due to changes in wind direction and rainfall, but also due to the changing mixture of pollutant sources.)  With airborne fine particulate matter, it's very difficult to rely on one's own personal perception. That's why monitoring stations are so important, because they allow us to collect data in a standard way, allowing us to make objective comparisons.  The other problem with fine particulate matter is that it tends to spread out over large geographical distances. So even if you are in countryside to the east of Chiayi, it's hard to escape the effects of this pollution. To really escape, you would have to go over the mountains to the east coast.  I would say that, if you're really concerned about the air pollution (and personally I think it is reasonable to be concerned), then Hualien would probably a much better choice (based on historical data and trends.)  Let me know if you need any other data. Would be happy to provide what I can."

taiwan,2ybtcy,Roygbiv0415,3,Tue Mar 10 03:35:37 2015 UTC,"Uber is only available in Taipei (the capital) for the moment. It's not too difficult to grab a Uber car within 10 minutes if you're in city center, but further out they're far more sparse.   We have UberX and UberBlack here in Taipei, the former costing about 20% more than local taxis, while the latter is about 2x. In general I believe it is quite cheap -- you can go to most destinations within it's area of service for less than NT$350 with UberX, and less than NT650 with UberBlack.  That said, Taipei does have a very comprehensive (and cheap) metro system, and is almost always recommend over taxis or Uber. Just make sure you find a hotel that's near a metro station and you should be good for the majority of destinations in Taipei."

Listen do your dude friends; do not tell him that you like him or ask him if he likes you. Go with the group to KTV and ask him if he can drive you home. Linger awkwardly when he drops you off and see if he does anything. You can also say something like, ""maybe we can try [insert normal date activity], just the two of us"".

If you read this  http://www.magma.ca/~yeti/troopers.html   ""I don't know,"" he had answered grimly, ""except that the time-tested method of instilling social virtue and respect for law in the minds of the young did not appeal to a pre-scientific pseudo-professional class who called themselves 'social workers' or sometimes 'child psychologists.' It was too simple for them, apparently, since anybody could do it, using only the patience and firmness needed in training a puppy. I have sometimes wondered if they cherished a vested interest in disorder -- but that is unlikely; adults almost always act from conscious 'highest motives' no matter what their behavior.""   It's hard to conclude his scenario of a 'pre-scientific pseudo-professional class' ruining society hasn't been happening in most Western countries since the 1960s.   Now for whatever reason Taiwan doesn't seem to have that problem to the same extent. Things like the death penalty being retained are in a sense a sign of that.

I am no Taiwanese lawyer or legal expert, so I don't know whether this man has a viable insanity defense.

That is tyranny of the mob, which is not what rules in Taiwan.   If you look at the death penalty in Taiwan there was a temporary moratorium which was leading to abolition. That was ended due to pressure from public opinion  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Taiwan#Temporary_Moratorium_between_2006_and_2009   In May 2008, Chen Shui-bian's successor Ma Ying-jeou nominated Wang Ching-feng as the Minister of Justice. Wang also held an anti-capital punishment standpoint and delayed every death case delivered to the Minister's Office. Until March 2010, a total of 44 Supreme Court's condemned prisoners were detained by the Ministry but Wang still publicly announced her strong attitude towards anti-capital punishment during media interview. This caused controversy and the consensus suddenly broke out after entertainer Pai Ping-ping (whose daughter Pai Hsiao-yen was kidnapped and murdered in 1997) held strong protest against Wang. Wang, who originally refused to step down, resigned out of social pressure on March 11, 2010.[41] Wang's successor Tseng Yung-Fu(曾勇夫) promised to premier Wu Den-yih that he would resume executions   I don't think the masses - in either the UK or Taiwan - are as 'screaming' as you say. The difference between Taiwan and the UK is that in Taiwan listen to them and in the UK they do not. Public opinion in the UK supported the death penalty for decades after abolition and the political class simply ignored it. And in fact denigrated it as 'the screaming masses'. Meanwhile the homicide rate approximately doubled. Though the political class live in a bubble of police protection and expensive areas and don't experience it.  The same thing happens in Canada with NCR - public opinion is opposed to the scheme but the political class sneers at it as being ill informed.   This sort of thing is very dangerous for democracy - if people feel they are ruled by a political class which ignores their interests, cripples the justice system and leaves them at the mercy of criminals that increases the chance they'll vote for someone - anyone - who can change things. I.e. the political class may find itself by an outsider party. And that outsider party may be really irresponsible - e.g. the neo Nazis, Islamists, etc.  So I'd support democratic parties which will try to narrow the gap between elite views and the rest of society. UKIP in the UK being a perfect example."

If you have a democracy where most of the population is uneducated, unqualified, religious, divided, etc., you'd be surprised at the backwards stuff they'll vote for. Taiwan's post-1980s democracy isn't a disaster because Taiwanese generally don't have those qualities.   I really want to keep us on point here, though. Legal systems can quickly lose legitimacy without ""elitist"" neutrality. If the masses can pressure judges to execute (or not execute) people, trust in the legal system will be diminished. I believe that certain institutions should have a degree of autonomy (protection from democracy) in order to do their jobs properly. The justice system is one of those institutions."
taiwan,2y6twd,slowmoon,-1,Sat Mar 7 09:45:27 2015 UTC,"A non elitist system has the advantage that it is self correcting. It has a lot of immunity to fashionable ideas that the elite tends to hold. Historically those have been disastrous.   Incidentally it's worth pointing out that even in a liberal democracy punishments are decided by public opinion, albeit indirectly. You elect representatives who decide on laws and thus punishments. Juries decide whether someone is guilty or innocent. More subtly juries can find someone not guilty if they reckon they don't deserve the punishment. The press covers cases and public opinion can change representatives who can change the laws.  That's OK. What I object to is unaccountable experts overruling that process."

taiwan,2y6twd,17_character_limit,11,Sat Mar 7 08:51:14 2015 UTC,"It's even weirder, according to Wikipedia:    Executions are carried out by handgun shooting aimed at the heart from the back, or aimed at the brain stem under the ear if the prisoner consents to organ donation. The execution time used to be 5AM, but was changed to 9PM in 1995 to reduce officials' workload. It was changed again to 7.30PM in 2010.[14] Executions are performed in secret: nobody is informed beforehand, including the condemned. The execution chamber is located in the prison complex. The condemned is brought to the chamber by car, and would pay respects to the statue of Ksitigarbha located outside the chamber before entering. Before the execution, the prisoner is brought to a special court next to the execution chamber to have their identities confirmed and any last words recorded. They are then brought to the execution chamber and served their last meal (which includes a bottle of kaoliang).[14] The condemned is then injected with strong anaesthetic to leave him or her completely senseless. They are then placed flat on the ground face down and shot. The executioners would then burn hell bank notes for the deceased before carrying away the corpse.[14] It is customary for the condemned to place a NT$500 or 1000 banknote in their leg irons as a tip for the executioners.[14]"

Except as far as I know there is a single executioner, not executioners plural. It is very unusual to have a single executioner firing a gun. Most countries that carry out the death penalty by fatal gunshot will have multiple people in the firing squad and some will be issued blanks so there is uncertainty about who actually fired the fatal shots.   I must add that I think all these methods are truly barbaric and disgusting. The death penalty is immoral and wrong in so many ways."

As for thr location of the executions at the Tucheng location, a mud-floor shack out the back, no shit.

The law is very specific on this. If you are eligible for conscription, and you do not hold an Overseas Chinese Identity Certificate, then the relevant authorities have a responsibility to draft you regardless of how you entered the country, as long as you are physically in the country, they don't care if you dropped into a time-space fissure and popped out of nowhere. They are authorized by law to bar you from leaving the country again until you finish your conscription.  The only thing that can safeguard against conscription, is the Overseas Chinese Identity Certificate, which is a big one-page stamp in your Taiwan passport. Check with your local Taipei rep office for details. Also if you have family in Taiwan, ask them to check with the local municipality's conscription desk (ask for ""兵役課"") people to ascertain your actual status, as even the embassy people can be very wrong on this (they're not supposed to, but they can be).  I want to emphasize this again: do not expect to enter using an US passport unnoticed."

taiwan,2y2pzm,wildflowerss,2,Thu Mar 5 22:56:00 2015 UTC,"I was really hoping the article would do some digging to find out why there are no Apple stores in Taiwan.  I have always wondered if Taiwan has some sort of protectionist rules like India that prevent actual Apple stores, or if Apple just hates Taiwan.  It wouldn't surprise me at all if laws protect the status of local Apple resellers.  When I first got here, I thought Apple just hated Taiwan because the products had a huge price premium.  The price premium is not as bad now, but Taiwan gets products months later than the rest of the world."
taiwan,2y2pzm,just_face,1 point,Thu Mar 5 23:34:39 2015 UTC,Probably just skirting around the Taiwan vs China issue to win bonus points with the Chinese leadership in Beijing. That's a much bigger market after all and by some estimates about 30% of their bottom line.
taiwan,2y2pzm,Karmayana,2,Fri Mar 6 01:28:47 2015 UTC,"Plenty of companies do business in both areas though.  This explanation seems much less likely than some explanation that revolves around extreme protection of large Taiwanese technology companies and the small SMEs that retail technology.  Also, I could definitely buy the explanation that Taiwan wasn't a large Apple market until very very recently."
taiwan,2y2pzm,just_face,1 point,Fri Mar 6 01:43:35 2015 UTC,"Protectionism is also likely. I believe there is a law on the books regarding international companies headquartered overseas that states 51% or more of the localized business must be owned by a Taiwanese company, though I can't find the reference except in passing.  Apple likes to keep things 'in-house' and under their complete control (as far as their brand goes) so that could be a further explanation."
taiwan,2y2pzm,Karmayana,1 point,Fri Mar 6 02:01:40 2015 UTC,"It seems like the Fair Trade Law of 1992 and Fair Trade Act of 2010 might directly apply to some of the ways that Apple does retail business, specifically via retail price maintenance and being a virtual monopoly on the sale of Apple goods.  If this were the case, it would make those 1st level exhibits at Guanghua make sense.  The ones run by manufacturers who explicitly say ""We do not sell any computers, go upstairs to buy one of these computers"""
taiwan,2y2pzm,just_face,1 point,Fri Mar 6 02:18:04 2015 UTC,"Makes sense to me. It's probably easier for Apple to control an ""authorized reseller"" licensee than it would be to control a majority partner."
taiwan,2y2pzm,lolstebbo,1 point,Sun Mar 8 06:11:00 2015 UTC,"No reason not to have Apple stores in Taiwan.  People will eat it up here.  I've heard things from the Foxconn guy being buddy buddy with the Studio A guy, to protectionist intervention and the it not being lucrative enough excuse.  I'm betting it's the Gov't not wanting Apple to dominate the market and overshadow local brands HTC, Asus etc."
taiwan,2y2pzm,scinider,0,Sat Mar 7 01:33:40 2015 UTC,"The reason is simply because it is not profitable for Apple to open retail stores in Taiwan or else they would have done it already. You can figure out the obvious factors such as population, GDP,current market share, growth potential etc..... but that does not explain a whole lot, below are few of the more obvious reasons:   It makes no sense for Apple to buy their own products from a distributor so they will need to have a logistics center or a warehouse for themselves. Apple can very easily build a huge warehouse anywhere they want in Taiwan but why should they? Logistics in Taiwan is over-developed and extremely competitive which means there is no extra-profit to be made in this area by doing it themselves, actually it is very likely that they will have higher costs than the current premium resellers (the shipping cost of importing a product into the store) . A good simple counter example is Australia, similar population but their logistic costs are much more expensive than Taiwan, so Apple has retail stores there. Premium resellers such as Studio A or Youth make tiny margins for selling Apple products, these stores make much of their profit from selling you accessories such as protection cases and so on. Apple's overhead cost > the extra profit they can make by going direct. Studio A is owned by Foxconn (Terry Guo's brother), Youth is related to Farestone telecom, I'm sure Apple got a nice deal out of both of them. Apple's penetration in Taiwan is already extremely high, marginal effects are low to invest more in Taiwan since you cannot have 100% of the market share.    tl:dr: Apple don't need/want to open a store in Taiwan."
taiwan,2y2pzm,just_face,3,Fri Mar 6 03:55:12 2015 UTC,"The reason is simply because it is not profitable for Apple to open retail stores in Taiwan or else they would have done it already.    It would absolutely be profitable for Apple to create Apple stores in Taiwan.  The stores have some of the highest profitability per square foot of any retail.  It's almost guaranteed that stores would be mobbed almost non-stop.  Apple stores are more profitable than Tiffany's, and they have some extremely premium space in 101.  101's management would almost surely go out of the way to accomodate a large Apple store.   Premium resellers such as Studio A or Youth make tiny margins for selling Apple products, these stores make much of their profit from selling you accessories such as protection cases and so on.     Apple is not a typical wholesaler.  The margins are tiny, but Apple kicks back large bonuses and incentives for dealers who agree to do everything Apple says.   Apple has been sued in the past for how capriciously they award bonuses to preferred retailers because they can easily squeeze them out of business.  There are almost certainly major structural reasons why Apple cannot create an Apple store, and the reasons are probably related the existing partners that Apple has chosen as resellers on the island and the legal/business reaction of destroying their businesses overnight."
taiwan,2y2pzm,scinider,1 point,Fri Mar 6 04:50:13 2015 UTC,"If it's absolutely more profitable then there would be a store, but there isn't so it does not outweigh the ""cost"",no matter the reason or nature of the cost. Studio A and Youth are mostly located in some of the more expensive places in Taipei. Studio A actually had one of the most expensive places you could rent (per area) in all Taiwan, which was at the 1st floor of ""New York New York"" now ""ATT4FUN"". They eventually had to move out and could not get a deal with ATT4FUN because of their insane rent costs, which means Studio A does not think the revenus of the store can justify it's rent. I do believe an Apple retail store would get more revenue than a Studio A at the same location selling totally the same products, but I don't believe it will be of a significant difference like say 100% more.Apple retail stores can certainly sustain any rent in Taiwan but the revenue of the store may very likely not be profitable, they will keep it for marketing purposes but I doubt they care too much about the sales, which then goes to point 4 of my original post.  NO, Apple's MDF program and rebate programs are just brutal. They give much more incentives to countries that have less support from Apple but not Taiwan where they have large offices and full marketing teams.I'm not saying that retailers don't make profit, I'm just saying they make tiny margins compared to what they sell.       Taipei 101 does not care who you are and they won't go out of the way for anyone, they care about how much you are paying them and the highest bidder gets the spot. Places like Breeze or Living Mall that are located less ideally might give Apple discounts in order to get more attraction, but certainly not Taipei 101."
taiwan,2y2pzm,just_face,1 point,Fri Mar 6 05:56:47 2015 UTC,"Regardless of the specifics, why doesn't Apple have retail in Taiwan when they have retail in far less profitable markets?    The only other countries I can think of that have high demand for products and no Apple stores are countries with strong protectionist policies over local industry like India or Korea.  Apple already runs an online store in Taiwan and could absolutely afford the retail space anywhere on the island it cared to be.  They are even opening stores in second tier cities in China."
taiwan,2y2pzm,scinider,1 point,Fri Mar 6 06:15:33 2015 UTC,"The only countries you can think ok? Apple only has Apple stores in 16 countries. You have to understand that a company such as Apple, they would pounce at any chance they see profit because they have the resources to implement their ideas and business plans almost anyplace at anytime. Just ask yourself a question, STUDIO A has 14 stores in the great Taipei area, say you replace two of their largest stores (NEO19 and Taipei 101) into Apple stores, would you make more money than the previous 2 Studio A stores?The answer is yes you absolutely would, but by how much? You are literally selling the exact same things at the exact same price at the same place. Now let's look at your cost, you would need to hire a whole lot of people, not only the ones you see at the store, but logistics people, finance people etc and then the rent warehouse logistics etc... you get the idea. You get to keep most of the profit already just by selling to distributors such as Synnex unlike brands such as Sony or HTC who need to cut their margins for their partners to share and that's not counting that you will anger your current existing premium resellers which may further harm your revenues.     Many brands open direct stores to get more margin, say a camera for example, Distributors could get up to 8-15%, and resellers would get 20~% (just an example) but that's not the case for Apple, Apple already holds 90~% of the margin, they open  Apple stores for marketing and educational purposes, not sales (well eventually it is for sales though, but that's not the point here), the extra 10% of sales they will get by replacing or opening new Apple stores in Taiwan at least, does not justify it's extra expenses.   This isn't about any regulations or government policies, Taiwan ranked almost last place in Asia for foreign invested amount in Taiwan last year, the government would absolutely welcome Apple to have an Apple store here in Taiwan, but Apple is not doing it at least right now because it simply is not profitable for them."

When I was back in Taipei and feeling well I was in a hotel and the people in the room next door were Chinese and I could hear them heaving and puking just like I had done a few days prior.

taiwan,2xx43d,keyilan,3,Wed Mar 4 21:33:51 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, why are some stations built so far out? I mean, in Taipei, they've managed to have it stop at the main train station."
taiwan,2xx43d,Phos_,3,Thu Mar 5 02:18:38 2015 UTC,"From what I remember (unconfirmed, if someone can back me up on this, that would be nice), the HSR company was supposed to rent the land around the newly built stations and they were hoping to make a sizable profit from that, since those lands were supposed to become valuable. It's all about creating new areas."
taiwan,2xx43d,just_face,4,Thu Mar 5 02:52:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, the core of it is the desire of a lot of ill-conceived land speculation by a variety of groups.  There's the HSR corporation, but also politicians, planners, and state-owned companies like TaiSugar pushed to influence station placement."
taiwan,2xx43d,Doremi-fansubs,1 point,Thu Mar 5 03:02:29 2015 UTC,"Not ill-conceived, it's just that building into the city centers would be extremely expensive. Even Japan couldn't get its high speed rail stations into city centers (look at New Osaka or New Kobe stations as examples).  The problem here is that some of the cities don't have sufficient rail connections to the city centers from the high speed rail stop. Look at Chiayi's funky BRT system or Taichung's bumper to bumper traffic on Harbor road."
taiwan,2xx43d,davidonformosa,2,Mon Mar 9 16:23:31 2015 UTC,The reason is that the cost of acquiring the land is prohibitive. Part of the rationale behind the project is also about promoting new urban development and connecting the new stations to city centres with new MRT systems.   In the case of Taipei the HSR was able to use the underground alignment established by the TRA. Also in Taipei putting the station in the city centre is key to promoting high usage rates and the overall viability of the system.
taiwan,2xx43d,keyilan,1 point,Thu Mar 5 02:52:29 2015 UTC,"This is certainly what they're trying to do in Taoyuan. In Hsinchu it's just a separate short light rail from the HSR to the main station, which is fine, but still more of a pain in the ass than I'd like."

taiwan,2xx43d,Roygbiv0415,6,Thu Mar 5 02:14:27 2015 UTC,"You don't need any HSR to stop at every stop.

So let's say you have the following stations (capital letters for big cities):  A b c D e f g H i J   An express train would stop at ADHJ. One train could go AcDfHiJ. Another would go AbDegHJ.
