They're very different recipes, but the prep is the same and the results are amazing.  I can't pick a favorite, because while different, they're both really good.  I'm not great with my knife, so the best trick I've learned to cut the meat deadly thin is to use a knife Like This with a flat handle. I lay the knife flat on its side on the cutting board and make my cuts holding the meat as flat as possible.  With the pork loin, I make a slice and roll it over, L/R/R until it all rolls out like a scroll. That avoids the need to pound the meat with a mallet, which is helpful because I don't own a mallet."

My store didn't have wheat fettucine, so I had to settle with linguine, but I'm ok with that.  This meal is delicious and super easy to make.    Prep time - 10 mins  Cook time - 15 mins  Total time - 25 mins  Total Cost: $6.52  Cost Per Serving: $1.09  Serves: 6  Ingredients   4 cups vegetable broth $0.52 2 Tbsp olive oil $0.32 12 oz. fettuccine $1.33 8 oz. frozen chopped spinach $0.79 1 (28 oz.) can diced tomatoes $1.73 1 medium onion $0.43 4 cloves garlic $0.32 ½ Tbsp dried basil $0.07 ½ Tbsp dried oregano $0.07 ¼ tsp red pepper flakes $0.02 freshly cracked pepper to taste $0.05 2 oz. feta cheese $0.87   Instructions   Add four cups of vegetable broth to a large pot. Break the fettuccine in half to make stirring easier later, and then add it to the pot. Also add the canned tomatoes (undrained), olive oil, frozen spinach, onion (thinly sliced), garlic (thinly sliced), basil, oregano, red pepper, and some freshly cracked black pepper. Make sure the ingredients are submerged under the liquid, place a lid on top of the pot, and then turn the heat on to high. Allow the pot to come up to a full, rolling boil over high heat then remove the lid and turn the heat down to medium. Allow the pot to continue to boil over medium heat, without a lid, for 10-15 minutes, or until the pasta is cooked and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Stir the pot every few minutes as it cooks to prevent the pasta from sticking to the bottom, but avoid over stirring which can cause the pasta to become sticky and mushy. The pot must be boiling the entire time. After the pasta is cooked, crumble the feta cheese over top and serve."

Add the bulgur wheat and set aside for at least 1 hour (the longer it soaks, the softer  the bulgur becomes).  Combine the parsley, tomato, cucumber and onions in a large bowl and toss.  Add the dressing and bulgur wheat and toss again.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.  Grilled Lamb Meatballs:  Combine everything but the ground lamb in a food processor or blender and process until roughly pureed.  In a large bowl combine lamb and puree and mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon.  Shape into 16-24 equal-size meatballs and let rest for at least 30 minutes, refrigerated.  Grill meatballs over hot coals for 8-10 minutes or until juices run clear, turning frequently to brown on all sides.  Allow to rest for 5 minutes or so before serving over tabouleh on a large plate and garnish with pomegranate seeds (optional).

Meanwhile, mix eggs, egg yolks, Parmesan and nutmeg in a bowl and season lightly.  Heat oil and butter in large frying pan. Bruise garlic with the back of a knife and add to pan with lardons. Cook until lardons are crispy removing garlic when it becomes golden (careful not to burn garlic or it becomes bitter).  Drain spaghetti and add it to the frying pan and toss well with lardons. Remove heat and stir in egg mixture, allowing the heat of the pasta and pan to cook the egg (turn heat back on low if needed to finish cooking eggs properly).   Serve immediately with grated Parmesan for sprinkling on top.  Not the healthiest, but it's hearty and great for after doing lots of exercise (or just want to pig out a bit). It's also super simple and quick!"

tonightsdinner,3dpqux,kh556910,5,Sat Jul 18 06:42:49 2015 UTC,"It's funny how anywhere outside Italy everyone makes carbonara with cream but if an Italian sees this he explode in 1500 different ways explaining that the thing about carbonara is that it DOES NOT contain cream.  Now I am like you I used to do caronara with cream, then I learned better from italian friend.  I still do my recipe with cream, I don't call it carbonara anymore and my Italian friends find it strange but good (and stopped saying it is an abomination...)  One other thing your Italian friend may take umbrage for is the type of pasta you used.   Campanelle may is not very adapted to the dish. I am sure it was great but Italians are quite specific about this and there is merit in understanding this, if only to disagree with it and enjoy whatever sauce with the pasta of your choice!  Carbonara is usually done with ""long pasta"" spaghetti, Bucatini, Tagliatelle... Campanelle are more used with sauce more fluid tomato based, even ragu bolognese and beans, lentils, or speck and fontina, well little bits that would get trapped in the little flower...  The point is that it may trap too much of a sauce like the carbonara making it too heavy which it is already. However Carbonara sticks well on long pasta which give them more savors and makes them more manageable.  Now, and because I too ended up making an obnoxiously long post, I will impart you with the version of the carbonara an Italian friend left me. Because it is not the same which proves that the only thing Italian can agree on concerning Carbonara is that there is no cream.  For about 200g of bucatini 100g of guanciale, or bacon sliced big 2 big eggs 70g of parmiggiano regiano (Or pecorino) and as much more as you care to have aside for when you bring it on the table so if you are as crazy on the cheese as you said... well no worries add later  Shitloads of pepper (his words)  put the pasta to boil  aside in a bit of olive oil fry the bacon untl it gets brown and a bit bubbly but still soft inside (this is why you need BIG cuts of bacon)   bit the egg and cheeze and as much pepper as you are confortable with.   add a bit more pepper to that  to help this mix you can warm it up (but not cook it) over the vapor of your pasta which will soon be ready.  now here is the trick: once your pasta are cooked you throw them in with your meat until you coat them all in grease and them throw them in the egg-cheese mixture OUTSIDE the heat, and toss this shit around until the eggs are partially thickened.   check seasoning (as far as my friend is concerned it probably lacks pepper but I think he abuses it sometimes)  serve  add as much cheese on top as you wish (I usually abuse at this moment but I don't care it is my plate I do what I want)"

tonightsdinner,3dpqux,911pleasehold,3,Sat Jul 18 23:12:49 2015 UTC,"Okay so this was very fun to make because I got it from an Italian woman who I work with. I told her the recipe that I liked to use and she was not shy about telling me how wrong I was ;) Personally, I like both recipes (and I will share both!) but they are very different! My recipe I think is more mild in flavor, allowing the meat to have the principal flavor along with the cheese. In my friend's recipe, the sauce was incredibly rich and I was only able to eat half of what I made. It was extremely flavorful and delicious!  My Recipe:  5 egg yolks  7 tablespoons heavy cream  *1 1/2 cups parmesan cheese  *pancetta or bacon  salt and pepper  1 pound pasta (preferably penne)  Stir together the egg yolks, heavy cream, and parmesan while cooking the pancetta or bacon. DO NOT HEAT!! I heated it once and it was a complete mess. Instead, make the sauce ahead of time to bring the ingredients to room temperature. Once the meat is finished cooking, break into pieces and stir into the sauce. My advice would be to have the sauce completely finished before beginning to cook your pasta because it is important to move FAST. Cook your pasta al dente and drain quickly. Return pasta to the pot and immediately add your sauce. Stir very rapidly. The heat from the pasta cooks the egg yolks and produces a nice, creamy sauce. Serve right away, the dish cools very fast.   *(From above) The amount of cheese and meat is definitely a taste/texture preference. I LOVE cheese and tend to be out of control with it, so 1 1/2 cups is really just a suggestion. Just be sure that the consistency doesn't become paste-like. You can always add a dash more cream if you need to make adjustments!  My Friend's Recipe:  4 egg yolks, 1 whole egg  1 1/2 cups parmesan cheese  1/2 onion, diced  olive oil  pancetta  salt and pepper  Okay as you can see, the recipes aren't very different, the major difference is the lack of heavy cream and the addition of sofrito (fried onions). I would start doing this well ahead of time and slowly caramelize your onions over 30-40 minutes. Then, add your pancetta to the onions. You can either dice it ahead of time or break it up once cooked. Meanwhile, while the onions are cooking, mix your eggs and cheese. Once the sofrito and pancetta are finished cooking, mix them in with the sauce and begin to cook your pasta. Same procedure as before: work quickly, stir fast, serve immediately.  Wow this is obnoxiously long. Sorry, I just love carbonara and I wanted to share as much as I could! Please, if you have any suggestions or amendments you think I should consider, share them with me! :)"

Best I could tell you is:  A container's worth of blackberries in a pot, cover with Jack Daniels, put on the stove and flambe. When it stops burning, add water, lemon juice, dash of sriracha, dash of vanilla extract, salt, pepper. Cook until the blackberries turn to mush, blend up, reduce, and use to deglaze the pan when you're done cooking the steaks."

tonightsdinner,3dm7jd,Hypnos317,3,Fri Jul 17 18:23:09 2015 UTC,this for me is critical on a BLT. bacon alone I can do a little softer but it needs some crunch somewhere. but pulling out a long slice of soft bacon on your first bite of a BLT? it makes me so angry I will go smack the cook in their blabber mouth
tonightsdinner,3dm7jd,amaefm,2,Fri Jul 17 21:26:53 2015 UTC,"There is a restaurant in Birch Run, MI called Tony's.  They deep fry the bacon I'm pretty sure.  Also, the BLT has a pound of bacon on it.  When you order a breakfast with bacon as a side, you get a pound.  Obviously you end up with a lot of extra bacon to take home.  We froze it and used it to make breakfast egg muffins, but I digress.  Tony's is great, pounda bacon. And it's crunchy."
tonightsdinner,3dm7jd,emkay99,4,Sat Jul 18 02:06:12 2015 UTC,"Would you do that to it if it were a slice of ham? When you cook bacon to a crisp, you lose most of the flavor."

tonightsdinner,3dkwhx,iBird,3,Fri Jul 17 02:33:13 2015 UTC,"I'm constantly inspired by other's cooking and sometimes I just want to show off some of my very own recipe/rubs, even if they aren't anything amazing. I'm always open to suggestions, criticisms too. This is something I'm trying to perfect, but not enough people are eating it... Anyways, wall of text incoming. No money shot because it simply didn't present as well.  I got sweet deal on bulk trip-tips, which came with 5 in the package. I marinated 1 of them in a simple Teriyaki sauce with just a bit of mixed ginger in fridge for two days. I cooked this one over a higher heat for about 3-4 mins, rotating 90 degrees or so and cooking for another 3-4 then flipping and doing the same. I basted the meat a few times per turn with more of the marinade which cause flair ups, which was good, but it also added a nice glaze towards the end of the cook. Once this one was seared to my liking I moved it off the direct heat, with the fat side up and thick side towards the fire, but not touching it. I topped with sesame seeds just for looks, but I also love em. This was insanely tender and juicy, but as expected, this was easy mode.  Now for the other guy! This was my very own Frankenstein's monster typa thing. I got bored with my last tri tip being just a traditional Santa Maria style cook. Don't get me wrong, it's good like that, but it's so common and I've had that flavor profile so many times before. I still like the concept of it because I love garlic so much, but I had a couple things on hand to make it a little different. This one was cooked completely indirectly the entire time, it was actually put on about 45 mins earlier than the Teriyaki one because it was not only bigger but was not going to be heated via direct flame for any type of sear. This means I need to watch the internal temp much closer but at the same it develops a stronger coating of the rub I used on the outside. Some call this the ""bark"" but for this type of cook, it really wouldn't be considered an actual bark. The idea was I wanted to keep as much of my own rub on it because this turns more into a roast than ""steak."" This one took a bit more prep work but it was worth it and I really liked the unique style of it. Here is the breakdown:  Before I did anything, I coated and massaged the meat with kosher salt and let it sit in the fridge for an hour or so. Then after putting it out to get to room temp before putting on the grill I created my own marinade/rub/puree/coating, whatever it is called. I used an entire head of garlic, some paprika, a small amount of olive oil, a tiny tiny bit butter and a fair amount of fresh cracked pepper. I then squeezed basically an entire small lemon's worth of juice in it.... Perhaps it was an odd combo, but here is the thing. I got a bunch of fresh Ghost Peppers and super hot Chili from my awesome co-worker, Carlos. These things are SUPER hot so I grabbed 1 ripe, 1 unripe ghost pepper and the same with the chilies and food processed them into a very slatherable and firm consistently so it would stick well to the meat. Then I basically left this alone until the internal reached 135 for a medium. I've been cooking these more rare or med-rare, so I thought I'd just try it a bit more to see how bit of a difference it made. I think I may of liked it more on the medium side, which really surprised me since I eat a lot of steak rare/medium rare.   wow this is super long, I think I should probably stop thinking about meat all the time or something...  PS this was all done on my Weber kettle grill using a thermapen and also a shitty oven thermometer on the meat rack for an idea of its temp.  If anyone has any questions about doing 2 zone style cooking I'd more than happy to help, I've got a bunch of fresh knowledge/experince in my head right now while learning smoke/BBQ more on my Weber kettle, which btw is awesome."

Spread the tortilla strips in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet.  Spray the strips with cooking spray, flipping to coat both sides, and sprinkle with salt.  Bake for about 15 minutes, or until crisp, stirring the strips halfway through baking. (I found this to be way too long and they were done when I checked on them after 7 minutes!)  Add the chicken broth, chicken breasts, 2 of the onion quarters, 2 garlic cloves, cilantro and oregano to a large Dutch oven.  Bring to a simmer over high heat then cover, reduce heat to medium-low and cook until the chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes.  You can verify the chicken is cooked with an instant read thermometer – it should be at least 160 F.  (took me about 45 minutes, not 20)  Transfer the chicken to a cutting board, and when it is cool enough, remove the meat from the bones and shred with two forks.  Strain the liquid in the pot into a clean bowl – discard the solids. (My cat meowed at me the whole time I was shredding the chicken)  In the bowl of your food processor, process the last 2 onion quarters, 2 garlic cloves, tomatoes and chipotle chiles until smooth.  Set your Dutch oven over high heat and add the oil.  When the oil is very hot, add the pureed mixture and cook, stirring often, for about 10 minutes, or until the mixture darkens in color.   Add the strained broth back into the Dutch oven with the pureed mixture and stir to combine.  (try to scrape off any black bits that have formed on the bottom of the pot now or you'll be scrubbing pots for the next 2 days!)  Cover the pot and simmer for 15 minutes.  Add the shredded chicken to the pot and continue to cook until the chicken is heated through, about 5 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.   Place tortilla strips in the bottom of the bowls, then ladle soup over the top.  Garnish and serve."

Now the ""tart"" you made there has none of the 2 defining ingredient.  I would have said nothing about the filo pastry, it would have been an unconventional quiche but OK.  But without the egg-cream custard it really does not make sense to call this quiche.

tonightsdinner,3d803a,skreezelbee3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:50:05 2015 UTC,This looks delicious! Can you share your recipe?
tonightsdinner,3d803a,NerdsWithKnives,2,Tue Jul 14 17:04:48 2015 UTC,"Of course! I'll try to be concise... :)  Cover 1/3 c. yellow lentils, 1/3. quinoa, and 1 c. split black lentils with water and cook until the water has been absorbed/evaporated. Toss in some peeled, minced fresh ginger. Cover again with vegetable stock, cook it down, etc. Do this until the grains are as tender as you like them. Season as you like; I used salt and pepper.  For the bok choy, mince 3 cloves of garlic and 1 shallot, then sauté in oil or butter until tender and just beginning to caramelize. Lay quartered bok choy in a single layer on top, then cover for 3-5 minutes. Flip them over, cover again, and check for doneness. I like the greens to be wilted but the stalk to still be crisp; it takes me about 8 minutes.  Steam the ears of corn (husk on) by whichever method you like. I used my microwave, cooking 2 ears at a time for 3 minutes, although I much prefer using my outdoor grill. Let the ears cool in their husks before shucking.  While they're steaming, mix together 1/3 c mayo, 1/3 cotija cheese, queso fresco, or feta, cayenne, and 1 minced clove of garlic. Spread this mixture on the shucked corn then top with cilantro and chili lime seasoning (I love tajin for this).   The sauce was last minute but totally delicious. I deglazed the bottom of the bok choy pan with some vegetable stock, hoisin sauce, and sriracha, and then reduced it. I poured it mostly by the grains, as per the picture, but ended up eating everything with it. So good."

tonightsdinner,3d4vfm,discoverycook,3,Mon Jul 13 15:22:50 2015 UTC,"Red Beans and Rice is Creole cooking, melding together the influences of France, Spain, the Caribbean, Africa and who knows where else. It's a classic New Orleans dish.  Recipe:  Ingredients:   2 lbs. pork shoulder, bone-in, cut into two-inch cubes 1 medium yellow onion, diced 4 Tbsp. butter 4 Tbsp. Cajun seasoning (I use Mangia.tv Sweet Cajun Dry Rub) Pinch of cayenne pepper 2 cups water or stock (I use chicken or veal stock) 1 red onion, diced 1 bell pepper, diced 2 stalks of celery, diced 2-3 cloves garlic, minced 1 lb. dry red beans (kidney beans are fine), washed and picked clean of any debris 1-2 andouille sausages, sliced and sauteed in a tablespoon of butter for garnish (optional) 2-3 spring onions, chopped, for garnish (optional)   Preparation:  Cut up the pork shoulder and trim away from the bones. Reserve the bones and toss the pork cubes with 2 Tbsp. of your favorite Cajun  seasoning and a pinch of cayenne, if desired. Set aside in a glass or plastic bowl.  Melt 2 Tbsp. of the butter in a heavy dutch oven over medium heat and when it quits foaming, add the yellow onion and cook until soft and translucent.   Add the pork and brown well on all sides over moderately high heat. Work in batches, if necessary.  When the pork is browned, add all of it back into the dutch over along with the bones, add the water or stock, bring to a boil, and stir until all the browned coating in the pot is dissolved.  Reduce heat to a simmer, cover and cook for about 90 minutes, or until the pork pulls abart easily with a fork.  When the pork is done, set aside in a large bowl, reserving liquid separately.  Using the same dutch oven, melt the remaining 2 Tbsp. butter and add the red onion, bell pepper and celery and another 2 Tbsp. of cajun seasoning. Cook until vegetables begin to soften.   Add the garlic and cook for an additional minute.  Add beans, pork, and two quarts (64 oz.) water to the dutch oven, bring to a full boil while stirring, then reduce heat to a low simmer, cover and cook for about 90 minutes or until beans are just tender.   Taste and season with salt and pepper.  Remove cover, use the back of a large spoon to break up some of the beans, stir and cook for an additional 30 minutes, uncovered to allow some water to evaporate and the liquid to thicken.  While the beans finish, bring two cups of long grain white rice and four cups of water to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until rice is tender and the water has been absorbed. (I like to add and pat of butter and a little salt to the rice while it cooks, but that's optional).  Serve by putting a serving of rice on a rimmed plate and top with the beans and thickened liquid. Top with sauteed sausage and/or green onions.  Full printable recipe at http://www.discoverycooking.com/red-beans-and-rice/"

Finally place in some bread crumbs that are seasoned with salt and pepper and press to coat. Fry in some vegetable oil and cook for two minutes on each side.

tonightsdinner,3cqwdk,sareptile,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:58:06 2015 UTC,"They are great for nearly any chicken dish but you have to like dark meat chicken. You can cut them in pieces and use for stir fry, you can roast them, fry them and even braise them. They're way more forgiving than breasts as far as overcooking is concerned and they're usually way cheaper than breasts.   I love to braise them in wine with onions, mushrooms and garlic. Just the other day, I  seared some boneless thighs in bacon fat then braised them in white wine with onions, mushrooms, garlic and thyme for about 40 minutes. I removed the chicken, added some capers and reduced the wine a bit. Added some cream, reduced a little more then added the chicken back to warm through. It was absolutely delicious over rice."

tonightsdinner,3cqkzn,blackk_ice,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:44:50 2015 UTC,"That lamb looks delicious, what did you use for seasoning?"
tonightsdinner,3cqkzn,netllama,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:53:30 2015 UTC,"salt and pepper...a little vegetable oil in the pan. That's it.  I topped it with a lemon, rosemary and garlic sauce, but that was after the picture was taken.  The trick for the nice brown sear is put a couple tbs oil in the pan, heat it on medium high until it's fully heated. Pat the lamb very dry with a paper towel. Really push the paper towel down firmly, to make sure you get up all the surface moisture. Put some salt and pepper on it, and put it in the pan.  Don't move it. Don't lift it up and check on it. Don't jiggle the pan because you're afraid it's going to stick. Leave it alone for three whole minutes. Flip it and do the same for 2 more. (3 more if you don't like the middle to be rare)  The lamb chops are the easiest part of this dish.  If the surface of the lamb is moist, it won't brown (because the moisture steams instead). If you lift it up or move it around a bunch, it won't brown as nicely, because you lose heat every time you do that."

tonightsdinner,3cpdhm,discoverycook,2,Thu Jul 9 18:24:49 2015 UTC,"Eggplant stacks are one of my favorite ways to make use of the amazing fresh eggplants that show up at the local farm markets. Especially good with sauce made from freshly picked tomatoes.  Recipe:  Ingredients:   2 large eggplants (aubergine), peeled Olive oil 1 lb. ground lamb 1 tsp. cinnamon 2 tsp. cumin Salt and pepper to taste 1 large onion, diced 3 Tbsp. shallots, minced 3-4 cloves garlic, minced 4 cups homemade tomato sauce (or 1 28 oz. can) 1 cup mozarella cheese Parmesan cheese for garnish   Preparation:  Slice eggplant into quarter inch rounds and trim to roughly equal diameters. You should have about 16 slices. Brush the rounds with olive oil and grill until they're just beginning to soften. Set aside on a warm plate.  Saute the onions in a tablespoon of olive oil until translucent and soft, but not browned. Set aside.  Saute the ground lamb in the pan where the onions were cooked, breaking it into small pieces with a wooden spoon. Season with cinnamon and cuymin while it's cooking. When the lamb is pretty much cooked through, remove from heat.  Preheat oven to 375F.  On a rimmed baking sheet covered with foil, assemble the stacks, starting with a slice of grilled eggplant. Top that with a layer of lamb, followed by another slice of eggplant, a layer of cooked onion, eggplant, mozarella, and top with another slice of eggplant. Bake at 375F for 15-20 minutes, or until cheese is melted and eggplant is tender.  Meanwhile, saute the minced garlic in a little oilive oil and add the tomato sauce. Simmer until eggplant stacks are finished baking.  To serve, ladle tomato sauce on the plate. gently place an eggplant stack in the sauce and drizzle additional sauce over the stack. Sprinkle a little parmesan cheese on top and serve immediately.  Full printable recipe at: http://www.discoverycooking.com/grilled-eggplant-stacks/"

I had this same dish at a conference dinner which was amazing and just can't figure out how they got the mash potato so creamy. I haven't been able to replicate and your picture is exactly what we had at the conference.
tonightsdinner,3cod9z,zeke77,2,Fri Jul 10 01:11:03 2015 UTC,Sure. I had the Ninja Blender which has triple blades. When I realized it wasn't going to turn out as pancakes is when I added a little bit of milk and chives. Keep in mind my potatoes already had butter mixed in the night I scooped the pulp out.

I had baked potatoes from the other night, took all the pulp out and was planning to make potato and onion pancakes the next morning with bacon. Followed a recipe and used my blender. It didn't fry well, so it looked liked mashed potatoes at this point so I threw in chopped chives from my garden. It turned out be too sweet from the Vidalia onions so it set in the fridge for a few days. Then when I made the salmon I got a great idea and said to myself why don't I lay this on top of the mashed like all those fancy restaurants? Sometimes accidents are the best creations."

I started with onions and carrots seasoned and cooked them for a little bit then added ground Italian pork sausage,  browned then drained the fat.  I added some garlic, crushed red pepper and dried herbs (oregano, parsley, basil) stirred around then I deglazed with just a little balsamic vinegar (I didn't have any red wine) then I added a large can of crushed tomatoes and cooked it for hours. I added more seasoning as needed.  Tonight I just boiled the pasta to al dente, then added the meat sauce, and part of a tomato that I had in the fridge chopped and seeded, mixed and topped it off with a mixture of mozzarella, Monterey Jack and Romano cheese.  Covered and baked for a half hour or so and then uncovered and baked for about ten more minutes.  I topped it with some chopped fresh herbs and green onion.

Drizzled the steak with olive oil and rubbed generous amounts of salt and pepper all over it (including the sides)  Pulled the cast iron out and put on the stovetop on high heat until smoking and put the steak in.  2 mins each side, and 1 minute on the fattier edge.  I put a large pat of butter on top and in the oven it went for 5mins. I flipped it once while in there. And it cooked for about 4 more mins - the Internal temp was 135°f and I pulled it back on the stove top on high heat again.    Another large pat of butter, tarragon sprigs, and smashed garlic on top and basted it constantly for about 1 min - then repeated again on the other side.  Steak hit 142°f and I let it rest for 10mins.  It rose to 150°f while resting.    Served with homemade fries.

tonightsdinner,3cb2io,AgDrumma07,9,Mon Jul 6 14:52:28 2015 UTC,"Here is the recipe from Budget Bytes.  I followed it pretty much exactly except I used fresh veggies for the seasoning mix instead of frozen.  I also included chopped chicken thighs for extra protein and omitted the cup of water because every time I try these “one pot” recipes, they end up too watery and I have to simmer a bunch at the end.  Freakin delicious!  Enjoyed with a Firestone Walker Union Jack.  Prep time - 10 mins   Cook time - 35 mins   Total time - 45 mins   Total Cost: $9.10  Cost Per Serving: $1.14 (1.25 cups each)  Serves: 8 (1.25 cups each)  Ingredients   1 Tbsp vegetable oil $0.02 ½ lb. smoked sausage (preferably Andouille) $3.67 2 cloves garlic $0.16 1 10oz. bag frozen ""seasoning mix"" $1.39 1 15oz. can diced tomatoes $0.79 ½ Tbsp Creole seasoning 0.15 ½ tsp oregano $0.05 ½ tsp smoked paprika $0.05 ¼ tsp thyme $0.02 Freshly cracked pepper $0.05 2 cups chicken broth $0.24 1 cup water $0.00 1 lb. penne pasta $1.49 2 Tbsp half & half or cream $0.19 ½ bunch fresh parsley $0.45 ½ bunch green onions $0.38   Instructions   Slice the smoked sausage into thin rounds, then cut any larger pieces in half. Add the sausage and vegetable oil to a large pot and cook over medium heat until the sausage is well browned (about 5 minutes). Mince two cloves of garlic and add them to the pot. Sauté for one to two minutes, or until the garlic is soft and fragrant. Add the bag of frozen seasoning mix and sauté until heated through (3-5 minutes). Finally, add the can of diced tomatoes (with juices), Creole seasoning, oregano, smoked paprika, thyme, freshly cracked pepper (about 20 cranks of a pepper mill), chicken broth, 1 cup of water, and pasta to the pot. Stir until everything is evenly combined. Place a lid on the pot and turn the heat up to medium-high. Let the pot come to a boil. As soon as it reaches a boil, remove the lid briefly to stir, then replace the lid, turn the heat down to low, and let the pot simmer for 12-15 minutes, or until the pasta is tender. Stir the pot once every few minutes as it simmers to prevent the pasta from sticking. Replace the lid as quickly as possible after stirring to avoid heat loss. While the pasta is simmering, pull the parsley leaves from the stems and give them a good chop, and slice the green onions. Once the pasta is tender, most of the liquid in the pot should be absorbed. If it's still a bit soupy, let the pot simmer for one to two minutes without the lid to allow some moisture to evaporate. Turn off the heat and stir in the half & half or cream. Stir in most of the chopped parsley and green onions, reserving some to sprinkle over top. Serve hot with a pinch of fresh parsley and green onions on top of each bowl.   Notes  *The ""seasoning mix"" used is a pre-chopped and frozen blend of onion, bell pepper, and celery, also known as ""trinity"". If you prefer to use fresh, chop one yellow onion, one green bell pepper, and two stalks of celery.  **Creole seasoning can be found in most major grocery stores, but you can make your own using this blend of spices. Store bought Creole seasoning blends usually contain a lot of salt, so you may need to add extra salt to the final product to compensate."

tonightsdinner,3c9oy2,FreePatArthur,2,Mon Jul 6 04:48:38 2015 UTC,Did you make this yourself?  I'd love the recipe . Looks delicious.
tonightsdinner,3c9oy2,FuckingGalaga,3,Mon Jul 6 06:25:51 2015 UTC,"For the dumplings, basically you get about a cup of water simmering with some butter and salt and add 1/2 c cornmeal and mix and mix and mix until it starts pulling away from the sides of your sauce pan.  Turn that mixture out into a bowl and add a beaten egg, and a half a roasted jalapeno that you seeded and de-membraned.  To roast a jalapeno, just put it on a sheet pan and under your broiler until it gets nice and blister-y on all sides. You'll have to turn it for even cooking. Then put it in a plastic bag and seal it. Let it sit for a couple minutes, and the skin will loosen up.  SO now that you've added the egg, and the jalapeno, and maybe some cheese, because why not, get a bigger pot of water simmering. I used a scoop because I was at work, but if I were home I would have just used a tablespoon to portion out and shape the dumplings. Drop them in the simmering water, and let them simmer until they start floating to the top. Probably 4-5 minutes.  After that I just heated up some butter and browned them in that until that crust formed, on that GBD (Golden brown, and delicious) tip.  The sauce was just some butter, garlic, and shallot sweated out and deglazed with some white wine. Then I added about the adobo sauce and a couple chopped up chipotle peppers, then some cream, and then that reduce. Just keep tasting and adding peppers/sauce until you get the heat/smokiness/taste you want.  The rub was something close to:  1 T finely ground espresso  1 T ancho chili powder  1 t cumin  1 t mustard powder  1 T dark brown sugar  2 t cumin  1 t cayenne pepper  1 t dried oregano  Salt  Pepper  Something like that. Also some smoked paprika. Go with how you like things. It'll taste better that way, I bet."

tonightsdinner,3c8ptf,pleth0ra,2,Mon Jul 6 01:17:23 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry I don't have a formal one, I just kind of put it together. But here's basically what I did:  -In a large frying pan, put uncooked sliced sausage over medium heat with about a tablespoon of olive oil. Cook thoroughly until browned. Remove from pan and put to the side.  -In the same pan on the same heat, cook 1 thinly sliced shallot and 3 minced garlic cloves until the shallot slices are translucent. Add thinly-sliced summer squash(as many as you want -- I used 4 small ones) and cook until soft. Season with salt and pepper. Add the sausage back to the pan with the veggie mix.  -Reduce the heat to low, and keep heated until your pasta is done cooking (I add a LOT of salt and oil to pasta whole cooking because I think it makes it more flavorful.) drain pasta, toss with olive oil, and plate. Top with grated Parmesan, salt and pepper (if desired) and then add the veggie/sausage mix on top.   I think the real key is to use really good sausage, as that's a main flavor, and the first one you taste. But otherwise I always find the great thing about pasta dishes is the fact that you can easily meld it to your tastes.   I hope this helps! Sorry about the formatting, I'm on the mobile app."

Dissolve 3/4 teaspoon salt and baking soda in 2 teaspoons water in medium bowl. Add pork and fold gently to combine; let stand for 10 minutes. Add 1/2 teaspoon garlic, 1/4 teaspoon rosemary, nutmeg, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper to pork and stir and smear with rubber spatula until well combined and tacky, 10 to 15 seconds. Transfer pork mixture to greased plate and form into rough 3-inch patty. Pulse mushrooms in food processor until finely chopped, 10 to 12 pulses. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add patty and cook without moving it until bottom is browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip patty and continue to cook until second side is well browned, 1 to 2 minutes longer (very center of patty will be raw). Remove pan from heat, transfer sausage to cutting board, and roughly chop into 1/8- to 1/4-inch pieces. Transfer sausage to bowl and add cream; set aside. Bring 2 quarts water to boil in large Dutch oven. Add pasta and 1 tablespoon salt and cook, stirring often, until al dente. Reserve 3/4 cup cooking water, then drain pasta and return it to pot. While pasta cooks, return now-empty skillet to medium heat. Add 2 teaspoons oil, mushrooms, and pinch salt; cook, stirring frequently, until mushrooms are browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in remaining 1 teaspoon oil, remaining garlic, remaining ¼ teaspoon rosemary, and ¼ teaspoon pepper; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in wine, scraping up any browned bits, and cook until completely evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in sausage-cream mixture and 1/3 cup reserved cooking water and simmer until meat is no longer pink, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove pan from heat and stir in Pecorino until smooth. Add sauce, parsley, and lemon juice to pasta and toss well to coat. Before serving, adjust consistency with remaining reserved cooking water as needed and season with salt and pepper to taste."

Make it like how you make normal risotto with gradual addition of chicken stock  The Sautéed mushroom: Butter + shallots + garlic + salt + onions + mushroom of your choice (I used chanterelle). You can mix it with the rice to make mushroom risotto. Roasted veggies: Oil + Garlic + salt + a dash of balsamic vinegar. I used multi colours carrots and asparagus. You should pre steam the carrots because they don't cook the same. Bake for 15 mins at 350 F. I'm too lazy so I baked it with my chicken and overcook it.

tonightsdinner,3c1ue9,IAmNotAChef,7,Fri Jul 3 23:57:24 2015 UTC,"For the WINGS:   12 wings, wingette and drumette attached.    3 pints Peanut Oil  For the SAUCE:  1 stick un-salted butter / 1/2 cup / 8 TBSP  2/3 cup Frank's Red Hot Sauce  1/2 tsp smoked paprika  1/2 tsp sugar  1/4 tsp Worcestershire sauce  1/4 tsp cayenne pepper  (this is where you control the heat.  Less for milder, more for hotter)  1/4 tsp garlic powder  1 egg yolk*** The difference maker  Instructions:  1-Heat oil in wok to 400°F  2-Dump in the wings at once.  The oil will drop in temp to around 200-220f but keep the burner on high as it will creep up in temp and slow fry the wings.  This keeps the wings super juicy and still crisps the skin up really good. Takes about 14-16 mins  3-In a pot, on low heat, melt the butter.  Whisk in 2/3 cup of Franks.  Add in the rest of the sauce ingredients.  Whisk to combine.  Take off heat and place sauce pot next to the wok.  4-Remove wings with the spider strainer or slotted spoon and place in mixing bowl.  Pour sauce over wing and mix them with a spoon, swirl them around, or do whatever it takes to combine the two. Set off to the side.  5-Now comes the hard part.  Take a deep breath and then slide the egg yolk into the mixing bowl and as soon as you do, you will need to whisk like your life depends on it.  I mean, whisk like the devil is making you create butter from cream by hand in 30 seconds.  You want to aerate and cool down the wing sauce so the egg doesn't scramble - instead, once combined, it creates this incredibly luscious, creamy, wing sauce.  It takes about 20-30 seconds of really intense whisking  6-blanket the wings in the sauce   Full breakdown/instructions and more pictures"

I'm a vegetarian so this time I put kale, navy beans, cheese, carrot, onion and homemade bbq sauce, but it can really be anything and would most definitely work well with meat in it too. Just don't have a filling that's too liquidy or else the inside dough may not cook well   Make a double batch of bannock dough. Roll out half into a cast iron pan with the edges up (sorta like a pie crust). Put in the filling. Top with the other rolled out half of the dough and tuck the edges of this one under the bottom of the other dough layer. I cook it on the bbq about 5 minutes, flip, then 5 more minutes. I assume it would also work in the oven with a greater cooking time of course."

Dijon mustard 2 Tbsp. cumin 2 Tbsp. olive oil 2 -3 cloves garlic, minced   Grill-Roasted Potatoes:   1 lb. Small yukon gold potatoes 1 Tbsp. Italian seasoning blend (Basiks)   Grilled Endive Salad:   1/2 cucumber, diced 4-6 Oz. cherry tomatoes, halved 1/2 red bell pepper, diced Salt and pepper 2 Tbsp. olive oil, plus more for basting 2 Tbsp. lemon-infused white balsamic vinegar (Basiks) 2 Belgian endives, halved Thinly sliced radishes, for garnish Olive oil   Directions:  Chicken:  Pat chicken dry with paper towels, sprinkle with salt and freshly ground pepper.  Mix together the pomegranate molasses, Dijon mustard, cumin, olive oil, and garlic.  Brush the chicken thoroughly with the mixture and allow the chicken to marinate for an hour or more, refrigerated.  Add a little more pomegranate molasses to the remaining marinade to make the baste.  Grill over hot coals for until chicken is cooked through, turning and basting several times to prevent the glaze from blackening.  Grill-Roasted Potatoes:  Boil the potatoes for 10-15 minutes or until just fork tender.  Rinse with cold water and slice potatoes in half.  Arrange on a foil covered baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil, stirring to make sure the potatoes are evenly covered.   Sprinkle with Italian seasoning (or your favorite) and place the baking shee on the grill over indirect heat, covered, for about 15 minutes, or until they begin to brown and crisp up.  Grilled Endive Salad:  Mix the diced cucumber, tomatoes, bel pepper, olive oil and balsamic vinegar, sprinkle generously with salt and pepper and refrigerate for 30 minutes or more.  Brush the endive halves with oil on all sides and grill, turning frequently, until tender (about 15 minutes). Brush with additional olive oil, as needed, during the grilling.  Place the endive halves on a plate, top with cucumber mist and garnish with sliced radishes.  Note:  If you can't find pomegranate molasses, boil some pomegranate juice (about 16 oz.) with 2-3 tablespoons of sugar and boil to reduce until very thick. Be patient. It can take awhile.

tonightsdinner,3bmqok,tacos_pizza_beer,2,Tue Jun 30 23:34:25 2015 UTC,This looks really good! I will definitely try this for a dinner.   How would you adjust cooking with pork shoulder instead of chicken though? That sounds good too. Would it just be a little longer in the oven?
tonightsdinner,3bmqok,inwats,2,Thu Jul 2 02:56:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Pork shoulder is a MUCH bigger piece so it takes a little bit of a different technique I think.

tonightsdinner,3bkly2,intangiblesniper_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:57:01 2015 UTC,I live in Albuquerque. I'm not sure if there's many places to find pho let alone a Vietnamese restaurant. I guess I can look around.
tonightsdinner,3bkly2,AXVDF,5,Tue Jun 30 06:25:44 2015 UTC,"If it makes you feel any better, once one Pho restaurant opens up in your area and people discover it, you will have a dozen of them within 5 years. I've seen it happen in a couple cities. They have whacky names like Pho 2000, Pho 20 10, Pho 2007, and so on.   Usually the quality of the Pho is comparable from place to place; sadly the same thing cannot be said about bubble tea, at least not in my experiences."

tonightsdinner,3bkly2,PainAndSuffering,5,Tue Jun 30 12:37:09 2015 UTC,Hey you  ...give me that  Can you pass me the recipe? That looks so good.
tonightsdinner,3bkly2,PainAndSuffering,3,Tue Jun 30 08:08:18 2015 UTC,"Hey you… Of course I can! Sorry, should've posted it yesterday, just saw rule #4.  Ok… for the broth:  2 yellow onions  4 inch piece of ginger  3-4 pounds of beef soup bones. In my experience, marrow bones are pretty easy to find at your average grocery store. Knuckle bones are usually 2nd easiest. If you want to experiment with different kinds of bones, a butcher or Asian market is your best bet.  *5 star anise  *6 whole cloves  *1 cinnamon stick  1 pound of beef – any cut that will handle a ~2 hour simmer nicely  1-2 tablespoons salt  4 tablespoons fish sauce  1 thumb-sized chunk of yellow rock sugar. It’s usually sold in Asian markets in huge quantities… If you don’t want to be stuck with 5 pounds of rock sugar, regular sugar works fine but don’t tell anyone.  *If you only have ground cloves or ground cinnamon, stop, go to the store, buy the whole kind. Ground spices cannot be strained out of the soup and make it all cloudy and gross.  1) Char the onion and ginger. I usually quarter the onions and cut the ginger in to 3 pieces. More surface area=more char=more flavor  2) Parboil bones. Place them in a large stockpot, fill with just enough water to cover, boil for about 3 minutes. This gets all the gunky crap off the bones and makes your broth clear and pretty. After 3 minutes, dump the bones out, scrub all the stuff out of the stockpot, rinse off the bones, put them back in the pot.  3) Add everything in to the pot, cover with water, bring to a boil then turn the stove on low. Walk away.   4) Wait patiently for 3 hours while your broth cooks. 4 to 5 hours is great if you can wait that long. I usually can’t.  5) After you’ve waited for as long as you can, strain the broth. First through a normal-sized strainer, then through a cheese cloth. Discard the bones or give them to your dog if you’re on the “beef bones are safe for dogs” team. Refrigerate the other beef. You’ll put this in your pho tomorrow.  6) Refrigerate your broth overnight. All of the fat will rise to the top and “harden”, making it much easier to skim off.  For the bowls: This is the fun part. You can put whatever you want in your pho, but my favorites are scallions, cilantro, thai basil, bean sprouts, garlic chili sauce, Sriracha, jalapenos, and lime. Oh, and rice noodles. Lots and lots of rice noodles.   After removing all of the fat from the top of the broth, heat it up on the stove. In the meantime, put noodles, pieces of meat you cooked in the broth yesterday, other thinly sliced beef (put it in the bowl rare – the broth will cook it once added to the bowl), and whatever toppings you desire. Eat 2 large bowls of it, maybe 3, and then lay around your house for the rest of the day like the useless sack of noodles you will inevitably feel like."

tonightsdinner,3bkly2,pasigster,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:10:00 2015 UTC,Most grocery store meat sections will slice it for free for you.  I have them slice meat for jerky and pho all the time.  Look for a bell or a button to ring the meat cutter in the meat section.

Recipe:  Ingredients:  Veal Chops:   4 veal chops, about 1-inch thick Olive oil  1 cup mushrooms, sliced 1 clove garlic, minced 1 cup scallions, sliced 1/2 cup dry white wine 1/2 cup chicken or veal stock Juice and zest from 1 lemon   Corn and Pea Sauté:   2 cups fresh or frozen (and thowed) corn kernels 1 cup fresh peas 3-4 sprigs of fresh thyme, leaves stripped and woody stems discarded 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved   Directions:  Veal Chops:  Heat up a large cast iron pan and add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan.  Working in batches, if necessary, sauté the chops in the oil until well-browned on both sides and the internal temp hits about 130F to 135F. Remove chops to a warm plate to rest.  Quickly sauté the mushrooms, scallions and garlioc until the scallions are tender -- two minutes or so.  Add the wine and stir, scraping up any brown coating on the pan.  Add the stock and lemon zest, the add the lemon juice a little at a time, tasting often, until you get the balance and flavor where you want it. Allow the sauce to simmer and reduce until it readily coats the back of a spoon.  Plate the chops and pour the warm sauce over them. Serve immediately.  Corn and Pea Saute:  While the pan sauce reduces, add a tablespoon of butter to a saute pan and when it begins to foam, add the thyme leaves and sauté until you can smell the aroma of the thyme -- about 30 seconds or so.   Quickly add the corn and peas and continue cooking until tender. About 5-10 minutes.  Add the cherry tomatoes and cook for another minute.  Serve immediately.

Ingredients - Pineapple Chicken Curry     2-4 tablespoons prepared red curry paste - to taste 1-2 cans Coconut Milk - allow cans to sit upright for several hours, do not shake them before use 1 red bell pepper sliced 2 carrots, chopped 1 tomato, chopped and seeded 1-2 green onions, chopped and separated greens from whites 1/2 fresh pineapple or 1 can pineapple chunks, drained 2-3 chicken breasts sliced into thin small pieces a few sprigs of mint or basil, chopped zest of 1 lime juice of 1/2 to 1 lime 1-3 tablespoons fish sauce 1-3 tablespoons of palm or coconut sugar   Add your curry paste and the whites of your green onions to a hot pan over med-high heat with no oil. Stir often while it roasts a little to develop flavor but don't let it burn. Once it becomes fragrant and takes on a nice roasty color, add one can of coconut milk, reserving a bit of the cream from the top of the can for garnishing your finished dish. Stir well to incorporate the curry paste. Add veggies and allow to cook for a few minutes. Add your pineapple, squeezing it to smash juices out of half of it (into your sauce) before dropping it in the pan. Add your lime zest, and one tablespoon each of fish sauce and sugar. Taste, add more fish sauce and sugar to taste. Add chicken. If your sauce is not enough to cover the chicken, shake the 2nd can of coconut milk and add until you have enough. Cover and simmer on med-low for about 10 minutes or until chicken is cooked.    Remove from heat. Add some of your chopped mint, and the juice of half of your lime and stir well. Taste and adjust flavor with more fish sauce/sugar/lime juice.    Serve over rice, garnish with a bit of coconut cream, fresh mint, and the greens of your green onions.

tonightsdinner,3bed2m,buttburglar,4,Sun Jun 28 21:01:38 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind this was just a quick Sunday dinner so I took plenty of shortcuts to save time/money/washing up.  I don't really work with recipes but I'll try to recall what I did:   Shortcut 1: 2 x TOSCANO ""Authentic Italian"" pizza bases (any other premium thin crust one will be OK - even the big Lebanese pita bread would be OK) 1-2 Tbps unsalted butter (I used salted but I would suggest unsalted so the button mushrooms don't leech too much water when you fry them - you can then add salt after they're fried) Shortcut 2: 2-3 Tbps champagne (i was going to use white wine but champagne was already open)  3 big cloves garlic - thinly sliced (i find the flavour is better sliced than crushed)  Black pepper  Salt  Shortcut 3: Thyme - I just used the squeezy tube (4 small squirts)  Fresh parsley - I used an entire bunch of continental parsley (chopped coarsely).   Shortcut 4: Tomato paste (not puree - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato_paste) - I find this gives a more powerful taste compared a tomato puree (I prefer powerful tastes!). Shortcut 5: Cheddar cheese (your favourite one for melting) - I used ""COON"" brand (sorry Americans, but our Australian cheese brand names may offend - FYI: it's an offensive word here also) 20-30 button mushrooms (sliced, stalks removed)   Asian mushroom pack included (approx):   1 x shiitake mushroom 1 x king brown mushroom 2 x wood ear mushroom ~10 x white oyster mushroom   If you aren't familiar with these mushroom names the pictures are here:  http://www.mushroomchef.com.au/mushroom-info/mushroom-varieties/  Method:   I use a stainless pan so I get a fond sticking on the bottom of the pan - then I wash it off with wine/champagne for extra flavour Slice all the mushrooms up - I kept the expensive mushrooms separate from the button ones so I could distribute the 'good ones' evenly over the two pizzas. I fried two batches: 1 expensive ones, 2 buttons Batch 1:   Melt 1 Tbs butter and saute 1 garlic clove (sliced) for 15 seconds Cook until brown edges Season batch 1 with salt and black pepper Move them into a bowl temporarily  Batch 2:   Melt 2 Tbs butter, saute 2 garlic cloves (sliced) for 15 seconds Add mushrooms, thyme and parsley Once the mushrooms are almost cooked wash the fond off the bottom of the pan with the champagne. Continue cooking until mushrooms just start to turn brown  Season batch 2 with salt and black pepper  Cover pizza base with tomato paste Cover with slices of cheese (I don't grate - I am just really good at cutting thin slices of cheese) Cover each pizza evenly with batch 2 Cover each pizza evenly with batch 1 Baked on 180C fan forced for about 15-20 minutes (I prefer to cook at 200 to 220C but our oven is playing up and triggering our circuit breaker at high temps :) yes, I need to call an electrician)."

tonightsdinner,3b1wfs,Reddon666,13,Thu Jun 25 08:26:16 2015 UTC,"I do not have extensive experience with cooking. Being a teenage autistic male, you sort of completely fail to develop some skills. The closest I've gotten to this before was a mandatory semester of Home Economics in eighth grade, and the only thing I can remember from that is that I once managed to make muffins from self-raising flour shrink in the oven.  This is not high class fare. It's a microwaved salmon fillet and a cup of ramen noodles. However, I read this AskReddit thread and took it all to heart, and coated the salmon in as many condiments and spices as possible -- salt, pepper, butter, chives, curry powder, mustard, cumin -- after defrosting. I did something similar with the cup noodles (which I have done pretty much every time I've needed to prepare them in the past as well), adding curry powder, gravy powder, and barbecue sauce to the flavouring packet and vegetables packet.  As far as my unsophisticated palate is concerned, it was pretty great. The salmon was overcooked (that brown part on the edge of the smaller half was really more like salmon jerky), but I love salmon enough to not care and all the added ingredients made it flavourful regardless. Even if it tasted like shit, I'd be overwhelmingly proud of myself for pulling this off. It's not much...but it's the first I've ever really done."
tonightsdinner,3b1wfs,unfitsportsman,4,Thu Jun 25 08:32:13 2015 UTC,"Great start! Add some veggies to your noodles next time to give a bit more colour, flavour and nutrition."

tonightsdinner,3b1wfs,buttburglar,2,Thu Jun 25 08:35:30 2015 UTC,Do you have an oven available or only the microwave? Salmon is really easy to prepare in the oven and it would have a better texture.

My only advice would be to don't go too crazy with random combinations of things (e.g.""salt, pepper, butter, chives, curry powder, mustard, cumin"") as that can be a lot and over-power things.   An added benefit of that, is you will really start to get a sense of the things you like :)"
tonightsdinner,3b1wfs,alphadoublenegative,2,Thu Jun 25 14:40:41 2015 UTC,"Seconded, maybe try to use only one or two spices/condiments (salt+pepper excluded) and maybe keep a notebook or something of flavor combinations that you've tried.

tonightsdinner,3ayktr,discoverycook,2,Wed Jun 24 15:21:00 2015 UTC,"Porchetta is one of my favorite things, which means that I've always wanted to give it a try. I improvised this one, but the result was quite good.  Recipe (serves 4-5 people):  Ingredients   1 pork loin, 6-7 inches long 2-3 inches in thickness 6-7 strips of skin-on pork belly, about 1 inch wide and 1 inch thick Kosher or coarse sea salt Mixed dried Italian seasoning (basil, oregano, crushed red pepper, roasted and crushed fennel seeds, etc.) Baking soda   Directions  Pat the pork loin dry with a paper towel, rub with a generous amount of salt and place on a baking sheet.  Score the skin side of the pork belly strips with a sharp knife, making a cut every inch or so.  Rub the strips with salt and place on the baking sheet with the loin. Refigerate the pork, uncovered, for 24-48 hours.  Remove the pork from the refridgerator and let stand at room temperature for 2 hours.  Preheat oven to 500F.  Season the pork loin all over with the dried herbs.  Wrap the strips of pork belly around the pork loin and secure with toothpicks. Place on a rack in a baking pan.  Using you fingers, spead a thin coat of baking soda on the skin of the pork belly strips (helps with crisping).  Roast the porchetta at 500F for 30 minutes. Pork skin should be well browned and crunchy at this point.  Reduce heat to 350 and cook for another 30 minutes, then check the internal temp with an instant read thermometer. I try for an internal temp of 140-150 degrees. Conintue cooking as needed to reach that temperature.  Remove from the oven, allow to sit for 10-15 minutes and slice just prior to serving.

tonightsdinner,3as8iq,bobovski,6,Tue Jun 23 02:25:17 2015 UTC,"The tortillas are corn, just combine 1 and 3/4 cup masa harina and water until looks right (maybe nearly a quarter cup of water), then form 12 balls of dough, press and cook in a cast iron pan until done. The crispy pork is leftover pork shoulder which was smoked over hickory until the internal temp hit 160F and then wrapped in foil and transferred to the oven until it was 203F. To prepare the pork for the tacos, put in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat and throw in the pork. Wait until it starts to sizzle and add cumin, coriander, cayenne, chili powder, salt and pepper. Let the pork crisp up and then serve on a tortilla garnished with yellow onion, scallion greens, and habanero sauce."

I topped them with crushed toasted peanuts (not shown here, these were the first few I steamed to try them)  Here's the recipe:  Ingredients - Filling:    Mix all this stuff together in a big bowl. Let it chill in your fridge for at least one hour, preferably overnight, then jam it in some wrappers.   1/2 cup minced scallion 1 pound ground pork 1 pound ground chicken 2 tablespoons minced peeled fresh ginger root 1 red or orange bell pepper, minced (about 1 cup) 2 garlic cloves, minced 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon soy sauce 4 tablespoons finely chopped fresh coriander (cilantro) 2 large eggs, beaten lightly   This makes 100-150 depending on the size of your wrappers, so get like 100-150 wrappers.    I used pre-made wonton wrappers, but shumai wrappers would also work, they're the same thing just round.  Look up some youtube videos on how to fold them, it's easy -- don't be intimidated.    Steam those things for 8-12 minutes.    Ingredients - Sauce:    Mix all this stuff in a bowl right before you're going to eat. I make the sauce while the dumplings steam. Double this if you're feeding more than 3 people.     1 tablespoon naam pla (fish sauce) 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1 tablespoon white-wine or rice vinegar 1 teaspoon sugar, or to taste 2 teaspoons minced peeled fresh ginger root 1 tablespoon shredded fresh mint leaves 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh coriander (cilantro)   Top the freshly steamed dumplings with crushed pan-toasted peanuts for garnish."

tonightsdinner,3as7h1,Noobinabox,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:26:41 2015 UTC,"Looks like someone else put in a method. I'll share mine (same concept, different technique)  In the pan where you are cooking the bacon, throw some pasta water in there to cool off the hot oil from the bacon.   Then take the almost-cooked pasta and throw that in the pot or pan of pasta. Add the eggs while continuously stirring on low heat until the water evaporates/egg cooks to the creaminess you desire."

tonightsdinner,3apwm3,discoverycook,2,Mon Jun 22 15:27:01 2015 UTC,"I'm always looking for new ways to dress up a roasted salmon dish. Lemon-dill crusted salmon fits that bill nicely.  Recipe:  Ingredients   1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, grated Zest of two lemons, grated or minced very fine 1 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice 1 Tbsp. Dijon mustard 1 Tbsp. Dried dill, chopped very fine Salt and pepper to taste 1 1/2 Lbs. fresh salmon fillet, cut into four equal pieces Olive oil   Instructions  Start the crust at least 3 hours before making the steaks.  Combine all the crust ingredients and mash together to form a ball about 2 inches in diameter.  Wrap the ball in plastic wrap and form it into a thick cylinder and refrigerate. (You can make this a few days ahead and freeze it).  Preheat oven to 350F.  Brush the salmon fillets with a little olive oil and arrange on a baking sheet.  Roast the salmon filets in the oven until they're almost but not quite done, about 5-7 minutes, depending on thickness.  Slice the frozen crust mixture into 8 equal slices.  Remove the salmon and top each with two pieces of crust mixture.  Switch the oven to the broiler setting and broil the salmon for another 2-3 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.  Remove and serve immediately.  Full printable recipe at http://www.discoverycooking.com/lemon-dill-crusted-salmon/"

tonightsdinner,3am24j,lebrum,4,Sun Jun 21 15:37:11 2015 UTC,Post your recipe! People want to know how you made that delicious dinner you were so kind to share with us. Also guesstimates are okay since we don't all measure our ingredients.
tonightsdinner,3am24j,netllama,4,Sun Jun 21 16:12:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry!  I started out planning to use this recipe: http://cookieandkate.com/2015/thai-green-curry-with-spring-vegetables/  There's no chicken there, though, which I knew I wanted. I wrote down the ingredients I needed from that recipe but forgot to bring the list to the store, so I just got what I remembered, then I pretty much abandoned the recipe. Not sure if what I did was fully correct, but it came out great.  You can use any veggies you like, but I like to stick with a green and red/orange for appearance purposes. Here's what I did:  First I put garlic in the pan with olive oil and some sesame oil and let it get toasty, then threw in the chicken with red pepper flakes and let it cook a bit. After that I added chopped onions and let them get soft before putting in two spoonfuls of curry paste, which I mixed in with everything.  After letting the paste get integrated, I put in the carrots and asparagus and let them get a little soft. Then I added coconut milk, soy sauce, brown sugar, and salt. (You can also use fish sauce instead of soy, which is probably more authentic, but I think it's too fishy and I am a baby.) I brought that to a simmer then lowered the temp for around 30 minutes.  Served over rice with lime and cilantro garnish. I tried out cilantro this time, but I actually prefer basil.  It's actually a fairly simple meal and I've never been dissatisfied with the outcome. Loads of fun and great food! Any suggestions for improvement are welcome, encouraged, and appreciated."

Tarragon butter: 1 stick unsalted butter, 1 bunch tarragon, 1.5 tsp mustard - mix.  Mussel and Potato salad Cook Time: 45 minutes | Servings: 4 servings   Ingredients:  2 pounds mussels, washed and debearded 1 pounds waxy new potatoes, cut int 1/2 inch cubes 1/2 cup dry white wine or water 1/2 cup chopped shallots or red onion 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil 1/4 cup balsamic or sherry vinegar salt and freshly ground pepper 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley, dill, chives or a combination  Directions:  1) Combine the mussels, potatoes, and wine in a broad steep sided skillet or casserole.  Cover and turn the heat to high.  When steam rises from the top, shake the pan once or twice and turn the heat to medium.  Continue to cook until all the mussels open, checking after 5 minutes or so and then every couple of minutes.  When the mussels are done, use tongs or a slotted spoon to remove them to a plate; leave the potatoes in the skillet and re-cover.  2) Cook until the potatoes are almost tender, then remove he cover and turn the heat to high, cooking until most of the liquid evaporates and the potatoes are done.  By this time, the mussels will be cool enough to remove from their shells; do so, putting them in a large bowl.  3) When the potatoes are done, add them to the bowl with the mussels along with the shallots, oil, vinegar, salt and pepper. Taste and adjust the seasonings as necessary.  Serve immediately, an hour or two later, or cold.  Stir in the herbs at the very last moment.  Green Beans with Caramelized Shallots Servings: 4   Ingredients:  1 pounds haricots verts or slender green beans, trimmed 1/2 pound medium shallots 1 tablespoons (1/4 stick) butter 1 tablespoons olive oil 1/8 teaspoon dried thyme  Directions:  Cook haricots verts in boiling salted water until tender, about 4 minutes (or 6 minutes if using green beans). Drain. Transfer to bowl of ice water to cool. Drain well. DO AHEAD Can be made 1 day ahead. Wrap in several layers of paper towels. Seal in plastic bag and chill.  Cut off and discard ends from shallots. Cut shallots lengthwise in half, then remove peel with paring knife. Melt butter with oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallots and sauté 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low; sauté until shallots are browned and tender, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle with thyme. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

If you've never made a cajun jambalaya, that should be next on the menu. Chef John Folse has a great example of one but I would omit the pork and either cut the mushrooms in half or omit them completely. Remember, the color of the jambalaya comes from the browned ""gratin"" on the bottom of the pan. The more you brown your meat, the more flavorful and dark the end resulting dish will be.   Again, looks awesome!  EDIT: Just looked through your post history. You know what you're doing already! I'll just leave this post for anyone else interested in creole/cajun cuisine."

I actually had to go and google what sous vide even is :) All I did was first sautéed radishes, snap peas, and garlic in my pan. Once they were finished, I put them on my plate, but kept the left over oil and garlic in the pan. I then added a little more EVOO, then put the two steaks in the pan for 4 minutes on each side. All I did next was pick them up with tongs and sear the sides for like 10 seconds on each side. I'm really happy with the results- but I didn't do anything special :)"

Turn over and dump in garlic. Let it cook for another 2-3 mins.  Remove garlic and chicken from pan.  2) Chop up onions, and make think slices from half of a lemon.  Dump onions, olives, chili's, and lemons into the pan you cooked chicken in.  Season with salt and pepper and cook until onions have softened.  Squeeze in lemon juice from other half of lemon, pour in chicken stock, throw in the thyme, and scrape all the brown bits stuck to pan.   3) Return chicken to the pan, skin side up along with the garlic.

Recipe:  Ingredients:   2-3 boneless, skinleess chicken breasts, cubed for kabobs ½ cup white miso paste 2 Tbs. fresh ginger, minced 2 Tbs honey 2 Tbsp. white soy sauce (use regular soy sauce if not available) ¼ cup Mirin ¼ cup rice vinegar 1/4 cup chicken stock 1 small red bell pepper 1 small green bell pepper 1 small red onion 1-2 cups fresh pineapple chunks   Directions:  In a 2-quart saucepan, combine miso, ginger, honey, Mirin, chicken stock and rice vinegar.  Gently heat the glaze, stirring frequently, until it begins to bubble. Cook until it reduces by a quarter and begins to thicken, then set aside to cool. (This can be done several days in addvance).  When the glaze is just warm, put the cubed chicken in a glass bowl, add the glaze, stir the chicken so all the pieces are coated with glaze and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.  Thread the  chicken and remaining ingredients on skewers and grill over hot coals until chicken is just cooked through, being careful not to overcook.  Brush with any extra glaze while grilling.

Added flour, (liquid) butter, mix it up, I added some sriracha sauce for colouring, add salt if you want.   You can use whatever you want for the filling really, I added whatever I had in home.   First cook garlic, onion, sweet corn, olives, jalapenos in some olive oil with condiments (salt+pepper+paprika powder). Added some soaked raisins and let is cool down while the bread dough was rising.  After an hour of rising I filled them up like in the video (mine were 3 times as big), added some nice chunks of mozarella and put them in a big pan with boiling water. Used a metal pasta drainer to keep the buns above the boiling water. Be sure to use a piece of baking paper or else the bun will stick tot the metal. Some aluminum foil to keep the steam in, lid on top. Almost an hour steaming (that would be significantly less if you used a real steam pan)."

I may never go back to deep frying walleye.  Recipe:  Ingredients:   Pan Fried Walleye: 2-3 Walleye fillets (about 1 1/2 to 2 lbs.) Flour for dredging Lemon pepper Dried dill Paprika Sea salt 1-2 Tbsp. olive oil 1 cup dry white wine Juice from 1 lemon   Sauteed Spinach:   2-3 Tbsp. Guanciale, diced or cut into small strips 1/2 white or yelow onion, diced 2 cloves garlic, minced 5-6 cups fresh baby spinach   Roasted Red Potatoes:   2-3 cups small red potatoes Olive oil 2 Tbsp. butter 2 Tbsp. fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped   Directions:  Pan Fried Walleye:  Trim and pat the walleye fillets dry. Dust with the lemmon pepper, dill, paprika and sea salt.   Dredge the filets in flour and shake off any excess.   Heat a large frying pan over moderately high heat and add just enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan.  Working in batches, if necessary, place the fillets in the pan, skin side up and fry the fish until golden brown, about 4-5 minutes.   Turn the filets and continue cooking until just cooked through, about 4-5 minutes more.  Remove fish to a warm serving plate and add the wine to the pan, stirring to scrape up any browned residue.   Reduce the liquid by half, add in lemon juice and capers, then allow to cook for another minute or two.   Pour the pan sauce over the fish and serve immediately.  Sauteed Spinach:  Heat a wok or other large pan over moderately high heat.   Add Guanciale to the pan and saute until most of the fat is rendered and the pieces of the meat are starting to crisp.   Add in onions and saute until soft and translucent.  Add garlic and cook for another minute.  Add spinach and saute very quickly, just enough to coat all the leaves with hot fat.  Sprinkle with sea salt and serve immediately.  Roasted Red Potatoes:  Preheat oven to 425F.  Put the potatoes in boiling water for about 10 minutes. Drain, rinse with cool water and cut each potato in half.  Place the potatoes on a lipped cookie sheet, drizzle with olive oil and toss so that all the potatoes are coated.  Bake for 20 minutes at 425F.   Place the potatoes in a bowl, add butter and parsley and toss.  Serve immediately.  Full printable recipe at http://www.discoverycooking.com/pan-fried-walleye/"

tonightsdinner,39ckdp,plastic_soul,2,Thu Jun 11 07:25:33 2015 UTC,"Maillard reaction:       The Maillard reaction (/maɪˈjɑr/ my-YAR; French pronunciation: ​[majaʁ]) is a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars that gives browned foods their desirable flavor. Seared steaks, pan-fried dumplings, breads, and many other foods make use of the effect. It is named after French chemist Louis-Camille Maillard, who first described it in 1912 while attempting to reproduce biological protein synthesis.    The reaction is a form of nonenzymatic browning which typically proceeds rapidly from around 140 to 165 °C (284 to 329 °F). At higher temperatures, caramelization and subsequently pyrolysis become more pronounced.  The reactive carbonyl group of the sugar reacts with the nucleophilic amino group of the amino acid, and forms a complex mixture of poorly characterized molecules responsible for a range of odors and flavors. This process is accelerated in an alkaline environment (e.g., lye applied to darken pretzels), as the amino groups (RNH3+) are deprotonated and, hence, have an increased nucleophilicity. The type of the amino acid determines the resulting flavor. This reaction is the basis of the flavoring industry. At high temperatures, acrylamide can be formed.     Image i - The crusts of most breads, such as this brioche, are golden-brown due to the Maillard reaction     Interesting: Caramelization | Shallow frying | Pot roast | Browning (partial cooking)   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

It's called Creamless Creamy Tomato soup  1/8 cup extra virgin olive oil , plus more for drizzling Cooking Spray 1 medium onion , chopped medium (about 1 cup) 3 medium garlic cloves , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 tablespoon) Pinch hot red pepper flakes (optional) 1 bay leaf 2 (28-ounce) cans whole tomatoes packed in juice 1 tablespoon brown sugar 3 large slices good-quality sandwich bread , crusts removed, torn into 1-inch pieces 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth 2 tablespoons brandy (optional) 1/4 cup chopped fresh chives   Spray cooking spray in Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic, red pepper flakes (if using), and bay leaf (add more cooking spray if needed). Cook, stirring frequently, until onion is translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and their juice. Using potato masher, mash until no pieces bigger than 2 inches remain. Stir in sugar and bread; bring soup to boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until bread is completely saturated and starts to break down, about 5 minutes. Remove and discard bay leaf. Transfer half of soup to blender. (I used a stick blender) Add 1 tablespoon oil and process until soup is smooth and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to large bowl and repeat with remaining soup and oil. Rinse out Dutch oven and return soup to pot. Stir in chicken broth and brandy (if using). Return soup to boil and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve soup in individual bowls.

tonightsdinner,38m9tv,crayfl,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:18:09 2015 UTC,"Very loose recipe:  Boil ~2 servings ofspaghetti in salted water until a little softer than al dente. In the meantime, saute garlic, onion, and red pepper flakes in a large cast iron skillet with a generous amount of olive oil. Drain pasta, put it back in pot and toss with a little olive oil. In a large mixing bowl, beat 6-8 eggs (depending on size of skillet/amount of pasta) in a bowl with a little bit of cream or milk. Whisk in salt, pepper, herbs (either dried or fresh, I used dried basil and oregano, and fresh parsley and rosemary), and coarsely grated parmesan cheese. Add spaghetti to skillet, spread out noodles evenly, and then pour the egg mix into skillet with the noodles. Turn stove to low-medium, and cook bottom of pan for 5-7 minutes, or until edges look crispy and you can lift up the sides of the fritatta with a spatula (the more olive oil in the pan you started with, the better it will turn out). Take entire skillet and put it under your oven's broiler for 2 mins or until the top starts to brown. Add some more grated cheese on top and broil for 30-60 more seconds. Garnish with any extra fresh herbs and serve with a tangy tomato sauce!  Hope that wasn't too hard to follow!"

tonightsdinner,38ddtv,NerdsWithKnives,2,Wed Jun 3 14:16:06 2015 UTC,"If you can find it, get a pork shoulder with the skin on so you can make CRACKLING.  This oven method makes it easy to make this year round. The blog post has more pics and includes the recipes for the Quick-Pickled Red Onions and Sweet and Sour Radishes.  http://nerdswithknives.com/pulled-pork-sandwich-with-pickled-onions-and-radishes/  INGREDIENTS  For Pork Shoulder  1 teaspoon fennel seeds  1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns  1/4 cup course kosher salt plus more  1/4 cup sugar  1 7–8-lb. bone-in pork shoulder (Boston butt or picnic)  1/4 cup apple cider vinegar  1/4 cup (packed) light brown sugar  Freshly ground black pepper  For Sandwich  2 Brioche Buns  2 cups Pulled-Pork  Quick-Pickled Red Onions (http://nerdswithknives.com/quick-pickled-red-onions/)  Sweet & Sour Pickled Radishes (http://nerdswithknives.com/sweet-sour-pickled-radishes/)  Cilantro or watercress  Optional Condiments  Sriracha  Mayonnaise  Cabbage and Fennel Slaw (http://nerdswithknives.com/asian-cabbage-salad/)  Method  IF SKIN IS STILL ON: Place the pork on a clean work surface, skin-side up. Using a small very sharp knife, make scores about an inch apart through the skin into the fat, but not so deep that you cut into the meat. If your cut doesn’t have skin, skip this step.  Crush fennel seeds and peppercorns with the bottom of a heavy skillet, or in a mortar and pestle. Transfer spices to a small bowl; add 1/4 cup salt and sugar. Rub mixture all over shoulder, including in the slits, if skin is on. Place in a large glass baking dish, cover, and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or preferably overnight.  Preheat to 425°F  Take pork out of the refrigerator 1 1/2 hours before cooking and let it come to room temperature. If skin is on, wipe the sugar/salt off with a damp paper towel as best you can (so it won’t burn). If no skin, just brush off any extra salt or spices clinging to the meat. Place the pork, skin (or fat)-side up, in a roasting tray and pop in the preheated oven. Roast for 30 minutes until the skin puffs a bit (or the fat browns).  At this point, turn the heat down to 325°F  Add 1 cup boiling water to pan and cover the pork snugly with a double layer of tinfoil, pop back in the oven and roast for a further 5 hours.  Take the foil off and check the roast. It should be very tender. If the skin needs further crisping, turn the heat up to 500°F and let it brown for 5-10 minutes but watch it carefully so it doesn’t burn! Transfer pork to a rimmed baking sheet; set aside. Strain the fat from the liquid and and pour the de-fatted juices into a small saucepan. Stir in 1/4 cup vinegar and brown sugar and bring liquid to a boil. Cook, occasionally spooning off fat from surface, until a thick, syrupy glaze forms, about 10 minutes (there will be about 1 1/2 cups glaze). Season glaze with salt and pepper as needed; set aside.  For Sandwich  Lightly toast buns. If pork is cold, heat it in a small skillet until warm and crispy and moisten with glaze. Add 1 cup of pulled pork to each bottom bum. Top with a few pickled onion rings and a few pickled radishes. Add a few sprigs of cilantro or watercress and top with other half of the bun."

Butter/ oil for cooking.   Steps  1) melt half the butter and combine it with the other ingredients for the crust into a well formed dough ball. Let it rise for 1-2 hours  2) Punch down the dough and spread it out into a large rectangle  3) Soften and apply the other half the butter to one side of the dough. Then roll it up.  4) Cut it into two parts and flatten it into 2 9 inch pans (i just used 1 large 13 inch iron skillet)  5) chill and let rise for about a hour  6) Cook all the filling ingredients that need to be cooked (steak, veggies, hot dogs)  7) take it out and fill with what you like.   8) bake for 20 mins at 420. (in my case 375 for 1:20 mins)  My filling:  1st layer: mozzarella Cheese   2nd layer: Pasta Sauce, Cheese and Jalapeno Hot dogs, Steak  3rd layer : moreee cheeeseeeee  4th layer: sauteed peppers and onions with pasta sauce  5th layer: more cheeseee again  6th layer: pepperoni with pasta sauce."

Ingredients:  Flank Steak:   2 lbs. flank steak Olive oil 2-3 packets Sazon Goya   Mole:   1 dried guajillo chiles, stemmed and seeded 1 dried ancho chiles, stemmed and seeded 2 dried chipotle chiles, stemmed and seeded 3 cups chicken stock 3 Tbsp. olive oil 1 cup finely chopped onion 3 Tbsp. chopped garlic 1 tsp. dried oregano 1 tsp. ground cumin 1⁄4 tsp. ground cinnamon 3 Tbsp. all-purpose flour 2 ounces dark chocolate, chopped   Directions:  Steak:  Brush the steak with olive oil and rub with the Sazon Goya seasoning.  Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1-2 hours or overnight.  Grill over hot coals until medium rare (130F internal temp).  After a 10-15 minute rest, slice steak across the grain, plate and top with prepared mole.   Mole:  Heat oil in a large saucepan.  Add onion, garlic, oregano, cumin and cinnamon.  Cover and cook until onion is tender.  Add flour and stir to coat the onions. Cook for another minute or two.  Mix in roasted chiles and chicken stock.  Increase heat and reduce liquid by about half.

tonightsdinner,384kpg,mofish1,2,Mon Jun 1 20:28:15 2015 UTC,"Last week's challenge on /r/52weeksofcooking was Fusion.  I wanted to get kinda weird with my experiments, and they turned out surprisingly good!  My favorite version was the Dae Ji Bulgogi/Gochujang Hollandaise, would definitely make again.  The sous vide tea eggs worked well, but were difficult to peel when soft boiled since they werent as firm as hardboiled.    Recipes and whatnot below:  Dae Ji Bulgogi  I followed the ingredients on this page except using belly of course, and grilled it in my cheapo grill basket on a weber kettle.  Took closer to 4-5mins per side, since belly has much more fat to render off.    The second batch I went without the grill basket (and also most of the onions by proxy) and cooked it straight on the grill, since the basket handle was preventing me from closing the lid and the extra air was causing flare ups from all the fat.    Steam buns recipe  This is adapted from the momofuku recipe to use weight instead of volume and worked pretty well.  1tbsp plus 1tsp active dry yeast (~12g)  340g water  512g bread flour +40g extra added during mixing, dough was too wet  75g sugar  75g lard, room temp  16g powdered milk  1tbsp kosher salt (~13g)  rounded 1/2tsp baking powder (~3g)  1/2tsp baking soda (~3g)   Combine the yeast and water in the bowl of a stand mixer outfitted with the dough hook. Add the flour, sugar, milk powder, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and fat and mix on the lowest speed possible, just above a stir, for 8 to 10 minutes. The dough should gather together into a neat, not-too-tacky ball on the hook. When it does, lightly oil a medium mixing bowl or proofing cambro, put the dough in it, and cover the bowl with a dry kitchen towel. Put it in a turned-off oven with a pilot light or other warmish place and let rise until the dough doubles in bulk, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Punch the dough down and turn it out onto a clean work surface. Take off 50g chunks of dough and roll each piece into a ball, and place on a greased baking sheet. Cover the dough balls with a draping of plastic wrap and allow them to rest and rise for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, cut out 25 or so 4-inch squares of parchment paper. Coat a chopstick with whatever fat you’re working with. Flatten one ball with the palm of your hand, then use a rolling pin to roll it out into a 4-inch-long oval. Lay the greased chopstick across the middle of the oval and fold the oval over onto itself to form the bun shape. Withdraw the chopstick, leaving the bun folded, and put the bun on a square of greased parchment paper. Stick it back under the plastic wrap and form the rest of the buns. Let the buns rest for 30mins. Set up your steamer (I used electric). Working in batches so you don’t crowd the steamer, steam the buns on the parchment squares for 10 minutes. Remove the parchment. You can use the buns immediately (reheat them for a minute or so in the steamer if necessary) or allow to cool completely, then seal in plastic freezer bags and freeze for up to a few months. Reheat frozen buns in a steamer for 2 to 3 minutes, until puffy, soft, and warmed all the way through.   Sous Vide ""Poached"" Chinese Tea Eggs  6 eggs  2 black tea bags  2c water  1/2c soy sauce  2tbsp sugar  2 whole star anise  1 cinnamon stick  8 cloves  1/2tsp black peppercorns  1/2tsp sichuan peppercorns  3-4pieces citrus peel  Put everything except eggs and tea in a saucepan and bring to a boil, add tea, remove from heat, and set aside.    Poke holes in the bottoms of the eggs with a thumbtack, this prevents them from cracking.  Bring pot of water to boil, add eggs and cook for exactly 3 minutes.  Remove to a bowl of iced water immediately to shock cool.  Once cooled, crack all over with the back of a butter knife or spoon.  Put eggs and tea mixture in a bag and store in fridge overnight.  Heat water bath to 143F and put bag with eggs and tea in it.  Cook for 45-50mins depending on how long it takes for ambient tea mixture to reach 143F.    Chashu Pork  Mine was leftover from when I made tonkatsu ramen a while back, but it was this recipe, though I cooked it sous vide for a couple days, sorry but I cannot recall the temperature/time exactly, I want to say around 150F/2days.    Hollandaise Infusions  I used this method of making hollandaise, but used lime juice instead.  I split the resulting delicious hollandaise in half.  In one half I mixed in about 1TBS of Hoisin sauce, and in the other I mixed in about 1TBS of Gochujang.  You can just add it to your taste preference, and then serve immediately."

About halfway through cooking (when they're just starting to soften), I'll hit them with a splash of red wine vinegar for the acidity, then follow with balsamic for sweetness. Really good in grilled cheese or macaroni, offsets the richness very nicely."

tonightsdinner,37qebn,mofish1,2,Fri May 29 15:54:55 2015 UTC,"I was recently at Joong Boo Market in Chicago and picked up some korean cooking supplies, as well as some pork belly that I just couldn't say no to.  I've made Dae Ji Bulgogi with loin and shoulder before, but the absolute best version of this dish I've made is with this pork belly.    I followed the ingredients on this page except using belly of course, and grilled it in my cheapo grill basket on a weber kettle.  Took closer to 4-5mins per side, since belly has much more fat to render off.    The second batch I went without the grill basket (and also most of the onions by proxy) and cooked it straight on the grill, since the basket handle was preventing me from closing the lid and the extra air was causing flare ups from all the fat.    Steam buns recipe  This is adapted from the momofuku recipe to use weight instead of volume and worked pretty well.  1tbsp plus 1tsp active dry yeast (~12g)  340g water  512g bread flour +40g extra added during mixing, dough was too wet  75g sugar  75g lard, room temp  16g powdered milk  1tbsp kosher salt (~13g)  rounded 1/2tsp baking powder (~3g)  1/2tsp baking soda (~3g)   Combine the yeast and water in the bowl of a stand mixer outfitted with the dough hook. Add the flour, sugar, milk powder, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and fat and mix on the lowest speed possible, just above a stir, for 8 to 10 minutes. The dough should gather together into a neat, not-too-tacky ball on the hook. When it does, lightly oil a medium mixing bowl or proofing cambro, put the dough in it, and cover the bowl with a dry kitchen towel. Put it in a turned-off oven with a pilot light or other warmish place and let rise until the dough doubles in bulk, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Punch the dough down and turn it out onto a clean work surface. Take off 50g chunks of dough and roll each piece into a ball, and place on a greased baking sheet. Cover the dough balls with a draping of plastic wrap and allow them to rest and rise for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, cut out 25 or so 4-inch squares of parchment paper. Coat a chopstick with whatever fat you’re working with. Flatten one ball with the palm of your hand, then use a rolling pin to roll it out into a 4-inch-long oval. Lay the greased chopstick across the middle of the oval and fold the oval over onto itself to form the bun shape. Withdraw the chopstick, leaving the bun folded, and put the bun on a square of greased parchment paper. Stick it back under the plastic wrap and form the rest of the buns. Let the buns rest for 30mins. Set up your steamer (I used electric). Working in batches so you don’t crowd the steamer, steam the buns on the parchment squares for 10 minutes. Remove the parchment. You can use the buns immediately (reheat them for a minute or so in the steamer if necessary) or allow to cool completely, then seal in plastic freezer bags and freeze for up to a few months. Reheat frozen buns in a steamer for 2 to 3 minutes, until puffy, soft, and warmed all the way through."

tonightsdinner,37nzx0,thebergmaster,4,Fri May 29 15:26:54 2015 UTC,"Well, proper seasoning is the best method long term, however this one is fairly new and isn't seasoned all that well.  I used an ass load of butter all the way around the edges of the pan and on the bottom, more so than I would ever use with a nonstick.  Eggs are tricky in cast iron, even with decent seasoning. I've found that if I cook them on medium to medium low heat, they don't run the risk of sticking, but if I crank it up too high the whites fuse directly to the pan and I practically have to scrape them out.  It's a learning process, but I love cast iron."

tonightsdinner,37bn3l,AgDrumma07,5,Tue May 26 12:59:38 2015 UTC,"The recipe can be found here.  The smashed potatoes and pork chops came out great and I added some steamed broccoli and green beans on the side.  However, I messed up on the apple/onion topping.  I cup up WAY too apples and onions for the skillet I own and, instead of being smart about it and splitting into two batches, I put a lid on the skillet.  So, the apples and onions ended up getting steamed instead of coming out crunchy and caramelized.  It's still pretty good, but not correct.   Ingredients:  1 pound small fingerling potatoes  2 cloves garlic  Kosher salt  4 1/2-inch-thick boneless pork loin chops (5 ounces each)  2 teaspoons chopped fresh sage  Freshly ground pepper  1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil  1 large red onion, cut into 1/2-inch wedges  2 Granny Smith apples, cut into 1/2-inch pieces  3/4 cup apple cider  1/4 cup buttermilk  Directions:  Put the potatoes and garlic in a saucepan, cover with cold water and season with salt. Cover and bring to a boil, then uncover and continue cooking until tender, about 15 minutes. Cover and set aside.  Meanwhile, rub both sides of the pork chops with the sage, and salt and pepper to taste. Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high heat, then add 1 teaspoon olive oil and sear the chops until golden on both sides, about 5 minutes total. Transfer to a plate. Wipe out the skillet and add the remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil. Add the onion and apples and cook over medium-high heat until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and stir in the cider.  Return the chops to the skillet. Cover and cook, turning once, until just cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain the potatoes, reserving 1/4 cup liquid. Return the potatoes to the pan; add the buttermilk and mash, adding cooking liquid as needed. Season with salt and pepper. Serve with the pork chops, onion and apples. Drizzle with the pan juices."

tonightsdinner,37715i,agamedivine,3,Mon May 25 15:01:52 2015 UTC,"Oh there really is no ""fixed"" receipe behind this ... as it was mostly leftovers. The noodles where already cooked and the bacon was left from yesterday. But I'm gonna tell you what I usually do :)   You need: Onions, Brokkoli, garlic, bacon, cheese, pasta and cream.  Just stir some onions, garlic and bacon in a pan. When golden brown, add some cream.  Add salt, pepper and nutmeg. I think nutmeg is the key ingredient in every creamy dish, as it elevates it to a whole new level of deliciousness! Let the sauce simmer on medium to low temperature until it has thickened up. Mix everything in a casserole. I always do several layers of pasta and Brokkoli, which I then cover with the sauce. I used frozen Brokkoli instead of fresh one as it cooks easier. Sprinkle some cheese on top. Put the dish in  the oven at 200-230℃. It's ready to go when the cheese has melted and the bacon has crispend up. Enjoy!"

Not too much, less is more in this case. Then you roast them a bit in a pan for maybe 2-3 minutes on medium heat. Remove the shrimps from the pan and add mushrooms. Turn up the heat and roast them good. They will take some taste from the spiced shrimps. When done with the shrooms roast a toast in the pan which will soak up the remaining herbs and oil. Then put shrimps, mushrooms and the toast together with salad. You can give the salad a light dressing with olive oil, salt and pepper before.  I wish good luck! :)"

Rake them to the side and add a couple tablespoons of butter.   Once that begins to melt add 1 each chopped onion, green pepper, and red pepper.  Mix all together. Sautéed those for about 5 minutes.   Then add two cans of whole kernel sweet corn (drained).  Stir all together.

If anything, this is Tex-Mex, they cook a lot with corn and peppers like that. This isn't anything we ate, and most of the main ingredients are things that wouldn't be very common in Cajun food.  And, actually, I could see this along with some Spanish rice wrapped up in a tortilla with a little sour cream and Mexican blend cheese. It would make an amazing burrito."

tonightsdinner,36mq7u,discoverycook,1 point,Wed May 20 14:53:36 2015 UTC,"A great pork dish can be a challenge, especially when dealing with lean cuts like pork loin. The sous vide approach has changed that for me, forever.  Ingredients   1 lb. pork tenderloin roast 1-2 clove garlic thinly sliced 2 Tbsp fresh rosemary, finely chopped  2 Tbsp fresh thyme, finely chopped 1 Tbsp olive oil Salt and Pepper to taste   Directions  In small bowl, combine garlic, rosemary, thyme, oil, salt and pepper.  Use a sharp knife to make several small deep slits in the pork.  Rub the marinade all over the pork, pushing some garlic slices into slits.  Seal in plastic using a vacuum sealer.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour (overnight is even better).  Bring the sous vide water bath to 57C/135F.  Cook the pork in the sealed bag for 2 hours.  Just before serving, sear the pork on a hot grill or hot cast iron pan for about 45 seconds per side.  Full printable recipe at http://www.discoverycooking.com/sous-vide-pork-loin/"

tonightsdinner,368bi0,MightyLemur,1 point,Sun May 17 03:35:50 2015 UTC,"If you're unfamiliar with Teriyaki, the sauce is super thin and so you wouldn't know it's at the bottom of the bowl. It coats the sticky jasmine rice on mixing!  Recipe:     Cut steak (I used a cheap cut of sirloin) into strips. Combine 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp sake (rice wine), 2t tbsp mirin & 2 tsp sugar in a small pot. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, fry the beef on a high heat. You're looking to give the strips a hint of crisp while not overcooking them on the inside and making them tough and chewy. Place cooked jasmine rice (1/2 cup cooked in 1 cup of water) in a bowl. Top with the beef & teriyaki sauce that should have thickened slightly but still be runny! Top with any veg of your choice, I used a (too tiny) amount of raw carrot and boiled pak choi."

Then I fried the pork until almost all the marinade was completely gone.  Afterwards, I sauteed some minced garlic and red pepper, and added the pork and some leftover rice. You can add a little soy sauce if you want, but I didn't. Whatever marinade was left on the pork worked just fine and added some nice color to the rice.  Then added salt and pepper to taste and then some chopped green onion."

tonightsdinner,35nlbk,CompoBBQ,6,Tue May 12 00:50:42 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, of course!   Just had to clean up the dang kitchen.  :)  Here goes:   1 ea cooked scallion pancake - recipe to follow Sprinkling of chopped cilantro Sprinkling of finely chopped scallions  Layer of very thinly cut deli roast beef. Thin layer of hoisen sauce on surface of pancake (or to taste)   Directions:  Spread the hoisen sauce all over the pancake.   Lightly sprinkle the chopped cilantro and scallion (to taste, of course - lol, like everything in this recipe).     Layer the deli beef on top, roll up and viola!    You can sprinkle the top with some green for appearance - but definitely not needed.    Scallion pancake:   This is an asian recipe and pretty much any scallion pancake recipe  out there should work.  Alternatively, you can purchase pre-made pancakes from your local asian market.     I used this one:   http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/scallion-pancakes-with-ginger-dipping-sauce-recipe.html  Some items to note:   Pay attention to how to roll out the dough (for any scallion pancake recipe, really).    They recommend this for a reason - to get the flakey layers.  This particular recipe uses too much oil - just use a thin layer of sesame oil for the dough.   Just a tablespoon of canola or vegetable oil to fry will be ok as well. The sauce is NOT needed for the beef roll - so just disregard it.    Separately - I normally like to add extra salt and some garlic to the dough.  Adds flavor.  There is a risk factor there if you've never made these, to over salt.   I wouldn't worry about it too much the first time out the door.  So many other flavors going on."

tonightsdinner,35mu55,KhalesiDaenerys,6,Mon May 11 22:50:51 2015 UTC,"So I spent some time researching ""sushi-grade salmon"" and found out that the title is sort of a way for fish markets to make a little extra money. You don't necessarily need to pay more for it, you need to find fish that has been processed in a way that protects it from cross contamination and has been deep frozen for (I think) 7 days. That kills the bacteria that could possibly be found in the fish. If you can find cuts of salmon that meet those criteria, it is ""sushi-grade"" whether the package/fish market says it or not. And believe me, I was extra careful to make sure my fish met those criteria"

tonightsdinner,35mu55,midnightfire26,0,Tue May 12 07:44:32 2015 UTC,"Really, it's that simple? Just buy normal salmon and freeze it for 24 hours?   Edit: yeah, I did some research and this isn't true. Freezing can kill some microorganisms, but certainly not all. Fresh wild salmon is a relatively low risk.   Scary to me that you are suggesting this and work as a sushi chef."
tonightsdinner,35mu55,NerdsWithKnives,2,Wed May 13 00:41:34 2015 UTC,"I would say fresh caught salmon would be slightly more riskier with the parasites and microbacteria.  I prefer the farmed salmon because of the tighter restrictions on it.  As for the 24hrs, it's pretty standard across the board, your risk won't be anymore then eating raw oysters. http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm077331.htm you can read about it there, although it doesn't state a length of time for freezing, after 24hrs it's going to be rock solid.  I believe the most important tip for you as a consumer would be to find a good fish source, like whole foods or your preferable butcher.  For me as a chef we get the whole fish fresh off the boat, so we know exactly how it's being handled and cleaned every step of the way as opposed to buying a small filet from a deli window.

Season with ½ a teaspoon of kosher salt and a few turns of pepper.  2) Brown chicken in olive oil over medium high heat.  3) It does not need to be cooked through at this point, it will continue cooking as it simmers.  4) Once chicken is browned, add minced garlic and saute for about one minute.  5) Add chicken broth, cream, and uncooked pasta to pan and stir.  6) Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a simmer.  7) Simmer for 15-20 minutes or until pasta is tender.  8) Remove from heat and stir in shredded parmesan cheese.  9) Season with salt and pepper as needed.

tonightsdinner,35bftn,NerdsWithKnives,6,Fri May 8 18:33:54 2015 UTC,"Takes only 20 minutes and is my absolute favorite way to make salmon. I like to serve it with quick pickled cucumbers and sliced avocado.  The blog post has lots of pics.  http://nerdswithknives.com/miso-glazed-crispy-skinned-salmon-updated/  PREP TIME: 10 MINS / COOK TIME: 10 MINS / TOTAL TIME: 20 MINS  SERVES: 2 SERVINGS  INGREDIENTS  2 salmon fillets, skin on if possible  3 tablespoons white miso (some miso is GF, check the label carefully)  3 tablespoons honey  3 tablespoons mirin (sweet rice wine) or substitute one extra tablespoon of honey  2 tablespoons soy sauce (or Tamari for GF)  2 tablespoons ginger, grated or minced  2 teaspoons neutral oil (like peanut or canola)  Thinly sliced scallions (optional for garnish)  Toasted sesame seeds (optional for garnish)  INSTRUCTIONS  Preheat broiler to high  In a small bowl, mix together the miso, honey, mirin, soy sauce, and ginger to form a thick sauce.  If you've rinsed it, make sure the fish is very dry. Slather half the sauce on the exposed flesh of the fish, avoiding getting sauce on the skin (or the bottom flesh, if skinless). If you have time, marinate for 10-15 minutes. (If some sauce gets on the skin, just wipe it off a bit before putting it in the pan). Heat 2 teaspoons neutral oil in an ovenproof skillet on medium-high. Sear the fish, skin-side down, pressing the fish flat several times with a spatula so that it lies flush in the pan. Don't mash it to death, but you can use a bit of pressure here. Cook for three minutes, until the skin gets crispy.  Carefully spoon another tablespoon of sauce over the flesh of each fillet. Try to avoid having it drip all over the pan so it doesn't get too smoky. Reserve the remaining sauce for drizzling. Pop the pan under the broiler for 4-7 minutes, depending on the thickness of the filet and how well done you like it (I like salmon medium-rare and found that a 1½ inch thick fillet took 5 minutes). While broiling, watch the fish carefully (the honey burns easily). If it starts to get too dark, move it down farther, away from the broiler.  Serve it with steamed rice or rice noodles.

They make the best pastries I've ever had, but their cheese, though it seems to be genuinely from Mexico, seems to be a really dry and grainy selection. I'll of course keep shopping there because they are my only option. But I've discovered that when I want to do a good enchilada, I have to resort to Tillamook cheese. It's sad really. I am as white as it gets but I grew up in New Mexico and all of the great things I grew up eating aren't readily available. I spent about 3 hours on the phone to Safeway today trying to get them to carry Hatch chili and Tabasco Habanero salsa.

tonightsdinner,34ycpg,dumkopf604,4,Wed May 6 00:00:43 2015 UTC,"Salsa Lizano:       Salsa Lizano, known in English as ""Lizano Sauce"" (salsa means ""sauce"" in Spanish), is a Costa Rican condiment developed in 1920 by the Lizano Company. It is now a product of Unilever. It is a thin, smooth, light brown sauce (akin to such condiments as HP Sauce). It is meant to be used while cooking or at tableside to flavour one's food when serving. It is slightly sweet with a hint of spiciness lent by black pepper and cumin.  The ingredients include water, sugar, salt, vegetables (onions, carrots, cauliflower, cucumbers), spices, pepper, mustard, and turmeric.  Many Costa Rican dishes are prepared with Salsa Lizano, and it is ubiquitous on restaurant tables in its country of origin. It is commonly used with gallo pinto and tamales, and is also considered particularly complementary with eggs, rice, beans, fish, cheese, curries, and as a marinade for meat.

I made a few tweaks like skipping the tomato paste, balsamic vinegar, and sun dried tomatoes so my SO would like them as well.  I would maybe pop them in the oven for 20-30 before frying them.  This recipe only has you frying them and the outsides get nice and crispy but the inside is still kind of an odd consistency.  Other than that, I enjoyed this recipe quite a bit.  I will be making them again!"

I wasn't sure where I'd get a ham hock, so looked for recipes without the bone - there's a few interesting variations, including bacon. I settled for this recipe and picked up a ""smoked loin cut"" from the supermarket, about 700g of ham in it.  Smells like memories and tastes like smoked ham and veg. And that recipe makes a lot of soup - I got about 8 serves out of it, at about AU$4/serve."

tonightsdinner,33yxgn,piedpipernyc,4,Mon Apr 27 00:21:23 2015 UTC,Recipe?
tonightsdinner,33yxgn,vol0623,1 point,Mon Apr 27 06:35:20 2015 UTC,"So this is a bit of my own recipe so I'll type it up here. For simplicity sake I'm going to leave out the potato gnocchi component. Nothing special about them, store bought are fine, fresh/homemade are preferred.  Ingredients:  LAMB SAUSAGE  1lb ground lamb  3 1/2 tsp smoked paprika  1 1/2 tsp salt  3/4 tsp granulated garlic  1/2 tsp fennel seeds  1 tsp fresh ground black pepper  1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes  1/2 tsp cumin  1/2 tsp ground turmeric  (you don't need a casing since we're going to be crumbling this.)  Combine all the spices in a bowl, add the ground lamb to a separate bowl and add in the spices bit by bit to make sure they are well mixed. Place the lamb/spice mixture in a large zip lock bag, force it into the bottom and begin to shape it to resemble a large sausage. force as much air out as possible and begin to roll the sausage in the zip lock bag on a hard surface until you reach your desired shape and thickness. Refrigerate for several hours, overnight will yield the best results. When you remove it you will have a full caseless lamb sausage ready for cooking.   MUSHROOM SAUCE  3 cloves garlic (diced)  1 large shallot (diced)  1/2 cup red wine (merlot)  1/3 cup heavy cream  2 Tbsp unsalted butter  12 ounces mixed mushrooms  1Tbsp Parmesan  Several sprigs fresh thyme  Parsley and Red Pepper Flakes for garnish  Recipe!  Skipping a detailed gnocchi part, please look elsewhere for a guide, I typically start boiling water at step one, add the gnocchi to the boiling water once the cream has been added to the dish, skim from the water as they float to the surface and add to the pan as they are ready. (they can take as little as 45 seconds to a minute to cook)  1.)Heat up some oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat.Add garlic and shallots and cook until translucent (about 3-4 minutes)  2.)Break lamb sausage into several pieces and place in pan, allow it to get a little crispy (2 minutes) flip each piece and allow the other side to crisp up as well. Break them down into smaller pieces with a spatula as needed/wanted.  3.) Add mushrooms and allow them cook down for several minutes, reduce heat and add the butter to the pan. Allow it to melt down.  4.)Add wine and allow to reduce for several minutes over medium/low heat. Add Thyme sprigs and stir to ensure all ingredients are combined.  5.)Reduce heat to low, add heavy cream and stir, add in cooked gnocchi to pan and gently mix to combine all ingredients.   6.)Sprinkle entire pan with Parmesan cheese, place in your broiler on high directly under the flame for 1 1/2 minutes.  7.) Remove from broiler, garnish with red pepper flakes, thyme sprigs, parsley, and parmesan cheese."

It was really good, but maybe a bit sweet for my taste and I would probably throw in a handful or so of basil next time, but overall a good dish, especially if you like goat cheese!   If you like pesto, I would also suggest making it with arugula or asparagus (this is my husband's all time favorite)."
tonightsdinner,33vfrt,BubbalipShabbadoop,1 point,Sun Apr 26 03:19:48 2015 UTC,"Great ideas, I might mix the arugula with asparagus cooked on the cast iron griddle pan so there's the peppery of the arugula and the roasted/charred asparagus flavor."

Put in a strainer and set aside.  In a wok or a saucepan, pour in 4 tablespoons of oil (I used Grape seed oil). When hot, put in the cut beef strips, the chopped bell pepper, and eventually, the veggies. Spice it up with some dried thyme, a pinch of salt, black pepper, and just a sprinkle of curry.  After it is sufficiently fried to your tastes, put in about ½ cup of water and turn up the heat. Pour in the rice that was set aside earlier, and cover the saucepan.  After all the water has dried, turn off your gas cooker and serve. It can be served with chicken and garnished with something like avocado to balance out the taste."

Served with White Asparagus with lemon butter sauce, and Fingerling potatoes cooked in bacon fat.  I took the steak out of the oven at 125 deg. Let it rest for 10 mins, then seared it on cast iron for about 1.5 mins per side.   The sauce was made using this recipe: http://www.morethangourmet.com/our-family-recipes/red-wine-sauce  I added mushrooms to the sauce, so I just took the sprigs out by hand and did not strain it."
tonightsdinner,33n5io,eloflin,2,Thu Apr 23 21:53:17 2015 UTC,Looks great. Perfect cook and sear on the steak. I'll suggest something I love to do with a reverse sear. Try a board sauce. You put it on the cutting board and put the hot seared steak on it to rest. Then when you carve the steak it gets all the warm juices mixed in with the sauce and meat. http://amazingribs.com/recipes/other_fun_sauces/board_sauces.html

Add the carrots, onions, garlic and dried ginger to the pan and turn the flame to medium low heat and cook on medium low for 15 minutes, stirring often, sweating down the onions until they are translucent, careful not to brown the onions, keep the heat low.

I was just thinking of the high salt and saturated fat/cholesterol and how processed it is, increasing your risk for metabolic disease.  EDIT:  Downvoted for what?  It's relevant and I'm just looking out for people's health, and I cite some pretty concrete evidence to back up my point."
tonightsdinner,33fzl1,Julianfrost,2,Wed Apr 22 21:18:23 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for that. I was thinking of making a huge batch of these to eat 2-3x day. Maybe that'd be too much saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium?"
tonightsdinner,33fzl1,Dillweed7,2,Thu Apr 23 00:34:53 2015 UTC,"np.  In my opinion and according to most nutritional guidelines I've seen, yes.  But to eat each* (haha) their own.  Certainly if you're extremely active and well-hydrated, you can handle a lot more salt and sat fat than the average person.  For cost and deliciousness, it's hard to beat though, and I can't imagine it's any worse than any other ""dirty bulk.""  It just depends what your priorities are.  Gains and money now vs heart/metabolic disease risk later.  EDIT: nothing wrong IMHO with putting a different protein in place of the spam (aka sushi).  I think rice and nori are fantastic"

Pretty much everything was done per the recipes, though my mandoline couldn’t do ½” slices for the zucchini, so I went with ¼” instead.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  Scalloped potatoes are one of my favorite foods!  It took longer than expected to cook everything, and my kitchen was a mess the whole time, but it’s always worth it to put a meal like this together.  The beer is from Franconia Brewing in McKinney, TX…one of my favorite breweries.  They brew everything per German Beer Purity Laws making this Kölsch a very comparable beer to the ones I had in Köln last fall and a great pairing for this meal.

tonightsdinner,33hae0,discoverycook,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:51:35 2015 UTC,"The sweet-sour tropical flavor of grilled pineapple, enhanced with a pineapple gastrique makes this dish, which can be prepared with any firm white fish you can find.  Ingredients:  For the Fish:  1 fresh pineapple, peeled, cored and cut into spears  1-2 fish fillets per person (firm white fish such as tilapia, snapper, halibut, sole)  Flour for dredging  Olive oil  1 red bell pepper, diced  1/2 cup red onion, diced  1/2 cup chopped scallions  For the Gastrique:  3/4 cup of sugar   3 tbsp. water  3/4 cup white wine vinegar  1/2 cup pineapple juice  Directions:  For the Fish:  Grill the pineapple spears (or run them under the broiler) until just lightly browned, then cut   into chunks and set aside.  Heat a large frying pan  over medium high heat and add enough oil to cover the bottom.  When the oil is hot, dredge each fillet in flour, shake of excess and add to the hot pan. When the   fish is cooked about half way through (timing depends on thickness) turn the fish and cook   until lightly browned and opaque clear through. Remove to a warm plate.  In a second frying pan, heat a little more oil and quickly saute the onions, peppers and scallions   just until the onions are start to soften.  Put the fish fillets on individual plates, top with the sauteed vegetables, grilled pieapple and the   pineapple gastrique.  Serve immediately.  For the Gastrique:  (This can be made ahead, stored in the refrigerator and rewarmed just before using).  Combine 3/4 cup of sugar and water in a small saucepan.  Heat the mixture without stirring until it turns a nice golden color.   Add the 3/4 cup of vinegar all at once (be careful, the sugar is very hot)  The sugar will crystallizes and looks terrible, but continue to heat and stir it until the sugar   dissolves.   Add the pineapple juice and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook until it reduces by half and is thick   and syrupy.

Such a great recipe.  I really crank up the heat for the chicken. It's messy, but worth it. I heat an iron skillet on medium-high to high heat until it starts to smoke, toss in the oil and quickly add the chicken. The deep dark brown really adds a ton of flavor.  Also, the recipe isn't kidding around when it says to use a lot of pepper. People that don't like a lot of pepper are always surprised when I tell them how much I put on the chicken."

Sprinkle with the flour and toss around until all pieces are well coated.  Heat olive oil, over med.-high heat, in a large casserole type pan and brown the meat. Make sure to not crowd your meat. You may do this in two batches, if necessary.  Add the onion and cook for 1 more minute. Then add the carrot, celery, parsnips and fresh herbs. Cook for another 4 minutes. Add the Guinness and tomatoes and bring to a boil.  Stir and turn down the heat to simmer. Simmer this mixture for about 2 hours or until the meat is very tender. The sauce should be thick and intensely flavored. Season if needed.  To make pies:  Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F.  Put your meat filling into a large, round baking dish. You could also make individual pies. Any high-sided round ovenproof bowl is fine.  Roll out the pastry, dusting with flour as you go, until it is about 1/4 inch thick. Cut out a large circle (or individual circles for smaller servings) - about 1/2 inch bigger than the top of your bowl.  Brush the rim(s) of the bowl with the beaten egg, then place the pastry circle(s) on top, pushing the excess pastry down the outside of the bowl to secure. Lightly score the top of the pastry in a criss-cross manner and brush with more of the beaten egg.  Bake in the middle of the preheated oven for about 45 minutes or until golden and bubbling."

After throwing in some carrots, a good amount of parsley flakes, a moderate amount of thyme and a little tarragon, I leave that on the stove to simmer a couple hours.   Then, I shred up the chicken and throw it back in. Then, I add a little chicken soup base/bouillon to taste before thickening with a little flour (make a paste out of it with your broth before adding to the pot to smooth out lumps. And use like a tbs per 2 cups broth so far?? Not terribly important).   After the flour cooks for a minute or two, I pour in heavy cream and milk, or half and half, like 1 part broth:1-1.5 parts milk product(s). Then rip up a few leaves of kale and throw it in. After a few minutes, throw in a couple chopped up potatoes and let cook another 30 minutes or so to let everything cook down.  Edit: And salt and pepper to taste at the end.

tonightsdinner,32scys,CatWool,5,Thu Apr 16 09:21:04 2015 UTC,"Recipe if anyone is interested:  Preheat oven to 200 degrees Celsius. Combine 500g beef mince, 2 rashers of bacon (diced finely), 1/2 a teaspoon of oregano leaves, half a cup of fresh breadcrumbs, 1 clove of garlic (minced) and salt  and pepper in a mixing bowl, making sure all ingredients are combined evenly. Roll into 6 - 8 meatballs according to your size preference. Place meatballs in a large baking tray and brush with olive oil. Bake for 15 minutes before removing from oven, and adding sauce (we'll get to that in a second). Sprinkle a combination of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese over the meatballs and sauce. Bake for another 15-20 minutes, and then serve with fettuccine pasta. Sit down, pour a nice glass of red wine, and enjoy! The leftovers are great, and can be made into a subway style sandwich.   For the Sauce   This is dead simple. While the meatballs are cooking the first time, in a large pan soften half an onion in a pan with garlic-infused olive oil (if you can't get that, add about a clove of minced garlic by my estimate). Once the onion has been softened, add a 500g can of diced tomato to the pan with half a teaspoon of sugar, and chili flakes, if you feel that way inclined. Tip! fill the empty can to about 1/8th full with water and swirl around collect more good tomato flavour and add to the sauce. If you do this, add a tablespoon of tomato paste to keep the consistency a bit thicker. Once all the ingredients have been added to the pan, bring sauce to a boil. Once it boils, immediately take it off the heat. Your sauce is done."

tonightsdinner,32rrqt,InTheKitchenWithK,2,Thu Apr 16 04:39:23 2015 UTC,"I made this a couple weeks ago, so bear with me on some of the details!  8 oz tuna steak  Small corn tortillas  Bunch of jicama (extra makes a great salad)  1 packet of taco seasoning  1 can chipotles in adobe sauce  Arugula handful to the size of your salad  1 blood orange  1 cara cara orange (or an orange to your liking)  1¼ cup cilantro  1 8 ounce plain greek yogurt  ~2 Tbs rice wine vinegar  Olive Oil  Salt and pepper  So first I made the jicama slaw because I wanted it to chill in the fridge for a while and absorb the dressing. To make the dressing I blended the vinegar, a dash of olive oil (lets say about ½ - 1 Tbs) and the cilantro (mostly the leaves), dash of salt and pepper until I had a pretty smooth consistency. And honestly I usually do this to taste. I tend to like a lot of vinegar so I go heavy there. Anyways, then I had some jicama from the store that was already sliced into large slices that I cut into smaller sticks. Mix some of the dressing with the jicama, just enough to give it a healthy coating, and reserve the rest for the salad dressing later. Chill the slaw in the fridge until plating.  Next I prepped for the arugula salad. Grab the extra dressing and the plain yogurt. Take a ~½ Tbs of the yogurt and put it in to the dressing to help give a slightly creamier texture. Cut bothe oranges into slices. I was lazy and just peeled the skin off and didn’t take the other membrane part off. Plate these items right away if you want.  Finally the tacos! Grab the rest of the yogurt and crack open the chipotles. Take some of the juice from the adobe(o?) sauce and chop some of the whole chipotles. Mix into the yogurt to taste depending on your spicy level. Heat a pan with some olive oil on medium-high to high heat. While the pan heats, take your tuna steak and cut it into two relatively even pieces. Pat dry with paper towel and then coat liberally with the taco seasoning on all sides. When pan is hot lace the tunas in the pan and rotate onto all sides until you have reached a blackened seasoning look. You want a high enough heat so that the outside sears, but the insides stays rare.   And finally. Warm small corn tortillas, smear some of the chipotle sauce down, place your tuna steaks down, and add the jicama on top. Plate next to your salad and devour.  One of my first posts where I have written out a recipe, so any constructive criticism always welcome. I tend to ramble!  Also sorry for any formatting mistakes!"

tonightsdinner,329sle,LittleHelperRobot,2,Sun Apr 12 14:18:11 2015 UTC,"American chop suey:       American Chop Suey is an American pasta dish.  Classic American chop suey consists of elbow macaroni and bits of cooked ground beef with sautéed onions and green peppers in a thick tomato-based sauce.  The dish is typically cooked in a frying or sauté pan, like Hamburger Helper, as opposed to being baked in an oven like a casserole. Though this decidedly American comfort food is clearly influenced by Italian-American cuisine, it is known as ""American chop suey"" because it is a sometimes-haphazard hodgepodge of meat, vegetables and Italian seasonings.   The recipe is quite adaptable to taste and available ingredients. Elbow macaroni is the standard but can be substituted with pasta of similar size, such as ziti, farfalle, or rotelle. The onions or green peppers may be omitted, or replaced with mushrooms.  Whole, diced, or crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste are typical sauce bases for this dish. Black pepper, herbs and Worcestershire sauce are sometimes used in preparation.

Normally I would add some mushroom before the wine, but mine went bad. :-(  To do it without pressure cooker requires a lot more time and stirring. There are recipes online."

tonightsdinner,31oty0,shinywtf,2,Tue Apr 7 02:55:02 2015 UTC,"By all means, cook whatever's yummy for you. But if you want to strive for authenticity, it's got to be corn tortillas, usually with a single filling: cheese, beef, chicken, crab, or shrimp.  My favorite is crab enchiladas suizas. MMMMM.  Source: lived most of my life in states that border Mexico."

tonightsdinner,31oty0,PedalSpikes,2,Tue Apr 7 06:16:32 2015 UTC,"If you're interested, here's a Tex-Mex/West-Mex beef enchilada recipe I made.  You can make your own sauce (Find/create your recipe for such), but I've had the best success - both in taste and time/resource efficiency - in using pre-made sauces. Just, please god, don't use Old El Paso enchilada sauce.  http://www.bigoven.com/recipe/life-changing-beef-enchiladas/580228  As for the flour vs corn tortillas...Corn tortillas are generally for beef or pork enchiladas. Flour are for chicken enchiladas. Either can be used for vegetable or cheese enchiladas.  Similarly, red sauce is generally for beef/pork enchiladas, and green is for chicken. Either can be used for veggie or cheese.  But, this is just a guideline - at the end of the day, if it's a satisfying meal, who gives a shit what kind of tortilla you used?  EDIT: It seems that my evaluation of which tortilla is best for which filling is based more on West/Tex/Southwest-Mex, rather than genuine Mexican cuisine."

tonightsdinner,31mit3,discoverycook,1 point,Mon Apr 6 13:26:32 2015 UTC,"Sole meuniere is French bistro food. It's meant to be served very simply (with a salad or maybe some pomme frites). Pair with a crisp dry white wine.  Ingredients   1 1/2 lbs. fresh sole fillets (about 6oz.) per person Olive oil Flour for dredging 1/4 cup butter 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley 1 Tbsp. grated lemon zest Lemon juice Lemon wedges for garnish   Preparation  Rinse the fillets and pat dry. Season with a little sea salt and freshly ground pepper.  Heat a large cast iron or nonstick skillet over medium high heat.  Coat the bottom of the pan with olive oil and when the oil just begins to smoke, dredge each fillet in flour and quickly add it to the pan. Don't crowd the pan. Work in batches.  Brown each filet about a minute on a side and transfer to a warm plate.  When all the filets are browned, add the butter to the hot pan along with the parsley and lemon zest, then swirl around until the foaming subsides and the butter just begins to turn a nut-colored brown.  Place the sole portions on a plate and spoon the brown butter/parsley over each portion, followed by a squeeze of lemon juice.  Serve immediately with lemon wedges or slices for garnish.

tonightsdinner,31jjtu,malaislinn,4,Mon Apr 6 00:04:57 2015 UTC,"It's shredded Brussels sprouts on mandolin with fried up proscuitto and pine nuts. It's SUPER good. It's always a big hit, even with people who hate Brussels sprouts. The key is to not overcook them, only cook them until they're bright green and tender.  Shred the Brussels sprouts, separating most of them, remove the stems and outer leaves before shredding, put them aside.  Chop about 100 grams of proscuitto into small bacon bit sized pieces. Throw them in the frying pan with about a half cup of pine nuts. (They're expensive... I'm sure slivered almonds would work too, anything mild tasting and unsalted/uncooked) Add a bit of olive oil, move them constantly because the pine nuts will burn quick. Fry until the proscuitto becomes fragrant (not crisp) and the pine nuts are slightly brown. Add the Brussels sprouts, they'll shrink a lot so I usually do like 15-20 big sprouts for the amount you see there.  Add salt and pepper and mix together until the Brussels sprouts are bright green and tender. You can now either put it aside or serve it. I usually put it aside and just heat it through quick when my Turkey is done. Sample lots while you're cooking, it's God damn tasty.  Enjoy! :)"

Just have low heat on one side, chips in the wok on that side and vent the smoke with foil over the the cold side to the ribs. With the lid cracked and use foil to shield the heat from the ribs.

Recipe:  Ingredients:  Meatballs:   1 lb. Ground Chicken 1 egg 1 cup breadcrumbs (plus more to adjust texture) 1/2 cup minced shallots 1 Tbsp. chopped fresh basil 1 Tbsp. chopped fresh oregano 2 tsp. fennel seeds 1 Tbsp. crushed red pepper (optional) Olive oil   Alfredo Sauce:   1 stick butter (1/2 cup) 1 cup heavy cream Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese   Preparation:  Meatballs:  Combine all the ingredients in a large glass or plastic bowl and mix thoroughly.   If the mixture seems to wet or sticky, add additional breadcrumbs until it can be easily shaped.  Pinch off enough of the mix to make a 1 to 1 1/2 inch meatball and roll in your hand until round, then set aside on a sheet of wax paper.   Repeat until all the meatballs are made.  Heat up a large frying pan and add just enough olive oil to coat the pan.  When the oil is hot and shimmers, add the meatballs and turn until brown on all sides.  Reduce heat and cover the pan, and cook for about 15 minutes to make sure meatballs are cooked through.  Pasta:  While the meatballs are cooking, make a batch of your favorite flat pasta (fettucini, tagliatelle, etc.) and reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water.  Alfredo Sauce:  In a stainless steel skillet or saucepan, warm the butter and cream.   Season with a squeeze of lemon juice, salt and pepper.   Add the Parmesan and stir until melted.  Toss to combine, thinning with resewrved pasta water if necessary.  Assembly:  Add the drained pasta to the pan with the warm Alfredo sauce and toss to coat.  Put the pasta in a large serving bowl (or individual plates) and top with warm meatballs.   Serve immediately with freshly grated parmesan cheese on the side.

Steak had a quick marinade of lime juice, chipotle chili powder, cumin, regular chili powder and garlic powder.  The steak was pan fried in the cast iron pan (I used a little ghee for the fat/oil) and then removed and sliced when it was still medium - medium rare.  While the steak rested, the red and green bell pepper and onion slices were sautéed in the same cast iron pan to pick up some of the same pan bits, using a little bit of ghee as the pan got dry.  Once the veggies were cooked through but still had a little bit of bite to them, I added the steak back to the pan to incorporate everything together.  I served it with some black beans and rice, and of course, tortillas for the fajitas (with cheese, sour cream, and chipotle hot sauce).

tonightsdinner,317385,notreallyswiss,1 point,Thu Apr 2 14:48:43 2015 UTC,"LOL from the recipe introduction:  The Great Gatsby. Remember when Gatsby makes that delicious ten-course meal, and only when his dinner guests have eaten their fill and complimented him on his fine culinary ability does he reveal it was in fact entirely fashioned out of old hats and a dead squirrel? [Note: I have not read The Great Gatsby.]  My husband loves duck breasts but just about sets the oven on fire searing them over super high heat with every fire alarm going mental from the great billows of fatty duck smoke.  I think I'm going to step in and try your method next time he brings home some duck breasts!"
tonightsdinner,317385,jeffreyww,1 point,Fri Apr 3 15:00:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, slow, slow cooking is the key with duck since you want the majority of the fat to render out. I do a similar technique with whole roasted ones. Cook very slowly and then blast heat just at the very end. So much less messy too!"

I'm not picking on you personally, just a lot of people post here and most looks like shit. It might taste great, but the picture is poo and I can't taste the food through the computer.

So, to save time and money, we often make as big of a dish as possible that can hold us through our meals of the upcoming week. And, oh yeah, he's a vegetarian. This week, we put together a hulking mass of shepherd's pie.  Our ingredients:   1.5lb bag of frozen peas 20oz or so mushrooms, sliced (the more the better, IMO) Bag of carrots, peeled and sliced 5lb bag of potatos Two large onions 2qt vegetable broth 1lb bag of lentils 1 head of garlic Salt, pepper, butter, milk   You can prepare the four main components in parallel   Boil potatos in salted water until soft enough for mashing. Add pepper, butter, and milk to taste, and mash/whip them up how you like em. Bring vegetable broth to a boil, add lentils, carrots, and half an onion. Boil until lentils are not too hard. Saute onions and garlic in a skillet, add mushrooms once the onions are sweating. We had so many mushrooms, that we just ladeled some veggie broth into the skillet and put a lid on it to steam the mushrooms til they were cooked. Microwave the frozen peas. We added the mushroom/onion juice to imbue whatever flavor we could.   Then, once all were done, we strained the juices out best we could and layered them, bottom-to-top,   Lentils and carrots Peas Onions and mushrooms Potatos   And then we threw it in an oven and baked it til the tops of the potatos were browned.  And there we have it, a good helping of meals to pack up and take to shift with us all week.  Cheers!"

Ingredients  Olive oil * 1 tsp. garlic powder   3-4 chicken leg quarters, separated Juice and grated zest from 1 lemon sea salt freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup thinly sliced shallots 1 Tbsp. chopped fresh rosemary 2 ounces pancetta, finely chopped 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 1/2 cup dry white wine Chicken stock 2 Tbsp. all-purpose flour, mashed together with 2 Tbsp. softened butter (beurre manie) 1 cup frozen artichoke hearts, thawed and halved (or canned artichoke hearts at room temperature) 2 tsp. chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley   Preparation  Place chicken in a large bowl with 1 tablespoon oil, lemon zest, 4 tsp. lemon juice, and garlic powder and turn to coat. Marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes.  Remove chicken from marinade, pat dry and season with salt and pepper.   Heat a large, deep skillet or dutch oven over medium-high heat then add just enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan.  When the oil is hot, add chicken to pan and cook 5 minutes on each side or until skin is golden brown. Remove chicken to a warm plate.  Reduce heat to medium and add shallots, rosemary, and pancetta; cook 3 minutes or until shallots are tender. Add minced garlic and cook 30 seconds.   Add wine to pan and reduce until liquid almost evaporates, scraping pan to loosen browned bits.   Return chicken to the pan and add enough chicken stock to half way cover the chicken. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a bare simmer. Cook chicken in the simmering liquid for about 30-45 minutes, or until fork tender.  Stir in the beurre manie and the artichoke hearts and increase heat until the liquid in the pan just begins to bubble.   Add artichoke hearts and 1 Tbsp. parsley to pan cook 1-2 minutes or until sauce thickens slightly. Taste and adjust seasoning with lemon juice, salt and pepper.

Add the salt and the curry mix, stir to coat and cook 2-3 minutes. Add the wine, and stir well and make sure you get everything scraped up off the bottom of the pan, cook on medium for 2-3 minutes.  Add the stock and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn to the lowest flame possible and simmer on low for 30 minutes.  Add the potato and the squash, bring back to a boil and then simmer on low for 30 minutes.  Take the soup off the stove and puree with an immersion blender until smooth.  Heat the meatballs on a plate in the microwave, to keep them moist, wrap the meatballs in wet paper towels. Heat for 2 minutes or until hot, but not over cooked.

tonightsdinner,30egxr,surfinbari88,3,Thu Mar 26 18:43:22 2015 UTC,"Recipe!  For the risotto:  *28 ounces chicken stock  *1 tablespoon vegetable oil  *1/2 onion, finely chopped  *1 cup arborio rice  *1 cup white wine  *Large pinch of saffron  *1 tablespoon butter  For the seafood:  *4-6 shrimp per person, peeled and deveined, I used 16/20 size  *4-6 scallops per person, u10 size  *S&P, paprika  *fresh herbs if handy  *cold butter, cut into chunks  *grape seed oil or any high smoke point neutral oil. Do NOT use olive oil for this because it will burn and leave an off taste.  Make sure the scallops are dry packed because if they are wet packed they won't have the nice sear on them. Bring stock to a low simmer in a medium pot. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat for 1 minute. Cook onion until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add rice and a pinch of salt. Sauté until rice is translucent, 1 to 2 minutes. Add wine and saffron; bring to a simmer, stirring, until rice has absorbed most of wine. Add 2 ladles of stock to rice; simmer, stirring, until rice has absorbed most of stock. Continue adding stock, allowing rice to absorb it before adding the next ladleful. Cook until rice is al dente and mixture is a little loose. Stir in butter. Turn off heat.  Cover and let sit 2 minutes.  Meanwhile, as the rice is cooking down, pat dry the seafood and season. Heat a frying pan or cast iron skillet on high heat. Add your oil and let it get smoking hot. Place the scallops around the pan clockwise and let cook. Add a pat of butter and herbs if you have them and baste with a spoon. After 2-3 minutes flip with tongs in the order you placed them. Cook another 2-3 minutes until both sides have a nice sear and the scallops are opaque. Set aside and cook the shrimp in the same pan, adding some more oil and butter if needed. Cook until they turn opaque as well and set aside. Reheat the scallops lightly if needed in the pan on the last minute of cooking the shrimp. Spoon some of the now finished risotto onto the plate and garnish with the seafood. Sprinkle some chopped herbs on top if desired and eat immediately! Enjoy!"

Toppings were ground pork, sweet onion, green bell pepper, fresh basil and bocconcini mozzarella.    My pizza stone is rectangular, hence the shape.  I've always preferred this shape of pizza vs. a circle.  Overall taste was pretty good but lots of room for improvement.  EDIT:  Forgot to mention that I put the sauce on last instead of first.  I watched a pizza special the other day and one NYC pizza place puts the sauce towards the end to prevent the dough from getting soaked in sauce.  Putting it very last wasn't the best method, but I agree with the thought process.  Another thing to tweak later."

We lived in several countries, but when we were in Germany, we ate schnitzel almost every time we went out anywhere to eat -- that and cordon bleu, which is essentially schnitzel with a layer of ham and cheese in the center. My whole family was addicted to it.  And the best we ever had was at the Eisenhut in Rothenburg, not far from where we lived. Fantastic dish, served on a tray stretched across two food-warmers (the little boxes with candles), and accompanied by hot potato salad and succulent, crisp green beans with bacon. Nearly sixty years later, I can still summon up the taste."
tonightsdinner,309kgh,emkay99,2,Wed Mar 25 19:08:02 2015 UTC,"Wiener schnitzel is a Viennese recipe for breaded and fried veal cutlets, typically drizzled with a bit of lemon juice.  Recipe  Ingredients:   1 lb. veal cutlets (scallops or scallopini) 1 cup all pupose flour 1 large egg 1/4 cup heavy cream 1 cup unseasoned fine bread crumbs Zest of one lemon, grated High smoke point oil, for frying Fresh lemon juice for finishing   Preparation:   Using a mallet or a heavy sauce pan, pound the veal until it is uniformly thin, a little less than a quarter inch thick. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.  Prepare a breading station with three shallow plates. On the first place the flour, on the second, lightly beat the egg and cream together, and on the third, place the bread crumbs mixed together with the lemon zest.  Heat about a quarter inch of oil in a saute pan until it shimmers and just barely begins to smoke.   Turn the heat down a little and one at a time, dredge the veal pieces in flour, shake off any excess, dip in the egg, coat with bread crumbs and then lay in the hot pan. Work in batches and don't overcrowd the pan.   As the veal cooks, spoon a little hot oil over the tops of the cutlets and after about two minutes, turn the cutlets. The veal should be a golden color. Watch carefully, because they're easy to burn.  Remove each cutlet to a paper towel to drain and contiinue the process until all the veal is cooked.  Drizzle the veal with a squeeze of fresh lmon juice and serve immediately over a bed of warm buttered egg noodles.  Full printable recipe at http://www.discoverycooking.com/wiener-schnitzel/"

tonightsdinner,300iva,discoverycook,3,Mon Mar 23 14:28:04 2015 UTC,"Pierogies are stuffed dumplings boiled and traditionally served with butter and sour cream or browned in oil or butter.  Ingredients  Filling   3 Tbsp. butter 1/2 cup chopped onion 2 cups cold mashed potatoes 1 cup cheddar cheese, shredded 1 tsp. salt 1 tsp. white pepper   Dough   2 large eggs 6 oz. sour cream 1 1/2 - 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 tsp. salt 2 tsp. baking powder   Preparation  Filling  Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion, and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.  In a large bopwl, combine onions, cheese, and mashed potatoes, and season with salt and white pepper.  Dough  Beat together the eggs and sour cream until smooth. Add flour, salt, and baking powder; stir into the sour cream mixture until dough comes together.  Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until firm and smooth.  Roll out the dough to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut into 3 inch rounds using a biscuit cutter or coffee mug.  Assembly  Place a small spoonful of the mashed potato filling into the center of each round. Moisten the edges with water, fold over, and press together with a fork to seal.  Gently place the finished pierogies in a plastic bag and freeze for at least 1 hour (longer if possible).  Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pierogies and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or they float. Remove with a slotted spoon.  You can eat them boiled, with melted butter and sour cream or (if you're like me) brown them in a bit of olive oil or butter.  Serve with Polish sausage (Kielbasa) and a helping of cabbage fried with yellow onion.  Full printable recipe at http://www.discoverycooking.com/kielbasa-cabbage-and-pierogies-the-full-pittsburgh/"

tonightsdinner,2zqg72,amopdx,1 point,Fri Mar 20 23:05:01 2015 UTC,"Sumac:       Sumac (/ˈsjuːmæk/ or /ˈʃuːmæk/; also spelled sumach) is any one of about 35 species of flowering plants in the genus Rhus and related genera, in the family Anacardiaceae. Sumacs grow in subtropical and temperate regions throughout the world, especially in Africa and North America.    Sumacs are shrubs and small trees that can reach a height of 1–10 m (3.3–32.8 ft). The leaves are spirally arranged; they are usually pinnately compound, though some species have trifoliate or simple leaves. The flowers are in dense panicles or spikes 5–30 cm (2.0–11.8 in) long, each flower very small, greenish, creamy white or red, with five petals. The fruits form dense clusters of reddish drupes called sumac bobs. The dried drupes of some species are ground to produce a tangy crimson spice.    Sumacs propagate both by seed (spread by birds and other animals through their droppings), and by new shoots from rhizomes, forming large clonal colonies.

tonightsdinner,2zkxxo,discoverycook,2,Thu Mar 19 13:14:35 2015 UTC,"Salmon with sweet peppers and pineapple is a quick, tasty lunch or light dinner with very little prep, a small number of ingredients and a single frying pan.  Recipe:   Ingredients   1 bunch white asparagus Olive oil Fresh lemon juice Grapeseed, canola or some other oil with a neutral flavor 1 fresh pineapple peeled, cored and sliced about 1/4-inch thick 1 green bell pepper, chopped 4 pieces of salmon filet, about 6 oz. each Italian-style seasoning Previously made or bottled basil pesto   Instructions  Preheat oven to 400F.  Line a rimmed baking sheet with tin foil, lay out the asparagus on the sheet and drizzle with oil, a little Italian seasoning and a little bit of lemon juice, then toss the asparagus to coat it well with the oil and seasoning.  Pop the sheet into the hot oven and roast for about 15 minutes, or until the asparagus is tender.  Meanwhile, heat the grapeseed oil in a 12-inch frying pan (cast iron, if you have one) and, working in batches, saute the pineapple slices (as many as you want to serve) until they're just beginning to brown the turn them and do the same to the other side. Remove the slices to a warm plate.  Add a little more oil, if needed, and saute the chopped pepper for 3-4 minutes, then remove to the plate with the pineapple.  Add the salmon filets, skin side up, to the hot skillet. Cook for about 2-3 minutes and turn them over to cook for another 3-4 minutes. (The time may be more or less depending on the thickness of the fish).  Place the salmon filets on a plate with the pineapple and roasted asparagus, top with the peppers and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Spoon a little prepared pesto over the asparagus and serve immediately.  Full printable recipe at http://www.discoverycooking.com/salmon-with-sweet-peppers-and-pineapple/"

tonightsdinner,2zj3rb,___ok,2,Thu Mar 19 00:32:50 2015 UTC,"This week's challenge over at /r/52weeksofcooking was Hangover Cures, and this would definitely cure my hangover.  My goto hangover cure for a long time has been a mcdouble and an oreo mcflurry, I have no idea why it works so well, but it totally does.  However, this turned out way, way tastier than McD's can serve up.  As far as the sliders go theyre pretty straightforward, each patty is 3oz of 80/20 ground beef, mashed up a bit to homogenize slightly and then shaped into a thick puck.    Smash the patty on a hot griddle (mine was about 550-600F) and season with S&P, lightly press some thin sliced onions in the top of the patties and season with a little more salt.    After about 1-2mins total cooking on the one side, scrape it onto a wide spatula (I got this Guy Fieri Douche-a-Tron spatula from Walmart that is pretty much perfect for burgers).    Flip over and top with cheese, put a piece of bun on top of each patty and cover with a towel, the burger will finish cooking while it steams from the onions which will also soften/flavor the buns.    Once the onions are softened and browned, and the cheese is melted, scrape the patties off the griddle, add whatever condiments you want (mustard and pickles for me) and enjoy the Classic American Slider!  Beer cheese was pretty much taken straight out of Modernist Cuisine, recipe is duplicated here.  I just used tillamook sharp cheddar and this ale cheese I had leftover from a cheese tray, and it is delicious.    Ice cream recipe was from my Cuisinart ice cream maker's book, sans mint.  Turned out pretty awesome, would definitely make it again."

tonightsdinner,2zf268,AgDrumma07,1 point,Wed Mar 18 01:06:23 2015 UTC,"Got the recipe from a buddy and have been cooking this meal for a few years now.   Ingredients  Chicken or shrimp - 9 or so shrimp, or the equivalent of chicken Yellow onion - 1/2 Jalapeno - 1/2 of a small one Optional vegetables - bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, mushrooms, things of that sort Fish Sauce Soy Sauce Minced Garlic Sugar Peanut Oil Butter Thai Basil  Jasmine rice  Cook the rice and set it aside.  Keep warm if possible.  If not, be prepared to reheat it quickly.  Cut up all ingredients: Meat should be cut into small bits (a shrimp would be cut up one or two times) Onion cut up into long strips Optional vegetables cut as small as the meat Mince the jalapeno, leaving seeds in.  If there looks like there are too many seeds, take some out - dish can easily become too hot  Put a little peanut oil in the wok, until the bottom is lightly coated.  Add jalapeno and minced garlic (1 1/2 knives, or something like 1/2-1/3 as much garlic as there is jalapeno).  Throw in a small knob of butter as well.  Turn heat to high.  Once the garlic starts to brown (or when you get bored), add the meat and 3 dashes of fish sauce.  Let meat cook until it's 3/4 done, adding fish sauce whenever the contents of the wok seem too dry.  Keep mixing ingredients up with a spatula throughout, to make sure they cook evenly, and to relieve boredom.  Once meat is ~3/4 done, add optional vegetables and onion, along with a single dash of soy sauce.  Be careful - it's easy to overpower the taste with the soy.  You can add a little more butter here as well, if you feel like it.  Once meat is mostly done, add 1 1/3 knives of tube-basil (or something like 3-4 leaves of good thai basil, if you have that), 1/2 a spoonful of sugar and some more fish sauce.  Stir around with spatula until the basil is really mixed in.  Make sure there is some liquid at the bottom of the wok, though not too much - the dish should not be swimming.  Serve with a delicious beer of some kind to assuage the spiciness.  Eat, and be amazing."

Recipe:  Ingredients:   6-8 veal scallopini 18-20 fresh sage leaves (plus 2 Tbsp. chopped fresh sage leaves) Freshly ground pepper 6-8 paper-thin prosciutto slices 2-3 Tbsp. olive oil 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup all purpose flour 1 cup dry white wine 6-8 tablespoons chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces Lemon wedges   Preparation  Pound each of the veal pieces with a mallet or a heavy saucepan until about 1/8 inch thick (putting the veal between layers of wax paper makes this easier).  Cover each veal scallop with a single layer of sage leaves, lay a pie ce of the prosciutto on top of the leaves and then carefully fold the veal in half, to make a ""sandwich"" with sage and prosciutto in the middle. Set aside.  Heat up a large saute pan and add half the oil and 1 1/2 butter to the pan. When the oil/butter mixture is hot, dredge each piece of veal in flour, shake off excess and add to the pan (you'll need to work in two batches, most likely, and use the remaining oil and butter as you go).  Cook the veal about 3 minutes or so per side then remove to a warm plate.  When all the veal is cooked, toss the chopped veal leaves in the pan and give that a quick stir, then deglaze the pan with the wine, scraping up the browned bits as you stir it around.   Give the wine one- two minutes to boil off the alcohol then add the chilled butter 1 Tbsp at a time, letting each pat of butter melt before adding the next.  Arrange the veal on a plate and spoon the sauce over the veal and serve immediately with lemon wedges on the side. If you're serving with gnocchi or a little pasta, spoon the sauce over that as well.   Full printable recipe at http://www.discoverycooking.com/veal-saltimbocca/"

tonightsdinner,2z6a68,glitterygal,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:36:29 2015 UTC,"Yes! The recipe is as follows:  3 cups shredded cooked chicken  3 celery stalks, chopped  2 medium carrots, chopped  32oz chicken stock/broth  1 can cream of chicken  1/4 poultry seasoning (I used dashes of Thyme, Marjoram, Sage, Rosemary, and Pepper instead)  The dumplings were actually biscuits. I used a can of the Pillsbury Grand Jrs. The recipe call for 10oz but I used the whole can, which was 12oz. The recipe calls to make the biscuit dough into strips. The strips for the dumplings were of 1/8th of an inch in thickness and 1/2in width. I kind of just played it by eye and mine turned out too big but if the dumplings are your favourite part, like mine, then it works out just fine.  How to make it-   Put the broth, can of soup, chicken, and seasoning into a Dutch oven. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat and simmer for 5mins. Bring back to a boil.  With the chicken broth mixture back to a boil, Rub a little flour on the dumpling strips. Put the strips in one at a time. Add the celery and carrots. Put on a low boil for 15-20mins (since my dumplings were larger, I did 25mins). Stir occasionally so the dumplings don't stick together.   Very yummy, and very quick! I shred my own chicken but had I gotten a deli one like the recipe suggested it would have been a 20-30min dinner!"

tonightsdinner,2z39da,4britisheyes0nly,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:09:06 2015 UTC,"I just double-checked and all the ingredients are captioned under the pictures. I think if you're viewing on mobile it doesn't load the captions, so it might help to load the album on a computer. I copy and pasted the text below each picture to make things easy. best of luck!   start with a pound of boneless skinless chicken thighs. simmer those at about 190 degrees in chicken stock until they're about to fall apart. this took 1:45. seasoned with granulated garlic and onion, crushed red, black pepper, dried basil, old bay, and paprika.  let it cool and pull the meat. I reserved the broth for making the gravy later.  now onto biscuits. combine 225 grams of AP flour, 2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, and 1/2 tsp salt in the food processor. pulse that to mix. add 1 cup of white cheddar and a little fresh parsley and pulse to combine. add 6 tbsp cold cubed butter and pulse until it looks like gravel. then add 3/4 cup buttermilk and process until it just comes together. roll that out into a rough square.  cut 4 biscuits and brush the tops with cream. bake at 425 for 10-15 minutes, until golden and flaky.  these were really good. I wish I had sharp cheddar to give it more color but the white cheddar is great too.  then we make gravy. sweat 2 tbsp of onion in 2 tbsp butter until they're about to brown, then add 2 tbsp flour and stir the roux on medium-low for 3 or 4 minutes until it starts to get toasty.  add 1/2 cup of the chicken braising liquid, 1.5 cups heavy cream and bring to a simmer. season well with salt, pepper, and crushed red. I simmered it for 3 or 4 minutes until it got nice and thick.  when you can swipe it and see the bottom of the pan like this it's ready. let it cool slightly to thicken more.  stack that up and eat it. this was simultaneously the most delicious and the most filling thing I've eaten in a while. I could take a bath in that gravy."

Sauce: a whole small bottle of Franks Red Hot Sauce  1 stick cold unsalted butter cut into whatever shape you want to cut them in to.  2tbsp seasoned rice wine vin (I haven't found a recipe that calls for this - and I think it gave the  sauce the edge it needed to really stand out and cut through a depth of flavor that is super tasty)  1/4tsp worchestishirecherster sauce - or however the hell you spell it.  1/4 tsp cayenne  1/8th tsp garlic powder  pinch of salt and sugar  Frites:  a bag of steak cut french fries put in the over and forgot about until everything is over and pulled out in a frantic last minute only to realize everything is fine.

It's amazing, in my opinion.  The crust is:   2 cups mozzarella cheese (~8 oz.) 3/4 cup almond flour 1 tbsp. psyllium husk powder 3 tbsp. cream cheese (~1.5 oz.) 1 large egg   and misc. spices, including:   1 tbsp. generic Italian seasoning 1/2 tsp. salt 1/2 tsp. pepper a few pressed garlic gloves   Toppings:    3 oz. tomato paste mozzarella cheese  pepperoni portabello mushrooms crushed garlic some parmesan cheese Italian seasoning   This is very close to the recipe I found.  I'm not a huge fan of typical pizza sauce, so I used just a little tomato paste.  And I like strong cheese and lots of garlic.  I used a cast iron pan instead of a cookie sheet and a little longer oven times.  I also melted the cheese in the oven since I don't own a microwave.  It's probably better that way, to avoid the burnt edges and inconsistent temperatures.  I think I'll try it in a non-stick sauce pan on the stove next time.  It seems like there are many ways to customize this recipe to your tastes.  It's fantastic, but I'm going to try this recipe next time.  edit: formatting, clarification, and added link to website with recipe"

tonightsdinner,2yv18a,tangerinelion,3,Fri Mar 13 01:18:14 2015 UTC,"One thing you might want to try out is bringing your steak up before searing. For a nice thick steak, I'll put it in the oven at 200-225 for 20 mins - not enough to cook it, but the fat liquefies.   Then sear it on a smoking hot pan for a couple minutes per side. You end up with a more defined crust, and evenly cooked through, without that gray overdone layer in between (which tenderloin doesn't have enough fat to forgive you for).   Nice looking cut of meat, and good choice on the accompaniment."
tonightsdinner,2yvrjg,amopdx,1 point,Fri Mar 13 05:24:30 2015 UTC,Interesting.  Is this a sweet BBQ or more spicy?  I'm curious how it turned out.

This was my first time cooking them, next time I will have to try and cook the skin more, some of it was too tough to chew, I had to take it off. I think I will cook them on the stove top before baking next time.    I rubbed them with my own blend of seasoning salt then baked at 350 for an hour and twenty minutes, then I tossed them in some sauce when they came out of the oven."

There are 2 sheets per box. You want puff pastry, not phyllo/filo/fillo. Phyllo is a pain in the ass to work with.  Mince a couple large shallots and 1 large portobello mushroom. Saute in butter until soft. Add 1-2 cloves minced garlic, saute one more minute. Set aside and let cool.  Quarter 2 6oz fliet mignons, season with salt and pepper, and sear. Set aside to cool. You don't want to put hot food on raw puff pastry..it messes it up.  Make egg wash (1 egg, 2tbs water or milk).  Cut puff pastry sheets into quarters (giving you 8 equal squares). Place a spoonful of mushroom mixture into each square. Place filet piece onto mushrooms. Brush edges with egg wash, bring together all the corners, and pinch all edges to seal.  Flip over, put on a rimmed baking sheet. At this point, it might be best to chill for an hour, if your puff pastry has gotten too soft and doughy.   Brush tops with egg wash (to help browning). Bake in a 450 degree (F) oven for 20-30 minutes until puff pastry is golden brown. Serve.  I usually make some kind of gravy or sauce (depending on mood) to go with mine: http://i.imgur.com/KXdPtjc.jpg  edit: nearly forgot the garlic! for shame!"

tonightsdinner,2yomgs,shamgar_bn,3,Wed Mar 11 15:05:36 2015 UTC,"Recipe:  Sautee 2-3 cloves of garlic on med-high heat until they are just turning off-white or light brown, add a large handful of arugula lettuce and a dash of salt until lettuce is wilted (don't worry if it seems like too much lettuce... arugula will shrink a lot when wilted), stirring occasionally to get that garlic all over. Remove from heat and set aside. Sautee 4-5 mushrooms until brown and tender. Remove from heat and set aside. Wisk 3 eggs (4 if you're really hungry) in a bowl. Add a tsp of butter/coconut oil/etc to the sautee pan until melted. Pour eggs in pan and allow 2-3 minutes over med-high heat. When the top layer of eggs begins to firm up, give the pan a little shimmy shake to make sure it's not sticking. Add the cooked veggies to the omlette, followed by some shredded cheddar cheese. Cook another 2-3 minutes until cheese is melted, Flip half of the omlette over itself and serve with sriracha drizzled over top (or any other hot sauce of your choosing [or no hot sauce at all... you're probably an adult, do what you want]). I ate it with strawberries for a little extra goodness.  I didn't give very specific amounts of the ingredients because it's an omlette, and you can really adjust the ingredients to whatever you like. You don't want mushrooms, don't use them. You love mushrooms, use more. You want some sauteed bell peppers in there... great!  This is a great meal for dinner after an intense workout. High protein, good amount of fiber, and it is very filling.  Enjoy!"

tonightsdinner,2ykdnr,discoverycook,1 point,Tue Mar 10 15:25:34 2015 UTC,"Poached chicken breasts are moist and flavorful, with very little added fat. With some creativity you can put a very classy dish on the table, too.  Ingredients   4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts 1/2 white onion 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 cup dry white wine 1 cup chicken stock (plus more to maintain liquid level) 1/4 cup basil leaves, coarsely chopped 1/4 cup fresh oregano 1 bay leaf salt and pepper 1/2 cup heavy cream   Instructions  Wash and pat the chicken breasts dry with a paper towel and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.  Cut a piece of parchment paper into a circle about the size of the pan you'll be using and set that aside.  In a large saute pan with straight sides, saute onions over high heat in a little olive oil until they're just beginning to brown.  Add garlic and cook for another minute.  Deglaze the hot pan with the white wine and reduce that over high heat until most of the liquid has evaporated. Scrape up any browned residue sticking to the pan.  Add the chicken stock, bring to a slow boil and then reduce heat until the liquid is just barely bubbling.  Stir in the bay leaf, basil and oregano.  Add the chicken breasts and, if necessary add a more stock so that the breasts are about 3/4 covered.  Place the piece of parchment on top of the chicken breasts and cover the pan with a tight fitting lid.  After about 15 minutes, begin checking the chicken breasts with an instant-read thermometer every five minutes or so (cooking time will vary depending on the size of the chicken breasts). When the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 160F or so, remove to a warm plate and discard parchment paper.  Bring the poaching liquid to a rapid boil and reduce by half.  Stir in the cream and continue to reduce until the liquid coats the back of a spoon.  Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.  Serve hot over long pasta like bucatini or linguini.

tonightsdinner,2ygvsm,1d0m1n4t3,2,Mon Mar 9 21:54:02 2015 UTC,Can I get a recipe i'd love to give this a go
tonightsdinner,2ygvsm,1d0m1n4t3,2,Mon Mar 9 19:45:46 2015 UTC,"It needs some tweaks in my opinion.  I think next time I will make this with sofrito - that should be a lock for a good recipe.   The recipe is pretty simple.  Get some annatto powder and mix it with olive oil.  Get it hot and brown the chicken on both sides.  You want to get the skin a bit crisp but you aren't cooking the chicken. I like to use a cast iron skillet for this because, well - I don't have to explain myself to you - you just want to jack my recipe!  Kidding.  Cast Iron rocks for all things crisping.  Skin might stick a little but that's ok - it doesn't have to look pretty.   Take the chicken out of the pan.  Pour the left over oil out of the skillet and dump it into a pot suitable for the arroz.  Put the heat on the new pot and return the skillet back to its burner.  Dump in a crisp beer... About as much as you can chug in one go - and de-glaze the skillet. THE SKILLET NOT THE NEW POT THAT IS HEATING UP THE ANNATTO OIL!  Toss in the vegetables (whatever you want, but I used 1 green and 1 red bell pepper, 3 onions, and 4-5 cloves of garlic) and cook until the onion goes all ghosty. Put in some Oregano, salt, bijol seasoning, and a decent pinch of saffron - these amounts are all up to you, the important 2 are saffron and oregano.  Use a couple tablespoons of the oregano and don't go overboard with the saffron.  You can also add in diced tomatoes.  I decided to leave them out because the kept looking at me funny.     In the meantime, brown some onion and garlic in the big pot and toss in 2 big handfulls of rice. Move it all around so it all gets soaked in the annatto oil.  Then dump in the ""seasoning"" from the skillet (seasoning meaning the veggies that are cooked in all that beer-ie and herb goodness) into everything and incorporate it all together.    Take those juicy crispy salmonella giving if you were to eat them right now chicken pieces and place them on top of everything.  Skin side up.   Dump some chicken stock until everything is covered and slam a lid on it.  Make sure the heat is about med-high and once it gets to a boil, drop the heat to low and leave it alone.  It will be ready when its ready.  20-45mins? Mine took about 25mins.  I don't know why.  Just look at it, taste it and decide.  Once all the liquid is gone and the chicken meat is easily pulled off the bone you are golden.  Some people bake their arroz con pollo, but this is a great way to get all those slow roasted flavors in a quicker time."

Brussels Sprouts:  Halved sprouts were pan roasted on medium heat in bacon fat and bacon pieces until tender.

Let sit for 20 minutes and flip over half way through. When you cook it, heat wok up as high as you can get it and then pour about an inch or two of canola/peanut oil in the wok and swirl around to coat halfway up the wok. Put chicken in wok right away and keep it moving in the boiling oil until they turn white (they do not have to be completely done). Take out chicken when done and put it on a plate. Pour out most of the oil and add in veggies. Cook veggies (keep moving constantly always on high heat) until almost done. Mix up another batch of sauce (just did 1 tbsp soy/mirin/cornstarch without sugar) and pour it in with about 1 tsp minced garlic, 1/2 tsp ginger, and the chicken. Keep it cooking and moving until the veggies are as done as you want them (make sure garlic/ginger does not burn). Put on rice and bam, awesome stir-fry.  Sorry that was long but it's a lot of steps.

tonightsdinner,2y3t2j,drew_tattoo,1 point,Sat Mar 7 15:32:41 2015 UTC,One thing I like to do when I slow roast some pork is to shred it when it's all done and then pop it under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp it up. Delicious! I'm sure finishing it in a pan had a similar effect.
tonightsdinner,2y0tlv,Flam5,10,Thu Mar 5 14:17:28 2015 UTC,"First off... Full disclosure -- I did not make the sauce from scratch.  No need to when this stuff is available at the grocery store.  It has the right consistency and flavor and works for me.  If it's not hot enough, add some chili oil during the cooking process.  Recipe I used was a combination of several other recipes I read and is as follows:   Cut chicken into bite sized pieces.  For this recipe, I used 2 chicken breasts -- about 1.5Lbs. In a bowl, combine 3 beaten eggs with half a cup of corn starch, a pinch of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon baking powder.  This should form a pancake/tempura style batter for the chicken.  Add the chicken pieces to this and mix well so all chicken pieces are coated. Heat several cups of oil in a wok.  You can test if the oil is ready by just dropping a small bit of batter into the oil and making sure it sizzles.  Remove the test batter (you don't want it to burn as you're frying the chicken), then add the chicken pieces and fry until browned and cooked through.  You'll want to break up the pieces a little bit as the batter will want to keep the chicken stuck together.   Also, ""browned and cooked through?"" I hate when recipes say that, too, but it depends on the temperature of your chicken, the size of the pieces, and how hot you have the oil. Just cut through a piece after about 8 minutes to make sure it's all white and has the consistency of cooked meat.  There should be a little bit of golden brown on the batter.   Cook the chicken in batches (I did two batches) and drain on paper towels. While the chicken is resting/draining, prepare and cook the baby bok choy: Cut a little bit of the base of each bok choy bundle, then halve them lengthwise.  heat a tablespoon of oil (it doesn't need much -- I actually used some from the chicken frying) in a frying pan and add some chopped garlic, 1 teaspoon/1 clove is good enough.  Sauté the bok choy for 3 or 4 minutes so it is tendercrisp.  Here's where you can add whatever additional flavor you want.  I added some sweet chili sauce, though you can go with some soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, whatever you want.    After 30 seconds with the sauce, remove from heat and remove the bok choy from the pan as it will keep cooking on the hot pan.  As the bok choy finishes, heat up the general tsos sauce in a separate pan until it starts to bubble, then add the chicken and toss to coat. That's it! Serve with steamed white rice."

tonightsdinner,2y314f,dlyte2,1 point,Fri Mar 6 05:21:34 2015 UTC,They're both summer foods so they usually get served together at our house.  I also find the sweetness and lightness of the melon balances the plate well with the rich heavy barbecue foods.

I added about 7 cups or water and 1 cup chicken broth. I brought to a boil and then lowered heat and let it simmer until beans soft. I threw in some spinach at the end and served with Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top."

tonightsdinner,2xyvrg,thekindsith,4,Thu Mar 5 03:24:08 2015 UTC,Kenji from Serious Eats wrote an excellent explanation on this very recipe/recreation a few years back: http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/07/the-food-lab-how-to-make-a-chick-fil-a-sandwich-at-home.html
tonightsdinner,2xyvrg,wmarnold,2,Thu Mar 5 01:06:35 2015 UTC,"Replace the salt in your dry batter with Vulcan's Fire Salt. That'll get you the perfect amount of spiciness. The ingredients are: Salt, Louisiana Chile Mash, Garlic, Habanero Chile, Shallots, Tellicherry Pepper, Lime Peel, Pimenton de La Vera, Picante, Cumin, allspice and Vinegar.  I've been using this salt for 2 years, on a pretty regular basis. You just season things the same amount or a tiny bit more as if it were regular salt, and the taste comes out perfectly spicy."
tonightsdinner,2xyvrg,eastcoastian,1 point,Thu Mar 5 11:43:16 2015 UTC,Great suggestion.  I will pick some of this up.  I don't know why I didn't think about hot salts before.

tonightsdinner,2xyvrg,eastcoastian,1 point,Thu Mar 5 04:01:28 2015 UTC,I miss chic-fil-a so hard.  Finally putting this together really helped allay that desire.  The actual chicken was spot on. but the spicy flavor was a little off and the crust needs a little tweaking.
tonightsdinner,2xyvrg,SantiagoRamon,3,Thu Mar 5 06:15:51 2015 UTC,What made you use pickle juice as a marinade? Also I wonder if spicy pickle juice would help your spice problem
tonightsdinner,2xyvrg,wmarnold,2,Thu Mar 5 00:48:47 2015 UTC,That is a really really good idea.
tonightsdinner,2xyvrg,SantiagoRamon,2,Thu Mar 5 02:26:08 2015 UTC,"After much reading, it was confirmed that chic fil a does in fact brine their breasts in pickle juice.  It adds a really savory element to the breast.  And after doing it, The meat tasted exactly like the restaurant."

tonightsdinner,2xyvrg,SantiagoRamon,4,Thu Mar 5 03:20:33 2015 UTC,"Well, how do they bread it? Please provide as many details as possible"
tonightsdinner,2xyvrg,this1,-10,Thu Mar 5 04:48:07 2015 UTC,"It comes frozen from the suppliers in boxes, 40lbs. We remove the 4 10lb bags and place then in a fridge to thaw for 24 hours. The chicken comes pre-marinated in seasonings, like a wet spice rub. It's reddish in color, paprika being my guess, with the spicy variety being VERY red.   The breading station consists of a ""milk wash"" and ""seasoned coater"". The milk wash is mostly milk from what I could tell. It comes in a bag and is essentially powered milk. The seasoned coater was just seasoned flour. The spices they added were pretty much everything good that logically makes sense. Onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, salt, pepper, etc.   Dip the marinated filet in the milk wash and let drip for a few seconds. Then nly one coating of flour, then pressure fried in peanut oil."
tonightsdinner,2xyvrg,OnlySpoilers,2,Thu Mar 5 05:00:07 2015 UTC,Wow.  Thanks!! Of course its pressure fried! Too bad.  I have a feeling that really adds to the texture of the chicken.  Mystery solved on that part.   I don't suppose you ever saw an ingredient list on the spicy chicken boxes when they came in?   /u/sleepyguy22 has a good idea with replacing regular salt with spicy salt - that shouldn't change the flavor profile - just add some good heat.  But I would be very curious to know the actual marinade.   Thanks so much for taking the time to lay out the details.

Once boiling, add the lentils. Cook 14 to 16 minutes, or until softened. Drain thoroughly and transfer to a bowl; set aside in a warm place. Rinse and dry the pot.  While the lentils cook, wash and dry the fresh produce. Remove the fish from the refrigerator to bring to room temperature. Peel and thinly slice the garlic and onion. Separate the chard leaves and stems; roughly chop the leaves and thinly slice the stems, keeping them separate. Using a peeler, remove the rind of the lemon, avoiding the pith; mince the rind to get 2 teaspoons of zest (or use a zester). Quarter and deseed the lemon. Pick the parsley leaves off the stems; discard the stems. Roughly chop the capers.  While the lentils continue to cook, place the breadcrumbs onto a large plate. Pat the tilapia fillets dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper on both sides. Coat 1 side of each seasoned fillet in the breadcrumbs. In a medium pan, heat a thin layer of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the fillets, breaded side down first. Cook 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; set aside in a warm place. Carefully wipe out the pan.  In the pot used to cook the lentils, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the garlic, onion, chard stems and ras el hanout. Cook, stirring frequently, 3 to 5 minutes, or until tender and fragrant. Add the chard leaves and ¼ cup of water; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until the chard leaves have wilted. Add the lemon zest, the juice of 1 lemon wedge, cooked lentils and ¼ of the butter. Cook, stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes, or until thoroughly combined. Remove from heat. Cover and set aside in a warm place.  In the same pan used to cook the tilapia, melt the remaining butter on medium heat. Cook, occasionally swirling the butter around the pan, 1 to 2 minutes, or until fragrant and golden brown. (The butter will bubble, then the foam will subside). Turn off the heat; add the capers and the juice of the remaining lemon wedges. Stir until combined; season with salt and pepper to taste.  Divide the lentil-vegetable mixture between 2 bowls. Top each with a cooked fillet. Top with the meunière sauce and garnish with the parsley. Enjoy!"

tonightsdinner,2xqknc,aroyalsnake,5,Tue Mar 3 05:18:13 2015 UTC,"hey it couldn't be simpler. this was a simple italian sausage but you could use just about anything and tweak your potatoes to complement it.  the key is a thick gravy that coats everything. I sear the sausage in a pan, transfer them to the oven to finish, and use the rendered fat to make the gravy. discard all but a heavy tablespoon of the fat, stir in a tablespoon of flour, whisk for 3-4 minutes on lowish medium heat, scraping up the bits leftover from searing. add about 1.25 cups of beef stock along with onion powder, crushed red, and black pepper, turn the heat up to medium-high and keep whisking until it thickens. this is a pretty loose roux so let it reduce still on medium-high heat until it's nice and thick, about 5 minutes. salt at the end, never early.  that makes enough for 2 ""normal people"" portions."

tonightsdinner,2xl1oh,cupcake1713,3,Mon Mar 2 05:17:59 2015 UTC,"I still burn eggs and toast sometimes.   As you alluded to, its all just practice.  The great thing about cooking is the more you do it, the more confidence you get, the more things you taste, the more things you want to try and put together.    I really enjoy ""playing"" in the kitchen.  Its relaxing for me.  As opposed to doing something like building a city in Minecraft, I am in the kitchen trying to build something of my own (that has a damn good chance of also tasting great).  In that way, I don't mind ""wasting"" an hour or two cooking.  Its just another hobby, ya know?   And hey, there is always mediocre Chinese take-out or pizza delivery.  When your cooking goes tits-up (as it will occasionally) just toss it in the trash and order some food.  Worst case is you learned from what you did and probably have a better understanding of how to make that dish better the next time."

Try using an English cucumber cut on a mandolin to a long thin slice, bend it into a circle and slide a batton of carrot through the soft flesh of the cucumber to lock the circle.  Fill the cucumber ring with the rice. Then thin your green sauce, it looks a little too thick. Probably some coconut milk would do.   For a colored garnish id use a micro salad of radish slivers, carrot slivers and some watercress or cilantro, dressed with mirin, rice wine vinegar and some sesame oil.  Just sayin.

tonightsdinner,2x48d8,discoverycook,3,Wed Feb 25 15:09:25 2015 UTC,"Calling beef bourguignon a beef stew is like calling Beethoven's Fifth a song. Technically accurate, but missing the subtle beauty of the dish.  Recipe:   Ingredients   About 1 1/2 pounds beef chuck, cut into bite-size pieces Olive oil 2 shallots, minced 2-3 cloves garlic, minced 2 cups pearl onions, peeled 1/2 pound crimini (baby bella) mushrooms, sliced or quartered 2 cups red wine (pinot noir or French burgundy) 2 cups beef stock 4-6 smallish carrots, peeled and cut into 1 inch pieces 3-4 sprigs of fresh thyme (1 Tbsp. dried thyme will work) 2 Tbsp. butter, softened 2 Tbsp all purpose flour   Instructions  Season the beef with salt and pepper.  In a large (6 qt) saute pan or dutch oven, heat the olive oil over moderately high heat and brown the beef on all sides until there is no pink showing and the beef cubes are dark brown and even a little crusty.  Stir in the shallots and garlic and cook for about two minutes more.  Add the pearl onions and cook those until they're shiny and starting to turn translucent, about five minutes.  Stir in the mushrooms and continue cooking until they're just soft.  Add the wine and deglaze the pan, scraping up the browned bits that should be coating the pan surface. Allow the wine to boil away (reduce) until it's kind of syrupy and coats the other ingredients.  Add the beef stock, carrots and thyme, stir, and reduce heat to a slow simmer.  Simmer the stew for about 30-45 minutes, or until beef is fork tender. Taste and adjust seasoning.  Make a beurre manie by mashing together the butter and flour with a fork until it has a mealy consistency.  About 10-15 minutes before serving, stir the beurre manie into the stew to thicken the stock.  Serve hot, accompanied by fresh bread and good butter.

Ok but if you want to do this, this is how you do it:  Cut up a chicken breast into nugget sized peices and coat in seasoned flour (I use salt, pepper and cayene) and fry for a few minutes while your pasta boils. When the pasta is cooked throw it in with the chicken and toss in some pasta sauce. I used jarred pasta sauce because I'm lazy. Mix everything to coat and sprinkle on some parmesean and shredded mozzarella. Put the pan under a broiler just until the cheese melts.  That's all there's to it."

tonightsdinner,2x02bi,manasource123,1 point,Tue Feb 24 18:20:41 2015 UTC,"Let me start by saying I absolutely love sauerkraut and just the thought of it has set the cog wheels in motion on making something similar with kraut.   In this particular situation it wouldn't have worked though. There is alot more then just sausage in the ""stuffing"" above and it had a very Italian flavor to it. The sausage stuffing was actually Italian sausage, Italian breadcrumbs, crushed tomato, onion, jalapeño, egg, olive oil, mushroom. Topped with mozzarella cheese.   Sauerkraut need to be used more often though. Sauerkraut lovers need to unite."

tonightsdinner,2wvy4k,airial,8,Mon Feb 23 17:09:46 2015 UTC,"Not the most round or beautiful meatballs on earth, but they were damn delicious.  Next time I will probably double the sauce as that was one of my favorite parts of the dish. And I like things spicy - these were not very spicy at all and were generously doused in Sriracha while eating.  Could probably throw some chili sauce/red pepper flakes into the sauce as well to spice it up a bit. I blame the bottled thai curry paste I was using for being less than spicy.  I also add garlic to everything I make, so I added 1 clove into the meatball mix and another 3-4 in with the onions for the curry part. As far as I am concerned there is no such thing as too much garlic.  Recipe Here  Spicy Thai Turkey Meatballs  Makes 6 servings   4 shiitake mushrooms 1½ lbs. ground turkey (preferably dark meat) 2 tsp. minced ginger 2 tsp. Thai green curry paste, or more to taste 2 Tbsp. Asian fish sauce (nam pla nuoc nam; substitute soy sauce with a dash of Worcestershire sauce or anchovy paste if desired) 1 tsp. sugar 1 egg, lightly beaten ¹⁄3 c. green onions, white and green parts finely chopped ¼ c. chopped cilantro salt to taste 2 Tbsp. peanut oil 1 recipe Spicy Asian Dipping Sauce (optional, see recipe below)   Pour boiling water over mushrooms to cover and soak at least 30 minutes (up to 3 hours) to soften. Remove and discard stems, and finely chop mushrooms.  In a medium bowl, combine mushrooms, turkey, ginger, curry paste, fish sauce, sugar, egg, green onions, and cilantro. Fry up a sample and taste. Add more curry paste and salt to taste. Mix until well blended and form into 1-inch meatballs.  Heat peanut oil in a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add meatballs and cook until all sides are nicely browned, about 10 minutes total. Serve as is or with Asian Dipping Sauce; replace ¹⁄3 cup soy sauce with ¹⁄3 cup Asian fish sauce.  Curry option  You can also serve these meatballs in a Thai green curry sauce. Once meatballs are done, remove from pan and set aside. Add ½ cup finely chopped onions and 1 teaspoon minced garlic to the fat in the pan. Over medium heat, stir mixture until soft, about 5 minutes. Add a 13½-ounce can unsweetened coconut milk and scrape up any brown bits from bottom of pan. Whisk in 2 or more tablespoons Thai green curry paste and ¼ cup freshly squeezed lime juice. Taste and add curry paste and lime juice to taste. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, and add back meatballs. Simmer 5 minutes."

Batched seared the beef, then used some broth to de glaze the pot. Next reduce the liquid and fond, next toss in the onions. There is still a little grease leftover so my onions actually browned nicely. I dump the oats, and after stirring the oats with the garlic and onions.  Next its the carrots I give them head 10-5 minute head start, I pour the stock, and tomato broth onto the vegetables and oats. Bring the pot to low boil for a few minutes stir, and reduce to simmer. Toss in potatoes, I like my carrots aldente just a bit firm to the bite and potatoes that just about mushes on first bite. So I adjusted cooking time accordingly. I toss in the meat bring the pot up to a boil, for about two minutes, stirring and adding more spices, herbs, salt, pepper, garlic, etc to taste. Brought it down to a simmer, occasionally stirring, and tasting, right before its ready toss in the peas right before heating up to serve."

tonightsdinner,2wrwph,MadMoizelle,2,Sun Feb 22 23:18:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply. For the tortillas, I followed the instructions on this website (http://whatscookingamerica.net/CynthiaPineda/Tortilla/TortillaMaking.htm). The beans are boiled black beans, smashed and refried in vegetable oil with a touch of salt. Super easy and delicious! My mom would make these for our annual Christmas road trip to Mexico. They are a great snack, warm or cold. Enjoy."

tonightsdinner,2wq5ol,StagKen,2,Tue Feb 24 06:21:57 2015 UTC,I never liked grits until I learned about shrimp and grits.
tonightsdinner,2wq5ol,sgnmarcus,2,Sun Feb 22 13:19:14 2015 UTC,"Every time I have traveled to the South I have been disappointed by grits. They are bland to me. What were these Waffle Houses doing wrong? Full disclosure, I'm from New Jersey. I’m sure they're  delicious when done right."
tonightsdinner,2wq5ol,JackGrizzly,5,Sun Feb 22 14:58:30 2015 UTC,"You need a lot of butter and salt to make grits taste like anything. Grits on their own are not really supposed to be a flavor bomb. But, when you start adding things  to them (like cheese, peppers, shrimp, andouille, etc) they are a fantastic creamy compliment to the other flavors. The way they're cooked also matters. Grits cooked in water aren't as flavorful as grits cooked in stock and/or milk. Unfortunately you want get that at waffle house. Think of those as grits for people who already like grits.   Next time you travel down, check out a local spot in the town or city you're traveling to. Their cheese grits will likely blow the socks off WH. And if you're lucky, somewhere will be serving shrimp and grits, don't pass that up."

tonightsdinner,2wfva6,serenadingsirens,1 point,Thu Feb 19 21:33:58 2015 UTC,To be fair he puts syrup on everything haha
tonightsdinner,2wfva6,ethurmz,1 point,Thu Feb 19 22:11:10 2015 UTC,I think you'd be surprised. I personally use maple syrup as my primary sweetener in all my cooking as an alternative to sugar and honey. If you want a less pronounced maple flavour opt for a Canadian #1 Light maple syrup.
tonightsdinner,2wfva6,ethurmz,3,Fri Feb 20 01:29:20 2015 UTC,"I'm sure its a great sub for sugar, I'd just never use any of that for pasta/meatball dish. It doesn't need any kind of sweetener."
tonightsdinner,2wfva6,Silverlight42,3,Fri Feb 20 01:43:16 2015 UTC,In this dish I just used some #3 dark in the meat balls to give them a hint of maple flavour and some in the onions to help them caramelize.
tonightsdinner,2wfva6,selfcheckout,3,Sat Feb 21 20:41:44 2015 UTC,"looks great but near the end you really gotta cook the pasta in the sauce so that wonderful penne can absorb some properly, otherwise might as well be eating plain penne with a side of meatballs."
