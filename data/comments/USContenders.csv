USContenders,3duqpl,TeholtheOnly,2,Sun Jul 19 23:02:14 2015 UTC,Central Perk is the main setting for the TV show FRIENDS.  It's akin to MacLarins for How I Met Your Mother or that diner in Seinfeld in that mostly all episodes take place in there.

USContenders,3dn852,CaptenCrook,5,Fri Jul 17 17:20:18 2015 UTC,I'm sorry your request to add this player has been denied. According to the USC records Mr. $ was never dropped from Jukes for Jesus and therefore is not elligible to be acquired by your team.
USContenders,3dn852,Undusted,2,Fri Jul 17 17:30:01 2015 UTC,HA. Fence was never dropped from JFJ either. Think of it as replacing our roster expansion slot.
USContenders,3dn852,Undusted,3,Fri Jul 17 17:35:55 2015 UTC,Former NLTP JfJ players are exempt from the rule requiring them to be dropped from USC JfJ before they are elligible. So Fence was elligible to be on Dropped from JFJ because he was a NLTP JfJ player. Unfortunately since Mr. $ was neither on NLTP JfJ and also wasnt dropped from USC JfJ he is not elligible to be picked up by your team.

Where Caps Against Humanity defeated Cappin Planet 10 minutes after you posted this here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/USContenders/comments/3dgg76/results_caps_against_humanity_defeats_cappin/  Which puts you out of range.

USContenders,3dgf0t,Slama_Banana,3,Thu Jul 16 02:09:47 2015 UTC,We make a legal challenge and its gets nullified because another team coincidentally had a game that ended within 30 minutes of our challenge. What a dumb rule.

USContenders,3dcgeg,Destar,20,Wed Jul 15 04:38:57 2015 UTC,"As the ""offender"" I agree with JfJ. I was playing under my registered name so the rule doesn't apply in this situation, but cherry-picking of rules is ridiculous. If it's there, enforce it. It's no wonder the mods have trouble getting people to abide by it when there are no repurcussions for breaking the written rule."
USContenders,3dcgeg,ace625,6,Wed Jul 15 06:47:27 2015 UTC,"Hijacking the top comment to note that I was the one who pushed for this rule in the first place. It's not hard for players to log in under their registered name, and it makes things easier for everybody concerned when it comes to records and disputes (A. non-registered names makes it impossible to tell if someone is smurfing, B. mandatory registered names prevents shit like everybody on the team name swapping, C. with registered names you know exactly who played in a match if you need to go back and review screenshots for whatever reason, etc.)--and it should be enforced as originally written. Rules are there for a reason; if players think they're above them, they can deal with the consequences. Enforcing them arbitrarily or not at all just leads to messes like this. Just my 2c, but I'm just a bystander now so whatever :D  NB: E and crew run a tight ship so I'm sure they have their reasons."
USContenders,3dcgeg,quassus,8,Wed Jul 15 15:17:00 2015 UTC,"I know you know I was the most vocal adversary to the rule when it was posted. Surprisingly to me, the rule put into place actually received a decent amount of support by USC members (if you look at upvote counts). I can accept a rule if it is something a majority supports it. The problem is it was never enforced. Because the rule went unenforced, there are now no consequences to playing under non-registered/non-official USC registered names, which makes the rule useless for what it's intended (prevent smurfing).   It looks like the rule is being changed, which is good for the league in my opinion."
USContenders,3dcgeg,LEBRONstarJAMES,3,Wed Jul 15 15:33:07 2015 UTC,"Well, I still think it's a good rule, but I agree with you that it's useless unless enforced."

USContenders,3dcgeg,LEBRONstarJAMES,4,Wed Jul 15 15:13:51 2015 UTC,"I think the rule is too harsh, but I also think that players should absolutely be forced to play with their registered names. How about altering the rule to a cap penalty, penalizing the offenders' team between one to three caps for breaking the rule? That penalty more fits the crime IMO.  You guys are not obligated to enforce this rule in a 12-0 shellacking pre-rule discussion. Some people are overreacting."

Those are the rules. We don't pick and choose which we are following.  Get rid of the rule if you want, but it's on the books right now, so we should be following it.

E and the rest of the USC mod team puts so much time into USC its ridiculous and most of the players on the losing team are being childish in this thread. Give the mods a break.  If you don't like the rule or feel it should be changed why don't you make a post about your issues with the rule and possible solutions. Not about how the USC mods are bad for refusing to enforce a rule that's never been enforced. Because it really does sound like your just salty about a loss or whining about a rule to create drama.
USContenders,3dcgeg,Undusted,5,Wed Jul 15 06:28:02 2015 UTC,"This thread is about the rule, see title. The fact that mods are refusing to enforce the rule is worth mentioning when discussing the rule. This is not a thread targeting E or the mods.

If so they were what E said to us in mumble when we talked to him on there sorry we cant provide a link to spoken word and we didnt think to record E while he was being a douche to us in mumble. Also if you take out all of Hyamez's shit posts almost every other comment is debate about the rule. I can see how you and others would think we are just salty about a loss, but we arent at all we have been beaten worse than that before (Marquis if you are reading fuck you dont bring it up lol)."
USContenders,3dcgeg,Undusted,0,Wed Jul 15 11:44:34 2015 UTC,"That is what I meant by quotes and I don't expect you to have recorded E. He probably did say something like that given the circumstances and I don't blame him based on how rude some of your team's players have been in this thread. Still I doubt they're direct quotes. Either way its a he said she said situation and I'll pay attention to the comments I can actually see. Most of which include your teammates acting rudely while E responds pretty reasonably.  The way the post was worded indicates that /u/Destar is salty about a loss and doesn't really care about the actual rule, only lack of enforcement. Most of the actual rule discussion in this thread is between other USC players. Most of your teams comments in this thread are bashing the USC mods lack of enforcement."
USContenders,3dcgeg,oSo_Squiggly,5,Wed Jul 15 14:55:17 2015 UTC,"Now this doesnt make it right, but I cant blame my teammates for making rude comments to E when he has been nothing but rude to us since this whole ordeal started"
USContenders,3dcgeg,ndprice,-1,Wed Jul 15 16:55:56 2015 UTC,And I can't blame E for making a rude comments in mumble when your team has been nothing but rude to him since this whole ordeal started.
USContenders,3dcgeg,Undusted,2,Wed Jul 15 17:06:20 2015 UTC,"That is just blatently wrong we really havent been all that rude to him at all. Also any of the things which are even debateably rude towards E were well after he was rude on mumble and on his comments in this thread. He has been nothing but dismissive of the problems and his only points so far has essentially boiled down to ""lol you got crushed get over it"" and ""we know the rule is shit"". He has taken no responsibility for the issue even though he is the biggest cause of what happened and was the biggest proponent of the rule which he now claims is trivial. I understand he can change his mind on rules, but that is a huge 180 from being the biggest supporter to now esentally calling us babies for trying to jokingly using the rule. I am glad that the rule is being removed or altered or whatever they are doing with it because it really is stupid. As for what we want really I just want an apology from him for being an ass to us and for him to admit he was wrong. You simply cannot blame the players for the mods choosing not to enforce certain rules and not communicating to anyone that they were no longer enforcing said rule, how you dont understand that baffles me, honestly."
USContenders,3dcgeg,RonSpawnsonTP,0,Wed Jul 15 17:13:16 2015 UTC,"I was making a point that I could say the exact same thing about your team that you said about E. Its a he said, she said situation. I have no idea what side is true.  I've always known E to be a reasonable guy but I wouldn't be surprised if he said those things on mumble. They also could've easily been twisted. I just don't know what happened.  I've seen him get pissed before at other USC players when I was on his the Whitecaps in NLTP S3. In pretty much every situation they were the ones that started the drama and decided it was cool to interrupted our practice with it. His annoyance was almost always justified in my mind.  I also disagree with the rule. I just don't really care that much about it and noone really has until your team made a big deal about it. But maybe that's a good thing. It should be changed. I just don't like the way you went about it with this thread.   I still think your team is being rude and maybe E was too. But in this thread its pretty clearly your team that's coming off as rude and most of the USC mods posts have been very reasonable."

Not sure what people are actually arguing about but to respond to the post:   I would like to hear other members of the community weigh in on how they feel about this rule and whether it should be enforced as it is stated in this instance.   The rule is necessary to prevent smurfing. Never been a real fan of forfeit as the punishment for violating the rule since it seemed pretty harsh for one player's mistake to influence the outcome of the entire game. However, the rule is a rule and should've been enforced from the get go, but also understandable that mods decided to have an unofficial ""grace period"" given the harsh punishment. Since then most captains and USC players are aware that mods are in agreement that the punishment is harsh and are in the process of amending the rule. So I don't know what this post is trying to accomplish. Amend the rule fast? E should respond more professionally? Or do you want to get a forfeit win after the loss?"
USContenders,3dcgeg,Omidio,2,Wed Jul 15 04:41:07 2015 UTC,"So I don't know what this post is trying to accomplish. Amend the rule fast? E should respond more professionally? Or do you want to get a forfeit win after the loss?   All of that except the last one. I didn't post this thread with the intention of getting a forfeit win, although if the mods chose to enforce the rule and a forfeit resulted I wouldn't be particularly perturbed. I framed the post as if I was requesting an enforcement because frankly it garners much more attention this way. But in reality I don't think any JfJ members care either way if we get the forfeit.  I mainly wanted to point out that there exists a rule that the mods have no intention of enforcing and also shed some light on unprofessional mod behavior. Obviously E doesn't care about coming off as professional, and that's fine I guess, so that issue has been resolved. And as for bringing attention to the topic and actually getting the rule changed instead of month or so of nothing happening: I feel like this thread has worked towards that goal immensely.  So thanks for your input, the more the community interacts and gives input, the better we will be as a whole."

Thanks for the clarification.   Although I would have preferred this to be sent to mods directly, it's also not a bad idea to bring this to light publicly given how long this rule has been in a quasi ""grace period""/""amendment state"". I would have preferred a bit less ""dramatic"" fashion though..."

USContenders,3dcgeg,TheCrazyCanadian44,2,Wed Jul 15 20:23:15 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell, both of the sides are correct:  JFJ's POV: they are going to get a loss for something in which they can get a win legally. If governments offered free 3,000 dollar checks, no strings attached, albeit was frowned up: would you take it?  You may try. You may take it. You may joke about it. But when it's denied- that is wrong.    Imo rules are rules. They should be enforced, and it's a big pet peeve when people don't enforce rules. Mods, they asked for it, it's legal, they should get it. Done. It doesn't matter if it's childish. FYI that's an insult to all the children playing Tagpro and being completely upstanding citizens.   Also, if E was rude he should immediately apologize. He has backed me up a few times when people didn't agree to me but no matter what it's important to keep everyone happy.   E, etc's POV:  That being said, JFJ should also apologize for being rude to e.   Although it's completely legal and completely technically right. That doesn't make it cool. People love those who win. And lose with respect.   He runs the league. And that is very very difficult. Fixing the rules to benefit over 500 different player options is more than hard. Cut him some slack  My POV: everyone should chill out. It's actually semi-chill already, but this rule should be put on hold immediately.   Also, the hockey/101010101010101 rule should be changed. But that's not really related.   Conclusion: nobody really did anything wrong. Keep it civil, move on."

If nobody brings up the issue of someone using an unregistered name or a smurf account, then the mods aren't going to realize that something is amiss.  We had a similar problem a while back where the team we were playing had a player using a white-name. We raised the issue with that team mid-game but nothing was done to solve the problem. As a result, we informed E about it and discussed it with the other team's captain. Ultimately we decided to replay the game instead of forfeiting the other team although that option was always there.  If we had just left the issue as-is then nothing would have been done about it. The mods have enough work as-is and it is very easy to miss cases like this within the dozens of results posts made on a daily basis."
USContenders,3dcgeg,TheThirstIsReal1,6,Wed Jul 15 09:17:39 2015 UTC,"To reiterate: The mods' tried to get everyone to log in, but it was a huge problem for a lot of teams, and the punishment of forfeiting a game for a player not logging in is obviously excessive.    We were told ""sorry that you got crushed"" and ""if you want to try running this league then good fucking luck"". I find this attitude toward refusing to enforce a clearly visible and understandable rule to be extremely unprofessional.    When I get paid for this altruistic service that I pour way too many hours into this league, that I do for all of you guys, get back to me about being ""unprofessional"". Make this clear: I don't owe anyone in this league anything. Quote that. Until then, I will continue to do my best servicing this league as impartially as possible for the whole league, treating everyone as an equal.  You're right to question this rule, and it's wrong that it's still in there if we are not enforcing it--but we are working on overhauling all of the rules. The rules are not perfect. Well done on identifying that. But you are wrong to shit the bed over it. Grow up, honestly."
USContenders,3dcgeg,RonSpawnsonTP,18,Wed Jul 15 18:04:11 2015 UTC,Pretty sure following the rules that are on the book is actually impartial instead of making an unofficial decision that you just arent going to enforce the rules anymore.
USContenders,3dcgeg,RonSpawnsonTP,8,Wed Jul 15 18:33:25 2015 UTC,"We're simply not enforcing the rule because the punishment is overly punitive on teams. Many teams have broken this rule in the past--my point is that we are not out to get Jukes for Jesus here. I'm trying to be as impartial as possible, and that includes not enforcing rules suddenly after identifying numerous infractions because one particular team got upset after a large loss."
USContenders,3dcgeg,dandeliondreamer,16,Wed Jul 15 04:53:33 2015 UTC,Didn't you (as in the USC commissioners) create and decide upon the punishments?  So you're not enforcing a rule you created because the punishment you created is too harsh in your opinion?  ok
USContenders,3dcgeg,Undusted,15,Wed Jul 15 04:56:33 2015 UTC,"Can we just be censured, I wanna be censured"
USContenders,3dcgeg,JohnnySZS,13,Wed Jul 15 05:02:08 2015 UTC,didn't you hear what happened to the last person that was censured...  Nothing.
USContenders,3dcgeg,Undusted,6,Wed Jul 15 05:07:50 2015 UTC,"Correct PK. The mods put in a ridiculous amount of effort to get teams to play under their registered names, and, after a while, it was clear that we were fighting a losing battle in a league that should not be managed that intensely. We truly underestimated teams' ability to get their players to login under their names listed in the spreadsheet. I know that would seem like something that is incredibly simple to many, but it's an unbelievable difficult thing for many teams here to manage."
USContenders,3dcgeg,Undusted,11,Wed Jul 15 05:10:05 2015 UTC,"I'll preface this by admitting I've only skimmed some of the top comments in this thread, but isn't the easiest solution to simply enforce the forfeit? I find it pretty hard to believe that teams would continue to play under unregistered names if they knew that there was a real consequence."
USContenders,3dcgeg,Undusted,8,Wed Jul 15 05:53:18 2015 UTC,"Yep, I would carpet bombing forfeits until people learned the rules."
USContenders,3dcgeg,Undusted,0,Wed Jul 15 05:17:59 2015 UTC,"Regardless of whether we should have to start off with, it's not reasonable to just randomly start right now because some team kicked up a fuss about it. Like I said elsewhere, we are taming down the overly punitive punishment for this infraction (that we believe is really important), which we think will be better for everyone involved."
USContenders,3dcgeg,Undusted,3,Wed Jul 15 09:33:08 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. Just make sure you enforce the new punishment :P"
USContenders,3dcgeg,syzlack,9,Wed Jul 15 10:22:25 2015 UTC,You were probably fighting a losing battle because as you said in other posts you never enforced the rule. Why would the teams follow a rule that you clearly werent going to do anything about.
USContenders,3dcgeg,JohnnySZS,-1,Wed Jul 15 12:39:56 2015 UTC,O shit PK Hitler dropping bombs on us
USContenders,3dcgeg,chinaldo,5,Wed Jul 15 19:08:47 2015 UTC,"We're simply not enforcing the rule because the punishment is overly punitive on teams.   Have you thought of removing/changing the rule? Leaving the rule with a clear punishment, then not enforcing it is misleading and I can understand why people might be frustrated by this.  Why keep the rule if you are never going to enforce it?"
USContenders,3dcgeg,JohnnySZS,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:21:49 2015 UTC,"We are working on an overhaul of the rules right now, but it's taking longer than I had anticipated. We're not removing the rule, we're going to update it so it makes more sense. We're still committed to making sure teams play with logged in players that the moderators can assess. This is the first time any actual issues have come up with it; I was happy leaving it in until the update before now."
USContenders,3dcgeg,syzlack,12,Wed Jul 15 05:09:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just letting you know if you have a rule that is unenforced and don't change it for 7 weeks, people will probably get upset when it is not enforced but still there.  Why not remove the rule immediately in the interim to reflect the fact that it is not being enforced? Or amend it to say (note: this rule actually isn't a rule currently). You can fix it back once your ""overhaul"" is done and you plan on enforcing the rule again.  I don't see your hesitancy here, and you are bringing on the frustration yourself."
USContenders,3dcgeg,JohnnySZS,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:03:00 2015 UTC,"That's fair. I'll talk to the mods about removing it for now! I guess with USCM and some other drama, rule updates like this have been on the back-burner of late, particularly given that it wasn't an issue at all before today."
USContenders,3dcgeg,NeonAura,7,Wed Jul 15 07:06:26 2015 UTC,"Ok can you stop trying to make this seem like we are mad about a big loss we are chilling in a channel with twigboyz right now, we dont care. We have been saying this rule is shit since the very thread you introduced it. So if you want to go ahead and just admit we were right about the rule in the first place and you were wrong that would be great."
USContenders,3dcgeg,Undusted,-1,Wed Jul 15 07:10:02 2015 UTC,"As I said before, we are working on overhauling the rule. Since it was never enforced, clearly the mods believe it was a mistake. What do you want here? I believe that any adult would have just brought it up with reasonable counterpoints in modmail rather than spamming unwarranted vitriol in several threads immediately after a 12-0 loss to the infringing team."
USContenders,3dcgeg,NeonAura,9,Wed Jul 15 07:27:59 2015 UTC,"I'll say what I want. Just because something was never enforced doesn't mean the rule gets thrown out. It's still in the rules. Twigboyz beat us fair and square, and we accept that. HOWEVER, according to the rules, we get the forfeit win. The truth is that, if we had really asked for the forfeit win and wanted it, it would have been necessary that you would grant it to us, and it is clear that that would not have happened. I'll admit this thread got a little out of hand (though it was funny as balls), but there needs to be some accountability for this.    FWIW the reason for Jfj doing this was not to ruin the spirit of the game, but rather to call out a flaw in the current system. The same rule set that doesn't allow us to play hockey should be enforced fully and completely, not picked and chosen."
USContenders,3dcgeg,Undusted,-4,Wed Jul 15 05:07:53 2015 UTC,"The truth is that, if we had really asked for the forfeit win and wanted it, it would have been necessary that you would grant it to us   You are wrong. We are not robots. The rules are there as tools for the moderators to use to make this league as enjoyable as possible for all players, and as guides for the players to play by. Since we have never enforced this rule, it would have been wrong for us to enact it here just because a team got upset. While the rules are not perfect, enacting it here would have been seriously bad moderation. Sorry you guys just don't seem to be able to grasp that fact."
USContenders,3dcgeg,NeonAura,10,Wed Jul 15 05:14:35 2015 UTC,Being arbitrary with the rules you follow is just dumb for the league you have to see that right? Also it is funny to me how in every single one of your responses you are still trying to say we are just mad we got beat badly. I personally guarantee you that not a single member of my team is mad or salty at twigboyz or about losing in any way shape or form so you are just being an ass about it at this point.
USContenders,3dcgeg,JohnnySZS,-3,Wed Jul 15 05:46:45 2015 UTC,See my response below. You're not presenting anything that I've addressed previously so I'm done wasting my time here. If you have any further questions then see some of my repetitive responses in this thread. If you want to present my continuation as commissioner of this league to a popular vote then do so. I will happily step down if most people want me to.
USContenders,3dcgeg,NeonAura,4,Wed Jul 15 05:53:15 2015 UTC,"I am not trying to have you step down or forced out, you have done countless things for the good of USC and I think you are a good commisioner I want that to be clear. But in your repetitive responses you havent said anything that I see as a valid counterpoint/response to my comments."
USContenders,3dcgeg,JohnnySZS,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:02:02 2015 UTC,idk we dont really want anything we are mostly just fucking around at this point tbh
USContenders,3dcgeg,NeonAura,9,Wed Jul 15 06:05:01 2015 UTC,"I feel an obligation to respond to criticisms of how this league is run to the extent that I've covered everything I can, because I fucking care about this league and everyone in it. But if people are just wasting my time with bating comments and questions then that pisses me off more than anything. I'm deeply unhappy about the actions of several people here. I hope you're having a great time I guess."
USContenders,3dcgeg,TotesMessenger,7,Wed Jul 15 06:19:38 2015 UTC,"Ok I will level with you. My comments were almost completely serious. I think you are handling/deciding on this incorrectly. It shouldnt be a thing the mods can just do to cherry pick which rules that are currently on record that they are going to enforce and which ones they aren't. Doing so just sets a bad precedent that I dont want to see set in USC. If you feel that the punishment is too severe than you should have removed it once you as a mod team had decided that you all/a majority of you felt that way, or at the very least make some sort of a post letting everybody know that you are in the process of altering/removing the rule so we know that the rule doesnt matter anymore. I know this is a really dumb rule to bring this up about, but it is more about the precedent at this point than anything since it is obvious nothing is going to come of this. I agree that we shouldnt get the forfeit btw that would be really dumb. The point where I actually got annoyed and started to flame you a bit is where you act like we are just butthurt about a loss and dismiss anything we are saying. As a mod that is not how you should act by just essentially trying to make fun of our team for no real reason, the score of our game had no effect on what we were saying. The last time we raised a fuss about this rule was actually after we won a game and the other team didnt have primary registered names, so its not like we are just trying to snake a win here.  I am sorry that some people were making dumb posts in this thread that wasted your time although you could probably just ignore them. Honestly though I just want to be able to play hockey again and have fun with my old novice teammates and some other new additions. Thanks for helping to run the league even though we have been diasagreeing a lot lately. <3 Brake"
USContenders,3dcgeg,Snowball_TagPro,5,Wed Jul 15 05:23:36 2015 UTC,"See my response to Bowlarity. As I have tried to express multiple times, the mods are interested in being as fair as possible to all players in the league and the rules are just a dumb tool to do that. While the rule seemed reasonable when it was brought in, it was quickly obvious that it was not going to work out. Enacting the rule now would be grossly unfair.  I'm actually done with this. I hate leaving things open when you inevitably respond to this comment with the same arguments, but life is too short to rehash this again."
USContenders,3dcgeg,Omidio,6,Wed Jul 15 05:26:32 2015 UTC,"Ok I am done with it too then, now instead of trying to insult my team you are just saying dumb shit ""the rules are just a dumb tool"" lmao the whole fucking league is based on these rules tf do you mean? Also TIL that it is ""grossly unfair"" to enforce rules that every single team and player in this league knows about."
USContenders,3dcgeg,halfmoon_kid,8,Wed Jul 15 05:47:05 2015 UTC,"I'm actually done with this. I hate leaving things open when you inevitably respond to this comment with the same arguments, but life is too short to rehash this again.   Reminds me of the kind of things I would say to users when I was a 15 year old internet forum moderator. This is an honest observation and I don't really mean to attack you by saying it.  [/u/Undusted](Brake) and [/u/JohnnySZS](Bowl) actually brought up a lot of really good points that I think you overlooked, so if life isn't too short maybe you can give it a re-read. Specifically,   It shouldnt be a thing the mods can just do to cherry pick which rules that are currently on record that they are going to enforce and which ones they aren't. Doing so just sets a bad precedent that I dont want to see set in USC. If you feel that the punishment is too severe than you should have removed it once you as a mod team had decided that you all/a majority of you felt that way, or at the very least make some sort of a post letting everybody know that you are in the process of altering/removing the rule so we know that the rule doesnt matter anymore.   Don't regard the rules as dumb tools that have the sole purpose of maintaining  fairness. Rules in any community, especially a structured league such as this, have immense importance in how culture itself is influenced. When you choose to disregard the rules without any kind of warning you hurt that culture by undermining the users faith in the moderation team.  And for the record,   Do I think JfJ should win by forfeit?    Personally, no. But from an objective technical viewpoint, yes. Like you said, we are not robots.   Do I think the rule in question is bad and needs to go?    Yes.   Do I think the this conflict over the rules is being handled well?    No.   Do I think that the mod team should make this reworking of the rules more transparent so users can know when to expect certain rules being ignored?    Yes.   Do I think that you are taking a lot of the points made in this thread too personally?   Yes. No one has anything against you E (At least I don't, maybe some others do lol). You seem like an alright guy. So relax and discuss these things maturely (with some exceptions for memes), we're all in a community together here. So let's act like it."
USContenders,3dcgeg,LEBRONstarJAMES,2,Wed Jul 15 06:01:35 2015 UTC,"I don't understand what you want from this situation.   E has said ""Yeah, the rule is stupid, we aren't going to enforce it, and we're in the process of changing the rules""  It seems like that is exactly what you would want, as you have said   we were never going to actually make you forfeit that game, you making the name change post afterwards was all on you man. Just as we would never actually going to make twigboyz forfeit in this case   So you don't want the rule enforced  and    the rule is dumb it should be gone bottom line.   Which E has said is happening. Why are you unhappy?"
USContenders,3dcgeg,halfmoon_kid,5,Wed Jul 15 06:14:27 2015 UTC,"We don't want it enforced because we don't like the rule. But it should have been enforced because it's in the rules that we all agree to by playing USC. What we want is some accountability for the cherry-picking of the rules. I know this is all getting out of hand, but all this was was to show how there is a flaw in the current system."
USContenders,3dcgeg,Undusted,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:04:02 2015 UTC,"The rule doesn't even apply because Alvin had his name registered, albeit he changed his registered name."
USContenders,3dcgeg,halfmoon_kid,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:50:46 2015 UTC,"According to E, the primary registered name is the one listed in the roster, so technically it is a violation, but they just interpreted it differently I think."
USContenders,3dcgeg,JohnnySZS,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:37:27 2015 UTC,"Alright, I was confused because your teamates have said that they don't want a forfeit win. So you do want the rule enforced?"
USContenders,3dcgeg,halfmoon_kid,2,Wed Jul 15 21:43:40 2015 UTC,"Nah. We don't want it enforced because it's a bad rule and excessive. However, I t should have been enforced because it's in the rules, and there shouldn't have been dispute. Hope that clears it up a little more. But it's all over now anyways."
USContenders,3dcgeg,JohnnySZS,-2,Wed Jul 15 22:02:35 2015 UTC,"Let me put it simply: you guys take this league, and especially this particular rule, way too seriously.  It is asinine that you harass other players (like me) and put up a stink about all of this.    Rules require interpretation.  The spirit of this rule is to prevent people from smurfing, playing for other players, etc.  Me playing as DrPrizm instead of Prizm shouldn't really be an issue, but you made it that way.  In a world where interpretation is okay, one can say ""yeah, the rule isn't in place to dick over Prizm.""  In the world you want, my team would forfeit if I play under DrPrizm.  Or if anybody plays in a similar position elsewhere.  You guys need to chill out.  You're acting like children, raising a stink for pretty much no reason.  Unless you think someone was smurfing or playing for someone else (which you should make clear now), you're making a mountain out of a molehill.     Finally, E wouldn't say this because he wants people in the league, but USC isn't even an institutionalized league.  Unlike MLTP, you could very easily create your own league to compete against it.  So, how's this: if you are so grossly disgusted by the way the league is run, go run your own.  I think it'd be a lot better if you guys weren't around being assholes to everyone."
USContenders,3dcgeg,ndprice,5,Wed Jul 15 21:47:13 2015 UTC,"Damn you are still salty about that? As I said when you were bitching about it before we were never going to actually make you forfeit that game, you making the name change post afterwards was all on you man. Just as we would never actually going to make twigboyz forfeit in this case the rule is dumb it should be gone bottom line. As for taking the league too seriously you obviously dont know any of us if you truly think this."
USContenders,3dcgeg,InTheMoodTagpro,4,Wed Jul 15 22:00:45 2015 UTC,"I don't know any of you.  That is absolutely right.  So, if you didn't know someone, and they started harassing you about having a different name in-game, how would you take it?  As a joke?  Knowing that there is a rule that you technically should be under the username registered with USC?    The thing about jokes is that they seem funny when you're in on them.  They often seem cruel when you're not.  You guys have seemed like jerks to me since then, and I'm reading that into these posts.  I think that's in part due to that experience, but also due to the way you're still handling it.    Making a big public post and having a circus about a rule that's literally not harming anyone by being in place just seems silly to me.  That seems like taking the league way too seriously, but maybe I'm wrong."
USContenders,3dcgeg,Undusted,0,Wed Jul 15 07:59:18 2015 UTC,"I understand what you are saying and I apologize for us giving you a hard time but I do want you to know we werent trying to be cruel or harrass you, only giving you a hard time. But honestly yes I would take it as a joke especially in a non-serious league like USC. I dont think we have had interactions with you since that happened so I'm not sure how we have been jerks to you since then. Also I believe at the time of our incident oSo was still on my minors team with me so I was giving him a rough time, but I could be wrong about that it was a while ago and I'm not sure what the exact timeline is. Also we wanted to show supersans and the other mods how dumb of a rule it was to try and get it changed and since he was on your team it ws a good opportunity to do so. It apparently didnt change their mind, but now they agree with us so thats good I guess. We really havent been a serious team for a while now although we were at one point shortly after lebron mutinied me for the captain spot. At one point we legitimately only wanted to play hockey in USC which was the most fun we have had playing USC, but now thats banned so we just go with the next most fun map for us in TWP. Again I apologize if you thought we were being cruel/dicks to you. I seriously thought you knew we were kidding around and only realized you were mad at us when you made the post to officially change your name so our/my bad for that. EDIT: Also sorry for the post you replied to it was rude of me to say you were still salty and bitching."
USContenders,3dcgeg,TheThirstIsReal1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:29:43 2015 UTC,"Sorry to you guys for being a little harsh.  I felt sleighted, but I should've clarified with you instead of letting it fume here.  Again, it was the way I read it, but obviously not the way you intended it.  I'm seeing your reasoning a lot better at this point, and I hope the mods can fix the issue."
USContenders,3dcgeg,TheCrazyCanadian44,2,Wed Jul 15 18:23:55 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing the point (sorry if you're not). The point is that the rules are being cherry-picked. That's definitely a serious issue. The rule is supposed to be pedantic. There shouldn't be no breaking the rule a little and breaking the rule a lot. The way it's written, it's pretty black and white, allowing no room for confusion or dispute. ""Spirit of the game"" can be interpreted many different ways, but the rule cannot. That's why I believe the rules are there, to be the ultimate judge of situations like this. E disagrees with me here, and I respect it. It's the reason we made this post; to hear from others.    Like we've all said, we've always been against this rule, but to see how a clearly written rule is not being enforced sets a bad precedent, like Brake said.    I'm sorry if you've ever felt harassed by us, if I remember correctly I copy-pasted the rule a bunch of times, but believe me, that was all done in a joking manner, and if you didn't like that, I'm sorry.    And if you could refrain from personally insulting us, that would be cool too."
USContenders,3dcgeg,TheThirstIsReal1,2,Wed Jul 15 19:04:03 2015 UTC,"Okay, let me say at the top, I've been pretty harsh in the way I've addressed you guys.  ""It was all done in a joking manner"" is so hard to tell when I don't even know you guys, as one of your teammates pointed out.  So I've read you guys as really being jerks about all of this all along.  Maybe you're not intending that.  But the way you have raised the issue, here and in the past, has made it seem like you're being jerks about it.    The problem with this rule is that they are trying to solve one serious problem: people playing for others, smurfing, etc.  By having the rule written the way it is, if they were to enforce it 100%, anyone playing not under their registered name would result in a forfeit to their respective teams.  But the spirit of the rule is to prevent smurfing, not to prevent ""Prizm"" from playing under his other registered account ""DrPrizm.""    That's where interpretation seems totally reasonable to me.  The rule is in place to prevent major dickery, not for a scenario like mine.  The commissioners haven't been enforcing the rule because they haven't encountered a scenario of major dickery; but if they did, they would have a rule to point to.    Could they change the rule?  Yeah, definitely.  Might be tough though.  What do you say?  Does everybody really have to have a green name?  And if they don't, how do you still prevent smurfing or other BS?    You guys haven't gone about this in a polite manner, ever.  And I don't really understand why it is you're so upset about this rule.  When did the rule harm anybody or anything?  If its only harm is ""it isn't iron-clad!!!!"" then I don't see that as a big enough problem to merit the way you guys are treating it."
USContenders,3dcgeg,TheThirstIsReal1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:25:34 2015 UTC,"So our main divide is ""what is intended by the rule"" vs ""what the rule says."" That's understandable. If I understand correctly, you believe that the rule is a general guideline to stop smurfing. I agree with that, but to me, the rule is also written to be intentionally over-inclusive, to prevent any type of dispute or confusion or bad precedent that may occur, so even if the intention was not there, the rule should be enforced anyways, because, according to the rules, it was a violation. The forfeit penalty is definitely too harsh, but it's in the official rules.    For any impolite comments from our team, I apologize, but I feel like we have been going about this in a mostly professional manner. Hopefully at the end of all this, we all can realize that we're all good people, just with different opinions. Once again, I apologize again if we sounded like jerks on Mumble. Hope you can understand that that was not our intention."
USContenders,3dcgeg,TheThirstIsReal1,4,Wed Jul 15 15:40:35 2015 UTC,"I think your characterization is fair.  And I agree with your assessment of the rule.  It was overly broad, when it'd be better to just make a rule that says you can't smurf/play for someone else/whatever.  Perhaps the new rule could read something like ""players must be able to provide adequate evidence that they are not smurfing or playing for another player.""  Still requires interpretation, but it'd be pretty easy for most players to show that they were in Mumble, etc.    I really appreciate your being calm in your response.  You've done better than I did.  I won't be holding anything against you guys as a result of this.  We're all just people playing a game of balls, lol"
