Brazil,3e5aoc,prophecycake,6,Wed Jul 22 01:50:54 2015 UTC,It depends on where in the country you are. Fortaleza is very different from curitiba and really really different from Rio
Brazil,3e5aoc,ehayes3,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:13:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess that makes sense, I could have assumed that in a place like Rio it would be much more common to see thongs compared to many other parts of the country. I guess I was really only considering the coast. Thanks for the input!"
Brazil,3e5aoc,Morthanc,3,Wed Jul 22 04:17:52 2015 UTC,"Many variables. I would personally say, that the transition is between 12 to 14 years old.  Usually brazilian girls are mostly fully developed by the time they're like 15. So although 12yo to 13yo isn't veeery common, girls +14years old with thong bikinis are much more common.  Some girls, regardless of age, don't like using thong bikinis, though. Usually they use a normal thong bikini, but also wearing a shorts. This is were family background really kicks in. My sisters and mother simply don't like 'exposing themselves'."
Brazil,3e5aoc,Montgomery-Cavendish,5,Wed Jul 22 12:53:34 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess it depends on the family and social background. Usually upper middle class and upper class people dress conservatively, with american style of beach swimsuit for women and hammocks or shorts for men."

Brazil,3e3gd4,rolsen,6,Tue Jul 21 17:42:39 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, I just finished traveling through Brazil for about 9 weeks. I'm American btw! So, the biggest culture shock for me was the concept of personal space. People would be all in my personal space when in line for things, even when paying for my groceries! It bothered me at first, but I sorta got used to it. Oh, and the staring. Where I come from, staring is rude and is seen as we have a problem. But in Brazil (in some of the cities I visited), it was more out of curiosity.  I think people were confused as to why I was speaking English and not Portuguese fluently! Alot of people assumed I was Brazillian lol.  However, in Salvador, people knew immediately that I was American and many tried to take advantage of that fact,  because of the common stereotype that ""Americans are rich"". I also visited Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo and NO ONE cared that I was a foreigner. I don't think you will be viewed negatively as a foreigner. I think the worst is that some scammer/tout/beggars will target you for your money because you are American.  Since you know Spanish,  it shouldn't be too hard to understand or read Portuguese but speaking may be a different story. I knew the bare minimum of Portuguese and when I was unable to express my thoughts everyone was patient, tried their best to communicate and were  sometimes amused lol. Advice...be aware of your surroundings and just use your common sense just like in any huge city in the US. Take taxis or the metro (if you are really close to a station) at night.  Carry enough money for the day and a little extra in an easily accessible place just in case you do get robbed. Make Brazilian friends! They are the key to your integration into Brazilian culture/society. Hmm what else, don't bring anything to the beach but some money and yourself in a bathing suit. Depending on how popular the beach is, there will be people renting beach chairs, umbrellas,  and other people selling drinks, food, bathing suits, jewelry,  beach towels, and more.  Enjoy your visit!  PM me if you have any more questions or if I didn't answer them well. I'm on my cell so I apologize for the lack of formatting and spelling lol"
Brazil,3e3gd4,MsTreme,3,Tue Jul 21 21:35:03 2015 UTC,"You'll love Recife. This city has so much to offer!  I have some advice for you. Your girlfriend is from Recife, ok, but keep in mind that many people from here don't really care about local things, history, food, events, etc. You should research before coming about the things you think you might enjoy here. Don't just follow your gf around. Even if she doesn't like local food, for example, ask her to take you somewhere you can try it out. Even if she's not into all kinds of music, ask her to go with you to different parties. The keyword for recife is diversity. Going to new places, meeting new people and enjoying new things will be a great experience for you and your gf.  There are many american or UK style bars around, but I think the best ones are those that incorporate the city's vibe to their decoration, drinks, music choice, etc. You can find clubs and parties that play the most generic kind of electronic and pop music, but if you're into techno, deep/tech house, rock of all sorts, hip hop and local music (these genres are somewhat unpopular here, if compared to big pop hits) you can find something pretty much every week.  Also keep in mind that there are many amazing places around Recife, like Olinda (historic city with the best sightseeing spots only 20 minutes away), Carneiros (beautiful beach, not crowded, 1h30 away), and the semiarid region, which is incredible and very different. These are just three of the many destinations around here, so remember not to stay stuck in the big city and its traffic jams and shopping malls.  If she's coming back this winter, try to come during brazil's carnival, unless you're not into huge street parties and crowds (I actually like it, but thank god it only happens once a year heh).  About safety, the basic tips apply: don't walk in deserted streets; try not to use expensive accessories (watches, rings, etc); don't flash electronic devices unless you're sure it's a safe place; if it's late don't wait for a taxi on the street, call the taxi company or use your smartphone to request a car; don't go to the bank if it's too late, and keep your eyes open for people following you after you withdraw cash (people following and robbing you after you leave the bank is rare, but pay attention).  Cultural shock won't be a problem. Brazilians are very friendly and won't cause problems because of something like this. Portuguese is hard to learn, but Spanish will definitely help a lot. Some people speak good enough english, so you might be able to communicate, but I wouldn't count on it. You'll be looked at positively for being a foreigner, actually. People here are very interested in anything that comes from abroad, generally speaking hah  You'll be just fine, and as you'll be with a brazilian and local, you'll hardly face any problems."
Brazil,3e3gd4,fviz,2,Tue Jul 21 21:07:33 2015 UTC,"OK, foreigner perspective coming at you!  I am from Canada but went to Brazil under similar circumstances to you, my GF at the time, soon to be wife in about a month went down to travel, meet her family, get her dad's blessing on us getting married and what not and have the following info to offer you based on my experience....  Quick back story: I flew into Recife and had a 7+ hour layover in that airport before ending up in my final destination of Fortaleza and flew down on my own since my GF at the time wanted to go down in advance for routine doctor, dentist etc appointments before I got there so we could just travel so I did this leg of the trip on my own and we came back together.....  For starters, the only real people in the airport in Recife who spoke any English were the customs agent and 1 or 2 other people I flagged down (one at the American Airlines counter the other at an information desk).  You likely won't need to find much more than that if your GF meets you at the airport to pick you up.  Next, in answer to your questions I have some answers that might be helpful.  ""What would be the biggest culture shock for an American visiting Brazil?"" - In short, the country itself, its not America which I have been in lots being in a boarder province in Canada and its definitely not Canada either.  The best piece of advice is to be open to trying to new things and to experience a different culture than what you are used to.  ""Is Brazil, more specifically Recife, really as dangerous as everyone makes it seem?"" - In short, no, in more detail, just be smart about what you do.  As others have mentioned don't go waving your smartphone or camera around and don't try to ""dress like you are a rich person"" so as not to draw extra attention to yourself.  Listen to your GF she will know where you should and shouldn't go and at what times so trust her judgement.  ""How hard is it to learn the language? I have taken Spanish all my life and can read it decently. Would I be completely lost in the country since I can't speak Portuguese (I plan on trying to learn before I go) or would I be able to get by?"" - Having Spanish as a background will help you understand a lot of what is being said since Portuguese and Spanish are similar but I suggest doing some Portuguese courses or apps/software in advance to help.  At the very least download the Google Translate app with the Brazilian Portuguese offline pack so you can use the camera function on your phone to translate menus or signs if you need to.  You will not find many English speaking people in Brazil, I think in my month there I only met 3 people who actually spoke enough English for me to have a conversation with other than my GF but if you do they will likely be very happy to have a conversation with you and practice their English.  ""Would I be looked at negatively for being a foreigner?"" - Nope, you are there to travel and be a tourist and presumably spend money there to boost their local economy, plus Brazilians are very warm and friendly anyway so you will probably find them very welcoming.  ""What are some of the best and worst parts about Brazil?"" - For me the best part was the food and the beaches.  There is lots to try and lots to experience for food so make sure you take advantage of that.  The worst part for me personally was driving in Brazil.  I did quite a fair bit of driving and let me tell you, its not like Driving in the US or Canada.  People tend to do ""whatever they want"" so plan to have a local drive you places or take a cab if you can otherwise you might find it stressful.  ""Finally, any words of advice for me?"" - Take this opportunity to learn as much about your GF's culture and country as you can and think of it as a once in a lifetime opportunity to experience all that you can while down there cause who knows when you might get to go again.  Have an open mind and have fun!"
Brazil,3e3gd4,fadetoblack1985,2,Tue Jul 21 21:22:35 2015 UTC,"Is Brazil, more specifically Recife, really as dangerous as everyone makes it seem?   Not really. Don't wear clothing that screams ""tourist"" or gold watches, don't wander into the bad parts of town. Pay attention to your surroundings. That's it.   I have taken Spanish all my life and can read it decently. Would I be completely lost in the country since I can't speak Portuguese (I plan on trying to learn before I go) or would I be able to get by?   You would probably do OK. The languages are similar enough that a Portuguese listener can understand a Spanish speaker most of the time and vice-versa.   Would I be looked at negatively for being a foreigner?   Lol no. Why would that even be the case, I have no idea.   What are some of the best and worst parts about Brazil? Finally, any words of advice for me?   I've travelled all over Brazil (as a native of course) and the people have always been warm and welcoming. Always easy to make friends, find stuff to do, enjoy the scenery and the music. Stay away from ""international cuisine"" type restaurands and McDonald's clones and try the local food. Don't go to the tourist trap bars and restaurants, go to the places the locals patronize. With your gf that should be easy enough.  Bon voyage!"

Brazil,3e3gd4,Montgomery-Cavendish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:03:37 2015 UTC,Brazilian people love foreigners. No need to be worried.
Brazil,3e3gd4,lucas-Al-Lima,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:34:59 2015 UTC,"1- None, really. The most difficult thing i had with americans is the kiss on cheek thing, because here we do to almost everyone (oppose sex) outside a workplace. 2- Recife is dangerous, but not like movie dangerous. I have 21 years, lived in ALL (North, northeast, southeast, center) the Brasil and i was only mugged 1 time, drunk and by trannys. If it happen, just don't react. Give your things. Don't go with the cellphone in your hands or a camera in open places that you don't know, but it's just that. 3- I work in a lab and here we have a lot of foreigners. One american, and a lot of indians and they all agree that it's a difficult language to learn. But i knew Americans that were speaking sluently in 6 months. It really dependes. 4- Outside the work-place and universities a really few people speaks english, and i myself can't understand shit of spanish. The problem is that when you CLEARLY are a foreigner you get a lot dangerous attention. If you don't speak portuguese you will be fine in the airport, but nothing from that. Excludding Rio not even taxi's are used to english speakers. 5- Brazilians love foreigners and we love to test the little english that we have. 6- The best part of Brazil are the people. It's just so easy to make friends here comparing to the rest of the world. Really. People want to connect. One time i've got lost in the NY subway and was a hell to someone to help me, here in Brazil everytime i ask for direction in a bus station a lot of different people offer different routes and that's that. The worst part is also the people. Here in brazil we are always trying to take advantage in the situation and the true is that if you don't you kinda just get left behind. And some things are just to expansive. Advice: Never resist if you are being mugged. Travel a lot! From recife you have really beautiful beaches nearby and they arent really expenseive if you stay in OK places."
Brazil,3e3gd4,akamustacherides,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:28:36 2015 UTC,"I dated a Brazilian finishing her second post doc in the States and ended up marrying her, now I live in Brazil! These are my personal experiences and opinions.   Culture Shock: Sanitation. Horses and ATVs in the street, even in a city as big as Niteroi. Breakfast, nothing like an American. Traffic/Driving, red lights in some places are just a recommendation and motorcycles are everywhere. Their love for french fries, desserts, and chocolate.   Danger: I don't know anything about Recife, but I have been to enough big cities all over the world to know some basic rules of safety. No flashy jewelry, phones and cameras stay put away unless being used, and wallet or cash in front pocket. When you are walking, walk with purpose. I haven't run into anyone that has tried taking advantage of me for being an American and I stand out. Think big boy (rugby prop) with red beard and very white skin. Today, a friend of a friend pulled R$7,000 out of the bank to pay bills, walked out of the bank and was promptly robbed. Be careful when using the ATM, the bank, or currency exchange; some times the person that helped you will call a friend to rob you.  Language: I don't speak any other language besides English, not for the lack of trying, I just can't get foreign languages to stick. I have Google Translator on my phone and use it when in a bind. My day to day activities don't include working yet so I have enough Portuguese to get my morning coffee or afternoon beer at the local cafe. Since I don't know Spanish I don't know if it will help.  Advice: Have fun! There are so many things that are completely different and amazing. The people are wonderful and beautiful. If you play sports I recommend going out one day and playing a pick up game of soccer, I play rugby and have joined the local team. Oh yes, when you come bring gifts. I recommend going to TJ Maxx or another store similar and stocking up on things that scream America. Get the guys t-shirts of US sports teams or things to use when BBQing (men love to BBQ down here), get the women handbags/jewelry or kitchen items, find out from your girlfriend what her family likes or something they can't get here.  I hope these thought help."
Brazil,3e3gd4,ninguem,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:27:11 2015 UTC,"biggest culture shock for an American visiting Brazil   Your girlfriend probably lives with her parents, siblings, perhaps a grandparent or two, maybe a live-in-maid, a dog and a parrot.

Brazil,3e3gd4,rosadeour,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:33:56 2015 UTC,"I am pretty easy going person, I don't stress much, I am not really ever in a hurry, and I am not afraid to try new things. I can adapt to change fairly quickly, have a pretty open mind, and I am highly interested in different cultures and ways of life.    Great. You will fit in perfectly, especially if you decide to live here. Brazilians culture is all about extremely long queues and waiting for many hours to resolve issues, which often stretch into days or even weeks.   Your chilled-out nature will serve you well.    How hard is it to learn the language? I have taken Spanish all my life and can read it decently.    Hard enough. Spanish will be super helpful for learning the numbers, conjugating verbs and general grammatical structure. And of course, hundreds (thousands?) of words are the same.   Would I be completely lost in the country since I can't speak Portuguese (I plan on trying to learn before I go) or would I be able to get by?    Probably quite lost, yes. Lots of people come to Brazil saying that they'll be fine because they're basically fluent in Spanish but they quickly discover they can't understand much at all.   Would I be looked at negatively for being a foreigner?    95% of the time - No. But what others are saying here, that ""Brazilians love foreigners"" is not entirely true. Most do, sure, but there are also plenty who don't seem to like Americans and some that perhaps don't like 'rich white foreigners'. I am white, so in Brazil the first impression people have of me is that I'm either American or German. So I get called ""American"" a lot, even though I'm not. I've been randomly verbally abused a few times and told to ""go back to America"", ""I'm going to fucking kill you, fucking American"" etc., but only ever when I've been with a girl. Also been called a ""viado"" (faggot) and other names. I think it's a jealousy thing, since I've never had any issues when I've been out alone. My perception is that some Brazilian guys don't like seeing you with a local girl. Usually though, they encourage you to enjoy as many girls as possible.  I also lived in a bad area for about 6 months cause I was dating a girl from a really poor family and ended up living with them. When I say poor, I don't mean like favela poor, but close enough. No washing machine (everything hand washed), barely any food in the fridge, no internet connection, never enough money to pay bills, etc. This could have something to do with the way I was treated at times.  You probably won't experience any of what I'm talking about on a short trip but honestly, it happens. Not everyone will view you in a positive way, all the time.    What are some of the best and worst parts about Brazil?    Best: Freedom to do whatever you want, incredible food, incredible parties, wonderful social culture, close family life with good values, people treat friends very well, very good hosts to foreigners, proud of Brazil despite it being a little messed up  Worst: Extremely long lines, large crowds, dysfunctional systems, poor telecommunications, shit internet, bad roads, a general lack of safety and security, living behind electrified wires, being afraid to walk around at night, expensive electronics, expensive cars, expensive imported everything, always a worry in the back of your mind that you might get mugged or have something stolen every time you go out, people up in your face asking for money   Finally, any words of advice for me?    Cooperate fully if you get mugged. Be calm and polite, but be fast handing your things over. I wouldn't be here today otherwise :P  Don't take anything out with you that you're not prepared to lose. Also, watch out for things going missing when you're at a bar, while you're the bus etc.   I was at a somewhat 'classy', expensive bar a couple of weeks ago (like R$20 entry, R$15 beers - Eisenbahn and all that stuff) and someone stole my jacket from the back of my seat. I couldn't believe it. You always feel relaxed in places like that, especially when you've paid to get in. The reaction from my friends was like ""Oh hahaha. Well, what do you expect? You're a gringo and that jacket is probably like R$600 to buy here"" ... Argh .. That attitude pisses me off sometimes!  Sorry for the long post (got a bit carried away), but thought I'd share my reality, as a white foreigner who's lived here for almost two years.   Enjoy!"

Brazil,3dzdkf,nakakasawa,3,Mon Jul 20 19:36:35 2015 UTC,"lol ... This post gave me a good laugh. Thank you.   I guess you don't know much about Brazil. Let me tell you that all utilities companies are shit and all of their staff are liars. They illegally add products to your contract after you sign the form so that they earn more 'points', to render higher monthly incomes. A friend who worked at NET in S√£o Paulo confirmed this is common practice. It has happened to me with both telecoms companies I have been unfortunate enough to have contracts with so far; GVT and NET. You'll sign up for a cable connection, get it sorted and a technician will be calling a few days later to install a phone line and TV service you never fucking agreed to in the first place.  Avoid contracts at all cost. They will royally screw you over and fuck you as hard as they can to the point where you almost lose your mind dealing with their bullshit. Getting out of the crap they illegally bill you for involves sending numerous complaints to Anatel and even then they will continue to insist that you most definitely want their extra services.   TIM is fucking shit too, despite the fact it's the best in Brazil. I have TIM prepay and it took about 3 weeks to get it properly unlocked due to 'inconsistencies' with my address. In other words, despite spending 2 hours at the store with some girl who didn't give a shit about anything besides trying to sell me a R$40 per month contract, my phone was blocked from sending and receiving calls about a week after I activated it and it was quite a pain to unblock it; the girl never bothered to properly enter in my details.  And guess what R$40 per month buys you? Unlimited WhatsApp use and 300 mb of data per month! And you probably get 2 phone calls and 10 standard SMS messages per month as well, but only while within the same state as you purchased your phone number in! Whoopdee fucking shit! There's a reason why no one actually uses the normal system here; if you don't have WhatsApp, you aint' gonna hear from your friends. Ever.  Apart from that, I think it's about R$1.50 per day for 30 megabytes  on prepay, which will run out in about 5 minutes if you happen to need to check your Facebook wall.   On top of this, TIM will bombard you with annoying messages trying to sell you other products and telling you top up your phone, although it's not anywhere near as bad as Oi, which was my last mobile provider.   Brazilian comms companies are HORRIBLE to deal with and have almost driven me to the point of either wanting to check into an insane asylum or blow up their head offices.   I wish you the very best of luck, my friend."
Brazil,3dzdkf,congruous_nz,0,Tue Jul 21 03:08:09 2015 UTC,"TIM is fucking shit too, despite the fact it's the best in Brazil.   lolwut  I use Claro and it's pretty good. Why do you subject yourself to their service? You must be a masochist"
Brazil,3dzdkf,cbraga,3,Tue Jul 21 14:09:08 2015 UTC,"VIVO has the best cover in SP for the 4G, but it's expensive. You don't need to pay a termination fee except if you signed for it, for example they may offer you a new phone with a nice discount, but only if you get their plan for 1 year, if you want to cancel it before 1 year, you may pay a fee.  A cheaper carrier is TIM, it have some nice cheap plans with ""unlimited"" broadband, i say ""unlimited"" because once you reach max data, let's say you get a 200MB plan, when you reach the 200MB, the speed will fall drastically. Also, it's cheaper but with less coverage, and their service is more unstable.  Those are the both carriers i experienced personally. So if you want just text and use Google Maps, i would go with TIM. But if you can spend more for a little more quality service, VIVO. Both have ""unlimited"" broadband, but as i said, once you reach the max it will get really slow."

Brazil,3dzdkf,fviz,3,Tue Jul 21 03:07:03 2015 UTC,"Don't get a plan, you'll be screwed forever.   You'll spend a week trying to cancel it in several stores probably.  Like 3-4 hours per day, for a week.    Lots of prepaid options, nothing that I know of that is unlimited.  The standard prepaid is 300mb per month, 10mb per day.  Tim and some of the other companies now cut you off once you reach that limit, and no longer just slow you down.  Expect limits to be fractional to what you're used to, and get used to being pretty frugal with your bandwidth.  I don't personally know how much bandwidth you can get on a prepaid plan, but in general it's pretty limited.   And whatever they tell you, it's divided into 30 days, so it's a ""theoretical maximum"".  Each city/state seems to have it's preferred carrier, someone mentioned SP it's vivo, so I'd look into what they have to offer.  Others might have ""better"" plans, but it's most likely because they never expanded their services in that city quick enough and now they'll offer whatever, but have no way to deliver it."

Brazil,3dopar,___D,16,Sat Jul 18 00:29:27 2015 UTC,"Thought nobody was going to ask! I was heading to a big fiasco... THANK YOU  Here we go.  Get all words in English that end in -tion and substitute by -cao. I cant write the proper characters here because my OS/keyboard is not prepared for international ""dead keys"". But this ""c"" is a cedilla (sounds like ""s"") and ""ao"" has a tilde on top of the ""a"".  So ""cao"" sounds approximately like... ""sound"".   Examples:   constitui-cao = constitu-tion evolu-cao = evolu-tion procrastina-cao = procrastina-tion rela-cao = rela-tion   ALL such words are of latin origin, more exactly from the accusative case.   As you might know, English is the ONLY non-romance language that is cognate to Latin. This is because (if I remember well from high school) during the time that French was the official language of the monarchy in Britain, English was left as the language of the plebe and as such was dilapidated.   When the English took power again, they needed to rebuild the language to be used officially again and had to resort to Latin as a huge borrow source.  I'd appreciate if someone has more details on this. If I remember well, Wheelock textbook discusses this in its first chapters.  There are about 10,000 of these words in English and they invariably have exactly the same meaning.   There you go. You just learned 10,000 words in Portuguese."

The Vikings are one of the major teams in the NFL and they generate billions in revenue. It's a wrecking money printing machine.  In the case of the WC 2014 stadium in question, it was a throwaway. Ten games max of spotlight and that's it.  All of the local teams that will play at this Mane Garrincha stadium are in the 2nd division. And even then, the best of all teams, Brasilia Futebol Clube's last title on the 2nd division was back in 2001.  And that was its only title. The rest were all district-level tournament wins.  All in all, the average public in a futbol game in Brazil just does not support any back-of-napkin calculation to construct such stadiums by a mile. It's nonsense.  Add to that the costs of ~ $200k/US per month with maintanence alone and basically NO revenue other than the eventual country music show and you get the picture.

Off-duty cops: we actually have two police forces, one civilian, one military. Yes; military cops. Like, soldiers being cops. They're evidently much more trigger-happy than your average cop, due to their military training, and that's how you get those Liveleak videos.

To see if a country is secure or not, you can't look at that. First: How would you find out about other things? Second, Brazil is very huge. We have a lot of people here. Even if the crime rate is very low in %, the numbers can be big. And you would have enough fuel to post on liveleak and make people think it is more common than what actually is.  The crime rate in Brazil is high, I can't deny that. But you can only know for sure when you look at statistics, read papers, compare it with other countries.  I feared men with just one source...

Brazil,3dmhzj,congruous_nz,4,Fri Jul 17 16:35:47 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, transport is the most dangerous part of living in Brazil, especially if you ride a motorcycle. Crossing the road is also quite dangerous, especially at intersections and on multi-lane roads.  I'm not sure how many motorcycle accidents I've seen, but it would be more than 10, although fortunately no one was badly hurt in the ones I saw because they were all in the city center. On the highways I have seen some brutal car accidents and accidents involving buses and trucks, that looked to be sure to have killed some occupants.   I'll never forget about that bus crash last year that killed over 50 people. Transport freaks me out here.   But I'm saying this as the opinion of someone who lives in a relatively safe area of a somewhat 'safe' city."
Brazil,3dmhzj,Shoegoo22,2,Sun Jul 19 17:28:59 2015 UTC,Brazil is awesome. You should just go.
Brazil,3dmhzj,pkennedy,2,Fri Jul 17 18:43:42 2015 UTC,"I live in the northeast, and it's definitely gotten a lot worse here.   There are by far more muggings here than in the US.  Most crime in the US is done without the other party being involved.  Pick pocketing, perhaps a snatch and grab of a purse, car broken into, or a house broken into.   Muggings are far less common in the US.   Crime is far more personal here for sure!  I have heard of way too many stories from people of being robbed, while in the US I might know of like 5 people tops that had been robbed, and I can't think of any being mugged.      The big problem are motorcycles, we had a guest who was here, and a bike drove past them, turned around and pulled a gun on them.  Complete opportunity, they had just turned onto that street, the guy was just there, 10 seconds longer and he would have been on another block.  They aren't sitting there waiting, they're just taking opportunities as they see them, which makes it more difficult to dodge.  You might think it's completely safe on some street, and a bike happens to turn onto it and it just got dangerous.  The other thing I almost always hear in these stories are just general safety rules, people using smart phones on the street.  In the US this is 100% normal, a used iphone is what $300?  At $8/hour minimum wage, that's hardly worth going to jail for, especially not if you're using a gun to get it.   Here though, that $600 new iphone is going for $1200 due to taxes and imports, and then you've got a much lower minimum wage, probably in the $2/hour range, NOW you have something worth going to jail for, 600 hours of labour versus less than week in the US.  Especially when they aren't everywhere, so prices for used goods remains high.    People forget where they are and do stupid things like that.    Act accordingly, and you'll be pretty safe.  Don't try and bargain with the thieves, just hand it over.  There is a lot of crack here, which is a drug that burns fast through a person, and if they're look for another hit, or to pay someone back $5 to avoid being killed, that means your life is essentially worth less than that to them.     Now driving, that is something seriously dangerous and far more likely to get you killed here.  With the quality of safety gear in these cars and the complete lack of driving skills, these roads are completely unsafe, some of the highest death rates in the world."

Our major cities are Detroit-level violent, basically, if not slightly worst. Nothing to be proud of and certainly you shouldn't just go around the streets at night with a gold watch and expensive camera hanging from your neck, but it's not like there's a civil war going on. It also varies wildly by region given the size of the country."
Brazil,3dmhzj,thedreday,3,Fri Jul 17 14:59:45 2015 UTC,"I think that only rich kids living in the ""domed neighborhoods"" of the wealth are answering you in this thread.  Yes, Brazil is horribly violent through the vast majority of the country - that is, the poor neighborhoods, and even middle class neighborhoods (like mine) that happen that be at the side of a poor slum (a favela as we call it).  When I leave my home in the morning I don't know if I will arrive and find my doors intact and all my belongings in there; my house has been robbed four times just this year. Almost every week I hear shootings coming from the favela (it was worst last year, when there was a gang war). I have seen guys running from other, armed ones in the streets just a few blocks from my home. I have seen a guy being shot in cold blood at the door of a bank half a mile away. Often police helicopters are flying over my neighborhood.  So yes, it is a living hell, and the only reason that I have not left this shithole of country yet is because I am locked in here due to family matters."
Brazil,3dmhzj,dromni,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:52:34 2015 UTC,"You should move. Not necessarily a different country, a different city would do. Maybe even a different neighborhood. Jeez man.   Now, you should also put things in perspective. Instead of saying Brazil is horribly violent, you should say your city (maybe your neighborhood) is horribly violent."
Brazil,3dmhzj,thedreday,2,Fri Jul 17 18:51:31 2015 UTC,"My mom lives in a far less violent neighborhood than mine and even though she never leaves home after dusk. So the ""good"" neighborhoods here are actually still horribly violent. Only if I lived in a condo with armed security and 24/7 monitoring I would feel really safe, and even though that would be just inside that ""prison"".  No sir, I want to live in a place where I can walk miles and miles in any direction without the fear of being robbed or shot - like for instance when I visit the US. And I am not alone: over the years I've lost count of friends who have moved out of Brasil - usually to the US, Canada and Australia - and security is always among the top reasons for leaving this dystopia. Every time that I tell that my house was robbed again or that I heard shots again they say ""dude, leave this lost cause of a country, here I don't even lock my door"".  You can stay here and play Russian roullete. For me, even if the problems of this godforsaken land were miraculously solved tomorrow, I already loathe this country.  An before you use again this tired argument of ""it's not the whole of Brazil, it's just your neighborbood"", please take a look at this map. Chances are that you are the one living in an island of peace in the middle of hell, and mistakes that for the usual situation over the rest of the country."

If you say rich patches like Leblon, Copa, Flamengo are safe you're out of your mind. Even Barra da Tijuca that used to be safe because of the sheer distance to the city, it's thief's shooting range these days.  In the 90s I used to walk around everywhere, no problem. The situation just horribly imploded in the past 20 years.  And I blame this communist government for that (Lula/Dilma)."

I was horrified to learn that officers would be careful to give orders to conscripts, afraid of being disembowed going home.   I've been robbed pretty much everywhere in Rio in the 6 years I lived there - Leblon, Copa, Flamengo, a couple of times in buses to Tijuca, Largo do Machado, by the Federal University.  This might have to do with my physical complexion though.  The only places I actually felt safe was in the favelas because the drug lord would reign there with an iron fist (so not to disrupt their ""business"").   Just tell me one patch of land in Rio (the city not the state) that's safe and I'll give you a hug."
Brazil,3dmhzj,fritzroid,3,Fri Jul 17 19:53:51 2015 UTC,"Actually, the crime rate rised horribly in the 90's and reached a historic high-level in the early 2000's, and is now decreasing. It's not decreasing faster because it is still rising in the North/Northeast.

Still, if you go with the trends it's likely that the violence will keep decreasing country-wide. The country is developing, slowly but surely.  About the headlines, as I said: one event that goes wild on TV is not representative of all events country-wide. It has the effect of making people pay attention, that's all.  Finally, about you noticing my quotes: sorry, but I cannot see this government as communist. They are state capitalists, FWIW. What I see in Latin America is the governments trying to become relevant in an international scheme without help of the US or Europe. But, with Brazil's government being the less incompetent of these countries, they are failing.  About communism: LOL. I know those documents, but PT is well aware that they wouldn't survive in the government with communist ideas. PSOL was created by ex-PT members that went out because PT wasn't socialist enough, just to give you an example."

I even find it odd when I'm watching True Detective and some of the characters have some clear shot on some suspect and just yell them to stop. Let me tell you, if True Detective were in Brazil, it'd be a whole lotta shorter.   All of this violence is much more common among poor people, and like the northeast has lots of poor people then It's more common there. Problem is, all of this crap it seems like it'll never end. They kill a police officer. The police go in the shadow of the night and kill five criminals as revenge. Then the criminals kill more police officers as a revenge. Criminal Ouroboros.  Back in '06 or '07, can't remember exactly. Those 'acts' of revenge reached a peak because of PCC (Primeiro Comando da Capital[Capital's First Command]) a criminal organization that declared war on the police. They killed lots of police in ambushes while they were off-duty, burned buses and all of that crap. And the police fought back. No one was at the streets. No one. It felt like a ghost town, a ghost town cursed by fear. It felt pretty bad.  I trust our police officers. There are fucked up people everywhere - including in the police force. And those deserve the same treatment they treat other people. Eye for an eye I guess? But I think this thought is exactly the reason of all this happening. The perfect storm. And there are lots of brazilians who think like this (even myself, I confess). Should we all change our collective way of thinking? We should. Easier said than done, though.  There are fights about this everywhere, we brazilians love to fight on the internet, especially in this subject. Right wingers that say 'fuck human rights' and left wingers who say 'demilitarize the military police' everywhere."

Brazil,3d8kle,fritzroid,4,Sat Jul 18 21:30:29 2015 UTC,"I would honestly recommend you trying to talk with the brazilian embassy in your country. This kind of information might be conflicting on the internet, like you said.  only one year's residence is required for those who have a Brazilian spouse, parent, or child. So as far as I know, your mother would have to live in Brazil for at least a year to get her citizenship and it is unclear if that would serve for you too.  Your case is a specific case, so as I said, I recommend you trying to get in touch with the brazilian embassy."

I'd think that, for you to be able to request it, you'd need your mother to do it first, and that would only be possible if she moved to Brazil."
Brazil,3d8kle,abrasiliandad,2,Tue Jul 14 15:41:56 2015 UTC,"desde que sejam registrados em reparti√ß√£o brasileira competente   I think this could be done at the consulate, no need to reside in Brazil."

Brazil,3d8kle,celestino3,3,Tue Jul 14 16:27:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, and since his mother is certainly over 18, she would need to move to Brazil, not to mention himself, who probably is also over 18."

Brazil,3da676,nouvellefiasco,3,Tue Jul 14 18:20:04 2015 UTC,"Generally, try to blend in. No flashy clothes at all.  Common sense things.  Leave your passport at the hotel. Carry around a photocopy of it.  Leave your debit card at hotel too. Carry around maybe 200 reais. Put 100 in your wallet.  The rest in your sock or something.   Also, make your appointment already for the visa!   Another important piece of advice. Figure out how you are going to get home before NYE. That means, buy a round trip ticket on the Subway the day before, to avoid the gigantic lines at the ticket booth.  They are huge at about 3pm on NYE.  The subway I think runs maybe till 1 or 2am after the Fireworks.  If you plan on staying out, be prepared to be out for the long haul, especially if you are staying in Botafogo, Flamengo, or Catete.  Cabs basically run off the meter then and they'll charge you like 100 reais to go home.  Fuck that.  I ended up basically walking home at about 4am. Went to bed at like 6. Also, do you know where you're staying?   Other tips.   Bring a cooler for the beach for NYE. Like those soft coolers that you can squish and stuff into your luggage.  It will be very annoying to buy beer once on the beach bc of the crowds.  Also, everyone will be peeing on the palm trees.   Find a nice all white linen outfit or something to wear on NYE. White is Yemanj√°'s color. She's the main Yoruba goddess, as well as of the ocean.  Also, as an African-American, it might interest you to learn a bit about the various Afro Brazilian religions since it's something mostly unique to the Catholic colonies.   Also, samba will be popping. I think Lapa is a bit past its prime, but you can find great samba, depending on the day of the week, at Pedra do Sal, Ouvidor, and Trabalhador ."

As the race issue, you'll have very little problem blending in with the country's population since it's pretty diverse. You must remember though, that for reasons strikingly similar to the US, there's still a social-economical disparity between classes and the colors of that separation are only slightly more blurry than in America.

I don't think your race will be an issue here, you'll be seen as a tourist above all. However you should realize that much like the USA we have race and prejudice issues all across the board.

Brazil,3d78n5,thedonch,6,Tue Jul 14 01:47:41 2015 UTC,"here are some pointers I made in another post -So, let me try and help you as a local. Besides Copacabana go visit Ipanema and Leblon beaches, if you want more deserted ones, you can go to Prainha or Grumari, but they are a little hard to get with no car. Nature is all around the city, Vista Chinesa, Cachoeira dos Primatas are famous places you can go alone, and there are a lot of guided nature tours. The Botanic Garden and Parque Lage are a must go and are close to each other and very safe. You should definitely go to Santa Tereza (Bar do Mineiro and ask for pasteis de feij√£o and a cold beer, just walk around) and Urca (Bar da Urca for a caipirinha de Lima da P√©rsia, just walk around too). There is a local fair with food, art and Chorinho a very traditional music, on Saturday it's at Rua General Glic√©rio, and on Sunday at Pra√ßa S√£o Salvador, both around noon. In Rio people like to stand around outside in some places drinking and talking to each other at night (from 9pm foward) here are some of them. Pra√ßa S√£o Salvador -every day, Pra√ßa Santos Dumont and Bar da Urca- Thursday till Saturday, Comuna in Botafogo - every day if you're a hipster ;). Lapa can be a little chaotic, you should visit (at night tho), but try to avoid the weekends (Thursday is a good day). Go to Cinel√¢ndia by subway, daytime) , you can visit the Confeitaria Colombo, National Library, the Real Gabinete Portugu√™s de Leitura, Museu Nacional de Belas Artes, CCBB, Museu Hist√≥rico Nacional, Museu de Arte do Rio, all near that region. So, any questions just ask. Cheers."

There's the risk of getting mugged, robbed at gunpoint, kidnapped and whatnot, but if you use common sense, don't flash expensive items or blatantly expose your Canadianness you'll be fine.  Do what people here recommended: eat (bar food), drink (Caipirinhas), flirt (being a gringo is a great advantage in one-night stands), go to the beach, sunbathe etc. Brazil is such a good place for tourists that sometimes I wish I were one.

Carnaval is in February, but rehearsals happen all year long, and October/November is when things are starting to get a bit ""hotter"" towards the parades.  I happen to play in a few Blocos, and have taken a few foreigners to our rehearsals. Including two American redditors and a few Canadian friends. They all absolutely LOVED it. There's something about the sound of dozens of people banging on loud drums that's just very powerful.  Even if you don't like it, it's a very ""Carioca"", very Brazilian, thing. So I highly recommend you try it out.  Feel free to PM me closer to your arrival and I can recommend some good and safe places to go, and if you choose to watch one of the ones I play in, I'll be happy to take you there. :)  Cheers, hope you have a good time!

Touristy things I like to do in Rio: go to the botanical garden and the Sugar Loaf. Visit the fort in Copacabana. I don't care very much for the Christ the Redeemer statue, but it's pretty mandatory for international tourists.  Edit: if you enjoy people watching, find yourself a good boteco (type of bar), and just sit and chat for a few hours sipping on a caipirinha and eating some unhealthy but obviously delicious bar food. There are a ton of those around."

Brazil,3d78n5,danigr,3,Tue Jul 14 03:31:08 2015 UTC,"I just like the view there better, plus you get to go to Urca - I like the neighbourhood."
Brazil,3d78n5,Montgomery-Cavendish,2,Tue Jul 14 03:41:33 2015 UTC,"Hello fellow Canadian!  What part of Canada are you from,  if you don't mind me asking? Have you gotten your visas sorted out yet?  They are very particular about the paperwork and how everything is done,  the waiting can be a pain too.  Where in Rio are you planning on staying?  If you're doing a hostel,  there are a couple good ones in botafogo.  I stayed in a favela hostel near the top end of Copacabana.  It was very safe,  and would be worth checking out for a few days for the view,  a fantastic nearby restaurant and the experience,  but the stairs up to the place are almost cruel.  Anything you want to buy at a place like Copacabana beach is half the price two streets in,  but that neighbourhood gets sketchy after dark,  the police are always near the beach after dark.    Christ the Redeemer.   Take the tram,  it's a little more money but the view is better.   You can walk up,  which if you like to hike is great,  but you still have to pay a bus or tram fare to get in as it doubles as your admission fee.  There are souvenir shops all over the place,  the closer to the statue the more expensive things are,  but they are also better workmanship.  Go before the heat of the day to get clearer pictures from the top, otherwise it seems to get humid and hazy.     For Sugarloaf, I'd say go near the end of the day, some of the pictures I've seen taken there around sunset/after dark made me very very jealous.   Urca beach is a great place for sunset watching, at the southernmost point of Copacabana there's a thing where people go watch the sunset and applaude.    For food, there are hole in the wall restaurants everywhere, and though the greyish beef may look suspect, you'll be fine (probably).  It's odd that they serve rice, pasta, fries and farofa (toasted cassava flour) with one meal, but it's also awesome in it's own kinda way.   There are also pay by the kilo restaurants virtually everywhere, and these places are awesome as you can load your plate up and eat well for pretty cheaply, don't be afraid to take a look before you decide to grab a plate, if a smaller place is looking cleaned out near the end of their lunch rush, don't feel bad about going somewhere else.    You MUST have Acai, you will love it.  If I had the money I'd jump through all the hoops to import frozen Acai puree to Canada and kick the hell out of those Marble Slab type ice cream shops with a delicious healthy treat.   You also must visit a tapioca cart.  They make a crepe out of tapioca flour, and you can have all kinds of things in it, Chicken and cheese is the best, but the dessert ones like banana and cinnamon are really good.    All the food is good, you will eat well and there's no real need to hit a burger joint or anything like that.  They do coffee a little stronger down there, it's not bad, but it's not going to blow your mind.   If you've got money to burn, there are a couple paragliding outfits in Rio, and it would be a pretty incredible thing to do.   Once you know where you're staying, try and pin down bus routes to get common places.  I had a hard time finding reasonable transit maps or schedules and accidentally went on a random hour and a half bus ride because I wasn't paying attention.   Finally, be prepared to be very very tired when you come home.  There's no point sleeping in Rio, there's always something to do at night and something to see during the day.  Be a little bit wary, and have fun!"

Typically, you cannot change the type of visa you have once you are in Brazil. This must be done back in your home country.   Note that most volunteers here in Brazil do not have volunteer visas. Volunteer organizations are fine with people on tourist visas and some don't even know that workers are supposed to have VITEM I visas. Same with various jobs. Fact.  Source of my info: 3 x past tourist visas, 1 x 3 yr work permit, US partner with current 1 x tourist visa, 1 x VITEM I (volunteer visa).  Your best approach is to phone the embassy directly and explain your situation. Both of our long-term visas were issued (different days) within a matter of hours because we told them it was urgent.   Again, don't travel with a tourist visa that'll expire on the 23rd. The embassy needs your passport to issue your volunteer visa anyway; it's not electronic.  All the best. Let us know how you go!"

Toronto police got a call about a group of cyclists travelling northbound on the shoulder of the DVP at 9:58 a.m. Sunday, Det. Sgt. Devin Kealey said. A police motorcycle unit already on the highway keeping an eye on the HOV lanes responded to the call and caught up to the nine cyclists who were all wearing their Brazilian team uniforms.  The team was on a practice ride downtown when they rode on to the DVP at the Eastern Ave. ramp, not realizing that cyclists are not normally allowed on to the busy highway.  There were ""some language issues,"" Kealey said, but the cyclists were ""very apologetic and very co-operative"" with officers, who escorted them out to the Don Mills Rd. exit and took them to the Bayview Extension so they could continue their practice.  The cyclists are not facing any charges and Kealey said Pan Am officials have also contacted the team about cycling rules in Toronto.  Kealey said it's not unheard of for cyclists to accidentally end up on the DVP, but it's not a common occurrence either.  ""You'll be happy to know they were not using the HOV lanes,"" he added.

Vivendo do √ìcio is a great indie rock band from Bahia, you should listen to ""Radioatividade"" and ""Dois Mundos"". Some more traditional stuff I like is Legi√£o Urbana (which is mandatory, 'cause it's probably the most popular band in Brazil) and Adriana Calcanhoto =D  Something unique about Brazilian culture is that poor people and rich people and everyone else often share the same public spaces (not always though, there's a lot of discrimination still going on here).

That being said, knowing how sertanejo is mainstreamingly (is that even a word?) famous, literally millions of people mourned his death. But as I said, Brazil is very popuous, so there were also millions (like myself) of people who had absolutely no idea who he was or what he has created or even if what he created was remotely good (that's very relative, imo).  Adding to the fact that he died while overspeeding on the road, this only added more friction into this whole mess. Very soon after his death, we brazilians were already fighting all over the internet (brazilians love internet conflicts) over the coverage this guy was getting.

In practice, people don't really understand that subtle difference and think that if it's not being printed anymore, it isn't valid, so they don't accept it as payment.

Brazil,3cdb1c,doodledee123,11,Tue Jul 7 00:46:50 2015 UTC,"I live in Rio, and grew up in an apartment in a nice neighborhood, but I could see a favela from the window. In the 90s an early 2000, you could hear almost daily, shots coming from there and wouldn't even think of going up there. In the last 8 years or so, with the ""pacification"" politics of police units establishing themselves inside the favela, things got much better, for both sides, despite the criticism. After that, several foreigners and locals started to rent houses in there and build hostels and restaurants in favelas that are in prime touristic locations. Today I often go to parties in some of those favelas that have amazing views, like this monthly jazz for example. Of course, those are a minority of the favelas, hopefully it will happen to all of them."
Brazil,3cdb1c,fazoids,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:11:01 2015 UTC,O√≠.  Is pacification happening only in Rio?
Brazil,3cdb1c,Pokololo,7,Tue Jul 7 06:01:06 2015 UTC,"No that I know of, but it is considered an example. Unlike what the other guy told you, most favelas need to be pacified and lack state presence. There is this myth among Brazilians that Rio is an exception, although all statistics say otherwise, and in terms of violence, Rio is quite low compared to other capitals check the chart. But to be fair, what happens in Rio has tons more of national and international visibility, so you can't blame people for having this false impressions. S√£o Paulo is an even more successful case of violence decrease, but they still have the largest organized crime called PCC, which keep things ""peaceful"" when everything is running smoothly for them."
Brazil,3cdb1c,fazoids,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:40:12 2015 UTC,Why such high crime for the top two places?
Brazil,3cdb1c,Pokololo,-1,Wed Jul 8 00:25:54 2015 UTC,"The favelas largely controlled by drug gangs are mostly in Rio. Other favelas might have problems with drugs and organized crime, but they haven't scaled up to bazookas and guerrilla warfare, so they don't need to be ""pacified""."
Brazil,3cdb1c,evilbr,12,Tue Jul 7 07:09:48 2015 UTC,"Well, not every place in Brazil has favelas close to high rises. It is quite common for rich people to live in suburbs and closed condominiums that look like fortresses. And some cities (unlike Rio, where the favelas are really everywhere) have it's favelas on the outskirts. S√£o Paulo is a good example: altough one of the most striking examples of skyscrapers next to favelas is here, in the Morumbi neighborhood, (see this: http://www.scielo.br/img/revistas/ccrh/v23n59/05f01.jpg), most of the upper-middle class neighborhoods are far from favelas. About traveling to and from favelas: I don't think it is that common to people to go to favelas, but people from them go everywhere: they work all over the city and some do very long journeys to get to work (think 2-3 hours). But about coping with it, the main answer is: the inhabitants of the skyscrapers ""bunker"" themselves. They buildings are fortresses: Armed bodyguards who check the vehicle (they make you open the trunk every time you go in there, to check if there is no one hidding there),cameras, high walls with barbed wired and electric fences on top, their cars are armoured... you know, pretty much what you would expect in a US army base in Iraq."
Brazil,3cdb1c,evilbr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:34:36 2015 UTC,"Wow, I didn't realize favelas were everywhere. I thought they were only in Rio lol, my bad.  So it's basically like the Projects in new york city, but much worse."
Brazil,3cdb1c,pkennedy,10,Tue Jul 7 01:37:04 2015 UTC,"Well, to be honest, they go from just poor neighbourhoods with people trying to live their lives, and some level of public services (mail, cable internet/tv, paved streets) to... well, think Black Hawk Down's Mogadishu... But pretty much every large city in Brazil has some kind of favela. And most of them are far from the wealthy neighborhoods. Rio is the exception: as a coastal city, there isn't much space to build, and since the city is somewhat old (for brazilian standards), when Rio got a big populational boom in the XX century, pretty much all the good real state was already taken, so the immigrants who came from the countryside and Rios poor citizens, drove from the city by gentrification took the hills and built their homes there. And so, most of the favelas came to be close the wealthy neighbourhoods."
Brazil,3cdb1c,Jay_Bonk,9,Tue Jul 7 01:56:41 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people believe these places are just dirt and mud huts.  I know one girl who used to say she was well aware of poverty having been born in Brazil, I told her, no, those shanty towns aren't bad at all, when you visit other places in the world, you'll see poverty.  She went on a mission to africa and came back and said it was a whole new level of poverty.  These favelas often aren't that bad, they have brick houses they have power, they have water.   I can only image how sewer is handled, as I've learned how sewer is handled in these big gated communities in Natal, and well, it's not septic tanks with fields, it's septic tanks with open bottoms... So I imagine the favelas are similar with that.    Overall, these are poorly constructed homes, but they're homes.  They're built of bricks, they have a roof, they have windows/doors.  They are buildings, just no building codes were ever used..."
Brazil,3cdb1c,pkennedy,5,Tue Jul 7 04:22:48 2015 UTC,"I am not from Brazil I actually am from Medell√≠n, Colombia and we have similar things there called comunas. The thing is you go inside one and there might be a PS3 and a flat screen, or the people in the house have smartphones. They are poor, but not Africa poor."
Brazil,3cdb1c,blotbup34,2,Tue Jul 7 18:13:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly, many have nice houses, some are obviously really poor, but it's not the same kind of poor by a long shot.   These slums are crappy neighbourhoods, they aren't tent cities with people dying of starvation on the streets.  It's like comparing a ghetto with a nicer part of town.  They look like crap because the way they are ""finished"" or perhaps unfinished, but a lot of homes end up in this fashion.    All neighborhoods, rich and poor seem to have this affliction of people who start a project and leave it (roof almost done) or a wall that gets put up, and since the other side of the wall is on the neighbours side, they don't finish it.  It's really a ""not my concern"" attitude, or ""not my problem"", and I think it comes from the lack of quality control in the products used to build as well.  Things just start falling apart from day one.  Everything falls apart quickly, and there really isn't any way to keep up with it, so you just live with it.  tiles fall off, paint chips away, concrete cracks, water seeps through... it just looks old and ugly within a few years.  So in reality these ghetto areas are just extensions of poor building products in some sense.  There is no way they can keep up with maintaining them, and when one house looks like crap on your block, what is another house?  So they leave it."
Brazil,3cdb1c,ayferriesbelongtome,3,Tue Jul 7 21:48:39 2015 UTC,"They're definitely not housing projects; they exist because our cities lacked proper planning. Rio, S√£o Paulo and other cities kept growing, poor migrants couldn't find room in downtown ghettos - so they built their shanty towns in the outskirts, taking unclaimed or unoccupied land plots, lacking all basic utilities - dirt roads, no water treatment, electricity or gas. After decades these places just became part of those cities.  There are housing projects that are intended to move people away from favelas, but most of the time it's not practical for them - being poor, can't move to a smaller place, further away and start paying more taxes (hijacking utilities even cable TV is not uncommon)."
Brazil,3cdb1c,alleycatbiker,0,Tue Jul 7 03:47:42 2015 UTC,Favelas are not everywhere in Brazil. Used to be only in Rio but since the 80' and 90's SP also started to have a lot of favelas due to immigration from the northeast of Brazil.

Entering S√£o Paulo from the countryside or from airports you will pass along many favelasm, though.  It is really a question of social inequality. If you are not poor, you won't probably ""be aware"" of the existence of favelas. However, you can see poverty in other forms, even in the rich parts of S√£o Paulo or Rio: homeless people taking shelter in any place that offers a little protection from the weather; people who collect recyclabe garbage to sell; beggars, etc.  Also, a great part of the working force in this area called ""Centro Expandido"" comes everyday from favelas or more isolated and poorer neighbourhoods. They will take 2 or 3 hours a day in transit just to work and earn a minimum wage, what is really sad and says a lot about Brazilian social inequality, despite all the progress that was made in the last decade ( more than 20 million people rose to the lower middle class)."

I think your best bet is to have it shipped USPS. Have it clearly labeled as used and put a value on it of just over $100. They are not going to haggle over a value difference of something like that. You pay the $60 or so in taxes plus some $40 shipping.   I would do it that way to avoid the risk of having it valued much higher. This way at least you know in advance what you're gonna pay.  Edit: a word
Brazil,3c7hx4,holambro,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:05:35 2015 UTC,But is USPS trustworthy? i feel like the package could go missing and there's no tracking on USPS international.
Brazil,3c7hx4,holambro,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:17:44 2015 UTC,"There certainly tracking on USPS international, but it is not as detailed as from the private carriers It does show when the package arrived, if its in customs and when its ready for delivery. I've not had any problems receiving packages from abroad."
Brazil,3c7hx4,danikali4nia,0,Tue Jul 7 02:01:24 2015 UTC,Hey there. I've shipped a lot of expensive stuff to Brazil from the U.S. with USPS.  Only one box didn't make it...  holambro had good advice.
Brazil,3c7hx4,thedreday,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:58:06 2015 UTC,yeah but how much was it ? my whole thing is avoiding the insane tax
Brazil,3c7hx4,guriboysf,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:53:23 2015 UTC,"What did you forget? How big and expensive is it? Regular mail is the cheapest, but might take a few months. UPS/FedEx is more expensive but quicker. The tax thing is a hit or miss thing, as far as I understand. You can ship and declare it as personal item and it might just go through."
Brazil,3c7hx4,pkennedy,2,Sun Jul 5 17:09:55 2015 UTC,it's $300 u.s dollars and probably needs to be sent in a decent size box. I hear DHL is better than UPS/Fedex? I'll definitely not be sending it regular mail.
Brazil,3c7hx4,thedreday,2,Sun Jul 5 17:13:50 2015 UTC,Why can't you just say what it is?
Brazil,3c7hx4,Alelnh,2,Sun Jul 5 22:42:54 2015 UTC,"Instead of asking us how to get it here without paying taxes, I think you need to price out how much fedex/UPS is going to cost you, for a small sized box, you're probably looking at $100 via fedex or more.  A decent sized box is likely going to cost you a couple hundred via Fedex.   And there isa decent chance that it will take 3-5 weeks to get here, since it will have to go through customs, and this assumes it clears without you having to pay anything.   Don't forget, you'll pay taxes on the SHIPPING costs as well, so a $300 item that costs $300 to ship costs $600 to bring into the country, this is standard everywhere in the world to bill based on the cost of the shipped item."
Brazil,3c7hx4,thedreday,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:00:25 2015 UTC,"It's going to be expensive. Not sure which of the three is best, I've only used regular mail. Maybe see if anyone is going to Rio and would be willing to take it? It's going to be tough since the limit you can bring in the country without paying taxes is only $500."
Brazil,3c7hx4,thedreday,5,Sun Jul 5 17:27:26 2015 UTC,i can't just walk into the post office or whatever and show them my passport and open the box and show them it's a used piece of equipment? I mean for fuck sakes i gotta pay tax on my own personal item !?!?! this is crazy

Brazil,3c7hx4,b34t0,2,Sun Jul 5 18:05:43 2015 UTC,"OK, if you are Brazilian and want to avoid taxes for transporting tour own stuff, there is a""proof of residency "" document you can obtain. If a Brazilian has lived in the US for more than 13 months he/she can bring in stuff that is used. Maybe there is an equivalent for foreigners? But forget taxes, the transport is what's going to kill you."

Brazil,3c7hx4,rafalemos,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:47:14 2015 UTC,"While shipping you get to tell them how much it's worth. I heard anything under $50 won't get taxed, but I have zero sources that back that. Also, they might screen your item to see if you were honest when declaring the value. So I would say you should ask whoever is in the US to shop for quotes from UPS, FedEx, dhl, see who charges less. But I think you are going to pay about the cost of the device to get it shipped, even if you do not get hit by taxes."

Brazil,3c7hx4,logicescapesme,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:49:26 2015 UTC,"If it's an option, have a friend or a coworker visit you in Rio bring it. Take them to a nice brazilian barbecue and show them a good time in Rio as payment.  Honestly, I think this will be the most reliable way your goods will go through customs without being taxed. Any shipping method you choose, you will run the risk of being hit with tax. Having someone bring it gives you the best probability of not being hit with the tax."
Brazil,3c7hx4,caks,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:22:27 2015 UTC,"You are screwed. Since your item only costs $300, all you can do is buy another one here. You will probably pay $600 US for it though!

Brazil,3c586b,fazoids,2,Sun Jul 5 04:14:24 2015 UTC,"wow, let me clarify somethings other than this guy's opinion. Rio is the most visited city in the southern hemisphere and has the best touristic infrastructure. It is the second largest economy in the country, it's not decadent and live of its past (quite the contrary, it should value its history more), it has experienced an economic growth that surpass the rest of the country and is host of the Olympic next year. What happens is, it's a city that can generate passionate reaction among Brazilians (not with tourists tho, they more than often like it). First because Rio is associated with Brazil quite often, and they feel left out and unrepresented (which is fair), and second, because cariocas tend to be viewed as arrogant and false people, which can definitely make people hate here (I still don't like Parisians). As for violence, Rio is not even close of being the most dangerous place, just look at the chart with the capital cities. So, remember, you're in a huge touristic city, be aware of course, but enjoy the experience."

If you're in Santa Catarina I think it'd be silly for you to not visit Paran√° which is only a few hours away. Go to Foz do Igua√ßu to see the falls. On the same state I'd suggest looking at Ilha do Mel, preferably going down by train or by the Graciosa to Morretes (eat barreado). The canyon Quartela (sometimes spelled Guartela). Ilha Superagui is stunning too! Close to ilha do Mel, with dolphins humming birds, orchids, monkeys and you can see parrots flying to the cannopies morning and evening.  Ilha grande is cool but it's in Rio. There's beautiful stuff to see much closer to where you will be. If you do go to Iguazu go to the Parque das Aves!  I'm sure someone from Santa Catarina will be able to suggest stuff even closer. Rio Grande do Sul is pretty but I think particularly magical in winter...."

Also, that is very optimistic of you. We barely can have decent education in schools, so I have no hope that we will achieve any kind of good rehabilitation system soon.   It is the same thing about gun legalization. The best situation (in my opinion) would be ban guns and the police doing their job on making the city safe. Since we can't make cities safe, it is just pointless to ban guns. We can't apply first world logic on our country yet.   I know that people fight for the best possible outcome. But when the best possible outcome is absolutely out of reach, we should look forward mid term solutions.   Anyway, sometimes I think about the subject, and looks like that the decisive factor that makes me have option A or B is how much a believe in the country. I noticed a tendency where patriots and optimistic are against the lowering, because they believe that the government can actually do something about it. Those who are in favor, are the ones who don't believe in the country (which is unfortunately, my case).

Having said that, I am of the opinion that lowering the age of criminal responsibility will not solve this. On the contrary, it has a great potential make it worse. Much worse. In Brazil we have the 4th largest prison population in the world according to the International Centre for Prison Studies (ICPS). Our prison system is under funded, over crowded and ineffective. The modern prison's aim is to be used as a criminal rehabilitation center not simply a holding area. Unfortunately, due to the current situation in the Brazilian penal system, most of the adults that come out of the facilities will become repeat offenders. Today, the prisons operate mostly as a holding cell, it does not effectively reinstate adults back into society and does not address the underlying issue.   As you may or may not know, many of the under age perpetrators may have been coerced by adults to commit crimes to game the system. If the criminal responsibility age is reduced - what keeps adults from coercing even younger citizens to continue gaming the system? Then what? reduce the age again? It will be a vicious cycle as it does not address the underlying issue.   Further more as amnesty international put it     Lowering the legal age of criminal responsibility and excluding children aged 16 to 18 from the juvenile justice system would also breach Brazil‚Äôs international obligations. These include the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice and various standards from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. They all lay out how children should be provided with specific treatment in a juvenile justice system that takes into account specific needs according to their age.   So today we have the World's 4th largest population of prisoners detained in the over crowded prisons, who are not being rehabilitated.... and we want to increase this statistic?   If this law passes, the over crowded prison population will increase by the large amount of 16-18 year old delinquents (in their formative period), Brazil will breach international standards and coerce an even larger amount of civilians under the age of 16 to a life of crime. Is this an effective solution? Will this reduce crime rates?  I understand our current situation in Brazil is horrible regarding violent youth. However I believe this law will not even work as a band-aid to buy us time, on the contrary, it will add fuel to the flame.   Instead of focusing on such laws, I believe the way we need to address the high rates of adolescent crime rates is by addressing the fundamental right to an education, increase efforts to protect children and implement effective rehabilitation and resocialization mechanisms in the prisons. There is no quick fix to this issue. A simple lowering of the criminal responsibility age will not fix our fucked up society. I may be wrong ... its just my two cents.   *Edit - formatting"

My number #1 tip is: don't walk around with valuables, like professional cameras, expensive bikes, or anything that catches too much attention. Always pay attention to your surroundings, as in any big city in the world, there are a lot of pickpockets. Other than that you should be fine, I walked around with my cellphone day and night and nothing happened to me, just be prudent and that will be enough. Avoid famous sketchy areas, such as downtown at night , and favelas. Even if you plan on going for some reason, just take enough money with you to grab a taxi and some drinks, and of course an ID.  Rio is safe, just don't walk around showing that you have money and you should be fine. And most importantly, enjoy the city. It is marvelous."

Brazil,3bljid,zanycomet,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:24:39 2015 UTC,"Well, I carry my ID with me everywhere, no matter how safe the country is. If something happens to you, authorities can identify you and your embassy. Just carry your national ID, it will suffice."
Brazil,3bljid,guinv8,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:50:09 2015 UTC,"I think the importance of carrying an ID at all times when going out is exaggerated. I hardly ever take an ID with me and it has never been a problem in over a year. Even the police don't say much if they ask you and you say you don't have one with you. The only time it's important is when going to an event where you get issued with a card to buy drinks etc. (pay when you leave), but even this isn't a problem when you are with friends. They just say ""Oh we're sorry. He's a gringo and he didn't know"" and the operator puts your account under your friend's details instead. I usually just take one credit card, some cash and when I know ID is definitely required, my foreign driver's licence (not easily replaced and I might need it to drive!). Many countries don't even have a national ID card, mine included. Personally I think it's generally a bad idea to take original documents out with you. However, there is no harm in carrying photocopies or photos of your documents on your phone. These should suffice for all emergency situations and some routine situations.   And Rio is awesome. I always look forward to going back. Not sure why you are even concerned, considering you speak fluent Port. Then again, there are plenty of Brazilians who've never been to Rio who're also shit scared of the place .... Hah."

Brazil,3bljid,Grazzi,2,Tue Jun 30 19:38:16 2015 UTC,"Well, most importantly you must be aware of your surroundings. Not only will it help you to avoid getting into an undesirable situation, robbers tend to prefer inattentive victims. Granted, being aware won't guarantee they'll steer away from you but it sure reduces the chances.   It is fine to use your cellphone on the streets and even at night if the place is well populated and brightly lit. Just make sure you stay aware and don't zone-out using your phone. Always keep a small quantity (around R$20) in an easily acessible pocket. This makes sure you can get the money if the guy demands it. A lot of places accept international credit cards. If you need to carry a large ammount of money, do it over the smallest on-foot distance possible. Either take a cab or withdraw money from a place close to where you pretend to spend it. Split large ammounts of money into smaller parts and spread them on all your pockets. This reduces the bulge, making it harder to notice. If you do find yourself being robbed, keep calm and avoid making sudden moves. Try to communicate what you'll be doing. ""I'm getting the money from my pocket"" or ""I'm getting my wallet"".   And don't believe the comments here that say the robbers just want the money and don't want to hurt you. Always assume they mean harm, never assume they're not armed. It just isn't worth to get hurt or risk your life for a couple bucks or a cellphone.  Also, it is not the jungle you think it is. Most parts of Rio are really safe, just make sure to ask friends/relatives that live here if an area is dangerous or not.  Cheers, and I hope you have a great time here :)"

Brazil,3bjkth,tanquinho,13,Mon Jun 29 19:21:27 2015 UTC,"The interesting thing about Rio is, so a lot of wealthy people and/or tourists rationalize in order to find comfort living in such a violent city.  ‚ÄúThe real dangerous part is the Baixada, and as long as I stay out of the favelas and don‚Äôt get mixed up in drugs, I‚Äôll be fine,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a tourist, and killing me would be more hassle than it‚Äôs worth for some favelado,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in a good neighborhood, I‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù  All of these sentiments are in no way based in fact, but this is one of the ways that people find comfort here.  But those particular narratives have been challenged by a string of stabbings and killings.  That doctor who got killed biking in Lagoa, I guess he didn't even try to fight back.  Common knowledge in Rio says ""hey, you're going to get mugged; everybody does if you live here long enough.  All you gotta do is keep your head down, don't make any sudden movements, give all your stuff, and don't hold anything back, and 99% of the time, you'll be fine.  You'll just lose your shit.""  So when senseless killings happen in Lagoa and the guy apparently didn‚Äôt even try to fight back, you just feel a little more helpless and start to chirp about it.  Second, a number of tourists have been stabbed, in broad daylight, in relatively touristy places.  A couple of years ago, these things simply didn‚Äôt happen, and the problem has been getting worse.  Here‚Äôs an article on that: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3093963/Violence-returned-Increase-knife-attacks-tourists-sees-Brazilian-police-step-patrols-Rio-Janeiro-fears-grow-hosting-2016-Olympics.html    However, there‚Äôs a reason none of the articles I found give any hard statistics: crime actually isn‚Äôt on the rise in Rio, at least violent crime, at least by official statistics, as u/fazoids pointed out.  At least as late as last month, there had been way fewer attempted violent crimes in Rio, and the same number of deaths compared to the same period in 2014: http://noticias.uol.com.br/ultimas-noticias/agencia-estado/2015/05/21/numero-de-crimes-com-arma-branca-cai-25-no-rio.htm  So you‚Äôre partially right.  This is just rich people whining ‚Äì I remember a classic juxtaposition about a year ago where a white Brazilian woman was abducted from an upscale shopping mall and taken somewhere, where they emptied her credit cards, and then returned her, unharmed.  Same day, four (probably innocent) young black boys died in Mar√© and I‚Äôll let you guess which one was front page news.    But these rich people are whining with solid reason.  Violent crime does seem to be happening more in upscale areas.  But I‚Äôd wager that favelas, especially south zone favelas, are making up for that uptick in upscale neighborhood violent crime by being drastically safer places to live than they were just a few years ago.  Shouts out to Vidigal, where I live, for having no reported robberies on Onde Fui Roubado (http://ondefuiroubado.com.br/rio-de-janeiro/RJ).  Isso √© viver no morro, meu broder.    Let‚Äôs take all that with a grain of salt, because Rio‚Äôs official statistics aren‚Äôt all that reliable.  I‚Äôd really like to see a site like Onde Fui Roubado do some more robust data mining to give some crowdsourced statistics ‚Äì they‚Äôre starting to do that, but they have a long way to go.  So, TL;DR, rich people and tourists are whining, although they have good reason, Rio‚Äôs a violent city but some statistics suggest that on the whole it‚Äôs getting less violent.    Take a knife in your checked luggage, make sure it‚Äôs in a sheath.  I did it, all my friends did it, and if you‚Äôre used to walking around with one in the States, you might find comfort having one here, or just use it for day-to-day around the house stuff.  However, what u/nonplayer says is definitely truth.  A 15 year old who‚Äôs rocked out on crack is going to care little for your knife, and his gang of friends would probably not be afraid of you, because, well, crack."

Brazil,3bcgr8,andreadi,2,Sun Jun 28 08:33:05 2015 UTC,"Not actually. You MAY get one, it is not a guaranteed thing. It takes about a month or two to get approval, buying the gun and ammo is a hassle and transporting them is an even bigger one.  Not only that, it costs a large amount of money to acquire the right, the gun and to maintain (both). This means the lower and middle classes don't have access to them. And either have to acquire from illegal sources or let themselves be robbed/hurt/killed/etc."
Brazil,3bcgr8,GCandez,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:28:06 2015 UTC,"It's never guaranteed. I think most states have some form of limitation to whom may own a firearm. There is bureacracy, it is brazil.  Regarding price, ill grant you, it is a 2k at least investment, but there are places where you can pay in instalments."
Brazil,3bcgr8,andreadi,2,Wed Jul 1 02:50:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about the government limiting who can get a firearm. For instance, if the guy has a criminal background or is diagnosed with a mental disorder the obvious thing to do it not let him get a firearm. The problem is on Brazil, people that have the right, by law, to own a firearm, may not get it. It is the police chief's decision, in the end, that will determine if you get a permit or not. In the US, if you fulfill the requirements to own a firearm, you are GUARANTEED to get a firearm.  That's what I meant, sorry for not making it clearer ^  Oh, about the price, you have to pay 1k per year if I'm not mistaken to renew the permit. Not only that, a weapon is useless if you don't practice with it. Ammo is expensive and the places where you can train are scarce (and most of the times expensive, too). It's not a one time investment, that's the main issue.  That's one of the issues that the Bancada da Bala brought up. They want to guarantee that, if you fulfill the requirements, you WILL get a permit. Not only that they want to reduce the waiting time from 30~60 days to a 72 hours maximum. A lot of people get the need to acquire a weapon when they feel threatened. If it takes 2 months before you can get one it may be too late."

Most of them are conservative and right wing, I personally disagree with some of their beliefs. Their existence is not the problem though, I believe that the real problem is that we have all these different groups (bancada da bala, bancada evang√©lica, bancada ruralista etc etc) and they are elected only to defend their own interests, they are not there to work for the general population, they are only trying to increase their own benefits (through laws) and governmental influence."

It's 9 weeks in San Francisco and 6 weeks in NYC.  Apparently, both consulates require in-person applications, and they'll turn you away at the door without an appointment. The first available appointment is August 7th (too late for my already booked trip).  I've even tried seeing if I can apply through another consulate. No dice.

Brazil,3ayunj,FartOnToast,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:13:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, Rio had a 50% decrease in homicide rate in the last decade. For that to have happened, the number of homicides had to decrease in places where they were absurdly high, not only in the touristic areas (which are statistically irrelevant), and that implies in areas like the favelas and suburbs. So, despite the stereotypical view, it didn't start to happen because of the Olympics (Rio was only selected in 2008), and it didn't just happened in affluent areas of the city. True that the Olympics intensified everything, not only the action against crime, but investments in the city as a whole. What happened in the last couple of years is that the crime rate stagnated and is still in a very high level not compared to the rest of Brazil tho. Coincidently that occurred when the economy stagnated also. So, go figure."

Havn't really pried into why I would return before the 180 days are up, if I'm technically barred entry.

Some might think that HSBC leaving was a sign that other banks were in dire straits. But, as the article states, that is clearly not the case. I believe what really happened is that, like many other major players of the brazilian economy (notably automotive companies), HSBC was caught offguard by the economic standstill.   It needed a much greater scale in order to prosper and realized (sooner than later) that this was just not going to be the case anymore, their projections couldn't possibly come through at this stage. I exepect other major corporations to follow suit and leave Brazil as well, or at least have them drawing all their investments to an indefinite halt.

Before you leave home, get Google Translate and download PT-BR language for offline/SMS translating. Now a prepaid sim card (chip prepago) is the way to go without a doubt. I call my family in Australia over Google Hangouts or Skype over 4G via data.  The process you have to get one is; armed with your passport, buy sim card and register a number in store. Then go to a pharmacy or convenience store and providing your phone number, buy some credit to cover the offer and/or package you want to subscribe to. Then using SMS, subscribe to the offer and/or package - if you go back to the store they can help you.  TIM have a Visitor SIM which I found quite reasonable value. But from those I spoke to in Sao Paulo, Vivo is considered the best network.  I got a Vivo sim card and buy blocks of 600MB for R$24,99. If you're on Avenida Paulista, there's a Vivo store near the Renaissance Hotel that speak English. Otherwise upstairs at Shopping Patio Paulista is open late on Sunday."

Most recently I purchased a TIM sim card and getting that working properly was a week long affair. TIM blocked my sim because my address and other details were not registered, despite the fact I filled out the forms and provided this at the store when I purchased it.   Getting a mobile working is one of the most complicated things in Brazil so I'm glad to hear you no longer need a CPF, although I find it hard to believe."

If you can invest 100K to improve sewage collection for 2000 people why would you spend about the same money to benefit those 500 living in a favela of 100 houses? Besides that, a 100 houses favela in Brazil is considered a small favela and maybe it can be displaced to another place where infrastructure is already existent. I used to live in Porto Alegre (I live in europe now) and I saw small favelas in Porto Alegre to be moved to places where the city hall built descent houses for everybody. But the favelas (we  call them vilas in the south) in Porto Alegre are way smaller than the ones in Rio."

A lot by bureaucracy and corruption. In general these projects start but some months later they get abandoned and then the money disapears (sad history bro).

Brazil,39tndd,Khagda,23,Sun Jun 14 17:44:18 2015 UTC,"Bad news for you, there is squatting laws in Brazil, it is called usucapi√£o. And the fact someone was occupying the land, taking care of it, paying the taxes, paying for eletrical bill and water, empowers them to claim the land.  If someone occupies and takes care of it for 5 years in a row, they can claim ownership. So based on your story, there is no way of reclaiming the land and no way of making profit of it."
Brazil,39tndd,magicomplex,2,Sun Jun 14 18:45:36 2015 UTC,Even if it's private property? Wasn't this doctor trespassing for 5 whole years?   There must be something I can do otherwise I cannot believe what irresponsible morons my parents are.
Brazil,39tndd,magicomplex,17,Sun Jun 14 18:55:39 2015 UTC,"The concept of trespassing is very weak in Brazil compared to U.S. :D You cannot shoot or even harm a trespasser. If it happens in your property, you must call the cops.  In Brazil's law the land has a social role/value. If the land is not used by the owner, is just kept for speculation, this role is not being executed. Someone who 'trespasses' and give this value to the land will be able to claim full ownership after 5 years in a row. Within this 5 years the owner must call the cops or obtain an eviction notice from a judge. If it doesn't happen, you lost it.  It also happens in farms. If you live in a big firm and doesn't produce food, social movements like the Sem Terra (farm workers without land) will reclaim your land. The goverment will force you to sell it with a value usually lower than the market, fragment the farm in smaller properties and provide ownership of them to these farmer workers so they can have their own land. But they are obligated to produce food/goods. This process is called 'Reforma Agr√°ria'.  Your only chance to reclaim the land is:   1) The 'doctor' is only using eventually the land, not actually living or making part of his house (which I hardly belive, there is probably a pool there). 2) He isn't paying the taxes or he missed a bunch of them. 3) He wasn't keeping/using/staying the land for 5 years in a row but it will be easy for him to provide (or even create) proof he did.   Because people know the usucapi√£o rules, they intentionally do everything they can to claim the land after. So the odds are really against you."

Brazil,39tndd,mullerjones,10,Sun Jun 14 19:25:21 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer  The laws for usucapi√£o are different for rural properties, so you may still have some hope. Here some more info.   A usucapi√£o rural, tamb√©m denominado pro labore, tem como requisitos a posse como sua por 5 (cinco) anos ininterruptos e sem oposi√ß√£o, de √°rea rural n√£o superior a cinquenta hectares, desde que j√° n√£o seja possuidor de qualquer outro im√≥vel, seja este rural ou urbano. Ainda apresenta como requisito o dever de tornar a terra produtiva por seu trabalho ou de sua fam√≠lia, tendo nela sua moradia. [...] A usucapi√£o rural e urbano est√£o previstas nos artigos 1.239 e 1.240 do CC [c√≥digo civil], respectivamente.    Some conditions the doctor may not fulfill:   He must no own any other property, be it rural or urban. A doctor probably has another property. The property must not be larger than 5 hectares. Check the size of the property and you may have luck. 5 hectares is not that much for rural properties. Also, if the owner was outside the country while serving publicly Brazil, it's states, or it's cities then the usucapi√£o is voided. Last, but not least, the doctor need to move forward a civil action requesting his ownership under usucapi√£o to, then, become it's rightful owner. So, if he didn't move the action yet, your grandparent is still the owner."
Brazil,39tndd,biririri,5,Sun Jun 14 19:25:07 2015 UTC,"Also not a lawyer, but I want to make a few corrections I think are actually what the law says here.    The property must not be larger than 5 hectares. Check the size of the property and you may have luck. 5 hectares is not that much for rural properties.    The property can be much larger. The actual translation of that part states that he must be in possession of an area no larger than 50 hectares, which means he might be in a much larger property but claim ownership to only that part of it. At least that's how I interpret it.    Last, but not least, the doctor need to move forward a civil action requesting his ownership under usucapi√£o to, then, become it's rightful owner. So, if he didn't move the action yet, your grandparent is still the owner.    Also probably irrelevant. His grandparent would still technically be the owner of the land, but he wouldn't be able to do jackshit with it. As soon as he tried to get them out of the land, they would start their own action to get it, so it wouldn't matter. It's like a checkmate in chess - your king isn't taken yet, but there's nothing you can do to stop it from happening."

Brazil,39tndd,ronconcoca,6,Mon Jun 15 15:09:19 2015 UTC,"I actually am a lawyer and the reality is even worse for OP.  This form of usucapi√£o is a special form, but if the squatter doesn't fulfill its conditions, he can still apply for the general usucapi√£o, which takes place in 15 years.  The only conditions for the general form is that he possesses the land as his own, i.e., not as a renter or as an employee of the owner (this is the famous animus domini), and that his possession is unopposed for the duration of the usucapi√£o.  If he lives in the place or established a business in there, the duration is reduced to 10 years.  He doesn't even have to sue the owner, as the usucapi√£o can be argued as a means of defense. Hence, if OP tries to get the land back with a lawsuit, he can use the usucapi√£o to become a true owner."

Brazil,39tndd,desixree,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:09:14 2015 UTC,"Just because it's a lot of land, doesn't mean it's worth much!  Rural land can be pretty cheap if it isn't farmland.  Just because you put the land up for sale, doesn't mean you're going to find a buyer.  Everyone puts a for sale sign on their land, it's like the first thing you do when you move in it seems!   So you'll be sitting a pool of for sale signs, where 95% aren't actually going to sell, unless you offer them 10x the best market rate there is.  Or basically if you're an idiot and don't realize you're offering 10x as much as you should.  This probably won't be as cut and dry as you hoped, and will require a lawyer, and possibly a court action.  You'll have to prove you actually own the land as well.    I guess you could try and figure out where the land is, and then start working out size and trying to compare it with other land for sale in the area.  If you alert anyone to this, they might try and take action on their own, so I wouldn't exactly be forthcoming with what you're trying to do, until you have more information.  Who knows, you might talk to the doctors relatives.  And as you can see from others, the laws are complex."

Any other things you are looking at that I might help?"
Brazil,39tqhb,austsw,3,Sun Jun 14 18:26:59 2015 UTC,"$40USD isn't exactly cheap for a dinner.. especially not pizza...  $40USD for lunch, then you have dinner as well.  Eating out in Brazil for the most part seems to be hit or miss, with a lot more misses, especially as prices get higher."

For $40 you can do half decently well at some restaurants in the US, while here it's not the best!

Brazil,39hqtq,Human-Fhtagn,6,Thu Jun 11 20:12:37 2015 UTC,"Interior of Bahia?  You're about to find out just how ""not picky"" you are...  Imported booze will be 1) expensive and 2) pretty hard to find in the countryside.  Your best bet will be johnny walker red, priced around R$80.  Maybe you'll also find whitehorse, bellantines, and chivas...  Nationally produced ""scotch"" that you might find are Drury's and Passaporte... both pretty gnarly but reasonably priced.. maybe R$40..  I would advise against drinking these without a mixer.. and even then....  If I can make a recommendation, it would be to try different cacha√ßas.  It will be much higher quality and reasonably inexpensive.  They do a lot of ""artesanal"" cacha√ßas with different flavors.. cinnamon and clove, honey, and tons of cool brazilian fruits like jabodicaba, buti√£, etc.  Look for stuff from the state of Minas... good straight, or of course in a caipirinha.    Otherwise you've got your smirnoff, skyy, and cheaper national vodkas.  Bacardi for rum, cuervo for tequila.  Pretty basic liquor selections I'm afraid.  Plent of good south american wines, if you're into that."
Brazil,39hqtq,sorriso_pontual,2,Thu Jun 11 20:37:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know a whole lot about different kinds of alcohol. I do know that you have to try Cacha√ßa if you haven't already. It's made out of sugar cane and Brazil is known for it. Try a drink called Caipirinha, basically lemon, sugar and cacha√ßa.  Good whiskey is pretty expensive here, due to import taxes. Assuming you're American, you'll notice a big difference. Of course, bringing in dollars, everything will be much cheaper. A bottle of Jack Daniels costs around R$ 100. A bottle of Johny Walker's Black Label costs a bit more, around R$ 130.  What's different here is that you can find all kinds of liquor in grocery stores, unlike in America. Whiskey, vodka and other kinds. Yup.  Legal drinking age here is 18 but your ID is hardly checked.   Shoot me a PM if you need any more info."

If you don't plan on bringing your own, maybe buy a couple of bottles on the Duty Free when you arrive in the country (before going through customs), it is usually cheaper there.  On the other hand, you're coming just in time for the S√£o Jo√£o season, and it's a festivity that is usually much more popular in the interior of Bahia than the capital, especially in cities like Cruz das Almas, Amargosa, etc. And there is a type of drink that is abundant this time of year: liquor. Most are tropical fruit flavors, some of the fruits I'm sure you've never even heard of.   It's very different from whisky, but give them a try, they're quite flavorful, also they're usually not expensive. I'm not really a drinker, but always taste a few during the festivities. This time of year it is also very common to see a bottle of liquor in some businesses (like a store or even a doctor's office) with small plastic cups next to them for people to try."

Also, a famous scientist in the country actually died from exposition to frog poison (or at least that was among the causes for his frail health in the end). So maybe this contributed for some kind of irrational fear spreaded over the population.  Indeed, I think that is just part of the overall obsession of Brazilians with higiene and distance from wildlife. (You probably also noticed that Brazilians seldom - or never - eat something using just their bare hands.) Living in a country full of tropical diseases and not-so-friendly animals can do that.  That said, of course there are exceptions. Personally I like the local varieties of bullfrog, which are kind of common in my state. They are cute, in a fat and awkward way. =)"

I don't like the most famous beaches, they are too crowded. You can take a look at Itacoatiara beach in Niteroi or, if you have the time, more far away beaches like Trindade.  If you have to chose between visiting Christ-the-redeemer or the Sugar Loaf, go to the Sugar Loaf. Really. The Christ gets waaaay overcrowded and once you get up there, there really isn't much to see. The Sugar Loaf, on the other hand, has two mountains, large areas, not too crowded, you can by snacks there and pass a whole day just chilling and enjoying the view. Once every month or so I visit it, by trail. It's fun, healthy and costs R$0,00 =). But I wouldn't recommend it for a tourist visit, it's worth it to pay for the whole thing.

Brazil,39bq5g,rfzero,6,Wed Jun 10 18:22:37 2015 UTC,"Arroz carreteiro is the way to go. Brazilian barbecue is quite hard to prepare properly, even if you get the Brazilian cuts, it's still a lot of work. Make the arroz. Also, if you can get some chimarr√£o to share after eating, that would be awesome. If you go after the chimarr√£o you'll need: the Yerba Mate, a bombilla and a cuya (or porongo, or guampa).  Barbecue is a more closely associated with Rio Grande do Sul state (of which Porto Alegre is the capital), but the whole country is crazy about it. Chimarr√£o is more specific to the state, instead of being a whole country thing."

Brazil,399phd,happinessisonepiece,8,Wed Jun 10 07:06:39 2015 UTC,"It's hard to find a real positive outcome of the World Cup, other than that Brazil could show it is able to host a pharaonic event. Although I wouldn't blame the current recession on it--that is more due to crazy spending by the government in the past few years, and the World Cup is just a small part of that.  The stadiums had the fate that everyone (save for the handful of relentless optimists in the government) was predicting. It was already hard to get a decent attendance before the World Cup; now it's even harder because the current stadiums are far too luxurious for Brazil, and the higher cost of keeping them translates into higher ticket prices. And at any rate, the population is increasingly less interested in watching games in a stadium, a trend that has started some time ago and shows no signs of stopping.  But as I said, most people more or less knew that would happen. The real hope was in the government's other plan: to build much needed infrastructure in the host cities. Since these projects would be a good thing regardless of the state of the national football league, it was hard to argue against them. The challenge was, of course, whether they would actually be built. The expectation was that, since those projects would in principle be needed for a successful World Cup, everyone would work hard in getting them finished.  But, as deadlines approached, the government reverted to temporary measures and changed the original project so that it could be said it was finished. Projects were either removed or changed so that they would need less infrastructure while still accomodating the influx of tourists. As an example, there was a project - started in 2009! - for building a light rail system in Bras√≠lia. But a year later it was discovered that there had been fraud in the bidding process for the project, and so it was shelved, and later removed from the plan for World Cup. In the end, the government made do by buying new buses and introducing bus-only lanes.  (I'm reading now that a new call for bids has been opened, but now that the World Cup is over, there's no rush to get the project done, so I'm not very optimistic.)  Even if we stick to the final plan, the outcome has been disappointing. According to this story (in Portuguese), from the 44 projects planned, only 24 have been finished. One interesting example is the one of the light rail system in Cuiab√°, which is still in its initial phase and has already spent over 70% of its budget.  So, I don't think people are generally happy with the World Cup, although there are currently bigger things to worry about. As expected, the big beneficiary of the event was FIFA."

Brazil,397oq7,congruous_nz,6,Tue Jun 9 21:15:19 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about IPTU? If the contract states that the renter has to pay, then it's on you, but if it doesn't, it's up to the owner to do so. That applies to long term contracts (30 months).

Brazil,397oq7,abrasiliandad,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:22:58 2015 UTC,"Actually, the Rent Law determines that the IPTU should be paid by the owner, unless the contract expresses the contrary.  So, if the contract doesn't mention IPTU, it's on the owner."

Some contracts specifies to the tenant to pay it.   Regarding the payment issues is probably something regarding the administration of your building. I live in an apartment that I don't need to keep the receipt to prove to them that I paid the bills. Also, I use internet banking to pay all my bills, condom√≠nio included.  I'm not completly sure about this, but I think you can only use debit card from Caixa Econ√¥mica Federal or cash to pay bills in Lot√©ricas.

Certainly more likely than ""landlord/realtor/lawyer forgot to write down this extremely important point"".  Yeah, contracts suck, I live in Japan and it took me over 1 hour to go over my rental contract (written in Japanese), I know how it is. But there's nothing particularly Brazilian about it.   I find it really strange that I can use my credit cards at small restaurants, bars, supermarkets - basically anywhere that has a card reader machine. But try to pay a utility bill with a foreign card .... Forget about it.    It's not that strange. The card reader is just one piece of it. Different establishments connect to different card processors, not all processors are connected to international networks, accepting international credit cards might involve more work related to settlement/fraud prevention, etc.   Most people who need to pay utility bills in Brazil have either cash or a Brazilian credit card, so they probably decided that accepting foreign-issued cards isn't worth the trouble.   ""Oh yeah, you must 'liberate' your account but you can only do that at the agency in which you opened the account"".    Similar thing in Japan. They do this due to regulations and to be decrease the risk of unauthorized use. The flip side is that, if someone gets unauthorized access to your account with no fault of your own, the bank is usually on the hook for it."
Brazil,397oq7,brend123,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:51:35 2015 UTC,"It's for tax reasons.  In brazil the owner can't write off IPTU collected from you, so he would end having to pay taxes on it, and then pay it himself.     In most places, this would be a business expense and directly written off.  Thus he would collect $500, pay $500 and no taxes would be due.  In Brazil he would owe 15% on the $500, even though it was being used for a business expense."
Brazil,397oq7,hastbru,0,Wed Jun 10 13:45:33 2015 UTC,"It depends on the contract. Regarding your frustration to pay bills, you are not the only one.

I didn't join the company with that intention in mind, it occasionally happened. And even in that case, the opportunity came up after I'd been working for them for 1.5 years.

Brazil,396dgw,alleycatbiker,2,Wed Jun 10 04:06:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think there are any red flags that would get his tourist visa denied. During his interview, he could say everything they want to hear. Assuming everything is at least half true, he could show documentation for his house, car, kids, family or anything else that would make him not ""abandon"" Brazil and never return.  I say he should give it a try. Considering they can afford plane tickets and him not working for a certain amount of time, the visa is not that expensive, specially if he lives in a city close to a consulate.  To OP: I've noticed that a lot of people in Brazil are also European citizens, specially if he lives in the south. If he has an European passport, it's not that hard to get a visa (read more: ESTA). He could stay in the US for 3 months and only pay a small fee for the visa."
Brazil,396dgw,vitorbrazil,4,Tue Jun 9 19:57:11 2015 UTC,"The European passport thing is clever. In fact, I have a Brazilian friend whose grandfather was German and he managed to get an European passport.  About the tourism visa, the fact that his intention is to meet with a potential fianc√©e/spouse is a big red flag for the consulate. Maybe it's worth giving it a try, but the chances are even smaller if his age is between 20-35. I talk about my own experience. My sister was planning to come visit me for the holidays, but she got rejected in the US consulate twice for these reasons. Even with proof of employment and the documents of her car, they just considered the fact that she's single and young, and has a sibling who lives legally in the US."
Brazil,396dgw,alleycatbiker,2,Tue Jun 9 20:23:20 2015 UTC,"Well, there's that. Regarding the German citizenship, I think you have to take a test and pass it in order to obtein citizenship. Each country has is own rules, OP should check it out if it's his case. I got my Italian citizenship a few years ago, and apparently there's a huge queue, like 5 or 10 years.  About the visa, does he have to say he's going to visit a potential fianc√©e? Isn't there an alternative, like booking a hotel or something like that? People go to Miami and Orlando for a week all the time and aparently have no problem getting a visa. If you don't mind me asking, how long ago did your sister try to get hers? I thought they were being a bit more relaxed about that.."
Brazil,396dgw,vitorbrazil,2,Tue Jun 9 20:29:41 2015 UTC,"I guess OP could arrange a trip to Florida and apply for the visa, as you said.   My sister's rejected applications were both in 2015. And in both cases they told her she didn't prove her bonds with the country, thus not enough will to return. Our google-search-based analysis concluded the red flags were her age, being single and having a close relative in a legal immigrant status."
Brazil,396dgw,haberdasher42,2,Tue Jun 9 21:29:07 2015 UTC,"That's the thing. If those are really the reason why she wasn't approved, that's just stupid on their part.  It doesn't make sense for them. She being her age, single and having a relative legal in another country are all characteristics that make someone travel somewhere, even for a short vacation. People usually travel when they're young and don't have kids. In theory, being single and not going with a significant other would be better, but still..  Anyway, I hope she eventually gets to go visit you. America is a beautiful country and everyone should have the chance to visit in order to be able to better see what's wrong with our culture and country nowadays."

Mind you, its not a cheap travel - particularly for brazilians to go the US right now due to the price of the dollar, but it is well worth the effort to meet him before you make your decision.  As far as the process goes, well. Its not easy for a Brazilian to get to the US. Travel visas are somewhat ok, but you really need to have travel plans - plane tickets, hotel tickets and all, and the US consulate must be reasonable certain that you are going to come back.

The university is a potential a partner. Elbit Systems are know to produce weapons that are used in the Israeli-Palestine conflict. Pro-Palestine organisations, students and academics pressure the university's administration to disclose whatever deals they might have with the company or the Israeli establishment.  University sends an email to all of their departments asking if there are any current or future Israeli students or academics in their specific department.

Brazil,392q1o,katieatjana,2,Mon Jun 8 20:47:10 2015 UTC,"I own a low-cost smartphone (Lumia 520), all I can say is that in this segment Windows Phone is way better than it's competitors. There is no comparison between an android costing less than R$500 and one Windows phone in the same price range.  For sure, there are problems, like lack of some local apps, that are mostly developed to android. But I believe windows 10 mobile will change this."
Brazil,38vx7o,Travellingdropout,3,Sun Jun 7 07:33:11 2015 UTC,"Catho.com.br  Infojobs.com.br Vagas.com.br Indeed.com.br  Those are the major job search websites in Brazil. Catho has the best quality, Indeed have the best quantity.   Can you give us an idea of what kind of teaching position are you looking for? What area and what level? Finding a job teaching English in elementary school is very different than finding a job teaching Voltaire for philosophy majors."

Brazil,38vx7o,arrakis3k,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:26:05 2015 UTC,Facebook group's! Which technology you want to work? Tell me what I refer you to the groups.
Brazil,38vx7o,mmb27,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:41:56 2015 UTC,Both would be great

Brazil,38vx7o,sophia_parente,-1,Wed Jun 10 10:36:05 2015 UTC,Craigslist is always full of schools looking to hire native teachers at an average rate.
Brazil,38vx7o,OuchLOLcom,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:10:21 2015 UTC,Craigslist is not popular in Brazil. Don't waste your time.
Brazil,38vx7o,borba72,4,Sun Jun 7 17:35:41 2015 UTC,You obviously don't check it. Its full of english teaching jobs.
Brazil,38vx7o,OuchLOLcom,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:40:13 2015 UTC,But only for the few capitals it has.
Brazil,38vx7o,felipebf,0,Mon Jun 8 01:10:20 2015 UTC,"To teach english? Is easy as hell if you are a native speaker.  If you stablish a network you can teach private classes at the student home or in yours. My sister make R$60/hour in private, and R$25 at a english school."
Brazil,38xep5,RomanianRasta,13,Sun Jun 7 17:39:03 2015 UTC,Nice trolling.
Brazil,38xep5,TrilionarioAcreano,5,Sun Jun 7 18:30:09 2015 UTC,"The vast vast majority of Brazil was never a spanish colony. The parts that were weren't for long. We were a portuguese colony and we speak portuguese, not spanish."
Brazil,38xep5,IceCreamPirate,-6,Sun Jun 7 17:48:56 2015 UTC,So why did Brazil conquer Spain then?
Brazil,38xep5,karkar01,3,Sun Jun 7 17:53:17 2015 UTC,Send your CIV V save so I can answer properly
Brazil,38xep5,roronoapedro,3,Sun Jun 7 19:05:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but not sure if bait.  Can you clarify your question?"
Brazil,38xep5,roronoapedro,-1,Sun Jun 7 18:07:02 2015 UTC,I'm wondering why Brazil conquered Spain in 1892.
Brazil,38xep5,braziliantourist,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:13:18 2015 UTC,In a game?
Brazil,38xep5,braziliantourist,0,Sun Jun 7 20:18:09 2015 UTC,"What? No, in real life."
Brazil,38xep5,felipebf,3,Sun Jun 7 21:12:42 2015 UTC,What are you referring to. No such event occurred in 1892.
Brazil,38xep5,Mantabodyboarder,-2,Sun Jun 7 18:08:30 2015 UTC,We learned about it in History class.
