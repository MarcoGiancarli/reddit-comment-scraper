assettocorsa,3e33sv,SamL97,2,Tue Jul 21 16:29:22 2015 UTC,"12 valve? Any plans for the 24 valve? Any plans for S1+ mods, something like a step up to the 3.2L?  I only ask because my trackcar is a 2004 2.8L 24v GTI and I am a huge fan of the VR6 engine. Keep up the great work!"

assettocorsa,3e33sv,gu3st12,2,Wed Jul 22 05:38:54 2015 UTC,"Awesome! I cant believe of all the cars out there this is getting a mod for AC, a strange choice but I'm not complaining as I actually own a 2001 VW Bora V6 4-Motion (hence the username) in real life. Never thought I would be able to drive it in AC, thanks heaps to the creator of this mod! looks and sounds pretty good from the video."
assettocorsa,3e33sv,smudi,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:38:46 2015 UTC,I had one of the 1.8L turbo Jetta's (2001 as well. Jetta is the Bora in NA).  I wish this mod would have a version in the 1.8L FWD version.
assettocorsa,3e33sv,hexiit,2,Wed Jul 22 03:34:01 2015 UTC,"So, someone's gotta ask...  Where do these mods actually come from?  They definitely dont appear to be scratch made.  Are these just ripped from Forza and worked on?  :p  Definitely neat to have more cars around, but Id just be curious to hear where they originate and what was done on them for AC."

assettocorsa,3e3s4k,ProEpicness123,3,Tue Jul 21 19:02:23 2015 UTC,I was tired of repeating this on multiplayer. It should appear in like a big warning message every time you enter a race or something.

assettocorsa,3e3s4k,Xlariton,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:25:26 2015 UTC,I got cut off by a Zonda-R at Tourist while I was in a P4/5 once. Seems like the faster cars no one can drive quick...
assettocorsa,3e3s4k,Oreos_CS,2,Wed Jul 22 00:18:40 2015 UTC,"It is one thing for a faster car to hit you when you are slower, it is another thing for it to be the other way around.  I was driving on Tourist in a C7R. There was a 599XX Evo in front of me. I know that car is faster than my corvette.   Yet he is going at half speed, so when I try to pass him (in a terrible spot, nevertheless, in Wehrseifen, after Adenauer Forst) because he was slowing me up, he jerks left and smashes me into the wall, destroying my engine. If you need to learn a car, play singleplayer."

assettocorsa,3e4rqi,QuadroMan1,2,Tue Jul 21 23:16:05 2015 UTC,Racedepartment mods are usually pretty high quality. Most mods have crappy physics to the point that there's nothing there except aesthetics. http://thesimreview.blogspot.com/search/label/Assetto%20Corsa has a lot of mods.
assettocorsa,3e4rqi,Will12239,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:32:38 2015 UTC,"I like how you say that many mods out there have crappy physics and are nothing more than aesthetics, and then go on to link to that awful site where a quick browsing shows that it is an amalgamation of just about every mod out there.    Most of the mods on that site are god awful rips from other games like Forza.  RD and the AC forums are really the only 2 places for good mods.  RD less so because they allow some rather dubious mods but overall they arent bad."
assettocorsa,3e4rqi,smudi,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:41:44 2015 UTC,I gave him my position that rd mods are the only worthwhile mods then I answered his original question...

assettocorsa,3dx3bc,CGorman68,22,Mon Jul 20 06:41:35 2015 UTC,"Minor complaint but why do we have to be logged in to simply view the AC forums? It's not a secret society, just let me browse freely."

assettocorsa,3dx3bc,gamermusclevideos,9,Mon Jul 20 12:14:57 2015 UTC,So it's harder for people who have illegally downloaded the game to get mods and support etc.
assettocorsa,3dx3bc,OG_Kush_Master,2,Mon Jul 20 10:13:48 2015 UTC,But I saw people posting who had not licensed in their profile.

The community ends up suffering because of basic oversights like this. Making the site require log in doesn't deter pirates, it pisses off customers and drives them away."
assettocorsa,3dx3bc,RoscoStigson,9,Mon Jul 20 10:24:32 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure you need to have actually bought Assetto Corsa to be able to use the forums, so you can't just link any Steam account."
assettocorsa,3dx3bc,OG_Kush_Master,5,Mon Jul 20 11:59:25 2015 UTC,"It's not hard, no. But it still won't give you access.  Accounts have to be linked to a Steam account with AC purchased on it before you get access to the support and mod forums."
assettocorsa,3dx3bc,Syfoon,2,Mon Jul 20 13:34:22 2015 UTC,I had completely forgotten that.
assettocorsa,3dx3bc,RoscoStigson,2,Mon Jul 20 13:35:11 2015 UTC,I associated my AC account with my FB account - makes logging on there a hell of a lot easier!

assettocorsa,3dx3bc,Olizzker,2,Mon Jul 20 08:40:56 2015 UTC,I haven't personally tried this yet but the reviews are crazy good on RD. Looks like the official AC forum members are going crazy for it as well.

assettocorsa,3dx3bc,imonreddit,2,Mon Jul 20 13:41:42 2015 UTC,I am not at a computer with AC on it at the moment. Which version of the car is this? Which engine and how much HP?
assettocorsa,3dx3bc,bostromnz,2,Mon Jul 20 15:11:23 2015 UTC,"Heaps of fun, especially for those of us that want more manual RHD cars. Can it be optimised though? Getting pretty low FPS on a gtx780."

assettocorsa,3du70j,Spuddlepiddle,4,Sun Jul 19 16:10:59 2015 UTC,That makes me wonder which other tracks are not scanned. Any one have a list?
assettocorsa,3du70j,Will12239,14,Sun Jul 19 16:29:00 2015 UTC,AFAIK only Historic Monza and Trento Bondone.
assettocorsa,3du70j,Mr_Clovis,12,Sun Jul 19 16:38:13 2015 UTC,Monza because obviously they couldn't travel back in time and Trento because it's been converted from netKar pro

assettocorsa,3du70j,eobet,2,Mon Jul 20 11:08:38 2015 UTC,Well I'd wait and see what the explanation is (Stefano didn't give one). If they got the track license but not permission for a laserscan or if there were other unforeseen difficulties in the process they can't do much about it. Would you rather have no track at all?
assettocorsa,3du70j,dsoshahine,2,Mon Jul 20 14:18:49 2015 UTC,Stefano replied on the forums to a whole topic with whining people about it. Check it out. A link to the post is on the top of the OP in that topic.
assettocorsa,3du70j,IIIPHENOMIII,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:24:41 2015 UTC,"Alright thanks, I looked it up. And while I sympathise with them with the decision and stay to what I said about the possible real reason above, being neutral towards laserscan or not (I have no problems driving modded tracks without laserscan either and AC does lack a good variety of stock tracks so more are welcome either way in my opinion) for the record I have to say Stefano ""Lord Kunos"" made some really shitty replies in that thread. Sure the thread escalated a bit - but that doesn't mean he had to reply that way. Keeping a thread clean is job of moderators and his job as a dev is certainly not to bitch about how he doesn't have to tell anyone anything, in my eyes that's just unprofessional. If you don't want to tell then you're at least not publicly rude to your customers.   I'm glad that he apologised of course and I can indeed appreciate his apparent down-to-earth bluntness but as I said above it's unprofessional. Not something many people would put up when they're paying for their product.  And not quite on topic and please take this not the wrong way but... really don't get a particularly good feeling about their whole thought- and development process in respect to the future of AC at all anymore, small company with limited funding or not, free updates or not. I've supported them with money (bought the main game in Early Access, the Dream Pack day one and another game+DLC set for a friend at full price), thought the project is promising already (over 200hrs played offline) and gave them my trust but I see so little in return, an incomplete simulation that left Early Access too early and devs who engage in comment wars on the forums instead of focusing on working on even basic missing features for the game. Seriously assessing from the streams I thought Stefano's quite a nice person but that sort of stuff is something where he has to work on himself and can't blame anyone else for. /rant  So I'll wait and see how this all develops until next year when the console release drops. I've got a driving sim that shows promise already at least."
assettocorsa,3du70j,dsoshahine,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:34:22 2015 UTC,Yes I would rather be without it. Quality before quantity.

assettocorsa,3du70j,Serpent10i,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:01:24 2015 UTC,Stefano mentioned in the stream that the development of 1.2 is done [at the time of the stream] which doesn't say when coding was finished up - could be more than a week of testing until release.

assettocorsa,3dtupp,Viscerous_,7,Sun Jul 19 12:13:44 2015 UTC,I would personally rather pay for a laser-scanned version than get a free one that's not.
assettocorsa,3dtupp,Dokomox,19,Mon Jul 20 03:57:42 2015 UTC,"That sucks :/ The argument that 'it's free' doesn't hold up for me at all. I mean back when Nurbs GP was released it was just as free as this track, i.e. included in the purchase of the game, no additional DLC purchase required. Why would this track get a pass for being worse than it could have been, just because they slapped a 'bonus pack' sticker on it? It's not like the base game has more than enough content, these extra tracks and cars are sorely needed to round out the game. They should be of the same quality as the rest of the tracks that they'll sit alongside."
assettocorsa,3dtupp,GTOfire,10,Sun Jul 19 15:24:05 2015 UTC,"I get your disappointment, but when Nurburging GP was released the game was still in pre-released, and part of what people paid for AC 1.0. I also wish that Zandvoort was be laserscan, but it will be free add on. AFAIK Barcelona and Brands Hatch will be laserscanned and at least the former should be on its way fairly soon.   My only guess is that they had good enough topological data for Zandvoort and that laserscan is more expensive than we think. Though I remember reading a Kunos interview somewhere saying that all their track were laserscanned, which would imply that future official tracks would be too."
assettocorsa,3dtupp,0xdeadbee,7,Sun Jul 19 19:40:18 2015 UTC,"What I mean by comparing it to Nurbs is that to me there's no notable difference in the 'state' of the game from then to now. At the time they slapped a 1.0 Released label on the game, it was most certainly not a complete game by any standards, both in terms of feature set and amount of content. They sold the game to us on the promise of continued development, which made the 1.0 label a tiny bit less of a joke, but that means they can't just deliver lower quality content now for anything they don't charge additional money for IMO.  As for 'fairly soon', well... are you sure we're talking about the same game here? :P"
assettocorsa,3dtupp,GTOfire,3,Sun Jul 19 20:08:33 2015 UTC,"Fair enough :)  As I said, I'm also a bit disappointed that it won't be laserscanned. Thing is: like you I've been playing AC since before 1.0, and I enjoy it so much that I do get a bit defensive about Kunos. Though it is true that they can be frustrating at time. As a software developer sometimes I just want to call them and say ""guys: let me give you a hand with the shitty stuff and you can worry about the big picture!"" :)  But then again I really enjoy Stefano's live streams, it's a great opportunity to get insight about he goes about developing AC, and he's not shy about answer questions!"
assettocorsa,3dtupp,0xdeadbee,2,Sun Jul 19 20:37:41 2015 UTC,I rather have Zandavoort than Barcelona to be laser scanned. Barcelona is a fairly flat in it's topography. Zandavoort has some banked curves that will benefit from laser scans.   I was looking forward to laser scanned Zandavoort in AC as I do really like Zandavoort in R3E. Looks like it will not happen then. :(
assettocorsa,3dtupp,Cheesenium,4,Mon Jul 20 06:20:08 2015 UTC,"Kunos is in a rush for the console release next year. Compromising quality is not a surprise. They've done it up till now with the core of the sim and now the content too. It's disappointing, yet just Kunos being Kunos."
assettocorsa,3dtupp,glitchymagoo,5,Sun Jul 19 20:53:19 2015 UTC,I'm really wondering if this has something to do with the console release... And I see people being downvoted for saying that the track being free does not make for a good argument: laserscanned tracks are one of major selling points for AC.
assettocorsa,3dtupp,darthmase,0,Sun Jul 19 23:02:39 2015 UTC,I just wonder if the typical console gamer would care much about whether the tracks are laser scanned or not. I don't think so. In fact I'd say that most casual gamers couldn't care less.   So... this has probably dawned on Kunos. Why waste money on laser scanning when the new target audience probably couldn't care less?
assettocorsa,3dtupp,glitchymagoo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:57:06 2015 UTC,"AC is going to consoles so brace yourself for more quality reductions, this is only the beginning.   Even with laserscanning its tracks were already well below the quality of iRacing's, so it can only get worse without laserscanning. This is not a good thing.  It's going to be quantity over quality from now on. How else are they gonna get us over 100 cars within year?"
assettocorsa,3dtupp,MarelliMagneti,2,Sun Jul 19 20:25:52 2015 UTC,"AC's laserscans ""well below quality of iRacing..."" Could you expound upon this a bit more? Is AC's surface resolution lower or something?"
assettocorsa,3dtupp,pxld1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:35:39 2015 UTC,"Even in terms of accuracy, AC's laser scan is comparably lower than iRacing. AC's laser scan only have 2cm accuracy while iRacing has less than 1mm accuracy. Accuracy is important in real surveying work but I don't think it is as much of an importance in games. Even if a terrain is 2 inches off, I doubt we could tell the difference.  The main reason I think that AC's laser scan is inferior than iRacing is because AC does its laser scan via a moving truck where the truck's suspension movements and car body rolls will have a pretty serious effect on the quality of the scan. You could use gyroscope or other device to correct the inaccuracy but I really doubt it is enough. iRacing does theirs via conventional tripod laser scan that eliminates that issue. There are also other factors that affect the quality of laser scan, such as air temperature, distortion effects, smoke and so on. At the end, it depends whether the developers did or did not take account of these factors.   Also, I am not sure why Kunos wants to do laser scan via their truck though as you need to drive the vehicle from Italy to where you want to scan. There are drones that could do the job decently these days with mm range accuracy. Not as good as those traditional tripods, but they will save Kunos a lot of time.  Still, it is still difficult to judge the quality of the results without looking at the actual data. In surveying, we call it point cloud, a database that is consist of trillions of coordinates of a terrain. The point cloud data is generated via an algorithm that combines all the coordinates into a single massive database in order to create a track where this particular algorithm is what separates a good point cloud from a poor one or a good surveying company from a bad one. Maybe iRacing has good laser scan equipment but their point cloud algorithm is rubbish, which at the the results may be rubbish.   Unless someone does hundreds of laps on that particular track, it is very hard to determine how good is a track's mesh in a game. At the end, for me, laser scan is just bonus because it is an excellent source for reference. The final quality of the track still depends on the track modeller's skill in converting the data into track mesh where there had been cases that developers fucked it all up, like how Forza 5's tracks are still pretty flat despite it is claimed to be laser scanned."
assettocorsa,3dtupp,Cheesenium,0,Mon Jul 20 06:31:50 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that the resulting AC track surface has nowhere near the 2cm resolution.
assettocorsa,3dtupp,MarelliMagneti,0,Mon Jul 20 09:03:58 2015 UTC,"Most of the information is lost in translation. If you've seen an actually extracted AC track, (the invisible driving surface) you will see that it's very low res compared to an rFactor 2 track.  In iRacing you drive on a spline surface and both rF2 and iRacing also add a high resolution microbumps on top."
assettocorsa,3dtupp,MarelliMagneti,7,Mon Jul 20 09:02:56 2015 UTC,"Really shame. Mainly for all the bumps on track which make it more real. Are they just adding more track for console release?   Yes it's free, but that's not the reason. They could sell it for 5â¬ or something. So all free cars are lower quality also? And I don't think it's faster either without laserscan."
assettocorsa,3dtupp,Pascalwb,2,Sun Jul 19 20:33:01 2015 UTC,"Not laserscanning is cheaper, but it will take much longer to build if they want to keep the quality. Longer time is not something they can afford anymore with the console release coming next year. So they have to compromise quality, something the console audience is fine with."
assettocorsa,3dtupp,MarelliMagneti,3,Sun Jul 19 21:00:35 2015 UTC,Yeah sadly theyÂ´ve taken this route..
assettocorsa,3dtupp,barney420,11,Sun Jul 19 21:48:07 2015 UTC,"as long as the quality is still good, no harm is done."
assettocorsa,3dtupp,ExOAte,3,Sun Jul 19 13:45:34 2015 UTC,"Kunos response: It's bought from modder and improved by Kunos. They admit that it was mistake not telling anybody, that it's not scanned.   I think it's ok, better to have Kunos improved mod, than nothing.   But they did big mistake with advertising it as new track, if they said from the start that it's modder created, nobody would be disappointed."
assettocorsa,3dtupp,Pascalwb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:55:22 2015 UTC,"I just wonder when they first knew they were going the route of having a modder make the track for them.    It was first announced in November as releasing ""soon after v1.0"".  So, that would mean they had to have known they were including it before then, maybe even up to a year ago...  That is certainly enough time to build 1 track.  As i recall too, there was a Zandvoort mod being made that suddenly just stopped any progress in November right around when it was announced that the track would be included in the game officially.  I wonder if they scooped up that modder and had him finish the track for them, because i havent seen him since, and he did say that he was going to finish the track anyway, because Kunos version was likely far off.  And his would serve as a fun track while we wait for Kunos version.  All in all, Kunos really should have been up front about this.  They had 8 months to say somehing... anything.  They built this game on laser scanned tracks and the expectation that the tracks we do get, would be laser scanned.  This outrage just feels like people are pissed Kunos is weakening their brand when this was one of the major selling points.  Im sure it will turn out nicely as all their tracks, but knowing it isnt what it should have been, especially on a track with as much camber, elevation changes, and undulating turns as Zandvoort... damn."
assettocorsa,3dtupp,smudi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:17:04 2015 UTC,"Kunos PR is terrible. I think it's cool that they license and finish/polish mod track, but it should have been known from the start.   This was like ""by the way, you know this track you are all waiting for, it's not laser scanned"""

assettocorsa,3dao2r,sdannenberg3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:19:38 2015 UTC,"Rule number 1: always race your own race. Obviously don't dive bomb people or cut anyone off, but don't worry if someone is behind you. If they are faster, they will catch up and pass you. If you are faster, they wont have a chance. Race your own race :)"
assettocorsa,3dao2r,tincanmanrdt,2,Wed Jul 15 01:39:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah thanks, I always find my self concentrating on the car infront of me even if I'm lapping them and braking when they brake so usually they just break late and just fly off the track, and thus so do I too"
assettocorsa,3dao2r,barney420,2,Wed Jul 15 10:07:45 2015 UTC,I learned not to do that when I started playing with real people rather than AIs. Almost every rookie driver brakes ridiculously late when under pressure and end up running wide or off the track. Just stay calm and wait for them to make a mistake.

assettocorsa,3db0bp,smithysjvr,4,Tue Jul 14 21:46:19 2015 UTC,"I love how important the interior becomes in VR, it really impacts how you ""feel"" about driving the car. I also really like how some skins re-skin the interior, can give a car a totally different feeling.  I've always disliked the 458 interior, looks plastic and toy-like, but that car feels great to sit in. Probably something to do with the huge windscreen. The Elise is great as well, and of course the Mclaren GT3!"

assettocorsa,3db0bp,Throw_Datsun,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:34:20 2015 UTC,"I honestly couldn't tell you the costs of either. I'm going with a vive because it is made by Valve/HTC.

I'm still gonna buy that shit, VR is all I have ever wished for what comes to gaming.  From the oculus rifts wikipedia page:  ""This computer should be equipped with a powerful GPU at least equivalent to a NVIDIA GTX 970 or AMD 290, and a CPU at least equivalent to Intel i5-4590""  Now I'm sort of scared since I'm pretty much on minimum hardware they suggest"

It's got a removable top, as opposed to being a full convertable, so you've still got the b-pillars and back window in place.  It felt like a nice compromise."

assettocorsa,3d5wur,russlar,13,Mon Jul 13 22:39:44 2015 UTC,"Much the opposite actually. Everyone is up to speed already, so no one runs the risk of stalling on the start and causing a pileup."
assettocorsa,3d5wur,PetrolHead247,12,Mon Jul 13 23:27:07 2015 UTC,At least make it optional for the host. No reason not to allow it.

assettocorsa,3d5wur,HighRelevancy,2,Tue Jul 14 00:46:53 2015 UTC,You could crash into people before the race starts. I did it before in iRacing.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NGmwjCYTNY
assettocorsa,3d5wur,preliator,10,Tue Jul 14 00:57:14 2015 UTC,And how is that any different to exactly that happening right after the start?

assettocorsa,3d5wur,AR-47,-3,Thu Jul 16 18:28:11 2015 UTC,A mile long content list doesn't really count for much when the sim lacks as much as it does core wise.

After the first visit I found a version for AC so that I could follow the racing better ( makes it hugely more enjoyable, even learnt some new lines ). Can't wait for an official version, it's an amazing track"
assettocorsa,3d5wur,Lupinyonder,4,Mon Jul 13 20:50:18 2015 UTC,Yep. Watching races is infinitely more enjoyable when you know the track and the cars they are driving.

assettocorsa,3d5wur,Intardnation,6,Tue Jul 14 11:50:21 2015 UTC,Laguna and Suzuka are right on top of my which list :-)
assettocorsa,3d5wur,Intardnation,3,Tue Jul 14 14:04:02 2015 UTC,Suzuka is a great track and would be welcomed edition with out question.
assettocorsa,3d5wur,Silencer42,5,Tue Jul 14 17:22:01 2015 UTC,"I hope they will include the long version, because the short one is pretty lame imo...  I guess it will be part of the next DLC?!?  Edit: And we will get the long layout...yeah :D  Also new pics from Kunos visit to the real track"
assettocorsa,3d5wur,iwonderhowlonguserna,4,Mon Jul 13 19:54:36 2015 UTC,No we should get Barcelona first I think.
assettocorsa,3d5wur,CrossBowKill,4,Mon Jul 13 19:57:12 2015 UTC,I don't think they would make such an effort just to scan the short track.
assettocorsa,3d5wur,infinity526,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:00:45 2015 UTC,Maybe. We know sofar that Catalonia is included but only one track would seem a bit less if you take the Nordschleife as DLC counterpart
assettocorsa,3d5wur,Retardeed,5,Mon Jul 13 19:57:54 2015 UTC,"Anything that's being added from the game in the future is DLC, it's downloadable content. Whether it's free or not is questionable, as Assetto Corsa has had, and will continue to have, both free and paid DLC."
assettocorsa,3d5wur,Retardeed,3,Mon Jul 13 20:18:25 2015 UTC,You knew what I mean Ahaha just like in updates and stuff

assettocorsa,3d5wur,Marklar_RR,3,Tue Jul 14 09:59:09 2015 UTC,Yes zanvoort is in free dlc.
assettocorsa,3d5wur,Retardeed,0,Mon Jul 13 21:10:42 2015 UTC,Why the downvote   For not understanding what DLC is.

assettocorsa,3d5wur,Retardeed,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:53:47 2015 UTC,"No, it would be called a free DLC. An update usually comes with bug fixes, new features and sometimes with new content. You have to install it if you want to have up to date version and be able to play online.  Free or paid DLC means additional content which you can install or ignore it."
assettocorsa,3d5wur,bTrixy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:10:34 2015 UTC,"Yeahhh it would still be called free DLC I wasn't saying it wasn't, but like wouldn't it just be in an update through steam if they added some new cars or tracks to the default game?  just dont make sense  because then when people buy the game in a years time they don't have every default track and car so they have to download the new ones"
assettocorsa,3d5wur,Retardeed,0,Wed Jul 15 14:45:08 2015 UTC,When you bought the game there was a track and car list that is included in the price. Everything Kunos brings us after that is something they could charge for. They announced some cars and zandvoort to be a free add on in the near future. That is a gift from the developer to us and something to be grateful for.
assettocorsa,3d5wur,Adequately_Insane,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:08:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, I was asking if all DLC is going to be paid. Just because I remember seeing everyone say that they're gonna be working on it for ages etc..like new cars n shit, but now the bmw m4 or some shit is coming so  that's good and zaandvoort :) not being ungrateful lool people just shooting me down :( just wanted to know if Im gonna get more cars n shit for free"
assettocorsa,3d5wur,-Monolith-,2,Sat Jul 18 11:23:32 2015 UTC,"Watkins Glenn next. Really love that track in PCars, would be great to have it in AC too."
assettocorsa,3d5wur,yesmyfriends,3,Sat Jul 18 12:09:27 2015 UTC,"Is this really news? They announced quite a while ago they're working on a laserscan of the track.   I guess the only news is that it'll be part of the DLC. Which isn't all that surprising either.  Â   I'm more excited about Zandvoort and Catalunya, but the more track the better.   Suzuka would be fantastic. And a laserscanned Monaco would be crazy, even though it'll never happen."
assettocorsa,3d5wur,-Monolith-,9,Tue Jul 14 15:00:03 2015 UTC,"Many here will second Monaco and Suzuka. Many others have also come to know and love Laguna Seca, Bathhurst and Lemans."
assettocorsa,3d5wur,-Monolith-,6,Mon Jul 13 20:16:54 2015 UTC,Oh Bathurst. Bathurst would be amazing too!  Of course there's many more interesting tracks. I could make lists but I'm sure I'd always forget about a cool one.
assettocorsa,3d5wur,Intardnation,4,Mon Jul 13 20:50:24 2015 UTC,Because the track only exists for one week a year and for the time it's setup it is either used to race on or people walk around on it.
assettocorsa,3d5wur,TNTCLRAPE,3,Mon Jul 13 21:03:12 2015 UTC,Laguna is one of my most faves.
assettocorsa,3d5wur,Ctushik,4,Mon Jul 13 21:09:23 2015 UTC,"Same, back when I was a young'n I abhorred that track in Gran Turismo 2, but I eventually got a weird, Stockholm Syndrome-esque love for it after having to practice going down that damn corkscrew in a Toyota GT-One TSO20 so many times to qualify for a license.  Edit: I think I saw a user made version of Laguna Seca at one point for Assetto, has anyone raced it/is it pretty good?"
assettocorsa,3d5wur,Intardnation,4,Tue Jul 14 11:52:03 2015 UTC,"There's a couple of versions floating around, but neither is very good. Strange since it's such a popular track."
assettocorsa,3d5wur,eobet,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:19:14 2015 UTC,I just downloaded it last nigh and had a lap - seems decent enough so far but I havent scrutinized it though.  Same - arcade racer where laguna was always hell but watching racing I learned to love the track and now I find if I am racing it is a must to get if possible.
assettocorsa,3d5wur,-Monolith-,5,Tue Jul 14 14:10:28 2015 UTC,"Look at where it was posted and who posted it. Yes it is news because that's probably not a random post, he (or a Kunos employee) probably took the photo while being there laser scanning the thing. We are witnessing progress."
assettocorsa,3d5wur,smudi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:20:59 2015 UTC,"They mentioned it before. I already knew they were going to laserscan it. I THINK I've seen the same picture with the announcement before too.  Either way, yeah I hope him mentioning it again means they're scanning it right now or are even further than that.   Just don't think I'm one of these overly negative guys. Basically I was just wondering why this is treated like a completely newly announced track. I'm glad to see progress too."
assettocorsa,3d5wur,baconatedwaffle,5,Mon Jul 13 20:44:51 2015 UTC,"You havent seen this picture before because it was taken yesterday... while Marco, Aris, and Simone were at Brands.  They scanned the track yesterday :p  This is what the post is about.    It was technically announced back in November 2014 that Brands Hatch was coming to AC, and then a few months later they announced it was coming some time in 2015.   Zandvoort is up this month according to Kunos.  Catalunya is sometime soontm in the 2nd dlc pack, and brands will be god knows when because if they are just scanning it... it's a hell of a long way off :p"
assettocorsa,3d5wur,pexeq,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:55:49 2015 UTC,"why couldn't Monaco happen?  I understand the difficulty in scanning tracks an ocean away like Bathurst and Laguna Seca, but Monaco is practically next door to Italy"
assettocorsa,3d5wur,smudi,6,Tue Jul 14 10:20:45 2015 UTC,Because Monaco isn't a permanent track I guess.
assettocorsa,3d5wur,MapleHamwich,3,Mon Jul 13 20:58:57 2015 UTC,"The city streets of Monaco are permanent :p  I think the issue would be licensing fees just like anything else.  As well as prince albert not taking kindly to anyone using the Monaco name when referring to the track in commercial products without paying a huge fee.    The track would be easy enough to reproduce accurately, and the armco could be added from the plethora of pics online."
