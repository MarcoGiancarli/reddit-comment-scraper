Unorthodog,3dmxkw,EasyFunMoney,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:45:26 2015 UTC,"I think that dog might have a broken baculum (penis bone)â€”yes, dogs have bones in their penises. Take him to the vet.  Another possibility is that, because you interrupted them, the dog did not ejaculate and thus his penis could not return to it's flaccid state (that would take around 30 minutes).  You should not punish them for doing what comes natural to them. I also found it particularly poignant how you just blamed the male and did not try to help them at all. You should've kept them still and calm while you called a vet."
