dogs,3e2l2t,deianara_crush,89,Tue Jul 21 13:54:33 2015 UTC,"I think you should take advantage of the pretty nice offer from your breeder to watch him sometimes, and supplement that with boarding from your own pocket. You made a commitment when you got this puppy, I think you owe it to him to at least give it a shot. If after a few months it's really not working out financially or you end up hardly seeing him...then it's time to talk to your breeder about returning him. But why not try first?"
dogs,3e2l2t,fwizard226,19,Tue Jul 21 14:01:20 2015 UTC,Thank you. This is what I was hoping I would hear. I definitely want to give it a try - I just love him so much and would absolutely hate giving him up.
dogs,3e2l2t,TacticalVulpix,9,Tue Jul 21 15:31:17 2015 UTC,"You're in a very good situation where you have support from the breeder! You picked well. I agree with the other poster, take up on the offer for now, but don't abuse it. Look at neighbours/family to help out if you can; but ultimately accept that you may have to give him back. Since he's going back to the breeder, you don't have to worry about his welfare! He will be looked after."
dogs,3e2l2t,PacificNW0119,12,Tue Jul 21 15:44:59 2015 UTC,I agree. Another option is you can ask your breeder if they know any one who would adopt him. They could possible call families that were interested in her litter but they were all adopted before they contacted her. If you trust your breeder to pick a good home for your dog ask if they would be able to interview and find a potential home?
dogs,3e2l2t,bitchesaintshirt,13,Tue Jul 21 19:52:17 2015 UTC,"You're being pretty harsh. OP got stuck in a bad situation and is trying to make it work, how is that ""fucking disgusting""?"
dogs,3e2l2t,ZefAntwoord,-11,Tue Jul 21 17:15:15 2015 UTC,"The level of vitriol in your comment is excessive, even speaking as someone who loves and cares about animals deeply. Don't be so judgemental - I doubt you know the situation better than we do. She adopted a puppy, not a child.   Besides, pet ownership isn't some hoity toity elitist club where only the most researched, effective pet ownership is allowed to stay. Clearly the concept of responsibility for animals you adop has really developed in the last century with animal welfare legislation and organizations, and ideally all people would only adopt entirely responsibly, with entirely sufficient resources and perfect plans. But that's not how real life works. As long as someone's heart is in the right place and they're well versed in the basics of caring for an animal (regular vet visits, don't let it roam outside, feed it a healthy diet, keep it out of danger), it is absurd to tear them apart like this."

dogs,3e2l2t,Aryada,7,Tue Jul 21 18:09:35 2015 UTC,"Boarding is fucking awful. Don't do it.  Edit: what do I know, I've only worked at 4"
dogs,3e2l2t,fwizard226,3,Tue Jul 21 17:30:16 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty broad sweeping statement to make. By all means, be selective about the boarding facility you use and do your due diligence visiting them and asking questions, but plenty of dogs do fine in boarding. And if it makes the difference between giving a dog up and keeping it, I don't think boarding them in a good facility once in a while is that ""fucking awful."""
dogs,3e2l2t,Aryada,3,Tue Jul 21 17:38:13 2015 UTC,You're right. But fancy boarding facilities are pricey. I would never suggest anyone board an animal at a vet's office. They are let out twice a day (7am and 3pm at my last job) and hate life.
dogs,3e2l2t,QuintupleTheFun,3,Tue Jul 21 17:06:53 2015 UTC,"My dog LOVES the time she spends at Camp Bow Wow, which is a national franchise. They have webcams where I can watch her when I miss her (which, let's face it, is all the time). Kennel-type boarding at a vet, as you mentioned below, is definitely not something I'd do....but a place like Camp would have my trust."
dogs,3e2l2t,iNeedAValidUserName,2,Tue Jul 21 17:13:00 2015 UTC,"This is an eventuality me and /u/orangetangerine Discussed before we ever got Cherry. It's a crummy situation for all parties involved, and it's a time where rash decisions are typically made so I'm glad you're trying to find the best solution.  Ultimately, I think /u/fwizard226 is absolutely right in this case. Your breeder has given you a great option and you should take them up on that, they don't want you to fail anymore than you want to. If you fail, it'll behoove the breeder to know your dog as well as you do so they can find it an appropriate home.  Traveling aside you do have other things to consider. Dogs are a big commitment - not as large as kids but still a VERY large comitment that can hinder your social advancement in your career. Going out for a night of drinks with coworkers, potential clients, or networking events can run afoul of taking care of your dog.  I can never state that as eloquently as /u/orangetangerine can - but make sure you take that into consideration moving forward. /u/Blahblahblah2063 suggested:    Find a nice family that will take good care of him where you can visit from time to time to check up on him. Get a boyfriend that will help you out :)    And while it sounds like a brilliant idea, I can't stress enough how much I disagree with these points. I like the idea of the first I quoted, but ultimately that's up to the breeder to do, especially if you signed a contract I'd bet it was part of it. The second idea just leads back to where you are now.  If you had a kid you wouldn't get a boyfriend to help take care of it. If you're a decent person you probably wouldn't even introduce your child to a SO in any serious way until you KNEW they'd be part of your life for a long time to come. I do like /u/wiseasian220 's suggestion of looking at rover - which is more akin to finding a reliable Nanny - or day care - though.    Ultimately, I think you can make this work, but you'll have to give up more than you intially planned to do it. To that end, I don't think anyone here can tell you what's right for YOU. Take some time to think about it and all the great suggestions people here on /r/dogs will give you and decide for yourself if the sacrifices are worth having a dog - a life long companion - not the cute puppy you currently have."
dogs,3e2l2t,iNeedAValidUserName,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:18 2015 UTC,"thank you for your response! I really appreciate this advice.   I will definitely be calling my breeder to talk about my situation and to see if we can continue the arrangement we currently have going, only more frequently. I will also be asking her for advice on this as well.   I am fully aware of the full commitment I've made to this dog and I honestly prefer spending nights at home with him more than I do  going out for drinks. Luckily, my job doesn't entail too much networking/socializing outside of work hours.   I will definitely be looking into Rover as well.   Thank you again so much for your advice! /u/wiseasian220 and /u/fwizard as well! I've been fretting so much over what to, this really puts my mind at ease."
dogs,3e2l2t,orangetangerine,12,Tue Jul 21 23:04:25 2015 UTC,"I am fully aware of the full commitment I've made to this dog and I honestly prefer spending nights at home with him more than I do going out for drinks. Luckily, my job doesn't entail too much networking/socializing outside of work hours.   I agree with you on this point, and really hoping my other half, /u/orangetangerine  will jump in and comment.  I strongly agree with you, and while my job doesn't require me to go out and socialize, I know that networking by doing so can SERIOUSLY benefit my career - by giving me opportunities for advancement and increasing the circle of 'who I know' which can play a MAJOR role in getting new jobs/opportunities.  'who I know' is actually how I got my current job - or rather who orange knew. It's a weird thing to consider, and like I said it's all about what you want and how you plan to make your life work.  Single parents manage to make THAT work, so I'm sure you can make THIS work - it's all about how much you're willing to sacrifice and dedicate to the cause. I only even bring this all up because of how young the OP makes you sound - you still have a lot of advancements to make and the elbow rubbing typically doesn't hurt and only helps."
dogs,3e2l2t,iNeedAValidUserName,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:34:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think /u/iNeedAValidUserName probably said it better than I could.  Definitely ask your breeder about what to do - she sounds like a good one.  She sounds good enough with the support she's given you so far that if you had to rehome your pup even at an adult age, I'd be confident that the breeder would able to utilize her network to find a good placement for your dog.  Your pup will hopefully be mellowing out (or reaching max craziness soon, then mellowing out) at his age right now.  Labs aren't easy, but they aren't ""easily broken"" and you can make a few mistakes raising them with them still coming out excellent.  It sounds like you have done a great job so far.  As long as you spend a lot of time with your dog in the off-hours and maybe take up a dog hobby to help you guys bond (a dog sport casually, trick training, maybe a one-off training class or workshop) he will have a better life than a lot of dogs out there.  We board our dog or take her to daycare at a place where everyone knows her name, and had at one point hired her an awesome dog walker while she was young, and had longer commutes when she was growing up, and ours came out pretty well.  If you combine Rover, your breeder's offer, and reaching out to friends (with compensation in money or favor trading), in addition to spending a lot of time with him when you are home, you probably can keep your dog's life pretty regular.  I'd try it out for a few months to see if he's the type of dog that will take to this kind of schedule.  /u/iNeedAValidUserName is right though - dogs do take up a lot of time.  I know I certainly couldn't do it without him as well as we do it now while living in the city - I mean, I could, but a lot of things would probably fall through in terms of having to compromise on housing and other opportunities.  As much as you love your job now, if you plan on keeping the dog, you will have to put a little more work into keeping your lifestyle varied depending on your other hobbies and career interests.  It can be done!  While it might be a little bit of a sacrifice at first, your life doesn't completely have to be about your dog while still giving him a good life.  We can still do stuff like hang out with friends, go out without the pup, go to career development workshops, even rent in a desirable dog-friendly unit with some smart thinking, pre-planning and scheduling (mainly fulfillment of the dog's exercise requirements).  The fact that you're here and keeping a level head about this situation and you are here asking for resources kinda tells me that you are more than capable of being able to do it.  Don't be too discouraged - crowdsource, reach out to your social networks, see what's around and who can help you out, and try it out for a few months.  Don't be afraid to say it's too much and try something else, but don't be afraid to make a good stand in juggling your pup and your life.  I have faith you'll work something out."

You'd have to make sure they're okay with puppies of course but perhaps it's an option you could look into.   Sometimes we have friends look after our dog when we go out on weekends so maybe you have some that wouldn't mind dog-sitting every now and then? Just a few thoughts."

dogs,3e2l2t,ugottahvbluhair,7,Tue Jul 21 15:27:22 2015 UTC,Exactly. You can't rely on friends and breeder's help two years down the road. Can you afford to keep him if that help drops away?
dogs,3e2l2t,nkdeck07,3,Tue Jul 21 14:48:26 2015 UTC,"I do worry about the aspect of lots of different caregivers for the pup. It strikes me that this will either culminate in a very easy-going pup who gets along with lots of different people OR a possibility for some reaction from him--including behavioral issues.  I'm not suggesting you give up the dog, because I am also of the mind that a dog is as precious and vulnerable as a child. I am suggesting that your daycare providers are long-term, consistent, and all agreeing to use the same training methods that you've already instilled. I would also argue that you should stay away from 'all day play' dog centers. Those can be incredibly traumatizing for dogs, especially since no one likes to 'play all day'. We like structure and work, and so do dogs.  Except greyhounds. Greyhounds do not like to do anything but eat, sleep, and do zoomies in the backyard for three minutes, tops."
dogs,3e2l2t,ugottahvbluhair,3,Tue Jul 21 15:32:33 2015 UTC,I'd speak to the ex and see if he can help supplement the boarding costs when you are traveling. Both of you made a commitment to this animal and need to right by him.  If that's not an option boarding isn't a bad idea. The doggie daycare style places are great if you have a dog loving dog.
dogs,3e2l2t,IStillNeedaSong,7,Tue Jul 21 15:36:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's really the ex's responsibility to help pay for boarding. It sounds like she got the dog and is the full owner.

dogs,3e2l2t,rebecca0nline,3,Tue Jul 21 16:12:14 2015 UTC,Just realized I confused the first and second part of my sentence. I meant to write having the ex supplement the boarding by watching him at her place when she is traveling.

We were not on good terms after that.   Always be careful about who cares for your pup! It could be a lot worse than just neglect when hurt feelings are involved.
dogs,3e2l2t,nirad,3,Tue Jul 21 16:14:42 2015 UTC,Do you have any friends or acquaintances who would be willing to stay at your place while you're away and take care of the dog? Perhaps someone who could use a little extra cash?
dogs,3e346z,AsSubtleAsABrick,13,Tue Jul 21 16:19:57 2015 UTC,"i've never used treats to train loose leash walking. i'm also not a fan of the ""sit and wait"" response to pulling. i've had consistent success with turning around every time the dog pulls.  the dog is pulling because 1] they're not at all focused on the person, and 2] they're desperate to get to wherever they want to go. turning around every time the dog pulls 1] forces the dog to start paying attention to you because you've become unpredictable, 2] makes them realize that pulling is not going to get them to where they want to go. it's a better tactic than the ""sit and wait"" because it keeps them moving [so at least they're getting some exercise] and just redirects their energy instead of trying to STOP their energy, which is a much easier battle to fight when you're dealing with a dog who is exactly 0% interested in paying attention to you."
dogs,3e346z,_ataraxia,11,Tue Jul 21 16:48:32 2015 UTC,Turning around works pretty well on my dog too. Any time she starts to get ahead and pull I turn around and keep walking. After a few quick turns she starts looking to me to see where I'm going next which is what you want. Doesn't work every time but it definitely helps.
dogs,3e346z,ugottahvbluhair,3,Tue Jul 21 18:07:12 2015 UTC,"Definitely look into front clasp harnesses! At the very least it won't allow the dog to self-reinforce the undesired behavior (pulling).   It's fairly normal for dogs not to be food motivated when there's better things going on outside. Your options are basically to find a reward that is higher that outside distractions or make food a higher reward in itself. Are you walking him before or after he eats his meals? You could implement a ""nothing in life is free"" rule. This training style is implemented a lot by law enforcement and detection dogs. You work for your food. I don't necessarily agree with taking this method to the extreme, but their are ways you can modify it for a pet dog. You walk him before he eats so that he's hungry and the food itself is a higher value reward. He's working for his meals, and the better behaved he is, the quicker he gets his breakfast. Try that for a day or two, only train when he's hungry and see how that goes.  You can also find a higher value reward. Dutchies are usually pretty toy driven. Does he like to tug? Retrieve?"
dogs,3e346z,court67,3,Tue Jul 21 16:39:35 2015 UTC,"He goes out largely before eating. He goes out once in the morning before breakfast, once around lunch with a dog walker, once when we get home before dinner, and once after dinner before bed. That is minimum, sometimes more.  He likes to tug. We found a kind of bone he likes to chew on. He is decent at retrieving while inside, in the dog park he might chase it for a bit but then ultimately doesn't care.  I'm not really sure how to reward him with a toy on a walk though since I'll have to be carrying it the whole time."
dogs,3e346z,court67,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:45 2015 UTC,"Ok if he's not food motivated even when he's hungry then that's probably not the route you want to go.   If you're going to reward him with a tug then yes, you're going to have to carry it. Is that a problem? You're already carrying treats, right?"
dogs,3e346z,court67,5,Tue Jul 21 16:53:58 2015 UTC,"I don't mind carrying it. Knowing him though, if it does work, he will only pay attention when I actually have it. When I don't have it I feel like he will continue the behavior."
dogs,3e346z,PBandJames,4,Tue Jul 21 17:02:34 2015 UTC,"That's where variable reinforcement comes into play and hiding the reward. At first he needs the predictability of knowing if he stays by you, then he gets the reward. That connection needs to be very firmly etched in his brain before you ever start varying the reinforcement. Once he fully understands that, you can wait longer and longer to issue the reward. Now instead of getting rewarded for walking by your side for a full second, you need 3 seconds, then 5 seconds, etc. You build up the criteria until he needs to go an entire walk before getting rewarded at the end for behaving nicely.   It's also important to mention that he may not be getting enough exercise to begin with. A Dutch shepherd with 3 walks a day? Yikes! My GSD wouldn't give me a lick of attention if I was underestimating his needs that much. You need to set him up for success and a tired dog is much more likely to want to walk next to you. Right now, he probably couldn't care less about you because he has so much energy!"
dogs,3e346z,letsdothis77,2,Tue Jul 21 17:10:11 2015 UTC,"Is this an issue of loose leash walking, leash reactivity, or both?  I'll also concur and increasing treat value is good.  Leftover meat or cheese work really well."
dogs,3e346z,kerrington83,4,Tue Jul 21 16:56:21 2015 UTC,Both.
dogs,3e346z,letsdothis77,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:03:01 2015 UTC,"I had a puller as well, and we tried a few different things that had varying degrees of success:   We got a no-pull harness, and that made about a 30% difference. It didn't stop the behavior, but it gave me more control and definitely helped reduce it. We also used the methods you are employing of stopping as soon as he pulls and applying pressure until he relents. Again, limited success. We went on this way for about 8 months with varying levels of success, but never feeling as if we truly ""corrected"" the behavior. The only thing that has eliminated the pulling entirely was a week of day school training where he was taught to heel. The trainer we work with recommended the use of a pinch collar, which I initially hated the thought of but have since come around to. Rosco now heels on command and walks beautifully with a loose leash. When given his ""break"" command to be let loose from the heel, he'll wander to the end of his leash but rarely pulls anymore.     The thing that I really think makes the difference is keeping Rosco engaged on listening to me and staying by my side during walks. He used to be wildly distracted, which led to him pulling every which way so he could chase down whatever caught his attention. By keeping him focused on his training, he is able to ignore these distractions and keep a loose, even heel. It's been a lifesaver."
dogs,3e346z,kerrington83,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:39 2015 UTC,"The UK is very anti pinch collars, please read this before using one. To be honest, you might as well kick the dog until it obeys. I personally consider their use to be abusive.

dogs,3e346z,asire_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:21:00 2015 UTC,"I know I'll most likely get downvoted a lot in this sub for admitting to using a pinch collar, but please know that this isn't a decision we made lightly or without significant research. I know that they are not recommended for many dogs and there is potential for damage. We are responsible in our usage of the pinch collar (he never wears it at home, in the car, or on a long lead where it could get caught and potentially injure him).   We spent a lot of time and money on training our dog and worked exclusively with a positive reinforcement trainer for over a year with very limited success. If you look at my posting history, you'll see my comments about committing to clicker training and actively socializing our dog. Hopefully you'll also see these as the comments of a woman who adores her dog, spoils him, and only wants to see him happy and healthy. Despite all of this work, time, and money I was still in situations where I felt out of control of my dog.   We spent several weeks getting to know this trainer, attending classes with him, and watching his interactions with many dogs besides our own before we chose to entrust Rosco to him. He does not subscribe to dominance theory. He uses the pinch collar as I described above - to keep the attention of a dog that is easily distracted and to help him with impulse control. This is combined with positive reinforcement to guide the dog in good decisions and correct behavior, which are rewarded. The collar isn't a punishment - it is a reminder that his attention should be on me. And, we have had great success with this.  My dog loves his trainer. He shows zero signs of fear when with him or near him and willingly goes to him for pets and love. He gets excited when I pull his collar out, as he knows that means he's going for a walk. Again, I know this isn't for everyone, but I feel confident in our due diligence and knowing that we made the choice that was right for our dog.   I do appreciate the link and your very respectful approach to presenting an alternate opinion."
dogs,3e346z,kerrington83,2,Tue Jul 21 18:28:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you for responding positively and not just downvoting me. I am in no way dissing everyone who has used them, I am speaking from my perspective. I would also like to say - I grew up with 3 dogs (at different times) and my dads family owned farms and had working collies. My dad also worked with police dog trainers (he was the victim who ran away during training) and was allowed to take both our GSDs to the police dog agility training and some of their scent work. We were pretty experienced dog trainers as a family. However, despite all this experience when our second GSD hit 2 he became an absolute nightmare. He was very close to being put down after he went for (and almost got) someone at our Rugby club in front of a couple of policemen. Eventually, he went through police dog training for aggressive dogs. Although I don't know the details, I can assure you it was NOT positive training. I do not think they would do that kind of training these days (it was 12/13 years ago). Duke the Dude lived to be 13. I know that there are circumstances and reasons. I just don't think tools like these or shock collars should be used or recommended as normal training tools. They should NEVER be long term options. Even the AKC seem to agree with that. As I have said police dog trainers, vets and behaviourists here wouldn't touch them. We are a completely different country. My Swedish friends were HORRIFIED that I had crate trained my dog as a puppy, crate are banished over there. I totally understand why, but feel I used the crate responsibly. I maybe wouldn't use it next time after speaking with them."
dogs,3e346z,court67,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:18:22 2015 UTC,It's nothing like kicking a dog.  Have you ever felt one?  I've put one on my arm and it's not painful.  It's uncomfortable.
dogs,3e346z,letsdothis77,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:42:43 2015 UTC,"I feel bad about posting this. I really don't like prong collars, but I recognise that you were doing what a professional told you to do. Taking the emotion out of it you have to remember that dogs pull on leash for a variety of reason, many of these normal - if they see a family member or even just to approach another dog or person (this is normal behavior if they do it in a controlled way). By using a prong collar, the dog feels pain and they connect the pain with the other dog or person. This can and has lead to dogs being aggressive and fearful. By using these types of collars to deal with one problem you can very easily introduce another."
dogs,3e346z,court67,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:39:29 2015 UTC,"Under the guidance of a professional, it is unlikely that they were timing their corrections so I effectively that it could cause aggression. I agree that a prong is not the best solution for a reactive dog, but they're certainly not torture either when used properly. It could be argued that every loose leash walking tool causes pain. A head halter puts a lot of pressure on a very sensitive part of the dog's face. A front clasping harness can rub and negatively affect the dog's gait. Hell, just straining against a collar is painful! So while I don't recommend one in this situation, the situation that you replied to was totally reasonable. Different dogs have different thresholds for what they feel is painful. Prongs can be effective tools, I just wouldn't recommend them to an inexperienced owner unless they're taught to properly fit it and use it by a professional."
dogs,3e346z,kerrington83,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:44:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with your points! We use the pinch collar under instruction of a professional who provided guidance and direction. I would never recommend someone just buy one from PetSmart and slap it on their dog, as we definitely experienced a learning curve with using it appropriately."

Some rescues have gone completely bat shit and have requirements so insane that unless you are independently wealthy there's no way you could ever meet them.  Your hours sound find, it's mostly specific rescues have gone off the rails and are almost impossible to work with. If you are interested in a grey hound I'd look at greyhound specific rescues and mention you'd be interested in a pair. They might be a lot more willing to work with you"
dogs,3e2iaq,nkdeck07,2,Tue Jul 21 14:41:12 2015 UTC,"We adopted a dog once where the agency put us through the ringer, too.  They actually called and interviewed every contact we listed on the form, checked all our info, etc etc, and in the end still adopted to us a dog that was clearly a bad fit.  We were living in an apartment, busy work hours, etc.  The dog was ultra-high energy and could not handle being crated for extended periods during the day and would regularly destroy/escape the crate and do similar damage to the rest of the apartment.  She clearly needed a larger home, a yard to run around in for most of the day, etc.  Kinda feels like their extended interview process was just airport security and wasn't actually accomplishing what it claimed to."
dogs,3e2iaq,thepensivepoet,6,Tue Jul 21 19:13:27 2015 UTC,I think I'll be browsing the local pound and some smaller rescue places to find the dog for me.

Some intense exercise in the morning ought to be enough for them to nap while you're at work. Obviously you wouldn't want to get a puppy."
dogs,3e2iaq,nkdeck07,18,Tue Jul 21 16:55:42 2015 UTC,"You are correct, greyhounds are just a bit unique as most of the rescues are retired racing greyhounds that grew up in a kennel environment and transition to being a pet better if they have another greyhound buddy."
dogs,3e2iaq,llaaadyel,16,Tue Jul 21 17:09:17 2015 UTC,I think that greyhounds are a great rescue whether alone or a pair.  Ive had both.  Greyhounds like to go for a walk once a day or better yet to a field that is fenced and let run for 10 to 15 minutes.  After that they are basically couch potatoes.  They are generally not the sharpest tool in the shed but they are loyal and loving.  Most post racing greyhounds transition very well from crate training to housebroken.   They have a few traits that owners should be aware but there are a few really good adopting a racing greyhound books out there that will get you up to speed quickly.  I would see no issue whatsoever with your schedule especially since you have someone to look in during the lunch hour.

On average, a lab or golden is going to be more clingy and friendly than other breeds. But the biggest difference between them and your shepherd/Mal is that they're going to be that way to everyone. My shepherds fairly attached to me too, but most labs I train feel that way about every person they meet. Of course, dogs are individuals so this won't be true for every single lab and golden, but on average, you can expect a very handler focused, friendly dog."

dogs,3e28zn,ImMufasa,4,Tue Jul 21 19:48:50 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard that about goldens specifically, but temperament is pretty linked to genetics so it doesn't necessarily surprise me. The popularity of German Shepherds has led to a lot of nervous, unstable dogs that you don't see coming out of well-bred lines at all. The same thing supposedly happened to cockers after lady and the tramp. But you're right, 99% of that can be avoided entirely by careful breeding."

Two years ago when I started looking for a breeder I was originally planning to get a GSD since I loved the breed but I couldn't find good breeders in my area. Then for whatever reason the sloped back has somehow become a desirable trait.. So instead I got a Groenendael Belgian Shepherd and couldn't be happier.

dogs,3e28zn,ImMufasa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:01:27 2015 UTC,"It's important to point out that the slope isn't the problem. When you stack a GSD no matter what lines it comes from, it should have a slope. It's the severe rear angulation that's the problem- that's what causes them to literally look crippled. Working line breeders don't value that, so the breed isn't totally done for. Just much harder to find people breeding for structure. Groenendael are a very nice choice though."

However, my boyfriend's dog is really mouthy and has a bad habit or picking up shoes and slippers in his mouth when he wants attention or when he gets overly excited.

He is friendly, but I'd also describe him as being somewhat aloof. He loves meeting new people, and is exceptionally excited for his humans, but this fades quickly and he'll wander off to find some place to lie down.   He will regularly want to be in the same room as us, or at least be able to see us. He may follow us to the bathroom, but as soon as he sees you there, he'll usually leave you alone or wait at the door. Mostly, he just wants to know where you are.   Sometimes, rarely, he'll curl up at our feet if we're working from home.  He's pretty trainable, though a bit stubborn. Highly food motivated. Sweety and cute. But doesn't retrieve or fetch, and sometimes seems a bit a loner.  He does not much care for other dogs, though he's fine in their presence. He just seems baffled and sometimes perturbed when they only want to play with him. He's more into humans, and even then he may be a bit spacey.  I love this freaking dog.  http://imgur.com/O0DZmL8"
dogs,3e28zn,RuskiesInTheWarRoom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:34:23 2015 UTC,"As with any breed, really depends on the individual temperament of the dog itself.  My last childhood dog, before I left for college, was half golden retriever, half black lab. Both of her parents had papers showing purebred lineage...  ...however...  Our dog was the most opposite of her breeds that I'd ever seen or heard of. She was bad with kids (she bit me when I was 8, within the first year of owning her because I went to pet her while she had a bone near her; even as she got older, she would nip at my friends if they came too close to her too fast, and nipped at my baby nephew when he was less than a year old), hated other dogs (would run and hide, then actually bit my uncle's dog when he cornered her... and all he wanted to do was play!), and she was anxious around cats and other small animals. And I don't blame my parents for this whatsoever, as we'd had plenty of dogs before her and none had issues like she did.  She was a gorgeous dog, but wasn't the friendly, kind, gentle animal that everyone expects from either labs or retrievers."

My GSD/Retriever (as far as the vet can tell) pup is almost five months old now and starting to come into his personality. Everyone who meets him tells us how calm he is, and how he doesn't act like a puppy at all. He is inquisitive with strangers and instantly best friends with any new dog. We're still working on socializing him with children because they freak him out a little at first. Tiny humans are scary!  He started out as a velcro dog but has learned that his humans won't disappear if he hangs out on the other side of the room (with us still in sight, of course). We've had no issues with separation anxiety and he loves his crate despite spending up to 4 hours in it while we're both away during the day. Housebreaking him has been a breeze. The whole month we've had him he's only had 4 accidents and I trust him completely now. He's scary smart and will pick up on tricks lightning fast, and loves showing them off to people. I've never met a dog who was so eager to learn!  I don't know if these traits/personality are due to his GSD or Retriever parentage but I really lucked out with my boy."

They were both biddable and well behaved, despite inconsistent training methods. They never really bonded with a single person in our house, they seemed to like everyone equally. They were diplomatic and didn't play favorites. We had to vacuum daily due to the shedding. I would definitely consider getting a golden again in the future."

He wants to be constantly petted and touched, 10/10 on a clingy scale. He is very attached to me, follows me around, is incredibly excited when I come home, and is very jealous when I show other dogs affection. If I pet my other rod (Rocko), Tank will come up and butt in and expect to be petted as well. If they are both laying there about to fall asleep, he makes sure he lays in a way where he can see Rocko and see if I'm petting Rocko. If I do, I have to pet both of them. If he hears me talking to Rocko, he will come from another room and make sure he's included. He always sleeps with me, and once he's woken up he will hang out in the bedroom until I wake up too (I sleep in late on weekends) instead of roaming the house. He is not like this with everyone, including my boyfriend, only me. But he IS very friendly with everyone. He loves being petted and loves anyone who will give him attention.  Rocko is generally a lazy dog, but he's very friendly and loves to greet people and say hi and be petted. He's not jealous at all and when tank is being annoying he just leaves me be. But he does love sleeping with me and love his ears rubbed. He doesn't LOVE cuddling but he lays at my feet (always touching them) while I watch TV and occasionally comes up for a head rub and to say hi.  Out of the two, I think goldens are my favorite breed.

dogs,3e2leb,court67,7,Tue Jul 21 14:04:41 2015 UTC,"This depends heavily on if they have prey drive vs. chase drive, and how sensitive they are. My dog has very high chase drive; any time something runs from her, she goes on full alert and is ready to go after them. But she never moves past the chase stage. The few times she's gotten close enough to something to go in for the kill, she gets super confused and backs off (often tripping herself in the process).   She's also a huge baby. I'll send her after a stray cat, and she'll huff and bark and ruff up running up to them, but if they don't run, she stops, and then starts doing appeasement behaviors (avoiding contact, licking her lips), turns around, and walks away. If they raise a paw or hiss at her, she's out of there in a flash.  Not saying OP should try it, if it's true prey drive and not chase drive, and the dog doesn't have a healthy fear of cats, then honestly I would question why they thought moving in was a good idea in the first place."

When I found my SIL's dog (Catahoula mix) mauling one of my goats at 6:30am (goat was soon fine with fast-healing injuries), my dog was just standing outside the pen confusedly barking. When he's gotten close to my chickens (who free-range) after chasing them (which I'm training him not to) he just sorta looks baffled and runs away. I think he wants nothing more than to move things from Point A to Point B but doesn't want to kill necessarily. That said I'm never just going to trust him to hang out with my livestock with no guidance. My SIL's dog is a wonderful dog who loves all people, kids, and smaller dogs, but it made me realize that he has a very quiet, sneaky prey drive and we can never leave him alone with any livestock or smaller non-dog animals or babies."

dogs,3e2leb,mysled,2,Tue Jul 21 18:41:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that your dog is the norm... Chase drive is generally a result of prey drive. They're chasing the furry object because instinct is telling them to catch it and kill it. I would absolutely not rely on a dog stopping themselves once they've caught their ""prey"". To me that sounds like a dog that doesn't actually have high prey drive or chase drive. If OP is accurate about how driven their dog is, then this is a dead cat in the making. I would definitely not recommend they test it out and see if their dog will actually kill the cat when they catch it."
dogs,3e2leb,court67,4,Tue Jul 21 16:56:59 2015 UTC,"I could be misunderstanding, I suppose, but at the same time don't most herding breeds operate on a high level of prey drive without ever going in for the kill?"
dogs,3e2leb,mysled,0,Tue Jul 21 17:02:43 2015 UTC,"Herding breeds aren't herding cats though. Sheep aren't actually prey, that prey drive has transformed into a pretty solid herding drive. They have no desire to kill the sheep, they desperately want to move them though. They're not chasing, they're controlling. Compare that to a terrier breed to hunt small game. Those dogs are 100% in it for the kill."
dogs,3e2leb,court67,2,Tue Jul 21 17:06:01 2015 UTC,Does using the phrase movement fixation instead of chase drive help? A dog can still be obsessed with chasing things without having a true prey drive. That's all I was trying to clarify. Some dogs will chase cats (or any other animal) simply because they will run from them and it's fun.
dogs,3e2leb,mysled,5,Tue Jul 21 17:16:29 2015 UTC,"I was wondering the same thing. My dog will chase anything that runs from him, even people. His sole purpose in doing it is to first out-run whatever is running and then turn around and lick it. For him it's all about winning the race and giving kisses (even if you don't want kisses- ). The only exception is if whatever he is chasing is close to his size, then he will hump it (while licking it)."
dogs,3e2leb,missy070203,9,Tue Jul 21 17:52:57 2015 UTC,"Sure, movement fixation is probably a more accurate term but it can still go south just as fast. A dog that chases cats is a dog that does not ever have access to cats in my book."
dogs,3e2leb,court67,6,Tue Jul 21 17:21:18 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. I'm sure my pup's not the norm, but even as an ACD mix, it's possible. But I waited until I knew her extremely well to introduce her to cats, and even now if she were to meet a cat that just ran from her, I wouldn't leave her alone with it. Most of the cats she interacts with now are strays that know how to stand up for themselves, so I'm more worried about her getting beat on than I am about the cats."
dogs,3e2leb,mysled,3,Tue Jul 21 17:34:36 2015 UTC,"Herding behavior is truncated prey drive, yes.  Prey drive is a sequence of behaviors and herding stops at stalk/chase.  When herding, dogs never flip to the next sequence of predatory behavior.  Unfortunately, some herding dogs also make great ratters!  It really depends on the dog whether they can chase a small animal and not kill it when they're done, even if they're exceptional herders.    My dog has literally run over ducks and nudged them to their feet to get them moving again.  I would trust him to never intentionally kill an animal even after chasing it down.  To say he lacks chase drive as /u/court67 suggested would just be a blatantly false statement, but he absolutely lacks prey drive."

It sounds like you're on the right track: separate when you're not home and muzzle when interacting with the cats. I would stick to that. Maybe, eventually, they'll get along but I wouldn't bet on it."
dogs,3e2leb,rvtjess,7,Tue Jul 21 14:20:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you've said 100%. Cats can be unpredictable and get spooked or just get a wild hair and decide to run from one area to another and spark the prey drive in the dog. It isn't worth it.  Your presence isn't enough to deter it, and an accident can take a fraction of a second, before you can even react. Don't risk it!"
dogs,3e2leb,court67,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:21:52 2015 UTC,"Yep, this is basically why I'll never live with cats or small dogs. My dogs prey drive isn't even that high but I would feel like I'm constantly walking in eggshells. 100% not worth the risk. I will not be responsible for another animal getting seriously injured."
dogs,3e2leb,VividLotus,2,Tue Jul 21 14:26:04 2015 UTC,"As someone with a high prey drive hunting breed dog, I feel the same way. You can train a dog to go against its desires (for example, train them that they are not allowed to counter-surf), but I don't really believe you can train a dog to go against an innate instinct like prey drive to a degree where it's really safe to let them around animals they see as prey.  If I were in OP's shoes, I'd probably instead try to find non-cat-having roommates. But if that wasn't possible, I probably wouldn't let my dog offleash in the same room as the cats, because having a person around doesn't really do anything to deter a lot of high prey drive dogs."
dogs,3e2leb,MaIngallsisaracist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:40:37 2015 UTC,Totally agree. My dog has lived with my cats for years now. They cannot be near one another because he will kill them. We have had some really close calls--REALLY close calls--and it doesn't matter if there's a person in the room or not. I don't think it's an instinct that be suppressed. This isn't a good living situation for the dog or the cats.
dogs,3e2leb,hiyosilver64,0,Tue Jul 21 20:32:31 2015 UTC,Never leave her alone with cats or other small animals. Would be a matter of time before tragedy struck :(
dogs,3e2leb,octaffle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:31:41 2015 UTC,"I think the plan you have is as good as it's going to get: muzzle when the possibility to interact with cats exists.  Leashing when downstairs could help too.  With lots of fairly difficult training, you can eventually control how your dog acts around cats while you're there.  However, all bets are off if you're not home.  I'll also suggest putting up a gate somewhere so if the cats go upstairs, there's at least a gate separating them. I would really encourage your housemates to set up lots of cat shelves and other high pathways for the cats to move around, or set them up yourself if you have to.  I had to do that for my roommate.  She was very appreciative and the cat was much happier.  I would never be comfortable moving in to a house with cats if my dog were prey-driven.  I bet it would drive my dog bonkers and I'd feel absolutely guilty as hell if something happened, even if I did everything perfect.  So, best of luck to you.  I feel like this situation is probably a ticking bomb, but with vigilant management, everything should be okay, even if it's a pain in the ass."
dogs,3e38a4,Raspberry_Pancake,5,Tue Jul 21 16:48:35 2015 UTC,"I'd grab a bottle of UDAP bear spray, with a 30 foot range it should give you enough time to react safely."

For peace of mind I carry a wrist strap pepper spray so that I have an option to help keep myself and my dog safe.  If it helps your peace of mind, I have lived here for 6 years and never had to use it!"
dogs,3e2gz5,ulfjack,9,Tue Jul 21 13:18:14 2015 UTC,I would suggest seeing a vet for an evaluation (involving more than a cursory exam). There are times dogs are suffering but have no apparent illness or injury that we can tell simply by eyeballing them. You could consider even getting a second opinion.  Some tests should be run - possible some x-rays.   I urge you to do this sooner rather than later and would love an update.  Good luck and I hope you find the solution soon to your pup's personality change !  Nana internet hug
dogs,3e2gz5,hiyosilver64,4,Tue Jul 21 14:20:30 2015 UTC,This. Sounds like performing this trick is painful for her.

dogs,3e2gz5,hiyosilver64,2,Tue Jul 21 17:07:11 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'll give them a call when they're open tomorrow and go ahead and set up an appointment.

dogs,3e2fcj,organicmatter,4,Tue Jul 21 13:02:33 2015 UTC,Does she want breakfast and is relocating to where breakfast will be?  Mocha is up every day about 30 minutes before my alarm to try waking me up for breakfast -.-
dogs,3e2fcj,anasztaizia,2,Tue Jul 21 13:53:40 2015 UTC,Thats a good thought. We always go on a walk first thing in the morning and she absolutely loves that. I guess she could be waiting for that as well.
dogs,3e2fcj,alanlight,2,Tue Jul 21 15:34:48 2015 UTC,Any chance that she has to pee at that time and has found some secret corner to relieve herself?

dogs,3e3e0e,Kirean,4,Tue Jul 21 17:26:48 2015 UTC,"Tags get lost pretty frequently. Replacing them usually isn't a big deal. When you call your vet, just explain the situation. They've likely had to deal with it before and will know how to handle it."
dogs,3e3e0e,Kaedylee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:30:01 2015 UTC,"Call your vet and they'll mail you a new one. They keep the files on hand for several years after they issue a rabies certificate just in case something likes this happens.  Btw the tag itself is more of a peace of mind thing. It's the certificate from the vet with date, vaccination number, and the vet's signature on it that actually matters when it comes to proof of vaccination. It's not the end of the world if a dog does not have a rabies tag on his collar as long as the owner has the actual certificate.  Thanks for reminding me I need to get another certificate."
dogs,3e3c3u,tacobellagio,9,Tue Jul 21 17:14:01 2015 UTC,"If you're only giving the dog one walk per day, you can go ahead and eliminate every dog your boyfriend likes. Those are intense, high energy dogs that need a hell of a lot of stimulation. Also go ahead and cross off doodles unless you're exclusively looking at shelters and rescues. They're just not being responsibly bred.   What do you both think about greyhounds? They sound like they would be an excellent fit."
dogs,3e3c3u,court67,2,Tue Jul 21 17:24:47 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I thought too. I also read that you have to have a very authoritative personality with those breeds or else they'll walk all over you, and we're very laid back people. Thanks for confirming!  I never looked into a greyhound. I'll add those to the list. Thank you thank you!"
dogs,3e3c3u,homehealthgirl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:27:41 2015 UTC,"I don't like drool, but I really love St. Bernards. They look intimidating (they are huge!) but are really just lazy, goofy, love sponges.  I'd recommend narrowing down the list to a three breeds and then email some breeders and talk to them about their breed and what you want."
dogs,3e3c3u,je_taime,-10,Tue Jul 21 18:06:38 2015 UTC,"A greyhound could work if you lose the expectation that it's an immediate pet. Even coming from a foster home, a greyhound has to adjust once again to a new home, new situation, and not everything is taught or trained in a foster home.    I would like a dog that does well on car rides and can come with me places. I want a sweet dog that shows a lot of love and greets me at the door.   Right at adoption, there's no guarantee of that, and being affectionate and cuddly depends on the individual dog. This is something you need to communicate to the adoption rep and foster family because they will make matches.  Newly retired greyhounds need very patient handlers to help them transition and make the adjustment to pet life.   Also, I don't know what you mean by one walk a day. A lazy stroll barely reaching trot gait isn't enough for a greyhound's exercise."
dogs,3e3c3u,court67,7,Tue Jul 21 19:30:15 2015 UTC,"They tend to be difficult to train, you're correct. St. Bernard's have about the energy level you're looking for too."
dogs,3e3c3u,therobbo91,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:33 2015 UTC,"I'm going to second the idea of a greyhound, as long as you have space to let him/her run off leash every so often. It doesn't mean you have to have a huge yard, but there needs to be somewhere that they can let loose for a bit. Otherwise they're pretty lazy.   The ones your BF likes won't be happy with a walk a day, neither would a Golden or any sort of doodle. A Saint Bernard or BMD could be a possibility but you'd really have to make sure you were getting it from a reputable breeder and not someone in it for money."
dogs,3e3c3u,court67,4,Tue Jul 21 17:37:51 2015 UTC,I'm looking into the greyhounds and it seems like they're iffy with cats. Our cat is a Himalayan so he's a total diva. I'm worried a greyhound would chase him.
dogs,3e1sue,discipline_motivated,11,Tue Jul 21 08:21:38 2015 UTC,"More positive experiences with tall males. Every tall male who comes in the house gets a handful of treats that pup can't resist, and is quiet and non-threatening, maybe sitting on the floor or even keeping eye contact to a minimum.  I dealt with a rescue who had a lack of knowledge (I wouldn't describe it as a total fear) of humans, and would rumble and woof very low in her chest and then run away. She was worse with men, and sitting on the floor but ignoring her totally helped to take the pressure off her, and within 10min she was wandering over to sniff me and my jacket and let me touch her, but only with reduced eye contact and nothing directed specifically at her.  Worth a shot, but there's no way to just 'fix' it. You can't continue to build a negative association with tall men by punishing her for reacting 'appropriately' to a 'threat'. It's best to make sure that every time a tall guy comes in the house, good things happen, and only good things."
dogs,3e1sue,sincerely-sacha,3,Tue Jul 21 11:33:02 2015 UTC,Thank you that is good thinking and simple. I certainly don't punish her note I just feel helpless and terrible fit her. It may be a long process...
dogs,3e1sue,sincerely-sacha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:54:33 2015 UTC,"It can be, but she's young and malleable, if anything you may even want to invite your friend over who chased the pup and work specifically with that person.  It helps to know what your pup loves, and what they can't resist. Give the biggest rewards to the scariest person, it helps when the person becomes associated with THE AWESOMEST STUFF EVER."

So I couldn't go to his house anymore."
dogs,3dzz0p,Exis007,25,Mon Jul 20 23:59:39 2015 UTC,"I know this is totally off the wall but...  May I recommend rats?  I grew up in a household with dogs. I lived in the dorms all four years (small, liberal arts college that paid for my housing) and I desperately wanted a pet. I was missing my dogs hardcore, I knew I couldn't handle anything with a lot of responsibility, and I found what I think is the perfect compromise.   Rats are the biggest bang for your buck if you're missing a dog and can't have one.    They come to their names.  They know and bond with you as an individual. They ADORE you the way a dog does. More than a cat, anyway. They were stoked to have me come home and would give me all kinds of affection. They are really loving animals.  They learn tricks and games. Tag, hide and go seek, etc.  They use their cage as a litter box (no poop in the room outside of random accidents).  They live in cages and need an ~hour outside a day for playtime, but you can fudge that if you need to be away for a weekend You can be away for a weekend! Give them enough food and water, get someone to check on them once or twice, and you can be gone for several days without needing to worry about them.  Mine would climb into my hoodie and go around with me while I went to the dining hall, did laundry, ran to the bookstore, the grocery store...they LOVE being with you and are great companions.  CHEAP AS HELL to feed and care for. You buy bedding and you can make your own rat food for pennies on the dollar. You can also buy pellets if you prefer. I switched up their cage decorations once every month or so with random ass tee-shirts and card board boxes. I got these things for free on campus. You clean a cage once a week or every two weeks, you make food by the gallon bucket for 10$ and they are basically free.  They only live two years. You can't screw it up. If you have to leave for an internship, chances are good they'll be dead by natural causes well before you leave. They are a short-term investment. So. goddamned. smart. So, quick anecdote, one of my rats loved to climb six feet to the top of my closet shelf. But he didn't like to climb down. So he figured out he could shove himself in a bag of cotton balls and throw himself down from that height without hurting himself. They are clever as hell and they interact with you in this dynamic way.  The whole 'rat' thing grosses me out. I don't like wild rats. They are freaky. I LOVE pet rats. The tails aren't weird after the first week, you come to love them, and you even get used to their crawling on you in a day or two. It seems strange, but you adapt.    They are the best dog methadone in the world. They aren't dogs, but they might as well be. They love you with the same intensity, you can interact with them in the same, emotionally fulfilling way, and they can be trained in all kinds of neat ways. But they are also the best of cats inasmuch as they poop in a predetermined spot, are largely independent most of the day, and can be ignored for huge swaths of time. But the REAL kicker is how cheap they are to care for and maintain, how little commitment you have to make to them financially, and how easy they are to keep in terms of time and financial commitments.   They are the single best dog substitution. If you can get over the whole 'rat' thing, they are INCREDIBLE pets. And if you're wrong and you can't take care of a pet at a young age, no worries...they're dead in two to three years anyway. No harm, no foul."

dogs,3dzz0p,court67,5,Tue Jul 21 03:46:09 2015 UTC,"I didn't get my first dog until I was two and a half years out of undergrad (I was in my MA at the time) with a serious boyfriend with whom I had made previous arrangements for what would happen to the dog if we broke up. It was basically contract negotiations before we even started looking for a dog.   But the thing that kept me sane for the 6+ years I was primarily dogless was having rats for the middle portion. I got my first pair as a sophomore in college and one of them held on for almost four years before he died (he was a survivor). I saw so many people get cats (much more popular) only to abandon them or not get them fixed and end up with kittens....it was tragic. I had this stable pet I could keep and keep reasonably. The only time I ran into trouble was when I went off the road in black ice coming home for Christmas and had to talk a reluctant state trooper into putting the cage in the back of his car so they didn't freeze to death overnight. That was a hard sell but I got it done.   I had loving, affordable pets everyone BEGGED to snuggle when the came over to my room. They were weirded out at first, at least some people were, but the minute I pulled them out and they ran for the inside of my sweatshirt for snuggles, the love set in. Then they saw that they cuddled, asked for pets, tried to play with you, and were amazing little creatures and the ice thawed for all but the most staunch. You're always going to find some people who find them strange, but most people get over it in ten minutes of them pushing their little faces against your hand for pets and they realize they are basically mini-dogs that just want love and play."

There are obviously exceptions to the rule but I really believe the first year of a dog's life can be extremely hard on everyone in the household (look at all the SOS type threads that are posted each day) and it's incredibly unfair to assume your roommates will be okay to live with a dog that turns out to have surprise issues (it happens to the best of dogs/owners). It's risky and I simply wouldn't chance it. To me, it was well worth the wait to get a dog when I was out of university and lived without roommates."

They never once lost sleep over him, as his breeder did a wonderful job of introducing the litter to a crate so there was no howling or crying in the middle of the night. He doesn't destroy their things because he's never been unsupervised a day in his life. He's in his crate when I'm not home.   Of course it's unfair to assume that roommates will be okay to live with a dog, but no assumption was made here. It was 100% agreed upon before we signed a lease together. And we just moved into our 3rd house together so I'd say they're pretty big fans of the dog."

If I hadn't had friends or signed up for BorrowMyDoggy I wouldn't have been able to keep her over the summer - my mum wouldn't allow a potty training pup in her new flat, which I hadn't expected honestly. I was very lucky, and now we live in a nice house with understanding housemates and a garden and she's a happy well-loved dog. I don't regret it, though it really does stop me from doing a lot of things that my friends can all go off and do.  My advice is more of a warning for people willing to do it: a dog really shouldn't have to go through home changes, so please don't adopt one unless you have a lot of friends and family who can take it in emergencies until you get back on your feet. You probably don't know where you're going after college! You need support.  You also won't be able to do ANYTHING except watch your new dog for the first few months! Don't get her near finals (oh god please heed this, I didn't.)"
dogs,3dzz0p,pofish,14,Tue Jul 21 00:04:24 2015 UTC,As a college student who's about to adopt a dog I will say there are definitely college students capable of caring for a dog. This post was very informative also so thanks!!

dogs,3dzz0p,AZsnowflake,6,Tue Jul 21 01:09:09 2015 UTC,"Two of my roommates and I also each have a dog. It's definitely doable, as long as you're willing to put their needs in consideration before you do ANYTHING.  Have money saved for vet costs if they come up, and the (usually) non refundable pet deposits.   If you can find a house with a backyard, that will make things SO much easier. My dog is happier, and I don't have to worry about her being cooped up all day while I'm in class or at work. It's more expensive than an apartment, but it's worth it to me to have a happier animal and peace of mind.  No ""spring break"" or other trips unless you can find someone to watch your dog. Don't rely on your parents to house them when you run off somewhere. Unless they offer, which is awesome. But you should have the mind set that this is a responsibility all your own (because it should be) and that no one is going to step in and cover for you if you don't plan well. Figure arrangements out in advance, save for boarding costs or even throw your roommate some cash if she has to let your pup out to pee one morning.   Honestly, a college student schedule is very flexible, lots of breaks in the day to let out a puppy if you're not already working. I think it'd be easier to train a puppy in school versus when you enter the 9-5 workforce. If you have the maturity, mindset, and income, GO FOR IT! But college kids get a bad rep because so many people don't think it through, can't handle the dedication, or find their living situation to be unideal. Don't be one of those people. You know yourself and should know whether this is something you can handle or not."

I have a friend who can bring my dog to stay at the extremely nice doggy daycare/over night kennel they work at, free of charge. My dog will almost never be alone. We also have a huge fenced in yard. I've got a credit card with a $2,000 limit, an insanely flexible work schedule, and financial support from my parents. I've raised a puppy, been through obedience classes, spent some time working with a show dog trainer, and I was independently arranging cat, dog, and bird pet sitting jobs by age 8. I've been preparing most of my life to get my own dog, I already own all the dog books I could possibly need. Honestly I'd simply tell anyone that thinks I'm not ready for a dog that they could eat shit!"
dogs,3dzz0p,42Ubiquitous,4,Tue Jul 21 19:46:03 2015 UTC,"I got my dog in college and she is so special because of that.  I took her everywhere with me - to my friends' houses, outdoor restaurants, small parties, etc.  School afforded me a good deal of free time, or at least time at home studying, that I got to spend with her when she was a puppy.  She works in my office greeting patients now.  I really attribute her temperament to the fact that she was exposed to so much as a puppy.  Now that I'm busy working I would never have the time to give another dog that type of experience."
dogs,3dzz0p,Sactochief,4,Tue Jul 21 08:03:12 2015 UTC,"I got my first dog in college and it worked out really well. However, my circumstances were really well suited to dog ownership.   I rented one bedroom in a 6 bedroom house. Everyone who lived there was on board with dog before we got her. When we did get her, the landlady would come over to baby talk at her in Russian (so, landlord approval without having to pay pet rent). With seven people living in the house and coming and going at all hours of the day, she was never alone but also never velcroed to one person.   It was a frequent occurrence that someone would take her for a walk before class, then 5 minutes after they left, someone would come home from class and walk her. Bitch was sometimes getting 6 walks a day.   I took primary responsibly for vet bills and stuff, so when people started graduating and moving out, she stayed with me.   If you are going to be in the dorms or a small apartment or your roommates hate dogs, then maybe it's not the right time. But the dog I adopted in college seven years ago is a snoring old dog on the foot of my bed now and bringing her into my life is one of the best things I've ever done."
dogs,3dzz0p,42Ubiquitous,2,Tue Jul 21 10:47:12 2015 UTC,"I am currently in grad school in a rural area. I have an apartment on the first floor, and my back door opens up into a very large field with a pond. It's one of the only complexes that allow pets, and many students have dogs. The complex is predominantly grad students. I do not have roommates, and the apartment is pretty roomy for a single: large living room with an attached kitchen and a big bedroom. I do not go out (party) very often, and when I do, not late. I also spend a lot of my time at home and will have plenty of time to train and take care of my dog when I'm not studying. About two years ago my golden retriever passed, it was a family dog though, so I was looking to get a dog for my own. I was in high school when we got the golden, but I took good care of him: weekly/bi-weekly grooming, nail care, walks/runs, training, etc. I am not a super athletic guy or anything, but do enjoy walking around the field and running around with other dogs that I know. I can afford (the time and financially) to take good care of a dog and would love to have one again.  I have wanted a Bernese Mountain Dog for a long time. I think they have a temperament and energy level that would match my own; and they're great looking dogs. I was wondering if anyone who has had experience with these dogs could give some input on this decision. Additionally, I have been looking at Newfoundlands, and if some one could give me a comparison between BMDs and Newfoundlands I would appreciate it. I am aware of the health risks these breeds come with."
dogs,3dzz0p,42Ubiquitous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:42:21 2015 UTC,"What are your post grad plans? Are you prepared to seriously limit the places you can live due to having a very large dog? It's really much more difficult finding places to live with pets. I've just got a cat and it can be a struggle (pet friendly places, pet deposits, pet rent, etc). I've worked at dog kennels for 5ish years and in my experience Newfies tend to have far less energy than BMDs. BMDs need lots of socialization at young ages (as do all dogs)and constructive, brain and body excercising activities. Both are hairy and newfies are very drooly. I've known many BMDs who are under socialized and under stimulated and it can lead to a verrrry naughty pup. Sweet as pie but untrusting and rebellious. Others, that have clearly been worked with, are really freakin great dogs.   Just be willing to commit the next 15 years of your life!"

Their house is certainly more ideal for a dog of any size. I have never had to change my dog's home before, so I don't know how different breeds would react. (My family's response to me bringing him home would be perfectly ok though, they would love having him there.)  I am prepared to limit the places I can live. I expect it to be difficult to find something, but that's okay, I'd rather have my dog.   The amount of socialization it would receive is also a concern of mine. I plan on having it play with other dogs in the park/field, but aside from that it would be very limited. The only other time he would socialize with anyone except me and dogs in the park would be when I go home every month or so. I doubt that would be enough to prevent it from being under stimulated. But, I don't actually know.  I'd be perfectly happy with a hairy and drooly dog :) and excited to commit the next 15 years of my life to him/her!

As someone who is still in college with a pup, it is possible under the right circumstances. My bf and I got a pup. We have friends and family that are happy to watch her if there is ever a schedule conflict and someone can't be with her. We have no issue paying for vet bills, food, supplies, etc. On the other hand, my friend who is also in college has a roommate that got a dog despite protest. The roomate won't sleep in her room anymore because she locked the dog in there everyday and let it piss and shit everywhere. It is untrained and bites at people. The point is, the people who really should not get a dog in college are unfortunately probably not the people reading this post on this sub. There are some awful dog owners out there, college or not. Anyone reading this helpful post is a step ahead of all of them."

He has not ties us down at all because he loves camping with us, hiking, running. He loves car rides too and is small enough to fly on planes so we took him to see my family during Christmas. Larger breeds restrict travel a little more so that is another thing to take into consideration if your out of state from family. Grooming is a pain for some breeds as well. My dog grows hair faster than me so he gets shaved every 2-3 months. Puppies also like to chew. My puppy when I was in CC chewed a book I borrowed from the library."
dogs,3dzz0p,kmh0394,2,Tue Jul 21 04:19:43 2015 UTC,"I think these are really great things to consider, and if most of them haven't already crossed your mind, you're probably not ready for a dog. I got my dog right after freshman year of college. I made sure it was okay to bring him home for the summer, set aside savings from giving riding lessons in high school, signed a lease with a dog/breed friendly landlord for the next year, then adopted him. Would I do it again? Absolutely. Did it limit my freedom/options? Definitely. Studying abroad was out of the question. I couldn't just not come home after being out partying or go for a spontaneous weekend trip and I had to plan out where I could live/when I could travel months in advance. So yeah, obviously it's not for everyone and if you're not 100% committed to it, don't. That being said, it's been almost seven years and I've loved having my dog every single second of it. I think getting him during college gave me a lot of time to train him and spend time doing fun stuff without ""real life"" getting in the way. Sure, finals week was always rough but it was comforting to have him around.   Edit: Forgot to note: My dog was about a year and a half old when I adopted him (there's no way I could have handled a puppy). And he's an Am. staff., which makes finding housing a lot harder but by no means impossible in my city. Lastly, dogs are expensive, so plan for the worst. Mine cost me $98 at the shelter, which included neutering, shots, and a microchip. Since then I've probably spent close to $3k (TPLO x2, + ""tumor biopsy"" (my fault for being paranoid), + regular vet check ups)). And that doesn't even begin to cover his rehab costs."
dogs,3dzz0p,mmegggusta,2,Tue Jul 21 05:14:33 2015 UTC,"If I may add, I'm a senior in college and own a GSD. I love Echo, we've had a lot of adventures and fun. That being said, if I could do it all over again, I wouldn't.  You really can't be 100% what you're going to get with a dog ever but I've had the following issues with him while in college:  -(ex) girlfriends roommate almost killing him when she said she'd watch him costing me 2,000 dollars (still paying a family member back)  -Seperation anxiety. I've worked like crazy to work this out of him, but he still has problems with it. If I'm going to go anywhere I have to set aside about an hour, at a minimum depending on how long I'll be out, to wear him our before letting him out. This has essentially destroyed spontaneous events, that are somewhat a cornerstone of college.  -Sudden change in dog-aggression. For the first 13 months of his life Echo was amazing with every dog he ever met. I'd joke that ""Echo's never met a dog he's never liked, but plenty that don't like him"" however, about two months ago he started getting randomly aggressive with strangers dogs. This has severely limited how often I can hike off leash trails. He's essentially on leash most of the time now which is stressful and not as fun.  Even with all of that, I love my dog. I refuse to give up on him and the work continues but if I was able to hit a reset button and go back to when I got him, I'd have to seriously reconsider my decision.   Don't just think about how fun it'll be or have unfair expectations on the puppy/dog before getting it, dogs personalities can be very fluid and the dog you originally get may not be the dog you have later."
dogs,3dzz0p,court67,3,Tue Jul 21 11:46:16 2015 UTC,"This is freaking excellent. I adopted two dogs and a cat in college. It was a lot of work but it was worth it for me, I have the financial security and I live alone. The only other thing I'd recommend is adding to the study abroad part: any traveling. College is the where tons of people go travel the world and its really hard to find someone to watch your dog every break. If you go out of state often and fly, you've got to reconsider how you're gonna get there. Some airlines don't accept some breeds: snub nose dogs and cats. Not only do your nights at the bar and sleepovers get cut short, your vacations do as well.   Also, make sure its CLEAR who owns the dog. You never want to split ownership with a roommate or s.o. because when move out day comes, it can become awkward.   I can't stress enough how expensive dogs are, especially puppies. Finding a good vet is hard as hell and most places people end up, like Banfield, are so overpriced that it'll suck your college funds dry. Good food, flea meds, heart meds, food, toys, bedding, shots, neuter/spay, insurance, treats, it all adds up to more than you expect. You'll absolutely need a savings account for emergencies too and pet insurance is a good idea for older dogs and puppies."
dogs,3dzz0p,mmegggusta,2,Tue Jul 21 12:17:55 2015 UTC,"These are great things to consider, but I really think the criteria should be narrowed down for the absolute musts. I have three dogs and I don't have over ten grand saved in emergency funds just in case for vet bills.   But there are other options aside from having a small savings nest egg for a hip replacement for a displasic dog. I have adopted two dogs thus far who are just have the worst genes. I'm talking blind, severe hip dysplasia, slight leg deformities that led to continual hip and knee injury, etc. just because I don't throw down ten grand for a full hip replacement, doesn't mean I didn't give my dog a happy life. I honestly see nothing wrong with people adopting a diseased/deformed dog and keeping it happy and taking care of it until their quality of life is low, and putting them down. Those dogs need love too, they simply will be put down in the shelter else wise.   I definitely agree that someone should have at least 500 dollars (or the ability to put it on a credit card/care credit and pay it off in a reasonable amount of time) but this notion that you must have a large nest egg to have a dog is a bit ridiculous.   Edit: another solution might be to include a few prices of procedures your dog might need to let people know dogs can be expensive. But our guidelines shouldn't deter a responsible person from getting a pound puppy because they don't have three grand in savings."
dogs,3dzz0p,court67,4,Tue Jul 21 11:48:41 2015 UTC,"If you're adopting a dog that's definitely going to be put down if you don't take them right then, then yes your argument holds up. But what if they get adopted by someone who can afford to keep their quality of life high for years and years? How is that fair to the dog if you can't afford an unexpected vet visit?"
dogs,3dzz0p,mmegggusta,3,Tue Jul 21 12:28:00 2015 UTC,"There's always options, though. Kick starter funds, care credit, opening a credit card, working with the vet, etc. This isn't a binary option.   And if you go to your local shelter, some dogs have as little as three days. They were going to put my dog down because he was sick and in my front yard. Three days. Didn't call the number in tag or anything, or check the microchip.   Sorry for the tangent, but my experiences with the local shelters is that they are significantly more focused on numbers than saving dogs, and many dogs don't get adopted for a number of reasons and need that one poor, dumb, unprepared college student just to not be another body in the dumpster. Volunteering at the humane society has changed my perspective greatly."
dogs,3dzz0p,SleepyPterodactyl,3,Tue Jul 21 12:47:20 2015 UTC,"Kickstarter funds and sites like go fund me often take several days or weeks to raise the necessary amount of money- not ideal for an emergency. Not every condition is covered by care credit. Opening a credit card, to me, is virtually the same thing as having an emergency fund, and it was actually mentioned in the OP. This is a valid option, having a credit card with a couple thousand dollar limit reserved solely for vet emergencies. Working the the vet is not reliable at all. I've been to 3 different vets since I've had my dog and not a single one offers payment plans. If you already have a vet that's wiling to do payment plans that's fine, but scroll through the ""help I can't pay for my dog's treatment"" posts and see just how many vets are willing to work with you on that.   I can see the merit of adopting a dog that is slated to be euthanized and hoping they don't get sick. Even if they do, at least they can be put to sleep with the company of the human that loves them. I'll make that concession. But adopting a puppy or buying from a breeder without having a couple thousand dollars saved up is ridiculously irresponsible.   A good option for a poor college student is fostering. The organization will most likely be able to cover emergency vet costs. Don't adopt a dog if you can't afford it."
dogs,3dzz0p,mmegggusta,2,Tue Jul 21 13:33:28 2015 UTC,"Yes. Buying from a breeder with no way to pay for making it better is dumb. It's also a really, really poor investment. Those people aren't likely to be searching on reddit to see if they should be getting a dog. They likely just go buy it and then have issues down the road.   And I'm not saying someone should rely on kickstarter or whatever. I just think the criteria that we highly recommend a large savings account before getting any dog is a bit extreme. Someone willing to throw down two grand on a dog is probably capable of raising money for a five hundred dollar treatment fairly quickly. Not that situations will always be the same, but the breeder's fees serve a purpose to weed out people who aren't able to financially support a pup.   And someone who doesn't have a ton of money but is capable of buying food and paying for small price vet visits ($50-$100) is inherently going to give a pound puppy a better life, even if they have to put it down due to costs for a broken leg (ultimately saving the dog from the pain of healing, even though it is not a difficult thing to fix).   I think it would be more helpful to include a comment that vet fees can be expensive, and maybe include three or four example costs, but for the sub including that everyone should have a specific amount of savings isn't a reasonable expectation."
dogs,3dzz0p,SleepyPterodactyl,2,Tue Jul 21 18:27:31 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's ok not too spend a couple of grand to treat certain conditions, such as cancer. I do think it's important to have money saved up for something like a broken leg, that is perfectly fixable, but can be expensive. I also think there's a difference between purchasing a dog without an emergency fund and saving a dog that would otherwise be put down without an emergency fund."
dogs,3dzz0p,hacelepues,2,Tue Jul 21 12:39:22 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. But I don't think that we should say it's an absolute must to have money saved to own a dog. Financially, for me, it is more responsible to use savings to pay off debt and have credit card space.   If you have two grand to buy a dog, then yeah. Absolutely. But if you're rescuing a dog from being put down, It's a bit different. I know many people who make it work in a shitty situation. Those people shouldn't opt to leave the dog because they don't have three grand saved."
dogs,3dzz0p,Sactochief,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:44:49 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's not black and white. I know a well off family that bought a lab and ended up neglecting it to the point that it was severely obese and has behavioral issues. They rehomed the lab after it bit several people. I know another poor family that bought a puppy and it seems to have a good life with several walks a day (they live in an apartment) and lots of attention. The weird thing is, if you looked at these families 10 years ago they were in the exact opposite situations. The well off family had a lab that was fine with their sedentary lifestyle, and the poor family put down their mutt with behavioral issues when they were evicted.   As /u/jenadactyl said elsewhere in this post, only the person getting the dog really knows if they're ready. Sometimes the person with no savings is more willing to spend more money, and go into debt to care for their dog than a person with a lot of savings is."

I got a job at a doggy daycare to be able to pay for the expensive first year of puppyhood without keeping him shut in all day. I'd run home between classes to let him out. I trained him so well. We're moving to Chicago now and of course he's coming with us!   If I had posted ""should I get a dog?"" here with my current situation, everyone would have said ""No!""

I know that I am in the minority, but I earned enough money to afford all the (many) costs of owning a dog and took excellent care of the adult dog I adopted as a college junior. I've graduated now but adopting her is one of the best decisions I've made in my life. I gave her a structured and loving home after her previous owners had neglected her, and she is much happier and healthier as a result of that. Both of our lives are greatly improved as a result of my decision to adopt her.  Additionally, my husband adopted a dog his sophomore year of college and it was an excellent choice for him. They are inseparable and he is and always has been an excellent and devoted caretaker.  Not saying that we are in the majority, but if you have honestly analyzed your living conditions, stability, financial status, maturity, etc., and adopting is something you truly want and can handle for potentially up to 20 years, I don't think being a college student has anything to do with your viability as an owner."

dogs,3dzz0p,nopantsdancing,4,Tue Jul 21 04:49:31 2015 UTC,"In my view if you are looking for a pet a companion animal it should be with you/family for most of the time you are home which means in the house. If the climate and dog are suited to it by all means kennel outside overnight but if you are awake and in the house the dog should have the option of being with you.  If it is a working dog - livestock guardian/guard dog/herding dog that is somewhat different. These dogs have been bred/trained to function without people. Herding collies are with their farmer most of the day and therefore are tired and so can sleep outside.  The problem most people have on this sub with outside dogs is that they can and do develop problems because of being alone. Most people live in urban environments so the dog can't be allowed to roam, can develop nuisance behaviours like barking or digging and generally get much less attention than a dog that is in the home with its people."

If you've found a way to keep your dogs happy and healthy while they live outside, I have no problem with that.  A big part of the reason people in the US have issues with dogs living outside is because aside from working farm or guard dogs, many dogs that live outside in the US do not have great lives. They are often kept in small yards with little to no exercise or mental stimulation. This can lead to constant barking, digging, pacing, and obsessive behaviors. Not a good situation for the dog or for the neighbors.  For this post in particular, I was working under the assumption that most college students simply do not have the option of leaving their dogs outside. Most college students in the US live in apartments and usually have little to no yard. They live in areas with a high population density, and letting their dogs run around outside all day just isn't an option.  Are there some college students out there who could have an outside dog?  Perhaps, but at least in the US, they are a very, very small minority."
dogs,3dzz0p,bazilbt,4,Tue Jul 21 13:21:58 2015 UTC,"So this is also the impression sometimes I get on this sub, that there is basically one, maybe two, ways of properly raising a dog, and otherwise everyone here will tell you you really shouldn't have one. I would take it with a grain of salt, as the people self-select themselves as interested in dogs and so you get quite a bit of bias. This isn't unique to this sub but actually any interest-specific sub.  In the end, nobody can really know if someone can or should own a dog except that person."
dogs,3dzz0p,nopantsdancing,5,Tue Jul 21 06:16:49 2015 UTC,"That's how I feel too. If you don't quit your job to become a full time trainer who crates their dog inside their bedroom you don't deserve a dog.   If you don't agree with that then you get down votes (because they are for disagreeing with people, not for removing comments that don't add to discussion). As shown here!"
dogs,3dzz0p,SharpStiletto,2,Tue Jul 21 06:35:44 2015 UTC,"A few things: dogs are very social, and by and large live to be with their humans. An outside dog is like putting a person in solitary confinement; if you only see them a few hours a day, their quality of life will suffer.  Also, dogs outside in urban or semi-urban area are at risk of injury or sickness from passers-by and other dogs, or may bark excessively, causing noise complaints. Inclement weather is also a concern.  If you can't keep a dog inside, unless you have very special circumstances, you are probably better off not getting a dog."
dogs,3dzz0p,WeeLeigh,-6,Tue Jul 21 05:23:49 2015 UTC,"I grew up on a farm in Australia with an outside dog, and she never appeared to have any problems.

dogs,3dzz0p,Haymakers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:50:28 2015 UTC,So what? They are still highly social and if you can't be around them and play with them a decent amount you aren't giving them a good life. I question why someone would want to get a pet and not spend time with it.

dogs,3dzz0p,goldfish_king,4,Tue Jul 21 07:27:38 2015 UTC,"I think part of the problem is that in some parts of the world the weather / lifestyle / culture has people spending more time outside than in the States, from what I gather from reading on this sub anyway.  Having a dog living outside and having the lifestyle to:   be around them and play with them a decent amount as /u/bazilbt says above   is not mutually exclusive.  I think there are a bunch of factors to be taken into account and one should not assume any of them."
dogs,3dzz0p,goldfish_king,4,Tue Jul 21 11:25:50 2015 UTC,"What? I grew up around outdoor dogs as well and they are around people all the time, get all sorts of attention, and get to spend their free time doing doggy stuff like rolling in stinky things and lounging in the sun. I think you must be thinking of dogs that are just kept chained up in a yard or something. Just because a dog doesn't sleep in bed with you or in your bedroom doesn't mean it's unloved and not given attention. There's plenty of ways to keep a healthy, happy and loved dog outside. There's plenty of ways to keep a lonely, unloved, and uncared for dog inside."

I just wanted to wish you luck finding the dog a home :( it always breaks my heart when dogs are unwanted and in our area Chihuahuas are particularly looked over and overpopulated. Have you visited shelters yet? If you decide to turn the dog in to San Jose Animal Care Center, the staff there is very nice and love the animals. Since I leave nearby the shelter, I can visit the dog every now and then and let you know how she's doing. Best of luck."
dogs,3e1e0g,ZaBreeNah,5,Tue Jul 21 05:55:59 2015 UTC,Since you are in the area you can look into Copper's Dream based out of SF. It's a shelter that doesn't have its own building to house dogs so all of their dogs are out in foster homes and they often have adoption events at multiple locations. Not to mention that you also have Pets In Need in Redwood City which also happens to be California's first no kill shelter.
dogs,3e1e0g,AbsentLight12,3,Tue Jul 21 09:23:14 2015 UTC,You can add the doggy to petfinder.com  It's for rescues and people trying to dining homes for dogs:) it allows adopters to look up dogs by breed and age in their area!! Good luck!!

dogs,3e1e0g,orangetangerine,2,Tue Jul 21 16:26:01 2015 UTC,"You should look into rescues that transport out of California, working with a sister rescue to move dogs to other parts of the country that have a good amount of adoptable homes.  I don't know of any off the top of my head but Facebook is a good resource for this.  There is a greater demand for Chi mixes (along with other companion breeds) in areas where strays are less prevalent and families are looking for smaller dogs.  The rescue I volunteer for pulls dogs from Arkansas, and since we have a huge renter population a lot of the smaller dogs go very quickly, including Chihuahuas."

Someone will fall in love.  Everyone wants a pet with a story, don't they?"
dogs,3e1m9f,whatwouldahippodo,9,Tue Jul 21 06:54:36 2015 UTC,"Jumping over logs in the woods is the sort of thing that's ok for puppies. Jumping over jumps on mats in dog class? Not so good.   As far as what else you can teach her, I'd get a board and put it on something, so that it rolls around and tips. I'd teach her to not be afraid of the board moving under her feet, and I'd teach her to run it as fast as possible, with all four feet staying on it.   I'd also teach her to be off leash while the two of you are working together. I'd work on teaching her to check in with you, to know that you're important. You can look up Susan Garrett's crate games book. It's a good place to start on those topics.   If you live in a place with multiple dog training places, I'd look for a puppy agility class. There is stuff you can teach them when they're young.   Some training places let young puppies into agility classes. There is stuff that they can learn when they're very young and fearless, such as walking on boards, learning that they may drop out from under them (the teeter), and how do do 2 on 2 off for contacts. They can learn to go thru two wings of a jump, or around to the back side, with the bar of the jump on the ground.   I would not jump a puppy or teach him to weave though."
dogs,3e1m9f,Twzl,6,Tue Jul 21 10:29:50 2015 UTC,"The thought is you want to discourage high impact activity until the growth plates have closed. There are plenty of things you can work on with agility without doing jumps... you can train jumps with the pole on the ground so they have to step over it but still get the concept, and you can work on other obstacles too... but the most important thing is teaching foundation skills - two on, two off, basic commands, off-leash obedience, etc.  A good agility instructor will understand and work on stuff with you and keep it low impact until about 12 months of age."
dogs,3e1m9f,rvtjess,3,Tue Jul 21 07:26:54 2015 UTC,"Just echoing what others have said, typically you want to discourage high-impact anything until the growth plates have closed. For some young puppies they even discourage walking down staircases. Ultimately, growth plates close at different times depending on your dog's breed and their final size/weight.  If you have a large breed, that can typically be older than 1 year, but for most medium and small breeds they recommend 1 year. There are lots of agility training places that offer puppy agility classes or 'fundamentals' for dogs as young as 4 months. It's all about acclimatizing the dogs to different elements involved in agility, but usually without any sort of jumping.  We have this issue with horses as well, it's not considered appropriate to jump a horse under 4 (again, depends on the breed) but very often you'll see yearlings leaping over things of their own volition. It shouldn't be a regular thing, but if she's out and hops over something it won't kill her. It's just not something you want to be repeating on a regular basis, basically think about how much you ask her as a pup to do her obedience commands (if you're practicing a sit-stay, or sit/down, you might repeat it several times) that's what's really damaging, exposing the joint to high impact over and over again.  Once in a while? Not a problem."

dogs,3e1m9f,brab74,2,Tue Jul 21 15:21:01 2015 UTC,"I'm an agility instructor.  Agility classes require a lot of body motions (jumping, weaving) which shouldn't be done repeatedly until the dog's growth plates have closed.  It depends on the dog, but that occurs at about a year of age.  In the meantime, you can reinforce your obedience skills - sit, down, stay, and come [start working on them in places with a lot of distractions, such as at a park] - plus things such as targeting (touch a target), walking on a plank on the ground, and walking on different types of floor surfaces.  There are plenty of ""non agility"" exercises to work on now in preparation for agility :)  Clean Run has books and videos which are geared towards exercises for puppies in preparation for agility."

And you may have to travel aerie a ways to find one (do NOT settle on one just because they're closer to you). But you want to make sure they do all health clearances, testing, show in conformation, etc.  I would still continue exploring rescues, though. I guarantee you there are breed - specific rescues that may have what you're looking for; put just as much effort into travel, etc, as you would with a breeder."

Factors will include how rare the breed is / in your location; the closer the better IMV, so you can meet with the breeder and visit the puppies - but I got my Beauceron in a different country and drove several days up and down to go and collect him, it is a virtually unknown breed here.   There's also an element of luck with the timing and in my experience, good breeders have been helpful to recommend other breeders who are expecting or planning a litter at a different time.

dogs,3e2vaq,WilTedDust,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:15:52 2015 UTC,"Obedience classes will help.  One thing that helped our dog when she would embarrassingly go off would be bringing the highest value treats out there and lure her into a sit-stay for them.  These treats only came with us on walks.  We're talking like, deli roast beef, bologna, cheese, oven roasted turkey, smell-to-high-heaven fish biscuits - the good stuff.  If you spot a biker or a dog from far away, start as far away as possible (cross the street preemptively if you have to).  Lure your dog into a sit-stay, with her eyes fixated on you and the treat while the dog passes.  Do this A LOT.  The key is to keep her a) far away from the stimulus to prevent her from going off and b) keeping her attention away and stopping her from being fixated on the moving dog/bike to prevent her from going off.  You might have to start real far and stop a lot, and it will take awhile to combat the existing behavior, but the name of the game is to keep her at a point where she doesn't go off and slowly desensitize her to the experience little by little until she's not bothered by it."
dogs,3e1i2d,settersrclowns,6,Tue Jul 21 06:04:58 2015 UTC,"Amazingly, nothing. She's not a chewer. So much so that I had to bribe her into chewing on chewy treats and toys! I got her at a year old from a shelter so I can only assume her previous owner was very adamant about the no-chewing rule."
dogs,3e1i2d,eatcauliflower,2,Tue Jul 21 07:29:19 2015 UTC,Your lucky. My youngest dog now tries to hide/bury chewy treats. She did her share of destruction though as a pup/young dog.
dogs,3e1i2d,SharpStiletto,5,Tue Jul 21 07:39:39 2015 UTC,"My first puppy chewed a wooden window frame, door frame and dresser, plus he scratched the doors in that same corridor we were using to contain him. This was many years ago. I remember going to London and buying a fancy spray from Harrods to apply to the wood to stop him from chewing. Finally, a solution! I applied it liberally and returned home to find that he'd knocked over the spray bottle and chewed on that too… -.-  Same dog also committed an act of vengeful destruction against my SO at the time. The pup had issues with men and was also a totally devoted and velcro one-woman dog. He thought that since I now had him, I no longer needed my SO and would rehome the man. At some point my SO was away in Japan for about 10 days and my pup thought I’d finally given the SO up for adoption… he had me ALL to himself! He even slept in the bedroom next to me - usually he slept downstairs.  SO comes home on a Friday afternoon and I shut the bedroom door while my SO has a nap and I wash my hair - we were going out that evening. As I shut the door, my pup was lying across the entrance. When my SO opened the door to go down for some boiling water to shave, my pup was still there, loyally lying along the doorway. I remember thinking, “Ah! Look at that! What I’ve always wanted!”  Minutes later my warm fuzzy feelings were instantly extinguished as SO came storming up the stairs, “Fucking dog!!! Wait till I get him!! I'm going to kill him!!!” Dog slipped into bedroom to hide behind me as an angry SO emerged, brandishing a mangled pair of Gucci sunglasses. But that was not all, he’d left his new sunglasses and passport on the kitchen table. Odin had targeted both these objects, rendering the glasses useless and biting up the passport (mainly the photo page) into 23 pieces - I know this because I counted them as I worked to stick the passport back together with clear tape. My So needed it to cross a frontier on the Monday (another story!).  Odin also chewed up a phone directory and a couple of other things I frequently touched when we were living at an apartment for a short period of time. He did not appreciate being left alone there and by this time he was an adult, past the chewing stage. Once we moved back into the house there was never any chewing again. To that dog, space mattered and the apartment just didn’t cut it.  Second puppy: 0 destruction! \o/ By this time I had learned to effectively use play-pens and training.  Stella: several sweaty bras that were hanging on the chair outside to dry after working outside. Yup, she soon trained me to be neater and not leave them lying around all night! She also chewed up one sock, one li-ion camera battery and the little bag it was in (pilfered from the house and taken to her bed on the porch to chew) and a memory card that I dropped outside (fair game). Also, several plastic pots and bits, a couple of paint brushes and one sandal that I can still wear. Honestly, bearing in mind that she’s an outdoor dog and her environment is very difficult to proof, it wasn’t so bad, considering. She’s now over that stage. : )  Indra: one brand new Marks & Spencer’s slipper when he was little. I returned home with a new pair and left them somewhere close to his bed area (which was my error). Either it fell or he took it, thinking it was a toy meant for him. I don’t blame him at all, ’twas an innocent mistake as far as I'm concerned and it is the only thing he's ever damaged."
dogs,3e1i2d,SharpStiletto,2,Tue Jul 21 07:23:19 2015 UTC,Wow! You need a TLDR for that post! I could make a list that long too. No matter what you do to puppy proof they will find something! Not just pups but full grown dogs too.
dogs,3e1i2d,SharpStiletto,3,Tue Jul 21 07:35:59 2015 UTC,You asked for stories! :'D Tell your stories then!   No matter what you do to puppy proof they will find something! Not just pups but full grown dogs too.   Nah! I disagree. Pups #2 and #4 pretty much prove it for me.
dogs,3e1i2d,SharpStiletto,2,Tue Jul 21 07:46:03 2015 UTC,"OK. I posted some examples. Pups are unpredictable no matter what you do. The full grown dogs just find new ways to destroy my yard. I have diggers. Son of bitch wreck your yard, tear off the gutter downspouts hunting chipmunks diggers."
dogs,3e1i2d,SharpStiletto,2,Tue Jul 21 08:05:37 2015 UTC,"I'll go and read them now. : )  I agree to a degree; perhaps with certain breeds or dogs some behaviours are more problematic to deal with than others. You have Setters, Retrievers and Labs? I've got no experience with the former but do with a friend's Lab and he is a chewer like none of my dogs have been! Oh, my goodness. There again, I wonder how that same dog would be in another environment. I've not had extreme chewers and I've been able to manage it.  Stella is the most annoying digger so far. I've been working with her all year to dig in certain areas (after a number of transgressions) and in the last few months she's concentrated on digging the designated space. \o/ My other dogs have just dug a little hole now and again or to just bury a bone unobtrusively.   There again, we don't have chipmunks and such critters to deal with!"
dogs,3e1i2d,SharpStiletto,2,Tue Jul 21 08:23:08 2015 UTC,"The lab we got as an 8 year old so he was never a problem. He even passed his tests to be a therapy dog with flying colors. Past Setter and Golden pups did the most damage I listed. Setters are great escape artists. Every time I thought I had a fence secure they would find/create the tiniest hole to get through. If they aren't digging to get out they dig after every critter that hides from them. A sport the Goldie is only to happy to join in on. Last week they tore off a 6 ft section of downspout again because a chipmunk was in it. Between stomping it flat, puncturing it with their teeth and digging holes around it who could tell if the chipmunk got away or they crushed it to death. My last Setter would chase them up the downspout and wait patiently because he knew they couldn't climb the pipe to the roof. He'd just wait them out listening as they slid back down the spout again and again."
dogs,3e1i2d,slamthedog,2,Tue Jul 21 08:50:33 2015 UTC,Do you have any pictures of those chipmunks?!
dogs,3e1i2d,laikapet,4,Tue Jul 21 12:52:24 2015 UTC,"My list of things destroyed by dogs: Floors, trim, window sills, blinds, eye glasses, remotes, shoes, clothes, dog beds, books, a coffee table, an antique sewing machine and the outside cable connecting my phone/TV/internet to the house. That's the short list. I can think of many more."
dogs,3e1i2d,leaping-elk,2,Tue Jul 21 07:56:13 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, my first puppy destroyed a dog bed. Also when he was kennelled, but that was fair game."
dogs,3e1i2d,SharpStiletto,3,Tue Jul 21 08:25:56 2015 UTC,My first Setter ate/tore up a papasan chair cushion once. Only time I kenneled him for a trip he shredded his bed.
dogs,3e1i2d,leaping-elk,2,Tue Jul 21 08:57:07 2015 UTC,"The first time I kennelled my first dog the lady, who was a friend of my SO, handed his foam bog bed to me in bits in a plastic bag, twice maybe. I was young and inexperienced and felt very apologetic and quite embarrassed, thinking she was giving me the bag like that in a reproving way. After that when we kennelled him, she just gave him her blankets which he didn't chew or it didn't matter and that was that. He was always fine at home, and once we then made provisions to leave him at home when we travelled he was always fine and well behaved roaming free inside the house the whole time. The worst he/they did was sleep on a couch, which is not a crime but a way of life for many people. O.o  Anyway, it was only years later, by which time we were friends, that the boarding lady mentioned in conversation how her practice was to return destroyed beds/objects to her clients so they would not think / could never accuse her of keeping them for herself!! *LOL*"
dogs,3e1i2d,SharpStiletto,4,Tue Jul 21 09:18:05 2015 UTC,"Slam chewed through a door. That was probably the worst thing any of them have done. Smaller things-cell phone chargers, my glasses, shoes, clothes, cooking utensils like spatulas, Henry walked around on the dining room table and left some nasty scratches. He also chewed on the legs all of the chairs in the dining room. Blinds, books, headphones, dog beds, my comforter. My stuffed bear I have slept with since I was a little kid. Bad dogs."
dogs,3e1i2d,leaping-elk,3,Tue Jul 21 11:20:02 2015 UTC,I think the best one was  when my 8 month old Setter got over the gate I was using to keep him in the kitchen while I was at work. I came home and all the books on my lower book case were shredded across my apt floor and my power was out. Took him out to walk then came back to clean but I noticed only my power was out. Checked my breaker box and saw the breaker was tripped. The I found the plugged in alarm clock cord he chewed through. Checked his mouth for burns and nothing was there. It was the last time he did anything destructive inside. Gave him free reign since he already knew how to beat the puppy gate.

dogs,3e1i2d,caffeinatedlackey,2,Tue Jul 21 12:10:51 2015 UTC,"He accidentally left the storm door open when they were out front, so when he told the dog to go home... the dog did. He usually stopped at the door and waited on my boyfriend to open the door, but I guess he either had that goofy Dane speed or didn't realize the door was closed (since my boyfriend never leaves the storm door open). Thankfully our ridgeback hasn't done anything like that yet! He and our mix were playing once put back and one of them rolled the other into the porch screen, ripping it, but we were in the process of redoing the screen anyway."

We went out (edit: all of us, away from the house) for a while and when we returned the daughter opened the other door. My dog did not realise this and just avidly went through the closed one, as he'd been doing all along. : / Human lack of awareness and forsight - and I'm not blaming the kid!  My friend was very happy and she maintained our dog was smart for walking through the old scratched and stickered window; she'd recently replaced the other one and now had us pay for a second new one!!"

dogs,3e1i2d,serebear,2,Tue Jul 21 18:55:46 2015 UTC,"A sofa from Ikea. Just destroyed the whole thing.   Another one used to take books off of the shelves, and skulk away, to destroy them in private. We'd find small nests of destroyed books.   One went into a pair of pants, extracted two $50 bills and ate them. When they ""reappeared"" I washed them, taped them, and brought them to the bank.  The book eater one day decided to lift up some carpet in the hallway, and chew up the carpet padding.   One dog, during a big family dinner, tip toed to the sideboard and slurped the top of a pie off. He also stole a stick of butter, and barked at me, with it in his mouth sideways, so he could go out and eat it in peace.   One old dog used to like to go to the recycling bin we had on our porch, and root thru it for things to chew. He'd leave the porch awash in torn up paper."

It was the first night we let him sleep with us instead of in his crate and he found a pair of my boyfriend's jeans on the floor. This was definitely our fault because I had given him a big chunk of denim to chew from when I made cutoffs so he probably assumed that all denim was fair game.   Besides that, he's been surprisingly good about chewing. He listens when we tell him ""no, that's not for puppy"" and will completely ignore that thing afterward. This includes a plate of donuts, wooden chair legs, a spoon, and my phone. I'm so proud of him!"
dogs,3e1i2d,ahhhhhh1234,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:06:59 2015 UTC,"For starters, every stuffed toy he's ever received.  This was also Chief's handiwork. In his defense, a construction crew came out and tore up our driveway and I wasn't aware so he was alone for ~4 hours listening to construction and people yelling right outside my bedroom window. He was rightfully stressed.   Since then, he's taken it upon himself to destroy a couple of pillows. The first was my fault because I woke up late and didn't have time to exercise him that morning. I think after that he discovered the joy in filling my room with down feathers, so we've since had a little heart to heart and he's spending more time in his kennel. ;)"

dogs,3e3bnn,bwood800,8,Tue Jul 21 17:11:00 2015 UTC,"How is this surprising? Of course she's terrified now! She clearly didn't understand the electric fence, which means you didn't introduce it properly, and that would be why she kept blowing through it. So now she got REALLY shocked and has absolutely no idea why! I'd be scared too if I was trotting around my backyard and experienced pain for reasons I couldn't understand.   Personally, I'd forgo the electric fence completely. It's clearly not effective. Start making going outside on leash a blast- fun toys, yummy treats, nothing negative whatsoever! It's going to take some time to fix that negative interaction she had, but it can be done.   In the meantime, turn off the electric fence and take your dog out on a leash."

dogs,3e0p2l,homehealthgirl,2,Tue Jul 21 02:14:53 2015 UTC,I'm pretty bad at these but this was my thought! One of my friends has a springer who is absolutely lovely. She's put in some basic training but the pup is right around a year old and definitely not annoying or crazy bouncy like a lab at that age.
dogs,3e0p2l,homehealthgirl,2,Tue Jul 21 02:26:47 2015 UTC,"Springers and Brittany were breeds that came to mind. Have her watch a few hunt videos, especially of Springers. If she's never hunted behind a spaniel it's a, hmm. Special experience. I believe my beloved spaniels have been described as ""crackheads"".  I can't speak to much for Brittany dogs but they are beautiful, and definitely strike me as lab like in personality, just a bit more aloof. Brittanies are, in my experience, much more serious than Springers who tend to be pretty goofy."
dogs,3e0p2l,Synaxis,2,Tue Jul 21 02:17:59 2015 UTC,"From that description, a Brittany would be a closer fit to what she's looking for. Her current lab, and self-proclaimed favorite, is quirky but not goofy or silly, really. Friendly, but pretty aloof for a lab and I think she likes that about him. Hence why I'm looking at other breeds for her. She loves her lab, but he's not your typical lab so I think she'd be happy with a different breed."
dogs,3e0p2l,eddasong,3,Tue Jul 21 02:38:28 2015 UTC,I think a Brittany might be a good fit then. Some of the field lines really don't need any professional grooming unless you want them to look neater.

dogs,3e0p2l,MockingbirdRambler,3,Tue Jul 21 03:33:40 2015 UTC,"Brittanies aren't supposed to have profuse amounts of coat no matter how they are bred. They're actually one of the hunting breeds that is still very much dual purpose without a huge split. They're actually a little unique because their standard says:   Ears should carry little fringe. The front and hind legs should have some feathering, but too little is definitely preferable to too much. Dogs with long or profuse feathering or furnishings shall be so severely penalized as to effectively eliminate them from competition.   As opposed to something like a Golden or a Springer, where those insanely impractical profuse coats are pretty much essential to place in a conformation show. Brittany people pride themselves on having dogs they can hunt with one day, clean up and brush out and show the next."
dogs,3e0p2l,homehealthgirl,3,Tue Jul 21 19:40:27 2015 UTC,"Oh awesome, thanks for that! I'm all for practicality!"
dogs,3e0p2l,homehealthgirl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:46:36 2015 UTC,"I thought that the Brittany hasn't split in type yet and is still considered a true dual dog?  It's not unheard of for a Brittany show champ to also be a field champ.  Some people might only be breeding to hunt and not to show in conformation, but that doesn't mean that there is a split in type to distinguish field lines vs show lines.  Maybe distinct bloodlines, but not distinct difference in breed type."
dogs,3e0p2l,ms_sea_cat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:16:52 2015 UTC,"You're right there's not a huge split, but I do see some difference in the hunting-only Brittanies that have almost no furnishings, while the bench/hunt Brittanies tend to have some feathering to them."

I'd be hesitant to recommend them to someone not interested in hunting with them not because of training capabilities, but from the fact that those dogs are most happy when working a job. Since she has a field lab, she more than likely can handle one, but just some food for thought. Not sure she'd want a Small Munsterlander if she doesn't like the look of Spaniels or Brittany's though. Plus they're not an easy breed to find. I know of one good breeder in NY and there's like 3 breeding bitches in all of CA!"
dogs,3e0p2l,caffeinatedlackey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:19:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, she's totally interested in hunting with them. She hunts with her lab right now, the next dog will absolutely hunt as well."
dogs,3e0p2l,caffeinatedlackey,3,Tue Jul 21 10:54:58 2015 UTC,"You mentioned she wasn't going to do the board and train route, which got me assuming this one wasn't going to be utilized the same way the lab was.   If she has experience with versatile breeds, I'd be all over the Small Munsterlander. They're pretty stubborn though but if she's got the experience and the patience, it would be an awesome dog for her.   What are the hunting environments like? Is there a lot of low brush and things that can get stuck in fur? The coat might be a turn off for your mom and if she's torn between this and say a Viszla, the sleek fur may be what wins in the end. On the plus side, I've seen plenty of people shave their Munsters with good results, but if your mom isn't interested in sitting around for an hour, picking burrs out of your dog's coat, I'd go with a Viszla."
dogs,3e0p2l,elshad85,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:15:29 2015 UTC,"Oh, I only mentioned the lack of board and train because she's planning to train this dog herself, with the help of a trainer, but not just send it away for a couple of months. I thought that was relevant because a dog that tends to be difficult to train isn't the best option. Biddability is fairly important.   The small Munsterlander is officially on the list. She has some great trainers she's worked with over the years, so I think if she hits a roadblock she'll be able to get through it. She definitely will have the time, and I think she'd appreciate the challenge.   The coat is a big challenge. She values the lab coat pretty highly, which is why she's leaning toward sleeker breeds now. There's a lot of low brush where we hunt, and there also tends to be a decent amount of ticks (Texas so minimal freezing). The low maintenance lab coat is definitely attractive to her."
dogs,3e0p2l,indecorously,3,Tue Jul 21 13:48:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if she's never trained a pointer before, she's going to want someone else to tap out to on occasion. I'm sure she can handle it, and it's an excellent challenge for both the trainer and the dog, so long as she's vigilant about it. Definitely not a dog I would recommend for a first dog, but she's well past that point.  I think the coat is going to be the deal breaker here. They're definitely much more similar to field bred goldens as far as the coat goes, so not short like a labs, but not full on fluff n' stuff like the conformation lines. If she falls in love with the Munster she can easily get away with just shaving during hunting season, but I don't know how that affects the coat (my friend shaves his during spring/summer and his coat grows back just fine).   Also, the availability might be a problem. There's a decent chance she'll have to travel a distance to get to a breeder. But on the plus side, this breed is well known for being filled with excellent breeders, so there's a good chance your closest breeder will fit the bill."

dogs,3e0e5g,INeededACoolerName,5,Tue Jul 21 00:08:13 2015 UTC,"I can tell this aggression is coming from how badly he wants to get out and the fact that he's stuck in a small space, but I don't know what to do with him.    Don't take this the wrong way, but you don't know that at all. You really don't know what's causing the aggression, and assuming that it's caused by A Thing could make this a really dangerous situation.   This is a dog who needs to be evaluated by someone with a great deal of experience, and who doesn't assume anything about the dog. It could be that he is simply not a safe dog, for any home.   The sad thing about dogs is that some of them are not a good fit for most homes. And while there may be that perfect home out there, who can take on a hard core project dog case, odds are there is not. If this shelter practices triage, so as to make room for more adoptable dogs, this dog may wind up being euthanized. It's sad, but again, if he's a dangerous dog, there is no way for them to adopt him out."
dogs,3e0e5g,Twzl,2,Tue Jul 21 01:30:00 2015 UTC,"The reason I made that assumption is because he's totally fine and loving outside. The staff had also said the same. Just issues going in/out of the kennel. But thank you, you're right, it's bad to assume things with animals. We are a no-kill shelter but I'm not sure what will happen with this dog."
dogs,3e0e5g,Twzl,4,Tue Jul 21 01:37:43 2015 UTC,"Do they have a behaviorist that they can have come in? That may be the best thing for this dog.   Some dogs do have problems going in and out of a kennel. But a dog who is being adopted out, who has problems that are bad enough to cause biting...that's a hard sell. :("
dogs,3e0e5g,Ayuno_,0,Tue Jul 21 01:46:32 2015 UTC,"Take it slow and reward only the behaviour you are looking for. So if you're 5 feet away and he's barking, jumping or charging, then you get to stay still and wait until he is at least quiet and 4 on the floor. Then move closer. If the behaviour starts again, then you stop moving again. Remember to reward the behaviour you want- if he is good, then give him progress! Feel free to take 30 minutes or whatever it is.  Once you get to the door, block it off with your foot (so it can open ~3 inches) and start to open. If he goes nuts, shut it back, wait until he's calm. Repeat as many times as necessary. Once he can be calm and you can get the door 3 inches open, stick your hand with something high value (cream cheese, hot dog pieces, etc) closed so he has to work slowly at the outside and is distracted. Lead him away from the door with it then get yourself in quickly. If he starts getting worked up, stand still and ignore him until he's four on the floor and quiet, then leash. No moving, no talking! It will just rile him up. If you get uncomfortable, you can literally throw food at his face (like, hit him relatively hard with a bunch of pieces of hot dog) and escape.  Before you get back to the building, practice sitting for treats then treat him back into his kennel. It's great to toss some on the ground and make him hunt around because it disengages the ""overwhelmed, fight or flight"" part of their brain and engages the ""nose work, where's the food, higher critical thinking"" part of their brain."

They're a more cuddly natured herding breed, and should get along well with other herding breeds like a border collie as well. They're probably a PITA to groom however, and I imagine not the most common breed to find in rescues and shelters.   A border collie or aussie mixed with a love sponge breed like a lab or spaniel of some sort could work too depending on how their temperaments are.  I think the main thing is to make sure your dog will get along well with the other dog especially in your home environment."

dogs,3e15t2,redballoons3,2,Tue Jul 21 13:12:22 2015 UTC,Thank you for this suggestion! I have seen a few Sheltie rescues around here as well -- are they of similar temperament or would I want to look at the rough/smooth collies instead? Is there a big difference between rough and smooth collies or is it just the coat?  I ask because one of my family dogs growing up was a German shepherd who thought she was a lapdog... which was great but it was a bit hard to breathe sometimes!
dogs,3e15t2,redballoons3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:46:19 2015 UTC,"I've never owned a Sheltie but from what I've read and other shelties that I've come across they're pretty similar.  Rough and smooth collies are the same, yes.   Also it'll be good to have another high energy dog with your high energy dog because they'll play at the same level. And hopefully sometimes tire each other out after a long day at the park.   Always check your local shelters too I find that dogs with collie mixed in with them are pretty common at shelters. The longer nose and long fur are good indicators."
dogs,3e12jo,RemyAlexandre,3,Tue Jul 21 03:29:35 2015 UTC,"She does well with other dogs but it takes a lot of patients and a slow introduction. She must do this at her own pace or she is not happy.   If you're living in an apartment building that allows pets, there are going to be other dogs. And not everyone is going to be on board with a dog who is reactive and possibly more than just ""reactive"".   Also because she is so young, she'd probably benefit from real, formal training. Are you willing to take her to dog class once a week, for 8 or 16 weeks or more? And work thru her problems with other dogs?   Also, this does not sound like a dog you can have off leash. Period. Not if she's not pleased with other dogs being near her."
dogs,3e12jo,Twzl,2,Tue Jul 21 10:22:21 2015 UTC,"Since you don't want a dog that barks, that rules out most toy breeds, which can be extremely yappy and difficult to train. A bichon frise is known for being a calmer companion breed and might be good for you. I don't have any experience with the breed myself but they're often recommended on this sub for novice dog owners.  I also like the idea of a cocker spaniel or cavalier king charles. I'm not sure about their availability in Canada but I think mixes are fairly common in shelters. You can also look into poodles, either mini or standard. They are smart as hell and biddable enough. Again, mixes are common in shelters.  The dog you linked to probably won't fit in with your other dogs if she has food aggression. That will set up all kinds of problems in your home that you really don't want to deal with. It sounds like she is better suited to be the only dog in a household. I would move on to another candidate."

It happened to my dog a lot when he was a puppy, and that was just on grass and dirt at the dog park. All you need to do is clean it up and make sure it stays clean and heals nicely. I put some liquid kwik stop on my pup's pads just to give it an extra layer of defense to heal. He eventually either grew out of it or his pads just toughened up.   Either way, it's not something you can control and your pup will either get tougher pads or get better motor skills and not make such sudden stops."

dogs,3dzsqj,monsieurharper,8,Mon Jul 20 21:23:38 2015 UTC,"What was she doing when the dog bit? I only ask out of curiosity - if my dog bit someone that badly for almost any reason, they would be going to the vet. If there were no medical issues, they would probably not be coming home with me from the vet.   Most dogs don't go straight from ""I'm annoyed"" to ""I'm biting."" If they do, that's a dangerous dog. Most dogs go ""I'm annoyed - I'm going to lick my lips because I'm uncomfortable. They're not leaving me alone, I'm going to raise my lip. Still not leaving me alone, I'll growl. Alright, now I'm going to air-snap. Screw it, I'm biting."" Dogs also have different bite threshholds - one dog may bite when someone tries to clip their nails, another dog may just lick their lips. Some dogs will tolerate a ton before even growling, while another may escalate to a growl as soon as they're uncomfortable.  Then there are different levels of bites. A dog that's annoyed may just touch teeth to skin as a warning. Some dogs have no bite inhibition and will go straight to a puncture. That can also happen to a dog that gets hurt or startled.   The issue with kids is that they're at eye level with most dogs and they don't read body language well, or at all. I'm constantly making sure kids don't run up to us on walks because I don't entirely trust my dog to react appropriately. Like you said, they're also clumsy so they can easily hurt a dog by accident.   What it comes down to is every dog is different. A dog that truly bites for no reason is a dangerous dog and very rare. More often it is failed supervision, failed reading of body language, a dog being cornered and scared, etc.  There are some good infographics out there about how to approach dogs, and how to recognize nervous body language.  I'm not a parent and I'm not sure where 3 year olds fall developmentally, but I wouldn't allow my hypothetical children to interact with a strange dog if they couldn't follow the info in the graphics. Moreover, I wouldn't allow them to interact with a dog unless I felt it was a very safe dog. I would be annoyed if someone let their dog rush up to a small child, too, but lashing out won't make them change their ways, it will just make them judge you harshly. I don't trust anyone when they say their dog is friendly, I wait for the dog to prove it with their body language."

dogs,3dzsqj,barkingfree,4,Mon Jul 20 22:07:38 2015 UTC,"I have to say, I think a little overprotectiveness with kids and dogs, big dogs especially, is warranted. Obviously you're going through something tragic right now, which warps your view, but I do think some caution is needed.  My dog, Nora, is a 70lb lab/rottweiler mix. She's a huge baby, she only wants to curl up in my lap and has to be tucked into bed with her blankie every night.  However, I don't trust her around kids. Kids move very differently than adults, and I think it alarms dogs to see small humans moving so fast and erratic. Nora is an absolute doll, but I would never let her actively play with my 2 year old cousin, or really any kid under 12, just because I'd be scared of the worst. I know my dog isn't vicious or aggressive, but all it takes is one kid accidentally whacking her in the face for everything to go wrong.  I do have to say though, if you and your daughter are just out in the neighborhood playing or walking around, if you keep your eye on her, she will be totally fine. When strange dogs approach, you might pull her back or let the owners know that she isn't comfortable around dogs, and usually people are super quick to pull their dogs back. That also means, though, that you should keep a close eye on your daughter. Chances of a serious dog bite are pretty low, but you can mitigate that by watching her closely when there are animals around. I think that applies to most things, though, like you would watch her closely playing on a playground or eating at a restaurant.  I'm so sorry, this all sounds so alarmist, I promise it isn't as huge of an issue as I'm making it out to be. All I want to pass on is that a little bit of extra caution around dogs and kids is definitely warranted, but you don't need to panic when a strange dog comes around, especially if it's on-leash."
dogs,3dzsqj,SharpStiletto,5,Mon Jul 20 21:39:53 2015 UTC,"but you don't need to panic every time a strange dog comes around, as long as it's on-leash.   You don't need to panic ever, at all. Panic is the last feeling you want to be having, especially around an off-leash dog."
dogs,3dzsqj,barkingfree,4,Mon Jul 20 22:11:58 2015 UTC,"You're right, sorry, my wording was poor. That's also a good thing to keep in mind, dogs pick up on things like fear and anger way easier than humans do, freaking out and grabbing your daughter away will only arouse a dog."
dogs,3dzsqj,SharpStiletto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:22:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the fresh perspective barkingfree. I'll definitely keep a close eye on her - we frequent the park often and there are always cute and sometimes not so cute dogs that come around and my daughter absolutely loves them, and that's where I get so nervous. I'm sure the panicky feeling will fade, anyone who's been in a car accident before panics every time the brakes are pressed, and I'm sure it's something similar :)"
dogs,3dzsqj,Twzl,4,Mon Jul 20 21:50:49 2015 UTC,"I love seeing children that have been properly taught to interact with animals. Unfortunately, this is not as common as one might think, even among kids who’ve been raised with animals but especially those that haven’t.  I have friends who are scared of dogs and it saddens me to see how they have passed on their fears to their children. I do not believe that over-protecting them keeps them any safer. I do believe that teaching them how to handle themselves, so they can feel calm, confident and happy - yet respectful and mindful, makes all the difference.  I’ve often had to stop, correct and teach children who’ve approached wanting to interact or touch my dogs because they go about it the totally wrong way. That’s dangerous stuff right there.  Bear in mind that dogs, as well as other animals, can pick up your feelings of fear and nervousness and react to that. Consequently, your feelings at the moment are not conducive to positive interactions. The fact that you’ve posted here is great, because you’re taking the right steps to deal with the situation.  Children and dogs should be supervised and adult intervention is required to guide the kids, explain things to them and make sure the dog is able to retreat to a safe place. One of the rules I have at home is that if the dog retires to his playpen or bed, it means he must be left alone - child is not allowed to follow and bug dog.   Often, people gush over the cuteness of doggie and kiddie and ignore the body language and signals of distress a dog is giving out. Then the dog has to escalate his reactions (because he wants to be left alone) and if growling has been discouraged or ignored, the next stage can result in a nasty scare or injury to the child.  Then there are dogs that have issues with children and have no business being around them, but I think that in most cases the problem is what I’ve described above - a lack of awareness (of the dog’s body language) and supervision.  Personally, I’d suggest you get more familiar with dogs yourself. Do you have a trusted friend with a friendly dog? If not, maybe a dog trainer (look for a force-free one) could help; you’d be paying for their time but it would be worth it with the right person. Explain your situation and have them introduce you to their dog, talk to you about him, how to handle yourself around dogs, etc.   Once you are feeling comfortable and confident in your ability to discern between friendly and non-friendly dogs and how to behave and react in different situations, you’ll be able to teach your daughter yourself and / or with the help of your friend or the trainer. Empower yourself and empower her. : )  Edit: a few words"
dogs,3dzsqj,solefald,2,Mon Jul 20 22:10:30 2015 UTC,"It's good to be aware of what a dog can do, but it's also good to not teach your daughter to be afraid of dogs. You want her to grow up to be confident around them...for all you know, one day when she's an adult, she may live with one!  As much as I love dogs, and am comfortable around them, I never pet a strange dog. People are often clueless about their dog and how tolerant they are of strangers.   I own safe dogs. And I have people allow their kids to run into my dog's face. And I tell them, yeah he's ok with it, but ask, ask, ask.   Often when a kid gets bitten by a family dog, it turns out that no one was supervising the dog, and worse, no one trained the dog. People don't think that they need to actually do these things and the problem is, if the dog is around kids, they absolutely can't skimp on it. Even when it's a little dog.   Anyway, please don't assume that all dogs are bad, or aggressive, or biters. Most are not. And some really are genuinely good with kids."
dogs,3dzsqj,AbsentLight12,2,Tue Jul 21 01:26:01 2015 UTC,"Your insecurities are going to do more disservice to your child. You should teach her how to behave around dogs instead of shunning away from each and every dog.   My ex wife is a great example of this. We have 1 kid together and she has 3 more with her current husband, so I see them all the time because of our son. Anyway, my dog is always with me, so they see him all the time too. He is cool as a cucumber, no aggression issues of any kind, calm as a rock and extremely well socialized and completely ignores the kids. Anyway, for a while there every time they wanted to come and pet him she would start yelling at them ""NO! DO NOT TOUCH IT! IT WILL BITE YOU!"", so now every time they see my dog, they run away screaming and crying, even when he just sits in my truck. And just yesterday I saw them react the same way to a tiny Yorkie that some girl was walking on a leash. I don't think thats a healthy reaction to a dog. None of them were ever bitten, but their helicopter parent convinced them that dogs are dangerous."

Meanwhile another one trotted over nicely but proceeded to attack my pup. Again I had to intervene and shoo off the second dog.  The owner did nothing to stop or retrieve her dogs, I had to scare/chase them off. The only comment I got was that her dogs don't like puppies.  No apology.... No attempt to leash or control them.... just, ”is your dog a puppy? Yeah, ”fluffy” doesn't like puppies”  I was beyond pissed (considering how important early socialization is and how negative experiences can really set your pup back). I told her that if her dog has a problem with puppies, perhaps she should keep it leashed. Now I admit that I was pissed, so I probably didn't have the best tone of voice, but I didn't curse at her or anything.

Don't do it, it's a puppy mill.  Seriously if you're talking about a dog you found on a website like, for example, Greenfield Puppies, it's an Amish puppy mill."
dogs,3e0fhk,Synaxis,11,Tue Jul 21 00:43:25 2015 UTC,"This x 1000. I'd suspect a puppy mill no matter what, if a breeder was willing to ship puppies out of state and was intentionally breeding a ""designer breed"", but that suspicion quadruples when I see ""Pennsylvania"", because that is known to be one of the states with the largest number of awful puppy mills in the U.S."
dogs,3e0fhk,VividLotus,2,Tue Jul 21 00:54:38 2015 UTC,But who runs the website if the Amish don't have anything to do with electricity? And holy crud do they have a huge variety of puppies available. I don't understand how people see sites like this and think it is an okay place to buy a puppy.

Absolutely they'll work with you.   It could be that the puppies on that particular site are listed by middlemen, I don't know, but the fact that there is a HUGE variety of designer breeds, mixed breeds, and way off-standard purebreds and almost all of them are from Pennsylvania - especially Lancaster and Chester counties, where there are huge Amish populations - definitely point to those puppies coming from Amish mills."
dogs,3e0fhk,Synaxis,2,Tue Jul 21 04:04:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about the Amish, went through Amish country once and thought about buying something but everything was outrageous in price.   I never knew there was a huge puppy mill population in Pennsylvania. I feel like the conditions would be rough to be mass producing dogs, not like the people care.  When you buy from the puppy mills are they actually registered AKC? There is a petstore in my home town that has a wall of puppies that are AKC and I just don't see how the AKC hasn't put a stop to certain breeders when they have litter after litter."
dogs,3e0fhk,indecorously,4,Tue Jul 21 04:09:08 2015 UTC,"Yep, Amish puppy mills are an issue. Just a taste. I volunteer with a horse rescue and the place where I lesson has mostly rescues. The place I volunteer has standardbreds and the place I ride has saddlebreds, both of which are very popular breeds for the Amish to use as road horses. I've done a little research on the Amish since I started volunteering, you know, just to see where these horses came from. Puppy mills came up in that research.  Those puppies absolutely can be AKC registered. Absolutely. The AKC is a registry, most of its revenue comes from litter registrations. Terrible as it is, puppy mills are pretty significant contributors to that. They certainly could refuse to register litters bred by mills, but the AKC kind of needs money to run."

It's important to note that no one is responsibly breeding ""boxadors"". That's really just another lab mutt. They're a dime a dozen at a shelter. The offspring of such vastly different dogs will have so much variation in temperament and appearance that there's no possible way to responsibly pick homes for them."

You don't get this magical mix of the best of both worlds. You can also get the worst of both breeds. A person suited for a lab isn't really the same person that's suited for a boxer. They're very different breeds.   As stated below, a shittily bred mix will never be as healthy as a well-bred purebred. If health is a top priority, then a responsible breeder is the way to go. What I think you're referring to is hybrid vigor, but that concept was never meant to justify the breeding of two dog breeds together. It was defined in the context of pariah dogs, or dogs with such mixed ancestry that an individual breed cannot be pinned down."

As far as mixes being healthier goes, that's a giant lie. A lot of people like to go around tooting the hybrid vigor horn, but very few people understand what the actual term means. A pure bred can be just as healthy as a mix and a mix can have just as many health problems, if not more, than a pure bred. Do not get drawn into a cross because you think you're going to get a healthier dog by default."

Others just look like curlier-tailed, slightly smush-faced beagles, and have a total beagle personality. Then you get some with a real ""worst of both worlds"" who have all the health problems of a pug due to their body/face shape, and all the over-the-top energy and loud hound bay of a beagle.  I have nothing whatsoever against mixed-breed dogs, but I think people who expect a mix of two breeds to have only the best traits of each breed are really setting themselves up for disappointment."

But yeah, pretty much every other one I've met was either still at one of the two breed extremes in temperament and/or physical state, or perhaps even more commonly, a ""worst of both worlds"" situation. I can recall one who had extreme problems with hip dysplasia and luxating patella, breathing issues, and was also a crazy and very loud barker.  I actually happen to have both a pug and a hound, and I love them both, but I don't think I'd ever want a puggle."

dogs,3e0fhk,VividLotus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:09:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, agreed on both counts. I think it would be hugely admirable if pug breeders ignored the AKC and started turning pugs back into what they looked like 50-100+ years ago (when their body and face shape looked more like that of a present-day Boston than like today's pugs). But just deciding to randomly mix pugs and beagles is not the right way to address pug health problems-- especially because a lot of people doing this kind of breeding seem to fall into the BYB category, and therefore probably aren't exactly in possession of the best breeding stock or interested in doing genetic testing."

However, a boxador is not a highly mixed breed dog. It is a boxer crossed with a lab and is likely to be prone to the health problems of both boxers and labs. Add to that, it would be extremely difficult to find anyone who's breeding boxadors who does the proper health checks on the dogs they breed. If health issues are your primary concern, you would be much better off finding a reputable breeder of either boxers or labs. Reputable breeders health test all of their potential breeding stock and will only breed dogs that pass all of their health clearances.  I am 99.9% sure you will not find a boxador breeder who does the necessary health checks on their dogs.  Also, I did a quick Google search for boxador breeders, just out of curiosity. About half of the first page of results is companies in PA. They are all either puppy mills or puppy mill brokers."

dogs,3dxses,expibotou,4,Tue Jul 21 08:49:01 2015 UTC,"There's no real solid definition of energy levels, it's more of a general sense of how much exercise a dog needs.  It can also be relative within a breed. For example, a low energy husky is still likely need more exercise than a high energy Pekingese.  Energy level can also be higher or lower depending on the dog's conditioning. Kinda like how someone who runs 5 miles everyday is going to have more energy than someone who sits on their couch all day. It sounds like your yorkie is very well conditioned and has come to rely on a higher amount of exercise every day. Relative to other yorkies, yes, I would say you have a high energy dog. What I can't say though, is if your dog naturally has a higher energy level, or if his energy level has increased as a result of the amount if exercise he's getting.  Regardless, it sounds like he's getting a good amount of exercise, and as long as he seems happy with it, by all means, keep doing what you're doing!  In general, the highest energy dogs tend to be in the 30-70 pound weight range, give or take a few pounds. Most of the working breeds fall in this range, because they need to be big enough to do their job, but small enough to not be carrying around more weight than necessary. The giant breeds and the small companion breeds are usually pretty low energy. However, some small dogs, like the terriers, are still pretty high energy. Jack Russell terriers are famous for basically being the real-life version of the Energizer bunny.  So, yes, size does play a role, but it's not the only factor."

I would say that your Yorkie is moderately active. A truly highly active dog would be something like a husky, who is just impossible to tire out. A dog with really high energy levels wouldn't be satisfied with just an hour and a half of exercise. They would want 10+ miles logged per day at least. I do have to say, though, that your yorkie is quite the athlete, and you're doing a great job of keeping up with him!"

That said, you can certainly train your dogs muscles just like you would your own, building endurance and such.   As far as feeding goes, there's a good rule of thumb to assess proper weight: hold your hand out slack and go with the fingers of your other hands over the bones of the back of your hands. Now compare that to how it feels like going over the ribs of your dog. You should feel a similar amount of 'stuff' over the bones of the ribs. If you can feel the bones less or more well than on your hand it means your dog is fatter or skinnier than he should be. That said, this is a rule of thumb so please have common sense about feeding your dog properly."
dogs,3dxses,imoanlehcar,2,Mon Jul 20 15:16:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed. And going off your body condition scoring comment. For the commercially available foods out there that are either geared toward ""high energy"" dogs or have feeding instructions for the same are typically, supposedly, aimed for those working dogs that are burning an inordinate amount of calories-think agility, flyball, rescue, police dogs etc. In my opinion, from experience, start with the average calorie feeding recommendations and if you notice a loss in weight and/or body condition as afrael described then feed more.

dogs,3dxses,treacledormouse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:44:25 2015 UTC,"it's mainly about how much a dog will bug you and/or misbehave if not given the amount of exercise they need (both mental and physical)   Do you know of any way of telling if you're giving your dog enough mental stimulation as distinct from physical exercise?  I ask because I suffer from a chronic illness that causes periodic 'brain fog' and I avoid training with him in those times because I worry I'd be so bad at it, it'd be counterproductive.   Alternatively, does anyone know of mental stimulation I could do with him when my thinking is cloudy and slow?"
dogs,3dxses,OneRTwoNs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:32:21 2015 UTC,"Hmm well I think it comes from just knowing your dog well. Every dog is different. Some dogs tend to bark at everything, some dogs sit down and stare at you, some dogs just get super duper persistant at asking you for fetch. It's easy to start recognising the signs for your dog in a time where you're sure he's getting enough physical exercises, but not sure if he's getting enough mental exercise, since that's a situation where you'll be most likely to see signs. That said, while I do believe every dog will benefit from mental exercise, not every dog needs the same amount of it.  Doggy puzzles are excellent to do with your dog when you're kinda out of it. They key is to introduce the puzzle when you're feeling ok, so that you can work through any frustration or fear the dog might have with the puzzle, as well as making sure the dog will not just try to destroy it. If your dog knows how the solution works and is not inclined to damage the puzzle, all you will have to do is put food in it and make sure you take the puzzle away at the proper time. Hopefully that is doable for you if you're in a 'brain fog'. To start with, look up 'dog bottle game', that's something cheap and easy you can build yourself and doesn't really get old soon for the dog."

dogs,3dxses,goldfish_king,2,Tue Jul 21 20:32:43 2015 UTC,No size definitely does not matter when it's about dog energy levels.
dogs,3dxses,one8sevenn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:40:54 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of different factors that go into a dog's energy level, but the biggest one is just individual variation.  We sometimes like to think that breeds are like cookie cutters--that if we put the same gene pool in, we'll get the same product out every time.  But variation within breed is often broad enough that it's not uncommon to see ""atypical"" behaviors for a breed.  That said, here are some general rules of thumb for energy:  *Big: low energy; small: high energy  *Terrier breeds: high energy; guardian breeds: low energy  *Young: high energy; old: low energy  Rather than worrying about what energy ""category"" your dog falls into, just work on figuring out what works for him.  If he's wearing you out, also think about games that let you stand still while he does the running around: fetch, obstacle courses, flirt pole, etc.  As far as feeding, dogs vary so much in their food needs that it's best to just watch their weight and make small adjustments until their weight is stable at a healthy place.  Even a big, active dog can need less food than it says on the bag because of its individual metabolism.  tl;dr: Get to know your dog!  Do what works for him :)"

dogs,3dx6a7,William_Harzia,2,Mon Jul 20 10:58:42 2015 UTC,The two dogs are separated in different rooms (as they don't have kennels in the house because they have never been aggressive). The owners are coming home today after they backed out on putting down Gup so they will make the decision when they get home but I think giving him away or sending him to a shelter is out of the question with this episode.
dogs,3dx6a7,danaofdoom,4,Mon Jul 20 17:11:32 2015 UTC,"I own a doggy daycare and I have witnessed totally nice, calm, friendly dogs suddenly go mental the second a fight breaks out.   In one recent incident for example, a relatively new dog named Lennie got snapped at and spooked by an alpha. He bolted, and for some reason this triggered a mass attack. Within two seconds he had four dogs chasing him, and when they cornered him they, and some other dogs attacked him. There was a literal dogpile on poor Lennie, and the attendants basically had to wade in and toss the dogs off of him. It was nuts, because these dogs are all nice, temperament tested animals, and yet it was like someone threw a switch in their brains and all at once they became psychotic. It all happened so fast we had to review the surveillance footage to figure out what happened.  Anyway, point is, sometimes when one dog attacks another, other dogs will join in instinctively like they can't even help it. Sounds like the pug when on the offensive for who knows what reason, and that triggered the bulldog's attack, so I don't think the owners should necessarily hold it against him.   PS Lennie was fine. He just ended up with a scratch or two and a small puncture on his leg."

The bulldog to check out his wounds, and the pug to see if something is wrong with her that might have caused her to act aggressively. It's just so rare for a pug to be aggressive in the first place, and even rarer for a dog that has presumably lived happily with other dogs for many, many years to suddenly snap to that degree.   Hopefully the vet can figure something out. If they can, I'd urge your friends to consider surrendering the pug to a pug rescue (they won't care that she's old) instead of euthanizing her, assuming that she has a treatable condition. Either way, in the mean time I would not let the remaining two dogs in a room together."
dogs,3dx6a7,Sib_Sy,3,Mon Jul 20 17:18:50 2015 UTC,"I've read cases where one dog constantly bullied the others until the others finally snapped and killed the bully.  I wonder if Roxy had been the aggressor over time and they ganged up on her.    The other thing that I can think of is that Gup has some underlying medical condition (liver problems, brain tumor) that ramped up his aggression and the other dog just followed along and things spiraled out of control.    Without knowing a lot of background info about their pack structure and interactions, you won't be able to make an educated guess.  I am really sorry this happened to Roxy and I know how upsetting it is when you are pet sitting and something happens to one of the pets.    I would strongly suggest having a qualified behaviorist evaluate Thor.  He may have not been the instigator but rather an accessory due to becoming overly stimulated by the Pug's aggressive actions.  That is still assuming, based on the video, that the Pug instigated.  Without knowing what went on before the video started, it's just an assumption.  If they are willing to give Thor a chance, they should have him evaluated and perhaps keep him as an only dog."

That was my first thought upon seeing that one of the dogs was a pug mix. While I don't know what this dog is mixed with, and while every dog is an individual, it's just so rare to see a truly aggressive pug. When I've encountered pugs who will even so much as seriously growl at another dog or person, it's generally because something is physically wrong with them."

dogs,3dxzf5,LittleTarsier,18,Mon Jul 20 13:29:58 2015 UTC,"The ""puppy stuff"" doesn't include counter-surfing as a default, this is only happening because he is being allowed to roam the house unsupervised and the more he does it the more he learns how rewarding it is... so that needs to stop now.  When they are younger I use a portable crate but by that age I usually have them tethered where I'm sitting and I'll pass the leash or seat onto someone else if I get up to go to the loo or help out. Puppy has his bed, toys and water within leash radius and is expected to stay there.  Puppy is not allowed to explore or roam the house. When puppy is older and knows how to behave nicely, he's no longer tethered, but by then, remaining calmly in his place or thereabouts has become the default behaviour. By then he also responds to commands like ""stay"", ""on your bed"" and ""leave"".  It is natural that older dogs will not want to play with a puppy or for so long, it is your responsibility to arrive with a well-exercised puppy and provide for his entertainment (toys, chews, play, walks, etc.) as well as keeping him from bugging the other dogs while you are there. Structure and control his play time with the other dogs. If ending it brings on the barking, end play and go out for a walk immediately, before returning to the house.   Training sessions while you are there would be a good idea, to train your pup and so your relatives can see you addressing the situation / in action. Have you worked on ""capturing calmness""? (Kikopup has a great tutorial or two on this.  I'm a big dog person. You have to be more attentive, strict and careful with larger breeds in all sorts of situations, it is part of the parcel. Preventing bad behaviours from becoming habits is really important; change the way you do things to avoid them from happening."
dogs,3dxzf5,SharpStiletto,7,Mon Jul 20 14:44:14 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest with you, even I as an owner hated my puppy at that age. They're brats, and just GIANT pain in the butts.  Your MIL and other family members aren't the owners of the puppy, they don't HAVE to enjoy him, and honestly they probably know he's going to grow up but at the moment he is really annoying and bad. Maybe in the future when you visit, it might be advisable to not take puppy, and give them a little break. If you do live together, then maybe pup needs to be supervised more often and on-leash in the house so you can observe him more closely and correct the behaviours that are going on.  And ultimately, the biggest thing you can probably do is make obvious moves to correct these behaviours. Take an obedience class with him once a week, or private lessons with a trainer who can help with loose-leash walking and managing his size, as well as helping with the counter surfing. It's easy to tell your family that you're 'working on it' but from my experience enrolling in an obedience class on a regular basis (my pup is 10 months old and on his fourth obedience course) really helped my puppy to become a model citizen.  My parents have a quite small older dog and he still doesn't like my pup, but we have to respect that dog and ensure that my puppy is managed and either on leash or contained somewhere else so the older dog is comfortable. Some dogs just won't enjoy the bounciness of your puppy, and you can't just laugh it off and say 'it's him being a puppy', because those small dogs can be legitimately fearful and it's your job as an owner to ensure your dog is well-liked in your social circles by ensuring that you do all you can to improve behaviour and to respect those with more seniority (like small dogs who have been in the family for longer, and who really don't want to be playing with young puppies)  The good news? Puppies grow up a lot faster than kids do, and with a solid effort put into obedience classes, regular exercise, play dates, etc. you can really start to see an improvement within even a couple of months.  Alternatively, EXHAUSTING your puppy beyond all measure prior to interacting with your family members may be ideal as well, nothing like a napping tired puppy."

I completely trained my family dog on my own and I've been training my pup as well, it's just slow going. Especially now that he's in his bratty stage, but he's definitely improving.   One of the family dogs hates him, absolutely, so we don't bring him to that house anymore, but the other family dog loves playing with him, but not always. That's when the barking starts, when she doesn't want  to play."
dogs,3dxzf5,sincerely-sacha,7,Mon Jul 20 14:09:00 2015 UTC,"Then maybe you need to bring a crate or ex-pen with you, and if the barking starts he needs to be put in another room to calm down.  It is costly, but it's been 100% worth it for me. It's also been helpful to have someone else on the outside who can look at what I'm training my dog and give pointers, because as owners sometimes we aren't as critical as we need to be, or sometimes we don't have the experience of handling multiple dogs the way a lot of trainers do and so we're actually missing out on a concept that could spring our dog forward in terms of training and really allow them to advance.  I'm currently taking an advanced class, and the owner had no idea the other day, but the trainer had a chance to observe the dog during a sit-stay for 10 minutes where the owner was out of the room. The dog turns out to have major separation anxiety that wasn't noticed by the owner, and in fact she was encouraging it, but without the trainer observing what the dog was doing without the owner being there it wasn't easy to confirm something like that. The owner now has a set of exercises to practice, and has a better idea of how she can approach her dog's training.  It's expensive, but dogs aren't cheap, and 200$ is a small price to pay for peace in the family."
dogs,3dxzf5,brab74,7,Mon Jul 20 14:15:24 2015 UTC,"Training - lots of training.  When you can't watch him, don't give him an opportunity to be bad.  Counter surfing needs to stop now.  Crate or confine him when you can't watch him.  I'm sure your MIL understands what puppies are like.  Since she had a dog of your dog's breed, perhaps she can give you some advice on training.  She may appreciate the gesture and will show that you are interested in training your puppy.  Maybe your pup needs to stay home from family visits until he's better trained."

Stealing food from the counter is beyond puppy stuff - that's bad behavior.  It does not make for a welcome house guest.     Once he is able to do things like that, it will become increasingly difficult to stop him in the future because counter surfing is self-rewarding.  Crate or confine him when you can't carefully watch him, especially while at someone else's house.    Dogs are situational - he may understand that something is ""wrong"" at home, but it will take more training to understand that it's ""wrong"" somewhere else."

If he counter surfs inside... then he is leashed to your waist at all times. These kinds of issues don't magically go away you need to train them away.

Timing is important, so unless you want to sit next to your dog with a treat bag all day waiting for a plane to pass over, find an audio or video file. It also helps if you have a subwoofer, as sometimes it's the deep bass/house rattling noise that the dog is reacting to.  Here's a good video about counter-conditioning.

They don't know the dictionary definition of the word 'sit' - they just know that when you say 'sit,' they plant their butt and get a treat for it. This is the same for any language. You could use complete nonsense in any language. They'll associate the sound with the action.  For non-command interaction, body language and tone of speech are where it's at. The dog doesn't understand words it has not been taught to relate to other things, so it doesn't matter. A language they have never heard before would be just as much gibberish as words in the language they hear daily that have no meaning to them."
dogs,3dzzal,Synaxis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:18:00 2015 UTC,"I think they do well with both, but read body language better and get cues from tone as well.  But no, they do not 'fully' rely on body language and tone alone (unless you train that way).  They can recognize commands even if they are devoid of tone and body language."
dogs,3dzzal,CaptainHelium,-2,Mon Jul 20 22:34:16 2015 UTC,I've heard that dogs understand German really well but I don't know if this has any truth to it
dogs,3dzzal,gzzvv,4,Mon Jul 20 23:15:55 2015 UTC,"Some people train dogs using German commands - it is not that they understand the language any better, just that they have been well trained to respond to those words as commands."
dogs,3dzzal,SharpStiletto,3,Mon Jul 20 23:20:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in my experience it's more so that the dog doesn't hear it's commands in daily conversation. Which I only agree with to a point... The way that I say ""sit"" in conversation isn't close to the way I say ""sit"" when I'm asking my dog to sit. So it has its merits, but I'm not sure I buy into it 100%."
dogs,3dzzal,court67,2,Mon Jul 20 23:23:09 2015 UTC,"I'd heard it is so that other people can't instruct the dog, but what you say makes sense and I agree with you on command words in conversation.   Having said that, I taught my first dog to eliminate with the cue ""Hurry up!"" as per the instructions of a book I was using at the time. Over time I discovered that these were the exact words that I'd automatically use when I wanted my dog to stop dawdling or catch up with me, with naturally the right inflection, to boot! Ack! It was difficult to train myself out of saying that - this was long before I knew I could retrain a cue for the dog!  These days I have French words for elimination commands; Indra has two and Stella one."
dogs,3dzzal,SharpStiletto,2,Mon Jul 20 23:34:41 2015 UTC,"I thought it was also because the german commands sound so different from each other so it doesnt cause any confusion.  For example ""stay"" and ""stand"" can sound very alike.    I'm pretty sure this is why some people will also use a combination of french and german commands.  I mean not both, but theyll use the german for 'heel' and the french for 'sit', etc."
dogs,3dzzal,CaptainHelium,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:45:47 2015 UTC,"Do you speak German and know this for a fact? If not I'll ask my SO when he gets home, I'm curious about this!  Also, do you find ""stay"" and ""stand"" to be too similar for use? I use both of these and haven't had a problem - there again, I have not used ""stand"" from a distance... Hmm... I hadn't considered this and will have to test this out at some point. Thanks!  Similar sounding words is something I do consider when choosing commands. I wondered whether ""drop it!"" and ""take it!"" (a la Victoria Stillwell) sounded too similar, especially if you also have ""get it"" and ""find it""... or do all those ""it""s not matter?!?  I have three French commands and three German ones; the rest are English and hand signals. With one command it was to avoid a similar sounding word and because it rolls off the tongue easier but another reason is for my own (and others') amusement!"
dogs,3dzzal,SharpStiletto,2,Tue Jul 21 07:41:31 2015 UTC,"Drop it and take it likely won't ever be a problem because you'll never ask for them in the same circumstance, ya know? If you're asking the dog to take something, then there's a good chance they won't already have something in their mouth. I have quite a few commands that are almost purely contextual cues."

dogs,3dzzal,SharpStiletto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:27:13 2015 UTC,"I trained my second dog in German, but because I tend to use words like ""stay"" and ""wait"" and what-ever when I don't even mean them as a command necessarily, and so the meaning gets watered down. I just chose German because that's the language of the country I am living in at the moment, though, not because I knew/thought it was especially good for commands. Though, the commands are a bit more distinct sounding than English ones (from each other)."
dogs,3dyhlu,dam360,19,Mon Jul 20 15:52:30 2015 UTC,"Yes. He's young and cute and probably could find a new home in a day, a few days at most.  You could definitely try returning him to the shelter, or if you live in an area where shelters are overcrowded, try reaching out to a local Jack Russell rescue or another established private rescue.  Puppies tend to be rehomed relatively quickly.  You can probably teach him not to treat your children as prey, but it will require intense socialization, training, and time on your part, with a huge upheaval in your schedules and activity levels.  From this post, it doesn't sound like you'll be willing to do that.  There is nothing wrong with doing what's best for the pup when you know you can't give it the life it deserves."
dogs,3dyhlu,orangetangerine,10,Mon Jul 20 15:58:38 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with the above. There's nothing wrong in recognizing that you didn't know the specifics of the breed, didn't understand the commitment, and have other goals in life that mean you likely won't be able to give this dog a good life. It's better to realize this when the dog is a pup and more easily adoptable, versus as an adult dog or even a senior. I got my pup when he was 3 months old, so no one will have an issue taking a pup that age.  You're being responsible as an owner at this point by realizing early that this isn't going to work, and trying your best to find a better situation for you and the pup.  If this is what you need to do, I wish you and the pup all the best, and in the future if you are ever looking for a dog that is more well-matched to your living situation don't hesitate to ask for recommendations. There's a wealth of knowledge to be found in the users on this subreddit, and so I hope you don't give up on dogs entirely. Just because this little fellow isn't right for you, doesn't mean another dog won't be.  It's kind of like dating a really cute girl, and realizing that you both want different things, and letting her go because you want her to have a better life. Doesn't mean you won't find the right one for you, somewhere down the road :)"

Doesn't mean you won't find the right one for you, somewhere down the road :)   This is spot-on.  While I never ""dated"" dogs (yeah that's weird) I got to live with quite a few before I got to own one myself.  I lived with an intact 1 year old beagle with intense exercise requirements, then a 2 year old papillon/pom ""pursedog"" who was attached to his owner, an adult shih-tzu/pug mix who was incredibly lazy, and I helped a close friend adopt some sort of collie or spaniel mutt who was still in puppy stages.  Each dog showed me what I did and didn't want in a pup so it helped me really understand what I would be capable of handling when I finally got my own.  In the end, we ended up getting a dog who we had to put a lot of work into as a puppy, but we knew what we were getting since we looked for weeks instead of impulsively adopting the first cute dog we saw.  As an adult dog, she is an incredibly friendly companion to pretty much everybody (definitely the chihuahua in her), is small and compact for us renters, and has a coat and build conducive to sleeping on the couch all day or doing intense activity like hiking.  It works well with our city lifestyle and guarantees that she can be adequately cared for."
dogs,3dyhlu,orangetangerine,5,Mon Jul 20 20:23:00 2015 UTC,"There's no shame in saying you can't provide the best life for a dog. As /u/orangetangerine said, he's still young and cute and will be easy to adopt. It sounds like you guys might be better suited to a companion breed, like a pug or a miniature poodle.  I returned a dog that didn't fit with my lifestyle before I found  Charlie. He was also a JRT mix with a LOT of energy and some food aggression, so I couldn't just give him a kong or a bone to distract him because he'd go nuts over it. It was really hard giving him back even though he was driving us crazy... I recommend doing it sooner rather than later to save yourselves some heartbreak."
dogs,3dyhlu,becomingk,5,Mon Jul 20 16:15:22 2015 UTC,Can you return him to the shelter? Or contact a rescue? What country are you in?  To be honest I'm surprised and disappointed that the shelter let you have him in the first place.  http://www.therealjackrussell.com/breed/baddog.php

A friend of mine and her family adopted a JRT from their local shelter in the Sacramento area after just one visit with the dog, which was said to be ""so mellow and laid-back."" Um, yes, until the dog got home and felt comfortable, then it exploded into a ball of fury.   I posted in her Facebook thread that she should visit the dog more or do some research at least, but she is kind of a collector of kids and pets, so she paid no attention to any advice, then got the dog. :/"
dogs,3dyhlu,je_taime,5,Mon Jul 20 20:34:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that energy level is going to skyrocket. If you can't or aren't willing to also force yours to skyrocket, or pay someone else to exercise the heck out of him, I would take him back."
dogs,3dyhlu,therobbo91,3,Mon Jul 20 16:12:17 2015 UTC,"The one thing that I would not be worried about is a dog with strong prey drive being aggressive to children. There's simply no correlation. Occasionally, dogs with an extreme prey drive experience ""predatory drift"" and get aggressive to other dogs who are so tiny that they don't really register as ""dog' on that dog's radar, but even that is far from a given. Like any dog who was bred to hunt, one of my dogs has an incredible prey drive, but plays appropriately and gently with children and small dogs.  Having said that, though, if you've made up your mind that this is an untenable situation for you, the time to act is now. Rehoming a dog who's still in the tiny and cute part of puppyhood is generally way easier than rehoming an adult dog or a dog who's in the terrible-toddler phase of being a puppy. If you got him from a no-kill shelter and they have space, they may be glad to take him back. If you got him from a kill shelter, or if the shelter is full or nearly so, I'd simply contact a breed-specific rescue. Many have waiting lists for puppies (or just a whole lot of people who are eager for one but don't want to buy), so I'm sure he would be adopted instantly within a rescue situation."
dogs,3dyhlu,VividLotus,3,Mon Jul 20 18:19:31 2015 UTC,What is exceptionally weird is that the shelter didn't give you a basic run down of the breed and verify that you could handle it - usually they're quite diligent about it.  Or you lied when they asked and are now finding out they were right.
dogs,3dyhlu,oddible,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:23:29 2015 UTC,The shelter told us he was a shepherd mix. That's all we knew about him.

Though reading it online and experiencing it IRL are two different things, I think I've read enough to change my mind. One thing I will do though, is contact my breeder. From what I've gathered though, it may not have been an elite breeder that everyone here insists dogs should come from."

dogs,3dvu20,LilithSiren,30,Mon Jul 20 00:59:11 2015 UTC,"No stores! No breeder that cares about where their dogs go would be ok with not placing each puppy with an appropriate owner. It's like the bare minimum measure of whether they are shitty or not. Good breeders also will take a dog back at any time for the life of the dog. Not for a refund, but because they take responsibility for the lives they produce and don't want them going to someone not suited to their dogs.  Look at breed specific rescues. Poodles are in pretty high demand and low supply so there aren't a ton, but they will be easier to find in poodle rescue than in a shelters. Poodles in shelters generally either get scooped up immediately or sent out to breed rescue."
dogs,3dvu20,olliepots,19,Mon Jul 20 01:05:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah pleeeease no stores.  ANY dog that comes from a store is a puppy mill dog.  The only exception is if the store is an adoption center for a local rescue, in which it will be fairly obvious."

Shelter dogs are not purpose bred for work.  Shelter dogs do not receive socialization to people, other dogs, loud noises, and strange surfaces in line with what I want from birth.  Shelter dogs are not temperament-tested by a professional with more than a decade of experience producing exactly the kind of dog that will fit my needs.  I already did the ""save a shelter dog"" thing. I didn't get a dog that was workable out of the deal. I got a sweet pet whose legs are going out at six years of age. I'm mad at the person who bred her. Very mad.  When I got a second dog from a reputable breeder, it was because I knew I wouldn't find what I was looking for in shelters. You only get so many dogs in your life."

I intended to get a pup from a shelter for my last dog but did not find any that were suitable, so I went down the breeder route. The socialisation and exposure they receive as young puppies is so important, particularly with guarding breeds. I want a dog I can mould, work with and trust - not a liability.

Even in my local animal control shelter, in a shitty part of the shitty South, right at this very moment there are dogs of tons of different breeds-- and only a few pit bulls. There are working breed dogs, there are tiny toy dogs of several different breeds, there are brand new puppies just now old enough to go home, there are senior dogs."

That is how one of my friends who lives in Seattle got her two awesome chihuahuas, actually.  Now that I think about it, I should see if I can start a program to fly hounds from the South to places like WA. I lived in WA for many years and I think I hardly ever saw a single hound in shelters, but down here in the South, amazing quantities of hounds (including puppies) get euthanized every week.   Edit: the people who downvote comments like this one are seriously sick. If you honestly hate the idea of people adopting from shelters that much, then please don't ever get another dog, because you obviously don't actually care about dogs."

Some go to Portland. Have not seen any hounds yet. Lots of huskies though.   We could use better spay-neuter programs where I live. The main issue we have is with a certain portion of the population over-breeding Chihuahuas and other small breeds and selling them on Facebook, of all places. Occasionally people have approached me asking to breed to my dogs, which I find revolting. Lack of education seems to be the root of the problem."

I had to drive 2 hours to get a HOUND.  Most people can't handle and don't want a hound anymore than a pit or chi.  Sad fact is that the vast, overwhelming majority of dogs put down every year are pits or pit mixes.  The solution isn't to stop breeding other breeds.  It's also not to try and place dogs in inappropriate homes.  Neither makes any sense."

I'd have to disagree with the assertion that ""most"" dog owners couldn't handle a hound. If you want a Yorkie, then yes, a coonhound is not the right fit. If you're fine with large dogs but want a very lazy one, then probably also not, unless you adopt an older senior hound. But I will just never understand how hounds got the reputation of being bad pets; aside from a few specific problems that have a variety of solutions (e.g. some will scale a fence that would contain the majority of dogs), I find them very similar to popular dogs like labs in terms of their ability to be great pets for very active people."
dogs,3dvu20,VividLotus,-6,Tue Jul 21 18:44:11 2015 UTC,"I don't live near mountains, therefore scent hounds aren't huge here.  The same shitty cultural attitudes towards dogs exist here though, so we have plenty of pit bulls in shelters.  Why don't hounds make great pets?  Because they are working dogs from working lines that have been very intensely bred for very specific things that don't fit with modern suburban/urban life.  They are bred to be independent thinkers working far from their master.  They don't listen.  At all.  They are loud as hell - louder than hell if they think there is a reason.  They absolutely need to be outside a good portion of the day for their mental health.  They are escape artists and they will run and run.  They typically have zero road sense, so it's likely they will get hit by a car if they do escape.  They dig - for funsies, for a cool place to sleep, to escape, or to get to critters.  They are horrible off-leash.  They are notorious counter-surfers.  They often have some level of food aggression.  They have drive for days, but not the kind of drive that you can channel into dog sports or fetch or obedience training.  No, they have prey drive and scent drive and nothing satisfies that but running and sniffing and hunting.  Basically, they aren't right for most urban and suburban homes.  Even homes that can cope with a high energy dog will struggle to satisfy their need to hunt.  I LOVE coonhounds.  They have so many great qualities.  Mine is very happy and spoiled.  I wouldn't give her up for the most well trained lab on earth.  She is so funny and silly.  She adds so much to my life, but they are not right for most people.  They just aren't.  Just like Huskies, Malinois, and GSDs aren't right for most people.  My issue is that trying to convince people not to go to responsible breeders or trying to get responsible breeders to stop breeding would exacerbate the problems, not help them.  The people over breeding pit bulls and dumping hounds aren't going to stop.  If we stop producing well-bred dogs, then what are we left with?  If all that is available is shelter mutts (I don't use the word mutt derogatorily), then I guarantee dog ownership would go down.  Dog breeds were developed for a reason, including companion breeds.  They serve a purpose.  Getting rid of dog breeds is a terrible idea.  And that is what we're talking about when we talk about never going to a breeder and only going to shelters."

All I said is that I hate the myth that the only dogs in shelters are pit bulls. Even in areas where there is indeed a huge problem with pit bull overpopulation, it is still fully possible to find a different breed of dog in a shelter.  Perpetuating the myth that the only dogs in shelters are pit bulls (dogs that a lot of people don't want to adopt, or can't adopt due to breed-specific legislation or housing rules) is incredibly harmful, and leads uninformed people to not even bother considering adoption when they might otherwise have done so.

A lot of people don't want pit bulls. A lot of people can't have pit bulls. Therefore, a larger percentage of pit bulls are going to be euthanized compared to other breeds of dogs. The euthanasia rate says nothing about how many dogs of a given breed are actually available in shelters. If you looked at those numbers, I am absolutely positive you'd find way, way more than 15% of available dogs being non-pits. The difference is that it's a lot less common for, say, a Yorkie to get euthanized in a shelter than for a pit to be. There are many non-pits of all kinds of breeds who either end up getting adopted, or get picked up by rescues, or are accepted by no-kill shelters and just end up staying there for a very long time."

I can only assume these dogs had homes, then someone gave them up, someone decided they could not deal with dog and baby, or dog had to much energy or dog was to old or dog peed to much.  We don't have an over population issue, puppies are adopted super quick, we have a pet retention issue. People don't keep dogs.

I live in a state with a low euthanization rate because there is a larger demand for adoptable pets than there are stray dogs.  I volunteer for a rescue, and I think 90%+ of average dog owners, with research and diligence, can find a dog in a shelter or rescue that will be a suitable family pet or companion.  Many rescue dogs come from backyard breeders, people who are uneducated and poor and don't plan for dogs financially, and don't care to spay or neuter their dogs, causing more stray animals.  Is it fair that responsible homes looking for responsible breeders (many of which contractually bind owners of pet dogs from their lines to spay and neuter, and also have a long-term take-back guarantee good if not better than shelters and rescues) are lumped in with other people causing the overpopulation issue because of impulse buying from bad breeders looking to make a quick buck?  The average person looking for a bred dog coming into /r/dogs and asking how to find a reputable breeder isn't looking for an ordinary family pet.  Even if they are, you see a lot of people who own responsibly-bred dogs referring them to reputable rescues.  Some reputable breeders are involved in their own breed's rescue, as well.  Dogs were bred for years to work and some to do jobs, and others now fulfill these outlets in service work, police work, therapy work, and dog sports.  I'm sorry, but it really is my pet peeve in this sub when people come here and shame others passive aggressively rather than truly learn what causes the issues we have.  This is a global community, and believe it or not, many people here live in places where there isn't a dog overpopulation problem in their area, so it's best to educate people in general the good from the bad so they can make the best decision for the lifestyle.

A dog with yellow hair is called a Golden-mix, even if it's probably a Chow.   You can go a long time without seeing a Griffon.

It is not my responsibility to pick up and fix a dog that someone never bothered to train then dumped it when they could not control it or got bored with the animal.

However, we often times have 8 to 12 week old puppies of various non-bully breeds. And this is in a north-east shelter, which does decent with the over-population issue. Perhaps people don't see them because they get adopted before noon. They do come in rather often, they just get adopted out much, much faster. There are also shelters that are able to do a dog transport from down south, which will often (in my experience) consists of dogs under six months.

Most of them end up euthanized, because no hunter is going to adopt a dog that may have ended up there for being bad at hunting, and many people are under the misapprehension that hounds are bad pets."
dogs,3dvu20,toffeedog,-11,Mon Jul 20 15:34:22 2015 UTC,"Well, if every single breeder in your region is knowingly allowing their dogs to end up in shelters, then you're right, there are no reputable breeders in your area. But how do you know that the dogs in shelters represent the entire population of breeders in your area?  I get the feeling from your comments that you are very involved with shelters in your area, and hey, that's great!  But have you considered that maybe your world just doesn't overlap much with the world of reputable breeders?  I'm not saying one is better than the other, but looking at all the dogs that come into shelters and concluding that all breeders allow their dogs to end up there is like looking at only the produce section of your grocery store and concluding that the store doesn't sell milk.  The world is bigger than what you're looking at.  No one here is denying that terrible breeders exist and that those breeders are contributing to the pet retention problem. There has been a lot of effort on this sub to educate people about which breeders are the bad ones and why you shouldn't buy from them.  Bad breeders may knowingly allow their dogs to end up in shelters. Good breeders won't.  It's one of the qualifications that makes someone a responsible breeder."

dogs,3dvu20,timetravellerswife,3,Mon Jul 20 16:09:55 2015 UTC,"Hounds aren't bad pets, but they do not fit many people's lifestyles or needs.  Dumping hunting scent hounds is a big problem across the south.  Unfortunatly, adoption often isn't an option as there are far more dogs than appropriate hound homes AND these dogs are often completely unsocialized with big behavioral issues and are used to living outside.  The solution is nothing short of a cultural shift.  Frankly, dogs that wouldn't hunt or weren't worth breeding were historically culled.  Serious coonhound breeders didn't want to be known for or contribute to shitty hunting dogs.  It's not pleasant, but it's true and it still goes on do this day.  I'm not sure which is worse.  It's just not true that you can stick a scent hound in a home that want/need a Yorkie, a lab, a poodle, etc.  They are not interchangeable."
dogs,3dvu20,SharpStiletto,3,Tue Jul 21 17:30:17 2015 UTC,"I mean, I'd of course agree they're absolutely not interchangeable. Anyone who's ever met a hound and also another type of dog would have to admit that. I have both types of dogs-- the world's most remarkably lazy toy dog (a pug) and an incredibly energetic coonhound. I love them both, but I'm well aware that plenty of people who'd love a dog like my pug would not last a day taking care of even a very well-behaved coonhound. But I do think that there are probably many people who are interested in adopting a larger, active-breed dog-- like many people in the Pacific Northwest who want to take their dog hiking, for example-- who might enjoy a coonhound.   Ultimately though, I do think you're right that solving the issue of tons and tons of dumped hounds is really only going to happen by cultural shift, because there are just so many. Even if some billionaire decided to fund constant flights from hound-centric areas like the rural South to places where there might be more adopters, there's simply no way there'd ever be enough homes. And that's even if you only count the dumped hounds who actually end up making it to a shelter alive, and get advertised on Facebook pages and within rescue networks. Who knows how many more of them just either get shot, or die of starvation or predation in the woods.  Personally, I'd like to see hunting with dogs being made illegal, but that will never happen, at least not in the South. I honestly don't know what the real solution to this problem is."
dogs,3dvu20,Kowai03,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:39:30 2015 UTC,"Even hiking though, you can't let a coonhound off-leash in the woods.  Unless you enjoy chasing it for miles off-trail through the brush.  I think it would be sad to see hunting with dogs made illegal.  I'm not sure the breeds would survive that really.  It's definitely a different culture than mine, but I can appreciate it and it's value.  I'm not a huge fan of hunting bear and mountain lion, but we're over run with raccoon and I don't have a problem with hunting them.  I certainly don't have a problem with deer, hog, and bird hunting.  There are plenty of breeders who don't dump or cull.  Unfortunately, there are enough who do to make it a major problem."

dogs,3dvu20,court67,7,Mon Jul 20 15:32:26 2015 UTC,"I disagree. There are many breed suggestion posts where people advise OP to go to a shelter with the list of traits they want, urge them to rescue an older dog instead of buying a puppy, etc.  For some people and circumstances adopting from a shelter is right and for others, acquiring a puppy from a breeder is the better course. I feel that people in this sub try to point people in the right direction for the individual and their circumstances.  This post is about showing an example of what to expect from ""a responsible breeder"" of hunting dogs in the US. There are many people who do not have a clue what to look for in a breeder, how to choose one or indeed evaluate them as ""responsible"".  This post is not about buying instead of adopting; it is about giving guidance to those who choose to go the buying route. Also educating people about what the dialogue between buyer and breeder may entail, because people who have not experienced dealing with a good breeder may have no idea the lengths they will go to to ensure the health and well-being of their dogs and those they are responsible for bringing into the world.  Often it is ignorance that leads people to poor breeders who do not care enough about the dogs they produce and are willing to sell to unsuitable homes. A good breeder will interview you to make sure you are suitable and refuse to sell you a dog if you don't meet their criteria."

What gets you downvoted is derailing a discussion because you feel entitled to share your views when the conversation isn't even about you.

This is simply not the case. It is not about having a ""purebred"" dog but a well bred pedigree dog with a lineage that ensures the health, temperament, drives and characteristics that one is seeking. Add to this a puppy that has been handled and carefully socialised and exposed to children, animals, noises, etc. during its time with the breeder.   For some people these things do not matter, they seek another type of dog and have different priorities. This is fine and great. However, please recognise that not everyone wants the same type of dog for the same reasons and those who value the qualities mentioned above will not find them in a shelter dog. Certainly not in this part of the world and from what I gather, the US is not so different in this respect."

I want a well bred dog with a known history (meaning it's parents as well), health clearances and the support of a breeder who'll be there the dogs whole life. I'm not going to get that from a rescue. I'm just not. But I can get it from a reputable breeder. So I have. And I'm not going to be shamed by people trying to tell me I'm killing dogs in shelters.   Now am I against adopting? Definitely not. I've recommended it many times as well as helped friends adopt dogs. I've volunteered at shelters. My cat was adopted from the SPCA because I don't have the same things I want in a cat as I do my dogs.

dogs,3dvu20,SharpStiletto,7,Tue Jul 21 16:48:14 2015 UTC,There's a huge difference in getting a purebred dog and a well-bred dog. No one here thinks you can't find a purebred in a shelter- it's finding a well-bred dog of that breed that's nearly impossible.
dogs,3dvu20,Kowai03,5,Mon Jul 20 23:44:39 2015 UTC,"Serious question, though: aside from people who have a burning desire to compete in dog shows, or people who need a working dog for a really important reason (i.e. an assistance animal, not a dog to help with their weekend drunken hunting trips) why does that matter? If you're concerned about a higher likelihood of crazy vet costs, simply don't adopt (or buy, either) a dog from a breed that's known to have many genetic health problems. And aside from genetic health problems, you're not any more likely to have a healthy dog because you bought them from a breeder than if you adopted them at a shelter. The world's most expensive dog can still jump the fence and get hit by a car and need emergency surgery, or can get sick from contagious diseases.  From their health and appearance, I'd say that one of my dogs was likely quite ""well-bred"", and the other wasn't. It makes no difference in their ability to be good pets, which-- like most people who want a dog-- is all I care about."
dogs,3dvu20,stopbuffering,7,Tue Jul 21 00:51:41 2015 UTC,"It's not just the financial aspect of having a healthy dog, but the emotional too. I grew up with a dysplastic lab and it's fucking heartbreaking. I don't want to go through that again. If that's selfish, then so be it. There are people out there with much bigger hearts than me if they're willing to adopt a dog that likely won't be able to chase a ball after it's fourth or fifth birthday.    If you're concerned about a higher likelihood of crazy vet costs, simply don't adopt (or buy, either) a dog from a breed that's known to have many genetic health problems.   So you would rather someone get a dog unsuited for their lifestyle than buy from a responsible breeder? Labs and goldens have quite a few genetic health problems, yet they're such amazing dogs for most families. If a family doesn't want to incur the outrageous vet bills for treating hip dysplasia, then going to a breeder is a great option. They shouldn't just get a hound or a pit instead because that's what's available at their local shelter. Sometimes those aren't good fits.   And that's not even touching on the topic of breeder support. My breeder is an invaluable resource, completely incomparable to anything else in the world. Having someone with in-depth knowledge of your particular dog is something that I value very highly. You may not, but that doesn't mean that no one else should either."
dogs,3dvu20,CBML50,7,Tue Jul 21 00:58:52 2015 UTC,"I do definitely see your point on many of these things. I guess in an ideal world, shelters would have the funds to test dogs for health problems and could let potential adopters know that their dog was at high risk for something like hip dysplasia, or was already starting to show its effects. Some rescues are able to do this; I received a lot of info about my pug's health problems before I adopted him, and was urged by the rescue to do my research and figure out if I was okay with both the financial and other aspects of caring for him. But obviously, the county kill shelter barely has time or money to check if dogs are HW+."

dogs,3dvu20,sugarhoneybadger,-3,Tue Jul 21 18:07:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, and it was extremely sad. My family used to foster for a dalmatian rescue, so we ended up with several epileptic dogs. One puppy ended up having to be euthanized because her seizures weren't being controlled successfully by medication, and she sustained severe brain damage. My parents kept the mother dog of that litter as a ""foster hospice"" kind of situation because she was both deaf  and had epilepsy, and was fearful and aggressive on top of her medical problems.  I wouldn't want to do that again if I could help it, which is one reason that for my first dog I adopted as an adult, I adopted a dog from a well-known and great rescue. He was an adult dog who did have some health problems, and the rescue told me all about them point blank so I could make an informed decision about whether or not I wanted to adopt him. On the flip side, whomever originally bought that aforementioned dalmatian almost certainly did not know about its health problems beforehand."
dogs,3dvu20,sugarhoneybadger,-8,Tue Jul 21 18:32:03 2015 UTC,"Epilepsy is hereditary. It's not explicitly clearly how it's inherited but it is definitely familial; my dog is epileptic, as are quite a number of others from his crappy breeder. In my dog's case, he had his first seizure at 3. He had his next three months later, and then a year and four months after that, and then six months later, and then a month later, and then two months, and so on until I started him on KBr. He's doing well now. The point is, however, that an adult dog with epilepsy can wind up in a shelter and it's entirely possible that the dog could not experience a single seizure while it's there. It's not a risk I'm personally willing to take.  I intend to show and compete with my next dog, but even if I didn't, I'd still be getting a dog from a breeder that really tracks their lines and knows what's come up in the dogs they're working with. I'm going to feel a lot better about the dog's health if it's got a solid 8-gen pedigree behind it with no issues than a complete unknown from a shelter or a rescue, you know what I'm saying? And shit happens, I know - in addition to my dog's epilepsy he's had plenty of just shit luck issues. Nothing can be done for that.

dogs,3dzdql,therobbo91,2,Mon Jul 20 19:58:56 2015 UTC,"The only thing you can do is keep the dog extremely well-hydrated (preferably through subcutaneous means like IV, since she's vomiting incessantly and her intestines will have a hard time processing any kind of food right now) and keep her nourished. Parvo basically shreds a puppy's intestines, so if you haven't seen bloody stool yet, that doesn't necessarily mean that you won't. Feed her a very light gruel of pulverized wet puppy chow and/or meat broth. If you start to see blood in the stool, return to the vet. Puppies - even adult dogs - can bleed out very quickly from internal bleeding related to parvo if left unchecked. I went through a parvo epidemic at the animal shelter I worked in one summer in college and we easily lost anywhere from two to half a dozen dogs a day for a few weeks while we tried desperately to quarantine.  One thing to keep in mind is that parvo is exceptionally infectious to other dogs, so anything that belongs to your dog - crate, bedding, toys, etc... -  needs to be sterilized with a mixture of 1 part bleach to 20 parts water. You also need to bleach your yard if your dog has been using the restroom out there - get one of those spray fertilizer attachments for your hose and use that.   As far as survival odds, it really just depends. Sounds like you caught it pretty early. Puppies have a 80-95% survival rate with treatment. Treatment through a vet can be VERY costly though - between two and five grand, easy."
dogs,3dzdql,danceswithronin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:05:27 2015 UTC,"The last series for parvo vaccine is generally at 16 weeks. If you catch it early and start treatment, the odds of survival are much higher.  But if it's untreated it has a 90%+ mortality rate.  With aggressive treatment, it's under 50% but lower the earlier you get it.  Most of the time the dogs will die before day 4, so if they survive past that the odds are pretty good.

(look up crate games/susan garret on youtube)   Work up to carrying her in her bag around the house, dropping cookies in through the smaller roof hole.  Carry her out to the car in the bag and go for a short drive somewhere fun.   Hang out at an out door cafe while she's in the bag, (for at least part of the time).   Until our first flight I used the bag in the car for most of our trips for a few weeks. Getting in the bag= going somewhere fun. (And she already thinks being in the car is time to rest).   I was worried for my first flight since my dog can be a little nervous, but she is an amazing traveler. She actually loves being in her bag, it's like her special portable bed. And now we fly maybe once a month, so I'm glad I did all that training.   OH, a couple other things- take off and landing is a little weird and loud so I keep a few teeeny treats in my purse that I can drop in her bag as that stuff happens so she doesn't think something horrible is happening. I also carry an extra serving of her food in my purse in case we get stuck somewhere without my luggage."
dogs,3dzckf,OrangeCrushinator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:16:58 2015 UTC,"I actually just flew with my dog a couple weekends ago.    Daycare is a good idea. Make sure you take him for a long walk before hand as well. Let him potty and sniff. Do some training so he is mentally worn and ready to settle. I would ask your vet about the calming meds.  Call the airline and confirm you don't need anything additional (health certificate or anything) You will not be able to take him out of the carrier at all. I know my dog is fairly calm and just slept the whole time but I still felt terrible about him being couped up in the carrier. I only had about an hour between each of my flights. As soon as the plane landed, I checked security wait times. As it was middle of the day, most checkpoints were reasonable (10 min or so) so I ran my dog out to the nearest door so he could stretch and potty if he wanted to. You can't have much else to carry on any way, so getting through security should be quick (no carryon suitcase or anything).  Ask the gate agent if you can board when they call for those needing ""extra time."" Getting the carrier in under the seat can be awkward when there are other passengers.  I hope you're short While you're in your destination - keep working on having him acclimated to the carrier - don't just leave it in a car or closet or whatever. Use some kibble to feed him in it, etc. otherwise if he doesn't love flying, the trip back could be miserable."

Labs of course are an all around good breed, don't require a lot of grooming, are pretty trainable, energy level seems to depend on bloodlines (if they're from a working line they'll have higher energy, pet line not so high). But they are notorious for chewing in their early years.  Golden retriever is another good breed but because they're so popular they can be prone to health problems. If you buy from a breeder make sure the parents have had health checks. Also it seems like a lot of the ones I meet are pretty hyper."
dogs,3dzbql,Eponia,2,Mon Jul 20 19:47:11 2015 UTC,"Collies I've met were pretty laid back, and smart/trainable, but if you don't want to deal with a lot of grooming get a smooth coated collie, not a rough coated collie. Do not get a border collie if this is your first dog or you're not serious about training and finding an energy outlet (like a sport) for your dog. They are incredibly smart and have very high energy.   Agreed with what Eponia wrote.  I've owned smooth collies since '88.  They are agreeable, gentle and attentive.  On the downside, they are very sensitive and shut down if treated harshly."
dogs,3dzbql,Pablois4,3,Tue Jul 21 02:24:17 2015 UTC,"Australian Shepherds usually do not make a great first dog, although I am not sure if this is your first dog or not. While they are a beautiful breed (I am partial), they are also overly smart and will get themselves into trouble if they aren't properly stimulated.   I love my lab and would always recommend them to someone that wants an outgoing, fun loving, energetic breed. They tend to be a lot more forgiving when it comes to teaching them something new, and are not overly emotion and can bounce back from mistakes a lot easier then some other more emotional breeds. They need socialization, but it isn't as dire as say with an aussie. Not to mention how much more low maintenance their coats are."
dogs,3dya3z,HailCorduroy,3,Mon Jul 20 14:57:07 2015 UTC,His lack of socialness could just be that he's in a new environment and doesn't really trust the people yet.  This article has some nice tips about handling a shy dog.

dogs,3dya3z,becomingk,2,Mon Jul 20 17:20:27 2015 UTC,No problem! My dog was really shy when I first adopted him and it took awhile to get him out of his shell. I think a lot of it is just management and confidence building.

My friends have had him for 8 weeks and it appears to be way beyond shyness.  It took us 10 minutes to find him in their backyard because he hides.  The poor guy was terrified.  Someone had to be abusive to him at some point.  I hate it, but I don't think we are going to be able to help him.  He needs someone with experience dealing with this type of situation."

dogs,3dxnzu,kirkl3s,4,Mon Jul 20 11:37:15 2015 UTC,"Any time there is a ""bite and shake"" there is potential for injury, even if you don't see external puncture wounds. Commonly in these scenarios you can see separation of the underlying connective tissue but not necessarily any external wounds. It may behoove you to take your dog to the vet just in case, especially If you're starting to see swelling or feel a lump in that area.  Regardless, this can be painful. Even if there is no injury, sometimes these dogs are sore and may need a few days of an NSAID to be comfortable."
dogs,3dxnzu,rvtjess,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:46:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! I didn't see too much of a shake, I just noticed the other dog definitely got a piece of her. I'll keep an eye on the swelling and bring her in if I notice anything.  At this point she doesn't seem to be any worse for wear."
dogs,3dxnzu,lizzyborden42,2,Mon Jul 20 11:56:24 2015 UTC,Itty bitty looking puncture wounds can also be much more serious than they look. If your dog is fairly fluffy you might want to get her into the vet anyway.
dogs,3dxnzu,OrvilleTurtle,2,Mon Jul 20 14:18:43 2015 UTC,"As far as after the encounter I think the other comments address this well enough.  As far as your reaction to your dog It sounds like you did the right thing. The worst thing you can do is start to act overly concerned for your dog. Coddle, and pick him up, and start cooing... he is going to connect what happened as a terrible thing... rather than just something that happened. I see this all the time with nail trimming.... someone cuts the quick and it starts bleeding... the person freaks out and then the dog learns that nail clipping must be horrible.  I would give those dogs a wider berth from now on, and maybe all dogs really you just never know."
dogs,3dxnzu,serebear,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:23:26 2015 UTC,"As the vet thing has already been stated, I would have a talk with the neighbor and see if this has happened before to gauge if this dog is reactive and could potentially have dog aggression and maybe see if the neighbor plans on doing any follow up training to stop this sort of thing from happening in the future. Sure ""dogs will be dogs"" but sometimes there is an underlying cause and maybe next time could cause your dog or another dog serious damage.   You don't have to be rude about it, sometimes people tend to just brush it off or don't really think their dog needs the extra help and some times all it takes is a push in the right direction to make sure the dogs get the help they need to behave properly.   Or you could just ignore it and make sure to walk out of leash range when passing your neighbors dogs in the future"
dogs,3dxnzu,oddible,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:49:09 2015 UTC,"I always ensure that my dog is under control before I approach another dog, whether my dog is on or off leash, I call her to my side (the opposite side of the dogs I'm passing, so that I'm between them) and she is at heel until we pass them (she typically likes to speed up as we pass them to give them no chance to nip at her from behind, so I accommodate and speed up a bit to so that she remains at heel).  This minimizes the chance for any problematic interaction between the dogs.  If the other owner doesn't seem to want to do the same, or they don't seem to have control of their dogs, I cross the street or I ask if they're friendly before I approach.    Sometimes I will park my dog at sit in the grass and stand between her and the sidewalk and wait for the other dogs to pass.    Unfortunately quite often, other owners don't ask but let their dogs approach on their own - clearly not occupying the leadership role to their dogs.  In this case if I am between my dog and theirs if they start to approach my dog I step to remain in between them and clearly say ""No"" to the other dogs - this sometimes gets the other owner a bit testy but I don't care, show me you have control and ask permission or I'll assume the alpha role for both of us.  I DO often let my dog engage with respectful other dogs on the street and I feel it is an important part of the socialization of dogs in the city.  If I avoid all interaction with other dogs on the sidewalk that would be a problematic example to my dog as well."

dogs,3dwarz,SkWatty,6,Mon Jul 20 01:50:08 2015 UTC,"Is it ok that she is facing away from the door of the crate?   I'm not sure what you mean by this.  Could you elaborate?   Do I leave water at her cage when I go to sleep?   Ask her owner, but you probably don't have to.  Just make sure she has access to water during the day.   Does she sleep all night long?   At that age, she may or she may not.  Ask her owner.   Do I need to take her outside so she could pee at night?   Ask her owner.  (Are you seeing a pattern here?)   What do I do when she gives me a face when she wants to play and I'm working?   Give her a toy to play with on her own.  Something like a Kong with some peanut butter inside is a good option.   What do I do during the middle of the day?   Like, when you're not home?  Well, what does her owner do when they're out of the house?  Crate her?  Put her in an exercise pen?  Also, be aware that she will likely need to go outside to do her business at least every four hours.  More often right after she eats/drinks and after vigorous playing.   And most importantly, how do I make her like me so much or just chill with me?   Play with her, pet her, exercise her, feed her.  Fortunately, puppies of that age tend to be pretty easy to win over.  There's a saying: ""A tired dog is a good dog"".  There's a lot of truth to this.  A 4 month old GSD is going to need quite a bit of exercise.  I would aim for at least two walks per day.  A 30-45 minute walk in the morning and a 30-45 minute walk in the evening.  If she's still hyper, increase the length of the walks.  I get the feeling you haven't really talked about this much with the dog's owner.  Here are some good questions you should ask her owner before you watch her:  What is her normal daily schedule like?  How often does she need to go outside to do her business?  To what extent is she house trained?  Has she had all of her shots?  What kind of food does she eat and how much and how often?  Does she have any food allergies?  What vet does she go to and what is that vet's contact information?  In the event of emergency, what's the best way to reach you?  What kind of behaviors is she not allowed to do? (i.e. Is she not supposed to jump on people?  Is she not supposed to beg for food?)  When you walk her, do you attach her leash to her collar or to a harness?  Any other specific instructions? (i.e. no vigorous exercise right after she eats)"
dogs,3dwarz,Kaedylee,13,Mon Jul 20 02:19:20 2015 UTC,"Question: why is someone giving you the responsibility of watching a young GSD? It seems like you are inexperienced with dogs and not ready for this based on your questions...  Don't leave water in their crate. They will knock the bowl over and spill it everywhere. During the night time, I stop giving water to pup around 8-10pm and a final potty time before bedtime. I don't encourage letting them drink as much water as they want at night because that means they might be prone to an accident. Regardless, you will need to take her out to potty and I chose to wake up around 3-4AM to do so.   If she gives you a face when she wants to play or nudges you with a toy and you don't want to play, ignore it. If you give in, you're telling her that if she nudges you enough or gives you the best puppy eyes, you'll give in.   Middle of the day... Play with her, give her a snack, make sure she goes potty, make sure there's always water available.   My GSD (1 year now) has always been cautious with new people. But once friends play with them, my dog thinks they are his new best friend. Lots of play, use treats to teach or strengthen commands will help you create a bond with the dog. Don't yell or punish the dog.   If you have any other questions, feel free to PM me!   Here's my guy :-)  http://imgur.com/DlTdJcv"

Do I leave water at her cage when I go to sleep? Fill the bowl halfway or less to avoid an accident.    Does she sleep all night long?  She should, if you hear her crying take her outside then right back in the crate, no toys, treats, playing etc. Think of her as a toddler, if you entertain her every time she cries you will either be sleepless or have a furry bedmate  What do I do when she gives me a face when she wants to play and I'm working? If you can go for it if not give her a chew toy. The everlasting treat is a great for this purpose.  What do I do during the middle of the day?  She's still young so she should be let out every 3-4 hours. If that's not possible, put a pee pad in the back half if her crate and blanket/bed in the front half.   And most importantly, how do I make her like me so much or just chill with me?  Be patient and affectionate. Be prepared to clean up accidents because it's going to happen. She's in a new place with a new human so expect the first few days to be not so fun. It sounds like she's crate trained so make sure she has access to it even when you're home and don't use if as a punishment.  Do your best to tire her out during the day so you can both sleep all night. Good luck!"
dogs,3dwarz,Hobbes579,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:20:29 2015 UTC,"I'm going to echo olive2bake said, why the hell is someone leaving their very young GSD. GSD are such sensitive creatures and this puppy period is so important for socialization that even ten days can set a puppy back months. GSD go through fear periods that can permanently effect the type of dog they become. This isn't anything against you but the owner should be really looking at all his/her options. Boarding at a training facility, seeing if the breeder will take care of it or anywhere else where the puppy will be understood and properly socialized (not just with other dogs but with new environments, noises, surfaces, etc)."

dogs,3dxc4z,shelteredpearl,4,Mon Jul 20 08:48:19 2015 UTC,"Look up desensitisaton training on Google. Most of it is about fireworks or other dogs but the theory is the same.  The trick is to SLOWLY get her used to the elements of being picked up. Do this through slow exposure and rapid rewarding  (every few seconds) for the desired behavior  (being calm)  I would start with getting her used to being in position with your hands under her and work up to an inch off the ground, then 2 inches, etc, etc   When she shows signs of getting nervous, don't react,  just return her to the ground and reward her when she is calm again.   Don't over do it with each session. Prob about 10 mins or 3 or 4 tries max. And finish up with something fun she enjoys"
dogs,3dxc4z,AndyBatcountry,2,Mon Jul 20 09:23:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd agree with the above. The other thing I might do is use treats to lure her onto your lap, let her sit on your lap, put your arms under and around her barrel a little, the 'holding' feel but not actually lifted above the ground.  My cattle dog is about 40lbs and I pick him up sometimes, but it's really not his favourite, he was carried a lot as a puppy and it's really just not his thing regardless of being desensitized to it at a young age. I know at his size now that he's really just a bit big and cumbersome for me to carry, and I think sometimes he feels that and that's what puts him on edge and makes him uncomfortable."

Are you finished in the marines - I know sometimes bases don't allow dogs is it possible you could be moved to one of those? Do you have family that could look after your dog in that situation.  Do you have the time for several hours of exercise + training every day?  A non-serious obedient dog would probably be more along the lines of a lab or golden retriever."

No.  • Who do you live with or are you single? Single  • How much shedding, barking, farting and drooling can you tolerate? I'd prefer it if the dog would be silent on commanx  • How much grooming do you want to do, or how often can you pay a professional to groom him? Two to three times a month  • What's your activity level? I workout twice a day on average  • How much time a day can you give to walking and playing with the dog? 5 to 6 hours  • How often will the dog be left alone and for how long? Varies by day. Not more than a total of 5 hours on any given day  • If needed, could you hire someone to walk your dog when you can't be home, pay for a doggy daycare, or come home at lunch to break up the day for him? Yes.  • How trainable does your dog need to be? I'd love to be able to teach all sorts of things. Tracking. Playing dead. Roll over. When to be friendly and when not to be friendly.  • How important is having your dog off-leash? Moderate. I'd prefer it. But I understand that sometimes it's required   • Do you live in an apartment? Or moving in the next 5 years? 3 bedroom apartment  • Are there breed or size restrictions (understanding that some breeds may make it more difficult to find housing)? No.  • Do you understand that dogs can live up to 15+ years? Yes  • Do you have a fenced yard, or is there a large fenced area nearby? Yes  • Do you have young (i.e under ~8) children (or planning on having children)? Not for at least another 5 to 10 years.  • Are you experienced with owning/training dogs? Yes  • Where do you intend to keep your dog? With me. I intend to have a room inside my apartment specifically for the dog. Not that I'm going to leave it in there at all times. But one for him to do whatever.  • What's the weather like where you live? Snow 6 months out of the year. Chilly in the fall and spring is always changing. Summer is a pretty constant 70 degrees  • Did you budget for your new dog? Yes.  • Where do you intend to get the dog from? (Breeder, shelter, breed specific rescue etc) Hopefully find one in a shelter.  • What are you looking to get out of your dog? (i.e a running buddy, a lap warmer/companion, guard dog…) companion. One to take with me everywhere.  • Breeds that you are interested in? Husky and Gsd • Do you have other pets? No  • What size of dog are you looking for? Medium to large  • Are you easily frustrated or stressed? No.  Thanks for all the comments already guys. Hope this helps."
dogs,3dz15t,therobbo91,6,Mon Jul 20 19:15:29 2015 UTC,"• What's your activity level? I workout twice a day on average   What would your activity level with the dog be? (Ex: 1 30 minute walk in the morning, 45 minute jog in the evening)  If you rent and will rent for the foreseeable future, neither of these breeds is a great choice. German Shepherds are banned almost everywhere. Even if your current apt allows them, many others will not.   It really sounds like what you want is a Lab or Golden that looks like a Husky or GSD. All of these traits you desire (obedient, friendly, ability to go out in public with you) just scream retriever. They're also pretty easy to find in shelters/rescues."
dogs,3dz15t,court67,3,Mon Jul 20 19:23:26 2015 UTC,"If OP's current apartment allows GSDs and they can stay there for the foreseeable future, a GSD wouldn't be a terrible option. Sounds like they're planning on dedicating plenty of time to the dogs exercise needs, and they're into dog sports like tracking. The ""when to be friendly and when to not"" reminds me of a GSD too. A loyal breed, but it sounds like they're looking for something slightly more aloof.   OP, if you're interested in tracking and schutzhund, you should get involved with a club now and find a dog through them. It sounds like you want a protective dog and that's fine, a schutzhund club will be able to give you a realistic time commitment required to own one of those dogs and it will give you better perspective on what all that entails.   My biggest reservation is that you want the dog to be silent on command which is only kind of possible with GSDs. Sure, my dog has a ""quiet"" command that he obeys probably 80% of the time. But when he's really amped up, he just loves to hear himself talk. Most GSDs do."
dogs,3dz15t,therobbo91,3,Mon Jul 20 19:36:19 2015 UTC,"The other thing that concerned me was that OP said they wanted to go through a shelter. I don't know that adopting an adult GSD would be the easiest route, especially since OP seems to be very focused on having a dog that can go with them everywhere. If they happen to have a club near them that could be an option, but that depends on area and might take a while to find a suitable adult."
dogs,3dz15t,court67,2,Mon Jul 20 19:44:22 2015 UTC,"That's a really good point. You'll have a much better chance of finding a stable lab in a shelter than a GSD. But if they're prioritizing participating in events such as tracking (which usually goes hand in hand with sport protection work) they're going to have a hard time finding that kind of dog in a shelter period. A schutzhund club may have connections with GSD-specific rescues, though, and be able to snag a working dog before it makes its way to a shelter. I know this kind of thing happens in Mals pretty frequently. The ones being adopted out by rescues are solely going to pet homes, but there are some back channels funneling working line Mals into the correct type of home. A schutzhund club would have access to these channels, I bet."
dogs,3dz15t,punstersquared,2,Mon Jul 20 20:27:34 2015 UTC,"A foster-based breed rescue may be a better bet than a shelter; however, IMO, anyone looking for a large working dog should strongly consider having a pre-adoption exam and possibly radiographs done by a surgeon or other veterinarian with experience with working dogs. GSD's have a high rate of hip dysplasia and the dogs that end up in shelters or rescues are rarely well-bred specimens, as responsible breeders want the dog back if the owner can't keep it. I was saved a lot of heartache when I had a GSD potential service dog vetted by a surgeon; even though the rescue said their vet hadn't found anything on exam, mine found that the hips easily subluxated during manipulation, a sign that the dog has hip dysplasia and will develop osteoarthritis. I was advised that such a dog is suitable as a pet who might go for walks and controlled jogs but not for high-impact or strenuous jobs, as those activities may accelerate the development of arthritis. If the OP is just looking for a companion dog who may not be up to SAR or Schutzhund, then this is less important. Tracking on the flat is less intense than true SAR or anything involving jumping. I'm not saying there aren't great dogs out there in rescues, but anyone looking for a working animal from any source needs to be mindful of the risks."

dogs,3dz15t,john_dune,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:34:30 2015 UTC,"As an owner of a husky, let me give you my 0.02.  1) Are you willing to jog/run with your dog for over an hour a day?  2) Are you willing to occasionally suffer property damage? (My husky damaged 2 dining room chairs, a couch, and some other things)  3) Are you willing to commit to never letting your dog off leash?  Because huskies are NOTORIOUSLY bad off leash.  4) You're in the Marines? Are you likely to get deployed?  If so, do you have someone who can take care of the dog for months?  5) Huskies are notoriously hard to train, how obedient do you want it?  Huskies are smart dogs, very smart dogs, so smart that you'll have to motivate them to do what you want them to do, and even then, they may not co-operate.  Don't get me wrong, huskies are great dogs, very good with people, very fun loving, but they require a LOT of work.  If you want an obedient but relaxed dog, look at something like a Schnauzer, Poodle, Lab, Retriever.  GSDs are also very great dogs, but they're also fairly serious."

The trick is to figure out what does motivate your dog.  It sounds like he likes to chase the ball outside, so does he have high prey drive?

And if I try to switch the games back and forth she'll just sit down in front of me and stare like ""you're not fooling me"". LOL How old did you start your GSD on nosework? I would love to try some more ""mentally stimulating"" stuff with my pup because she's insanely smart, but we still haven't gotten all the basics down yet, so I'm hesitant to start a whole bunch of different things until she can do the basic 5 (sit, down, come, stay, off) consistently, and not just when she feels like it  ;)"

I walk him off-leash and we live in a 2-3 million people European city, it's kind of my speciality.  So he has plenty to smell, plenty of cats to chase, plenty of parks and trees around. Of course, this takes a lot of discipline and watchful eye I still don't trust him 100% but he's very good with the boundaries I set him for sidewalks and crossing roads.  Right now, we're training on less busy streets to look at me and where he wants to go, I give the command to cross and when he's done with his stuff he can sit by the road and wait for me to order him across.  This way nose work came pretty naturally."

It works best with two people though. One holds the dog, the other hides and calls for it while the first person keeps it restrained until it's all riled up. Then the holder lets the dog go find the hider. It doubles as a fun way to practice recall."

My parents have a dog that prefers to mostly eat at night.  So she'll get a portion to eat with the other dogs in the morning, and then eat the rest during their supper time.  You could see if taking him for a short walk and then feeding him would help.  Some dogs prefer to eat after activities or when they're fully awake.  You could also try switching the food (my dog prefers fish based foods, but will only pick at chicken based foods).  Feeding once a day isn't bad though, as long as they're getting everything they need.  Some dogs even choose to not eat daily, but they're generally healthy."

While many breeds are known for exhibiting same sex agresssion, it also can be found among individuals of breeds not known for such tendencies. The reverse, oddly enough is true. My female Akita ""raised"" and lived with a female Shiba Inu and a female Frenchie.  The only suggestion I have would be to try a find a reputable trainer to help mitigate your pup's aversion to other females. You may never fully resolve the issue, but then again, with the right conditioning and training you may be able to turn it around.  I wish you luck!"

Some have small children that aren't careful with the door. Sometimes the mail man leaves the gate open and the dog figures out how to get out. Some people are just morons.

dogs,3dvk9r,stormeegedon,5,Sun Jul 19 22:13:02 2015 UTC,"I just want to say thank you for this. My previous dog (a Great Pyr) got out of our yard a number of times. This is a yard with three separate levels of gating, built specifically for the purpose of keeping our pup safe. Yet once every 6-12 months or so, she would get out when a gardener or construction worker or whoever forgot to shut a gate (or, you know, three) behind them. Any bit of a gate left cracked open and she was out of there like lightning, off to roam and guard the entire world.  I cannot tell you how frightening it is to have your dog go missing, and on top of that it's humiliating to think that people assume we, to quote OP, ""don't have the same level of concern for our dogs.""

Telling them they're irresponsible and should be thrown in jail for not keeping their dog locked up tight isn't really going to change anything. Just let this one go and be nice if it happens again. I'm sure if you found her twice, there's a good chance others have found her before in the past. Or there's just something really appealing about you to strays. :)"

dogs,3dvk9r,stormeegedon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:03:45 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't find twice in a few months time span to be ridiculous.   Sorry, but I do.  If the dog is going to be let into the garden, then that garden has got to be secured. Our rear garden is secure with 1.5m fencing and 2.5m hedges. As part of our inspection process, the dog warden has us ""dog proof"" the hedges with mesh to prevent escaping. (Tip: make sure the mesh gauge is smaller than the dog's paws to prevent them getting trapped).  Given the owner knew of a problem after the first incident, there is no excuse for them not to have resolved it. A temporary fix would be easy/cheap until proper panelling/mesh can be acquired. Also a good time to walk the perimeter and check for other breaches. Our dog-proofing cost about £20, some time, scratches and swearing; so really no excuse to not do it.  The dog managing to escape is a danger to others (e.g. causing an accident), itself (e.g. getting into a fight). Then, depending on legislation, there are the legal aspects: mandatory destruction under breed laws (it's a pit-mix) and fines reaching into the thousands for having an untagged dog on the loose, never mind legal action and banning orders."
dogs,3dvk9r,twistedLucidity,2,Mon Jul 20 08:41:39 2015 UTC,"My point was that none of us know the situation. There is more than one way for a dog to escape, so you can't know if the dog escaped in the same manner. As someone mentioned already, twice is an accident. Mulitple, regular offenses is a problem.   And as far as tags go, those are not permanent. The dog could have slipped out of the collar at some point, they could have broken off, or some dummy could have take the collar off upon finding the dog to get the information and the dog fled.   With as harsh as you are about it, I hope you aren't finding many lost dogs and subjecting the owners to your judgement."

dogs,3duzyb,doggiedumdam,6,Sun Jul 19 19:06:25 2015 UTC,"Lots of questions. Most of these are concerns you should discuss with your breeder (who might be somewhat apprehensive, as Deerhounds aren't exactly a good first dog except under special circumstances), but I'll try to add to it:  Feeding: Twice a day is what most people do. There is no consensus on whether or not elevating the bowls is better, and looking at the data, it probably doesn't make much of a difference, if any. Common wisdom would dictate to avoid exercise within two hours of feeding to mitigate bloat risk.  As a general rule, sighthounds have prey drive that will overcome any recall, and large sighthounds running loose can cause a lot of damage. Walking those dogs off-leash in an unfenced area is simply out of the question unless you live on hundreds of acres. You can let them run in lure coursing. I don't think Finland allows actual hunting with sighthounds, but I could be wrong.  As for character, sighthounds are their own category and have only a fleeting resemblance to other dogs. They have been bred to hunt independently, and that carries through to other aspects of their behavior. I like to joke they're cats from Chernobyl.   Contrary to popular belief, sighthounds in general are pretty lazy, and a single one of them will usually be content to just sit and/or lie around. Which isn't necessarily a good thing, because a sighthound with no muscle is a sad sight indeed, and that muscle development won't happen without proper exercise."

Which isn't necessarily a good thing, because a sighthound with no muscle is a sad sight indeed, and that won't happen without proper exercise.   I don't have large sighthounds, but I do have a pair of Basenji's.  I can confirm they can be exceptionally lazy dogs.  Typically though, they are pretty good at matching your level of energy.  Mine will never wake me up in the morning unless it's many hours later than normal, because they have to pee.  In fact, most mornings when I want to take them out for a walk, the grumble at me and are slow to wake.  Some days I even have to resort to lifting them!  Having a pair of them has worked nicely though.  In the winter when it's too cold for long walks, they do a decent job of playing with each other enough to get SOME exercise in.  Still, they tend to gain about one pound every winter, and lose it over the summer.   As a general rule, sighthounds have prey drive that will overcome any recall, and large sighthounds running lose can cause a lot of damage. Walking those dogs off-leash in an unfenced area is simply out of the question unless you live on hundreds of acres. You can let them run in lure coursing. I don't think Finland allows actual hunting with sighthounds, but I could be wrong.   I second this as well.  Inside, my dogs have fantastic recall (and general obedience).  Outside?  No amount of treats, pleading, or yelling has any impact.  The one thing you CAN do is teach them not to pull when they see a squirrel, but I would never recommend actually letting them off-leash in any area that isn't fenced.  And not chain-link either... my basenjis can and HAVE climbed chain link fence (with a leash on!) to get to a dastardly squirrel on the other side.  At least 6 foot high (2 meter, for those of you with reasonable units of measure) fence with minimal horizontal piping so they can't get a foothold to climb on anything.  Also don't leave anything big near the fence that they can use to get over the fence easier (like a pile of logs for a stove, or a jetski/motorcycle, etc).   Feeding: Twice a day is what most people do.   This is what I do.  Sighthounds typically have the ""deep chest"" that can be associated with bloat.  Two smaller meals as close to 12 hours apart as possible worked best for me.  When I did it at my breakfast and dinner times, occasionally one or both of them would vomit bile (common when the dog is hungry) between dinner and breakfast the next day.  Also, I recommend walking them BEFORE you feed them, NOT after.  Exercise after a big meal is a exactly how many dogs get bloat.  Final note: I echo the ""sighthound as your first dog"" concern.  My basenji's are my first two dogs, and in retrospect, I should have tried to find another breed for my first dog.  Don't get me wrong... I love my pair to pieces and now I'd never look at another type of dog again... but it was a challenge.  They are much more independent than other dogs, and take longer to trust you.  I got a well trained retired show dog who was 3 years old, and within the first 24 hours, he had shit twice inside, pissed four times inside (twice on my bed's comforter), bit me (100% my fault, I cornered him to try to put a leash on him and lunged), tore up hanging blinds, and refused to eat or come near me.  It took WEEKS to get to the point where he would let me reach out to him, and it took him almost 4 months to really trust me implicitly.  They really are very catlike.  Sighthounds as a general rule are VERY different from your ""typical"" dog like a lab or GSD, so make sure you know what you're getting in to."
dogs,3duzyb,dfiner,7,Mon Jul 20 14:01:53 2015 UTC,/u/Urgullibl it's you time to shine considering the only thing we know about you is that you have large sighthounds.
dogs,3duzyb,unclear_outcome,3,Sun Jul 19 23:52:40 2015 UTC,"How do you schedule work, exercise and feeding? Or have you noticed and difficulties related to a dog being a sighthound (e.g. the prey drive) or are they pretty much like any other dog in the day-to-day life?   I feed my greyhound before or at 8 then walk him around 9/9:30; needing to be done by 10:30 is only true of hot summer days. He gets dinner around 6pm, and we walk at 7:30 or just as the sun is  setting but it's still light out. When it's dark at 5, I walk him before dinner at 4/4:30, or we put on night gear for walking at 7 (headlamps and reflective stuff).   Prey drive: that depends on the dog. Mine will chase anything small that runs, and walking him means I am hypervigilant about squirrels, stray cats, and tiny offleash dogs. He can't be trusted offleash in any open space where there are scents of wildlife or actual little critters; offleash hiking on park trials is a big fat no. High prey drive cannot be turned off; it must be managed.   You must find a vet or emergency vet who knows sighthound protocol for anesthesia and how to administer medication dosages for them. Many sighthounds have died because the vets used standard procedures."
dogs,3duzyb,je_taime,3,Sun Jul 19 20:55:17 2015 UTC,"Deerhounds are much calmer than Whippets and their fellow smaller sighthounds. That said, it takes them at least two years to get there. My dad owns a deerhound and he was a nightmare until he became a proper adult. Nowadays? He sleeps forever. He's very chilled out. If you go to a dog show and check out the deerhounds, they will all be sleeping.  Some of the issues they encountered when Haggis was a puppy were:   Bounciness. They got him at six months, the middle of his teenage years, and he was very mouthy (putting his mouth around your arm) and bouncy (the kind that would knock a kid to the ground). I know you haven't owned a dog before, but teenage dogs - around six-fifteen months, or even up to two years old in large breeds - tend to be terrors, and his size made that much more of a challenge than if he had been a chihuahua. His size compared to other dogs. I know that they do let him off-leash in big areas, but when Haggis sees another dog and gets excited, his sheer size can make his playfulness seem quite scary to other dogs. He can really easily bowl them over and that can send a dog away shrieking or bring it back at him snarling. You've got to be very proactive and monitor a large breed. His size compared to their house. These guys are BIG. And they're long. You can't really keep them in an apartment. Sighthounds tend to be obsessed with food and this makes things harder when they are as tall as the kitchen counter and the trash can. Their house has to be very tidy at all times and food can't just be left on the countertop - he'll get to it. They had to replace their trashcan with one that had an push-button lid because of this. Their life-span. Deerhounds, like most other large breeds, don't live very long. Haggis is eight now and that's about when they clock out. It's heartbreaking, which is why if I ever upgraded from whippets, I'd go for a borzoi because they're one of the very few large breeds that live past ten. This may not be something you consider now, but it's definitely something that will come up once you're four years in and technically halfway through his life.   As for bloat, I personally always wait at least an hour before AND after walks to feed my whips. They get semi-restricted access to water during this time too, particularly the one that likes to gulp several gallons. Make sure you know the signs so that if the worst happens, you can get them to a vet asap.  As for crates, an adult deerhound won't really fit in a crate. Again, at shows you might see deerhounds and wolfhounds sleeping in giant pens as opposed to crates. Remember that they will be able to jump out of these as youngsters, though. Sighthounds are very wily and they will find many ways to get into mischief!  I think one of the most challenging aspects of getting a deerhound for your first dog would simply be the weight. They are big dogs that weigh a LOT and they can pull you over easily. This makes it easier to push humans around as teenagers than if they were smaller. Best to get them into an obedience class when they're still young puppies (4 months old) and continue with it through their teenage years.  Lastly, I can't speak for deerhounds specifically, but my whippets love tearing things up. It's definitely something sighthounds enjoy. Put away everything you love and give them things to tear up that you don't care about, like unstuffed dog toys and empty toilet roll tubes. They should grow out of it.  Hope some of this helps. If you have any specific questions I can give my dad a call and ask for you."
dogs,3duzyb,Serial_Buttdialer,2,Mon Jul 20 00:44:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure if I fit into the ""large"" category, but we're larger than Whippets I suppose. I don't really think about bloat much, the instances are rarer in my breed than yours.   I think crate training is fabulous for any dog whether or not you plan to use in on a regular basis. There will be times in your dog's life where it will need to be crated like travel or injury.   My dogs are always looking for squirrels and really get turned on when they see one. I can't call them off of a chase. Personally, I put my guys on a prong + martingale when I'm walking an area that has a lot of small critters because their weights combined are close to mine."
dogs,3dv11j,SenpaiSama,6,Sun Jul 19 19:15:16 2015 UTC,"From the sounds of it you don't want your mom to reprimand your dog. She sounds a lot like my stepdad and ""reprimanding"" to her likely means knocking the shit out of the dog since she thinks the dog is abusing her and talks about how the dog needs to die.  I don't think anything she does to that dog will be nice. Frankly I think the fact that she only does this to your mother and she gets frightened and upset when your mother yells and gets angry is already a sign that something is up. My dog tucks his tail a bit and looks a little nervous when my uncle is upset and I've seen him smack him with brooms or hand trucks (my whole family immediately jumped in and handled it, I promise I'm not leaving him to be abused) but he's still the only one my dog gets nervous around.  That said, alpha rolling isn't a good way to handle the situation. The dog bit her, ran back to you, and sat down. Then she was flipped and held down. Do you know why clicker training works so well? Because it marks the exact behavior and moment that the dog is being rewarded for. Dogs live in the moment. They don't make connections when they do something and then quite a bit later they're punished for it. As far as she knows she was rolled for sitting next to you.  I don't know how to solve the problem but you could try contacting a professional and finding out how they would handle it if no one here has any suggestions. Do call your mom out on it if you see anything though. She has no right to hurt your dog. Good luck."
dogs,3dv11j,WOOFCheCazzo,3,Sun Jul 19 21:17:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply. I understand my reaction was less than ideal but at the moment Tsuki wasn't calm either, she was nervously prancing around me, not sitting and being calm which is why I did it as it's the fastest way to snap her out of it and get her to be calm."
dogs,3dv11j,WOOFCheCazzo,4,Sun Jul 19 23:22:59 2015 UTC,No problem. And even being over stimulated like that you shouldn't flip or roll her. Alpha rolling can stress out the dog even more and doing it when they're over stimulated and freaking out can lead to a bite or a very very nervous dog (it took me months of training and counter conditioning to get my dog to stop being nervous about me touching his collar or scruff because he was afraid of being rolled when over excited).  The best thing to do would be to gently take her by the collar (or just call her to follow if you can get her to listen) and guide her to another room away from the excitement so she can calm down.
dogs,3dv11j,WOOFCheCazzo,2,Sun Jul 19 23:36:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, I will definitely try that instead next time she's in that state of mind. I was always taught that in order to get a dog into a calm state of mind that was the way to do it. A couple years ago we had two dogs that would fight once in a while(I could never find out the reason, I was never right there looking at them when it happened so I could never see what triggered it)and that's what I would do to diffuse it (1 arm for each dog basically) until they were calmly laying on their sides face to face and then I'd get up and walk away and everything would be fine. I just assumed that would always work."
dogs,3dv11j,GSpess,5,Sun Jul 19 23:44:05 2015 UTC,Yeah a lot of people are taught that alpha rolling is the best solution but really anything that stresses out or makes the dog uncomfortable isn't a good method. I had to change my methods of training from alpha rolling and other methods like it to only positive reinforcement and moving the dog away from situations that were overstimulating for him.  I would definitely try moving her to a different room and letting her cool off in there. Good luck. It probably won't be an easy thing to fix but I hope it works out for you. A lot of the problem lies with your mom so you should try to figure out how to handle or avoid her as best you can.
dogs,3dv11j,wingsofcolor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:48:24 2015 UTC,"What kind of exercise? For how long? How often? What about mental stimulation?  Are we talking simple walks, or like rigorous and exhausting exercise? Border Collies are VERY high energy working dogs, which often isn't catered to by otherwise well meaning owners. They really need to be pushed to their limits to satisfy their needs.   Have y'all tried redirecting her when she does that, and getting her to do something else? Get a ball, get a toy, etc...   Your mom should also take a strong part in her training and conditioning as well. Your mom needs to be patient and consistent and keep her cool, and treat the dog respectfully. She can work on getting the dog to redirect, or stop.. etc.   Now, you mention worrying about your mom and the dogs when alone... I personally had a bad experience with a roommate treating my dog poorly in front of me (or when not realizing I was there), and one day I had the curious thought ""What if I'm not around?"". I set up my laptop to record the camera, and what did I find? Her tormenting my dog with a broom, yelling at the dog, and straight being mean to him (the irony of which was she was a ""vegan"" who preached ethical treatment of animals). I found out that the bursts of what we saw when we were around were A LOT worse than when we weren't. I'd be interesting to know what that provides, because if you're mom is acting poorly towards the dog, the dog might be simply being reactive.  Most people here will be coy about matters with family, but I say fuck it. Call them out on it. If you're mom is at the core of the problem, she needs to see that."
dogs,3dv11j,notevenapro,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:55:28 2015 UTC,"Hey, thank you for the reply!  Tsuki gets a lot of excersize, we go out daily whether its sunshine, rain or snow. Brisk walking to a field and there we play fetch and we train commands until she's tired. On top of that there's 3 additional 15 minute walks at set times. She's not as high-energy as some border collies I know and tires out a bit quicker. We often go together with a neighbour that also has a border collie and he can keep going for forever while Tsuki eventually slows down after playing with him and kinda trudges along. We do a lot of trick training in the house and yard during the day and she's fantastic. She's not frustrated in that regard, I am 100% certain. She's always tired after our walks/sessions and goes to sleep.  I've tried time and again to explain to my mother she has to take part in that as you said as well as that she needs to be calmer and consistent.  When I am in that situation where she is anxiously running around I give her the command ''away'' which means for her to take distance. She is familiar with this command and follows it when I issue it to her. She usually walks to near the door and lies down and stays there but the location varies; all that matters is the distance. That's what I personally do and it works. She stays there and I can handle the situation that's going on. But I just can't get my mom to understand this because she doesn't listen to me. I'm 21 but she still treats me like I'm 12 and it's frustrating. If someone else is here for opening the door if the bell rings and she gets anxious I usually try to re direct her attention to me by grabbing some treats and having her perform some simple tricks, this works well enough.  My mom's dog is not fearful/anxious at all around her, it's only Tsuki so I'd be really upset if that were the case. ( I would probably move out asap )  I'm going to try and talk calm to my mom about all this tomorrow and plead with her to work with Tsuki (with me there ofc) on the leash a couple times and to really invest some time in getting Tsuki's trust and respect... I hope it works. :("
dogs,3dwdqi,SmuggleCats,4,Mon Jul 20 02:16:23 2015 UTC,"Did something outside scare him recently?  Fourth of July fireworks?  Thunderstorm?  Stung by a bee?  Snake in the grass?  Neighbor's dog?  Squeaky door hinge?  Do you have more than one entrance/exit to your house?  If so, is it just one door that causes this reaction, or is it all of them?  How are you making him go outside?  Does he still act scared after he gets outside?  It doesn't sound like regression in house training because 1) he still signals when he needs to go out, and 2) he's still waiting until he gets outside to do his business.  It sounds like something about going outside or being outside spooked him.  Try to see if you can lure him outside with treats.  You want outside to be a happy place, so give him lots of praise and treats when he gets outside."

He is happy to go out the front door because that's where we go for walks, but he doesn't ever poop when we go on walks so it wouldn't be viable to take him out there every time I don't think. To get him out I usually have to put my shoes on since it helps if I'm out there with him, but once he's out there he's fine he gets his business done and comes back to the door and is ready to come back inside.   Thanks for the help I just realized that event where he panicked and tried getting inside however he could might have been what scared him."

dogs,3dwzp2,sincerely-sacha,2,Mon Jul 20 07:26:50 2015 UTC,"I always advocate for daycare over dog walking. I'm in Canada as well and daycare costs are often the same price as a single hour-long walk from a dog walker. If your mother is willing to pick your dog up from daycare, if you perhaps commit to dropping it off, it will be MUCH easier for both you and your mother.  I had a full 9hr day in a lab last semester, and so my pup went all day to daycare, and he LOVED it! He still goes every once in a while, and really enjoys his time there. Some kennels offer daycare and are a little ways out of the city but really help to get the beans out of large dogs/puppies.  It may seem like a pain to your mom to do pick-up and drop-off, but it's once a week and honestly, it's more of a pain to be at home with a crazy puppy for hours upon hours. My daycare costs 20$ a day, and that would mean from 7am to 7pm your mom could be free to do whatever she wants at no cost to your pup, and from 7pm-9pm she could handle the puppy until you get home (however, I find after a day at daycare my dog usually naps for 3 hours)  Definitely suggesting daycare. I found when my pup was young that even one day of daycare is enough to result in a calmer puppy even the day afterwards."

dogs,3dutyj,DnMarshall,6,Sun Jul 19 18:15:50 2015 UTC,Doggy daycare may end up being a bad idea. I don't know how old he is but it sounds like he's not very socialized and while you can work on his issues with dogs (which I would recommend) he's still going to be a target for other dogs during play. I saw it a million times with my tripod and many times with other people's tripods. If he does end up being a target he'll just get a lot of frustrating experiences where he wants to be left alone but isn't which isn't good for socialization. I don't know if his size will make a difference and they'll choose to leave him alone and focus on other dogs but it's something to keep in mind.  Some dogs just aren't going to play with other dogs and that's okay. If he taps out in 5 minutes he's probably one of those dogs who just isn't going to be interested in other dogs. You can put a lot of work into socializing and getting him accustomed to other dogs but he may never reach the point where he's super thrilled to play and wants to do it for a long time.
dogs,3dutyj,WOOFCheCazzo,2,Sun Jul 19 19:39:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. We don't know a lot about his history because he was a stray before the accident. We do know that he played well with the dog in his foster home too, but you're right the stuff at the park is a big concern. Thanks!"
dogs,3dutyj,WOOFCheCazzo,3,Sun Jul 19 19:45:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I imagine for him it'd be easier to just find other ways to exercise him. My dog was fine with other dogs for the first year or so of his life but after awhile constantly being a target and getting tackled and chased by every dog in the park (sometimes being chased by 5+ dogs at a time) made him reach the point where he would start getting snippy during play. One day he got attacked by another dog and that was that. Within a minute or two of another dog trying to play with him he starts attacking.  I would recommend not being as dumb as I was and letting it get to that point.
dogs,3dutyj,WOOFCheCazzo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:37:52 2015 UTC,"It's not about the exercise really. He's a tiny dog and with 3 legs he gets tired easily. For me it's about having them as a boarding option. I'd rather leave him there then kennel him (my first choice is obviously dog sitters, but you never know).   I haven't noticed him being a target necessarily. The other dogs seemed to be being fine towards him. He just decides he is done."
dogs,3dutyj,WOOFCheCazzo,2,Sun Jul 19 21:46:43 2015 UTC,"Well if he doesn't get along with other dogs I'm assuming a kennel would be better (I don't really know the difference but I'm assuming doggy day cares let them play all day and crate at night?).  If he doesn't like other dogs then leaving him somewhere where he'll have to play with other dogs all day is a bad idea.  I'm glad he's not a target though. My dog was, and they liked to bite his chicken wing a lot when he played, so he definitely had a rough time. I've seen quite a few bigger tripods be targets too. I guess his size makes them not notice the missing leg or something? Who knows."

dogs,3duv3p,pullonyourfeet,2,Sun Jul 19 21:38:54 2015 UTC,"Haaaaaaave you considered Spanish Water Dogs? I know someone mentioned PWDs further down but Spanish are considerably smaller than a PWD, which I would suggest could grow to be bigger than a lab. Spanish are about the size of a working labrador. There's a thriving SWD community in the UK, loads of events organised, loads of health testing breeders, there's also a rescue.   Have some pros and cons because now I'm thinking about it.  Pros:    Fit your energy requirements Very biddable/trainable and extremely smart but with a independent thinking streak I think your terrier loving self would enjoy.  Get on with other dogs fabulously as long as they're socialised properly. Minimal coat care if you clip every 3 months (very easy to learn how to do this yourself, it's a single length all over with clippers) or every 6 months if you're willing to put in a tiny bit of work to prevent matting. This would involve gentle teasing of the coat with your fingers, can be done in front of the TV with the dog in your lap. Very happy in crates, really love having one for open access which they can put themselves away in if it all gets too much or whatever. No shedding except for purls of wool when the coat gets long, like what gets left at the edge of a sheep field. I know SWDs who are still charging around at 15. All breeders who are affiliated with the breed club health test, most breeders who aren't affiliated also health test.    Cons: (obviously ymmv because these are just general cons and I know very little about your personal circumstances which might make these not a con)   They require fairly intense socialisation and have an extremely strong second fear stage, which generally means you need to resocialise them when they get to about 10 months - 1 year.  They guard like little warriors and are extremely vocal about doing so. Obviously this can be trained away but from experience most SWDs will announce when people arrive at the door.  Their coat can be seen to be high maintenance, I don't think it is but this is very much a YMMV thing.  If under socialised, fear aggression is a thing which happens.  Some dogs from some lines can have very high drive, this makes them excellent dogs when they have a 'job' and an outlet for this drive, but it is certainly a con for some people. Conversely, some dogs are uber relaxed and very chill. Again, also could  be a con. They are extremely smart, this means bad habits can be picked up as quickly as good ones. Biscuit can open all the doors in the house if she wants to. We have had to install locks.    I can't think of anything else right now... but I hope this gives you a good idea of what this breed is. :D"

dogs,3duv3p,Hobbes579,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:58:05 2015 UTC,"+1! I know a great Shiba Inu breeder in Ireland, too.  Have you considered any of the mid-sized Japanese breeds? Kai Ken, Kishu Ken, Shikoku Ken, or Hokkaido Ken? There is one Shikoku in the UK on the Isle of Mann and two Kishu Ken in northern England. The Shikoku is from a breeder in Holland and the Kishu Ken are from Czech.   If you like a biddable dog, the Kishu is a little more stubborn than the others. My Shikoku is very people-responsive and wants to do things for me. I've heard Hokkaido and Kai are a little more biddable and the ones I've met have been very into their owners.  Don't know if importing is an option for you and that might write off the mid-sized breeds for you if it isn't, but it's possible in general."

So a few times I picked him up and brought him in with me and just sat and gave him treats. We did this several times until he was no longer afraid of the bathroom.  Then we started with turning on the water, treating for a bit with it running, and leaving the bathroom. Did it several times until he no longer hid by the door.  Then we made him sit in the tub and repeated. Finally I had my brother sit with me every time he got a bath and give him chicken or something every 30-45 seconds and slowly built our way up to only getting treats every few minutes.  Now he loves bath time. Every time I use the restroom he races in with me and looks in the tub and even hops in on occasion to sniff around and see if he can find treats."

We have a concrete patio with a wooden deck with outdoor rugs. It's a super comfortable outdoor living room.   I got those Burts Bees doggie wipes at Petco. I trust the company for myself and she doesn't seem to be bothered by them. She tolerates a wipe down pretty well, but she's still going to need an actual bath with shampoo every 6-8 weeks. Plus, she's a short hair so she can certainly get that dog smell going on."
dogs,3dw88j,cygnuswomyn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:20:23 2015 UTC,It works great. It took us a few months (though we didn't do daily work or anything. Just slowly easing into it) and now he loves it. For the first time ever the other day he actually sat next to the faucet instead of at the edge of the tub away from it. Bath time has gotten much much smoother and I use this method for anything he's afraid of.
dogs,3dsbc9,lukestauntaun,120,Sat Jul 18 23:53:59 2015 UTC,"Mine also died this way. Another got it and had emergency surgery done since she was young.  Tips to prevent stomach bloat and torsion, correct name being gastric dialation-volvulus (GDV):   Most common in deep chested dogs. If you are having your dog spayed, request that they pin their stomach while they are in there, there is a very minimal cost and could be life saving.  They suture the stomach to the abdominal wall so that they will fuse and the stomach will be unable to move. Feed smaller meals more frequently. Do not exercise for at least 2 hours before or after eating and make them rest. Do not allow them to tank up on a lot of water at once and ideally allow for rest afterwards if they do. Edit: (can't believe I forgot this one) Don't let your dog 'inhale' their food.  If they eat too quickly, get them a slow-feed bowl.  Dogs that eat too fast and ""inhale"" air while they eat is extremely risky and can set this off to happen.   Things to watch for:   Distended stomach. Hollow sounding abdomen when you tap it. UNPRODUCTIVE VOMITING SHOULD GO TO THE EMERGENCY VET IMMEDIATELY. This includes that foam that OP mentioned.  (I had a standard poodle that was acting completely normal, except that over the course of about half an hour she kept on trying to throw up, but would only get drool and nothing else.  Took her to emergency vet and had emergency surgery.  She recovered just fine and vet told me that rushing her there saved her life.) Pale or white or blue gums. they may look like they are trying to hunch over when walking, back will be arched and they might kind of hop with their back legs.   Edited 'things to watch for'"
dogs,3dsbc9,CaptainHelium,29,Sun Jul 19 01:03:44 2015 UTC,Thank you for putting this here.  It's just so fast.  It was less than 30 hours and the vet was so calm about it that we felt we could be too.
dogs,3dsbc9,CaptainHelium,10,Sun Jul 19 01:08:35 2015 UTC,"The worst part is how painful it is for them.  At first they seem fine but later...man it sucks.

dogs,3dsbc9,deezy139,10,Sun Jul 19 01:14:03 2015 UTC,What is unproductive vomiting?
dogs,3dsbc9,CaptainHelium,18,Sun Jul 19 01:48:03 2015 UTC,"when they are acting like they are trying to vomit but nothing (or very little) is coming up.  Don't panic if your dog does this once, sometimes it can be normal.  If they do it a few times for seemingly no reason is when you should be alert.  Usually with bloat you might get a little foam, but usually nothing.  You will not get bile coming up with GDV (since bile come from the stomach and when bloating happens, the 'tube' that drops food into your stomach is twisted, so that anything in the stomach will not be able to come up.  Usually when dogs are bloated, they will refuse to eat.  But don't panic right away if your dog eats something and starts to gag and cough and regurgitate it.  Thats normal."
dogs,3dsbc9,deezy139,5,Sun Jul 19 01:57:31 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, thanks for the reply. Follow up question, is bloat more of a concern for older dogs, younger dogs, or no real correlation?"

My vet encourages it during spays for almost all dogs.  It costs a lot to have it done as a separate surgery, but going forward I'm having it done on all my females when they go to get spayed as preventative since they're right there anyway.  You can save a little money if you have it done when they're already under anesthesia for like, a teeth cleaning or something but not sure how much, ask next time for sure."

dogs,3dsbc9,AprilFool99,10,Sun Jul 19 04:28:26 2015 UTC,"I am so very sorry for your loss.  No matter how long they are with us it is never long enough.  My condolences to you and your family.  For anyone who owns a dog of ANY breed, any time a dog vomits without producing anything but foam, and cannot get comfortable (up, down, walk a few steps, lie down, up again, etc.) and presents with an abdomen that is distended and firm to the touch, bloat should be suspected.  This insidious disease can take them from us in a matter of hours unless surgery is done to correct it.  Gastric dilatation and volvulus is the correct name for it, and essentially what happens is that the stomach flips over and basically switches places with the spleen.  The blood supply to the intestine is compromised and unless corrective surgery is done almost immediately, the intestine dies.  When bloat is diagnosed, some time can be bought by putting a large tube into the stomach to decompress it, relieving some of the pressure.  Surgery must follow within an hour or so to ensure that the dog's life can hopefully be saved.  In an older dog, the chances of survival are lessened depending on how much internal damage is done by the event.  Even in successful surgeries, often times there is damage to the intestine that results in the loss of the dog days afterward.  There is a procedure done called prophylactic gastropexy where the stomach is sutured to the abdominal wall so that it cannot flip again, because once a dog bloats, it CAN bloat again, it's not something that the animal can develop an immunity to once it survives it once.  Even though it is common in larger, deep chested breeds, it can happen in any breed of any size.  Learn to read your dogs carefully so that you can advise your vet that you suspect that it is not just an upset stomach if your dog is showing other signs of the disease.  Don't allow your dog to guzzle water on a hot day after running around, don't exercise him strenuously soon after eating.  If you do not free feed your dog, try to feed him at the same time(s) each day with small snacks in between so that he doesn't build up acid or gas from being hungry.  Never allow him to gorge himself on food or water after being overly excited over something (lawnmower, thunderstorm, whatever else he might get excited or nervous over).  Calm him down first to lessen chances of indigestion."

I lost my Akita (13), Boxer (12) and my pitty boy (7) to bloat and torsion. My Akita was already in shock by the time I found her. It is terrifying and heartbreaking.  It is shockingly quick and early signs mimic so many innocuous ailments. As long as I live  I will never forget that feeling of urgency and hope, getting to the ER fast enough before torsion made recovery nearly impossible.  Bloat is a frightening condition and one I hope to never lose another dog to. I recently brought home a Boxer pup. When he was neutered, at 9 months, I opted to have a procedure called Gastropexy performed. The stomach is sutured in place. It does not prevent bloat, but does prevent the torsion that too often proves fatal. This give you more time to reach medical help and save your dog's life.  Though this is of little consolation to you and your family, it may be of some help to others reading your post.  I am truly sorry and hope in time you all come to realize that Jordan was loved, cared for and safe with your family. He enjoyed a life of comfort and companionship."

dogs,3dsbc9,greencollar316,4,Sun Jul 19 05:53:34 2015 UTC,Losing a dog naturally isn't nearly as traumatizing as losing a dog so quickly to a sudden on-set thing like bloat.  Twice.
dogs,3dsbc9,Cptrunner,4,Sun Jul 19 06:06:41 2015 UTC,so sorry to hear this.  it's one of my worst fears.  it happens so fast.  it sounds like he was a good boy and had a wonderful life with you and your family.  please post pictures if you feel up to it.

dogs,3dsbc9,deadcollegestudent,5,Sun Jul 19 00:20:21 2015 UTC,"It was leashed, but he was very docile and the 5 and 3 year old took turns holding the leash.  He'd always go slow and easy when they held it.  Not sure about eating.  I wasn't home from work yet, and the wife doesn't normally feed him until after my daughter goes to bed."

dogs,3dsbc9,badstewie,3,Sun Jul 19 00:57:41 2015 UTC,"That's awful, I'm sorry for your loss. Bloat is something always on the back of my mind. A vet friend of mine just had a case of bloat at her office - they recognized it in time but the dog was very old and it would have been a couple thousand to operate, so the owners opted to put him down. It's horrible and sometimes it truly just happens with no obvious cause."
dogs,3dsbc9,petmamano1,3,Sun Jul 19 01:05:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you for posting this. My dog died of gastric torsion seven years ago, and I was able to recognize the signs because of a blogger I followed who told the story of how her dog died, and from reading Marley and Me. My old fella died anyway that night, but I feel like I was able to reduce his suffering a little by recognizing the symptoms more quickly. Your post is likely to do the same for someone else."
dogs,3dsbc9,PlayfulPunches,3,Sun Jul 19 14:30:44 2015 UTC,"I lost one of the best dogs I'd ever had to bloat. He was a big, beautiful and healthy Newfoundland. His name was Harry. The vet said it was unusual since he was only 4 years old but there was nothing we could do to save him. I miss him and the conversations we'd have and his sass. It sucks to lose them to something like bloat"

I have a deep-chested dog who vomits up foam a couple times a month, and will eat snow or drink ice water until he throws up. I never heard about bloat before this. I will definitely stop feeding him soon before or after walks, space out his meals, and do so more research."

dogs,3dva1r,Wellas,11,Sun Jul 19 20:31:45 2015 UTC,"Well, firstly you can't leave a puppy alone for 8hrs so your going to need to change your age range to the 1-2yr mark. Older dogs don't bond any less strongly and they are often easier to train. Also, a Golabrador (or whatever) isn't a breed and if anyone is trying to sell you one, run (don't walk) away. Still, 45minutes really isn't that much for any breed especially medium-large high energy breeds, small companion breeds might better suit your lifestyle. For health concerns cross of German Shephers because they are prone to all sorts of issues unless you make the effort to buy one from a reputable breeder. Maybe a lab mix but 45minutes is not nearly enough exercise for one."
dogs,3dva1r,unclear_outcome,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:49:01 2015 UTC,"Goldador is just something I can google to find information on Golden/Lab retriever mixes.  A minimum of 45 minutes per day of jogging, playing fetch, swimming is not enough?  What would you call enough?"
dogs,3dva1r,caffeinatedlackey,3,Sun Jul 19 20:53:24 2015 UTC,"45 minutes per day is definitely not enough for a lab or golden. They need serious hours of exercise to keep them happy and sane, especially when they're puppies."

dogs,3dva1r,Hermago,2,Sun Jul 19 22:32:04 2015 UTC,45 minutes of HEAVY exercise is fine if you are also spending some time on mental exercise. I know you see people suggesting 4 hours a day and other crazy numbers for high energy breeds but its not necessary with proper training.  As a comparison my trainer raises protection dogs... they have 4 Malinois and 2 GSD and those dogs get about an hour a day. Occasionally they are going to be worked for hours and hours and hours... but that's where your hikes etc. come in.  The key difference is that from a very young age the dogs are taught... be calm when we are not working (they stay in crates generally) and then GO GO GO GO GO when we are working. They are either chilling out just normal in the crate or... they are like a raging storm of energy being worked.
dogs,3dva1r,MockingbirdRambler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:03:31 2015 UTC,"That sounds much more reasonable, and I can accommodate those needs. Thanks."
dogs,3dva1r,nkdeck07,2,Mon Jul 20 02:39:00 2015 UTC,I'd say for dogs like the labrador and the GSD you'd spend on average 2 hours a day doing a mix of physical and mental exercise. Unless you enjoy your dog finding his own fun.
dogs,3dva1r,MockingbirdRambler,7,Sun Jul 19 22:15:00 2015 UTC,"If you are worried about seious medical issues you need to do one of these things   Find a breed you like and research issues within the breed.  Once you know what the issues in the breed are you can find out what genetic tests breeders can do to prevent their bloodlines from producing dogs with the issue. Once you know the tests, you only look at breeders who can prove they have tested all the dogs in their breeding program, along with puppies from the same littler, (half and full) brother,sisters, grandparents.  Breeders who test, prove and dont breed the dogs who can carry the bad genes are worth buying a pup from.   Or   Go to the shelter and find the must muttly mutt mutt you can find who looks nothing like any two particular breeds and find a young adult you like.  Personally if I were looking for an active mutt as a hiking partner I would get hip x-rays to make sure they are not dysplasic before adoption, especially if it looks sort of Shepherdy or sort of labby. With mixes torn ACLs are more common then in purebreds, and that will stop any and all hiking.   50/50 mixes like the Golden/Lab are more likley then purebreds of good lines to have genetic health issues like cancer, thiroid, early arthritis, joint issues.  People who breed mixes pretend that they get to cherry pick the best traits from both breeds and shove them into a puppy, when in fact they are producing unpredictable puppies.  Mixed breeders also dont adhear to any ethics as far as heath testing and producing dogs ofgood genetics and long lifespans."
dogs,3dva1r,MockingbirdRambler,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:49:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip and I will look into it.  Two questions I will ask at the risk of being embarrassed:   The breeders that can prove this long line of testing are going to be far more expensive, yes? Is it true that the most muttly mutt mutt I can find probably has a good chance of also being pretty dumb?"
dogs,3dva1r,neurochip,6,Sun Jul 19 20:55:09 2015 UTC,"The breeders that can prove this long line of testing are going to be far more expensive, yes?   No, they will be basically competent. Essentially any breeder that you should be supporting is going to be a minimum of $1-2k on a puppy because of the health tests and understanding of breeding. You could go to the pet-store or get a dog off craigslist and you'd be supporting some horrible breeding conditions/practices as well as almost guarantee a lot of expensive medical bills in your future (especially since the breeds you are looking at are insanely prone to cancer and hip displasyia) Here's a good article on why you need to always make the effort to support good breeders. http://rufflyspeaking.net/i-dont-want-a-show-dog-i-just-want-a-pet/   Is it true that the most muttly mutt mutt I can find probably has a good chance of also being pretty dumb?   If so someone really needs to tell my dog. I am pretty sure she's starting to understand English and our bext guess at breed is border collie + ?. If anything you'd be more likely to wind up with a fairly intelligent dog as ""dogs"" on their own without interference from humans wind up pretty smart. Think like the stray dogs in Russia or the street dogs in Puerto Rico. Generally speaking they are considered highly intelligent and that's what tends to happen when enough dogs just go to total mutt."

dogs,3dva1r,neurochip,2,Sun Jul 19 22:39:23 2015 UTC,"I would look into sporting breeds, most of the retrievers are going to be more bidable, less prey driven and more person oriented rather then most of the pointing or flushing dogs who are also generally higher energy.  I would go onto Wikipedia and look at retrievering breed dog list, then click the links, if you see a breed who catches your eye and who sounds like a good fit go to google and type in   ""__________ retriever club of Southern California""and read up on the breed, health issues and then call the breeder recomendation contact person and chat with them about the breed a little more."

Eh, I guess. My friend is an APBT breeder who is very involved in that community, shows and sports all of her dogs, does every health test available and only breeds genetically and mentally sound dogs, but still only charges about $500-$600 a pup. She doesn't make much money off of them, if any at all, as she only breeds for herself and not others with a litter every few years. She's the best breeder I know.   There are breeders worthy of support who sell pups for less than $1k, just be mindful and wary.   edit: That sounded a little more argumentative than I intended, sorry! Generally speaking, I would agree with you!"
dogs,3dva1r,MockingbirdRambler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:15:02 2015 UTC,Your friend is really really the exception though. I'm actually not entirely sure I agree with the rate she's charging as apbts are so likely to wind up in the wrong hands
dogs,3dva1r,kittenpyjamas,2,Mon Jul 20 12:35:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, totally! I've brought that up with her before. She really, really screens prospective buyers. She's never had a puppy wind up in a shelter (though has taken a couple back, IIRC), and is still in touch with everyone who has ever bought a puppy from her.  I do agree that she's the exception, though! But it's worth to note that people like her do exist."
dogs,3dva1r,wingsofcolor,4,Mon Jul 20 18:35:05 2015 UTC,"You will pay more in the beggining for a blank slate, well bred pup, but the benefits are so amazing.  I bought my first blue blooded, top bred pup 18 months ago and I did not just buy myself a health pup with good genetics.    I paid 1200 for a dog who could become everything I demanded out of a dog, I paid for 50 generations of champion hunting and show dogs who have solid hunting ability, sound conformation to work all day and hold up to high pressue training.  It covers 8 weeks of amazing handling by the breeder who because of the nature of work my pup would be used for did amazing socilization with people, smells, noise and stress. It paid for a toll free 24/7/365 hot line direct to the breeder who knows my pup and my breed better then I will ever, she and her husband have a combined 60 years experience hunting with her bloodlines. She can tell me about my pups great grandpa and how the issues I am having were solved with his father and half siblings.    So while 1200 seems like a lot, the support, knowldge and help that I get is 100% worth it.    Mutty mutt mutts are not dumb, you just loose all predictability of what their motivations and drives are.   So for example my pup is motivated by playing ball, I can get him to do damn near anything for his tennis ball, because he is a water reteriver.  I also know my pup has high high hunt drive, I can tell him to seek and he will spend hours looking for human scent because he was created and specially bred for 200 years of having this hunt drive. Same with prey.  With a mutty mutt mutt you have no idea if it is going to show herding drive, protection.  You also loose predictablity of temperment and personality.  With my pup I knew he would be bold, adventerous and outgoing as a breed and I would have to fuxk him up real good.  With a mutty puppy you really dont know temperment until full maturity at two years.  I know a little GSD mix who came from a resuce situation where her mom gave birth at an amazing GSD breeders place. The pup wasraised right from the start, just like my pup had been raised, but genetically this puppy was a mess as far as shy, anxious and aloof. Which is a real bummer because the puppy raiser and new owner are great people, but you cant always overcome genetics."

dogs,3dv7js,barkingfree,10,Sun Jul 19 21:30:48 2015 UTC,"The general rule of thumb here is that if you're gone for more than 8 hours, you should hire a dog walker or someone to let the dog out in the middle of the day. Crate training also can help, if you're not comfortable letting the dog have free roam of the house while you're gone  I personally think that it's totally fine to have a dog and work full time, it's not selfish at all if you give the dog the attention and stimulation they need when you're at home. Just be warned though, you'll have to gauge how much energy this dog has, and if you'll be able to fit appropriate exercise into your schedule. Most dogs need about an hour a day, but high energy dogs need way more, like 2-3 hours."
dogs,3dv7js,serebear,2,Sun Jul 19 20:15:12 2015 UTC,Many people who have dogs work full time and lots of good points were already made. I guess all I can say now is if you get a dog then do your research first and have a plan in place.
dogs,3dv7js,DutchessPeabody,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:21:05 2015 UTC,"Depends on the dog. We used to leave our dog for 8 hours, she'd have run of the house and just nap. We got a second dog who needs to be let out more often so we have a dog walker. You could even potty pad train. Any dog would be happier with a human of their own that loves them then in a shelter. That's just my 2 cents."
dogs,3dv7js,asire_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:19:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly?  In the US, over a million pitbulls/pit mixes are put down every year.  Millions more live a sad existence in shelters.  If you can commit to exercising the dog before and after work as well as having your dad come by as often as possible.  And you are willing to put in the effort to find a dog that is as ok as possible being alone (ie don't adopt the first dog you fall in love with, but get one that actually firs your life).   AND (this is important) you understand what you're getting into with a bully breed - possible dog aggression, difficulty finding places to rent, people's reactions to your dog's breed - then the life you are offering the dog is better than what it's currently living.  That's my bottom line.    If you aren't in the US, then the circumstances are probably really different."
dogs,3dv7js,goldfish_king,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:23:31 2015 UTC,Are you able to hire a dog walker to let it out once in the afternoon if it turns out the dog isn't up for 8 hours without a potty break? If so I don't see an issue.
dogs,3dv7js,goldfish_king,2,Sun Jul 19 20:38:42 2015 UTC,Not really on my wages. My father would be able to call round and walk it for a few hours every other day. So that'll help i guess.
dogs,3dv7js,goldfish_king,-1,Sun Jul 19 20:47:18 2015 UTC,"I think you need to be cognizant of the fact that some dogs aren't able to be left alone that long, at least not without working up to it, and have a plan in place to deal with that.

dogs,3dwgsu,Trentorr,4,Mon Jul 20 02:44:23 2015 UTC,"I suspect the thing about dogs going away to die is a myth. Maybe dogs that are sick are sometimes too weak to come home, leading to the idea that they wanted to die alone.  Dogs crave human companionship. Of course every dog and dog owner is different, but most of the time I think it's best for both of you if you can be there to provide comfort in her final moments."
dogs,3dwgsu,HeyXKid,3,Mon Jul 20 03:02:23 2015 UTC,"A friend of ours (who lived out in rural Pennsylvania beside a mountain range) told us that their first dog, in his old age, - usually standoffish and not the cuddling type - came to them and snuggled a bit and licked them and stayed close with them for a few hours. He then went back outside and they followed, knowing he was acting weird. He walked out towards the mountains by himself (which he never does) and never came back.  Seems like he was quite healthy, just old and figured it was his time. Said bye, then left. Seems like that's what happened, but I guess you can't be sure. So it might not be a total myth with certain dogs."
dogs,3dwgsu,ohgosh_thejosh,2,Mon Jul 20 04:37:37 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. My father's dog crawled into his lap and then passed, that's where she wanted to be.  When people euthanize their animals, it's a very personal choice as to whether or not they will be there. Some prefer to have happy memories of them and their pets, in that their last memory will be of the animal alive, whereas others feel it's their responsibility to be with the animal until it's last breath and will be by it's side till the end.  Personally, I will always do my best to be with my dogs in their final moments. Their entire life centres around me, they are apart of events in my life without choice, and it is my responsibility to be with them until the end. It was my choice to get a dog, my choice to enjoy the good moments, and I refuse to abandon my dogs in their last moments for selfish reasons. I put my dog down in the fall, and it was the hardest thing I've ever done, but being there with him was important to me. I don't regret it whatsoever.  Edit: I'm spending some time at a vet clinic, we had a dog brought in who they chose to euthanize, he had a heart condition that basically was the end of the road for the poor guy. He looked healthy at the time but was likely to decline quickly, and so they made the choice to say goodbye and have some last moments with him, and let the technicians be with him when he was euthanized. That's not an uncommon option."
dogs,3dwgsu,sincerely-sacha,2,Mon Jul 20 03:19:59 2015 UTC,"If a dog is truly about to die, they're likely in pain and also not thinking quite as clearly. I wouldn't take much of what they seem to try to do as an indication of their wishes, just in the same way that a hurt dog may bite its owner. It doesn't truly mean to, but pain can warp the mind momentarily.  I've missed seeing dogs put to sleep and I've watched my childhood dog die (not from euthanasia). The latter was extremely painful for me but stronger than the pain was the relief that someone was with her at the end. I beat myself up for years for missing one dog's euthanasia even though I had no control (being eight at the time). I'll always be there for the final moments, I owe it to them after shaping their entire existence."

dogs,3dtwv6,adrenal_out,6,Mon Jul 20 00:16:58 2015 UTC,"When we got our ex-racing greyhound he didn't know how to bark, play, or even wag his tail. Our malamute-herding dog mix taught him everything he knows, and she loved to bark. Usually greyhounds aren't much of barkers.  His first barks were high pitched, uncertain squeeks. Now he barks like a German shepherd.  We're sure he's going to pass on the mantle to the poodle puppy we're getting in 4 months. In a way, my old girl will probably live on in the barking legacy that might get passed down for decades."
dogs,3dtwv6,Geek4Dogs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:01:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, our greyhound learned lots of things from her foster siblings (stairs, sliding glass doors) and then normal dog things from her dog friends in the neighborhood (play fighting, snuggling)."
dogs,3dtwv6,theastrosloth,2,Sun Jul 19 17:20:55 2015 UTC,"Stairs were rough! Ours took a while to generalize stairs (that all stairs are stairs, not a completely new obstacle to learn to deal with from the ground up every time). Luckily he did figure them out though."
dogs,3dtwv6,Geek4Dogs,3,Sun Jul 19 17:26:33 2015 UTC,"Yes! Both good and bad. My parents'  Whippet is a year older than our Willow. Willow was very resistant to walks at first, even with treats. She didn't really understand what she was supposed to do. My parents brought their dog, who loves walks, up for the weekend. One walk together and it clicked for Willow. She loves walks now and does not have to be encouraged to not lay down.   On the other hand my Parents' Whippet hides treats and stuff in the couches etc. He did this at our house and now Willow has picked up this behavior as well. Which is quiet annoying when I have to look under and behind every piece of furniture for her treat ball every meal."
dogs,3dtwv6,RufflesMe,2,Sun Jul 19 13:14:13 2015 UTC,"Yes our older dogs teach our pug puppy things. Like how to use the doggie door to go out to potty! 13 weeks old and she goes out, every time she's gotta potty! We are so proud!( yeah i know it sounds stupid to be proud of such a thing lol). And they showed her how to ""ask"" for a cookie. And how to ""ask"" to get up in bed to watch tv lol. And how to hide her toys under the couch lol."
dogs,3dtwv6,VividLotus,2,Sun Jul 19 20:28:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, our senior dog taught our puppy to go to the bathroom outside. We literally did not have to do anything to house train her, other than making sure to take her outside often enough for her tiny puppy bladder.  Nevertheless, her behavior in general has turned out to be totally different from his, showing what a strong influence breed has on dog behavior."

dogs,3dv4z3,homehealthgirl,6,Sun Jul 19 19:56:52 2015 UTC,"Like /u/homehealthgirl said, he really needs to learn to go outside to potty, using pee pads teaches him to eliminate on anything that looks like a pad, like fabric."
dogs,3dv4z3,barkingfree,4,Sun Jul 19 19:59:45 2015 UTC,"From one of my comments on a similar post a few months ago:   Can I first ask why you're looking to use potty pads? We used them initially with our rescue chihuahua because she was afraid to even walk out of the apartment, let alone down to the grass, and peeing on it was out of the question. We did this for ~3 months before the pup was comfortable being outside, and now we're transitioning away from the potty pads. If there is chance that you will EVER be fully housebreaking your pup, I suggest you strongly consider doing it sooner rather than later - it's a serious pain in the ass to try to teach her to ""unlearn"" something that we had previously rewarded her for. I'm kicking myself a bit for not being more patient and forcing her to at least pee on the stoop outside the apartment"
dogs,3dv4z3,blimeyfool,4,Sun Jul 19 20:19:27 2015 UTC,"Step #1 Buy crate if you don't have one already  Step #2 Return any unopened packages of pee pads to store if you have the receipt otherwise do an exchange. Also buy a bottle of nature miracle and clean your floors.  Step #3 Set up your routine. Take pup outside first thing in the morning when waking up. Walk on leash, and do whatever until he goes. Give treat and lots of praise. Go inside. Repeat  after he's been fed, playing and any naps. At just over 3 months he should be able to hold it for at least 3 hours. If he's not holding it for that long, take him out more often. Again treats and lots of praise.  Step #4 Never look back towards pee pads."
dogs,3dv4z3,PommeDeSang,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:42:14 2015 UTC,I think that's fair. I will get rid of the pads but my only question is what to do if he goes in the house? Should we scold him and take him outside or just not give him any attention?  Thanks

Keep the dog in a crate or tethered to you, take him out every half hour after eating, he only goes outside to potty. If he does not potty, inside and in a crate for 30 minutes and try again.  This keeps him from goinng out, fucking around then coming in and peeing. If he pees, then freetime outside."

dogs,3du13w,ERROR404_userdeleted,12,Sun Jul 19 13:38:00 2015 UTC,"Totally normal! Offer him food, if he doesn't want it try again later. A healthy dog won't starve himself for long.  My male didn't eat hardly anything for the seven days he was in the shelter and then waited another three days with me before eating.  Give it some time :)"
dogs,3du13w,homehealthgirl,7,Sun Jul 19 13:48:46 2015 UTC,"Hi! I have two huskies- one i got as a pup and the other i got at 1 year old. I have also fostered a few, normally coming in severely underweight.   The thing about huskies- they'll most of the time eat the bare minimum to keep going and that's about it. I have issues keeping weight on mine. There are surely fat huskies who will eat everything but many pick and choose and just basically can't be bothered eating half the time.   What I did with my one year old when I first got him-   I leave dry food out in the morning which my two pick at during the day. They 90% of the time finish by dinner. Many people say don't leave food out for dogs but honestly it has never been an issue for us and huskies normally self regulate VERY well.  Use something super tasty but mix it into what you want him to eat. Her wants that egg but not his kibble? Mix that shit in there so he has to eat it to get to the egg. If he wants to try to eat around it, let him. I went to a pet store and got ""liver sprinkles"" which worked awesome. Give him time. He wont starve himself. May take a few days and that's fine. Don't just bring out the good stuff- he'll learn to be fussy.   I know many people will disagree with leaving food out and tell you to do the ""leave it for ten minutes, take it away, try again next meal"" thing. Honestly my dog dropped 2kg when i did that and didn't work as well as what i described. Huskies are weird."
dogs,3du13w,jessajuhanabi,6,Sun Jul 19 14:07:59 2015 UTC,I feel you stress.  Got a rescue last Monday who did not poop till Wednesday.  Dogs get stressed by new environment and people.  Just give the pup time to settle in.
dogs,3du13w,cygnuswomyn,4,Sun Jul 19 14:20:21 2015 UTC,"He could just be stressed, give him a few days to adjust. Most dogs will not starve themselves, just remember he's bee through a lot recently. Though I would still make sure he is drinking.  Also it is important to remember that huskies are grazers. Most of the time they prefer to pick at their food throughout the day instead if eating it all at once, so if you don't have any other animals who will try and steal it, why not try leaving it out for him"
dogs,3du13w,serebear,3,Sun Jul 19 15:29:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe you have tried this, and it may not work but I have had picky dogs devour entire bowls of food immediately. Try soaking dry food in hot water (as hot as your tap will make it) for about 10 minutes. Sometimes I think the hot water makes it a bit more aromatic.  Otherwise, what people have already said about being stressed due to a new environment is accurate.  Best of luck!"
dogs,3du13w,jersey_ron,3,Sun Jul 19 16:16:59 2015 UTC,Our shelter dog didn't eat for two days after we got him. We went to the vet (totally unrelated) and when we mentioned it they told us it was completely normal for the first few days while they adjust not to eat.
dogs,3du13w,KaiEli,3,Sun Jul 19 17:08:25 2015 UTC,"This often happens with a dog who has been rehomed and Huskys are notoriously fussy/minimal eaters at the best of times. Don't panic. A healthy dog is not going to let themselves starve, but some dogs only eat once every two days, for example.  Set the routine you want now - if you are going to free feed or have dinner times, feed dry kibble or raw food or even cook him chicken and rice every day - decide now and stick to it. In a few days, he'll have the new normal worked out.   Although some dogs are eternally hungry, some are not. One of my dogs occasionally picks at breakfast, but usually leaves it. At 7.30 pm I pick up the still-full bowl from the morning and put it down again. Now it has magically transmografied into dinner, and she will throw herself head first into it with relish, because dinner is delicious."

dogs,3dvb2f,Natalie30,11,Sun Jul 19 20:40:14 2015 UTC,"If your dog is the one making the racket it's your responsibility to deal with it, not theirs to restrict their dogs to a part of their yard. Just how it goes. I'd work on positive reinforcement training, reward him for being quiet and ignoring the other dog(s). Punishing him won't work.   Mine walks right by dogs barking at their fence or even on the other side of the street pulling and barking and she just ignores them or looks at them, never barks. Part of why is that I also show those dogs no interest and she cues off me. A lot is just her mild nature.   You do need to be sure there's no dog aggression there, as they'd be within their right to stop it by any means if he did get in their yard and attempt to do harm."
dogs,3dvb2f,Azara1th,8,Sun Jul 19 20:55:33 2015 UTC,"The problem here is you and your dog, therefor you need to be taking responsibility. If your dog is going to break down the fence, you need to reinforce it to make sure that doesn't happen. If your dog is making a ruckus, you need to train her to stop. These are your neighbors, so you know where to find them. If you have a solution to the problem that your dog is creating, you can always talk with them in person and see if they will work with you on something, but other than that, they are free to use their property and space as they please.   Get a professional trainer involved. This does not seem like a problem that could not be easily solved. The real issue isn't them, it's the one with the dog that goes berserk when something dares to come near his space. Take responsibility for it and get a trainer instead of trying to place blame on your neighbors."
dogs,3dvb2f,stormeegedon,3,Sun Jul 19 21:06:51 2015 UTC,"I've actually been in a similar position to you. Last year a little girl about 8-9 years old used to walk her small and horribly trained yippy dog past my house every day. Now when I say she would walk past my house I really mean repetitively in front of my front window while her dog yippy and barked like there is no tomorrow.  She would stand there purposely getting my dog going for upwards of 10  minutes at a time if I didn't tell her to go away. Jada would absolutely freak out because the girl and her dog would purposely tease her and a few times I was worried she would break through my window.   One day I had Jada tied up out back while I was cleaning the house and the girl and her dog showed up and stood just outside of Jada's reach (I live in base housing and do not have a fenced off backyard) now you could imagine what weeks worth of teasing like that does to a dog. Well I guess she finally passed her breaking point because my 95lbs dog snapped clean through the wire tether rated for 150lbs dogs,knocked over the little girl and grabbed the yippy little thing. She never hurt it (thank god) she grabbed it by the scruff of the neck and pinned it to the ground. By the time I got outside the little girls parents were there and she was crying. The little yippy thing was still squealing and I pretty much had to drag Jada back into the house.  Naturally I had a long talk with my neighbor, offered to pay any vet bills (there were none the dog was just scared shitless) and offered to have them bring the little girl over to meet Jada in a controlled environment so she could see that my big black ""scary"" dog is really just a dope. I also went out that afternoon and bought an actual chain and an e-collar and got into contact with a trainer to ensure that nothing like this would ever happen again.   Now because of the reactions of both dogs I will never be able to introduce them face to face but we have come to accept that there are just some dogs that will just never get along and because the smaller dog is only like 8lbs I don't think they would ever play together anyways. To this day that is the only dog Jada has ever had an issue with and thanks to the Trainer and e-collar I am far more confident in my control.  Now back to your issue. I know it sucks that the blame will ultimately fall on you if anything were to happen especially if the other dogs are instigators and their families are to lazy/stupid to train their dogs properly. Still it would be beneficial for you to hire a trainer anyways because you should always be able to control your dog no matter the circumstances. There will always be people who don't properly train their dogs and you want your dog to be able to ignore these potential disasters be it a fight with the neighbors or someone you meet on the street.   On another note I am a fan of the e-collar when used properly. Mine does tone and vibration as well as shock (I don't actually use the shock) and is great not only for training but for off leash hikes. I usually use it if the dog gets too far ahead of me or I'd getting to close to an edge. Of couse positive reinforcement is always better in my book but there is a time and a place. If you do go this rout be sure to talk to a trainer and do lots of research though. Make sure you use it right!  (Sorry this is so long >. <)"

dogs,3dvr5z,CodyHowellMusic,19,Sun Jul 19 22:56:45 2015 UTC,"Everyone thinks their dog is great, but what you really need to breed is objective proof of that. Titles and health clearances. Usually, the bitch's owner seeks out the stud's owner, not the other way around.   Where did you get him from? If you got him from a reputable breeder, they would be the first person you'd need to talk to. Most breeders are fiercely protective of the dogs they create and also don't want their dogs breeding with some ""skanky doodle"" so they have contracts that state you will not breed, or will not breed before talking to them. If they didn't give you such a contract... well, then the dogs should not be bred anyway. A dog that has been properly cared for, vetted, and has the titles, health clearances, and a family history will not be permitted to breed with whoever an inexperienced person chooses."
dogs,3dvr5z,therobbo91,4,Sun Jul 19 23:08:05 2015 UTC,"the bitch's owner seeks out the stud's owner, not the other way around.   This is what I was afraid of. He hasn't like, been to any dog clubs or anything (if those exist), and it's possible his birth documents were lost in a tornado.  I was 12 when we got him, so I cannot give very clear answers, my apologies. My dad comes from an Ag background and though it's possible his titles have been lost in a tornado, he should have every vet record possible since we got him as a pup."
dogs,3dvr5z,therobbo91,6,Sun Jul 19 23:14:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, then I would try to find his breeder. If he/she is worth anything they would have kept detailed records."

It's complicated, but besides a few nights here and there he has not stayed for an extended time because of college/apartments. Parents are looking for records now!"
dogs,3dvr5z,therobbo91,9,Sun Jul 19 23:35:45 2015 UTC,"Once you find them, you need to look at any health tests you've had done. These are the required tests for Labs. You'll also need any required tests for Poodles done. This isn't just for show dogs, this is 100% required to ensure the puppies are healthy, and the bitch needs to have the same done. You also need to check and make sure that both parents had tests done - some things can be carried from one parent and not be expressed by the dog.   If it seems like a lot and overwhelming... Well, breeding kind of is that way. It's a huge responsibility and undertaking to do properly."

dogs,3dvr5z,barkingfree,7,Sun Jul 19 23:47:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, playing by ear is now people end up with entire litters that have serious problems. Some breeders even do it intentionally. Merle colored dogs are very popular but if a merle is bred to a merle, there is a good chance for white, deaf puppies resulting. Some bad breeders do it anyway and either kill the deaf pups or dump them at a shelter while making their profit.  It is a serious undertaking and I'm glad you want to learn. There are too many poorly bred dogs for anyone to encourage breeding without knowing the dog is in perfect health."

dogs,3dvr5z,LilithSiren,4,Mon Jul 20 00:14:02 2015 UTC,"And the dumbest part of merle/merle breeding is that double merles (lots of white, potentially blind/deaf) are bred to breed, not sell. If you breed a merle to a solid you get about 50% merle and 50% solid puppies. If you breed a merle to a merle, you get 25% solid, 50% merle, and 25% potentially blind and deaf double merles. If you breed one of those double merles to a solid, you get 100% merle though. Merle is pretty, so merle sells.  People suck. The more you learn about dog breeding, the more you'll realize that while there are a ton of people that make these grievous mistakes through pure ignorance, there are other people who do it intentionally without care for the consequences."
dogs,3dvr5z,LilithSiren,14,Mon Jul 20 04:35:38 2015 UTC,"Hey there! I want to say, I really appreciate you trying to listen and take in all the advice. I'm hoping I can help out, even if it's in a different way than you intended.  So, when you talk about sketchy Craigslist breeders, what you're referring to is a Backyard Breeder, or a ""BYB."" These are people that either have a purebred dog they want to make a profit off of, or people that love their dog so much, they want copies of him/her. Unfortunately, you'd fall into the second category if you bred your pup. It's a sad reality that when a bitch gives birth to 8-10 puppies, at least one or two of those dogs is going to end up in a shelter at some point, and a lot of that is thanks to backyard breeding, people who breed casually. Reputable breeders have contracts with people that buy their puppies, stating that if they ever can't keep the dog for any reason, the breeder will take it back, no matter how old the dog is.  About Labradoodles, unfortunately, a lot of people here are biased against them. I hate to say that I'm one of them. Obviously I would never hate an individual dog, like your dog sounds amazing, and if I saw him on the street, you bet your ass I'd run over and pet him! What most people are biased against is the shoddy breeding and profiting off of a dog that is really just a mutt. Dog genetics, like people, are hard to pin down. With an established breed, the dogs have been selectively bred over generations to narrow down qualities and aesthetic traits that are desirable, so the dog's characteristics are pretty much the same.  For example! If I want to buy a border collie puppy, I know that if I go to a reputable breeder, my puppy will have strong herding instincts, and it will have a LOT of energy. It'll be extremely smart, but probably not as biddable or lazy as a lab or a poodle. However, if I buy a labradoodle puppy, there really isn't any good way to narrow down characteristics, because of shoddy breeding down the lines. My dog could end up being super high energy, or super lazy. It could have hip dysplasia or a huge genetic disposition for cancer, and I would have no idea. Basically, it's left up to chance. That's okay, but it's not worth calling a breed, and it's not worth breeding/paying purebred prices for.  You seem like a great person who really loves his dog, you'll fit in really well here. I do hope you decide against breeding him though, as much as you love him, as to not contribute to the vast overpopulation of dogs abandoned and in shelters."
dogs,3dvr5z,LilithSiren,15,Sun Jul 19 23:32:03 2015 UTC,"Let me just give you a hint: Your dog doesn't have any health clearances (nor do his parents most likely) and he has no titles.     Health clearances are not vet check-ups, they are exams that test the dogs hips, elbows, eyes, heath, etc and are graded. Very few pet dogs have gotten health clearances because there is no need because they are not going to be bred. They are done to insure the parents will not be passing any preventable health issues along to the puppies.     Titles are to do with conformation, sport or working achievements. You would know if your dog had titles because a lot of time and effort would have been put into getting the dog their title (for example: agility titles, rally titles, hunting titles, herding titles, etc).   We ask those questions to trip people up because a responsible breeder wouldn't even need to ask."
dogs,3dvr5z,PommeDeSang,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:44:23 2015 UTC,"Then I'm sure he has none of those titles. So basically he could be a 9/10 dog but because he didn't take these exams when he was in his prime he's seen (I'm not taking this personally, just  trying to understand) as an unfavorable dog to breed?"
dogs,3dvr5z,yarr_be_my_password,10,Sun Jul 19 23:54:23 2015 UTC,"Because he never did trials or had health clearances you don't know either way, so it isn't responsible to just hope he has the potential and would have been able to do it. It's like hiring someone for a job with a degree and certifications vs someone just with a recommendation letter from their mom saying they are a good kid with lots o potential put of a stack of 100 resumes. The kid without a degree may have great potential to be an engineer, but they haven't proven they are capable so why would you hire them when there are no shortage of applicants.  Not only do we not have are shortage of dogs, we have a huge surplus. Why add to the surplus unless you know the dog will produce superior offspring, both through its own merit and knowing it's lines inside and out."
dogs,3dvr5z,yarr_be_my_password,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:13:48 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. So, I've already been told these tests are expensive, is that true? And basically he's too old for any serious breeder to consider him as a good stud, correct?"
dogs,3dvr5z,yarr_be_my_password,5,Mon Jul 20 00:28:22 2015 UTC,"The tests are expensive. The x rays of hips need to be done under anesthesia, which isn't cheap. Eye exams are done by specialists and need to be repeated yearly. It adds up.  His age alone doesn't mean he would be ignored, but it would be hard to start training now and sink all the time needed to get those titles and stand out enough that someone would take a risk on an older dog.  There are older dogs used as studs by responsible breeders, but they need to have something special to risk having a small litter or having the pregnancy not take.  Plus, there really aren't going to be many responsible people looking for f1 labradoodle to breed. The few responsible doodle breeders are looking for something very specific, either breeding f1s to get that wiry coat or you have something like the Australian Labradoodle which is many generations in to getting predictable dogs. Generally people producing doodles can't get access to high quality breeding dogs because breeders protect their lines and name and won't sell a poodle that will create doodles."

May be a nice way to enjoy the time you do have with him too. Look at the different types of events and see if anything calls to you.  Therapy dog training isn't necessarily expensive, if a dog likes people it's mostly just getting them used to medical equipment and old and sick people. There are also reading programs where they just need to like kids and be well behaved enough to sit and be read to (you can even train them to look at the book while the kid reads). Then it's just having the time to volunteer, which doesn't need to be weekly."

dogs,3dvr5z,Kaedylee,14,Mon Jul 20 01:00:53 2015 UTC,"Ok you've gotten the basics of why breeding him is a bad idea. Here's the other. No one, but no one who even thinks breeding designer mutts/mixes is a good idea is going to use a senior dog. Least of all an unproven one. Just like in human males, sperm quality goes down once the prime golden days are gone.  And as for ""some skanky doodle off the streets"" technically your dog is one of those. He's too old to have come from any of the handful of breeding programs out there trying to make lab/poodle crosses into a real breed while your family has lucked out as far as temperament and health, that doesn't make him breeding material.  Enjoy your dog's golden years and go buy yourself a puppy and this time go to a proper breeder. No internet ads, no petshops. Want another adorable mutt? Shelter/Rescue.  Also here's the other reason, there is always a chance there will be no next generation. Breeding doesn't always take, puppies die etc."

You may have the best dog in the world, but for all intended purposes he's a mutt. Labradoodles don't exist as a breed yet, if ever. It's a breed that is not being developed by someone with a passion and with a lot of spare income - Something that happened with for example Golden Retrievers. They were developed by a Lord, an actual Lord. Someone with time and money to develop a hunting breed of dogs that took decades.  Labradoodles are developed by backyard breeders such as yourself with no health checks or controls. They are for all effected purposes qualified as mutts. They do not have a breed standard for temperament, not even for coats.  By all means, get a Labradoodle puppy. But do not breed your dog as there's no reason to! There's no warranty his genes will carry on, but you already know that and are dead set on breeding despite what everyone is telling you."

dogs,3dvr5z,kittenpyjamas,5,Tue Jul 21 05:14:37 2015 UTC,"Less quality and more breeding true. By that I mean several generations of doodles bred to other doodles until you have a breed that matches whatever standard that has been developed. IE the coat is consistent. Size, temperament etc.   I won't get into the hows and whys of why the average designer dog breeder is not a proper breeder so I will echo what has already been said, a good breeder would have required your dog to be fixed. Of course most breeders like the one yours most likely came from don't care.   Like I said enjoy your dog for what he is and forget about breeding. If for no other reason than no established kennel is going to want him and that leaves people with about as much knowledge of breeding as you, and trust me on this you DON'T want to be party to that. Too many people think having puppies will be all fun and games and that their bitch will be a GREAT mother. Raising a litter is more work than it is fun for the majority of the time. Factor in general ignorance and well many on here, and myself included have seen far too many forum questions about an emergency situation in the middle of whelping or just after to simply say to anyone else ""Yeah sure, go have fun."""
dogs,3dvr5z,LilithSiren,9,Mon Jul 20 00:29:38 2015 UTC,"Top Five Reasons To Breed Your Dog!  Top Five Reasons NOT to Breed Your Dog!  My 2 cents: enjoy your dog for who he is, and leave it at that. The puppies will probably not be like him, which whatever you think now will probably be a disappointment. Additionally, pet overpopulation is a HUGE problem, especially where you are living in the South. It is incredibly unfair for you to produce a litter of potentially as many as 10 puppies just for you to get one. That's 9 other lives without homes (and potentially sketchy health and behavior) that you are accountable for...then those 9 puppies could go to people who want to breed them for no reason and each make at least 10 more puppies...which is exactly why there are so many dogs in shelters right now. I beg you to reconsider this and get a dog from a responsible breeder or rescue."
dogs,3dvr5z,becomingk,2,Sun Jul 19 23:16:59 2015 UTC,"Point taken, I learned a bit from skimming the articles, a little bit of harsh truths there but I've been around, and owned for a time enough dogs I'd like to think I can look at them semi-objectively. This is what I have a question on though from NOT.   if you own a boy you are not EVER going to be in the position of soliciting mates for him. It is considered to be the ultimate sign of a poor breeder.   Truth bomb! So since I've never gotten a call from a breeder wanting him he should never have pups? I don't think that's what it's saying, but , due to life circumstances, there is little chance that for a good part of his life if someone did try and get ahold of us they would be unlikely to reach the right person."
dogs,3dvr5z,LilithSiren,14,Sun Jul 19 23:32:38 2015 UTC,"So, here's the deal.  Once you get seriously involved in the world of a specific breed, you come to find that it is a very small world.  Many of the reputable breeders of a specific breed know each other, and they all network with each other.  They are all involved in the breed clubs, they meet each other at shows, and they get to know each other's dogs.  It's not like someone will just call you out of the blue saying ""hey, I really want to pair my bitch with your stud"".  When breeding is done right, the process of pairing a bitch and a stud is a long and involved process, requiring a lot of work on the part of both owners.  Hypothetically, let's say I have a bitch that I want to breed.  I have proven that my bitch is worthy of being bred.  She has passed all of her health clearances, she is a champion show dog, and has obtained a working title (agility, herding, hunting, whatever is appropriate for the breed).  This is the kind of dog that should be bred.  So, I start looking for a stud to pair her with.  Where do I start?  I talk to other breeders who are competing at the same shows and trials I am.  I leverage my network of breeders to find out who has potentially appropriate stud dogs.  I stay informed about which dogs are winning which shows and trials, and I talk to their breeders.  Once I have found a dog that I think would be a good match, I talk to that dog's owner, and we have a discussion.  The potential stud's owner can refuse to mate their dog with mine, or they can agree, at which point we would move on to discussing stud fees.  That stud fee may or may not allow the stud's owner to have one of the puppies from the potential litter.  The reason it is the bitch's owner who approaches the stud's owner about a mating is because most of the time, cost, risk, and effort involved in breeding falls on the bitch's owner.  They are the ones who have to deal with a pregnant dog and all of the vet check-ups and potential risks that come with that.  They have to whelp the litter and take care of the newborn puppies (no small feat).  They are the ones who have to find homes for the puppies.  If something goes wrong with the pregnancy or birth, they are the ones who may loose a dog.  So, because of all this, it is usually considered extremely tacky for a stud's owner to initiate the breeding conversation.  It's essentially saying ""hey, wanna put your dog at risk, shell out a lot of money, and have a lot of sleepless nights so my stud can have offspring?""."

I mean...a shitty breeder can still contact you wanting your dog to be a stud for their bitch, but that still doesn't make it suddenly okay if everything else mentioned in those articles isn't taken into consideration. Your dog...just doesn't sound like breeding quality. You have no objective, third party verified proof (see the kind of tests that are needed in the responsible breeder post I linked) that he is physically sound, an excellent representative of his breed, and not a carrier of common diseases/disorders that will be passed down to his pups.   And that's still ignoring the fact that you would be producing an entire litter of pups just for you to get one, which is quite irresponsible. I know it's not the answer you want to hear, and I am sorry about that...I hope you take what everyone here is saying into consideration, even if it is a bitter pill to swallow :/ But we'd be more than happy to help point you in the right direction (be it reputable breeder or rescue) to get another dog in an ethical way..."

dogs,3dvr5z,becomingk,3,Mon Jul 20 00:21:22 2015 UTC,"Okay so this is a helpful answer, but giving me so many more questions too! Health clearences for the dog do you mean? (Like how bull dogs were bread into an unhealthy state, if I'm not mistaken). I was always told Labradoodles were bread for people with allergies, which I always had growing up. He's been healthy as heck his whole life, which is now 11 years."
dogs,3dvr5z,becomingk,12,Sun Jul 19 23:20:20 2015 UTC,"Health clearances depend in the breed. With mixes, you will still want to look at both breeds involved as mixing two does not magically make health issues go away. Breed clubs tend to have recommended tests that should be done. Some are DNA tests, some are exams by a vet, some are x rays reviewed and scored. Unfortunately, a healthy dog may have minor underlying issues or be an asymptomatic carrier of something that won't be seen in a casual exam. The dog itself may also be perfectly healthy, but may have relatives in poor health meaning the lines have issues that you need to be aware of. Responsible breeders don't just know their own dogs, they know the pedigree and match dogs for the best possible health.   Responsible breeders also have specific goals they breed for, like conformation to a standard (dog shows), working (like herding sheep or hunting), doing sports (like agility), or some combination of those. When you are breeding ""just"" for pets, you don't really have any measuring stick to what makes a dog breeding worthy. You want to breed dogs that are going to produce better pups than what is out there sitting in a shelter.  Poodles are generally a better choice than a poodle mix for allergies, when you mix two breeds the results are less predictable and you may not get that hypoallergenic coat that you want. Generally initial crosses will be more wiry haired, but can actually have more difficult to care for coats than a poodle due to the weird waviness instead if the predictable curl. Once you go multiple generations out, you can end up with a high shedding dog because you have let the recessive genes in and it turns into a genetic grab bag.  I people here can be rough, but it'd because we love and know dogs. Breeding is a complicated subject that is a huge mix of science, experience, and ethical dilemmas. We have a huge overpopulation issue, and there are tons of great healthy pet dogs being euthanized. Breeding should be about producing stellar dogs for a purpose, and people defend that ideal often because we have been what happens when breeders don't have high standards. We see sick dogs, dogs with behavioral issues that are not just because of poor training, dogs that don't have issues but ended up with a shitty owner because the breeder didn't evaluate them well or didn't match them with a puppy that suited them well. It's the dogs that suffer when humans fuck up, and it's easier to fuck up than people realize."

dogs,3dvdvk,stormeegedon,3,Sun Jul 19 22:07:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, facts would be nice, but having beein in medical research labs the ethics and standards for husbandry and handling are so strict, not just for the sake of the animal, but for the sake of consistancy of data as well.  I can try and find the USDA and AVMA laws for animal research, but those are just US based and quite extensive.   A dirty, nasty kennel with fearful puppies of poor handling would be hard to raise and handle consistantly."
dogs,3dvdvk,MockingbirdRambler,3,Sun Jul 19 22:50:32 2015 UTC,"I actually work directly with lab animals and am an RLATG, so I'm pretty familiar with the regulations regarding animal use and care in the U.S. From what I understand, the UK has similar, if not stricter guidelines, so I'm not horrifically worried. But this is an excellent time for there to be some positive exposure to the industry as people care much more about dogs than they do mice, rats, or fish, especially with all those stupid videos about beagles being rescued that had never seen the sunlight and lived their lives on cages. I'd be interested in seeing how exactly a breeding facility for research beagles is set up, how often breeding are done, how breedings are selected, etc.   Edit: my phone likes to autocorrect beagles to Beatles what?"
dogs,3dvdvk,stormeegedon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:55:52 2015 UTC,"I think this is the key line:   While nobody likes the idea of dogs being used for medical research, and everybody hopes that alternatives can be found so that dogs no longer need to be used, we should be pragmatic about the situation:  at the moment, medical research and safety testing in the UK requires the use of some dogs.  Surely we should be doing everything we can to make sure that the welfare of the dogs used in UK medical research is as good as it can possibly be?   If people who oppose the use of animals in medical testing would like to propose a viable alternative to using dogs, I'm all ears.  Until then, let's acknowledge that animal testing is an extremely valuable part of some types of research, and we should focus on the well-being of these animals as best as we can without compromising the integrity and progress of medical advancements."
dogs,3dvdvk,Kaedylee,4,Mon Jul 20 00:59:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no. Animal testing in the UK is only for medical/biological research for which animal models are an important part of clinical trials. It's important that animals used in medical research can be regulated in terms of genetics and other factors, this also means people don't have to import dogs for medical testing, which is obviously kinder on the animals. I have seen no evidence that this breeding facility will be inhumane. Present some of that info and I might change my mind."
dogs,3dvdvk,kittenpyjamas,4,Sun Jul 19 22:42:50 2015 UTC,"I think this is ok.  Dogs bred and created for testing are going to be selectively bred to better handle the specific needs for medical testing such as confind space, low energy and less dependent on human contact.   Medical testing is an evil that one day I hope we can eliminate, but until then, producing dogs specifically created for this reason is the best we can do to ensure consistancy of testing and trials as well as what is best for the husbandry of the animals used."

dogs,3dtajj,SleepyPterodactyl,3,Sun Jul 19 23:23:14 2015 UTC,"I think that it's possible to keep both dogs if you are able to keep them completely separated. If they are both crate trained, then that will make things easier. Considering your aussie is 13 and mostly deaf and blind, I'm assuming he spends most of the day sleeping anyway. He probably just wants to be around his human family at this point.   As for if you can train this out of the pit, that would depend on why he's attacking. If he's attacking because of resource guarding, or a social mistake on the aussie's part then training may help. If he's attacking because of dog aggression, then training probably will not solve the problem. If you keep them both, when your aussie passes, do not get a second dog."
dogs,3dtajj,SleepyPterodactyl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:24:25 2015 UTC,"There are 3 other dogs in the house he has been fine with(one lab mix, female, and 2 chihuahuas, males).  I don't know why he has attacked, no one has seen any reason for him to each time, maybe because the shepard is the oldest male.  There wasn't any food around, it could be territorial I suppose.    The shepard has cancer and will likely only live about another year and I want him to be safe but my biggest concern is for younger children such as my sister and her friends that come over. Unfortunately my supermom has decided that ""he is just so sweet; I don't understand why this would happen..."", so they aren't even being separated as of this morning.  I will try and suggest things but I can only do so much if she refuses to do anything about it."
dogs,3dtajj,bigbluebully,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:48:53 2015 UTC,It's possible that he can smell his cancer and that it's setting him on edge. It could also be because he is so old. The only way to keep your old guy safe is to keep them seperated. A less safe alternative would be having the pit wear a basket muzzle whenever he's around the shepherd.   The dogs should definitely be kept seperate when there are children around. It's an accident waiting to happen.
dogs,3dtajj,Geek4Dogs,2,Sun Jul 19 22:15:36 2015 UTC,"To rehome an older dog would be hard. Since he was there first, hes used to the environment ect...It would be wise to figure out why the pit is attacking the dog.If you can figure out the why, then you can figure out the next steps to fix it. Either rehoming or some extensive training. But all of that isn't worth anything if the dog your mother wants to keep isn't trained. And its not fair to the older dog either to have him around, the older dog would have to live in constant fear of being attacked all the time. And possible someone in the house getting bitten trying to break the dogs up. If it were me i'd get rid of the attacking dog."
dogs,3dtajj,bigbluebully,7,Sun Jul 19 20:37:44 2015 UTC,"Either crate and rotate, rehome the Pit Bull or come home to a dead dog. If she continues to let them come in contact the fights will continue and the older dog will get seriously hurt or even killed. Pit bulls love to fight. It's what they were bred for and it excites them. Most will fight other dogs whenever they're given the chance. It's in their genetics and once a Pit Bull has turned hot it's pretty hard, if not impossible, to train that out of them."

dogs,3dtajj,je_taime,11,Sun Jul 19 15:30:45 2015 UTC,"No, it's really not. 200+ years of breeding to create the ultimate dog warriors does not simply just go away. It's in their genetics. Sure, some won't have the eagerness to fight but MANY do."
dogs,3dtajj,Geek4Dogs,-5,Sun Jul 19 15:36:58 2015 UTC,"First, most people can't tell a pit bull from dozens of other breeds which get called pit bulls.  Second, like most breeds, there have always been different lines of pit bulls. While some were bred by the wrong people, some were bred by the right people. They used to have a reputation for being the baby sitting dog. Lumping them all together isn't accurate. When you have extremes like that you can't even take an average and have an accurate view of the world.  You said most will fight whenever given the chance. If that were true we'd have a ridiculous dog fighting problem because they are the most common dogs in America and no one would tolerate them. As it is most people have fine experiences with pit bulls the vast majority of the time. I've got one in my house right now with three cats and four other dogs that he met two days ago. Nothing but a sweet derp. To be sure I'm cautious, because I don't want to trigger anything that hasn't yet been triggered that might be lying dormant, but if you were right we'd have a more than 50% chance of already having multiple dog fights and I'm sure he'd have killed my paralyzed corgi that bosses everyone around.  People making up numbers is obnoxious."

I find this interesting since their good reputation was something I came across when I was obsessed with the Victorian era and was reading Victorian era documents. I'm curious how someone proved a negative here.   Every APBT can be traced back to a fighting dog. Look through any pedigree and you will find a pit dog. You may have to look far back, but they are there.   Again with the almost impossible burden of proof. Go far enough back and every single dog has fighting dog ancestry. I'm not sure what your point is, and I'm not going to take your word that every APBT has a dog fighting dog in it's last several generations. That's such a conveniently unprovable point."

You don't have to take my word for it, take a look at some pedigrees and you can see it for yourself. Here is a wonderful comment I saved a while back because it covers this topic so well.

dogs,3dtajj,overpriced_popcorn,-10,Mon Jul 20 00:19:57 2015 UTC,"This is silly. You think you'll find some Golden Retrievers or Labs being used as fighting dogs? I seriously doubt it.   Not since they became goldens and labs, but funny enough, the wide look of these retrievers comes from old gun dogs being crossed with mastiff-type dogs - before that the gun dogs were basically all lean and long headed like setters and poodles - and the mastiff-types are and were used for fighting for thousands of years. That's what I meant by far enough back.  I'll concede to you that APBT founding stock may all have been fighting dogs, I don't know and I'm not going to look into it right now. And since I'm not going to find the documents I read from the Victorian era about these dogs (don't even know where'd I'd look) you might as well assume I'm full of shit, that's fine.  But the problem is, when people are talking about ""pit bulls,"" they're not just talking about APBTs. Some people think boxers are pit bulls. Most ""pit bulls"" are really crosses of various pit bull-type dogs, small molosser-type dogs is what I'd call them, because most of these dogs aren't bred by pure-bred loving AKC people. They're the most common dogs in the country and they're very popular among the blue collar working class (which is part of why reducing population so they don't inundate shelters is so hard). Most aren't registered with any sort of kennel club and have no real pedigree, and are bred by people who are not part of the more middle and upper class dog breeding world. And this has been going on for more than a century. This makes specificity a problem. When people are talking about ""pit bulls,"" are they talking about registered APBTs that may be provably all from fighting ancestry? Or are they talking about these millions of dogs that make up more of a modern land race than a modern breed, who can have ancestry from all over the world, cane corsos to staffies to American bulldogs? Since most people think of these dogs as ""pit bulls"" is it even fair to say that they shouldn't be called such, that it's ""incorrect""?"

That's how you get a landrace and maintain a landrace. It's not about a closed gene pool but a proven track of fighting dogs.   . If that were true we'd have a ridiculous dog fighting problem because they are the most common dogs in America and no one would tolerate them.    Uh, we do have a ridiculous dog fighting problem.   And it's funny how you mention people not tolerating pits. Sources estimate 2800 pits and their dopplegangers are euthanized daily (over 1 million a year)  Meanwhile, the ASPCA reports 1.2 million dogs are euthanized a year. So over 80% of the dogs euthanized are pits. Not so tolerating, are we?    I've got one in my house right now with three cats and four other dogs that he met two days ago.

dogs,3dtajj,GSpess,2,Sun Jul 19 18:58:33 2015 UTC,"I understand your intentions with this, but keep in mind this is sourced to the AKC when addressing AKC purebred registered breeds and ownership.  A couple points of note, the AKC does not recognize the APBT as a breed, only the AmStaff and Staffordshire Bull Terrier, so the APBT even if statistically present would not likely even be representing on that because of their lack of registry.  Also, going to an earlier point, that's entirely purebreds. Mutts and mix-breed dogs make up a very large portion of dog ownership in the United States. ""Pit Mixes"" (realistically, Bully Breed Mixes) do take up a very sizable portion of this slice of the pie (Mutt/Mixed Breed)."
dogs,3dtajj,serebear,2,Sun Jul 19 21:02:24 2015 UTC,"Nope I get that. So do you have a source that says pit mixes are the most common dogs in America? Not in American shelters, but owned in America? Because I think that that is really hard to track. For example, I have a dog who is a mutt. Now I usually call him a terrier mutt because that's what I see. But ask 10 other people and you'll get 10 other guesses as to what he is. And where ""pit mixes"" are easily misidentified in the first place, I think it would be really hard to get a good read on a stat like this."
dogs,3dtajj,GSpess,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:32:04 2015 UTC,"Sorry, to clarify, I wasn't offering any claims that they were the most common dogs in America (by ownership), but that this chart didn't include mutts/mixes, and was narrowly the AKC registered ownership so harder to paint a larger picture with. But that Mutts and Mixes do take up a significant portion of actual ownership and of that and that ""Pit"" Mixes (bully mixes) would represent a strong portion of the mixed/mutt sample as well.   To also add further clarification, I noted   ""Pit Mixes"" (realistically, Bully Breed Mixes)   for the exact reason that Pits are terribly identified and even going off of APBT, AmStaff, Staffy genetics as establishing what is and isn't a Pit, most of the time it's Bully breeds (with no pit) being labeled as Pit (often Boxer and Bulldogs). A frustrating and obnoxious reality, as many people don't see the difference, or harm, and even ""experts"" tend to get identification wrong without the presence of genetic testing and markers.   Edit:  According to this 53% of all dogs owned are Mixed Breeds.."
dogs,3dtajj,Geek4Dogs,2,Sun Jul 19 21:55:58 2015 UTC,"If your mother is dead set on keeping the pit you seriously need to get a trainer/behaviorist involved as well as never letting the two dogs come in contact with eachother. The crate and rotate option is a good solution for the time being, but the best thing you could do in my opinion is get the pit rehomed to a place with no other animals. Remember it is easier to rehome a dog that is younger and not quite set in its ways. The older the dog gets the harder it will be to find him a new home"
dogs,3dtajj,Azara1th,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:42:42 2015 UTC,"I lost my post, but a few things I'll recap.  Keep them separated. Management is key. Additionally dog aggression does not equal human aggression. Pits actually tend to favor much more towards extremely human friendly. Don't bother wasting any worry that the dog will become human aggressive. Keep in mind that Pits do LOVE to play rough. Don't take this as aggression either. Understand what is play and what is aggression.  Now have you established the origins of the fight? Lets be fair here and partial to circumstances. Pits do have a tendency to be dog aggressive, but that doesn't mean this was because of that. As dogs get older they tend to become more reactive, a lot of times due to pain. Could the pit have been trying to play with him and the older dog snapped and things escalated? Absolutely! Maybe it's even something as ""simple"" as resource guarding. These are the determining factors which really need to be understood and addressed, as they are key in management. This also is key in if this can be fixed by training/behaviorist.   Also what kind of exercise and stimulation is the Pit mix receiving? How often? For how long? Pits can tend to be be very energetic and this is something often overlooked. If your pup isn't getting enough exercise or stimulation you can work towards offering a better more invigorating exercise regime and see improvements even just off of that. Your first paragraph has me wondering if he's under exercised/stimulated.  Crate train both dogs (if they are not) and don't leave them unattended together, ever. You can rotate which dog gets to stay crated while you all are out, or you can just keep them both crated, or keep one as the designated free-roamer, but that's key. Set up nice management.  Don't just outright assume that the Pit is being aggressive. Some are labeling him as the aggressor, but that might not entirely be true. I'll be certain to take some shit for this, but for fucks sake, paint a fair picture.   Older dogs do have a tendency to be ""cranky"" and become reactive. The Pit trying to initiate play could have bumped the elder shepherd the wrong way and caused pain, the elder dog could have snarled, snapped, and then things escalated from there. This is by no means uncommon. This happens all the time as a matter of fact. As dogs get older them become more selective and more reactive.   My parent's have a dog who will react like this as well. If you were not looking you'd be quick to assume that my Pit was the aggressor, but he is not. Their dog is 8 yrs old (a recent rescue) and arthritic. If you try and push his shoulders/pull his neck he'll snarl and react out of pain. This isn't him being mean he's a sweet dog, but that HURTS him. If my dog as much as bumps into him, he will turn, snarl and snap. It's over as quick as it started (as my dog doesn't take this as a fight/play), but other dogs can become defensive and react as such. This can very likely be the case withy our dog. The Pit being young, healthy and energetic pushed the wrong button not he older more reactive and pained shepherd. Once the shepherd reacted poorly, the pit stood up for himself. Is it ideal? No. But that's why you need to manage the dog and understand the circumstances.  With my parent's dog we very strongly establish that the older dog is NO up for play OR cuddles. My dog is to be entirely cordial with him, and they get along fine, sleeping on adjoined beds. They share the same food fine and everything is great so long my dog doesn't jump on him, paw him, or bump into him. It might sound stupid but it's an understanding of circumstances, really."

The dog will learn that crying doesn't bring you downstairs, and that you'll always come back.

I had the misfortune of having to leave my puppy (at the time about the same age) for a few weeks when I went abroad, and I really regret it. Of course, we were able to ""make up for lost time,"" but in general I would vote for this over boarding for a whole week."

From what I know about boarding though, many dogs have high anxiety the whole time they're there because another dog/s is always on edge/barking/whining and the other dogs just pick that up and it's a vicious cycle.

She couldn't do any physical excursion for months, couldn't eat much, and was very thin when my sister took her home.   But she survived, and she's literally doubled in weight. She and my dog are best buds, and she is quite a bruiser. I mean literally. Yesterday I was running around the yard with her and she accidentally ran into me and I now have a big bruise on my leg from her big hard head.   She's definitely a heart worm treatment success story.

dogs,3dsehu,Dysalexia,2,Sun Jul 19 04:01:14 2015 UTC,"My pup, Bear, just recently (mid June were his last two shots, last week he got his blood drawn to see if there were any baby HWs left, in 6 mo going to check if all the adults died off) finished up his treatment. And he did really well!  The injections made my dog pretty lethargic for a day, and the steroids made him pant excessively, but he took it really well. Bear is an aussie/border collie mix (according to shelter), so when they told me to restrict exercise I was pretty worried because I know he's a big baby, and would work himself up more trying to get out of his crate than just letting him jump on and off the bed so he could be comfortable.  I don't know if it was because they thought he didn't have too many adult worms, or because I just didn't want to stress him out more, but I pretty much let him do whatever he wanted (toss his toys across the floor, puzzle toys, sleep), as long as he wasn't over-exerting himself. I took him on short walks to the mailbox or dumpster, just so he wasn't cooped up all day, and just tried to avoid other dogs and people to keep him from getting too excited.  He's still his crazy self, and not at all different. I won't know about all the adult worms being completely dead until later, but I'm hopeful (here's to hoping fireworks this month didn't cause any issues with his heart, hah)!  Do what you feel is best for your dog (in terms of how much exercise to restrict if your pup absolutely refuses to keep calm indoors). I really wish you and your pup the best! :)  Sorry about all the text!"
dogs,3dsehu,nocturnalnurse,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:13:17 2015 UTC,"He's so cute! I love the name Bear. I think restricting my dog's exercise is going to be the worst part. He is so active and right now basically demands hour long runs at the park to get his energy out. If it starts getting dark and we haven't taken him, he'll go stand by the door and howl. So other than worrying about the treatments being successful, I think keeping him calm is my biggest concern as of now. I hope all of Bear's test come back free and clear!"
dogs,3dsehu,nocturnalnurse,2,Sun Jul 19 04:04:58 2015 UTC,"Hey! We adopted a heartworm positive dog last July and he's currently chewing on a bone quite happily. Heartworm treatment is 100%, but you do have to make sure to adhere to the guidelines (ie no exercise) or you could put your dog at risk for a stroke, especially if it's a smaller dog.   When we adopted our big boy, we treated him for stage 3 heartworms, and after the initial treatment, we thought we were in the clear for health issues- except for his enlarged heart. 6 months after his first negative, we are dealing with heart and kidney failure, so he's on a variety of meds twice a day and has special kidney food.   Despite the meds and the cardiac troubles from having (likely) YEARS of untreated heartworms, he is very happy. He loves fetch and short walks. Peanut butter treats are his favorite and head scratches still reign supreme. He sheds ALL over my house and drives me nuts by chasing lights on the wall whenever people drive past. He's still my best friend. He's still happy and cuddly. Treating him for heartworms made him much more comfortable. Before the treatment, he was our grumpy old man- now he'll play fetch and run with the other dogs.   Tldr; Treatment > no treatment. Heartworms suck and your dog will be much happier when they're gone.   Talk to your vet when the info has had more time to sink in and feel free to PM me if you have any questions!"
dogs,3dsehu,GSpess,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:23:52 2015 UTC,"I'm glad your guy is getting better!! I already have a list of questions for my vet tomorrow haha. This happens every time I go to the vet and get bad news, but it's like the vet talks and then I'm just ""Ok well that's that. Let's go home!"" And then once I get home I start thinking of a billion questions. So I'll call him in the morning. Thank you!"
dogs,3dsehu,Leafy33,2,Sun Jul 19 15:54:12 2015 UTC,"I still do that when I talk to my vet! You're going to build a good relationship wwithyour vet through this process, so don't be afraid to call and ask him/her questions ! They would rather you be informed .:)"
dogs,3dsehu,Leafy33,2,Sun Jul 19 18:40:26 2015 UTC,"I'll give you an entirely anecdotal story.  In april I took in an EXTREMELY Heartworm positive dog. In fact, on his vet examination papers once they rescued him it said exactly that ""Heartworm - Positive [ √]"" with ""EXTREME"" handwritten next to it. It was so bad his Heartworm treatment had to be split up. He had received four total rounds of shots. The vet had never seen a Heartworm case in her 40 years of practicing that bad, never seeing the protein(?) levels that high. Keep in mind we live in the deep south in the lowlands, so we've got PLENTY of Heartworm cases here, it's borderline standard practice.  This poor baby has had every injustice done against him. He was a bait dog, he was tied up outside and neglected, his ears were home cropped down to a nub. He had every reason to hate humans for all of these terrible things done again him, yet he is the biggest love-bug. He's seriously fucking adorable.  Anyways. We just finished his final round of shots. It was bad. I've never heard an animal cry and whine like that. I got into the car, and as a 27 year old dude I broke down into tears. He got home and cried in pain for hours. I didn't know how long he'd be like that, but honestly a day or two later he was back to his spritely self. This was a problem in and of it's own because all he wants to do is frolic around and play! Now it's like nothing ever happened.   He's now two almost three weeks past his final shot and hopefully he can begin to receive some attention and exercise. I got the go-ahead to let him run for a short couple of minutes and you should see him.  He's just so happy to be alive, and for all intents and purposes,  he should't be had he not been found tied to that tree. A couple of weeks after I got him we took him to go get ice cream, he got a doggy sundae. He started treatment shortly after that and hasn't had a chance to go get it soon, but it  I don't really know where I'm going with this, but I can answer more questions if you have? Or what have you. Just know that things will get better and he's so lucky to have you! You're great for picking him up and now he has a home and family to love him for the rest of his days!  Here he is with my pup just last night!"
dogs,3dsl7s,sr330,6,Sun Jul 19 01:31:52 2015 UTC,20-30minutes is not enought for a dog with the exception of some toy breeds. Consider getting a cat and a alarm system.
dogs,3dsl7s,unclear_outcome,3,Sun Jul 19 01:52:59 2015 UTC,"Even most of the toy breeds wouldn't be thrilled. OP would have to go out of his way to get a very lazy adult or a dog over 10 that didn't have any energy anymore.  And none of those breeds are particularly good watchdogs, especially not when they're so low-energy. I know my dog cannot generally be bothered to bark at intruders because he's toooooo lazy."
dogs,3dsl7s,goldfish_king,3,Sun Jul 19 01:55:31 2015 UTC,"I mean a geriatric pug is probably happy with 20-30minutes. My family's 14yr old lab can only handle 10minutes of walking but then again, she's 14 and her hips have gone to shit but she can still do an hour of swimming."
dogs,3dsl7s,unclear_outcome,2,Sun Jul 19 02:00:11 2015 UTC,we have 2 pugs(3 yrs old and a puppy 13 weeks) and a dachshund mix(11 yrs old). they get down right offended if we only walk them 20-30 min lol. They look at us like What the hell?! thats all we get?! whats the matter with you! lol.
dogs,3dsl7s,unclear_outcome,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:10:55 2015 UTC,Hence geriatric pugs. I've met a few very energetic pugs who would be completely miserable with anything less than 45minutes of vigorous exercise.
dogs,3dsl7s,Danibelle903,2,Sun Jul 19 03:43:48 2015 UTC,"I have a 9 pound chihuahua mix and she really only likes to exercise for 30 minutes at a time, but she's walked three times a day at a leisurely pace and we play throughout the day as well. Overall, on a day when we really tucker her out, we exercise her for about 2.5-3 hours total, not counting training to engage her brain. What's nice about a toy breed is that they get tired a bit faster than a larger working dog, so you get to rest between activities as well."
dogs,3dsl7s,unclear_outcome,2,Sun Jul 19 04:48:30 2015 UTC,Let's say that the answer to that question goes up to 1 hour per day. Would your response change?
dogs,3dsl7s,scarletsalander,2,Sun Jul 19 01:55:03 2015 UTC,"Obviously my answer would change because an hour a day is a reasonable amount of exercise for a dog, the question is are you willing to provide an hour of exercise every day for the rest of that dogs life?"
dogs,3dsl7s,scarletsalander,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:57:26 2015 UTC,"Between my wife and I, we would -- does it have to be a contiguous 1 hour? What about something like 30 minutes in the morning, 30 minutes at night?"
dogs,3dsl7s,unclear_outcome,5,Sun Jul 19 01:58:48 2015 UTC,"I am totally just curious and do not mean this judgmentally at all, so please know my tone is not intended to be harsh or critical here:  Why do you want a dog if you didn't initially see yourself spending more than 20-30 minutes exercising it per day?  What kind of daily interaction do you envision as being typical or adequate for a dog?  Again, NOT intended to be judgmental at all!  Just curious what your personal motivating factors for pet ownership are and what you think having a dog will be like."
dogs,3dsl7s,unclear_outcome,4,Sun Jul 19 03:09:22 2015 UTC,"Well, we're first-timers so we don't have firsthand experience owning a dog, so we're not as familiar with the exercise requirements other than other people's experiences. Some of our friends never exercise their dogs, and some of them exercise their dogs for 3 or 4 hours a day. So that's why we're trying to get a broader range of people's experiences and expertise here on the sub.  Personal motivating factors for pet ownership, I mentioned in the OP - want a watchdog but also an extra member of the family... hope this answered your q, but let me know if you want more info."
dogs,3dsl7s,je_taime,5,Sun Jul 19 04:40:07 2015 UTC,"No this definitely helps!  Thanks.  I think you are going to find that the ""extra member of the family"" part ends up being a much bigger aspect of pet ownership than the watchdog part.  I know dogs can be trained successfully to be watchdogs, but they are so social naturally that I hear more failed stories about that (with smiles on the owners faces as they laugh at how friendly the animal turned out to be) than successes.  I am NOT experienced with that myself though, so if someone with more knowledge/experience wants to chime in, that might be better.  Your friends who don't ever exercise their dogs--do they complain about behavioral issues?  Are their dogs older?    It is exceedingly rare that you can just not exercise a dog (unless there is a medical issue at play or the dog is so old it can't handle it anymore) and not expect to see behavioral issues arise as a result.  Many people will complain endlessly that their dogs chew objects, whine too much, fight, etc. without ever connecting it to a lack of exercise, which is often the root cause of the problem.  In my personal opinion, I do think it depends on the individual dog, but that at least an hour a day for an adolescent/adult dog is a good starting point.  But banking on more might be a good idea in case your pet ends up being a bit more energetic or younger or whatever.  Basically, the more you exercise the dog, the happier you will ALL be.    I commented somewhere else in this thread too to just speak about non-exercise interactions with your dog being a big part of your day too.  So I'm sure you saw that, too.  Do you see yourself enjoying things like daily walks with the animal?  My 60-75min daily walk with my dog is my prized zen time and I get very grumpy myself if I can't do it.  I love playing with her and if she were younger/the weather were nicer lately, I'd be taking her hiking a lot more for my own enjoyment in addition to her benefit.  I guess I wondered if you saw exercising the dog as being a chore or something you could actually integrate into your life as an enjoyable hobby.  I think you might be a lot happier if you can find a way to do the latter."
dogs,3dsl7s,je_taime,2,Sun Jul 19 04:51:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that sounds about right. Add in some off-leash fetch at the park (think 10minute walk and 20minutes of high intensity fetch twice a day - buy a chuckit) and I'd say you are a great canidet for an adult labs."
dogs,3dsl7s,goldfish_king,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:04:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for the recommendation. Can you share how you arrived at labs? Anything in particular that makes you think that would be a good fit?
dogs,3dsl7s,goldfish_king,5,Sun Jul 19 02:06:48 2015 UTC,"Typically they are a family friendly, easy to train, moderate/high energy breed that have a low maintance coat. Most will bark a strange noises but won't be overly protective. A weekly obedience class and training at home, plus the two walks/fetch per day should keep them happy. However they do need their exercise and training or they will become destructive.     They are pretty common in shelters to and there are a number of Labrador specific rescues. Also, look at getting an adult who's low energy, already has some training and throughly temperament tested by the rescue.   Edit:   A quick search found Golden Gate Labradore Retreiver Rescue   http://www.labrescue.org/adopt.html  Edit edit:  I think I prefer Montery Bay Retriver rescue because it looks like they do a more thorough placement check   http://www.mbaylabrescue.org"
dogs,3dsl7s,scarletsalander,2,Sun Jul 19 03:23:59 2015 UTC,"OK, 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the evening, and can you do this with a growing human family to juggle? Because your dog will not stop having needs when your babies come."
dogs,3dsl7s,scarletsalander,2,Sun Jul 19 02:48:14 2015 UTC,Yes. My wife doesn't work a day job. Can you recommend any breeds?
dogs,3dsl7s,dmarrok,3,Sun Jul 19 03:02:45 2015 UTC,"Did you talk to her about it? Because maybe she won't want to deal with babies, a baby and toddler, and a dog."
dogs,3dt33i,justanotherburner,9,Sun Jul 19 04:44:29 2015 UTC,"You may have a couple days (or even weeks) of ""what the hell was I thinking?"" after you bring home your dog.  Some people on this sub have likened it to postpartum depression.  You were so excited, you got this wonderful animal, and you just feel terrible. If it happens, give yourself some time and space."

dogs,3dt33i,becomingk,4,Sun Jul 19 16:32:45 2015 UTC,"First, congrats! I hope you and your girlfriend find an awesome dog.  I guess I count as a bit of a veteran. My pup has been home for about a month, so all this stuff is pretty fresh in my mind. A lot of this is a bit of a repeat of the link you shared, but I'll go ahead anyway :)   Before going to pick him up, we dog-proofed pretty thoroughly (put all of our shoes in a sealable container, got everything we loved out of reach), laid down the ground rules (can the dog go on the couch? bed?), and doled out responsibilities (who gets up in the morning to walk him, etc). We didn't buy much in the way of supplies since we weren't sure which dog we would choose and wanted to be able to pick out a bed that fit right and toys that he would want to play with.  The day we brought him home, we let him sniff around and pee outside before bringing him in. He was pretty shut down from being in the kennel and flopped down on the floor and slept for a week. No kidding, I was all prepared for all the exercise I was going to get now that we had a dog and... nope! Well, at least not right away.  We did our best to give him space that first week. Didn't approach him, let him hide/sleep underneath chairs and generally be on his own. He'd still come to us for pets, but it wasn't until week 2/3 that he would wake me up with his huge doggy eyes and whimper for me to get up and keep him company.  We had a pretty good sense of how likely he was to go nuts and destroy things [not at ALL likely] before leaving him alone. Try going out for an hour or two to run errands, see how he/she does. I downloaded an app that uses my laptop webcam to stream video to my phone. Sort of like a nanny cam. Anyway, I wound up not using it and I'm fairly certain he just sleeps while I'm out."
dogs,3dt33i,becomingk,3,Sun Jul 19 05:06:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice! I think my first instinct would not have been to give so much space, and I would have been worried.  We'll be dog-proofing a lot, but I also don't know what kind of dog I'll end up with so it's good to know it's okay to buy some stuff after."
dogs,3dt33i,ohgosh_thejosh,4,Sun Jul 19 05:28:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was hard not to snuggle him all the time that first week but I think letting him come to us was the best way to earn his trust.  Oh yeah, we were at Petsmart three times that week. My one tip there is to leave him at home when you go. Charlie got overstimulated on Petsmart trip #2 and I found myself cleaning up the largest pile of dog vomit I've ever seen."
dogs,3dt33i,becomingk,2,Sun Jul 19 05:33:39 2015 UTC,I downloaded an app that uses my laptop webcam to stream video to my phone   What app is this?
dogs,3dt33i,ohgosh_thejosh,2,Mon Jul 20 03:53:48 2015 UTC,"It's called CamCam. It'll stream within your home for free, but you have to pay a small fee for it to stream outside of your wireless network (like $1.99 a month or something).   Can't comment on quality so YMMV!"

dogs,3dt33i,punstersquared,4,Mon Jul 20 04:18:59 2015 UTC,"We adopted a few weeks ago. We didn't buy any items beforehand because we weren't sure what dog we would get. We bought some essential supplies at the pet store by the shelter, including a crate. We set up the crate and put the blanket we brought her home with in the crate so she could have a familiar smell.   For the first few days she rarely wanted to come out of her crate. That was her safe spot. We let her have her space. We didn't push her to engage with us. When she approached us after three days, it was the most amazing feeling. Another day after that and she started following me around everywhere I go.   Here's my advice:   Give your dog space.   Stick to a walk and meals schedule.   Let her come to you.   Once you get her home, call your local vet. Make an appointment for a check up to meet the vet and establish a relationship. Bring any medical papers the shelter gave you so the vet can have them copied into her file.   Don't be offended if he wants to be alone when you first get him home.   Buy a few toys in different styles. When he starts playing, take note of which kind he prefers.   Dogs acclimate quickly. Before you know it, your dog will know the routine, have a favorite spot, wag her tail when she sees you, and her personality will start to come out. You probably won't know what she's like for a week or two.   There are a few subreddits about dogs. Check them all out. Most people I've seen have been incredibly helpful.   Have fun and take pictures!"
dogs,3dt33i,Blutarg,2,Sun Jul 19 05:23:03 2015 UTC,"I'm glad two people in a row said to give the dog space, drives the point home! I read somewhere that it's good to have a crate even if you don't want to confine the dog in there; I will definitely consider that.  Thanks for the advice!"
dogs,3dsehn,bruzabrocka,6,Sun Jul 19 00:24:05 2015 UTC,"When you think of intelligence in a dog, what does that look like?  Have you considered a whippet? I don't think I'd go with a shiba as an inexperienced dog owner, they're pretty difficult. My hesitation with italian greyhounds is that they are legendarily difficult to house train -- many are never successfully housetrained and just pee in the house forever, which would be a dealbreaker for me and I think a lot of other people.  Whippets are bigger than italian greyhounds but smaller than regular greyhounds, and are actually house trainable."
dogs,3dsehn,goldfish_king,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:48:11 2015 UTC,"My only hesitation with a whippet or other sighthound is the fact that the OP has no option for the dog to run off leash. While these dogs are low energy they do the occasional oppertunity to run full speed even if it's only once a week. Otherwise, I think a whippet (or maybe a silken windhound - because pretty) would be a near perfect fit."
dogs,3dsehn,unclear_outcome,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:17:39 2015 UTC,Yeah... I am seriously considering a silken windhound for my next dog and the only reason it could work is that I'm about a mile down the road from a really fabulous dog park where it could run off leash and we could go a couple times a week.

dogs,3dsehn,chicken_pot,3,Sun Jul 19 01:39:25 2015 UTC,I think you're looking more for a biddable dog than a really intelligent one. Shibas are really difficult to train because they like to second guess everything you tell them.

Not droolers either. Your lack of experience owning and training dogs does make me hesitate because it can take a little while for greyhounds to adapt to living in a house as a pet. They're not miserable to live with in that time, but it is an adjustment period."
dogs,3dsehn,Hermago,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:36:53 2015 UTC,"While they do seem adorable, affectionate, and quiet.. the video I watched about them said very much the same as you. Not the best dog for a first time dog owner. I will definitely keep it on my list of considerations though! Thanks."
dogs,3dsehn,goldfish_king,2,Sun Jul 19 01:02:18 2015 UTC,"A rescue may have a dog in foster who would be a good fit for you (already past the ""pet adjustment period"") if you like them otherwise.

dogs,3dsehn,aperfectly_cromulent,2,Sun Jul 19 02:51:51 2015 UTC,"The issue with retired greyhounds is their transition from community race dog to house pet. Having confident handlers makes the transition easier for the dog, that's all. Of course, adoption groups adopt out greyhounds to first-time dog owners. They have the support group for it, somewhere to turn to although some groups are way better than others."

Yeah they think with their tummies lol.  Our pugs love to go on walks. They are little shadows so we have them off leash.They don't bark much per say... its more of a yodle kinda bark. Ours barks when someone comes to the door, but they are not aggressive in the least. Only thing is, they don't do heat well. They gotta be kept indoors but ours LOVES winter lol. They are not a breed for everyone. They are hilarious! But they can be stubborn. So that being said, treats are your friend lol. They don't require special grooming. But they do shed. And they snore... and they will fart.. then look at you like ""what?"" ..lol. but like i said you gotta love them. We have had many breeds of dogs over the years, and pugs are our favorite lol.

dogs,3dsehn,goldfish_king,5,Sun Jul 19 00:50:06 2015 UTC,"A lot of people like to walk or hike with their dog off-leash or go to off-leash areas that aren't fully fenced, and some breeds are notoriously bad at that due to prey drive (sighthounds) or being independent buttheads (a lot of spitz breeds). You can't, for instance, let a greyhound off leash in an area that isn't securely fenced and expect to get it back, uh, ever."

An under-exercised and bored dog will escape because, hey, they're bored! A dog with a very high prey-drive could see something perceived as prey and go after it. I'm going with boredom, it's more common and a yard is no excuse for not exercising a dog.    Also, stop letting your dog escape. Even if he's returning it's dangrous for him to be unsupervised in an uncontrolled environment. Either talet him back to your appartment, have your mother crate him whenever she cannot be supervising him or make the fence more secure.     Recall (coming when called) is a training issue. Dogs don't naturally recall they need to be trained to do it."
dogs,3dscx4,unclear_outcome,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:39:45 2015 UTC,"Like I said, he'll be here the end of  extremely month when I'm out of this apartment. I'll see if my mom is more up for exercising him some (could do them both some good).   And I understand I concept of recall, I was asking how I can train him better in it when I do get him back."
dogs,3dscx4,unclear_outcome,2,Sun Jul 19 03:08:43 2015 UTC,Find a group training class and attend it. There are a lot of YouTube videos but I think in-person training classes have better results.

dogs,3dscx4,Maddsie,2,Sun Jul 19 03:33:59 2015 UTC,"And what would cause him to run in the first place?   Boredom and lack of exercise, probably.

dogs,3dscx4,Hermago,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:10:12 2015 UTC,"First things first. Make sure the yard is secure, especially if you're gonna leave him in it unsupervised. He's probably escaping because he's bored and underexercised. There are plenty of good videos on youtube for teaching recalls. Check out kikipup. But a good recall is not an excuse to have an unsecure yard."
dogs,3dscx4,EranVonBaron,-6,Sun Jul 19 22:51:02 2015 UTC,"Simply punish for wrong actions, reward for correct actions. The dog will learn when it doesn't leave your yard it gets a treat. When it does, it doesn't get a treat. Works the same with any action : teach it not to poop in the house or teach it a trick. Good luck  Oh and Id assume he's running away because of his curiosity : the smells and sights of something new, maybe he hears another dog, you never know."
dogs,3dscx4,SharpStiletto,5,Sun Jul 19 00:19:47 2015 UTC,"Wow. That's awful advice. If you punish a dog it will just learn to associate you with negative experiences, plus a dog is not going to associate staying-in-yard=treat, they're not that complex. More exercise, a more secure yard and regular training are what this dog needs not punishment."
dogs,3dtczw,eagertoroam,4,Sun Jul 19 07:00:19 2015 UTC,"Find a border collie rescue in your region. Being severely under exercised is not helping his behavior issues and likely contributing to the problem. If you cannot afford necessary care and you do not have the time to work with him, things will only get worse. His behavior is likely still at a redeemable level, but may not continue to be if he continue to practice aggressive behaviors.   What is the medical condition you are treating?"
dogs,3dtczw,tokisushi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:18:12 2015 UTC,Im sorry to gear that you are in this situation :(  I would look into rescue organizations If you do not want to put him into a shelter. It seems he will need a lot of rehabilitation work and unfortunately your home is no longer a suitable place for him. There are a lot of rescue organizations/ foster families who are willing to put in the tough work to rehabilitate dogs and find them good families even with medical issues. Hopefully you could find one in your area. Unfortunately with this agressive behaviour it is highly unlikely a shelter would even put him up for adoption.
dogs,3dtczw,serebear,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:32:48 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of good points being made about this situation being far from ideal for everybody involved. I get that. But I'm inclined to think euthanasia is a very permanent solution to what is hopefully not a permanent situation. How much more school do you have left?  Do you think your life will settle down after this semester is over? It might be worth living with some pretty major problems for a while if the end is in sight, it might not.   I'm concerned that he keeps you from having people over, and apparently has since before the current schedule/medication problems. I was going to suggest finding someone to walk him, or even just come play tug with him for half an hour or whatever, but I see how that could be difficult in light of his aggression.  It might also be difficult financially, but I can honestly say that when I was in college I would have actually paid for the chance to walk a dog because I missed mine so much. So if you're sure it can be done safely, you might be able to find someone willing to do it at a reasonable rate.   I wish you luck. This sounds like a horrible, hard situation and I wish I had more help to offer."
dogs,3dtczw,omega_kona,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:33:44 2015 UTC,"Is your husband able to help exercise and work on training with him? Can you afford at least one or two sessions with a behaviorist so your husband has an idea of how to properly handle and work on the issue?  If not then you're not a good home for this dog anymore. You don't have any clue how to handle his aggression nor have you given serious attempts to through training with a professional (not that I'm seeing anyways), you cannot give him any exercise or mental stimulation which is a huge need for any dog but even more so for a border collie, you cannot afford the medication and bloodwork he has to have for his quality of life. If it's a medical condition it's very likely he's in pain because you've been unable to afford his medication.  He's reached a point where he's aggressive with everything. You said he's even snapped at you. At cats, dogs, strangers, and men. You can't keep an aggressive dog, you stated so yourself, and you don't have the time or money to help work on his aggression. Keeping him simply isn't an option and its not terribly fair to the dog either.  It's not going to be easy to find him a home. Especially with his fear of men, aggression towards everything, and his medical conditions. You could get in touch with a collie rescue, but I don't know if breed specific rescues take mixes since I'm a first time dog owner and have never dealt with a rescue, you could check with them anyways. Be very specific about his issues. Don't sugar coat it or hide anything. If they're going to take this dog they should know what they're getting into.  I feel like shelters aren't an option because he'd be surrounded by everything he's afraid of. Men, strangers, and other dogs. I think he'd be put down fairly quickly.  Which brings me to the last option. If you can't find anybody to take him and you can't give him the care he needs then euthanasia might be the best option. He's afraid of everything, aggressive, most likely in pain, and horribly under exercised. His quality of life is no where near ideal. In fact it's pretty close to the opposite. It's not an option you're going to like, I'm sure, but it is definitely a viable one.  Do what's best for the dog. You took on the responsibility of doing so when you got him.  Good luck."

dogs,3dt717,wwhyshrekispiss,8,Sun Jul 19 05:33:55 2015 UTC,Getting a dog out of a shelter you more than likely will be looking at a lot of mixed breeds. I've seen some beautiful dogs that come out of shelters that would fit your criteria. With the older dogs they will likely know more about the dogs temperament and behavior around other pets. Take your time to find the right one for you. It's really easy to fall in love with the first one you meet.
dogs,3dt717,settersrclowns,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:13:23 2015 UTC,Thanks!
dogs,3dt717,Synaxis,6,Sun Jul 19 06:23:44 2015 UTC,"Labs and lab mixes are plentiful in rescues, luckily for you. You'll want to find one that's already been cat tested. If you're gone up to 10 hours a day I would definitely suggest looking into that dog walker for a break in the middle of the day. While most adult dogs can hold it for a full work day, 10 hours is pushing it and a break in the middle of the day to relieve themselves and get some social interaction would be hugely beneficial to the dog. A puppy would definitely not be able to handle that sort of schedule so you'll find a better fit in an adult dog.   Did you budget for your new dog? No, but because I'm going shelter route and will not get the dog until after getting a salary increase, I can't imagine budget would be an issue   Keep this in mind because budget is important, especially in dogs with unknown pedigree. If you adopt a 18 month old lab puppy and 6 months later you realize the dog is getting abnormally stiff and bring it to the vet for X-rays to find out it has severe hip dysplasia and arthritis that's only going to get worse, you could potentially be looking at an $8,000+ hip replacement or euthanasia. If the dog ingests something it shouldn't have or breaks a leg or tears a ligament you're easily looking at $2,000+ for vet bills. Insurance mitigates this but be careful, as with other types of insurance, some pet insurance companies are super sketchy.  You could also wind up with behavioral or training issues that require professional help. This is also not cheap.  A shelter dog or rescue will be cheaper up front than a dog from a thorough, ethical breeder, but the long-term costs are likely to be higher instead. Just keep this in mind and make sure you have something saved up for emergencies.   if I could get a wolf pup from a shelter that was relaxed, non-dangerous to people or our two cats, and didn't require tons of obedience training, that would probably be my ideal dog.   You're not alone, unfortunately the wolflike breeds are some of the toughest! Definitely not beginner friendly, for the most part."
dogs,3dt717,Synaxis,3,Sun Jul 19 05:49:13 2015 UTC,"Super helpful response, thank you!   I hadn't thought about how a breeder dog would be cheaper in the long run but that makes perfect sense. My girlfriend and I have two cats, one of which was a stray and another which was a little kitten in a quarantine room in a shelter. They both turned out healthy and happy,  and I like to think that we saved their lives. I'd hate to think I'd missed an opportunity to do the same with a dog, so I'm pretty set on shelters.   What do you think the youngest lab we could get would be, within reason--the last thing I want is to cause distress to a puppy. Theoretically the dog could be walked by me at ~7:00, a dog service at ~noon, and my girlfriend at ~4:30. And that it would, at least at first, have to be crated while we were gone."

Also, does your dog lay outside on the ground a lot? May have laid on an ant hill (fire ants or regular ants) and he got eaten up?

He doesn't have any sores from the scratching or otherwise. He's actually not on any flea medication but I know it's not fleas because they're very easy to spot with his coat.

dogs,3dqexw,danaofdoom,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:30:37 2015 UTC,"Have you tried giving him the benadryl with a bit of peanut butter? It works every time for my dog. Try having him eat before giving it to him to help with the nausea.   It might just be a pollen allergy. Do you notice him itching more at certain times? I notice my dog scratches and licks herself a lot after playing in the grass. I'm also allergic to pollen, and we both seem to have allergy symptoms at the same times. I try to wipe her feet off after we've been outside, and if she's especially itchy I give her a benadryl.   I also switched her to a fish based food. Orijen six fish. It's very oily. I think it's helped with her dry skin/dandruff/itching. It's an expensive food though. You could probably get similar benefits from breaking open a fish oil capsule and squirting it on your dog's food.   If the itchiness doesn't clear up after allergy season, maybe try an elimination diet to rule out the possibly of a newly developed food allergy?   Allergies are weird and can develop even if the dog wasn't allergic to the allergen before. Also, lots of people have been experiencing pollen allergies for the first time lately, because the changing climate means more pollen in the air. It stands to reason that dogs can be affected as well.   To be safe, I'd take him to the vet."

So, like perfume only in reverse. ""MAN you smell rank/awesome! What have YOU been up to???"" Also a lot of things that we think ""smell bad"" have useful information to a dog. Slightly off food that would be bad for us is fine for a scavenger to eat. Poop has lots of information about the animal that produced it. Dead things in general might mean an opportunity for food. Those seem to be the main two disgusting things my dogs really like."
dogs,3dspqe,sugarhoneybadger,2,Sun Jul 19 02:50:28 2015 UTC,"Years ago, our dog got into trail mix with raisins. So, it was off to the emergency vet at 1am. (Quick aside: every time we had had her in the car, she puked. My hope was the ride to the vet would trigger this puke and avoid the need for the visit and expense.  Nope. This was the one time she was perfectly fine with a car ride).   After the initial check in, and while waiting to be processed in, a couple came in with their large dog who had been sprayed by a skunk. The vet techs immediately met them and told them to go back outside while they decided what to do.   Suzie wanted nothing more than to go investigate this novel smell.   There are definitely smells she doesn't care for, but her concept of good/bad smells has almost zero overlap with mine."
dogs,3dspqe,ljapa,2,Sun Jul 19 04:14:16 2015 UTC,Absolutely.   Some breeders do Early Scent Introduction and you can totally see in the video the difference between a puppy who likes a smell and doesn't like a smell.

You can use a little bit of Bag Balm to revitalize the paw, but don't overdo it and make it too soft! You can also try adding fish oil or such to your pup's diet to help a bit.  After the paw is better buy some Musher's Secret and put it on the paw regularly. This will help protect against the asphalt and hotter surfaces and keep the paws nice."

dogs,3dr74c,Aeriin,2,Sat Jul 18 19:03:11 2015 UTC,"I find the best time to put stuff on paws is bed time. If you can't find bag balm or musher's secret, get some coconut oil that way if the dog licks it, they won't get sick. Then I use toddler/infant socks to keep the stuff from getting all over the place. The sock is more comfortable than the boots/shoes.   Or use an adult sock and a rubber band to lightly hold it in place."

It was a rough illness to get over, and took a couple of weeks for the coughing to go away. He lost weight while sick as an already skinny juvenile. He got down to something like 42lbs at full height; he's a comfortable 54lbs now as a mature adult. This was a week or two post illness, and this is young adult way post illness-- he was probably 49/50lbs for perspective.   It may have been a normal case of kennel cough that progressed. Maybe get some puzzle toys for her.   Breaking up your lunch into two separate breaks might work, just feel it out and see how it goes. I'd get one of those metal pails for the crate and put water in there/clip to the side of the cage while you're at work. If that doesn't work, look into getting someone to let her out another time during the day."
dogs,3dqv9n,salukis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:46:34 2015 UTC,"Luckily I live three miles from work and have a flexible schedule. And my boss is a fellow animal lover. She knows my dog has been sick and asks about her frequently.  I'll look into the bowl clip, that's a good idea.   IDK if the pneumonia is aspiration or bacterial. She had a mild hacking cough when we got her almost two months ago, which we figured was just kennel cough. But it started getting worse and hasn't responded to the original treatment. I'm guessing it could have just spread to the lungs.   The vet showed us the X-ray and pointed out that she could see the esophagus, which is unusual. She says it could be a sign of megaesophagus, but diagnosing that involves giving the dog a radioactive pill and watching it move through the esophagus with an X-ray. So unless there are other signs it's not worth the expensive procedure. And my dog doesn't seem to have the eating problems that go with it.   Thankfully she still has a healthy appetite. She's a bit on the thin side. A healthy weight, but not much room to lose any. Hopefully that doesn't become an issue.   Thanks for your response. It's comforting to know that other dogs have gotten over more severe cases. Your dog is very handsome, btw.  :)"

They have more ""wolf like"" characteristics and typically are pretty quiet dogs when they aren't howling or singing (read: not big barkers).   While this breed type often appears menacing, they are usually very stranger friendly and not typically very territorial or have a lot of guard like inclinations so I don't think you have much to worry about. He's probably just curious. If it's never actually done anything to cause concern, I would either ignore him if you'd like or if you want to get to know him, ask your neighbor if he is okay with strangers and if you can meet him or give him the occasional treat so you can make friends."

dogs,3drg9q,tierrexx,3,Sat Jul 18 19:10:47 2015 UTC,Most dogs do so well after having a single leg amputated that I don't see the point of prosthetics. I think in most cases adapting to a prosthetic would be more difficult for the dog than learning to get around with three legs.
dogs,3drg9q,goldfish_king,3,Sat Jul 18 19:44:41 2015 UTC,"This. Prosthetic legs for humans are honestly a very painful and stressful thing to adapt too, having a dog try to do it is going to be much worse as your dog can't comprehend why you're making him do it. It would be more worth it to work with the doctor in strengthening the hips than it would be to try and worry about the lost limb."
dogs,3drg9q,stormeegedon,2,Sat Jul 18 19:53:05 2015 UTC,Amputation of the front leg is rougher in dogs than the hind. Your best bet is to see a veterinary oncologist if you are going to pursue treatment.  Radiation is often the better bet than chemo in this type of mass. In masses that are not completely resectable radiation therapy is often considered soon after the surgical wound has healed. I would not wait for tumor recurrence if you are considering this path.
dogs,3drg9q,iLoveNyQuil,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:17:31 2015 UTC,"Agree 100%.   If you are considering further treatment as an option, a veterinary oncologist would be able to tell you what the treatment options are, costs, median survival times with each option, etc. Depending on the biopsy report and what has already been done, they may recommend further testing to look for metastases, because the presence or absence of visible metastases may affect treatment decisions.   http://www.vetcancersociety.org/pet-owners/find-an-oncologist/"

I adopted my dog and she was skittish and nervous at first but we gave her love, praise, and space and within a few days she totally warmed up to us.   If you have any issues, try hand feeding the dog some of his food at meal time. Food can be a great way to bond with your dog.   Since your dog is still a puppy, you may want to try to stick to the food/walk schedule his foster has in place right now. That might make the transition easier.

dogs,3dniid,FighterPoetThinker,-20,Sat Jul 18 02:44:51 2015 UTC,"PETA actually provides free euthanasia services to people who need to put their pets down, but can't afford it because vets charge too much.  That obviously increases the euthanasia rate.  They also take in the most physically and mentally damaged animals that shelters and animal control won't deal with.  Shelters only take dogs that come to them, mostly well-to-do dogs with owners.  PETA actually has people out there in the community finding strays, abused dogs, and unhealthy dogs.  Your local no-kill shelter isn't going to take the old dog who barks and growls at everyone, that's for sure.  Obviously, that increases the euthanasia rate.  Another great service they provide is free or cheap spay and neuter services, so that the amount of strays is reduced and, maybe someday, they won't have to take in as many animals.  As you can see here, not only do they not consider pets to be slaves, they actually adopt animals that they've rescued out.  I support PETA because they're like the big receptacle of the animal world.  You have to think beyond the animals you come into contact with every day and consider the strays, the abused, the unhealthy that you don't come into contact with because they're not sociable, not healthy, chained up in a yard somewhere, etc.  Who takes care of them?    Unfortunately, not every animal is healthy, cute, sociable and well taken care of.  When you take all of the animals that need help and filter out the healthy ones, the cute ones, the friendly ones, the ones whose humans can afford vet care and euthanasia, PETA takes what's left.  Sometimes, they can be rehabilitated and PETA does that.  They adopt animals out and gives animals to shelters.  Sometimes they have to be put down because of what happened to them before PETA.  And if that's the case, I'm glad PETA is there to end their suffering."

People that bring animals to them are brought to shelters by the people who work at PETA, because they do not have facilities to take animals in."

dogs,3dniid,rachelface927,4,Sat Jul 18 03:16:14 2015 UTC,"First of all, PETA may not see animals as slaves, but they are opposed to people keeping pets in general. That is part of their mission statement. You can read more about it here.   They say they only want to end pet ownership through spaying and neutering, but they have been caught kidnapping and people's pets, so those are not the only methods they use.   Then there is this ridiculous argument that shelters don't accept or euthanize animals who are at their end stage of life, a completely unfounded notion you've just swallowed without thinking. In the South especially shelters will euthanize at the drop of a hat. I know dozens of people who have adopted healthy dogs that were in kill shelters down south. If these shelters will kill healthy animals, why would they turn away a sick and dying animal and refuse to euthanize it? It makes zero sense. It's a PR line for people like you.   Up north there are some no kill shelters, but the big ones do their best to rehome healthy animals, not kill them, they accept ALL animals, and they do euthanize animals when necessary. This argument that PETA makes that there are these unethical, no-backbone shelters is totally slanderous and goes against any kind of common sense or actual reality. If you don't believe me go find some shelter and volunteer there."
dogs,3dniid,Learned_Response,10,Sat Jul 18 11:07:36 2015 UTC,"Well... (separate links, btw)  PETA doesn't just want owned animals to be safe...in fact, they actually don't want you to even own animals. If you get down to it, they're against every single member of this sub for owning a dog (animals are not ""ours""). They'd rather you open your door and release it back onto the streets (so they can pick it up later and kill it). They want animals to be ""liberated"" from humans, as in we shouldn't have any control, ownership, exploitation, or general use of animals whatsoever. This includes:   No pets (which kind of contradicts the video, hence my comment), including service dogs which help humans live without harming the animal No food (even without killing live animals, such as eggs, milk not to mention fur or leather) No modern medicine, which relies on animal testing to make sure it's safe for human. You wouldn't have the vast majority of essential medicines without this. No zoos (though I disagree with the industrialization of most zoos, the general concept does help preserve endangered species and can give animals good homes)   They have a 90% kill rate. While the overwhelming stray population is difficult to control, they spend so much more money on propaganda than they do trying to rehabilitate and re-home animals, they prefer to just kill them. But yeah...they don't advertise that part.  They're on par with anti-abortionists with their horrific propaganda. It's shock value and doesn't work. But they don't care. They just want publicity.  Back to the modern medicine part, without animal testing, we wouldn't have a lot of integral, life-saving medicines, including insulin (which, btw the former VP of PETA needs to live...but whatever, she don't care, she does what she wants...)  PETA is a propagandist organization. They claim a lot of shit that just will never work in today's society. They're extremists that value animal life above humans, and are general hypocrites."
dogs,3dniid,AnalogDogg,-3,Sat Jul 18 03:22:51 2015 UTC,"PETA doesn't just want owned animals to be safe...in fact, they actually don't want you to even own animals.   That's nonsense. PETA even has a shelter where you can adopt an animal they've rescued.  Although, they're kept in ""guest rooms"", not cages.  They'll even drive the animal to you if you live anywhere on the east coast.  Here's the story of Justice, who was rescued from life on a chain outside, sheltered by PETA, and adopted by a PETA employee.  Soupster, rescued and sheltered by PETA, and adopted.  Joey.  Well, you know the drill, right?  He was rescued by PETA, sheltered by PETA, and adopted.   No food (even without killing live animals, such as eggs, milk not to mention fur or leather)   That's hardly a controversial opinion.  Opposing fur and leather is even mainstream.   No modern medicine, which relies on animal testing to make sure it's safe for human. You wouldn't have the vast majority of essential medicines without this.   They're not against things that have come from the work that has been done on animals, they just believe that we should be putting more focus on developing new animal-free technology than continuing to experiment on animals.   No zoos (though I disagree with the industrialization of most zoos, the general concept does help preserve endangered species and can give animals good homes)   PETA is in favor of true animal sanctuaries that treat their animals well.  Here's an arcticle on the difference between true animal sanctuaries and zoos.  Here's the story of a pig, who was rescued from life in squalor, sheltered by PETA, and transported to a wildlife sanctuary.  And two ducks who were rescued from living in a trailer and transported to a wildlife sanctuary.   They have a 90% kill rate.   Here's a comment I wrote about that.  Basically, PETA offers euthanasia services to people who need to put their pets down and can't afford it.  And they're a shelter of last resort.  They take the animals that are too old, sick, and/or damaged for the shelters to take.  A lot of animals are being brought to them because they need to be put down.   While the overwhelming stray population is difficult to control, they spend so much more money on propaganda than they do trying to rehabilitate and re-home animals, they prefer to just kill them. But yeah...they don't advertise that part.   Are you PETA's accountant?  I'd love to see the numbers on that.  They have an entire division devoted to ""rehabilitating and re-homing animals"".  And yes, they euthanize the ones they come across who are too badly damaged to live comfortably.  It's hard work, but it's important and it's good that someone does it.  So, I've completely refuted the specific claims you've made.  You'll have to be more specific about PETA propaganda you don't like if you want those to be refuted too.  You are right that PETA needs to allocate its resources better, but they probably need to focus on more ""propaganda"", seeing as how woefully misinformed you are.  I mean, you thought that PETA is against having pets, despite that fact that PETA HAS A SHELTER.  Really, it was laughable.  But, I guess they're making strides towards better informing the public, since they made that video you liked."
dogs,3dniid,Downbound92,3,Sat Jul 18 03:41:16 2015 UTC,"We at PETA very much love the animal companions who share our homes, but we believe that it would have been in the animals’ best interests if the institution of “pet keeping”—i.e., breeding animals to be kept and regarded as “pets”—never existed. This selfish desire to possess animals and receive love from them causes immeasurable suffering    From their website...so...you're wrong.   But I understand you don't think they're outright animal killers, but my point is that your anecdotal evidence means nothing in the face of their hard-nosed bizarre and downright backwards beliefs. I love animals and I don't think they should be kept apart from humans. Separating each species on this planet into a bubble apart from each other is a breakdown in ecosystems and absolute denial that we're a natural extension of the same biology that's continuously existed for billions of years. We live in this world together and live off each other. Without humans, dogs wouldn't exist. That's plain fact. Same as cats, since they're a product of urbanization.  Perhaps in your mind we shouldn't've ever tried to domesticate wolves, to help protect us and love us, but should've always fought and hunted them, killed them, and tried to live off plants. This wouldn't've allowed for the mass populations you see today, which includes you.  We as a species need animals to survive. If you want to fall back into a primitive stone-age, I'd rightfully choose to opt out and live in the modern world.  The very fact that my love for my dog (and well, all fucking dogs) allows them to live a comfortable life does not mean I'm providing ""immeasurable suffering"" to them. How could you possibly understand that perspective?  I don't think every supporter of PETA is evil, as a lot are misinformed, but I outright disagree with their motives and position on how the world works and how life and biology should exist. Humans will forever be the superior species on this planet, and to that we have discovered ways of working and cultivating other life to not just our benefit, but theirs as well. With that comes a responsibility to do it right and ethically. It's not easy, and a lot of people get in the way, but it's possible and the more we work towards that goal, the sooner it will come. PETA disagrees with that goal and doesn't offer a reasonable alternative. Supporting them is backwards and devalues human life."
dogs,3dniid,AnalogDogg,-1,Sat Jul 18 04:19:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe you should read the rest of the article?  It takes your experience into account.  Here's the ""immeasurable suffering"" they were talking about:   Millions of dogs spend their lives outdoors on heavy chains in all weather extremes or are kept locked up in tiny chain-link pens from which they can only watch the world go by. Millions more are confined to filthy wire cages in puppy mills, forced to churn out litter after litter until they wear out, at which time they are killed or dumped at the local animal shelter. Even in “good” homes, cats must relieve themselves in dirty litterboxes and often have the tips of their toes amputated through declawing. Dogs often have to drink water that has been sitting around for days, are hurried along on their walks, if they even get walked, and are yelled at to get off the furniture or be quiet.   And, as you can see from this quote, the article is actually about the importance of spaying and neutering your pets and not supporting breeding. They even encourage adopting multiple pets.  They're not disputing the entire history of keeping animals as pets, as you seem to think.     Contrary to myth, PETA does not want to confiscate animals who are well cared for and “set them free.” What we want is for the population of dogs and cats to be reduced through spaying and neutering and for people to adopt animals (preferably two so that they can keep each other company when their human companions aren’t home) from pounds or animal shelters—never from pet shops or breeders—thereby reducing suffering in the world.   And PETA isn't saying we could have always lived independent from animal products.  They're saying that we can now do it and that idea is hardly controversial, given the amount of vegan products and food out there.  So yah, I don't know if you only read the first paragraph of that article, until you got the quote you thought would make your point, or if you read the whole article and deliberately chose to take that quote out of context, but the misinformation continues.  This time, it's even more laughable since it could be refuted in the same article."
dogs,3dniid,Downbound92,3,Sat Jul 18 04:33:05 2015 UTC,"They're not disputing the entire history of keeping animals as pets, as you seem to think.   ...   we believe that it would have been in the animals’ best interests if the institution of “pet keeping”—i.e., breeding animals to be kept and regarded as “pets”—never existed.   I'm...I'm pasting the same quotes here, now. Their website is contradicting exactly what you're saying.  I get it, you're vegan and think whole foods can save the planet. But understand your over-privileged life is not identical to billions of others on this plant that cannot be sustained and live off of sea kelp. Animals are an important resource to keep people alive and without their calories, people die. Goat milk keeps millions of rural people alive who have zero access to the same cushy convenience stores you spend hours in trying to understand which brand of flax seed cereal has the most fiber.   lived independent from animal products.   They're saying that we can now do it and that idea is hardly controversial, given the amount of vegan products and food out there.   Again, not a viable resource for the vast majority of people, nor has it been scientifically proven this is the healthier and more financially stable option versus animal proteins. While it may resist heart disease in a refined-sugar invaded food culture like the US's, it also reduces body weight, which is exactly what many starving countries consider a death sentence. Stop thinking about yourself, and consider the lives of others. And, gonna pull the same card you've been pulling ""they""? List references, please...thank you!  Having shelters and pretending they want you to adopt pets doesn't mean PETA doesn't essentially want pet ownership to be nonexistent in the future. They want humans to live separate from animals entirely. That's pretty clear and if you don't understand, you really don't know what PETA is for.  And sorry, fuck that, I like my dog and I like living with animals. I like caring for them. I want animals to be treated better in many industries, but I also understand people need animals to live, the same way animals need animals to live, as in eat them. You say there are plenty of vegan options, yet fail to list resources, so...bullshit. It's not an option for the vast majority of the world and thinking it is really is self-centered and ignorant."
dogs,3dniid,AnalogDogg,-2,Sat Jul 18 05:14:52 2015 UTC,"You keep on omitting quotes, such as the very first line of the article:   We at PETA very much love the animal companions who share our homes   So obviously, they're not against pets. They say that pets would be better off not having been domesticated, but the article isn't about the past, it's about controlling the pet population for the future.   And, gonna pull the same card you've been pulling ""they""? List references, please...thank you!   Obviously, by they, I mean PETA.  PETA says we can live without animal products.  I notice you didn't provide references for your insane statement that people starve on vegan diets.  PETA isn't forcing veganism on anyone, they're just promoting it and people can decide for themselves whether they can make a change.  It's not a backwards message, it's pretty mainstream.  Are they not allowed to promote a cause they believe in?  People are capable of making decisions for themselves.  You should have more faith in people   Having shelters and pretending they want you to adopt pets doesn't mean PETA doesn't essentially want pet ownership to be nonexistent in the future.   I'm pretty sure having shelters, rescuing pets, rehabilitating them, and promoting adoptable pets means they want you to adopt pets.  You're going to have to provide references for your idea that PETA wants us to live without pets in the future.  Contrary to that, as I said before, they want you to live with multiple pets.  They just don't want new pets being created when there is an overpopulation crisis.  And I don't think it's necessary to list all of the places you can find vegan clothing and food.  It's an industry, you can Google it.  I can see where you realized you went wrong when I proved all of your preconceived notions about PETA wrong in your first comment.  The straw man you've created to attempt to save face is the biggest I've ever seen.  I'm sure your dogs are lovely and hopefully one day, if you want to adopt a neglected, abused animal or you suspect your neighbor is abusing their animal, or you run into a stray animal, or you need to put your animal to sleep, but can't afford to pay your vet to do it, someone directs you to PETA, for the sake of the animals."

I can't prove that they haven't, I can't prove a negative.  You can certainly find a protest where they've assaulted people.  And you're misinformed and following out of context numbers, which is a shame because you might need their help one day to save an animal of your own or adopt a new one.  Their kill rate being 90% is like how 90% of the people who go to McDonalds get a Big Mac.  People go there because they are the only resource for abused and unhealthy animals and destitute and incompetent owners.  They provide free euthanasia services for people who can't afford to have their animals put down.  They take in animals that shelters and animal control would have stay on the street or with their awful owners.  They go and seek out animals stray, unhealthy, and abused animals to rehabilitate if they can be or euthanize if they have to be.  If PETA was a no kill shelter that only took in healthy, cute, adoptable animals, their kill rate would be 0%.  But, that's not the animal clientele they deal with.  And if the world was only filled with healthy, cute, adoptable animals, what a lovely world that would be, even though some people seem to think that's already the case.  But, that's not the world we live in.  We live in a world where animals are neglected and abused more often than we'd like to think.  And we need PETA to take care of those animals because, let's face it, we're not going to."

I have provided context.  You can choose to be blind to the context and just believe numbers.  That's why PETA exists, to compensate for the ignorance of people and care for the animals affected by it.

I leave him in the car for 10 minutes or so on warm days occasionally (not > 80), but in the shade, all windows open about 5 inches each, doors unlocked (in case there is an emergency which I highly doubt).  He just curls up on the driver's seat and sleeps.  No signs of heat stress.  tl;dr Use common sense.

dogs,3dqgyd,0hai_,4,Sat Jul 18 13:35:51 2015 UTC,"How much exercise is she getting? If she's chewing out of boredom you might up the physical and mental exercise.   As far as chews - just stick to what she likes. 2-3 days to get through a bully is pretty long so as long as you're not overfeeding her on kibble and treats, the calories from that shouldn't be a huge deal. My guy is 20 lbs and goes through a 6"" bully in 20-45 min every 2-3 days. He's at a healthy weight."
dogs,3dqgyd,CBML50,2,Sat Jul 18 14:34:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, upping the exercise is a good idea. Took her to the park and many walks yesterday and she was tired the whole evening.  Also I might have to change that post - gave her a new bully stick this morning and she was done in 2-3 hours. But I'll just give her less food."
dogs,3dqgyd,CBML50,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:49:40 2015 UTC,"Yep exercise is great- it's a decent first ""cure"" for most annoying doggy habits (chewing, barking, jumping, etc).

dogs,3dq7rb,misplacedyank,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:29:21 2015 UTC,Wow... that is incredibly hot! What time of day do you walk?
dogs,3dq7rb,SharpStiletto,3,Sat Jul 18 12:41:28 2015 UTC,"It's bananas. We take him out early in the morning (like 6:30/7am or so) and then we usually keep him in until 8pm or so. But when it's not super duper humid I'll take him to the park around 6pm some nights (before sunset) just to let him run around for 20 minutes. Involves walking though so we put boots on him for the walk. He gets lots of attention and he laps it up because he's a goof. :)  It's far from ideal but, well, when it's hot as balls out you do what you gotta do. If he needs to go out in between his normal walkies, I boot him up and we go out so he can pee then we come back inside.  I thought about taking him to the park the other day because I walked outside and thought, ""Oooooh it's nice out today! I should bring Titan to the park!"" Then I got in my car and realized it was 115* but only 50% humidity so it didn't feel as brutal as the 124*/85%+ humidity of the day before.   Acclimatization is a bitch."

Your sunset is really early by comparison, here (Southern Europe) it is still after nine-thirty and the energetic exercise happens once the sun goes down.  Picture of your dog in boots please! Also, what model are they and would they be good for climbing over rocky terrain and walking on thorns?   He gets lots of attention and he laps it up because he's a goof. :)   Haha! Are you in a Muslim country?"
dogs,3dq7rb,SharpStiletto,2,Sat Jul 18 13:10:27 2015 UTC,"We don't have DST so no clock changing for us, hence the early sunset. And yes. Muslim country but the park on a military base so the people fussing over him are usually big manly men who think a dog in booties is the Greatest Thing Ever.   The locals just like to bark at him and ask how much he's for sale for. :/  Here's a video of him walking in his booties. They're pretty sturdy, I think they'd be good for rocks and thorns. They have a solid sole on them so they aren't flimsy. They're legit boots. Ruffwear Grip Trex You can see the bottoms here and how they have texture and are rubberized."
dogs,3dq7rb,misplacedyank,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:20:55 2015 UTC,"Sweet image! @ big manly men fawning  Unfortunate about the locals, but understandable; Western ideas of dog relationships are so very different. It's good they can experience seeing yours in booties!  Thanks for the vid (so cute!!) and infos. I'd checked out the Summit Trex boots recently. I'm wondering how my dog would fare on account of having double (and sticking out) rear dewclaws."
dogs,3dq7rb,SharpStiletto,2,Sun Jul 19 10:03:57 2015 UTC,"My dog doesn't have rear dew claws so I can't answer, just the front ones. But like I said, as long as you can tuck them in safely, I think it'd be okay.   I knew coming here that Western ideas regarding dogs were hugely different and I was ready for that. What I wasn't ready for was the way people literally bark at my dog and think it's a perfectly acceptable, and normal, thing to do. My dog doesn't like it and flips out. It's especially awkward at stoplights when people in the car next to us do it. :/  Also being asked how much we'll sell him for is really not cool. There's a lot of people who have had experiences with locals trying to buy/steal their dogs for fighting rings. It's awful and the best you can do is be vigilant, watch your dog, etc. I consider myself lucky that my dog is somewhat unfriendly to strangers and has a very mean sounding bark. It's a huge deterrent."
dogs,3dq7rb,misplacedyank,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:04:18 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I'm not sure about being to tuck them in. With one leg maybe, but with the other leg the top dewclaw sticks out at a 45 degree angle and it isn't floppily foldable, so unless it can poke out over the top, I'm not sure how / if it would work. It would be great to be able to try them on or return them easily, but I don't know how costly that'll be in my part of the world; I have to look into it. Thank you!  The barking at your dog is awful, I really feel for you and your dog. It's happened to me a few times over many years and I found it so annoying. Ugh! I've always had large dogs (Ridgebacks previously) and I think this makes some guys do silly things to show off and be ""macho"". *sigh* Even people whistling or doing kissy noises at my dogs irks me, because, what is the point?!? My dog is leashed!!  Ack. I know it is ignorance and not malice for the most part, they have no idea how stupid or (potentially) detrimental such actions are but it is tiresome to deal with and I can't imagine what it must be like for you there.  Oh, I didn't know or think that dog fighting was a thing in Middle Eastern countries. : /  I hope you have some positive experiences too and the chance to influence and expand the perspective of some of the locals, at least."
dogs,3dq7rb,SharpStiletto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:33:15 2015 UTC,"Haha wow, that's hot. Would you mind sharing the exact type of boot if you know it? Also, would you say the boots fit very well with your dog's paws? Do they fall off at all?"
dogs,3dq7rb,misplacedyank,2,Sat Jul 18 12:57:43 2015 UTC,"We have the Ruffwear Grip Trex booties. My dog is roughly 60 pounds, medium sized height-wise, and wears a medium in them. They fit pretty much perfectly. I can try to get a picture of his paw size if you really need it.  It took a bit of trial and error to get them to fit well because at first, they used to fall off or spin around and stuff. But what I've found is that if I slide his paw in (careful of the claws and dew claws if applicable!), then hold the boot by the edges and lightly tug, I can get them on all the way. Then I tighten down the velcro. You probably have to tighten this a bit more than you'd initially think. I was afraid of hurting him or cutting off circulation or something and was then leaving the boots too loose. Once I started really tugging down tight, wearing/walking in boots got better very quickly.   Edit - If it helps, I can try to get a video of me putting his boots on. Keyword being try.   I should also add, my pup is used to me handling his paws. He's been trained to stop inside the front door after coming in from outside in case we need to wipe his paws clean or something. So he's used to me handling all 4 of his paws. He doesn't love it but he puts up with it. Best way I've found to put the back boots on is the same way I wipe his back paws dry/clean - I stand over him and hold him by his tuck with my knees and then just pick up the paws/legs backwards and slide the boot on then let him put his leg down and tug the boots on and tighten the strap."

Really popular in England, and less so here, so they can be an interesting conversation starter/dog that people haven't seen. Further, they are a long-legged terrier and so they can keep up with you on long walks/jogs. Their coat gets stripped, which you can learn to do, but will probably want to have done, but you can reduce the frequency (maybe twice a year) with brushing. More importantly, they are adorable and loving dogs that are great around all types of people that they come into contact with."

Also, never get a breed with the intent of becoming more active, most breeds can rise to the challenge of a more active owner but very few high energy breeds will be content with a less active owner. I also don't like relying on a roommate to provide anything for a dog, it's going to be your dog not his. That said, I'd recomend an low to moderate energy, adult (1-2yrs+) rescue dog. Maybe look at older lab mixes or companion breed mixes. Another option is a rescued greyhound, low energy breed that are known for cuddling."

dogs,3dpyud,Danibelle903,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:50:11 2015 UTC,"I second the idea of a young adult. That's exactly what I went looking for. I really didn't want to train a puppy because they're so much work. I mean, they're babies. I definitely wanted a dog young enough that I would have a full lifetime with her. I opted for a chihuahua mix (unknown breeds) that's about 18-24 months. She still has young dog energy, but she's not a baby.   Another reason to adopt a 1-2 year old is the size. Shelters can guess at how big they think a dog might be based on what breeds they think a dog might be, but the only guarantee is a fully grown dog."

dogs,3dpyud,UpvotingMyBoyfriend,3,Sun Jul 19 04:32:04 2015 UTC,"A cocker spaniel might be a dog for you. I have a 3 month old cocker spaniel mix and her character is very much like a cocker spaniel's. She follows me wherever I go, she is a very cuddly dog and she is very focused on me(though she loves other people too!) Even though I've only had her for 7 weeks I know she is already becoming my buddy.  Cocker spaniels need grooming every week and maybe by a professional too every few months, but the breeder I bought my dog from said she did it herself and that worked perfectly fine. :)  I wouldn't get a purebred dog if I were you, a mix is cheaper to buy (and often they are healthier too!) and is just as cute as a purebred :)  Good luck finding your perfect dog!"

The breeder I got my dog from takes her dogs (one of which is a cocker) cycling every few days. Cockers are able to run for about half an hour or longer when they are used to a lot of exercise, so I think a cocker (or a cocker mix) might be a good choice."

dogs,3dpyud,renegade11,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:32:51 2015 UTC,"Although one wouldn't be a runner, a Boston Terrier might be a good match for the realistic amount of time you're going to have to play with the dog (needs between 15-30 minutes a day). They're smallish (though mine before my soon-to-be-ex took him was 30 pounds) , but they don't know it, have tons of personality, are easy to train, shed very little, and are absolutely about that bond (my soon-to-be-ex reports that he struggled to eat for about a week after she took him from me). They're kind of like all the awesomeness of boxers in a smaller package, though with their short snout they're not going to run with you (long). Still, they love their walks and have a good amount of playful energy, though they still love to cuddle.   Here's a picture of the Boston she took (the big one) and the Boston/Lab mix I've recently got to fill that hole in my life/heart.

It's easy to get a pup home and 2 hours later freak out because they haven't drank any water yet (trust me...I've been there!), but just remember that dogs have survived for thousands of years in inclement situations, being nervous for a few days won't hurt them :)  Also, for a dog living in an apartment, be sure to get lots of exercise!

Also, make sure they don't get stuck in any cupboards (which... does occasionally happen.)  Otherwise, just be sure to treat them like a dog. Maybe it's okay for them to use the furniture where a big dog couldn't, but otherwise try to imagine a 75lb dog when setting the rules.

dogs,3dr38r,Pointless_arguments,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:03:18 2015 UTC,Thank you.
dogs,3dr38r,octaffle,5,Sat Jul 18 18:48:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, dogs can become senile.  Look up ""dog dementia"" to read more about symptoms.  He may be hard of hearing or have difficulty seeing (or be physically limited in some other way) and that's why he isn't responding, but dementia is a possibility."
dogs,3dr38r,octaffle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:05:27 2015 UTC,Thank you. Is this a good source? He has only one of the listed symptoms.

dogs,3dpqfl,bulborb,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:44:55 2015 UTC,what do you mean by chow? sorry im not good with dog breeds
dogs,3dpqfl,bulborb,2,Sat Jul 18 06:47:42 2015 UTC,Chow (or Chow Chow) is a dog breed. Read up about them here. Your dog is not even close to purebred but there's a distinct quality of Chow mixes that your dog seems to have as well.
dogs,3dpqfl,bulborb,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:48:33 2015 UTC,To me he looks closer to a Finnish spitz than a chow chow. what made you say chow mix?
dogs,3dpqfl,AdamPhilly,5,Sat Jul 18 06:50:57 2015 UTC,"Well a Finnish Spitz mix is really rare unless you're in Finland. I said Chow because he has Spitz facial features, particularly the eyes and ears, the coat color, and I thought I also saw a spot on the tongue. He could also be part Basenji, who knows. Visual breed identification is only around 25% accurate."

dogs,3dqo5y,Blakeoo,2,Sat Jul 18 14:56:28 2015 UTC,"How much work have you put into crate training and how much exercise does he get each day? He's either destructive because he's bored (lack of exercise) or because of separation anxiety.  If it's separation anxiety you can fix that with a bit of training and working on making the crate a safe happy place that he likes to be.  Also don't just cave and let him in. If you think he's doing it for that reason then why not just let him in in the first place if you're going to cave? Consistency is key in training and if you can't consistently make him sleep in wherever ""out"" is (I don't know if you're letting him in the house or in your room or what) then just let him stay in. He might just be sleeping there because he likes it though. It's summer so it's likely hot wherever you are. Cold damp places are heaven for dogs in summer. My dog naps in the mud and sleeps on the concrete floor at night rather than the bed because it's cooler and he prefers it."
dogs,3dqo5y,WOOFCheCazzo,2,Sat Jul 18 15:11:06 2015 UTC,"One of my family's dogs used to sleep on the cold tile bathroom floor, wedged behind the toilet, every night all summer.   It was super annoying if you needed to get up to pee, she never wanted to move. She liked it back there. I assume she was too hot, it was Los Angeles and she was a dense-coated dog."
dogs,3dqo5y,goldfish_king,2,Sat Jul 18 16:04:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah mine likes to lay on the concrete right up against the door, or an inch away from it, so he's constantly getting whacked in the face with a door when people come into my room. You'd assume he'd pick elsewhere to sleep, but dogs are weird about where they sleep :P"
dogs,3dqo5y,WOOFCheCazzo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:07:18 2015 UTC,Getting kicked in the face like six times a day has not stopped my dog from sleeping under my desk.
dogs,3dqo5y,goldfish_king,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:15:37 2015 UTC,Thanks for replying. I walk him 30 minutes in the morning when I get up for work and 30 minutes when I get home before dinner. He gets roughly 7 hours or more exercise a week. I let him in only when it's raining because he is stubborn enough to lay there getting wet and shivering.  However last night putting the kennel next to the door he slept in it all night. I'm going to try and slowly move him down to where he should be sleeping.
dogs,3dqo5y,WOOFCheCazzo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:18:05 2015 UTC,It might help to give him a slightly longer walk in the evening or to play fetch with him right before bed so he's more worn out and ready to sleep.  Definitely try what you're doing though (plus the exercise if you can) I've heard of people who do that for their puppies. They start with the crate right next to their bed and move it a little bit every few night until the puppy is in a different room and it works fairly well from what I know.  Good luck!

dogs,3dmcjc,je_taime,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:15:12 2015 UTC,"First we did a class that ended with a CGC test, and then the next round of the class tested with Therapy Dogs International. Ice never had an issue with TDI but o know that Canine Companions is more popular/preferred now.  Right now if you can't find a class just make sure you are exposing your pup to all sorts of things. I had my mom use a wheelchair we owned to roll by and feed treats to Apollo, I had friends who we'd visit and they'd use crutches/canes/walk funny and reinforce that it's okay.   Best of luck to you and your pup!"
dogs,3dmcjc,FinnbarrGaledeep,2,Fri Jul 17 20:49:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! I feel pretty good about where he is at so far with no formal training. One thing we need to work on is him licking people's faces (affectionately) constantly. Did Apollo ever have issues with licking? Did any of the tests have anything about that?
dogs,3dmcjc,Synaxis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:42:52 2015 UTC,Apollo's never been a licker so no advice there. I do know there are restrictions about feeding dogs bully sticks/raw bones before going on visits though

dogs,3dphmx,homehealthgirl,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:41:04 2015 UTC,Probably got bit by something the last time it was out.  I have a dog that did that and 5 years later she still refuses to go outside without a fight and bribery with treats.
dogs,3dny2i,buttonupbanana,25,Fri Jul 17 20:32:38 2015 UTC,"Brush, brush, brush, brush, brush. I can't say this enough. If you can give him the occasional cool rinse - not ice cold, but definitely more cold than hot - that will help stimulate coat growth. There is no need to use shampoo for this, just 2x a week or so take a hose to him. While it's beginning to grow back you HAVE to brush him daily and make sure you stay on top of the undercoat as it grows in. It will feel different. His coat will definitely feel more coarse as it is growing back, this is the undercoat. Every dog is different so I can't tell you exactly how the coat will grow back in, but it's very likely the undercoat will come back before the guard hairs do. If you do not keep the growing hair brushed regularly it will very likely tangle up and the guard hairs will get stuck and tangle underneath.  I'm not going to lie to you. I work at a grooming shop, I have seen many owners intentionally bring their double coated dogs in for a shave. The coat goes through some really, really ugly uneven growth phases. He will have to go through an ugly duckling phase too. There's nothing that can be done for that except time.  In the meantime they do make sunscreen for dogs so that should help prevent sunburn especially on his pink bits, which is... pretty much everywhere. I can't help you when it comes to your dogs playing rough. The sensitivity just needs time, there's no saying how long that will last for, and I definitely can't give you an exact timeline for coat regrowth.. but expect a year at least. :(   If the groomer was a corporate big box type, ie. petsmart, petco, etc. call and complain to a manager and take it higher up if you have to. If it was a smaller shop, call and complain anyway and make sure you post reviews."
dogs,3dny2i,Synaxis,6,Fri Jul 17 21:13:51 2015 UTC,"I've read about the undercoat tangling up the guard hairs, thanks for reiterating this! I've been brushing him at least twice daily, even though he has almost no hair on his body. I'm not so much worried about the way he looks, even though I miss him being fluffy, I just want him to be able to brave the winter, and be generally healthy. I live in PA, winter starts around November here. He LOVES winter, he's outside as much as he possibly can be, I don't think he'll be grown in enough to enjoy it by then though."
dogs,3dny2i,Synaxis,10,Fri Jul 17 21:30:52 2015 UTC,"While his hair is super short it may be worth your while to drop the $10 and get a Kong Zoom Groom. It'll be useless against a full coat but it will help keep up with the loose undercoat so you can get it out as quickly as possible.  He should have enough coat by November to not entirely freeze. He will probably not have the weatherproofing effect the guard hairs provide which means he will feel the cold more, especially if he gets wet."
dogs,3dny2i,peachnyan,10,Fri Jul 17 21:56:00 2015 UTC,Also a zoom groom will feel much better on sensitive skin than a brush with metal teeth.

dogs,3dny2i,Synaxis,16,Sat Jul 18 00:45:24 2015 UTC,"he was matted pretty badly but with work they brushed out pretty well except for his hind legs under his tail, so after trying to get rid of them myself I took him to a groomer. I've read plenty of horror stories about shaving a pyr so I was really against them doing it.   OK I have to play devils advocate here.  How matted was he and how is he about being groomed? Has he ever been groomed before? I've seen a few situations where the owners insisted that the groomers de-mat a dog but the dog was either very badly matted and/or unable to tolerate prolonged grooming (was too agitated/aggressive/arthritic).  De-matting can be very unpleasant and some groomers would rather shave than put the dog through it.    Anyway, just bringing up some counter points."
dogs,3dny2i,slowaschalk,22,Fri Jul 17 22:00:03 2015 UTC,"Even if he was badly matted, the groomer should have made it plain that they wanted to shave him because he was horribly matted all over. They should have made it clear that they were not willing to do anything other than shave him and that if the owner wanted the dog dematted they'd have to go elsewhere.  If they discovered the dog was horribly matted only after they got the dog and the owner had explicitly stated they did not want the dog shaved down, they should have called the owner back.  It's true that it is usually kinder to shave a dog down than to attempt a full-body dematting, but you never surprise a client like that. Especially not when they were adamant they wanted to keep the coat."
dogs,3dny2i,Synaxis,3,Sat Jul 18 00:17:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean if they were going to shave him anyway, they shouldn't have taken him under the pretense that they would de-matt."
dogs,3dny2i,salukis,5,Sat Jul 18 01:23:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If the dog was even matted, which is certainly possible, but OP said they've been dematting the dog and brushing daily and could openly admit he was still really matted on the hind end.   Either way, yeah, dick move. Never lie to or intentionally mislead your clients."
dogs,3dny2i,danaofdoom,7,Sat Jul 18 01:33:56 2015 UTC,"Never a bad thing to look at it from a different point of view. I'm not a groomer, vet tech, or a dog professional anything but they were not bad enough to shave him down. I wouldn't have been mad if they shaved down his butt, where he was matted pretty badly. I keep up with brushing him, so the rest of his coat was good. He loves mud and stuff so he was no show dog, but absolutely didn't need shaved down. Because he loves being dirty, he wasn't in love with being groomed but certainly not aggressive about it. Mostly he would just roam around the house trying to avoid being prodded."

dogs,3dny2i,PSBJtotallyboss,13,Fri Jul 17 21:04:27 2015 UTC,"Questions about the company, they are a small company with a very small online presence. My main concern is making sure he's healthy, but I'm absolutely going to be a thorn in their side in a few days. Not only did they ignore my wishes, but they kept cutting me off when I tried explaining why I didn't want him shaved down and even talked down to me a few times. I'm the type of guy who usually doesn't take that kind of stuff but for some reason like I said, I still trusted them. I won't make that mistake again and I'll be sure other dog owners from my area know how they treat their customers and pets."

dogs,3dny2i,danaofdoom,8,Fri Jul 17 22:10:23 2015 UTC,I don't think it matters if they have much of an online presence or not. Your input could make a huge difference for the people who think to consult the internet before making an appointment.

Please write them a terse letter informing them you are reporting them to the Better Business Bureau and then write a clear honest review and sling it EVERYWHERE on the internet. I would not accept a refund, there is no simple cash repayment for the months of work it will take to re-grow your dog's beautiful coat.  Post it to your local pet page of Craig's list, to your facebook page, their facebook page, any local pet lovers/ schnauzer/poodle/pom/yorkie (high groom dogs) facebook pages, Yelp, Angie's List, and anyplace else you can think of.  It is as simple as copy and paste.  I would want anyone googling their company's name to run smack dab into my experience of their business. Of course, I freely admit I am a little blood thirsty when it comes to any mistreatment of my dog."
dogs,3dny2i,UpvotingMyBoyfriend,3,Sat Jul 18 04:13:36 2015 UTC,"Looks like since they are supposed to groom dogs professionally, they would have known a Pyr NEEDS the long coat for winter. Especially since you live in PA and the winters there from what i understand are harsh."
dogs,3dny2i,sincerely-sacha,2,Sat Jul 18 02:44:02 2015 UTC,You should go back and show them the damage to your dog's skin and give them a piece of your mind! They should at least refund you the cost of grooming.
dogs,3dny2i,Fauxx_Foxx,3,Sat Jul 18 16:18:04 2015 UTC,"I definitely disagree with them talking down to you, but as a groomer myself I'm going to be honest. A lot of groomers judge owners who have matted dogs..hard. Most of us have heard every story, "" Spike was at Grandma's for a week and he came back like this, he got lost for 3 days, he went to the lake yesterday"" and after hearing excuse after excuse for years, knowing that mats happen solely because the dog wasn't brushed (it's easy to miss spots and I understand that). But, since groomers know how much mats hurt, they usually judge quickly and don't care to listen as to why he's matted. Also, if he was matted bad enough to be shaved there, there's no negotiating that. If the groomer leaves the hair matted and bathes it, it will get way worse. Our number one oath is humanity before vanity, so leaving in mats to let them get worse is a big no no. As to why they shaved the entire dog, possibly they found other mats you may have missed and/or it would've looked bad for him to be partly shaved here and there instead of all over. I know many groomers who are guilty of doing what they think looks best rather than what's asked. They should have done what asked in reference to only shaving what's matted, even if they thought it would look less than great. But, if a groomer ever is rude to you then I would definitely leave and find a different groomer. If they can't be professional with you, they're even less professional to your dog when you leave. On a side note, try adding coconut oil to his food/water. I do this anyway, but it does promote skin and coat health. Also, if the brand of food you buy has fish options, fish has omega vitamins in it that help promote those things also."
dogs,3dny2i,slowaschalk,9,Sat Jul 18 03:22:55 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear about your pup. Its horrible to hear that a groomer would ever do this. And to act all snarky like that, asking if you ever went to grooming school? I'm sorry but last I checked groomers are supposed to comply with the client's request (within reason) as it will be the client who will have to deal with the animals after they leave the shop. Would a human hairdresser ever get away with doing something like that to a human? because the way I see it it is the exact same concept.   I really hope you report this to this groomer's superiors if they have any. Also I would definitely leave reviews on their social media pages, yelp and Better business bureau. I for one would thank you as a pet owner because I would NEVER want to take my pup to a place like that! Because of  this idiot you and your dog have to deal with all of this unnecessary stress and it isn't fair to either one of you!"

I don't have any advice but wanted to voice my disgust at the way they treated you!  Did THEY go to dog grooming school??  Most groomers in my area have a strict no-shave policy on double coated breeds. I was in once picking up dog food and there was a woman yelling at the groomer because the groomer refused to shave her dog. The woman absolutely refused to believe the reasons the groomer listed off for her. Some people.
dogs,3dny2i,homehealthgirl,3,Fri Jul 17 22:28:04 2015 UTC,"No clue on their credentials. I didn't even want to take him to a groomer, my mom was responsible for setting up the whole thing. The only reason I went along to drop him off was to tell them to not shave him down. My mom loves my dog and I think she just wanted an excuse to parade him around and hang out with him.  I bought this from amazon and it has great reviews, so hopefully he'll be ok."
dogs,3dny2i,homehealthgirl,5,Fri Jul 17 22:42:55 2015 UTC,"This is pretty awful, not going to lie. I have a friend who is a groomer and she will shave a double coated breed, but only when the owners absolutely request it, otherwise she's pretty careful to adhere to standards when it comes to double coated breeds.  Honestly, that's not even a good groom. There's a blunt line between where the shave ends, it's basically the type of cut techs would give a dog going into surgery. Quick and dirty.  If I were you, I would complain, and ask for a refund. First, you specifically asked for them NOT to shave your dog. Second, if they were going to go against your wishes or were having issues with the severity of his matting, they should have called you while in the process of grooming him before making the executive decision to shave him COMPLETELY. Third, if they refused to do anything other than shave him fully and felt they could not accomplish the cut you were asking for, or could not compromise with you to only shave his extremely matted areas, then they should have apologized and said that they wouldn't be able to groom your dog.  I would ask for a refund, and I would tell them that if this is the type of work they expect to be paid for and to be the reputation of your shop, that you will ensure that others know they aren't capable of handling anything other than basic shave-downs, nor are they sensitive to adhering to specific practices best suited to each breed and their coat type."
dogs,3dny2i,sincerely-sacha,10,Fri Jul 17 23:21:19 2015 UTC,"Poor baby. I would raise hell and take this higher and higher until something is done. Also, leave reviews on Yelp, facebook, and on their BBB page."
dogs,3dny2i,Lucky-Star,3,Fri Jul 17 21:03:44 2015 UTC,I wish I had advice but all I have is this rage.   I would lodge a complaint against the groomer.
dogs,3dny2i,Silvercelt,4,Sat Jul 18 01:10:34 2015 UTC,"Everything that can be said was said already, but I just wanted to let you know that sometimes the hair does grow back. There's a GP that my salon does (his name is Rambo) and he was shaved down at the rescue he was act because his coat was a solid pelt. His hair came back perfectly fine..  It's not always the case, but don't fret yet. I'd also maybe get some sunscreen for this summer, and you  can use aloe right now to help sooth the irritation."
dogs,3dny2i,Pointless_arguments,2,Sat Jul 18 02:12:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this, seriously. Seeing other dogs go back to normal absolutely helps!"
dogs,3dny2i,eddasong,2,Sat Jul 18 02:16:03 2015 UTC,How old is he? Usually if they are young and healthy the hair will come back.
dogs,3dny2i,eddasong,3,Sat Jul 18 02:29:10 2015 UTC,"pretty young, which gives me hope! He's a bit older than a year and a half."
dogs,3dny2i,Right_Me0w,3,Sat Jul 18 02:40:35 2015 UTC,"It may come back patchy for awhile but hopefully it should come back.   Also, ah, I'd recommend finding a new grooming salon :P"
dogs,3dny2i,Synaxis,2,Sat Jul 18 02:42:46 2015 UTC,The most solid advice given yet :P
dogs,3dny2i,Right_Me0w,6,Sat Jul 18 12:42:34 2015 UTC,"How badly matted was he? Before we raise torches and pitch forks at the groomers, we should take a look at the situation. If a dog is severely matted, sometimes it does more harm than good to try and brush it out."
dogs,3dny2i,slowaschalk,3,Fri Jul 17 23:00:50 2015 UTC,"I've answered this above, but he wasn't badly matted. I've been around dogs my whole life and have seen some bad cases, but he has the coat of a dog who loves mud. His hind legs, under the tail were pretty bad and have been since I rescued him, but that's it. If they felt they needed to shave him down on the back, I would have understood that. Honestly while I'm extremely mad at the groomer, I'm not calling for a witch hunt. I'm more concerned for my dog, and want to make sure he stays healthy."
dogs,3dny2i,Right_Me0w,3,Sat Jul 18 01:55:31 2015 UTC,"I shave my Aussie in the summer.  His hair coat is crazy and he seems much happier with the coat gone.  I let it grow back in winter.  Honestly, from working in a Vet clinic, if the coat is matted enough, sometimes you have no choice but to shave it down close to the skin.  Sometimes we can brush it out, but if it's knotted all the way down it can be a disaster.  We had a 5 hour shave job on a matted Chow once.  We had to do it in stages.  It was awful for everyone involved, including the dog.  There was no other way to groom him.   They shouldn't have been rude to you and maybe they didn't need to shave him down, maybe they did.  If his hair doesn't grow back I advise checking his thyroid levels.  My Aussie is hypothyroid but with meds and and a good T4 level, that crazy coat grows right back.  Edit: The shave job on the Chow took so long because we had to take a lot of breaks.  The owner did not want the dog anesthetized so we would take breaks when the dog started to get irritated with us.  He was a really good Chow.  Also wondering if the other dog is playing too rough with your dog and the long hair coat was protecting him or just hiding the wounds."
dogs,3dny2i,slowaschalk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:48:48 2015 UTC,"I would put some antibiotic ointment on the wounds.Just to be safe. I don't understand if he was matted some along his hind quarters, why they just didn't clip that just a TAD shorter comb out the rest of the mats, leaving the rest of his hair as it was. They didn't have to shave him BALD!! If a dog is tends to get matted around their hind quarters, in the future i'd just take some scissors and go through and cut the mats out. That way he wont be bald, and the hair there is a little shorter for his comfort if it becomes a problem."
dogs,3dny2i,Right_Me0w,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:37:37 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, he'll be fine. His fur will grow back more or less normally and his skin will toughen up after a few days. Don't worry about the scratches and abrasions from playing either; all dogs get scratches when they rough house, we just don't see it under the fur."
dogs,3dny2i,slowaschalk,6,Sat Jul 18 18:15:04 2015 UTC,"Clipping can damage the coat of a double coated breed, because it ruins the balance between the undercoat and guard hairs. The undercoat tends to grow at a much faster rate than the guard hairs so you end up with this dog with a soft woolly coat that doesn't offer the natural protection that an intact full coat would have given. Eventually the quality of the coat can improve, but it takes a lot of time and constant brushing and sometimes stripping of the undercoat till the guard hairs grow back. The fact that the dog is young and has only been clipped once improves the chances of the coat growing back okay.   If you constantly clip a dog sometimes the guard hairs never grow out fully so the quality of the coat and the protection it should've provided for the dog is basically ruined."
dogs,3dny2i,Right_Me0w,3,Fri Jul 17 23:12:00 2015 UTC,"The regularly maintenance of brushing a long haired dog is very different from the process of stripping out an out of control undercoat.   Hair is dead. Obviously the hair doesn't send signals to the follicle telling it that it was cut and needs to grow. Different hairs have different growth cycles. Look up anagen and catagen phases. The hair of the undercoat grows at a different rate as the guard hairs so when you clip to the skin as was done to this double coated breed the undercoat will grow back faster, seeming to be thicker and softer in texture than the guard hairs.   Even if a dog is a just a pet it still needs guard hairs to protect it from the elements. Guard hairs reflect the sun's rays, preventing sunburn and helping to maintain core body temperature. Guard hairs also offer protection from scratches from running through thick brush or playing roughly with other dogs, as was the case for this particular dog. In some breeds like labs it is the guard hairs that are oily and water repellant. Unless your dog is forever shielded from the sun and not allowed to interact with the wild of nature or boisterously play with other dogs then perhaps you can go ahead and shear it like a sheep, but why don't you just get a sheep instead of a double coated breed of dog?"
dogs,3dny2i,slowaschalk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:33:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly you are right, my dog doesn't seem to care at all. Definitely me who is worried and upset."
dogs,3dny2i,Right_Me0w,-10,Sat Jul 18 05:37:45 2015 UTC,"Ok. You guys both made a mistake here - your groomer should have never taken in your dog if they truly believed they could only shave your dog down to sucessfully de-matt him but should have instead refused the groom and sent you home with a brush because you obviously did not want him shaved. And you should have brushed him regularly so that he would not have gotten this way. That being said, you shouldn't bash/call/report your groomer because they did what they thought was the only option left to help your dog - instead, you should take him home and attempt to brush him out yourself next time if you ever come across this situation in the future. A groomer that gets paid from you to groom your dog is going to try their best to do the haircut YOU want, unless the dog is matted. This may not be what you want to hear, but it seems to be what has happened and a way to prevent it from happening again!"
dogs,3dny2i,slowaschalk,5,Sat Jul 18 12:29:07 2015 UTC,"And you should have brushed him regularly so that he would not have gotten this way.    may I refer you to:   and he was matted pretty badly but with work they brushed out pretty well except for his hind legs under his tail, so after trying to get rid of them myself I took him to a groomer.    If OP was able to recognize matting on the dog's britches and was able to recognize mats that they were then able to brush out over time, I'm inclined to think the dog may not have been matted all over.  Could have been, yes... but especially looking at that first picture, I kind of doubt it.   The groomer is 100% in the wrong here, if the dog was indeed matted all over they should have explicitly stated that they would not be willing to do anything to the dog except shave him. They certainly should not have given the owner the impression their dog would just get a nice neaten up when they intended to shave him from the start. If it did turn out that there was nothing that could be done other than shaving, they should have called the OP and actually informed them instead of springing such a huge surprise on them."
dogs,3dp76t,chicagomichael,2,Sat Jul 18 03:06:13 2015 UTC,"Simple answer, prob yes. Even if you don't hunt the dog is best off when he's doing the job he's supposed to do. Even if you don't hunt being involved in AKC hunt testing or NAVHDA, would be good for the dog and prob for you as well. But without LOTS of activity sporting dogs can be a big handful. I had a GSP and have a 2 year old GWP now. GSPs are great dogs, but do your dog a service and be a great owner and leader."
dogs,3dp76t,sweatmonster,2,Sat Jul 18 12:02:16 2015 UTC,"I don't have a GSP but I have two huskies and a Weim. For a younger GSP, you're probably looking at three hours a day of vigorous exercise. When my dogs were younger and I was working out of the house, I used to get up super early, take them to the off-leash park for an hour and then leave for work. A dog walker would take them to the dog park for an hour or so at lunch. Then I would take them out again after work for an hour to the off-leash park again."
dogs,3dp76t,mikeyo73,2,Sat Jul 18 12:23:47 2015 UTC,"I walk mine once a day for about 2 hours after work. There is a park 30 minute walk from my house so I walk there stay for about an hour. I let him run of leash during that time or because it has a stream running through it we found an awesome access point for him to go run around in the water. Then a 30 minute walk back. I don't think he is too much to maintain I'm single and he is 7 months old. For a while I went for lunch everyday, I work close to my house and one it's cheaper, two your dog needs that hour of freedom before going back into the crate. When I first started wanting this breed I thought he would be much harder to maintain but so far nothing too crazy. I'm planning on running him in NAVDA but work has had me swamped as of late I don't have the time currently to go to my breeders house and have him teach me. Honestly, I think you're way ahead of most dog owners just being concerned on if you can provide the necessary outlets for your dogs energy."
dogs,3dp76t,beatauburn7,2,Sat Jul 18 14:01:42 2015 UTC,"Not a good idea. I think many of us hold the belief that all dogs can adapt to our lives and circumstances if we simply love them enough but it isn't the case, really. Or not without enormous effort.  Three hours of running a day every day is recommended for them, plus I believe most breeders will not send this strong working breed to non-hunting homes.   If you're looking for a more laid-back athlete, definitely look into Labs. There's a reason they are so popular."

dogs,3dp90e,Poodle_Lady,2,Sat Jul 18 03:24:05 2015 UTC,"Sam needs more exercise. Period. Capturing calmness can only work to a degree. You might even find that, after a daily long walk, he's a very easy dog to own and you'd like to own him yourself! Exercise transforms dogs, you just have to find out how much they need. Try adding an extra hour walk to your day and see if that helps. I promise that when you find how much he needs, all the nipping, jumping, and barking will stop (provided you aren't rewarding him by giving him the attention he wants when he does this behavior).  Tyco needs to be redirected whenever he begins aggressive behavior. Telling him to ""go to his bed"" for instance, or up on a couch, etc, just removing himself from the situation, and given a treat when he listens. If he doesn't listen, punishment is isolation. A firm ""no"" and immediately he goes into another room, door closed, alone for just a minute. Bring him back in, rinse, repeat."
dogs,3dp90e,bulborb,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:43:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your comment! As for the more exercise comment - he gets 30 mins in the morning and an hour in the afternoon/evening, which is about my limit for walk time. I live in an apartment so I don't have a yard, and he doesn't play with toys so far (I've tried fetch and tug, neither one worked because he's too excited to notice the toy). I'm kind of afraid to take him to the dog park because he has no recall and I don't know how he'll behave, but I'm going to try tomorrow early in the morning (or maybe today late at night).  (Please don't judge me -- I didn't ask for this dog, I'm just trying to keep him happy and safe until I can rehome him)  I am considering spraying myself (arms/face) with bitter Apple to make licking less desirable to him. Is this a bad idea?  Thanks so much for your input!"
dogs,3dp90e,potato_is_meat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:30:45 2015 UTC,"We don't know what Sam's parents were like, it is possible he is simply a touch neurotic. He may also not know how to play with toys (or even what they are, depending on his background). Personally I don't think a visit to the dog park would go over too well if he's constantly nipping and bouncing and jumping up on to you, or possibly others. Dogs in general tend to enjoy each others' company when everyone is chilled out, laid back and - very importantly - following ""the rules"". A hyperactive, neurotic, springy dog can inspire others to try and ""calm him down"" with corrective nipping and vocalising.  Does he like food? Have you considered getting a puzzle toy that dispenses treats and showing him how it works? A hungry dog is an easily motivated dog. Lock yourself up in a clutter-free but small space so Sam isn't bouncing off the walls and dashing to and fro. Bop the treat toy a couple times, let him snarf the treats up. Soon he'll get wise to how it works. This works best when he's hungry, so if you need to hold off on breakfast that day, do so and make it up to him with the treats."

Dogs that regularly get bones or antlers will have less than dogs that do not.  Teeth brushing is a big thing. There are a ton of different brands out there, I just use this stuff by Nylabone that I got at Petsmart. Came with a toothbrush and a fingertip scrubber.  If your dog already has significant tartar buildup, it's time for professional cleaning."

She doesn't have significant buildup, just yellow residue on the upper part of her upper incisors and in a crevasse of her upper backmost teeth. The rest of her teeth are clean and white. I'm leaning towards a water additive to soften the tartar and more frequent brushing. Thanks for the info!"

dogs,3dpakn,Synaxis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:45:09 2015 UTC,"From what I have researched, excessive bathing causes odor by increasing oil production and irritating the skin.

dogs,3dpakn,misplacedyank,3,Sat Jul 18 04:04:01 2015 UTC,"If they're smelling especially dog-y, you probably want to give them more frequent baths. Or bring them to the groomer so you can be sure the shampoo is getting rinsed out appropriately."

dogs,3dpakn,_Nolo_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:13:39 2015 UTC,That's a bad idea and probably what causes the smell. Would you like to only shower when you got particularly dirty and not use soap? It's not a perfect example but you get my point. Maks goes to the groomer once a month and gets bathed if he rolls in something. Before I started taking him to the groomer regularly he got bathed whenever he started to smell. When you notice bad odor coming from the dogs bath them w/ shampoo. Try not to bath them more than once a month though.

One thing from Akita World regarding bathing Akitas is this,    Do not bathe your Akita too often because that will dry out the skin, deplete healthy oils from the coat and skin, and lead to scratching and irritation,  Akitas really don’t need bathing any more than 2-4 times a year. If your akitas get muddy, use some luke warm water and a clean cloth to wash them down.   Source"
dogs,3dpa2i,leafjerky,3,Sat Jul 18 03:34:15 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, as long as the dog has shelter, food, and water, there's not really anything you can do legally. I would try having a serious talk with your dad and stepmom, though. Crate training is definitely a thing, but just locking the dog in a crate all day is certainly not the way to do it. Dogs are social animals, and I agree, that setup is really fucking cruel.  I wonder if your dad or stepmom would be willing to exercise the dog every day? Like, they probably lock him away because he's too crazy when he's out, but I bet some dedicated exercise every day could really help him calm down, and be more manageable."
dogs,3dpa2i,barkingfree,2,Sat Jul 18 04:01:03 2015 UTC,"This is not a type of training. Crate training means giving your dog a safe space that they can access whenever they need it, using it for travel, potty training, or otherwise keeping them safe if they have separation anxiety. The most extreme (and still humane) cases of crating are less than 8 hours long and the dog is exercised before they go in, and willingly at that. What your stepmom is doing is not humane and is in fact borderline abusive.  Unfortunately, as the other commenter said, there is little to nothing you can do about it without getting involved yourself. You can try to call your SPCA for advice but they can't (or at least likely won't) send anyone out.   The first step is to sit down and talk to them and tell them that what they are doing is not right, it's not fair to the dog, and if they can't handle him then he needs to go somewhere that he can be actually taken care of. It's your choice to be upfront with your family, but that dog is most definitely suffering. Offer solutions. Why is he being put in there? Is he barking, chewing, running around? Tell them that there's a way to fix every problem imaginable with a dog and that you will help them with it. And if they don't want help, that you'll find the dog a new home."

I think seeing ribs depends a lot on the dog's general shape; for instance Cockers don't really have tuck ups, so it's not fair for me to judge my dogs based off their tuck ups (or lack thereof).  there's actually a really awesome (and sometimes admittedly crazy) Facebook group called ""No, Its not starving - dedicated to fit, healthy dogs!""

That said, I guess I can't say much about them not understanding because I'm here making a post about it, but at least I was willing to double check and be sure.

dogs,3dqjcn,greencollar316,5,Sat Jul 18 14:03:43 2015 UTC,"You can speculate or dream, would your dog defend you? It may, it may not. Most dogs who aren't guardian breeds wouldn't do anything but run or bark, (and then there are dogs who will defend you because they were conditioned/trained to do so). Many guardian breeds may growl, bark, charge, lunge, muzzle punch, body slam.. Etc. It depends on the dog how far they would take it, how strong their defense drive is, and how much training (impulse control especially) you have invested.   The fact that you have a social pit bull terrier is good, they are supposed to be social with people. (It is often said: don't get a pit for a guard dog, they will let anyone in.)  People do start in, and I agree, when you come across strangers or individuals who become confrontational over the littlest thing, over nothing... You always wonder, what are they thinking? Why would they do that? It isn't only unreasonable but it is also dangerous. Not just because they don't know how the dogs will react, they don't know how a person will react either.  But, even though it is nice to dream or wonder whether your dog would defend you;  Don't wish for it. As someone who has had that question answered, you really don't want it to be ""yes""."
dogs,3dqjcn,dog_face_painting,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:20:17 2015 UTC,"A question about your last statement of not wanting to find out that your dog would protect you. I'm afraid to ask, but did something bad happen to your dog because he/she defended you?"
dogs,3dqjcn,growol,3,Sat Jul 18 18:04:12 2015 UTC,"Oh no, nothing very terrible happened. But something terrible could have.  Don't get me wrong. It is great having dogs that are ready to protect you when there is good cause, from animals or people, (on the one hand). Yet then you either have a liability on your hands or the potential to lose your dog. With people, you need to be certain that 100% of the time they have perfect instincts, perfect timing, and that when they act it is because they must act. And to have a dog that independently recognizes that, understands what force or action is necessary and then release when necessary or on cue, that is not easy to achieve. If you didn't train for it specifically with schutzhund/personal protection, and then the dog takes the initiative themselves, just think about it. Now you have a dog that absolutely will act with a bite because it has the drive to do that, it wasn't a cue that was taught and given that caused them to act. It is just their drive and their display, one you didn't condition in training. So what do you do going forward? Even if it worked out great, even if it was justified (liked in my case), how are you certain your dog will have the instinct and control necessary to not repeat it unless the circumstances and situation is the same?   Once there is a record of 'aggression', even if it was a 'just cause' action, it could theoretically impact their ability to get involved in certain activities, like therapy work, depending on the organization. It can also impact insurance. And of course, depending on where you live, it could impact how you live or whether you can keep your dog.  With wildlife, it is just scary to face the realization that while your dog may be protecting you, or even be saving your life, they could be sacrificing their own. And no one wants that.  I only cautioned because for me, it was honestly stressful. While I valued the behavior(s) at the time, it created a need to train much more than planned, to be hyper vigilant to avoid an incident, and sometimes I can't avoid. Example: Neighbor has frequent parties and he invites friends over. While we are a good distance away from one another, not too close, they don't respect property lines when they are drunk. So they will come unto my property. And when I take my dogs out front late at night, it is dark out, I have had guys half dressed charge up to us yelling (because they drunkenly think that meeting strange dogs and people in the wee hours is a grand idea). This creates a very tense series of  moments and has caused more than one scare. (Especially if I take them out off leash.)   That one incident where the protection drive kicked into the ultimate display changed everything for all my dogs and I going forward. It changed how I trained, not just the one dog, but every dog. It changes my perception and it changed the way I observe and interact with the world and my dogs.   And I guess that is the point. The dog protects you. Then you think, what is going to happen now? Then after awhile you think, what could have happened? How much worse could that have been? Then it becomes, now I know she(he) has this response in her(him), where do I go from here? Finally, it becomes, is this going to happen again? This person is yelling at me, will she attack him? This person is acting funny, will she bite? This person rushed up to pet her, to hug her, surprised her... Will she be OK? How will she respond? That becomes your life. Even if your dog is incredibly social with seemingly great instincts (like mine is), it always is in your mind what if? All the training, all the preparation, all the contingencies and all the work you put in, even when you are 100+% certain like I am, with complete and absolute trust, that question is always at the back of my mind.  That is all."
dogs,3dqjcn,dog_face_painting,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:06:47 2015 UTC,"Well I'm glad to hear that nothing too terrible happened. But I can understand that being aware of all these possibilities with your dog must be very stressful. However, it sounds like by having all these thoughts you're being a responsible owner. Knowing what your dog is potentially capable of, even if there's only a .000001 chance of it happening, probably helps to ensure your dog navigates the world in a safer way than many other dogs.   Also, it sucks that you can't feel safe letting your dogs out on your own property. That should be the one place you and your dogs feel comfortable, but sounds like it can be a cause of stress depending on the day."

Also, in those videos the owners display fear which is then what the dogs also exhibit.  As to your comment about how it such an event would translate legality wise, perhaps.

Everyone who is brave enough to meet him loves him.  But he also has a protective nature, so I am curious what he would do if I were attacked, but of course never want to be in a situation where he would be tested.  However, just last week we were walking and this guy came up and started a conversation with me. He said something rude/creepy/crude to me that immediately put me on edge. Immediately, my dog who had been ignoring him just half a second earlier, turned towards him and started barking rather scarily. It was his ""I'm not happy with the situation"" bark that comes out very rarely (he's usually an excited yipper) with all his fur standing up. I don't know if he picked up on my unhappy vibes or the guys', but he definitely was paying attention to the situation. Still, who knows if that would have escalated if the guy walked towards me rather than running away as he did, or if my dog would have given up and hid behind me. He's not a fearful dog and he's shown his protective side a couple times, so I don't think he would have run away.

It's ridiculous to me to not be aware of that pretty big distinction. And to give a couple examples and expect a doggy behavioral analysis over the internet speaks volumes to me about that person's capabilities as a dog owner.  I bring this up because I'm getting criticized here for what some perceive to be irresponsible behavior on my part because I let my dog in a dog park even though she has two triggers for being dog aggressive. I feel like I am a great dog owner because I pay attention. I don't get overwhelmed by unwanted behaviors.

The problem with pitbulls isn't always aggression but that they are very good at fighting and can cause serious damage or death very quickly. If your dog is dog aggressive in any situations then you need to make sure that it is under your control (leashed) at all times. Or maybe think about investing in a muzzle so that if your dog does decide to attack another dog then at least the damage will be minimal."

IOW I pay attention.  Along those same lines, Re: muzzle recommendation, in the two instances where my dog was involved in an altercation at the dog park I observed that she did not bite or attempt to bite. She snarled, bared her teeth, and positioned herself so that her face was side to side with the other dog. She didn't face up to the other dog. My take away from these incidents was that she wasn't going to initiate a chomping. Semi-peace of mind.  Your argument that 'your dog is aggressive in any situation then you should leash it' is a product of the stupidity of people. A kind of blanket rule we must abide by because the majority of people (and thus people with dogs) are incapable of being fully aware of their surroundings and to interact as such. So yea, I'm for that mentality as well. But I don't feel like it applies to me because I'm proactive enough when it comes to monitoring my dog's behavior."
dogs,3dqjcn,rasputinspenis,3,Sun Jul 19 02:17:32 2015 UTC,I've had perhaps 2 incidents of my dog getting into it with another at the park in 2 years.    That is 2 too many. First time should have been the last time.
dogs,3dqjcn,stormeegedon,3,Sat Jul 18 21:10:19 2015 UTC,"There are sometimes dogs on leashes at dog parks. Sometimes playing escalates and a fight breaks out and if your dog does not stop when you tell her too, it can be bad. You need to address these situations. The bottom line is, your dog HAS shown aggression to other dogs, and as you cannot control what other dogs do that may trigger her to be aggressive at a dog park, you should be heavily considering limiting her play time to controlled environments with friend's dogs until it can be addressed."
dogs,3dqjcn,rasputinspenis,-3,Sat Jul 18 16:28:48 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying. It's solid advice. However, I have common sense and know what I'm doing when it comes to supervising my dog when she is around other people and dogs. I understand the responsibility I have. Besides, I don't think anyone can make a behavioral assessment of the situation based on the two posts you have read from me regarding it. Go ahead a dv again :)"
dogs,3dqjcn,stormeegedon,3,Sat Jul 18 16:33:22 2015 UTC,"It's merely some advice on the situation. You have a dog that has shown dog aggression, regardless of the situations. Leaving it untreated can allow it to escalate and grow. This is the exact reason I don't got to dog parks often- I can't control the environment and I can't control the people who continue to bring their aggressive dogs around, whether they feel they're responsible for it or not.   Edit: you cannot claim to have common sense. Common sense would dictate you recognize you have a dog aggressive dog that has shown dog aggression in the past and would discontinue exposing her to uncontrolled environments until these issues are resolved."
dogs,3dqjcn,MockingbirdRambler,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:40:13 2015 UTC,"I just adopted the muttiest ~10 month old who is (what I thought was) dog aggressive. When she's on-leash and we pass a dog, she starts barking like crazy. I've let her approach a few other leashed dogs and it's clear she just wants to play and barks out of frustration. She plays great at the dog park, has never started a fight, and bows out if other dogs play too rough. Does that constitute dog aggression in the sense that you think she'd be unsafe at a dog park?  It's starting to stress me out, which I know will only make it worse, but it's summer and there are dogs around every corner."
dogs,3dqjcn,MockingbirdRambler,2,Sun Jul 19 00:17:34 2015 UTC,"It's definitely something you'll want to address as it can be a definite stressor on you and others who may be startled by it, but it isn't aggression. Even when dogs play, they tend to make a lot of noise. My golden plays with our friend's pit bull and it looks like an all out fight and the sounds are a little scary, but they are most definitely not fighting noises. The best thing you can do now besides working on the problem is to remain calm and in control of your dog. Your dog can definitely sense your stress and how rigid you probably get when another dog comes around, so just try to keep things relaxed."
dogs,3dqjcn,Hermago,2,Sun Jul 19 00:52:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for responding. I always try to choose another path and can sometimes distract her with food, but usually she just has a bark-attack until she can't see the other dog. It's my first time owning a dog on my own and I worry people in the neighborhood perceive her as aggressive and therefore perceive me as a bad pet owner/awful human being but she's just a puppy c'mon everyone."
dogs,3dqjcn,cygnuswomyn,2,Sun Jul 19 01:19:05 2015 UTC,"I totally understand how you feel. I felt awful when my puppy rushed down the driveway, stopped suddenly, and growled at the little girl next door. She was riding one of those really large, plastic tricycles and had never been exposed to something like that before, especially one moving! I felt horrible and kept apologizing to them but they totally didn't care. They know he's friendly, and they understood that such a foreign object could be scary to a dog. He's completely fine now as he got older and more exposed to wheeled objects like that, but I definitely felt sick to my stomach for a few days thinking I had failed raising my dog!"
dogs,3dqjcn,MockingbirdRambler,-1,Sun Jul 19 01:33:39 2015 UTC,"Once again, solid advice. We can't control much of anything in this crazy reality of ours. My common sense dictates to me that I am comfortable with how I have assessed my dog's behavior and match that with how I let her interact in the big bad crazy world. My common sense tells me that I'm doing ok if nothing bad has happened in 2 years with my dog. My common sense tells me bad shit could always go down in any environment and that to live that mentality is not how I wish to be.  Solid advice though."

dogs,3dna4a,emilyeverafter,4,Fri Jul 17 17:34:20 2015 UTC,"You know, honestly, I would recommend BarkBox. It can be hard to pick out toys and treats for dogs you don't know, so it actually might be easier to kind of leave it up to chance. I get one every month for my dog who's super picky about treats and toys, and she almost always loves everything in the box. There have been a few duds, but it's easier to swallow when there are 3-4 other items to enjoy."
dogs,3dna4a,barkingfree,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:37:58 2015 UTC,"Well, that's an interesting point for sure! I might give it a try. But since there are two dogs, one small, one large, which box should I buy, and how long of a subscription?"
dogs,3dna4a,orangetangerine,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:48:29 2015 UTC,"I think a subscription card (or two) to BarkBox is awesome, actually!  One thing with BarkBox is that if your dog has any allergies they have a special e-mail to reach out to and they can do some requests to swap things out.  My sister got us a BarkBox for Christmas with an additional One Month box card included as well.  She knows my resident schnauzer mix super-well but forgot to tell BarkBox that my pup is allergic to chicken, so we had a few chicken treats my dog couldn't eat in there (it ended up being great since we use those for our foster dogs).  Honestly, I would probably consider buying a subscription card - one small dog and one larger dog - so they get appropriate treats and toys, and I'd ask her to see if either has allergies so you can tell the BarkBox team before they ship out the order.  (In my case for claiming my gift card, I had to place the order then e-mail them afterwards)."
dogs,3dna4a,Shannegans,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:55:36 2015 UTC,An alternative could be the Pooch Party Packs... I've gotten a couple of them and my dogs absolutely LOVE them. Everything in the box has been a total hit.
dogs,3dna4a,CBML50,2,Fri Jul 17 19:39:52 2015 UTC,Can you get him a gift card to a local store? That way they can go together and pick something out.   A short subscription to Barbox might not be bad either - it's really just a goody bag for dogs - some treats and toys. I would go with a larger size (for the pit) on that as it's better for a smaller dog to play with larger toys. Most dogs are pretty agreeable but every now and then you'll have one that's picky.
dogs,3dna4a,CBML50,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:40:31 2015 UTC,"We have a few niche, small franchise pet stores, a small aisle at Walmart, and a fairly decent-sized Petsmart in our town.  I'm a cat person (but I love dogs too!) and I definitely know what it's like to buy dud toys and treats for a picky animal. It's disappointing to say the least.  I'm curious about the smaller one playing with toys designed for a pit. Just out of curiosity, why would the larger box work for a small dog, but not a smaller box for a large dog?  I'll definitely give barkbox a second look. How long of a subscription would you recommend?"
dogs,3dna4a,afrael,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:52:22 2015 UTC,Well a mini-schnauzer is likely a decently rough and tumble pup for its size anyway. But mostly the choking/general destruction that can happen with toys that are too small. So barkbox has a size that cuts off like right at my pups weight and I went a size up - the only thing that's been too big for him was a bandana that was included one month.
dogs,3dna4a,schima65,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:36:07 2015 UTC,"What you can do is just get dried lung or dried heart, those are always good, if you would want to give small treats. I haven't yet met a dog who didn't go crazy for those.  If you want to make it extra special, there are many dog cookies recipes, and most dogs do like fresh food more than processed in my experience. Just put chicken or fish in, or liver if you don't mind the smell. Do be aware that with fish or liver to use disposable containers because the smell is REALLY hard to get rid of."
dogs,3dna4a,nkdeck07,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:58:09 2015 UTC,"Mancrates has a doggy crate that would definitely be a great starting point, then add some of your own touches for the smaller fellow or perhaps a barkbox as well. And mini Schnauzers are tough little pups and A bigger toy has never been an issue for us, so just avoid things that could be too small for the pit. Also Greenies are always a big hit with the pooches, and clean the teeth to boot!"

Lots of hugs and kisses, all the bad things for her to eat on her last day that she was never allowed to (or maybe was but are still extremely enjoyable) like hamburgers. Does she enjoy swimming? Its low impact on sore muscles and joints if you want to have her go on an outing to the beach or something. In home euthanasia comes highly recommended if you have a vet in your area that will do it. It's usually less stressful for the dog and yourself."
dogs,3dnj0a,Amerlan,2,Fri Jul 17 18:53:33 2015 UTC,"Do you want the healthy way or the unhealthy way?  Healthy:   Accept the fact that you're going to experience a lot of grief, but remember why you're doing it - so your dog does not suffer Talk to people. Be around people who who know your pain and can help you if possible. Even just talking to anyone, even online, will usually help try to remember the good times with her. Those memories tend to make up for the grief.    Unhealthy:  Get really drunk. I don't have much in the way of friends or family so this is my go-to. I had a dog die of parvo a few weeks ago.  Try to spend as much time with her as possible, take time off work if you can. Give her her favorite foods, including human foods (just don't overdo it, don't want to disturb her digestive system) play with her if she's up to it. If she like going for rides in the car, just drive her around town or something. Does she like the park? Take her, even if she doesn't play, she'll probably still enjoy it. If you have anyone who frequently visits your house, and she likes them, ask them to see her one last time. Do you let her sleep on the bed with you? If not, you may want to start. If possible, ask the vet to come to your house to put her down in your home. It will be much easier for both of you."
dogs,3dnj0a,S_M2,2,Fri Jul 17 19:04:26 2015 UTC,"I would second what others are saying.  Spend time with the dog, do your normal routine and just enjoy the every day moments with them. Sometimes knowing there's a finite end is actually a good thing, it makes you look at things like the way they enjoy the breeze during outdoor potty breaks, and how special that is.  Also take comfort in the fact that you have given your dog a full, meaningful life. You gave her a life, and when you're ready you will be able to do the same for another dog. The awful and beautiful thing about dogs is they teach us so much in so little time, and many life only an 8th of our lifetime, if not less. In your life you will get the opportunity to do what you did for her, for many other dogs. And inevitably when they leave us, they find a way to tell us when is the right time and who is the right one to take home and give a new life to.  I would also recommend at-home euthanasia. I haven't personally experienced it, but when I think about having to go put my dog down last fall...it was really hard to do that drive, and the drive home was absolutely agonizing.  Be prepared to cry and be angry and desperately sad, and be prepared to take care of yourself and cut yourself some slack when you need it."

You could always call your regular vet and have them put your verbal permission to let your friend make medical decisions for the next 2 weeks on file. Uh, not in the least! I did the same thing last time I out of town. I even labeled the baggies... I brought back a little bag of local cherries and blackberry honey for the petsitter. It was a nice touch in addition to what we were paying her.   Really though, it sounds like you've thought of everything! One more thing that comes to mind is that you might want to ask if there's anything you shouldn't bring-- like, if she already has a brush that will work for your dog, no sense in doubling up. Or if her Frenchie has a habit of destroying certain toys, you may want to leave those behind."
dogs,3dn27c,becomingk,7,Fri Jul 17 16:43:18 2015 UTC,"Better to make an account at your vet than give your friend the credit card. Not because you don't trust your friend but because in an emergency it'll just be easier for your friend to simply take your dog to the vet without worrying about the payment.  Have an open discussion with your friend about what measures to take or not to take in an emergency and inform your vet that your friend will be taking care of the dog and has permission to make decisions on your behalf.  When I board my dog or leave her with a house sitter I write her feeding instructions on top of her food bin with a measured scoop. I feel the pre-bagging is alittle overboard unless your feeding raw or something.  I tend to write an instruction manual for my dog. What time to feed her, how much exercise she needs, where the best places to exercise her, injuries to watch out for (Dacey gets the occasional skin infection and sometimes limps for no reason) as well as numbers of family, vets, boarding kennel and all that jazz. The more info the better, seriously, mine is like 2 pages long with bold, highlighted and underlined sections (plus a page of photos, what her chin looks like when she's got a chin infection, the kibble-to-water raito, etc)."
dogs,3dn27c,unclear_outcome,3,Fri Jul 17 17:08:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd see if you can put a card on file with your vet and whatever emergency/24-hour vet they refer to."
dogs,3dn27c,goldfish_king,4,Fri Jul 17 17:10:41 2015 UTC,"as someone who recently went through the experience of having my petsitter deal with a medical emergency [my dog was attacked while i was several states away], the credit card is a great idea if you trust your petsitter and don't have anyone they could call to cover an emergency bill. i had my petsitter call my parents to have them cover the bill, but her having one of our credit cards would have been easier for sure.  whoever brings the animal in to the vet is responsible for making medical decisions. it's not the same as it is with people where you need a legal next of kin to talk to the doctor directly. i told my petsitter to go ahead and do whatever needed to be done, not because the vets needed my permission but because i wanted her to feel confident that she was doing what i would do if i'd been there.  you're being very thoughtful and considerate with the other prep-work. kudos for making petsitting the easiest experience it can possbly be."
dogs,3dn27c,_ataraxia,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:00:55 2015 UTC,"I am thinking I should leave a credit card with her, just for veterinary emergencies. It has a $5K limit that is not currently used (basically just have it for vet emergency) so that would cover anything necessary. Good idea?    Yes, we always do this and it just gives me a piece of mind.     Following up on that, should I make some sort of release form giving my friend the ability to make medical decisions for my dog? Or will a vet do that anyway? I will be out of the country and completely unavailable should something go wrong.    Call your vet and inform them of the situation and give the name. We do that when our friends watch her and it makes them/the vet feel a lot better.     I'm giving her compensation for her time, on par with what I would pay to have her boarded, and am ""pre-bagging"" each meal and tossing it in a bag with her toys etc. so that there's not much to think about come feeding time. Is that a little overboard for two weeks, or is that alright?    Nope sounds good    Anything else I should know for long-term dog sitting? I will give her all of the vet info, boarding info, etc. just in case my dog becomes too much to handle, and will let her know that she can drop her off at any time and charge to the card just to give her an ""out.""    We write up a small 2-3 page document covering feeding, list of commands she knows, general poop schedule and any ""got-cha's"". It only takes maybe 5 min to read but our last dog sitter really appreciated it. We also gave him a bag of pre-made up frozen kongs which he said were a godsend in terms of getting her out of her shell."
dogs,3dn27c,nkdeck07,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:26:04 2015 UTC,"Wow it sounds like you really have thought all of this out lol  Personally I would just put your card on file at the vets instead of giving them the card, but thats just me. Also I would speak to my vet before hand to let them know someone else would be watching the dog. The pre-packaging food is an awesome idea, I usually just leave her feeding instructions with the sitter in the super detailed care manual I've (no joke th thing has a table of contents)  It seems like you have put a lot of thought into making it as easy as possible on your friend so I would say that the best thing you can do now is just try not to stress about it. You said she has watched your dog before for a couple of days? Then she probably has a good idea of what she is getting into, and you have already gone above and beyond to make her life easier. I wish some of the people I have pet sitted for would have been half as conscious!"
dogs,3dp6c0,teacherpalooza,7,Sat Jul 18 02:57:54 2015 UTC,"If you have to ask, then yes. You've already lost trust in this vet, and even if 100 people tell you the vet did everything right, do you really think you'll believe it?   I'm sorry for Cookie's passing. She was adorable and you are right, she absolutely didn't look her age. I'm glad you still have a buddy to cheer you up and keep your spirits up."
dogs,3dp6c0,overpriced_popcorn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:09:29 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for your loss, but I really think you should be talking to your vet instead of asking an online group of non-veterinarians.  It is your vet's obligation to explain to you what, why and how he/she is doing things.  To answer a few of your questions:    Can things really change that fast? [...] Am I looking at a situation where my dog's health just went downhill super fast?   Sortof. The liver is extremely resilient, and so signs of liver disease don't even actually show up until there is a ~75% loss of function. In other words, by the time you actually see symptoms, it's too late.   Why did my vet need a complicated test when the emergency vet just did bloodwork and made the same diagnosis?   I think this is something that your vet should have clarified with you, but I just need to say that bile acids (which are not ""complicated"" per se, it's just that most clinics can't do it in house) are a specific test for liver function. A chem panel (bloodwork) lists a few liver enzymes, not all of which are specific (meaning they can be affected by other things) or that don't always reliably change when there is actually something wrong.   I guess what I really want to communicate to you is that I sense a strong disconnect between you and the vet, and so I really encourage you to take your questions and concerns to them rather than speculate and find reasons to fuel the frustration. As a future veterinarian, I really resent when people say things like what /u/overpriced_popcorn commented:   If you have to ask, then yes. You've already lost trust in this vet, and even if 100 people tell you the vet did everything right, do you really think you'll believe it?   If I were Cookie's vet, I would want to know if you were unhappy with me or confused in any way. It would be a shame to miss the opportunity to reconcile my relationship with you as a client - not approaching your vet when you're unhappy about something is only a disservice to the vet. They're on your side, and they want to make sure they can prevent this kind of disconnect in the future."
dogs,3dp6c0,petites_pattes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:22:34 2015 UTC,"Whose job is it to bridge that disconnect? Is the owner supposed to know all the questions to ask, or should the vet be the one to explain what the bloodwork is looking at vs what it is not looking at?  You can be resentful all you want, but if you're going to make the owner do all the work in communicating, you're going to be a shitty vet, or any career you pick. As the professional, it is YOUR job to explain each pets' health info to the owner. If you don't do that, you aren't doing your job."
dogs,3dp6c0,overpriced_popcorn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:41:14 2015 UTC,"While I agree with this and think that that it is the vet's job to communicate your pet's health to you, a vet cannot read a client's mind all of the time. If I had just stopped seeing my vet because of some small miscommunication (yeah, that's his job, but he doesn't know what questions are on my mind), then I would've missed out of some great veterinary care. A working relationship does require communication between the two parties. The vet is human, too, and he might have his reasons for not explaining something, but it's impossible to know without asking.  I got upset with my vet recently over my dog's care, and as soon as I mentioned being frustrated and confused, my vet apologized profusely and walked me through everything in a more clear, concise way that was easier for me to understand and relieved my stress. He probably thought it was enough to just tell me the basics, but he didn't hesitate to stop and answer my questions and sort through the confusion I had!  I don't think you can blame everything on vets. Some of them have bad bedside manners, yeah, but if it's a vet that you have trusted for years, it's worth talking the problem out, imo."
dogs,3dp6c0,leaping-elk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:25:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what reading the client's mind has to do with saying, btw I'm ordering this bile test to check for liver function as our in house bloodwork doesn't show enough info.   I'm sure the OP can ask for more transparency in the future. But it doesn't sound like the OP wants a vet who isn't completely transparent as a default behavior."
dogs,3dp6c0,overpriced_popcorn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:02:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input. I guess I'm a little hesitant because I feel like I'd pretty much be accusing my vet of not being a good knowledgeable vet (well, accusing is a little harsh, but you know what I mean). Because it's basically ""why did the other vet immediately see that the blood test results pointed to liver failure, but you didn't see that?"" and I worry that it would be interpreted as ""you're a crappy vet."" Which might be true, but also might not, and I don't like upsetting, angering, or insulting people. I posted this here because I hate the ""questioning competence"" conversations and would rather avoid them if at all possible. Having input from others helps me a lot.  I guess my ultimate question, then, is this: Was my vet not knowledgeable enough to pick up on liver failure from the bloodwork, or did he not see it because there was nothing to see? It just seems concerning to me that one vet says the results look inconclusive and the next day another vet says it's liver failure.   This might or might not be relevant, but this has happened before. Same dog, different vet. Cookie had bladder stones and the first vet put her on prescription food to dissolve them. A couple days later, Cookie started vomiting and peeing blood, and had to have emergency surgery to remove the stones - her bladder was full of them and could have ruptured. I know the first vet was being conservative in the treatment and hoping to avoid surgery, but shouldn't she have noticed how severe my dog's condition was? Why did the first vet say her condition wasn't that bad and the other tell me it was a severe case, and which was it: moderate or severe? I stopped taking Cookie to that vet after that."

dogs,3dmsjo,schradernater,6,Fri Jul 17 15:21:14 2015 UTC,So few things 1.) Is get her checked by a vet. She may be able to force herself to hold it but it may be uncomfortable for her if she is going that frequently. Once she's got a clean bill of health you can fix the problem by making it so she can't sneak off to pee. That means she's either crate or tethered to you on a leash at all times.  Another thing you can do is look into bell training. Essentially you train her to ring a bell every time she needs to go. However there are mixed feelings on this as you are giving her more then enough opportunities to pee and many people feel the dog should hold it until you tell them good.
dogs,3dmsjo,nkdeck07,2,Fri Jul 17 15:29:16 2015 UTC,"We have been leashing her after all this very often, but it's just those couple times that we think it's safe (right after she comes inside) that our guard is down and she pees. But I think a trip to the vet is a good idea.   I'll look into bell training, but from the looks of her other behavior she would abuse it. She has whined before to go outside just to lay down. I think we need to step up the consistency of giving her treats when she pees outside too to motivate her.   Thanks for the response!"
dogs,3dmsjo,ColbearKeeper,2,Fri Jul 17 18:34:52 2015 UTC,Not sure if this applies but my sister in law had a problem with her dog only peeing enough to relieve the pressure so she could go back to playing. Of course still take your fur baby to the vet but just look for behavior surrounding bathroom breaks.

I wouldn't go to the hospital for me vomiting once and then being fine, I didn't think vomiting alone was a vet issue."
dogs,3dni42,bulborb,3,Fri Jul 17 18:45:15 2015 UTC,Dogs vomit when they have blockages in their stomach or something has upset them (such as grass or too much food at once). They shouldn't be picking up infectious diseases and vomiting on multiple occasions per year. Changes in diet should not induce the vomiting of bile. It's worrisome that this hasn't been checked by a vet.
dogs,3dni42,goldfish_king,3,Fri Jul 17 19:12:59 2015 UTC,Can't dogs get flu like diseases just like people?   Not really.   Don't some dogs vomit with a change of food?   That would be extremely abnormal.
dogs,3dni42,nkdeck07,2,Fri Jul 17 19:13:41 2015 UTC,How often has it been occurring? You say not that often but even once a month is more then enough to be concerning. The only vomiting that isn't cause for concern is when it has a very clear and obvious cause such as car sickness or drinking sea water.
dogs,3dkwcr,skittling,5,Fri Jul 17 02:31:47 2015 UTC,"From Bruce Fogle's What's Up With My Dog?:  Some breeds, including the Dobermann, Boxer, Bulldog, and Airedale Terrier, experience a symmetrical and seasonal loss of hair on their flanks. The hair loss may be so drastic that they develop large dark-skinned bald patches. Although the cause of this seasonal loss is still not understood, this hair loss is self-limiting. Hair usually regrows during the next hair-growing cycle.  I would give your vet a call just to be sure (ask them to check his thyroid as Dobes are prone to hypothyroidism after the age of four) and keep him up to date on his worm/flea preventatives."

I know there's an urge for the XCA breeders to be more transparent about what issues come up in their dogs and lines, and there are breeders out there who have no problem telling you what you should keep an eye out for. However, this whole ""the breed is healthy because they come from the mountains!"" deal can only go on for so long. Isn't that what happened to the Canaan Dog? Anyway, like I said, there does seem to be some insistence by key members of the Xolo Club to be more aware of the issues that have come up in the breed (eye problems in the smaller sizes, hd, kidney issues) so I hope to see something crop up in the coming years. Which sounds like a weird thing to say lol. Great resource, though!"

dogs,3djc7n,punstersquared,4,Thu Jul 16 20:12:57 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you have to think about dogs within the same breed as being distinct populations from one another.  The breed club people are not the same people churning out labs for $100 a pop on Craisglist and not the same people breeding hunting dogs down south.  There could be differences in health between those populations and it's possible breed club labs don't suffer from those at the rate non-breed club labs do and vice versa.  I say that because breed clubs are usually populated by conformation people and conformation labs are really jacked up.  It's not a surprise to me that infertility is a concern in show labs.    It's possible show labs also escape the rampant food allergies and itchy skin, but it's also possible that the breed club just isn't interested in those common ailments that are remedied by changing food or using a special shampoo."

There were a number of diseases like that listed, e.g, exercise-induced collapse in Labs. It seems to me that this list is trying to serve several purposes that only partially overlap. The problems that puppy buyers and breeders need to be aware of, such as those which have DNA markers identified, are not always the same ones that need research money."

dogs,3djc7n,PommeDeSang,4,Fri Jul 17 01:48:00 2015 UTC,"I've heard that mutts are supposed to be heartier than purebreds, but could someone help explain to me why that is? For example, my dog is part cocker spaniel and part beagle. Beagles can get hip dysplasia, and cocker spaniels can get melanoma. Could my dog get both? Also, both breeds have ""epilepsy"" listed. Does that mean he's got a higher chance of getting that?  Thank you in advance for clarifying!"
dogs,3djc7n,cwithay,8,Thu Jul 16 23:19:47 2015 UTC,A mutt can develop anything the purebred parents could if it doesn't require both parents to have it(some issues require both parents to be carriers/afflicted.)  Many of the most common issues affect a number of breeds so the blanket notion that being mixed = healthy is faulty. Healthy parents are less likely to have unhealthy offspring vs unhealthy parents. That applies to mutts and purebreds.
dogs,3djc7n,overpriced_popcorn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:45:58 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot of sense. Thank you for explaining that! Right now, my beagle/cocker spaniel mix just has the allergies. Fingers crossed that that's as bad as it gets."
dogs,3djc7n,cwithay,4,Fri Jul 17 04:29:00 2015 UTC,"The hardiness is due to less homozygosity. Some purebred breeds ended up that all of the dogs in that breed are closely related (couple reasons for that) but basically there's not enough genetic diversity going on. Health issues pop up that wouldn't normally be seen because shitty genes get passed along completely hidden accidentally until OOPS, there it is. You can't see it or test for it, and now it's popping up in the breed. It takes years to identify where it is coming from or to develop a genetic test. Some issues are downright impossible to pinpoint, like allergies.   When people cross those stupid doodle breeds, they are playing on the chance that Breed A and Poodle will be different enough that the puppies dodge the health bullets of both breeds. Sometimes (a lot of times?) it works, but sometimes it backfires tremendously."
dogs,3djc7n,punstersquared,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:42:40 2015 UTC,"This is bringing back biology class from way long ago -- does this have something to do with whether or not a gene is recessive? So some of the health concerns are recessive, so you'd want to breed dogs who don't have those genes and are more dominant to cover up the recessive ""bad"" traits?"
dogs,3djc7n,cwithay,4,Fri Jul 17 04:30:47 2015 UTC,"Right. So something like exercise-induced collapse in Labradors is passed along in a simple, single gene, autosomal recessive fashion. The pup has to inherit a recessive allele from each parent to be affected, which only happens if both parents are Labs or one of the other breeds that get EIC.   However, many, many genetic health problems are present in multiple breeds of similar types that may be crossed with each other; others may be dominant, codominant, and/or due to additive effects of multiple genes with alleles that are present in many breeds. For some problems, it may even be that there aren't disease-causing mutations occurring, just that certain combinations of alleles are better than others. For a made-up example, if you have ""back"" gene that controls length of back, and it can be long or short, and a ""leg"" gene that can be long or short, a long back paired with long legs is going to result in a better structured dog, while short back pairs better with short legs. If you just look at the back gene, neither long nor short is inherently preferable, as both Greyhounds and Chihuahuas suit themselves perfectly fine, but Doxies and Corgis, as wonderful as they are, are more prone to vertebral problems. By breeding mutts, it's impossible to know exactly how those interactions all going to pan out. It may be better than the original, but it may be worse. Breeding healthy parents that are morphologically similar to each other and are ""breeding true"" is more predictable than cross-breeding.   And, of course, other traits on the list are affected not only by a number of different genes interacting with each other but also by environment.   One of the classic examples of all of the above is hip dysplasia. While there's breed variation in prevalence and some of the specifics regarding interpretation of radiographs in breeding stock, pretty much any type of dog whose lean adult weight is above 45 lbs or so is at risk for hip dysplasia. Retrievers, Shepherds, Mastiffs, it doesn't matter. A large number of different genes go into making a hip, and the expression of these genes is affected by how the dog is fed and exercised as it develops. You get hip dysplasia regardless of whether it's your socket that's not formed right (acetabulum), your ball (head of the femur), or both. It gets even more complicated when you consider that radiologic findings are imperfectly correlated with actual clinical signs. Breeding a Lab to a GSD may make you less likely to have EIC or anal furunculosis, but you still need to worry about hips."

Everything from money making conspiracy theory, to how vaccines are literally killing pets, to vaccines being the cause of autoimmune issues (allergies, epilepsy, cancer, etc)  It's like people are taking a personal offense to a dog being vaccinated yearly if 3 years is sufficient. So then the schedule moves to 3 years, but now they hear 5 or 7 years might be fine. There's this weird rage? Like, how dare you expect me to vaccinate my pet more than I absolutely need to!   I mean, I'm all for the path of least resistance. But if my dog develops cancer because it was being vaccinated, then something was already fucked up with that dog's genetics or environment. It's a lot like food. People think Pedigree or Kibbles 'n Bits is the cause of all that is wrong with dogs.

And I definitely think it's because of the overall terrible genetic condition of pugs; they're very prone to a lot of autoimmune problems, among other things, which I assume has something to do with their propensity to have terrible allergic reactions to vaccines that are totally safe for the average dog."

Whenever I am sick he stays by my side. When I went into labor, he was about 7, I let my husband sleep all night and just had Lucky by my side to nuzzle me or gently lick my cheek when I would abruptly awake with another contraction.

dogs,3dhquk,PwnShop85,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:05:06 2015 UTC,My rescued pit bull will hug in a similar manner. Sometimes just because she wants to and most often when me or my SO are upset.
dogs,3dhquk,Username_123,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:48:16 2015 UTC,"If my boyfriend or myself get really upset, he'll come over, jump up to get on the same level as your face, and lick it for like 20 minutes. My boyfriend often times will sit on the couch and bend over with his head in his hands, elbows on his knees, and Murphy will instantly run over to him, get under his hands and lick his face until he feels better. It's really cute.       I also have a medical condition where basically every day is a toss up about whether I feel good or not, and on my really bad days, I believe Murphy knows. He goes from being a crazy 1 year old pup to being really mellow and just cuddling me all day. I love dogs."

dogs,3dhquk,octaffle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:25:58 2015 UTC,My dogs become super sweet and cuddly when I am sick. My bigger dog can reach my shoulders on his hind legs and will give me hugs. He also thinks he is a lap dog. http://imgur.com/N0F1uTp
dogs,3dhquk,Angry_Caveman_Lawyer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:27:13 2015 UTC,"Mine has been very comforting lately. I've been having a bad week, with some fatigue problems and feeling a little blue. And my husband and I had an argument a few nights ago. Our dog curled up in bed with me and put her head in my lap and and did that little tail thump she does which seems to say ""I love you, human."" I think she was also seeking comfort though, she hasn't really seen us yell at each other before.   She always stops being hyper and sniffs and snuggles me when I cry.   They definitely know when you're upset. Dogs are great at reading human emotion. Even if they don't understand the complexities, they understand that you're unhappy and they want to fix it. They're such great animals."
dogs,3dhquk,octaffle,5,Fri Jul 17 06:15:11 2015 UTC,"OP, I was in a bad environment that drove me to feel suicidal, too.  Like you, my dog helped me cope.  I would take my dog places and distract myself with his needs.  That helped me get by, but I  needed to go see a therapist to really start to feel better.  Of course, the only way to put a stop to it for good was to get out of there.  I don't know what your situation is, but do try to find a friend or family member that you can feel safe with and spend lots of time at their place (with your dog).  Try to make preparations to move out, however far in the future that may be.  In the meantime, when you have the motivation and energy to do something, do something for yourself that you like to do.    I think my dog can smell when I am having a really hard time and he needs to be with me...?  I was extremely despondent yesterday and I laid on the floor.  He came over to me and as he was turning around to leave, caught a whiff of my breath and looked slightly alarmed.  Then he laid down right next to me and followed me around for the rest of the night.  He's done that sort of thing before, too, but only when I am feeling unusually distressed.  He's my emotional support animal and he's damn good at his job."
dogs,3dhquk,Angry_Caveman_Lawyer,3,Thu Jul 16 16:04:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's about smell, I just think dogs are so incredibly amazing at reading our body language it seems like magic is all.  Of course I could be wrong, but I've never heard of someone's breath smelling differently due to how they feel.  Either way, that's awesome of Waffle to do that for you.  I just give my dogs a specific look and they're in instant play mode.  Or if I'm in a bad mood, as soon as I walk in the door they leave me alone.  (not because I'd hit them or anything, but because they just like ""I don't want to be around you, you big bummer of a human"".  It almost always cheers me right up, once I realize the dogs are leaving me alone because I'm being a tard)"
dogs,3dhquk,serume,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:55:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's terribly far-fetched that he could be able to smell some biomarker that I am in emotional turmoil.  Dogs can smell diabetes and cancer, after all.  Going by the neurotransmitter theory of mood, lack or excess of some chemical affects how a person feels.  Those chemicals could impact the volatile organic compounds that are breathed out and he may be able to smell the difference in the balance of chemicals.  As you said, dogs are incredibly observant; connecting mood to the way breath smells would probably only take a few repetitions.    I don't think it was my body language for numerous reasons and the clingy behavior has happened after a good sniff before, so I don't think it was a coincidence, but it could have been."

It became very clear during the short conversation that I personally (not my experience or education) was the reason I didn't get the position. After we hung up, I crept into a corner of the sofa and cried.   My boy, who hadn't been on the sofa in more than a month (we had had guests and didn't want fur on everything) jumped up to give me kisses until I stopped crying. Then he jumped down again."
dogs,3dhquk,rya11111,3,Thu Jul 16 13:53:44 2015 UTC,I know exactly what you mean. If I am in a bad mood when I come home from work my dog simply sits next to me on the bed and puts her paw on my leg. She will sit with me like that for as long as it takes for me to smile again. It's so weird that they can pick up on that stuff with almost no cue.

I love when my pup comes up and nudges my arm with her head so I'm left with my arm around her and her leaning into me.   Also, every morning she waits for me to wake up and I see or hear her tail thumping.  I call her over and she curls up next me and leans into my chest, sometimes laying her head on my shoulder.  One of the best ways to wake up.    I'm so sorry to hear about your living situation.  If that dog is your reason to keep going, then hold on to her - it's an awesome reason to wake up every day.  Your circumstances can change, so keep hope that you and your buddy will find a more peaceful home.  Also, please find someone to talk to.

dogs,3dhquk,buttercupchico,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:52:15 2015 UTC,My dog likes hugs too. It's one of my favorite things about her.   I kneel down and give her a loose hug from the side around her chest and she will nuzzle and tilt her head up around my shoulder and rest it there. Sometimes she will give me neck and ear kisses while she's back there. Adorable but messy.  She also will run up to me if I've been gone a while and just tilt her head into my chest while I'm knelt and stand there with all her weight pressed into me like that for a while as I pet her. It's very cute.
dogs,3dhquk,walkerlucas,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:24:59 2015 UTC,My pup gets upset when there's yelling or any type of angry tension. She instantly tucks her tail and looks sad and tries to cuddle. My dad can just say something loudly and snappy and she gets upset.   My parents notice this and try to keep themselves under control. Same with me - I try to keep calm around the little poop.   When I'm feeling sick she'll spend the day cuddling in bed with me. She'll curl up by my tummy or under my butt. Sometimes she pushes her head onto me in a kind of love headbutt.

I can't count the number of vacuums I've gone through or how many didn't work well when they did run.  After months of research, I bought a Miele canister.  It  wasn't cheap but it was way less than the Rainbows I used to sell and way better.    Do your own research but definitely look at Miele and don't buy into the Dyson hype.  I hear they break often and repairs are expensive.    Edit: I bought the S8 Cat & Dog model which has the heppa filter and electric floor brush.  I use the hand-held turbo brush most often which is not electric and works amazingly.  I probably could have saved money by going with a cheaper model.  Also, the bags are crazy.  I don't know how they do it, but they last forever without affecting performance (my model has an airflow meter to tell you when to change the bag).  If you do decide to go with this brand feel free to PM me.

I stayed and walked her with her new owners and chatted.  Just being around them helped reinforce that she is better off where she is now.  As I was about to leave, she jumped on me and did a dog hug around my leg, which made me damn near lose it in front of the new owners.  I ended up losing it as I left and walked to the car. Now I sit in this quiet, empty apartment, sad as hell but relieved that she is with great and patient people.  She has another dog who is about her age to play with and cats who pique her interest.    She will never be bored for sure.  Plus her new owners are the best people.

Offer to walk their dogs a few nights a week, or to dogsit if they ever go away. Maybe that will make you feel worse, but it would let you still see that dog once in a while. Last year my gf and I moved across the country and had to live with my parents for a while, and my brother just got a dog when we did. I was unemployed for ~5 months and that dog became our best bud. We have since moved out but we still try to see him as much as possible, even if it's just for an hour or a night of dogsitting. Maybe you can work out a similar arrangement.

She adopted Acorn and it is a perfect match.  She goes to work with my friend and just snoozes all day.   I put off getting my dog for years.... I work long hours, it isn't fair to a dog, I don't own a home.... all the excuses until finally, lonely won.  I got my dog and he has brought so much joy to my life.

dogs,3digjv,twistedLucidity,6,Thu Jul 16 23:53:02 2015 UTC,I know this is about dogs but I recently had to do something like that with the cat I've had for years. I got my first dog and the cat was super into her. She even initiated spoon-fests with the dog (whether the dog liked it not lol). The issue came with my second dog. He has a high prey drive and can't relax in front of the cat. He never touched her and didn't seem like he wanted to hurt her but he definitely could not relax and wouldn't let her out of his sight. I tried lots of things to alleviate the issue but it just never helped him (cat was still pretty ok with dogs). I was living in a high stress home for the dog. Eventually an old roommate of mine who had lived with me and this cat offered to take her in. She has always loved my cat and I knew she'd be an only cat who was spoiled to no end. I know I did the right thing by my cat but it broke my heart.

Hopefully at some future point you'll be in a position to get a furry-buddy again (I didn't get my first dog until I was in my 40s due to reasons).  Is there a local shelter where you can volunteer to walk dogs etc? A good way to get the doggy fix and help prepare dogs for their new home. Something you appear to be a dab hand at.  edit: When I was working alone at home, I found that (and I'm not making this up) a hamster was a big help in the company department. They only live a couple of years and are largely nocturnal, so will be up and about when you get home. Maybe not the most interactive of pets, but they do have personalities and they are happy to see you. Well, happy for the treats anyway. Easy enough to care for; hamster-safe food, water, clean cage, toys, ball, done.  What about ham or other similar creature to push back the solitude?"

dogs,3dmex1,justTexasthings,6,Fri Jul 17 13:27:12 2015 UTC,"Please don't use the crate as punishment. Your dog should like her crate, and putting her in there to punish her defeats that purpose.  You have a young puppy, and it's totally normal for puppies that age to not have fully developed bite inhibition. You kinda have to help it along. If she bites, stop playing with her. Stand up and/or fold your arms so she can't get to your hands. If she still tries to bite at you, walk away to another room and shut the door behind you. Wait about 10-20 seconds, then return to playing. The idea is to teach her that if she bites, playtime stops for a little while. You will probably have to go through this process quite a bit a first. Bite inhibition isn't something that develops in one day.  But it is worthwhile to stick with the training for the long-term benefits, especially since you have young kids.  Also, if you're not already, please make sure that all play time between your dog and your kids is supervised by an adult. It will be a lot easier to get the biting under control if you teach your kids to stop playing with her when she bites."
dogs,3dmex1,Kaedylee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:41:36 2015 UTC,"Ok thank you, I wasn't sure if I should practice the time out method by putting her in the cage or a separate room."
dogs,3dmex1,Hermago,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:45:34 2015 UTC,It's generally best for the timeout to be you moving out of reach.
dogs,3dmex1,LittleToast,6,Sun Jul 19 01:45:50 2015 UTC,"Like the other posters have said, nipping and biting is totally normal puppy behaviour. It's definitely best for everyone to ensure the puppy and toddlers are never interacting unsupervised - it only takes a second for things to go wrong and for them to get a real bite, or for the small puppy to be accidentally injured.   In addition to the stop play method of bite inhibition training, you can also try yelping in pain. It doesn't work for all dogs, as sometimes they mistake it for play, but it does work for some. When my dog was a puppy, when he bit you just yelped like a puppy in pain, and he would soften his bite until you weren't yelping any more. He was just trying to play, and I was telling him that he was hurting me, so he would pull back until he wasn't hurting anymore. He was particularly sensitive to us so this method worked really well for us. It's something you can try to see if she's responsive to it.  The thing about bite inhibition is that it's good training to teach her to always have a soft mouth when she's playing with humans, because it'll also keep her mouth soft for taking treats or toys from you or your sons. Bite inhibition can take months - and can regress when she's teething anywhere between 5 and 7 months old, but she'll get there. It just takes patience, time, and consistency.   Don't think of it as bad behaviour that needs to be punished - she's just a baby and is learning how to play with humans. After all, she grew up with other puppies who play the same way! Puppies explore the world with their mouths the way toddlers do with their mouth and their hands. She'll learn to stop with some gentle guidance from her new human family."
dogs,3dmex1,WOOFCheCazzo,3,Fri Jul 17 14:20:54 2015 UTC,"Firstly the crate should never be a place of punishment for a puppy that young. I didn't use the crate as ""punishment"" until my dog was a year and a half old and that was more along the lines of ""You're really worked up please go calm down in bed"". You want the crate to be a safe happy place. Look into crate training and start working on it.  Secondly breaking the biting habit isn't going to be super quick. You'll want to likely keep the two separated or watch every interaction they have very closely. The second she bites pick your son up and walk away. Don't look at the puppy, talk to her, or anything. Make yourself look as unconcerned as possible. In a minute or two you can come back and play again. Do it every single time and have any one who plays with her do the same. She'll start to learn that any time she bites it means playtime stops and she doesn't get any more attention.  The same method can be used for jumping by the way."

dogs,3dmex1,danceswithronin,2,Fri Jul 17 14:06:58 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't let two year-old boys play with a two month-old puppy. That's just too young - I suggest keeping them totally separated for now. They could accidentally hurt her, or vice versa. Toddlers fall down all the time and if one of your kids trips and lands on your puppy, it could easily crush and kill her. They also don't understand how petting the dog wrong or grabbing her wrong can accidentally injure her. And your pup doesn't have enough bite inhibition at this age to not bite your kids.   Honestly, my best advice is to keep them totally separated for about a year, until the boys are older and the dog has moved out of her teething/mouthing stage. Use baby gates."
dogs,3dl0nf,bellaurex,4,Fri Jul 17 03:11:21 2015 UTC,"Consider asking in r/askvet  Secondly, have you considered starting her on a joint supplement? Dasuquin and Cosequin are fantastic and fairly inexpensive if you do a little shopping online. The bottles last a medium sized dog for a long time, and if your dog is less than 60 pounds you can even buy the ""large"" dog size and give 1/2 tablet to make a bottle even more cost effective for you. If those are still too expensive, you can look into ""human"" glucosamine/chondroitin and fish oil supplements.  Allergies... have you tried an OTC antihistamine, like benadryl? Benadryl is generally best when used preventatively to keep the itching from getting worse; it may not work too well once the dog is already so itchy they're chewing and scratching themselves raw. At that point, a vet visit may be in order to take care of the allergies and any secondary skin issues that may be a result of the scratching (steroids, antibiotics, and an antihistamine typically).  Also consider talking to your vet about starting your pup on tramadol for pain. It is a very cheap prescription medication and fairly effective.  As far as the ears are concerned, if the infection is bad enough, you really need to get to the vet for a proper diagnosis to get it under control. After the infection is under control, you can maintain it with weekly ear flushes/cleansers (ONLY use flushes with a DRYING agent... never use water or water-based cleaners in the ears!).  Bottom line, though, is to call your vet. Your vet will know your pet's medical history better than any of us and will be better suited to give you medical recommendations and OTC doses on products."

Also, we have been to the vet but finding a good bet where I live is easier said than done and they want to resort to the worst case scenario in order to make more money (surgeries, endless treatments). Thank you so much for all the help."

So please, don't assume that they're just offering you the ""worst case"" to ""make more money"". They are just giving you all of your options, which you have the right to decline.  Yeah, as I mentioned, benadryl is best used as a preventative and not as a solution once the itching is already in full force. A vet visit may be necessary to cut the problem, at which case it would be beneficial to start her on something like benadryl on a daily, long-term basis to help keep it at bay.  That subreddit will probably be your best bet for medical advice."

She's young, but she has joint problems.   Our vet told us we could also try human omega 3. He recommended a dosage based on her size. Check with your vet for the proper dosage for you. He told us to open the capsule and sprinkle it on her food. We opted against that because they are way too fragrant.   Someone on another post told me about dog physical therapy for her condition.

She's lived a long, fulfilled, happy life, and she probably knows it's close to her time. Animals are good at sensing things like that.

I was less than a foot away taking photos, and when we were done I packed it all up. My dogs were in no danger of eating a plastic Easter egg. It was absolutely ridiculous the amount of vitriol and hate I received for my one post.  People are getting more and more paranoid about things that are so insignificant, or they forget that people know their dogs. Artemis ate like three raisins once before I was able to shoo her away.

People do seem to overreact to a lot of little things when it comes to dogs theses days.   Katz owned a dog (Orson) who had behavioral issues. Rather than get him the help he needed, he put him down and wrote a book about it.   At one point he bought a dog from a pet store because it was more convenient than looking at shelter dogs. He also had decided that shelter dogs were not suited for families.   I don't outright hate the man (I have friends who do), but I do think he's a mixed bag. In the article I linked, I am in agreement. In the years that I've owned dogs my dogs have eaten all kinds of crap that according to some people should have killed them. Not only didn't it, they ate it with no medical intervention, and were fine.   I used to teach my dogs to catch food (a useful trick for obedience), by using raisins. I never, ever, ever had a sick dog. Ever. Yet now I am told that a single raisin might make my dogs sick or kill them.   My dogs have eaten chocolate chips that have fallen on the floor. They were fine. My first dog ate 12 chocolate chip cookies that were cooling on the dining room table. She was fine. My youngest dog grabbed a cookie sheet of cookie dough as a young dog and ate 6 chocolate chip cookies. He was fine.   The one who ate the 12 chocolate chip cookies? Yeah she also ate an entire chocolate fudge cake containing 4 squares of Baker's chocolate and a half cup of cocoa. She was also fine.   My dogs eat leftover lasagna, pot roast, chicken paprikas...all of this has onions in it.   I don't think I'm especially ""lucky"" in all of this. I think that maybe there are some dogs who can't eat a single raisin. But I also think many dogs are just fine having some raisins or chocolate chips that manage to go their way. But there are people who refuse to believe this and think that I should have rushed my dogs to the ER to have their stomach pumped and be put on supportive hydration.   If someone feels that a single raisin may kill their dog, that's their decision. But fearing that single raisin, and dragging a dog in for invasive surgery due to a single raisin, is just crazy.   BTW the whole raisin thing seems to trace to one dog who ate half a container of raisins  and subsequently died. From that one incident, an entire mindset of thinking that one raisin will kill a dog, seems to have arose."

The raisins did freak me out because she ate like a whole pound cake with raisins in it, and everything online was like 'ONE RAISIN=DEATH"" so we did induce vomiting. But she was fine after that.   I just didn't know the authors background.  I would say putting down a dog with behavioral problems is a tough  call.

Second, any time we're at home or the park or the like, she does get to be ""a normal dog"". She wrestles with her brother (she's your typical bratty little sister), chases other dogs at the park, and loves a good game of tug or fetch.

However, when it's a problem is when humans are causing it such as in the case of black rhinos. We caused domestic dogs to exist in the first place, which has been bad for the environment anyway.   Also, dogs are the same species as wolves, so it wouldn't really be a species going extinct anyway. It would be one subspecies."
dogs,3dhvt0,Derecha,3,Thu Jul 16 17:57:30 2015 UTC,"So, here's some interesting data. The ASPCA reports that 1.2 million dogs are euthanized annually. There are several sources saying 2800 pit bulls are euthanized daily - that's 1,022,000 a year.   By this math, it would serve to reason that having a huge advocacy program to spay/neuter pit bulls (and their dopplegangers) would dramatically decrease the number of dogs ending up in shelters. I am NOT saying mandatory S/N because that shit almost never works.   If PETA wanted to put its money where its mouth is (and they never do), they would spend time and money promoting free spay/neuter clinics for pits/pit-look-alikes."

dogs,3dhvt0,crlast86,4,Fri Jul 17 11:00:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's hard not to agree with them when I see puppy mills, MILLIONS of dogs being killed because there's not enough space, how badly most people take care of their dogs, etc. Maybe it would have been better if we hadn't domesticated dogs in the first place since it has caused so much suffering and death.   Can you point out a cite for those millions of dogs being killed due to a lack of space? In many parts of the US, shelters don't PTS dogs. They'll ship them to another part of the country, or hold them, but they don't euthanize them as a matter of course. They will PTS the ones that are deemed unacceptable, but I don't see what choice they have.  If we had never domesticated dogs, we'd be some sort of not all that evolved ape. Dogs allowed us to advance as a species. Dogs helped us in all of our work, as we became more and more human. Even today, many people would be unable to do their job, if they didn't have a dog.    I'd say for every dog that has a loving and happy home, there are two with a tragic story.   You can say that, but it's not based on anything. Is it? Are there actual numbers on that, or is that part of the ""owning a pet is evil"" mantra?   They want to spay and neuter all pets and let the institution end naturally, not kill or set free existing pets.   But owning dogs is not ""an institution"". It's part of what makes us human. I would love to see how PETA sees the jobs that dogs do, being done by not-dogs."

Service dogs, therapy dogs, search and rescue dogs, bomb detection dogs, law enforcement apprehension K9s- I can go on...

You can't give them to pet homes because EVERYONE would want them. People would start bringing dogs in from overseas. You really expect law enforcement to punish people for owning dogs? Do you see how completely unreasonable this is now? Can you see why no logical person respects PETA when they spout this nonsensical shit? Just.. Use your brain. You have one for a reason.

dogs,3dhvt0,crlast86,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:48:35 2015 UTC,"You're forgetting that millions of dogs are also imported from overseas and Central/South America every year. Those dogs often end up in shelters because they're free-ranging dogs that have no concept of how to behave or function in an indoor home setting. They also bring in diseases that can infect our population of dogs. Just look at the canine influenza out break in the Midwest. The only reason it's and issue at all is because it's a strain of the virus that's never been seen on this continent. It's been traced to a group of dogs that were imported from Vietnam.  You also don't really hear about all the dogs that live good lives. Only the worst make the news. There was no news story about my dad's friends hunting dogs. They lived in kennels, that were indoor/outdoor, with heat & AC, and were rotated through the house. Not a single one of his dogs ever had a sniffle without a vet coming out to see the whole pack. Every scrape was treated & cleaned immediately. You'll never see good homes like those. But you'll see the guy that leaves his dogs in filthy kennels and might feed them once a week. I highly doubt that there are 2 tragic stories for every happy home. Just because the home isn't your picture of ideal doesn't mean that the dog isn't happy & loved.  They want to sterilize an entire population in order to kill them off slowly. Hmm, that doesn't sound familiar at all. Isn't that what the eugenics program in the US was intended for? Offering sterilization to young women of color & rewarding mothers who bore light skinned children. I'm pretty sure that was the plan. They painted a nice picture for the people at the time too.   Your last point is also wrong given the evidence that shows they've taken pets from porches and killed them before the family gets home. They have a 2% live exit rate at their ""shelter"" Most of what enters leaves in a bag. So they do want to kill existing pets. They tell their employees that ""death is better than handing them over to someone who my abuse them"""

Thankfully our society is more understanding when dogs don't turn out the way their breed dictates, CKC and AKCs' horrendous influence is waning and people are giving less of a shit in regards to their draconian standards of ""perfection"", in the past a ducking hunting dog afraid of water and mud might sadly have been culled, just like German Sheppard's would if they failed their courage test at 6 months.

dogs,3dl5rs,Miirr,13,Fri Jul 17 03:58:55 2015 UTC,"I don't fault you in the least for wanting to return him. You need a dog that can work with you, not just a pet, and you would have to spend a lot of time untraining these issues... Not to mention SD training. I do not think he is a good fit for your needs.  Even among service dogs bred for the work and trained by organizations, washout rate is high. You need to start with the best foundation possible and this dog just doesn't have it. It would be different if you just wanted a pet and his issues were minor but that's not the case. He sounds like an attractive dog so I would be surprised if he was in the shelter very long."
dogs,3dl5rs,therobbo91,3,Fri Jul 17 04:25:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and something that really tipped me off was 'He's really well trained but his owners didn't care about him'.  Service dog training is strenuous, if he has all these issues he isn't really well trained, and he would need a LOT of remedial work before he could even attempt to be a service dog, much less actually achieve that status."
dogs,3dl5rs,sincerely-sacha,2,Fri Jul 17 20:49:41 2015 UTC,"Here's an album of him, and he's gorgeous, but the main reason I think they talked him up was because he was in the shelter for 3 months. Which I think is pretty long considering every husky was out of there right when they were available.  The shelter also talked really negatively about their return policies stating that it's an ""awful thing"" that does happen. That on top of the fact that I thought I was sure, considering how the sheltered talked about him, that he'd be good."
dogs,3dl5rs,Orthriophis,6,Fri Jul 17 04:33:05 2015 UTC,"With a service dog prospect, you really don't want a dog that has to be rehabilitated first.  Huskies tend to not be the greatest for service work either due to their general lack of biddability (there are exceptions of course, but that's quite unusual).  A dog that growls and snaps at other people isn't going to be functional as a service dog.  They need to be rock solid when it comes to people acting inappropriately towards them.  He's gorgeous, but when it comes to a SD prospect, you've got to stack the deck in your favor as much as you can."
dogs,3dl5rs,scs453,3,Fri Jul 17 15:32:29 2015 UTC,"He may never be a service dog. He might be a trained happy dog one day, but the training for service dogs is quite intensive. If you can't have that, perhaps the better option is getting a trained service dog, instead of training one yourself. That's not a bad thing, and there can be a happy home for this puppy if that's what you decide.   There's a few things to keep in mind. Adopted dogs aren't going to really settle into their new home for a few months. You're going to have to give him some time to show you his true colors. To compound that, you have a mix of really high energy, smart, independent breeds. At his age, he is going to be at the peek of his need for mental and physical exercise. A lot of bad behaviors come from being frustrated from lack of stimulation, which may not help a newly adopted puppy.   I also think you probably need a dog behaviorist instead of a trainer, and training tools. A behaviorist will actually be able to help with the socialization issues. Keep in mind that fundamentally changing how the dog feels about dogs, and how he instinctively reacts isn't a quick thing to train. It can take years for him to turn around. For right now, you might want to consider a basket muzzle. That will protect your dog from unwanted attention because it's a sign for dogs and people to steer clear, and it will protect from a bite if it gets that far.   At the end of the day, if you want to keep this dog you will be managing your dog in public every time you go out, which is sort of the opposite of what a service dog would do. It's totally ok to decide that you aren't going to be able to invest that much time into a dog because it doesn't fit your needs."
dogs,3dl5rs,settersrclowns,2,Fri Jul 17 16:28:59 2015 UTC,"Well, he is a very beautiful dog so I see why people want to pet him while ignoring your requests not to. Those assholes aside, how much experience do you have with dogs? He's going to need some training to get through his issues. It's great you have time for him but without getting some full time help training him (and you) neither of you is going to be happy. I'd set aside plans for service dog training. He needs to learn how to be a dog and you need to learn with him so your anxiety doesn't affect his behavior on the other end of the leash. If you can find and afford someone to work with start there.  You make it sound like the shelter pushed this dog on you a little bit. If that's the case that's really unfortunate. Most shelters try to make a good fit for their dogs and have a return policy in case that doesn't happen. If the dog ends up being more than you can handle don't feel guilty about returning him. In the long run you need to do what's best for you and the dog."

I agree with the other posters, you have every right to return him if his issues are too much for you to handle. Sometimes things just don't work out and you shouldn't feel bad about it.  Instead of returning him to the shelter, could you find a rescue to take him? Try posting in /r/LosAngeles, there might be someone there who knows a rescue who works with dogs like him. I also live in LA and volunteer at a small dog rescue, I can ask the other volunteers/kennel owner if you'd like."

It never seemed to distress Deacon at all so we never brought it up to the vet. He lived a long and happy life, but why the globes of his eyes moved slightly in their sockets when chewing remained an unsolved mystery."

dogs,3dl748,settersrclowns,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:33:56 2015 UTC,I bet you could post that video saying what's wrong with my dog and nobody would catch anything about her eyes. I watched it twice and still don't see anything abnormal. We spend so much time looking at our dogs and them looking at us that it's probably a thing only you will ever notice. Doesn't mean you can't come up with a nickname for her when she does it :)
dogs,3dknh1,-comment-,11,Fri Jul 17 01:13:07 2015 UTC,"I'd return the dog to the shelter and opt for a cat-tested dog in the future. Huskies are a high-prey drive breed and typically cannot be trusted around cats, I've meet many huskies who have chased, injured or killed cats."
dogs,3dknh1,unclear_outcome,2,Fri Jul 17 01:31:21 2015 UTC,"I think I may have no choice, the kid loves the cat and vice versa so I can't break that up. Is it possible that my cat may not like any dog I get though? Not saying it's the cats fault in this case but for future reference."
dogs,3dknh1,court67,7,Fri Jul 17 01:39:24 2015 UTC,"The cat isn't really the problem here, it's more the breed of dog you got. You need to return the dog and find one that has either been cat tested or has very low prey drive. Cats not liking dogs is manageable. In my experience, they swat at the dog a few times, and the dog learns to stay away from them. A large dog not liking the cat, though, is a recipe for a dead cat. Big difference."
dogs,3dknh1,thestraightarrow,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:47:46 2015 UTC,"My two cats HATE my dog, but my dog LOVES the cats. If they cats don't like he dog they will just avoid it and you don't really have to worry about anyone getting hurt beyond an inquisitive puppy or new dog getting scratched for getting too close. However if the dog doesn't like the cat I'd be really worried. My friend came home to find her cat torn to pieces by the 3 hound dogs that got out of their confined area and the animals had even all grown up together."
dogs,3dknh1,MrMutani,6,Fri Jul 17 14:02:16 2015 UTC,"I had a similar situation recently (and with a husky mix). He was said to be good with cats, but flew off the handle when he met ours.  It all depends on how much time you can devote to introducing them to each other. The ASPCA has a guide that involves slow leashed introductions and lots of praise for calm behavior: http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/virtual-pet-behaviorist/cat-behavior/introducing-your-cat-new-dog  Or, if you're like me and also have a toddler to contend with, it may be smart to return/rehome the dog before anyone gets too attached. We had a behaviorist come over after a couple days and she determined it would take a lot more work and time than we could afford.  I hope it works out for you!"

At this point I think that even if I did try to make them connect they wouldnt, either the dog wouldn't like it or the car wouldn't. So I'm thinking I may have to take her back which I hate because I think they will think I am a crappy owner but I know it's best."
dogs,3dknh1,barkingfree,7,Fri Jul 17 01:37:46 2015 UTC,Any good shelter won't think you a bad pet owner because you brought the dog back in a timely manor due to a issue regarding a preexisting pet. If they make you feel bad then they are in the wrong.
dogs,3dkl4y,3kool5you,3,Fri Jul 17 00:52:59 2015 UTC,"Okay, as a vet here are some things to make sure your dog is on: 1. Fluids (I'm guessing you meant SQ and not IV, as you can't give IV at home...are you giving them under his skin? He may actually need IV at the hospital for both the pancreatitis and kidney disease. We want to flush those kidneys). 2. Antibiotic shots shouldn't hurt (where as oral will cause GI upset), but may not even be necessary. Most pancreatitis is NOT infectious, unless it's necrotizing. If there's a UTI you'll want appropriate antibiotics based on a culture and susceptibility test. 3. Pain medication: Pancreatitis HURTS. You're going to want something like oral tramadol or buprenorphine injections. 4. Anti-nausea medication like Cerenia. Comes in a shot form that lasts for 24 hours, and also oral form. Also has anti-inflammatory effects. I really like this drug. 5. Pepcid/famotidine antacid - good for the pancreatitis and kidney disease uremia  Maybe your pup isn't eating because he's so nauseated. Pancreatitis and kidney disease are both very serious and require aggressive care."
dogs,3dkl4y,LeBluff,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:28:44 2015 UTC,"I just want to thank you so much for this response.   I think I did mean a SQ...all I know is it's a little bag that we fill with water(and saline) and we inject that in to him until all the fluids are in him, usually a 10-15 minute process. The antibiotic shots don't seem to be an issue and we have those so that's good. He has tramadol pain meds that we've been giving him but we try not to overdo it on the pain meds. This one is really huge. We(and our vet) believe he isn't eating because of the severe nausea, and we do have an anti-nausea pill but he refuses to take it and spits it out. I wasn't aware there was an injectable way which would be so much better, I have to check if that's an option. Haven't tried this at all but might be worth getting a pill shooter and launching it down his throat I guess.   I really appreciate this advice, I'm gonna look at every tipped you mentioned and see if we can bring this guy back from the edge of death"
dogs,3dkl4y,LeBluff,2,Fri Jul 17 01:48:27 2015 UTC,"Pancreatitis is painful. I wouldn't worry about overdoing the pain meds. Tramadol is usually dosed at 1-2 mg/lbs every 8-12 hours as needed. Cerenia is a wonderful anti-nausea medication and anti-inflammatory. I use it for a TON of conditions. I hope your vet has it! The injectable form can be given under the skin. It stings, so I usually give it after giving SQ fluids. There's also injectable famotidine that can be given under the skin.  Good luck! I hope your pup makes a turn around."
dogs,3dkl4y,read_u_to_filth,2,Fri Jul 17 02:01:55 2015 UTC,"Absolutely get the Cerenia!!! Do the injectable until your kiddo is feeling better and then try the pill. Our boy Keegan had kidney failure and this med was the only thing that helped on his really bad days. Once we got the tummy issues under control he would eat. Do whatever you have to do to help your baby eat. Some nights I sat on the kitchen floor while he ate, and when he got really sick, I fed him with a syringe as he laid in bed. As someone who has been in your shoes, I can tell you this, your dog will tell you when it's time. This is really painful and you will second guess yourself no matter what you decide. If you just pay attention to your dog, you'll always know what the right thing is. You are in my thoughts tonight. Give that baby a kiss from an Internet stranger. Thank you for being caring and strong dog parents.  Edit: Forgot the most important part, Keegan lasted 18 months longer than his doctor expected with treatment. If you have great Vets, Vet Techs, and you fight for your kid, they will fight with you."

dogs,3djkm1,nervousaboutnewdog,4,Thu Jul 16 20:05:05 2015 UTC,"It just takes time. She will eventually learn to relax outside the crate. She is probably still stressed out about being in a new environment. If she likes being pet or rubbed, try sitting on the ground with her and petting or massaging her to calm her down.  You may want to try hand feeding her to get her to pay more attention to you as well as more bonding."
dogs,3djkm1,BlueBG82,5,Thu Jul 16 20:20:05 2015 UTC,I think you need to wear her out to the point where she does exhibit calm behaviors at home. Think like take a very very long walk on the weekend and don't head home until she looks worn out.   Generally speaking this a good way to get a calm dog anyway and you may need to repeat this exercise a few times in the first few days but it should eventually work.
dogs,3djkm1,nkdeck07,3,Thu Jul 16 20:10:51 2015 UTC,"I agree! OP, physically tucker your pet out (within reason) so she IS tired out of the crate. Puppies are suckers for naps, especially when they're sufficiently exercised. Once you start seeing calm behaviors, start marking and rewarding them via this."
dogs,3djkm1,rhiles,2,Thu Jul 16 20:41:10 2015 UTC,"One thing that would be helpful down the road is to teach her a ""place"" command, although this wouldn't probably happen yet given that you've just gotten her. The place can be a dog bed, cot, yoga mat, towel, etc. I use a Coolaroo cot. If it's elevated, it's easier to distinguish boundaries when she's in the learning process. If I want my dog to relax and hang out but not be confined to the crate, I'll put him on his place board, and he naps while I watch TV or work around the house or whatever. Most dogs pick it up pretty quickly, especially if you're using a place board or cot."
dogs,3djkm1,tiredmaligator,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:56:10 2015 UTC,"When I adopted my dog, she would constantly go back in her crate. We just left the door open so she could go in and out as she wanted. We kept her water and food outside of her crate so she would be more inclined to venture out. It was her safe spot and we let her have that.   All that being said, she warmed up to us and started coming out without a lure after a little less than a week."

The plans are thoughtfully designed so that the dog has to do difficult tasks balanced by easier tasks. It has helped out my shelter dog immensely.

dogs,3dle5t,AdamCordelle,5,Fri Jul 17 05:26:17 2015 UTC,"Puppy socials are awesome, meeting family and friends who you know aren't around non-vaccinated dogs is great until the pup is fully vaccinated. Once fully vaccinated doggy daycare is an excellent place for socializing (as long as the daycare is a responsible one) and as an added bonus will give you a very tired pup.  Even just in 1-2 hour spurts at a time.  Introduce the pup to everything you can think of. Skateboards, umbrellas, wheelchairs, everything imaginable so that weird fears don't crop up, though they still can.   Start gently pulling on ears, the tail, playing with the paws. Constantly rewarding so that the dog isn't overly bothered by it. Be warned though, a pestered dog even with all the prodding training can still bite if pushed enough (child yanking on an ear constantly).  If you want a dog that loves people and other dogs make sure you get a breed that fits that.  Just some pointers I've learned over the last few months!"
dogs,3dle5t,Amerlan,3,Fri Jul 17 05:38:08 2015 UTC,"Here's a link that helped me to read over: ""Rethinking Puppy Socialization"". I'm sure you'll get some wonderful advice here but personally now that my dog is nearly 15 months, looking back I had a bit of a faux pas in how I socialized her. According to the article, I let her get away with murder in the name of socialization, and now I'm working so very, very hard to get some better footing when it comes to how to greet with (more or less) good manners. Friendly, super confident puppy mauling everyone for love is cute. Adolescent dog doing the same- not so much. Remember: everything is a training opportunity! Good luck with your future pup!"
dogs,3dle5t,leanlikeaxolo,2,Fri Jul 17 13:16:08 2015 UTC,"I'll preface this by saying... puppies are a LOT of work. Really really think hard about getting one + doing grad school. I'd say i'm about 90% sure you should not do that. But... people rarely listen to strangers advice on the internet.  Purchase the book ""7 days to a perfect puppy"" and read that thoroughly (grad school eh... we already know you can do a simple puppy book).  Also purchase something that looks good from Karen Pryor (clicker training pioneer). I would also recommend picking up a book from Patricia McConnell and Ian Dunbar.  Then for videos you have Kikopup on youtube who has a LOAD of ""do this right away with puppies"" videos.  If you do all of the above you should have a really solid foundation ready to go and a very well behaved doggy a year later"
dogs,3dle5t,OrvilleTurtle,2,Fri Jul 17 06:58:56 2015 UTC,"Besides what others have said about training/classes/puppy playtime take her everywhere with you. Structure your social/free time around going places he/she can go with you. The more you expose your puppy to the better. We have taken ours to outdoor cafes, beer gardens, parades, outdoor concerts or anything else dog appropriate with people/kids around. Going in the car to go to a drive thru teller at the bank? Take the dog. People love pups. You'll meet a lot of people and it's great for your pup."

If anybody wanted to pet them, I let them. They got used to many different smells, and people. Once they were fully vaccinated, I would take them to the dog parks, and let them romp around, and play with the other puppies. It's basically just a matter of getting them used to seeing many different people, and dogs or cats."
dogs,3dle5t,ninjaturtletackle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:28:56 2015 UTC,"When socializing a puppy it's the quality of the experience that counts not the quantity.   You don't have to make your puppy meet every person or every dog it comes across, but try to make sure every encounter the pup has with somebody or with another dog is always a good one or ends on a good note.   Let the pup experience strange noises, walk over new textures and obstacles like sewer grates, being among crowds of people and the rush of heavy traffic, being groomed and handled in odd and slightly awkward ways, etc."
dogs,3dle5t,eddasong,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:24:32 2015 UTC,"Puppy kindergarden classes are great, the pups are all at a similar rate in terms of development and age, they're all about the same place in terms of vaccines, different breeds and sizes and the supervision of a trainer who will call the shots and keep the peace. You just sit and watch cute puppies roll around with each other, it's awesome.  I also recommend finding some dog-friendly families or people you know, and regularly visiting a few times a week. Pup gets used to cars, and is in a safe environment to meet people and other animals and get out of the house."

dogs,3dk7se,molly9945,7,Thu Jul 16 22:58:58 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to the Irish Wolfhound or what it would/wouldn't do with alpacas.   However, alpacas are not defensive creatures. They don't fight predators, they run like hell. When they are confined to a pen or small field, you remove their ability to run away as a defense. Predators depend on your area, but never under estimate the damage someone's loose dog can do. Many many dogs have a chase instinct, and once animals start running, they can go crashing into fences where they break legs or necks (depending on your fence and how they hit), they can get torn up by a dog who is grabbing at them, and so on.   If you're going to get alpacas, look into a guardian breed like a Great Pyr or an Anatolian Shepherd. They will defend your livestock again predators and stray dogs alike."

I wouldn't say it's a no but it will take some work and training for the two animals to be comfortable around one another.     That said, what about Wolfhounds appeals to you?

And when I wake up to him staring at me with his face inches from mine as he realizes I'm awake I think it's just pure excitement knowing that I'm up.  I think that so long as a dog loves you they don't judge you. You're their favorite thing in the whole world. As far they're concerned you fart rainbows and make the sun rise. They probably can't find any fault in you so long as they adore you and you don't abuse or neglect them. That's just how dogs are. They love unconditionally."

dogs,3dkiub,HeySawah,5,Fri Jul 17 00:32:23 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you're enjoying the sub! Ever since I started browsing a few years ago I have learned more about dogs than I ever knew was out there.   You're definitely not alone in how you feel. I want a second dog very badly but for a lot of reasons it's not the right time, and probably won't be until my current dog is gone (she's almost 3, so I have a long time to wait). Sometimes too much research can end up hurting, because you get so attached to the idea of the dog that you don't even have.  Sometimes the best thing you can do for yourself and your future dog is to wait. Something that might help is making a dog fund to slowly add money to, or buy a new dog-related book every once in a while (or go to the library! Mine has been an awesome resource), or watch some training videos to feel like you're progressing somehow. Your history with dogs may not be the best but it doesn't sound like you personally caused any of those things to happen.    our lease says no   As a renter this would stop me in my tracks. You've got the property manager on your side now, but what if someone else takes over that job? Or he says it but doesn't actually give written permission, then tries to take it back later? Eviction can follow you and make your life pretty difficult, so I wouldn't take the risk unless you get written consent to violate that portion of the lease. You never want to have to choose between your dog and a place to live.  Depression can make dog ownership very rewarding and also very difficult. I thought getting a puppy would ""help""... having my current dog helps, but having her as a puppy stressed me out and probably exacerbated my problems for a while. Everyone's different, though. Do you see a therapist? I found that regular exercise or even something like gardening helped a lot with depression. Anything that felt like an accomplishment, even if it was just taking a walk or planting seeds, was helpful to me."

The obvious solution would be back to the crate, even for short errands. Then, once he earns your trust back, he's allowed out in a dog-proofed room. If he proves himself worthy, add in some cheap distractions (like a dollar store pillow or something) and see if he takes the bait. If so, back to either a dog proofed room or the crate.   I'm going through this with my dog right now too. From about 16-20 months he was excellent when left out of his crate! Occasionally he would shred paper if I left it on my desk or something, but no real destruction. However, just before his second birthday, he took to destroying fluffy things for no good reason. After 3 new pillows and a new comforter, he was back in his crate every time I left the house. This week we started leaving him out in my room with no temptations- all pillows and blankets were locked in my closet. He's doing well so eventually he'll earn more privileges, but I'm done paying hundreds of dollars to replace items he's destroyed. This is one of those issues you manage with restricted access to the environment and plenty of exercise."
dogs,3dk6lv,court67,2,Thu Jul 16 23:55:47 2015 UTC,"He is going to be 11 months on Saturday, so he definitely has that puppy energy which I'm sure is a factor. When my guest was over we made sure to bring him with us on our excursions if possible and when he couldn't come he stayed with another dog (and tore stuff up then). The troubling thing about the crate is that he has actually broken the side twice to get out and damage whatever he can reach in the room. I may have to get a new crate entriely and see if he can't break out if it."
dogs,3dk6lv,court67,3,Fri Jul 17 00:46:14 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, his age totally explains it. He's at a very frustrating stage, haha. What kind of crate do you have?"
dogs,3dk6lv,court67,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:47:13 2015 UTC,This one. With the mesh it is definitely on the weak end but because we travel with Boston so often and this folds my husband insisted on it but it worked for months. It seems we'll have to suck it up and get a more standard crate.
dogs,3dgii2,nervousaboutnewdog,93,Thu Jul 16 02:20:33 2015 UTC,"I cried the first few nights I had my dog because I thought about all the work and responsibility I forced on myself and I felt like I wouldn't be able to care for the dog the way he deserved to be cared for.  Anxiety, regret, terror, and the like are completely normal and are a valid response to such a sudden life change, even one that you were previously excited and felt prepared for.    I would give yourself the full 30 days.  It takes 2 weeks to start a habit; coincidentally, 2 weeks is the time a new, fairly confident dog usually starts to show its personality and get more comfortable in the house. The first 2 weeks are a warming-up period for both of you.  The next week is the first glimpse of a real long-term life with that dog."

She curled up in the back seat and I instantly imagined us spending the next 15 years together. She was 2 years old but it felt like we had been together our whole lives. Smooth as that. My second dog came to us as a sweet, goofy 8 month old puppy. For probably 2 months he did not feel like mine. I couldn't imagine him with me forever. Nothing was wrong with him, just me. He was supposed to be my dog but because of my work schedule he was bonding with my partner instead. But I did what I was supposed to do (puppy classes, lots of adventures together, bonding time) and I can't explain it but one day he suddenly felt like mine and I just looked at him and said ""You're mine forever, kid"" and now I can imagine us together for the next 15 years and imagining it any other way is painful. So I'm not saying you have to keep the dog, I'm just saying these feelings are not abnormal and not a sign you made a bad choice."

It took a couple months and a lot of bonding moments, but now he's my most wonderful guy and I love him more than almost anyone."
dogs,3dgii2,AnPocha,32,Thu Jul 16 09:34:59 2015 UTC,"Give yourself the trial period, it's there for a reason.  When I got my dog, as a puppy, I remember curling up in a ball in my towel fresh out of the shower on the bath mat and weeping because I had just made the worst mistake of my life. My husband found me pathetically shivering and crying on the floor like a blubbering idiot.  And you know what? It's okay. They say it takes 21 days to make a habit, so until that point all it feels like is that your life has been turned upside down. You have a new friend who you desperately thought was going to be your best friend, but in truth you're practically strangers, and it's not the way you thought it would be.  Well, I'm here to tell you that 7 months later, I have the bestest dog in the whole wide world and he means everything to me. It just takes time, and shared experiences, for it to become a habit and to integrate the dog into your life.  Spend some time sharing experiences together, and learning about her and her preferences. Give yourself that 30 days, and don't be too stressed out. This is normal."
dogs,3dgii2,sincerely-sacha,29,Thu Jul 16 02:33:01 2015 UTC,Give yourself the 30 trial period. It's totally normal to feel off put. It's a huge change and commitment.
dogs,3dgii2,BlueBG82,9,Thu Jul 16 02:23:40 2015 UTC,"I recently got a puppy. My first dog and I are still going strong. She's been with me through some seriously dark times including an emotionally abusive relationship, divorce and even a double lung transplant! No puppy could ever live up to our history in just a moment, they just can't.   The other day I was sitting there with him on my lap with him sleepily looking up at me and I felt ""You really are my puppy."" He knew the moment we met but I expected the fire works I felt when I saw my girl for the first time.   Everyone, people and dogs, are different. Every situation will be different. I fostered many dogs over a ~10 year period and counseled many families in this exact position. Sometimes we fall madly in love the moment we meet, some times it's a slowly budding friendship, just like with people we love. Just because we don't fall head over heels for a dog doesn't mean in a week or month or six months we won't be.   Bonding can take time."
dogs,3dgii2,SaltyBabe,10,Thu Jul 16 05:48:57 2015 UTC,I definitely regretted my dog for the first week. Now he's just one of the family. Give her some time to grow on you; she's been through a lot!

dogs,3dgii2,nkdeck07,6,Thu Jul 16 03:17:36 2015 UTC,"Everyone here that's said this is normal is spot on. We have had many dogs, and each time I have felt this way. Guess what! I have always gotten over it (perhaps in different lengths of time) and I love every dog I have or have ever had very much! Totally par for the course of any commitment, in my opinion.   You are going to be a good owner and you are going to love your pup - your taking the time to worry about this makes me say that pretty confidently."
dogs,3dgii2,Cayterri,5,Thu Jul 16 05:34:41 2015 UTC,"I went through something similar with the last dog I rescued. Though I had promised him I wouldn't give up, I truly wondered at first if I could possibly love him as much as my previous dogs.   The good news is that after a few weeks of us both adjusting, something clicked. The quirks that had initially threw me off became charming. I began to learn his behavioral patterns and personality. It didn't happen right away, but everything came together to make me realize he's such a great little dog, and my life would be so empty without him.  It isn't unusual, and you're not a bad dog owner for feeling this way. My best advice is to keep an open mind and give her until the end of the trial period before you return her."

dogs,3dgii2,Houndie,6,Thu Jul 16 11:02:01 2015 UTC,"This feeling is actually really common. When I first got my dog back in February, the first thing I did a search for in this subreddit was ""new dog adoption regret"". When you first get the dog suddenly it dawns on you that you're now responsible for this life in your hands and that you have lost some of the freedom you once had that you're not going to get back for like another 15 years. And meanwhile dog doesn't know who you are or where it is or when it's going back home. It often takes a month or two before you start settling into each other and you start feeling a bond towards your dog and vice versa. And after another five months you won't be able to imagine how you ever lived a day without your dog."
dogs,3dgii2,Cyberus,5,Thu Jul 16 11:22:54 2015 UTC,"When I was 5, my mom promised we'd get a dog... and two weeks later I was told by a doctor I had such a bad allergy to dust that I was borderline asthmatic, and I wasn't allowed to have any fluffy pets for a few years while I got shots.  Needless to say, when I moved out on my own and had a stable schedule, I was beyond excited.  After trying to find a shelter dog that met all the criteria I had (imposed both by myself, and the apartment I live in), I finally learned about the basenji breed.    My Basenji was my first dog ever (Mistake #1... some breeds are just difficult, and Basenji is one of them, but I'd never get another breed going forward!).  He is a generally well behaved retired show dog, and had just turned 3 a few weeks before I got him.  Within the first 24 hours, he had shit and pissed inside multiple times (including twice on my bed comforter), chewed up the hanging blinds, AND BIT ME (110% my fault... he was nervous and I cornered and lunged at him - Mistake #2 - trying to put a leash on him to take him out).  Not only was I regretting it... I was even a little scared of him (yep, a fat 27 year old man was afraid of a 27lb dog).  He wouldn't even let me come within 10 feet of him without sprinting away, and refused to approach me even if I offered food/treats.  He wouldn't touch his dinner unless I stayed in another room.  I gave him more respect (and space) and let him warm up to me at his own speed.  Needless to say, when I treated him properly, we began to bond.  Within 30 days (the breeder would take him back no questions asked with a full refund), you could only take him over my cold, dead body.  Now, I can't imagine life without Pono, or his new ... sister? ... Portia, and both of them are thoroughly attached to me.  Getting a dog is a learning experience, but I genuinely believe it's an enriching one for both you and the dog.  Just remember to treat them with respect; they are NOT a fuzzy toy for you to play with when you want and then ignore... they have needs, both physical and emotional that must be met as well.  Obligatory album."

Like I said before, I have the time, resources, and work-ethic for owning a dog, but now that I have this little bundle of fur staring me in the face I'm just not sure if the 'dog lifestyle' is what I really want to put those elements towards. I'm a uni student, and I have a shit-ton of spare time even during the school year which is why I say I have the time for owning a dog, but the older I get and the more stuff I read about companies like Google, Tesla, SpaceX, the more I think that I want to put my drive towards building a strong future for myself, career-wise. Putting the work in to get the kind of forward-thinking progressive jobs I'm looking at is a lifestyle in itself, and I don't know if I can be as productive as I'll need to be while devoting 3+ hours per day to the dog, which is what they need.  ""3 hours a day"" sounds a lot more flexible when you're reading it online as opposed to when it's staring at your face. I feel really shitty for not thinking about this whole aspect of it too."

It's like the most relaxing and easy thing to do in life, just follow the three steps to good dog ownership: 1) give 'em food 2) give 'em a place to sleep 3) walk him. That's it! Are you going to sleep 6 hours a day then study/work for Google/Tesla/SpaceX the other 18? NO! Just use your dog to unwind, walk him 30 minutes and free your mind, relax with your furry friend, then go back home and start working again with a fresh mind! Look, your dog probably just sat in a kennel alone all day, now she's with you, that's a huge improvement for her. So stop making things so hard for yourself, you're already improving her life just by being with her! Now give her something to eat and you're in a sudden the best guy she's ever met! Dogs are so easy to please it's ridiculous, society and consumerism put pressure on dog owners ""You HAVE to walk her 3 hours!"" ""You HAVE to give her premium kibbles"" ""You HAVE to buy his new toy or she'll hate you!"" BS! Just relax, take a deep breath and stop thinking, just enjoy the presence of your dog as she enjoys yours, and you'll be fine. EDIT:typos"

Don't think of it as ""at 5pm Dog Time beings and at 8pm Dog Time ends,"" it's little things here and there, like filling up the water bowl for a few seconds, or maybe 10 minutes of play or a 30 minute walk.  I would be very surprised if I actively spent 3 hours a day on my adult dog, because she's so relaxed and calm.  Likely at first you will have to spend that time getting to know the dog, getting it adjusted to their new environment, and bonding, but as time goes on that wont be something you need to do every day. Meeting a dog is like meeting a person, we have a lot of expectations and hopes, and then when we meet them we see all the rest of it too.  Just like meeting a person, you have to give it some time.  Don't just immediately return it because the bond didn't happen instantly, work at it, spend time with the dog, and it will come. One interesting thing I read is that prolonged eye-contact with familiar dogs releases Oxytocin for both parties link, once your dog feels comfortable around you enough to start making eye contact, hold it.  That will help both of you bond together.  Don't force it, though, as that can make the dog nervous."

Not like you need to be 100% focused on the dog and doing nothing else. Going to take out the rubbish? ""Come on, Rover""...amble to bin...amble back...""Sit, Rover! Good boy"". Well...there was a minute of training.  Where you do need to devote time is training (err...15 mins a day is plenty) and then walking (0.5-2 hours depending on the dog and not in one block; we do 3 walks a day, often doubling them up with errands). What? 2 hours walking? OMG! Well, it's good for you too. Drop an audiobook/podcast on the phone and off you go. More fun than going to the gym.  And when your 20th prototype for the world's first transwarp generator blows up, demolishing a £400million research facility...know who's going to be there to give you a cuddle and love you because you are the best damned thing on the planet from their point of view?

If you're trying to forge a relationship with another being, you need to invest in it by finding opportunities to cooperate and discover each other, find your likes/dislikes and whether you react well to each other and the environment.

We were in a 2 week foster-to-own agreement with the rescue and I spent the first week an emotional, panicked mess.  We only had her for a few hours and suddenly I was having a manic breakdown with uncontrollable crying.  I couldn't explain it.  I was having the most terrible guilt I've ever felt because I thought we had made a mistake and I was contemplating giving her back.  It actually made it worse that she was so fucking cute.  I spent an hour on the phone with my mom, another hour on the phone with my sister, both of whom were talking me off the ledge.  My girlfriend spent that whole week reassuring me it was going to be okay.  After a week of this, I was in a good place.  Ironically, my girlfriend spent the second week just like I had spent the first.  My mom and sister then talked her off the ledge too.  We had a complete role reversal.  It's a big change.  You tend not to think about the actual intensity of the responsibility beforehand and you have no choice but to think of it once the dog is actually yours.  It's overwhelming, terrifying, anxiety-ridden, emotional.  I think the fact that we had 2 weeks to return her made it worse.  The option of giving her back was there and forced us to not fully accept the responsibility.  It totally fucked with our heads and our emotions.  Long story short, we kept her.  Neither of us can imagine our lives without her.  All of my worries at the time have figured themselves out, just like everyone had promised they would.  It's also kind of crazy to recognize how much love we've developed for her over the past year and a half.  In the beginning I wondered if I'd ever love her like I've loved past dogs.  Now, I love her more than that.  She's my best friend.  Stick with it.  You're a bit freaked out right now, but it's normal and you aren't alone.  We've all gone through it.  This animal is going to love you unconditionally and you'll love her back just the same."
dogs,3dgii2,bayareanative,2,Thu Jul 16 12:27:06 2015 UTC,"The first 3-4 weeks after we got our dog was hell. I was constantly tired and bickering with my fiancée to the point where tears were an almost daily thing. I even said, ""At what point do we think about giving her back?"". My fiancée was much more the dog person, but felt like he couldn't connect to Nibbler. And it wasn't really her fault- very similar to your dog it sounds like. She had a very solid foundation of training and was fairly well behaved.   And then one day (it was a Thursday), things kind of clicked. She started feeling like less of a burden and more like something I couldn't wait to come home and see. She mellowed out a bit once we got her into a solid routine and my fiancée couldn't ever believe he felt animosity to the dog.   Like other posters have said, give yourself the full 30 days. If it doesn't work out, you gave it your best shot. Good luck, OP!!"
dogs,3dgii2,a6000,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:38:55 2015 UTC,That happened to me too when I first got my very own dog. its normal since its a big change. you feel like missing out on stuff because now you have to take care of someone. you feel like maybe you might not be able to train him or something. now you have RESPONSIBILITY!  but after a while I got use to my dog and got another one. The unconditional love it will show you will help in bonding with your dog.  At the moment dont think much of it. I guess to make it easier do what is best for the dog NOW. not tomorrow not yesterday but what is going on right now.

dogs,3dgii2,twistedLucidity,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:51:43 2015 UTC,"So...what's the actual problem here? You've explained that you were excited, you rescued a dog, and you can return it should things work out; you've not really said what the problem actually is. Do you not like the dog? Is the responsibility too much? Are you flummoxed on how to train her? Overwhelmed with demands for play? Angry you can't just go out and drink with friends on a whim?  If it's any consolation, when we got the first dog it was really weird for the first week. Here was this thing wandering about the house of its own accord.  I liked him, but it still felt weird. I'd say it took about a month to really settle and for us all to bond."
dogs,3dgii2,butter_and_bacon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:09:29 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you haven't bonded with the dog, which is pretty normal. It took me a couple of months to bond with my female when we got her, and she was at that insanely cute puppy phase. I just remember thinking she didn't have much of a personality and that I couldn't get a good read on her. Also, she had some annoying habits.   It was the same with my boy dog, too. It took a few months before the warm and fuzzies settled in and I felt like he and I had a bond. But it did happen.  I think you should give it time. Try playing with your dog more, or cuddling in bed to get some oxytocin going. Just be patient. Meeting a new dog is like meeting a new human. Sometimes you hit it off right away, sometimes it's more of a slow building up."
dogs,3dgii2,campbell8512,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:42:48 2015 UTC,I think that your over thinking this whole thing. I'm glad you are super responsible and thought about everything. Take her out in the yard and play with her. Get all Covered in slobber. Go take her to a creek and get all wet. Dogs take some responsibility but I feel like you're over thinking the fun out of it. Your probably a little behind on the bond because you didn't get to see those cute little 3 month old puppy eyes. Your gonna be best buds so you gotta go do some best bud stuff. Know what I'm sayin

However, for the first few months is periodically have a, ""what the fuck was I thinking? I can hardly take care of myself! I'm such a bad dog mom!"" moment. I think it's normal. Taking on a pet can be a HUGE life change, so it's normal to have an adjustment period."

I was in the process of moving and between that and getting a new dog (who was about 1.5 years old and had lived at a shelter her whole life) it took about 2-3 weeks to settle in and figure out what it took to make Peggy happy and get into a routine. I think its absolutely normal to feel like an unfit pet parent. At one point I did think of giving her up, which I would never do now. It was during a time that I was working a lot and continuing my education at college. I didn't feel that she was getting the time she deserved with me or outside of her kennel. I think it's normal to go through a transition period. If after a few month, I would seek advice from the shelter as to how to proceed. I know the shelter I got Peggy from said if I ever wished to give her up, I'd have to return her to them. Best of luck. Hope it works out!!"
dogs,3dgii2,almightyshadowchan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:14:39 2015 UTC,"When I adopted my boy Tyskie, it took me like four months to even begin to bond with him. I was overwhelmed and completely convinced I'd made a mistake. (To be fair, I DID make a mistake, but that's a story for another time.) All I could think about was how much I wanted to bring my pup back to the shelter.  But I didn't. Every day, I'd play the role of the Best, Most Lovingest Dog Owner Ever, even though I didn't feel it. And then one day, several months down the road, I was laying in bed after a shitty day when Tyskie came over and just gave me this look. And I realized that I was actually truly in love with him.  He's been my best buddy ever since.   So give yourself and your pup some time. It's a new relationship for you both, you two have to build a foundation and get established with each other just like in any new human relationship. And faking it till you make it never hurts :)"

She was super sweet at the shelter and embedded up being extremely defensive of me, and it made walks very difficult.  Give yourself time to bond with the dog, it's a process. If you can and are comfortable with it, find things to do that are fun the dog. Look for a nice dog park or dog beach, or a place to go for a hike. My dog is fairly independent but acts super close to me after we share a fun activity. It might help you bond faster."

It is a huge commitment and if you are an intelligent person who truly understands what it means, then it is scary. Only an idiot who thinks dogs are just cute little snuggle buddies with no responsibility wouldn't have apprehension. So that reasonable fear mixed with uncertainty with your first pet of your own can certainly make you feel this way. Plus it can take time to really bond. Try taking her to a dog park. I found that seeing how happy my dog got melted my heart towards her. So did seeing how happy she would be to be around me when I would be gone for some time. The unconditional love made it impossible not to love her back.  I'm just saying, don't be discouraged if it takes time to bond. I think it is pretty normal, and it don't make you a bad doggie parent."

dogs,3dgii2,yarr_be_my_password,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:36:57 2015 UTC,"Jeez, it honestly frightens me a little bit how people would curl into a ball and cry because they got a dog and it was too much work and responsibility.   Never happened to me, but you have to account for the time dogs live and willing to accommodate small or big things in your life devoted to keep it. The bond isn't instantly there, sometimes it's actually lost despite initial strong bond.  I have two German Shepherds, one of which I left back in my home country with my mom. Vandog was instantly mine the moment I picked him up and he curled himself into a ball in the backpack I was carrying. I gotten him during a period I had more free time so I could raise him. I watched him grow, taught him everything, played with him, spent hours with him and loved him. At the end of a particular relationship, I'd brush off my ex to spend time going through back alleys and jumping park benches with my dog. But over time Vandog stayed the same, he didn't 'grow up' to fit me better and was perfectly content being aloof rather than become a more independent, confident dog despite all the hours of bonding and training we spent together. He was my life and he didn't really seem to care, he started to resemble my mom more. I grew more disconnected from him over following months and before I traveled I took him to the park one last time. I told him to jump up a ledge to be at my level and I hugged him. I hugged him hard and tight for minutes, and I cried onto his chest. Vandog was never the kind of dog to stay quiet and trapped for too long but he just stayed there.  When I said my goodbyes, I couldn't even face him. I tried to make it seem less traumatic for him, like I was gone on a long vacation. I broke down on the elevator, with all my belongings in hand and once again a few weeks later now at my new country of residence. I was showing photos of him to a friend and I can't explain it, it just poured out.   I must have stayed half an hour crying into my girlfriends lap, because I missed him but I knew he'd be better off staying at my mom's who's now alone and needs his company. He was also not the dog for me, no matter how much I love him - You see he's too aloof and puppylike, and I can't count the times I'd facepalm over his behavior. It was exhausting to give him guidance and correcting him all the time. He still sleeps by the door, waiting for me to come back and it will break my heart when I'm back home for a couple weeks next month to leave him again but now I have Ares.  Ares shares some traits with Vandog, and I honestly felt difficulty bonding with him as fast. Only after a few weeks did I love the shit out of that puppy.   Vandog is still my dog and hopefully one day we can join the two 'brothers' if I get the chance to move back to my country, but I share a different bond with Ares. Vandog while much sweeter and sticky gradually lost his bond with me while strong headed, independent and freaking stubborn Ares gains a stronger one every day."
dogs,3dgii2,VividLotus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:46:02 2015 UTC,"It's normal to feel anxiety/regret after the fact when you've made any big decision. And I think it's also normal to not necessarily bond intensely with a new dog right away. Frankly, I think it's also normal to love one of your dogs more than the other, or to have different feelings toward your different pets. I love one of my dogs like a child; I fell instantly in love with him the moment I saw his picture on the rescue's site, and there is nothing in the world I care about more than him. I love him more than any other animal or human I've ever known. I care about my other dog a lot, and I want her to be healthy and happy and to have a fun life, but my feelings about her just aren't the same as how I feel about my other dog. I don't think there's anything wrong or unusual about that.  If I were in your shoes, I wouldn't even consider returning the dog at this point. I'd only do that if there was a serious reason as to why it was a bad idea for that dog to be in your household, e.g. there was an aggression issue between your two dogs. Rather, I'd just try to accept the fact that it may take time to really bond with a new dog, and/or that some people just don't have the insanely head-over-heels in love feeling with every dog they have."
dogs,3dgii2,becomingk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:56:09 2015 UTC,"The first night I brought my dog home, I couldn't fall asleep for hours because I had this horrible, what-have-I-done feeling right in the pit of my stomach. Here was this furry thing that was now 100% dependent on ME, wanted to spend time with ME, and was still a little traumatized from the shelter.   It took me about 1-2 weeks to really warm up to Charlie. Actually, we didn't even name him for at least a week since we weren't sure if we were going to keep him.   I think some of your anxiety has to do with being young and having a lot of big possibilities and changes ahead of you. Maybe you will get a new job with long hours. I live close to SpaceX and let me tell you, those guys (and gals!) work incredibly hard. But they're also paid very well. If you wind up getting a job like that, you could definitely afford a dog walker/doggy daycare to give your pup some fun while you're cranking the wheel for 10+ hours.   Or, who knows.. by then you might have a roommate or a girlfriend who loves your pup and has a more flexible schedule. You never know. Granted, you shouldn't count on all the chips falling into place but where there's a will, there's a way.  Take some deep breaths. If you're worrying about this, it means you're a thoughtful guy who wants to do the best by this dog. I think you absolutely can, regardless of what life throws at you in the next few years."

I went to a local adoption event and got the new dog kind of on a whim and I felt a pit in my stomach when I brought him home. One month in, we're nearly inseparable. It took him a couple weeks to show his full affection and goofiness. I think this was a better choice since his shelter was overcrowded and the international rescue I was looking at seems okay and I'm sure the dog will go to a nice home.

dogs,3dj3va,YellowLadyBugs,6,Thu Jul 16 18:04:21 2015 UTC,"The Manchester cross is resource guarding. You need to teach him that people coming near your husband is a good thing. Right now he's worried he's going to be removed from your husband which is bad in his mind. Have your husband work on hopping on his lap and off on command. Use lots of treats for training this. Look into resource guarding as well. Resource guarding is also the issue with the food aggression.  Growling is most definitely a warning. Be sure to never ever punish the dog for growling. In fact, when he growls you need to move away, evaluate the situation, figure out the problem, and figure out how to fix it and make him feel better about it. Do not punish him. Teach him whatever he's growling about is actually a good thing.  Is that walk in the evening all they get? If so then more exercise would be beneficial to both."

dogs,3dj3va,barkingfree,5,Thu Jul 16 21:58:45 2015 UTC,"Today the Pom bit my nephew. No warning. Just growled and snapped. he could have done a lot of damage. But it appears that there is just bruising.   There was warning, the growl is the warning. It's the human equivalent of ""back off, I don't like that.""  A lot of dogs don't like kids, my dog is awesome with most people, but kids make her nervous when they run around her and yell. Even if they're not really doing anything antagonistic, kids move and act differently than adults. If you were paying attention to his body language right before the bite, I'm assuming he was growing uncomfortable with the petting, and the growl was his warning to cut it out.  Your dog isn't at the critical point of having to rehome or euthanize yet, but what might help is looking into a professional behaviorist in your area. If your dogs have any excess energy, it might be good to get in more exercise. 25 minutes a day isn't a lot for a dog, maybe you could do two walks per day instead of one?"
dogs,3dj1zf,rastapasta9,3,Thu Jul 16 17:51:03 2015 UTC,"Lots of training. First, get a baby gate or tie her to a chair or something if you think she'll jump the gate and make sure your guests know to not even look at her until she calms down and lays down. No looking, talking to her, or petting. When she calms down then they can calmly approach her or talk to her. If she starts going insane again have them ignore her again.  It may also help to have a kong prestuffed to give her when she calms down rather than letting people go talk to her. That'll help teach her that staying calm is more rewarding. If she freaks out no one pays attention. If she calms down she gets to munch on a really yummy kong.  Then build your way up to being out while people are around. Let her out when she's calm and if she starts freaking out put her back behind the gate until she calms down. It's probably going to be a slow process but stick with it. Invite people over and let them know you want to work on training while you hang out and explain they don't have to do anything but hang out and not pay attention to the dog."

Other issues to look out for that might warrant a vet visit when coupled with low urination: If your dog's pee schedule is suddenly drastically different (Used to need to pee all the time, now only twice a day or vice versa), stops drinking water or starts drinking excessively, vomiting or diarrhea. None of those? You're just lucky and your dog doesn't need to go that often."

If he medically checks out okay, I would talk to a behaviorist about his behavior. Its hard to say without seeing him/the behavior what exactly the issue may be."
dogs,3djq01,BlueBG82,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:54:40 2015 UTC,"When he growls, is he lying somewhere and are you walking up to pet him? Or is it randomly when he's already near you? Dogs can resource guard ""space"" or even their bodies in addition to food and toys. The dog my family had when I was a kid would do this.. he'd be lying down somewhere, and he'd get the half-moon look in his eyes and start growling if we came too close / made eye contact. Since your dog only starts growling when you pet him, and only once a day/intermittently, he might be just sending you a message that he doesn't want to be touched at the moment. Basically, leave me alone, I don't want your hands on me right now.  If you have the extra funds, making an appt with a behaviorist (not a trainer) is a good idea. Also having the vet making sure there's nothing physically wrong. But since he's never tried to bite or bared his teeth or anything, it doesn't seem like an emergency issue, so if it's something you can't afford right now, I wouldn't worry yourself sick over it."

When a dog is feeling aroused, pretty much anything will do, be it a female dog (a dog will happily mate with his own blood relatives, he doesn't know any better), a stuffed animal, or a person. Your options to stop it, as recommended by others, are ignore or redirect. I tend to have more luck with redirect, but it depends on the dog.   We don't plan on getting him fixed because later on down the road we want him and another husky to have puppies   The world has so, so, so many unwanted huskies. Go to petfinder.com and look at how many huskies are filling up shelters and needing homes. Unless you get health clearances, have an excellent pedigree, and show and title your dog, please do not breed him.   Edited to add: I realize this isn't related to your question, so I hope I don't come off as rude, but I peeked through your post history and it looks like you brought home a 5.5 week old husky puppy from a breeder who sent the pup home way too early and who promised (but apparently didn't deliver) on providing her ""papers"" to the Continental Kennel Club, which is basically a scam registry. It looks like you got your female puppy with the intent to breed her to your male, saying:   I know some people won't like that I'm wanting to breed them. It's natural for two dogs to breed. I don't plan on becoming a breeder, but I will let them breed when I think she can handle it.   You've also asked if it's okay to breed two dogs together who have the same sire. If you breed your male, even once, you are a breeder. You very well might be contributing to the epidemic of unwanted pets because the world is not short on cheap huskies. Breeding should always be a very, very serious endeavor done by people who have worked intensely with their breed of choice for years. It should not be a casual thing and the puppies suffer for it if it is."

dogs,3dl5ns,Pablois4,6,Fri Jul 17 11:54:15 2015 UTC,"The change in household can definitely cause this behavior.  Basically you have two options for humping: ignore or redirect. In my experience both work, just depends on the dog.  Ignore is pretty easy. He starts humping, just get up and remove yourself from his presence.  Redirect is where you have perform a trick or another task such as sit or lay down, and then reward him fro the behavior that stopped the humping.  As a side note unless your Husky is a stellar example of his breed in both form and function and passed all health clearances, as well as knowing his family history for inheritable problems like epilepsy he should not be bred, and should be neutered and kept as a beloved family pet."
dogs,3dl5ns,homehealthgirl,2,Fri Jul 17 04:01:59 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the advice. I think we will do the redirect with him cause he hates being alone. I will start getting him to do tricks when he starts to hump!
dogs,3dl5ns,DietHoney,2,Fri Jul 17 04:27:57 2015 UTC,"To add to my comments on /r/husky, humping isn't necessarily a sexual thing.  When my dog was 1, my sister moved away for a bit and took his playmate with her. My dog was lonely, and when he'd play with me it would often lead to him getting amped up and humping me. In my experience ""play humping"" happens quite a bit between dogs. It might be he just misses having someone to play with, and you're filling that spot.  This article talks a bit about play humping. /u/homehealthgirl's suggestions are an excellent way of teaching him it's not okay.  Sorry about the loss of your young girl. That's a hard thing to cope with-- for humans and dogs."
dogs,3dl5ns,notevenapro,2,Fri Jul 17 05:15:37 2015 UTC,I am not trying to be mean but you should really fix your dog. There are tons of huskies that need homes. Please do not add to the problem just so yrou dog can have puppies. Your dog has no concept of having puppies its just a nature thing.
dogs,3dl5ns,treacledormouse,2,Fri Jul 17 14:32:56 2015 UTC,Please don't backyard breed huskies. There are enough of them out there as it is. Unless your dog is a proven worker or a champion show dog there is no reason you should be breeding him.   By the way someone registered a table with the Continental Kennel Club. That alone tells you how legitimate they are.  If he does that again you should ignore him and put him somewhere to calm down/time out (i.e. crate)

dogs,3djk6u,Kid_sasquatch,6,Thu Jul 16 20:01:59 2015 UTC,"I've had two, and grew up with a third that wasn't really mine.  They're fucking smart. They can also be very stubborn. If you're not very experienced with training dogs, that can be a bad combination for you. They can and will try to outsmart you if it benefits them.   Examples from last week:  He knows that if he barks at the door, I will get up to see who is there. He also knows he's not supposed to steal food off the counter. His solution for that was to bark at the door, wait for me to go check, then steal my food off the counter. It happened three times before I realized what he was doing.  Shedding is bad. It honestly doesn't even matter how much you brush them, you'll still have dog hair everywhere. I try to brush mine daily, and I still find hair constantly.  Many gsds have very sensitive stomachs, so be careful about the food you buy.   To say they have high energy is an understatement. The show lines are calmer, but i've always had working lines. He can chase the ball outside at a full sprint for over an hour, then he'll come inside to take a 30min break before he's ready to play again. Walks are not considered exercise, they are just entertainment. Unless you're hiking many miles, a simple walk will not tire a gsd out.  On a more positive note, they're typically very easy to train. I got my first gsd as a 8 month old pup, and it took him about 30 minutes to learn his name, sit, down, and stand. By the next day, he had mastered them perfectly. Stay and recall took a little more work, but not challenging at all.   They are very loyal, and protective. Sometimes too protective. My current dog absolutely does not like any other dog near me. He started a fight a the dog park the other day when a friendly lab jumped on me. We're working on that but I don't think we'll be going to the park any time soon. Luckily I separated them before the lab was hurt. So that may be an issue. If I knew the problem was that bad I wouldn't have taken him to the park at all. He loves other dogs in any other situation.  A gsd will quickly become your best friend, following you everywhere. Mine will not sleep if I'm not sleeping too. It's actually kind of funny to watch, his eyes get so heavy but he forces himself awake everytime he dozes off. Then as soon as I leave the room he's up and alert again, following me to the next room. My other gsd was like that too. But as soon as I go to bed for the night, he'll pass the fuck out.   Separation anxiety was/is an issue for both of them. I'm not sure if it's especially common in gsds, but both of mine had/have it. Crate training is essential so they don't hurt themselves.   Like I've said already, they're smart. They analyze everything. Sometimes my last dog would sit outside and just watch the birds and planes go by. Learning how to open doors is not very challenging for them, so be careful with that. My current dog recently figured out how to open the fridge.... My last dog figured out my outfits. He knew that I was leaving when I would put my scrubs on (he'd act really sad.. Then go lay in his crate) , he knew we were going for a walk if I was wearing shorts (he'd get his leash from the closet), and he knew we were going to the pet store or park if I was wearing jeans (he'd go straight to the car after we walked outside)."
dogs,3djk6u,S_M2,2,Thu Jul 16 20:49:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for this! Exactly what I was looking for. Your dogs are adorable, and sound very smart. I am really committed to training, as I'm aware of the somewhat negative reputation GSDs have (compounded with their large and intimidating size).   But I have always wanted a GSD, and will work my hardest to adapt my lifestyle to the dog, if needed."
dogs,3djk6u,S_M2,2,Thu Jul 16 21:08:21 2015 UTC,"Haha like 90% of the time they just act like giant puppies.  My advice is that you need to stimulate them mentally as well as physically to keep them happy. Smelling games are great. Get some treats, hide them around the house, and let them go find it. Or keep teaching them new tricks. Or you can even play hide and seek.  As for physical exercise, like I said, walks are nothing for them. Dog parks are great, nothing tires out a dog better than another dog. I hope you have a big yard, or park nearby. Playing fetch is the next best thing.  Mine loved to wrestle and rough play, but you may not want to encourage that. I'm a decent sized guy with a lot of muscle, and he's still pretty challenging to play fight with. A 100lb dog coming at you from a full sprint doesn't always feel very pleasant. We both had fun though so it's alright. He knows he can only do it with me though.  Good luck :)"

How old is the dog you're interested in adopting, and do you know much about his background?  Do you rent or own a house? (since they are frequently a banned breed and hard to rent with)  /u/sugarhoneybadger adopted an adult GSD and recently got a puppy from a breeder, so she is pretty well-versed on the different experiences you can have."
dogs,3djk6u,Kaedylee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:07:04 2015 UTC,"I will be a first time dog owner as an adult, but I have friends, coworkers, and family who have adopted various breeds (a couple shepherd/FMD mixes, corgis, poms, shibas) I've interacted with them quite a bit in the past few months in preparation for one of my own.   As a kid, I grew up with a couple dogs (medium sized/mixed breeds) and my father also grew up with GSDs. So my experience as an adult is limited, but I am confident that I'm up to the challenge!  As far as the specific dog(s) I'm looking at, they are around 1-2 years  in age, and from their page descriptions, they seem to be typical GSDs who are friendly and are good with other dogs and animals. I have yet to meet either of them, but look forward to it.   I currently live in a house(not rented, but with family) and plan on buying my own house within a few years."
dogs,3djk6u,PM_Me_Annie_Drawings,4,Thu Jul 16 20:52:08 2015 UTC,"First of all, make sure you have plenty of money saved up for vet bills, especially since you're planning to adopt from a rescue. Unfortunately, GSDs have some pretty serious and common health problems. These issues tend to be even more common in irresponsibly bred dogs, and irresponsibly bred dogs are what usually show up in rescues. I'm not trying to scare you out of rescuing, there are some great advantages of going that route, but it is important to be prepared.  The best way I can describe German Shepherds is that they're great dogs IF you want your dog to be your hobby.  They're high-maintenance, need at least 1-2 hours of intense physical exercise every day plus training/mental exercise, shed like crazy, tend to be aloof towards people they don't know, and are prone to some behavioral issues. They're not a ""I want to take my dog for a 30 minute walk and then cuddle while we watch Netflix"" kind of dog.  They're a ""I want to spend hours every day training and working with my dog"" kind of dog.  If you do get a GSD, I would highly recommend looking into doing some kind of dog sport or high-level training with your dog. Herding, competitive obedience, rally, agility, and nosework are all good examples of what you can do with a GSD."
dogs,3djk6u,sugarhoneybadger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:21:40 2015 UTC,"Wow. 1-2 hours of intense physical exercise seems like a lot! I think a lot of adults would have some trouble with that on a daily basis. But then again, I guess that's why GSDs are not for everyone? =)  Thanks for the tip on possible activities!"
dogs,3djk6u,rhiles,0,Fri Jul 17 03:46:13 2015 UTC,The answer to your question: https://soundcloud.com/soundhippo/unfinished-journey thank me later
dogs,3djk6u,caffeinatedlackey,5,Fri Jul 17 03:46:44 2015 UTC,"I think rather than going to dog parks, a better way to meet responsible GSD owners who know the breed well would be to chat with your local kennel club and any training clubs near you. Especially if you have a Schutzhund group, they often have a very realistic view of the breed and will not sugarcoat things for you.   You can make a GSD work as a first dog, but you have to be flexible and above all careful about your expectations. I have two, and my first (the rescue) was a rude awakening. I had been operating under the assumption that when a rescue says another dog is ""good with other dogs,"" that it means they are generally friendly towards other dogs in normal situations. That's just not necessarily true with a guardian breed. Even with good socialization, many are so possessive and protective that certain scenarios will always throw them into a defensive posture. With my rescue, it turned out that she cannot tolerate strange dogs approaching her or me unless she is introduced to them ""properly"" and very slowly. I thought she would be a great dog to take everywhere with me and take hiking and so forth, but she turned out to be aggressive. She is totally fine with my other dog and has a few dog friends, but her anxiety level with strange dogs (and prey drive towards small dogs) makes it impossible for me to do most of the activities I planned for her. This is just to say that with a rescue, you really have no idea what you are getting, even if they say the dog is fine with other dogs and people. The other thing is that GSDs often go through emotional ""shut down"" when they are rehomed, so they will seem quiet and meek at first. It can take a month or more for them to gain confidence, and that is when many adopters start seeing problem behaviors for the first time. They get confused. ""But I thought this was a nice dog. Why are they doing this now?"" And it's often that the dog is just getting comfortable and starting to test boundaries.  With your new rescue, I would highly recommend following the two week shutdown protocol to help them acclimate to your life. I regret that I did not do this more diligently with my dog. I thought ""Oh, surely going for a walk down the street will be fine."" Yeah, it was fine until we started running into stray dogs and fence fighters and it made her anxiety worse. Bottom line is while you are getting to know the dog, keep them in environments you can control. My dog was doing fine (so I thought) but what started out as whining and panting escalated into barking, lunging, and finally biting within a month or so because I had no idea how to deal with her reactivity. I thought taking her to dog parks would help get her socialized, thinking her barking was just because she was excited and didn't know what to do. This just made everything much worse. I now understand that GSDs are not typically a dog-social breed, and that taking a new GSD to off-leash areas and dog parks is a primo stupid, newbie mistake. You might end up with a dog who is very dog social, but you need to find that out in controlled environments over a period of time. Same goes with people- don't throw a new dog into meeting a ton of your friends right away, and until you know for certain otherwise, assume the dog is wary of people. Read up on stress signals in dog body language. Many people's knowledge of stress in dogs is limited to obvious signs like a tucked tail and curled lip. But, the truth is once a dog has progressed to these signs, they have been pushed way past their limits and have probably been anxious for a long time. If you learn to read dog stress, you can keep your new dog out of situations that might be too much for them to handle while you establish the all important bond with you.  I would start talking to trainers now (not Petco trainers, real trainers who have put titles on their dogs). You will need to be in obedience classes for bonding and socialization. Anyone can call themselves a trainer, so I would look for someone who has AKC/UKC dog sport or Schutzhund titles on their dogs. There are certifications for humans as well like CPDT-KSA and so forth, but in my experience, a lot of these trainers have more theoretical knowledge than boots on the ground knowledge. Anybody can take a class to learn about animal behavior. Competing at a high level of sport takes actual skill.   My rescue dog did get better but I had to sacrifice the ideal I had about her: she's just too nervous and dog reactive to do much besides basic obedience and going for walks with me. But she is very sweet and as long as I keep her leashed I'm able to travel with her. She is very good with people.   My other dog is a higher drive GSD puppy from a breeder that I got as a working dog. He's a different animal entirely. You have to keep him engaged or contained 24/7 because his intelligence, curiosity, and independence will get him into trouble. He's bold, intense, and needs a crap ton of exercise. He's not hard to live with, but that is because I have made dog training my lifestyle. Every interaction with me and with other people is calculated: how do I build handler-focus? How do I teach him to cap drive? How do I use the Premack principle to show him that good behavior around other people and dogs is worth it? He's very social and solid tempered. But even then, he has protective instincts and will alert like crazy if someone approaches us while we're camping. He's totally fine with people in general, but you have to actively show him that people are okay in all scenarios, not just some scenarios. This has meant I need to teach him separately that a.) people touching him are okay b.) people touching me are okay c.) people entering our home and approaching my vehicle are okay because these are all separate scenarios to him. He's a fast learner, though, and generally once he has had one positive exposure it sticks. When they're puppies they're like little sponges.   My days are pretty much dominated by my dogs, and for you it will probably seem like that too, since this is your first dog and you have a huge learning curve to deal with. I typically spend about 1.5 hours with them in the morning before work, an hour at lunch, and then another hour or so after work. This is taken up by training, mostly. Neither one really needs to run for miles and miles. The breed does better if you provide them with sufficient exercise but mainly focus on mental stimulation in the form of training and games. I would highly recommend finding your dog some sort of ""job"" to do. That could be a dog sport, tracking, nosework, or trick training if that's your thing. The work ethic of both of my dogs is tremendous. They will focus on me for more than an hour at a time and really I haven't found their limits because I don't want to take that focus for granted and push them. They are very loyal and want to be with you all the time.   As others have mentioned, watch out for health problems. My rescue has food allergies and joint issues. The little one just has seasonal allergies so far and not very severe. I would read up on hip and elbow dysplasia as well as bloat (gastric torsion). Pay special attention to emergency care for bloat, as it is a common issue and knowing what to do could save your dog's life someday. Make sure you have funds set aside for emergency vet bills. It seems like everyone has at least one.  I don't like to shoot people down when they are truly enthusiastic about the breed, but these are pretty challenging dogs and you have to ask yourself whether you just want a pet, or whether you really want to become a ""dog person"" and make your dog your hobby."

dogs,3djk6u,S_M2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:50:03 2015 UTC,"Stubborn. Independent. Smart as fuck.  You should expect these when getting one. I'm on my 3rd, growing up with one and effectively making it 'my' first dog. My actual first dog was also a GSD I trained to be the biggest marshmallow at the park. He's now with my mom and she seriously just takes him to the kid park to get his exercise since the kids and parents love him.  I have a 9 month old puppy now who is the most stubborn, intelligent and challenging one I've had. He is the worst. He's affectionate when he wants, he's bonded when he wants but most of the time has this 'Who do you take me for? Leave me alone with your shenanigans' attitude and face going on. He's unbelievable, sometimes I tell my girlfriend he's either a genius or dumb. Lately I've figured out he's far far from dumb. You can never predict what they think or do, they're so stubborn and have personalities.   I've been lucky with all my GSDs who have been pretty chill and don't have a crazy drive, hell if anything they're lazy. It's very hard to keep their interest, especially with my latest dog. Nothing is very interesting for long - Oh the rubber ball that ju---- Ugh, you want me to fetch it so I have to go get it again?, Oh boy oh boy ham h---- Bleh, I don't care about treats anymore.   Sometimes it's very hard to train something with him, not that it takes long. No,no! He gets it. He gets it almost immediately. But why should he do it if I don't have anything he's very interested in?  As for exercising, I believe it's because he's a puppy but 1 hour seems quite enough for him. He runs about, chases a couple balls, chases other dogs, jumps around a bit and he's tired. Mind you he's 9 months and it's been over 30 Celsius where I live so that explains it."

dogs,3djmvd,Nothing0302,8,Thu Jul 16 20:22:20 2015 UTC,"I dislike the idea of introducing a crate to her at this stage since she is used to sleeping on the bed with us, and also because I don't think she is guarding anything. It seems like she is reacting to a perceived threat during her sleep.   If this really is a case of ""sleep startle"", crate her at night. Or at least keep the dogs in separate rooms when she sleeps. If that's truly all there is to the aggression (if there aren't underlying factors and if she literally only shows aggression after waking), then separating them during sleep literally solves your problem and keeps your other dog safe. Dogs can happily learn to be crated - if done properly, it's never cruel."
dogs,3djmvd,rhiles,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:37:19 2015 UTC,"Okay, thank you for your reply and your time! The problem is, she also rests and sleeps off and on throughout the day. So it's a very difficult thing to manage. I guess we just continue to muzzle her when we are with her and she is resting, and remove it when she's up and about. Thankfully, she doesn't mind the soft muzzle at all. She has no trouble drinking with it on. When we can't supervise, we will separate the dogs into different rooms."

Also, since this isn't a behavioral issue on his part, I feel like it would be unfair to try to get him used to it. I'm not opposed to crate training Edie, but it seems like an unrealistic option when she is sleeping off and on throughout the day. It's so unpredictable. I'm thinking about this non stop and I really appreciate the responses I have gotten.   Thank you for reading and weighing in!"
dogs,3djmvd,je_taime,2,Fri Jul 17 04:16:25 2015 UTC,"You don't have to crate him. You can keep him outside the bedroom with a baby gate, but if you want him to sleep in the same room at night, crating him is for his safety.   If this were me, I'd crate Edie at night.

I stopped leaving them in the car when I grocery shop because I think that is too long, but I used to leave them in the car all the time.  Nowadays, if I do have them and need to be in the store for a long time, I make sure to park in a parking structure.  If I cannot manage that, I take them home and then go shopping.  I really do not like to leave them in there any more than I have to and will avoid it at great length, and most of that is due to reminders that it is not advised.

Ugh, don't get me started.  I live in a hot area but love to take my pup with me when running a series of quick errands.  Hit the drive through at the bank and pharmacy, go in to pick up something specific in a store, hit the pet store w/ him then get lunch at a drive through.  This means I leave  him in the car for 10-15 minute intervals w/ the AC on and a rear window open for airflow. I keep my keys on a valet fob to make it easy and have an extra door key with me and even one hidden in a magnetic box on the car.  I still always am afraid I will come back and someone inspired by the rising awareness of dogs left in cars will try to break my window.

I'd honestly not leave a dog in a car at that temperature, with the windows closed. I don't know if you had them open or not. I'm a big believer in air circulation for dogs, since they can not sweat.   Lots of the crazy shit from people about dogs in cars is coming from PETA and their insistence that there is no safe time at all for a dog to be in a car.   I went to a trial last winter where the temperature was 3 degrees. And I crated my dogs in the car. They were fine. I've also worked out of my car when the temperature was in the low 70s. I have the hatch open, all the windows open, sun screens up and I'm under a tree. But I suspect that some people would think that that was too warm for them, even though it was cooler than being in the crating area.   One thing you may want to do: when you leave your dog in the car, set the alarm on your phone. Use common sense (unlike the ass you ran into), and if it's not cold out, maybe leave your dog for only 10-15 minutes."

I have a GSD mix and we always wait at least two hours after he has eaten to take him out to walk/run. Because of the breed's shape, their chests hold most of their organs since their hips are so narrow and if they exercise too soon after eating their stomach can flip and cause death within hours. Also wait an hour after exercize to feed them. This is stuff the breeder definitely should have told you.  I feed my boy around 7:30/8 and he always poops around 10...although he is a little older and probably more in control of that stuff..."

Smelling all the time is a typical scent hound trait, but is usually more prominent in a Beagle.  What you have is a hound mix. Make up your own name for her breed; something like ""Blackened Tail Carolina Squirrel Hound."" (I have no idea if you're from one of the Carolina's or not; just sounded good in my head.)"

If  there is even the slightest chance that s/he would be confiscated by border patrol and most likely euthanized it isn't worth it. Especially because all dogs coming into the country are supposed to come with their paperwork in order.  I live in Ontario and at least where I have lived in Waterloo and am now living in Kingston the BSL law is barely enforced. I know many pit owners who either disregard it or try to work around it by saying their dog is a different breed (even though the law states any dog that looks like or has visible characteristics of these breeds) hell I often see pits at the dog park! But it only takes one. One dick cop, one uneducated idiot, one slip up or circumstance that is out of your control and it's over. Is that really worth it?  On a side note I believe I heard a story a while back about a baseball player who signed on to the Toronto Blue Jays.  He and his family owned a pit bull out in Florida and when he moved to Toronto to play for the team he was not allowed to bring the dog. His family loved the dog so much that they opted to stay in the US with the dog while the husband/father came to Ontario."

Looking into the law it looks like they would have turned us away at the border and if we persisted could have given us a $10k fine or jail time. You can't even pass through Ontario with a pit bull. And they define pit bull as any dog that looks like a pit bull, so you won't get off on a technicality that he's not 100% pit or something."

Many of the rescues transport dogs out west to Alberta, as well as to Quebec and New Brunswick so they don't have to live under the BSW laws (I believe that's their title)  Honestly? I wouldn't do it in Ontario. There is a stigma, there is prejudice, and you have no legal defence if for some reason there's trouble. You will always have the short stick, until the law is no longer a law.

I was planning to just allow my pit to roam around in the backyard, however I can see that all it takes is one neighbor who might be looking for reason to make big deal.  However, based on the comments am I to assume that even mix breeds (Pit/Boxer) would fall under the same law if she looks like a pure pit?  Based on my research on the BSL, in Manitoba ""Any dog which has the appearance and physical characteristics"" of a pitbull would fall under the law, couldn't find something similar about Ontario."

She has no problem whatsoever getting on when we're going to the park, off on a hike, etc.--the little bugger seems to have figured out that we only load her up at 7AM if we're going to daycare (that's what I get for wanting a smart dog).

He sits before going in and out, understands wait and is pretty well behaved.    do you have another place you can take him?

dogs,3dhlkh,Twzl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:54:49 2015 UTC,"There isn't anything else on the way to work, though we would probably be willing to drive a bit to keep him in daycare.   After the first time they noticed it, they told us that they would keep him distracted before letting other dogs in/out. But I feel like they may have forgotten, or forgotten to pass that along to all of their staff? It has been a month since the first (and only other) time it was noticed with no other incidents. So I'm unsure at this point."
dogs,3dhlkh,Ashtok,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:22:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that is a fair critique. Dogs are going to try to crowd the fence when a new dogs walks in, when dogs are getting taken for feeding and when dogs are going home. There should be management to minimize it (i.e water bottles, redirection) but it is going to happen.  Some dogs just are not cut out for a daycare like that and it's okay. I've seen dogs have to go because they want to nip dogs as they are being led into the holding area gate.   I is very hard to recreate that situation at home because of the amount of dogs but possibly get a consultation with a trainer if you really want to make it work with that daycare."
dogs,3dhlkh,bostonbutthole,3,Thu Jul 16 15:12:26 2015 UTC,Okay so the gate is always where bad things are most likely to happen.  Why your daycare isn't removing all dogs from the entrance when new ones arrive is beyond me.  It can be annoying during the rush but worth it to prevent a fight.  Will they let you work with him there?  When you drop him off and pick him up he doesn't get to go through the gate without being calm.
dogs,3dhlkh,hopeless93,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:11:35 2015 UTC,"I will ask them about working with him there - I'm not sure how it would work out with all the other dogs, but it's always worth a shot!  They have a door that goes to the staging area, and then from there it goes into an area where they can open the doors for each of their size areas. He gets excited leading up to daycare, but then calms down across the lobby and is okay going through the door. When we pick him up though, we can hear him doing his excited bark and he pulls on his leash (which he never does) to come back to us. We have to ignore him so he doesn't jump all over us. They definitely don't try and calm him before bringing him to us. I wonder if we'd be able to go into that staging area to calm him before bringing him out. Though, we usually pick him up at rush time so they probably don't have time?"
dogs,3dii6d,c_tsmith,5,Thu Jul 16 15:26:05 2015 UTC,"Your FIL is completely screwing this up. Trying to figure out allergies is hard work and every time he does this it sets you back at least a few days. Crating really sucks when it's that long and for a young puppy, but I don't see an easy solution here. I'm sorry you're in this situation. Can you keep your door locked? Can you set up a small area with an x-pen and the crate in it? (I picked that graphic because of the Shiba in it) I just know how awful UTIs are and it would be rough for her to sit in her crate in her pee the entire day.   If he's this bad with dogs I definitely wouldn't want him supervising mine during the day anyway."
dogs,3dii6d,therobbo91,2,Thu Jul 16 15:41:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you for responding. It's been really frustrating and I'm considering moving out because of it (even though we can't exactly afford it), I just can't stand to see her like this. She's so tough but momma can tell when she's hurting. :( I will definitely look into the pen idea though (love the graphic)! I'll have to look online for one. Thank you again."
dogs,3dii6d,BlueBG82,3,Thu Jul 16 15:47:51 2015 UTC,"How old is she? Has the vet said anything about her vulva anatomy? Sometimes female dogs are born with what can be called a ""tucked vulva"" allowing bacteria to be trapped in the folds causing almost nonstop UTIs.  Also, food allergies are actually a lot less common than other types of allergies, (such as environmental). Have you had the chance to have her allergy tested?"
dogs,3dii6d,BlueBG82,2,Thu Jul 16 15:43:10 2015 UTC,"The vet has not said anything about her anatomy and I assume she would have noticed a tucked vulva when examining her vagina the first few visits. We have not gotten her allergy tested, can most vets do this? Do you know how much they usually are? edit: Also she's 7.5 months old"
dogs,3dii6d,BlueBG82,2,Thu Jul 16 15:50:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, vets can do the allergy testing. The cost will depend on your vet. You may also look into doing something different like hair tests (vs the typical blood test)  Recessed vulva info Most likely NSFW.."
dogs,3dii6d,ScorpTom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:59:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've actually seen this before and (from what I can tell) she doesn't seem to have it. I will look into the allergy testing, maybe then my FIL will believe me. Thanks for the advice!"
dogs,3dh8q9,Cman5115,29,Thu Jul 16 06:45:14 2015 UTC,The fee for lease breaking is almost assuredly smaller than eight months' worth of pet care.
dogs,3dh8q9,whisperingmoon,5,Thu Jul 16 10:15:56 2015 UTC,"This. Obviously you shouldn't go around breaking leases all the time but in this case, I would do it. In my experience the fee can be anywhere from $50 to one month's rent and you're looking at probably spending more than a month's rent on 8 months worth of boarding (unless you live in a crazy penthouse or something and get the dog boarded for free)."
dogs,3dh8q9,CBML50,8,Thu Jul 16 14:05:52 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming since your GF has had the place for several months without you being there, she can afford to continue doing so. Look for a month to month apartment in the area that allows dogs and live there until her lease is up and you find a place for you both to live."
dogs,3dh8q9,stormeegedon,3,Thu Jul 16 14:29:58 2015 UTC,"This, right here, is probably the most ideal solution."
dogs,3dh8q9,ninjaturtletackle,4,Thu Jul 16 15:13:30 2015 UTC,Do you have to move or can you stay until you find a dog friendly place down the road? You can always break a lease and suffer the penalties as an option. I've had dogs that have outlasted girlfriends as well so just putting that out there. Finding a long term temporary foster on short notice is going to be difficult.
dogs,3dh8q9,settersrclowns,7,Thu Jul 16 07:18:29 2015 UTC,Break the lease.
dogs,3dh8q9,MockingbirdRambler,2,Thu Jul 16 12:10:17 2015 UTC,"You could try contacting rescues to see if they have any fosterers that are able to take your dog on, explain you are willing to cover bills and you dont want to rehome the dog - but if you can't find a place it may have to come to that. (even if you will move heaven and earth to do so)  You can also check the lease and contact the landlord to see if he would be willing to let your gf out early for a fee + getting new tennants.  IF the apartment is not pet friendly, and you take the dog - how much would it cost her/you if you were kicked out by the landlord. Is there a penalty? If you had another place to live lined up it wouldnt be an issue and you get out of the lease."

Is there a penalty? If you had another place to live lined up it wouldnt be an issue and you get out of the lease.   IANAL but...I'd want to read that lease carefully before I did that. It could be that if you break the lease by doing something that is explicitly stated in the lease, you could be on the hook for the rest of the money.  When we bought a house last year, we rented an apartment. It was cheaper to do six months than month to month, and since we had no idea how long we'd be there, I took a six month lease.  And then two weeks later we found a house. And we moved two months after we had moved into our six month leased apartment.   The contract stated that if we broke the lease early for any reason we owed the balance of the lease. So with a big sigh, since I had signed the damned thing, I paid it off.   So yeah, if you sign something and it says something like ""no dogs at all"" and you bring in a dog and break the lease, their lawyers may go after you for the balance of the lease, if you don't pay it. So I'd read it really carefully before doing anything."

I can't remember exactly but I didn't think the plastic model was $70 when I looked at it.  I thought it was nearer to the price I paid for the metal x-pen.

Its' really hard to force a dog to put its feet in it.  I suspect it would work but you need train your dogs to tolerate it.

dogs,3di32e,becomingk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:53:19 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you've put a lot of thought into your options. To me, this sounds like one of those situations where you can have all the forethought in the world but you couldn't predict that your parents would need to move or that your child would require so much care. Rehoming Duke sounds like his best shot at having a stable life with a family that has time to care for him.  as /u/therobbo91 said, check Duke's adoption paperwork and see if there's a clause stating that you need to return him to where your parents got him from. If not, the people from the dog park sound like they might be a good place to start since they already know him. I'd just check to make sure they have the time to meet Duke's needs and that he gets along with their other pets, if they have any. If your dad has a personal relationship with these folks, even better-- they may be willing to send you pictures and updates.  Wishing you and your family all the best."

My dogs probably wouldnt be up for a lot of the intense play (most of my dogs are 10+ years) BUT i am hoping my sister maybe will be able to keep him if her landlord allows.

I know a lot of people who spend half their time in one place and half in another and the dogs do just fine. If your parents are driving from TX to CA so they have a car with them then it wouldn't be hard to bring the dog along. I'm not saying your situation isn't hard but it sounds like this dog has improved the quality of your fathers life and should be kept if at all possible. Honestly, your dad mirrors my dad in a lot of ways because he's not the most social of people so anything that gets him out of the house and interacting with other people is important."

dogs,3de888,Taen_Dreamweaver,29,Wed Jul 15 16:10:25 2015 UTC,"He is a catahoula lepord dog, which all of my research tells me is a poor choice for a new dog owner (which is me) and that they are extremely smart, independent, and strong willed dogs.   They are not wrong. Catahoulas are generally dogs on hard mode. They were bred to hunt hogs. They're incredibly strong AND incredibly strong-willed, so they can be difficult to train but training is imperative because there is no way you can physically overpower them.   I'm fairly routinely gone for 10 or 11 hours a day 4 or 5 days a week, and if I adopted, the dog would be alone all day.   This is too long for 99% of dogs to be home alone. You would need a dog walker every day.   I'm fairly active, and would have no problem getting him 2 or 3 miles a day of exercise, provided I can train him to not pull.   2-3 miles/day is not enough exercise for most Catahoulas. The dog will need 1-2 hours of vigorous exercise every day, or more. My parents have a neighbor with a Catahoula and it goes to a dog daycare on a farm 3-4 days a week, where it spends 6+ hours running around like a nut. Then the dog comes home and goes on a 3-5 mile walk. (On days it doesn't go to daycare that's a 3-5 mile run or bike ride; on weekends it's several hours at the dog park.)  Training this dog not to pull will likely be a very difficult, very time-consuming process, and will be impossible if the dog is not sufficiently exercised.   With your work schedule you literally do not have enough time left in your day after work, sleep, and making sure your home does not get nominated to appear on Hoarders and/or collapse on top of you to provide for this dog."
dogs,3de888,goldfish_king,16,Wed Jul 15 16:25:25 2015 UTC,"2-3 miles/day is not enough exercise for most Catahoulas. The dog will need 1-2 hours of vigorous exercise every day, or more.    Seconding this, as someone who lives in an area with a lot of Catahoulas. I have a coonhound, and Catahoulas are similar in that they were never bred to be pets, only to hunt vigorously in a wilderness environment, and they need tons of exercise. My coonhound is not yet fully grown, and she still needs about 2 hours of walking in the morning, plus an hour at the dog park where I've specifically set up a meetup with other young working breed dogs in the evening, and then usually another walk.  Catahoulas (and coonhounds!) are amazing dogs, but they are definitely not the dog for a new dog owner who is rarely home or has time constraints. I work from home with a pretty flexible schedule, and live in an area so boring that there's literally nothing else for me to do other than work and take care of my dogs, and even I kind of feel overwhelmed sometimes with my dog's exercise needs.  If I were in OP's shoes, I'd only consider this dog if I had the funds for dog daycare every day."
dogs,3de888,VividLotus,3,Wed Jul 15 17:18:23 2015 UTC,2-3 miles/day is not enough exercise for most Catahoulas.   I have two of them and i can wear them out on a single 3-4 mile run per day.

dogs,3de888,dog_face_painting,58,Wed Jul 15 16:35:25 2015 UTC,You already know this but don't adopt this dog. You don't have the time and it doesn't sound like you could handle him in the long term.  Why don't you volunteer at the shelter and spend some extra time with him? Or post about him on facebook? Post flyers? There are ways you can help this dog by giving him your time and seeing if you can help him find a home.
dogs,3de888,becomingk,8,Wed Jul 15 16:16:33 2015 UTC,Why is adopting this dog such a bad idea? Hire a dog walker or enlist a neighbor to take him out midday and you have a perfect scenario.
dogs,3de888,mmegggusta,13,Wed Jul 15 21:51:33 2015 UTC,"If the OP is gone for 10-11 hours a day (longer than the standard workday), that would mean two dog walker visits, plus a walk, run or training session in the morning and evening before and after work. It would be a massive time and financial commitment. Dog walkers, doggy daycare, training... it won't be cheap or easy.  Yes, the OP could adopt this dog and make it work. Or they could adopt this dog and not be able to meet their needs. There's no way for someone on the internet to judge. My gut reaction is that it's not a good idea."
dogs,3de888,becomingk,7,Wed Jul 15 22:01:52 2015 UTC,"Huh? Most people leave their dog alone all day for 8 hours or so, one walk for a bathroom break mid day would be fine."
dogs,3de888,drketchup,6,Wed Jul 15 23:21:45 2015 UTC,"You need to take the breed into account. This dog's been bred to be out for hours every day, being alone for that length of time would drive it crazy. At least at the shelter, there's a chance of it being adopted and getting that lifestyle. If it goes with OP, it'll spend the rest of its life being cooped up."
dogs,3de888,Petrollika,2,Thu Jul 16 00:22:42 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends. If the OP is at work for 11 hours and, hypothetically, they get stuck in traffic on the way home or want to go out for drinks with friends after work, the dog could be confined (in the house or a crate) for two 6 hour+ periods with just one 30 minute break in between."
dogs,3de888,becomingk,5,Thu Jul 16 00:04:38 2015 UTC,"The alternative being a dog that is put down because no one is willing to take him because of his energy needs?

I normally run 2 or 3 a day, there would be no problem going to 5 or 6, and I can bike for many more than that if needed. I also have a pool I could use to excercise a dog, if he's comfortable with that, and a fenced in back yard we can play in.  I was trying to say I felt that could give the dog sufficient excercise, and just picked a poor number. It's the rest of it I'm not so sure of. You folks are doing a good job of convincing me it's a bad idea. I just couldn't help but think that maybe with me is better than the kennel, and that no one else will take him here."
dogs,3de888,mmegggusta,6,Wed Jul 15 22:03:19 2015 UTC,"I think the dog can survive with a slightly less than ideal situation if it means he doesn't die.   I respectfully disagree. And the choice here is not between the OP adopting the dog and the dog being put down. If the OP decides to go the route of advertising the dog and pounding the pavement, it's possible that the dog could find a home that is better equip to handle him.  The OP might be able to exercise enough to meet this dog's needs. They didn't say how far they run/for how long. And there's still that HUGE block of time (10-11 hours) when OP is not home and would need to pay for a dog walker or doggy day care. Not just for a month, or two months, but for the rest of this dog's life.   To break it down better, the average cost for a 30 minute walk in my city is $20. Two walks/day = $40. That's $920/month (excluding weekends), or $11,040/year. Plus food. Plus obedience classes/private training sessions to reduce the leash pulling. Plus vet bills.. well, you get the picture.  Again, not saying OP couldn't adopt this dog and do fine. They could! I just personally don't think it's a good idea, financially and otherwise. It is a very big commitment and feeling sorry that a dog is sitting in a kennel is not a good enough reason to bring that dog into your home."
dogs,3de888,becomingk,4,Wed Jul 15 22:16:28 2015 UTC,"And it's extremely optimistic to think a dog can easily be placed and has months to allow OP to find a good home for the dog.   I have had dogs put down between the time that i talked with my boyfriend and the time I went back to the shelter to adopt the dog. This isn't fantasy world where a few fliers means a healthy, happy dog. What if the family OP finds has even less means to take care of the dog?"

I don't think the real issue here is the first-time owner issue; I think it's an issue of time. As others have said, they're going to need way more than 2-3 miles of walking; a 2 mile walk is what my elderly pug with arthritis and hip dysplasia tends to take. However, that doesn't necessarily mean you can't adopt him. Here is my question for you: is there a good dog daycare in your area? If so, check out their prices. Could you afford to take him there every day for the entirety of your work day? And then, could you commit to serious exercise (as in multiple hours of walking or hiking) on both weekend days? If yes, then I'd give it some serious thought. If not, then I agree with others who have suggested that you instead volunteer for the shelter and also work on publicizing this dog. There are plenty of people who enjoy an active dog and would be thrilled to get one who's already housetrained. If I wasn't already at dog capacity, that's exactly the kind of dog I'd get."

I am an experienced dog owner, and I know EXACTLY what I'm looking for.  I think it's fair to me to have a good match, and fair to the dog I choose.  If I take just any cute pup home, I may not actually like it, or it may not actually be suited for the activities I intend to do with my dog. I've lived with a dog I hated before, and it's not fair to anyone involved (not mine, no say).   There are lots of dogs out there, and you can't save them all.  Someone will save the others. There are lots of good people looking for lots of needy dogs.  I look at all kinds of fabulous or sad or adorable dogs and remind myself that that's not for me, as much as it might pull my heartstrings.  People have tried to give me dogs, but that will fill up that one place in my house for Mr. Perfect.  I am still going to rescue A DOG, just not that one.  One life saved is one life saved, is it not? No one pup is really more deserving than another.   Someone (assuming it's a low-kill shelter) will take him home. Someone has the knowledge and patience (and high fences) to love and work with this dude, train him up, give him a purpose, and show him some lovin. And if not, he'll still get meals and a yard, which for a dog, is a pretty happy situation in itself."

The trick to succeeding is being prepared for the worst case and committing 100% to making it work.  Every dog is different, even in the same breed. It sounds like you would be giving the dog a better life than it has now. Everyone on this site says 10 to 11 hours is too long to leave a dog alone, but do you know what percentage of dogs are left alone 10 to 11 hours a day? My guess is something like 90%.   If you're prepared to spend $ on a dog walker, possibly on doggie day care, and understand that you may have to put in 100% of your free time for the next year getting him trained and exercised...  All I'm saying is it's not impossible. Dogs tend to rehome better than we think they do. If he has a shot at a better life with you, and you're prepared to admit defeat if you wind up not being able to...I say do your research, and then consider adopting the dog. r/dogtraining has a lot of resources, and you're on the right track with kikopup. I'd also look into Patricia McConnell and Sophia Yin, to start. The Petfinder Adopted Dog Bible is very helpful, too.  One thing to add though: don't fall into the trap of adopting a dog because you feel sorry for it. Know what you want in a dog, and find that dog specifically. There are so many dogs in rescues, and you can't adopt every single one. Find the one that best matches your home and your lifestyle. It will give both of you the best possible life together, and really that's the best you can do.   Source: I adopted my first dog 2+ years ago. She's a cattle dog mix. I lived with her in an apartment until recently. She came to work with me the first year, but the second year she was home alone in an apartment for 10 to 11 hours a day. I had a neighbor walk her if it was going to be longer than that. She enjoys the time to rest so she can go on runs, play dates, and bike rides every day as soon as we get home. She spends all her time with us on weekends. We are those annoying people that do everything with our dog and take her everywhere and don't go if she can't come. But it is totally worth it and we knew that was a possibility going into it. What we didn't know is how much we would enjoy it."

dogs,3de888,nkdeck07,5,Wed Jul 15 17:48:06 2015 UTC,"You probably shouldn't. It's a tough breed. But just in case you do decide to, get an anti-pull harness. Instead of clipping the leash at the back like normal harnesses, it clips on the chest, so if they try to pull they get turned around.  If you really want to, maybe you can just get him one anyway and donate it to the shelter.  It was a big help in training my friend's new great dane mix not to pull."
dogs,3de888,anaovt,4,Wed Jul 15 17:59:22 2015 UTC,"Go to the kennel every day and play with him.  See if you can obtain permission to take him on longer walks, or maybe even for weekend trips to the park.  Some shelters will allow this.  Purchase a no pull harness and watch some videos on training dogs to walk well on a leash.  If you feel like at least an hour every single day at the shelter playing with this dog is a lot of time: tah-dah, you dont have enough time for a dog right now.

I have another Coworker with a Great Pyrenees that has no problem holding his pee for 11-12 hours. As far as the dog being bored for that period of time I completely understand which is why they have each other (they are best friends) and my coworkers dog also has a dog companion.

That isnt subpar dog care.   Edit: and lead to some issues.... Maybe. There's plenty of dogs who, when under stimulated, take a toy or treat and play with it. Not all dog stimulation needs to be high level and ridiculous."

dogs,3de888,miparasito,3,Thu Jul 16 00:28:51 2015 UTC,"Looking at the dilemma from a different angle: What kind of work do you do? Would it be possible to work from home part of the time? Are you in a salary position where you could theoretically cut back hours a bit? I know some jobs just are what they are, but I also know that it's easy to get sucked in to working crazy hours in an office situation. Could a dog be a good excuse/reason to justify finding a better work/life balance?  That said, this may not be the dog for you. Keep in mind you spotted him your first time going to the shelter... The sad fact is that there will always be one that pulls on your heart. :-/   I think what I would do is call some breed rescues that foster and try to get him into a better situation. Then I would start helping organizations like that with things like transportation (picking a dog up, take to vet or to foster home) and adoption events. As you get to know these groups and the dogs, you'll be in a position to find the perfect fit for you. It's much easier to tell what a dog is like when they aren't in a shelter situation.  In the meantime, realize that your brain is telling you it's time to figure out how to make life work with a dog in it. Make a plan -- whether it's a budget for a dog walker or dog daycare, taking longer lunches so you can go home to be with your pup, or whatever needs to happen."
dogs,3de888,pooncartercash,6,Thu Jul 16 04:00:57 2015 UTC,"Okay I'm going to go against the grain here and say ADOPT THAT DOG! You're clearly in love with him, and I'm assuming since you work and travel for work, that you are financially equipped to care for him.  In order to make this work, you're going to need to budget out quite a bit of money to hire help. 10 hours is too long to leave a dog alone. You'll need to hire somebody to come let him out in the middle of the day and maybe take him on a walk. If you have neighbors, that could be an inexpensive option. Hiring college students is cheap too. Budget $10-$15/day to have somebody come walk him.   As far as pet sitting, for when you leave for days at a time, most pet sitters charge between $25-75/night depending on the exercise needs.   Finally, you'll want to hire a trainer as well.  If you have the money for all that, then adopt this dog. Seriously.  EVERYBODY told me to not get a dog for years. ""You're in college, you're broke, your house isn't big enough, you don't have enough time, you won't be able to handle a high energy dog,"" etc. Well I fell in love with a dog and guess what -- I made it work! I immediately became motivated to get a better job with more money. I started saving a lot of money and living more frugally so that I have a large emergency fund if something terrible were to happen to my pup. I befriended a neighbor with a high energy dog who works from home, and I drop my dog off at her house whenever I leave for work. I take her to the park to play fetch every morning, and on a long walk or bike ride in the evening.   My dog is ridiculously healthy, happy, and well behaved.   My point with all this is, if you are willing to spend the money and do the work, I think you'd make a fantastic owner.   Edit to add that my dog pulls BAD. She was kept on a chain her whole life before I got her, so she was used to choking herself out. After 2.5 years together, she still pulls. There is a ton of stuff that we do that doesn't involve a leash though! Off-leash hiking and off-leash dog parks. Fetch. Swimming behind me in a kayak."

First, is the expense. Whenever you do decide to get a dog you should try to have a savings set aside for any vet visits, including emergencies, plus money for a dog sitter or kennel if you go away, things like that. You'll also have to be prepared to change plans, skip a vacation, and generally plan everything more since you'll have to get home to your dog. There will also be times when you think it's about time to go to bed until you realize that your dog chewed a pen on the couch (yes, this happened to me) and you need to spend the next 2 hours trying to get the ink out. I'm definitely not trying to discourage you from getting a dog, these are just some things I've found people that have never owned a dog don't think about."

I hate to say this, and I suspect that the down vote brigade will come out, but there aren't many homes that really could work for this dog.   if you're in a rural area and someone wants a dog who will maybe bark at people that come by, they might want him.  But if you are totally new to dog ownership, and have no serious hands on experience with dogs and dog training, this is a dog who is just not suited for your life.   You're gone all day. If you are gone 11 hours a day, I doubt you have the free time to exercise and seriously train this dog.   The fact that you say he's a little aloof and cautious, overwhelms your statement of, ""he's friendly"". I suspect that he's a dog who's learned to deal with life on his own, without human direction, and if you take him home, he'll run your house for you.   His peeing as soon as he's on grass? yeah, I don't think that's serious evidence of being housebroken. I suspect it's ""I like to mark stuff"", and since the grass isn't in his run, well then time to mark!!  Don't mistake watching videos with dog training. There's a lot of learning to move yourself around, just like in a sport, that makes up learning to train a dog. When you watch someone who is very fluid with dogs, it's not just that they learned to do A, B and C. They learned to anticipate what the dog would do, to perfectly read the dog, and do whatever it is before the dog goes, ""oh yeah by the way...""  I know you want a dog: and that's great. But I think that offering to volunteer at the shelter, or something along those lines is far more workable for you at this stage of your life."
dogs,3de888,mmegggusta,5,Thu Jul 16 11:49:32 2015 UTC,"You're getting a lot of negativity from this sub. You have the tools to handle this dog, but the question is can you/will you and how much money are you willing to spend?  You being gone that long sucks, but there are many options, such as doggie daycare and dog walkers.   Five miles of running, along with playing in the back yard and swimming should be sufficient. I don't think training a dog not to pull is that impossible either.   Edit: most high energy dogs don't get a chance like this and will be put down."
dogs,3de888,merpsalot,3,Wed Jul 15 21:54:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's negativity, I think it's people trying to give OP exactly what they asked for: ""Help convince me not to adopt this dog"".    I mean, I'm pretty sure everyone here would cheer like crazy if OP adopted the dog, and everything worked out awesomely.  So what we're trying to do is make sure that OP doesn't just go snag the dog, freak out from how much work it might/will be, and then end up having to do the heartbreaking thing of bringing the dog back/ having to rehome it.   So if OP gets themselves all prepared for worst-case scenario and it ends up being not so bad? Then it's cake from then on out.  The opposite would just be miserable for both OP and the poor pup. Alternatively, OP decides to wait, and finds a dog that won't require quite so much lifestyle adjustment, and doesn't need ""convincing out of"" anything."
dogs,3de888,mmegggusta,3,Thu Jul 16 05:49:45 2015 UTC,"I understand your position. However, there are sentiments in these dog ownership subs (r/dogs, r/dogtraining, r/dogcare) that in order to have a dog you must have every appropriate thing crossed off the list, when dog ownership is a lot more fluid than that. Many working dogs need tons of energy expelled, but not all. People would swear that I need to put my dogs in boarding when I go away, but I have s friendly neighbor that loves my dogs and begs us to let him hang out with them, and asks us if he can visit while we're gone and feed and walk them and such.   Often, people adjust to their new friends, either by doing more exercise or by getting a dog walker or working things out with neighbors, or whatever. This guy probably frequents this sub and sees the insane expectations people impose on others for getting a dog and has unrealistically high standards for himself. Most people have little education and no intention of walking their dog, and little intention of paying more than a few hundred dollars for a vet visit, and many of these dogs live long and happy lives.   I've worked in the shelter. I've seen hundreds of perfectly healthy dogs die from lack of space. I find it ridiculous to have high expectations for perfection while healthy dogs die from lack of space."
dogs,3de888,SouthernAirTemple,2,Thu Jul 16 06:03:49 2015 UTC,"In addition, I have to work long hours. I'm fairly routinely gone for 10 or 11 hours a day 4 or 5 days a week, and if I adopted, the dog would be alone all day. I'm fairly active, and would have no problem getting him 2 or 3 miles a day of exercise, provided I can train him to not pull.   Your dog will either end up destroying the place, you will feel terrible for leaving him alone, or you will have to pay at least an extra $400 a month a dog boarding and be up at 5 AM every day to get him there. He will also undoubtably need training which will cost at least another $500 or so just for starters, as pretty much every single thing you take for granted he will need to be taught, dealing with separation anxiety and dealing with other dogs in a correct way. Think about that."
dogs,3de888,alialibobali,2,Wed Jul 15 22:00:02 2015 UTC,"I truly don't understand why the majority of people are saying don't get the dog. You've clearly put time into researching proper training and care of a dog. Do a little more. You've already visited him. Visit him again. Make an honest list of things you'll be willing to spend money on (unlike what people are saying here, daycare will not be necessary every day. But once a week might be nice) then triple it, as you'll be spending way more money than you planned. Make another list of activities you're willing to do with him, then factor in time and training for some activities (some dogs need to be taught how to swim, how to reliably hike off leash, etc) as well as logistics (do you have a car to drive him to the activities or are they in walkable distance?) Make a plan for who will watch him if you need to go away for a weekend, etc.   Nobody can decide if you're ready for a dog but you. But please be certain before you make the leap. As for if it's in his best benefit in terms of time and exercise, please dont let the snobs in this thread dissuade you:  It sounds like this dog is locked up most of the day as it is. Having a warm soft bed in a wonderful home with a brand new parent to look forward to at the end of the day doesn't sound bad! I'm sorry folks out there but not everyone who has a dog has a stay at home parent who walks the dog for 8 hours a day to meet their outrageous exercise ""needs"". Dogs stay at home! They stare out the window and they nap. It's FINE. I feel guilty leaving my dog by herself but at the end of the day she's a dog. She will love you anyway and she will live a happy life. I don't know when getting a dog became equivalent to having a baby and that it needs to be watched over 24/7. I've left my dog over 10 hours a ton. I make it up to her by showering her with love and attention and play time when I'm home, and i REALLY make it up to her on the weekends.   As for exercise, of course as you and everyone else has pointed out, you're looking at a high energy dog. But first of all, he's 5! Most dogs level out on their energy levels by then. Plus, i guarantee that the exercise you give him will be more than what he's getting now, and it will be enough. Give him extra attention and really wear him out on the weekends. People on this thread are so uptight about ""that's not enough exercise"" and jumping to ridiculous conclusions such as ""he'll tear up your house!"" And i have no idea why. I have a 2 year old collie who is a bundle of energy but she also knows how to chill out (sorry it's raining and mommy's not playing with you today or sorry mommy has to work really late today) and guess what she doesn't tear up the house and she's not miserable. She's happy and healthy and thank god i didn't ask this subreddit if i should have gotten her because they would have shut me down same as you, and i would have missed out on the greatest year and a half (so far) of my life. As someone else said, there's no ""good time"" to get a dog. If you just wait till you have more money or more time or more space you'll never get one and yet it sounds like you're ready for the commitment for one. Please don't let these snobs tell you you're not going to give him a good life because by the looks of it, you will. Get ready for the friendship of a lifetime!"

They play with their toys, they sleep, etc. I make up for it on my days off where I take them hiking or to the dog park etc. I see these people saying every 3-4 hours they have to be let outside, or they have to be walked.

I don't know where you're located, but you can definitely take on this dog as a sort of foster. Spend time with it, learn it's personality so you can write a decent bio for it. Get some good quality pictures taken, hell, maybe even get him professionally groomed.   All these things will make him stand out to potential adopters. I can't tell you how many times I've seen dogs listed with absolutely no description and that's a turn off to many people. I want to know what dog I can rule out before I drive all the way to meet it. And some of the most adorable dogs can be found after a good groom.

Because I run 3 miles in about 30 minutes. There is no way that 30 minutes of exercise is going to tire this dog out. That's a warm up. My dog routinely needs 2+ hours of strenuous exercise a day.

We found a black lab puppy for $50 bucks so we decided to go out and get him.  When we got there he was chained up outside and covered in fleas.  I couldn't leave him there to suffer so we took him home and cleaned him up.  I took him to the vet the next day and get him properly vaccinated and dewormed.  I paid for the whole vet visit so my friends decided he would be mine. I've had Drake for a little over 3 years now.  I trained him to hunt with me, so we have a real close bond.

Before him I had been the person to do most of the chores with the family dog who had just passed away so I wasn't inexperienced. Only a few days passed from when I started considering getting a dog before he was in my home at my parents house. Things were great the first year and a half but then I decided to move out.   I was not prepared for what it meant to be alone with a dog. I was not prepared for the lack of landlords who allows dogs, I was not prepared for the separation anxiety from suddenly having to be alone for a little bit each day (he was hardly ever alone at my parents'), I wasn't prepared for how everything needed to be planned around him...  It was an adjustment. We worked out the issues with being alone and I learned to embrace including him in as many of my activities as possible (thankfully my friends adore him). He's here now and he's happy and I love him dearly. We've figured it out together. But if I could go back to almost 3 years ago I'd slap 19 year old me on the back of her head and say ""now is not the time. You are not ready"""

I foster for the Toronto Humane Society, and they have partnered with a California rescue for chihuahuas, as they've got a bazillion chihuahuas there and yet tons of unfulfilled demand here. So they fly the little buggers here and foster, rehab and fix 'em up and get them adopted in no time.  My chihuahua-loving roommate immediately noticed the purse thing. Conveniently, just about all of these chihuahuas are juuust about the year old range and standard size, suggesting that it's a ""turned out bigger than my purse can fit"" problem. They buy the puppy having been promised it's a ""teacup"" version, but dog does not end up being ""teacup"" because it isn't a real size and two teacup parents can still produce standard sized puppies with no way to tell until the dog grows up.  Said roommate's parents are ""impulse dog"" people, all dogs of the purse variety. Two of the four current dogs are of the ""supposed to be a teacup but ended up bigger"" variety. Sigh."
dogs,3dd0o6,victoryfanfare,26,Wed Jul 15 12:44:35 2015 UTC,"A similar issue occurs with the inner city and ""pit bulls"" (Staffis and bull terriers). Young men get a scary looking dog to look more intimidating, of course don't get the dog fixed (almost exclusively they get male dogs), turns out the dog is too much work, so they just kick the dogs out. Leads to a ton of litters (because the dogs aren't fixed) of more pit bull variety dogs, which no one wants to adopt.  It's very sad."
dogs,3dd0o6,discoduck77,9,Wed Jul 15 15:40:10 2015 UTC,"That's the case here (Baltimore). Nearly everyone I know who has gotten a dog while living here has adopted a bully mix from the local shelter.

dogs,3dd0o6,ZaBreeNah,14,Wed Jul 15 12:45:50 2015 UTC,"I fostered dogs for a while back in early 2000's, mostly as an overnight or 2 while on their way to new home; i.e. spoken for so no danger of failure on my part :) it was awesome actually - a chance to experience breeds I would not have otherwise. St Bernard, pit bull, pug, greyhound, mixes. Most didn't have real names (pulled from pound), so I called the boys Buddy and the girls Penny. The rescue orgs paid any vet expenses. I had a Dobie for 2 months that I nursed from cowering bony ex breeder to awesome confident beauty - a local training facility donated training and eventually adopted her. My experience was that if you want to foster, you can pretty much define how far you want to take it. I finally stopped when my family was tired of it (I was always having to pickup/droppoff some dog 3 or 4 hours away and dragging kids with me) and when the last one gave my own 2 dogs worms. It was fun though!"

dogs,3dd0o6,squidzilla,3,Wed Jul 15 13:53:03 2015 UTC,"I love it, though it can be exhausting. Most folks do adult dogs for extended periods of time or medical or ""vacation"" breaks from the shelter, but I do puppies and kittens almost exclusively, which means I foster in like 8 week bursts, take a few months off and then do another litter. It's easy to fall in love, but it's also easy to just get really exhausted by the end of it; once you've had a few puppies or a half dozen kittens for eight weeks, you're ready for a break aka not keeping them.  That said, after almost four years, I finally had my first foster fail with Usagi this year; the chihuahua-loving roommate mentioned above (who has been my close friend for many years) only moved in with me last summer, so January was her first litter of puppies with me... needless to say, she succumbed to the puppydog eyes and I agreed that she could keep one puppy (with the THS's blessing and adoption fees, obviously.)  Unfortunately it means the foster cases I can take on now are somewhat limited, as we've now got an 8mo puppy in the house, but I hope to do puppies again when she's a little older.  That said, I am also very pragmatic about fostering and go into it with the understanding that they are only on loan, so to speak."

It was insane how many pages there were of just chihuahuas and chihuahuas; the little buggers are almost rare here, plenty of people own them but it's almost impossible to find them in shelters because they're picked up so fast.  I don't think we have a ""typical"" breed here in Toronto for shelters, but I fully anticipate huskies getting there. We see a lot of the bigger bullies, too, though Ontario has been a BSL province for about a decade, so the THS (and other shelters) have to send the rare pit bulls out of province."

dogs,3dd0o6,rhiles,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:14:48 2015 UTC,"Stray doesn't shock me at all, either. While I haven't heard anything as wild as the packs of stray chihuahuas in Arizona in a while, lots and lots of them are just abandoned on the streets. Dumping dogs is easier than bringing them to already packed shelters, I suppose :\"
dogs,3dd0o6,kazmanto,19,Thu Jul 16 02:58:56 2015 UTC,"My current dog was an impulse dog. She's a Pharaoh Hound. I saw a picture of the breed and was like ""holy shit, i need one"" and got one like a week later. Shes almost 3 now and I love her to bits.   That said, I've been around dogs all my life so it wasn't like some first time dog owner buying a malinois or something crazy like that and on top of this, she is one of the chillest dogs I've ever met. Basically a greyhound in temperament, if a touch more wary of strangers.   This is Cleo (super unoriginal, I know). http://imgur.com/gallery/PKUX6wv"
dogs,3dd0o6,Xyyzx,13,Wed Jul 15 10:49:28 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I've got to ask- how in the world did you get a Pharaoh Hound in a week? (or was that an exaggeration?) She's gorgeous though, but gosh I love how that breed looks."
dogs,3dd0o6,kazmanto,10,Wed Jul 15 13:26:09 2015 UTC,I'm curious too. I've been interested in Beezers and Pharaoh Hounds in the past and have always been told it's a year+ wait list for either.
dogs,3dd0o6,kazmanto,6,Wed Jul 15 14:56:46 2015 UTC,"It was 100% luck, really.   My mother's other half works for a yorkshire terrier breeder, who happened to know of a breeder that had a pharaoh hound for sale. I should add, I got her at 7 months old, so she was a good deal grown already, I didn't get a puppy puppy, just a sorta puppy. They were a one off litter due to how difficult they were to sell as no one had ever heard of them let alone knew they were for sale here in Scotland (shit, I hadn't ever heard of them either before I went on the hunt). They normally bred chinese crested and some other toy breed I can't recall."

I suspect it might've been from the same litter, as his estimated age was very similar to hers. Would have snapped him up so fast if circumstances had allowed. Doubt I'll ever see another in there unless they somehow explode in popularity (which I hope never happens, better for the breed that way).   I wasn't exaggerating when I said it was 100% luck, tbh."
dogs,3dd0o6,cincystace,5,Wed Jul 15 22:32:10 2015 UTC,"OMG she's beautiful! How are Pharaoh Hounds? I've heard such different versions of their temperaments.

Super smart""   Nice to see that you've ended up with such a happy story!"
dogs,3dd0o6,nkdeck07,8,Wed Jul 15 10:51:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) and I imagine its just down to the individual dog. Cleo startles easily but otherwise she is a very relaxed dog and a huge sleeper. Will be up and ready to go when you say its time to go out though, so she isn't lazy. Like a greyhound basically. Affectionate without being overbearing, next to no maintenance required on the coat. Though her claws grow like wildfire and I'm pretty sure they're some kind of diamond with how hard they are.   As for smart, I would say so. Often see her employing ruses to get toys off our other dog Murphy (staffie/something http://i.imgur.com/GE6QuFS.jpg) since she can't compete with that staffie jaw of his. Keeping her occupied with training etc is a bit of a challenge, though. She's a pretty independent dog.   edit: forgot about barking - shes not too bad, mostly she is silent but she will bark at strangers approaching the house or any cars she doesn't recognise but will then go full retreat if they actually enter. so shes a good watch dog, if not guard dog."
dogs,3dd0o6,kazmanto,6,Wed Jul 15 11:02:13 2015 UTC,Ha! Your Staffie looks so much like my family dog goose. She's a German Shepherd mix and a big fuckin' weirdo.
dogs,3dd0o6,parakeetprincess,3,Wed Jul 15 11:25:50 2015 UTC,"Hah yeah, can definitely see a resemblance. Murphy is a big dumbo himself, he's the type of dog that will very audibly smack his head off the table and not bat an eye at it. He has very industrious salivary glands too unfortunately. Can't pet the bugger and come away with a dry arm.   Should see about those DNA test things one of these days, always been curious to see what brand of dog his dad was. Definitely some kind of bigger dog, since he's a good bit bigger than a pure staffie."

By tiny I mean 3 lbs and she was dragging him. I stopped and asked her if I could buy her puppy, her dad came up to me and told me it was a beagle poodle pup an accident from their neighbors dogs. Gave her 20 bucks and I had a dog! Took him to the vet and it turns out he was 5 weeks old and had horrid fleas.   When I took him home my dad said I couldn't keep him so I packed my stuff up and was fully prepared to leave when he caved and said he could stay.   That's my impulse puppy story! My second dog was an impulse too, I had just moved to Texas to be with me SO and we saw a sign for German Shepherd pups. We stopped and it turned out to be a rescue.  She had one puppy left, she said no one wanted him because he was too small and she had to feed him with a bottle because the mom had rejected him. We paid his adoption fee (50ish) and came back for him when he was 8 weeks old.   Now we have a 1.5 year old beagle poodle and a 9 month old GSD! My boys. we lived in a shitty apt for 7 months because we couldn't find anywhere to allow us two dogs. Now we have and we couldn't be happier!"

We'd talked about getting a second dog, just not so soon but I got attracted to the picture of a totally different dog and we went to look (she didn't get on with Iggy).  Alice is totally the wrong dog. Not attentive, will probably never be off-leash, do agility, run with the bike (heart condition), doesn't play, doesn't cuddle; more of a cat than a dog really.  But she gets on famously with Iggy (not an easy task for any dog), is affectionate in her own curious way and it makes me happy to see her romp around on the garden with Iggy than be stuck in the rescue (good though they may well be).  Lots of people get fashion dogs for that, fashion. They want the trinket, not the responsibility. Whether it's dogs, cars or whatever; they'll get it and ditch it when it's out of fashion or too much trouble. Expect the Labrodoodles etc to start to appear in shelters over the next few years.  There's no helping the vacuous air-heads. All the sensible people can do is grind, bear it and try to clean up after them. In the case of pets, it just unfortunate than an animal has to suffer for the actions of these dimwits.  That's nothing against people who get a pet, actually try, and then fail for whatever reason.

My parents didn't let me have one when I lived with them, so as soon as I moved out I wanted to get one. I had had cats all my life, and I still have 2 now, so in my perspective the responsibility of taking care of another life wasn't going to be a problem. Mostly, if I could go back, I would just tell myself how much of a commitment it would be, but I don't think I would change my mind, to be honest.   She's definitely made my life so much happier, and I take care of all her needs (especially with the help of dog owner etiquette from this sub!), and she's healthy and happy and so am I, when I'm with her.   As someone who can be kind of impulsive at times, I understand the desire for some things and how it can definitely take you over sometimes.

I spent my entire shift emailing back and forth with the shelter, confirming that he was still there. Drove out the second my shift ended, in the pouring rain, to meet him. Filled out some forms ~30 minutes later and took him home!  He's the absolute love of my life, and I couldn't picture myself without him now.

However, I've owned many dogs and know full well what I'm getting myself into. I also don't abandon dogs almost no matter what. The only reason I'd ever get rid of a dog is because it was very sick and putting it down was the humane thing to do or the cost of treatment was so astronomical I couldn't wrangle up the cash (I'm talking like $20,000+). Granted, I've never had a mean dog before, so maybe I'd cut someone some slack for getting rid of a particularly bad one, but even then I'm not really okay with it. I think of a dog about like a kid. You can't just get rid of it because it's inconvenient or you've grown bored with your new toy. Of course, the sort of person who buys a handbag dog in the first place probably thinks of them more as an accessory than as a living creature worth respecting."

We knew we eventually wanted a young, male Aussie as a playmate for our female BC.  We had just moved to a tiny rural town and the local shelter had a special needs male Aussie puppy.  We honestly didn't even really give him a second thought due to what sounded like a pretty severe bowel disability and the fact that we were just settling into a new house.  On a whim, I asked the vet tech about him when I took our BC in for a heartworm test.  She explained the full nature of his needs, and it sounded pretty manageable.  We adopted him a week later!  He's an awesome little dude."
dogs,3dd0o6,itsnotphonetic,3,Wed Jul 15 16:46:16 2015 UTC,"Took a friend on errands with me. Let her go look at free puppies in a box while I shopped. Came out to her holding a 6 week old puppy sooo excited and happy about it. Until we left the parking lot and she was like ""...Wtf did I do this? I don't even like dogs"" so I offered to take him. Inseparable. He's 5.5 now. I made a lot of mistakes with him but it's been a fun journey."
dogs,3dd0o6,Surfsidecutie,3,Wed Jul 15 18:37:07 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say my dog was an impulse dog, necessarily. I had been considering getting a dog for about 6 months, and when we moved I managed to find a dog friendly place just in case. But I wasn't 100% sure and I kind of felt like I should wait until we had a yard (we were living in a condo at the time).   A couple months after we moved I got in a horrible car accident. I was rear ended on the highway at rush hour. The guy hit me at 50mph, and my car flew across the highway twice. It wound up being a 3 car accident (the person behind him hit him). I somehow didn't get hit by anyone else and I didn't even get whiplash.   So after that moment of mortality staring me in the face, the week after we replaced the car I started going to the rescue and on my second trip filled out an application for a dog. I wasn't 100% sure I was ready but that rescue did first come first serve and I knew if I hesitated someone else would get her. It was a Friday and I had to wait until Monday to hear back. I completely freaked out and read every dog book I could get my hands on (4 books in three days).   When I got her, she was 9 months old, underweight, super wormy, neglected, and scared of everything. She'd clearly never spent a day inside or ever been taken on a walk. She liked people but had no idea how to please them and it made her super anxious. Every dog was a potential threat.   It took about 8 months straight of work, but it's been over 2 years now and she is simply the best. I wouldn't trade her for the world. I knew enough to know getting a cattle dog mix in an apartment was a bad call, but I did it anyway, and it's been no problem at all. She is my BFF and we have so many awesome adventures together."

dogs,3dd0o6,misplacedyank,3,Wed Jul 15 19:14:27 2015 UTC,Mam went for a stroll one day. Seen a lovely scruffy puppy and she told the owner she thought it was a lovely dog. The owner then tells her he has to get rid of her as she's too much of a handful. So my mam comes home with said dog/pup who was a 6 month old wauzer.   Now she was a handful. Wouldn't stop messing in the house for years. Lacked basic obedience and had severe separation anxiety. That was 10 plus years ago!  We wouldn't be without her now. She comes to mine for a sleep over every weekend and she is just the cutest scruffy dog! Well behaved now and still has a lot of energy for an 11 year old.
dogs,3dd0o6,440_Hz,3,Wed Jul 15 19:19:44 2015 UTC,"I had just moved in to my own house and I was super lonely and one night I was like ""You know what? Fuck it. I'm getting a dog"". Went on Petfinder, filled out an application, sent in the donation, the rescue called me the next day, and he arrived on a transport 3 days later. I had a bit of an ""Ohhh shit, what did I do?!"" moment. I had seen ONE picture of this dog. All I knew was he was tiny and had an attitude, perfect, me too.   I wouldn't change a thing. He's grumpy, loud, and wont let me snuggle him, but he's awesome. Since getting him I adopted another chi and started fostering chihuahuas for the same rescue I got him from. There are so many and you really have to be a chihuahua person to have one. My second chi came from a dalmatian rescue in PA where one of the volunteers found her mom and multiple other puppies in a trash can, the mom gave birth the next day.   So my first little guy was an impulse, but the best kind. My second was also an impulse in the sense that I knew I wanted a second dog, but I found her a lot more quickly than I thought!"

One day we found this gorgeous, young pit bull/American bulldog mix, red nose, unspayed, etc. she was eighty lbs and super friendly, and we brought her into the room to play with her. She had an ideal temperament, playful and loving, but not aggressive in the slightest.   While we were in there, the shelter worker came in and closed the door quickly, saying,""There's some thugs here to pick up all the pit bulls. I don't have enough information to deny them adoptions, but you have first dibs on her""   So, of course, we got her."

dogs,3dd0o6,steelhelix,3,Wed Jul 15 21:56:30 2015 UTC,"I found a Pomeranian in a rural area, at the end of the driveway to my cabin. He wasn't looking so good, and I lured him with beef jerky. Got him, saw he had tags. I drove around to see if anyone owned him, but honestly he was looking really ragged and no one was around.  Got into cellphone range, called the number on his tag. It was the lady who bred him. She had sold him just over 3 weeks before, only to get a call from the man after one weekend saying he lost the dog already on a hunting trip and assumed it was dead.  So I took this pup to the breeder, she called me the next day to ask if I wanted to keep the dog because she didn't want to give it back to the man that managed to lose a dog so easily 80 miles from the nearest town.  That's how I became a dog owner 18 months ago."

dogs,3dd0o6,grainzzz,6,Wed Jul 15 20:58:34 2015 UTC,"My family has had cabins out there for a long time. At one point a lot of us had Chow Chows from the same bloodline. We had a pyre out there we would bring the dogs to after they died, and we'd burn them. At least 6 dogs have been memorialized there.  I had a quiet, sweet, very large, super fluffy black Chow Chow growing up. He succumbed to cancer. In line with the tradition, we destroyed his body at that pyre. About 8 years later, out of the woods less than a mile a way, I find a quiet, sweet, very small, super fluffy black Pomeranian.  I like to think I gave one up and got a little bit back."

Unfortunately this isn't a happy ending, as he was a great guy but I just don't have the emotional, financial, and physical energy to have that big a dog be reliant on me. Lasted about a week before I realized how much he would cost to keep with boarding and training, as he refused to go up the stairs to my apartment, I didn't want to leave him alone, and would have destroyed the place as he was high energy. Brought him back to the shelter though rather than abandon and won't be getting another dog any time soon, despite loving the idea of one."

Dog 1 was because he was mauled then abandoned at my practice.  Best friend and Co-worker one day said ""Zeus go find mommy!"" and he beelined as fast as he nose would take him straight to me.  Dog 2 was cause a friend asked me to ""help housebreak"" her, that was almost 9 years ago.  Cat 1 was because I couldn't let that spunky, Great Dane charging ball of tortitude live in our clinic anymore so called the husband to say ""Be pissed now cause I will be home in 30 and you better be over it.""  Then there are 2 Uromastyx adopted through my clinic, 4 desert tortoises, and 2 box turtles.  All came here cause I had room and at a certian point you just go ""Whatever, come on in!""  The only two well thought out adoptions were the youngest two torties.  4 months apart and I waited until they were 12 weeks before I could take them home.  None of my pets are ""normal"" and none of you want to see the running balance I have at my hospital (my boss loves tax time cause that it the only time of the year I don't have a balance)."

We ended up adopting another dog that we just happened to see on our way out, a big ol' sweetie pie who was sick, so he didn't even come up to the door of his cage when you passed by. He had great nap style. I never thought I would adopt a husky mix because I know they are crazy, but he was older and seemed very calm. Now I love him so much that sometimes I cry when I just look at his dumb sweet face.   Not exactly an impulse, because I had been researching/planning for months prior. But I did not arrive at the shelter planning to get him."

Now I have a handbag sized dog that I adopted from a coworker's terrible dog owning sister. I love her so much, she's been one of my greatest joys in life. If I were in the UK, I would definitely want to take another one home. For me, living in an apartment means that having a tiny dog is a great solution for sharing our space. Plus seeing her in a dress with pink nail polish is one of the things that makes me smile the most!"
dogs,3didbg,abcdefg123zx,10,Thu Jul 16 14:49:08 2015 UTC,"It's going to be way cheaper to just purchase a crate and manage it yourself. Also, not sure of many boarding places around me that accept aggressive dogs besides a vet, but they're literally just going to sit in a cage for months and that's unfair.   Can you describe the situations he's aggressive in? Have you hired a trainer to help you?"
dogs,3didbg,court67,-1,Thu Jul 16 14:54:43 2015 UTC,"yeah, theres another thread I made here you can see the things we've tried. Were pretty much 99% going to put the dog down, I just don't think I can bring myself to do it, hes so sweet to me and my wife, its like my kid. I'm trying to find a place with some grass that he can get let out in and I can visit every week until we move into a house at the end of this year, then ill build him a separate area in the back yard and have enough room to restrict him in the house when we have guests. Right now our apartment is too small and i'm scared for my newborn coming any day now. This is just really hard, maybe im in denial now :("
dogs,3didbg,court67,7,Thu Jul 16 15:08:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah that thread should shine a lot of light on your current training methods if you actually read it. The training you attempted was shit. You sent him away for three months where all he learned was basic commands? That's... Not going to help with aggression. You need to hire a veterinary behaviorist and actually give your dog the time of day before you spend thousands boarding him or put him down.   I'll be the first to recommend euthanasia for a dangerous dog. It's the kinder option all around. But your dog hasn't bitten anyone... I get that you don't want to take the chance with a child, but you can manage this situation- it is not out of control yet. Honestly, I'd be somewhat okay with you rehoming this dog instead. He sounds grumpy and intolerant but not really like a liability. I don't think euthanasia is appropriate, at least not until you give behavior modification training a fair shake."
dogs,3didbg,court67,3,Thu Jul 16 15:23:37 2015 UTC,"The behaviorist who my vet recommended and has great reviews told me she didn't think the dog would ever become what we would consider a friendly animal and it would always have that bit of unpredictability, she thinks its due to the breeder. All we could ever expect was management and over time as he gets older maybe he will relax a little. How does one train aggression when its only randomly displayed? The dog doesn't go after everyone or every dog but he can go from bringing you a toy to trying to rip your hand off in 2 seconds. I have researched every person i've brought my dog to and read all reviews before I did. I don't think its fair to assume the training is shit, I cant summarize in one paragraph everything i've done for the dog but its been a long emotional and expensive process. I don't trust anyone would have the patience for the dog and even if I found someone willing to take him hell probably end up biting someone or getting mistreated. The only person I would consider taking him would be someone who is a dog trainer and knows how to handle them. Going through all these processes of trying to ""fix"" the dog, ive realized there is no magic pill or person that can just cure him. That said I spoke with the wife and well just tough it out and crate him when we need to put the baby down until we move into a bigger place and I can segregate him from guests and my daughter until she gets bigger."
dogs,3didbg,therobbo91,2,Thu Jul 16 16:05:45 2015 UTC,"I think you're making the right call. It's okay if your dog isn't friendly. You got a bulldog not a lab. Your misunderstanding of the breed and their tendencies is not an excuse to just give up on that commitment. Yes, he's unstable. But in my opinion ( and it sounds like the opinion of the behaviorist too) he isn't dangerous. They recommended management, right? That's totally doable."
dogs,3didbg,court67,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:23:32 2015 UTC,"I never owned a bulldog before this one but I did read about them for a few years before getting one.

dogs,3didbg,mikeyo73,2,Thu Jul 16 16:35:03 2015 UTC,"If you're 99% sure you're going to put him down, why prolong his life? This dog would not do well in long term boarding, few do. Why make him suffer for a few months while you think about coming to a decision? Six days of boredom and maybe two hours of enjoyment is not satisfying for any dog.  You said you were 99% sure and then you go into how you're going to build him an area in the backyard... I don't think you know what you want to do. You've already contacted the most useful person, the behaviorist. No one here can even come close to that level of advice."
dogs,3didbg,therobbo91,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:28:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah but it sounds like the behaviorist never even met the dog. The only trainer they went to was the board and train and they've just been using choke and ecollars since... I don't know. I think a second opinion, someone who handles aggression and will actually come meet this dog, is necessary before I could ever consider putting down a dog that has never bitten."

If the behaviorist actually understands what's going on then I think their opinion is a valid one. But like always we can only go off of what information we're given. Either way, the dog needs to not be in this house because no progress is being made."
dogs,3df57f,pogo_is_god,11,Wed Jul 15 19:59:02 2015 UTC,"It just looks like mucus and tearing or perhaps a hair with the same to me. Gently wipe your dog's eyes with a damp cloth and run your thumb gently across the edge of the eyelid. You may be able to pull the schmutz to the corner of the eye where you can brush it away.   Small breeds like shitzus, maltese, etc often get an overproduction of eye gunk. This typically does not cause any pain, and if you notice your dog is frequently wiping at his eyes, he may just be a little irritated by it. Just wipe your dog's eyes with a damp cloth occasionally and it's probably fine :)"

dogs,3de3hd,pack0newports,14,Wed Jul 15 15:35:13 2015 UTC,"You need to start training a really good ""leave it"" command.  Start inside in a low distraction env with a treat in your hand and some more treats in your pocket or the like. Let the dog see you have the treat then close your hand. As soon as she stops trying to get the treat (looks away etc) click and give her a treat from your pocket. Keep repeating this and start adding the leave it cue once she stops even trying to get the treat.  Then move on to doing this with an open palm (close your palm if she tries to get the treat) then move on to treats on the floor, then right on the dog (if you are feeling particularly mean you can throw cheez balls around your dog as a special form of torture/party trick)   Once she's got a solid leave it in these circumstances start ""planting"" stuff along a walk and work on leave it on those items. Use SUPER high value treats for this one as it's very hard.   Eventually you will get your dog trained that if she doesn't touch the stuff on the sidewalk she gets rewarded"

dogs,3de3hd,Gian_Doe,2,Wed Jul 15 19:50:06 2015 UTC,"Teaching the ""leave it"" command like /u/nkdeck07 said will help a lot. Do make sure that when you're walking the dog isn't allowed to mosy about smelling everything. The trainer called it ""walking with purpose"". Keep the leash relatively short and don't stop or veer off course because your dog wants to. Keep walking and if she looks like she's going to try to reach for something give a little tug up on the leash to get her attention and don't give her time to stop.

dogs,3ddlkn,GSdoghelp,22,Wed Jul 15 13:07:44 2015 UTC,"What happens to Keisha will depend on how the family wants to proceed and what your local laws are. If I were you, I'd provide the family with all the information they request (shot records, proof of any training, etc) and wait and see. If they report your dog for a bite, that's completely within their rights. If they pursue legal action, I would look into hiring a lawyer just to be safe. Laws regarding dog bites are pretty varied depending on local laws so no one here can give you many specifics."
dogs,3ddlkn,court67,11,Wed Jul 15 13:18:06 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry this happened, and I am thankful for everyone's sake that the boy was not seriously injured.   With that said, I have some experience with managing aggressive dogs...as well as seeing when it goes wrong.  You can never trust this dog ever again. It is now completely up to you to manage this dog carefully for the rest of its life. She has shown you that 1) Her threshold and bite inhibition are both unacceptably low and 2) She has no problems making decisions about threats on her own. Again, completely unacceptable.  These things are not your fault or your SOs. They are just how she was made.   You can make any amount of excuses for why, but it did happen. So now it is up to you to make sure it never happens again. You seem to grasp this though, unlike many people. Just make sure you are aware of what you are in for, management wise.   For example: You should build a dog run in your yard, or have something similar in your house so that the dog is without a doubt secure when you are not there.  In other words, you have no margin for error if guests are over and someone leaves the door open when you are not present. The dog should have zero access to escaping at all times, in all situations.   Also have your dog blocked off from the front door somehow so that she cannot bolt out. Ever. You can use a baby gate or ??? (but is there a chance she would jump over it?) by your entryway as a back up to being very careful opening the door, or put her somewhere secure if you need to leave the door open. Think of ways as backup to keep her secured.  This is just talking about the door and her being contained.   Work with a trainer during this to make her obedience top notch, but always have a way to back it up (blocking access to running out the door) because you have no way of knowing if this will cross her threshold again and unravel all of the obedience.   Animal control may or may not be visiting you. If the boy got official medical attention, the bite was reported.  If animal control visits you, your dog will be quarantined at your home for 14 days If her vaccines are up to date Also with the bite being officially reported, you are now significantly more liable for any future incident."
dogs,3ddlkn,miagolare,11,Wed Jul 15 20:54:10 2015 UTC,"You should do everything in your power to show you're a responsible owner. You should have gotten a trainer and/or behaviorist for Keisha yesterday. Definitely check up on the family and see how everything is going. If medical treatment was needed, offer to pay for it. Find out more about the boy and get him a present or something. Bake cookies for the family. Anything to show that you not only are trying to be responsible about it, but you care for the health and wellbeing of others who have unfortunately been injured by your dog."
dogs,3ddlkn,stormeegedon,10,Wed Jul 15 15:01:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed.   Find a veterinary behaviorist so that they can check for physical issues that may be exacerbating the problem, decide whether or not to use drugs as part of the treatment plan, and make evidence-based recommendations: http://www.dacvb.org/about/member-directory/  In the meantime, you need to be even stricter about safety and avoidance. If you haven't already, buy a basket muzzle and use peanut butter in the bottom of the muzzle to get her used to it. If you're walking her in public, strongly consider using a muzzle in case she gets away or a kid gets loose from their parents and walks up to pet the cute doggy. If you're walking her in a flat collar, get a martingale collar so that there's no chance of her slipping the collar. Since she has a history now of slipping out of the door, you need to find a double barrier so that it can not happen again. She should not be able to get to the door when you're opening it; you can put her in a crate, x-pen, or another room with a door, or you can block off just the area near the door with an x-pen. Showing that you're serious about preventing another incident may also help with any legal issues.  I'm sorry for all parties involved. I have BTDT with an aggressive dog and I lived in fear of this happening, or worse. It's very stressful and most likely it is NOT your fault. Best of luck."
dogs,3ddlkn,punstersquared,3,Wed Jul 15 15:50:04 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you probably won't be sued if the injuries are as minor as you describe them and if there is no possibility of scarring since there will be little value in the case.  Source: I'm a P.I. lawyer in MD.  However, even an ER visit of 3-4k may be enough to have them consider getting a PI attorney if they are litigious since that may trigger enough value for an attorney.  Personally, if this is all there is to it, I would not take the case.  But if you are sued, then if you have kept any applicable insurance company (e.g. homeowner's insurance, renter's insurance) up to date on your dog ownership and your breed is not specifically excluded, then they will hopefully assist in defending any claims against you by providing a lawyer.  As for the health and safety of your dog, I cannot speak to that since I don't have any experience with that aspect of it, but I wish you luck."

Cerenia works well for long trips, but it's too expensive for those ""Im bored... want to go to the park?"" kind of trips. I only take her anywhere in a car when it's absolutely necessary, and I always plan on not feeding her for a few hours beforehand. Best of luck!!"

Our record was 5 in one trip :/ it got to the point where I could just hold a dog bag up and he would vomit into the bag. Thankfully now he is happy in the car. We would take lots of car rides to happy places and we wouldn't freak out if he did puke because that would make him scared. Just be prepared with garbage bags and towels.

Some dogs just get carsick, mine used to barf 5 min into being placed in the car when she was younger and even now turns into a drool fountain.  1.) There's a decent shot he will grow out of it entirely or it will lessen as he gets older.  2.) Benadryl works very well for longer car rides.   3.) Remove food 3-4 hours before the ride begins.

She got over the vomiting part of it really fast, but I'm pretty sure it still upsets her stomach, because she wedges her head in between the back of the seat and the seat or smooshes it in between the door and the seat for the entire duration of the trip.  The amount of coaxing to get her to jump into the car on her own is unreal, as well. -.-' I'm hoping she gets over it eventually."

I think back to when I was about 8 and my lab straight up dragged me down the sidewalk on my stomach and my parents should have never in a million years let me take an animal that was my weight and so much stronger out. That puppy could have just as easily pulled the leash out of that girls hands"
dogs,3ddzfs,nkdeck07,4,Wed Jul 15 15:36:26 2015 UTC,My moms lab did that when I was in my 20's! One good yank when you're not expecting it and you're airborne.    Yeah and dog lover me would have caught the damn thing while juggling Bruce & his two bags of shit. Because pooping all at once in one place just isn't his style.

dogs,3ddzfs,kagzig,4,Wed Jul 15 23:29:20 2015 UTC,"Also, the cords on the retractable leashes can do some serious damage if they are wrapped or pulled tightly around fingers. A kid is already going to have problems controlling the dog, but the flexi adds the additional risk of injury, especially in the hands of a kid who might try to stop a pulling dog by grabbing at the cord. It sounds extreme/absurd, but there are enough flexi lead injuries (deep lacerations, even severed fingers) to consumers that the packaging includes a warning about it. This whole situation is just one bad idea after another."

When I was that age, I had lots of wild ideas too - but that's why I had parents to filter through my ideas.    Perhaps let the mom know on your next encounter that her unsupervised daughter walking a puppy is a disaster waiting to happen in general."

The first time I met them (from a distance, Bruce half barking) I think she had mentioned it was their first dog. I also might throw in advice on introducing two dogs & the control that needs to be there when doing so. Maybe a horror story about the last time I ever used a flexi lead & I flew five feet attached to the lab trying to chase deer & wound up with two very skinned knees & elbows. Might terrify her into using a regular lead so her kid doesn't get super scraped up?"

We recall our dogs and either hold them short or switch to a fixed lead if people are around (and is over-friendly but has good recall, the other's a...well...a Husky). Seeing people use them on pavements etc does my head in as well, there's cars nearby and the dog could easily dart into the road.  My only gripe is that I wish cyclists would sound their bell further away so we know they're coming. Retractable lead or no, it takes a moment to get two dogs off the trail.  I'd speak with the girl's parent and just explain that you're not being mean, you just don't want a problem to develop for either party."

Theres a major debate in my area right now regarding bikes on a multi-purpose rails to trails type thing and all the cyclists are yelling about off leash dogs. While yes I agree with the off leash dogs are a problem as a cyclist as well you shouldn't be going so fast you can't stop easily on a very busy trail in the middle of a city. It might not be a dog, it might be a toddler."

I had a biker give me the stink eye when he blasted around a blind corner and nearly hit my dog. Granted she wasn't technically allowed off leash, but what if she had been a toddler or an old person that couldn't easily move out of the way?   We take her biking all the time, so it's not that she doesn't know how to move out of the way, he just surprised her. Jerk."

I have never liked a retractable and I have yet to see or hear of a reason as to why a retractable leash is better and safer in any situation than a normal leash. I don't believe a situational example or reason exists. That doesn't mean all people are irresponsible with them. I think there are people who use them wisely, correctly. But I don't know of a situation where they are actually superior to that of a normal lead.  I have my share of nightmare stories involving people and retractables.  I have been tripped up running and on the bike because of them frequently. I also found an abandoned or lost 'teacup' chihuahua once attached to a retractable on a choke chain and the leash was as heavy if not heavier than the dog. Just dragging until it got caught on a root and tangled its tiny leg. It had been injured by the contraptions by the time I got the leash and collar off.  There is no reason though the child should have been walking the dog alone, let alone on the retractable."

My dog has excellent off-leash behavior and a near perfect recall. He was raised in a house with a backyard so he refuses to do his business too close to me. The retractable leash allows him to get far enough away from me to be comfortable. A leash is not necessary for this dog, but I use one to abide by leash laws and for the peace of mind of anyone walking past. They don't know that my dog is very well trained, so a physical leash is a way to respect the other people around us.   I was using a long line, but handling a leash that gets drug across pee-soaked grass was not my idea of a fun time. The slight tension in the retractable leash keeps it up off the ground and is way easier to handle when it's pitch black outside than a 20-30ft long line.   So there's your one example, haha."

It's a matter of understanding what the dog actually needs and using appropriate tools, nothing is one size fits all.  That said, lots of things are one size doesn't even fit most, and that's where I think retractable leashes are."

I know traditional leads work very well in both scenarios and are safe, but having not used a retractable for this, I couldn't say which is better. I can see the retractable being more convenient certainly.)"

Stop following me, stop making my dog uncomfortable, just stop. Of course she doesn't understand what she did wrong, but that doesn't mean you can't be an advocate for your dog.

Also the neighbors are under no obligation to talk to you guys before calling animal control.  What should you do? APOLOGIZE(and pay for any vet bills). Pay whatever fine gets thrown your way(rarely are dog put down for their first offense) by AC. Secure your fence and no more unsupervised time outside."

Terriers (which pits are) tend to grab and shake, that could easily break a dog's neck. Wanting to go after smaller animals isn't abnormal or really even the issue, the issue is that he was able to act on that want.   At this point I doubt you're going to make huge strides in making him like other dogs, so you need to focus on making sure he can't get out. He needs a sturdy fence and to not be left outside unsupervised. When he's on walks he needs to have a sturdy leash and harness, possibly attached in more than one place."
dogs,3dfx7d,therobbo91,7,Wed Jul 15 23:34:37 2015 UTC,"The fact that he has killed a bird before shows he does have prey drive. It seems likely to me that this prey drive led him to attack the poodle (small, fluffy, yippy = perfect prey).

Prey drive is certainly manageable though -- the first thing you need to do is to patch that fence and make it inescapable."

dogs,3dfx7d,je_taime,2,Thu Jul 16 00:01:08 2015 UTC,"The fact that this was a tiny dog-- not a regular-sized dog, not a person-- likely means that this incident isn't a sign that your dog is aggressive in the way people typically think of ""aggression"". Assuming you haven't seen him display any kind of aggression to other sizes of dogs before, this was likely a case of predatory drift, where a prey-driven dog comes to see another dog (usually a toy breed dog) as prey instead of a fellow dog. Prey drive is normal, and is even intentionally bred into some breeds. So while it's normal, it's also a serious problem that requires serious management.  If I were in your shoes, I'd do everything in your power to legally defend your dog (if it comes to that, e.g. if your neighbors try to sue you or something crazy), and then I would take serious steps to make sure that he is safely contained-- even if that means never letting him outside offleash and muzzling him on walks. Whatever it takes. This is probably obvious, but I'd never take him to a dog park again. I would also deeply apologize to your neighbors and outline the steps you are taken.   I'd never trust a dog who'd exhibited predatory drift around a small dog again, but I also don't think it indicates that (for example) there's any reason to expect that your dog would ever be aggressive toward people, or even necessarily toward larger dogs."

She is NOT in the yard unsupervised (and that's a large privacy fence) and when we walk she is in her sled harness or a Freedom Harness (double lead attachment) Dog aggression is not uncommon but it is manageable."

I brought my first dog here from the US and the second dog I got while I was here, not from a shelter but privately. So, I can't comment on WHERE to get the dog.  I just had to register my dogs in the city I lived in, for me just outside of Vienna. They're not on this list so I did not need to get the certificate or pay the extra fee for an ""aggressive breed."" For me it was about €70 for two dogs just outside of Vienna, but in the city I think it is about €70 for one dog. This is yearly of course.  I have a friend in Vienna who took this test for the certificate, and I think if you pass, you no longer have to pay the yearly fee for your dog. At least this is what I heard, I am not sure if it is true for sure so don't quote me on it. :)  In general I really like having a dog in Vienna, people are really nice and as you know you can take them practically anywhere!

So snuggly, gentle, an amazing dog. She had been discarded on the side of the road and brought to the shelter when she was found.   I got her a crate and put blankets in it and everything was perfect...until I left. She slammed her body into the crate, shredded everything she could find. Okay, maybe she hates the crate? Ask my roommate if the dog can stay out with her and her boyfriend while I run to the grocery store....dog paced and howled and couldn't handle it. She was only ever kenneled for 4 hours at a time. Eventually, I had to be the person who took her back to the shelter. I couldn't trust her out of the kennel when I left to work, she was injuring herself in the kennel, couldn't be left with anyone else, and I worried if I got a dog run, that she would run away. It's also far too hot where I live for that to be a solution. I am confident she found a new home- she was a great dog. I felt horrible having to surrender her, but at least the shelter knew what to tell people and to let them know she needs extensive training and time devoted to her to recover from her anxiety that I couldn't afford to give her. She was my best friend so for her sake I made the call that was hard.   Can you foster this dog for a bit? Has she been fostered? From my experiences, I'm hesitant to say this dog is a good idea, but I had a traumatic time. She was the most anxious dog I've ever heard of. I couldn't shower with the door closed without her having a meltdown. I don't know. I guess that's my two cents for whatever they're worth."

dogs,3dh15y,KAggie13,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:14:52 2015 UTC,You could work on her anxiety like you would with a puppy. Leave her and then come back after 5 minutes. Repeat again and again while you leave her longer periods of time. It's time consuming and a lot of work but she may respond to the training even at 6 yo.
dogs,3dh15y,settersrclowns,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:52:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with fostering. My almost 8 year old mutt dog has SA. He will be fine for months, and then go on a panic driven path of destruction. We are currently in a destructo-dog phase again, and I am so far past my patience threshold right now. I sobbed for an hour the other day after coming home to my carpet ripped up. And, my guy cannot be crated. He destroys the crate, hurts himself, and destroys the floor under the crate. Confine him to a room? Last time he ate a metal doorknob clean off. I have had him 6 years, and now, am contemplating finding a rescue for him. I just can't emotionally take it any more. You need to be sure it will work before committing."

dogs,3dg2bh,Mad_Marchie,3,Thu Jul 16 00:24:48 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty good start, and it's perfect for you because it's not breed specific but a general one. Read through it, add some of your own if you want. If you wonder why a certain question is there, educate yourself on that subject by google or by simply asking here. That way, if the potential adopter asks why you need to know, you can explain, or even explain what to do in some cases like introducing animals. Put some kind of up front cost on the dog; you can waive them at the time of adoption, but it's good to weed out scumbags."

That's why in stressful situations it's recommended to stay calm.

Maybe it's just because he's young, but he doesn't typically mimic me exactly, however if I'm frustrated or irritated he'll typically become quite chaotic and just go nuts. If I'm sad, he becomes very possessive and nervous, and if I'm more positive and upbeat he's just totally blissed out."

However, one time we went and there was this girl and her 4 month old puppy and my dog was playing with him (stalking, my dog's way of playing, he stalks and then runs and stops and sniffs them). Anyway, this girl started shooing my dog away from hers and when I got close enough to her she was like 'Your dog is being aggressive, I read somewhere if they hold their tail up it means they are aggressive' I didn't have the patience to deal with her ignorance so I just kinda ushered my dog to another area while still kinda filled with anger about her being stupid. Finally they left and my dog got to play with the others without me having to keep him way from her dog.  I've seen them a few times since and everytime my blood kinda starts to boil a little. The last time I saw them I started getting mad and was thinking 'oh great, not this girl again' and my dog ran right up to her and her super submissive dog and kinda play/kinda not growled. I think he can sense that I really don't like this girl. I actually feel bad for her dog too. I feel like she has been way too protective over it because every time I see them at the dog park this dog rolls over in fear when greeted by every dog.  I feel like my anger for her rubbed off on my dog and I also feel like her fears rubbed off on her dog...."

dogs,3df0qm,drpepperofevil,10,Wed Jul 15 19:29:14 2015 UTC,"The idea that your dog is trying to be the boss/alpha has been thoroughly debunked. Your dog is exhibiting nervous behaviour and is trying to reassure herself by being close to you. Did something unusual happen today? Did one of your guests do something to freak her out, even unintentionally?  Best thing you can do for now is just stick to the status quo to show the pup that everything is okay and the world is going to keep on turning as usual. If it persists, then you can look into behaviour modification."

This behavior seemed a lot less frightened, and more confident."
dogs,3df0qm,caffeinatedlackey,2,Wed Jul 15 19:59:02 2015 UTC,"If it bothers you a lot, you can gently push the pup off you, or pick her up and set her down next to you. When she settles next to you/on your lap, give treats and pets. If that doesn't send the message, you can give a sharp ""hey!"" or ""no!"" (or whatever word you use for correction) when she starts climbing onto your shoulders to startle her into interrupting the climbing."
dogs,3df0qm,tallowlab,2,Wed Jul 15 20:02:38 2015 UTC,I think caffeinatedlackey is right. The other question to ask yourself is whether the dog is getting enough mental stimulation and exercise. Take her for a walk or do some training and she is likely to settle down.
dogs,3df0qm,melodicstory,3,Thu Jul 16 11:23:29 2015 UTC,"This sounds more like anxiety. When fireworks are going off, our dog will literally try to climb one of us in sheer hysteria.  Check to see if there's anything that could have freaked her out."

dogs,3dfoqx,misswestwood,3,Wed Jul 15 22:19:36 2015 UTC,"IMO any type of play is acceptable as long as all parties look relaxed and happy. However I do keep an eye on dogs that like to play chase, because usually running around so fast tends to get a lot of dogs super aroused/excited and more likely to escalate to a fight.   I know play has gone too far when there are any dogs that look scared, upset, or otherwise uninterested (and continue to be ""played"" with by the other dog) or if they're playing too rough (snarling, biting). I also am cautious when I see hackles up (usually means high arousal), but it doesn't always turn into a situation."
dogs,3dfoqx,440_Hz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:52:18 2015 UTC,"I know the general rule of good dog chasing is to switch off, but my dog only likes to be chased. He almost never does the chasing and will always try to get the dogs to chase him. I think some dogs just have a preference for being the chaser or the chased. If the other dog doesn't look scared or tense, it should be fine.  Some dogs are also just more vocal and there's not really much you can do about it, you can try training her how to be quiet, but at a dog park, there's just so much excitement that it's hard. If you find that her barking is too much or bothering people, you can try giving her timeouts (I usually set my dog in a sit or down where other dogs aren't going to arouse him for a minute or two). Results will vary, consistency helps.  It sounds like you're doing fine by keeping a close eye on her and taking her away when you think the other dog isn't interested."

My beagle mix adores chasing at top speed, and once she gets going , it's full on beagle yarp/howl/freaky guttural noises. Most dogs seem to like it? The owners always get a kick out of the crazy noises my girl makes, plus it's tiring their pups out.  I usually take her off to the side if shes barking/bowing at a dog who is obviously not interested.   Otherwise, it seems like fine dog park play in my opinion."
dogs,3dfoqx,Charliethehog,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:04:56 2015 UTC,"My boy is very very vocal. He will chase a dog and as he is about to 'catch' it he barks and talks. But I know my dog, and I know he is not at all being mean. I have never seen my dog actually go after a dog with malice. I have seen my dog be attacked (because he tried to pick up a tennis ball another dog had dropped) and he is a little baby running in the opposite direction.   But, sometimes his talking scares some owners and it's just something I've had to get used to. I always make sure to go up to a dogs owner when mine begins to chase their dog and let them know that my dog is a 'big talker' and 'likes to use his big mouth' but that he is all talk. A lot of times they are just like 'Oh it doesn't bother me, mine is sometimes like that too.' Occasionally you meet an owner who isn't comfortable with it and I just accept that and take my boy swimming instead."
dogs,3dgd1r,JCX-115,13,Thu Jul 16 01:35:24 2015 UTC,"Reactivity is very common in German Shepherds. There's also a chance he's just going through a fear period (4 mo is about the right age). My pup developed all kinds of quirks around this age, but grew out of them with minimal effort on my part.   My biggest recommendation would be to read up on Behavior Adjustment Training (BAT) and implement that training strategy. The idea is that you start far enough away from whatever is exciting your dog (in this case, a jogger) and reward your dog for calm behavior. Gradually decrease your distance to the exciting/scary object and continue rewarding for calm behavior. If at any point the dog starts to bark or get excited/stressed, you know you moved to quickly and you should back up to where he is no longer displaying that body language. Reinforcing a ""watch me"" or ""look"" cue will also be really helpful. Here's a video on how to teach that. Basically, you'll be rewarding your dog for focusing on you, not on other distractions in the environment.   Also, important to mention that forced jogging is pretty discouraged at your pup's age. He's still growing, and the impact of running continuously on a surface like asphalt/concrete can damage his growth plates. At 4 months old, you should try to restrict heavy running to natural surfaces, like grass. No jogging until he's about a year old- consult your vet."
dogs,3dgd1r,court67,3,Thu Jul 16 01:46:03 2015 UTC,"Just seconding the warning about running with a puppy.

dogs,3dgd1r,caffeinatedlackey,-1,Thu Jul 16 15:22:27 2015 UTC,"I think that's waaaay overboard. It depends on how much you run, but a couple kilometers at say 8 or 9 months won't be stressful on the joints."
dogs,3dgd1r,yarr_be_my_password,2,Thu Jul 16 15:56:56 2015 UTC,"I'm just repeating what I read over on /r/runningwithdogs. I personally take my 4 month old GSD mix on short (<1 mile) jogs with me in the evening when it's cool, and I intend on working up to faster outings with him over time. I won't take him for serious runs with me (3+ miles) until he's finished growing, which will be when he's a year and a half.  The rule of thumb with puppies is 5 minutes of intense exercise per month old. So a 9 month old would be fine with a 45 minute jog if you work up to it, but obviously you shouldn't expect your 8 week old pup to be running with you right away."

Since the dog has now been taken to 2 vets who were not able to come up with an answer, I'm inclined to think that we could be dealing with something uncommon and/or elusive: for example - an endocrine disorder, an allergy or hypersensitivity, or a complex parasitism/overproliferation of demodex mange (that went undetected).

That being said I am very nervous about you talking about the ""pack leader"" stuff as most of that information has been pretty throughly debunked (essentially if Caesar Milan says it it's probably wrong)  Most of this dogs problems sound like an issue of consistent reinforcement (i.e. if you don't want her on the couch then make sure to remove her every single time) and exercise.

If so, will he just cry and go away or will he react back and hurt the cat? My aunt and uncle had their cat before their new puppy. He cut the little guys nose :( and the puppy learned his lesson to leave cats the hell alone, but it took that incident to get there. (before he was scratched all he did was sniff the cat, not even jumpy or hyper)   I would also let your sis know that since this is her idea if ANYTHING happens that she cannot hold you responsible for it. (Vet bills, injuries, etc) Like you said she knows her own cat so I'm putting faith in her but you should be clear that this is a new experience to have another pet in your dogs home."

I think the guidance about proper introductions of cats and dogs is pretty standard for a reason - you never know how either animal will react. Both animals may be the calmest, mellowest animals ever and may be good with familiar animals, but can be unpredictable when confronted when a new strange creature.   I think your primary concern should be about each animal's safety. If it's for a short visit, I'm not sure it's worth what could be awful - and if the cat does freak out, it has to go back in a carrier and in a car, which might be a sucky thing.

It might be better to leave the cat in the bathroom.  Obviously, it's up to you and your sister, but even if they're supervised, cats are fast.

I personally would not introduce them. Kitty is already going to be majorly stressed out with traveling. I would keep the cat in a separate room that the dog can't get in to.   If you're 100% set on introducing them, I suppose you could put up a baby gate across the room door so they can just see each other - we do this on our second story when we have new dogs visiting so the cats have a safe space. But it's very likely the cat will want to hide and just not deal with the dog. Definitely don't force them to be together if even one of them is not interested."

dogs,3dfobd,misplacedyank,2,Thu Jul 16 03:36:33 2015 UTC,"All animals are of course different - you got lucky with your cat growing up! I have two very different cats - one is fine traveling but gets stressed at changes in our home, and is just high anxiety in general. The other is cool with stuff in the house but cannot handle traveling (even a trip to the vet is an ordeal). They are creatures of habit and don't do well with change, and it can be hard to tell sometimes. But too much stress can lead to other health issues (urinary issues, aggression, etc). Basically, I'm less worried about your dog and more worried about the cat's health. It's a lot to risk for one meeting.   I hope it all works out for you (and the animals)!   Also worth noting - even if an introduction goes well, they're not going to be best buds right out (in case this is what your sister is hoping). We have had our dog for...9 months now and they are still somewhat cautious around each other and don't totally get each other's body language."
dogs,3dfobd,misplacedyank,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:57:48 2015 UTC,Oh i dont think she is looking for them to be best buddies at all. Neither am i. My dog doesnt really do that.  Tbh i think she may be thinking of getting a dog. So I think she wants to see if her cat can handle it on some level. But I am not 100% sure.
dogs,3dfobd,misplacedyank,2,Thu Jul 16 10:18:38 2015 UTC,That would make sense. I don't think she'll get good results testing this when the cat is already uncomfortable. That's the reason for the long introductions :)

Seriously, as long as you weren't driving ridiculously over the speed limit, it isn't your fault. Hell, I almost hit a teenager a decade ago when he darted out between two parked cars into the middle of the road.

The sad truth is that there are far more high energy, aggressive dogs who need one on one attention and training than there are people who have the time and ability to train them.  Don't feel bad if you make the decision to put Shasta down, but do have it done at home, where she's comfortable, and not in the county shelter."
dogs,3daw9f,shelbyknits,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:59:49 2015 UTC,I second this. I think it's kinder to euthanize dogs at home with their families that you know have a low probability of ever being re-adopted again. She'll just suffer and be alone in a shelter or rescue and then be euthanized.
dogs,3daw9f,ArghJustArgh,16,Wed Jul 15 21:31:23 2015 UTC,"Did the vet do an x-ray for her hips? If she's physically hurting, there are medicines available to help with pain and possibly surgery. If you can afford it, and want to rule out one last possibility, have her hips x-rayed to see if she is dysplastic or if there's another joint issue at play.   If Shasta has no physical issues, then I think you'll have to resign yourself to the fact that this is in her head. It's possible that Shasta is in pain and she perceived your toddler walking by her as a threat to her safety (it sounds like she was ""trapped"") and reacted out of a fear of pain. HOWEVER, it is also possible she's just really reactive and anxious, to the point of being a bit of a loose cannon and unsafe. I don't want to give you false hope. But if I were you and I had the money, I'd check out the hips and put my mind at ease.   If her hips are fine, rehoming Shasta has some real risks. Unless you personally know someone who knows Shasta and wants her, I would probably look towards euthanizing. The behaviorist and trainer might have connections for other people, however."
dogs,3daw9f,overpriced_popcorn,6,Wed Jul 15 01:12:10 2015 UTC,"She didn't do an xray. She didn't even really complete the exam because Shasta slipped out of the muzzle and was very agitated.   I may need to get another opinion, but when the behavioralist came (she is also a DVM) she didn't notice anything either so really this would be a third opinion and I feel like I am just throwing my money away because I wish there was an easy answer."

On the outside she looked and acted totally normal, but on the inside she was really, really sick. We had the option of trying a radical treatment but she would have to spend three days away from us, or we could let her go knowing we had done our best.  If your dog had a terminal illness would you have this hesitation?   How would you feel if this dog was placed in another home and bit another child? What about an adult?   I know it's hard, and it's not fair you are saddled with this. It's the hardest decision an owner will ever have to make for their pet."

dogs,3daw9f,je_taime,2,Wed Jul 15 15:29:06 2015 UTC,"Not a regular household/family situation, definitely. At least not with a dog that has a history of unprovoked biting, and/or biting that can't be definitively traced to a certain stimulus that can be avoided. But there are plenty of households that are adults-only, and there are certainly people involved with dog rescue who are prepared to deal with extra-challenging dogs.   This certainly isn't a situation where just randomly rehoming the dog to anyone who thinks it's cute would be a wise idea. This isn't a situation like when a dog is aggressive solely toward cats, or where someone got two puppies and they have a terrible case of littermate syndrome, and it's not even a situation like the dog my family once fostered who was deaf and incredibly nervous and could bite if you really surprised her. At the same time, I do think there are rescues-- particularly coonhound-specific rescues-- that could get to the bottom of this dog's issues and (assuming there's not something really weird going on here like a serious neurological issue) find an appropriate home."

Honestly, if I ran a breed specific rescue I wouldn't take this dog on. Not to be mean to Shasta but at this point she's become a money pit for a dog that may end up being euthanized anyway, meanwhile there are four or five other hounds in animal controls in the area that do not have bite histories or need thousands of dollars of medical testing.  Just my opinion; I respect yours as well but if it were up to me I think euthanasia is the kindest option here."

I was able to get my boxer trained to run on one, mostly because he was obsessed with trying to attach the tread as it moved, but it was a good outlet when I didn't have other options for him.   Unfortunately,  I had to make the really painful decision to put him down in February. I think about him all the time, and miss him every day. He was in a lot of pain and he truthfully didn't trust a lot of people. He had some major health issues that we worked through, but his behavior continued to decline, and he became very unpredictable. I watched as he got progressively more moody, until one day he just had a break down.   Ideally, with the things that triggered his mood swings,  he would have been happy with a single person, who could run with him all the time, with no other commitments, pets or children. The truth is it's very likely that ideal person wasn't out there. I got him from a couple trying to rehome him on their own. It's likely he had the same behavior issues with them.   I tried for 4 years, hoping he was close to turning the corner, and it just got worse. I  couldn't keep him anymore. I didn't have many good options. I could lie and try and get him into a rescue, I could drop him off at a shelter and hope he was picked up at a loving home, the right home, before his time ran out. Or I could give him a good last week, and put him to peace knowing that he wasn't going to be wondering where I went to, knowing that I gave him a good life and knowing that he wasn't going to spend the rest of his life locked in a cage and lonely.    I had so many regrets, I wished I could do so many things differently from the get go with him. But in the end he went out on my lap, with the people who loved him.   I really hope your able to find a good solution. It sounds like you're willing to try every avenue for her. I'm sorry there isn't an easy option for you. :("

dogs,3daw9f,mrstyrion,5,Wed Jul 15 03:27:25 2015 UTC,"I have been in a similar situation, I was bitten on the face by my dog when I was 6, right under my eye and the doctor said just a few inches up and I would have lost that eye. He was sleeping and I went to hug him goodnight, which startled him and he bit me. That was the only time he had ever been aggressive so my parents opted not to euthanize him. We didn't have any more issues for years. Flash forward years later, we've had another dog for a few years, they were both eating their dinner (both bowls were on separate sides of the room to avoid conflict) when all of a sudden we hear the awful sound of dogs fighting. My dad goes to where they are, there is blood EVERYWHERE, and one of the dog's faces is partially ripped off. My dad had to get a broom and stick it between them just to break it up. My point is... I agree that the best option is to re-home her somewhere without children and other pets. Most dogs are good dogs at heart, some just need a little extra help. I can tell that you love her and don't want to have to put her down. It will probably be hard, but it is possible to find her a home with an experienced owner. You could try posting on /r/AdoptableDogs or /r/AnimalRescue. If you do make the decision to euthanize, don't beat yourself up about it. Sometimes its just what's best for them."

I would not drop her off at the county shelter. You know she bites, you know that her triggers are all over the place.   I'd call your vet and ask for a home visit to have her put down. That way you know that she won't ever be in a position to maul a child.   I was talking to a friend this weekend between classes at an agility trial. She is a trainer and she was venting at the number of dogs she has been getting lately in classes, that simply have no business being in any home at all except a very experienced dog owner home. That the local shelters have taken on the whole no kill thing to mean that any dog they take in will be adopted out.   In the past year she's had four families who had to put a dog down, and all came from the local shelters. The shelter volunteers are very well meaning and care about the dogs, but they are forgetting that many homes, while great pet homes, are not suited for dogs who severe behavior issues.   I'm sorry your family had to go thru this with Shasta. And one day if you guys decide to get another dog, I would not go back to the place that gave you Shasta. Again, I'm sure that they are well meaning, but to adopt a dog like this out to family with kids is absurd."

I don't know, I can think of a bunch of weird guesses as to why your dog might be acting weirdly, but none of it sounds helpful if you don't have the time/money to fix it regardless.  Trying to find a new home sounds like the best bet...  Maybe try contacting dog owning groups?  Like on MeetUp or something?  Just getting in contact with as many dog owners as you can.  Craigslist ads, etc."
dogs,3daw9f,JellySausage,-1,Wed Jul 15 12:57:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the update, I was wondering how you and Shasta were doing. I don't think it would be cowardly at all to take her to the shelter (rather than putting her down at home). As long as you give a very clear intake to the shelter about why you are taking her there.  It does seem as though you are trying to alleviate some of Shasta's anxiety to see if that might help? My dog has to be muzzled at the vet BTW so dogs biting vets - and also redirecting their bite energy towards the owner holding them - does happen. I think you will need to let the doggie prozac take some time before it starts working.   But I also think the muzzle is a good solution while Shasta is in the house and you are worried that she might bite your toddler. Is that what the behaviorist recommended as a temporary solution?  Also I'm pretty convinced that all the money/time/energy you have spent on Shasta has actually made her a better dog. You are probably very overwhelmed with the emotions of everything (new baby, problems with your furkid, your toddler getting bite) so please please please cut yourself some slack. I'm wondering too if because of the heightened emotions around everything, it's next to impossible for Shasta & You to relax and just be happy with one another (like how it was pre-bite). This isn't an answer to your problem, I'm just trying to be sympathetic.   Have you tried working with other rescues? I'm pretty sure that the rescue I work with doesn't take dogs with a bite history, but maybe if Shasta's bite wasn't too severe on the Dunbar scale, then you might be able to find a rescue that is willing to work with you and Shasta on finding a home with no kids. There are definitely people out there who don't want kids and want to spend all their energy on a dog. Don't give up hope on Shasta just yet! But at the same time, understand that you have a tough case on your hands and you need to cut yourself some slack. And ultimately, the best thing for you and your family and even for Shasta might be for her to go to the shelter (where at least she has a chance of finding someone who will adopt her). For example my first dog was dropped at the shelter for biting their owner's kid and me and my husband couldn't be happier with him. We don't have any kids and we are very careful whenever he is around children."
dogs,3daw9f,overpriced_popcorn,4,Wed Jul 15 19:03:59 2015 UTC,"The behavioralist recommended drugs, keeping them separate and working with her trainer at $50 an hour.   Keeping them separate means Shasta spends too much time outside which is making her anxiety worse so I think when my daughter is awake and Shasta is inside we will keep her muzzled but I also don't want to have her associate the muzzle with my kid either so they have been spending some heavily monitored time together as well. And surprisingly they still love each other and want to play together.   So I contacted a bunch of shelters and none will take her, not even the humane society. So her only option would be county and that could mean getting put down in a cold room surrounded by strangers and I would have no say. So we are going to take on rehomeing her ourselves. I talked to a person at the county shelter about what that means and it seems possible.  So hopefully we find her a home and things go alright until then. It is just super frustrating watching this dog deteriorate and having everyone you ask for help say no."
dogs,3daw9f,punstersquared,5,Tue Jul 14 23:24:35 2015 UTC,"It's really, entirely because of the challenge.  It is difficult enough to find homes for well trained, sweet dogs who love children and other pets.  Trying to home a human and animal aggressive dog is kind of a liability nightmare and takes away from dogs who are... Less difficult.   While it is super great of you to do everything you can, not many people will do the same for a dog at this level of aggression. I once asked my friend who is a trainer what to do about a dog that bites, acts aggressive, and techniques to stop it. She said ""... Put it down."""
dogs,3daw9f,overpriced_popcorn,-4,Wed Jul 15 00:00:22 2015 UTC,"What did the behaviouralist and trainer tell you?    Was it a balanced trainer, or positive only?      What are you actively doing to stop the aggression?"
dogs,3daw9f,hitler--,12,Wed Jul 15 04:01:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you're supporting use of balance training, so please accept my apologies if I'm misreading. That said, the only appropriate means of ""actively stopping the aggression"" is avoidance of triggers and use of other safety measures (e.g., muzzles). I won't get into so-called balance training for normal dogs but telling owners to use positive punishment has no place in behavioral modification of aggressive dogs. Approx. 90% of aggressive dogs are aggressive due to fear; punishment makes fear worse (how would it go over if someone yelled at you or hit you when you talked about your fears?). The other 10% are confident aggressive dogs, and using positive punishment/corrections can result in a dog who escalates the aggression. Even if correction occasionally works for a highly skilled trainer dealing with a confident dog, it is inappropriate to recommend to someone who is not experienced enough to use it with perfect timing and degree, especially when you do not know if the behavior is based in fear. It's a good way to get someone hurt even worse.

In a situation where a dog has already bitten a toddler and is continuing to display problem behavior, that would mean never letting the dog interact with children or be around them unless it is leashed and has a basket muzzle on. As I stated above, correction-based techniques are likely to INCREASE aggression.  I absolutely agree that the toddler wins over the dog every. single. time. Which is why the OP needs to listen to the professionals who have seen their dog in person and practice strict avoidance while deciding whether to proceed with behavioral modification, rehome the dog, or euthanize.  Disclaimer: I am not a veterinary behaviorist; I've just picked up some of their evidence-based wisdom from being a vet student with a special interest in behavior. In any case, the OP should listen to the person who is qualified and has actually seen their dog."
dogs,3daw9f,paulysdog,5,Wed Jul 15 01:03:08 2015 UTC,"Did I reply to your post...? No?   The other poster's implication that the OP isn't doing enough to stop the biting/nipping is an unfair guilt trip. The OP has done more than the vast majority of people would be willing to do, and has spent significant money to do that, while keeping her toddler face. To pretend like she should be doing more is straight up foolish and it puts the child at risk.  The snark about positive only vs balanced training suggests the other poster wants to see this dog punished for snapping. Continuing to push an already stressed dog by correcting it for a behavior it may not have control over (chemical imbalance, untreated pain) is a recipe for disaster and will end up with a much more serious bite when the dog can't handle the pressure.   I'm not an anti-corrections person by any means. But it is fucking dumb to take a stressed dog and stress it even more. If that training method backfires, that poor toddler will have stitches. This isn't a dog who is being a brat for getting its nails done and could deal with a simple, hey knock that shit off, verbal correction. There is a lifestyle issue (for the dog) that is causing a long term festering issue. It could be stress/anxiety, it could be chemical, it could be pain. Pretending like correcting a dog will fix one or all of those underlying issues is dangerous."
dogs,3daw9f,court67,-3,Wed Jul 15 01:58:04 2015 UTC,Meh. I'd definitely choose my dogs over any kid.
dogs,3daw9f,Durshka,8,Wed Jul 15 02:37:29 2015 UTC,Would you like to share some non-anecdotal evidence to rebut the studies provided by professionals who have to clean up the messes and testify in court when someone gets badly injured by an aggressive dog inappropriately managed?
dogs,3de2tm,grafvonorlok,3,Wed Jul 15 15:30:12 2015 UTC,"As a follow up: It happened more today so we got worried and took the dog to the vet. As it turns out it's just a reverse sneeze (which I've never heard of) and that's fairly common for dogs. More or less, it's no big deal and I feel a little silly for worrying about it... now I know though!  Just wanted to add a resolution in case it helps someone in the future searching for a similar issue."
dogs,3de2tm,leaping-elk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:20:49 2015 UTC,Glad you got it resolved! I remember the first time one of my dogs did it. I panicked super badly until I found out about reverse sneezing via a quick google search to see if I needed to take him to the ER. Lol!
dogs,3dexhf,beeonaposy,2,Wed Jul 15 19:07:12 2015 UTC,I am having great luck with Seresto this year for ticks.
dogs,3dexhf,catnip51,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:41:02 2015 UTC,"Not a vet, but here it's common to use advantix or advantage instead of the flea topical from the vets. You can ask your vet which otc is best in your area (I know Frontline doesn't work in mine)."
dogs,3dexhf,Amerlan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:10:34 2015 UTC,Ticks are horrible where I live and Jada loves to swim so topical solutions loose potency fast and can get quite pricey. Instead I have started using a home made spray made with Tea tree essential oil. Fleas and ticks hate the smell and I have yet to find one on her since I started using this. I just spray her down after her bath or when she gets out of the lake. It's cheap and best of all its natural and I don't have to worry about what chemicals my dog is absorbing.
dogs,3dexhf,serebear,3,Fri Jul 17 01:30:54 2015 UTC,You do have to worry about tea tree oil toxicity: https://www.aspca.org/about-us/faq/tea-tree-oil  I have seen neuro toxicity from it in two English bulldogs.
dogs,3dexhf,LeBluff,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:39:37 2015 UTC,Most flea/tick preventatives are OTC. I prefer Frontline Plus. I do NOT recommend Hartz products.
dogs,3dexhf,LeBluff,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:40:05 2015 UTC,"Yes it definitely does have to be diluted as pure tea tree oil is incredibly strong, and I have read in the past about tea tree toxicity and also that if diluted properly is safe for use on dogs. I have however used this spray on multiple dogs over the years and never had a problem.  The spray that I use is 1-2 drops for 10oz of water so it is also fairly diluted.  I am not a vet, this is just something I have found to work for me. I have already had to pull multiple ticks from dogs this year from other dogs but thankfully none from my own (no one around here has heard of a tick key apparently)"
dogs,3deuh7,Kimmberlias,11,Wed Jul 15 18:45:57 2015 UTC,"Next time that happens get the phone number off the pugs collar and call the owners. It's not often that you can DO something about this, in this case you 100% can"

dogs,3deuh7,stormeegedon,3,Wed Jul 15 23:23:25 2015 UTC,"I don't have any dog walker stories, but we have one who frequents our dog park and it just makes me so dang nervous! You can't possibly be able to watch that many dogs at any given time! Never mind there's a 3 dog limit per person for that exact reason. The dogs are all well behaved and tend to just stick near her, but it worries me when there's a dog that doesn't have a person's attention at least part of the time it's there."
dogs,3deuh7,stormeegedon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:09:34 2015 UTC,the second walker (the one that grabbed the pug) always has a lab mix with her that'll rip our treat bags out of  our hands. She doesn't even notice he's halfway across the park with us most of the time. You need to pay attention to dogs in these situations at all times. Parks are crazy places
dogs,3deuh7,n0diggity,2,Wed Jul 15 23:27:13 2015 UTC,"To be fair, you shouldn't have treats at the dog park for this reason. You end up attracting unwanted solicitors lol."
dogs,3deuh7,CaptainHelium,2,Thu Jul 16 01:25:40 2015 UTC,"That's true, but I honestly don't care (as long as dogs are behaving, if they aren't they get put away) I need to bring kibble to help my pup learn recall in high stimulus areas :)"
dogs,3deuh7,treacledormouse,3,Thu Jul 16 02:29:30 2015 UTC,"Oh man that's just the worst, that poor pug :( I'm a dog walker in a suburb near San Francisco and I constantly see walkers who have too many dogs and no control over them. I limit myself to 3 on a walk (really even that depends on the dogs I bring) and 4 at the park/off leash hikes. If I tried to do more the dogs and myself would feel overwhelmed. It's just not worth it. There's a dog beach near me, Fort Funston, where I've seen numerous dog walkers running on the beach trying to find dogs that they brought."

dogs,3deuh7,HundRetter,3,Wed Jul 15 23:24:37 2015 UTC,"I dog walk too.  I never ever go to dog parks or let my dogs off leash (except for like 2 that I know will stick with me), too many liabilities.  That and insurance won't cover me if the dogs are off leash and something happens.  I also limit myself to 3 at a time, maybe 4 small guys if they are good together.  I did accidentally drop off a dog to the wrong house once though lol.  The two owners and dogs knew each other so it was ok, but the phone call of ""Glad to see everyone had a great time together, but why is  ___ here visiting?""  was an equal mix of embarrassing and funny."

dogs,3dcmio,oddible,2,Wed Jul 15 10:23:18 2015 UTC,You should get in touch with the family as quickly as possible and let them know the situation. A visit to the family's vet is warranted at the very least. As far as permission to put her down if the family vet thinks she's suffering and your unable to contact the family then have it done. I can't believe someone would leave a dog this sick with you and not have an emergency plan.
dogs,3derz2,abcdefg123zx,5,Wed Jul 15 18:28:31 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't disagree with you if you put the dog down, but I think some of your reasons aren't entirely solid.   He just now walked up to my aunt and put his head in her lap, when she went to pet him he started snapping in the air infront of him as if to bite her   Why was he even allowed to do this? If you know he's going to get snappy, keep him on a leash and away from people, or put him in a room, or a crate. My childhood dog was a bitch and only liked being pet in certain spots by certain people. She never bit, but she would do this too.    when she gets bigger and friends come over, its going to be a nightmare   So you put the dog away. I wouldn't trust anything other than the best dogs around strange kids.    I have taken him to a trainer for 3 months, fully boarded him there.   Board and train programs can be great or they can be horrible. You never know how someone is treating your dog, and you're not learning how to work with them.    I took him to a behaviorist    Is this a licensed behaviorist? How did you find them? I ask because there are a lot of people who enjoy calling themselves behaviorists but are not licensed as such. A veterinary behaviorist is the real deal. Anything else is someone using a term they have no right to be using. If they were the real deal then absolutely take their opinion into deep consideration, but if they're just a trainer who is pretending to be a behaviorist, then maybe consider talking to someone else.   What was your plan? Are you waiting until you have the baby to make a decision, or did you plan to put him down before she's born? What does your wife think?"
dogs,3derz2,therobbo91,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:49:30 2015 UTC,"Sorry I should have gone more in-depth. He doesn't go after people if they ignore him, so we don't crate him when its 1 or 2 people over. He usually calms down after a little and starts bringing his toys to the new people. Yeah he should have been crated, I agree. He doesn't always get snappy is the problem, hes unpredictable.   We visited while the dog was being trained to do lessons on handling him and after the lessons ended. We used a very reputable trainer with high reviews and great success stories, that's why he was boarded was due to the distance. What they taught him was to heel, sit, stay, come, lay down on command without treats. He does this excellent. Unless hes overly excited. Hes also trained on a shock collar (I know people are against it, but I tried it on myself and its really better than a choker in my opinion) but when he sees another dog and wants to get to it, 50 on the shock collar doesnt even phase him. Hes a 80lb bulldog.   The behaviorist was recommended from my vet, they are licensed and very well regarded.  As far as plan, my wife is very emotional right now and has asthma, last time the dog tried to bite me when i put my foot near him when he was sleeping and we discussed this she had a bad asthma attack which is no good in her situation. I am waiting until the baby is out to seriously bring this up to her, I dont want to make an emotional decision before the baby is here."
dogs,3derz2,therobbo91,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:39:00 2015 UTC,"heel, sit, stay, come, lay down   It took them three months to do this? I'm not trying to sound mean but a good trainer could do that in a couple of visits spread out over a few weeks. I'm not going to get into the shock collar thing but I've heard plenty of bad stories about how they're used in board and train programs and think they should be a last resort, especially since as you've experienced, they don't always work. Good to know the behaviorist was legitimate.   I know it must be a really emotional time for both of you right now but it's probably not going to be less emotional any time soon. Once you have the baby there's going to be the elation that goes along with that, plus the sleep deprivation that will probably make you even more frustrated with the dog than you would under normal circumstances.   I looked up the breeder... they seem great at marketing and focusing on stupid things like merle coloring but I don't see much that's good about them. You could try contacting them and letting them know that one of their dogs is in this position but I'm not sure they'd do much."

dogs,3derz2,therobbo91,2,Wed Jul 15 20:15:17 2015 UTC,Barf.
dogs,3derz2,stormeegedon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:50:40 2015 UTC,"it was also how to walk on the leash, he knew a lot of these commands before but its really ironed into him now. It doesnt matter what hes doing if I give him one of the commands he does it."
dogs,3derz2,stormeegedon,2,Wed Jul 15 19:55:08 2015 UTC,"It obviously does matter what he's doing as you said hitting him with the shock collar doesn't deter him from going after another dog.  Look, I shock collar conditioned my dog, so I'm not about to judge others who do so as well. But if your dog is not responding to it, he's not conditioned to it. The idea of the collar is a tool to break the dog's focus and get their attention to you or to communicate when they cannot hear you. 3 months to collar train is just barely touching the surface and your dog more than likely is not 100% conditioned to that collar. Never mind that, I see no use for you to have a shock collar anyway. Your dog cannot be trusted off leash, so what reason do you have to be using one?"
dogs,3derz2,stormeegedon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:06:14 2015 UTC,"3month was the boarding, ive continued it myself with his instructions. It works well, unless hes trying to go after another dog or person. I think his adrenaline is just very high and with the loose skin it doesnt phase him so hard, if I put it up to 70/80 when he gets like that, he comes to me. I just feel bad doing that."
dogs,3derz2,therobbo91,3,Wed Jul 15 20:27:27 2015 UTC,"But why is he being put in positions where he's off leash in public anyway? You are literally setting him up for failure here.   You can try to write it off all you want, but if he's ignoring the collar he isn't conditioned to it. If you have to crank it up to an 80, then do it. What's the point of the collar if you don't? Do not trust him off leash with the collar until you can 100% have him return to you without him wavering."
dogs,3derz2,snoralax,-2,Wed Jul 15 20:35:55 2015 UTC,"He's on the leash with the shock collar. I used to use both a choker and the shock, but he has sensitive skin and his neck was getting damaged badly, so now I hook up the leash to the shock collar. He almost always gives slack on the leash, doesn't pull ever (unless theres another dog anyway) I don't trust my wife to walk this dog."
dogs,3derz2,stormeegedon,4,Thu Jul 16 02:16:40 2015 UTC,"That's...no, that's exactly how you don't use a shock collar. Have you done any conditioning in the slightest with this dog and the collar? What do you think the dog things when he starts pulling towards another dog and he gets pain? Have you don't anything to make the collar a positive experience for him? Did you tie in a command at all? It's situations like this, where a shock collar that can do more bad than good, that makes people think e-dollars are all bad no matter who uses them. Drop the collar, it's clearly not helping you and I highly doubt it ever will."
dogs,3derz2,stormeegedon,-2,Thu Jul 16 02:25:43 2015 UTC,"Come on, you think I just shock my dog randomly? He gets given a command twice, if he doesnt listen he gets a 'No' and at the same time a shock, then the command again. If he doesnt listen he gets a 'No' + command again with the shock starting at the no and I slowly increase the power of the shock until he responds while repeating the command. Of course I praise him when he listens. The dog pulled on the choker which has a safety until he started coughing from lack of air, he just goes mental when he wants to get to something, at least the collar when its high enough makes him stop."
dogs,3derz2,treacledormouse,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:46:28 2015 UTC,"Yep, punishment can do that. But you just said yourself he doesn't if he's too excited or if he wants to get to another dog..."
dogs,3derz2,je_taime,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:49:32 2015 UTC,What the heck? How do you even get a dominant color like merle? They say that they're not crossed with anything but I'm really skeptical that would be possible without doing so. Not an honest breeder.
dogs,3derz2,je_taime,3,Wed Jul 15 22:14:04 2015 UTC,"He has never purposely bitten someone   He has never purposely bitten someone yet. This is an important distinction. Your dog is still young and has many years ahead of him to where he could easily bite and seriously injure someone.   I have taken him to a trainer for 3 months, fully boarded him there.   3 months is a very small amount of time to fix a problem like this. Especially if you are fully boarding him elsewhere. It is very, very important to understand that in addition to your dog being trained, you need to be trained as well. This is training you will be doing every day for the rest of your dog's life and no one can just take him into their workshop and fix him. Get a new trainer who will work in your home with you.   I took him to a behaviorist and she said that he will most likely never change    You need to try a new behaviorist. One that is willing to work with you before calling your dog a lost cause.   and the only thing we can do is manage him and not put him in a position to fail.   She isn't exactly wrong here. You do need to learn to manage him and you do need to learn how to keep him in safe environments. Letting him interact with your aunt was setting him up for failure.   I know that my dog will learn to love her like he does me and my wife   No. No you do not. If you leave this untreated, you could end up with an injured/dead child, and a dog on it's way to be euthanized because you thought he would adjust.   but we will never trust them alone.   Frankly, you should never trust them supervised either. That dog should never come into contact with that baby as he is now.   My grandfather always said its better to put down aggressive dogs   If, after spending more time with a trainer, behaviorist, and vet, and they all agree euthanasia is the best option, then yes, it would be better. Some dogs are bred so poorly, they do come out biologically and chemically wrong and incapable of being trusted.  Look, you're on the right track. You got a behaviorist and a trainer involved and discussed options with your vet. But it doesn't sound like you got the right trainer and a behaviorist capable of this level of difficulty. Give it one more shot, and in the mean time, do not let your dog socialize with other people unless with a trainer."
dogs,3derz2,bulborb,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:56:26 2015 UTC,"I replied to some similar stuff in another comment. I made sure to take them to a very reputable trainer and behaviorist. We did work with the dog while he was there every weekend and after his boarding was done on how to handle. I haven't stopped working the dog since, he stays at my side when we walk and I feel very in control when hes on the leash, but if someone comes to pet him and I dont stop them, they may lose a hand.  I guess im just wondering when is it enough, the dogs only 2 and its been heartbreaking and expensive. Its a life I have taken responsibility for so I will do what is needed, but at some point I feel like im throwing away money."
dogs,3derz2,bulborb,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:44:37 2015 UTC,"I think this dog was very poorly bred and may have a lot more problems than humans can interven with. But I also think you're doing a good thing and weighing your options as this is a life on the line. I personally think it's worth getting a second trainer and behaviorist to get their opinions. When it comes to a trainer, look specifically for someone who deals with aggressive dogs. There are a lot of trainers out there that specialize with pit bulls, so they may be a good start as they are powerful dogs that often are dog aggressive so they should be better prepared than a trainer who teaches basic obedience."
