darkestdungeon,3e3s02,JDGumby,3,Tue Jul 21 19:01:35 2015 UTC,"Bourassa, if you're reading this... your art is incredible. I'm constantly struck by how amazing it is while playing. Just... continually thinking of how incredibly atmospheric and thematic and gorgeous it is. So kudos. The article is right - DD would be nothing without the presentation (no offense intended to the systems designers). The glorious trifecta of your art, Chatwood's music, and June's narration - they make the game the masterpiece it is.  I love the gameplay too. It gets an 8/10 or so. But the presentation... it's an 11/10 at least. Just absolutely perfect."
darkestdungeon,3e3s02,WyMANderly,3,Tue Jul 21 23:55:19 2015 UTC,Amen.  Darkest Dungeon probably has the most interesting and addictive aesthetic of any game I've ever played.  It's the only game that has art that I would actually consider having tattooed on me somewhere.
darkestdungeon,3e3s02,Thalnagath,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:46:58 2015 UTC,I probably wouldn't have given this game a second look had I not seen the artwork.  It's absolutely perfect for the theme and the mood.  At 64 hours played it's still fun to look at.

darkestdungeon,3e30id,omiz144,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:53:45 2015 UTC,"That would be pretty cool, assuming it's at all possible in the code. It'd probably take some really heavy balancing to make it work right, though. Doing something like granting Highwayman access to Blight could cause some awkward balance problems, like making Graverobbers irrelevant.   With respect to current trinkets, I feel like the game should be focusing on making more viable trinket loadouts for the endgame. A lot of trinkets right now, even ones with higher rarities, just don't feel particularly worth it, and endgame loadouts tend to gravitate toward the power combos like Legendary Bracer/Focus Ring or Sun gear. I'd like some attention given toward buffing current trinkets that aren't used all that often."
darkestdungeon,3e30id,Obselescence,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:16:24 2015 UTC,"Trinket balance is even worse now that the Legendary Bracer, Focus Ring, and Tough Ring all got nerfed."
darkestdungeon,3e30id,Kittonberry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:01:22 2015 UTC,I would prefer trinkets to have all positive stats and be much more rare. As it is now I don't find any worth using...
darkestdungeon,3e30id,DecafTable,2,Tue Jul 21 18:46:24 2015 UTC,You can combine trinkets to get net positive stats.
darkestdungeon,3e30id,DecafTable,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:29:36 2015 UTC,"Wait a minute, can you go into more detail? I've never heard this before?"
darkestdungeon,3e30id,Obselescence,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:14:00 2015 UTC,"I think they mean that some trinkets have good synergies with each other because their positives counteract each others' negatives. Pre-update Legendary Bracer/Focus Ring used to be the best example of this, with fairly negligible penalties in exchange for net boosts to damage, accuracy, and crit rate.  Post-update Legendary Bracer/Focus Ring aren't quite as good in that regard. I can't really think of any other combos right now that synergize like that. Maybe Sun Ring/Cloak."
darkestdungeon,3e30id,Clockwerk88,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:55:17 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see trinkets change the way some skills work. Half the damage for double the bleed on the HWM. A trinket that gives the plague-doctor's blight less damage, but triggers each time the blight is renewed are two examples I can think of."
darkestdungeon,3e50aj,Thalnagath,4,Wed Jul 22 00:25:01 2015 UTC,"The devs presumably don't want you getting away with easy HP/stress heals at any point in a dungeon run -- whether in-battle or out of it. It's a big part of the game's goal to be hard, which means no free lunches."
darkestdungeon,3e50aj,Obselescence,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:32:25 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know - the game would be too easy and too ""YOU MUST BRING A HEALER EVERY TIME"" if you could heal outside of combat.  I'm just saying it's goofy to penalize players for utilizing gameplay mechanics to use those heals when the opportunity presents itself.  If it really became problematic they could just strengthen the post-stunned buff to make it very difficult to chain-stun someone."
darkestdungeon,3e50aj,CurlTheFruitBat,2,Wed Jul 22 00:45:20 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's pretty in line with their philosophy. The one or two times the characters have called me on it they said something to the effect of ""we shouldn't loiter here. Something worse will find us."" And I'd say chain Occ dmg debuff is better these days if you really want to stall =)"
darkestdungeon,3e50aj,BarlesChronson,2,Wed Jul 22 01:35:08 2015 UTC,"I think as long as the NMEs are bleeded/blighted they do not complain. Not confirmed, just from my experience with the latest patch."
darkestdungeon,3e50aj,MileyCyrus8,2,Wed Jul 22 00:26:33 2015 UTC,"I just realized this the other day. I was stun-locking a mob pretty much trying to get some cheap heals in. I think once you hit round 7, you start stressing out more."
darkestdungeon,3e5j3k,Kayrajh,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:59:30 2015 UTC,"Seems best in a bleed based setup with his aoe bleed attack, in my somewhat limited experience. I've had success with him as a frontliner or backliner with a jester, healer, tank/dps. Obviously different attack setups for either position, but the aoe bleed has been incredibly useful. Works really really well with a jester who's also spamming aoe bleeds. Mobile dps/tank helps as well, since HM has no repositioning abilities."
darkestdungeon,3e5j3k,VerdammtesAutomat,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:12:11 2015 UTC,"Underpowered: yes. He is a support hero and has the least damage of anyone.  But he has his uses. Stress heal, both in combat and camp. Lowering enemy PROT %, inflicting DOT, and a straight stun move, which are three of three ways to get around PROT. Plus his self-heal and dodge-protect, which makes it possible for him to be a dodge tank. Plus, Hound's Rush does bonus Beast damage, so between that and Hound's Harry's bleed, he's nice for the Weald."
darkestdungeon,3e3lay,sirmidor,3,Tue Jul 21 18:16:09 2015 UTC,We already know what the Cove and the Darkest Dungeon are going to look like. Someone with image editing skills could probably put together what a typical Cove/Darkest Dungeon hallway could look like. Just look in dungeons/cove or dungeons/darkestdungeon.
darkestdungeon,3e3lay,CheshireWolf,2,Tue Jul 21 21:29:40 2015 UTC,"There is a pastebin with unused lines from the dialogue file.  http://pastebin.com/syPn4zex The most interesting to me are the ""hobby"" lines. They give a little insight into what kind of things the heroes enjoy.  Even early on DD's early access run, these lines where there in the camping section, but whatever hobby does, hasn't seem to be implemented so far.   They made sure to add in lines for the Arbalest, Houndmaster, and Man-At-Arms, so I don't think they've abandoned whatever hobby is supposed to be."
darkestdungeon,3e58yl,igomadness,2,Wed Jul 22 01:36:24 2015 UTC,"Any straight buff that fits with the character, like the ones you listed. Eagle Eye, Natural Swing/Eye, etc. Those and Hatreds."
darkestdungeon,3e58yl,bfgod,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:45:29 2015 UTC,"Warrior of Light, Early Riser, and Unerring are my lock-ins for my mono-Houndmaster squad. Unerring boosts Houndmaster's main damage moves, and Early Riser + Warrior of Light synergize pretty well together -- doubly so with a Sun Ring on.   Add a Spiked Collar and some Rabies on top (Acc penalty counteracted by the Sun Ring), and it comes out to something like a +65% damage bonus in high light conditions. Plus a little extra speed from Early Riser to make sure everything dies before it can get a hit off."
darkestdungeon,3e58yl,Obselescence,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:49:32 2015 UTC,"In addition to what others have said...  Unyielding (+10% deathblow resist), Fated (some misses = hits), Hard Skinned (innate PROT!), Hard Noggin (stun resist). These are good pretty much everywhere.  The regional traits are not that exciting themselves, but when you have something like Unholy Slayer + Ruins Tactician, that's a big deal.  Any class that uses PROT much really benefits from bleed/blight resistance. Move resist is good on classes you don't want sliding around, like the Vestal."

darkestdungeon,3e51ag,Enduratrum,3,Wed Jul 22 00:33:41 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd want someone who is good at the game and could teach me how to get better. That being said, I would still want them to take risks to make their gameplay more entertaining. I wouldn't want them to just play it safe all the time and win that way because I feel that would be a little boring."
darkestdungeon,3e51ag,seebeeL,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:56:07 2015 UTC,"The problem with someone good at the game is that they make it look so easy. I've been watching one person and they do the buffs, get the criticals, leave the dungeon with little stress. Any negative quirks aren't too debilitating.  So I'm like, ""I could do that!"" Start up a game. A short level to clear out 90% of the rooms. After the first battle, all my characters are at half strength and half stress. The level ends one of 2 ways - either I succeed the objective minus one character and one character maxed out in stress. Or I exit without completing the objective with all my characters, and because I exited early, everyone gets maxed stress (They should have an Oprah-like character for those situations with a dialog box saying ""And you get max stress! And you get max stress! Everyone gets max stress!)."
darkestdungeon,3e4lb7,The_Intense_Pickle,2,Tue Jul 21 22:26:51 2015 UTC,"I love that the Houndmaster got ruins phobe after this misadventure.

Just no."""

darkestdungeon,3e1xfy,Arekasune,12,Tue Jul 21 09:25:37 2015 UTC,I mean you could just not use it. I've never done that. I just fight through being surprised. The only time I retreat is if I intend on abandoning the quest entirely.
darkestdungeon,3e1xfy,Matthias_The_Warrior,5,Tue Jul 21 11:19:53 2015 UTC,"Hm, how about this? If the enemy is surprised, you can retreat for no cost. If someone is afflicted, retreat rolls as per normal in such a case.  If you're surprised, you must wait until all enemies have moved once to retreat. If you retreat when neither party is surprised, failed retreats scramble your party. Greater risk involved, so it's either attempt a retreat when the party is strong, or risk party scramble and wipe."
darkestdungeon,3e1xfy,poiyurt,2,Tue Jul 21 10:01:39 2015 UTC,"Something like this would be a nice modification. My submission would be as follows:  Retreat could essentially be a move and have a base probability of 20% for each character that uses it, with the escape attempt assessed at the end of the round. So if you're desperate to escape, you can give up everyone's turn, take what damage comes, and have a solid 80% chance to flee. To be harsher, you could put a debuff (- dodge chance seems appropriate) on every character that uses the flee option, so not committing fully can really screw you and the enemy's attacks on your fleeing party are more likely to have dire effects.  To compensate a little for this, the debuff would only last one round, so if you're locked into the fight you're not toast. Alternately, the game could allow multiple escape attempts but with the debuff stacking up each time. A consumable could also be used to increase the escape probability (+20%) so if you're willing to sacrifice inventory space, you can get guaranteed escapes.  edit: The other nice thing is that it would make it so that you could almost certainly always retreat if you surprised the enemy, since you have a whole free turn to make everyone use the ""Flee"" move.  You could also throw in quirks that add and subtract retreat chance, of course."
