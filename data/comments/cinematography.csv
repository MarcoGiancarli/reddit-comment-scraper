cinematography,3e5rn1,Raichu93,6,Wed Jul 22 04:15:05 2015 UTC,not much critique since these are pretty great cinematic stills. May I ask what you're shooting with?
cinematography,3e5rn1,blueballs4ever,3,Wed Jul 22 04:23:40 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks! I'm using a Sony A7s, with two adapted normal range lenses. This series was supposed to be focused on framing people closer up. Wide shots are for a different time.  1,2, 3, and 4 are the Voigtlander VM 40mm/f1.4. Might be my favourite lens of all time.  5,6, 7, and 8 are with the Minolta MD 50mm/f1.7, wich is only $20 on eBay!"
cinematography,3e5rn1,Townsie,4,Wed Jul 22 04:29:33 2015 UTC,"ya these are sick. i'd say you taught yourself well. are any of these lit? i know you said candid, but these are so gorgeous"
cinematography,3e5rn1,erichhaubrich,3,Wed Jul 22 06:06:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. I like street style, which means I enjoy ""finding"" good lighting rather than creating it. So no added lighting, everything here is just shot just using the restrictions of available light. So when I thought it was coincidentally pleasant lighting, I pulled out my camera. DP's like Chivo inspire me to try things like that, and the best part is you can do it while hanging out with friends."

I guess the one thing that holds me back aside from the price tag is the rolling shutter. Do you shoot in APS-C mode much to negate that, or have you not really found it to be an issue?"

cinematography,3e5rxp,erichhaubrich,2,Wed Jul 22 05:56:59 2015 UTC,"Absolutely beautiful.  I've been thinking for quite some time that game engines need to be used not only for previs but for making actual films.  One of my dreams is to start a small company that makes films and TV shows using engines like Unreal 4. Possibly with motion capture performances and some top grade facial animators using the easiest and best tools available.  I think it'd be a perfect way to visualise a whole bunch of the great fantasy and Sci Fi series' and individual books I've read throughout my life but which don't have the popularity or budget for large scale live action productions.  I myself am an almost graduated film student and have taken a 3D fundamentals class during my final semester. Using Maya I've been able to create an extremely basic animation and know that it's not a career path I can realistically pursue, but with talented artists and a great game engine I reckon I could help produce some really great quality stuff.  Seeing this has made me really think I should start exploring this as a real possibility."

cinematography,3e0d4i,smegasaurus,3,Tue Jul 21 03:07:21 2015 UTC,"same, i found it distracting in this instance. the work was so so so so so beautiful though."
cinematography,3e0d4i,Townsie,3,Tue Jul 21 03:42:25 2015 UTC,"I think it was the right choice.  I don't see how it is distracting in anyway since if you watch it on vimeo, it's as if there are no bars at all.  Also, a few seconds in there is a aspect ratio change to a square for a little bit.  I think it looks much better surrounded by white space than for it to be surrounded in black space, which would completely hide the square aspect ratio, and then you have a white space (The website) around that black space"
cinematography,3e0d4i,Namisaur,2,Tue Jul 21 04:46:16 2015 UTC,"This really only works if you're watching it as it's embedded on the Vimeo page. If you full screen, it loses the effect. Especially so if your screen isn't 16:9 ratio, you'll have black and white bars. I thought the aspect ratio change was kinda cool but honestly that footage could be cut from the reel and I wouldn't miss it too much. (The shot of the water in the doorway was cool)  Did I just see Guy Pearce at 1:00 and 1:16?"

cinematography,3dy8ri,TekAzurik,5,Mon Jul 20 15:45:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah same, I would have thought he would go with the new Arri 65mm sensor camera."
cinematography,3dy8ri,joe_1989,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:45:36 2015 UTC,exactly. Though that does drastically limit your lens options. I'm not sure if he has a favorite set but that would certainly effect the decision.
cinematography,3dy8ri,TekAzurik,2,Mon Jul 20 21:50:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah the lens options would be pretty small. I feel like he is enjoying the freedom of digital, so cropping in post on shots he isn't happy with doesn't work on a lower res camera like Alexa. I remember him saying somewhere that he didn't like shooting film because he lost sleep over if it would come out okay, adding the safety net of post changes might be a nice idea to him. I believe he has used Red cameras for special effects shots before too, because of its high k sensor, so it might be listed because of that. pre visualisation of shots might happen well before starting actor filming."
cinematography,3dy8ri,joe_1989,2,Mon Jul 20 22:04:44 2015 UTC,maybe he had a long talk with Fincher and Cronenweth? i'm just a lowly wedding photographer but cropping a great 10MP image out of poorly framed 25MP master is pretty awesome.

cinematography,3dy8ri,pimpedoutjedi,4,Mon Jul 20 15:52:32 2015 UTC,I read he he sees choosing a digital camera like choosing film stock. Each one has different characteristics that may benefit what you are trying to the screen.
cinematography,3dy8ri,SundayExperiment,3,Mon Jul 20 18:56:36 2015 UTC,"this is the only reason to select any camera over another or film over digital.  It's a tool.  Or better put, it is a paintbrush, there are many kinds of brushes but only the one thats for the job is the right one."
cinematography,3dy8ri,10per,2,Mon Jul 20 19:29:44 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely. Each camera offers something unique compared to another camera. I think why people are so surprised is because Deakins has shot Alexa for many years now, and we're curious to know why he's justifying this one. Also with a name as prolific as his, it can easily turn heads."
cinematography,3dy8ri,SundayExperiment,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:17:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I never understood people that get all caught up in one system being ""better"" than another."
cinematography,3dy8ri,supercontroller,2,Mon Jul 20 19:47:15 2015 UTC,it's not that the Alexa is necessarily better (altho I think many would say it is) but on Roger Deakins' forum he talks about why he likes the Alexa over the Red cameras.  He's used the Alexa and the same LUT on his last 5 films. So I'm really curious why he'd switch to RED.
cinematography,3dy8ri,SmokinMonkey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:06:06 2015 UTC,"He's stated that the reason that he's shot on alexa, was that the conversion from switching from film to digital felt right with an alexa, and he felt the image quality still resonated well compared to film stock.  I haven't seen any footage from the camera, or touched it, but something must click with him for him to want to use it."
cinematography,3dy8ri,AndyJarosz,2,Tue Jul 21 01:09:36 2015 UTC,I'm wondering if the rumour is somehow coming from RED or Ridley Scott. Ridley's obviously producing Blade Runner 2 and all of his films  back to Prometheus have been shot on RED.
cinematography,3dy8ri,supercontroller,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:46:13 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. This could be his first 3D film according to IMDB.   I check out Roger's forum a lot and he seems very pro ARRI.  He's going back to film for Hail Caesar:   The subject of 'Hail Caesar' is 1952 Hollywood so film did seem the right choice. Frankly, I was split but the brothers felt film was the better option and they wanted the grain and 'imperfections' it would bring to the images."
cinematography,3dy8ri,sb4l,6,Mon Jul 20 15:51:53 2015 UTC,IMDb info can be sketchy. Would wait until the studio's press controler has gotten ahold of the actual data.

But according to Roger that fell through.  When someone asked Roger why he isn't shooting Denis Villeneuve's next film.   Bradford Young, who is a great talent, is shooting that film. I was supposed to be shooting 'Africa' with Angelina Jolie but that has fallen apart."

If all you have is residential style power you definitely don't have a 3 phase 400amp tie in, and that's not just something you get by renting a power distro.  You have to rent a trailer generator that can give you that power, and there has to be the G&E crew that knows how to operate it (which I would hope they have a capable Best Boy Electric if their asking for this)."

cinematography,3dw6k3,DurtyKurty,2,Mon Jul 20 02:08:32 2015 UTC,"Are you responsible for the tie in being done? Are you hiring an electrician to come do that? You'll need an additional generator and additional cable to get your guys the extra 200amps they need if the max load for the tie in on that building is 400amps. If you are planning on renting a generator for the additional load, why not just get a larger genny to cover the entire power load and forgo the tie in. It might actually be cheaper."

cinematography,3du5y0,smegasaurus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:33:46 2015 UTC,"So first off, an awesome clip, far better than my first music video I can promise you that.  Couple things I felt overall before I get into a couple specifics.  In the first third and the last third, I felt like there were a lot of unmotivated camera movements, your slider stuff was cool just alot of the pans I would have considered better stationary.  Most of the piece felt a little underlit. Not dark but under lit. A little more light to define some key features or a little more contrast would have been nice. The dinner table sequence suffered from this most of all.  A couple little things to have maybe thought about.  at 28 seconds as they enter the apartment the line of action is broken and this feels a little too jarring.  Many of the opening shots felt a little too long.  The dinner table sequence felt like it really needed some more coverage, a couple more angles of the action because in its current state it didn't really sell to me.  Your close up stuff, specifically the headshots were very very nice, the shot at around 2:15 was especially beautiful and quite masterfully composed.  And that ending shot managed to save the end sequence for me, top marks on that one.  Over all like I said its very well put together, I only really have a few minor issues with it, you can tell this isn't a 10K clip but for whatever money you had, you've done quite well."

The biggest thing I learned from this, which addresses quite a few of your points, is the importance of pre-production. We could have done so much more in the planning stage that would have resulted in a much more polished product. Stuff like camera movement and shot length are things I'll definitely try to commit more thought into in the future.   Have heard multiple people say similar things about the dinner sequence, totally agree. Needed more angles and I think I should have pushed the female actor a little more in her responses. Or perhaps just blocked it out more comprehensively, that scene ended up being a bit spontaneous. Really glad you liked the end sequence, I was pretty worried we didn't quite sell it enough. And yeah, definitely not 10k haha, closer to $300. Again, thanks for the detailed feedback"

Especially because I like to shoot directly into the sunlight like a madman. It's excellent for getting all the working elements together very quickly.   edit: mostly because I almost always shoot at 1/50th because I like the standard looking motion blur, adjustable ND allows you to find balance very quickly using the meter at the bottom of the screen on the gh3   edit 2: although I don't really trust the meter sometimes, do you? Because sometimes it says zero but it looks really bright to me."

cinematography,3dqw9h,Ok_Lumberjack,11,Sat Jul 18 16:16:21 2015 UTC,"A sad truth is that producers rarely take risks; admitting a mental health issue is admitting a risk to their production.  Being a cinematographer is like running your own business. This may sound harsh, but you can't blame mistakes on your disease. Believe it or not, there are numerous cinematographer with your same condition (some even worse) that do their best to manage their mental health while on gigs.  This industry runs on referrals and recommendations. When people ""blow up"" on set in an angry way, your name won't get passed around in a positive light. Anger and negativity will be the death of anyone's career (especially for below the line positions like DP's). No one will want to hire you if other producers tell them how you chewed out a PA for a stupid reason. Sure the cause was your bipolar disorder, but it doesn't excuse the fact that you caused drama on set and yelled at a crew member. (Both things producers want to avoid)  It's going to be hard and challenging for you, but you have to focus on pushing away emotion while on set. Focus on what you've planned, never take anything personally, and always think before you act. Film sets are stressful, especially the longer they are. But for the sake of your career, you must do your best to keep your emotions under control. It's nearly difficult because of your disease, but producer's won't care. They want to minimize risk at all costs.  I hope this helps and I hope I haven't come across as insensitive."

You will have to dramatically change your outlook and perspective to even be given another chance in this industry. If your personality or emotional state cannot handle the high stress of running a film shoot, then stay far away and look for another profession.

cinematography,3dmq32,howdareyou,28,Fri Jul 17 15:02:07 2015 UTC,"Really great looking trailer although I highly doubt Chivo will be seeing a 3rd Oscar this year. Nothing against him (He has one of the most prominent styles out of any working DP right now and God is his work beautiful) but If you look at some of the other acclaimed cinematographers that have films releasing this year he is definitely going to have some stiff competition.   First off, Deakins has already received lots of hype for his work on Sicario at Cannes. If you want to bring academy politics into the argument he is the DiCaprio of cinematography when it comes to receiving the statue and I think they can only keep him waiting so much longer without hurting their own credibility. But as I stated before there's so much competition we must wait and see before we can judge.  Furthermore, you have Kaminski back again with Spielberg on Bridge of Spies. He is the only living DP with an Oscar for color (saving pvt. Ryan) and black and white (Schindler's List) work and anything with his name on it seems to find its way into the nominations list. If you're into comparing styles, Chivos work on Children of Men seems to draw heavily on the look Kaminski created for Private Ryan, which seems very present in this first look at The Revenant. In my opinion If Chivo were to win a statue for this aggressive, natural long take style in a war setting he would have won for Children of Men. I think he won for Gravity and Birdman because he took that style and applied it in realms we've never seen before. It's great that he's bringing it full circle back into the battle adventure movie but I don't know if it will break as much ground as his two previous films therefore hurting his chances.   Now, if we're talking about breaking ground, we have to bring up Richardson's work on Tarantino's upcoming Hateful 8. I was lucky enough to attend a screening of test shots for the film and the aesthetics of this movie look as epic as the movie is hyped up to be. First off they're shooting Panavision 70mm. They're using vintage anamorphic lenses 50+ years old that were complete rehoused and redesigned for this production. If I recall correctly, The lenses are 1.3x anamorphics and when paired with the 70mm format will create an aspect ratio somewhere near 2.7 x 1 (I'll try to dig up an article to varify these specs). The wide landscape shots shown at the screening were like nothing I had ever seen before. It reminded me of the wide shots in the classic western of the likes of Sergio Leone, but with quality of today's film stocks the image was truly something special. I can go on about the lens flares, the softness of the vintage lenses paired with the large format film, etc. but without even seeing a trailer I can already tell this will be one of the most visually groundbreaking films this year. On top of this, Tarantino has announced he will outfit 50 cinemas nationwide with brand new 70mm projectors equipped with the proper lenses to project this format. I don't know if I've ever been this excited to stare at a screen for 3 hours :-)  Anyway sorry for straying away from the Revenant, but this is really an exciting year for the art of cinematography!"

cinematography,3dmq32,howtospeak,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:35:51 2015 UTC,"I think Speilberg has nothing to prove as a filmmaker. He's shown us that he is just as capable a storyteller as he is a businessman. Where his focus is now a days is for everyone to judge for themselves but you have to respect the fact that he is still making films that he wants to make. Kaminski always says his goal as a DP is to serve the story. In every world Speilberg explores Kaminski does a wonderful job of adapting to new challenges. Post Saving Private Ryan, Kaminski did Catch Me If You Can (a dramatic period comedy) and Minority Report (a futuristic scifi thriller) in the same year which shows how undoubtedly versatile he can be. Even Kaminski's work on recent Speilberg projects such as Warhorse is as visually stunning as any of his work in my opinion. It would be foolish to write off such a dynamic duo, when their combined filmography encompasses some of the most critically acclaimed and successful movies over multiple decades."

It's all politics after all.  And if you're interested in more info on Hateful 8 look up the test shot presentation at cinegear 2015. That's what I attended.

Could be a narrower aperture   :/"
cinematography,3dmq32,d_russ,3,Fri Jul 17 18:26:27 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Larger sensor = larger FOV.   On 65, a ""normal"" lens would be around 100mm, and a 50mm would be considered wide angle.   P.S. I know you know, but replying to this comment felt right."
cinematography,3dmq32,Cryingintheshower,3,Fri Jul 17 19:15:22 2015 UTC,They won't 'accidentally' go from a long lens to a wide because of the sensor size. The fov will still be  creatively decided. But I assume they want to go both extremely wide without fisheye and work in a lower light environment.
cinematography,3dmq32,d_russ,2,Fri Jul 17 20:18:00 2015 UTC,"Wait what are you talking about? I was addressing a comment saying there would be less wide distortion on 65mm, when you would get the opposite."

E: wait I think I see the confusion. My example before wasn't a great one in relation to the topic. I didn't mean a 50 would give you this effect (and I recognize that on that 50 you get a wider FOV with less distortion than with the same FOV on 35mm, requiring a wider lens to achieve), what I meant was that wide lenses look wider, and as such you may get more barrel distortion and the other visual qualities of what might be considered ""extreme"" wides. Apologies for the confusion."

cinematography,3dmq32,Vaderhater93,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:23:56 2015 UTC,"Why the :/? I had a lot of background assumptions here that I should have mentioned first. On MF like the alexa 65 conventionally longer lenses have twice the field of view as a lens on 35mm, meaning that Chivo could have used a 50mm instead of a 25mm on shots, thereby reducing distortion and flattening the image.  A narrower aperture would make the lens appear to be wider at first glance by having a deeper focus, like wider lenses naturally do."
cinematography,3dmq32,Raichu93,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:19:31 2015 UTC,"A narrower aperture would make the lens appear to be wider at first glance by having a deeper focus, like wider lenses naturally do.   This is true, I assumed you meant that a narrower aperture somehow changed the field of view, but I totally get what you mean now, my mistake, sorry.   meaning that Chivo could have used a 50mm instead of a 25mm on shots, thereby reducing distortion and flattening the image.   This however is just incorrect... The size of the sensor in the Alexa 65 changes absolutely nothing about perspective distortion with focal lengths. When you use a FOV equivalent lens for your format, it'll be the same, not more flat."
cinematography,3dmq32,Vaderhater93,0,Sat Jul 18 01:40:37 2015 UTC,"No no what I'm saying is that in order to have the same field of view as a standard 35mm lens, a 65mm lens must be about 2x as long because the sensor area is, well, twice as wide."
cinematography,3dmq32,Raichu93,2,Sat Jul 18 15:51:18 2015 UTC,"Yes but directors and cinematographers don't pick focal lengths by the number... They pick it by the field of view.  That means that the sensor size does not matter because they're chasing a specific wide FOV regardless. So whatever format it is, they would be mounting whatever compensating focal length lens that gives them that view."
cinematography,3dmq32,Vaderhater93,0,Sat Jul 18 16:19:10 2015 UTC,"Sure, but the compression is still a factor because 65 has twice the field of view on the same mm lens. And the length of the lens makes an enormous impact on the characteristic of the image. That's why mf looks so good, the fact that an 80mm lens has the same field of view as a 40 but with all the great compression and depth of field of an 80 on 35mm. I'm saying its a natural consequence of shooting 65 that you get less distortion because the focal lengths are always longer for the same field of view when compared to 35, therefore you tend not to use ultra wide lenses"
cinematography,3dmq32,Raichu93,2,Sat Jul 18 20:35:55 2015 UTC,"the fact that an 80mm lens has the same field of view as a 40 but with all the great compression and depth of field of an 80 on 35mm.   No, that's not a fact. It's actually bullshit.  I'm sorry but you need to relearn lenses and focal lengths. I'm not trying to be condescending, I'm honestly saying this for your own sake.  As hard as it may be to believe, focal length has no impact on compression. You were right about the depth of field differences, but compression? NO.  This is a fact."
cinematography,3dmq32,demesisx,-1,Sat Jul 18 20:49:40 2015 UTC,I think you need to go back and learn about lenses and FoV again because 65mm is exactly that: a wider FoV on the same diameter lenses; therefore less distortion as a result.
cinematography,3dmq32,Raichu93,2,Sat Jul 18 20:26:08 2015 UTC,"therefore less distortion as a result.   Everything BUT this part is correct. Perspective distortion is an absolute thing, the 65 being a larger sensor has nothing to do with it. It's simply EASIER to get a wide shot due to longer focal lengths giving a wider FoV.  However, when directors and cinematographers are MAKING FILMS, they select lenses based on FoV, NOT the number on the barrel. So if they want the camera placed aligned with the lip, balanced frame, on an angle, they want the perfect amount of compression by setting the placement of the camera, and the lens that goes with it to achieve that FoV. Now, depending on the format you chose, whatever focal length you find gives you the framing you want,you pick THAT one, whether it's a 35, 50, 85, 135. If it's giving you the visual result you need, you're using it.  So Chivo didn't just accidentally mount a 24mm on the 65 and go ""OMG it's wider than when i mounted this lens on the Alexa!"" He already knows that. He's mounting a certain lens on it BECAUSE he's already chosen the FoV he wanted and the lens focal length FOLLOWED. Besides, the equivalents in wide lenses for the medium format triple chip that the 65 has, aren't ""wide"" focal lengths in absolute numbers, they are also compensating for the larger format already. So a standard lens at that point is already considered to be a 75mm or so, not a ""43mm"" of photography and ""28mm"" of cinematography full frame"

Also I understand the insanity of proclaiming this the next oscar winner based on a trailer but damn does it look good.  Should be some great competition this year though. Sicario looks pretty damn great too.  edit:   We are shooting in such remote far-away locations that, by the time we arrive and have to return, we have already spent 40% of the day. But those locations are so gorgeous and so powerful, they look like they have never been touched by a human being, and that’s what I needed. The light is very reduced here in winter, and we are not shooting with any electrical lighting, just natural light.

cinematography,3dmq32,ShhhitsmeCaspa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:32:19 2015 UTC,Because longer lenses compress the foreground and background creating a more natural look. On MF like the alexa 65 conventionally longer lenses have twice the field of view as a lens on 35mm.

Where the camera is situated in relation to the subjects is ALL that matters for compression. focal length has no impact on that, so please, learn things right.  A larger sensor does not ""compress"" more than a smaller one. Even by your own (wrong) way of thinking of it, a smaller sensor would compress more than a larger one.

cinematography,3dmq32,Raichu93,0,Fri Jul 17 19:42:20 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding man, im not arguing these things with you.   Large sensors have a wider field of view (FOV, no one said anything about sensors and compression being linked) than small sensors, its called a crop factor, you can not argue this, it is a fact.   Telephoto lenses (135mm) have more compression than a wide angle lens (24mm).   ill ELI3 for you, If i frame up a medium (thats a medium shot, bottom of the frame is at waist/belly button level, in case you dont get that too) on Jonny and sam is 50ft behind Jonny, he will look one way, then i slap on a 135mm and bring up my medium, Jonny is going to look very different.  this can not be argued. its is a fact."

You are 100% correct. So at least you know SOMETHING.   If i frame up a medium (thats a medium shot)  then i slap on a 135mm and bring up my medium   Hold on, you're missing a step. In between those two shots, in order to get that same medium shot framing again, you had to move the camera back a great deal, correct?  So think about what that means in terms of correlation vs causation. There was more compression in the shot when using the 135mm lens than with the 24mm. But is it caused by the lens? Or the fact that you moved back 10 ft?  If you want to try it for yourself with two different focal lengths without moving the camera, be my guest, and you'll see that I'm right. The compression would be the same, no matter what lens. The framing would change, but the compression would NOT. And THAT is a fact."

Specifically the type of on-rails previews of games you would see at E3 for the newest Call of Duty game or similar.  I've no film background, but I'd say it's because of the smooth camera tracking with wide pans through carefully scripted events.  Also the camera seems to often stay at this mid-range distance similar to 3rd person video games, allowing for over the shoulder shots of the action.  Anyone able to explain the effect better?  Although it's stunning I'm not sure I actually like the effect in film.  It seems to desensitize the violence a little by turning it into a game."

Learning how to DP by being on camera team is great, but you personally have to start shooting. A producer on a film one day won't turn to the 1st AC and say, ""Hey, I need a DP. Can you shoot?"" They'll turn to the DP instead; they'll ask other producers for a DP instead.  Ladder climbing can only help you so much. At some point, you've got to start shooting. You'll start back at square one when compared to how far you've climbed the ladder on camera team, but it's an inevitable reality.  DSLR reels look great!

There's usually market price for rentals that come from a rental house (in LA at least) It's usually pretty expensive, but that price comes with reliability, and the ability to (most likely) get it replaced rather quickly if anything should go wrong.

So you really have to undercut the rental houses because why would I rent from you, if I can go to a rental house, and have the ability to build the camera any way I want and have a service tech run around and gather all the goodies I need to build the camera?   The good thing is that Amiras are sought after and there isn't a ridiculously saturated market for them like there is with Red's. I can get 100 different Red's in LA for $200/day.

Of course there's all the accessories and lenses...  Arri builds cameras that have legs. Alexa has lasted longer as a top end camera for longer than any other recent digital camera. But... unless you work all the time and have clients who will consistently rent it from you then there's no point.  Rental houses have to pay off a camera within six months in order to be guaranteed six months of profit before the next big camera comes out. Alexa is the exception to this rule... so far. Newer Alexas with more features are not far off.  (It used to be you could buy a Betacam, pay it off in a year and work it for another ten, but those days are long gone.

The producers were giving me a hard time about it on my last features because they were worried about the workflow. Either way, it turned out okay once I went through it with them.

Of course, its hard to give feedback for cinematography when the picture isn't moving.   But I'll start somewhere: the fourth shot of the guys face close up, could have use a small reflector to give some more detail in the face. It's getting lost in the blacks. However, I'm in my office, not under the best viewing situation so it could be fine.    I find the next four shots to be excellent.  Well lit. What do you want to know?"
cinematography,3dhzaf,aaaalexandre,3,Thu Jul 16 12:52:12 2015 UTC,Thank you! The moving shots will probably end up putting some people off since nearly the whole film is handheld (I feel it makes sense with the themes of the film) though I think we're doing some pretty cool things that people will dig such as several of the messy brawls taking place in long takes in wide/full shots (Shot #3).  Totally agree about the face close up! It's a dark moment for the character so that's the excuse I'll use but in all honesty bringing a reflector slipped my mind that day and I didn't want to possibly mess up the natural look with a small LED light. I'll see how putting a mask on his face and lightening it up a bit will look.  For what specifically I was looking for was anything in regards to color. The extent of my color correction/grading knowledge is slapping a film stock LUT on the footage and trying to make the forest greens pop. I'm finding that some of the skin tones are going into yellow territory though such as the last shot. So I'm really looking for any personal thoughts on the colors/grade or anything from a technical stand point.

An example might be....i dunno, bare flourescent tube hanging over a mirror? It's shitty, has maybe a green shittyness about it, maybe it flickers? So you might replicate that in a controlled manner with a low-power practical in frame, then hang a decent flo- tube outside of the frame, gelled with some plus green? Maybe a brown? You could put some diffusion on it, but in random patches to make it look more uneven.  In this hypothetical, if it were me, i wouldn't make the whole room green, but instead contrast the shitty green flo with maybe a bare tungsten bulb somewhere else in the room. Same sort of fakery set-up. Or, maybe the room is totally dark, except for some sodium vapor street light coming in through the window? Green/ orange is a good yucky contrast. Or yellow/ green (See Braking Bad).  Hard (ish) top light can be an ugly thing too. That or very soft and mushy top light, directly over talent's head to give them godfather skull eyes.  You probs don't want to over-light. So the simpler the better. I imagine a shitty hotel room to be lit by maybe 1- 2 sources.  Example  Another Example  Play around with practicals and see if you can get them to work. If not, you can fake them with ""movie lights"" just off screen, with the practicals either dimmed or replaced with lighter bulbs.  Also depends on the time of day. For that maybe you'd want something soft and white/ blue-ish coming from a window. As opposed to a hard, sunset colored source, that might unintentionally make things look pretty."

I've heard some dp's say that they tend to over/expose african american skin by as much as a stop or more, and that warmer tones usually look better to them. Pale skin you might want to under-expose a half to one full stop, depending on the lighting.  In my experience, when you're worried about varying skintones messing up your lighting and exposure, you can use the inverse square law to your advantage. You can place lighter skinned people farther away from light sources, and darker skin closer. That way they even out. That helps me anyway. You can also net half of a source to slow it down for the lighter skinned subject in the frame too, if you can't change blocking."

GoPro did just release the GoPro Hero4 Session, which is basically a 1080p GoPro the size of the Hero4's black lens housing.  Alternatively, you might consider looking into fpv camera kits that are normally used for UAVs/drones, but can also be used for this purpose.  They're tiny, light, and designed to transmit a video signal to a multitude of different devices, including 2D or 3D goggles, monitors, and video recorders.  You might try asking around in /r/multicopter for advice on those.  Some kits start around $50, though for decent quality or resolution you're probably looking at a few hundred."

cinematography,3d4z40,LochnessDigital,2,Mon Jul 13 17:29:12 2015 UTC,"I liked: color palette, nice diffusion filter effect in the opening shot, highlights blow out nicely, opening dolly shot is a great opener, liked where that ladder is placed left of frame. Billiards shot had great depth, liked the lighting in the stairwell back there. Ending product shot was nice, liked all the stuff going on the background.  I didn't like: only low angles, shutter angle seemed to be set high in the first scene, zooms seemed like after-thoughts, camera way too low in the two shot at the end (super wides can really accentuate this!). A few of your shots lacked the level of depth you created in the 1st shot and the billiards shot.  Non-cinematography/other thoughts: I thought it was a little strange he breaks the fourth wall in the beginning only to never break it again. I was expecting a little nod to the camera in the last scene. The narrator is mumbly in his first line, due to how much of a mouthful that sentence is. Did we flip 180 degrees in the end? It seems like a completely different room after the clank of the beard balm tins.  Most important question: why are there four 9 balls on the billiards table? :)"

I really appreciate the fact that you pointed out the excessive use of wides/low angles, it feels as if it's a bad habit of mine, kinda like cheating.   The thing about breaking the fourth wall was obviously beyond my control, but i do agree with what you said about expecting a little nod at the end.  Important answer: I think you're the only one to notice that! We shot billiards scene in an old pub and people don't usually use that pool that table, so there are plenty of balls missing from the set."

It looks like he's in a depressing war flick, doesn't exactly make me excited to try beard balm.   Also, this may have been a thing the director insisted on, but I don't like how much headroom you give the actors in almost every shot, it minimizes them a lot and negates the low angles you're using to give them more power."

cinematography,3d2by5,tallbadman,3,Sun Jul 12 23:26:49 2015 UTC,"This is going to be harsh, but the shots of the painter are 10 fold better than the shots of the sculptor.  With the painter, you placed her in front of a color which contrasts nicely with her yellow shirt. You also helped her stand out with that hair light. She's also far enough away from the paintings so that the depth of field makes it clear as to what the focus of the shot is. She jumps out from the background. You also have a natural vignetting effect with the light falloff toward the edges of the frame. This keeps your eyes focused where to look.  In contrast, the shots of the sculptor are incredibly boring. She's relatively the same exposure as the rest of the frame and everything has this same yellow tint (wrong white balance?). You're working in a tight space so the depth of field isn't going to be as easily achievable. Everything becomes this mush of ""what am I supposed to look at?"" where the with the painter, this is very clear.  Combine that with the fact that the sculptor isn't quite as animated as the painter and the audio issues that you ran into, it just feels like a drop in quality every time we cut back to her."
cinematography,3d2by5,LochnessDigital,2,Wed Jul 15 11:15:25 2015 UTC,"Random thoughts:   Visuals are good - maybe a bit more headroom for some of the interview shots. The tops of their heads are just cut off which feels clumsy. I like the wide shot of the sculptor. Lighting on the artist is nice. The audio from the sculptor is poor - high level of noise, sounds like it's been boosted in post without a noise filter.  Some things I'd change in the edit, pacing doesn't feel interesting, ending is abrupt."
cinematography,3d2by5,howardgrigg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:24:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Yea I messed up the audio on the zoom. Had her hooked up to a lav and a shoot gun for back up.

The real problem with grad school is paying for that high debt afterwards. Freelancing as a DP for the first ten years pays very little. You can't expect more than $24k a year at best for the first few years.

Tape is the most important single item in filmmaking. Learn more about the varieties of and uses of tape in the film industry and you will be on your way to climbing out of amateurdom.  Hint: you need some one inch cloth tape there, commonly known in the industry as ""camera tape"" (if it were two inches wide it would be called ""gaff tape"", otherwise it's the same stuff - but it's nothing at all like duct tape, never use duct tape on a camera!), preferably in black.

Right now, focus on framing, how your shots work together in the edit, lighting, and specifically learning how the camera settings work.

Of course you need to learn and practice until you're at a point you get to rent 3 Alexas with Panavision Anamorphic Primes and Panther Dollies for your shoot.  That being said, I second my friend C47man's comments (not merely because he inspires my Grip Pride in the little wooden clippy with his name) because as long as you are able to learn about how aperture effects DoF and focal length relates to that as well it doesn't matter.  DSLRs have some issues if you want to get into cinema, though, so make sure you study how cine cameras differ from DSLRs.  Shutter speed isn't really a thing on cine cameras (use 50 shutter speed and 24fps on a DSLR as a starting point to emulate a 180 degree shutter).  Also, learn your lights. Kinos, LED, HMI, Tungsten.  Open-face, PAR, Fresnel, soft, etc.  Know what does what, how and then figure out why you would use what.  Enjoy :)  (Don't spend more than $1000 of you camera, lenses and tripod to learn on.

Usually not the workhorse cameras they actually use to shoot films, mind.  Usually some really cool and obscure cameras they like to pull out for special tasks the Alexa or Arricam they're shooting the meat of the film on.  The thing about owning a camera is that you also need the kit to work it.  Cine lenses, rods, handheld rig, sticks, o'connor head, studio mattebox, clip-on mattebox, filters, Preston, monitor, cables, extra cards, batteries, chargers, etc.    Owning a camera is rather essential to practice, shoot fun things that come about and have if you want to shoot a passion project on your own time with friends, etc.  However, quality of that camera isn't usually relevant; you just need it to do really cool stuff.  I'd honestly recommend this before most $500+ options if your goal is to be a cinematographer, instead of a vidoegrapher (who hires out your equipment and services as a single item).  I mean, you can be an owner-operator.  Whatever you rather.  I know 7 or so people in LA who own Reds or Amira/Alexa packages who try to hire them out and/or hire themselves out as DPs with their packages.

I say that only because I don't think your skill is holding you back.  The only difference between your stuff and ""real movie"" territory is equipment and then experience with that equipment.  You are ready to start working on 'real' stuff now.  It will be a learning curve going from one-man operating to suddenly having a 1st AC and 2nd AC working with you (and maybe even an operator, with you at video village watching monitor).  You will obviously need to become familiar with the RED systems (if you are not already) as well as the Alexa and maybe the f55 and f65 if you have to.  Cine lenses are a different breed and you will want to start to understand how they are different from prosumer lenses.  Also, the 4k or Open Gate resolution narrows the DoF considerably, so a f4 on, say a panavision Primo 85mm will look like an f0.2 on a Canon 7d.  I don't know what gear (HMIs, maxis, kinos, LiteMats, Alexas, condors, etc) you are familiar with, but that is probably the area you want to start to explore.  Great work and good luck!"

You may not always catch it. It appears that-aside from The string around the mirror- there isn't anything actually attached to the car. When I do it, I use a ratchet strap with cheap microfibre cloths to protect the car door, and send the ratchet strap the whole way round to hold it in and buy you some time before your camera falls off. If you wrap the strap around the poles then when you tighten the strap it will hold in place via friction.   There's also bike rack hooks from the kits that go on hatchbacks without hitches- those little hooks can be used as well to get more attachment points.

I'd just worry about what happens when you hit a bump, a hard stop, or the cups come in contact with moisture. Like tires hitting a puddle or something.  Personally I'd have the key grip rig up a hostess tray that you rent. See how it clamps on to the top of the car door, so that as gravity pulls it down, it just hugs the door tighter? They've also rigged it with padding in this photo so that it doesn't scratch the car. You could easily accomplish this with a furniture pad if you aren't into yoga lol.  Ideally you'd put a bunch of ratchet straps on it too, for good measure.  But honestly, your rig looks like it'd fall off with a good thump and destroy the camera. That handle sticking out isn't doing the rig any favors either. Looks like something the whole thing could catch on a branch and fall apart. Gravity is trying to pull your rig apart, not keep it glued to the car.   TLDR: You're relying on cheap rubber and a little rope that's too long to save your camera from a fall. I highly recommend you hire a key grip to help you figure this out too. Even if it's just a couple of days. Cheaper than buying a new camera!  Edit: If it ain't worth doin safe, it ain't worth doin. No matter how pretty your test footage looks. I've been in your position needing to rig a bike once. Key grip wasn't confident he could do it safely with what he had, so I didn't do the shot. Woulda been a cool shot too, between the crossbars, looking up at the talent. But it's not worth it if you can't make it safe.

Sometimes a show rolling through town might need extra grips or electrics to crew on their sets. Often times a rental house will recommend it's own interns and employees. You might even start out babysitting gear on a grip truck. Not glamourous, but at least you'll be ""in the shit"" learning about all the stuff that you make images with. They aren't going to hire some rando with no experience. You have to make connections with people, and often have someone recommend you or vouch for you. You do that by starting small, starting humble, and asking if they need any help with anything. Be humble, tell them the truth, that you don't have much experience, and that you're there to learn and not compete with everyone.  If you live in the middle of nowhere, this is a problem. Consider moving/ commuting to a major city. I live in the U.S., but I know that the UK has a huge industry (they're shooting the star wars sequels at pinewood!!!).   You can own and operate sure, but you've got to have the skills and experience to use it. The gear does not make you a DP, it's your own talent. Owning and operating can get you work, but only if you know what you're doing, and if you can make enough money to recoup your investment. Also, cameras, bad investment. It'll be totally obsolete in 6 months to a year, when clients demand something newer, or everyone else has the latest and greatest and you can't compete. Most DP's are not owner-operators. So don't sweat it!"

Also, instead of the description you've written about uni and people saying it's no good, I'd get rid of that and keep it very brief. Just talk about the kit you used in the reel (flycam, lenses, camera, etc.), what you edited on bla bla bla...  (I was referring to London by the way - tele land mecca).  The only thing I can recommend is to continue shooting whatever you can. Maybe go into your local area (wherever that is), find some businesses that you're interested in like local coffee shops, boutique stores, anything independent, and offer to do simple promo videos for them. Not necessarily for monetary gain in the short term, but just to get your name out there, to lead to further opportunities.  For example, ""Coffee shop owner"" knows a local singer/songwriter that needs a music/promo video... passes your name on.

I went on to be a camera trainee, loader, focus puller, B cam operator, and now 10 years later became a DOP with a wealth of experience learnt from working with my peers. Sorry dude owning a Nikon, doesn't make you a DOP. But keep shooting with it, and keep ur reel fresh, but look lower down the ladder to hone your experience and other filming making skills first before you start trying to find a job as a 'cinematographer'. Getting on a Shoot as an AC is all about timing, and the person who will help you get employed is the focus puller or the 2nd AC. They'll be looking for a trainee approx two weeks before the camera tests begin. So what do you need to do? Find out start dates for upcoming shoots, speak to production office, get the names of the camera team, and email them. Good luck."

cinematography,3cq8oy,RhysWarren,6,Thu Jul 9 22:16:14 2015 UTC,"Hey man.  I'm a DP, been working a long time. Between film school and being paid as a professional assistant, then operator, now DP, I've been at it more then half my life. Today I finished cutting my reel for the third time this year. In the last ten years I've cut at least forty versions of it. It's a ritual I don't look forward to but it's necessary.   My feedback is this - keep shooting. Shoot as much as you can. Shoot during the sunrise, shoot during the sunset. Shoot at high-noon, at late afternoon, just before supper, and just before bed.  Shoot shadows on the walls, pretty girls walking down the street. Shoot on really wide lenses at the beach, and really tight lenses in the city square. Take a trip somewhere and shoot on the train. Make the images blue and add orange light, make the images dark and flash a bright spot from a mirror around.  Shoot.   It sounds like a condescending thing to say but check out ASC Cinematographer Reed Morano's Instagram feed and you'll see what I mean - she shoots an image a day that is a work of art. Every...single...day...  It's inspiring and terrifying because it reminds me that I don't shoot enough.  Keep shooting, keep editing, keep watching, keep shooting."

cinematography,3cqp85,D1r3ctor,2,Fri Jul 10 00:45:41 2015 UTC,"Couple of things:  - I like the colour grading in this. You need to incorporate contrasting colours, teal would go with your orange yellow grade. you can achieve this using practical objects (Blue boxes, etc). Typically skin tones are part of the yellow grade and other objects can be a contrasting colour to grade harmony in the image.    The shot feels very constricting. Seems like you shot this on a 50mm 1.8, and you left the aperture on 1.8. the DOF is too shallow for what you're doing. Short DOF has its use, however use of shallow DOF should be limited to create contrast or at the very least be used to draw our eyes to a particular place.  Try and think about your shots and composition before you shoot. A slider is a great tool however it must be used to create an effect or add to the story. Remember cinematography is about storytelling. If a camera slides, it should be sliding to show a change in something. or to introduce a new element to the image. A good example of a slider shot is the opening crawl of interstellar. A slide for the sake of a slide is a bit pointless. A still shot on a tripod is nothing to be scared of.  If you are trying to make a short film but focus on the cinematography, you need to ensure you are still trying to tell a story. Show a change in the character or some element of the composition. You could have your character fixing this box (or whatever) and show his change in emotion. For example you could start with a wide lens and then move to a more constricting lens as his emotions change. You could use the slider to move away from your subject and onto another object relevant to the story.  Remember foreground, middleground and background and the rule of thirds. This seems as if you did not think about the composition of your shot. I felt distracted by the short DOF and the flatness of the image.   I will complement you on your colour grading."

I love the low-lighting / dramatic feel and esp. the opening shot with the slider (although the mistype in the title sort of gets at my OCD :) ) . I think it could be enhanced with some audio effects/music. I agree with /u/D1r3ctor I think it's a little long for what it is because it's lacking really any storyline.

I'd say it seems to me and perhaps an outside viewer that the shots weren't pre-conceived. Even wonderful films that incorporate the handheld, loose style, take measures to plan every composition, which this seems to lack.  Your actor's actions are out of sync with the camera motion, which makes me aware of the camera, which takes me out of the story. That matched with the dipping in and out of focus hurts.  In terms of lighting, it's dark and moody. I'd say punch up some part of the scene with more light, like a rim light or something, since most is underexposed. That's cool, just needs something directional and hard to give the scene more character.  I'd say vary the compositions a little bit too, within the same style, to build upon the story. I think Danny Boyle is the master at composing a ton of shots that are unique yet in harmony.  Good job though, definitely find some other compositions on your next project that lend to the story."

But ""entirely useless""? It almost never happens on any professional production. I can't think of any reason it would, barring someone just making a mistake punching a setting in (and even then, whoever's monitoring it should catch it).  I'm not sure how in photography you would bracket for composition, except to just recompose and shoot again. Which is what we do sometimes. Especially if you don't get a rehearsal, an actor may leave frame, or perform an action quicker than you were expecting and you don't quite get there. Usually on complicated shots, and most people are understanding that hey-- it's a damn complicated shot, lots of stuff is going on. You just let your director know you lost your subject for a second, they check playback and decide if they want another. Sometimes these turn into happy accidents!

Shooting film, you get a number off a light meter, set the stop, roll film and then check dailies 2 days later, hoping something is there and doesn't look like trash. Shooting daytime exterior on 250D, you may have ND1.5 and a polarizer, get a stop of 2.8-4 split, look in the eyepiece and think ""holy shit, that looks dark"".   If one shot is entirely useless because of the exposure or composition, then you normally go back and make sure you did everything ""right"": make sure the lens stop was set correctly, you had the right film stock loaded, gaffer was using the same base stop for his meter, etc.  Generally, composition isn't off with digital, because if it is, then it was on set while shooting it and why didn't someone say something sooner? Generally, exposure gets treated the same way.   I swear, I think the new DP's coming up now are not benefitting from the experience of shooting film. Imagine playing a guitar, only you play a whole song and never really hear it until 2 days later, in a listening booth, with your client, some fans, and your bandmates. Imagine the horror or elation as you finally see realized what you tried to do days before?

I've been rocking my 550d with the sigma lens ever since, regretting my choice.  But you've given me some hope, gona download the firmware when I get home.

It's SO clear and SO crisp. It looks very cinematic to me, just on the fact that its so dang sharp and nice looking. Thats the exact amount of sharpness and look I want. And he uses the same camera, but a differnt lens. However my lens is close to his I think.  What do you think? Any tips?"
cinematography,3co209,jonathan_92,3,Thu Jul 9 21:42:21 2015 UTC,"Prores HQ is pretty darn good for most applications, and could probably give you the look in the link. Raw is just nice if you have the extra money for hard drives, or you need to do a lot of VFX and compositing.  My suggestion to get that look would be to over-expose then pull the image back down to a ""normal"" exposure in Davinci resolve light (Which is a free and industry standard program BTW, and the full version should come with your camera!). What happens when you do that is, not only do you have more data to work with, but you also eliminate grain. So if you over expose, maybe a stop or two, then spend a couple of minutes in davinci resolve, you can get some fantastic results. Provided you've lit and framed well, or have done your homework and found a good location and time of day to use available light, etc. That should give you a super clean, super sharp image.  You just have to be careful to not let information clip on the histogram. You're aiming to bring it almost to the right edge of the histogram, but not quite. With a light meter, that means over exposing maybe one or two stops above what you might have normally set your exposure at. Keep in mind that the BMCC's latitude at 800 ISO is 8 stops underexposed, 5 stops over. You definitely want to make sure that you shooting at the ISO that the camera is rated for, 800, and that you're using a 180 degree shutter angle for accurate motion. You'll also probably want to expose to the ""sweet spot"" of your lens, where it will be the most sharp. Around t4-t8. 5.6 being ideal for most lenses, although you might need to do some testing.   You'll want to rent a matte box and some IR ND filters to cut the light intensity, and that's for most cameras at that exposure, in broad daylight. Probably some regular .3, .6, and .9, and then maybe an IR 1.2, and a 1.8. You can stack them as long as you have one of the IR filters in front, if you go above .9. Make sure you get a ""doughnut"" or a flexible ring that will block light coming from behind the filters from reflecting into the lens. Gaffer tape, blackwrap, duvatyne, or just a dark colored sweater can also take care of this. If you have a variable ND filer, it will probably be fine, you just may have some green/magenta color casts and strange dark gradients in your footage that you'll have to color out later (which isn't hard at all). A vari-ND won't be quite as sharp, but still pretty damned sharp, and potentially cheaper to rent or buy!  On the light, it looked relatively soft and diffused. Like it was just ambient light, with the trees blocking most of the direct, harder sunlight. Bounces and negative fill are your friends when shooting outdoors.  Anyway, sorry for the wall o' text, hope that helps!"
cinematography,3co209,Steve-Gary,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:52:33 2015 UTC,"This is quite a GOLD answer. Thank you for posting this! So, in average occasions you'd suggest to slightly overexpose to reduce grain than underexposing to enhance your range?"
cinematography,3co209,jonathan_92,2,Fri Jul 10 01:14:29 2015 UTC,"No. Yes? It depends on the look you're going for. For most narratives, i'd probably just expose normally. But if you want the ultra-clean, ultra sharp, high-gloss look, then yeah that might be the way you want to go. You'll technically lose latitude...but that's actually exactly what adding contrast in post does anyway.   I mean it really depends on the project, and on the camera. Some cameras are going to look less grainy at their rated iso and neutral exposure than others.  So no, you can't use it as a blanket practice, this is just something i've found to work for getting a specific look. But if you look at what cinematographers did in the old days to shoot night scenes, a lot of them would pull the negative to reduce grain. They might also shoot on a slower stock, which would be less grainy and have deeper blacks. Perfect example is Pulp Fiction. Entire movie was shot on kodak 50D, 50 iso film for that purpose.  Fast forward to today, and a lot of dp's do the same thing. They'll take an 800 iso red or alexa and set them to 400 iso to reduce grain, and then expose normally. With an alexa you can do that because it will hold the same latitude at every iso, but the latitude will change where it lies. So 800 iso on an alexa gives you 7 over and 7 under. At 400 its something like 6 over and 8 under. 1600 is like 8 over and 7 under. See what happened there? The alexa's latitude stayed the same, but just shifted. The other difference between 400 and 1600, besides 2 stops of sensitivity, is that 400 is way less grainy an is more clean and sharp looking.   Now thats an alexa, my black magic tests gave me something like 8 under 4 over @400, and about the same 8 under 5 over @1600. So logically, for me anyway, i just over exposed 800 and pulled it to something roughly equivalent to 400 or 200 to retain the latitude, while making things look way more crisp. While you technically lose a stop of highlight latitude, you gain a stop of shadow (which i technically chop off anyway in the grade to get my blacks to ""true"" black. Quick, look away, flaws in my logic!).  Remember though, every camera model reacts differently to light and color. What might work on one camera probably either won't work, or is totally redundant. Like if you're shooting raw. Pulling is probably totally redundant if you're shooting raw."

Sorry if I'm misunderstanding, but why are you saying to put a native 800 to 400 ISO? Wasn't the point quite the opposite? Maybe I'm just getting it wrong, but I thought that the practice (to reduce grain) was to leave the ISO native even if this gets you overexposed (so without touching ISO, but - if needed - aperture) and then pull it back to normal in post. Can you explain this, please?"
cinematography,3co209,jonathan_92,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:35:55 2015 UTC,"Im saying there's multiple ways to do it. it depends on what will work best with the camera you are using, what look you're going for.

You're the one thats going to have to do tests. All any of us can do for each other here is provide suggestions."
cinematography,3co209,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:06:39 2015 UTC,"Hi, I've seen people mention stops over/under when measuring latitude of various cameras before, but I still don't really understand what this means in a practical sense. For your example of the BMCC at 400 iso (8 under, 4 over), does that mean you have 8 stops under normal exposure before you lose all visual information? If this is super basic info I apologise, haven't been able to totally wrap my head around latitude yet."
cinematography,3co209,smegasaurus,2,Sun Jul 12 02:51:17 2015 UTC,"Yes. So at it's rated 800 ISO (which just means the iso at which the camera can record the most latitude) a Black Magic Cinema camera can do 8 f-stops stops of under exposure, and 5 f-stops stops of over exposure before it starts losing visual information. So if you took a light meter out and measured a key light source on an 18% gray card, the card would appear totally black on camera if you closed your aperture down to 8 stops below the f-value that your meter gives you. It would appear totally blown-out white if you opened your aperture 5 stops past the f-stop that your meter read.  Lets talk about middle gray. It's basically equal parts white and black, hence the term ""middle gray"". In art, (painting, drawing, etc) 50% gray is considered the middle, with 100% being white, and 0% being black. Art's system makes sense and is intuitive because it's based on what your eye sees. In digital cameras however, and cinematography, we know middle gray as 18%, because aperture exposure is logarithmic. F4 is twice as much light as F5.6, F5.6 is twice as much light as F8, and so on. 0% is Black, 18% is Middle Grey, and 100% is White. This is important, becuause in photography and cinematography, we use middle gray as the benchmark for how we measure exposure. When you spot meter an 18% gray card under a light source, if the meter has been calibrated for the camera, it will always give you an accurate measurement of what you camera will see and record.   So you can think of your neutral, middle gray exposure, the exposure that your meter gives you, as  0 EV. Exposure value zero. On a black magic, past 8 stops of under exposure, the camera will record black. -8 EV. +5EV would be blown out white. So where ever you expose your camera, is effectively what you are setting middle gray at in your frame. If you want a bright highlight in the frame, you'd need to light it to be somewhere around +5 EV, and a deep black shadow would need to be lit (or not lit) to around -8 EV. If you want something to be aroudn the middle, but maybe not as bright as your middle, maybe you'd expose it to -2 EV, or something like that.  Remember, this is a specific example for a black magic cinema camera. Another model of black magic might have a different exposure latitude. An Arri Alexa, for example, is 7 over and 7 under at 800 iso. So it will vary from camera model to camera model, and you often have to test it with a light meter, a gray card, and a waveform or histogram built into a camera or monitor.  TLDR: The basic idea of latitude is, how many F- stops under and over exposed you can get before a part of an image is totally white, or totally black."
cinematography,3co209,jonathan_92,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:36:04 2015 UTC,"Middle gray:       In photography, painting, and other visual arts, middle gray or middle grey is a tone that is perceptually about halfway between black and white on a lightness scale;  in photography, it is typically defined as 18% reflectance in visible light.  This gray reflects exactly 1/5th the number of photons per square unit as compared to a reference white of 90% reflectance.   Middle gray is the universal measurement standard in photographic cameras. To calibrate light meters, whether in a camera or hand held, the 18% gray card was conceived. It is assumed that the measurement taken by a meter gives the exposure for a shot so that some of the light reflected by the object measured is equivalent to middle gray.  However, many note that modern cameras generally treat 12-13% gray as ""middle gray"".  In the sRGB color space, CIELAB middle gray is equivalent to 46.6% brightness.  In 24-bit color, this is rounded to RGB value (119,119,119) or #777777.

When I bought a t3i and started shooting, I read that exposing to the right on canon dslr's should always be done (provided you don't clip your highlights) and I've also heard the same about the GH4.   Can you shed any light on why certain brands or sensors perform better when exposing to the right? I've also read that for the a7s you should be overexposing by two stops, but I gather this is because when using s-log, middle gray is at a different percentage than normal? One last thing, say you've exposed 2 stops over for a certain shot and want to bring it back to normal exposure in Davinci, is this just done by adjusting exposure to -2.00?   Sorry about all the questions haha, there's just so much to learn."

All the money I saved is going to buy me road flags, combos, baby stands, and a few other things for my truck. HMI lights are great, but for the price, you're better off renting until you have a full truck going already with kinos, pars, fresnels, and everything else.   Also, I know you don't care about the heat, but tungsten is still an industry standard for a reason. Actually, the exact reasons you asked for. If you really want versatility, pick up a few source fours and some low wattage fresnels. LED lights are not far along enough to compete properly IMO. Sure, LED is great for low wattage and tiny footprints, but what about the second you light a night scene? Or when you shoot a talking head and the specular highlight is too punchy, and your green shift is making the subject look like an alien?   I guess the most important question is: how do you plan to use these lights?"

You can control them over dmx, turn them on and off as many times as you want, daylight balance. The only bad thing is that they're a little yellow/green, but thats nothing that CC gels can't fix.  And thats my overall point, the color problems of led's cab be fixed with with a little +- green, in my experience. LED's are there alright, its just that everyone's bad first impressions of them made gaffer's and dp's everywhere super skeptical. Fluorescents were once that way!"

I thought that gels didn't work effectively because of the broken spectrum nature of LED lights? I guess if you calibrated specifically per each light they would, but that means buying a color meter.  At 575, I don't particularly mind the draw. IF we were talking 2.5k+, I think it'd be a little bit more justifiable. That said, there's still the issue of a million soldering points and plastic pieces inside of LED constructed lights that can break.  Plus, the refractive properties of LED lights are entirely different geometrically from tungsten bulbs (due to their being in an array versus being one light shot through a reflector).   I don't think that they're bad lights, but I wouldn't use them for the same applications, personally. I do think that they have a promising future, and I own a few small LED panels, but I don't think I'll be dropping 5k on an LED fresnel any time soon."
cinematography,3cn9j9,claytakephotos,3,Thu Jul 9 19:46:52 2015 UTC,"The spectrum isn't as broken as you think, not much different from a commonly used kino flo really. The CRI scale is also currently being debated by the MPAAS (aka THE academy). And the million soldering points are never truly put to the test...because they never get that hot. They're great for applications that disallow a generator, or tight spaces where heat becomes a serious issue (especially around kids!).   Have you ever used a mole-richardson baby LED retro-fit? Mole sells a kit that lets you convert old baby 1K's into either daylight or tungsten balanced LED fresnels. Pretty rad. They output is the equivalent of a baby 1K tungsten, but they only draw 150W! You can plug in like 10 of them into a 20 amp circuit with room to spare! Of course the color is a little better on tungsten units, but again, it's quite fixable with CC gel. Even then it's still not as good, but pretty damned close. I'd challenge anyone to tell the difference side by side with some CC gel, by eye or on screen.  For me, it becomes an issue of whether or not it's cheaper to go with traditional lighting and a generator, or a bunch of really great quality LED's, and just use a home circuit."

Thats the advantage of a softbox/chimera is that it bounces all that light back into the diffusion.

cinematography,3clbxh,murckem,3,Thu Jul 9 05:27:26 2015 UTC,"Short Answer: Yes, but it depends.  Long Answer:  It depends on what type of diffusion you use as some spread light sideways much more than others and soften it differently. Full grid cloth or muslin looks very soft as a large single break.   Where as two sheets of 251 would be still kinda hard. Bouncing is often the best way to get the softest light but takes up more time and space."
cinematography,3clbxh,ArtAdamsDP,2,Wed Jul 8 23:24:13 2015 UTC,So what is the difference between muslin and full grid cloth? Grid cloth is the grid fabric you attach to a soft box? Is there more or less loss of light compared to 251 sheets?
cinematography,3clbxh,murckem,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:07:27 2015 UTC,Grid cloth and muslin are just different rag diffusers. Grid is the one used in chimeras. Muslin was the fabric of choice in the early days because it diffuses so much but at the loss of a lot of stops of light. Muslin loses close to 3 stops where grid cloth only loses 1. Generally speaking the more stops you lose the more the light is diffused. Its a trade off
cinematography,3clbxh,ArtAdamsDP,2,Thu Jul 9 02:25:54 2015 UTC,"Depends on the diffusion. If it's crazy thick then you can get away with one piece, but we're talking tracing paper or Lee 129 (both of which I love).  Alternately, you can stagger two or even three pieces of diffusion. It's best to put them in frames so you can get them away from the light, otherwise diffusion on the doors of a light won't increase the size of the source so much as radiate light in all directions, negating the beam.  Or, as /u/roughnecktwozero points out, you can make a book light by bouncing your light and then putting diffusion between the bounce and the subject. That's as soft as it gets.  None of your examples are very soft diffusions, and the hot spot size tells me the light is too close. Silk still lets some specular light through. 250 generally has a hot spot if you put the light close enough. The farther away you put the light the less of a hot spot you'll see. For example, one of my favorite diffusions is full grid cloth as I an have a light fairly close to it but not see much of a hot spot at all, but if I'm diffusing sunlight I may go with 1/2 grid for the same effect as the sun is a lot farther away."

But I think you may have answered one of my questions. Getting a piece of diffusion farther from source will create larger, softer light than if it's place closer to the source, correct?  I also I'm still trying to figure out the difference between silks, rags, muslins, etc. Bleached muslin, not bleached... Is there any resource that breaks down the difference between all these modifiers? I feel like I only find pieces of the puzzle around the internet but never the full picture."
cinematography,3clbxh,murckem,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:04:19 2015 UTC,"From what i can tell, the woven fabrics such as silk and muslin let specular light through which give more defined shadows. The synthetic diffusers dont let any specular light through. I think the order goes something like hilite, half soft frost, soft frost, quarter, lite, then full grid. That goes from least diffuse/ smallest stop loss to most. Gels are another story altogether but i believe the most common ones go Hampshire frost, opal, 251, 250, 216 with quarter lite and full grid being roughly equivalent to the 251 250 and 216. Please correct me if im wrong but those are the most common where i work. Unfortunately i dont have photometric info or anything."
cinematography,3clbxh,DurtyKurty,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:34:33 2015 UTC,"Getting a piece of diffusion farther from source will create larger, softer light than if it's place closer to the source, correct?   Mostly the softness has to do with how large the source is in relation to the subject, not the camera... although the closer the light is to the camera the softer it can appear because there's less shadow cast, but typically we like shadows (except in a fill light).  Moving the diffusion farther from the light means there will be less of a hot spot in the diffusion, making it softer. Moving the diffusion closer to the subject will make it softer.  There are uses for thinner diffusion, though. Sometimes mixing hard and soft light makes for really interesting effects. Silk makes a soft (and distinctive) eye light because it's a large piece of diffusion with a hot center, for example. (Although you can make that hot spot smaller by backing the light way off.)"

Think more in terms of where you will put the camera, the focal lengths used, the lighting, and everything going in front of the camera (Like costumes, production design, and yes maybe a filer or two), rather than trying to achieve it all in post.  I'd say the biggest thing that you should pay attention to as the DP is the lighting and the colors used in front of the camera (Again, production design).  I also don't want to downplay post color. It's important, but not your golden- egg laying goose. Try and get your visuals 80% there in camera, and 20% in post.  Maybe analyse the film stock characteristics of your favorite reference films. Find out what stocks they were shot on, and how they responded to light. How much highlight and shadow latitude did they have? How did they respond to granularity and color? All of this info should be available through fact sheets from the film stock manufacturers. You might need to do some internet digging but I'm sure it's there. Then  you could maybe re-create the latitude of a favorite stock with a modern digital camera, a light meter, and some post grading. Likely just crushing/ blow out some of the shadow and highlights to match a film stock's latitude. For a more modern stock like Kodak 500T, 5 under and 8 over, the closest you might get is with an arri alexa, which is 7 and 7. All you'd need to do, in theory, is crush the shadows by about two stops and you'd have something similar. You'd need to know that that's what you're going to do before you shoot it, so that you don't get any surprises (hence the light meter).   But that's just one example. You might find that your favorite 60's-70's movies were shot on higher contrast film, something that might be 3 under and 5 over, etc. And then there's the color balance. While most stocks were either 32-3600K and 54-5600K, some like certain Fuji stocks had a balance somewhere around 4500K (advertising that you could shoot in daylight or tungsten on the same stock!). Different batches of the same film stock might even respond differently to color. One might have a little bit stronger red midtones, while the other might have more blue in the shadows.  And then there's all the stuff that cinematographers can request be done to the negative at the lab, and to the prints of the film.  That's what I would do if I were trying to replicate the look of an old movie, and do it well lol.  TLDR: Just shooting on film will not solve OP's problem, since there are a lot of variables with different stocks, film batches, processing, and printing methods that cinematographers used back in the day to get the looks they wanted. Not to mention the way they lit and lensed, which was and STILL is WAY more important."

cinematography,3cl0w7,youknowsomeguy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:18:34 2015 UTC,"That's a great lens. I own the 8/19/1.5 and I love it. The difficulty is that you have to focus BOTH the bolex and the prime lens that you connect it to. For example, I'm currently using a voigtlander 40mm prime to which I mount the bolex onto. If my subject is 5 feet away, I have to set both lenses to 5 feet and then tweak them both visually to find focus. Which means you can't really run n gun. There's a new solution called the Focus Module (see anamorphicshop.com )which is a large $700 lens that allows you to focus only using one lens. Got it on order but it looks pretty decent from what I can tell. Good luck."

Based on her body language it looks like she is in deep thought either about what is going on (I'm assuming with her father) or she could be looking at the kid (daughter, niece, sibling, not sure) either way I like the abstract art on the right of her representing the chaos in her life.

The film takes place over the course of one day so I wanted the changes in natural light within the house to be emphasized.  As for lighting, the gaffer and I agreed to use as much natural light and practical bulbs as possible, relying mostly on bounce sources to shape the light. The scene at the Mexican restaurant had the most ""complex"" lighting, with two diffused Arri 650s on dimmers hung from the ceiling."

The only lighting was the lighter our actress used to light her cigarette in the scene and a diffused bounce from a streetlight.
cinematography,3ci8nk,beingnonbeing,2,Wed Jul 8 02:52:33 2015 UTC,I looks like they are using fog or mist filters (such as the Tiffin ProMist series) along with actual fog. Real fog is necessary in the scenes where you see the moving beams of light; no filter can do that.
cinematography,3ci8nk,2old2care,2,Wed Jul 8 03:04:20 2015 UTC,"^  Some of the older Tiffen mist filters will give you more dramatic halation if that is what you're going for. White promist is the way to go. If you're looking for more subtle, the black promist is probably better."

Zeiss Distagon 21mm 2.8 ($900 used) > Sigma 18-35 > Tokina 11-16    Sigma is the most useful and my most used lens tho.    Tokina is much wider tho and is very useful on crop sensors.

cinematography,3chq46,JointOperationsCente,2,Wed Jul 8 23:16:49 2015 UTC,"Even compared to PL mount lenses i've used, the tokina 11-16 2.8 takes the cake. On s35, 11 is crazy wide. On a bmcc, its wide enough for most applications, equivalent to about 16mm on s35mm motion picture film.  (not to be confused with the larger 35mm full frame for photos ).

As for the flare, looks like light is getting in behind the filter and reflecting back into the lens. Make sure you put filters in the tray closest to the front element of the lens and that the mattebox isn't leaking light in there."

Those rando cleaner kits you find online are generally terrible and can screw up your lens coatings. use the tried and true panchro + kimwipes.  Don't forget to clean not only the front and rear elements of your lens, but also the front and back of all of your filters.   Shine a flashlight into your lens, check for any internal dust, haze, or fungus. If you find any either junk it, live with it, or pay money to service it!"
cinematography,3cetx3,Seanzzxx,3,Tue Jul 7 10:37:56 2015 UTC,"XQ is generally for high dynamic range material.  If you are shooting in a variant of a flat profile, for example, in theory it might be worth while.  In my opinion, if working with BM cameras, it is not necessary.  It is more so a good option for 16 bit RAW imagery.  Since the BM cameras are all 12 bit, and ProRes4444 is 12 bit (16 bits with alpha but we're not counting that here), it's an even match.  To be clear, XQ is also 12 bit (16 bits with alpha but we're not counting that here) but the bitrate is inflated to make up for any downconversion from 16 bit.    From Apple's own whitepaper:  • Apple ProRes 4444 XQ: The highest-quality version of Apple ProRes for 4:4:4:4 image sources (including alpha channels), with a very high data rate to preserve the detail in high-dynamic-range imagery...  • Apple ProRes 4444: An extremely high-quality version of Apple ProRes... This codec features full-resolution, masteringquality 4:4:4:4 RGBA color and visual fidelity that is perceptually indistinguishable from the original material.  And for what it's worth, ProRes4444 is about 330mbps, while XQ is about 500mbps.  So, not twice as much as you initially thought."
cinematography,3cetx3,agent42b,2,Tue Jul 7 11:07:33 2015 UTC,"There have been several features shot on 4444 for projection, so it seems like a viable option. XQ is undeniably better but not sure you could tell without doing a side-by-side on a very large screen and really looking for the differences. It probably works very, very well for visual effects shots, as those are the places where little discrepancies matter."
cinematography,3cetx3,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:13:59 2015 UTC,"Arri had a chart they were showing back when XQ was announced that illustrated why you would want to use XQ when possible. It had noise levels for all flavors of ProRes compared to Arriraw.  XQ was by far the closest to Arriraw. I had never considered that a codec can add noise, but it's true, especially for high bitrate DCT codecs. The edges of the tiny macroblocks add noise that was not there in the original image.  This doesn't apply I don't think to really low bitrate MPEG codecs, because they remove so much image detail in order to encode it (compare uncompressed to 35mbs XDCAM HD)  So, I'd shoot XQ whenever able, if it does not crimp abilities elsewhere. But 444 is a big step above HQ, so I would not sweat it too much."

cinematography,3cfkv6,intothemidwest,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:53:45 2015 UTC,"I just saw it again the other day in 35mm at the New Beverly.  I honestly think the cinematography is pretty remarkable. On top of everything else he does, Richardson has a way of squeezing every bit out of his latitude like no one else does, in a way that he can really only do on film. I've never been one to be a film purist or anything, but one of its real objective advantages still is in its highlight rolloff, where footage doesn't clip so much as fade to white.  Richardson capitalizes on this, and creates some really amazing highlights in his shots (eg, top/back light coming from a ceiling, then bouncing off a tabletop to fill in faces). He did some really impressive work with digital latitude on Hugo, but film really allows him to go all-out with it."

cinematography,3cbpgf,Steve-Gary,7,Mon Jul 6 17:45:52 2015 UTC,"Almost everything looks to be budget differences.  Here is what I briefly saw/heard.   More natural lighting (less controlled) Deeper shadows probably goes with less controlled lighting. Background people looking at camera, probably because the production doesn't ""own"" the location Very MIDI sound track Lens flairs Use of zoom; American shows almost never zoom.  I saw 2-3 in this Italian show. Possibly using smaller 2/3"" cameras rather than S35 cameras.  I couldn't get a distinct feel for one or the other.  If I had to guess they are either using Adapted 2/3"" lenses on S35, or some sort of light/cheap run and gun high multiplier zoom on s35. High budget American shows use camera dollies and jibs so the camera has more motion than pan, tilt and zoom.   Bottom line looks like things are shot faster, probably for budget reasons.  They don't take over locations, they don't light much they use zoom lenses.    I have actually had the opportunity work on TV shows in many different countries in Asia, Europe and Latin America, as well as where I live in the USA. The big difference I see when working over seas is that in large part their shows don't ""travel"".  American/Canadian shows are on in just about every country I have been to, which means that we can have higher budgets for our shows, since Italians and French and Koreans and Mexicans and Brazilians are helping pay for our shows.  Spanish language shows do travel a bit, so they get slightly higher budgets than most non-American shows.  This can best be seen in Mexican soaps.  Mexican novellas or soaps frequently look much better than American ones, since the American ones don't travel but the Mexican ones do.  Brazilian shows are also surprisingly good looking.  I'm not quite sure where they get their money, but Brazil does have a large population, which probably helps.   The bottom line is someone has to pay to make the show, and if the government isn't subsidizing it like they do in Taiwan, or it doesn't have a large market like American, and Spanish language shows the budgets can't be all that high. How many countries outside of Italy do you think watch Italian tv?  What do you think the total population is?  Compare that to Game of Thrones or CSI.  I have seen CSI in just about every country I have been to."

cinematography,3cbpgf,super_spyder,4,Mon Jul 6 22:13:44 2015 UTC,"Lots of depth of field in the Italian show (back ground mostly in focus) which leads me to believe small sensor, or slow lens or lens stopped down, because they aren't using ND (takes too much time).  Also the lens flair shot seemed to have lots of lens elements indicative of a high zoom, and they were hexagonal shaped, indicative of a lower cost lens.  Expensive lenses tend to have more aperture blades which would make a much closer to circle shape.  There isn't enough resolution in the stream to be able to tell, but chromatic aberrations would also be a good give away.  2/3"" lenses have LOTS of CA.  However for me the lens the lighting/crowd control is the biggest difference."

cinematography,3cbpgf,carlEdwards,3,Mon Jul 6 20:45:22 2015 UTC,"I didn't look too much.  The biggest difference is cultural story telling styles. American stories tens to be told excessively linear. A leads to B leads to C leads to bad guy losing.   Italian story structure differs with more attention given to the characters.  The second biggest difference is distillation. With local shows you are seeing all of them. With American shows you are seeing only the very best ones.  Third is shot structure. The ones you gave seem to be largely what I would call the soap opera shot style. So compare them to General Hospital and you will see a lot of the same kind of look.   The last big one is also cultural. Americans like strong blacks and strong whites, lots of shadow. From the looks of those, Italian tends to be more even light, to see more.  Those are the differences I see quickly."
cinematography,3cbpgf,lkmeq,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:51:44 2015 UTC,"Seems to be a bit of a lot.  Editing, script pacing, coloring, shooting in broad daylight without shaping the light or controlling it.  Also the fact you see people in the background looking at what is being shot..."
cinematography,3cbpgf,redhandsmeanface,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:57:54 2015 UTC,"And what's your guess on the reason of all of it? I mean: they don't have the equipment or the professionals to improve the quality of the shots? It really gets me crazy, because it's kind of a leit motiv in every tv production here in Italy. Like that's ""the italian look"", and it pisses me off."
cinematography,3cbpgf,Cluesol22,3,Mon Jul 6 19:40:54 2015 UTC,"Not sure,  I know in the states, one can film a season and take months to shoot.  Each episode gets thoughtfully planned before any actors are on set.  Equipment, lighting, etc are all planned out to a tee and they take their time to get it perfected, usually taking a few days to a week and a half or so to get the episode shot.   Shots are blocked out, and every crew member is on point.  This italian show reminds me of the look a lot of Telenovelas have.  Which seems a rushed production and minimal equipment and crew. My experience with telenovelas has always been: show up, we'll figure it out on set, lets not worry about lighting, we are on a tight deadline and budget, so if it looks good enough, lets move on.  In all honesty it looks like this shows production has lack of time, lack of producers who care, lack of lighting equipment, and lack of crew (like seriously, theres people in the background, get extras or have someone move them out the way, hire a cop to block the street)"

It was a cold looking environment, a meeting place just off campus for the robotics team. I wanted to add a little variance in color to the piece, so I cooled it with some 4' daylight tubes. It'll be interesting to note, though, that the close up light for the girls was a 3200k fatman with 1/4 straw booklight through a 4x frame of 216. There are a lot of fluorescents in the piece!

You can put diffusion in the gel holder though it does work somewhat but since the source is already about the size of the gel frame (unlike a fresnel) you aren't going to soften the light much if any. The beam edges will be fuzzier but from 4'+ distance it will still be hard light.   If you want to significantly soften the light from an ellipsoidal par you will need a diffusion frame rigged farther away from the unit.

No compression for web should make you nervous of your own work if you've shot for the edit, framed well and lit for good footage that can then be graded.

I remember reading that Oliver Stone had them put the negative on the ground and scrape rocks over it (or something similar).  From IMDB:  ""So, why does the film look the way it does? Is there a thematic reason for it to look this way, or was it all done for empty effect? Does the unique form of the film in some way reflect the content, or is the form arbitrarily generated irrespective of content, or, worse still, is the form an attempt to cover up a lack of content? What aspects of the story prompted the filmmakers to frequently cut to black and white, to use 16mm in the middle of a scene shot in 35mm, to cut from animation to live action, to use rear projection etc?  Oliver Stone has always maintained that the film looks the way it does for a very specific reason, that the form and the content are very much linked, and whenever a scene looks a particular way, there is always a very good reason for that scene to look that way.  In his director's commentary track, Stone provides a great deal of information about the aesthetic of the movie, often going into detail about why the film looks the way it does. Unless otherwise noted, the following quotes come from the commentary to either the theatrical release or the Director's Cut (NOTE: the two commentaries are different in certain sections of the film).  Firstly, Stone discourages the viewer from attempting to unravel the meaning of every single format shift, and from reading profound meaning into every little stylistic nuance. Sometimes, the format switches simply 'felt' right: ""Don't expect to understand every change-over. It plays off texture, instinct, deconstruction of reality.""  On the other hand however, Stone is unequivocally clear in his reasoning as to why a multi-format approach was taken in the first place, and that that approach very much carries thematic weight and works in tandem with the content of the film to establish theme: ""We really mixed stocks, Super 8, 16mm, 35, video, animation, to disorientate, to deconstruct.

cinematography,3by9bm,kwmcmillan,2,Fri Jul 3 10:27:34 2015 UTC,Works great as a monitor but it gets reeeally mental when you start feeding it four 3G HD SDI feeds. Ideally you'd want A and B cam live and A and B cam playback as a quad out one of the SDI outs but it really struggled. It's probably just a case of a firmware update but right now it feels like a prototype.   Also the unit automatically stops recording upon signal loss which is very annoying. And also the file naming system insists on four characters and four alphanumerics. A simple A001 would suffice.   Edit: you can fix signal loss recording issue by feeding it through a decimator but that's a hassle.

You can bend them to the curve of the roof (if it's curved) and they are super light weight so velcro works well to hold them up. You will need a lot of them to combat the sunlight if you have a bunch of wide shots where you're seeing a bunch of the bus. If you have a bunch of tight two shots or singles, you can use a front fill to even it out and let the window key them. Can you rig a small generator to the roof and cable in through an open window?

cinematography,3bwtke,colorhope,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:18:44 2015 UTC,"Exciting! I hope you have a blast travelling.  In terms of weight, you can't argue much with the A7s. It's dynamic range and high native ISO help with doc style shooting, but the rolling shutter is VERY BAD. Even tripod work on the A7s gets the jello effect. I would assume the same with the A7 II.  For the price range you're looking for (and at 4K) you won't be able to find a suitable camera.  Investing into a camera isn't cheap, and expecting higher end features at a lower price will yield bad results. The black magic cameras have a rabid fanbase. The truth, however, is that the cameras are poorly made and will hurt you more in image and post.  Why do you need 4k? Are the EPK gig(s) being required to shoot in 4K? There's really not a point in recording to 4k if no one will see it in 4k. Additionally, it doesn't make life better in post. (More pixels does not mean better color grading)  For your budget, your best options are the Canon C100, Sony A7s or A7II, or a GH4 (with a Metabones Speedbooster).  However, I recommend investing more into your camera package and get the Sony FS7 with the extension unit. I'll add up quickly and be pricey, but it's quickly becoming the standard camera for EPK and other non-narrative based work."
cinematography,3bwtke,luckycockroach,2,Fri Jul 3 05:10:48 2015 UTC,"4k is actually better in post, due to downsampling a 420 4k image can effectively be a 422 HD image.  Otherwise solid advice"
cinematography,3bwtke,domino_jordan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:56:08 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, chroma subsampling doesn't work that way.  Chroma subsampling happens when the image is recorded. If you record at a 4:2:0 ratio, then it will always be a 4:2:0 ratio at any resolution.  Chroma keying a 4k image is better because there are more pixels for the software to distinguish between the green/blue and other pixels, but it doesn't mean more color information to color grade with."
cinematography,3bwtke,luckycockroach,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:11:36 2015 UTC,Its a bit dubiouse but as there are 4 times as many pixels downsampling accuratly increses the sampling depth.  One of many sources.  It may in fact be false but as far as I can tell its true.

Like I said I also want to be able to take stills as well as travel light.   Also, don't get me wrong I know what you mean for the EPK but for me, they are still going to provide cameras if they don't approve of mine. I was just trying to put some more money in my pocket type thing if I provide the camera. That is not as important to me.  I think from all the cameras I am hearing, the GH4 is the one to go. I am surprised the Black Magic was not a frontrunner. I thought people loved that camera."

Shooting 4K with the GH4 will change your life. It's great, too, that it does 4K internally and so very small and lightweight. I also highly recommend the Lumix/Leica 25mm f/1.4 lens. You can shoot almost anything with that lens the re-compose or zoom in during editing. I would find it hard to go back to any other camera."

Yes, that means 8-bit an only represent *1.6% * of 10-bit color space.  The C300 is a good camera, and canon color is unmatched (other than by arri) but it's a camera designed for televised productions or other productions where post processing would be kept to a minimum.

It really depends, if you're willing to always massage your footage in post for color/skintone, the ursa is most likely a better camera with more post opportunities. But 9/10, of you aren't good with post color, the canon will more easily give you a consistently better image."

It's just going to be very obvious as the light changes as you move down the hallway  2) You say it's supposed to be darkish/zombie... just let it go darker and don't worry so much about cranking the iso or opening the aperture. This will also help obscure anything that's a bit out of focus.  3) Definitely no way to blast some more light in there?  4) To strictly answer your question, I would focus on... I dunno. Maybe halfway between the fire extinguisher on the right and the closest doorway. That'll give you a good distance to keep a lot in focus without throwing either the far foreground or far background out. But it also really depends on where you're starting and ending the shot. But besides any notable elements that may come into frame... it's just a hallway. And you're walking through it. Just get something in focus at all times and your audience won't hate you too much."

If you are going for more industrial I would put some indirect incandescent lighting probably practical and shoot it dark. Are you coming from light? Are you going toward light?"

If not, then having to crank up ISO/aperture will hurt the look of the film. What will help alleviate that at this point is having the smoothest shot possible while moving down the hall. What does your stability options look like? Do you have a dolly? Glidecam? Steadicam? Slider? Or are you just walking with the camera in your hand? If it's the latter, it will leave you with shaky, grainy footage that I am guessing was not part of the original aesthetic. The lighting will be more forgiving if you find a way to make the movement smoooooth. Once because of lack of equipment, I stood on a longboard and had someone push me slowly. Think out of the box, and remember safety! If there was anything you can do about those lights though... do it! Good luck, and post results.   EDIT: Absolutely don't put a light on your camera.

Dof shouldn't be too shallow, even wide open at 35mm and below. Adding light will definitly help you with dof and sharpness though.  For light, i'd maybe look into replacing those flourescent tubes with prettier ones. That or maybe hanging some incandescents along the cieling, maybe with shades on top to kill spill, and killing the flouresent tubes all together.  You might also aim something bright onto that back wall, and maybe a different color than the hallway to add some depth. Could motivated it with light from the previous room, and red from an exit sign, daylight color, etc.  I Definitely would not use a camera mounted light, unless its some sort of dream sequence or found footage movie!

cinematography,3boarm,BullMoosePictures,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:28:25 2015 UTC,"My situation is a little bit clouded.    I began work at this production house as a 1099 employee (probably wrongfully so, as I was working full time at the facility, using their equipment, computers, software etc.) as a temporary position until, I guess, I proved myself to be obviously competent enough for a full time position.  I had signed an independent contractor agreement which covered those first two months, which explicitly stated I was not an employee of the company.  This agreement lasted for two months, like I said, until the point where I was made a full time employee and had to fill out a W-4.  Therefore, the independent contractor agreement was terminated and I was never asked to sign another contract.  Though, I read this in the independent contractor agreement:   ""All inventions or creations that the Contractor develops or creates or assists in developing or creating during, and beyond, the term of this Agreement will belong, including all rights to these technologies, to the Company. Any use beyond the Company or reselling of any invention or creation will be a breach of this covenant.""   Does this mean that the contract is covering things I create, even after its termination?  I'm not sure how this can extend past the work I did as an independent contractor when the entire agreement was written in for only those two months, upon which the agreement would be, and was, terminated.  I'm 50/50 sure that if I ask they will allow it, but I would like to know, legally where I am covered if I wanted to use this raw footage in a reel in the case that I end up heading to another city to look for a new position in a year, for instance.  I'd rather not have to go through a cease and desist on all of the work that I personally did, even though it might be ""property"" of the company in some way.

cinematography,3boagv,hebrewdq,5,Tue Jun 30 20:33:57 2015 UTC,"Before you get downvoted to hell...  The focal length is still 24mm, but you would see the same field of view of a 35mm lens on a 35mm still camera. It's important to talk in terms of field of view.  You would have a greater depth of field on the 24mm/APS-C camera compared to a 35mm/full frame camera at equivalent apertures and equivalent framing and focus distance.  Aperture and sensor size can be thought of as two sides of getting the depth of field you may be looking for. For example, a 25mm f1.4 lens on a micro four thirds camera (if that lens existed) could look the same as a 50mm f2.8 lens on a full frame camera (3:2 vs 4:3 proportions aside). This is because while the m4/3 sensor is half the height and half the width, the aperture is letting four times the amount of light in (transmission issues aside). Where is this extra light coming from? It's all the less-direct (unfocused) light that is still hitting the lens, resulting in soft bokeh.  I don't know how the a7 samples from the sensor, but I know that in my case DX crop is not up to par with FX mode, because of the way Nikon is sampling the sensor with line skipping and horizontal binning. I would be concerned about that more than anything else."

cinematography,3boagv,roughnecktwozero,2,Wed Jul 1 00:53:54 2015 UTC,"Also keep in mind that while it's true that DoF will not change, the narrower field of view will change how far you are from your subject.

Since the camera is closer, the DoF will be shallower. You get less DoF with full frame because you can get closer to your subject or use a longer lens"
cinematography,3boagv,Bryxis_ESQ,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:46:33 2015 UTC,"Depth of field does, indeed change. Depth of field is dependent on the circle of confusion, which differs with different sensor sizes.  If you put the same lens focused to the same distance with the same aperture on range of different cameras, you'll see a change in depth of field.  http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/dof-calculator.htm  Also, if you put an 80mm f/2 on a FF cam and a 50mm f/2 on a 1.6x crop cam (equivalent fields of view, same f-number), you won't get the same depth of field. You have to bump the 80mm all the way up to f/1.2 to get the same depth of field with the same field of view."
cinematography,3boagv,LochnessDigital,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:58:35 2015 UTC,"Does that mean I get the same compression I would with a ~35mm lens, or is the image just being cropped from a larger field of view to a smaller one, making the compression the same as it would be on a 24mm, just with a smaller frame?   I'm about to blow your mind right now. Ready?  The compression is a factor of your camera distance to your subject, not the focal length.  Now, the reason people say that longer lenses compress the space more is because they have to move the camera to get the same framing. A medium shot on a 35mm will have a different feel than a medium shot on a 24mm.  Think about it this way. When you zoom in with a lens while keeping the camera in the same position, the relationship between your subject and background do not change. You're just punching in. This is why zooms are often considered ""boring"" (just generalizing, they have their uses!) in cinematography as they do not change the perspective. Cropping in post is doing exactly the same thing. Having a smaller sensor does exactly the same thing again. It's all just a matter of how much of the view you can see.  This is why we can talk about ""effective focal length"" when comparing two sensor sizes, because the perspective is the same.   So to answer your question, your 24mm in APS-C mode will have the field of view of a 35mm in FF mode, yes. But the perspective will only become more compressed when you back up to fit everything in frame again.  Now, to answer your question about depth of field, the full frame will always have shallower depth of field than a crop sensor cam (for a given focus distance, focal length and aperture) because it has a larger circle of confusion, which is a complex topic for another day. That all gets thrown out the window when you have to change camera positions and change your focus distance to compensate. So here's a useful tool to keep bookmarked:  http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/dof-calculator.htm"

Also, matteboxes with flags or failing that, a lens hood goes a long way to keeping flare and low contrast glare out of your shot which is very hard to correct for.    A good trick is to use the late afternoon sun as a hair/back light and fill in your actors with bounce or reflectors. Avoid midday sun at all costs unless the film calls for it. Eg. someone melting in the desert."

cinematography,3blc6p,dougman3000,3,Tue Jun 30 15:16:02 2015 UTC,"If your shooting a short film in daylight and you don't have money for lighting here are my tips... and before you use any of these tips first consider this: Does it make sense for what happening in the scene. This is the most important thing here... just because it looks better at sunset doesn't mean you should neccesarilly shoot at sunset. Above how pretty the image could look your there to help the story so it has to make sense, BUT with that said... i also don't believe in lighting continuity and I don't think anyone really notices that shit.  Tips (lots of opinions here btw): Lets start with a general look at light during the day. Its summer which means the sun gets up there almost directly above us by high noon (also depends on what hemisphere your in). Take a look at subjects faces from different angles at this time and notice how it looks like shit... you have deep shadows in the eyes when the sun hits there faces and everything in you background is bright as shit. Not a lot of contrast between bright and dark. I avoid shooting in direct light during these times. which is around 10:30-3PM depending on the season. Instead I would demand to shoot any indoor scenes at this time or simple block the subjects in shade. In this environment you can bounce and reflect direct sunlight and use it to shape the face and give rims ext...  Positioning When shooting in direct sulight at other times of day you need to be in complete control of where that camera is pointing and if it means cheating blocking between shots to keep you rim or backlight do it. don't just move somewhere because thats where the actor is facing and thats the shot you need... cheat and keep the lighting looking sick.  Lighting: OK it amazes me how few DPs I see actually do this... but you basically have bazzilion K HMI in the sky all day. Get fucking mirror board. It's cheap as shit from rental house or buy the damn stuff. ALL the sudden you have another sun coming from whatever direction you want. Sometimes ill shoot mirror into bead to get more out of my bounce or put mirror board through some diff and give a soft backlight when i can't do it with blocking. If your shooting in sunlight you have to have mirrors... and think about how much you can do in shade. Just shoot some light to your set with a mirror and play with it.  Camera/Lensing This is honestly just a tip in general for shooting anything but it works in the daytime as well. Deakins has belittled this point but he's on another level so for now if you start doing this it'll make you shit look more pro... Why did you decide to shoot your wide on a 35mm? or a 25mm? or wider? Yes its called the wide but your shooting a low budget short and you probably don't have a hollywood location with PD and lighting. My biggest peice of advice is shoot your wides (if physically possible) on and 85mm or higher. Fuck, shoot your mediums on 85mm or higher. Just shoot on longer lenses but don't let it get shaky. longer lenses compress the background and give you control of what people are seeing without showing everything. Wide lenses all you feel movement so for stedicam and dolly shots they work especially pull ins or pushes. Also doorway dollys and track are cheap to rent. throw some 85mm dolly shots on there with some backlight sun and i bet you'll be stoked on what your getting. Use ND filters and shoot between F2.8-5.6. Any more open and your focus puller will hate you and nothing will be in focus, but you at least want to throw the background out a bit.  Last thing, most important thing too. DON'T OVER EXPOSE. don't let your sky blowout... do whatever it takes. don't let anything go white. its always better to underexpose than overexpose. seriously... The only acceptable time to let something blow out is when its the sun. cause like... that shit is just too bright.  hope this was helpful...."
cinematography,3blc6p,Nighthawkk41,2,Tue Jun 30 17:45:01 2015 UTC,I disagree with always using an 85mm. Lensing should always be chosen based on the script and tone. Sure an 85mm is generally a prettier look but if that's not what you're going for then don't do it. Wide lensing may give you exactly what you need to get your ideas across.
cinematography,3blc6p,dougman3000,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:35:31 2015 UTC,"Absolutely don't disagree with you at all. I usually shoot with a 50 if I'm being honest and the amount of wide angle lenses I uses varies project to project. But if your just trying to make what you shoot look more aesthetically pleasing across the board, try shooting on longer lenses. For example, shoot your full body wide by backing up and shooting on a 100mm or above. Then shoot the same thing by moving forward and using a 35. Choose for yourself but I prefer the former a lot of the time, especially OUTDOORS which is the the question here.  Also roger deakins talks shit on DPs who use this very tequniqe because its a cope out to making beautiful images. But once you know what works you can stop just doing it for the sake of it being a beautiful image."

Maybe during the conversion to rec 709 they took some of the green out. I am curious because I, too, remember more green then what the DVD version is showing. In my opinion, I think the Blu -Ray colored version is way better then the DVD version. The DVD version has too many pinks and magenta in the skin tones. It also has a weird flatness to its contrast. If you notice they are not really throwing away any blacks in the new graded version they are just adding contrast to the upper half of the picture. This makes the faces stick out more and gives them the ""Action"" pop that the original version lacked.  Also for those of you who are wondering, this is common to recolor a feature when they remaster it or make dubs for blurays."
cinematography,3bin88,the_colorist,7,Mon Jun 29 18:38:34 2015 UTC,"Looks to me like in 99 it wasn't much of a grade at all. Just what was timed in a print (internegative?) and if it was sans the supervision of the Wachowskis or the DP, then they probably just saw fit to make sure the original desires for the theatrical prints made it to DVD, and called it a day.  That DVD was made before DIs were really happening. Grading a feature then meant printer points and maybe doing bleach bypass for a look like the OG Matrix.  Taking the original Neg in 201X and making a BluRay, I'm sure the Wachowskis wanted to take advantage of everything a modern DI system has to offer."

cinematography,3bj5vq,mortichro,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:54:58 2015 UTC,We usually put the dimmer on the 1.2kw to low while firing to avoid spikes on the 2000i then gradually bring it up to full. That was my experience using the suitcase genny.   I dunno if this is a good idea but it works for me.
cinematography,3bivsc,VintageRuins,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:21:52 2015 UTC,"A lightly built out RED should come in at ~14lbs, my reasoning broken down below. That said, a clip on mattebox may work, but skip renting the motion PL mount and look into renting a set of Series 9 filters and a step up ring as a backup for weight reduction. Should be a cheaper and more readily available solution unless you're flying wide lenses.   A RED (either Epic or Scarlet) brain is roughly 5lbs Considering a baseplate and rods for whatever battery plate and a Dionic or IDX battery and you're looking at 4lbs additional. Possible weight reduction could be a Redvolt in the side handle if you have it, could reduce the weight to just 1lb here for power. The CP2's are all around 2-2.2lbs.  If you're looking at some remote focus, the Bartech receiver is lighter than Preston's MDR but if you consider the receiver, cables, and a single motor, that's roughly another 2lbs.   This should be a reminder that weighing your camera build is a good idea during prep.  Edit: apparently CP2s don't have front threading so you may need to go motion mount. Look at the specs more closely and Series 9 would have to be tested on every lens for vignetting.  I would consider a set of standard 138mm round ND filters that you could tape to the front, I believe the wider lenses in the set don't stick out beyond the front of the housing but I could be wrong.  Edit edit: /u/ugman77 brings up a good point of moving the batteries to the operator. This would remove the battery, of course, as well as one of the rods if you consider still needing a remote focus motor."
cinematography,3bivsc,kissmyrobot,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:55:16 2015 UTC,"Not sure we'll be able to move the battery off-camera but after checking with my AC/Ronin operator, they said that on set of The Expendables they actually just lined lenses with gaff tape and then taped the filters onto the lens without an issue. Seems cost-efficient and easy enough for a solution since we don't actually need the barn doors of a matte box. Hoping it works! Thanks a ton for the thorough response."

We used the LMB-3 together with 4x5,65 filters using a vertical filter holder (I think the ones you would use with a MB-18?). Our setup was the Ronin, Red Epic, Arri UMC-3 and CLM-3 motor. Battery was attached to a belt with an XLR cable and a Teradek Bolt Transmitter on the Ronin handle."

We have put the battery in backpacks, of simply used velco to put it on top the ronin handle.  Otherwise, you end up taping on filters which is the biggest pain."

It was a panavised Sony f55 with a zoom and a ton of accessories. Probably in the sixty pound range. So it was a lot to get it on and off the easy rig. We found having a double apple box nearby to stage it on made it easy to mount and dismount.

cinematography,3bhhhr,Orc_,7,Mon Jun 29 06:53:05 2015 UTC,"There's a bunch of stuff.  A lot of video is overly sharpened. That gives it away pretty quick.  Film handles highlights really well: they roll off gently into white and they don't shift hues. Video cameras have a hard time with this. Often you'll see weird color shifts as the color channels approach clipping, then clipped channels look slightly off white or a weird harsh-edged electronic white. (Arri is the only company that has really figured out how not to do this.)  Video color is most saturated in highlights. Film color is most saturated in shadows. Arri is the only company that gets the film look on video by saturating lowlights and limiting saturation in highlights.  Different companies have different ideas about how color should look. Canon, for example, makes everyone's flesh tone orange, and pushes reds toward orange as well. Sony has issues with overly saturated yellows and their color isn't as ""organic."" Arri's colors are mostly dead on.  Codecs are important. How compressed the data is, how it is subsampled, what color space it's recording, gamma curve, bitd epth etc. all make a difference. For example, DSLR footage tends to be very low resolution due to the pixel binning that's required to dumb a still sensor down to HD resolution, plus the codec is typically low bitrate 4:2:0 subsample 8-bit color. Fine detail dissolves into mush, color can be murky and hues tend to show little subtlety.  To say something is ""digital cinema"" and therefore you can spot the look isn't really accurate. Alexa and F65 look great. F55 looks pretty amazing too. The new Canon C300Mk2 is supposed to be very good, although everything looks like it was shot at sunset due to the way they handle flesh tone and reds. C300 looks cheap because it's highly compressed 8-bit color with maybe ten stops of dynamic range. The Mk2 supposedly has 10-bit and 14 stops of dynamic range, and if so it will look much, much better.  There's more, but I'm tired of typing. :)"
cinematography,3bhhhr,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:22:59 2015 UTC,"Spot on, though I'd just like to add C300 is 12 stops, MkII is 15 stops (claimed) and can even shoot 12 bit @ 2K."
cinematography,3bhhhr,Alexiumz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:49:18 2015 UTC,"It might be 12 stops, but I'm skeptical. I know in Rec 709 mode I only get about 3.5 stops of overexposure headroom before clip, and in log that goes to 4.5... but I almost never shoot log with a C300. 8-bit doesn't stretch very well in post, and if one of my clients is going to shoot log we'll typically have the money for a better camera.  I'll be curious to see what the Mk2 can really do. Bummer that it won't go past 60fps, though."
cinematography,3bhhhr,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:14:58 2015 UTC,"120fps @ 2K (cropped) I believe.

Arri's colors are mostly dead on.   This definitely rings true to my experiences. Would like to hear your opinion on how RED handles it, especially vs Arri."
cinematography,3bhhhr,happybarfday,3,Tue Jun 30 20:56:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know that RED has a philosophy. I know their color scientist and he's never really talked about one... I should ask him sometime. I think he's going for the truest color possible given the sensor he has to work with--and it seems to have a lot of red/blue crossover, especially under tungsten light, so he's got to work around that.  Arri comes at color from a film perspective. They attempt to emulate the subtractive color film process rather than the additive color process inherent to video cameras. That means they try to saturate lowlights and limit saturation in highlights, the way film does, rather than let colors get more saturated as they get brighter, the way video normally does.  Also, Arri seems to do a LOT of noise reduction in a number of different places in order to get the best color possible. RED doesn't do any noise processing other than black shading, or so I'm told, which means the cameras are noisier but you have more flexibility in post to move white balance around."
cinematography,3bhhhr,ArtAdamsDP,5,Tue Jun 30 22:09:15 2015 UTC,DSLRs generally have much more crushed blacks and whites as they have much much less dynamic range than any cinema camera . Compare a RED or Arri to a 5D and that's the big noticeable difference in quality( amongst other things)
cinematography,3bhhhr,69ingChipmunkzz,4,Mon Jun 29 09:08:47 2015 UTC,Yeah I believe ARRI advertises 14 stops of DR and the 5D3 is estimated to be around 10 stops.  Apparently with ML you can shoot in dual ISO mode and cover a lot more range.
cinematography,3bhhhr,howdareyou,2,Mon Jun 29 14:19:15 2015 UTC,"It's not only dynamic range. Of course digital has a linear response to light and film has it's S curve (crushed blacks but soft highlights), but it seems there is more to it. This was a quote from somebody about the Arri Alexa (can't remember the source though, sorry): „the alexa has this thing that it does only saturate colors to a certain point (like half grey) and then colors get brighter of course, but not more saturated. and that is exactly what film does. they did a great job emulating that.“"
cinematography,3bhhhr,vinti,5,Mon Jun 29 15:34:06 2015 UTC,"Yup, that was me. :) They're the only company that attempts to control color saturation that matches what film does. Film is a subtractive process so colors are most saturated in the low lights, while video is an additive process so colors are most saturated in the highlights. Companies that have made video cameras for a long time can't break away from that inherent video look, whereas a company that made film cameras had no problem doing that."
cinematography,3bhhhr,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:15:02 2015 UTC,"That's a big question. If you work in the industry it's relatively easy to pick out a camera based on it's inherent ""look.""

Modern vfx is very detailed and complicated, but doesn't have character and and doesn't feel organic. They're plastic and fake feeling. His example of the new Mad Max is a great example of CG done right. Lots of in camera effects with CG cleverly integrated into it. Films like the Avengers and Transformers are examples of it done wrong, a shit salad of CG on top of CG with CG sprinkled on it. It doesn't matter if it looks detailed and has a million layers of backgrounds and textures, theres nothing grounded in reality for your brain to relate to. 90's CG, although more basic, integrated its CG elements much better with practical effects making it more believable than modern films. Not better looking individual elements, but a more believable effect overall. Just look at how well the first T-rex scene in Jurassic Park holds up."

By doing that we didn't have to ""scrub"" any unwanted weird colors, or add contrast by crushing the blacks and lifting the highlights that would most likely hurt the image. We shot on cinelike-d in 4k and gave it a super light color pass in FCPX. The gh4 can be tricky but once you get the hang of it it's a pretty powerful little guy. Hope this helps."

Maybe I'll mock up a multicolored ""plug"" to help find the opening size since it'll be wishing critical focus to use text. Or just start small and move out.  Though I know for example the 14mm is a viewing angle of 115.7°, so in theory if I know the distance of the matte from the end of front element, say 8"" and the native aspect ratio of the sensor, I should be able to work out the dimensions of the field of vision.

If there is vignetting, I'll use a matte with a bigger hole.  The take away from this is, make a range of mattes, and don't put lens markings on them. It's just a bit of trial and error."

I know sometimes it's frustrating to have comments just be ""good job"" and move on without notes, but I honestly have nothing really constructive to add. You do some really excellent work. I especially like your work on the wides. The frame feels weighted/focused really well, if that makes sense?  If you don't mind me asking, what sort of luts are you working with? I tend to be on the Kodak 2383/2393, but I really dig the look of what you're doing here, especially the curve. Highlights may be a little too teal for me at times? But that's insanely nitpicky.

I've used those LUTs with all of them with no problems (though many projects I don't use those LUTs because I want something with more of that steely digital polish). I have my 6D for still photography but haven't tried RAW yet because I don't have the SD Card storage for it. Looks great though!  But yeah without LUTs, where's that grain coming from? It's really natural-looking. Impressive stuff.  Final note on LUTs, these are what I'm hoping to look into at some point in the near future, not looking to spend the money yet haha.

But as long as it's applied in the settings as an overall output node for a timeline instead on the first node, you don't loose any latitude for the grading. It also softens up the falloffs in the highlights a lot, which is really nice. Apparently the Impulz ones are better/less rough on footage, so I'll see how they work.  And that's totally fair. The size of the One especially makes it incredibly unwieldy.   As far as FilmConvert, when does that fall into your workflow compared to Resolve?"

This would be an automatic veto in my book. I know it's really tough when you're struggling to get footage, but just be patient, work on your own short films (which you should be doing anyway, as a student) and use other footage you get from school projects. Volunteer on your friends' projects. Go shoot your buddy's concert for him. Whatever. Please don't just go out and shoot footage for your reel.  Second of all, the thing is all this reel shows me is that you can operate a camera... kinda. I'm going to assume all those shakes and jitters and constant canted angles were on purpose, but the problem is I don't really know so while I'll hope for the best and that you have talent, if I'm looking to hire you I can't really be sure so I'd probably pass.  Now, maybe if I were really interested I'd go look at your portfolio the clips came from... except I can't because you just went out and shot these for your reel, so there is no portfolio.  You didn't light anything here, so I'm not going to hire you for anything that needs lighting, but you also aren't showing me particularly striking framing or composition. So again, we're back to... you can operate a camera. And that's all you're showing me. And maybe not even particularly well.  So yeah. It's nice starter footage.

Yeah shooting just for the purpose of the reel wasnt ideal but at college i was put into a games design course which was not my choice so to get into film and uni i needed to do something to show them. The only reason i didnt use lighting, although i thought about natural lighting was well i did not have any money at all to shed out.  To go along with this the uni were well aware it was put together purely for an interview so i built up scenarios for each part which gave a basic story line. I then went to break down some of the shots ad showed why i chose certain movements and composition. The only time i ever used a camera was for photography which i did in my own time, used in this is literally the very first time i pressed the record button, i just didn't have time to during the project to do more.

cinematography,3azlii,sonofaresiii,3,Thu Jun 25 12:58:23 2015 UTC,"Alright man, one last piece of advice, and I understand you're young and learning so I'm just telling you what I wish someone had told me before I had to figure it out for myself:  Never, ever, ever make excuses for your work. Never explain why something isn't as good as it could be. Literally no one cares. ""All that matters is what's on screen when the lights go down."" I don't care why you didn't light it. Makes zero difference to me. I was just informing you that without having things you lit, I would not consider you for a role where you'd need to light things (meaning nothing besides nature-type documentary work or something).  And I'm only saying this because-- if someone's looking to hire you, they also do not care why you didn't light it. They simply don't give a shit. You didn't, it wasn't present in your reel, that's all that matters.  I also don't care that you didn't have time to shoot full projects. I don't care that this is all you had, or that you had no experience with cameras before.  The only time you talk about what limited your work is when someone asks ""So tell me about some of the challenges you faced on this project."" Then you talk about what was difficult, and you also talk about how you solved that problem. Besides that, you stand by your work and take responsibility for it while accepting your regrets (we all have them), because it's done now, and if anything wasn't good enough that's your fault, not someone or something else's fault.  No excuses.  Alright. Hope that wasn't too harsh. Hope you get on to some good projects and keep shooting.  Again, best of luck.  ps it's also okay to talk about what went wrong when it's, like, a really funny story."

He had an interesting ""I did it this way because that's how it needed to be done"" attitude, which is pretty inspiring to pick up on. Especially when talking about lenses and camera placement. He blew my mind when he said that a 40mm worked for one actor's close up but would have been a horrible choice on another based on their facial structure and how it gets represented on screen. I have to admit that I've fallen into a rut with which lenses I use for certain types of shots. Now I know that I should throw that knowledge away and assess the scene and my actors like Pierre does. Each and every shot needs the same level of treatment and effort.  I thought it was pretty good.

cinematography,3av0er,demb3k,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:09:45 2015 UTC,"So, it's not odd that some people would assume they are the same thing?  Why aren't all lenses rated for T-Stops? Why does the F-stop matter at all to the average photographer or cinematographer who isn't some sort of camera engineer?"
cinematography,3av0er,imscammer15,7,Tue Jun 23 19:18:12 2015 UTC,It is odd people think they are the same thing. Going by f stop will give you a more accurate measurement of depth of field.  T Stop will give you a better measurement of exposure. I  would speculate most lenses don't have it because the t stop will be slower thus not good for marketing.  That Canon 50 f/1.2L could be closer to a 50 t/1.4 in reality.  The 70-200 2.8L is closer to a t/3.0. Prosumers don't really need to be as accurate as T stops and many modern day DSLRs have optional features where it adjust exposure  to adjust for loss of light or vignetting thus making the f stop close to the t stop with in camera processing.
cinematography,3av0er,blancblanket,6,Tue Jun 23 19:37:18 2015 UTC,"Good cine lenses are rated for T-stops, but it's impractical for the general audience for a variety of reasons. But it's a good question, because T-values are very relevant when buying lenses (and often ignored).  I often shoot interviews with a 24-70 f/2.8 and a 70-200 f/2.8 on two c100's. Butone is T3, the other is T3.4; I always have to up the iso 1/3 or 2/3 of a stop on the camera using the 70-200. For identical exposures, it would be way easier if I could set similar Tstops and be done with it. However, this would cause a few problems:   T-stops are often very odd numbers, like T2.1, T3.4, etc. If I add an ND filter, or need to do exposure compensation in any other way, I really wouldn't know how to do the math. Something with square root n stuff like that, but it would be a pain. T-stop only says something about transmittance. F-stops are still relevant for DOF, for example. I can set two lenses at f/2.8 and they'll have the same DOF, while transmittance may be T2.9 and the other T5. If it were the other way around, I'd have no idea what my DOF is going to be when I set it at T4 with two different lenses. It might be f/2 and it might be f/4.  I don't think many manufactures see it as a selling point. A perfect lens would have an identical f and T value. But lenses are imperfect. For example, Canons kit (f/3.5 - 5.6) has a T4.9, and probably a T8 at the long end. Who would buy a lens like that? Only manufacturers with great Tvalues will happily supply them, such as Zeiss, Canon Prime and Cooke."
cinematography,3av0er,ArtAdamsDP,3,Tue Jun 23 20:06:06 2015 UTC,"f/stop is the ratio of the focal length of the lens to the diameter of the lens aperture. It is a mathematical measurement that should predict, in a perfectly clear lens, how much light is reaching the film/sensor.  In reality, though, light scatters and is lost on its way through the lens, especially in lenses with lots of elements (like zooms). If you measure the exact amount of light reaching the film/sensor and compensate for the amount of light lost, that's the T-stop.  So, for example, T2.8 might actually be f/2.5, because the aperture must be 1/3 stop wider to get the amount of light to the film/sensor that should be reaching it if no light was lost at f/2.8.  Or, to explain another way, if 25fc of light entered the front of the lens at f/2.8 then only 21fc may actually reach the film/sensor, with 4fc scattered and absorbed within the lens. By opening the stop to f/2.5 and labeling it as T2.8 the cinematographer is guaranteed the same exposure from lens to lens, even though different amounts of light may reach the sensor in a prime set at f/2.8 and a zoom at f/2.8. Set them both at T2.8 and you've got an exposure match.  T-stops are determined by the manufacturer based on measurements of light passed through the lens.  Depth of field, however, is always based on f/stop, because physics are based on the actual size of the aperture, not the amount of light reaching the film/sensor."

cinematography,3av0er,BurnetRhoades,-5,Wed Jun 24 15:40:47 2015 UTC,"They're not the same thing. F-stops are a mathematical calculation of the amount of light transmitted through the lens, assuming 100% efficiency. T-stops are the actual amount of light transmitted through the lens, since lenses cannot transmit light with 100% efficiency.   T-stops are more accurate and you should always prefer them over f-stops."
cinematography,3av0er,LochnessDigital,3,Tue Jun 23 20:36:04 2015 UTC,"Looks like you need to read the explanations below.  For starters, F-stop doesn't measure light at all, it's a physical measurement of the iris opening relative to the focal length."

I did a 35mm shoot in the desert with some 500T and the dark eyepiece didn't make operating any easier.  Behind the lens ND would have been beneficial.  50D would have been better in my situation.

They actually managed to get Roger Deakins to come in and basically teach animators.  But combining CGI with real photography isn't easy. Lighting it properly is key, and isn't easy in a green box.  Lubezki won an Oscar for Gravity, Miranda won one for Pi, Richardson won one for Hugo, and Fiore won one for Avatar. I think it's safe to say heavy CGI movies need great cinematographers."
cinematography,3av16d,sb4l,5,Tue Jun 23 19:36:38 2015 UTC,The Academy gave Claudio an award he didn't deserve for Life of Pi because they don't understand the process.  Lubezki's award for Gravity is maybe a little more deserved because he was at least present for at least some parts of the process (where Miranda was not).  It is still a form of cinematography but it's often far more collaborative and what you see is the result of many more cooks than with traditional cinematography.  Digital animation and cinematography is a combination of virtually all forms of artistic stagecraft done in a different way (edit: and with no physical limitations except those self-imposed and modeled into the process).
cinematography,3av16d,BurnetRhoades,0,Tue Jun 23 20:37:39 2015 UTC,"Careful when you say Miranda didn't deserve his Oscar.

He didn't even light all of the greenscreens himself and this film is almost entirely a GS plate shoot.  (edit: cue The Bobs: ""what is it that you do here?"")  Even when they were handing him the award they didn't use the short film worth of footage he was actually, truly responsible for, they were playing clips from on the ocean where he maybe lit an actor and a dingy taking up a portion of the frame."

Lots of DPs don't light green screens, it's often left to the rigging gaffer and the VFX supervisor. It's a highly technical task that requires almost zero creativity.   The point here is where does the visual creative element come from? Sure the VFX team did all the technical work to 90% of the image. But someone had to say... ""Hey, that light (be it created in post or not) should be this quality, this amount, and come from this direction--because it will make the audience feel this way."" And that was Claudio, and that's why he got the Oscar.   edit: changed ""gaffer"" to ""rigging gaffer"""

It seems you get a good picture at an f/4, so that's what's got me thinking there is simply too much light hitting your sensor to shoot wide open"

I understand that sounds harsh, but I have no other way to say it.   It seems like you believe that there is a set way that lighting works and you should keep your settings the same way for each scenario. Just because you are using natural light, doesn't mean that it won't be too bright at a wide aperture. Your histogram is showing normal when you stop down, but clipping the highlights when you open wide. That simply means its too bright and you can not shoot that wide open with the current camera settings.   The great thing about the FS700 is it has built in ND filters. If you want to shoot wide open when the scene is bright, you will need those ND filters. According to the pictures you've posted, it seems that you need 4 stops of ND in order to get a wide aperture that you want.   Once again, I don't mean to be harsh with my words. I am simply going off this reply that you've given, which seems to indicate a disconnect in your thinking vs the way light works."

After all this is my first time working on something.  What seemed to be the problem for me is that I never used ND filter when shooting inside and not against the window/outside. Outside? Sure! What happened during today's shooting was that sometimes the lens rattled and the picture went way too bright, so large aperture. Then I restarted the camera and changing aperture didn't work and the only thing that changed was the numbe ron the LCD screen. So I still think there is something not correct with the camera too. But yeah, I have no complete understanding on filmography/lighting yet and will try to improve with each project. Thanks for all the tips and the help! :)"
cinematography,3atdko,sonofaresiii,2,Tue Jun 23 21:46:41 2015 UTC,"You just need to understand that light is ever-changing. No two scenarios are the same. Even if you are in the same room at the same time a day, light will change. A cloud could move in front of the sun and change the light. Even the objects in the room can affect how natural light falls on to the subject.   You need to stop thinking that every situation is the same. You keep referring to a time you shot before and saying that your setting are the same as that time. Well, light will change and you will have to change your setting. Light is a living thing and our job as cinematographers is to tame it. That's why so many Hollywood movies are filmed on a closed set with no natural light, among other things, the light is way more manageable when not using natural light.   There is a very small chance that this is a camera issue. Nothing that you have described had made me think that there is something wrong with the camera. The light is just changing. All your replies on this thread keep saying its a camera issue, when it's just a lighting issue.   Do some research on the Inverse Square law in terms of photographic lighting. Also watch YouTube videos that explain ND filters. There are so many resources to help you learn the basics."

Stories are about characters and emotions. So, you need to learn about lighting, composition, movement, etc. because those are the things which enable you to provide mood to a scene.  In my cinematography class, we used this book. We also had this one as a reference book. I haven't really read the second book much, but it's an often recommended book for learning cinematography. And the first book is just excellent. You must read it. Finally, this book is all about composition and using different types of shots (i.e. not technical stuff).  We also watched a few clips of Citizen Kane in class and discussed some revolutionary things introduced by that movie, like deep focus.  There are two sentences I have read about cinematography which I aspire for:  1) Every shot needs to suit your scene or story. For example, if a character is showing strong emotions, it would be normally be a mistake to use a wide shot. You would normally use a tighter (close-up) shot.  2) Every shot should look like a painting. i.e. as visually appealing as possible.  Lastly, you won't actually learn just by reading books and watching videos online. You actually have to go work on a set - work on the lighting or camera or grip, etc. When you are actually on the set, you realize that something which you thought might work is not possible. For example, you might wanted to get a nice wide shot of a room for establishing. But when you actually go to shoot, you find that the room is so small that you can't take a wide shot, unless you use an ultra-wide lens which would give too much distortion. Therefore, nothing replaces actually going out and practicing your theoretical knowledge in real life."

Search up local acting groups/schools in your area and ask them.  No matter what side of the camera, one of the most common questions is ""how do I start working?"".  You need an actor and a script, somewhere out there is an actor who needs a camera and a script, and a writer who needs a camera and an actor.  Work together, use eachother.  Look into getting a personal website.  I have a cheapnasty one at the moment, but it's online and that's a 100% improvement from telling people to look me up on facebook.  In a few months once I get the site looking like not such a shame to my ancestors I'm going to get a couple thousand business cards.  I found a local gym that was doing videos using a damned iPad, so I came in and offered to do it for free.  Even though my XA20 isn't going to win any awards, it is providing me with real world hands on experience while I learn.  A while back he contacted me about two friends who want to do a promo video, that is literally double the amount of people who potentially want to work with me and I've never even met them.  The gym brought in Rory Miller, a rather influential author and figure in self defense circles, and I made a video with him.  Not every day you get to meet a figurehead of an entire industry.  All because I was willing to do some videos for free.  One of the girls at the gym needed some help with her jeep, and some other guy and I helped her out.  Turns out he's in a band and they're interested in doing a music video.  Behold the glory of networking!"

Then his girlfriend who had paid for the video called (man I can't even get a girl to talk to me and other people get to get them to pay for their music videos) and I tattled on him. Then I had another big altercation with him, I dunno why but his girlfriend kept texting me ""I'm no longer affiliated with him or the video"" and two days later she would text ""What's going on with the video?"" I don't understand how people work. Not at all."
cinematography,3ajobr,MacintoshEddie,3,Sun Jun 21 04:40:55 2015 UTC,"So, you had an altercation with him because he only wanted you to add some FX to the video, but you wanted to do all the editing?  Exactly how did you ""tattle on him"" was he not supposed to be subcontracting the editing?  Also, props for the phrase, I don't think I've heard anyone say that since I was like fifteen.  Well...if the girlfriend was the one who was paying for the video the reason she kept texting you may have been because she may have been looking for updates on the video that she was paying for.  That's called having a client, it's a good thing.  Discretion is the better part of valour.  I've discussed things with prospective clients that I will never speak of without their express permission.  Unless something is vital to the completion of the job, let other people have things their way.  If someone brings you in to edit something, and you disagree with it, just edit it and hand it off.

One of the defining films of the French New Wave, it displays many of the characteristic traits of the movement. Written by Truffaut and Marcel Moussy, the film is about Antoine Doinel, a misunderstood adolescent in Paris who is thought by his parents and teachers to be a troublemaker. Filmed on location in Paris and Honfleur, it is the first in a series of five films in which Léaud plays the semi-autobiographical character.

cinematography,3akhdi,ilykdp,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:21:54 2015 UTC,"I found the reflective material of the lowel umbrellas to be too hard when casting light, so I bought some cheap white diffusion umbrellas from amazon.  The light is much softer and nice, but because the rest of the soft box isn't there to bounce all the light out of the diffusion direction, it casts spill everywhere and seems like a loss of intensity in the direction they point compared to a true soft box."
cinematography,3akhdi,claytakephotos,2,Sun Jun 21 20:06:38 2015 UTC,"Buy some cinefoil to wrap your barndoors. Then buy and skin an 18x24 gel frame.  It'll give you the ability to direct light how you want (  leak/feather/scrim it in specific spots) and generally just lets you shape the light better than a softbox. Unless you're doing something specific where you need softboxes,  I'd argue that foil and diffusion frames are both cheaper and more versatile."
cinematography,3akhdi,ilykdp,2,Sun Jun 21 17:54:34 2015 UTC,Will this provide a source soft enough for daytime interviews?
cinematography,3akhdi,claytakephotos,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:00:27 2015 UTC,"The problem with daytime interviews is that you already have to ctb the tungsten light to match daylight, which loses about 1/3 the intensity.  If you follow that with diffusion you are really diminishing the output of the light, and the sun is going to be too powerful to try and match unless you have an 18K Mole Richardson light.  I recently did an interview with the subject sitting in front of their office windows and they asked me to expose for the outside also.  I set up two omni's (550w) for the key light, put ctb gel on both, and put half or quarter grid diffusion cloth (very light) on just one of the lights.  The combination of one hard and one soft omni worked well, but the office became very hot and we had to frequently stop to blot off sweat and air out the office.  Someday LED lighting will be powerful enough to replace all these silly tungsten incandescent lights..."
cinematography,3akhdi,claytakephotos,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:14:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This is helpful. When I bought my kit off ebay, I picked up the daylight balanced gels for each of them."
cinematography,3akhdi,Sobie17,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:24:59 2015 UTC,"Yes it will. Also, soft is kind of a bad word for interpreting light. You're looking for the term diffuse as opposed to specular (although diffuse is really a subset of specularity, but I digress). The closer the diffusion panel is to the subject, the more diffuse the light will be, because the light source will be larger relative to the subject. The closer the diffusion panel is to the light source and further from the subject, the more specular it will be. It's a little more complex than that, because there's three moving parts, but it's a good starting point.  Get some 250, 216, and opal gels to start with, and you'll get an idea of how it all goes down. As far as power goes, you've just go to work with what you've got. You can always use gel filters for windows (ND3 for example) using the coke method.   No offense, /u/ilykdp but I'm pretty sure you're wrong in saying that this guy would need an 18k Mole Richardson (why Mole Richardson? Why 18k? Why not an Arri HMI?) to use for a talking head interview. To me that's nuts. Also, LED's are definitely already as powerful as Lowel Omni's. They just have really awful color spikes - although, for local stuff it's probably not something worth worrying about.  The only time you'd need that much power is if you're literally outdoors. But if you're outdoors, the sun is your best friend. Get an open shade area for your subject to stand in (or make one), then reflect light to your subject to make your key.  Lastly, /u/ArtAdamsDP has an awesome entry level lighting setup if you're looking to do talking head stuff here. Give that a read through."

The edits did work with your music but I think the motions you had your actress go though look a bit unnatural. She looks awkward in most cases and I think the head twirling could have been toned down a bit. Try using the head twirls as transition opportunities since they're so spread out and frequent. I liked the breaks from her dancing tonthe scenes of her walking and exploring, use more of these as they help pique the audiences interest, "" Where is she? Where is she going? And will whe lead us to somewhere amazing?"" My last advice is punch in a little closer to her dont show as much and let the viewer imagine a bit more. Also expose a little brighter as that would help fit the theme of your song and kind of give it that "" heavenly/godess"" vibe. All in all keep working at it!

First, location, having her behind a large glass wall with those thick pipes FEELS like a barrier, enclosed, and your going for a horizon view / open feeling. Her on the beach in front of expansive ocean feels like what you wanted.  Second, the girl's poses and movements are awkward and unnatural due to not having wind or someone holding a fan to help her hair flow in that ""free way"" that you clearly wanted.  I got it, you were going for a fashion spot/ Instagram/ freedom/ open air/ vibe. You're close. Just give more attention to your setup/pre-pro.

There's only one other filmmaker out there (director of Chronicle) who has openly admitted of having a mental disease."
cinematography,3agpyp,d_russ,4,Sat Jun 20 02:03:06 2015 UTC,"I have a few friends with bipolar disorder. I think that it's important to be open about it and even more important to share it in a neutral way. It seems as if you share your bipolarity as if it's a liability, which it should never be.   The most important thing is to have it under control. If you haven't seen a doctor about it already then you have to as soon as possible. Mood stabilizing drugs will allow you to be the real you and keep those wild neurotransmitters in check. They have to be taken continuously even if your mood is stable. If one drug doesn't feel right then you can try other drugs because it's important that the drug doesn't inhibit you.   Mood stabilizers are just one piece of a bigger puzzle. You should visit therapists regularly who can teach you methods on controlling those mood swings and staying productive and friendly, even through some difficult periods. The coping methods will allow you to prevent those fights you have with your clients and prevent you from losing jobs as well. There are many types of therapy and some just don't work. Don't just see any therapist; ask them about their approach to psychology and try to find a therapist whose philosophy resonates with you. Just like it's important to find the right mood stabilizer, it's important to find the right therapist.  Other things that can help are maintaining a healthy and consistent lifestyle that minimizes stress and prevents triggers for the mood swings. Sleep schedules are very important, which means going to sleep at the same time every night, sleeping the same amount every night, and allowing your body to wake up and go to sleep naturally without the aid of sleeping pills or caffeine. Additionally, drugs and alcohol only lead to stress so stay sober if at all possible. Eat healthy and prevent overeating by counting calories.   I'm not sure exactly how you are treating it but I hope I've shared at least one thing that can help. It is a very sensitive and challenging disorder to control but if you can really nitpick about every detail, you will be able to live a healthier and happier life, as well be a more successful cinematographer.   Again, be open about your bipolarity and be positive about it. The attitude with which you approach your disorder is definitive of whether or not there is going to be a stigma around it. It only becomes a liability when you present it as such."
cinematography,3agpyp,d_russ,-5,Sat Jun 20 02:39:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot. I would never diagnose myself as I find it sacrilegious, I've been to 7 different psychiatrists in the past 8 years and they've all given me five or six different pills. I don't have much money so I can't afford a therapist, their rates are outrageous. When I was a student they offered me free psychotherapy sessions but I'm fairly sure some girls whom I had been ""harassing"" (according to them) found a way to get me to confess so they can suspend me for ""disciplinary reasons"".  But yeah fuck it, I should be outright frank about my bipolarity and Codeine abuse. And the fact that I'm trying to slowly kill myself.

cinematography,3agpyp,d_russ,4,Sat Jun 20 03:06:22 2015 UTC,"You have to get on a mood stabilizer asap. You must take it consistently too. The Codeine abuse might be a coping method, but as far as coping methods go, that one seems pretty dangerous. Really seriously try to get off of it. If you're going to self medicate, use a drug that can provide a solution rather than more problems. Addictions can be quite challenging so if you can find a drug abuse program, many churches that run AA meetings also have drug abuse programs, then go to it asap.   You have tons of potential, the only thing holding you back are your bad habits. If you can get those under control then you'll be able to find more work, and consistent work. Even if you can't afford a therapist, look online for coping method advice or bipolar support groups.   Here's one that seems very active http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/  Here's another subreddit for drug abuse: http://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/  You can do something about it but you have to start now.

You won't do yourself any favors by assuming you know more than everyone 10 min after walking on set.

You need to get out there and meet people and not just for work. A career or a hobby are supplements to life, they enhance and better your life, but they should never fully encompass your life. You are a human before you are a cinematographer, so you have to make sure that you are taking care of the human inside of you before you take care of the cinematographer inside you.   My father is an architect and he has completely devoted his life to his work, but now that he's older and doesn't obsess over architecture, he's found himself somewhat lonely. I can tell that it's depressing for him, and while he has his wife, he doesn't really have anyone else to talk to. You don't want to end up like that. Friendship is an essential part of life that you don't want to miss out on.   You can hire models for now, but I'd recommend trying to get some jobs, even small jobs, to meet people and socialize with them. You don't need to show absolute humility or absolute stoicism.

Project to project, even talking about just narratives or just doc interviews, the lighting will need to be different.  There's Gordon Willis quote I'm quite fond of. There was an interview he gave to the craft truck where he was asked what his process for lighting a scene was. The interviewer asks him about his method of over-head soft lighting. Willis replies, ""Ah, you're looking for a formula. Well there isn't one, the formula is me"".  What he meant was that, there isn't a standard method to achieve a look, a visual style, convey information or emotion. It's kind of just whatever works within the script, with the characters, with the situation. It's both an art and a science. The science is the means to an end, and the art is that end.  TLDR: Gripping on sets is my favorite way to learn about light :) It's not that you're trying to learn how to light, but you want to learn about light. You'd do better to learn about the nature of light, how it behaves and how it can effect perceptions, rather than to memorize everyone's process."

His work with Fincher was slick and beautiful, while not calling attention to itself but it was Elephant that really made me take notice.  I couldn't help but think the photography reminded me of William Eggleston and then I read that this wasn't an accident or coincidence.  2) Bojan Bazelli ...he was the first DP I started to recognize the signature style of across multiple filmmakers.  His look uses more artifice than naturalism but  I like to think of it as explicitly cinematic.  Some of my favorite films of his would be his work for Ferrara, like King of New York and Body Snatchers, then there's The Rapture and Deep Cover.  3) Dean Cundey (on John Carpenter films) ...I think he's a pretty invisible DP now.  When he shoots a Ron Howard film it looks like a Ron Howard film.  When he shoots a Spielberg film it looks like a Spielberg film.  What I liked was when he shot a John Carpenter film.  JC's worked with one good DP since Cundey, Donald Morgan on Christine and Starman, but Cundey's work was the first time I ever thought about how and why some films just looked better than others.  He was the first to put the love of anamorphic in me."

cinematography,3a9gp0,clank1401,2,Thu Jun 18 16:11:49 2015 UTC,Its a a super 35mm sensor which is the standard in motion pictures. In DSLR terms its the same as APSC so I believe it will be the same as your c300.
cinematography,3a9gp0,2old2care,2,Thu Jun 18 16:27:10 2015 UTC,"I have my GH4 since they were first available and I highly recommend it. All the 4K settings are 100 Mbps. 200 Mbps is available only at 1920 x 1080. I use Class 10 cards for 4K and 100 Mbps and they work fine. Frankly, I can't see any difference in 1920 x 1080 shot at 100 or 200 Mbps, but maybe there is some.   I have not tried to shoot 200 Mbps on the Class 10 cards, so I don't know if they will work or not. I also have not tried 128 GB cards. Panasonic says a max of 64 GB cards, but I have read where others have used Class 10 cards at 200 Mbps and have use the larger cards, too.   EDIT: Wanted to add that if you haven't shot 4K before it will change your life. The ability to crop and re-size and do zooms in post is amazing. On my GH4 I can shoot almost everything with my Lumix/Leica 25mm f/1.4 lens, so soft bacgrounds are easy. 50mm f/1.4 Nikkor also looks great."

cinematography,3a4b01,Afarby,2,Wed Jun 17 03:03:27 2015 UTC,"There's a lot that works for this film, and a lot that doesn't. A lot of it has to do with the script and the acting...but I'm only going to comment on the cinematography.  Framing and Composition: Great work here, frames were well composed and served the narrative very well. The blocking was pretty good too. Loved the shot of the kid getting the hammer, the movement felt effortless, and didn't call too much attention to itself. I like the way the conversation leading up to the murder between the woman and the victim was blocked and framed. Very nicely done, for the most part. There was one OTS shot of the woman that had a little too much headroom, when cut against a shot of the victim. Not that it's right or wrong, it just felt discontinuitous with it's reverse. (Woman: Lots of head room. Victim: No head room).   The fight could have been choreographed and shot better. I wasn't buying any of the blows. Action is hard, you've got to hide the fact that no one is being hit, without making it look like you're hiding it. I think it would have been better had you and the director chosen better places to put your camera.  Light: The lighting was very hit and miss. I loved the way the baseball bat guy entered the house, the way he was silhouetted, shadow patterns cast on the wall behind him. I think the close-up's were lit pretty well. Wides are tough, but you didn't do a bad job with them. They could have been better. Over all I think this film could have used a little bit larger contrast ratios. It's a dark subject, and I think maybe the visuals should reflect that. The shadows that you used were great, there just could have been more of them.  Color Grading: This was easily the weakest part of your work here. The blacks looked milky, with nothing in the narrative motivating that style. I could see a lot of your power windows quite prominently. There's a moment when the woman passes in front of a blown out practical, and you can see the outline of the practical lamp on her torso as she passes it. Dead giveaway! To a non-film person, it takes them out of the moment, trying to figure out what it was they just saw. There were also some moments in close-ups where I saw the lines of power windows cutting faces in half, attempting to follow the contours of the light playing on characters faces.  The color itself was kind of an off, pinkish hue for many light sources. Highlights and mids had a yellow, sometimes pink hue to them, while shadows looked like they had a lot of blue in them. To me, personally, the color looked absolutely hideous. To you it may be beautiful, but do get more eyeballs on it! If there is a particular colored lighting effect that you are going for, it's typically a better idea to get it right in-camera. With Log it can be tough, but that's why most cameras can view rec709 and record log at the same time, so that those color nuances are more apparent on set. I'm not saying you should bake in your image, because that's a bad idea. But your should always try and give your colorist a jumping off point. Get the ratios between colors right, e.g., if you want a backlight to be yellow, make it yellow on set! If you want your key to have a slightly warmer feel, add some CTO or minus green to your lights. But don't assume you can just get your shadows right and power window everything else, it seldom works.  In other words, the footage you've shot should take you 75% of the way there, and then let Davinci resolve and your colorist take you the other 25%.  Calibrating your grading monitor is also a good idea. Note that most apple monitors have a lot more contrast and saturation than other monitors, particularly that of calibrated plasmas. Use your scopes!"

These moments were partly fashioned by the HS50, an older-generation lens customized by Panavision optical engineer Dan Sasaki. Fraser explains, “We asked Dan to shift some of the lens elements to help throw the background crazily out of focus, with a slight doubling of the out-of-focus elements. He made the bokeh even more elongated than it usually is; the falloff was fantastic, and we also got a great flare at the bottom of frame. It was a very interesting and exciting effect.” This optical magic is particularly noticeable toward the end of the film, in a shot of Jackie walking at night with fireworks going off in the background."

cinematography,39ud4d,howdareyou,2,Sun Jun 14 21:44:31 2015 UTC,"Why doesn't dimming them work?   You're essentially trying to light your scene at a brightness that is equal to the lights the MIDI controller outputs. That's not going to be much light at all.   What I would do is set up the scene with no light, complete darkness aside from the controller itself. Set your ISO and aperture for the lights from the pads. Then bring up one of your lights with the dimmer to fill in the scene. Avoid top lighting the controller too much and maybe just give it an edge light.   This is going to test your camera's low light performance for sure."
cinematography,39ud4d,Dli151,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:54:31 2015 UTC,First expose for the pads. The room should be very underexposed. Now turn on your lights. Adjust their output until the room is lit how you want. You can move the light source farther away or bounce/diffuse it if it's still too bright.   These aren't cinematography questions.

Alternatively you dim them (depending on the lamp type), or even bounce them off of bounce boards, reflectors, or walls.  For what you want to do, I'd suggest just flagging off the light from the pad itself. That way, the lights on the pad show up, yet maybe your subject is lit?  TLDR: All you're trying to do is get the light ratio between the pad lights and the ambient light to either equalize, or even get the pad lights brighter than their surroundings.   If it were me, I'd ask the company if they can rig a special model with brighter than normal lights, and actually try and use them as the primary source of illumination. If not, maybe try and fake it with colored, soft lights off screen that play on the artist's face as they play. Either way, you've got a fun gig on your hands!"
cinematography,39tqbu,desertstage,10,Sun Jun 14 18:08:56 2015 UTC,It's created by using a very bright backlight and overexposing it.  Bob Richardson does this in nearly all his movies.
cinematography,39tqbu,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:16:20 2015 UTC,"Can you explain how I can overexpose a shot proportionally? Like, what should the histogram look like?"
cinematography,39tqbu,Ok_Lumberjack,5,Sun Jun 14 18:32:47 2015 UTC,"You can't really look at a histogram for that kind of information. Take a look at the first scene in the video. The basic idea is that the light on their faces is properly exposed, or even a tad underexposed. To get the proper exposure you can use a light meter or your camera's built-in light meter then change your aperture or lights to match. The bright backlight has to be brighter for example 3 stops brighter or 3 times brighter than the light on their faces. You could check how many stops brighter it is with a light meter or you can just estimate with your eyes. The amount of control you have over getting the effect perfect depends on your lights, your light meter, and your time but if you just make sure the backlight is significantly brighter than the fill on their faces, you will get similar effect."
cinematography,39tqbu,gaber-rager,5,Sun Jun 14 19:34:34 2015 UTC,"Isn't every stop twice as bright as the last? So 3 stops would actually be 8 times brighter, right? Semantics..."
cinematography,39tqbu,PJB6789,5,Mon Jun 15 00:58:27 2015 UTC,Haha you're right. That's actually a pretty important distinction so good call.
cinematography,39tqbu,gaber-rager,0,Mon Jun 15 01:12:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot. I have to learn to how to read meters... I don't know why I've slack off so much, trivializing on gear when I should focus on the Light Triangle. It's the key, don't you agree?"
cinematography,39tqbu,Ok_Lumberjack,2,Sun Jun 14 20:15:08 2015 UTC,"You mean the Exposure triangle: Aperture, ISO, Shutter? I guess it helps but I feel a lot also has to do with understanding not just the camera but how light behaves and moves. How it flows over faces or projects against walls. You can't learn very much of that in school; it's more from experience than anything else. Although of course, none of that means anything without understanding exposure so yes, it certainly is a good starting point, but believe me when I say it only gets more complicated from there."
cinematography,39tqbu,gaber-rager,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:59:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah sorry my mother tongue is not English, sometimes stuff get lost in the translation."
cinematography,39tqbu,Ok_Lumberjack,2,Mon Jun 15 06:40:14 2015 UTC,"A histogram doesn't tell you about much that's in the scene. It just tells you whether you're capturing all the dynamic range in a scene. It's very difficult to get any information about what's happening to any one thing in the shot.  Basically you'd light it, expose it the way you want to, and then add backlights that look bright to the eye and on your monitor. When Richardson did it (on film) he put in a soft ambient glow that appears to be coming from the bar (probably lights bounced into a very large muslin rag) and used that as his key, and then added hot back or scratch lights that were a couple of stops overexposed.  The backlights have to move around when your frame changes. They look great as backlights, not so good as front lights.  In the second wide shot you can see the lights he's using. They look like par cans, but they could be anything that projects a beam (like a fresnel). In this case, you see small par cans in places like that as accent lights so it makes sense that they'd look okay if they ended up in the shot.  This is what I call ""intentional lighting."" You make a decision that this is the look you're going for and you light and expose accordingly. It's not something you can find on a histogram. You can do it by meter or do it by eye. (A waveform monitor would be more helpful as you can relate the brightness levels to things that are in the shot, which a histogram can't do.)"
cinematography,39tqbu,ArtAdamsDP,-2,Sun Jun 14 19:53:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Now I have another question... how do you properly move a light? They tend to be sensitive, they've blown in my face when I've tried to boom them. How do they pan/dolly lights? Is it even achievable with a normal light stand?"
cinematography,39tqbu,Ok_Lumberjack,4,Sun Jun 14 20:18:35 2015 UTC,"Well... you stop filming, you turn off the light, you move it to the new spot, turn it on, aim it, check the exposure, shoot.  You don't want to pick up and move tungsten lights when they're on. Sometimes the filament blows.  You can pan/dolly lights during the shot, but that's not what happened here. They shot the entire scene from one direction, stopped, moved the camera, moved some lights, and then shot it from another direction."
cinematography,39tqbu,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:22:42 2015 UTC,"You can certainly move tungsten lights when they are on. Just try not to bang them on things, and bigger units like 5k's have larger globes that break easier (and are expensive). But you can sling around a par can or a source 4 all day. A tungsten globe typically won't cool enough in less than 3 minutes to make much of a difference if you turn them on or off."
cinematography,39tqbu,JohnHafner,3,Thu Jun 18 06:12:27 2015 UTC,"Art's comment is great!  I'll add that if you're using HMI's, there a little different. You have to let the gas inside the globe cool a few minutes after turning them off before you can turn them back on again, otherwise they might explode. Then once you turn them back on, you have to let the gas warm back up again for at least 4-5 minutes so that the color temperature and intensity stays consistent. I see and hear of people misusing HMI's sometimes, that's the only reason I comment :)  You can pan and tilt lights...since that's what you have to do to focus them! Just be careful, if they blow the second you touch them, chances are the rental company, or whoever sold them to you ripped you off...they aren't supposed to do that. I mean if you're only moving less than 6ft and have multiple hands on it....most lights, including HMI's should be fine even if left on. Not ideal, but on a time crunch it's sometimes necessary.  To pan, (hopefully you are using combo-stands, AKA american stands, AKA combo risers), just loosen the knob on the riser closest to your hand, push up on the riser to support the weight of the light, and pan gently, then tighten in place. To tilt, you usually loosen a knob on the head (the fixture itself).  I have heard of people dollying lights for special effects. Friend of mine worked a gig recently that placed either a 1.2 Arrisun HMI, or an M18, on a camera dolly to fake a train light shining through the woods at night. So it's possible, but you should have some rad grips and sparks on hand!"

cinematography,39tqbu,Ok_Lumberjack,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:39:32 2015 UTC,"Most all Modern HMI units are fine to restrike right away without any issue. It's probably more wear and tear but no one wants to wait on set. Time is money...  If you have to do it put it on NON-flicker free mode and lowest power setting, it will be easier on the unit.  Ask the vendor if he has any special notes on HMI striking though.  Some older units can be quite finicky and need to cool down fully or they won't strike.  Whatever you don't strike the unit more than twice per 60 seconds!  I've seen HMIs start smoking after 5 restrikes in 30 seconds.  It wasn't pretty, all black inside, ruined the globe."

He focused on medium shots for the entire movie.  He shot on the sony f65 since he felt the other cameras didn't look the way he wanted it to feel.  He focused his selection to vintage primes.

I wonder if that was a conscious choice, or if they were just taking advantage of the extra space in some cases rather than cramming the camera crew and actors into a smaller space.  I realize now that is probably what really made me suspect they were all robots, that they were all being tested.  Also, the VFX on AVA were extremely well done.

cinematography,39q8sp,LeTouche,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:31:57 2015 UTC,"This is to do with the film chain and how TV content was distributed to stations.  Often it was on 35mm dupes derived from the final print or master tape, which involves generational loss. Then the station took them and either played them out or ingested them to tape using pretty cheap telecine equipment.  You could finish a TV episode or movie with the same colour timing as a feature, nice and contrasty, but then you'd lose detail in the (cheaply struck) dupes for distribution and even more on the station's crappy TK, so end result would be mushy muddy crap."

cinematography,39q8sp,Ok_Lumberjack,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:23:11 2015 UTC,"A telecine scan from a film negative retains a ton of detail and was common in commercials way before it became common in television. Television producers were worried that the negative might be damaged in the telecine (even though telecines were sprocketless by that time) so they had the negative printed and then scanned.  The print reduced contrast considerably, even if it was a low contrast print, throwing away detail in shadows and highlights. DPs compensated by lighting with much less contrast. They were also shooting for the worst TV sets in the world, which were pretty bad at the time. Also, telecines weren't very good at retaining highlight detail back then as they followed the Rec 709 standard pretty closely, and that only allowed for about 2.4 stops of overexposure headroom.  Over time, as sets became better and some TV shows pushed the production quality bar higher, series started transferring from color negative and going for more sophisticated looks.  I worked on what was probably the last TV series to transfer from a print (Shades of LA). The DP lit with lots of hard light, and there were shadows everywhere. In the final transfer nearly all those shadows washed away. It was interesting to see.  I worked on a TV movie where, instead of transferring from the negative or a print, they transferred from an internegative. An internegative has, like nearly all negative stocks, an orange base, and by correcting for the orange in the mid-tones all the highlights went blue. The DP was pissed..."

The cameras are such a tiny part of what makes a film's image, that it doesn't really matter what you use. So long as it works with your environment, production schedule, budget, and your on-set workflow and aesthetic, you can shoot on whatever the hell you want and can still tell a great story. Depending on how you use it. How you use a camera, everything you put in front of and behind it, are what make for great imagery. Not tech specs or model numbers. No amount of K's will save bad filmmaking. Watch some 48 hour film contest entries if you don't believe me (many shot on high end cameras).  How is Natalie Portman's film looking so good? She got a great DP. She got a great production designer, great talent, and equally as important: a good story.   Side note/unrelated: Notice I say equally, not more or less important. You might have cooked up a wonderful narrative on paper, but if you can't translate that to a visual, emotion-based medium, then it means nothing in my opinion."
cinematography,39htxg,sonofaresiii,3,Fri Jun 12 05:24:28 2015 UTC,"So long as it works with your environment, production schedule, budget, and your on-set workflow and aesthetic   You kind of glossed over this part as if it wasn't important. Sure, if the entire movie is shot on a set with complete lighting control, no movement and infinite time I can use whatever camera I want and it'll all look the same.  But that's a boring movie.  E: and no production requirements like needing a group of people to, yknow, see what I'm shooting. And other things I'm forgetting, I'm sure.

It is as we progress in the art, start to use the shadows and highlights to tell the story that we start to really use the extra range.  If your footage looks the same on both a bmpcc and a red, use the bmpcc, your art won't use the extra capabilities of the red."

There are certain tropes and common visual cues used in film to illicit a response from audience members. Like using negative space and a deep, dark back ground in a horror scene to make people think there's someone lurking behind a character. Or the use of high and low angles to convey power/ narrative agency, close to far  perspective illicit sympathy/antipathy, etc.  But by and large, you can set up your own set of visual operating rules to convey different feelings and ideas. Great example is No Country for Old Men. A missing lock on a closed door means that Anton Sugur has recently visited (and probably killed someone). Or the color orange in The Godfather foreshadowing death.  TLDR: Books can tell you a lot about how other people reach audiences with visuals, which you can use yourself to great effect. But they often only work for the specific narrative that they're used with, like in Every Frame a Painting. You can't copy other people and expect to do great things. You can do good work, but you can do a whole lot better if you can invent your own tricks :)"

That means you would light it using the light you expect to use predominantly on location. This is generally tungsten or daylight (HMI). Anything else is going to skew your color results... which is fine if that's the color light you're going to be using.   The results are only accurate for the color of light hitting the chart.

cinematography,39j55i,filmnuts,2,Fri Jun 12 04:58:26 2015 UTC,"Well, you don't need to go to college to become a good cinematographer. I think it can definitely help, but no one in the industry is going to judge your ability based on your college degree. Most people in film didn't go to film school.  So your salt is worth as much as everyone and anyone here friend :)  Hey, Please read this part, it's important for your safety!!!!  Your lighting is a tad over-kill. ""800W Light"" usually means a Joker-Bug HMI. HMI stands for Hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide lamp. In English, that means ""a big, hot-ass bright light that can start fires and injure people if misused"".  Basically, HMI lights burn hotter, and more efficiently than the tungsten-quartz lights you're probably used to. So an 800W HMI outputs light that's roughly 4X as bright as a tungsten 1K (1000W) light. So 4 1K tungesten lights = 1 800W HMI. This is important, because HMI's are very hot, and can burn you worse than your tungsten fixtures can. They also require use of a ballast, and can't be plugged in to certain home circuits since they draw lots of power. Same goes for your tungsten lights. You can run HMI's on household circuits, but carefully. They can also do fun things like give you sunburns if you stand under them too long, and screw up your eyes if you turn one one while looking at it (hence why we yell STRIKING!). You also can't turn them off and on a bunch of times in a row like you can a tungsten light...because the globe can explode and rain shards of molten glass down on you and your talent. That's the big safety warning.   TLDR: Just give the 800 Joker about 5 minutes to warm up before turning it off, and 5 minutes to cool back down before turning it on again.  If you want to know more about power saftey, I can comment more. I don't mean to treat you like a baby here if you already know this stuff, but I want to make sure you stay safe!  Camera stuff:  I'd suggest cutting down your cameras to only two. Maybe the c100 and BMC, depending on if you need to shoot descreetly or not. Unless your don't have the budget, or you need to shoot without being noticed, there's really no reason to shoot on any of the dslr's you mentioned.  C100 is a great doc cam, good for exposing to the elements (Light rain, heat, etc). Solid choice if you need to do your audio in-camera, and you need the camera to ""just work"".  But the BMC is a great interview/b-roll cam. Has fantastic color, robust image data for grading in post (even shooting pro-res). With a power solution, it can also shoot all damned day in an interview, non-stop and reliably with up to date firmware. You can buy/ rent big solid-state drives for it."
cinematography,39j55i,jonathan_92,2,Fri Jun 12 06:10:32 2015 UTC,"Oh hi! :)  Let me point out a few things:   Most people in film didn't go to film school.   Maybe that's true for ""most people in film"", if you count all employees in all trades, but I'd say that the vast majority of actual cinematographers (i. e. DPs of commercially produced films, particularly narrative, that get actual distribution) did indeed go to film school.   ""800W Light"" usually means a Joker-Bug HMI.   While there are some 800W HMIs available these days, ""800W"" most commonly refers to an open-face tungsten fixture - Ianiro (redheads) and Arrilite would be common examples (in Europe). They've been around for decades.   Basically, HMI lights burn hotter, and more efficiently than the tungsten-quartz lights you're probably used to.   The fixtures do not generally get a lot hotter than tungsten fixtures; but they often take longer to cool due to their often sturdier build. If there's one thing ""basically"" setting apart HMIs from tungsten fixtures, it's color temperature (HMIs are daylight).   So an 800W HMI outputs light that's roughly 4X as bright as a tungsten 1K (1000W) light. So 4 1K tungesten lights = 1 800W HMI.   This works out as a rule of thumb for older fixtures, but it can vary greatly, depending on what kind of fixtures you're comparing (say, open-faced vs. fresnel vs. standard PAR (which lens?) vs. Arri M-series reflectors).   This is important, because HMI's are very hot, and can burn you worse than your tungsten fixtures can.   See above.   They also require use of a ballast, and can't be plugged in to certain home circuits since they draw lots of power.   Yeah they obviously can't be plugged into circuits if they draw more than said circuits provide, but the same is true for tungsten.    Same goes for your tungsten lights.   See what I mean? :)   You can run HMI's on household circuits, but carefully.   With the same amount of care as you would apply when running a comparable tungsten fixture. No need to scare people away from HMI. :)   They can also do fun things like give you sunburns if you stand under them too long   Properly maintained HMIs do not give you sunburns, since they have a UV filter in the front glass element for this exact reason.   and screw up your eyes if you turn one one while looking at it (hence why we yell STRIKING!).   Common sense for all bright light sources, I guess.   You also can't turn them off and on a bunch of times in a row like you can a tungsten light...because the globe can explode and rain shards of molten glass down on you and your talent. That's the big safety warning.   Turning them on and off whithout letting them cool inbetween does not really cause them to burst, it just lowers the bulb's life expectancy (starting with introducing color shifts). I've seen tungsten bulbs (mostly smaller ones) explode in a rain of shards many times (sometimes due to light shaking, sometimes for no obvious reason at all), but very few HMI bulbs. So it happens, but not particularly often."

cinematography,39j55i,jonathan_92,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:46:54 2015 UTC,"Hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide lamp:       Hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide, or HMI, is the brand name of Osram brand for a metal-halide gas discharge medium arc-length lamp manufactured for film and entertainment applications. Hydrargyrum is Latin for mercury (Hg).  An HMI lamp uses mercury vapour mixed with metal halides in a quartz-glass envelope, with two tungsten electrodes of medium arc separation. Unlike traditional lighting units using incandescent light bulbs, HMIs need electrical ballasts, which are separated from the head via a header cable, to limit current and supply the proper voltage. The lamp operates by creating an electrical arc between two electrodes within the bulb that excites the pressurized mercury vapour and metal halides, and provides very high light output with greater efficacy than incandescent lighting units. The efficiency advantage is near fourfold, with approximately 85–108 lumens per watt of electricity. Unlike tungsten-halogen lamps where the halide gas is used to regenerate the filament and keep the evaporated tungsten from darkening the glass, the mercury vapour and the metal halides in HMI lamps are what emit the light. The high CRI and color temperature are due to the specific lamp chemistries.

This is why I come here for, the help you can never get in any other forums, despite a lot of people harassing me for no reason (oh, the reason is obvious, my nationality).  Things are a tad different in my country. People don't trust a jump-starter without any sort of degrees. It's de facto compensation for overwhelming demand in the market, our moving pictures industry is sizable but there are just too many people out there who want to be actors and such, there's not enough room for any of them. If you go to college, and at least get an AA (I plan to get a BA too, in VFX), then people have no choice but to put you ahead of anyone with better talent and experience than you. It's completely different from the US.  As for the light, it's not HMI. We don't have them here. They probably will give him ordinary tungsten/halogen lights, brand is produced in my country and they come with a safety net. I own a couple and if the light blows, it's nothing to be scared of, it's just a flare. I know it's still an overkill but I'll probably give a couple of them back.

I'm lucky the the clip should only occupy roughly 30 Seconds. So I'm thinking of doing one wide shot from behind the presenter showing the audience. Get a couple reaction shots of the audience and then one kind of punching in on the speaker. The one thing that works to my benefit is that it is supposed to look ""dim"" because of it being in a theater. The one shot of the speaker I might shoot one of the LED's flat on as the light from the pojector should be on him and try to flag off the sides of the room to keep it darker. The audience shots I'm thinking of putting the LED panels where the projector should be shining from to get a really strong back light and then try and bounce some of the light for fill. The wide shots however I am not sure yet and it's definetely causing a little persperation haha."

I like the idea of placing the lighting where the projector is though.   There has to be a way to mimic projector lighting on their faces. The close/medium close ups will be easy enough, the wide is the issue. Idek if a bounce will be strong enough. Then again the dim factor to it all could ppay to your advantage.   Another shot idea is to get a line shot down the audience sitting, while panning to the side toward the presenter.

Now as others have noted they have cranked up the everything on it. Also for some reason I only saw up to 480p as an option in viewing, so the observations could change in a big way.  The [bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep] codec again. I know xavc saves a lot of storage space, but those encoding errors simply cannot be ignored against modern codecs. Look at the breathing on the frog, that is a smooth process, with smooth curves, not a [bleep] crease on frog skin. They have managed to tune the codec to now start finding edges that aren't even there.  H.264 was brilliant forever ago, today it might as well be from the dark ages.  The door opening to reveal the trees. Yeah, those look a lot more like some crazy mass of squiggles than they do leaves. More codec errors.  The color itself is so over saturated that this could be completely off. The frog in particular, they pushed the color so hard that there is very little gradient to the color. I expect that turning the stupid saturation to as close to off as possible will fix a lot of this.  In the encoding I see an enormous amount of what I will call crosshatch errors, but this could be this particular encoding and not from camera.  The night scene as well is absolutely destroyed by saturation. This should be showing off dynamic range, not showing off how puketastic your saturation can be.  What moron set sharpening to yes gimme gimme? By doing that they have destroyed the image to the point where we can't even tell what the original quality was. Look at the kettle? Whatever that black smudge shaped vaguely like a kettle is at 1:00. Either sharpen and saturation wrecked the image or the everything sucks. I'm leaning towards puketastic sharpen and saturation.  So what can actually be learned from this video? Xavc doesn't just suck, we can now say that it chews. Sharpen and saturation destroy images. And someone used a camera of some kind for this."

cinematography,39bnnp,_Shush,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:13:32 2015 UTC,"The A7S can go that high, but 204k and 409k are really unuseable because of noise.

cinematography,39bnnp,adaminc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:30:14 2015 UTC,"True, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad in low light. There have also been hints that the camera might be very good in low light judging by the test videos Sony has released. Maybe not A7S good, but still better then your average camera.   This is a leaked photo of the A7rII shot in 25600 ISO and 12800 ISO. While we can tell the background is noisy, it still manages to maintain detail. There are a lot of factors that come into play such as the fact the file is so small and has good lighting, but it still shows it can operate in that setting.   With that said, I'm pretty sure most people aren't going to go past 3200 ISO anyway. Once the novelty wears off, it's better to focus more on your lighting then seeing what you can get away with (even in run and gun). It's a good feature on the A7S to get usable shots at 12800 and adding some denoiser, but It's not essential to me at least."
cinematography,39bnnp,_Shush,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:55:00 2015 UTC,"No.  A big part of what makes the A7S capable of doing that is a lower megapixel sensor.  It's got a full frame sensor that is only ~12mp.  That means much larger photo sites, and without those no amount of image processing is going to give you that crazy level of low light.  This camera will be an incredible still photographer's camera, but it's not the video built version.  Video is a secondary feature on the A7R lines."

cinematography,39bnnp,dinosawrsareawesome,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:35:21 2015 UTC,"I don't buy it.  Other cameras have used this technique.  I've still never seen low light anywhere near the A7S from a higher resolution sensor.  If Sony really pulled it off it's a groundbreaking step.  Their cameras would be a generation of improving rolling shutter/image processing away from being a real challenge to higher end cameras in a small package.  It would be the holy grail of a cheap camera that can pretty much do everything.    Which is exactly why I don't buy it.  Sony may be ahead of the curve on low light image processing and be able to apply that to this sensor type, but it's too good to be true that it'll have the lowlight of the A7S."

cinematography,399dy5,enhues,2,Wed Jun 10 14:29:58 2015 UTC,"Unbelievable shots. I know the actual filmmakers aren't here, but I have two critiques: -Most of the shots seemed over-sharpened. Look at the texture in the rocks/ruins/buildings. Does not look natural. -Shutter speed was reeally high. There's not much you can do to fix this in-camera with a GoPro without rigging some crazy ND system, but plugins like ReelSmart Motion Blur can help you add back some nice motion blur in post and get rid of that choppiness. I know the high SS look is popular, but at a certain point it stops looking good."

Granted, I took it upon myself to learn as much as I could, but still.   I remember thinking I had a pretty good handle on this cinematography thing when I joined cml, and saw people talking about gammas and luts and rec709 and just thought ""what in the HELL are these people talking about? No one told me about this!"" (the more you know, the more you realize how little you know)  The only time these types of posts become an issue for me is when the poster refuses any real, professional advice and is adamant that their way will work.

cinematography,39f00x,sonofaresiii,4,Thu Jun 11 17:52:12 2015 UTC,"I agree, but what I'm finding is that the bar here is SO low that it's becoming pointless for me to contribute.  I love teaching, but back when I started out (yes, we're talking in the film days) you had to learn a little something before you started shooting or your footage wouldn't turn out and you'd waste a bunch of money. Now there are more people shooting than ever but they've not done much to educate themselves. It's scary how much knowledge is being lost--not just about the craft, but about the process.  That's not to say I know everything, nor did I know much when I started out, but I knew I had to learn and I put myself in those situations. It seems all that's required now is to have enough money to buy a camera.  I'm horrified to read questions about the relationship between f/stops, ISO and shutter speeds, for example. This is in the first ten pages of just about any photography book.  I guess that's where I'll make my stand: if you can learn this stuff just by reading a basic introductory book or two, I don't need to respond. If it's a question that shows that you've done some homework and what you're asking can't easily be found in a book, I'm happy to help.  That's the nice thing about CML: there's a place for beginners to ask questions, and those that want to answer them can. /r/cinematography isn't really about cinematography so much as it is helping someone who just bought a camera figure out how it works. Cinematography is so much more than that."

In fact it looks like that whole background is their diffusion, and they're shining lights directly through it. not saying your light set up won't achieve this look, i just thought i'd try to breakdown what they did just for your benefit and mine, even though you didn't ask for it.  edit: also haze, which diffuses the light a smidge too."

The retro thing you're seeing is all the other things that go into it, the colors chosen, the set design, the cars, the outfits - it's all there selling the 90s (because it is the 90s). The washed out look might be from filtration, a haze or promist kinda deal.   Shoot film log on the bm, bring a still of this scene into davinci beside a shot you used thats similar - maybe a car and a dude in daylight. Match the scopes, play around with them and see what you can get. This has a slightly washed out feel, so don't crush your blacks too harshly.

cinematography,394ftr,forkoverthegoods,5,Tue Jun 9 18:20:57 2015 UTC,Shoot on a smoggy day or use a lot of bounce and  diffusion. The shape of the light hitting their faces isn't something you can adjust in post.

cinematography,394ftr,arheff,2,Tue Jun 9 17:34:07 2015 UTC,"The first half of this clip is on an overcast day, but after 1:10 we get a few shots that were done on a late afternoon with clearer skies probably due to time constraints. The quality of the light is warmer and when mixed in with shots from the overcast day, they stick out to me.  Diffusion on the lens can definitely help with the softness of this look as well as lots of bouncing to fill in the shadows.  Here's a brief analysis on the lighting in one of the shots: https://i.imgur.com/gfwlBQE.jpg  Edit: I think the most important aspect of a lot of this is the smog. The shot at 1:25 would not look nearly as dynamic without the depth created by the smog. The colors desaturate in the distance and it looks wonderful."
cinematography,394ftr,LochnessDigital,5,Wed Jun 10 05:01:41 2015 UTC,"So in film log you have a good start.   On set I would suggest heavy diffusion overhead to knock down a lot of the directional sunlight or shoot on an overcast day. Lot of the front porch stuff looks like they added some really directional light off camera left (probably an HMI through some soft diffusion).   If you are shooting darker skinned actors, you can do wonders with a lot of white sheets on the floor bouncing light back up from the floor onto their faces.   Some of the shots, like when Cuba is shouting looks like they used the sun as a back light and used a large white surface, either a 12x12 ultra bounce or something, to fill in his face.   If you are on a budget, I would suggest lots of large bouncing material to utilize the sun as your source without having to rely on extra lights. But if it's an overcast sky you might want to use and HMI or daylight led to add that simulated sun backlight.   In post, you will want to bring down the shadows just enough to get good contrast but you might want to pull up the toe end of your shadows a little to give that muted black look. Adjust your highlights to keep them from becoming too blown out, especially when you have really contrasting objects (like a black actor with a white shirt on)   In a pinch, there are some LUTs out there that emulate film stocks. Then it's a matter of blending your nodes in resolve to get the look you are going for.   Again production design, time of day, and even the lenses you use can help to achieve that 90s look"

cinematography,394ftr,jonathan_92,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:05:43 2015 UTC,"Not the camera, since cameras didn't matter that much in the days of film. The film stock mattered a whole lot more. Lighting/time of day, production design, and locations matter a whole lot more than that, and still do.  I'd suggest researching common film stocks used in the 90's, looking up some movies shot on them, then make a best guess as to what this one was shot on. There was a lot more variety in film back in the day. Today we only have Kodak vision 3, in it's various balances and sensitivities. Kodak used to make vision 2, vision, and many other stocks. There used to be entire other companies that made film, like fuji, with a variety of different stocks. Moreover, different batches of the same stock would actually look a littl different!  So today, it would definitly not be as simple as just shooting on film...film itself has completely changed.  Luckily, there's some great technical data out there on various film stocks. Kodak publishes all of their current stock's data. If you can figure out what stock was used, find it's technical data, then you might be able to ""re-construct"" a camera, exposure, lighting, and post-color process to bring back the look from the dead.  You can test your own camera for the same properties listed in these film stock spec sheets, and compare them. Figure out what you can do to your camera to make it match. Might be as simple as  finding the right lighting ratios and tweaking in resolve, or not.  As others have pointed out, it's a lot more than just the camera or post. Production design, costuming, lighting, lensing, even where they put the camera all play equally, if not more important factors in determining a look.  Anyways, hope this helped!"

If you can shoot on Red Epic/Dragon with all the above I think you would nail this look.

Servo-focus and zoom rings are awful, the colour lcd viewfinder is really bad at showing the right exposition, poor low-light performance, awful gain grain etc. etc.  I bought one spanking new when it came out with the project of using it as a broadcast camera for ENG-type television stuff (interviews at launch parties, red carpets, vox-pop on the streets, etc).

My thoughts are that these cheaper gimbals will really come of age next year or so and this years models will be much improved on. The technology is still quite new of course so I think in a year or two's time we there will be some great products to choose from.   Funnily enough, I just picked up the Roxant (under the brand name Afunto) yesterday in the hope my GH4 will work. Turns out it's a tad too heavy with the 12-35 but works quite well with my Hero4 Black. Ain't no Movi of course but it's pretty OK IMO. At 2.7K on the Gopro in 'medium' FOV (to allow for cropping, maybe a little stabilization and de-fishing) I feel it's an acceptable solution for the next year or so.

As a result, almost all of the reported bugs from their first and second generation cameras are totally gone. I mean it's shitty that they released them with bugs, but goddammit they are so easy to work with now, and it's easy to get the imagery that you want with them. They really are ""mini arri's"", black magic cameras in general.  The pocket does have a lot of flaws, mainly it's form factor, and it's susceptibility to overheating.

I want them to succeed, but it takes a few generations and better build quality to do it.

The sun is large but up in the sky (relative to you) it's small. So get that shower curtain foam core Frankenstein setup (called a ""Book Light"") nice and close to your subject if you want soft light. Changing the color of the bounce will change the color of the light. Want a blue light? Bounce the light off a blue t-shirt pinned to the poster board. Control unwanted spill via use of a negative fill, meaning put a big black piece of material on the opposite side of the subject so the book light isn't reflecting off whatever's next to them. Consider yourself a pro.  * So like:                      SUBJECT                       ___ CURTAIN               LIGHT<   / BOARD"
cinematography,38ofvl,Italianshox,2,Fri Jun 5 15:18:17 2015 UTC,"SOA ( Serenje Orphan Association) is a non-profit organisation. Every year the SOA committee has to fund 15,000 euros to the Serenje Orphan Home for the orphanage to keep running and have water, electricity, food and school equipment. In addition, the committee has to fund an extra 2,500 euros to pay for the schooling of children above the ages of 15 as the Zambian Curriculum requires a fee for each child whom is 15 or older.   This campaign is designed to raise money and create a documentary about the lives of these children. Children, whom, as you may not know, do not have any home to go to if the orphanage shuts down. The documentary wants to spread awareness to the public. Zambia is a very poor country, like many other Southern African Countries. However, to the contrary of most, Zambia has not received a lot of attention. In this video the committee is prepared to share the lives of these children, to show the public Zambia itself and to share how the world is viewed through the eyes of someone who has not experienced privileges, comforts and luxuries. A life of simplicity, honesty and humility.   So, in my opinion hating on this organisation is not appropriate. Its aims are to improve the lives of children and to spread awareness of what is going on in Zambia. However, many people are hating on what is meant to be a honest and giving gesture from the committee.   This just shows how out society has turned out to be.

Atypically professionals will have cameras available to use. I know the budget your asking for won't even begin to cover wages for your work, so I know you're not seeking monetary gain.

cinematography,38uzkv,blickblocks,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:58:24 2015 UTC,"I've pushed exposure to the brightest possible, it's clipping like mad. It's great in normal daylight, but still, there's the matter of why I actually bought this filter for, matting out the light flares, which it doesn't do."
cinematography,38uzkv,vegan_recipes,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:09:52 2015 UTC,"What kind of response curve/picture style/profile are you using? You obviously don't want to be clipping, what I'm talking about is using your upper dynamic range when possible as opposed to having your shadows deep down in the lowest levels of that range. This is known as ""exposing to the right"" (referencing a histogram).  ND filters don't matte out light flares, in fact adding additional glass only increasing issues with flare and internal reflection. If your ND isn't multicoated (most aren't AFAIK), you're guaranteed to have these issues to a greater degree than if you didn't use any filter at all. What it sounds like you might need is a matte box with some flags."
cinematography,38qsrb,Mrdean2013,2,Sat Jun 6 00:57:48 2015 UTC,"Not bad. The only two notes I would give are to:  1: Remember your rule of thirds, I know this is a day one film school reference, but its always good to remember it.  The film was cropped to 4:3, but that doesn't mean the rule still doesn't apply, in fact it applies even more. The frames will be infinitely more interesting if you balance your subject in either side of the frame and build out away from them. Some of your shots you did this well, in others it was lacking, or they were drifting towards the center of the frame. If you shot in 16:9, it may be a matter of recropping, but idk where the original frame marks were, so only you know how you shot it.  2: Move the fill light around. Fill light is in my opinion the defining element of a cinematographer. It can either accentuate the scene beautifully, or cause it to fall flat. Especially in black and white, you've got to get the fill light set up to look visually interesting. My favorite variation is called the 3/4 backlight, it is placed at a sharper angle behind the subject than a traditional fill light, but it is still off to the side enough to fill in certain features. This set up offers fill without flat. It creates highlights around the subjects natural lines without filling their entire face with an even light. This might seem like a disadvantage in theory, but it looks really good in camera. At the end of the day just play with it, you will find what you like.  Not sure if this is helpful at all."
cinematography,38qsrb,Maverick-220,0,Wed Jun 10 17:27:39 2015 UTC,"Great job! I really like the use of the low angle on the killer. Just a couple of tips I could give.    Make sure not to overuse the low angle. Sometimes in some shot-reverse-shot setups it felt unmotivated. Its often standard to put the camera level with the framed character's head. Or if you want to do low angle make it a bit more subtle.  You tend to give you characters too much head. It feels off, and you're just wasting space. I like the shaky-cam look, but it could definitely be polished. If you can't get your hands on a shoulder rig, try bracing your camera by putting a strap around you neck and pulling the camera forward.    Overall you should be very happy with this. Hope this helped."

Seems not.   To get the ball rolling, here's a great example of the thing I was looking for.  Recently, shooting a TVC for a beer brand, the ad agency were sitting around with nothing to do. They looked unhappy about some of the shots. So the Director got the agency art director involved in setting up all the art direction of the office that we were shooting in. Every single desk, ornament, photo, pc, keyboard was then arranged to the agency AD's satisfaction, big smiles all round, and the shoot proceeded with a happy agency.   By distracting the agency people with trivia (and as a result getting buy-in on each shot) we were able to please the client, keep the agency happy and get the shoot done on time, on budget.

I'd go with the known quantity that actually exists.  I always find these questions amusing. People here think that you can actually know something about a camera that hasn't been released yet. Until it's been out for a while and people have used it you don't know what's going to bite you that the manufacturer hasn't told you about.  Blackmagic is notorious for cutting corners, and they have to do that to make their cameras so cheap while still delivering some of what they promise."

""professionals"" - hardened pros who know they need a tool that works and are being primarily pragmatic when discussing these issues.  It's not that they can't geek out on specs or get hyped, but the reality is that they would never invest in an unproven/unreleased machine so upon the day of release, they would have already had the C100/FS700 up and running - and in 1 or 2 years may consider the URSA/etc. if it becomes a proven reliable tool that does in fact deliver a useful camera for the $ - they're here to dole out the hard truths based on their experience.   They're both very good insights to have in order to gather useful information (which is what I'm doing now).

cinematography,38nct2,dbto,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:31:17 2015 UTC,"To my understanding (And I could be wrong here) you're right - an external monitor needs to be tethered, and cuts the live view on the camera. Worth remembering too that the image outputted is 480, not 1080.   Obviously this isn't relevant if you're using an Atomos Ninja or something else like that. The cheapest and easiest way is to tether using eos utility. It'll lag, but it's free. Also, Magic Lantern may have a workaround for it. I don't use it so haven't checked."

I have a 5DmkII and if you plug a monitor into the HDMI  the screen on the camera cuts out and a 480p image is displayed on the monitor, it's not perfect but it works. Any overlays you have on the screen (even magic lantern displays) will be on the monitor.  I think the mkIII might be able to display the image without overlays, allowing the use of an external recorder, but I haven't used one so I could be wrong."
cinematography,38nvf4,YungCho,3,Fri Jun 5 12:49:03 2015 UTC,"The kinos are naturally soft, but don't give off a ton of light. The HMIs are naturally very hard, but will be a lot brighter then the kinos.  Ultimately it depends on the equipment you have on hand, but personally I like the HMIs. They have more light output and can still be soft through diffusion or bounced. (I was always told you can always make a big light smaller or a hard light softer, but you can't do the reverse). I really like using kinos though, and they do take less equipment to make a nice soft light since all you need is the light and ballast.  The HMIs will draw more power though, so if there are any constraints there you will need to take that into account. Both the 575 and 1200 should be fine working off a 20A line though.  Might be worth noting that I am also new to this, so a second opinion would probably be helpful.  Edit: I do not know the difference between the regular, FF and hi-speed arrisuns. I want to saw FF means flicker free based off of what I saw online, but I couldn't find anything definite."
cinematography,38nvf4,dennisc3,2,Fri Jun 5 13:37:31 2015 UTC,If you are working indoors covering not too large of an area I would recommend the kinos. They do not get hot like the arris which might affect the food and will definitely affect your crew/talent.  For single person interviews I like to use bleached muslin on 2 4x4 kinos stacked next to each other. Add a 2x4 kino over the camera to fill/eyelight.  On a cooking set you need lighter diffusion like grid cloth to get the light over more of your scene.
cinematography,38nvf4,tony_orlando,2,Fri Jun 5 15:22:15 2015 UTC,"Literally all I do for one of my DPs  is light indoor commercials / food stuff.  Kinos are SUPER soft, and they're very cold so they don't make talent sweat or food melt. They're like magic and worth every penny.  Imo they're the lights to buy and the Arris you should rent as you'll get more mileage from the kinos. Usually I use the HMIs in one of 2 ways: outside the house, shot through the window to motivate lighting the interior. Or as a book light to light a really huge space. The kinos make great soft light to fill a space evenly,  make wonderful interview lights, are easy to hide,  have bulbs to match all lighting scenarios, and most importantly you can rent them to friends for an assload of money on your days off.   The ONLY time I'd say the arri would be better is if you're getting a CU of just the food and you want a hard back light for some specular to make the dish appear fresh. In this situation though,  the hmi is too powerful,  so just buy a small LED for daylight or like a 300w fresnel for tungsten and punch it in super close."
cinematography,38nvf4,claytakephotos,2,Fri Jun 5 15:40:54 2015 UTC,"Depends on the situation!  Couple questions I have, before giving you a recommendation:  Is this being shot in a studio, or a location?  What's the aesthetic you're going for? High key, studio lighting? Or something more natural, like light being motivated from windows?  In general, the kinos are great for placing near talent since they give off very little heat. But you're going to need a few of them, depending on the size of the set/location and how wide the shots will get.  Arrisuns are great for shining through windows. Placed outsde of a window, they won't overheat the talent, won't cause sound issues. If aimed and placed just right, with the right diffusion, you can get them to look like natural sunlight. Even if you don't use them for a key light, they're great for making hot spots on walls in the background, which can help sell the illusion of natural sunlight. Same with a 575, just less intense. If for whatever reason you need to put an HMI close to talent, a 575 is a lot less hot and harsh on talent and crew.  TLDR: Really just depends on the look you're going for."
cinematography,38nvf4,jonathan_92,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:50:57 2015 UTC,"It mainly depends on the subject/shot size.  If you are shooting product or small inserts one 4x4 Kino 24 inches from a tiny subject is plenty soft, but if you are shooting larger subjects or spaces, a 4x4 kino won't be soft at all when it's 8-12ft away and it won't have nearly the output that far away compared to an diffused 1.2k HMI  In day to day use Kinos will be more versatile and used more often, BUT HMIs will get you a look you just can't get with Kinos.   I rarely shoot without both on set."

There's no shame in that. In fact, it's far better to have a unique style that's not right for some things-- because that means it's perfect for others.  No one's going to agree with everyone. But the thing is, you can't-- you can't-- be DP on a movie and be doing something for a director and thinking ""This guy's such an idiot. This is such a dumb thing we're doing."" Once a director makes up their mind-- after listening to your advice and guidance-- you need to commit to it 100%. If you can't share a vision with the director, neither one if you is going to end up with something worthwhile. I mean, you can do it and we've all been in those situations before where we kind of have to for whatever reason, but it's just going to turn out poorly for everyone.  Anyway. Sorry. Yeah. So to get back to the topic at hand: the worst ""director"" I ever worked for (can't really call her that), she hired me to film ""man on the street"" interviews for her sizzle reel so she could go be a ""tv personality"" or something. This was way back when I was just starting out.  So she's standing there and starts coming at me with these ridiculous requests. She wants the camera to ""swoop down from over there"" then ""swing over here"" and ""come in real close"" but ""still show her shoes (because she wore special shoes just for this)"" and ""don't get so far away.""  I had zero clue what she was talking about. I had a camera, and I had a tripod. I wasn't doing any swooping or swinging. Did she want me to pan, tilt, and zoom? Nope, she definitely didn't want that. (Which became especially tricky to show her shoes but still be in a requested close-up)  I just turned the camera on and told her to start talking.  Spent the next two or three hours carrying her bags around while she shopped, bitched about her boytoy that didn't respect her or something, then trolled for guys in bars while I stood outside with her bags (we did almost no actual filming). She literally found a guy in one of the bars and wanted me to follow her to another bar so she could have a date with him. I said no way, went home. Never talked to her again.  That was the day I learned self respect is more important than any job."
cinematography,38ibs8,Chamele0ns,3,Thu Jun 4 16:25:04 2015 UTC,"I'd add to this. As a director, I've just shot with a DP where we needed to shoot a fight, and I argued against steadicam, and liked using close up cut ins with camera movement to emphasise the kinetic nature of the fight. (Chris, this had better not be you!) My DP and I sat down and studied movies that shot fights well, to my mind and his. We discussed camera movement, and how to use it as a character in the piece. He was 100% on board with my ideas, and developed them and explained them in a way that I wasn't able to verbalise. On the day, we got through 55 set ups in 5 hours, because I'd got a shot list, he knew what he was doing, and we both knew how we wanted it to look. The end result I'll share when it's out (a couple of weeks) but has turned out to my mind and the clients - really well.  The point is as the above poster has said. If you hate what your director wants, don't do the project. Plus maybe don't bitch them out for having clear ideas of how they want to shoot their project behind their back."

cinematography,38dxn1,k1e4v,2,Wed Jun 3 16:13:52 2015 UTC,"Step printing uses an optical printer to repeat frames. Optical printers basically take a frame of a negative and project that onto a unexposed strip of film using a lens system. They do this frame by frame to copy a negative onto another strip of film. However, they also have the ability to advance the negative and the unexposed film independently. In other words from a negative with frames A B C D E, etc. you can make a new copy of the film but with frames A A B B C C, etc. in other words a duplication of every frame, doubling the length of the shot. This would be done by advancing the original every two times you advance the unexposed film. You can triple or quadruple, the frames, or even skip every other frame to speed the action up. The interesting stuff comes in when you start to combine these things. For example, you can do something like A A A A C C C C E E E E, which is quadrupling every 2 frames. You would do that by advancing the original by 2 frames for every 4 advancements of the unexposed film.  This is all done depending on the effect and the necessity."
cinematography,38dxn1,vatakarnic33,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:03:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I really like the A A A A C C C C E E E E idea. I'm wondering if there's some of that in the step printing in the opening sequence of Elephant Man, particularly when the woman is laying on her back turning her head from side to side. Either way, I'm going to play around with it in my own work."
cinematography,38dxn1,sonofaresiii,2,Thu Jun 4 16:20:09 2015 UTC,"So, just to dumb down the other responses in case it went over your head:  You know how regular slow motion works, right? You shoot at a faster frame rate, and play it back at a slower (usually 24fps) frame rate.  Step printing is where you shoot at 24fps, play back at 24fps, but want slow motion. So what do you do?  You duplicate each frame. (once for half-speed, thrice for third-speed, etc.)  So you have the same frames but each one is playing twice, still at the same 24fps, so you have half-speed slow motion.  To me, this usually looks like garbage and I try to avoid it if at all possible (unless it's a really strong, conscious decision with a good purpose), but it's often used when someone realizes they want slow motion after they already shot it at regular 24fps speed. Sometimes people do step-printing on purpose, because that's exactly the look they want.  Reservoir Dog's opening is a great example of step printing.  To more clearly see the difference between step printing slow motion and ""regular"" slow motion, check out the Zombieland intro which was actually shot at a higher frame rate and played back at 24fps.  You can see how much smoother that method is than step printing.  Digitally, when you take 24fps and slow it down in your nle, it's step printing. (It may be interpolating some frames as well, so not true step printing, but same basic idea).  And one last thing: technically step printing isn't necessarily just for slow motion. You could, say shoot at 12fps then double each frame to get to 24fps. That's still step printing, and would give you a stuttery look but played at normal speed. Might be an interesting effect for a music video or something. However, usually it's used for slow motion."
cinematography,38dxn1,sonofaresiii,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:24:38 2015 UTC,Thanks for the examples! I'm working on a film where I did a few shots at 12fps with the plan of doubling each frame to get the effect from the opening of Reservoir Dogs. I'd never heard the term 'step printing' until yesterday and wanted to see what it was. The more you know...
cinematography,38dxn1,BurnetRhoades,2,Thu Jun 4 16:26:42 2015 UTC,"Cool man. Keep in mind, you won't be emulating reservoir dogs exactly because in RD the motion is actually slowed down. What you're doing will result in motion at normal speed, but it'll be juttery.  I'd be interested to see what it looks like, when you're finished shoot me a link"
cinematography,38dxn1,Arakin,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:35:08 2015 UTC,I thought the motion blur in the closeups in RD looked more like 12 than 24 and I thought doubling that would give you the slow-mo effect. I can see what you're saying about that simply being juttery.  For mine I'll probably end up tripling the frames to give it a 1.5x feel. I'll PM you a cut when I'm finished. Should be in the next couple weeks.
cinematography,38dxn1,Arakin,2,Thu Jun 4 20:18:05 2015 UTC,"Step printing is simply printing multiple copies of a frame to effectively change the playback framerate.  If you took a normal one second of film and printed each frame twice instead of once you effectively slow the action down by 2X.    It doesn't look as good (stuttery instead of smooth) as if you'd shot at 48fps (or higher) and then played that back at 24fps but sometimes directors/editors decide to slow action down after the film's already shot.  Either because of budget or lack of access to cameras capable of ""overcrank"" speeds you'll see a lot of step-printing for slow motion in classic John Woo films like The Killer and Hard Boiled.  You can also do the reverse and skip frames in order to speed action up.  George Miller does a lot of this in the Mad Max films, either running the cameras at slower speeds or, for the latest in the series, dropping frames in post, doing a digital ""step print"" even though ""printing"" is more or less an anachronistic term now.  In the digital realm you do this by either changing the way footage is interpreted on import or you apply some kind of time-remapping effect."

cinematography,389me1,Codaflow,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:06:38 2015 UTC,"There is definitely an art to action/violence cinematography. A good stunt coordinator/previs always helps, and there are always exemptions to the rules, but in general: For making impactful hits, you generally want to be on the same axis as the object striking the actor (be it a weapon or fist). They should be slightly separated so there is no actual impact, but have the actors use full force, especially in the reaction of the actor being ""hit"". If you use a slightly longer lens to compress the two together, it will help sell the effect. For example, if one actor is punching another in the face, you will basically want an OTS that is looking directly down the actors arm and into the other actors face. The distance between the two will be masked and it will look as if the fist impacted. Shoot the reverse OTS and you will have two great shots to cut together. Pulling out a single frame on the impact will also help, but thats a post thing (Good editing is extremely important for action scenes). You can, of course spice things up with camera movement and other tricks, but thats the general idea."

I think its interesting what (lens?) people choose to look through when basing opinions on a camera.  For the price range I can agree, not very competitive. Also, the realm that this short was shot and presented in was a little bit of a misstep from a marketing standpoint. Now you have every nimrod going off half-cocked and while maybe not saying it -- is quietly/subconsciously comparing this camera and other cameras in the same league to higher spec camera systems. In essence that creates a lot of white noise I would love to tune out. The C300 MKI is a camera that still goes out on a lot of shoots I am on for various networks. It is a money maker, I've bore witness to it and, it is going to continue to do so."

It's interesting to see that the buildings in the background show a lot more contrast on the Cine lenses than on the L-series lenses. Also, the difference in brightness at the different f/stops is startling. Not consistent at all."
cinematography,383yv4,ArtAdamsDP,8,Mon Jun 1 22:59:16 2015 UTC,"For anyone who doesn't know, this is because F-stops are a measurement of light entering the lens determined by the ratio of focal length to aperture diameter. For example, I would expect f5.6 on a canon L prime to be brighter than f5.6 on the canon L 24-70 which in turn would be brighter than f5.6 on the canon L 70-200 based on lens complexity alone.  T-stops on the other hand (the scale used for cinema lenses) measure the amount of light exiting the back of the lens, which means that any matched set of lenses (or theoretically any lens) should be equally bright throughout the focal lengths available at a given stop.  edit: Here is a good overview video"
cinematography,383yv4,paulagostinelli,4,Tue Jun 2 02:29:15 2015 UTC,"Good point. I didn't notice that the Cine lenses were in T-stops and the L-series were in f/stops.  F/stops, though, aren't a measure of light entering the lens. They are the the ratio of the focal length to the diameter of the entrance pupil. It controls how much light is entering the lens but it's not really measuring it. T-stops are based on actual measurements, and are usually 1/4-1/3 stops slower than f/stops."
cinematography,383yv4,ArtAdamsDP,2,Tue Jun 2 03:43:15 2015 UTC,"Yes that is definitely correct, I was trying to give the ELI5 explanation and the comment was more directed towards people who hadn't even heard there was a difference.

Basically, and not to assume you don't know what you're doing, just be careful when assuming you retain full legal rights to your footage.

Personally I tend to be clear that I have a shooting rate, and an editing rate, so in my mind they had always hired me to just shoot their footage for them, then they also hired me to edit their footage for them.

Having played with one last week, I can tell you exactly the reason of using Cinema glass. It's about workflow. It's about precision in setting up the camera. It's about focus.   Example; in order to move from 1 to 2 meters in the focus dial, it's almost 180 degrees on a zeiss cinema lens, but about 20-40 degrees on a cheap photography lens. This means that the most important thing in your shot, it being in focus, is much much easier to establish. The other was a similar experience with appature. In a ring, without clicks, you truly appreciate what light does to the image, and lets you hone in on that precise look you're after.   It's basically the difference between a pro and an amateur. I'm still the latter, but I'm trying to slowly move into the former. I do it with rented gear, when appropriate. But at the end of the day, it's just a tool to do a job. You get nothing more. It's just light on a chip. And is it worth buying? For 99% of people considering it, I'd say no. But if you need it for more than 30-40 days, then yes."

But it's smart and well-done. The points they make are valid: The assets of a lens aren't necessarily always about image quality, these weren't the conditions where the expensive lenses shine, and you start to hit diminishing returns as you get more expensive.

Shooting at 24fps normally gives you a fixed 1/48-sec shutter speed."

He also doesn't use an entire array of focal lengths, like if you were to watch a scene breakdown on a Shane Hurlbut show or something done for Michael Bay or other such grab-bag approaches.  He generally seems to use a disciplined application of only a handful of focals for  wides, mediums and close-ups.  And he often prefers Zeiss.  Going back to at least The Game, maybe Se7en, when in doubt he chooses the 27mm.  It seems to be a favorite focal of his.  In fact The Game was almost entirely shot on just two lenses, a 75mm for close-ups and the 27mm for just about everything else.  House of Cards is mostly 27mm and 35mm, with longer lenses used occasionally for close-ups.  His use of specific lenses and composition are what make his films so signature and why you (should) spot a David Fincher film (or TV show) without ever seeing his name in the credits.  This signature look and feel has persisted across film and multiple dissimilar digital platforms and multiple cinematographers."

So they're great to start with.  Besides that, arri and mole richardson are great brands that make some really strong lights. Those things are built like tanks. If you find one available for a good price, you don't have to worry too much about it falling apart. If it turns on, it's probably good to go.

If you use Davinci Resolve (and you should), I recommend Ripple Training.  Their courses are done by Alexis Van Hurkman, who also writes the manuals for Resolve.  For starters, you need to learn how to import the RAW footage with an appropriate conversion LUT to bring it into Rec 709.  Then you need to color correct to neutral to create a starting point without color bias.  Then you start working on your looks.  A LUT is just a shortcut.  It's just a preset.  You would be better off in the long run learning how to color correct manually so you have control over the process.  The one exception is when converting from RAW into your working space.  Then, the manufacturer's LUT is important to get you to the right starting point.  Good luck!"

cinematography,37wvbl,Scrowley91,1 point,Sun May 31 18:43:23 2015 UTC,"I'd go for the NX500... great video image, and you get 4K (albeit in a cropped mode). Samsung seems very eager to take over this market and have been updating the NX1 pretty aggressively via firmware, and I would expect the NX500 to get some of that love as well."
cinematography,37wvbl,Scrowley91,1 point,Sun May 31 21:15:50 2015 UTC,Yeah it certainly does look great. The only thing is that the a6100/7000 is right around the corner so maybe I should just wait for that. It'll have 4k support as well as some other tweaks and updates plus sony has way more lenses for now. I don't know... seems like it would be best to go sony now and then in a year or two samsung will maybe have come out with more lenses and it'll be worth it. Maybe even a viewfinder

cinematography,37viih,Earth_Worm_Jimbo,7,Sat May 30 19:16:11 2015 UTC,"I believe you're going to want to look into optical flow plugins that interpolate the frames automatically. I have not used Twixtor, but it is pretty powerful from what I've seen for faking slowmo, not sure if it can help you in this situation however. A quick search pulled up BorisFX Time effects which includes an oflow plugin as well.  Good luck!"
cinematography,37viih,EvadingRye,2,Sat May 30 20:02:39 2015 UTC,"Twixtor worked flawlessly, kinda gave it this awesome blurr-but-not-blurr effect too, thanks loads u/EvadingRye."
cinematography,37viih,EvadingRye,3,Sun May 31 14:44:47 2015 UTC,Glad it worked out. Thanks for reporting back!
cinematography,37viih,drummerboy678,5,Mon Jun 1 15:01:38 2015 UTC,"Is there any coverage at 24 or is it all at 12?  It may be a big stylistic shift, but mad max certainly had most of its shots sped up faster than 24 (although 12 is very fast).  Find a good editor/VFX person. There are certain plug-ins in After Effects - Pixel Motion and Twixtor, which will interpolate and create frames based on the ones before and after.  This could work pretty well.   Good luck!"
cinematography,37viih,halexand,2,Sat May 30 20:01:08 2015 UTC,"I believe what they did in Mad Max was shoot at a low frame rate, such as 12 fps, but play it back at 12 fps in order to achieve a stuttered, strobe effect rather than to change the speed. It was a pretty cool effect and could work for OP's action scene."
cinematography,37viih,C47man,2,Sat May 30 22:46:11 2015 UTC,"The strobe effect is shutter speed, not framerate. Playback is always at 24 in the theatre, so playing back at 12 means duplicating each frame once. That is definitely not a good look."
cinematography,37viih,halexand,2,Sat May 30 22:51:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, closing down the shutter angle creates the strobe effect we all know and love. However, shooting at a lower frame rate and then duplicating frames is not necessarily a bad look. That's what they used to do with cell animation, I've done it myself for action scenes. I can't be certain that this is what they did on Mad Max but considering the fact that they apparently shot much of the movie as low as 10 fps (according to John Seale) it seems within the realm of possibility. I find it hard to believe that the sped up 10 fps to 24. That would be beyond cheesy."
cinematography,37viih,C47man,2,Mon Jun 1 16:06:23 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I'll have to test this out. Thanks for the info!"
cinematography,37viih,drummerboy678,2,Mon Jun 1 16:12:05 2015 UTC,"My understanding was it was shot at 12 (or anywhere from 12-23fps) then played back at 24.  It would still give the stutter effect because of less frames, but the motion is sped up. I know this is what they did on many shots in the opening chase sequence."
cinematography,37viih,devotchko,2,Sat May 30 23:37:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but where does your understanding come from? I just read the ASC feature and it does not mention shooting at 12 or any other frame rates."
cinematography,37viih,drummerboy678,2,Sun May 31 00:52:31 2015 UTC,"The ASC article was great.  This is from Wikipedia but I believe was quoted from an ASC talk that Seale did -   ""The frame rate was also manipulated to achieve a desired effect. ""Something like 50 or 60 percent of the film is not running at 24 frames a second, which is the traditional frame rate,"" said Seale. ""It'll be running below 24 frames because George, if he couldn't understand what was happening in the shot, he slowed it down until you could. Or if it was too well understood, he'd shorten it or he'd speed it up back towards 24. His manipulation of every shot in that movie is intense.""  So I think it was definitely a mixture of shooting various frame rates in camera and also modifying speed in post."
cinematography,37viih,D1r3ctor,-1,Sun May 31 01:54:02 2015 UTC,John Seale freely admits that he doesn't understand digital post. Nowhere in that ASC talk (which I watched all the way through) does he state that he undercranked those Arris. It's all post.

cinematography,37viih,arheff,-2,Sat May 30 22:52:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry, OP, you have messed up badly.   Neither Twixtor nor any other optical flow programme will be able to rescue your footage and you will have to reshoot.   Hong Kong fight scenes are filmed at 21 or 22 for speed. I always shoot mine at 50fps so that I can speed ramp up or down in post. And I always review footage after every major take. It's common sense.   Man up and offer to reshoot for free."
cinematography,37v4yy,Seanzzxx,3,Sat May 30 17:35:51 2015 UTC,"I hadn't heard about added sharpness in Cinema Lock. I've used it a lot and not had a problem, but they're right: you generally want to eliminate sharpness when you're going to be grading later, as you can always add it in but you can't remove it. Ideally you'd sharpen appropriately in post for each of your deliverables: video will be sharpened a bit more than film, which won't require much, etc.  There are two things I'd look at:  Checi whether you can enable the Canon Log-to-Rec 709 LUT in the viewfinder if you're not in Cinema Lock mode. That's the only way you can really see what you're doing without using an external LUT box or a monitor that can apply that LUT for you. Canon Log puts middle gray at 32% instead of 40% in order to give you more highlight latitude (the camera doesn't have much otherwise) so the image looks a bit too dark without the LUT.  You might also look at using Wide DR instead of Canon Log. That has a gentle S-curve to it already so you can see what you're doing. Also, given that the C300 records only in 8-bit color, you don't have to push the footage as hard later. If you make the image really contrasty (strong S-curve) you may see banding in the mid-tones. With Wide DR you have a little extra room to push as part of the S-Curve is already there. You don't need to view that look through a LUT.  You do need to white balance for Canon Log, as you do for all log formats. And you need to white balance for all raw formats other than Red Raw, which is the only file format I know of where you can truly white balance in post with no compromises."
cinematography,37v4yy,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Sat May 30 18:12:45 2015 UTC,"Hm, Wide DR does sound interesting. So in that profile I would not 'underexpose' the mid-levels like I would for C-Log, correct?  Thanks for answering so quickly and usefully by the way!  EDIT: Also, doesn't sit middle gray at 50% normally?"
cinematography,37v4yy,ArtAdamsDP,2,Sat May 30 18:38:36 2015 UTC,"Hey, glad to help. :) I believe you don't underexpose Wide DR like Canon Log. I never have. You have a little less overexposure headroom as a result, but if you're shooting under controlled circumstances that won't hurt you.  And no, middle gray is not at 50%... gamma curves are non-linear. I wrote an article about this a while back, with the formula used to translate reflected light values into IRE values, that might be interesting to you.  It may have been closer to 50% in standard def, where we had 7.5 IRE ""setup"". That meant that black was at 7.5 IRE instead of 0, and there was a bunch of information hidden between 0 and 7.5. We don't need that in HD, so black is 0 now.  In Rec 709 viewing middle gray is always at 40 IRE (technically 40.9 or something like that). In log formats, which are meant only for storage and not for viewing, they can be tweaked so middle gray floats around. Some, like Sony SLog3 and Arri Log, put middle gray at 40%. Others, like SLog2 and Canon Log, try to squeeze out more highlight detail by pushing that value lower, knowing you'll pull it up in post anyway. That increases noise somewhat but does hold detail in highlights better."
cinematography,37v4yy,jonathan_92,-1,Sun May 31 00:41:08 2015 UTC,"Not to nit-pick you, but c300's shoot in XF 422, which is a 10-bit codec.   What this means for you, OP, is that while you will still need to set white balance, you will have a lot of room to change it in post. You could still shoot in rec709 if you wanted to bake in your look, and have some room to change it, although I would not recommend it.  Edit: Crap, sneaky sneaky canon. What is it with them and their 8-bit silliness?"
cinematography,37v4yy,Aschwab,3,Sat May 30 22:05:11 2015 UTC,The C300 is an 8-bit camera.
cinematography,37v4yy,ArtAdamsDP,3,Sat May 30 22:16:44 2015 UTC,It doesn't matter what the codec is. The DSP (digital signal processor) only puts out 8 bit color. 8-bit color in a 10-bit codec is still 8-bit color.
cinematography,37v4yy,jonathan_92,1 point,Sun May 31 00:23:27 2015 UTC,"Wow, I learned something today, thanks! That would explain why c100-300s, even shooting 422, are more difficult to color grade than black magic and sony footage, and why the footage falls apart so quickly. The data just isn't there to begin with!  Friggin canon man."
cinematography,37v4yy,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Sun May 31 00:27:41 2015 UTC,"Hey, it was their first try. :) Limiting the DSP to 8 bits is a huge cost savings as that saves a ton in processing power. They won't do that again. :)  I'm anxious to see the C300 Mk2, that should be a significant shift for Canon. It doesn't seem to be able to do the high frame rates that others do but I'm curious to see if the dynamic range is as high as they claim."

Anyway, I lead the team that dealt with the flooded valley, extending the photography of the talent shot in a small water tank to the horizon, adding in the rooftops and trees and I did the one full-digital water shot for the coffin breach (the coffin and its splash was real, everything else was me and the composite lead).  He was awesome.  I think the state of visual effects and the overall look and feel of your big movies would be a lot different if the work was overseen by the DP and/or an art director and not the current paradigm.

In 2/4 of your shots your white highlights are quite over exposed.   Just wondering though... why not shoot color? Is there a thematic reason for shooting b&w? If you're going for a dramatic effect, you certainly have enough latitude to push your color grade to reflect ""drama"""

I saw this guy's listings and 1)he's hosing himself, and 2)the type of listings he has, and the way he's listing them is going to limit how much he books. Too many questions about the gear, for even indie/scratch budget projects.  Also, camera bodies tend to go for about 2.5% purchase cost (i.e. 40 rentals), other items like lenses can go for anywhere from 1% for very long term items like an Optimo 11-1, or 2% for a newer PL lens. AKS like monitors traditionally is much higher.  LA has had stupid Craigslist rates for the bottom feeders for a while now. You get what you pay for, really."

It does hurt to be competing in the same marketplace with guys like that but I stay busy without lowering my rates. Truth is - I have fifteen years of relationships I've built into a brand and so when people hire me, they know what they are getting.

cinematography,37ru6c,Maxgirth,5,Sat May 30 02:13:34 2015 UTC,"At $400/day it would take a camera owner/operator 125 days to enter profit on a RED DRAGON camera package. The average production day is 12 hours. That means 1500 hours of use before the camera can begin to make a profit.    High end digital cameras are not like automobiles, not with the insurance, or 100 years of engineering know how. Needless to say - they don't last as long.    For some perspective - that's the equivalent of a taxi driver having to drive 50,000 miles in order to start profiting from his taxi.    It's low. Horrifically and unfairly low. And for anyone else who had to scrimp and save over eight years to buy their camera - it's a bit unfair and unnecessary. Even in LA the market can handle $600-750/day for the same camera package."

cinematography,37ru6c,Vomitclaw,2,Sat May 30 02:54:40 2015 UTC,It really varies. For expensive stuff like camera packages it's 1-3%. Smaller items like monitors and even filters can go much higher. There's no point in getting a filter that takes 3 years to pay off.

Speaking to your other point, 125 days to turn a profit is totally not unreasonable. My gear is constantly moving - obviously some gear pays itself off faster than others and you'd want to hedge your purchases and make smart choices. Buying a camera is RARELY a moneymaking venture, it's probably one of the worst pieces of gear to buy if you plan on paying it off and turning profit as the tech is constantly improving.  I'm glad you clarified this post, but this is obviously a guy who needs to recoup some losses and not so much make money on his purchase. You'll see this all the time with entry-level pro gear with large production runs. He is hurting the market by undercutting, but instead of getting mad at this guy, take it as a lesson as what is a better, future-proof investment."

I've been in the expensive gear rental game for 10 years, and production for 25. Not an expert, just had some years to get acquainted with my own bank account bearing the brunt of my mistakes.   Speaking to your other point, 125 days to turn a profit is totally not unreasonable   That's not what most rental businesses price camera bodies at. You can call it reasonable, I can call it unreasonable, but really, that's likely 3-4 years of of bookings and at the end of most cameras desirability sweet spot. Some cameras are officially dead in the water at that point. You gotta get that camera profitable while it's still desirable and not on it's way out.  I'll continue to shoot for profitability in 40 rentals. Reality is 50-55, for myself.   If you bought a Panther dolly or a Arri M18 that can work for 15 years, maybe profit at 125 days/3 years is not so bad. But for camera gear, that's literally a camera lifetime I feel.   Buying a camera is RARELY a moneymaking venture   If you're doing it right, it's fine. But you need the right production contacts to do it. This guy in these Sharegrid postings does NOT have any real contacts in the business, obviously. I doubt he'll be at it too long, with this method."
cinematography,37ru6c,fs454,1 point,Sat May 30 16:39:11 2015 UTC,"I think we are saying the same thing. I'm pointing out that there's always going to be guys who get ahead of themselves and buy a camera thinking it will pay for itself via rentals. They try and fail and then try to get any sort of margin back by offering undercut costs.  People in the rental game tend to buy future proof gear like grip, lights, monitors, etc until you can build your contacts and easily pay off your gear.  My point is that why is anyone getting mad at some random guy who bought a red and is trying to make some side coin? It's just not worth any effort. They will always be around. When buying a camera it should be because you want to shoot with it, not make money."
cinematography,37ru6c,SundayExperiment,3,Sat May 30 17:01:03 2015 UTC,"I have to say, I really don't think it's fair to compare rental house prices to independent owners' prices.   I work at a rental house and I take a lot of pride in the fact that I know when I give a client their equipment, it will do the job it's meant to do. We beat the crap out of equipment in this industry, it's just the nature of the beast. That means everything needs a good servicing, not just every once in awhile, but very regularly.   When you rent from independent owners, it's very likely that they aren't camera or accessory service experts like the people who work at camera houses. The people I work with (I don't do service) are insanely intelligent when it come to gear. It's all they do, day in and day out, every day. It costs a lot of money to employ a staff of people who are experts in servicing cameras or lenses or everything else that goes out on set. Of course this equipment is cheaper, it doesn't have any of the added cost of maintenance built in. (but still, holy shit that's cheap)   If it were me, I would find a camera house to take my camera on consignment. Often that means that the camera house will service and find work for your equipment, albeit for a good cut of the money, usually around half of what they're charging for it. That being said, it's still likely to make more money over the lifespan of the equipment than if you were trying to rent it independently.   Anyway, that's my two cents.   P.S. Someone who has been in the rental side for a long time told me the whole 3 day rental week started at panavision because of the writer's strike. Work was so dead that they introduced 3 day weeks as an incentive for people to start shooting again and it stuck. Just what I heard."

They're a good deal cheaper than literally everywhere in LA as long as you have the day to overnight the stuff. Any lenses they don't have we rent local.

cinematography,37ru6c,dinosawrsareawesome,5,Fri May 29 22:00:20 2015 UTC,"I think what op was complaining about was the fact that the lens (which is essentially 1/10th of the Red's value) costs roughly 4/10ths of the price of the Red's rental. Which, admittedly, I think is kinda bizarre."

I'll be damned if that isn't exactly what it looked like. I also had an interaction with him wherein he was looking at 12 low angle blondes, one of which had 1/2 cts instead of 3/4.

Until Lubezki, Doyle's unconventional style was my favorite but the sad truth IMO is that he has no clue how to pick a good movie nowadays so his talent gets wasted on films like ""Lady in the Water"" but the man is a beast none the less. I never really recommend Doyle movies for this reason but if you look into his old stuff Like ""Last Life in the Universe"" and you can tolerate slower paced movies I'd recommend that one, the way the tattoo scene was filmed blew my mind at the time. Sadly, many of his movies are too romantically driven for my current taste. After seeing this interview you can't just help but like the guy.

cinematography,37oujk,poopyfarts,6,Fri May 29 06:00:24 2015 UTC,"the flicker effect is usually regarded as a mistake. its when the shutter on the camera is out of sync with the lights. it's quite easy to ""achieve"" this effect. just mess with your shutter a little bit until you see flicker. as for the visibility at night, they were shooting film, so high speed film and lots of light. they had lights everywhere. whether it was the car headlights, streetlights, or maybe even cinema lights if they used them."
cinematography,37oujk,Townsie,4,Fri May 29 09:56:42 2015 UTC,"To elaborate, sodium vapor lights (the orange ones) require a ballast to power. Florescent lights and HMIs require ballasts as well, due to the way they need to be powered (which is an electrical engineering lesson in and of itself.) The ballast has a frequency that it runs at. When the frequency of the ballast and the frequency of the shutter of the camera don't line up exactly right, you get a flicker. Sometimes you can't notice it, but sometimes it's really exaggerated. In your example, they were shooting at a higher frame rate, so the shutter speed was much faster than normal, which exacerbated the flicker. Film lights have flicker free balasts where the frequency is regulated to a multiple of 48, which assumes you're using a 180 degree shutter at 24 fps. Some lights have frequencies high enough to be used with high speed cameras up to many thousands of frames per second.  So why don't normal household lamps have this problem? The tungsten filament in incandescent lamps take a long time to cool down (meaning more than 1/4 second.) So the 60 Hz (or 50Hz in Eurpoe) pulse of power doesn't affect the light output, since the filament remains red hot for the 1/60th of a second it doesn't have power."

These shots have such scope and still so detailed and precise. I love :41 and 1:41. Also what is going on in the top right corner of the lens at times. It seems like a serious issue. It happened in like 5-10 of your shots. Almost looks like a finger entering the frame in the top right.
cinematography,37mk4i,acksack,1 point,Fri May 29 01:04:32 2015 UTC,Hey thanks a lot!  As far as the anamorphot it's an old 16mm lens that you screw onto the front of another lens. It has its own aesthetic qualities and will also take on the qualities of whatever lens you're mounting it onto so it's important to take make and focal length into consideration.  Some issues that you need to be aware of is 1) You need to focus both your anamorphic lens and your taking lens at the starting (Which is why you see me do a lot of side to side pans but not a lot of in and out). I've shot on film a lot and done a lot of 1st ACing so I'm pretty good at eye balling distances so I'd do the anamorphic by eye and then focus in the taking lens in camera. I'll put up some screen shots of what happens when the taking lens is in focus but the anamorphic isnt and vice versa.  2) the issue in the top right corner is vignetting. The lens I was using was a zoom so and I couldn't go wider than about 22 on it. When you see that I'm probably around a 20 or 21. Also you screw the lens on so you have to be careful to have it straight or the image will be skewed and you may get an uneven vignette.  All in all though I love the lens and it's so satisfying to 'unsqueeze' a shot. It's like shooting it for the second time haha

If I had to be incredibly nitpicky, I'd say you could cut the shot of the Capitol Building since it feels a bit out of place (there isn't really anything else going on, if that makes sense). Then also maybe the dolly OTS shot at 0:20 could use a regrade or something, as the magenta cast and gamma curve of it seems to feel somewhat rougher/less polished than your other work (a problem I didn't feel in the shot that precedes it).   But again, this is really excellent. One of the strongest reels I've seen on here. A ton of variety too.

cinematography,37l0mk,SnowyTom,1 point,Thu May 28 14:53:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have modified the mounts with the Leitax EF mounts. Superb quality and build. The optics in these Zeiss are very similar, if not the same as the current Zeiss still lenses, a different coating on the glass is the main difference. It's taken me a few years to build this set, and I absolutely love the look I get from them The 21mm is still regarded as one of the best wide angle lenses you can buy, hence why it is one of the most expensive in the set."
cinematography,37l0mk,SnowyTom,1 point,Thu May 28 16:16:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah there's a lot of 21mm Biogons out there, only one Distagon which I presume is the  one you have from the picture.   I was on the fence as to whether to get Nikon AIS (which are more popularly rehoused) or an older set of Zeiss, I think my decision is made now. I usually shoot on zooms for ease and speed but I've been borrowing friends lenses (old Olympus and Samyang cines) and it's winning me around for narrative shoots.  One thing I love is that you have a consistent front filter size (I presume 82mm?) which makes buying filters and matte box donuts etc. a pretty painless experience.   How do you find the 35mm f2.8? It seems to be the cheapest and most readily available, I'm hoping that's not a sign of poor quality as that's one of my favourite focal lengths."

They 100% used a motion control rig, which places the camera on the end of a robotic arm that can perform a precise set of moves. Because we never see the arm itself or the dolly track they placed it on, I am guessing they painted it out in post production or stitched together multiple takes."

He spoke about the day for night process and how his DIT and effects team advised him to overexpose 2 tops to retain lots of shadow detail to be brought up to flatten the highlights after (unsure if they used gripage like you mentioned but considering the content of the talk I'd guess not).

Unfortunately for AJA, the $4995 4.6K URSA Mini EF is probably going to eat their lunch."
cinematography,37jb5a,HybridCamRev,2,Thu May 28 09:56:30 2015 UTC,Is this camera any good?
cinematography,37jb5a,Future_of_Cinema,1 point,Thu May 28 09:37:20 2015 UTC,"Many, many questions on that.  It has a relatively low dynamic range. The ergonomics are something some dislike.  At the same time it can provide some good images.   It would not be my choice. I prefer other cameras for the price."
cinematography,37jb5a,holomntn,1 point,Thu May 28 10:39:25 2015 UTC,What's dynamic range?
cinematography,37jb5a,Future_of_Cinema,1 point,Thu May 28 20:58:52 2015 UTC,"The distance between black and white. Low dynamic range means you lose details in shadows and highlights, high dynamic range keeps details in shadows and highlights.   Dynamic range is measured in stops, which is just a doubling. So a camera that has 11 stops has twice as much distance between black and white as a camera with 10 stops. We use stops because of the way human sight works, the doubling closely mimics the ability of the human eye to perceive a difference.   The CION is listed as a 12 stop camera, general agreement is that it has about 10 stops that are useful. Compare this to the top camera (based on Oscar nominations), the Arri Alexa lists 14+ stops, and about 13.5 stops useful. So the Alexa has about 16 times as much useful distance between black and white, that is an enormous difference in seeing in the shadows."
cinematography,37jb5a,holomntn,1 point,Fri May 29 01:04:46 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot. Someone should tell this to that guy in the other thread who asked why his DSLR footage doesn't look cinematic. I knew it has something to do with shadows I just didn't know anything about dynamic range.
cinematography,37jb5a,Future_of_Cinema,2,Fri May 29 08:29:03 2015 UTC,"In order to appreciate this camera, you probably need to understand where they're coming from:  There's a lot of new cameras coming out with sky rocketing resolutions and an ever growing abundance of RAW and Log formats.  While this is attractive to cinematographers, it is the opposite for many post-production purposes.  There is a big market for fast-turnaround content: news, daily television programming, etc.  These sectors have no interest in using anything that requires just as much time to grade (or even transcode) than to edit and export.  I believe the CION was designed for this market, and therefore attempts to produce 'good enough' image quality with an edit-friendly codec, without need the need of LUTs or other LOG conversions, and it is priced near the DSLR market, which is what many of these productions are already using.    So... if you understand that, you'll also see why cinematographers don't like it.  As an editor myself, I wouldn't mind it.  For daily content, I'd much prefer this over any DSLR or any camera that shoots RAW/Log, simply because I often get content 4-5 hours because it goes to air.  I edit plenty of RED and Sony RAW content too, but that is for a different purpose and has different edit timeframes/expectations."
cinematography,37jb5a,agent42b,5,Thu May 28 12:32:32 2015 UTC,"This is a false dichotomy. Any camera that shoots log also has a WYSIWYG mode, as well as more dynamic range.  A limited dynamic range camera is actually less useful for fast-turnaround projects because they require more time for lighting or they look awful.  News is a fast-turnaround business but I wouldn't want to shoot it under existing light with a camera that has 8 stops of dynamic range.  I can shoot an FS7 in a mode that doesn't require color grading and I still get 14 stops of usable dynamic range to play with. Heck, you can get more dynamic range and bake in a decent look with any of the Blackmagic cameras.   if you understand that, you'll also see why cinematographers don't like it.   That makes no sense. Cinematographers aren't only shooting raw or log. There's plenty of work out there that doesn't get color graded. I've had commercials go on the air that look exactly the way I shot them, and I've shot them on very common cameras: Alexa, Sony F5/F55/FS7, Canon C300 and 5D.   There is a big market for fast-turnaround content: news, daily television programming, etc. These sectors have no interest in using anything that requires just as much time to grade (or even transcode) than to edit and export. I believe the CION was designed for this market   The Cion wasn't ""designed for this market."" Since they already had the recorder technology, AJA decided to put a camera on the front of it. Then they discovered that making a camera is WAY harder than they thought it would be. Heck, it took RED 7-8 years to come out with Dragon, which is their first really good camera, and they started from scratch as well.  You don't design a crippled camera for a ""fast turnaround"" market. You design a camera and do the best you can, because the more boxes it can check the more cameras you'll sell. If you can't check many boxes compared to your competition, you change your marketing and say, ""This isn't a 'cine' camera, it's a 'production' camera for controlled lighting situations and fast turnaround projects.""  And then you wonder why you can't sell any, because there are lots of other cameras out there at comparable price points that can do much, much more."
cinematography,37jb5a,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Thu May 28 18:26:37 2015 UTC,Every camera that has a LOG mode also has a mode that's similar to REC.709 for projects that don't need color grading like the situations that you've mentioned above.
cinematography,37jb5a,MuppetDentist,1 point,Thu May 28 13:34:28 2015 UTC,"I know, but the fact that it has log mode means that nearly everyone will shoot in that.  Camera department doesn't often listen to post ;)"
cinematography,37jb5a,agent42b,1 point,Thu May 28 14:36:53 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make any sense. If you shoot log, and post isn't expecting log, and it costs the producer more money to grade it that they didn't have budgeted, you won't work for that producer again."
cinematography,37jb5a,ArtAdamsDP,0,Thu May 28 18:28:01 2015 UTC,"Absolute shit camera.   Watch some ""ungraded"" footage online from this thing. It looks graded. Believe it or not, that's an extremely bad thing. It means that you have a very limited latitude and color range that you can light to. It also only does 200iso... So that means less flexibility on set. In practical scenarios, flexibility is EVERYTHING. Its the difference between needing a huge lighting rental and a relatively modest one.  Sure, you can light any camera carefully enough to get some beautiful imagery, even dslr's. But having that flexibility of 13 stops instead of 6 is the difference between needing a 3 hour lighting set up, and a multi-thousand dollar per day grip rental, versus twenty minutes and half as many lights."
cinematography,37jb5a,jonathan_92,1 point,Thu May 28 11:34:06 2015 UTC,"It has more ISO settings than just 200, but it gets the most dynamic range at the lower ISOs. At 1000 it gets 6-8 stops, maybe.  And yes, that stuff takes a LOT longer to light."

Sony's final hurrah for Betamax, Extended-Definition Beta, was actually a tad higher quality than DV, not quite BetaCam but close, but it was analog so you lost the advantage as soon as you did a single generation copy or incurred an A-to-D step to bring it into a computer.  Digitizing analog video required more disk and faster disk than working with DV so it was ultimately more expensive for both less flexibility and often lower final quality."

cinematography,37e00i,Steve-Gary,13,Tue May 26 22:58:08 2015 UTC,"So here's the thing:  This could absolutely be a ""cinematic"" shot, if by that you mean exists in a quality feature film.  From the screen grab alone, there's no reason this shot couldn't work in the right context. Any shot can work in the right context.  So we need to narrow down exactly what kind of look you're going for, that you think this is failing to achieve.  For me, I would buy this shot in a sort of ""regular woman decides to become a superhero, and does so poorly"" type movie. Like the beginning of Kick-Ass or Super.  But let's assume what you're asking is why does this not look like... let's say The Dark Knight Rises, so we can compare Catwoman to Catwoman.  Here's a reference shot of Hathaway in TDKR.  To start, the lighting in your grab isn't balanced. It's green and blue. For TDKR, we see a properly balanced (white) light on the subject. This probably comes from the video you posted not using professional lights, but just cheap work lights (or none, and shooting with whatever the street was naturally giving them)  From there, in your grab we see some shadows on her neck and clavicle. This alone doesn't knock it out of TDKR territory (and in fact a similar affect is on Hathaway), but it's not great, and is especially noticeable because of the mixed color temperature. In TDKR it's more purposefully placed and graded to not be as visually intrusive.  Pfister (the TDKR cinematographer) also definitely wouldn't let the side of her clothes turn to mush like in your grab. There would be a little light there to see the detail. In the Hathaway picture we can see some highlights in the dark regions of her clothes-- even though the latex does go to black in some parts, we can see there's still some light there giving us the detail of the outfit and separating it from the background or going to mush.  But by far the biggest issue in your example is that they didn't light the background. It's just naturally light by streetlights. A pro cinematographer would splash light around to make it interesting, possibly add points of color to create some color depth, put some shadows in there instead of just boring streetlamps. Really look at the background in that Hathaway picture. There's splashes of light, and shadow. There's a bluish-white searchlight, and an orangish searchlight. There's all kind of color there, and color that's been purposefully places.  The background, besides our splashes of light, is also much darker than the subject in the Hathaway pictures-- you typically usually want your background to be darker than your subject.  And to top it all off, a good cinematographer knows that in a night scene, backlight is your friend, and contrast on the subject helps sell it. See how Hathaway's well lit and exposed properly but still has strong backlight. The grab you posted is basically just pointing a light at the subject and not shaping it much at all.  None of that means this shot is bad. Like I said, this would absolutely play in a feature film. It just needs the right context.  So until you give us a context of what you're trying to achieve, no one can help guide you there."

(In the original post there's a link to the entire video.)"
cinematography,37e00i,RollerDerby88,2,Wed May 27 07:03:26 2015 UTC,"Let's try to get away from this word ""cinematic,"" because it doesn't really mean much. Anything can be cinematic in the right context.  So why exactly do you feel the lens is too wide, and why do you think a longer lens will help the look or feel you're going for? I don't think the image grab you posted has any significant distortion or anything on the subject from being too wide, so really a longer lens would just be blowing out more of the background.  That's a valid option if you want to go for it, but I don't think there's anything particularly more cinematic about doing that. Matter of fact, I seem to recall Deakins prefers to shoot close-ups in wider lenses. He feels it gives more ""presence"" to the subject. It's just a style preference."
cinematography,37e00i,LittleMizz,1 point,Wed May 27 17:39:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know, it's just that (maybe it's a personal sensation) motion pictures appear to me to be more flat, like the faces are not that deep as they would be if I shoot with a 35mm on a DSLR.

cinematography,37e00i,Berxs,1 point,Wed May 27 18:01:19 2015 UTC,"Longer lenses can have a ""flattening"" effect, sure (though really it's just changing the field of view, but that's a different conversation). But I don't think that particularly has anything to do with ""motion pictures"" or not. If that's your preference for style, that's cool. But I don't think it objectively makes a shot better or less amateur.  In fact, many fantastic cinematographers love getting faces to pop a little more, as they believe it adds depth and helps with the immersion.  Really, I think you're just stuck on this one point for some reason. It doesn't have anything to do with making a scene look better, it's just a style preference. I don't think focal length is really relevant to your post."

Instead of adding more lights, try taking away. Once you're at a decent starting point (say the setup you have now), try scrimming down a light, flag off some spill from the background, create dark areas, walk your key light upstage and make it more sidey, use less fill, create contrast, hell try turning off a light. Whatever you do don't be afraid of the dark. You don't need a dozen lights to look professional, if the shot looks great with 2.

But hey, if that wasn't ""cinematic-looking"" enough for you, then nothing will be. The craft is all in the lighting and final grade.

There's no value or color contrast between her and the background. There's little of interest in the background, it's empty and boring and fully lit. There could be shadows falling across it to give it more interest and frame her better, or it should just fall completely into shadow so she pops off of it. She needs a better key angle motivated by a street lamp spotlighting her face and a nice kicker from the moon or backlight from another street lamp."

The A7S doesn't record 4k internally, you have to go through the Shogun recorder.   A Metabones Speedbooster doesn't cover the entire full frame sensor and won't allow you to shoot 4K with a Shogun, but like you said, it'll work in APS-C but crop your image. It also reduces the rolling shutter with the A7S quite a bit. I can't comment on the lowlight performance compared to full frame though.  edit: Actually, I'll have to double check on what lenses work at 4k full frame with the A7S. I work in a camera rental house and I know we've rented out the A7S with a Fujinon Cabrio (PL Mount) with the Atomos Shogun for the client to shoot at 4K and he seemed happy with the results, though I can't remember if he shot APS-C."

Personally I've been using light panels because they travel so easy and road rags if I need it for negative fill.  2 1x1s half power diffused looks good for most small interviews and I go bigger for bigger projects so i might try this then.   Bounced light is always pleasing.
cinematography,37cz5j,clintbyrne,1 point,Wed May 27 05:31:27 2015 UTC,"If I was going to improvise with your 1x1 panels then I'd put them side by side to make a bigger—and therefore softer—source.  A trick I did with a friend's Diva light was to clip grid cloth to the top door of the light, open up the bottom door and let the cloth just hang. That made the light source even bigger and softer.  You might be able to do the same thing: tip your panels forward, clip some heavy diffusion (grid cloth or sail cloth—same thing, easy to buy at any fabric store) to the top of the fixtures as they sit side by side, and let the cloth hang. You could even separate the lights horizontally and let the cloth hang across, making an even bigger source.  I've found that a 4'x4' source 2-4' from the side of the face makes just about anyone look great. The closer you can get to that, the better. And leave some shadow on the fill side—that adds shape and definition to the face and makes it feel three dimensional. Use a bounce card for a little fill if needed."

I suspect you're speculating about their customer base from general impressions rather than speaking from experience and you're quite far off the mark.   As a BM customer I think you couldn't be any further from the truth about their relationship with customers. If anything, their customer base has an abnormally close relationship with them.  Literally. You won't find another camera manufacturer who's user base contacts them directly, frequents their site's forums and is generally as engaged with the manufactures activity other than perhaps RED.   They're a young to camera manufacturing and work unconventionally to compete. But their customer base pretty much embraces this. Compared to Canon or Sony, their response to existing user needs is impressive, and each year they've honed in further on what their customers want and how they want it.  Outside of their customer base, people still associate them with the cock-ups they made with their early releases but those days are long gone."
cinematography,3786qp,HardCoreLawn,2,Mon May 25 20:03:15 2015 UTC,"Hey, you've made some fair points. But you're also still holding their early cock-ups against them which is kinda pointless.   I know a few guys who've sent back their BM cameras due to faults (hot pixels, screen problems) and got replacements fairly promptly without BS. Good old insurance looks after out of warranty problems.  Of course other companies have better delivery times/ customer care. How in the world would you expect them to deliver products with comparably high performance AS WELL AS a comparable level of customer support to an established billion dollar corporation but for a tenth of the price?   BM products aren't for everyone. Just like Arri aren't. If you're looking for a lot of customer care then the newest, smallest, and lowest budget manufacturer on the market OBVIOUSLY won't be what you're looking for. You probably would be happiest with Canon. But they make a point not to price their products competitively because $15K per camera isn't an issue for their user base. And they'll happily hold back features from their lower priced products to maintain value in their price structure.   BM are clearly flawed and punched well above their weight with their first three cameras but they've polished up a lot of the rough edges on them. Their software updates make them fairly user friendly cameras now and they've delivered on the ""potential"" these early cameras promised. And with their ursa mini 4.6k they look like they've utterly nailed it.  I get how guys in the industry for decades would be vexed at how today shooters get a 4K camera for the price of two 16mm rolls, an LED light, vimeo pro account and think they're Roger Deakins.

What I was contesting is your claim that it the same size and even heavier then the BMPCC which is flat out incorrect. Sure slap a giant lens on there and its much bigger but the same can be said about any camera without a fixed lens.   However your claim that there is no gimbal suited for the phantom is totally false, the H3-2D/3D was developed almost specifically for the phantom. As for the BM Micro, of course there is not mount or gimbal for it, its not even available to buy yet.   I actually own a phantom, in fact I own several and my phantom fly's fine with dual batteries, a gopro with a 3 axis gimbal, FPV camera and transmitter. Its a bit sluggish and my flight times are shorter but it flies and handles fine. Again, no one would actually put one of these on a phantom, however with a cheap plastic pancake lens, and no gimbal, it would absolutely be possible.   but lets get to the real discussion here, it's just an ad, designed to get people excited about a product.

At first glance it pops nicely, but... overall there's not much color discrimination. There's little to no separation between similar hues. The colors themselves are very saturated, but all the yellows look much the same, as do the reds.  At :20 there's a shot inside a cafe looking out toward the street. There are three red cars parked on the opposite side of the street. They are all basically the same hue of red. That NEVER happens. Car colors are always subtly different, either slightly blueish-red or orange-ish red, and these are all basically the same hue of red. That's not right.  Also, what's with the reflected highlights? They look really odd.  The footage overall appears to be graded very warm, or maybe that's just the way their color science skews color. Flesh tones are warm to a fault: they're very yellow, which means there's some extra green mixed in. It's a very warm look, much like Canon although not quite as sexy.  All the exteriors look like they were shot at sunset, with rich sunset color—but it's clearly a grading thing.  It's certainly the best Blackmagic footage I've seen so far. I'm curious as to what the camera really looks like, though. It's almost impossible to tell from marketing footage."
cinematography,3786qp,ArtAdamsDP,8,Tue May 26 07:12:40 2015 UTC,"meh. Looks like regular footage. Hard to tell what 4.6K did better. Looks like they were shooting on soft glass too, so its even harder to find differences between 1080p and 4K quality. Also, the camerawork could have been tons better for a camera demo."
cinematography,3786qp,C47man,7,Tue May 26 16:27:50 2015 UTC,Thats not resolution... That's dynamic range
cinematography,3786qp,C47man,1 point,Tue May 26 16:11:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, though I think they're using off the shelf sensors. So as awesome as it would be for them to say ""Okay, we're keeping UHD max res, at 200FPS and 15 stops"" I think they're limited to what they can buy.  One thing I would LOVE to see is a cam that prioritized speed. A 1080P, 500FPS, 11-stop DR camera would be perfect for miniatures."
cinematography,3786qp,AndyJarosz,1 point,Mon May 25 18:07:54 2015 UTC,I read around NAB that all the sensors they have used up to this new URSA sensor have been off the shelf but this new sensor has been designed specifically for/with BlackMagic by a company.

cinematography,37au5o,D1r3ctor,1 point,Tue May 26 08:37:50 2015 UTC,It's raw footage and I am not the DP for this. I just thought I could put this out there to see if anyone would like it but I guess that is not the case.
cinematography,37au5o,shibby182,3,Tue May 26 23:28:33 2015 UTC,"How great it is depends on if it tells the story effectively and also I guess on a technical and artistic level if it is pleasing to the eye. I understand the concept you were going for (I believe), backlit and everything, smoke in the room. But this is amatuerish. I'm sorry and I don't mean to be disheartening. Keep trying and experimenting, but maybe the mystery of the character/yourself could be more enhance by using a telephoto lens to remove him from the light. Seeing the light itself is distracting and feels cheap (especially with hyper sensitive sharpness/focal distance on digital, which I'm assuming this is shot on since it looks like it). I don't know if this is graded but the contrast / fill on his hands etc should be higher as we need to personify him more. The figure is dropping off into the background and that's a cardinal sin when working with silhouettes. You always need to identify the entire silhouette properly. I advise if you don't look at art books or photography or anything else just to surf tumblr. Even artistic porn tumblr's if you must. And you'll contrast of background to silhouettes and how people use it. It's all far to dark, even if the scene is meant to be. I've shot a lot of things and may pat myself on the back here and there, but the way I see it is everything I shot today is shit compared to what I shoot tomorrow because it'll be better. But you have to do research and also not into actually photography but theory of photography and theory of shapes and colours and contrasts. It'll be important in the long run. It's why they call it The academy of motion pictures and science. Because there's a mental science as well as the obvious physical one when it comes to using a camera."

You didn't specify anything aside this being ""Italy, as you've never seen it before"". And guess what, I haven't... It was really interesting for me. More on the border or docu-realism and video art than anything, but that's good, the sound also enhances that dramatically instead of using some ambient/prog rock kind of music.  It's very Roy Anderson without the cynicism and satire, Malickesque, yes, given that it has nature in the shots, but, hardly any camera movement, not very Makick.  I can see that you know what your doing!! Purely from the shot of the bottle in the water, your movement only reacting to the movement in frame is a nice touch, and something you rarely see outside of a narrative situation.  Sounds like I'm the one taking this too seriously now but, from what you gave in the title and description, you didn't disappoint, what more can anyone else ask for... Really?   /u/acksack is wrong frankly, just because he couldn't tolerate nothingness doesn't mean this isn't good... And reliant on technology!!! What are you talking about?

I didn't want to say too much because I feel there is no way to prepare someone for a video like this. I understand that this approach may disappoint some, but the fact you got some thing out of it makes it all worth it.  I haven't seen anything from Roy Anderson, but I'll have to check him out. My main inspiration was Leviathan, a documentary that puts on an Alaskan fishing boat. When watching the documentary, I found that the long takes allowed my mind to wonder and interpret the film in my own way. I'm curious whether you felt that type of experience while watching this video?  Again thanks for sharing your opinion, I appreciate it."

They do evoke a certain feeling (when accompanied by the audio) However I think you are taking your self too seriously, and not using what you have to it's full potential. I am guilty of this, many times. It is easy to put static shots with decent framing (taken with a nice camera) next to great ambient audio, or in my case music. It just doesn't warrant you saying your video needs to be listened to a certain way. It reminded me of the opening to the tree of life, only with no pay off."

If you have reached a point in your career that you can shoot your art and not worry, then yes of course.  If on the other hand you need to actually make a living, then if they tell you to shove a lens up your ass and shoot that way, charge extra.  This is true even to the point that the extreme inertia companies (Arri and Canon) are offering 4k for professional uses. NAB this year was the year of 8k in future cameras, especially studio cameras.  Whether we like it or not, choosing to ignore the realities of resolution in this industry will only make you worthless. You need the experience now on 4k to be able to work tomorrow. Soon you will need experience with 6k, then 8."

cinematography,379lyk,jonathan_92,1 point,Tue May 26 02:23:18 2015 UTC,Most would agree with you in terms of preferring a camera that does a better job with DR than resolution. The only reason resolution has been the main talking point these last 5-6 years is because people have been very passive in letting Red's marketing team shift the conversation. Their cameras have never been the strongest in DR and color science so they've relied on convincing beginners that resolution is the most important aspect of a camera. There will come a point though when people realize our eyes aren't capable of seeing past a certain resolution and hopefully that's when the conversation shifts back to which camera is the best complete package.
cinematography,379lyk,BIkerAC,1 point,Tue May 26 07:36:00 2015 UTC,"For the most part, a company will focus on what makes the most ROI.  Say, building your $50k camera costs them $20k in R&D and overhead, for $30k profit per unit sold.  Nice.  Versus a BM/Sony whatever with generic tech that costs $1k and sells for $4k.  However, the $4k camera is ""affordable"" in the pop consumer market, so they sell 100+ cameras for every 1 expensive camera.  They make 10x as much with the cheaper tech camera, with much lower risk. And they'll make even more selling accessories.  The $50k+ market is also a tweener market.  They'll skip the fickle $50k consumers to focus the production market that can afford $100k+ cameras."

cinematography,3749ze,photonnymous,1 point,Mon May 25 05:24:48 2015 UTC,"Rev head (revolution head with camera inside) is close to the ground. It keeps the horizon locked no matter where the camera is. Stedicam arm is extra long to compensate for the added weight and to allow full 360 degree rotation to maximize the rev head effectiveness. Also, the operator is using a back-mounted Stedicam arm/vest combo, which adds to it looking bigger than other rigs."

Never had that with any steadycam yet."
cinematography,3749ze,Zushii,1 point,Mon May 25 16:40:04 2015 UTC,"I'm sure the length assisted in keeping the camera as stable as possible in that position. The longer the pole, the more inertia the overall contraption has. It's also more resistant to wind as there is more surface area for the force to be distributed."
cinematography,3749ze,TheAmigops,5,Sun May 24 19:30:10 2015 UTC,"The length is for high and low angles and the cage around the camera works like a gimbal, keeping the camera horizon level while boomed off to the side or in 'low mode' like in the photo.  You can create shots that start at ground level with the sled upside down and then rotate up to high mode without ever losing your horizon."
cinematography,374985,ishouldknowtheanswer,35,Sun May 24 19:04:44 2015 UTC,"All that makes the camera ready to work in a demanding environment where minutes equal thousands of dollars. The do-dads make it easier to pull focus, potentially make it more mobile (all the wireless stuff means you don't have to be right up on the camera to control it), and the lockit box makes it much easier for post, knowing timecode will undoubtedly sync up with audio.   So, long story short: not necessary, but extremely helpful."
cinematography,374985,d_russ,29,Sun May 24 19:32:32 2015 UTC,"Not necessary, but extremely helpful.    The more I build my kit and learn more about filmmaking in general, the more I realize that this statement sums up almost every piece of equipment. I started with a Canon 60D and one shit lens, and made some decently passable material. I figured getting more gear would make my videos better, and for a while every time I made a purchase I'd think ""Now that I have this mic/monitor/rig/lens my content will look so much more professional!""

cinematography,374985,fs454,7,Sun May 24 19:16:16 2015 UTC,"It really does boil down to how much time is worth on a set. We just did a $100k music video with an Alexa rigged up like that, and at the end of the day sure you'll get the same ""image quality"" out of a bare camera, all of that stuff helps an entire team get involved to be able to pull off the whole video in one shoot day. Skimp on camera package and shoot over two days and your costs balloon astronomically or your ability to pull cool stuff off is halved due to budgetary concerns.   For example, the video in question that I recently codirected: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjWHpTkH7pA  In this business (especially music videos) you're tasked with writing videos for music with a wildly open creative. In order to get the job, you need to think outside the box and perhaps bring some innovative stuff to the table that isn't necessarily easy to pull off. Like at 1:15, our talent rides on a bed as it travels through a space full of frozen people. Each individual setup takes a LOT of time to arrange, and without all of that extra gear, you've got a bare camera that only one person can operate, and a client confused as to why they don't have a video village to watch playback at.   Here's a couple BTS photos I took while on set. Since the camera had to be high, and traveling down 100+ feet of dolly track, we have the DP and the AC below, with a monitor for each of them mounted eye-level instead of 8 feet in the air, and then a Teradek Bolt transmitting video to a client monitor and a director's monitor so that everyone's watching and can make notes and comments as it happens. Focus is being pulled wirelessly as the camera is multiple feet above, etc. You're gaining immense time savings in the workflow on set.   Since Bea is under 18, we had her for around 8 hours, and we finished with literally seconds to spare. Without the gear? Sure the image would be the same, but there would be a hell of a lot less of said image, focus would be spottier, the client wouldn't have had their say(which hurts in post!), and we wouldn't have a complete video."
cinematography,374985,d_russ,4,Mon May 25 05:44:03 2015 UTC,"Yes. Unless some of those SDI cables are going to an external recorder, in which case you can get Sony raw, which is of greater bitrate, and I believe greater color bit-depth as well.   If that were the case (and that's pretty likely on a shoot like this), then at least one or two of those gizmos does improve image quality.   Edit: changed Arriraw to Sony raw"
cinematography,374985,markDOP,2,Sun May 24 19:36:48 2015 UTC,They are shooting on the Sony F65 so the external recorder is on the back some what permanently without needing to be connected via a BNC Cable etc.  Unless there is an additional external recorder just for backup or for capturing Proxies I don't think there are any other 'gizmos' on the camera that are increasing image quality as they are shooting SONY RAW (source: imdb page for 'Tomorrowland')

Every accessory has cables and there are a ton of different configurations depending on what you have to do. AC's can put on a Sniper to help judge distance, that's 2 small items and a few cables. A FIZ, which has 3 cables for motors, 1 power cable, and more cables if you are passing through any metadata or wanting to start/stop the camera remotely. Powering all of these takes some sort of power distribution box, which may not be built into the camera. Then you have genlock boxes, wireless video transmission, maybe 2 monitors, maybe a video D.A. and maybe an external recorder. All the hardware to rig this stuff takes up space too. Just keep the operator's side clean and neat, that's the important side. You should see a 3D camera. Multiply everything by 2."
cinematography,374985,lockmon,2,Sun May 24 23:32:56 2015 UTC,What the other person said. Recording to a recorder lets you shoot raw and higher bit rate and the rest is in service to a better image. More or less if camera was stripped naked it could take some image but it would be harder to do so!
cinematography,374985,groovybrent,6,Sun May 24 21:07:21 2015 UTC,"Here's what I can identify - none of which actually affect the image quality of the camera - but all have their purposes.  There is a Teradek Bolt wireless transmitter - Because it is a Bolt (""zero delay""), it is probably for the AC who is wirelessly pulling focus.  Then I see something that looks like the Lockit TC/Sync Generator for making sure the video from the camera and the audio from the sound department stay in perfect sync.  I can't identify the brands, but I see motors and wireless receiver for focus/zoom/iris.  I'm sure there is some sort of recording device on the camera, but it doesn't look like any of the CODEX boxes, nor does it look like Sony's Cinealta recorder.  There is one more box that I can't identify what it might be.  Behind the wireless receiver - we see 4 (probably) LEMO wires coming out of it - so maybe it's a power distribution station?  Something similar to this one by Laird?  So you're correct - nothing will make the picture going in to the camera look any better, but on a decent-sized production, it's all there for a reason."
cinematography,374985,JackFuckingBauerKTA,5,Sun May 24 20:02:06 2015 UTC,"The small box behind the motors is the cine tape display. Above that is the Preston MDR, the brain of the wireless focus iris zoom (FIZ) unit. The camera is from Keslow, and those 4-5 cables that are plugged in vertically are plugged into their proprietary distro box."
cinematography,374985,sonofaresiii,3,Sun May 24 21:10:25 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, you're asking if that stuff affects image quality, and everyone's saying no...  except, it kind of does.  Does it actually change what the sensor's reading? Well, no. But all that stuff makes your life easier, the operator's life easier, the ac's life easier... and it makes all their jobs easier, which means fewer mistakes, which means more time for other work, which means...  better image quality. Not to mention stuff like a wireless ff, which means you can make different images and keep them in focus than if you had to have a hand on it.  So yeah, I always tend to look at this stuff as increasing image quality. If it lets me do my work (or anyone's work) better, easier, or faster, it means a better image at somewhere along the line."

When a producer is trying to get me to justify an expense that seemingly just makes someone's job easier, I try to frame it as how it benefits the production overall.   Sometimes this means more time to light or choreograph shots. Sometimes it means more takes for the director to get the one they want. Sometimes it means less overtime, which means more money spent on awesome explosions."

That being said, your camera doesn't have to look like a monster, some clever cable management and properly mounted accessories can make it look more appealing.  Necessary accessories I use are:    Operators Monitor (Usually Small HD DP7 High-bright LCD) Preston G4 MDR 3 Ward Sniper (superior to Cinetape) Paralynx Tomahawk or Arrow-X   That's all I need to shoot in a professional environment for 15+ hours if necessary.  I'd take that gear from the biggest features to any TV show.   I also choose to lose Alexa BP9 and Euro Plate and side-mount one rod for motors and just use a ronford baker quick release for mounting.  Keep it neat and low profile and it's much easier to manage."
cinematography,374985,ArtAdamsDP,2,Sun May 24 21:46:36 2015 UTC,"All that stuff affects image quality.  The shot is of two kids acting. There are laws that limit how long you can work kids on a set. Kids themselves have only so much patience before they melt down and their performances suffer. If the shoot day is ambitious then the crew can spend more time getting better shots than wrangling cables, etc.  The CineTape means the assistant has a better chance at nailing focus every time with few or no rehearsals as sometimes you only get one good take with kids. The wireless video transmitter means the director can see what he/she is getting without cables getting in the way, which means getting shots set up faster while having a little more time to light and get more shots in a day. The wireless follow focus keeps the assistant away from the camera and in a position where they can judge focus more easily (probably off to one side where they can better see the relationship between the kids and the camera). The Lockit box means things are easier to sync in post if you're running two cameras at the same time, which they may be—and, if you're in a hurry, you can roll both cameras without banging a slate and get them quickly in sync later. (This helps when the kids are delivering better performances in rehearsal than when the camera is rolling. You just tell them you're rehearsing and then surreptitiously roll both cameras.)  Could you do what needs to be done without all that stuff? Yes. Will you be able to do it as quickly and with the same amount of money? No. All of that stuff is there to guarantee that every take is as good as it can be cinematographically. If it wasn't necessary, trust me: producers wouldn't pay for it. They know that all that stuff, while pricey, is less expensive than not getting the shots that they need."

cinematography,375tcg,NAKED_INTERNET_MAN,5,Sat Jun 20 17:21:13 2015 UTC,"You have major interlacing artifacts throughout, plus pillar bars which says to me this was run through a DV codec at some point. You need to fix that ASAP.  Ignoring that, you've got a nice mix of shots but I'd cut the reel in half; you've only got a small number of projects in there and after the first 60 seconds I'm starting to see the same things over and over.  You'd got framing that is either classically faulty or is deliberately off-kilter in some sections, but without the context of the film it's impossible to tell which is the case, so either reframe it for the reel or cut it, or show more context so we can tell it's deliberate and serves a story.  Ask yourself this question when selecting shots/sequences for the reel - what will someone who's never met me nor seen the work this is from assume about my abilities as they are watching this?"
cinematography,375tcg,LaunchAllVipers,2,Mon May 25 04:31:51 2015 UTC,"I did not pay attention to the artifacts, yes I saw them but I don't expect a dp to have editing skills. Importantly this means I am not looking at the acting or the makeup or to direction or anything except the cinematography.  What I see is a lot of filler shots. Try it for yourself. Pause and click to a random frame.  I clicked at 0:51. Unbalanced structure to the frame. He is closer to center than the thirds line, she is further from center. Looking up at them. The problem is that is doesn't express anything. What is this shot saying? Am I supposed to focus on the burned out bulb in the middle of the screen? The semilit building in the back is a bit distracting. But really the shit doesn't say anything. Just to be sure I did play to the end of the shot, no resolution to the not saying anything.  1:21. Orange hair left, hands to face. This one looks like it is saying something, but not much. He clearly looks happy about something in front of him about at camera feet. Visual structure is good slightly weighted left drawing the eye to him. She is isolated with open air in front of her giving her room to move forward. Playing the scene out though doesn't resolve his happy. Instead the shot ends unbalanced with him in hard focus, her in soft focus.   2:00 looks like I chose the wrong frame. Just some out of focus hair. Happens, trying again.  0:11. Good beginning. Although he has a window sticking out of his head. Twin light orbs at edges is nice. Structurally it communicates that he is traveling to center, like he is about to have resolution. Rewinding a couple seconds to see, nope one of the first frames of the shot, no tension point established. And no tension resolution to the shot, ends very quickly.  0:12 since I'm here already. Black woman with baby on white wall. Her acting is carrying some tenderness, but the shot really isn't establishing any characteristic to her. There is no point of tension, no umph to it. Also the angle makes one of her braids look far shorter than the other. For an image that I would expect to be capturing the beauty of a mother caressing her child it simply carries no weight. The child is neither a dominating force nor a diminished force in the image.   Your reel should not just show that you can adequately press record, your job as a cinematographer is to capture the emotion. Show me the emotional force of the dance, this isn't just two people interacting its an act of love, of passion, or a deadly dance of a black widow reeling in her prey. Don't just show me a woman holding a baby, show me that her baby is her life, or show me that soon she will dread the very concept."

You don't need to edit so closely to the music. First, because that's kind of weird. The music should fit the reel, but it shouldn't match it exactly like that. But second, and more importantly, you don't actually stay on shots long enough for me to look at them and tell if they're any good. At first I thought this was because you knew you made a lot of mistakes and wanted to hide them, but it became obvious you're just trying to make your reel into a music video. Fight that urge. Use longer takes. A little editing to the music can be powerful, but this is a bit much."

Usually a couple stops down will give you the best qualities of the lens, but there are always other factors at play.  Hanging on to a preference is probably not a good idea.

Those get changed depending on need, but without strong need they stay where my preference is.  With f stop it works the other way. It changes so frequently there's not even q common or best preference. It's a little like asking what your favorite color palette is. Impossible to answer because it can only be determined by the project. No one can say green is better than blue, just like no one can say f4 is better than f2.8"

cinematography,373vwn,sonofaresiii,5,Sun May 24 18:43:40 2015 UTC,"I'll often shoot at T4, which is pretty easy these days as the cameras are so fast. I try not to shoot wider than T2.8 as that's where things start getting hairy for camera assistants. I'll shoot at T2 occasionally, if I have to or if I need to throw a background out of focus.  I try never to shoot at T1.4. The low contrast of the lens at that stop is a great look for lighting but it's nearly impossible to get anything sharp, plus the lens itself is noticeably softer. I've never seen a lens that was really sharp at T1.4.  These days most primes look their best closed down 1 stop from wide open. Older primes and zooms look their best closed down about two stops.  I just shot a three camera interview where the zoom (at around 175mm) was at T4 +1/2, the slider/profile camera was at T2.8 +1/2 on a 50mm, and the wide shot was a 75mm backed way off at T2 +1/2. That way I had enough depth of field on the zoom to keep the subject's face reasonably sharp, the slider camera didn't have to pull focus hardly at all while keeping the background a bit soft, and the wide shot's depth of field was consistent with the others."

cinematography,373vwn,ArtAdamsDP,2,Mon May 25 01:32:34 2015 UTC,Depends on the situation but I enjoy an f4 if I have enough lights or ND. It makes pulling a lot easier on your 1st AC compared to a 1.4 as well. Less retakes for focus speeds things up a lot!

The next best option would be the a5100 from sony and their aps-c glass. i am personally moving to sony from nikon since sony has the whole range from low end with the a5100 and high end with their fs7, this means i can buy cheap camera now and expand on the expensive glass as the years go by but with the opportunity of upgrading to an fs7 or respective model in about 5 years. also, an aps-c sensor has much better low light performance and shallower dof (as of this moment, it might change in the coming years). either way, goodluck."

cinematography,36vzps,misternils,2,Fri May 22 23:38:44 2015 UTC,"I found it to make a huge difference on any black magic camera sensor (you basically can't retain highlights at 400 on a BMPCC, you really need to push higher and throw ND on).   As for grain pattern, you would not notice a difference on the Alexa at 400/800/1250. And if you're doing VFX, it's probably going to be degrained anyway."
cinematography,36vzps,shotgunwizard,2,Sat May 23 01:12:33 2015 UTC,"If you're shooting with a camera like the red or alexa changing the ISO doesn't actually change the base image, it just effects how the LUT applies to the image.   As as a result if you're shooting a dark scene you want to keep the information higher in the curve as the information is cleaner there. Shooting at a low ISO forces you to put more light into the sensor this gaining a cleaner image.   Conversely, when shooting day exteriors you need to protect your highlights to prevent hotspots of daylight blowing out, and setting your ISO high forces you to do that.   These are only general guides to protect you from an unfamiliar camera though, once you've taken the footage through color correction a few times you'll know better what you can get away with."

There's also the Alexa regular which doesn't have raw and still rents, the Amira which shoots 4444, and now the mini.   The last feature (indie, under a million) I worked on used 2x AlexaXTs, but we opted for ProRes because shooting RAW would have spiked our HD budget by more than double. And that means the editor and colorist need double the space as well. Having RAW seems like a good idea in theory, but it affects the entire process (especially at 4MB per frame)."

I guess I am not there yet but for me it just seemed like if you had the budget to shoot on an alexa then you automatically had the budget to shoot raw as well. I guess not.

General consensos is Arriraw is good for keeping a clean image at high ISO or pushing the image.  It also allows you to easily correct goofs, like wrong WB.

cinematography,36vzps,shotgunwizard,1 point,Sat May 23 02:14:49 2015 UTC,Look at this chart: http://artbyphil.com/phfx/red/dragon/images/phfx_redDragon_ISOExamples.jpg  Notice how you gain more details in the shadows and less details in the highlights the higher your ISO is.
cinematography,36vzps,JointOperationsCente,0,Sat May 23 09:25:00 2015 UTC,"What the tutorial probably meant was, as you take your camera above its native iso rating, your latitude shifts towards having more highlight latitude. Going under gives you more shadow latitude. In theory. But the less latitude, the more likely things will crush to black, or blow out pure white.  This works differently depending on the camera. Most cameras lose latitude when exposed above or below their native iso. Some of my blackmagic tests (8 under, 5 over @800) indicate a loss of about a stop or more when exposed at 400, but then little to no loss at 1600. By contrast, arri alexa's don't lose any latitude when iso is changed, it's just shifted up and down the exposure scale. In stead of 7 over and under at 800, I saw a test that showed that 1600 gave you 8 over and 6 under, plus an increase in noise. If you look at the latitude of a common film stock like kodak 500T, it's about 8 over and 5 under... So that's pretty similar to an alexa exposed to 1600!  TLDR: The theory really only holds up with high end cameras. Cheaper cameras start acting funky when you expose above or below their native iso rating."

cinematography,36spe8,inroth,3,Thu May 21 20:29:09 2015 UTC,"First thing I notice is that a lot of shots are out of focus. You have to nail that focus. You have to.  When lighting and composing shots, remember that your subject isn't the only important thing. The background is just as important. There's a lot of shots where there are cords laying on the ground and it looks messy. When shooting, the way your space appears is important. Also, pay attention to the way lights appear on the walls and background. For example, the shot of the drummer at 1:03, which is used a lot, the light on the wall looks kinda bad IMO because it isn't meant to look good.  I'm not a fan of the way the drummer is lit. A different color of light can be done well, but usually more as a hair light or highlight, not mixed half with another light. Also, not a fan of the drums being lit like they are, the focus is the drummer and the pipes for the drums are way too complicated and just look like a mess the way they are lit.  You should try and always light people from above, otherwise it gives them weird shadows. It can look good, but it takes time to learn what you can do and what you can't, try to stick to some fairly simple setups in the beginning. They don't have to be boring, just simple. It seems like you were trying to go for a kinda harsh, grungy lighting style which was the right choice, but your lights seem a little random still, when placing your lights, have someone stand and do some things your talent will do so you can see what it looks like when moving lights.  The editing is good, but I think your edits are a little too fast. A lot of cuts are just a little to fast to tell what's going on for someone watching it the first time.   I just said a lot of negative stuff, yes, however, your video is actually pretty good. Overall, I liked it and thought you did a great job for your first time. There are several shots in there that were well done and looked good. I really liked that scene with the 4 different clips side by side. Each of those shots looked good and they it worked really well.   You should be proud of this as your first project. Work on those things I suggested, get lots of practice and in a year (probably less) you'll come back and think this is terrible. That's a good thing though, it means you're getting better.

Of course S35 won't be GONE GONE in 5 years. But all the new professional cameras coming out will be shooting on VV sensors or larger. Look at the Alexa 65, the 5Ds, the Red Weapon 8K, everyone shooting on IMAX etc. Plus Panavision's Primo V lenses that cover 70mm, and most of the still lenses in the world are Full Frame.   I don't think it's delusional to think this, especially when only a few years ago everything was 3x 1/4"" CCDs and everyone thought S35 digital sensors were too big and delusional. People used to think 4K was overkill, it's quickly becoming standard. Now they're saying the same thing about 8k.  Just look at this Angenieux above for example! It's a 24-290. They realized it only covers S35 sensors and have now started rehousing them to cover larger sensors so they don't vignette, and that's only because of the introduction of the 5K epic sensor. What do you think is going to happen once Arri, Panavision, and IMAX come out with their new large format cameras?"

I'm a student but most of what I've learned in classes is film theory/history instead of production. I've learned a good deal of technical stuff on set (mainly what works and what doesn't, and what sort of lighting and lensing will help shape your overall style), but most of my time has honestly been looking at things online.   Stills have been huge in guiding research for me, especially on movies that have supplemental material online, like American Cinematographer articles or something. Sure they don't demonstrate motion, but there is still an incredible about to be gleaned from a single image as far as creating a mood/feeling of some kind.  But yeah, biggest advice I'd say (note: speaking from experience, but there are plenty on here that have done this a lot longer than I have) is do the research, a ton of it, find what you like, pick apart exactly why you like it, and when the opportunities come (don't force anything), apply it. Over time you find a good rhythm with what works for a project and things start to feel really cohesive. Hope that helps!"

It's a dinosaur of a camera, both in relative age to the history of pro digital cameras and in size, but in the end, it makes a great image. Colors are definitely a bit, err, enhanced on it (can be good or bad), it's notoriously bad at handling tungsten light relative to newer cameras, and its low light capabilities are a pain (I generally avoid ISO 800 to keep flexibility in post), but yeah, still a great picture and a great post workflow.  All that being said, working with the Scarlet Dragon was fantastic. Light, fast, stupid high latitude. Would love to work with it again and hopefully try the Sony F55/F65 or Arri Alexa/Amira in the future as well."

cinematography,36g5mc,acksack,2,Wed May 20 00:41:29 2015 UTC,One way to detect focal length is to look at parallax. This only works with a moving frame however.

cinematography,36e68t,from-the-ground-up,8,Tue May 19 03:08:55 2015 UTC,"As a sound guy this is one of those things that I understand (but never do myself).  There are times where an actor practically whispers a line in a loud location and it's useless.   The proper answer is to pass the request up the chain of command and let them decide what to do with the information.   Which brings me to the biggest set protocol item for me, which is everything following the chain of command.  So many other sloppy parts are derivatives of not doing this.  I really can't think of any that I don't care for off the top of my head.  Everything is there for a reason.  The jargon can be dumb but you pick up on it pretty fast."

I've heard a few variations since, but when I started out I knew the people I was working with would have no idea what that meant. So I started shouting ""watch your eyes!"" anytime I'd turn on a light that's pointed at people.   To which they'd all respond, of course, by looking directly at me, and the light, as I was turning it on."
cinematography,36e68t,GlenNevis,1 point,Tue May 19 02:39:04 2015 UTC,"Round where I'm from it's ""sparking"" most commonly. I prefer it to ""watch your eyes"" which isn't specific to a task really, it could mean many things. Spark (or striking in your case) is one of the most common film etiquette tidbits and usually one of the first that people learn, so I think people understand it or catch on pretty quick.  And people always DO look when you call it out. Hence why I start with barn doors closed completely on the lamp, unless for some reason that's not possible, and I'll just throw a gloved hand in front to cover it as much as I can. Then call it, then count to 3 or 4, then spark up. even if someone is still looking at me by then, the light isn't at max blast due to the barn doors/my hand."

If you're shooting an exterior heavy picture, and the camera needs to travel a couple hundred yards on foot... Either de-lens or put that damned cap on!  That and if the camera needs to sit idle outside for a while, without having put the lens back on to make it ready to roll.   If the lens needs to travel a decent distance to the first ac, i either move the lens case closer to the set up, or walk with at least the rear element capped, making sure to remove it before i deliver it. Believe it or not, unobservant crew from other departments can and will blunder into you from literally no where, even when you're announcing yourself. Weaving in and out of crew on a tight and fast set without caps can be dangerous.   But for the love of god, don't deliver it to the first with caps, and they had better make it back into the case!

This is substantially less important on a union set but on non-union shoots where people from god knows what industry are standing around under a 40ft jib arm or talking on their cell phone 6"" away from the back of an 18K, the half a breath of notification helps with the knots in my shoulders.

It is the starting point for efficiency and professionalism that is expected when you make a career out of film-making.   Here is a simple example. When you use tape you put a tab at the end of it because it is efficient when you need to remove it from whatever surface you stuck it on. The simple tape tab is also courteous to those that might come after you and need to remove the tape. Therefore putting tabs on your tape is an efficient professional courtesy. If you don't put tabs on your tape then you should expect to be shamed for it in front of your co-workers."

cinematography,36c2yo,smegasaurus,3,Mon May 18 23:23:21 2015 UTC,Stage lights. Or PAR Cans. Frensels would cost way more. You want the ones with the long snoot. Otherwise the lights just going  all over the place.
cinematography,36c2yo,Zushii,4,Mon May 18 17:29:39 2015 UTC,"Actually, theatre fresnels do not cost that much more. They pop up on UsedLighting.com all the time and I actually picked up 2x 1Kw Strand Fresnels for <$100 each and I've been using them along with my newer TrueBlues for a while now. Other than the fact that they're size inefficient and a little bit of a pain in the ass to carry around, they're great lights! They can be lamped down to 750w or kept at 1000w, and once converted to Edison plugs, I had no problems operating them. I've used them to shoot local celebrities and some major doc films without any complaint from DPs, electrics, or clients.   That being said, I would definitely recommend starting with a few PAR64s. They're the most basic lighting instrument and can be beat to shit without dying. I just had two that go into a bit of a car accident and even though the housings are a little bit messed up, it'll all be hammered out and they'll go back to what they were pre-crash. They're great as 2-4 lights on a triple header with WFL globes, and then through a 6by or 8by silk. My personal favourite recipe is 4 WFL PAR64s into an 8x8' Polywhite and then through an 8x8' Full Silent Grid... Amazing way to take a brute fixture into something beautiful that can illuminate a scene with a gentle glow. My only warning about PARs is to check the Kelvin temp. of the globes you buy. Most theatre globes operate around 2700˚k due to high tungsten composition in the globe, which acts as a catalyst to the tungsten cycle (and dramatically increases globe life)."

It is a vision and style that you and the director need to come up with through conversation and communication. There's no set formula on how to shoot a horror film, stylistically. I could argue there are a lot of comedies that use wide lenses and deep depth of field.  One advice though is to watch other horror films that you like or that have a style that is suitable to your film, study them and break down their storytelling visual elements, then make them your own. And of course, discuss them with the director and understand what he or she wants, visually. After all, you're accomplishing the director's vision and building on it."

White promists are good for halation around light sources in the frame and lowering contrast and resolution.  Black promists are better if you want less halation and a little more contrast than white promists give you. They also reduce resolution.  The light grades are the way to go.  As for whether I use them... no. None of my clients want to commit to filtration up front, they want to do it in post. Then they either forget to do it because it looks good already or they go overboard.

We shot on a Nikon D600 to an Atomos Ninja Blade and a Glidecam 400, along with a 1/2 Black ProMist. The thing I love about ProMist is that it lowers the contrast of your scene, but it'll grade out really nicely. Here is a sample album of some stills from the shoot (with and without a basic luma curve). It got me the lovely bloom from the stage lights that I wanted, took the edge off of the non-diffused MAC101 backlights (which would normally cause multi-flare issues), and added a nice haze to the room (because we weren't allowed to use our own). All in all, it was exactly what I needed for the shoot and I'm glad it graded so well.  I'm usually against shooting with heavy diffusion (I'll count 1/2 Black Pro as heavy) because I'm a big fan of crispness, but it was nice to see that adding some contrast back into the scene in a simple grade brought a lot of the apparent chroma sharpness. I would probably constantly shoot with a 1/8 White or Black Pro on some of the sharper 4K cameras (BMPC, I'm looking at you) because it would be brilliant to take the near-clinical edge off of a lot of the hard lines and help wrap highlights a little more."

cinematography,368no1,ihatedrums,5,Sun May 17 06:08:09 2015 UTC,"Lighting has many properties and knowing them is important to matching the sun or practicals or to create a certain mood or meaning:  Shadow direction, the position of the light is normally the first decision made. If being naturalistic it is normally motivated from something and they have different purposes. Look at your favourite film and observe how the direction of shadows on a characters face create a certain feeling.  Light intensity, this is how bright the light is. Be aware that dimming tungsten's result in a warmer colour temperatures so NDs are better. Eventually this comes down to contrast ratio. You want variety in luminance in the frame. Another important factor in this is light fall-off which in physics obeys the inverse square law. Avoid overexposure and underexposure so you aren't losing detail.   Light quality, how soft or hard the light is. The smaller the source relative to the subject the harder the light. So moving a light further away makes it appear smaller and the light becomes harder (though less intense). Various types of diffusion create soft light as well as bouncing light off surfaces (normally diffuses it). Hard lights exaggerate texture more whereas soft lights are gentler on the subject and are often used in beauty photography.   Colour, this often affects the mood since it removes details in certain colours and exaggerates others. If I shine an HMI (5600k) light at a red car it desaturated that red. If I shine a tungsten light (3200k) at that same car the red is brighter. Colour can also be very distracting, especially if your film is naturalistic. You will likely have motivated lighting so matching the colour temperature of practicals (2700k) and daylight is important. You can use CTO or CTB gels, white balance or camera filters to fix these issues. Beware of the green cast of low quality LED lights.   Bonus round: shapes and movement also affect light. Try shooting through tree branches or venetian blinds. Try moving the light source or using a light source that moves like a candle or fire (safely).   Often with motivated lighting you would look for parts of the script where good blocking can lead to changing the lighting environment. A character stepping and and out of shadow,  somebody switching a light on, somebody turning away from the light etc  This just scrapes the surfaces of the basics but hopefully it's helpful."
cinematography,368no1,sachagoat,1 point,Sun May 17 12:39:42 2015 UTC,thank you kindly for your response! most of this information sounds really familiar but this was a bit more in depth. it was. helpful but I'm still thinking that my lighting is going to suck. lol.
cinematography,368no1,C47man,4,Sun May 17 16:13:53 2015 UTC,"I did this write up months ago but it kind of applies here too:  Alright, so you're biting off a big chunk here if you've never done lighting before. But it is manageable!  First off, fuck three-point lighting. So many people misunderstand what that system is supposed to teach you, so let's just skip it entirely. Light has three properties. They are:   Color: Color of the light. This is both color temperature (on the Orange - Blue scale) and what you'd probably think of as regular color (is it RED!? GREEN!? AQUA!?) etc. Color. You know what color is. Quantity: How bright the light is. You know, the quantity of photons smacking into your subject and, eventually, your retinas. Quality: This is the good shit. The quality of a light source can vary quite a bit. Basically, this is how hard or soft the light is. Alright, you've got a guy standing near a wall. You shine a light on him. What's on the wall? His shadow, that's what. You know what shadows look like. A hard light makes his shadow super distinct with 'hard' edges to it. A soft light makes his shadow less distinct, with a 'soft' edge. When the sun is out, you get hard light. Distinct shadows. When its cloudy, you get soft light. No shadows at all! So what makes a light hard or soft? Easy! The size of the source, relative to the subject. Think of it this way. You're the subject! Now look at your light source. How much of your field of vision is taken up by the light source? Is it a pinpoint? Or more like a giant box? The smaller the size of the source, the harder the light will be. You can take a hard light (i.e. a light bulb) and make it softer by putting diffusion in front of it. Here is a picture of that happening. You can also bounce the light off of something big and bouncy, like a bounce board or a wall. That's what sconces do. I fucking love sconces.   Alright, so there are your three properties of light. Now, how do you light a thing? Easy! Put light where you want it, and take it away from where you don't want it! Shut up! I know you just said ""I don't know where I want it"", so I'm going to stop you right there. Yes you do. I know you do because you can look at a picture and know if the lighting is good or not. You can recognize good lighting. Everybody can. The difference between knowing good lighting and making good lighting is simply in the execution.  Do an experiment. Get a lightbulb. Tungsten if you're oldschool, LED if you're new school, or CFL if you like mercury gas. plug it in to something portable and movable, and have a friend, girlfriend, boyfriend, neighbor, creepy-but-realistic doll, etc. sit down in a chair. Turn off all the lights in the room and move that bare bulb around your victim subject's head. Note how the light falling on them changes as the light bulb moves around them. This is lighting, done live! Get yourself some diffusion. Either buy some overpriced or make some of your own (wax paper, regular paper, translucent shower curtains, white undershirts, etc.). Try softening the light, and see how that effects the subject's head. If you practice around with this enough you'll get an idea for how light looks when it comes from various directions. Three point lighting (well, all lighting) works on this fundamental basis, but so many 'how to light' tutorials skip over it. Start at the bottom and work your way up!  Ok, so cool. Now you know how light works, and sort of where to put it to make a person look a certain way. Now you can get creative by combining multiple lights. A very common look is to use soft light to primarily illuminate a person (the 'key) while using a harder (but sometimes still somewhat soft) light to do an edge or rim light. Here's a shot from a sweet movie that uses a soft key light, a good amount of ambient ('errywhere) light, and a hard backlight. Here they are lit ambiently, but still have an edge light coming from behind them and to the right. You can tell by the quality of the light that this edge was probably very soft. We can go on for hours, but if you just watch movies and look at shadows, bright spots, etc. you'll be able to pick out lighting locations and qualities fairly easily since you've been practicing with your light bulb!  Ok. Now greenscreen. Honestly, your greenscreen will depend more on your technical abilities in After Effects (or whichever program) than it will on your lighting. I'm a DP and I'm admitting that. A good key-guy (Keyist? Keyer?) can pull something clean out of a mediocre-ly lit greenscreen (like the ones in your example) but a bad key-guy will still struggle with a perfectly lit one. I can't help you much here, as I am only a mediocre key-guy, but I can at least give you advice on how to light for it!  Here's what you're looking for when lighting a greenscreen:   Two Separate Lighting Setups: You should have a lighting setup for the green screen and a lighting setup for your actor. Of course, this isn't always possible. But we like to aspire to big things! The reason this is helpful is that it makes it easier for you to adjust the greenscreen light without affecting the actor's lighting, and vice versa. Separate the subject from the greenscreen as much as possible! - Pretty much that. The closer your subject is to the screen, the harder it is to keep lights from interfering with things they're not meant for, and the greater the chance the actor has of getting his filthy shadow all over the screen. I normally try to keep my subjects at least 8' away from the screen at a minimum for anything wider than an MCU. Light the Green Screen EVENLY: The green on the screen needs to be as close to the same intensity in all parts as possible, or you just multiply your work in post. For every different shade of green on that screen you'll need make a separate key effect to make clean edges, and then you'll need to matte and combine them all together. Huge headache that can be a tad overwhelming if you're not used it. For this reason, Get your shit even! ""But how do I do that?"" you ask! Well, first off, I actually prefer to use hard light. You see, hard light has the nice innate property of being able to throw itself a long distance without losing all its intensity. The farther away the light source is from the subject, the less its intensity will change from inch to inch. That's called the inverse square law, and it is cool as fuck. If you change the distance between the light and the subject, the intensity of the light will shift as an inverse to the square of the distance. Science! So if you double the distance between the light and the subject, the intensity is quartered (1 over 2 squared. 1/4). So, naturally, the farther away you are the more distance is required to reduce the intensity further. If you have the space, use it to your advantage and back your lights up! Now back to reality. You probably don't have a lot of space. You're probably in a garage. OK, fuck it, emergency mode! Now we use soft lights. Soft lights change their intensity quite inconveniently if they're at an oblique angle to the screen, but they kick ass if you can get them to shine more or less perpendicular on the screen. The problem there of course is that they'd then be sitting where your actor probably is. Sooo we move them off to the side, maybe put one on the ceiling, one on the ground too, and try to smudge everything together on the screen. Experiment with this for a while and you'll get the hang of it in no-time! Have your background in mind BEFORE shooting: Even if your key is flawless, it will look like shit if the actor isn't lit in a convincing manner compared to the background. If, for example, this for some reason is your background, you'll know that your actor needs a hard backlight from above and to camera right since we see a light source there. Also, we can infer from the lighting on the barrels that his main source of illumination should be from above him an pointing down, slightly from the right. You can move the source around and accent it as needed to make the actor not-ugly, but your background has provided you with some significant constraints right off the bat. For that reason, pick your background before you shoot, if possible. If it is not possible to do so, well, good luck! Guess as best as you can and try to find a good background."
cinematography,368no1,C47man,7,Sun May 17 19:13:51 2015 UTC,"Continued into another one because I wrote too much shit!  OK! So now you know sort of how to light a green screen and how to light a person. So now, what lights do you need? Well, really, you just need any lights. If you're on a budget, don't be afraid to get some work lights from home depot or picking up some off brand stuff on craigslist. By far the most important influence on the quality of your images will be where and how you use the lights rather than what types or brands of lights you are using. I cannot stress this enough. How you use it will blow what you use out of the water. Get as many different types of lights as you can for the money you have. That way you can do lots of sources, which can make for more intricate or nuanced lighting setups. I know you still want some hard recommendations, so I'll tell you this: Get china balls (china lanterns. Paper lanterns whatever the fuck we're supposed to call these now). They are wonderful soft lights, and if you need a hard light you can just take the lantern off and shine with the bare bulb! For bulbs, grab some 200W and 500W globes. You can check B&H, Barbizon, Amazon, and probably lots of other places for these. Make sure you grab some high quality socket-and-wire sets too. You can find them at the same places. For brighter lights, like I said home depot construction lights are nice. You can also by PAR lamps relatively cheap. Try grabbing a few Par Cans. They're super useful and stupidly cheap. Don't forget to budget for some light stands as well, and maybe C-clamps and the like for rigging to things. I don't know what on earth you're shooting so it is hard to give you a grip list, but I'm sure you can figure that kind of stuff out without too much of a hassle.  That's about all I've got for now. I'm sorry if this post was overwhelming or too wordy. I am bored, drunk, alone, and in-between shoots at the moment so I figured I'd type some stuff!"

cinematography,368no1,instantpancake,1 point,Sun May 17 19:35:01 2015 UTC,"I would not necessarily say so. In fact, 90% of all common setups (for narrative) have some form of 3-point lighting. Not necessarily textbook setups, but if you look closely, you'll find that it's almost always key, fill, and rim. They may be inverted or rotated around, but they are there. The reason why 3-point lighting is always taught to beginners is because it works everytime, and you can tweak it endlessly from the standard ""three-tungsten-fresnels"" or whatever model.

cinematography,368no1,MSeager,3,Mon May 18 04:27:48 2015 UTC,"You have to get to know what kinds of lights do what. For example, using a fluorescent light for sunlight isn't going to be convincing because sunlight tends to be harder and cast sharp shadows. Fluorescents don't do that.  It's a lot more complicated than just placing lights near the practicals. You have to think about how the background should look, and then how the people should look. Color, contrast/fill, hard/soft, direction, mood... it takes time to learn this stuff.  If you can't get on a set and watch someone work then look at behind-the-scenes videos on Youtube and try to find some decent lighting books. Focal Press might have a couple."
cinematography,368no1,MSeager,2,Sun May 17 12:03:39 2015 UTC,"When you arrive at a location, find the light switches and start turning things off. Set-up your own lights, take a look, then start turning them off. Most set's are over-lit, and that makes everything look flat. The most interesting lighting set-up's have light and dark.  Don't try and light everything. Have your actors move through dark and into the light etc."

I should get a more expensive bulb. I'm using 800W tungsten lights. The noise reduction is easy, and I'm trying some LUTs to see if the yellow-ness goes away. I really don't know how I can fix the damn thing, I only turn the knobs in Resolve to see what happens. It's neat.  I don't know what happened. Magic Lantern didn't record sound. My recorder didn't record sound. My DIY boom kept getting in the shot, because I had to operate it myself. I had to mount the mic. I have to spend over 9000 hours in Audition to fix it. I'm not really fit for one-man crew work (I did not direct it, though, my younger brother did, the one in the red shirt. Honestly if I can't mold him into a director I'm a failure of an elder brother).  Anyways I was looking to imitate Gregg Toland. Maybe for the first time lighting a shot, aiming this high is not a good idea. Due to limited space and my itch for Codeine, I couldn't get good composition. I made this specifically to get into a cinematic society. Do you think I should shoot it again? Or shoot a better one using older actors (still I have to get my brother to direct it, he knows how to block, I don't) and use your input to get a better result.

I typically find noise reduction to be far more cumbersome and time consuming than color-correction so I'm surprised you feel the opposite. Pulling a little of the reds out of the mid-tones should give you a better balanced shot, but you shouldn't need much more. You can get this done in Premier without using outside software. There's some banding in your still shots. Is that in the video as well?"

So what I'm getting at is it's going to be really difficult, but just because people tell you you can't (like in my first paragraph) doesn't mean they're right.   You'll do fine for a while, accurate color sense isn't that huge a deal for most lower budget stuff, but you'll definitely get to a point where shading things in colors will become an important part of the job. You're going to have major struggles-- but it can be done. History is filled with artists who ""couldn't"" make their art and did anyway. You just have to figure out how.

cinematography,35jte8,LaunchAllVipers,1 point,Tue May 12 04:49:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know who did the first non-breathing lenses, to be honest.  See this for info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_point_(optics)  ""focal distance"" is varied by changing the distance between the object plane and the lens's back focal plane, meaning it changes the distance between the lens and the place in the real world that's put in sharp focus at the back of the lens. If you imagine the rays moving in that diagram above, you can see that this will mean out of focus regions will not necessarily be centred relative to where the in-focus rays would be, meaning the image appears to grow and shrink as it comes in and out of focus.  ""focal length"" changes the distance between the back focal plane and the image plane, resulting in a change in the magnification factor of the lens. A zoom lens does this on a much bigger scale.  Compensation is difficult, and requires the mechanics to be designed in tandem, so that the lens maintains the same flange-focal distance (i.e. it projects a sharp image at the same location behind the lens) despite all the other things moving around."

The 70D on the other hand starts to fall apart around 800. There really isn't an APS-C Canon DSLR that is good in low light.   6D is definitely a great option and it's going down in price quickly. I've had mine for about 2 years and it's done me very well. However, it's horrible Aliasing and Moire keeps it from having a better image then the 5DIII. If you do any grading it'll be the bane of your existence when it shows up. Noise performance however is on par with the 5DIII."

Music videos and short films for the most part?  You said crit hard, so here we go   Too long. Honestly I started skipping around after about a minute, which is about as long as it should be.  You don't have a single product in your reel, so don't expect to book commercials. Go shoot some 'spec' commercials for a few brands. Use short sequences of projects so people can get even a hair of perspective. How does this shot fit into the bigger project? Big part of a reel for me is ""who's going to be watching this and what are they looking for?"". Think about it like you're watching it to hire yourself for something.

I'd also consider if at all possible getting a new email address to be honest.  (this is admittedly really knit picky) jpcarr4@yahoo does not scream ""hire me"".  consider getting your own domain (costs 20/30 bucks a year) so that you can get your own webmail at an address like ""Jameson@JamesonCarrCine"" or something to that effect.  edit: also, don't worry about ""old business"" not being able to reach you if you change your email address.  simply set your old email address to forward to your new one of vice versa.  very easy to do and very useful.  i have about three or four ""active"" emails but they all point to one.  much easier to manage that way."

Cut to the music! -The two shot at 27 seconds was cut on beat and I enjoyed that a lot. Making cuts to the music will help keep the viewer interested and help your pacing.  Great song choice.

cinematography,3557rb,drummerboy678,3,Thu May 7 05:15:17 2015 UTC,"Great job! You clearly had a lot of ambition when you created this.   Here's some criticism: I didn't buy the casting of the main girl. Her ""pleasing attributes"" are listed but we are not shown examples of them. To be honest, I find her pretty but not striking. The narrator's words didn't do enough to convince me. I thought the music didn't QUITE fit. It had kind of a fanciful fairy-tale tone that didn't mesh with the ordinary, though colorful visuals. Some of the shots, such as in the killing scenes, went on too long. The shot would say what it had to say but still linger on screen. I felt the killing scenes especially should have been more fast-paced, given that people do not want to die.  I just wanted to give criticism because I haven't seen much given to you. I liked it."

Some shots felt very cheap, especially in lighting (it also seems for example that you are not making much use of color grading), others though impressed me greatly (I'm thinking of the Fall transition shot in direction of the house with the camera going down). The good parts weighed heavier.  It could have been shorter, but honeslty it takes some talent to have me watch through an entire 20min film from some random dude on a saturday evening. I hope to see more from you in the future, you should definetily continue with films.

I know there are some that stick out to me (like usual, mostly due to limited lighting and time).  But I've stared at the images so long, I'm afraid I'm numb to seeing it with fresh eyes at this point.  If you're interested, you can see some more recent work here: music video and short film  That being said, I really do appreciate everyone who watched the film - I know 20min is long for a short, so I'm flattered by the commitment and patience to watch it all!"

It's only major drawbacks in my eyes are the weight of it, it makes hand operating tiresome and rigging it difficult on occasion, you need a very sturdy car rig, heavy duty jib etc.   The main benefits are that it's still the cheapest and easiest cinema class gimbal you can get your hands on today.   I'd always suggest weighing up how frequently you will use the equipment before buying. If it's not gonna pay for itself before it becomes redundant then it's probably not a wise investment.   Have a sleep on it and decide if you're buying cause you need it for work or if you want a new toy, that always works for me."

It just wouldn't be useable.  Here's a Wikipedia article about sensor size  With the a7 cameras you'll need to use lenses designed for full frame sensors to get the most out of your camera. Anything designed for smaller sensors will leave large black areas around the image circle and will require heavy cropping.
cinematography,34z2f5,Ryowxyz,3,Tue May 5 21:57:18 2015 UTC,"I doubt there are any speedboosters for that, but you could probably find a dumb adapter that would just allow you to put the lens on the body.  The issue you would run into is that the MFT lens outputs an image much smaller than the full frame A7s sensor, so you'll have some intense vignetting."
cinematography,34z2f5,Doctor_Karma,5,Tue May 5 19:31:20 2015 UTC,"You're joking right? That lens is designed for sensors much smaller than the full frame A7s. Speedboosters are for lenses designed for bigger sensors to be used on smaller sensors, not the other way around.   And why on earth would you want to have a lens go beyond .95 with arguably the most sensitive to light camera out there? Total overkill to begin with."
cinematography,34z2f5,ugman77,2,Tue May 5 19:46:42 2015 UTC,"Speedbooster can be used on A7s crop mode, which helps reduce the rolling shutter and keep a nearly FF fov.   No MFT to Sony adapters exist though, it's not possible. There are so many other great options out there. (edit: apparently there are, see comment below)  F/.95 on full frame? You'd have about 3 atoms in focus."

There are dozens of MFT to NEX adapters on the market.  You can get one for as little as $11 on eBay.  Shooters use them to adapt manual MFT lenses to their crop sensor NEX cameras.  But, as others have said, it wouldn't make sense to adapt a micro 4/3 lens to a full frame E mount camera. The image circle would be too small."

Arri is ""allegedly"" working on a 6k super 35 sensor. Sony has the rumored rolling Bayer pattern sensor. Within 18 months we should see all the top tier cameras replaced.  With Sony it seems that their highest end (f65 has strange diamond Bayer, next may have rolling Bayer) will be largely experimental for the next round as well. Their step down (f55 and obviously upcoming replacement) are consistently great.   Don't count Canon or Panasonic out either. The C300 mark ii is seriously good, there's every reason to think there is a C500 replacement coming. The Varicam 35 is great, there is a bit more doubt about he replacement though, the 35 just hasn't seen much traction.  At the same time we are seeing BlackMagic and AJA building amazing first serious cams.  So rent the camera for the current project.

cinematography,34wwvb,acksack,2,Tue May 5 20:49:45 2015 UTC,Looks like the glass cabinets reflecting the lights back. I'm not sure but I'd use glass of some kind. A silver surface would be too reflective and kill the effect. You just need subtle layers of the reflections to give it depth. Glass would work nicely.

There isn't a standard because there are so many variables. Best bet is to get some gels and try it out. You have to have a camera though. You can't just go by eye."
cinematography,34tpvb,cidion,0,Mon May 4 14:59:46 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with you there. You don't always get the time or money for proper tests, and a cheap personal camera likely doesn't react to light or color the way that your production camera/ film stock will. Some sensors/ stocks are more or less sensitive to certain wavelengths, even with the same kelvin balances."
cinematography,34tpvb,jonathan_92,2,Tue May 5 01:17:27 2015 UTC,Testing it could only help

cinematography,34tpvb,cidion,-1,Tue May 5 02:55:00 2015 UTC,"That you have to use a camera. I'm saying you won't always have access to something that will accurately tell you how your production camera is going to react to a light. Unless you own a color meter...but even then its not going to tell you if your camera will read an LED more green than another camera.  In most practical scenarios, you kind of just have to use your eye and your best judgement. I can identify color mis-matches by eye...I'm not saying that to gloat, it's kind of just a thing that you either can or can't do. It's important that you figure out if you're the type of person that will notice that stuff, because it can screw you over.  Even if you can, then it still takes practice. Hundreds of hours staring at flo's and HMI's. Hell I'm not nearly as good at it as a lot of people I know. I know a lot of gaffers that can judge perfectly by eye what density of CC gel we need to get lights to match each other...and they usually turn out to be right. I guess it's easy to take for granted.  But most productions, unless you're big, seldom give you time or money for tests. A lot of people don't see the value of tests anymore either. ""What could go wrong? The camera we chose for you doesn't do well under tungsten light? What are you talking about? That camera was borrowed for free/ cost a lot of money , it looks amazing!"".  Tests are wonderful when you're able to do them. I always push for them. Testing on location is even better! It's just that tests aren't as common as they used to be."
cinematography,34tpvb,jonathan_92,2,Tue May 5 04:24:43 2015 UTC,Look at 1/4 or 1/2 minus green gel. It won't improve the light's spectrum but it should balance it out so it appears to be more neutral.
cinematography,34tpvb,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Mon May 4 16:10:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for reply cidion.  Ill ask the guys in the photo/video store, and do some test"
cinematography,34tpvb,SuckerFreeCity,1 point,Mon May 4 15:29:39 2015 UTC,"As Cidion said, you can definitely fix this with some -green.  I just got back from shooting with bi-color led panels all week long with a Sony F55.  We used 1/4 minus when needed.  Your mileage will vary though."
cinematography,34tpvb,TheBoredMan,1 point,Mon May 4 16:14:19 2015 UTC,"A green filter might help. Assuming that LED is your only source of light, you could use a green filter on the camera, a magenta gel on the light might help. If it's narrative and true white isn't critical, you could embrace it and tweak your white balance to give your footage that fluorescent Fight Club look.  If it's going to be a giant headache, maybe just bring different lights. You can get pretty solid mini LEDs with a couple color temps for under $100 on amazon."
cinematography,34tpvb,ArtAdamsDP,3,Mon May 4 15:59:19 2015 UTC,"I mentioned this in another comment, but I'll say this again:  Filtering the camera, or changing the camera's color response, to compensate for one light makes every other light in the scene look wrong. If you're only using one light, or one type of light and they all have this problem, then this would work—but that's rarely the case.  A $5 sheet of 1/8, 1/4 or 1/2 minus green gel will at least make the light look neutral compared to other lights in the scene."
cinematography,34tpvb,j_deadfox,1 point,Mon May 4 19:45:47 2015 UTC,"Try putting some minus green (magenta) on the LED Panel. In regards to what type of minus green you'd use, that's determined by what the light is outputting.   If you want to be more exact, then try using a color meter to tell you the green shift if you have access to one. They're rather expensive...however, if you have an iPhone - try downloading Cine Meter II app ($25). I've recently bought it along with the luxi incident meter adapter ($25), and I'm blown away. It's incredibly accurate, and when compared alongside the Sekonics or Minolta meters - the readings are spot on. Saved me several hundred dollars."
cinematography,34tpvb,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Mon May 4 16:56:41 2015 UTC,Divide the strength of the gel the color meter suggests by two. They usually overreport the amount of correction necessary to fix green spikes. This is because the LED's green spike is vert narrow spectrally while the gel's cut is more of a gentle roll-off.
cinematography,34tpvb,jonathan_92,1 point,Mon May 4 19:47:19 2015 UTC,"gels are cheap! Buy some 1/8, 1/4, and 1/2 minus green and have it ready to go on the day, if the production won't give you tests. You can always fold or double up weaker densities to save money.  Its more rare, but you can also get magenta filters for your camera. A situation you'd do that is maybe if you have a massive night scene with led street lights, and you can't gel or replace them all. A camera filter, or color timing would be your solution.  If you aren't mixing the led's with anything else (tungsten, hmi, etc) then they are relatively easy to color correct.   So you kind of have to make the decision to either correct with gels, filters, go all LED, or not go LED depending on the situation. Point being: there are lots of options, and led's are quite usable."
cinematography,34tpvb,drummerboy678,1 point,Tue May 5 01:20:46 2015 UTC,"I've had good luck with -Green (magenta) gels on LED's.  While this is cutting out some of the color spectrum, I find it way better than the greenish tint that comes from lots of the LED panels on the market now.  But as others have said, test test test.  Avoid any changes in camera (regarding color settings) and try to get your light as accurate as possible.  This will keep the scene and lighting intact."
cinematography,34tpvb,DarthCola,1 point,Thu May 7 05:21:09 2015 UTC,There is a color meter on iPhone and Android. You can try different minus greens and see what you get. The green comes from a low CRI from the LED that you're using.
cinematography,34tpvb,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Mon May 4 16:07:22 2015 UTC,"""Low CRI"" doesn't really mean anything, as CRI is not a valid measurement for non-black body sources.  There are lights with very high CRI values that look awful, because the standard CRI samples aren't granular enough to detect the discrepancies: the spikes and spectral gaps fall in between the samples.  More on CRI here."
cinematography,34tpvb,Samdal,0,Mon May 4 19:54:37 2015 UTC,What camera are you using? I know a lot of them have in camera controls to adjust for green/magenta tint.
cinematography,34tpvb,ArtAdamsDP,5,Mon May 4 15:54:48 2015 UTC,That's a bad idea. If you adjust the camera to take green out of the image to correct for one light you make all the other lights in the scene magenta.  Better to match the one bad light to all the others.

cinematography,34sgb8,d_russ,2,Mon May 4 14:34:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, often looking like these weird, animated coma trails.  I shot a short for a friend a couple years ago and had to stabilize some footage for its opening and it was exactly like this and I hated it.  I felt ashamed that the footage was so weird looking.  I wouldn't have guessed this kind of gross artifact was ""Oscar quality"" stuff.  Good as this film was, it didn't deserve the Cinematography Oscar.  That's three years now the Academy has screwed the pooch.  It was neither a beautiful natural film of the level of Harris Savides or Lubezki's own work in this style or, obviously, an example of technical excellence.  The ""no cuts"" schtick, I thought, was better done on Silent House.  I was always still looking for the seams but the photography itself never took me out of the picture."
cinematography,34sgb8,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Mon May 4 16:09:50 2015 UTC,"What they should have done is shoot with higher shutter speeds, even a higher framerate, and then re-add artificial motion blur and down the framerate after stabilizing it. The issue isn't that they used too much visual effects, it is that it seems like it was an afterthought, an addition to footage that wasn't shot with that much stabilization in mind.  Obviously birdman did a good job, but if they wanted to a great job they would have designed their entire shots around getting that stabilization to work well. It's like if Kubrick had just replaced the candles with firecrackers in barry lyndon because he was too lazy to get a fast enough lens."
cinematography,34sgb8,BrainSlurper,1 point,Mon May 4 19:00:22 2015 UTC,"The scene where this really sticks out is the night shot, out on the balcony.  They might have actually shot with a lower shutter because of all the practical signage out there, all over the theater district, because of flicker (ironically exacerbating all the streaking you get from highlights).  It's a bit hard to tell with the stabilization but in the moments where it was fairly still it felt like that streaky, tube camera video look you get when someone is shuttering for practical flicker.  It drives me up the wall when I see that too.  I find flicker far less distracting."
cinematography,34sgb8,BurnetRhoades,0,Mon May 4 19:06:13 2015 UTC,"They probably could have just shot those scenes on rails, just because they represented such a small portion of the movie. I could have built a rig for them to do that in a couple hours, as I imagine anyone could have, but evidently it is just cheaper to compromise the cinematography of the movie in general."

cinematography,34sgb8,sonofaresiii,6,Mon May 4 07:54:56 2015 UTC,"Just because you recognize that post-stabilization is being used, I don't think that makes it a bad thing.   The bad thing is that it's easily noticed at times."
cinematography,34sgb8,helari_s,12,Mon May 4 08:09:43 2015 UTC,"That's my point. What's so bad about you noticing they're using it? I bet you noticed that they used lights on set, too. I bet you noticed that they used a steadicam sometimes. I bet you noticed there was a lens mounted to the camera.  We're trained professionals, of course we're going to notice when some of these tools are being used while the general audience might not. If the tool had caused problems with the imagery that detracted from the story, that'd be one thing. But it didn't for me, and so far that's not what anyone's saying."
cinematography,34sgb8,sonofaresiii,2,Mon May 4 08:15:19 2015 UTC,"The problem is that many people DID notice.  I do it for a living and when every non post-savvy person i talk to about the film asks what the hell was going on its an issue.  Not - 'wow that shot in fincher's girl with the dragon tattoo was so...stable!' (That was a great use of stabilization for effect) but, 'those shots looked weiiird on the roof in birdman'. There's alot more I can assume about how it all went down in production but ultimately the work was a little shoddy and worst of all detracted from the experience"
cinematography,34sgb8,xestika,2,Mon May 4 12:55:38 2015 UTC,"Many people said the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan ""looked weird,"" too. But I haven't personally heard anyone complain about the Birdman rooftop scene, at least in a way that they said worsened their experience of the movie."

Did it devalue the movie for some? Maybe. But that doesn't seem to be the big criticism going around. I'm not saying it's not a valid view if it happened to you, I'm just responding to the criticism that has been brought up so far."
cinematography,34sgb8,sonofaresiii,0,Mon May 4 15:24:08 2015 UTC,"The one and only criticism being addressed: IT WAS DISTRACTING  You can say ""nuh uh"" all you want, but clearly seeing an ugly artifact as a result of something not being done right on set will take you out of the story. Even if it's just for a moment, even if the viewer never consciously sees it, something feels wrong and it sets a tone that's clearly not intended.   Sure, we all can describe what looks wrong in scenes more succinctly due to being DPs and the like, but that doesn't mean it doesn't affect other viewers solely because they can't express why something looked wrong. I don't see why being in the industry undercuts the critiques. Being more apt to notice something doesn't make that something less valid.   Everything in filmmaking is a tool, but you don't go to an opera to see the behind the scenes. I don't want to see through the illusion when a film is supposed to be complete, especially when that film had substantial enough backing to do things correctly."

Sure, people can abuse this technique and distract their audiences, but it's not any different in the context of post-stabilization used in Birdman. They sure as hell didn't abuse this technique."
cinematography,34sgb8,Chin_Hair,1 point,Mon May 4 23:23:49 2015 UTC,"I would call it being apparent at all an abuse. Flares can be an aesthetic choice, and are usually used as such, but the stabilization in this instance was not used for any effect. It was just there.   I don't understand the resistance to acknowledge this as a mistake. Especially considering it won an Oscar. Academy awards are meaningless, etc. but it should still mean something in terms of the quality of photography. Those artifacts being so apparent and repeated for each roof scene don't strike me as Oscar calibre.   But I guess Chivo can get away with anything at this point."

Shitty production takes you out of the experience. Sometimes .1% of folks would notice, sometimes 10% would notice. You strive to get as close to 0 as possible. I think OPs confusion as to why some simple steadicam setup wasn't used is valid."
cinematography,34sgb8,TGBKyle,6,Mon May 4 12:26:13 2015 UTC,"Because shooting it on 8mm, handheld with no lighting, will provide a worse experience for the audience. I don't believe some minor warp stabilizing artifacts provide a worse experience in the same way, and until I called people out on it, no one else was claiming it did.  A steadicam was often used in the movie, but for some scenes they decided handheld provided a better tone, and I imagine some minor stabilizing in post was used to clean it up.  Personally I'm of the opinion that most of the people who are complaining about it are simply complaining because it's there, not that it's making the movie any worse."

In the final scene of true detective a characters hair was literally green because the greenscreen was showing through. Evidently it was too hard to find an actual fucking parking lot. I didn't have nearly as much of a problem with the stabilization in birdman, but things like this should be called out just because they discredit the rest of the work that was done."
cinematography,34sgb8,DNC90,1 point,Mon May 4 19:07:29 2015 UTC,"Because the stuff we intentionally notice are subconscious to the audience. We see good lighting, they see a pretty movie.

cinematography,34pqdx,marauder09,1 point,Sun May 3 18:14:32 2015 UTC,"I run a small production company and we bought the FS7 in January. It has been really great. Only 2 big issues so far.   Red Frames in Adobe Premier with MXF files.   When we imported the MXF files with Adobe Prelude, everything appears to be fine, up untill export. On export there would be randomly placed Red error frames in some exports. We have worked around this by not using prelude, and instead just copying the whole card over to a computer for back up.  This fixed 90% of it, every once and a while it still comes up, and all it usually means is reexporting whichever sequence had an error.    Banding in Highlights   After a couple of months of shooting with no issues in relatively standard real world environments, we had a shoot in a white cyc wall studio. When we got the footage into editing, the white in a lot of scenes was having some truly terrible banding. Where instead of a smooth white gradient, there were heavily segmented shades of white.  No amount of post seemed to help, it was sad.  The prevailing theory is that because we were shooting in XAVC L instead of I (to save space) the amount of data to record highlights was compressed and so it did not record it cleanly. Other theories to fix this include messing with camera settings that I barely understand.  So I would caution, watch out for that when on a white backdrop. We have a test shoot scheduled to shoot again on the CYC and just play with every setting we can to see if we can get rid of it.  Like I said before this only happened against the Cyc wall when like 70+ percent of the frame was white. We have not seen it in normal situations even where there is a lot of highlights on objects.  Overall we still are loving the look and experience of it, great camera."

Contact me and I'll send you some. I also recommend reading http://www.xdcam-user.com/2014/12/ultimate-guide-for-cine-ei-on-the-sony-pxw-fs7/ before actual shooting. Speaking of banding in highlights, we also encountered same problem while shooting some BTS footage to XAVC L 1080p, main 4K XAVC-I footage doesn't seem to band in highlights. Camera has some major flaws, one is terrible monitoring. Using  Monitor LUTs built into camera (for Rec.709 monitoring of SLog3 footage) results in loss of waveforn/histogram. So additional monitor with support of luts and waveform/histogram is big deal."

Otherwise you will end up constantly thinking which shot you can afford and which not.  It's also a bit uncomfortable to carry I would say.  Technically, it's a great camera and I would recommend it over any other in its field."

cinematography,34psvw,blickblocks,9,Sun May 3 16:46:13 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, no. Arri already had the Alexa-M, which had a small body and could work in situations where similar form factor was required. The Mini is just them continuing on that route and covering the various types of shoots and gear. As a Steadicam operator, people ask me if I think I'll end up using it, and my answer is no. Steadicam can fly most bodies that have studio modes, and jobs don't want to rent a 3rd body unless absolutely necessary. Drones couldn't fly an Alexa, but they can fly the Mini, and that means you don't have to worry about the image differing greatly from what the main unit shoots.   This isn't Arri competing with RED. This is Arri rounding out their products to further solidify themselves as the perfect company for every job. No Alexa show was renting RED Epic to use for aerial or crash cams."

All this aside: For me, as a working professional DP, it's because the standard of quality will quite soon fade from 1080p to 4k. That's a simple fact of what is happening. People are going to be owning 4k tv's/monitors. Theaters are upgrading projectors. The ""main line"" is turning to 4k.

cinematography,34o2df,jonathan_92,5,Sun May 3 01:50:53 2015 UTC,"That implies that you shouldn't think about what you're shooting before you get to set, before you get to the edit.   There is a disadvantage to re-framing beyond not doing enough planning. Optics. Blow ups are softer because all lenses are diffraction limited, meaning that their level of sharpness is finite. Blown-ups can and frequently do look softer than real shots.  Grain is also an issue, it becomes more noticeable in blow ups!   So its definitely not an ideal solution. The idea of blow ups make me cringe! I framed that shot the way it oughta be framed dammit! I don't want some idiot producer fucking with my shot. And if the director didn't like the framing, he/she should have told me on set so that i could change it for them! It just encourages SO many bad practices. Discourages pre-pro, communication with your keys, and artistry. Be confident in your imagery, second guessing yourself makes for inferior work."
cinematography,34o2df,d_russ,2,Sun May 3 09:28:34 2015 UTC,The idea of blow ups make me cringe!   Yup. And it's often one of the main reasons mentioned for shooting 4K. Damn lazy imo.
cinematography,34o2df,jonathan_92,2,Mon May 4 15:05:02 2015 UTC,"And irresponsible. It means you either didn't plan for enough time, or you don't know how to tell a story with pictures. Just because you have a camera and can fuck with footage in a computer, that doesn't automatically make you a storyteller, or an artist. However, you do have to acknowledge that cameras and computers are the medium of our art form."
cinematography,34o2df,vertigo3pc,2,Mon May 4 16:19:30 2015 UTC,"16mm existed for years, and everyone continued to shoot 35mm, even when the grain structure was tight enough that 16mm blown up and projected on 35mm didn't visibly look enormously different from 35mm.   Personally, I care about 4k because we used to shoot 35mm film for television shows broadcast in standard definition. Granted, that was the best, and almost the only, technology that looked ""best"". If we can shoot 4k, or near 4k, then why shouldn't we? The truth is, most 4k cameras don't ask us to compromise dynamic range for the sake of screen resolution.   Cinematographers don't only care about screen resolution, but it's certainly a consideration they take into account."

cinematography,34o2df,sonofaresiii,1 point,Sun May 3 17:17:09 2015 UTC,"Because 4 is more than 2, and greater resolution is one of the least expensive high end features in a camera (on first appearance, anyway).  Also, it's easy to understand. No one really understands having professional inputs or greater bit rate, but they can figure out what greater resolution means.  If you try to explain most of the other features to a producer, they'll either not see the value or you'll end up sounding like you're bad at your job. Go ahead, try and convince a producer who has their mind made up why dynamic range is more important than resolution. You'll end up sounding like you need more DR to overcome your failings as a DP."

Now getting a 4k owner-operator to admit that they don't need 4k for everything is like trying to convince a cat to jump into a bath tub. People don't like admitting that they wasted a lot of money.  4k has its uses:  -High budget, wide theater release  -VFX, particularly chroma key and rotoscope  -Re-framing in post (not a fan, but its all the rage)  -If you're consciously trying to get a super-crisp, sharp, immaculate look for a film.  But for ordinary shit, like commercial gigs, events, and ESPECIALLY short narratives, you really don't need it. The benefits of Oversampling are highly exaggerated. High bitrate 2k or 1080 will get you similar results, if delivering in those formats.  1080 upscaled still looks great if shot at a high bitrate and proper log format (i.e. Not bullshit c-log or s-log, but fucking LOG).

cinematography,34o2df,jonathan_92,1 point,Tue May 5 00:27:05 2015 UTC,"I've never used it but I do think it covers an area slightly larger than what you can see through the viewfinder.  That would make exact framing in that size a bit of an issue.  I'm curious why they chose to implement it this way.    Perhaps the 2.8K standard setting represents the portion of the sensor that's in the APS-C range so that focal lengths, distances and field of view are as you would expect moving from a film camera.  Fewer adjustments, perhaps, than moving to a larger sensor."
cinematography,34o2df,d_russ,2,Tue May 5 00:45:53 2015 UTC,"I have been using open gate all year on an anamorphic feature. Except for specialty vfx shots it sucks. The concept is brilliant and I am all about capturing as much image area as possible but the camera is severely handicapped in open gate mode. The monitor output images are TINY (at least in 2x anamorphic mode). The viewfinder image is incredibly small. Switching from open gate to normal mode requires a full camera reset (all your settings are lost including project frame rate, etc). I got around this by saving user presets for each mode and calling them up after a reset but it's a hassle. If you are shooting anamorphic the Hawk lenses won't even cover the open gate image area. Cooke lenses mostly do however.   Anyway, my biggest complaint about open gate is the very tiny monitor output and the camera reset. It's not practical for general shooting."

The Arri in 2.8K is already close to Full Silent App.   35mm cine standard is in the APS-C range, after all.

cinematography,34o2df,vertigo3pc,2,Mon May 4 16:28:45 2015 UTC,And Cinematographers of that calibre likely choose what camera to shoot on. That's the point.
cinematography,34o2df,NailgunYeah,1 point,Mon May 4 15:06:48 2015 UTC,My point was that there is a reason the best of the best are picking them right now.  The conscious decision to disregard 4k (as was asked about) in favor of something else shows the viewpoint of the Oscar winners. Of course I am obviously using winning an Oscar/being nominated as a way of determining best.
cinematography,34o2df,d_russ,-2,Mon May 4 04:02:51 2015 UTC,"Its not the sole reason, oscar winning cinematographers have worked their entire life in the field, using arri film cameras. If the products were flipped with arri producing the Epic and Red producing the Alexa, Im 100% sure it would be the other way around, I'm also 100% sure that no one could tell. Both cameras are incredibly capable, its incorrect to assert that there is a single reason to choose one over the other.  You should realise that the camera isn't an important part of filmmaking, the story and performances have a bigger impact than the sensor that captures them. Cinematography should be invisible to the average viewer."
cinematography,34o2df,NailgunYeah,2,Mon May 4 06:58:42 2015 UTC,"So just to be clear. I said that clearly the cinematographers had prioritized something else above 4k, you claim that you statements   cinematographers have worked their entire life in the field, using arri film cameras.   its incorrect to assert that there is a single reason to choose one over the other.   Is somehow contradicting it? In truth both are just examples of what I said. They have prioritized something over 4k, whether that is ergonomics, or familiarity, or a bribe from Arri makes no difference. They prioritized something and made the decision.   You should realise that the camera isn't an important part of filmmaking, the story and performances have a bigger impact than the sensor that captures them. Cinematography should be invisible to the average viewer.   That is just plane wrong. A worthless camera operator is one that will point the camera in the right general direction to sorta get maybe something kind of like capturing it.  An actual cinematographer makes careful decisions. They choose the Alexa because it offers the best skin tones. They choose carefully every aspect of the shot. The camera is an intimate part of this.  The difference between being worthless shit, and valuable art is in part the camera itself. Choosing the right camera is critical."
cinematography,34o2df,d_russ,1 point,Mon May 4 08:32:37 2015 UTC,"Not to mention, his argument disregards the fact that Panavision has had re-engineered Sony cameras since virtually the dawn of digital cinematography for film.  The number of films shot on Genesis I'd bet is smaller than the number shot on Red.  Panavision film cameras were far more common on Hollywood pictures than Arri film cameras.  Arri is the only company making digital cameras with a focus on color and response and with development based on preserving some sense of film (and Aaton before them), some kind of continuity of the aesthetic and cinema context.  The rest are technology and gadget companies for the most part.    That said, look no further than Dario Argento's Dracula 3D to see just how not a panacea the Alexa is.  It's perfectly capable of making hideous, public access looking imagery in the hands of a sufficiently talentless DP + Operator."

cinematography,34o2df,jonathan_92,2,Sun May 3 15:50:40 2015 UTC,"I realise this is more or less an exception that proves the rule - as far as I'm aware, Ruben Östlund uses reframing in Force Majeure for the purpose of double-use coverage.

I'm going to be a little harsh, hopefully only constructively.  My first instinct with the video was to turn down my audio. There's very little build up and it kind of rocked my ears. Regarding the shutter speed issue, which is very apparent - I'm not even sure this is a shutter speed issue; did you record at 30fps and then interpret as 24fps? If so - it's not the best idea to do with that with action shots. They don't conform to each other well and leads to a choppy tilt right in the beginning.  Questions about the story that NEED answering: 1) Why does she run away from him? 2) How the hell does she run so fast and why is he blind? 3) She pulls away from him directly back - why does he then turn and run out the right side of the frame? Shouldn't he be running at the camera during the second cut?  Second scene: 1) Cutting could be a bit tighter - during the shot of your feet walking, there's a solid second after your off-screen until it cuts. It doesn't work with this music. 2) When you open the door - the focus should be shifted by the camera operator when you stick your head in. I know rack focuses can be a pain in the ass, but that's not a difficult one.  WHY DO YOU KEEP FALLING?!  Invest in a tripod - they're not so expensive and an absolutely vital piece of equipment (or at the very least a monopod).  Criticism and rambling.  I really liked the shot of the stairhandles while you were running down. Clever use of framing. Final shot is very nice - but I would recommend learning about the 180 degree rule: once someone is on one side of the camera frame, they stay there unless there's a real reason to change.  All in all, a great first effort. Keep working on it and do take the time to learn the technical aspects of filming; there's a reason these are ""important cinematographic elements"" - they're tried and true.  Alright, back to work for me. ;)  Happy shooting!"

cinematography,34idko,CineSuppa,1 point,Fri May 1 17:39:56 2015 UTC,I'm still a bit confused about that myself. Right now I'm saying maybe  £8 an hourish (minimum wage is 6.50 here). Then whatever it costs in terms of shooting expenses. Then based on how much they stand to make I pretty much wing it on top. If the thing is going to make money I scale up a bit. If you're selling them a product that they then go on to sell you should get some form of a cut. If it's a music video or something that's going out for free then time spent is what they're paying for.
cinematography,34idko,demb3k,1 point,Fri May 1 18:54:52 2015 UTC,What about like a live event for a company? I shoot track days for a client and spend about 8 hours shooting and then another 4 hours editing. I charge around $50-$85 US /hr. Is that like WAY over charging? I only chose that because they told me to give them a number and they seemed okay with paying that.  It doesn't feel worth it to charge $12/hr (equivalent of 8 pounds) for something like that because it's a lot of work running around a racetrack all day trying to funnel all of the chaos into something that looks good and then editing it. However now I feel that I'm dead wrong lol. But how are you supposed to pay the rent on that sort of pay?
cinematography,34idko,CineSuppa,1 point,Fri May 1 20:34:14 2015 UTC,Honestly man that's just like my hourly rate. The actual cost of the video is agreed with the client by what I mean as winging it on top. I did 4 hours shooting a Jazz show for about 180 pounds with editing. The hourly is just me adding on my time to the video cost.  Like the video the product is being sold for a price.  But my time has got a price as well.  I might be doing it an odd way as well. It's just been easier to sell people on this for some reason.  I think I need to look into my pricing to be honest.
cinematography,34idko,whutchamacallit,1 point,Fri May 1 21:08:17 2015 UTC,"Me too. Well I don't think your way is wrong, it's definitely an interesting way of looking at the video as a product. I just posted a few questions to r/videography. Hopefully someone will give some advice on pricing if you wanted to take a look at it."
cinematography,34idko,CineSuppa,1 point,Fri May 1 21:32:46 2015 UTC,I'm still pretty green here. But I'm just trying to be fair with people right now and not screw myself.
cinematography,34idko,acksack,1 point,Fri May 1 18:56:12 2015 UTC,"He uses F55, FS7 and A7s and I'm sure a lot more. Shot  The Wonder List on those. Shot his dad interview on a7s and f55. http://philipbloom.net/2015/03/19/dad/ He has a big review of the A7s and it's more accessible to more people so it's more popular on the interwebs."
cinematography,34idko,demb3k,3,Fri May 1 18:56:00 2015 UTC,"Why does this keep coming up?  The A7S is a still camera first and a video camera second. It doesn't have a lot of really basic features that you'd find in a professional video camera. It's great for a hobby camera or if you have no other options as a filmmaker, but it's not a professional production tool.  The FS7 is a professional production tool, designed for working quickly and precisely in professional arenas. It has professional audio inputs, records to a professional format that's compressed but not crazy compressed, has less jello cam and a lot more picture options. Plus it's just designed to be used as a video camera, so you can put it on your shoulder and manipulate the crucial controls by touch while watching focus in an actual eyepiece.  If you're going to be a professional you need to buy professional tools. That's an FS7, not an A7S."
cinematography,34idko,acksack,-1,Fri May 1 22:06:57 2015 UTC,"yeah... but low light. The low light capabilities alone on the a7s make up for all the lost time messing with non existent buttons/abilities etc. Completely depends on what your shooting. The auto focus is pretty good as well. I think a lot of people get stuck on the whole professional camcorder thing, your are right about everything but I think you underestimate how easy it is to get an a7s to that professional working capability."
cinematography,34idko,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Sat May 2 02:35:15 2015 UTC,"how easy it is to get an a7s to that professional working capability   Not so sure on this one. Maybe you have a different definition of ""professional working capability""."
cinematography,34idko,sojoba,2,Sat May 2 03:04:12 2015 UTC,"Professional, IATSE 600 Camera Operator here. I recently shot with the A7S / Odyssey 7Q in 4K for a narrative short. The low-light capabilities of this camera are second to none. The ergonomics and features of that setup are horrid, but at the end of the day, the image we got was astonishing. But then again, we didn't have to worry about rolling shutter, etc.  I personally like that you can't record audio to it, but then again, I'm a purist. I don't feel that either of these options are professional cameras.  Not really defending the camera... moreover providing perspective."
cinematography,34idko,sojoba,2,Sat May 2 05:32:08 2015 UTC,"I have nothing at all against the camera, but it's naive to think that it can hold its own in a professional capacity (at least I think so)"
cinematography,34idko,photogjayge,1 point,Sat May 2 16:45:13 2015 UTC,Seconded.
cinematography,34idko,roughnecktwozero,1 point,Sat May 2 19:43:04 2015 UTC,"I see the a7s as a particular niche flavor of video--it's your ordoeuvre, not your meat and potatoes."
cinematography,34idko,photogjayge,1 point,Thu May 7 22:03:36 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right. I wanted to shoot something with extremely low light in the desert and see what my eyes could. For the first time with any medium I've recorded on, the A7S made that possible. Now to see how it holds up with a grade."
cinematography,34idko,RizzoFromDigg,0,Thu May 7 23:27:12 2015 UTC,"a lot of the time audio is going to be recorded separately on a shoot with an fs7 sized budget, shogun does timecode and great focus peaking, then you just need a cage/rig. no global shutter still tho (fuck). Most likely slightly more room to grade with the fs7 (idk tho, does the a7s with shogun do raw?) there both great"
cinematography,34idko,ArtAdamsDP,2,Sat May 2 03:21:21 2015 UTC,Yeah but running two separate monitors and you're screwed.

cinematography,34idko,ArtAdamsDP,1 point,Sat May 2 04:17:32 2015 UTC,"How important is low light capability? The native ISO of an FS7 is 2000. I rate it at 1000, and that's TONS more than I've ever been used to.   I lit an interior a couple of weeks ago using three small HMIs and ended up shooting at T5.6 1/2. That was just crazy. Not too many years ago I was struggling just to get a T2.  For documentary work I suspect an A7S would be the better choice, but I'm a cinematographer, not a documentarian. I light stuff. I only accept what's there if it's already right for the story. I've yet to run into a normal professional situation where ISO 800-1000 at T2 isn't enough.  As for getting an A7S to work at a professional level... it's still a souped-up stills camera. It makes pretty pictures at some level but it's not designed primarily as a video tool. I know a lot of people don't know enough about camera design to understand the limitations, but I do. It's great if you don't have a budget, and it's great if you need quick shots to cut in with better cameras that won't fit in the space or will cost more if they're demolished, but it's still a technological hack."
cinematography,34idko,dinosawrsareawesome,2,Sat May 2 05:36:49 2015 UTC,I would say go with the FS7. The thing is a beast. Congrats on getting such regular work btw. Any advice for someone who isn't having as much luck in the corporate arena?
cinematography,34idko,cornflaik,3,Fri May 1 16:44:39 2015 UTC,Make a few sweetheart deals with companies and people you like working with on the condition they never mention how cheap you were. Then start charging a living wage with people who can actually pay it. Fair pricing and keeping your friends as friends seems to be working so far. It's the one thing at uni they kept drumming into us.
cinematography,34f5bq,girouxfilms,14,Thu Apr 30 17:06:25 2015 UTC,"We were laughing hysterically... I wish you could hear the dialogue. It was an awesome attempt and the rig was actually quite comfortable. AND we did get a few great clear shots with the rig actually doing its job. Unfortunately it wasn't cohesive to the rest of the scene so we cut it for creative purposes. We refilled the mop bucket with clean water 3X to get a good dunking shot. I am only posting this because its fun to look back on things that didn't work, and share with your fellow peers ideas that you tried."

cinematography,34f5bq,merrickx,2,Thu Apr 30 19:43:39 2015 UTC,Well you say it didn't work because of the narrative. Is it ok to say it worked as a shot in general? It looks fine to me.
cinematography,34f5bq,TheWolfster,3,Thu Apr 30 19:40:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yea, I asked the editor to get the raw uncompressed takes of it to save for a POV reel!

Better low-light, down-sampling from 4k, EVF, great screen, C-Log and better dynamic range, XLRs and professional audio, 1080p60, form factor, I can go on and on."
cinematography,34fvo5,AShavedApe,1 point,Fri May 1 07:30:44 2015 UTC,Yeah the other guy is right. The next step should DEFINITELY be the Mark II. Using C-Log and Wide DR is wonderful. This camera will be used widely for a long time simply because of how easy it is to get an amazingly clean and colorful image. I would definitely recommend the Sigma Art series because of the low aperture and amazing build quality.

cinematography,34g4n6,cinephile67,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:28:29 2015 UTC,"After seeing your photo on Analog it feels a little desaturated, but that's only because I'm seeing it in comparison to the photo. Otherwise this is fantastic. It's got a very consistent tone throughout which adds a lot to the function of the cinematography. The only thing I'd pay attention to is eyelines in the interview setting. Sometimes he doesn't know where to look and when he's positioned on the left side of the frame, and then looking up and to our left as well, even though the composition is nice, his eyeline makes it feel squashed and a little unnatural."
cinematography,34g4n6,gaber-rager,2,Fri May 1 00:42:59 2015 UTC,"You have a point there about the eyelines, however I would disagree and go as far to say that it is the opposite of unnatural.  The fact that he had to look around the room and think about what he wanted to say, you can almost tell what he's feeling at that very moment. To me, that's raw intimacy. Often times, I find that those are one of the hardest things to achieve in film making.  He seemed like a great subject to be documented and it didn't feel unnatural/scripted. That being said, I would have liked to see more of what he has made as I feel that would help the audience to connect with him even more.  I like that you left a few more seconds at the end after he said his final words, it makes all the difference imo. All in all, this is a clean/intimate short film/doc"
