diablo3,3e3nep,DatFlow,5,Tue Jul 21 18:30:08 2015 UTC,"The wind blows frozen wisps off snowdrifts, where they’re caught in the decorated grooves of a cold, iron bridge leading to the broken gates of Sescheron. Where once the sights and sounds of a bustling city could be found, now there are only the distant howls of madmen, glimpses of hungry beasts prowling in shadows, and air thick with the palpable weight of shattered hope. Behold, the Ruins of Sescheron: Gameplay video of the Ruins of Sescheron  The Glory of Past Sescheron  Sescheron was once a living symbol of united Barbarian tribes. Its gates guarded the lone path to Sanctuary’s most precious treasure, the Worldstone, and the Children of Bul-Kathos were tasked with defending those gates. They had done so unerringly for countless generations. It was believed that the city would never fall, and the people of the Northern Steppes would always stand vigilant. In its final days, Sescheron was ruled by Chief Elder Kanai, who was not only loved by the people, but being considered to sit upon the Immortal Throne. Such a high honor had only been bestowed upon two others in the past, including Bul-Kathos himself.  The Day All Hope Was Lost  To this day, all who dare enter the ruins are met with a gruesome reminder—some deeds are so evil that their stains never wash away. . . .   When Baal, the Lord of Destruction, marched an army of the Burning Hells upon Sescheron, he was met by a lone emissary who denied him passage. Infuriated, Baal took matters into his own hands, and summoned demonic forces to tear the emissary apart. The first blow of the battle had been struck, but more blood would spill before it was over. Chief Elder Kanai and his people stood their ground against the impossible flood of Baal’s army with every fiber of their being. In the end, however, evil prevailed and the warriors of Sescheron fell. All that was left of the city after Baal’s passage was shattered ruins, the hopeless madness of a failed people, and the cold, empty shadows of a once mighty civilization.   Seek the Ruins and Recover the Cube  The Ruins of Sescheron can be found by opening the Act III Adventure Mode map, and selecting the newly added waypoint in the upper-right corner. Be sure to talk to Zoltun Kulle before you begin your quest to find Kanai’s Cube. A word of advice: Take great care when exploring these dangerous ruins, brave nephalem, for the only thing darker than the suffocating sorrow surrounding these ruins is the shroud of death that hangs over it."

diablo3,3e30z5,timoseewho,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:43 2015 UTC,Marauder was nerfed not buffed.  You would be better off with an unhallowed set or a natalya set
diablo3,3e30z5,axios666,3,Tue Jul 21 16:49:17 2015 UTC,That's really not true.  I do more damage now than before the patch.  It's just that you can't drop the sentry and run away - It's now a more active playstyle.
diablo3,3e30z5,obie191970,-4,Tue Jul 21 18:49:52 2015 UTC,"How is that not true?  How do you possibly do more damage now?  It's completely reliant on your current hatred, which depletes very rapidly even with boosters.  It's impossible to do more damage than before, when spenders were rotating and being cast constantly.  Now you must wait for hatred regen and then it goes once...ok?  Not more damage at all lol.  Explain?  I also didn't run away previously, just smoke screen when near lethal and keep fighting...your post makes no fucking sense."
diablo3,3e30z5,Invinciblex,0,Tue Jul 21 19:04:37 2015 UTC,That's why you use a Kridershot or whatever that thing is for the Spinny disc things that I forget what they're called while you're waiting.

diablo3,3e30z5,TheObelisk,0,Tue Jul 21 16:18:40 2015 UTC,2h crossbows like the crafted arcane barb are about as good as anything for m6 since they are very hated efficient. etrayu (for cold) and calamity are good to.  but if you really want to optimize your damage you should switch to the Unhallowed essence set (or nats for a very different play style)
diablo3,3e30z5,norgridwilliams,0,Tue Jul 21 17:11:28 2015 UTC,So it's been a while since I played.  http://eu.battle.net/d3/en/profile/invincible-1429/hero/45810824  It seems they nerfed this build heavily?  Now there are charges on the sentries?  And they only fire hatred spenders when you do?  That's so fucked goodbye M6 build.  I would say one handed with bombadiers is best but...now I'm not so sure..
diablo3,3e30z5,Invinciblex,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:12:42 2015 UTC,"This was buff, not nerf..."
diablo3,3e30z5,kyeelee,2,Tue Jul 21 16:20:27 2015 UTC,But it was a nerf to how much work you had to do. This is lazier than the current spin2win barb since you could hide.
diablo3,3e30z5,obie191970,2,Tue Jul 21 16:27:30 2015 UTC,"This - M6 now does more damage, it's just you actually have to play the game to get there."
diablo3,3e30z5,Invinciblex,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:51:44 2015 UTC,"Nah.  Hatred goes way too fast, if it's not automatically shooting spenders this build is like 90% less viable. How does it possibly do more damage now?"

diablo3,3dzy0t,TheFarthan,11,Mon Jul 20 22:02:06 2015 UTC,"I first played it for the story, which was okay but not that great, but as soon as you hit the level cap and get your first few set items the game really starts to get fun. progressing through greater rifts with different builds is really fun for me. So, stay till the endgame, see if you like that"
diablo3,3dzy0t,Vanshaa,7,Mon Jul 20 22:07:32 2015 UTC,"Several people mentioned already about how much better (and different, in case of last-gen console) this game is on PC.  What's also important is that at some point you may just need to accept that this game may not be for you. I mean, no matter how much the Borderlands series incorporate RPG aspects in their games, still at the very core they are FPS games. This makes that series completely different in feels than an action RPG like Diablo. So no, there really aren't that many things about this game you should like more if you come from Borderlands. This doesn't mean that you won't like it though, so try it again some more, this time with the thinking that this game is nothing like Borderlands."
diablo3,3dzy0t,cronoscronos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:58:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I too have previously considered the possibility that maybe this game just isn't for me. It could be why the Borderlands series was created in the first place; for people who love certain aspects of Diablo, but not necessarily the gameplay.  Anyway, I am still on the fence for now, though.  Thanks for the honest answer."
diablo3,3dzy0t,kageurufu,6,Mon Jul 20 23:04:50 2015 UTC,"The level cap is just the beginning.  Unlike borderlands where you can find crazy legendary gear the whole way through, and the story is the main point of the game (and replaying through NG+), Diablo is completely different  On PS3 (Hopefully you have ultimate evil edition, this doesnt apply to the base game) you dont even get to the real game until the level cap. Adventure mode, gearing, exploring Rifts, Greater Rifts, and bounties are the bread and butter.  Sadly, PS3 won't be receiving future content patches, if you want to play console, PS4 and XBone are up to date, and will stay that way. But PC is the better experience IMO, some skills and builds are just unusable on console, the teleport stun wizard builds that are popular right now arent feasible on console due to being unable to limit your teleport distance. Barbarian's Whirlwind on the other hand is just fine. Demon Hunter can be more difficult as way due to difficulty aiming Vault."
diablo3,3dzy0t,Protoliterary,3,Mon Jul 20 22:20:53 2015 UTC,"True enough. I can dig that. That does all sound really appealing. Maybe I should buy the PC version.  Are the different builds really diverse and different to play, though? One thing I like so much about Borderlands is that a single class (like Zer0 the assassin) can have more than one play style that are as different as night and day. He can either be a crazy good sniper, or an up, close and personal melee badass, depending on how you build him. And that's just one example."
diablo3,3dzy0t,Blkwinz,3,Mon Jul 20 22:33:47 2015 UTC,"In general, each class has a few viable builds.   The wizard, for example, has an optimal build for pretty much every occasion, but no single build that surpasses all the others at everything.   If you're playing T6 difficulty (the highest ""standard"" difficulty without GRifts), you can build pretty much anything you want and have it work. There are countless of possibilities. Few games are as diverse."
diablo3,3dzy0t,himthatspeaks,4,Mon Jul 20 22:47:00 2015 UTC,"Borderlands is mostly talent-based. Diablo is more gear-based. There are plenty of setups that ""work"", but there are always a few that are clearly the best (sets with very defined playstyles) which will outshine non-set builds by far. The sets have clearly defined playstyles, but they aren't really ""diverse"". You pick your set and then you're locked into using a specific set of abilities in a specific way. If there isn't a set that supports the way you want to play, well, enjoy doing 1/5 the damage of everyone who is using a set."
diablo3,3dzy0t,Blkwinz,3,Mon Jul 20 23:36:26 2015 UTC,"So say I pick the Tal set, I could go with serpent sparked and mammoth hydra it for more fun arcane hydra. I could go with Gesture of Orpheus with Delsere mix. I could go star pact and meteors as well. I could drop focus and restraint and pick up one more active.  I could go with Tals and wether walker stun build. That's pretty different.  What I'm trying to illustrate is each set has multiple viable builds and those are just main line. That's three different play styles off the top of my head for one set."
diablo3,3dzy0t,himthatspeaks,2,Tue Jul 21 11:27:02 2015 UTC,"You aren't going to say mammoth hydra's playstyle is different than arcane hydra. Delsere's hybrid is still a set-based build, and it has its own clearly defined playstyle - throw slow times everywhere but otherwise just generally do whatever you were doing with tal's. Aether walker does change the style slightly, but it's just more teleports than before, everything else (except double hydra) is the same.    Also, that's not three styles for one set, thats two styles for one set and one style for a different set (delrashas)"
diablo3,3dzy0t,Blkwinz,2,Tue Jul 21 16:31:46 2015 UTC,"So Tal hydra, Tal meteor, Tal with Delsere pieces, and Tal with aether walker. Different play styles. That's four different play styles, one set. I'd argue arcane and mammoth are different but in the greater context of the game, let's say they're not."
diablo3,3dzy0t,kageurufu,2,Tue Jul 21 17:48:42 2015 UTC,"Tal with Delsere's is two sets. It's a hybridized playstyle from those two, not some unique Tal's playstyle. You could argue those Hydras are different, but they do not affect the way you play. You throw the hydra down whenever. Whether or not it's mammoth or arcane doesn't really have an impact on placement or timing, or anything.    The playstyle of Tal's in particular is still limited to pick 4 different elements and cast them all constantly. No cooldowns allowed, and 4 elements must be picked. Sure you can use a different hydra, sure you can teleport more often with that wand, but it's still generally the same. You'll never be able to use archon with that set, no matter how much you may like the ability."
diablo3,3dzy0t,chaawuu1,2,Tue Jul 21 18:35:48 2015 UTC,"I have three different builds I switch between on my wizard. Firebirds I can move crazy fast, cast lots of fire and explosions, and leave DOT (damage over time) that will just kill everything I exploded past, but its not great for higher greater rifts. Tal Rasha's I'm using 4 elements and either pretty much meleeing everything with teleport, stunning and dropping massive meteors on them, or I'm playing ranged, keeping far away, and dropping massive meteors and freezing things. Delseres + Tal rasha I'm teleporting around, trapping things in giant bubbles, and blowing them up with 4 elements at once.  Theres more builds, although at really high level (like, obsessive levels of play) you start narrowing down towards one or two builds being playable.   I regularly switch out different skills and gear to try new combinations too. Every class has several different builds and playstyles that will at least get you into mid-level greater rifts at this point."
diablo3,3dzy0t,fatino,2,Mon Jul 20 23:59:07 2015 UTC,You can try d3 on trial for free before you have to commit
diablo3,3dzy0t,Grandmaster_C,2,Tue Jul 21 07:30:41 2015 UTC,"I don't wanna be that guy but if you want to put time into a game and feel rewarded I'd suggest you try Path of Exile. Diablo 3 is a really casual game. I still come back after patches for about a week to d3 but it's boring and repetitive after 3 days of playing. It's easy to reach your peak and annoying if you get unlucky and just can't drop that single unique item. I have playtime of 450 hours in poe and I've experienced maybe 30% of content.  There's just million builds you can do. And you feel so good if you char works out. But you have to put a lot of effort in learning this game. It's unforgiving and quite scary for newcomers. The amount of customisation and things you have to consider to have end game build can be overwhelming at first.  TL:DR if casual play d3 it's fun for a while, if wanna put more time into it, only poe"
diablo3,3dzy0t,Dekzter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:53:59 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for the recommendation.  Torchlight II is another game I have, that I've never really put much time into either. I've been thinking about checking it out a little more, but I fear it might feel a little too similar to Diablo; at least to a guy like me, who isn't as experienced with hack 'n' slash RPGs."
diablo3,3dzy0t,Draconax,0,Tue Jul 21 02:21:25 2015 UTC,There's also Path  of Exile which is an ARPG like Diablo and Torchlight but with way more depth than either. You may find the graphics lacking though.  It's also free.
diablo3,3dzy0t,portrait_fusion,0,Tue Jul 21 04:02:09 2015 UTC,I played Torchlight 2 for a couple days before returning it and running back to Diablo 3.  Diablo 3 is far superior.
diablo3,3dzy0t,portrait_fusion,5,Tue Jul 21 02:43:12 2015 UTC,"First things first: play it on PC.  Playing it on console is average at best.   Second, I think the complexity of the game comes a lot more from the ""meta"" game of figuring out (or copy-pasting others, if you're into that) builds from all the unique legendaries, sets, and skill sets in the game.  This will get even more complex in 2.3 with the addition of the Kanai's Cube, which will open even more builds.  This game is definitely not about the story, or leveling to 70.  The story was ""okay"" when I played through it the first time, but never again.  You play through Adventure Mode because its just vastly better.  D3, unlike BL2, is about the endgame, not leveling up.  You get to 70 and THEN the real game begins.  Then you start real progression through rifts, bounties, greater rifts, leveling up legendary gems, finding sets, getting those unique legendaries you need, finding ancient pieces, and so on.    That's my feeling, anyways."
diablo3,3dzy0t,mambotomato,3,Tue Jul 21 04:30:45 2015 UTC,"One thing that Diablo 3 has always been missing is that feeling of not wanting to stop and being engaged for hours on end. I first played on console and got to Act 2 or 3 before I stopped for a few days and played a bit here and there after that.   I went through the same feeling for wanting to like it and I still don't entirely think it's a great game. A good one, yes, but there's just too little to do that's any different from any other thing you can do.   Rifts aren't anything different than randomly assigned zone and enemy sets. The enemies themselves aren't really any different (outside of HP and resistance differences in Greater Rifts) than any other enemy. There are enemies you'll see grouped together and when you see the affixes they all have, you just go ""ok, they're doing A, B, D and K things, so I'll do what's best for the scenario"".   Which then brings up the scenario's themselves being limited in the challenge aspect. Things start hitting super hard and taking crazy amounts of damage, but outside of that all that really matters is what (of the limited) spells that they can cast, that they are casting. It doesn't really matter all that much either, as to what types of damage they are doing because some classes will bounce around the ones they can't tolerate, others will mitigate the damage and soak up the brunt of the attacks.   What you do in terms of meta (amount and speed of clicking and timing on casts/maneuverability) matters a great deal for the character that you are playing. Being that all level 70 characters are exactly the same as each other in the same class, makes it so learning the meta's for each class is less involving than it might seem, doubly so because of the set-effect-driven end game.   At the end of the game (70, XXX+ paragon, ancient gear, etc) you are more or less funneled into a couple of different meta-types of equipment layouts because without using a multitude of set-piece effects (most often, very specific matchups) you have no possibility of reaching the highest greater rift levels.  Which then brings up why Greater Rifts are both a good and bad thing.   Good thing: a measuring stick for growth and it never stops being a challenge due to always having higher levels to go up)  Bad thing: perpetuate's a boring way to play the game all for the exact same type of experience as always just for larger amounts of the same types of rewards. You can get more legendary items due to the higher levels, or a ton more money (which ends up being useless when you're in the billions) or way more of the same 2 resources, but that's all it ever ends up being.   There's nothing exciting to see or do, nothing different on Greater Rift 50 as opposed to Greater Rift 10, it's just harder. And that's crazy boring.   Ever since Reaper of Souls they have been patching, patching, patching, making seasonal legendaries and balancing all kinds of things. This new patch looks to be pretty awesome, but it's just more things to get, not more things to do (outside of 1 new quest).   Long post is long, but I think the very reason I found it boring and forgettable in the first place is because it is boring and forgettable, but they're adding fun a little bit at a time. Most of the design choices are boring and forgettable. There's no excitement or reason to ever make a new character of a class you have at 70, there's absolutely no reason to want to play through campaign more than once (the rewards in adventure mode and within every facet of adventure mode are far greater).   The game has always felt like we keep being given these awesome toys, spells and cool flashy effects to collect and just look at without any real reason to need them beyond big impressive numbers. There's no massively difficult quest or special 1-of-a-kind encounter to use these cool toys on. It just ends up being ""I want big numbers and be at the top of the leaderboards"".   It is however fun if you play only on occasion and with friends, from my perspective. A lot of people get a lot out of seasons though. It does seem like fun, I might give Season 4 a shot with all the new stuff going in.   I still want to want to play the game much more frequently than I do, but it's ""patch comes in, play for a week, go back to not playing"". YMMV."
diablo3,3dzy0t,Milkyrice,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:05:33 2015 UTC,I appreciate the long post. It was very insightful.
diablo3,3dzy0t,badmalloc,2,Mon Jul 20 23:17:38 2015 UTC,well it was something i had noticed super early on too. They need to change a lot about the backbone to this game for it to be better than it can be going in the direction it's going in.
diablo3,3dzy0t,Draconax,3,Mon Jul 20 23:34:27 2015 UTC,"I find the game is more fun on a higher difficulty level. The default is definitely too easy, even for a new character."
diablo3,3dzy0t,joeangler,2,Tue Jul 21 00:33:14 2015 UTC,"generally speaking, if you start the game on master difficulty you should be lvl 70 by the time you beat the game. Only 1 playthrough vs 3 playthroughs in vanilla"
diablo3,3dzy0t,jamoliah,3,Tue Jul 21 14:19:33 2015 UTC,"Wow, funny you should mention Borderlands 2. I just recently discovered that game, and truly loved it. However, Diablo 3 is my favorite game of all time. I agree, actually, that combat is more fun in borderlands, so why do I like D3 more than borderlands? It does everything else so much better.  In my opinion, the borderlands classes all play extremely similarly. Not so in D3. In fact different builds of the same class often play very differently. Also, when I hit the level cap in borderlands I was expecting the same (massive) change in quality of gear over time. In D3 a fresh level 70 with yellows isn't even close in power to a fully geared character. I didn't get this same sense of differentiation in borderlands.  I'm sure I could come up with some other quibbles, but let me get on to the important thing. Essentially, I felt like D3 has a much deeper ""end game"". Yes, I could have grinded for the very best guns in borderlands, but: 1) grinding wasn't really encouraged. I felt like I was almost discouraged from playing after I cleared the quests. All of the best loot was locked out once you completed it once (I'm thinking about the DLC loot stashes at the end). And a lot of interesting battles weren't as interesting once you cleared a quest. 2) I didn't feel like I had much reason to grind. I get better gear. So what? What am I going to do with this better gear? I didn't feel like there was much to do. In D3 there are harder torments. There are higher greater rifts. In fact I think that is something D3 does much better than Borderlands: a smooth, and long difficulty scale, with steady progression all the way. From a fresh level 70 all the way to the highest grifts (I assume) you feel like you're making progress.  I ramble.   Here's an idea for my new favorite game ever: The best part of Borderlands 2 mixed with the best parts of Diablo 3."
diablo3,3dzy0t,zedhehou,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:49:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can sense a lot of merit to the things you're saying. I think Borderlands 2 just hits home for me in a way I can't quite explain. It's a combination of everything. Even the little things, like the characters and atmosphere and stuff.   But if everything you're saying is true, and I'm sure it is, maybe they should find some way to combine the best parts of Borderlands 2 with the best parts of Diablo 3. Because you're right; once I did get all the legendaries I cared to have for each character, I didn't really know what to do next.  I do disagree with you about all the characters playing very similarly, though. Maybe you'll see in time that there are a lot of cool, unique things about each class. It does seem similar on the outside, but it's once you really dig in and master each class that you start to really notice their perks."
diablo3,3dzy0t,darkgamr,2,Tue Jul 21 02:18:06 2015 UTC,"I think mostly what he's referring to is that every class in Borderlands is basically just shooting guns.  Yeah you can play melee builds with Krieger or Zer0, but basically you're just finding different ways to shoot people.  I love BL2, and I've played a fair amount (not near as much as you, for sure), but playstyles in Diablo 3, in my opinion, differ far more than in BL2.  Between classes, and between builds, you will play extremely differently.  A zDPS monk will play waaaay different than a n R6 dashing monk.  By comparison, is there a ton of difference between an Axton playing Guerilla, and one playing Survival?  Or even between Axton and Salvador?  Not overly.  You just shoot things in the face.  There will be some variation with some of the talents, and due to the different class actives, but overall, the playstyle is pretty similar."
diablo3,3dzy0t,zedhehou,3,Tue Jul 21 04:05:54 2015 UTC,"It is quite a bit different playing behind a keyboard and mouse, you feel like you're in much more control. This goes for all of the menu navigations straight down to the control of your character on-screen and where attacks land. It just feels a little more user-friendly on PC. This is purely my opinion here, but the overall experience on computer just feels overall like the way it was meant to be played.    Again, only my perspective here, but in terms of story and game mechanics, try at least finishing the story before completely abandoning it. Also, play with friends if you aren't already! Makes it 10x better."
diablo3,3dzy0t,SkUnKzZ66,2,Tue Jul 21 03:59:12 2015 UTC,"Although both games provide multiplayer, character building elements, and a thrilling loot hunt they use combat systems from entirely different genres. It's very possible that even though you like the game play elements they have in common, you prefer FPS combat to a traditional Hack'n Slash. If that's the case I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't like it. At their core these games are repetitive and you have to truly enjoy their combat mechanics to keep playing."
diablo3,3dzy0t,supervernacular,2,Tue Jul 21 02:26:19 2015 UTC,"I have both the PS4 version and the PC version, I've played the PC version since it was first released. I think the co-op and the control in the PS4 version bring the game to a hole new level. However, what bugs me is that the PS4 version doesn't show the detailed info about skills etc.. For example, it doesn't say which skill deals which type of damage, and for how much. The PC version throws all these details at you, and turns the game into mathematics.   Diablo 3 isn't about the story, which is so-so to me. It's about the end game. The interesting things get started after you beat the story mode and get to level 70, and start the adventure mode, where you can get the best gears in the game. It's all about those legendary and set items. So if you just got to Act 2 for the first time, you need to keep going.  That said, I haven't played D3 for a while, the combat part is over-simplified, as you mentioned. I wish it could be like Dark Souls or Bloodborne."
diablo3,3dzy0t,Worryed,2,Tue Jul 21 02:48:13 2015 UTC,There's a setting in the options for the console version called enhanced tooltips to enable skill details
diablo3,3dzy0t,himthatspeaks,2,Tue Jul 21 08:58:32 2015 UTC,Thanks so much! I assumed it was made that way because the PC version shows everything by default.   Now I can say I like the console version way better than the PC version.
diablo3,3dzy0t,Voffz,2,Tue Jul 21 09:29:49 2015 UTC,"For one thing, Diablo is far more competitive than Borderlands. Me and my friends and clannies are constantly trying to out rift each other on our leader boards. Diablo 3 also has a much larger end game community. For me it's mostly about character progression and beating the highest difficulty I can (given there is no current achieveable hard cap, people are constantly breaking records) whereas when I played Borderlands 2 I would get to OP 8, be fully geared and find It easy. Diablo has a much richer theory crafting aspect, but there are always standout build which will be better due to people min maxing. If you want a competitive loot based arpg, Diablo is the game for you. Oh and btw PC Diablo is much better for what in talking about, PS4 is rampant with hackers and difficulties are toned down due to how much slower the input on the console is."
diablo3,3dzy0t,RYKIN5,2,Tue Jul 21 03:03:50 2015 UTC,"Borderlands 2 is good but favorite game of all time? Man that is a bold statement... over the Zelda series? Over all the Final Fantasies, first person shooters, MOBAs, open world RPGS?  As for what people like about this game, for me, its min maxing of skills, finding niche playstyles, and finding perfect gear. I think it was better back in the the Diablo 2 days in terms of gearing with runewords, jewels, charms, and such but Diablo 3 is on track to surpass it to be THE gear-fest game with the new cube thing and adding new legendaries each season.  If you think of the skills as the foundation of a common house, the gear is all the decorations and rooms you can have inside. Combat is more like... the paint on the house, it never changes unless you want it to, and becomes very boring very quickly. And the story of Diablo is like... the realtor selling you the house, they tell you a nice story of the history of the house, but its not all true and not very interesting, but its always been that way and its what you would expect."
diablo3,3dzy0t,frankenmota,-1,Tue Jul 21 03:37:56 2015 UTC,"Haha True enough. Nice analogies!  And yeah, I guess ""favourite game of all time"" is a pretty bold statement to say of any game, and it probably won't be my favourite for the rest of my life. But it's definitely the one game I've put the most time into ever, of any game. And I've been gaming since I was like five (I'm 27 now). If it's not my number-one favourite (which I think it is at the moment, anyway), then it will probably be on my top-10 list for a long, long time.   Zelda is definitely great in that I respect it as a wonderful franchise. But I'd be lying if I said I've had a burning passion for those games over the years. I recognize the quality in them, though, and I'm a big fan of Nintendo."
diablo3,3dzy0t,Nevrmorr,2,Tue Jul 21 05:14:32 2015 UTC,"For me, Diablo 3 only gets interesting once you got the pieces to start dealing damage with the build you were planning to do; the leveling process and all that is really boring in my opinion. Of course, the storyline is really nice as well and if you're a fan of those, you should pay attention to it!"
diablo3,3dzy0t,Stillhart,2,Tue Jul 21 03:40:17 2015 UTC,"Clearing a rift in 20 minutes, not such a good game okay experience. Clearing it in two minutes, much more fun.   When you clear a g45 in three minutes and get five legendaries, that's s different game than a 20 minute t6 and maybe three legendaries,"
diablo3,3dzy0t,mrtomhimself,2,Tue Jul 21 11:31:58 2015 UTC,"Trust me when I say the game is not very inspiring untill you reach max level, It does get alot better then.   Once you get your gear sorted out you will feel like a god just wrecking through rifts!   Hang in there, join the top communities (chat) and you will see people who are offering boosts if you give magic items (blue items) to them."
diablo3,3dzy0t,hi2323,2,Tue Jul 21 11:45:22 2015 UTC,"For someone that has 1700 hours played on D3, I'd like to say it's not better on PC for various reasons. 1.) optimized for pretty good performance on console (and I typically play with 4 controllers, feeding one character all the loot. 2.) Feels good on a controller. Really smooth. Always liked playing games in our living room opposed to the man-cave. 3.) No seasons. So, you can get access to all the new gear without having to reroll a new character. 4.) No bind on equip gear like PC. Can easily gear out a friend, fast, or someone who has transitioned to console from PC, or whatever.  In my honest opinion, console is much more fun and I never thought I'd ever admit that.  Something you may be missing is that the first time you play through on normal difficulty, is rather boring. Nothing intense, no need to watch mechanics. At higher levels you're gonna notice a huge difference.  At the end of the day, D3 just like any Diablo game is really about getting super geared, killing efficiently, and then just min-maxing all of your gear. As far as replayability goes - Diablo 3 preaches this."
diablo3,3dzy0t,badmalloc,2,Tue Jul 21 12:26:17 2015 UTC,"I've played every Diablo game (sans hellfire) and what I like is the continuity of the story, I'm not very fond of D3 because of certain issues but I like it still.  What attracts me to play this games over and over again is the fact that you're a true hero on a noble quest and the feeling of finding amazing loot (I never farm) and, like I said, the story that is very well written and executed.  If you like borderlands, you might like Diablo 2 with the expansion, the classes are unique and can be personalized to fit your play style, the story is AMAZING and online play is optional but fun nonetheless.  It's a little trickier than D3 but you might enjoy it, its actually one of my favorite games ever.  Or maybe its just not your type of game and that's fine too, you're entitled to play what you want and like what you want."
diablo3,3dzy0t,RRUINER,2,Tue Jul 21 13:52:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think you have to like D3, and you shouldn't force yourself to play it if you don't enjoy it. I love it for the grind, the aesthetics, and just for playing around with different builds. That's not everyone's thing, and that's certainly okay.  I also love the Borderlands franchise too, though, but for different reasons. The Borderlands story, to me at least, is just fun in a way that many other game stories aren't. I've read John Shirley's novels, I'm playing the Tell Tale Game series, and I'm partway through Borderlands 2. It's all very immersive and entertaining, but definitely different than D3 in many ways."
diablo3,3dzy0t,izimulation,2,Tue Jul 21 16:11:23 2015 UTC,"For me, what keeps me playing D3 is seeing videos of end-game builds and wanting to get there myself.  Go watch some videos of T6 rift farming (not GRrift or Greater Rift) and watch how they just demolish EVERYTHING with awesome graphics and big explosions and huge damage numbers.  Then look at your noob guy and imagine getting to be that powerful.  To me, that's the draw.  Once I had one guy fully geared up to solo T6 rifts, I kinda lost a lot of interest in the game.  Leveling other guys to do the same is cool for a bit but I sort of achieved my goal so it didn't hold much interest for me.  Now I come back for a week or two every time there's a new season or content patch.  It's entertaining for a time and then I move on.  But that's still a great cycle for such a cheap game.    Regarding the PoE recommendation, I tried it myself and wasn't into it.  It's free tho, so nothing stopping you from seeing for yourself as well."
diablo3,3dzy0t,jinreeko,2,Tue Jul 21 17:38:24 2015 UTC,"I get you. The game can be very bland compared to others, where it turn into just a grind fest.  Lots of people enjoy the ""just one more piece"" addictive nature of finding shiny loot, while others may simply have a game that they can play with their friends and spend time doing that.  Me personally, I like the challenge of trying to get a hardcore character to 70 as fast as possible, meaning putting it on harder difficulties (no cheesing strategies) and then seeing how long I can keep them alive.  If you haven't, you should try a hard core character and see if you get a different satisfaction out of the game."
diablo3,3dzy0t,Kyomaa,4,Tue Jul 21 18:31:49 2015 UTC,"going to have to disagree with you that borderlands 2 combat was ""engaging""  in end-game, all you do is shoot them with any slag weapon and then cheese them to death ... and if you skip the slag part, enemies are just huge bullet sponges. booooring.  the first game got it way better"
diablo3,3dzy0t,Kyomaa,2,Mon Jul 20 23:53:06 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Ultimate vault Hunter mode sucks. I absolutely did not want to slag and spam, as you say.  The first two difficulties were fun though. I actually uninstalled UVHM, and played capped at 50 and enjoyed the game."
diablo3,3dzy0t,SCTetraGamer,0,Tue Jul 21 03:43:09 2015 UTC,"To each their own. I think it's engaging. If you play each class right, and focus on a build that makes the most of their unique action skill, there's a lot of satisfaction in knowing when the perfect times are to use that skill. It's like you connect with the character in a way that just feels right.  Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (which I'm assuming is what you mean by end-game) is DLC anyways. Some don't care to play that mode—or even have the means to—and are satisfied with capping their characters out to 50 instead of 61 or 72. Depending on what package(s) you have installed, 50 is considered a max level.  And sure, it is possible to just spam enemies with bullets, no matter the mode. But in Normal Mode or True Vault Hunter Mode, there are more efficient methods of combat. And figuring out what those are (especially with each class, if you like the game that much) is the satisfying/engaging part. To me, anyway."
diablo3,3e2bc5,llamacub,3,Tue Jul 21 12:22:45 2015 UTC,"i think it rilly depends on what u mean by ""viable"". the builds will be playable. will it clear higher Gr's most likly not. can it be done and not be risky( low moblity higher chance of dieing ) probly not. at the end of the day with the correct gear it can be done it just may be slow ( low dmg ) or risky ( low mobility/high risk of dieing )"

diablo3,3e2bc5,Meglamax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:51:59 2015 UTC,"certainly its a combination. I know there will always be ""cookie-cutter"" builds. I just really hope there will be some new fun way to play the WD. How about Helltooth? Is that set in any good spot?"
diablo3,3e2bc5,obie191970,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:47 2015 UTC,not sure. i havent been on the prt in awile. as for hopeing a build can be fun. i dont see y builds that cant clear the highest difficulty cant be fun. i see it like playing a sub par spec in wow(or another mmo)
diablo3,3e2bc5,obie191970,3,Tue Jul 21 19:17:08 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, T10 is about the equivalent of GR45.  So there will be danger  there, especially on HC."
diablo3,3e2bc5,Thanatos3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:17:29 2015 UTC,"I don't mind dangers, I just hope for a viable build :) I'm sure its possible, it's just a matter of which build it will be. I think right now it's all about shooting darts, and the new items seem to have emphasis on the zombie bears (iirc). Sadly none of these builds are what I'm looking for."
diablo3,3e2bc5,xWhackoJacko,2,Tue Jul 21 18:08:19 2015 UTC,"If it's true that it's only equivalent to GR45, then any build will be viable as long as you have the gear to support the build.  Running a Zuni's build with Dagger of Darts and Carnevil can easily tackle GR45.  Most people run Pirahna's with that build but you could easily swap in Locust Swarm."
diablo3,3e2bc5,CommanderKoolaid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:46:49 2015 UTC,"The problem with that solution is that the darts are still the bread and butter, the locust swarm would just be something extra. I want a build that focuses on locust swarm! :D"
diablo3,3e2bc5,MrSlavi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:50:10 2015 UTC,"I have a Zuni WD right now on live. I cleared a solo 42 grift. So I definitely think with the new cube powers and added items in the new patch, a pet build would be able to do TX since its considered equivalent of grift 45 I think."
diablo3,3e2bc5,Thanatos3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:13:29 2015 UTC,"For grifts, WDs are still probably looking at DoD. However, the recent Helltooth changes, new items, and some number tweaking could make it a viable build for 60+ grifts. We'll have to see.  Other than that, pretty much every set will be viable for t10 I'd imagine. I was doing 40s with pet doc during s3 because I couldn't for the life of me get a Dagger (nevermind an ancient - did finally get one though), and t10 is the equivalent of 45.  Arachyr seems like it'll be a great set for speed farming t10 bounties/rifts or whatever. Quetzacotl in the helm slot, as much Locust Swarm damage as you can, and a 6-piece Arachyr with 2-piece Manajumas and cluck cluck boom dot dot dot cluck cluck boom, repeat. It's certainly our most mobile build option as far as I can tell, and seems really fun.  There could be a world where we could also studder step dot and spam Haunt a long side the 6-piece arachyr (so 2-piece Jade + Quetz + 6-piece Arachyr). Or just round em up with locust swarm, and then chicken in, spirit walk out, spam haunt for anything else alive. I'm just spit ballin', I'll have to give it a shot on the PTR and see how it does. Sounds good in my head at least :)"

diablo3,3e14a8,TheAbyssGazesAlso,8,Tue Jul 21 04:25:30 2015 UTC,"Just make it so you put the runes in Kanai's cube and combine them to create a single ""runeword"" gem which you then socket. Easy."
diablo3,3e14a8,schne867,2,Tue Jul 21 04:40:11 2015 UTC,"The Legendary gems have this function already, just need to do something with legendary gems for weapons. I do love the idea of runewords but they would overlap with the functionality of legendary gems. Runewords only for weapons and leg gems only for jewelry? Might as well just make legendary gems for weapons at that point. That being said, bringing the cube back is really a good move in my opinion."

diablo3,3e1cq3,SMcNu715,2,Tue Jul 21 05:07:20 2015 UTC,"Seasons are competitive ladders for people that want to push higher level greater rifts and see how they stack up against other players doing the same thing.  They reset every few months and your seasonal characters are converted to non-seasonal characters and you keep them and all their gear/stash/etc.  Nothing changes about the character except they are now a non-seasonal and you have to start a new character to play in the next season.  You don't have to be competitive in the ladder to enjoy playing seasonal characters though.  There are other reasons to play in the seasons like access to the newest legendaries that get added each season that can open up new builds to play as well as cosmetic flair rewards.  As for what the ""end-gamers"" are looking forward to?  Next season at this point.  They are adding a new zone in Act 3 Adventure mode that has a quest to unlock the Kanai Cube.  It is similar to the Horadric Cube from Diablo 2.  It will have some special recipes you can craft by placing the required materials inside and clicking a button.  These range from changing 100 of one crafting mat to 100 of another, 9 of one gem to 9 of another, completely rerolling all the stats on a legendary, changing one set item piece to another piece of the same set, removing level requirements from gear, opening portals to the Goblin Vault and 'Not a Cow Level', and possibly the most anticipated recipe is to strip the special effects of legendary items to use as permanent buffs."
diablo3,3e1cq3,Minler,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:06:06 2015 UTC,"Seasons are where you make a character for that season and level it up to 70. On that character you have access to the newest legendaries and stuff. After the season ends the new legendaries are available to regular characters, and your gear and money from the seasonal gets transfered over to your normal characters. Basically it's for if you already have a powerful character and want something new to do. I personally don't do them, I just like to slowly build my normal characters up, its completely optional.  As far as new stuff, a patch is coming out that's going to release a new level or something as well as a new artisan. Plus they're changing the whole keywarden thing I believe so that your keys will become infernal machines, so I've been collecting keys before the patch starts. Overall the game seems to have a bright future imo."
diablo3,3e1cq3,oodydood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:41:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks! So I take it with this next patch, they are taking all the stuff from this past season and putting it in for everyone else. Do you lose the character once the season ends and roll fresh from that point? I don't remember seeing anything about making a ""season""character on the XB1 version, though I may just be blind..."
diablo3,3e1cq3,Ikritz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:09:19 2015 UTC,"You don't lose your Seasonal character, they just become a non-seasonal character at the end. Console will be getting patch 2.3 the same time PC players get it. Also the new artisan gives you access to the Kanai's Cube which will let you unlock the passive abilities of Legendary Items to be used alongside your normal gear. You get access to 1 extra armor slot, weapon slot, and jewelery slot. This will unlock a lot of cool and interesting builds that weren't especially viable before."
diablo3,3e1cq3,oodydood,0,Tue Jul 21 11:42:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, every time a season ends the new gear is available. Yup, you loose the character but keep its gear and accomplishments. I don't think the console versions have that feature yet, they're usually a bit behind PC(I play PC). I'm not sure if consoles are getting the new patch either, they run on a different schedule."
diablo3,3e150s,xSighx,2,Tue Jul 21 03:51:52 2015 UTC,"I would recommend waiting a day or two as Blizzard is wiping the ptr server.

As far as which class to try, the new Archon Wizard build is pretty fun, and is very much about teleporting through walls and nuking stuff."

diablo3,3e150s,Ikritz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:17:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah. With the new six piece bonus on Vyr's, remade chantodo's set, new legendary belt, and using The Swami in Kanai's cube. You need to stack CDR and use obsidian ring of the zodiac but basically you use blizzard with snowbound to get 20 stacks of the Chantodo's buff, then activate Archon and just spam the first ability while holding down the Ray ability. With the new legendary belt every stack of archon gives you 1% damage, attack speed, armor, and resistance. With the Swami passive you get to keep your Archon stacks for an extra 20 seconds. You the spam blizzard again with 1.5 - 2x your normal attack speed and you end up with Archon being back up in about 5-10 seconds as well as 20 stacks of Chantodo's. The Archon stacks from before will stay active for another 20 seconds and overlap with your new Archon stacks giving you about 200-250+. It seems complicated but once you get it working in game it feels pretty awesome. Your archon is passively hitting for over a billion damage aoe every second on top of having slowtime on all the time and being able to teleport every 1.5 seconds. When you get to the rift guardian, they will consistently die in less than a minute using Bane of the Stricken and holding down left click with 300%+ attack speed. Sorry for the long winded explanation, it works much smoother then it sounds and you feel like a magic slinging god running around in Archon 80% of the time."

diablo3,3dzc5m,bkdonkeykong,0,Mon Jul 20 20:14:33 2015 UTC,"zdps build for 30days , 2.3 coming , no expensive to do it"
diablo3,3dzc5m,opelit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:48 2015 UTC,what do you mean?
diablo3,3dzc5m,L1ao,2,Tue Jul 21 03:01:12 2015 UTC,When 2.3 hits the zdps build known as tiki/zuni won't be able to exist as it does now.
diablo3,3dzc5m,AzzyIzzy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:08:28 2015 UTC,Because blizzard thought it was too powerful or what's the reason for the changes (and what makes It useless in 2.3?)
diablo3,3dzc5m,JRoosman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:49:19 2015 UTC,"This doesn't only apply to WD (although we had one of the more powerful and constant uptime for aoe/cc), but ALL CC abilities will be hit by the 90% resist over time from mobs. Basically lets say you have an ability that stuns a single mob  for 5 seconds, the first application will be 100%, but every subsequent application in a given time on the same mob will cause a severe amount of diminishing returns to occur. To the point that 5 second stun turns into a second or less stun.   This causes high level rift CC stacking to be impossible given the higher end play just involved sitting in a group of enemies AoE CC'ing them while another class wailed on them."
diablo3,3dzc5m,AzzyIzzy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:57:50 2015 UTC,but why not? whats changing?
diablo3,3dzc5m,L1ao,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:54:39 2015 UTC,Mobs gain a large amount of CC resistance after every application of CC on that mob for a medium amount of time.
diablo3,3dzc5m,AzzyIzzy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:58:53 2015 UTC,"Oh I see, thank you, so this will be pretty unviable come 2.3?"
diablo3,3dzc5m,L1ao,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:22 2015 UTC,"Like you can still use a base CC as an opener, or an ""oh shit"" button, but otherwise spamming any CC'ing ability is pretty pointless come 2.3."

diablo3,3e0wbz,kaldaris2951,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:23:28 2015 UTC,No armor rolls afaik. You should check d3planner.com for list of possible rolls. It's quite handy for other things too.
diablo3,3dwpdh,TranquilThought,72,Mon Jul 20 04:04:47 2015 UTC,"PTR player here, well I don't really know where to start as there is SO much new in 2.3 but here I go:  1) Puzzle Rings and Bovine Bardiches (polearm) can be transmuted into portals to The Vault and the Cow Level (just put one into the new Kanai's Cube with nothing else). 2) Death's Breaths are used for everything and need to be stockpiled. 3) Crafting will require the new Act mats so get crafting what you want now (Sage's Journey most specificaly for the 3 piece set bonus of extra Death's Breaths). 4) Horadaic Caches can be saved and opened for the new Act mats, this was tested on PTR but unknown if it will transfer to live 5) Start saving up legendaries/set items (anything with ORANGE TEXT) for extraction into Kanai's Cube with bonuses you want, also Kanai's Cube will extract the legendary power (ORANGE TEXT) at max power so that Furnace with +40% elite damage will extract to +50% elite damage in the cube. Note: if you have legacy items with extra power beyond what can roll on current item will not be extract to the extra power. 6) GRift Keys level X and Keys of Trials will turn into GRift keys with no trials needed, the max GRift you can choose is based on the Torment level you are playing on and then the max GRift you have successfully completed. 7) Nephalim Rift keys become vendor trash (500,000 for a stack) and no key is needed anymore for regular Rifts. 8) Some sets bonuses are changing for better, more specifically Shenlong's (Monk Fist weapons) and you can reroll set items into other set items (Focus will ONLY become Restraint and vice versa but NOT anything like The Compact Rose) so save any set items that are bad/sub optimal to try and reroll them into optimal/perfect, crafted set items cannot be rerolled. 9) Keywardens who drop Keys of Bones/Gluttony/War/Evil need to be farmed now as those key will automatically turn into Infernal Machines, also Keywardens will drop Infernal Machines instead of Keys. The super Bosses will drop 2-4 Hellfire mats on Torment 7-10. 10) Kind of useless unless you like leveling multiple characters or you play in Hardcore, but Gems of Ease level 25 can be used to remove level requirements from gear with the Kanai's Cube so if you want to, save them up by placing them on another character and then farm GRifts for multiple.    Now for other changes: 11) Kanai's Cube can be found in Act 3 in the new Ruins of Sescheron zone in Adventure mode. 12) The Bonus Act will rotate after you have finished the Act to a new Act at random, also the Bonus Act will now give a Bonus Cache with extra Act materials so its worth it to finish the Bonus Act. 13) New items will start dropping patch 2.3 specific item are found here and season 3 items are found here (but you really can't farm for them right now) 14) At Torment 7-10 almost every goblin spawn is replaced with a double goblin spawn, Hindering Obstructionist is the only exception I think. Also there are now Bandit Shrines which spawn ~10 goblins so be prepared for a slaughterfest. 15) Reflect Damage...if you play a melee class then your not going to notice a change, if you play ranged you're going to hate the change. It used to be blinking on/off on an entire pack of rare/elite mobs at the same time, now it rotates among the pack so there's no way to avoid it. 16) New bounties have been added to the bounty pool and include stuff like kill X Boss, when you get a kill X Boss bounty and kill the boss afterward you get a Diabolic Hoard chest with a lot of loot (I think 1-2 guaranteed Legendary/Set Items on Torment 7-10). 17) GRift/Rift bosses are much easier to kill and Stonesinger (Rock Boss) no longer has half the HP of other bosses, also Stonesinger's abilities have changed."
diablo3,3dwpdh,eyamxi,3,Mon Jul 20 10:00:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, really informative!"
diablo3,3dwpdh,holobyte,2,Mon Jul 20 10:20:10 2015 UTC,"So reflect damage, it's less damage though I take it? Enough to be able to go balls deep?"
diablo3,3dwpdh,timoseewho,5,Mon Jul 20 12:18:17 2015 UTC,"I believe reflect is about to get a major change. I remember reading a blue post (I cant find it right now, maybe someone else can -- hopefully I wasnt dreaming this) that said that reflect will now reflect back the same elemental type damage that was dealt.  This could have a huge affect on players that run an immunity amulet that is the same as their main damage dealer. Imagine this, a poison WD running a Mara amulet, damage dealt with poison will be reflect back as posion, but since Mara is providing immunity and also healing for a percentage of the damage dealt, we could actually see that reflect is not that big of a deal, and it actually becomes a sort of LoH for fighting elites. That would be really nice. Im eager to see what happens in the next PTR update -- especially with additional WD Arachyr changes/buffs."
diablo3,3dwpdh,goykasi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:18:02 2015 UTC,"Holy cow this would be great. Reflect really needs to be reworked and/or removed.  Even just opting for it to rotate through enemies doesn't really help anyone with aoe attacks. You're still going to hit one of then while they're reflecting.  I've been trying to push my dh into solo grift 50+ but I'm running nats, and at that level any reflect will kill me. Honestly I'm better off just exiting the game and trying a new run, it's so frustrating.  If blizzard doesn't want thorns sets to be viable for players, then why do we need enemies with reflect damage?"
diablo3,3dwpdh,AnalTyrant,2,Mon Jul 20 15:47:00 2015 UTC,"Like I said, maybe I was imagining things (I'm almost positive though), but it could almost make reflect irrelevant for solo play. I think for group play it would be acceptable to reflect on the entire group though. I, as a WD, deal a lot of poison and it reflects/heals me, but it damages others. A fire monk does a ton of fire with dashing strike or EP and they sustain the reflect, but I actually take the fire damage.  It would be an interesting affect to bridge the gap between solo and group play a bit, but groups would still have the advantage by simply having additional players."
diablo3,3dwpdh,goykasi,2,Mon Jul 20 16:05:21 2015 UTC,"I play monk so I'm not too sure on everything with the change, but the reflect damage problem seems to be that the main viable builds for Wizards and Demon Hunters are all glass cannon builds so they can't take ANY damage without dying in one/two shots. Also when you have slow moving missiles or a area DoT effect you can't change their course and see your life steadily fall. They used to be able to avoid it by waiting for it to expire on the pack but not anymore..."
diablo3,3dwpdh,eyamxi,2,Mon Jul 20 13:39:11 2015 UTC,"I find it surprising that blizz would keep the reflect damage the same though   As a DH I know what you mean. I'm currently forced to stop whenever rd is up, but I thought with the change it meant I could go from 4th gear to 3rd the whole time as opposed to 4th to neutral as I do now whenever rd is up"
diablo3,3dwpdh,timoseewho,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:43:28 2015 UTC,"No. They said it would be reflecting the same element of damage dealt, but that it would also be doing more damage."

diablo3,3dwpdh,timoseewho,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:36:44 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate on the Shenlong change? I'm currently using one.
diablo3,3dwpdh,TheObelisk,6,Mon Jul 20 12:51:08 2015 UTC,"Alright, the set bonus right now in 2.2 is some kind of fireball type attack, in 2.3 PTR (right now broken AF) its 1)your spirit generators have 1% increased damage for each point of spirit you have; so 100/200 spirit gives +100% damage to your spirit generators. 2) when you reach max spirit you get a buff that gives ALL damage +300% but drains 65 spirit per second.  Why its broken: spirit is easy to generate if you use Band of Rue Chambers in the cube, Focus and Restraint give another 125% damage and if you use the 6 piece Rainment set then Dashing Strike does 12,500% times 4.25 weapon damage, crits ranges up to the 10 billionish damage. With Flying Dragon in the cube as well you don't lose the increased attack speed, with Spirit Guards in the cube you gain a 40% damage reduction on top of 57% dodge fom class passives and mantras so your toughness shoots to 200 million or so.  Now my math skills may be a little fuzzy so don't trust the accuracy of the numbers above but...with sub-sub-optimal gear, I was auto attacking for 500 million crits (54% crit chance, 500ish% crit damage), criting Dashing Strike at 5-7 billion, while having over 170 million toughness. On live I'm only able to clear GRifts into the 40's, on the PTR I cleared a 53 with no sweat just by changing weapons and cube.  If there's any formatting errors or misspellings then I apologize, I'm on mobile now"
diablo3,3dwpdh,eyamxi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:31:45 2015 UTC,"Sheesh, you have this all down to a science. I'm fairly casual and don't break stuff down like this so maybe it wont be a big deal for me and my playstyle."
diablo3,3dwpdh,TheObelisk,2,Mon Jul 20 13:38:02 2015 UTC,"Or instead of the dashing strike build, you can cube depth diggers, use simplicity's strength, 2 pc raiment and 4 pc innas for 2 billion crits on generator attacks 3 or 4 times/second. Unless flying dragon is up, then its closer to 6 times/sec. Takes less than 10 seconds to kill a TX rift guardian doing nothing but holding down your autoattack button."
diablo3,3dwpdh,Blkwinz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:50:08 2015 UTC,"You know, I actually use (Left Click) Way of a Hundred Fists and (Right Click) Deadly Reach. It's unorthodox on the face of it, but it works out awesome. Way of a Hundred fists gives me an attack speed bonus that stacks likes 3 times, and Deadly Reach gives me a Damage Boost that stacks a few times while also utilizing both the punching frenzy of the 3rd WoHF hit and the large aoe 3rd hit of Deadly Reach that knocks people into the air. I also match these with the Alacrity Passive which gives me 15% Attack Speed on those two spirit generators and Seize the Initiative, Determination, and Resolve. It's working out really well and is really fun to play-- possibly because it's so click intensive. I get lots of fist frenzies and aoe explosions knocking people into the air. I can lay out my clicks in a way where I can pop off a Deadly Reach 3rd hit or WoHF 3rd hit when I want, while still being able to mix more of an aoe style with single-target style. I also have a couple legendary items that make things fun as well, like a belt that does a fan of knives for a lot of damage and a shoulder that throws a knife every attack, and a Wreath of Lightning gem that fries a bunch of dudes whilst I punch them."
diablo3,3dwpdh,TheObelisk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:14:23 2015 UTC,"Good for you finding a build you like, but I'm not sure how viable that will be in the higher difficulties. Especially when you aren't even able to see when your third hits are."
diablo3,3dwpdh,Blkwinz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:00:45 2015 UTC,"I'm in Torment 3 and going strong. Sometimes I do miss my third strikes because my monk slaps people around so fast. But i'll use this as long as it doesn't hold me back. But it's really quite impressive so far. I hit really fast and I have my Seven Sided Strike set to freeze people, so when i'm up against someone who isn't a push-over, I freeze em' and then I slap em' up."
diablo3,3dwpdh,TheObelisk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:19:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the post! This is a fantastic reply.  Question, if i have some Shenlong's now (crap), when 2.3 hits, do they automatically covert to the new ones?"
diablo3,3dwpdh,linchboy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:49:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can transfer your char over to the PTR to double check and see. But there's going to be a wipe soon, maybe tomorrow."
diablo3,3dwpdh,eyamxi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:02:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! I was just wondering what the costs of re-rolling a legendary are? Are we talking along the lines of reforging or much more expensive?
diablo3,3dwpdh,MezzOMG,2,Tue Jul 21 09:27:19 2015 UTC,5 of each Act Mat and 50 Forgotten Souls. If you complete the Bonus Acts in order you get 8 or each mat in T7-10 and significantly less on T6 and below.

diablo3,3dwpdh,Draconax,0,Mon Jul 20 09:44:53 2015 UTC,"This.  Death's Breaths are an absolute necessity for basically everything in the Cube.  25 death's breath to upgrade rare to legendary, 5 to store a passive, 10 to swap set items, etc etc.  Save every last one you can find.  Pop on that Cain's set and get to work."

They become RoS mats after the patch.  2)  Save all Hellfire keys, and farm up new ones.  These will transform directly into machines next patch.  As well, split farming Hellfire keys will be gone next patch, so get it while its hot.  3)  DEATH'S BREATHS.  Seriously.  You need this shit like fucking crazy for anything to do with the Cube.  Save as much as humanly possible.  4)  Stockpile cool legendaries.  Got a shitty immunity amulet?  Who cares!  Finally got that In-Geom, but its got shite stats?  Doesn't matter.  Save everything you can fit.    5)  Puzzle Rings/Bovine Bardiches.  It's come up in this thread already, but both will open new portals to the Greed/Cow realms.  Hang onto em.  6)  Grift keys.  All Grift keys of any level will become the new standard GRift key.    7)  If you're playing Wizard or Witch Doctor, don't be afraid to collect those Helltooth/Vyr's sets in the meantime, as they will update with the patch.  Same goes for the 2pc weapon sets (Chantodo's, Manajuma's, Shenlong's).  Hrm, that's about it off the top of my head."

Make sure you got the same amount of every key. 4 keys will become 4 machines/1 amulet, rather than now when you need 16 keys for 1 amulet. Hellfire will allways roll with primary+socket.

It's waaay overboard, but I'll clean up after I know what the patch has to offer more thoroughly.   Crafting materials will be altered, but I'm not sure exactly how. So who knows if farming them is going to be worth it?  Also, someone told me in-game that his puzzle ring was changed in PTR, and that everyone should be gathering as many as they could.

diablo3,3dzbyg,wankawitz,3,Mon Jul 20 19:25:13 2015 UTC,"Outside of starting a new season at the same time as everyone else, you won't find many people leveling up a new character at the same time as you. Especially if you're playing through the story mode to do so.  Adventure mode is where most people play, and at this point almost nobody is playing at the lower levels.  You can join power leveling communities to get you to 70, and then you can do torment 1 from there to work on gear and get further along."

diablo3,3dyz3o,opelit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:27:24 2015 UTC,"Try going into the nvidia control panel thing, and FORCE it to use the 765m when you launch D3 instead of ""auto select"". It may fuck up and use the onboard HD3000-4000 intel graphics.  It's something like this. When you enter the nvidia control panel, select ""Manage 3D settings"" in the left sidebar. Then choose the tab ""program settings""  From there you can ""Select a program to customize"". Diablo3 should be in the dropdown menu. If not, just click ""Add"" and find the Diablo 3 ros exe, and add it. When its said and done, you can ""2. Select the preferred graphics processor for this program.""

diablo3,3dyz3o,eyamxi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:57:14 2015 UTC,"I play on a laptop with an 870M. I have frame locked the FPS to 60, before I did this I was getting video spikes down in the 20 FPS range. It now runs almost always at 60 with occasional dips to 50ish in extremely crowded areas, but something in Diablo 3 code is buggy and might be overtaxing your graphic card when it doesn't need to. I've also noticed a heat reduction when I do this of about 2-5°C.  Try limiting your FPS to 60 first and see if you have an improvement first before buying a new laptop.  You can also try to buy a better cooling pad depending on the one you have, anything with 3+ 1,000 RPM fans should do the trick and only set you back $20-$30.  As far as limiting your FPS, I am 99% sure your laptop screen has a 60Hz rate and anything over 60 FPS is extraneous. If you are outputting to a TV with a higher Hz then you might want to consider mirroring the screen, most laptops aren't designed for multiple screens simultaneously."

Idk why but the newer blizzard games have a knack for overheating the fuck out of my graphics card to the point where it shuts itself off. Bad game design? maybe. I can run other games like skyrim at full settings at max fps but d3 is just a shitter. Good luck.  The only way I can play d3 for longer periods of time on this laptop is to run everything at low graphics settings and limit the FPS around 20-30. And I tell you, it's a shitty gaming experience. Although you really don't need much skill to play d3 anyway. I made it to top 100 HC monk this past season with this garbage performance"
diablo3,3dyz3o,Agro_Phobia,0,Mon Jul 20 23:32:45 2015 UTC,"Take your laptop apart and clean out all and any dust that is inside, laptops are prone to sucking in dust which prevents correct air flow causing overheating.

Wait for the next patch release, which should be in a few weeks. This will start a new season (3) and add lots of excellent game improvements."
diablo3,3dz5v9,P1nkpanth3r,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:45:31 2015 UTC,quick correction next season is season 4  aside from that i second everything you said. i would advice op to maybe try doing some rifts and grifts while he waits for new season so he gets the hang of it and doesnt get surprised by it on next season.
diablo3,3dz5v9,GenHawke,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:52:48 2015 UTC,Maybe after 2.3. But the game with ROS is much better than when it was launched imo. I had a couple of hundreds hours playing ROS and I think it's fun.
diablo3,3dz5v9,RedVitamin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:51:22 2015 UTC,"I just started playing again about a week ago. I can tell you a few things that are pretty relevant.  Firstly, the rift and greater rift system is a million times better than Baal runs ever were. It even makes sense the way the leaderboard works because all we were doing to get to 99 in D2 was Baal Runs anyway, so timing who does the hardest and fastest equivalent is just giving us what we were already asking for.   Second, the new gems that you can get from rifts look like they give a lot of interesting customization to builds. I don't know if it is as much as we had in D2, but it's definitely close. There's a lot of cool gear that encourages different builds past the basic new ""I'm this element"" build. The enchantress also makes rerolling specific buffs on gear is really great, and lets you do something with all of the crafting stuff you find.   Lastly, fuck Blizzard and the PS/Xbox version of this game. I will always hold it against them that I can't play with 7 of my friends anymore, and it's even worse that I can't get every class into the same game at once. I always felt that this was a concession to the console port and they got too lazy to up the player count. Also, trading is still stupid because of this. They tuned everything for playing alone or only with the other 3 people in your game. I can only trade this to the other people that were there when it dropped? How dumb is that? I really despise the fact that the console version, which actually looked like a lot of fun, had such a glaring impact on my favorite PC game of all time's successor.   All in all, it's fun. I have been enjoying it. I just leveled a brand new Hardcore character to 70, and I might make another one pretty soon. I don't know if my zeal will die before the big August patch they have planned, but that will certainly renew it. I would say buy it. It is a solid 20 dollar purchase."
diablo3,3dz5v9,Zamite,0,Mon Jul 20 18:55:38 2015 UTC,"1) The games is completely different to launch, there are actually goals and challenges now (Grifts) compared to just farming Act III over and over.  2) Yes, ROS was a game changer for D3 IMO.  3) Use it as a filler game, I couldn't play it constantly for weeks on end but it's a great game to fill a gap if a new title isn't out for a few weeks. I always find myself coming back to D3 despite what I was playing before."
diablo3,3dz72q,Stillhart,6,Mon Jul 20 18:49:43 2015 UTC,"There's pros and cons to each game. If you're looking for mindless smashing, stay with D3. PoE is very very very in-depth. It's not a game you can just dive in and play. You'll need some guidance either online or from a friend but once you get into it, it has its strengths compared to D3. But everyone agrees that if both games were to have a baby, that would be the ultimate game :)"
diablo3,3dz72q,evolutionvi,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:58:08 2015 UTC,Can you expand on what you feel are its strong points compared to D3?  Like what would be the best to see added to D4?
diablo3,3dz72q,lmAtWork,7,Mon Jul 20 19:28:21 2015 UTC,"Build diversity, there are hundreds of builds viable in PoE and a grand total of like 1 or maybe 2 per class in Diablo 3.   Also End game is far better in PoE.   The game is honestly just better all around in everything but graphics"
diablo3,3dz72q,that1dev,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:52:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll read up on the PoE endgame to see what that's all about."
diablo3,3dz72q,that1dev,4,Mon Jul 20 20:53:53 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge poe player who also enjoys D3 in the downtime between content releases. I like the complexity of PoE. The huge skill tree, along with the hundreds of gems you can put in thousands of combo's make your character yours. Build it how you like. I also personally prefer the combat of PoE to D3, just because it seems you have far more agency in how the fight plays out. Wallers, jailers, and that stuff is no fun to me. I also find, in a way I can't really explain, poes progression to be better.   That's not to say I don't like Diablo, and it does have certain pros. Much better graphics, much simpler for when that's what I'm looking for, and still tons of fun."
diablo3,3dz72q,lilrabbitfoofoo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:04:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing your view.  Do you think ""building it how you like"" is really viable?  I am not a min/maxer for the most part, but I don't want to build a broken character that won't be able to progress past a certain point."
diablo3,3dz72q,0ILERS,2,Mon Jul 20 20:46:12 2015 UTC,"It naturally depends.  Just like in diablo, you can build a PoE character that can't progress past a certain point.  I would say that it is easier to build a ""stranded"" character in PoE than in diablo, and it can be stranded earlier, simply because you have more rope to hang yourself.  However, there are many many many off meta builds that will let you experience endgame content, even if you can't do the very top levels.  PoE endgame is called ""maps"", similar to grifts.  Some characters may only be able to do the first one or two thirds of map tiers unless they overlevel it significantly, but plenty of them do just fine throughout.    Diablo is the same, my leaping spider frozen piranha WD from season 1 wasn't going to be doing grift 40's anytime soon.  However, in diablo, you won't strand a character in the equivalent of Diablo lvl 60 very easily, and you can in PoE.  Trade offs.  PoE takes more investment, but when I play, I feel more rewarded for that investment."
diablo3,3dz72q,0ILERS,8,Mon Jul 20 22:06:34 2015 UTC,"PoE is D3 for serious, adult players.  The true successor to Diablo 2.  I play D3 when I want to just casually, mindlessly smash something.  When I want to really get into a game, I play PoE.  PoE can absolutely be intimidating when you start it...especially the currency/trading approach.  Give it a bit more time and you may find, like many of us do, that PoE is the best Action RPG ever created.  Which doesn't fill the same niche as D3, which is more of an Arcade RPG.  And note that D3 only became a truly ""good"" game about a year ago.  The good news is that D3 is clearly on its way to becoming a great game too."
diablo3,3dz72q,hsmith711,4,Mon Jul 20 18:56:37 2015 UTC,"This perfectly sums it up, IMO. I enjoy D3, but it's a completely different game. You can get boosted to max level in an hour and tag along with friends to get great gear that's always a guaranteed drop. Awesome if you just want to mindlessly destroy things and not have to work too hard for it. PoE is exactly what you said, a true D2 successor. I just got back into it this weekend for the new expansion and I spent the entire weekend leveling my character and I'm only level 55. I've been playing off and on for a couple years and I'm still a little intimidated by how trading works. I have a stash full of crap that I'm not even sure is worth anything. But that's half the fun, IMO."
diablo3,3dz72q,hsmith711,0,Mon Jul 20 19:20:56 2015 UTC,"I tried checking their reddit and a few other places and couldn't find anything that made it less intimidating to get into.    The biggest fault?  Lack of respeccing.  I read somewhere that if you screw up your build,you can respec a little, but you're better off just restarting.  That's a MASSIVE no-no in my book.    I've got a job and a family and I don't have time to play a game knowing I could paint myself into a corner.  I'm sure I already screwed up my first character by randomly picking talents that looked interesting with the naive belief that modern games don't let you do that anymore.  Can you expand on what makes it so good for you?"
diablo3,3dz72q,lilrabbitfoofoo,6,Mon Jul 20 19:10:32 2015 UTC,"There are so many VERY indepth builds/guides on the official PoE forums. Have a peek on there and pick something that looks good to you, most guides have videos so you can see them in action. Once you have chosen a build, follow their talent tree that they link. Most guides even give you a ""leveling guide"" for where to put your talent points every 10, 15, 20 levels etc."
diablo3,3dz72q,htraos,5,Mon Jul 20 19:24:27 2015 UTC,"You get 15+ respec points just from quests in the game. Along with orbs of regret that allow you to respec a point each one... and you can trade for more. You can easily swap out 20+ points once you hit level 60 plus.   The only way you need to start from scratch is if you want to make an entirely differently type of build.. like going from melee to ranged or maybe armor based to evasion based. Even then, if you are really committed to your character, you can generally respec. Also.. every major patch or any patch that has significant changes to the tree everyone gets a full respec.   Respec is not an issue. It would be like saying you don't want to play D3 because if you level a Monk and later decide you want to be a Wizard you have to re-roll."
diablo3,3dz72q,lilrabbitfoofoo,-2,Mon Jul 20 19:16:21 2015 UTC,"That doesn't really make much difference.  If you're the type of person who gets paranoid about this kind of thing, it can be really stressful.  Like that time you played hours and hours of <pick a game> only to not be able to pick a lock that you needed to get to the next section.    Anyways, can you expand on what you like about it (over D3) more specifically?  Is it just the wider variety of builds?  Do you like micromanaging your gems and gear?  The economy more interesting?"
diablo3,3dz72q,Pool_Boy,5,Mon Jul 20 19:27:45 2015 UTC,"The economy more interesting?   There is no economy in D3 -- They removed it. So yes, the economy in PoE is more interesting.   Do you like micromanaging your gems and gear?   I don't consider it micromanaging.. I consider it having more control over my build.. so I guess, Yes.   Is it just the wider variety of builds?   Yes, PoE has a lot more variety of builds.   As I said above, you really only need a new character for major changes. Like changing classes in D3. In the new expansion of PoE, I am playing a spell caster. I could change my build to use almost any variation of cold, fire, or lightning skill... but if I wanted to swing a 2H weapon instead, it would be easiest to just roll a new character."
diablo3,3dz72q,lmAtWork,3,Mon Jul 20 19:35:03 2015 UTC,"Because the Skill Tree evolves, respecs are granted every few months, one way or another.    Play the game long enough to get good at it and no matter what directions you go, you'll be able to optimize with a respec in the very near future.  PS  You can play the game just for fun and while it may not be 100% tweak/optimized that won't make that much difference unless you decide to climb the end game ladders."
diablo3,3dz72q,CarpetPuncher,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:23:48 2015 UTC,My biggest problem with PoE is you can't (realistically) rebuild your character from scratch.  How do you play around that?
diablo3,3dz72q,subsoniclight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:27:56 2015 UTC,"You get a FULL respec every patch update...every few months.  Not just a point or two (which the game already has currency for), but a full respec of the tree from scratch.  This is the very definition of ""rebuild your character from scratch""."
diablo3,3dz72q,dmblue,2,Tue Jul 21 23:48:55 2015 UTC,"PoE does have a steep learning curve, but if you put in the time it is very rewarding. If you are worried about messing up your build, just follow a guide. By the time you reach end game you will have a better understanding of what makes that build viable. If you don't follow a guide, you will probably mess up your first character; just make sure you learn from your mistakes and have fun."
diablo3,3dz72q,czartaylor,2,Mon Jul 20 19:28:28 2015 UTC,"I have over 500 hours in Diablo 3 and I just started Path of Exile a few weeks ago and already have 100 in it. PoE is better by far honestly.   I love Diablo, but it's so basic and simple compared to PoE. PoE is definitely has a MUCH higher skill ceiling but it has so much more . . .everything, than Diablo does. That's the problem with Diablo  A patch comes out and you play it for two weeks, then go back to other games"
diablo3,3dz72q,htraos,3,Mon Jul 20 21:00:09 2015 UTC,I couldn't get into PoE either. It felt clunky. The animations were odd. The skill tree made me need another dose of ritalin.

diablo3,3dz72q,Tergumea,2,Mon Jul 20 18:54:33 2015 UTC,"I have played both extensively, and  I have to say that I generally prefer diablo 3 over poe, although I am playing a lot of the the Awakening.   In my mind, there are a number of flaws with poe that make it a worse game than d3. I think that if ggg fixed those flaws poe could be a lot better than d3, but as it stands, no. The reliance on the economy more than anything else (if your goal is to acquire the best gear possible, you do it by not playing poe at all. Playing poe is inefficient when you could be flipping items and make drastically more currency than anyone actually playing the game), the builds are boring and stale (lets be honest here, most builds in poe have 2 buttons, a mobility skill and their all in 1 attack skill. Most builds in poe never use more than that one skill because there's no reason to: Why would I ever use 2 or more skills when I can use 1 and do better than the 2+ builds, and everything else can be automated, but there's no reason not to automate everything, it's actually better to have everything automated than to have to do it yourself, see herald of thunder curse on hit set ups as opposed to hard casting the curse), the build choice concept is an illusion (the game pretends that it has 30 some skills, but most skills functionally act like one another. The only difference between ice crash cyclone ground slam is the aoe. The only difference between cleave reave sweep is the animation and what weapon you can use, most spells are similar, etc. The only difference is in base numbers aoe and elemental types, which essentially translate to clear speed. Bow builds have the best build variety, tornado shot acts little like explosive arrow which acts little like poison arrow, but everything else acts similar to something else), ggg's balancing is atrocious at best (this is the greatest thing that d3 ever did: infinite difficulty scaling. In poe, because there is a difficulty ceiling, anything that hits that ceiling needs to promptly be nerfed into the ground.), the legacy system is one of the worst systems I've ever seen, the temp leagues are what the game's balance around despite the fact that (and the numbers support this) the majority of players play in standard, so it leads to wonky balancing where people in temp leagues are fine but standard is fucked, and this discounts the fact that most temp leagues are boring as shit and lose playerbase rapidly over a month or two after release (most of the std ones are flat out just loot pinatas minus the loot, the hardcore ones are always the ones that change the game, but most poe players don't actually play hardcore, so its just kinda wasted)  Esssentially, the core difference between diablo 3 and poe is that ggg has a vision about what they want their game to be, and anything that contradicts this must not be even if the community is overwhelmingly against it (see the enlighten change, the map change, etc), whereas blizzard asks the consumer what they want their game to be and balances accordingly. It results in d3 getting better and better by the patch, and poe dying slowly patch by patch (seriously, take a look at poe's steam charts of players. the drops between patchs is insane). Even when ggg does something great they still manage to screw it up, see divination cards, where the point was to introduce alternate ways of farming items and weaken the reliance on trading, but because ggg loves the market too much, they set the drop rate on cards so high that it's still more efficient to be farming currency  and before anyone comments on oh well you werent playing the game right or you weren't good enough, I have currency to make any build I want in path at any point. I've had rf incinerators, crit and non crit busaws, srs, ll bm st, kinetic blast, poison arrow, mjolnir builds,everything meta and quite a few custom builds, right now Im playing just a generic cycloner because everything else is boring. I've tried almost everything poe has to offer, the only thing I haven't done is uber atziri, and I doubt I ever will."
diablo3,3dz72q,hsmith711,0,Mon Jul 20 23:23:01 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem with PoE is you can't (realistically) rebuild your character from scratch. When I first played the game the ""re-spec orb"" was very rare.  How do you play around that?  Also, what's the legacy system?"
diablo3,3dz72q,Tergumea,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:31:59 2015 UTC,"whenever they decide an item is nuts and needs to be nerfed, they don't nerf existing copies, only new dropping copies. So basically it just screws anyone who didnt have one before the nerf, everyone else is fine"
diablo3,3dz72q,hsmith711,-7,Tue Jul 21 06:02:23 2015 UTC,Everyone over 18 I know prefers PoE.. everyone under 18 I know prefers D3 or Torchlight 2.   All of the games are fun.. but they are geared towards different audiences. I think D3 and PoE have done a really good job of giving their core playerbase the game they want.
diablo3,3dz72q,Zoelotron,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:02:30 2015 UTC,"Age has nothing to do with it. I am 24 years old and have spent almost to much time enjoying D3 since the release. I love it. There has been some flaws all along though and I have always been kind of sad about the fact that it's so different from the previous Diablo games. Then I discovered poe. The game play and skill tree is flawless. The fact that you can take almost any item and (with enough sockets) make it into your best gear ever, is fantastic. There is so much to do and so much to explore as for your gear,  skills and specs. And everybody keep saying that the graphics sucks -  have you looked properly? It's unbelievably beautiful. Act 3 is freakin awesome. Zoom in, look around and you'll see.  I understand all games isn't for everyone, but give poe a descent chance and hopefully you'll love it."
diablo3,3dz72q,hsmith711,-3,Tue Jul 21 02:10:39 2015 UTC,I think you responded to the wrong person. I'm on your side about PoE.. and I'm the one that said everyone I know 18+ prefers PoE.. so you fit that claim.

I still play Diablo because it's a damn good game that fits me perfectly but I also like and enjoy poe, mainly because it has some of those components that I longed for with d3 before release but never got. I'm 24 years old and like both games equally because poe has qualities that d3 doesn't and vice versa. What I also mentioned was that poe needs time.  You have to learn and understand everything and it might take time if you are used to d3,  but not hard once you understand it. If you like it or not is a nother matter, and has little to do with your age but what game type you prefer. I have siblings and cousins under the age of 18 that plays poe without struggle, though it took some time explaining how everything works."

diablo3,3dz72q,rogergamer,-3,Mon Jul 20 19:13:34 2015 UTC,Being 38 doesn't mean you can't like D3. It doesn't mean you will like PoE.   PoE has systems and mechanics that appeal to a more adult audience (especially those looking to relive the nostalgia of D2). D3 has systems and mechanics that are designed to appeal to a younger audience.  Both are successful.
diablo3,3dz72q,Carstieboy,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:20:48 2015 UTC,Can you give examples?  I can't help feeling like there's a subtle insult in there somewhere that you're trying to dance around.  Like D3 is a simplistic kids game and PoE requires thought and skill.
diablo3,3dz72q,javolug,2,Mon Jul 20 19:24:37 2015 UTC,"D3 is a more visceral experience and has a substantially different feel from D2, combat has more visual feedback, cast times are generally faster, and choices can be revoked at basically any time.  PoE looks, feels, and acts more or less exactly the way you would expect a next generation D2 to look, feel, and act; graphical improvements without a substantially different vibe, although with a lot more depth than d2 in most dimensions.  If you weren't quite born or just recently born when d2 was released, there's a significant chance that a d2 successor wouldn't appeal to you at all, and obviously people who haven't played d2 don't exactly have an itch to scratch for a game that's like d2."

diablo3,3dyoj4,nobbie1,4,Mon Jul 20 16:41:40 2015 UTC,"It would probably lead more towards Inarius. He was ""the Prophet.""  ""To counter the Triune, he took on the mantle of ""the Prophet"" and formed his own gospel, disseminating it from his Cathedral of Light. With this act, the secret war for mankind's soul had begun, a struggle that would come to be known as the Sin War.""  ""Mephisto took Inarius to the Burning Hells. He bound Inarius with tremendous chains and slowly tore the wings from the back of the angel. Great barbed hooks were then used to stretch out his once glowing skin and his features were distorted by vile powers. Now, Inarius is said to be trapped in Hell within a chamber of mirrors, his eyelids torn from his face as he is forced to gaze upon his misshapen form for all eternity. This remains true to this day.""  It could also deal with Lilith coming back into play from being banished to the Void."
diablo3,3dyoj4,BFDonkey,2,Mon Jul 20 20:09:57 2015 UTC,"I agree completely.  My thought is that Inarius has escaped some how, and at the same time he has become corrupted. RoS put a heavily emphasis on how all humans have a piece of demon (evil) within them, and that the Nephalem can potentially become corrupted because of that, etc. etc.  How ever, the same can be made true for pure beings - I don't know if anyone here would recall Izual from DIablo 2, but they give a relatively brief description of him and describe how he became captured, tortured, and eventually corrupted by the prime evils. What's interesting about this is that after you kill Izual he seems to re-appear in angelic form, and eventually vanishes. His soul seemingly ""healed"" or at the very least free'd, and sent off.  But in D3 in the High Heavens act we see him again, once more in his corrupted demon form.  So by that logic, I'm thinking that Inarius likely was able to resist his captors, but through time and enough power he had become corrupted - like Izual. Further, it would help explain why he was never reborn, because if Izual can be seemingly free'd but summoned right back as he were - why wouldn't that be true for Inarius.  Inarius, as the prophet will attempt to corrupt the Nephalem into destroying both Angels and Demons."

diablo3,3dz2pi,tnguye56,2,Mon Jul 20 18:19:51 2015 UTC,Well if it's anything like D2 Blizzard is watching and waiting to ban in a huge wave. Banning small amounts of people fast gives the bot developer time to react and save his customers while holding off and banning a huge wave leaves him in an uncomfortable position.
diablo3,3dz2pi,MiCoHEART,2,Mon Jul 20 21:36:56 2015 UTC,"Why didn't you just use google? It's the number one hit used by like 50,000+ people.   They are using ros-bot, all day, every day. I don't feel bad giving out the information when it's that easily accessible.   I won't use it, I have too much invested. I hope they will get banned (and every member of a clan that is heavily using it - like ten members or more), they just don't seem to be so far.   It is not safe. Blizzard has a tendency of waiting to catch as many people as possible and not ban smaller groups of people. I'm not sure what they are waiting for but they probably have a list of all the offenders. I tell myself that right now because I'm in a relatively optimistic mood. In a different mood I might suspect there were some legal proceedings I don't understand and they can't ban anymore. In a bad mood I might say they don't care or realize the impact.   The system they use to check for bots is mostly unavoidable. I'm not going to go into details, but I was curious as you were and found the whole thing fascinating.   Don't bot unless you don't care about your account. If your luck is like mine, they'll ban the day after you start using it."
diablo3,3dz2pi,himthatspeaks,2,Mon Jul 20 18:39:50 2015 UTC,"TurboHUD was never banned despite one of the top players on the leaderboards posting on the forums that they used it to cheat the way to the top. They BLATANTLY said that. On the offical forums. Nothing happened.   Bots aren't going to be banned. They don't effect much besides whether you get into the top leaderboards or not, and the people who get to the top on the leaderboards are the people who have 20 hours a day to grind away at gear and Keystones to get the perfect rift either way.   I don't bot, but I don't think it's that big of a deal"
diablo3,3dz2pi,lmAtWork,2,Mon Jul 20 21:04:42 2015 UTC,"bots don't affect much??? the entire game is farming and that's all bots do.  turbohud doesn't control you character for you. bots give you crazy xp, infinite keys for fishing rifts and targeted item farming while u fap   I'm a top50 dh at paragon 850. I play a lot but im not ultra hardcore and I know I would finish much higher if I had a couple 100 more paragons nvm all the other botter benefits"
diablo3,3dz2pi,norgridwilliams,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:11:37 2015 UTC,"Paragons are the only difference, and they only effect the super high end as you said. Bots really only make a difference for the top hundred or so players on the leaderboards. The other tens of thousands of players aren't effected by them at all.   Bots shouldn't be in the game, but don't really bother me either way"
diablo3,3dz2pi,lmAtWork,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:15:49 2015 UTC,"still not sure why you say it's not a big deal. it's not just paragons. if you want to tell your bot to stash all ancient kridershots that it finds between 1am and 6pm while u sleep/work, it does that. if you want your bot to farm shards and gamble quivers all night it does that. if you don't like running bounties no problem, it does that too. it's only going to get worse because of how powerful farming bounties is in the next patch.  and it's not just top 100 that get impacted. if you are in the top 1100 you could not be on the leaderboard because people in the top 1000-500 got there because they bot.   also the number of top level players and streamers has a correlation to the popularity of the game. if quin left or if kripp came back that affects how many casuals there are queuing to play with you and the amount of video content there is to help you enjoy the game better  how is this less actionable or less of an impact than the bloodshard exploit? it's one thing if bliz just doesn't care but if they are going to take action on minor gains from exploiting a bugged bloodshard game mechanic they have to act when their game is getting hijacked by botters"

I can play maybe a few hours during the week and maybe a block of 3-4 hours on the weekends, and I've never seen anything that made me think bitters were ruining my experience.  I know I'm not getting on the leaderboards, so I feel no pressure there to compete, but that's the only place I could see botting give some impact to other competitors. Is it the several extra hundred paragon levels that makes them outpace a more casual player like me?  Otherwise, a botter doesn't have any impact on the (nonexistent) economy and no impact on the (effectively nonexistent) PvP, which seems like the only place it would impact other players in other video games.  Since the end-game is almost entirely RNG-based I guess there is an advantage in having more hours clocked to give you more chances of finding better gear.  Maybe Blizz is addressing this with the new cube, allowing players a bit more direct impact on their own gear through rerolling gear and stuff."
diablo3,3dz2pi,AnalTyrant,3,Mon Jul 20 19:23:31 2015 UTC,"The negative effects are that it's poisoning the community and, if left as is, will degrade the player base. Less people playing = more boring for you. If you want to compete in season, why bother when everyone bots (assuming, like me, you have a conscience and refuse to do it).   I hope everyone botting gets a permaban before end of season. This will scare them all, next season, from botting. From what I understand, there is a TON of botting happening (people with 20hours + per day played on average since season started...) and its pointless to try to compete in season (non-hardcore). I haven't logged in, in a few weeks. Not only because of the botting issue, but this season is way to damn long."

There are streamers that make most of, if not their entire, living off of streaming their gameplay.  People like gabynator spend around 20 hours per day (or at least he used to a few months back, I haven't kept up) playing, all day long, on stream. That's how he was the first to hit p1000, and how he continuously has high-ranked characters across a couple classes.  He doesn't seem to be impacted by bots. I don't think botters are even keeping up with him.  Personally I just don't care if other people bot, but I guess that's just the nature of my exposure to the game. Everything I do is mostly just so I can play with a couple friends from time to time. We're not clearing grift 60+ or anything, just having some fun gearing up and doing our own things.  Outside of rankings on a leaderboard there really is no competition in this game."
diablo3,3dz2pi,AnalTyrant,5,Mon Jul 20 20:16:47 2015 UTC,"Quin69 got first paragon 1000. It was him and Higgs competing on their streams. Gaby got rolled back for exploiting, otherwise he would have been.   From what I've heard, Gaby is botting, which is how he's getting 20 hour/day. He hasn't averaged that while live, on stream (bleh, he's soo boring to watch, never talks, better off with Quin or datmodz). Though, this is hearsay, he is known for exploiting, wouldn't doubt it.  I don't know how the bots work, exactly, or what their capable of, but if they can do bounties and t6, that would give them a huge advantage, gear-wise. If you told it to only pick up, say, wands. You'd eventually end up with numerous versions of the wand you want and, eventually, a GG one. Weapon is single most important item on your character and can be game changing. Most players have to settle with a good non-ancient or a mediocre ancient one.   Once botting becomes common place in a game (and not dealt with), I get discouraged and stop playing (I don't even bother playing FPS games anymore). It's unfair and unsportsmanlike.  Edit: Sorry, didn't know you meant world first p1000. This season, Quin was."
diablo3,3dz2pi,xhopesfall24,2,Mon Jul 20 20:24:42 2015 UTC,"Some of the elite players and streamers may not directly be using bots, but they may be relying on other players running bots. For example, one player runs bots generating trial stones and 41 keys all night. They boot up their account, invite streamer or elite players and they are now running much more efficient than the casual player. Botting has a far bigger impact than you think and it impacts you.   Another place it affects you is respect. Lets say I hit 52 on my barb. That's washed out and not even on the leaderboards. If people say, ""Hey, how do I build my barb?"" they're not really going to listen to you. If you were say top 500, where you should be with no bots, they'd put a lot of stock into what you say. So in that sense, it affects casual payers as well.   Bottom line, bots have no place. It should by humans and humans and thats it. You don't like farming trial stones, don't. You don't like ranking them don't. You don't like farming paragon, loot, whatever, don't. But don't run bots for the things you don't like and only play the things you like and expect respect. Well they still get the respect. I had a guy on my friend's list I later found out was botting. He hit 100 and wanted congratulations for it.

diablo3,3duovs,bphone13,4,Sun Jul 19 17:32:21 2015 UTC,"I actually have the same laptop and used it to play Diablo 3 and League for the past month while I went out of state to visit some family. I do have 2 extra GBS of RAM though and a 1TB instead of 500GB. I believe my CPU is clocked higher as well, but I'm not 100% on that.  To answer your question it will play the games you want to play on it, however, you have to have it plugged into the wall running the ""High performance"" setting. It's literally the difference between 30FPS in League unplugged and 60FPS while plugged in. Mind you, it's not going to Max anything, you have to run it low on every game.  A small issue I've noticed (My friend has too, we have the same model but he has the i-5) is that when you're playing with high visual impact characters, specifically Tal-Rasha Wizards, my FPS would drop to 10-25 and would stutter horribly.  Besides that it's a pretty great Laptop, I've had mine for 2 years now and it still runs like a champ. Battery life is quite abysmal when gaming without the charger though, only lasting 30 minutes to an hour. Normal use is 2-4 hours on battery saving with the lighting set down all the way. It can run some pretty surprising games though, I managed to play 17 hours on Sleeping Dogs on Low settings @ 30 fps with almost no stutter just fine. If you have any other questions let me know!  EDIT: Intel UMA = Integrated GPU for that generation of CPU, so in this laptops case its the Intel HD 4000."

I honestly think they should just make it against the rules and auto-delete posts asking for a power level. It would clear a lot of the junk out of this subreddit.

diablo3,3dv4jw,markgarland,6,Sun Jul 19 19:44:41 2015 UTC,"Hey, you had a few good questions. The campaign enables you to enter Adventure Mode. Adventure mode is the ultimate Endgame right now though it doesn't really end per se. The first time you complete the campaign you may not even be level 70 but that's not a problem.  After you finish the campaign you can enter Adventure mode with randomized Monsters/events that are played on the Boards/Maps in the campaign. Dungeons are random and there are several difficulties you can scale up through.   There are also events called Nephilim rifts, these rifts have a high legendary item drop rate and offer randomized dungeons with different boards/monsters and a Final Boss once you reach a certain percentage of completion(Killing mobs)  There are also Greater Rfits which are timed/Leaderboard enabled versions of regular Rifts. No items drop off mobs due to the timed nature but you get a sweet payout once you kill the boss. If the greater rift is too hard and you cant finish it in the time limit you still get to kill the boss.  If you enjoy a character keep playing it, you will keep climbing in level(Paragon levels after level 70), experiment with Legendary item effects and different set bonuses.   Seasons are all of this in a smaller time window with increased XP and legendary drops as well as some Season unique items. You start the season with no levels, no artificers, no paragon, so everyone is equal and you ""race"" for leaderboard spots and achievements. This is the ""Ranked"" play in Diablo 3 and Seasonal characters can be Hardcore or Normal"
diablo3,3dv4jw,Drakenking,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:16:01 2015 UTC,Does the fact that I have no one to play with except my girlfriend (every once in a while) going to hinder me? Or can you get by in this game solo dolo?
diablo3,3dv4jw,Drakenking,3,Mon Jul 20 02:52:01 2015 UTC,You can get by perfectly fine solo but the game makes it really easy to find a pug group and all the loot that drops is yours alone. There are some benefits to drop rates in multi-player but solo is fine.
diablo3,3dv4jw,Saedisi,2,Mon Jul 20 03:04:53 2015 UTC,"you can solo or play with your g/f no prob. It's all about fun. If you look at the leaderboards you can see how far people make it solo in greater rifts.   It's all about what you want out of the game. I usually have a movie or show on my second monitor and just use D3 to chill out.   Solo you can still easily max out your gear and experience all of the game. But if you want the social aspect, just join a random game."
diablo3,3dv4jw,Lovurr,3,Tue Jul 21 00:42:20 2015 UTC,"Playing the game and learning as you go along is probably the best way to do it. also, I would play the story first(because immersion) and if you don't like it, go to adventure mode. There are toggleable help/tips&tricks windows on PC, not sure about consoles though."
diablo3,3dv4jw,Saedisi,2,Sun Jul 19 20:02:44 2015 UTC,"Also note that the best gear only drops in Torment 1 and higher difficulties. Basically end game is gearing up your character to be the most bad ass as possible.   to accomplish this gearing up, there is adventure mode with bounties, rifts, and greater rifts.   bounties give you specific items and keys to enter rifts.  Rifts are kill x amount of mobs before a boss. Kill it and get loot. Also rifts drop more legendaries. Rift guardians have a chance to drop trial key stones  Trial keystones allow you to enter Greater rifts. These are timed and greater rifts drop legendary gems. They are socketed into rings/amulets. These are upgraded via ever higher levels of greater rifts."

For an example, on torment 6 you will 100% get a legendary from the bounty stashes. On Torment 1 I think it's a 25% chance."

I let the time run down so I only get to the next level.  That way I can collect the gems also since it seems one of those is guaranteed.    My question is, what is the advantage to pushing my limits?  Like why should I skip grift levels as opposed to going one level at a time?  Are the drops better?  Will I have a lower drop rate if I keep farming lower levels?    I am pretty new and have decent dps, but I definitely need new gear.  Also really frustrating trying to get a RoRG..."

diablo3,3dskop,MSWGames,2,Sun Jul 19 01:26:12 2015 UTC,"My opinion for you. Just pick a class and stick with it. There will always be the ""optimal build"" that has the most success in torment modes. If you want to enjoy the game, don't look up builds online.    Pick a class and play it. Experiment with the skills, try different combos, grind out that gear. That's what the game is all about."
diablo3,3dskop,stevbrisc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:39:30 2015 UTC,"Well, that's what I've been doing and so far it's just not working out. I'm not looking for the ""Best Class"" or the Flavor of the month. I'm just trying to get feedback that might help me make a decision on what's right for me. I know I talk about viability, but that doesn't mean I want the best class with the best spec, just something that's not going to just get steamrolled all the time, which may not happen with any class, i don't know.   I've never really been the type to play the most popular or the cookie cutter class. I don't find it enjoyable to play what everyone else is playing. I'm just having a hard time choosing what's right for me. I may just need to sink more time into it in general and play everything at some point. Shrug  To be clear, as an added note. I don't expect people to tell me what I'm going to enjoy the most. Above, I posted my experience so far and am seeking people's opinions and suggestions, then taking that information to come up with a gameplan that will better fit my needs. Rather than making one of the millions of posts where people simply ask what's best, I wanted to provide what I've done so far in hopes that more informed and accurate information could be relayed back to me.   =D"

diablo3,3dskop,Jerkalerka,2,Sun Jul 19 21:32:14 2015 UTC,"Most endgame builds is about using the same skill over and over. Id say go WD jade harvester or Wizard Talrasha for most diversity. They depend on using lots of different skills at the right time.   Diversity on barbs is hard cause his sets increase the dmg of specific skills. Best choice would be IK and experiment from there as you'd allways have WOTB up plus 100% increased dmg.   I liked DH until the multishot took over, cant play that anymore as the multishot doesnt go through walls, yet the animation does. Bugging me like hell. I allways liked the chakram style. It also works with the ""new"" set, the one ppl use multishot with. Granted you got the right quiver, giving you 3-4 hatred per chakram.   Monk was my first char but its changed alot since i played it. I dont like it cause of the lack of spirit, cant get it to regen enough. But the dash set looks nice.   Lots will change with the new patch though. Wizard with Vyr+chantodo is beast. Even Helltooth WD seems useful."
diablo3,3dskop,Sir_Marcellus,2,Sun Jul 19 08:28:36 2015 UTC,"Roll wizard. I can't guarantee you will enjoy everything class has to offer, but you will avoid casting one spell buffed by the others. Tal Rasha forces you to play with 4 elements and you can tailor your own set of skills to go with it, while having to manage 6 piece stacks in a smart way.  Multiple elements also mean you can make unorthodox builds that suit your mood on a particular day, although to lower effect.  While wizard lore make sense and is somewhat cool (mortal tapping into incredibly powerful dormant magic within), his/her personality sucks.   I'd say most variety other than wizard belongs to crusader. Holy shotgun, blessed shield, condemn, shield bash/sweep, ponies and soon hammer+falling sword are all builds you should try once you get that cooldown gear."
diablo3,3dskop,BringBackClassQuests,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:21:24 2015 UTC,"Wizard seems to be the one people are suggesting more to me over the others as the most diverse class.

Thanks!"

diablo3,3dskop,zergosaur,2,Sun Jul 19 16:37:46 2015 UTC,"If you're not worried about cutting edge content, Raekor, Might of the Earth and Immortal King are all incredibly fun barbarian builds that are only going to get stronger in 2.3. Whirlwind is the best build so far, but the other three are reasonably competitive, so you won't feel useless in GR35-45 type content and beyond. I'm personally messing with a 6IK/4MotE build on the PTR that's turning out to be quirky and fun as hell.   Having said that though, all the classes I've played have a variety of builds based on various sets, and there's no reason why you can't play some or all of them."
diablo3,3dskop,situLight,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:24:57 2015 UTC,"I'd probably suggest a Demon Hunter. You have several good end-game builds - Nats, Multishot, Lightening Balls - which can be used in both solo and group play (except for the Lightening Balls, which is really only used for group play + trials).  Once you get to the end game, most classes have one build which is superior to the rest, so if you're planning to push really hard then you're probably going to be stuck playing the same build a lot unfortunately. Things are all going to change in (hopefully) a few weeks, as there's an update pending which will allow a lot more diversity for each class, but even then at the highest levels there likely won't be a huge amount of diversity.  Personally I prefer playing all of the classes each season, but then setting more modest goals for myself - so this seaon I'm trying to clear a gr50 solo with each class. Switching between classes keeps things fresh, and it's fairly easy to gear up new classes once you have one class decently geared.  Anyway, in the current season, I tried most of the popular builds on all classes, and by far my favourite was Nats (I use cold), it took a while to get into the rhythm of the build but once my muscle memory started to kick in I had a blast. ymmv :)"
diablo3,3dskop,Taintia,2,Sun Jul 19 02:36:23 2015 UTC,"I'd take another look at Wizard - I feel he is the most diverse at higher end play. You can do anything from a long ranged class cannon - ie demon hunter - to melee tank.   A lot of the spells are pretty fun and interesting, and many high end builds are not fully figured out / have multiple options."

With the next patch 2.3 and the new set + shenlons change there will be a lot of different builds for endgame content, so there you can keeping changing what build you go with if you get bored.  But as someone else said, the best way is to pick a class that you like and stick with it, and maybe try building some builds yourself, that's what i've been doing with a lot of fun :)"

They make such a big deal about trying to design the game with this flexible and versatile build system that, for the most part, really works, but by the end-game it's pretty much just 'get the set and use the build it is trying to get you to use'. There's still some variation here and there but as soon as Diablo starts feeling 'solved' it stops being as interesting to me. Can't complain too much though, still got tons of enjoyment out of this game and every few months it's still worth checking back in for content updates and whatever."

Honestly kind of bums me out.  Vyr/Tal Rasha/Firebird set bonuses are just too good to pass up with the proper legendaries to pair with them. Really all I've been doing is just farming for said pieces."
diablo3,3dqcl7,amia_calva,0,Sat Jul 18 15:25:25 2015 UTC,"why would having other legendaries be better than set legs? i just dont see why people care. certain items will always be stronger, why does it matter that its set items? either way you have to farm for those specific pieces to be as strong as possible. and if you dont care about that, then just dont use the sets."
diablo3,3dqcl7,Jhazzrun,4,Sat Jul 18 16:29:04 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with sets. It's just that there are only three viable sets and that's all you care in the game, which shallows down the gameplay and purpose of other items. It's like all other things are garbage except the green sets. I salvage almost everything else except the sets. Monsters are better off dropping materials only if it's not set items."
diablo3,3dqcl7,JannaSwag,3,Sat Jul 18 16:48:39 2015 UTC,"Worse then that, each class has a set that is way stronger then the rest. Forn the Wizard its Tals (somtimes Tals mixed with Delsere's).

diablo3,3dqcl7,Zhiyi,2,Sat Jul 18 17:01:31 2015 UTC,You forget set items only drop in t1+ and all the other legendaries are available throughout the entire game even while leveling. You need them in order to progress into T1.
diablo3,3dqcl7,Jerkalerka,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:56:55 2015 UTC,"Thats not really a valid argument. When you make a new char, and get it up to 70, all you need to play on T1 is lv 70 gear. Each class can play well on T1 with a mix of rare-legendary lv 68-70 items. I tried it so i know its true. So the ""getting the legs to play on T1"" you speak of doesnt exist."
diablo3,3dqcl7,SafariDiscoLion,0,Sun Jul 19 08:42:05 2015 UTC,"Of course sets are more powerful than a single random legendaries, it's five or six specific items that have to be worn together. That's the whole point of set items, individually the pieces do very little but have really powerful bonuses when worn together. Legendaries on their own have very small bonuses that typically don't do very much unless you can stack several into a stronger combination."
diablo3,3dqcl7,zenspeed,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:31:26 2015 UTC,"Reasonable argument, but the problem is that for some sets, those bonuses are overwhelmingly powerful.  Sure, you need to wear 5-6 pieces, which completely rules out other legendaries, but if you go over the lists of available legendaries for those slots, you find out that with a few exceptions, legendary items aren't that strong, and certainly not good enough to break the 6pc bonus of a set.  This limits the usefulness of legendary items to a few equipment slots: weapon, off-hand, amulet, belt.  What this does is take a lot of decision-making out of the hands of the player: instead of the goal being to merge together legendary items into a workable whole, the focus becomes to assemble sets then find legendaries that work with it."
diablo3,3dqcl7,NeverQuiteEnough,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:18:33 2015 UTC,"certain items will always be stronger   the degree to which they are stronger is important.  if there were 10 options, and one option can get 1 grift level higher than the other 9, that's pretty good.  those other options can still go really far.  the problem with the sets is that they make one particular playstyle super powerful.  so there is one option way out there by itself, with all the other options lagging way behind."
diablo3,3dqcl7,Jhazzrun,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:16:53 2015 UTC,"doesnt really matter, if you care about reaching high grifts, you will take the set that goes 1 higher, if you dont. then why care what you wear."

diablo3,3dqcl7,Jhazzrun,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:37:28 2015 UTC,"the way i see it, if you want to push. you have to use the better items / sets. and if you dont, then in my mind you dont care about pushing it, and at that point you can just do whatever you want. you're not looking to push records anyway."
diablo3,3dqcl7,NeverQuiteEnough,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:55:10 2015 UTC,"what about when playing with friends, or strangers?  if there are lots of different options of similar strength, close to the top, it is easy to select an appropriate difficulty.  if the sets are much stronger than other gear, then people in a mixed party will face a dilemma.  the people using coherent, synergistic builds, but not making use of the set bonuses won't be able to do content their friends can.  People using those disproportionately powerful set bonuses will find trivial the content that their friends are able to do.  a group could agree to use those sets, or to not use them, and avoid the problem.  But that isn't good form on the part of the developer.  The developer is getting paid, the player is paying, the developer shouldn't be pushing tedious work like that onto us.  much better to just actually balance the game, within a reasonable margin of error."

diablo3,3dsilk,booshjon,4,Sun Jul 19 02:46:35 2015 UTC,"As someone with the exact same situation not three months ago, here are my suggestions:   Do not worry at all about strategies, routes, etc. Pick a character that you like the most (and if at some point it doesn't feel right, start over with another class, etc.) and go with it. In fact, I would suggest you to stay away from forums or places like reddit with discussion about strategies/builds/gear/etc. until one of your characters hit 70. It really won't take long, the terminology would be completely foreign to you anyway, and, the most important thing is: they don't really matter until you hit 70.  Focus on one character to get to level 70 and complete the story line which will open up adventure mode. If you play straight up, you would finish the story around level low 60s or so. You could then start doing bounties and then nephalem rifts to get to 70 (don't worry if you don't understand what these are. you will when you get there). Start with normal difficulty, and increase the difficulty level one by one as you found better gear (blues --> yellows --> orange/green). Stay with the level you are most comfortable with and don't worry about anything else. If you feel you need to step it down one level at bosses, do it without hesitation. There's no need to have a feeling that you need to 'challenge yourself' at this point. It is so insignificant in the grand scheme of things. If you want a challenge, there will be plenty of those later. Do not worry or be frugal with your gold, and do not sell your outdated gear for gold. Always salvage outdated gear for crafting materials, and level up your artisan as soon as you have the money to. Don't worry, you'll get twice as much money in a few minutes of playing some more. Dump all your crafting materials on your stash, as you'll notice that your artisan can grab materials directly from your stash instead of you having to carry them on your bag. Always check after upgrading your artisan if you get a new recipe which will craft you an upgrade to one of your armor/weapon slot, and make it.  Enjoy this journey with your first character, and while you could try to join public games from time to time if you really like to play multiplayer (there won't be many games at the lower level, though, so be aware of that), I suggest you to refrain from doing that and just play solo until you get to 70. There will be plenty of chance later to play with others, including your friends who have been playing this game for a while. When you get one character to 70 and have adventure mode unlocked, in here the best source of info will be the sidebar of each individual sub-reddit for the class (which are linked on the sidebar from here). Read up on the abundant of info that you'll find there. At this point you'll have learned much more about the game and you'll know what specific questions to ask.  This is optional, but after you hit 70, it's a good idea to join a clan and/or some communities that will become a support system for your subsequent adventure. There are communities for basically anything, just search from within the game.   In summary, don't worry about anything at all and just play the game and enjoy (and level up your artisan to the max while you're at it)!   Edit: basically what Crowmolf said above, but with 20,000% more words! :D"
diablo3,3dq9bk,Gigglestomp123,2,Sat Jul 18 11:51:37 2015 UTC,"Depending on your gear you can really run any class in groups but the most popular for 2.3 that I've seen has been lots of Monk / Dh / wiz with Ww Barb still being viable and the WD dart build also working quite well with the passive cube effects and finally crusader   With the recent tweaks to some sets for monk they are in a great place , DH is also in a great place since the addition of the cube ...   I personally play my DH or Wiz if I'm gonna carry the group -  If I don't need to carry the group I'll play WD and have 100% uptime on big bad voodoo for the extra attack speed and damage buff !"

So get your monks set up I guess is all I could say. I am also top 350 on solo WD PTR but I'm pretty well geared."

diablo3,3dpch6,insaneslayer,2,Sun Jul 19 00:03:00 2015 UTC,"I don't see anything wrong with shield mechanics other than block amount not scaling well. You placed the base block chance of shields at 10-18% but you should find ones at 31% if they have the max block chance affix. There are other gear options to raise your block chance as well, including justice lantern and helm of rule. And still, you have punish wich raises your block chance further. You'll be at the block chance cap before you know it. I agree with your Falling sword rant. Half the time the enemies leave the target area before I actually land. The damage output isn't worth it when I'm only hitting 1-2 enemies. As a surprise attack it works well, other than that it's pretty useless. They treat shields as weapons because it's an offhand. Wizard sources, wd fetishes, and dh quivers are the same. It wouldn't be fair for barbs who don't have offhands, they dual wield."
diablo3,3dpch6,Dias_Flac,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:00:35 2015 UTC,"Shield needs to be treated as armor because they are armors: increasing the defence should be its origin purpose. It provides +XXX armor (no +xxxdmg like source) and unlike other offhands, its legendary effects are mostly related to defence. (Sad to see so many good shield effects about block were destroyed by block itself) Now new designs are way out of track (Bond popular BH or Sweep with the shields). but there are still many good shields to improve the surviability. Devs really need to consider the pilosophy behinds that. BTW, using shield(armor) in Kannai's cube won't increase Crusaders dmg significantly. But BH saders can choose blocking shields to help them stand longer in the battles. Block chance and block amount work together and I may exaggerated the point about block chance. But the mechincs of block needs improvement. Block based on X% instead of scale is important."

diablo3,3dnus9,DatFlow,2,Fri Jul 17 20:07:32 2015 UTC,"Greetings, nephalem!  Our first PTR patch is coming up next week. In anticipation of this update, we want to give you a heads up that we will also be wiping progress on the PTR when the patch is issued.   This is because we want to make sure the overall 2.3.0 changes to Adventure Mode are thoroughly tested. However, a bug in the first PTR patch allowed level 70 crafted items to be equipped by low-level characters. This was unintended and skewed progression at the start of PTR Season 4, making a wipe necessary to ensure that it is no longer factoring into the leveling process.  We will be closing and creating a new Focused Feedback thread for Adventure Mode when the patch is deployed to collect feedback untainted by this bug. While we understand that a loss of progression can be frustrating to some, it’s important to remember this is the nature of the PTR. Its intent is to facilitate testing, and we love seeing all your dedicated and thoughtful feedback.   Thank you for all your enthusiastic feedback and testing. We look forward to sharing our upcoming changes with you!   I don't get why this is necessary. Who cares about the progression in freaking PTR? Why wipe all non-seasonal PTR stuff too?

diablo3,3dnus9,AnalTyrant,-6,Fri Jul 17 20:44:00 2015 UTC,"The point is that it hinders testing. Let's say you got 5/6 items for testing purposes already for a set, and now it's reset. You need to get it again. On top of that, you have to redo all the stuff for Kanai's cube (getting it, getting enough bounties done, etc). It now takes time to do that all again.

diablo3,3dm7ps,Jeggerz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:51:11 2015 UTC,"It's okay.  Essentially the seasonal play has made it so old characters are pretty much useless once a season ends a new season begins.  So yes, your gear is pretty much obsolete.  Especially as seasons have released new gear.  Essentially Diablo 3 is a repeat hack and slash grind every season to see how high of a Greater Rift level you can get.  Once the season ends, your character and all of his gear/gold/materials are transferred to softcore non-seasonal and then a new season begins so you start over.  It's fun for a while and I got really into at at season 2, but then realized its a monotony of grinding for legendary gear just to try to get lucky on random number generator (RNG) pylons in Greater Rifts for a conduit near a boss to get a better Greater Rift time score.   It becomes lifeless, but can be fun with a guild who runs together.  I just prefer to spend my personal time in other ways/other games with more of a reward to show for it.  It can likely be even better if you have a lot of friends challenging eachother to be the highest Greater Rift level.  Creates a sense of accomplishment that way. Otherwise, soloplay.. meh.  P.S. Also a great game to pick up and drop for 15-30 minutes at a time while listening to music waiting to do something/go somewhere."

You will be at a bigger difference in gear quality (well, more specific gear itself) when the new patch and season hit on live servers, but only due to the fact that now there will be more gear that's better than what came before that, which is better than what came before that and so on.   And that there will be higher torment difficulties which means you will get higher leg. drop chance from 7-10, so farming on those torments is definitely going to be better for efficiency and clearing them will take more than what your gear was, but it shouldn't be much of an issue to find games and farm out some good gear between now and then."

diablo3,3doe0d,salty_john,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:41:49 2015 UTC,I sent you a request hoss
diablo3,3dodlj,igorny_the_panda,5,Fri Jul 17 22:37:07 2015 UTC,"I don't feel like it would make sense to update the older versions of the game... That's just how consoles work. You don't buy the new consoles, you just don't get the newest and best content. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this isn't just a Blizzard /Diablo3 thing."
diablo3,3dodlj,Kevinw778,-4,Fri Jul 17 23:17:19 2015 UTC,"I disagree. You cannot just release a brand new expansion for an actual game globally (platforms speaking) and then forsake 2 of them because ""they are too old"".  Those people spend their money on the games too. They deserve the same conditions."
diablo3,3dodlj,hi2323,5,Fri Jul 17 23:59:56 2015 UTC,"no, they're not entitled to anything. if you're still using a last-gen system, you should expect service to end for it eventually.  everything is eventually obsolete. if anything you're lucky that they made PS3/x360 versions at all."
diablo3,3dodlj,Kevinw778,2,Sat Jul 18 00:49:53 2015 UTC,"Resources can't really be wasted on old versions of games. I think those that own D3 for the old gen systems should get hefty discounts for the new gen system versions, though. I'm not against you on this one. I'm against wasting resources."
diablo3,3dodlj,SafariDiscoLion,-3,Sat Jul 18 00:20:35 2015 UTC,Why is it a waste? The console is perfectly able to run the game. It's only a bit extra of content. And it works as it should. Why is it a waste? Is not like they are upgrading it graphically all the time like they do with WoW....is just about tweaks on classes and a type of map and some items....not like the ps3 system would burn because of that extra of content....
diablo3,3dodlj,michUP33,4,Sat Jul 18 00:47:01 2015 UTC,"They'd have to put resources and work-hours into porting content to the consoles, PSN/XBL fees (which cost upwards of $15,000 each along with months of waiting for approval from Sony/Microsoft), and troubleshooting, just for a version of the game that sells barely a fraction of what it does on PC. They'd be throwing away heaps of money to please an incredibly small part of the player base, just for a few extra features from newer patches."
diablo3,3dodlj,not_light_speed,-4,Sat Jul 18 00:50:53 2015 UTC,"They decided that a week after releasing it....so they waited for the naïve ones to buy it and then they just forsaw that they wouldn't sell much more? Just BECAUSE? With no real reason? With proper support it could have sold more...I dont care about the ""console master race"" wannabes...there is still a lot of people who doesnt own ps4 or xbox 1...Small part of the player base? Yeah certainly the big revenues come from pc...but that doesnt mean others are lesser...  Why would anyone buy an uncomplete product?"
diablo3,3dodlj,Kevinw778,2,Sat Jul 18 02:36:00 2015 UTC,Umm. People have been buying alpha games.
diablo3,3dodlj,axios666,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:15:18 2015 UTC,"BUT those games are in developement...HAVEN'T BEEN FORSAKEN, like this. It is not the same.  PS: I LOVE how blizzie fanboys are downvoting anything i say against their loves..."
diablo3,3dodlj,JannaSwag,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:06:26 2015 UTC,They also announced plenty of times PRIOR to release that the PS3 and XBOX 360 editions would receive one post-release patch and then would no longer be supported.
diablo3,3dodlj,jetah,2,Sat Jul 18 03:27:15 2015 UTC,It's not about system capabilities. It's about having to maintain extra versions of the product.
diablo3,3dodlj,Topiaz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:11:08 2015 UTC,Agree...but still..blizzard is blizzard and they do what they wanna do :(
diablo3,3dodlj,jetah,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:15:10 2015 UTC,"The game... well its simply best on the PC. The console version is fun but there are a lot of crazy modded items floating around that can ruin your experience. For instance I saw a thread about a week ago where someone picked up an item in a public game and instantly gained like 2000 paragon levels. He was upset because he lost that feeling of progression he would have got from earning them himself. 2000 is a ton by the way, the top players are just hitting like 900 or so and that is from playing since RoS came out.  You are correct in that there are no updates to the ps3 or the xbox360 and with all the great work the devs have been doing recently I wouldn't buy the game if I was locked out of updates."
diablo3,3dodlj,Gunnar_Peterson,-13,Fri Jul 17 22:46:10 2015 UTC,I feel sad..disappointed with blizzard..But you just got the last chances of this game...You are forced to buy a new gen console or a pc just because they are too lazy to update ps3? Why did they release it on the first moment? Those money-digging whores...  Definitely i won't buy this...if the version itself is even broken...
diablo3,3dodlj,MSchulte,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:54:37 2015 UTC,"It isnt about being lazy.  there's a post about how the old systems are coded (think that was the word assumed) differently and blizzard would have to keep multiple code versions around to update all platforms.  I heard, take it as you wish, it cost 50k to patch XB360 games now."
diablo3,3do4kx,kradler90,3,Fri Jul 17 21:24:00 2015 UTC,"Yes for GR, since it's multiplicative, no for T6,since it's additive."
diablo3,3do4kx,MethodiK,2,Fri Jul 17 23:52:11 2015 UTC,All the zdps classes have rubies  (or sometimes amethysts ) in their helmet.  Heck..paragon 630 and still wearing me accursed visage with ruby!
diablo3,3do4kx,axios666,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:17:04 2015 UTC,"Of course it's gonna help. Although if you're looking at your own gain its %\n where n is the number of people in your party, making it really good for lvling friends and whatnot and great for individual play(solo).  Problem before was that supports would go heavy + exp, so by the time the dmg dealer hits 200 paragon, the support would be at like 300+."
diablo3,3do4kx,yoman632,2,Fri Jul 17 21:28:59 2015 UTC,Alright that cleared it up for me! Thank you
diablo3,3do4kx,Zacherytodd,0,Fri Jul 17 21:30:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly.. i dont think so. Id rather keep my set bonus and do more damage. If youre on t6, getting 1600%.. whats another 30%? nothing in my opinion, id rather just keep on spinnin :P"
diablo3,3do4kx,Ndog921,3,Fri Jul 17 21:30:27 2015 UTC,how does putting a ruby in your helm break a set bonus...?
diablo3,3do4kx,Zacherytodd,2,Fri Jul 17 21:47:52 2015 UTC,"Sorry man, I was just assuming he meant using a crown."
diablo3,3do4kx,RhaegarDragon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:08:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think it works that way....i doubt it's just 1600+30, there should be some multiplication in there somewhere. I'm not sure what the exact calculation is can someone who knows for sure respond with how this works? also if someone is clear on how an xp pool factors in here too that would be stellar"
diablo3,3do4kx,btothefifth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:15:38 2015 UTC,"XP bonus % is additive in everything but GR. In GR, XP bonus % is multiplicative with GR difficulty XP bonuses."
diablo3,3do4kx,chowbogan,0,Sat Jul 18 12:30:47 2015 UTC,I think the calculation would work like this:  baseExp * 16 * 1.3 = 20.8 times base exp instead of 16.   That would make the most sense to me if it is multiplicative which I'm assuming it is.
diablo3,3dp53n,-SpaceGh0st-,2,Sat Jul 18 02:45:50 2015 UTC,NA or EU? Seasonal or non?
