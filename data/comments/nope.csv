Endemic to North America, they can be found from the Subarctic plains of Canada to Central America. The garter snake is the state reptile of Massachusetts.   With no real consensus on the classification of species of Thamnophis, disagreement among taxonomists and sources, such as field guides, over whether two types of snakes are separate species or subspecies of the same species is common. [citation needed]  Garter snakes are closely related to the genus Nerodia (water snakes), with some species having been moved back and forth between genera.

Nor is it a wolf spider. Honestly I think it might just be a cellar spider, which are harmless.   Edit: it's a male running crab spider: Philodromus rufus.

nope,39fub3,Billabong654,2,Fri Jun 12 07:20:15 2015 UTC,"Apparently my response didn't post. I couldn't find any information about when brown recluse may have been introduced to the region, but they are pretty widespread. And since they are common among human spaces, and especially in containers, it would be easy for them to spread across the globe. I have seen some UK dangerous spiders lists that don't list them, and some that do. But I have seen valid news articles confirming their presence. It is important to know, though, that they aren't a particularly aggressive spider, and the percentage of bites that necrotize, or cause any side effects at all, are pretty low. They don't have a good statistic for it, because many brown recluse bites are just like any other spider or bug bite, so it's hard to tell how many actually are brown recluse bites."
nope,39fub3,Blametruth31,2,Mon Jun 15 04:41:43 2015 UTC,"My guess is either some huntsman type, or a crab type. Definitely not a brown recluse, it's missing the distinct marking. Like black widows have a red hourglass, recluses have a dark fiddle."

nope,38nx7a,AchinBacon,3,Fri Jun 5 13:03:32 2015 UTC,"I have PTSD from these little fuckers. I shit you not.  I used to live in this apartment complex across the street from the community college I attended while getting my Associates degree. Living there was decent, but we were suddenly and unexpectedly hit with a wave of bed bugs.  I reported it to the management about a week after the bites started. I thought it was just mosquitoes, but a friend of mine noticed that all the bites were in lines and said that it was probably bed bugs instead. That evening, I went home, did a bit of research, learned the signs of bed bugs, and checked everything I could. Eventually, we found that there were indeed bed bugs in our master bedroom when I found a few crawling in our curtains.   I managed to tape one down to an index card and went straight to the apartment complex's main office with it and told them we had an infestation that sprang up out of nowhere. (We had been living in the apartment for close to two years at this point. We had suspicions that our neighbors, who weren't exactly the cleanest people we've ever met, may have brought the bugs in, but we didn't say anything about it.)   The landlord was informed and brought in a specialist who came in and did a thorough investigation to find the source. He found a very small nest and eradicated it, and told us we were VERY lucky to have found it this early, because it was early enough to not cost an arm and a leg. But he did recommend that we run all of our clothes through a high heat dryer, seal our mattress after spraying it down with pesticides, and thoroughly clean the inside of the apartment. Luckily for us, a house in our town opened up for rent and we were able to move quickly afterwards.  But the headaches didn't even start yet. My landlord tried to blame the infestation on us and tried to make us front the $1,500 bill for the fumigator, but after just a bit of research and threatening to lawyer up, he backed down when I told him that it was against state law for him to try and press that on a tenant. However, he conveniently found a way to keep all of my $500 deposit for the smallest things. Whatever. Fuck that guy.   tl:dr Be SUPER careful about bed bugs. Learn the signs of an infestation. It can be disastrous if you get one and don't catch it early."

nope,381nlb,twitchedawake,2,Mon Jun 1 06:06:38 2015 UTC,You can't. A pupil is just a hole through which light goes through. I recon they are scraping the retina in the back of the eye for some reason (however don't quote me on that).

nope,381nlb,twitchedawake,2,Mon Jun 1 10:32:57 2015 UTC,Retina is just a very thin (one cell thin?) layer of cells that receives light and allows you to 'see'
nope,381nlb,Yoghurt_,3,Mon Jun 1 10:40:01 2015 UTC,"This is definitely not the retina, which covers the posterior wall of the inside of the eye. You are correct that you can't remove the pupil though, as the it's more a hole than an actual physical part. It's not just empty space though, sitting within the pupil is the lens. This refracts and focuses images onto the retina inside, the same way that artificial lenses (like glasses) work. In fact glasses actually work by either enhancing or counter-acting the refraction of the natural lens through an additional concave/convex lens!  What the surgeons are removing here is the anterior capsule of the lens, part of a structure that is intended the lens under tension to allow it to keep it's shape and be adjusted when we focus on different things. This is being done to remove a cataract I believe, although I'm not an Opthalmologist so may be wrong on that part.  Source: Doctor"

nope,381nlb,I_love_propofol,2,Mon Jun 1 19:35:15 2015 UTC,"Cataract:       A cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye leading to a decrease in vision. They may affect one or both eyes. Often they develop slowly. Symptoms may include faded colors, blurry vision, halos around light, trouble with bright lights, and trouble seeing at night.  This may result in trouble driving, reading, or recognizing faces.  Poor vision may also result in an increased risk of falling and depression.  Cataracts are the cause of half of blindness and 33% of visual impairment worldwide.

They are the largest insects in the order Hemiptera, and occur worldwide, with most of the species in North America, South America, Northern Australia and East Asia. They are typically encountered in freshwater streams and ponds. Most species are relatively large, typically at least 0.75 in (2 cm) long, although smaller species also exist. The largest are members of the genus Lethocerus, which can exceed 4.75 in (12 cm) and nearly reach the length of some of the larger beetles in the world. Giant water bugs are a popular food in southeast Asia.    Image i     Interesting: Belostoma | Appasus | Abedus | Horvathinia   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

The systematics of this genus is very complicated with many controversial points of view about the unclear phylogeny of this group. All representatives of this genus have adopted the so-called ""sit and wait"" hunting strategy and they actively use visual orientation when watching for food. In general, the ecological niche and role of Phrynocephalus species in lizard communities of arid environments of Asia are poorly studied, but seem to be similar to that of Phrynosoma, Cophosaurus, Holbrookia, Uta, and Sceloporus in the New World, as well as Moloch in Australia.

It's called exfoliation weathering, where rock will break off in sheets. It is believed to be caused by the reduction of pressure as a rock moves to the surface.   This is part of the Twain Harte rock, a large granite that is part of the Sierra Nevada range. Granite forms at really high pressures deep underground, so as the overlying rock erodes away and the granite becomes exposed, the pressure of the overlying rock becomes less and less. As the pressure drops, the granite begins to expand, and the expanding top layers of granite can weather off in sheets, like seen in this gif!"

nope,354pzk,OnurbTheNice,0,Thu May 7 10:10:06 2015 UTC,"Wolf spider:       Wolf spiders are members of the family Lycosidae, from the Ancient Greek word ""λύκος"" meaning ""wolf"". They are robust and agile hunters with excellent eyesight. They live mostly solitary and hunt alone. Some are opportunistic hunters pouncing upon prey as they find it or even chasing it over short distances. Some will wait for passing prey in or near the mouth of a burrow.  Wolf spiders resemble Nursery web spiders (family Pisauridae), but wolf spiders carry their egg sacs by attaching them to their spinnerets (Pisauridae carry their egg sacs with their chelicerae and pedipalps). Two of the Wolf spider's eight eyes are large and prominent, which distinguishes them from the Nursery web spiders whose eyes are all of approximately equal size. This can also help distinguish them from grass spiders.

We got a 24 hour notice to put every single thing we owned into garbage bags and move it all 18 inches away from the walls. Then they came in and sprayed the baseboards. We could technically go back in after 4 hours, but since we had pets we had to be out 24 hours.  The first spray they let us stay in a vacant apartment. It hadn't been cleaned. We got fleas. Fucking fleas. Most of them seemed to end up in my wife's car, probably because we used it to move our suitcase at one point. I ended up bombing the interior of the car with spray, that seems to have solved it, no bites for a few weeks, but whenever we drove the car anywhere we'd be bit up to our knees. The car still stinks of spray. Doesn't matter how much we drive with the windows down.The only thing we can do is spray something stronger to mask it.  So we go back up to our place, put our bed back down on the floor (but away from the wall) and try to live for the next 2 weeks while we wait for the second spray. We couldn't unpack anything. If we did have bed bugs (we only found two) we'd spread them around by unpacking.   2 weeks later they spray again. This time the agency has no vacant units. We're on our own. We had to pay for a hotel room out of pocket for a night. One that took pets. We were convinced we'd get fleas again but thankfully we didn't. 24 hours later we go back up. We've been slowly unpacking since.  We also had to wash and dry everything we owned with hot water and high heat for at least 60 minutes. I had actually just finished washing everything we owned like a week before this bullshit. Our power bill is through the roof. So many garbage bags wasted. So much laundry soap. We ate out so much for about 3 weeks because our kitchen was full of garbage bags and unusable. We both feel like shit from it. All together it cost us about $1300 for all the sprays, bags, soap, power, hotels, food, bedbug proof matress protector, etc.  If this is your own home you're so fucked. We didn't have to pay for the actual cost of spraying. I'm sure that's probably another 1-2k or something."

About 12x8, insulated, no plumbing or anything. I'm going to look into setting that up as a heat room. Every single thing we own will go through that if I can.

nope,32ort3,metalslug53,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:54:16 2015 UTC,"Oh God, these little fucking demons.   Here's a horror story for you. Before moving into our current home, my wife, my 1 year old daughter, and myself lived in a 2 bedroom apartment that came down with a bad bed bug infestation. I'm not sure where exactly the bugs came from, but I managed to catch one a few nights after the bites began to show up and took it to the office manager. She told me she would have a specialist come and assess the situation.   The bug guy showed up the next morning and did a thorough look-through and found a serious nest near where our apartment was located. I was told that there were no other outbreaks in any of the other apartments, but I know that's absolute horseshit as my neighbors had similar bites. I'm fairly certain the apartment complex owner just didn't want word of an infestation getting out.   Well, we had to go through a living hell dealing with these beasts. All of our belongings had to be bagged, all of our clothes washed, an we had to invest in a very pricy mattress seal to keep any of the bugs inside the mattress. The bug guy did a fumigation process that was tailored to specifically kill the bed bugs. After a few weeks of no bites, they came back. But luckily for me and my family, we moved into a new place shortly afterwards and most of our belongings had long since been removed from that apartment.   The nightmare TRULY began after we left. First, our deposit wasn't returned to us. Then, we received a bill to cover the tab that the fumigator mailed to the apartment complex manager. The deposit was withheld for mostly bullshit reasons, such as a door handle being ""broken"", a claim that the smoke detector no longer worked, an asinine cleaning and maintenance bill, and then a good $500 withheld with the reason ""Other: Bed bug treatment.""   I was livid. I didn't bring these goddamned things into my home and I sure as hell wasn't going to pay for it. So I began to do some research and I contacted a lawyer. In my state it is VERY much illegal to make a tenant front the bill for something like this, so our lawyer wrote up a letter threatening a small claims lawsuit. Shortly afterwards, the fumigator contacted up and told us we didn't have to worry about the bill, then a check for the $500 arrived in the mail from my ex-landlord.   The bugs were bad, but the headache of dealing with that douchebag afterwards was worse. I hope your problem isn't as bad as mine was. As someone who has been there, you have my condolences."
nope,32ort3,gilbertsmith,2,Thu Apr 16 02:14:59 2015 UTC,"I feel your rage. I pay 15 grand a year for this fucking apartment. I didn't bring these things in here.  They all but told me they came from 306. We're in 406. We've been complaining about 306 for months. They were storing garbage in their laundry room we figure, because the vent comes up to our laundry room and our clothes stunk like garbage after being dried. They refused to do anything about these filthy fuckers because they're apparently Indian or something and it's a ""racial issue"". I've never met them or even seen them. I don't know what fucking color they are and I don't care. They're stinking up my apartment.  So they did nothing and kept doing nothing until finally these pieces of shit skipped rent and left a bedbug infestation. Bet they wish they'd given a notice of entry to investigate the smell of garbage now. Maybe they'd have caught it before they had to spray a dozen units for bedbugs.  Meanwhile they'll never fucking reimburse me for the $1300+ I had to lay out for hotel rooms, eating out, garbage bags, etc.  We're hoping to be in a house soon. We were looking before this but now we're more determined than ever.  Oh, and as an added bonus, the VERY NEXT DAY after they told us our place was clean and we could unpack our shit, I came home to a notice of rent increase taped to the door. They're upping it by the full legally allowed amount. What a bunch of fuckers."

nope,2z74de,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:02:31 2015 UTC,"Opiliones:       Opiliones /ˈoʊpɪliːˈoʊniːs/ (Latin opilio, ""shepherd""; formerly Phalangida) is an order of arachnids commonly known as harvestmen. As of December 2011 [update], over 6,500 species of harvestmen have been discovered worldwide,  although the total number of extant species may exceed 10,000.  The order Opiliones includes four suborders: Cyphophthalmi, Eupnoi, Dyspnoi, and Laniatores, and representatives of each can be found on every continent except Antarctica (with the exception of Dyspnoi, which is restricted to North America and Eurasia). Well-preserved fossils have been found in the 400-million-year-old Rhynie cherts of Scotland, which look surprisingly modern, indicating that their basic body plan appeared very early on, and, at least in some taxa, has changed little since that time. Their phylogenetic position within Arachnida is disputed: their closest relatives may be the mites (Acari) or the Novogenuata (the Scorpiones, Pseudoscorpiones and Solifugae).  Although superficially similar to and often confused with spiders (order Araneae), Opiliones is a distinct order that is not closely related to spiders within Arachnida. They can be easily distinguished from even long-legged spiders by their fused body regions and single pair of eyes in the middle of their cephalothorax (spiders have an 'abdomen' that is separated from the cephalothorax by a constriction, as well as three to four pairs of eyes, usually around the margins of their cephalothorax).

There, they wait in ambush for large insects to come within striking distance. They do not spin webs to catch prey, but simply overpower their victims.  oh and then there's this   investigating male monogamy in spiders revealed that, for this species, mating always results in the death of the male!

The Goa'uld are parasites from the planet P3X-888, integrated within a host, most of the time a human. The resulting creatures are a powerful race bent on galactic conquest and domination, largely without pity, compassion or remorse. In the first eight seasons of Stargate SG-1, they are the greatest extraterrestrial threat to Earth known to the Stargate Command (SGC). The Goa'uld are the main enemies of SG-1 for most of the show, until they are replaced in this capacity by the Ori in seasons 9 and 10. They also appear in the Stargate Atlantis episode ""Critical Mass"", and in the DVD movie Stargate: Continuum. They are pejoratively called ""snakes"" or ""snakeheads"" by Jack O'Neill.

It was originally native to the warm-temperate western USA (California, Oregon and Nevada) but has in recent times expanded its range and become an invasive species in parts of Europe.  This species is sometimes colloquially called ""the leaf-footed bug"", but actual leaf-footed bugs are an entire group of species in Leptoglossus and related genera of the Coreidae; see for example the Florida leaf-footed bug, L. phyllopus.  Western conifer seed bugs are sometimes mistakenly identified as stink bugs because of the unpleasant aroma they emit when disturbed.

nope,2ksbs2,Stealsfromhobos,2,Thu Oct 30 16:15:38 2014 UTC,"Tarantula hawk:       A tarantula hawk is a spider wasp which hunts tarantulas as food for its larvae. Tarantula hawks belong to any of the many species in the genera Pepsis and Hemipepsis in the family Pompilidae (spider wasps).  The more familiar species are up to 5 cm (2 in) long, with blue-black bodies and bright, rust-colored wings (other species have black wings with blue highlights), making them among the largest of wasps. The vivid coloration found on the bodies, and especially wings, of these wasps is an aposematism, advertising to potential predators the wasps' ability to deliver a powerful sting. Their long legs have hooked claws for grappling with their victims. The stinger of a female Pepsis grossa can be up to 7 mm (1/3 in) long, and the sting is considered the second most painful insect sting in the world.

Technically it's an Argiope aurantia, commonly known as the yellow garden spider, black & yellow garden spider, golden garden spider, writing spider, or corn spider. It is common to the contiguous United States, Hawaii, southern Canada, Mexico, and Central America. They have distinctive yellow and black markings on their abdomens and a mostly white cephalothorax. The etymology of its name means ""gilded silver-face"". Males range from 5–9 mm (0.20–0.35 in) females from 19–28 mm (0.75–1.10 in). These spiders may bite if disturbed or harassed, but the venom is seemingly harmless to humans.  Additionally they are incredibly beautiful spiders (according to us spider lovers anyway) and excellent bug-trappers. Although this one, posted recently by another redditor, thinks she's a Goliath Bird-Eating tarantula. Yes, that's a hummingbird, caught in the Argiope's magnificent web."

nope,2idm68,gsx115,1 point,Mon Oct 6 00:31:55 2014 UTC,"Amblypygi:       Amblypygi is an order of invertebrate animals belonging to the class Arachnida, in the subphylum Chelicerata of the phylum Arthropoda. They form a separate order of arachnids alongside the spiders, scorpions and others.  Amblypygids are also known as whip spiders and tailless whip scorpions (not to be confused with whip scorpions that belong to the Arachnid order Thelyphonida). The name ""amblypygid"" means ""blunt rump"", a reference to a lack of the flagellum (""tail""). They are harmless to humans.   Amblypygids possess no silk glands or venomous fangs. They rarely bite if threatened, but can grab fingers with pedipalps, resulting in thorn-like puncture injury.  By 2003, 5 families, 17 genera and around 155 species had been discovered.  They are found in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Some species are subterranean; all are nocturnal. Fossilized amblypygids have been found dating back to the Carboniferous period, for example Graeophonus.

Additionally, the skin on your fingers is relatively thick and the fangs of these spiders relatively short, so they would have trouble doing any damage even if they opted to bite. And the water would give the spiders something to think about if they were to get frisky and the hand sank. All in all, a fairly safe method of filming these spiders crawling on your fingers.

nope,2glh8g,autowikibot,2,Wed Sep 17 23:07:32 2014 UTC,"Pyrosome:       Pyrosomes, genus Pyrosoma, are free-floating colonial tunicates that live usually in the upper layers of the open ocean in warm seas, although some may be found at greater depths. Pyrosomes are cylindrical- or conical-shaped colonies made up of hundreds to thousands of individuals, known as zooids. Colonies range in size from less than one centimeter to several metres in length.  Each zooid is only a few millimetres in size, but is embedded in a common gelatinous tunic that joins all of the individuals. Each zooid opens both to the inside and outside of the ""tube"", drawing in ocean water from the outside to its internal filtering mesh called the branchial basket, extracting the microscopic plant cells on which it feeds, and then expelling the filtered water to the inside of the cylinder of the colony. The colony is bumpy on the outside, each bump representing a single zooid, but nearly smooth, though perforated with holes for each zooid, on the inside.  Pyrosomes are planktonic, which means their movements are largely controlled by currents, tides, and waves in the oceans. On a smaller scale, however, each colony can move itself slowly by the process of jet propulsion, created by the coordinated beating of cilia in the branchial baskets of all the zooids, which also create feeding currents.

nope,2do6bg,TomDaGlom,2,Sat Aug 16 14:45:39 2014 UTC,"Long-legged sac spider:       The long-legged sac spiders (family Miturgidae) include nearly 400 species in about 30 genera worldwide.  The largest genus currently recognized as belonging to this family is Cheiracanthium, which used to be placed in the family of ""true"" sac spider, Clubionidae. The placement of the primarily Old World genus Cheiracanthium in the Miturgidae family is still being debated and may change. Only two species are known from the United States, one of which is obviously introduced. The genus is quite diverse in Africa and at least three or four species are known to occur in Egyptian cotton fields alone. The family would be totally obscure if it were not for the fact that members of Cheiracanthium are documented beneficial predators in agricultural fields and are also known to be mildly venomous to humans. The yellow sac spider, Cheiracanthium inclusum, has been studied more than the other species in regard to its role in controlling pest insects in the southeastern United States. Other genera include the more obscure southwestern US and Mexican Syspira, which superficially resembles a wolf spider (Family Lycosidae). The mostly tropical New World genus Teminius is noted for the thick velcro-like scopula on the undersides of the tarsi.

I looked in and found myself face-to-face with a wasp nest, the 6-or-so wasps doing that warning thing where they start to flap their wings and raise their asses preparing to fly. I immediately threw it as far as I could into the tall grass that dad would mow with the tractor when he got home and ran as fast as I could inside. I let the mower run out of gas and didn't finish the yard until the next day.   Dad was mad when there were small bits of styrofoam in one of the sections he got with the bush hog.

This is a Chilean Rosehair, which is basically a ""beginner's"" tarantula. You can take them out and hold them, let them walk around your hand and arm, etc. I don't really know about petting, since I think the ""hairs"" are actually defense mechanisms. In the wild, when they feel threatened, they flick these hairs off their bodies with the hopes of getting some into the eyes of whatever is attacking them. But the Rosehair is really docile, can't see very well, and doesn't move very fast. Typically I leave her be. I might hold her once a month when I change out the wood chips in her tank. The most exciting times for me are when I feed her. It's really cool to see her go through the process. First she typically holds the roach down just to make sure she has a handle on it, then attempts to flip it over, then stabs with her fangs and holds still for a few minutes while the vemon takes effect. Then she starts laying down this thin mat of silk that she'll eat over. Then she discards this gross pile of... bug remains? in the corner of the tank. I might not be a part of the spider-owner community, but I do love bugs, so basically owning her is like a free nature documentary once a week."

They are considered harmless and have low-toxicity venom.  A. gemmoides are useful natural predators for insects.     A. gemmoides make their webs near lights, closed spaces, and on the sides of buildings. They can also be found under wood, overhangs, or guarded places such as animal burrows.  They come in varying colors but are easily identified by the two horn shaped growths on their relatively large abdomen. Their color changes from summer to winter.   The female will die within days of laying a single egg sac with hundreds of eggs. Egg sacs can overwinter, and the emerging spiderlings will eat their brothers and sisters. The babies ride strands of silk in warm air currents, able to transport them to locations miles away.

nope,2akj6z,thektulu7,1 point,Fri Jul 18 06:06:52 2014 UTC,"Diving bell spider:       The diving bell spider or water spider, Argyroneta aquatica, is the only species of spider known to live entirely under water.  Argyroneta aquatica is found in northern and central Europe and northern Asia up to latitude 62°N. It is the only spider known to spend its whole life under water. As with other spiders, it breathes air, which it traps in a bubble held by hairs on its abdomen and legs.  This gives it a silvery appearance, despite it being velvet-grey. [citation needed] The spider inhabits ponds in Europe and northern Asia, and lives for approximately two years. [citation needed] The appearance of the diving bell gave rise to the genus name Argyroneta, from the Greek ""argyros"" (ἄργυρος), meaning ""silver"", and ""neta"", a neologism (perhaps for *νητής) derived from the verb ""neo"" (νέω) ""spin"", intended to mean ""spinner of silver"".   Females build underwater ""diving bell"" webs which they fill with air and use for digesting prey, molting, mating and raising offspring. They live almost entirely within the bells, darting out to catch prey animals that touch the bell or the silk threads that anchor it. However, they have to surface occasionally to renew their personal air supplies and those of their webs. Males also build bells, but these are smaller and the males replenish their bells' oxygen supply less often. The males also have a more active hunting style. Prior to mating, the male constructs a diving bell adjacent to the female's, then spins a tunnel from his bell, breaking into hers to gain entrance.  Mating then takes place in the female's bell. The female spider lays between 30 and 70 eggs in her bell.

nope,29mdaj,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Jul 4 19:27:29 2014 UTC,"Cotinis nitida:       Cotinis nitida, commonly known as the green June beetle, June bug or June beetle,  is a beetle of the family Scarabaeidae. It occurs in the eastern United States, where it is most abundant in the south. It is not easily distinguished from the related southwestern species, Cotinis mutabilis.  The green June beetle is active during daylight hours. The adult is usually 15–22 mm (0.59–0.87 in) long with dull, metallic green wings; its sides are gold and the head, legs and underside are very bright shiny green. Their habitat extends from Maine to Georgia, and as far west as Kansas, with possible population crossover in Texas with their western cousin, the figeater beetle.

Most common household spiders aren't a hazard; it's only the hobo, wolf, recluse and widow (among with some others) that you should be aware of.  Giant home spiders, jumping spiders, orb-weavers don't cause any harm on bites, but keep your house clean from other pests.  Centipedes, on the other hand, are all in general venomous and the bites of even the smaller ones hurt a lot. Can also cause allergies if one's allergic to bees, as some components in the venom have similar effects.  I'd say kill the centipede and keep the spiders alive, unless they're clearly a venomous spider."

Nephila consists of numerous individual species found around the world. They are also commonly called golden orb-weavers, giant wood spiders, or banana spiders. In North America, the golden silk orb-weavers (see also Nephila clavipes) are sometimes referred to as writing spiders due to occasional zigzag patterns (stabilimenta) built into their webs, though these occur much more frequently in the webs of Argiope, such as the St Andrew's Cross spider.
