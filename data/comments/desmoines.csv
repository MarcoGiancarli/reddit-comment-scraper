The approximately 100 yard long camel and zebra races are interspersed throughout the afternoon with horse racing, presumably to hold people there and make bank on refreshment sales.  You will wait for several hours, possibly (probably?) in the blistering sun, to see approximately 1 minute of racing in total.    I would suggest sitting this one out.

desmoines,3d918v,MyAccountForReddit,5,Tue Jul 14 13:18:33 2015 UTC,"Are you looking for a general practitioner? Or a clinic for OB/GYN related things?   For the first I would recommend Steinmann Family Health. They're probably going to be one of the best practices in the area for a more holistic approach. And they're not owned or affiliated with Unity Point, which is rare around here.  Plus they're located downtown right by Wells Fargo Arena so the location is what you're looking for.  For well woman care I would highly recommend Willowsong Midwifery in Sherman Hill. It's probably a little bit too ""crunchy"" for a a lot of people but I have been seeing them for almost 4 years, delivered two babies with and gotten all my well woman care through them. Insurance covers their GYN services.  I honestly have never experienced more caring, dedicated health care providers. If they had a family practice I would never go anywhere else."

desmoines,3cyjs9,dsmhawk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:08:38 2015 UTC,"To state the obvious, if anyone was an ideal date, they probably don't need to be on a dating site."
desmoines,3cyjs9,ranhalt,3,Sun Jul 12 05:36:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's really true. I don't get to meet a lot of new people due to my busy daily schedule with work and family, most my friends are already married and not into going out and doing things so it's actually probably the best option for casually meeting people for me."
desmoines,3cyjs9,Jadaki,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:24:10 2015 UTC,"I've been struggling with this recently, too. Do you think that's true? It's hard to make it so black/white, but I'm inclined to agree with you to an extent."
desmoines,3cyjs9,labeledcassettetapes,3,Sun Jul 12 15:38:16 2015 UTC,I don't think it's that clear cut. You can be a desirable date but that doesn't mean people are going to be throwing themselves at you. If you don't have a lot of opportunities to meet new people IRL then online dating is really convenient. You'll definitely find tons of desperate people on places like okc and tinder though.
desmoines,3cyjs9,maelspln,2,Sun Jul 12 23:37:59 2015 UTC,"No.  I don't think that online is the last place to go. I used it because I don't have the ability to use the ""traditional"" channels to date.   I'm a divorced mom... Online made it a tad easier to meet people."

desmoines,3cyjs9,maelspln,3,Sun Jul 12 15:36:50 2015 UTC,"It's the same on the other side of the coin. There are a lot of women with issues or kids which I don't care for. It's near impossible to get through to an attractive woman since they wade through so many shitty messages. It's worked a few times, but it's very rare."

desmoines,3cyjs9,Teknoraver64,2,Sat Jul 11 23:34:38 2015 UTC,"Match was a joke, if that was something you were considering. I never bothered with OKC. I'm also in the 24-29 age bracket, and I haven't gotten up the gumption to try another dating site again. At this point, I don't think I will."
desmoines,3cyjs9,lightning_crashes,2,Sun Jul 12 08:31:31 2015 UTC,I didn't have any luck on match either.

desmoines,3cyjs9,bananandrea,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:38:34 2015 UTC,Why was Match bad? That's the one I was considering but was worrying that a lot of people have dead accounts so it would waste my money.
desmoines,3cyjs9,Teknoraver64,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:38:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's actually part of why I left. The responses from married men and possibly-scammers were another reason. Some of the responses I got were from guys who had kids, and I'm not interested in that. I wanna start a family, not join one. The straw that broke the camel's back is a long story. Anyways, Match isn't worth it, and besides, Match isn't the be-all, end-all."

Maybe on east side night if you want some entertainment- the iowa craft beer tent is my favorite thing there. Adventureland water park is a good time.  World food prize is coming up which is fantastic! Four seasons festival is currently underway in Polk city(bring things for walking/biking trails beach boating etc.) Hot air baloon classics in indianola is also coming up soon.  If your into motorcycles they have bike nights every Friday in indianola too. Zoo brew every Wednesday....

desmoines,3ctm89,casbern,4,Fri Jul 10 18:42:13 2015 UTC,That sounds pretty sweet - I would definitely dig taking a long lunch to go watch a movie :)
desmoines,3ctm89,the_pressman,3,Fri Jul 10 19:32:39 2015 UTC,"You can already at the SCI IMAX theater. I snuck out once for a 11:30 of interstellar. I also work for myself, so by ""snuck out"" I mean I left."
desmoines,3ctm89,paramnesiac,3,Sat Jul 11 12:12:27 2015 UTC,"Oh god yes. Awesome location for it and a great style to the building. The city better work hard at making this work for both parties, living downtown I know that a lot of us here are dying for a movie theater, a grocery store and some kind of Target-like store. Then we'd rarely have reason to ever really leave."
desmoines,3ctm89,blakkattika,2,Fri Jul 10 20:37:43 2015 UTC,I love the building. Definitely a step in the right direction for our skyline. I'd love for this to come to fruition and have it be sustained by consistent tenancy. I'm positive the theater would do well. I just hope the theater opens before the whole project is done since the entire complex would take till 2019 to be completed.
desmoines,3ctm89,statbro,2,Sat Jul 11 15:04:55 2015 UTC,"Well given it probably wont start until 2017 (they said late 2016 at the earliest) and take 2 years, even if they phased it like that you're probably still looking at a 2018 date for the theater at the earliest.  There could be some benefits to that phasing though, given that parking loss will be painful for that immediate area they may want to get the garage (which would probably mean the theater as well) back up and going as soon as possible."

desmoines,3ctm89,fae-morrigan,5,Fri Jul 10 21:29:58 2015 UTC,Well they have to make money somehow. At least you didn't have to pay for it and it was probably quicker than watching an ad.
desmoines,3ctm89,Ki-Low,2,Fri Jul 10 22:49:03 2015 UTC,"I agree, the surveys are harmless and better than ad videos playing. It's just clicking 2 buttons, nothing so hard about that."
desmoines,3ctm89,fco83,-1,Sat Jul 11 01:30:46 2015 UTC,This was proposed a while ago. They chose HyVee instead. Glad to see the idea hasn't died.
desmoines,3ctm89,Ki-Low,2,Fri Jul 10 19:56:35 2015 UTC,This was not at all what was proposed awhile ago. That prior proposal was mainly just a 4 story theater
desmoines,3ctm89,fco83,-4,Fri Jul 10 20:09:08 2015 UTC,This is exactly what they proposed (movie plus games and other entertainment) except for the 32 stories. But it was definitely more than 4 stories because it was proposed to go in the building at the corner of 4th and Court where the bail bond use to be.

The latency is kind of crap, but it's the best I could find for my location.  I only bring this up because I asked around for weeks before someone at work knew someone in the area, and asked for me what they did for internet. It was a business that I could not find after extensive google searching because they had just started offering service.  I would try to find someone in the area and ask them what they're using.  Possibly call the local phone company and ask them if they have a list of internet providers.  Good Luck!"

If you are used to 10Mb/sec then even Wildblue's best bandwidth cap you would max out in 42 hours of 12Mb download.  All Satellite I've found has a bandwidth cap that after you go over you are either heavily throttled to 1-5Mb or charged huge fees. You also have around 500ms latency on even the best days. Only go with satellite if you don't stream, game, or use much data.   Source: Former Installer of Wildblue."

desmoines,3c7qzy,ProfMcFarts,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:01:13 2015 UTC,"Basically, credit unions and banks offer the same services.  However, there are some differences to think about when selecting where to place your money.    First of all, banks are owned by board members while credit unions are owned by its members.  As a result, banks tend to try to maximize profits for its board members while the same cannot be said for credit unions.  This means you'll usually get better loan rates, savings account rates, etc. from a credit union.  Secondly credit unions tend to be much smaller in scale and hold a collective theme for its members.  This doesn't mean you won't be able to access your particular credit union ATM when you aren't near your particular credit union.  Generally credit unions are part of a system which allows ATM use in various places.  However, members tend to share commonalities.  I am originally from California and one of the largest credit unions in the state is called USE Credit Union.  The commonality between members in the credit union are they are California residents.  One of the drawbacks to the smaller scale of credit unions is the lack of availability of physical branches outside a certain area.  For example, say you wish to travel to Europe.  There, you'd be able to find something like Bank of America branches to deal with your fiscal needs but would be unable to find USE Credit Union.  TLDR: there are costs and benefits to both.  You generally get better value in credit unions, but you also are unable to access branches outside their range of operation.  Personally, I used to save most of my money in a credit union but still use a bank account for the bulk of my actual purchases in my day to day."

On a more general note, I'd say when selecting which credit union is good for you, look for their interest rates, minimum account balance requirements, online banking features, fees (ATM, fees to open the account, etc.) and of course the prominence they have in your area of interest."

Actually, the park as a whole has been closed since at least yesterday at lunch. Technically, there shouldn't be anyone there at all.  Nice video though, OP. Very cool catch of the water bubbling up through the bridge gaps. I know the park was put there because it floods so often, but it sucks since I go there several times a week. The trail already had a relatively thick layer of dried up mud from the last flood a couple of weeks ago between the river and Fleur Drive, and when it rained the other day it was super hard to run on. I can only imagine the kind of mess they'll have to clean up after this one."

I think it's probably too late for the summer league because it's so small (although I joined up halfway through the year so anythings possible!) Right now is the time to reach out, the main winter teams that start up in the fall are likely looking for players to fill spots and most teams are pretty easygoing. Also if you know enough people they might even add a team for you. There's also usually open time a couple nights a week at the facility in Urbandale, and they also do breakfast hockey, but I haven't been there in a while so the schedule could have changed. Outside of that, the Iowa Wild have a smaller adult league that runs during the winter season."

The major fireworks show is Yankee Doodle Pops, and it's July 2.  There are a few displays going on during the actual 4th, including at the fairgrounds. I'm not very familiar with that area, so I don't know if there are bars you can go to with views of the fireworks or not.  If you go to Raccoon River Park (currently flooded...) which has fireworks on the 4th, you can probably grill out and water the fireworks over the river. There's really just one road in and out, though, so it gets pretty crowded. You'd have to go early if you want to get to the park and grill.  I also just got an email that Bernie Sanders will be at the Waukee parade, 2pm on the 4th. That's a suburb out west.

desmoines,3aulso,arooney88,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:43:11 2015 UTC,"Well, for ISPs in the DSM area, the big two are Centurylink (DSL) and Mediacom (Cable).  They each have positives and negatives and how ""good"" each is is really location dependent.  For example, for years, I was too far from one of the junctions to get DSL, and then when I could, it was one of the lower speeds (I think 256kps) compared to 5mbps with Mediacom.  However, if you move into an apartment, you may get it included in the rent or be locked into one or the other.  As for banks, we have a number.  What exactly are you looking for?  Free checking?  Business banking?  Loans?  As I like Iowa State Bank (for free checking) and have had good luck with Bankers Trust as well (and they have many more locations in the area).

desmoines,3aulso,ThePolemicist,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:52:41 2015 UTC,"I don't have a good doctor to recommend, but there's a good dentist on 42nd St, Dr. Zisko.   Since you like small businesses, I'd definitely stay in Des Moines. If you don't have kids, maybe the downtown or Ingersoll area would be a good place to look at, or possibly near all the shopping & live music places near Drake. Drake Neighborhood is the biggest neighborhood in Des Moines, and some areas are great while others can get kind of sketchy. You can be on a really great block and move one block over and see a bunch of abandoned houses, so you really have to get around to look. I like the Drake Neighborhood a lot because you can walk to almost everything you need. Beaverdale is arguably a little nicer than Drake, but it's more of a drive/ride to get most places.   If you go down south of Grand, you'll see older homes in more woodsy areas. This tends to be a more expensive place to live. It's lovely, but I think most people there end up having to go up to Grand or Ingersoll to get to any shops, restaurants, bars, grocery stores, etc."

I didn't even have to get out of my car - think ahead to how amazing that'll be when winter comes back around. There were a few items that were subbed from our original list, and the replacement products weren't my favorite. That's the only, quite trivial, gripe I can think of .

desmoines,3a80v8,dnageiw,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:41:04 2015 UTC,Lol. We rented some of those bikes and biked around downtown and then grays lake. After hit up cabco for a beer. It was a good time
desmoines,3a4k0a,mr_irwin_fletcher,3,Wed Jun 17 04:22:58 2015 UTC,"It's a local chain, but stop by Panchero's if you want a burrito. WAY better than Chipotle and all similar places in my opinion. There's one across from Jordan Creek Mall.  And if you have some time and money to kill, the best restaurant in Des Moines is Flying Mango. It's basically in the middle of the city so it  might be a bit of a drive, but they have the best ribs I have ever had."

desmoines,3a4k0a,Tea_Murder,5,Wed Jun 17 22:40:16 2015 UTC,"Mi Patria is an Ecuadorian place in a strip mall in WDM. Very good gigantic portions so you will get at minimum 2 meals out of an entree Best place I can think of off the top of my head in suburban chain hell. Otherwise head downtown.  Fong's and Tacopocalypse are my choices for ""Des Moines"" eats. While you are here hit up some of our craft breweries.  My favorite is 515 Brewing its a nano brewery taproom only, it is in the WDM area just a couple miles from Mi Patria.  Confluence is #2 for Des Moines Breweries they are downtown.  It is also Des Moines Craft Brew Week so you came at a good time.  OH, hit El Bait Shop downtown.  One of the best beer bars in the states ~150 taps.  IT is awesome and Nirvana for a beer lover like me."

desmoines,3a4k0a,realpsych22,5,Thu Jun 18 01:52:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly you can get anywhere in Des Moines in 15-20 mins. Look at Centro (italian), Djano (french), Splash (sea food). We also have des moines specials like Fongs (pizza/chineese combined), Zombie burger (crazy combos burgers), Tacocalypse (carzy tacos). Please also if downtown try the B-Cycles for a ride around. Also please view catchdesmoines.com for future events. We midwesternerss have pleanty more than most would expect to visit from our ""little""city."

desmoines,3a4k0a,realpsych22,-1,Wed Jun 17 14:23:30 2015 UTC,"This commenter has good advice. The criticisms of zombie burger are valid, but if you're a visitor, it's about the story as much as the food, and tacopacalypse and zombie burger get that. Don't bother with Fongs. Their place is dirty and their food tastes bad. I had better chinese pizza fusion at Blue Moon piano bar in WDM...another place you should check out btw."
desmoines,3a4k0a,Tea_Murder,0,Thu Jun 18 01:50:05 2015 UTC,Zombie burger is a fucking joke. You will end up paying $25 for a burger and fries that isn't really that good.
desmoines,3a4k0a,Paisley_hippo,2,Wed Jun 17 12:15:18 2015 UTC,"Their fries are meh, the zombie nachos are a MUCH better side.  You get a lot, so could easily share."
desmoines,3a4k0a,Tea_Murder,-4,Wed Jun 17 21:33:17 2015 UTC,It's still $25 for a mediocre burger. I've never gone there and not regretted it.
desmoines,3a4k0a,Alex3324,4,Wed Jun 17 22:42:19 2015 UTC,"WTF are you talking about? The burgers start out at about $7.  I don't care for them either, but there's no reason to exaggerate because you don't like the place. Obviously they're doing something right if I've never been able to get a table there without waiting 60+ minutes."
desmoines,3a4k0a,Tea_Murder,-5,Wed Jun 17 23:00:51 2015 UTC,"They are doing something right, they pander to idiotic hipsters. Any burger that STARTS at $7 is way overpriced. It's very possible to have a burger, side and a drink end up over $20. Keep going there if you want, I'll continue eating good food instead."

Raccoon River is probably best. Ewing is so-so. If you go to Raccoon River dog park, don't walk the trail without a full bottle of mosquito repellant. It's really bad back there. And yes, dogs need their time off the leash to get out their pent-up energy. They ought to get out and play with others and learn to behave properly."

desmoines,39gipg,airfoam,6,Thu Jun 11 20:31:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for saying this. I didn't want to be the ""hipster"" who said it first.   We moved from Denver last year, where almost everything is a chain. You have to drive in their heavy traffic to find places that aren't a chain. So near my mom's house is Five Guys, Red Robin, Chipotle, Starbucks. Near my in-law's house is McDonald's, IHOP, Starbucks, Panera. Near our old house was A&W, Chipotle. Near our old apartment was Whole Foods, Einstein's, Chipotle, Starbucks.   Our favorite thing about moving to Des Moines--other than the traffic--has been how local so much is. If I list any shop near my house, you will know where I live. When my in-laws came to visit us, they wanted Taco Bell. I don't even know where a Taco Bell is, so I told them we could go to Henry J's or Tasty Tacos. I hadn't heard about Tacopocalypse at the time. One morning, they wanted to go to IHOP or Village Inn. I don't know where those are in the Des Moines area, either. I told them we could go to Waveland Cafe. It's just really nice having such great choices out there, and the chain places aren't the main restaurant choices at all. You have to go search for them if you live in Des Moines."

I don't mean soulless in a ""wake up, sheeple"" kind of way. I mean soulless in a complete lack of identity way. The metro west of 35 might as well be any other affluent suburb in the Midwest. There's nothing that makes them stand out as unique. When Guy Fieri and Alton Brown came through Des Moines last year, they didn't stop to check out Fuddruckers or Joe's Crab Shack. They checked out the stuff that's unique to Des Moines because that's what gives a city character.   I could rant a little bit about grocery stores, too, if you'd like. Because seriously, why does anyone shop for groceries at Target?"
desmoines,39gipg,Tea_Murder,2,Fri Jun 12 04:38:38 2015 UTC,Exactly - why would you want Des Moines to look like every other city within an eight hour drive? Tear down the goddamn applebees' and open more places like Krunkwich.

If a locally owned place opens and doesn't suck, people will go to it.  It doesn't have anything to do with where you live.   Its just vastly easier for a business person to open a chain than it is to open something unique. So when someone wants to take that risk its easier to open where there's more people or other like-minded businesses.  East Village for example. It just needs someone to get the ball rolling."

desmoines,39gipg,Paisley_hippo,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:32:49 2015 UTC,"To lend a little credence to the people saying we don't need more chains we need more local...  Locally owned businesses contribute significantly more to the tax base. The profits stay with the business owner and get spent back into the community rather than heading out to a corporate headquarters out of town. Those owners also have homes they pay property taxes on, etc. Local businesses help to create a culture of entrepreneurship as owners serve as mentors and we know entrepreneurs are key to economic growth. And it's not just entrepreneurs in that same business. A kid might work for an independent burger place, learn a lot from the owner about running a business and taking risk and go open the next Apple. There are even studies showing that local businesses are far more likely to contribute to local charities.  Beyond that is the cultural benefits. You don't take a vacation to Portland and say ""Man, they had the best Target!"". When we build unique buildings and brands we give people so much more to hold on to, helping them to create a much tighter bond to the community and helping the population weather economic cycles.  And there is resilience as well. 5 chain burger joint locations vs 5 independent local ones. If that chain goes under, they all close. Much less likely that all five indies would go under at once. Apply this to mechanics, upper end retail, and other companies that pay higher wages and it can have a real impact on a community."
desmoines,39gipg,kcender,2,Fri Jun 12 15:53:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone is saying we don't need or want local business too. Nobody is arguing that local business isn't good.  However, people also like chains.  We can have both. Ikea for example; what local business could offer the same type of product?  Hand made furniture would cost a small fortune.  Most of what people are suggesting in this thread are restaurants. And whats wrong with that?  Nothing.  There's plenty of top notch local owned restaurants and a few that suck. The food industry is a tough nut to crack, involving shit tons of hours working, cooking, then doing the books, cleaning and innovating.  It takes a special kind of person who can put up with all that and be successful. Its far easier to open a chain that has already established menus, advertising, etc.  No one is stopping you from opening an awesome restaurant, the problem is people willing to open a restaurant are few and far between."

Local businesses help to create a culture of entrepreneurship as owners serve as mentors and we know entrepreneurs are key to economic growth.   Franchises are entrepreneurs too....   There are even studies showing that local businesses are far more likely to contribute to local charities.   I'd say Wells Fargo or Nationwide contributes more locally to Y.E.S.S than most other businesses....   and say ""Man, they had the best Target!""   Unless you are from Estherville or Dubuque and are in town for the State tournament....   5 chain burger joint locations vs 5 independent local ones. If that chain goes under, they all close. Much less likely that all five indies would go under at once.    If they have the same owners for all 5.... they all sink at the same time most likely...."

Police officer's actions do need to be held to a high standard, but people playing armchair quarterback really need to think about the shit cops have to deal with on a day-to-day basis before rushing to judgment and condemning the officer here.."
desmoines,39aj0m,bl1ndvision,3,Wed Jun 10 21:35:36 2015 UTC,This guy was definitely a threat to others in his car in whatever mental state he was in.  I don't know what exactly his erratic behavior was but I can understand how'd there be some grey area here.  It sounds like there was only one shot fired but that's all it took.  It could be a case of an officer with an itchy trigger finger and/or lack of training or it really could have been one of those instances where someone's being a straigh menace and is making their way towards you.    I genuinely don't know how I feel about this. I'm waiting for more info.

But going solely by the information that's publicly available, this wasn't a justified shot.   From the scanner chatter, she sounded amped up on adrenaline and maybe a little afraid. Regardless of training, cops are still people, and nerves make sense. But where training is supposed to count is in how the officer deals with those nerves.  I sincerely hope something comes to light through the investigation that makes this scenario make more sense. For the sake of her family, if nothing else. But there are no winners here. A man is dead and a young woman has to carry that forever. Plus, if the full body of evidence fails to justify the shooting, and if Sarcone (who is unsurprisingly very cop-friendly) decides to take take a strong stand on the matter, there's a potential murder 2 charge in her future."

desmoines,39aj0m,DigitalSterling,3,Wed Jun 10 13:35:07 2015 UTC,"The article says the policewoman was pursuing his vehicle in a slow-speed chase when he stopped the car, got out and began walking towards her cruiser, she opened fire from inside her vehicle window and he died later from his injuries in the hospital.

We don't know shit.  Also I think its a little outrageous to think she had time to get out of her car and use her taser on him. If he is within 10 feet of her and closing she doesn't have time to do that, walking or running. If he's within 20 feet and running you don't have time to do that. Hell you probably don't have time to do that if he's within 30 feet of her and is running towards her. Guy was fucked up on drugs and was a hazard to himself and everyone out there - and approached an officer after he fled from them... guy was asking to get shot based on that behavior.   Once we know all the facts we can then be armchair judges. What's weird is, scared that someone is approaching you I'm sure you'd do the same thing. I'm sure as hell not going to take my chances with someone having a gun or not having a gun when I can't tell and he's approaching me in this situation."

Did I get nervous when I would see two or three plain clothed Iraqis with AKs? Yea, but did I shoot them because I was nervous? No.  I don't need to be an eye witness to conclude that this woman got scared, panicked and killed an unarmed man that did not deserve death. She was in her patrol car with another officer, there is no way killing him was the best and only solutions.  Edit: and I think it's a little outrageous for you to immediately say an unarmed man deserved death rather than say that maybe, possibly the officer made a mistake.  And it's fine you would shoot an unarmed man because you were scared, just do me a favor and don't become a cop because as an officer you need to be able to control your fear and react to situations without shooting people."

Edit: and really if the guy was so dangerous why did they let him run up to their vehicle without them ever getting out of their own. Not like the guy is so fast that he could park, open his door, jump out and run at the cop's car all without the officers having time to exit their own vehicle and draw their weapons. If this is the case he and was right up on their car before they could react the police are poorly trained, don't park so close to the suspects car that you can react to him, once you see him exit his vehicle get out of your own, draw your weapon and start yelling at him to stop what he's doing."

desmoines,39aj0m,cadillaceldorado,3,Fri Jun 12 17:22:19 2015 UTC,Based on the edited audio and text I can only assume this...  http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2015/06/10/fatal-officer-shooting-ryan-bolinger-dancing-man-vanessa-miller/71010592/  The officers attempted to pull him over for quite some time even by the edited version. He simply wasn't stopping for them. The male officer did also say over radio that he seemed to be intoxicated with the 10-55 call.   I don't know if this is good or bad... But if you're out driving around like a complete moron and you refuse to pull over and then charge a cop car... You might get shot. You might get tasered or wrestled to the ground or whatever. That's the risk you take if you don't comply with law enforcement. Take it or leave it. If you want to fight about it in court later go ahead but in the moment do what you're told. You sure as hell can't be evading or resisting.   I was driving home from that area on 235 when it happened. I was heading eastbound towards Ankeny.

desmoines,393cak,bjosephson,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:01:22 2015 UTC,Well isn't that the point of a society?   If we say we need people to work at McDonalds and Wal-Mart shouldn't we make sure that they have enough eat?  A higher minimum wage would put more money into the consumers pocket and increase demand for goods plus take a lot of people off of SNAP and other government programs.
desmoines,393cak,bl1ndvision,-1,Tue Jun 9 18:19:35 2015 UTC,"Well, the purpose of our Federal Government, as found in the Preamble of the Constitution, is to ""establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity.""    Those are obviously somewhat vague goals, and people tend to interpret them differently.  However, notice that it says ""promote"" the general welfare, not ""provide"" the general welfare.  For sake of example, let's say we increased the minimum wage to $20/hour tomorrow.  McDonalds would have to increase the price of their food in order to compensate for that.  Now, a Big Mac meal would cost you $10 instead of $6.  In addition, they would likely lay off workers and may even close restaurants.  They would start automating as much of their work as possible, with better automated machines, or even robots.  Heck, they are already testing this out in some locations.    Now, instead of having a bunch of people making $8/hour, you have a lot of previously employed people out of work, and making nothing.  Leading to even more people needing government assistance.  How does that make the situation better for them?"
desmoines,393cak,Aefyn,2,Tue Jun 9 18:34:39 2015 UTC,"totally this. I program touch screens and other automation devices and the minimum wage hikes have me excited.   To make a touch screen connect to their fryers, stoves, shake machines, etc would be a cost. But when you are talking about $15 an hour plus some benefits it ends up costing McDonalds 50-75k a year for each employee. Even if we took out benefits and just did a flat hourly ignoring all other costs you get $31,200 paid to the employee.   Three employees then costs $100,000. A back of the napkin figure is about $5,000 per machine to automate and connect them all. There is a cost for the engineers and programmers time but in the end the return on investment (ROI) is under 2 years for fully automating a restaurant and taking out multiple employees. Just look at the QT across from the Firestone/Bridgestone plant. There is one guy working the food area instead of multiple people working there. You order through touchscreens and the order is processed and started without any employees working.  A high minimum wage just means lots of people are going to be automated out of a job. The PLC listed below costs under $300 and I could fully automate one machine for under $1,000. Linking them all together in a network that talks is a little more expensive but we are talking about 15+ year old technology not state of the art to do this.  TL;DR higher minimum wage will mean automation throughout many sectors. Retail, Service, Food.  Panera automation: http://goo.gl/ZOyQ9Z  Bill Gates on the minimum Wage: http://goo.gl/yMfyNE  Automation Costs: http://goo.gl/c8JBnV"

How exactly does this deal with poverty?  Where are these people supposed to get the skills and/or capital they need to pull themselves out of their situation?"
desmoines,393cak,bl1ndvision,2,Tue Jun 9 19:13:24 2015 UTC,"Minimum wage SHOULDN'T be a living wage.  It is the minimum starting wage.  You know how many places are looking for employees starting at $10-12/hour in the Des Moines area?  LOTS.  But there are still unemployed people.  Explain that to me.  Onto the topic of education... Who exactly should finance higher education?  Someone is going to pay for it one way or another.  Either through increased taxation, or by borrowing it.  There is no free lunch...no matter how many Democrats say something is ""free"", it just means it's subsidized by taxpayers."
desmoines,393cak,bjosephson,2,Tue Jun 9 19:33:37 2015 UTC,"Well you lost me there, minimum wage absolutely, positively, 100%, all the time should cover basic living expenses.  How is someone supposed to hold a minimum wage job AND pay for college AND pay for childcare if they can't even pay their electric bill?  The wealthy in this country pay nothing or next to nothing.  They have influenced elections on both sides of the political isle to get more tax breaks and favorable trade deals.    I support a new, higher marginal income tax bracket and the closing of special interest loopholes to finance our public education. I do believe that while the profit motive and private property rights are integral to a functioning economy, a healthy dose of altruism and helping fellow citizens reach their full potential will be good for everyone in the long run"

Don't think there are any bad intentions, but I love transparency on phishing questions like these.  But to answer your question since I would assume you're trying to IMPROVE on the mistakes of your peers, there's nothing more annoying than 10 million LinkedIn messages asking me to move from my current career. Even after telling people that I'm perfectly content in my position/company, I've received repeated follow-ups.  So yes, don't do that."
desmoines,38eb5x,PlusFiveSarcasmBoots,2,Thu Jun 4 12:02:56 2015 UTC,That would explain why Dynamo was reaching out to me via Linkedin...
desmoines,38eb5x,nacho_grande,3,Wed Jun 10 03:53:50 2015 UTC,"They contact you all the freaking time if you're on LinkedIn.  I had to stop accepting new connections from recruiters.  They share your info with other recruiters in the same company, and they call you to ""catch up"" and find out your current situation without actually having anything to offer.  The worst is when they try to get you into a contract position in which the company actually pays them, and then they pay you a percentage of what the company actually pays.  I almost got suckered into one of those.  They didn't disclose that info until after the 2nd interview."
desmoines,38eb5x,HeisenbergSG,3,Thu Jun 4 03:01:40 2015 UTC,"Generally any tech recruiters in Iowa are working for someone that's pretty fly by night, and really has NO long term positions available. They fill a temp position that might last from 3 day to 3 years. You work there a few months and find out the place has been on the potential chopping block for 7 years, and they have only management level permanent positions.   Possibly the worst of them is going to be Teksystems, which is a branch off of Aerotek.  I've never found any of them to have the least clue as to what they're doing. Completely unprofessional, don't waste your time even returning the call.   Or any agency that claims they have a position with HP, John Deere, any insurance company in town, etc, etc. Anything big enough to have an HR department, that is using a temp or recruiting agency, is hiring canon fodder.   About the only agencies in Des Moines that are not borderline sham operations  would be Manpower and Spherion, and even then, if you work for one of those places, 18 months down the line, you'll probably see the ENTIRE staff turnover.   If you can't find someone willing to direct hire in Des Moines, you are looking in all the wrong places."
desmoines,38eb5x,AnarchyBurger101,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:42:23 2015 UTC,You're not wrong.  But even a 3 day job is better than no job at all.  I had to temp for a couple years after getting laid off from Principal Mortgage when they sold off to Citi.  It sucks shifting around from job to job but just because you're working at a suck job doesn't mean you can't keep looking for a more permanent situation.
desmoines,38eb5x,Kimpak,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:59:23 2015 UTC,"There are a few employers who are snotty enough not to touch someone with a string of short term contracts, even if they're 1 to 1 1/2 years long.  Universities and other big businesses who've lost touch with the real world mainly.   The other problem is how unemployment works in certain states. If you've worked for some company that had you on for about 5 years, and they bought the farm, you've got probably a good 26+ weeks on unemployment to find another ""real"" job. If you get a 3 month contract, and end up back looking for jobs, you find yourself just about  untouchable by other companies who may have been interested in you before. Plus you've also blown your unemployment, and it might take 2-3 weeks to get back on.   In a conservative and generally clannish and closed minded place like Des Moines that has HR people living in the last century, you're gonna end up with a scarlet letter on  your head after working for the temps.  It's probably just better to hold out for a direct hire company rather than having to educate some 60-70 year old fossil still working  in an HR role about how the labor market has been unstable since the 90s, and  that the world they helped to create is a rapidly fading memory. :D"

My question is do you feel this is enough time to familiarize folks with the details stated in the ad as well as teach them what the regulations are regarding airspace and privacy?  It seems the FAA is super interested in UAV activity lately, and rightly so to a certain degree. What limitations are currently placed on UAVs for civilians? What is keeping a UAV pilot on Army Post Road from flying their UAV as a show for their friends, taking pictures as the vehicle gets sucked into an engine of a departing Allegiant flight full of pax?  I'm actually super interested in UAVs and think it is the next booming sector of aviation, but I question the level of detail provided by current generation schools of the who, what, when, where and why?"
desmoines,38a489,endlessmilk,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:41:19 2015 UTC,"We do go over safety, there's no doubt about that. Just because this thing has four propellers does not make it any different than the Foam R/C plane you can go buy at your local hobby shop. Technically Speaking, a $100 RC plane from your hobby shop is a UAV, and so is even a toy helicopter from the mall that you are flying outside. Best practice is to stay under 400 feet (the model airplane height restriction, away from people/cars/roads and 5 miles from an airport.)  This class is mostly about the recreational and safety aspects of model flight, as we are not making a drone that can do anything but fly.  The class mainly focus's on the technical construction and setup/maintenance of the quadcopter.  Civi UAV regulations are easily found of the FAA's website, all of the regulations are fairly up in the air (no pun intended) at the moment."
desmoines,38a489,sLnTsRvC,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:55:42 2015 UTC,"I am not condemning your class or UAVs in general, but as the idea becomes popular that you can own a UAV and fly it around without much supervision will eventually create problems for the National Airspace System.  RC airplanes need a decent patch of ""runway"" to operate out of if you aren't capable or comfortable with using the street outside your front door. The copter UAVs can be operated in very limited spaces which is the problem I see for airspace safety purposes.  I honestly do not see much difference between a person that buys a $500 UAV and a private pilot who flies his Cessna for fun on the weekends. You are still responsible for any damage you inflict on innocent bystanders, and with that said, proper education and training must take place (and possibly licensing) to ensure the safety of those around you.  I realize that most UAV operators see federal regulation as an infringement on their rights, but consideration has to be given beyond the basic needs of the operator.  Anyways, I was just curious and haven't met many local experts on the subject. Good luck with your endeavors in this field."

Iowa residents and nonresidents 16 years old and older are required to have a valid Iowa fishing license to fish farm ponds and privately owned lakes. Only owners or tenants of land and their children under 18 may fish on such lands without a license.

Mediacom also has caps on all of their services, ranging from 250GB - 1TB+ and are more expensive, even with contracts.  CenturyLink doesn't do contracts or caps on any of their services."
desmoines,37pzqe,FiddlingCactus,1 point,Fri May 29 15:23:13 2015 UTC,"Couple questions, if you don't mind answering them.   For Mediacom, how often are they down?   You say faster and slower, is the gap really that big between the two? And how fast is the slow from CenturyLink?   And how do the prices compare minus the data cap?   I'm moving from West Virginia to Des Moines in about a week and our best option has slow service and data caps. I guess I'm not really in the position to complain about either of those, haha."
desmoines,37pzqe,_WES_,2,Fri May 29 16:02:02 2015 UTC,"I live in Bondurant right now, which is on the other side of the city. so you should be able to get at least the speeds I get or better.  Mediacom can go up to 150 Mbps+ with a 2 TB cap (costs about 100 the first year, and I don't know what after). They also have 100 Mbps for around 70 and I think a 1 TB cap, and then 50 Mbps with a 350 Gb cap. There are also slower speeds but I never really looked into those myself.  CenturyLink I had 40 Mbps for about $40. They have advertisements that we should be getting 1Gbps, but who knows when or how much.  I've never really had problems with either of them going down. I work from home so I would probably notice. Mediacom occasionally goes out early in the morning (1-4 AM). Never really had an issue during the day. CenturyLink almost never went down when I had it, but they took 2 weeks AFTER the install date to get it working. They kept blaming me and saying that everything was setup on their end. But after complaining for days and I was out of the house my (retired) neighbor said they pulled up and hooked it up in front of the house. So they were lying the whole time. Never got an explanation from them or refund for the 2 weeks that I didn't get service for. But once they are up and running, I would say it's easier to work with."
desmoines,37pzqe,IGetThis,2,Fri May 29 16:19:06 2015 UTC,I just moved from Bondurant about four months ago and they had just started offering the 12Mbps.  I had 40 when I lived in Ankeny and was waiting years for them to bring that service to Bondurant.  Now I'm in Grimes and I'm waiting once again for 40.
desmoines,37pzqe,FiddlingCactus,5,Fri May 29 16:48:47 2015 UTC,"Note to self, before moving find out where FiddlingCactus is, then don't move there because the internet sucks.  To be fair, I live in a newly developed area, so maybe they just added it here but the older homes are still not able to get 40."

desmoines,37pzqe,_WES_,1 point,Fri May 29 17:37:22 2015 UTC,"Your speeds may vary depending on location. When I lived in an apartment downtown (Sherman Hill) the fastest available speed for CenturyLink was 12 or 15 mbps. Now that I'm in Ankeny, the best plan is 40 mbps (same monthly price). I really despise Mediacom, and find CenturyLink slightly more tolerable. What we really need is something like GoogleFiber but that's just a dream for now!"
desmoines,37pzqe,hotshotjosh,2,Fri May 29 18:55:38 2015 UTC,"Everyone has different experiences but my personal experience was in Urbandale (right next to Clive) and it was down about once a month.  Typically on a Thursday or Friday and they couldn't ever send someone out until the following Tuesday.  It was almost like clockwork and for the amount of money they wanted, it was unacceptable.  I can't remember the last time I had an outage with CL.  Can't speak for their customer service since I never have to call them.  Speed wise.  Mediacom offers 50-100Mbps in most areas while CenturyLink will offer 12-20 most places, 40 tops in a few.  I have 12 down with them now and I have no issues streaming to multiple devices or online gaming.  CenturyLink is definitely the better choice since they don't have caps, cheaper service, and no contracts.  Currently paying $29.99 for 12Mbps."

Mediacom has caps, but they have a solid promotion going on right now which is why im cancelling CL this week to go with them again (caps made me leave in the first place but they have some good promos for the 1TB cap right now).   I had a billing issue with CL even before I had their service, they sent me a modem even though I told them I'd use mine and was told for about 2 months that everything would be cleared. Finally took the issue up with their twitter account and got that resolved fairly quick since it's more transparent. This week I've been w/o internet since Friday and its scheduled to be fixed today because get this, they have no techs on weekends...  So for OP, it's pick your poison sadly."
desmoines,37pzqe,lando786,2,Tue Jun 9 20:14:23 2015 UTC,"Like the others have pointed out, Mediacom and Centurylink are the majors in the area (though there are various other options, usually reselling other services).  However, which is better is really dependent on where you are at.  Last time I looked, parts of Clive were limited to some of the lower speeds from Centurylink, due to the distance from the nodes.    Mediacom has been pretty hit or miss for me.  There have been some years, where the service has been out 3-5 per week (which was probably due to physical damage to the cable) and others where I haven't noted any outages.  They do like to pile on the fees (including one if you don't have other services with them), have usage caps, and getting service can be problematic (usually will be scheduled for 2-3 weeks from the date of the call and will give you a 4 hour window of when they may be able to get to you)."

I also stream Netflix and HBO through my Chromecast and AppleTV pretty regularly and haven't had a problem.    I'd recommend CenturyLink."

desmoines,37pzqe,arowan21,2,Fri May 29 21:33:01 2015 UTC,"Check out Alliance, too. It's CenturyLink service through a local company. I've had pretty good success with them, and the bill is quite reasonable, less than $75 bucks. Personally, I prefer to deal with a local entity whenever possible."
desmoines,37pzqe,drcranknstein,1 point,Sat May 30 03:29:20 2015 UTC,"Mediacom has better customer service (which is still laughable).  Centurylink has more consistent DL and UL speeds.  Mediacom has faster peak speeds, but there is a data limit.  Centurylink seems to be cheaper (usually).  Both are pretty equal in the reliability department. Centurylink is a bit worse, but only because of storm issues I had with them (see below).  Mediacom bundles nicely into a cable plan.  Centurylink bundles with DirectTV, which will go down during storms.  Speaking of storms, I have had Centurylink go down more consistently during storms as well. Losing both internet and satellite TV sucks big time.  Currently on Mediacom, but honestly you will just have to go by trial and error for what area you are living in. If you find a place where most neighbors have Centurylink, Mediacom may very well be consistently faster for you since no one is really using the bandwidth in your area. Just really depends on which above items mean more to you."
desmoines,37pzqe,DCDVath,1 point,Fri May 29 21:52:58 2015 UTC,"If customer support is important to you, and trust me, it will be with either, I'd recommend Mediacom. Their phone reps are shit, but their forums are great. CL is just shit, they have no forums and their 'chat now' is usually closed during normal business hours. Also CL's techs don't work weekends so if our internet goes out on a Friday, your SOL until at the very least Monday (with any luck).  Mediacom usually has no-contract bundles for new customers so you might want to check them out, CL is a one-year contract. Depending on the area you might get good speeds (though I think their upload is <1Mbps so be sure to check that out if your a streamer or plan on hosting anything from your home."

desmoines,37o12h,ThePolemicist,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:05:16 2015 UTC,"But even then, that's not 37th.   When my brother moved onto 34th, he knew it was kind of on the edge of a ""bad"" neighborhood, but he also felt like things were getting better for that area, not worse. Besides, by him moving there, it helped improve things. For one, there wasn't an abandoned house on the street. A couple neighbors moved in with families, and that helps a ton, too. Anyone who is looking for a house and sees families and kids outside knows it can't be that dangerous. And the area is packed for Beggar's Night! So it's really not bad.   But if you tell someone not to even move to 37th, which is even farther west, you're just making a good neighborhood appear undesirable. If no one wants to move there, then it absolutely will go down the shitter. The best thing to do is keep those areas up and busy by not talking badly about them when they're not dangerous."

desmoines,37i718,ChimiHoffa,1 point,Thu May 28 18:51:46 2015 UTC,As companies get tired of paying the exorbitant costs of operation on the coasts I think they will start to open up more locations in the Midwest. Whether or not that will be Des Moines remains to be seen.

desmoines,37cn6p,purplepiper,3,Tue May 26 17:27:37 2015 UTC,I'm surprised to see The Mountain Goats again. Is he easy to book since he's a former local?  Any indication if this is the full band or just John Darnielle like last time?
desmoines,37cn6p,fartmachiner,1 point,Wed May 27 00:09:30 2015 UTC,It is John Darnielle solo. The show will be in the First United Methodist Church in Downtown Ames which will be really beautiful. The Mountain Goats have a new album and this year is the celebration of the 5th year of Maximum Ames.
