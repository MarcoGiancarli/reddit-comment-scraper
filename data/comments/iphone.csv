They don't have the same kinds of inside sources that Gurman does, but as an Apple news aggregator, they're excellent.  Also, you might want to look at Apple analysts. People who understand the company and its history tend to have a lot of interesting (and often accurate) things to say about its future.

It's reasonably protective, but more importantly, it makes the phone easier to grip. The 6 Plus is ridiculously slippery without a case, and having something nicer to hold on to like leather means you're going to drop the phone less to begin with."
iphone,3e3k8a,greatcaffeine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:59:11 2015 UTC,"In the same boat. I don't usually get life proof cases but Speck's candy shell grip looks good. It meets military drop test standards if that is enough protection for you. And it doesn't add too much bulk which is good.   Or for the less protective and more show off-ive I am thinking about the Moshi iGlaze XT. It sounds like it's the most scratch resistant clear case, has a good front bezel, and is thick enough to get rid of the protruding camera problem.   But if you get some life proof or otter box cases make sure you look up how they fair in a drop test. (even a ridiculous 50 or 100 foot one if you can) Made me rethink what cases to get, some slimmer ones are better than the life proof ones."

You'll need to buy something else."

iphone,3e38qa,TheFirstHunter,2,Tue Jul 21 16:51:27 2015 UTC,Wait for iPhone 6s. Jailbreak might not be available for a while on iOS 9.
iphone,3e38qa,thatsthequy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:58:00 2015 UTC,"If you need a new phone today, the iPhone 6 Plus is awesome. I'm using one now. If you can wait two months, the iPhone 6s Plus will be better. You have to decide which route you want to take.  As for switching from Android to iOS: it all depends on how you were using your phone. The iOS launcher (called Springboard) is very different from Android launchers, as all of your icons are always visible. Nothing is hidden in an app drawer, and you can only have blank spaces at the end of a page (unlike Android, where you can put icons anywhere). It's hard to say if that's really better or worse, but it's definitely different.  You won't be able to set default apps, and sharing between apps is very limited.  Chrome isn't all that good on Android, but it's worse on iOS. Apple doesn't allow third party browsers to use their own rendering engines, so Chrome is stuck with a crappy, low-performance webview that struggles with JavaScript heavy pages. Use Safari if you care about performance.  If you had the feature enabled to use the ""Ok Google"" hotword, the equivalent ""Hey Siri"" doesn't work unless your phone is plugged in. There's probably a jailbreak tweak to fix that (for now).  Jailbreaking will be considerably more difficult in iOS 9 because of the ""Rootless"" feature they're adding for security."
iphone,3e2da0,TheOfficialApollo,2,Tue Jul 21 12:42:02 2015 UTC,"Deleted backups don't go somewhere magical to be used later. They're deleted. Not to be a dick, but if you don't understand how that works, you probably shouldn't be using beta versions of an operating system.  Depending on how much activity you have on your filesystem, you might be able to get an old backup back with Recuva. Just tell it where to look and it'll try to search the drive for deleted files."
iphone,3e2da0,greatcaffeine,-6,Tue Jul 21 14:41:48 2015 UTC,well mr asswipe theres plenty of shit you delete that goes to the recycle bin. so since i figured it was an actual file that you can access thru the system i figured it would go to the bin but since it wasnt there it had to be somewhere. but alright thanks anyways.
iphone,3e2da0,greatcaffeine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:07:54 2015 UTC,"I understand your frustration, and in spite of the name-calling, I'm not going to bother downvoting you (although it looks like others have already gotten around to that). Please realize that this subreddit is a free resource for help, and I just did the best I could to assist with a problem you created for yourself. You are not entitled to anything here, and calling me an asswipe isn't going to change the fact that you deleted your own backup.  Please try to use Recuva (linked above) to recover the backup file. It can't hurt, and it might help. Aside from that, I recommend doing the following in the future:   Create regular backups of your computer. There are services like Crashplan and Backblaze that offer cheap plans to automate the process with unlimited storage. Not only would that have helped you recover the lost iPhone backup in this situation, but it's a good idea to have backups in general. Don't install beta software on your primary device, or a device that you don't want to lose data on. I'm honestly not sure why Apple made the beta available to everyone so early, so part of the blame is on them. If you must install beta software, at least wait a couple iterations for some of the kinks to be worked out. Every beta OS is pretty rough around the edges at this stage. Don't delete backups unless they're a) far too old to be useful, or b) consuming so much space on your system that they're causing other problems. Even if the backups are too large, there are things that can be done to redirect them elsewhere (like an external hard drive). Let me know if you want any help with that, if you're interested."

If you haven't used Swappa before, it's actually pretty nice - sellers are verified, and everything is legit.  Another option if you want to get your feet wet would be Craigslist. You can pretty easily find iPhones for sale at good prices in most cities, but you have to be a little more diligent about making sure everything is legitimate before any money changes hands. Always meet the seller at your carrier store; this allows the carrier to verify the device isn't stolen, and also allows you to make sure the iCloud lock is disabled so the phone can be activated again.  Final thought: have you considered buying an iPod Touch to get a feel for iOS? They're cheaper than any phones you're going to find, and I bet you can find them for ridiculously low prices used."

Throughout that time I purchased a ton of screens from places like eBay and Amazon and I got screwed over a few times. Bad quality LCDs, non-shatter resistant digitizers, frame separation, etc. The time and money spent handling returns and telling my customers they had to wait was unbearable. iFixit is a bit more expensive for a part but that's because you get what you pay for. Not to mention we now have this Lifetime Warranty. That means if you put on a screen or part of ours and it fails on you a month, a year, three years down the line we'll replace it free of charge! We even pay for the shipping on a replacement. To know more about iFixit's quality check out http://www.ifixit.com/quality.   Thanks!"

iphone,3e1jjs,fuckshar,0,Tue Jul 21 06:22:45 2015 UTC,"You're just hitting bad luck. Apple tests their phone's durability very rigorously before releasing it into the world. But if you drop a piece of glass and aluminum, you're gonna have a bad time.  With that said, my first iPhone 4S was built like a tank. I can't count the number of times I dropped that thing. Hardwood, tile, concrete, accidentally had it fly across the room and hit my nightstand, etc. Both sides were glass but they never ever broke.  I'd recommend you get a very solid, sturdy case for your phone. I personally hate cases and never use themâ€”I regretted it slightly when I dropped my phone on concrete and the screen shattered, but that's what AppleCare+ is for. My sister dropped her iPad outside and the bezel shattered. We had it replaced and several months later she did the exact same thing again. Now her new iPad is in a rather thick, sturdy plastic case. I think it makes the device awkward to hold, and in general is ugly as fuck. But I think we prefer a working device to paying for repairs every time there's an accident."

iphone,3e1jjs,greatcaffeine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:54:25 2015 UTC,"The iPhone 6 definitely seems to be a little less durable than previous iterations; several people I work with that have never shattered their screens before have shattered the screen of the iPhone 6. I chalk it up to two things: first, the device itself is much more slippery and prone to being dropped than previous iPhones. Second, the rounded glass on the front of the device represents a weak point and an opportunity for the glass to hit things more often.  Apple's silicone and leather cases actually do a pretty good job of preventing such accidents, because they deal with both of the problems at once. Either case offers substantially more grip than the slick, rounded aluminum, and they also have lips around the edges of the screen so it basically can't hit the ground unless something is protruding from the ground/floor. The cases are also pretty slim, so you don't end up with something hideous like an Otter Box."

You can also go to Settings->Cellular, scroll down and there should be a breakdown of all the apps that you have on your phone and how much cellular data they have used since the last reset (a reset can be done in the same place at the very bottom of the list, where it says ""Reset Statistics). Might be useful if you are not sure, what app or service is using up your data.  There's also this app on the App Store called Onavo Extend.

You're pretty unlikely to have anything else go wrong after the first year.  Some guy on a blog did a cost/benefit analysis and buying Applecare+ was never the better deal when he took into account the probability of actually needing it. If you are more likely than the average person to break your phone, the math swings more in favour of buying Applecare+.  Personally I've had iPhones for 7 years and not had one break either due to a manufacturing defect or by my own hand outside the 1-year warranty period. Hindsight being 20/20, that's $700 saved on Applecare+. I could have repaired two phones for the full out-of-warranty cost, or repaired 6 broken screens, and still had money left over.  Of course peace of mind may be worth something to you as well."
iphone,3e06x5,cinnamon14,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:24:22 2015 UTC,Yeah if anything happens to the phone it would be because of a normal drop. I am kinda leaning towards a clear slim case which is scaring me but will probably go with the more protective case.

I've only broken my iPhone once, I tripped and it took a nice flight into concrete. But I have had buttons get stuck. The camera lens (pre-sapphire) got scratched up several times. I had an iPad with a failing logic board 20 months into it's life. Countless replacement 30 pin and lightning cables, a failed optical drive on my Mac, a failing Wi-Fi antenna, etc.  AppleCare isn't just about accidents, things can just go wrong on a device. Yes it's possible to not have any of those incidentsâ€”my iPad 3 is nearing it's 3rd year without a single incident, so that was definitely a wasted $100 on AppleCare+. But for all my other devices, it was definitely worth it. Both my iPhone are on AppleCare+. So far no incidents, but we're less than a year in."

iphone,3e06x5,coday182,2,Tue Jul 21 01:01:51 2015 UTC,"Yes and more yes.  I have NEVER bought extended warranties on my electronic devices, and my iPhone 5 was the first.  Then did the same with my 6.    You can tell yourself ""I will be very careful and not plan on having an accident,"" but I'm pretty sure everyone has that same approach and accidents still happen.  I'm probably harder on my phones than anyone else I know, and I've used applecare+ to replace 3 or 4 phones by now.  But the peace of mind is the best part.  These are some of the things I can do:   Use my iPhone ""naked"" and get full enjoyment of the phone's slender & sleek design.  No otterboxes.  How much $$ is that worth to you? Instead of leaving my phone up at the condo because I'm afraid of sand/salt/moisture (and if I do bring it to the beach, it's in 3 zip locks), I can take my phone to the beach to take pictures, go on walks, etc.  Without worrying.  $$$? If my phone is broke and unusable, I don't have to play the ""do you think apple will cover it?"" game, and I don't have to wait for it to be sent off and fixed.  If they can't fix mine in the store, they'll replace it on the spot.   Let my phone be the ""jukebox"" plugged into the boat's sound system when we're laking.  I'm not worried about mine getting water or booze spilled on it.    The costs-benefit analysis, I don't think, takes that into consideration.  Maybe somehow it does work out so you'd save money in the end by not getting it, but I don't think that works out the same for everybody.  An Otterbox cost like $10 less than Applecare+.  At $50 deductible per incident, plus $99 up front, that's a total of $1300 its saved me."

So if those contacts on facebook, even if they are linked to your contacts on iOS, dont have accessible contact information, you wont get updates on iOS contacts. Even if they have a profile.   So you would have to find a contact, linked to one of your iOS contacts, that has a phone or email address that is accessible by you on their Facebook page, and see if they have an updated photo.   Facebook narrowed what information would update because people complained about iPhone owners getting access to their private contact information."

I believe Sprint has a program where you can rent an iPhone for $15 a month or something like that.   It's an unfortunate situation, especially on the heels of a new device launch. But the iPhone is a high-demand, premium, starting at $649 product. You're not going to borrow one for two months without it costing you, regardless of the means. I'd suggest you just get an iPhone 6 and stick with itâ€”the next version is an S model anyway. But if you're insistent on the latest and greatest, those are your options."
iphone,3dzn4s,AlbinoAlex,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:13:16 2015 UTC,"This. I just got my 6 from Tmo with their jump on demand promotion, and pay 15 a month for it. When the 6s comes out I'll jump to it, and I also can jump 2 other times to whatever I want. This is perfect for me because I like to try many different phones to see which I like. This generation I've settled on the 6. We'll see what changes in a couple months, but with this plan I have the freedom to try all my options at least. I love T-Mobile for this."
iphone,3dzn4s,atman8r,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:12:31 2015 UTC,"http://swappa.com/buy/apple-iphone-4s-verizon/us  You can get a used iphone 4s for less than $100. A 5 or 5c is $150 or so. There are lots of decent Android phones in the same price range.  Just get a used or cheap one that works for your carrier. Upgrade when you want. Then, keep the old one as a backup or sell it."
iphone,3dzn4s,my02,0,Mon Jul 20 23:02:16 2015 UTC,"You have 3 options :    Buy a windows phone (Lumia 520 or 521 for unde $50) which should last you until the release of the 6s. You should keep this phone around as a ""spare"" in case you lose the 6s.  Borrow an older phone from a friend. Obviously you will have to return the phone and keep it in mint condition.  Get a prepaid phone. All prepaid phones work for their respective carriers, no matter what contract you have. You can throw away the SIM these prepaid phones come with and use yours."

iphone,3dyocx,slandeh,2,Mon Jul 20 16:47:27 2015 UTC,"If it's swollen, it's covered. I've replaced a ton of out of warranty iPhone 5's with swollen batteries. It's considered unsafe, so Apple is making sure anyone with s swollen battery gets service, regardless.  It's a quality program, when the tech puts in the issue (iPhone 5 > Physical Damage > Swollen Battery), it will kick the device into Quality Program and will tell the tech the phone needs to be replaced.

iphone,3dyocx,wowurdope,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:26:33 2015 UTC,I just went through this issue. I called in and they sent me to the safety department. I finally convinced them to send me a new phone. It took a bit to talk them into it.  The other option was a $10 battery off amazon and replace it myself.
iphone,3dyocx,wowurdope,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:41 2015 UTC,"I had this issue, and Apple told me they were required to replace it for free because it's a safety hazard for the user. Just back it up and bring it to the Apple store, they'll almost certainly replace it for free.   This happened to me last summer when my model iphone 5 was eligible for a battery replacement.   edit: they replaced the entire phone, not just the battery, which was awesome because my other phone was fucked up and completely damaged. I was leaving 3 days later to travel for like 7 months so this was killer."
iphone,3dyocx,mike413,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:24:42 2015 UTC,that would be awesome! i have very minor wear on it and am looking to upgrade my phone very soon and that would help getting rid of it! obviously i dont want to sell a phone to someone that could potentially blow up which is why i want to get it fixed first. - Thanks for the response
iphone,3dzea7,getorchard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:41:58 2015 UTC,I wish it was optimized for iPhone 6 and 6+.
iphone,3dzea7,thomaswsu,2,Mon Jul 20 21:32:13 2015 UTC,Soon! Our first step was to add in all the pricing data and set up the app to run on the 6 and 6+ so we've had to rely on auto-scaling for now.
iphone,3dzea7,CreamyKeefer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:40:54 2015 UTC,What about buying? I'm Canadian and finding a 6 for that price would be awesome
iphone,3dzea7,AlbinoAlex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:18:22 2015 UTC,"Definitely! You can see our Canadian inventory here. Looks like we don't have a 6 in stock right now (they move really fast) but we should be getting more soon. Because the market is a bit different in Canada and the retail prices are higher off the bat, we have different prices set between US and Canadian phones. Feel free to PM me for a promocode though!"
