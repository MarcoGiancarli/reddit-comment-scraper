It compares this list with the list of addons you already have, and if you dont have a specific addon, it will download that addon. Any addon you download while connecting to a server is a temporary addon, that usually gets deleted after you leave the server or after you restart GMod. So whatever you're downloading from the server is basically just stored in a cache.

gmod,3d1s85,sleepdyhollow,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:00:50 2015 UTC,"So many good stories.  Recently I've been playing 1942RP a lot and trying out different jobs. One game I decided to play as a weapons dealer but change my job title to ""Hotel Manager"". I bought up all the doors in an apartment building and threw up a sign and proceeded to advertise. I even got a news reporter to come by and film the place.  I ended up getting all my rooms filled. The first was bought by a nice baker named Albert Breach, the second by a pharmaceutical chemist named Dylan I think (can't quite remember), and the third by a civilian named Ivan.  Another weapons dealer came by and asked to be my guard dog (his job title was German Shepherd), I figured why not. Little did I know my new guard dog was a total sociopath....  Things were good for a while, I made money on the side selling weapons to my tenants. But soon enough Nazi soldiers would come by thinking they could run inside and check rooms. Without hesitation my ""dog"" would kill them with tomahawks (he LOVED tomahawks). My dog killed about 5 or 6 nazis before the reich started to take notice and sent out more patrols. When an officer came by saying my dog told him he'd ""break his legs"", he demanded his arrest, along with the bakers for also killing nazi soldiers.  Eventually this led to an all out gun fight, and out of fear for my image I moved the hotel.  Also, did I mention my dog abused me? First he would ask for a paycheck, and after paying him what little money i could afford he would lament about how he ""only"" has half a million dollars left from the lottery........  He would also periodically break my legs, and at the new hotel he even outright killed me.  Afterwards I added him on steam....  TL;DR Set up a hotel, got a guard dog, guard dog was a dick.  Edit: ALSO, my tenants stories went like this  Ivan essentially just sat in the lobby and watched everything happen, he didn't really do much. When i checked on his room once I saw he had no weapons, no production items, just simple furniture. A nice guy. He also bought a room at my new hotel and did the same thing.  Albert went to jail a couple times I think, but he only ever baked bread in his room, he also followed me to the new hotel.  Dylan however, blew himself and a friend up in a chemical explosion in his room one day. He had a habit for leaving the chemicals on unattended....."

gmod,3cui5i,IZEAS,8,Fri Jul 10 21:52:28 2015 UTC,"I know a few.   Antoine Delak: Good combination of stupid humor and good animation. CrazyScoutFIN: Averages a video per month, also a good humor/animation combo. Dr Face: THE best animator. His Gmod looks better than most SFM. Top quality content. Eltorro64RUS: Arguably my favorite Gmodder, he does the stupid/crazy kind of animation yet he makes it look good somehow, and his videos are just insane. Honestly, he is a modern, improved version of Rubberfruit. EthioMod: Maker of TF2 Air, sadly inactive. FINHeavich: Maker of FailFort, also inactive (though may return ""soon""). Genowhirl70: Very active, nice guy too. GlassArrow: Classic Gmodder; inactive for 3 years. Surprisingly underrated. Kamiflage: Yep, I make Gmod videos :0 I'm too busy to produce much but it's my goal to one day animate like the best. I'm currently working on being the first to animate in 60fps. Kugawattan: Makes TF2 freak videos. He's really gotten better over time. Lemurfot: Used to (?) make neat horror Gmod videos that were horribly ""animated"", but had really great story. Now he just makes really crappy short videos, but I hope he'll return to his old style one day. LETheCreator: TF2 freak guy, was kind of ""average"" though his most recent full video is very well animated. MegaGFilms: I don't remember this guy but he has a lot of subs somehow. MisterMisteroO: This guy is on the path to being a better animator than Dr. Face. Maker of the epic Pootisman series. Definitely check this guy out. MoronMaster: A Gmodder who sadly quit right before he got really good. Depressing. OluapPlayer: Decent TF2 freak guy. OmegaFreege: His style is a fusion of Eltorro64RUS and other Gmodders. Photoping: Mostly SFM but has some Gmod. Raikujo: Old retired Gmodder, has a couple really good videos. Rhapsidous: Old retired Gmodder Rubberfruit: One of the most well-known (and retired) Gmodders, super unique and stupid style that many try to copy and few get even close to replicating it. SarisKhan: TF2 freak videos with good story. SgtPeruna: I don't remember him, but I'm subbed to him ShermanZAtank: TF2 freak videos with emphasis on story, used to hardly animate but has improved recently. STBlackST: REALLY good animator. That Gray Cartoon Pony: Good animator that makes super charming videos. I'm not a brony, and most videos don't contain ponies (or it's obvious that they do, and can be avoided), but some videos are FANTASTIC but end in extremely forced pony scenes that kill the pace of the video. Still, great videos. theTig3r42: Kind of like Rubberfruit, but his videos make more sense. He has returned from the dead to give the living haircuts to animate once more! TheUltimateEbil: Somewhat new Gmodder who is great at animating. This guy is incredible and is only getting better. Ugotaphonenumber: If you like really stupid crap and smexuals, this is your guy."

gmod,3cmhzd,ScoopJr,-1,Thu Jul 9 03:36:27 2015 UTC,Well for instance my viewers wanna play FNAF hide and seek. How would I go about doing that?
gmod,3cmhzd,ScoopJr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:23:23 2015 UTC,You'd go to the steam workshop on steam.  Subscribe to the hide and seek gamemode. Open up gmod to download the gamemode.  Then get the .gma extractor to extract the gamemode files to upload to your servers gamemode directory. After that you go into the settings and edit what gamemode your server starts on and restart the server.  The only you'll have major difficulty is when you want to add custom addons because not all addons work with each other and some addons are more stable then others. E.G. One addon would literally prevent my server from starting up while others work perfectly fine.
gmod,3cmhzd,ScoopJr,0,Thu Jul 9 14:07:31 2015 UTC,If you're available would you like to add me on steam and maybe help me out with this? :D I still haven't bought the server but I wanted to be ready before I did this

I'm sure it will just stay as it is so that people playing will still continue as if nothing happened when 2 is released.

If anyone suggests Hamachi to you, promptly laugh and never speak to them again.  All you gotta do is download Evolve, make a party, invite your friend(s) to the party and start up GMod. I haven't played for a while but if I'm not mistaken, when you press play it has you tabbed under singleplayer by default, but you can use the menu to choose how many players you want in your server. Fill in the settings to your liking and start it up.   Now, since you're hosting, all your friend has to do is go into the Evolve lobby, and to the right of the window should be a list of the party members. Click on your name and it'll say ""Copy IP Address."" This is the IP that Evolve gives you. Now, I do believe you need to be in a level of GMod, singleplayer works just fine, and have your console enabled. Pressing ""~"" will open to console if it's enabled, otherwise you'll have to navigate to the multiplayer menu and check ""Enable console"" or something along those lines.  Now, once the console is open, the friend types ""connect_xxxxxxxxx"" and presses enter. Replace the x's with the hosts IP and you should be in.  If this doesnt work, let me know and I'll see if I described anything wrong, I haven't slept for like 16 hours or so, so I very well could have missed something.

gmod,3c8nk6,NitrogenNitrate,2,Sun Jul 5 22:53:29 2015 UTC,Isn't it just offset of the model? Try to position legs so they're on Z:0 coordinate.
gmod,3c8nk6,Adam-Name,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:13:43 2015 UTC,"Sorry for being really clueless, but just a few questions.  When you say ""On the Z:0 coordinate"", what exactly are you referring to? I'm thinking of the main X/Y/Z plane thats used to create your model in blender, but is it something else? Also, what is the Z:0 coordinate?  And by legs, you mean the legs of the model or the legs of the reference skeleton?  Again, sorry for these stupid questions."
gmod,3c8nk6,Adam-Name,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:33:50 2015 UTC,"I've never done any models and have basically no knowledge of 3D graphics, but it seems like the model has just offset.

Sure, some kids are going to be annoying as hell, but the same goes to adults. If you get off your high horse of being a ""mature proper adult"", you will find that there are a lot of awesome communities with both kids and adults that make the game fun. I love the game mode PERP, which is basically DarkRP if it didn't go to shit, with more features and more serious role play, and have a ton of fun on it. Also, sometimes I'll hope into a random TTT server and have a blast with the people there, even making new friends. And yeah, some of the people there might be young (the horrors, I know) but if you humble yourself enough, and get past the high pitch voice, you might find some really cool people.   Now, that isn't to say the game doesn't have a lot of problems with the community. There are definitively a lot of jackasses on the popular servers. But if you scroll down a little bit, and find a small server, you might just find some new friends. cue awwww sound effect  EDIT: Oh, also not much as been added.

This looks familiar, like a player I had to absolutely ruin with one of my Wire weapons because he was possibly aimbotting and being an asshole.  Whenever anyone got close to him, when he tried to shoot someone, it immediately targeted that closest player. He would turn around and do crazy snap shots towards people who were noclipping around him, and then when we got too suspicious would turn it off. Eventually an Admin said that Aimbot is actually allowed, and so he started to use it laissez faire.  Eventually, I got the ass and whipped out my aimbotting Wire device and re-worked it to target just him. Let me tell you, he needs a talking to about how he treats people on the internet. He was a complete and utter brat to everyone on the server. Constantly trying to tell people how they have no friends, basically just shit attempts at trolling.

But generally I leave him somewhat unattended around the computer, especially if he is not browsing, e.g. on Garry's mod. I have not played with him a whole lot personally, but I suspected he might be griefing, or trolling to some degree.   It sounds like he caused a fair amount of hysteria or trouble on your guys server. I am going to check the server history and try to see where he has been and also check the screenshots folder to try and see if I can collect any evidence.  If this was him, rest assured me and him will have a talk. Thank you for bringing this to my attention."

gmod,3bl0p8,Delta7x,2,Tue Jun 30 05:08:34 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, we've all been there!  Going a bit out of order here, but when adding something be sure to put the file in the correct folder. Typically when you unpack content, or download content from Facepunch (For example) it will be in specific folders and you want to follow that path when adding it to  your server.  So for example(I say example because sometimes files won't need to be put in the player folder), if I'm adding a new playermodel and the filepath goes:   models/player/delta7x/   Or   models/delta7x/   I'll want to add all the (Model) contents from the delta7x folder (.mdl,.phy,.sw.vtx,.vvd, .dx80.vtx and .dx90.vtx) to the player folder located inside the models folder. Clicking and dragging delta7x into the player folder should be enough. If a player folder doesn't exist inside the models folder feel free to make one.  Then you'll want to do the same for the texture files which are .vtf and .vtm files. These go into the materials folder and may also follow a specific path.    When adding content(Whether it be models, textures, or scripts) from your computer to your server you must websync for them to take effect, to do this you go to your control panel on NFO, and under the first set of options (Directly under Events Log) there should be a button called Websync, what you want to do is click Sync Files and then you're done.    Lastly after making sure all that is said and done you'll want to make it so your players download said content, for this you'll want to navigate to your lua/autorun folder and create a new .lua file, for simplicity sake let's just call it addfile.  Here is where you'll want to add files to your fastdl so that players joining are able to download the content you've added (Cause seeing untextured props/weapons or models, and error signs isn't fun).  To do this you can type it out manually for all the items involved in the model or content you're adding like so:  if (SERVER) then      resource.addfile("" models/player/delta7x/ "")      resource.addfile("" materials/player/delta7x/ "") end   For simplicity sake I just did the two but you'll want to include all parts of the model and textures. Since typing it out manually you might forget something (Or get tired of it fast) I'd recommend checking out Fox-Warriors Resources Generator, super helpful in creating for adding stuff to your fastdl. You might have to add in custom fields to include all parts of the model but that's not a huge issue and should take you less than five minutes."

Players should download the map the server is currently playing on automatically if they don't already have it, also no need to have the .lua file for the jihad downloaded to the client.  I notice with the .vmt and .vtf files associated with the jihad bomb that the materials/ is missing from the filepath.  If it still doesn't work after that double check your file paths, things might not be in the right folder or need to be in a specific named folder that comes with the addon.

gmod,3beb0d,CrazedGunman502,2,Tue Jun 30 02:56:00 2015 UTC,"There's no ""one size fits all"" recipe for success for any server. It's all about trial and error and refining what you have on a server, throwing things at the wall and expecting them to stick (Contrary to popular belief) does not work in making a server 'good' or 'successful'.  That being said, a few recommendations I'd make as a server owner/manager (Not suggesting for DarkRP, I don't really play or care for it):   Try your best to limit 'custom' content that adds to download times. There's a lot of pretty cool stuff out there, but be mindful of file sizes and what clients have to download. It shouldn't take longer than 5-10 minutes to join a server because of what you have to download, the lower the better. Don't add all the things expecting it to blend into something great or to work how you imagined it would. It's important to think ahead and to have some sort of idea about what impact adding something will have. Everything should have a purpose, adding something because 'Iunno, it looked cool and fun and I wanted to try it' is fine in singleplayer, but don't apply the same logic to your server. Try to have or get staff who KNOW what they're doing. Good staff who know the lay of the land and can handle their role are invaluable, seriously. Nothing kills a server faster than incompetent staff, or abusive staff. Test EVERYTHING before and after adding it to your server. You don't want to have broken content on your server, or something that will ruin peoples FPS. It's beyond unprofessional, and will scare people off from your server."

gmod,3b4oml,ComradeOj,18,Thu Jun 25 23:05:25 2015 UTC,"I'm a long time player (2007). Ever since the flood of streamers and Youtube personalities the game has changed for the worse in my opinion. The community has become inundated with little kids that drove the rest of the mature community away. Gmod used to once be a place for creativity to flourish in the forms of machinima, level design, contraption building, and gamemode creation. All of that dissolved over the years with steampipe, broken updates, and the introduction of different kinds of content distribution systems (toybox, workshop). This drove a lot of the older guys away and steampipe made hassle-free map creation impossible because the dev tools became broken.   I miss a lot of the old gamemodes, and although they still exist (stranded, spacebuild, fretta) it's not the same. It's a nuisance to play Gmod now and I only do it on occasion with my friends in a listen server that I host.  Yeah, the game has changed."

I knew exactly what mods I was going to launch the game with and I could choose the order I wanted to download them in. The game would just launch without spending 5 minutes checking to see if I had all my subscribed addons installed along with that frozen-screen, repeating-audio glitch. Plus there was no waiting for Steam's slow as fuck web pages to load. Best of all, when I deleted an addon, it was gone forever. Not there haunting me whenever I played in offline mode.  Now I have to wade through thousands of dank memes to find anything worth downloading. When I do find something good, I have to hope the game decides whether or not I actually subscribed to it. That's if it's not downloading the other addons I subscribed to, which apparently didn't download through the Steam client. If I want a mod deleted, I have to fucking guess which file in my addons folder is the one I want to delete.  /rant"

I think a lot of it is because the oldies arn't leaving behind a lot for others to learn form.  Long-dead projects never to see the light of day again, including many gamemodes, Dupes and Wiremod contraptions.  The competition side of the game made everyone hush-hush about how to do X, Y and Z so there wasn't a lot of improvement on previous creations. I.E. Compliance with Gmod13 Lua syntax see: Why your scripts are now broken.  I will repeat, how every single E2 is comprised of a single, .txt that your grandma's toaster could open and they're the least shared of all.

Simply put, not everyone has the innate knowledge of 3D manipulation and the source engine to create their own vehicles, much like a lot of people don't even know where to start making the same complex devices others have.  Sometimes it's only about fun.  Without answering a question with a question, the reasons are three fold:    To have fun driving/piloting the creation. To tweak and see how important each part is. To learn how it was made.   You could also throw in ""how to make my own creations more efficient/Use my own knowledte to make this more efficient"".  I could ask back Why don't you want to share, when there is so much entertainment and learning others can benefit?  Going with a referrence to K4melot/Scion, I've already asked this with nothing more than ""I don't have to"". It's fucking irriating when you want to improve, there are no sources or examples to learn from, let alone the fact that the Wiremod wiki is locked down.   Actually learning IK would be the only problem here for me.   Well, part of it honestly. But yes, a major bump-in-the-road for those wanting to make Mech's and anything using IK.   I won't ask shadowscion how is he doing this or to give me code because there's no point of this.   Yea, he's odd, He said he went to university for maths and then later said ""anyone can do it"" (sorry but he's cleared the comments on the tachikoma video so I don't have evidence of this), I call bullshit, and why it's like blood from a stone or hens-teeth to find a mech to learn from.   I can ask him later in the development for some tricks and tips, and maybe a little help.   He said he has given out some help, but his history on wiremod.com shows, this isn't the case. But if you can assist at least myself the kind of tips he's already given?"

Created a mortar fire system aimed by a laser pointer and with a camera attached to the projectile so you can see it flying on the screen for better aiming.  That one time we created a simple deathmatch-like game using two custom-made vehicles with damage measurement and counting of frags. Shot each other and stuff. Later repeated it with aircraft.  Wiremod is lots of fun. Although our difficulty was that there were just two of us playing so building a tank, for example, that requires two people to control (drive and shoot) left us without opponents to shoot at."

I also built a little hovering robot that followed me around the map - it was especially useful when I was underwater, because I could just toss a Life Support cache inside it and it'd carry tons of air for me. I put all the circuits on a single board so that my friends could dupe just the board itself and easily attach it to their own robot designs. Later on I modified the circuits so that our robots would hunt down each other and shoot at each other, while a scoreboard (another Wiremod creation of mine) would keep track of who got hit the most.   Speaking of Life Support, I've also built fully automated powerplants that generated enough essential resources to keep my vehicles fueled. They would also automatically shut themselves down when the caches were full because the engine noises annoyed me."

Sort of doing a review as I go along:   Right off the bat, a custom Icon and everything packaged into the .BSP/.GMA, well done! maby a different texture should be chosen for the top/edges of the railings, makes them easier to see exactly where the edge is. There are some issues with the ladder ending in front of a hill, unable to hop-off. Just a couple of visual things, you have your moving clouds bisect your 3D skybox and the stairs that lead under the bridge can be smoothed off on the uderside. You played a contruct_flatgrass on the building, oh well. The pool is an interresting feature, so is the hill-top bench, unfortunatly seats within hammer are non-existant at this time. A little pond would be nice, I know there's a bunch of fish you can use too, ask /r/hammer or /r/SourceEngine I'll see if I can find a source. Edit2: You can use Func_fish_pool, set model to goldfish.mdl, thanks to /u/olithraz at /r/hammer. A tower to over-view the map is nice, but a safe-way down would be nice, infact using teleporters might be a much better solution. A random house with no-doors but it has a sky-light, nice? But I see some texture issues with the skylight, especially where you have the skylight-brush being at least a few units above where the roof meets.   A lot of minor things that can be easily fixed.  I'd give it a 7/10, purely for effort, there are some nice idea's but being one of your earlier maps somewhat shows, but what a good show it is.  Edit: One last thing, your windmills, whilst amazing and I wish I knew how you made them, Spacebuild has a set of windmills (used for wind-energy generation) that might have played a much prettier part?"

You might possibly get some severe framerate drops if there is too much stuff to be rendered/processed at once, especially with an APU.  As for graphics settings, you could easily run it minimum settings, and maybe higher depending on your resolution. Gmod is very inconsistent when it comes to framerate (from my experience at least). Don't be afraid to tinker with the settings until you get them just right.  One more thing: I'm guessing that since you're asking if you can run it, you haven't bought it yet. If you do buy it, make sure you have source games installed, as Gmod is a MOD, and uses content from other games.

Think of the other games as addons. Your game is definitely usable still and you can get by without CS:S.  With that said, a LOT of gamemodes rely on CS:S. Many maps have CS:S materials (and if you're missing these materials, you get that pink and black checkerboard). DarkRP, Trouble in Terrorist Town, and Prop Hunt are all big gamemodes that I know use CS:S resources."

Even if it lags, turn your settings up while taking the shot. It makes it look better in general. Higher resolution. I'm assuming you took this on a laptop with a weird res, but don't despair, you can actually get a bigger resolution than your screen uses for taking pictures. Use super DOF. Use it until you overuse it, then use it more, then dial it back a little bit. Super DOF is absolutely essential for getting shots to look good. It can also solve some problems of aliasing and resolution, and make things a little smoother in the back/foreground.    Other than that, this is an awesome shot! Keep going, make more please."

Then I grab an old ass wooden AKM and a knife and get to work.  It's always a delight when a friend can get a server running, because holy shit it gets good. I make the campaign, he runs it. Say I make a shadowy contact character that hires the PC to do hits. I'll call him on Steam, act out the character, and see how it turns out.  Yes, I've tried tabletop games. No, I don't have anyone to play with.

You could also learn to build contraptions like flying bathtubs or something. Or, you could make adventure maps, which is basically when you pimp out the map with a bunch of hostile NPCs, props and stuff. Tons of stuff to do, you just gotta look into it."

That just extends load times because the game tries to mount the add-on properly, but can't mount duplications.  uninstall addons you don't use.  if the game is acting weird, like you cant start a new game, verify the integrity of the game cache."

gmod,38v10h,icanhasreclaims,5,Sun Jun 7 01:47:26 2015 UTC,Gmod is one of those games where you can do whatever. Want to build something cool? Go ahead. Want to get some addons and play around with them? Or you can join servers for popular game modes like TTT darkrp. But back to the addons. See on the workshop you can download anything. Say you want better building tools or systems (like smartsnap or wiremod) or say you want some more guns to shoot stuff with (fas:2 or cw: 2.0 guns) or some cool cars to drive around (scars or LWLCars) possibilities are endless. You can even download adventure maps on the workshop or other places to explore and build. Sorry if there was any mistakes typing on phone
gmod,38v10h,flugson,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:20:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  Definitely headed in the right direction, gonna watch some more vids of some things you mentioned."
gmod,38v10h,xaviergmail,3,Sun Jun 7 21:56:03 2015 UTC,"There are multiple game types, created by users just like you. You can learn Lua and make your own gamemode (or addon), browse the workshop to install other people's addons for your singleplayer experience, or you can join pre-made servers to meet new players and discover new gamemodes. Some of the more 'mainstream' gamemodes are: DarkRP, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, Prop Hunt, Hide and Seek, etc. DarkRP and Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT) can be quite complicated at first so I suggest you read up on them before joining a server. There's also GMod Tower, which is a collection of mini gamemodes, such as minigolf and a mariokart clone, as well as many others like apartment decoration, etc. Garry's Mod is, in my opinion, the best bang for your buck when it comes to a game, especially if you get into addon creation."

gmod,37qsqk,CensoredSloth,4,Fri May 29 17:30:53 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the community!  One of the things that makes GMod special is that it takes models, textures, maps, etc from other games. Specifically, it takes the assets from other games based on the Source engine (aka, pretty much any/all games by Valve).   The problem is, if you don't actually have these other games installed, then GMod has nothing to reference and has to throw up an error instead.   So long story short, whatever server you're on is using assets from another video game, like say CounterStrike:Source, and since you don't have that game installed your computer can't render the asset.   Most servers will put in their description somewhere which games they expect you to have in order to play.   If you need any more help or need a clearer explanation please don't hesitate to ask."

But you'll also often see assets from TF2, Portal, Left 4 Dead, etc. etc.   In the end though you'll always run the risk of missing something - that's just kind of a normal part of Gmod so try not to sweat it unless it makes the map/server unplayable for you."
gmod,37oywp,smokeygun,4,Fri May 29 06:53:36 2015 UTC,"I play on the combine control servers a lot of the time, mostly because I know a lot of people that play on there. If I had to guess, I've dedicated around 50+ hours on theirs servers. What I can say about it is the following:   The player-base and admins are kinda scummy. However, I personally don't mind it to an extent. I can see how it turns some people off, though. The gameplay is kinda dull, with only the really cool stuff happening with the admin's consent. You might get some good RP when you're a rebel, or you can take a shot at CP. The admins are good at their job, but like I said above, they're kinda rude. I've never been in an admin situation, but if someone is breaking the rules, they'll be dealt with pretty quickly. Don't hop into the gamemode expecting to get tons of money or cool gear and scripts. The gamemode isn't dependent on these things, and you can still RP when you have nothing. Lastly, the server has tons of custom content, meaning it will take a while to download when you first join. This will also cause performance issues depending on what your computer specs are. (I usually get 20-40 FPS with a FX-6300, HD7770, and 8 GBs of RAM.)   TL;DR, it's 50/50 imo.

It's quite easy to get the hang of (all you need to do is know how to use the focus distance and blur sliders).  If you wanna go the extra mile, I recommend using the 'render' function, which will give it a more cinematic blur. Another always is color modification.  In this case you'd want to go for a bright yellowish tone. Depending on the scene, you may also want to use bloom.  It won't always look good, so you just have to try it out."

Source engine does it by location, as in CSGO if you are in 'mid', the reflection on, for example, the scope of a sniper will reflect a cubemap of Mid, until you move to the next area that has a bitmap. You have reached a cubemap that is in that area, and it looks like it matches the surroundings, but games like Open world games (gta 5/watch_dogs) I think they render a second 'map' that is low poly with textures instead of details and than reflecting (that's why it moves with you).   Anyways, If you want a high quality pic, turn on AA and all settings plus use the DoF tool and it will looks amazing.  TL;DR: It's the reflection that makes it 'realistic', but in Source engine it uses bitmaps, not real time reflections. (BTW, I think it's called bitmaps*, maybe it has another name).

There might still be a server up for it. If you find a group of people that will be able to keep a server full at most times then the gamemode has a chance to come back. If you do find a community that would update the gamemode and keep it populated I could ask the guy who made the gamemode to help him out.

I see fellow staff members not responding to calls for help and breaking server rules, even the managements won't lift a finger on this matter when I report them. But when they report me, the managements would just straight away give me a ""strike"" without a chance to defend myself.  Server died later.
