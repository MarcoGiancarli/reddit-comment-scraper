Wicca,3e42tx,augustoluna,3,Tue Jul 21 20:15:05 2015 UTC,Italian being ancient Roman? The Aradian cult? Something older? Newer?
Wicca,3e42tx,TheBonyMan,2,Tue Jul 21 20:24:42 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I should have specified! I want to learn more about both ancient Roman and the Aradian cult, so I'm looking for information on both,"
Wicca,3e42tx,Rvb321,2,Tue Jul 21 20:35:25 2015 UTC,"For roman deities, I suggest Bulfinch's Mythology. It's  in 3 parts, each covering a different era of mythology,  but the first part focuses heavily on the Greco-Roman myths and deities. As for Aradia, if you haven't yet, go read Aradia or The Gospel of The Witches by Charles Leland. It's more directly involved with the history of Wicca, as it heavily influenced early Wicca. Just compare The Charge of The Goddess with Aradia's speech in the first chapter. You can find both of these texts at Sacred-texts.com"
Wicca,3e42tx,mtvisdead,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:11:33 2015 UTC,"Charles Leland's book Etruscan Roman Remains is literally filled with hundreds of spirits and deities, and Aradia: Gospel of the Witches is a sample of whats in Remains"
Wicca,3e1hba,Stormy_lover,4,Tue Jul 21 05:56:22 2015 UTC,"Oh I love flowering teas! Back when I had a glass tea pot I would get them all the time! Not particularly witchy, but very cool!"
Wicca,3e1hba,Elle_se_sent_seul,3,Tue Jul 21 07:38:29 2015 UTC,"A coworker gave me a set of blooming teas as a gift once.  They were really pretty, but the tea wasn't all that good to be honest.  >_>"
Wicca,3e1hba,Cranifraz,4,Tue Jul 21 15:42:15 2015 UTC,Flowering teas will always have a weaker flavor because they're mostly flowers and not much tea leaf or herbal tea ingredient. I learned a lot working in a tea shop for a year; it's really fascinating stuff that I really could go on and on and on about.
Wicca,3e1hba,KingofSuicides,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:00:31 2015 UTC,That makes sense. It struck me as marketed towards people who don't really know a lot about tea as the perfect gift for the tea lover.
Wicca,3e1hba,Cranifraz,2,Tue Jul 21 19:14:55 2015 UTC,"It is a great gift and wonderful for ambiance, for impressing company, et cetera."
Wicca,3e1hba,KingofSuicides,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:42:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for the heads up! I ordered a few pods and wasn't sure what to expect as far as quality of the tea.
Wicca,3e1hba,Vaidurya,2,Tue Jul 21 16:46:26 2015 UTC,"Some bulk foods stores carry them, along with specialty shops and frou frou grocers.

Only other one is /r/muglife, which I haven't been to. Are you looking for a particular pot? I have a small collection of kettles (and, thanks to my hubby, broken kettles) so I have a good handle on prices. I.E, there are a few decent sets available at retailers such as Ross, TJ Maxx, and Steinmart, plus Tuesday Morning recently had blooming kettles for $13 (I bet somewhere online you can find them for that price), and thrift stores/goodwill are phenomenal when it comes to finding tea gear. I got my electric kettle and three of my pots there. There are also lots of etsy shops selling antique teaware and... well, the internet's a big place, but Reddit doesnâ€™t yet have that niche filled. I think it'd be fair to plaster /r/teatography with a few of your favorite pots, for safe keeping..."
Wicca,3e1hba,vynvicious,2,Wed Jul 22 01:01:45 2015 UTC,"I just like looking at teapots :) I have one that serves me well, but teapots are something I enjoy looking at and collecting.

Wicca,3dzqyb,vynvicious,10,Mon Jul 20 21:10:45 2015 UTC,"Sadly, there is no definitive answer. It all boils down to what you're both comfortable with and able to do.   For example, I have neither the no-how nor the materials to make a knife, so I bought my athame. However, I could make an altar cloth, so I made one.   Some people don't like buying items from thrift shops because they feel like the energy from the previous owner tainted it, so they only buy new things (which somehow an item mass-produced in a sweatshop by people making 5 cents an hour manages to be untainted, but that's a different rant). Other people find whatever they can in nature and use those items. Others only use items that they know were hand-crafted by locals. Still others don't use any items, feeling that what they see as an obsession with stuff interferes with the actual working of magic and ritual.   It all boils down to what you feel is right, just think about what you're using and the reason behind it."
Wicca,3dzqyb,Diredoe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:22:46 2015 UTC,"I've heard horror stories of people who've bought thrifted items only for residual energies to muck up rituals and other spellwork. I'm personally a fan of using what I can find whenever I can find it, whether it's a discarded feather I find on a walk in my neighborhood or what have you. I live in a subruban area with not too many metaphysical shops, and most of the surrounding area's selection just feels wrong. Whether its the owner's personality or just the price of the items, if I don't feel comfortable there, I dont stay. I also don't like feeling too bogged down with physical items, so I try to use things that are multi purpose."
Wicca,3dzqyb,zachv2,6,Tue Jul 21 20:23:41 2015 UTC,Just do what ever feels best.

Wicca,3dzqyb,greybeard45,6,Tue Jul 21 20:24:04 2015 UTC,"What I have always believed is that the power is in the Wiccan and that any physical items we use are just to help us focus our personal energy. My altar is an old side table that was a hand me down from my parents when I got my first apartment. I'm pretty sure they got it from a garage sale. It has passed through many hands but because I have put so much love and care into it, other people's ""energies"" do not interfere with my practice.  I have a personal consecration ritual I perform on any new tool I purchase, inherit, or make. This way it doesn't matter whose hands the item has passed through or what energies they previously held. Once they are mine they are mine."
Wicca,3dzqyb,whipped_honey,2,Mon Jul 20 22:34:42 2015 UTC,"My current ""altar cloth"" is actually a scap of fabric that I cut from a discarded pair of my mom's pajama pants. The leg of the pants butterflied and laid flat was the perfect size for the vanity table I occasionally use for an altar when I feel the need for one. I feel a connection to my Goddess through my mom, and made sure none of her energies were attached to it before I started using it."
Wicca,3dzqyb,McSloshed,4,Tue Jul 21 21:53:04 2015 UTC,"I can understand your confusion.  A purchased tool is fine if you are not good at making something.  Most Wiccans are not skilled at the blacksmith's art, nor do they have the forge and shop to fabricate an athame, for example. So you purchase a double edged knife from a knife maker.  It does as well to ""make it your own"" by adding some decoration(s) on the tool.  My athame is a nice looking knife I bought at a knife shop in a mall.  I added a lapis lazuli cabochon to the handle.  I've used it a long time. Likewise there are often craftsmen selling Wiccan tools at pagan events, and their items are good too.  Used things from thrift stores and yard sales are also good.    One important restriction is not to haggle over the price of a magical tools so that the seller holds a grudge against you who bought it too cheap.  The tool must be willingly sold.  Pay the asking price or walk away."
Wicca,3dzqyb,whipped_honey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:01:26 2015 UTC,"I've heard something about not haggling for it before, but chalked it up to old superstition since I'd heard something about that in an old fairy story. But I see now how it may affect the energies once you use it after basically politely fighting over it!"
Wicca,3dzqyb,whipped_honey,4,Tue Jul 21 20:50:17 2015 UTC,"There is no requirement to create your own tools in any of the early Wiccan writings that I know of, however there were specific embellishments that you were supposed to do yourself, for example inscribing particular symbols on the Athame handle. To the best of my knowledge neither Gerald Gardner nor Alex Sanders were blacksmiths, and I am fairly sure they purchased most of their ritual tools. BUT they did have it custom made, which is a little different from off-the-shelf. Nevertheless, there is no prohibition against using purchased tools in BTW Wicca.   I see nothing wrong whatsoever with purchasing every single thing that is on your altar. I do, however, think you will have a stronger connection to something that you make yourself. Try it yourself, figure out one item that you will make one, and purchase one. See which one you end up using more often."
Wicca,3dzqyb,whipped_honey,2,Mon Jul 20 23:09:57 2015 UTC,"Can confirm: bought a bunch of stuff, made other stuff. The stuff I made, I have an instant connection to, whereas things I bought take time to really soak up power and connection. Consecrate anything you're going to put on your altar."
Wicca,3dzqyb,Oklahom0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:41:04 2015 UTC,"I see people saying consecration all the time, and I do know what it means, but wouldn't the intent to use it for any sort of working be consecration enough? (Please don't shoot me, I'm only curious.) I mentioned in another comment that my favorite tool to use is a fire-safe ceramic bowl that I made in high school, it's perfect for burning loose incense powder in without those charcoal disks every beginner's Wiccan book tends to laud. (They freak me out, actually. I'd much rather use something a little more contained than sprinkling powder on a burning disk of death.)"
Wicca,3dzqyb,AndromedaBurst,2,Tue Jul 21 20:48:32 2015 UTC,"If you are extra traditional, you would pass the item over the 4 (or 5) elements and consecrate the item in the name of each element then place it on the altar pentacle. Less traditional could be just holding over the flame, or just placing it on the altar before use. Least traditional would be just holding it and filling it with your pure white (or other color if appropriate) energy."

Wicca,3dzqyb,AllanfromWales,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:21:59 2015 UTC,"One exchange in particular sticks out to me: in my early days of learning Wicca 101, for lack of a better description, a fellow solitary practitioner told me rather loudly that you're not supposed to put anything on your altar that's handmade on it, because it draws your energies away from any work you do on that altar. Even just starting out, that always sounded sort of backward to me. Remembering that and seeing the question about altars sparked the question.   I've never heard of specific symbols to inscribe on an athame before, I'll have to look into that for context. Thank you for your opinion! I'll definitely keep your advice in mind."
Wicca,3dzqyb,whipped_honey,2,Tue Jul 21 20:44:01 2015 UTC,"Honest question, did this person make money selling altar supplies. I have never heard this before. I have heard some similar in ceremonial magic, where perfection is desired, and the closer to perfection the better, so a machine made thing might be closer to perfect, but that is not Wicca."
Wicca,3dzqyb,whipped_honey,2,Tue Jul 21 21:08:45 2015 UTC,"Seeing as she and I were both in high school at the time, I seriously doubt it. I'm sure there are people out there who try to get others away from things they disagree with, I've seen it in every religion I've personally come across. As an example, when I was a trainee in the USAF, our weekly Wiccan service had a coven elder come once in to discuss traditions of the craft with us, only to completely destroy the notion that solitary witches of any gender were legitimate. He swore that coven practice was the only true practice- to a room full of people who were either solitaries themselves, or new to the idea of Wicca in general. (Sorry for going off on a tangent, but your question reminded me of that. )"
Wicca,3dvlby,Stormy_lover,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:07:14 2015 UTC,"/u/AllanfromWales, thank you for giving me tips to help get this started. When is it ideal to begin harvesting the plant for use?"
Wicca,3dvlby,AllanfromWales,2,Sun Jul 19 22:08:25 2015 UTC,"There are, of course, two separate harvests. One is for 'use', the other is the seeds to plant next year. All parts of the plant contain scopolamine, atropine, and hyoscyamine, so harvesting for use in potions and ointments can be done at any time. Probably the highest concentration is in the seeds, but you are unlikely to get sufficient (given how small each seed is) to rely on that. The practical best option is dried leaves of the plant, either smoked (which I've never tried because I'm a non-smoker) or as an alcohol extract. I have also used an acid extract, simmering with lemon juice then mixing with goose fat, when making flying ointments. BE VERY CAREFUL. Scopolamine and hyoscamine are deliriants, and their effects can be disastrous, even deadly, if overindulged: https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=72632 , particularly the last para or two. As to collecting the seed, it takes time. Fairly quickly the flower forms a seed capsule, like a little pot with a lid on it. I leave it on the plant until it has aged enough that the lid becomes loose and can be easily removed. This takes several months. At that stage you just empty the seeds out the pot, and you are ready to start again next year."

Wicca,3dwbtb,NovaTheKitsune,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:08:20 2015 UTC,I second this. Its all about the energy YOUR ENERGY!
Wicca,3dwbtb,SleepingLion9873,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:26:46 2015 UTC,"I think you could use nails and the like.  If you think about it, all things are made of atoms, and metal is made out of atoms, and atoms are natural.  So if the problem is that metal is unnatural, then just think of that."
Wicca,3dwbtb,ChalupaInducedStroke,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:27:52 2015 UTC,"The thing about alters is, like most things in Wicca, it is very personal. Many Wiccans use pre-constructed tables or even bookcases as their alter set up. There are shops that sell hand carved altars online if you'd like to go that route. If you're wanting be to build your own altar you could use wood glue in lieu of metal connectors and just vice the pieces together while it dries. Wood glue is the strongest bond between two pieces of wood. The only reason people use nails or screws in conjunction to it is to make sure the wooden joints dry firmly pressed together. You could also carve an altar out of a single piece of wood but that would take some serious time and skill.  Ultimately, it's the personal energy that you put into an altar that counts, not what it's made of or what's on it. Go with what feels right, not necessarily what others tell you to do."
Wicca,3dwbtb,indigosnowflake,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:44:18 2015 UTC,I've seen every kind of table from flat stones to sawn section of a tree.  My own view is that the table you work on does not matter.  It is a convenient place to hold your tools and nothing more.  What matters is the Magic working going on above and around the altar.    Note: If you intend to do a great rite on your altar it needs to be large and strong or it will fall over and collapse.  Just saying.
Wicca,3dwbtb,greybeard45,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:57:10 2015 UTC,Ignore the no metal thing. It's a superstition
Wicca,3dwbtb,mtvisdead,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:10:26 2015 UTC,"I don't worry too much about metals in the altar construction myself (I'm a metallurgist, why would I?) but my understanding of the superstition is that the fairies and some other denizens of the spirit realm are afraid of, particularly, iron. That's why iron tools like the athame are used for controlling spirits, while wooden tools like the wand are used for treating with the spirits. But this is iron only - it does not apply to other metals. So if you want to use metal in the construction of your altar and are worried about frightening away spirits, use brass or bronze fixings, or, if you are rich and flashy, silver."
Wicca,3dwbtb,AllanfromWales,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:14:58 2015 UTC,"Actually, the most specific statement as to why to avoid metals is because metal is a conductor of energy and the metals within the altar table would conduct some/all of the energy away.   Of course, that only seems to be for electromagnetic energy, so who knows how much of that would hold true for whatever kind of energy it is that we're using and manipulating."
Wicca,3dwbtb,karmachallenged,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:45:10 2015 UTC,"Many people use a wand to direct/conduct energy, and that's traditionally wood. Basically, use whatever you want."

Wicca,3ducji,lilystarfire,4,Sun Jul 19 18:09:35 2015 UTC,"I second this. I always recommend Scott Cunningham, love his works.  I would also recommend reading a lot in general. Every author has their own interpretation of the craft. Taking time to read a lot of different books will help you find your path in Wicca.   Some of my favorites include:  Earth Air Fire and Water by Scott Cunningham (really, everything by him is wonderful) The Wicca Handbook by Eileen Holland Embracing the Moon by Yasmine Galenorn Animal Speak by Ted Andrews (though this is more about shamanism and finding your spirit animal)  :)"

Wicca,3ducji,midwintermoons,4,Mon Jul 20 14:09:19 2015 UTC,"Welcome! The best advice I can give you is to jump right in with meditation, prayer, and simple visualization exercises, but to hold off on spells and more elaborate rituals until you've found your footing. Read as much as you can (even things you disagree with), practice as much as you can (even if you don't always get it right), and above all, take your time. The journey of the soul is a very, very long one, so long that it takes many lifetimes. Have patience with yourself, keep an open heart, and the rest will come.  Here are some book suggestions to get you started, in an order that I think would be beneficial to read them. This is just off the top of my head and not meant to be some kind of comprehensive curriculum, so take it as you will.  Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner, Scott Cunningham Paganism: An Introduction to Earth-Centered Religions, Joyce and River Higginbotham Living Wicca: A Further Guide for the Solitary Practitioner, Cunningham The Spiral Dance, Starhawk Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft, Raymond Buckland The Circle Within, Dianne Sylvan A Witches' Bible, Janet and Stewart Farrar Drawing Down the Moon, Margot Adler    Here are some websites to take a look at:  http://wicca.cnbeyer.com/ http://paganwiccan.about.com/ http://www.sacred-texts.com/ http://www.religioustolerance.org/witchcra.htm    Also check out witchvox.com, meetup.com, and your local Covenant of Unitarian Universalist Pagans (CUUPS) if and when you are interested in meeting other Wiccans.  Have fun and Blessed Be!"
Wicca,3ducji,AurinkoJaKuu,2,Sun Jul 19 18:50:26 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned, Scott Cunningham's Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner and Raymond Buckland's Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft, are pretty good places to start. The latter is laid out like a lesson, and does a great job at teaching the material. I'd also suggest you read Margot Adler's Drawing Down the Moon for a look at witchcraft's history and various traditions.  All that said, learn everything you can and don't be afraid to pick and choose what you like from different sources. Wicca is a very fluid religion. And above all else, have fun with it!"
Wicca,3ducji,Rvb321,2,Mon Jul 20 01:18:49 2015 UTC,Wow I thank you all for the support and and everything else you've provided.  Its actually very helpful from all of you.  I did happen to buy the Wicca for beginners by Thea Sabin.   I also bought the crystal Bible.  I've checked out a few of the websites including the ebook site.  You have all been extremely helpful.
Wicca,3ducji,Rvb321,2,Mon Jul 20 14:05:56 2015 UTC,"Ok, let's slow down for  a  moment, because discovering a new path, like this, can be overwhelming.  Let's stert with the basics: how much do you know about  Wicca so far?"
Wicca,3ducji,Stormy_lover,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:50:16 2015 UTC,I know about crystal work and the energies locked within... not textbook but I started put with a piece of selenite to help unlock the subconcoius and help with confusion.  I'm very interested in crystal work.  I know about the Pentagram and it's relation to the five energies and a few other basic things.
Wicca,3ducji,Rvb321,5,Sun Jul 19 16:04:13 2015 UTC,"I know about crystal work and the energies locked within... not textbook but I started put with a piece of selenite to help unlock the subconcoius and help with confusion.  I'm very interested in crystal work.   I wish i could give you respurces on this, but I know very little about crystals. Personally, I find that much of the information put there claims all sorts of woo like ""rocks can cure cancer"" as opposed to being informative about their ritual uses. The best advice I can give, and this applies to Wicca in general, have a good bullshit meter. Don't believe everything you read.   know about the Pentagram and it's relation to the five energies and a few other basic things.    Fornthe sake of clarity and consistency in nomenclature, the point of the pentagram are referred to as being representative of The Elements, as oposed to energies.  Continuing on, I recommend you start small by reading our FAQ and Wiki, linked in the sidebar. If you want book recommendations, Wicca for Beginners by Thea Sabin, Wicca A Guide for The Solitary Practitioner by Scott Cunningham, and The Witches' Bible by Janet and Stewart Farrar are good places to begin. If you don't have any book stores in your area that carry these books, or if Amazon shipping is taking too long, I highly recommend the Howcast series about Wicca, hosted by Phyllis Curott. It's  pretty easy to find on youtube, but search Howcast Wicca and it should give you a full playlist of the series.  Edit: also, learn about the God and Goddess, they're, arguably one of the most important aspects of Wicca. I posted an explanation of Wiccan theology awhile back that you might find useful. Let me know if you're  interested, and I can go dig it up."
Wicca,3ducji,augustoluna,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:41:20 2015 UTC,I'm interested in reading your theology.
Wicca,3ducji,DennisJM,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:08:39 2015 UTC,"This came from a discussion with a Hindu that I had on /r/pagan awhile back.   Wiccan theology, at its most basic, reveres a moon goddess which is commonly understood as being a trinity of Maiden, Mother, and Crone. They each represent a different phase of the moon and a different phase of a woman's life (though, for example, men or people incapable of reproduction can still find symbolism in The Godess' Mother aspect, in various creative endeavors. So the symbolism isn't 100% literal.) She has Holidays every full moon called Esbats. Then, there's The God.  The God is typically seen as The Horned God, represented by the sun. He is the consort of The Goddess. He is sometimes seen as a duality. These dual aspects are commonly referred to as The Holly King and Oak King, who rule in opposite halves of the year. I prefer the titles more along the lines of The Sun God, who rules the light half of the year (Spring and Summer), and the Dark God, who rules the dark half of the year (Fall and Winter). I prefer these titles over Holly and Oak Kings because those trees don't really grow where I live. The God has 8 holidays throughout the year called Sabbats. The Sabbats are sometimes depicted on a circular Calendar called The Wheel of The Year. The Wheel of The Year has a whole, cyclical, story to go along with each of the 8 holidays. As a side note, Samhain, known colloquially as Halloween, is considered the Wiccan new year.   Also, for clarity, the descriptions I gave of Wiccan views of divinity are more traditional views of the God and Goddess. They're seen as being two halves of an impersonal, pantheistic diety that goes by different names depending on who you ask: The All, The One, Dryghten, Spirit, etc. Some Wiccans, depending on their tradition, will then work with other deities from different pantheons, , sometimes viewing them as being aspects of, or interpretations of, The God and Goddess. Personally, I dont feel comfortable doing that, since some people see it as cultural appropriation. I'm ok with the concept, so long as it's done respectfully, but I myself just stick with more traditional conceptions of Wiccan divinity. I sometimes see this soft polytheism, as it is called, compared to Hindu views of divinity. Would you say that's accurate or do things work differently?"
Wicca,3ducji,greybeard45,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:43:05 2015 UTC,"I'm at the same point as you, and I am using Silver RavenWolf's ""To Ride a Silver Broomstick"" as a straightforward starting point."
Wicca,3ducji,mtvisdead,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:24:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm sure you're right about Wicca helping you attain spiritual purity and focus. The main purpose of any religion/spirituality is to help you attain your connection with God/dess.  Once you have that everything else falls into place relatively easily. Here is a link to help you find divine guidance: http://spells-witchcraft.org/guidance.htm You may also find the site useful in general as it was created to help someone like you get started.  Yes, Wicca is sometimes difficult for a person to find a beginning. The problem is that since we have no dogma there is really nothing to learn.  Wicca is meant to be experienced not studied, although the experience is greatly enhanced by your own research."
Wicca,3ducji,midwintermoons,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:46:20 2015 UTC,"We have found that most who come first find Wicca are asking more about the meaning and core of Wicca, and not so much about a ""how to"" of Wicca.   We often recommend this book: The Heart of Wicca: Wise Words from a Crone on the Path by Ellen Cannon Reed.  Before her death Ms. Reed described how Wicca had affected her life and given her the peace she sought.  She also talks about some of the ""how to"" that she taught in decades as a Priestess.    Another book along this same line is Wicca: The Old Religion In the New Millennium Millennium by Vivianne Crowley.   These books talk about why one might choose Wicca as his or her path in additon to information on how to practice our religion."
Wicca,3ducji,mtvisdead,-2,Mon Jul 20 02:42:50 2015 UTC,"I recommend Scott Cunningham as well, his book ""A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner"" is good. But I'd very very strongly recommend A Witches' Bible by Janet and Stewart Farrar. A Witches Bible is how Wicca started out, many of the other books, including Scott Cunningham's, are kind of watered down new age books about the religion, and don't reflect its original nature very well. If A Witches Bible is very unappealing to you and Wicca by Scott Cunningham is, you might be more drawn to Paganism rather than Witchcraft."
Wicca,3ducji,Rvb321,4,Sun Jul 19 18:54:09 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but Wicca has changed over the last few decades, and it's going to continue to change. What Cunningham describes is not any less Wicca than what the Farrars describe, and I don't believe anybody gets any brownie points for doggedly sticking to Traditional Wicca. I recommend that people start out with Cunningham and the newer, more generalized books simply because they give gentle, basic overviews, and then work their way back to things like the Farrars because they are not as approachable and at this point are describing a very specific tradition that is not the way a lot of folks practice now. Once they have the whole picture they can decide on what path they want to take. Of course, it also makes sense to start at the beginning chronologically and work your way forward, but I find that the backwards approach is a bit easier."
Wicca,3ducji,mtvisdead,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:17:03 2015 UTC,"And I never said Cunningham's Wicca was less Wicca than British traditional. It has its rightful place in the religious movement. But you can't negate the fact that as Wicca spread through the US in the 70s and 80s, the darker stuff got picked out. This is a natural change, but the hard-core stuff deserves its place among practitioners just as much as the flower crowns and smiley faces. This is not doggedly sticking to tradition; the tradition is just right for me. And americanized practice is exactly the same."
Wicca,3ducji,Rvb321,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:04:31 2015 UTC,"But you can't negate the fact that as Wicca spread through the US in the 70s and 80s, the darker stuff got picked out.    To simply throw in a hypothesis as to why this is, this brand of Wicca was very much an American phenomenon. There was a severe lack of traditional covens, for all of the people interested, so they learned, mostly, from books. Books which had much of the more ""hardcore"" information left out, because  it was oathbound."
Wicca,3ducji,midwintermoons,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:22:14 2015 UTC,We don't need easily palatable pop-wicca books to draw young people in so we can reveal the less-palatable stuff later. We don't need advertising. People who wish to find balance between light and dark will be drawn to the Craft on their own.
Wicca,3ducji,mtvisdead,2,Mon Jul 20 03:59:36 2015 UTC,"We don't need easily palatable pop-wicca books to draw young people in so we can reveal the less-palatable stuff later. We don't need advertising. People who wish to find balance between light and dark will be drawn to the Craft on their own.   I agree, in the sense that many of the pop-wicca books out there are really shitty and full of misinformation and that we don't need to advertise or proselytize. However, you can't just throw someone into something and drown them in information.  You don't get into Heavy Metal by listening to Darkthrone, you start with something more palatable, like Metallica and work your way up. You don't start off playing a trumpet by learning double tounging, you start by learning scales. You don't start learning math by trying calculus, you start with addition and subtraction. We have to ease people into the religion and it's many facets and complexities. However, it has to start with a good foundation of basic information. Unfortunately, many of the pop-wicca books out there, simoly don't provide that."
Wicca,3ducji,Rvb321,2,Mon Jul 20 15:17:29 2015 UTC,THANK YOU that's all I was trying to say but apparently that's crazy or something
Wicca,3ducji,mtvisdead,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:12:27 2015 UTC,"I do appreciate Cunningham's books as a nice foundation, but I think progressing from light to dark slowly is misleading, I think light and dark should be presented alongside each other so the student can grasp what works and what doesn't. I just wish when I was first learning that I had learnt this way."
Wicca,3ducji,Rvb321,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:17:59 2015 UTC,"I just wish when I was first learning that I had learnt this way.   Out of curiosity, why? I learned about wicca in a Gradual ""light to dark"" way, as you  put it, and I have no problem with it."
Wicca,3ducji,mtvisdead,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:23:52 2015 UTC,"Because for the beginning of my path I thought it was all fluffy and flowery and green sunny paths, and that didn't appeal to me. It wasn't until I finally read some of the older books I found that a balance between light and dark is possible, and it clicked for me. For the first year or so reading Cunningham and Silverwolf I didn't have the whole picture and therefore spent a lot of time only slightly interested in the Craft. Then when I did learn about traditional ways I had to unlearn my previous assumptions from the other books. It would have been so much simpler if someone told me to read A Witches Bible or The Grimoire of Lady Sheba sooner. I was actually told by a few people to not even tlread the older more hard-core books."
Wicca,3ducji,Rvb321,3,Tue Jul 21 00:38:38 2015 UTC,"I agree that a lot of current books on Wicca are watered down, but I wouldn't  consider Cunningham to be a part of that. Is his take on Wicca a bit more eclectic? Sure, but it's leaps and bounds better than a lot of the fluffy, pop-Paganism that you see so much of now. Hell, I  was in a bookstore just earlier today, and their new age section was abysmal."
Wicca,3ducji,mtvisdead,-1,Sun Jul 19 21:43:09 2015 UTC,I think Cunningham is watered down and he writes about a lot of superstitions that I had to correct myself on when learning more about Wicca and Witchcraft. I think he's a good intro to Wicca but that's all
Wicca,3ducji,mtvisdead,3,Sun Jul 19 23:06:03 2015 UTC,"he writes about a lot of superstitions that I had to correct myself on when learning more about Wicca and Witchcraft.   Out of curiosity, what superstitions were these?"
Wicca,3ducji,mtvisdead,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:32:58 2015 UTC,"I mean I don't wanna make it seem like I hate Scott Cunningham's books I just appreciate them as a small piece of variations on wiccan practice and not comprehensive at all, with a lot of neo-wiccan Californian additions thrown in"
Wicca,3dttvi,midwintermoons,5,Sun Jul 19 12:02:09 2015 UTC,"AAAA so we went up to see my father-in-law and his new wife yesterday at their ranch in the mountains. At one point, my husband was talking to his dad and I was talking to his wife, and she asked me if I wanted to see something ""really special"" and took me over to their grill, which had a sign on it that said DO NOT OPEN. She tapped on the top and very carefully lifted the lid up, and there was a nest with the itty-bittiest baby birds ever. Wrens had built a nest in there and there were maybe half a dozen tiny, naked, bug-eyed little babies in there, about the size of half of my finger. They had only hatched a few days ago. So she was right, it was really, really special! I've never seen wild baby birds that young."
Wicca,3dttvi,lilystarfire,3,Sun Jul 19 22:27:16 2015 UTC,"Sometime last summer a robin built a nest in a bush right next to the big window in my mom's living room, and once the babies hatched and started cheeping you could hear it through the glass.   The window had constant nose-smudge marks because my cats were very interested."

Wicca,3dttvi,Oklahom0,3,Mon Jul 20 00:11:28 2015 UTC,"Merry meet everyone! So, I've been working with small success on shields until work last night. I had recently made a new charm bag and put certain stones in it. The shield I created with it was. . . incredible is only what I can think. The energy first started as several blue spirals from the earth up surrounding me that I manipulated to form a ball. It seems to be an emotion to vision shield, because I noticed it changed with the mood of the store and the songs playing. Like, Enya would make the spirals look more like the light at the bottom of the pool, Lindsey Stirling made it look like being engulfed in blue fire, and the walk home made it turn clear until some new coworkers came up and talked with me.  I also noticed an increase in my abilities with energy manipulation. 2 years ago was the first time I made several lights to stop this angry mood I was in and desired it to stop. That drained the hell out of me. A year ago I did the same thing with a much stronger tornado of lights due to a much stronger anger pattern, and it drained me more than the first time, but wasn't proportional to the difference in effects. Last night, I tried the same thing while working while thinking about my ex, and it seemed to barely phase me! Even all of the energy that I've been putting into the shield seemed to only make me a bit sleepy, but not drained of energy."

Wicca,3dsgia,indigosnowflake,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:49:14 2015 UTC,"Thing is, the four leafed clover is supposed to bring you luck anyway, without a separate spell. Traditionally it would be carried on the person, though, rather than kept in a book."
Wicca,3dprxd,ForeverFoxyLove,4,Sat Jul 18 06:58:10 2015 UTC,"I would advise against trying to learn too much too quickly. In my experience those who learn a little at a time tend to stay the course better, and end up better wiccans. Those with lots of knowledge but who haven't had the time to develop the necessary wisdom sometimes burn out and leave the Craft. With that in mind my preference for much early training is experiential. Guided meditations, setting up and using a simple altar, making and using simple tools. Stuff like that. Oh, and lots of time out in the woods/hills communing with nature. If the young man has a pantheon he is interested in, it's probably a nice idea to find a good (non-wiccan) book about that pantheon so that his use of them can be grounded in history. Only if all this delights the young man and he's eager for more would I move on to specifically wiccan books to give him a background in what he's doing. As to what, that depends on you and your interests - it's best that he gets books to read which genuinely excite you, as that excitement should be infectious."

Wicca,3dprxd,Literally_JaclynGlen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:38:09 2015 UTC,Sadly I rent. And my backyard is tiny and walking distance to the park so that's why I wish it was loose. You know those taxes would be well spent the instant you walked in a huge labyrinth in Loose.  Funny story. The other Person who had the idea of petitioning for it is a British African American witch xD

I honestly think the labyrinth would get constantly vandalised. You should post back here if you're successful though. I'd visit it.

You wouldn't believe the hate I get pushed onto me too just for being his friend. But he's probably the best person I know so that won't change for a long time.

Also I'm going to insist that we take at LEAST one ghost tour this October.  Also just out of curiosity, did you get your cat from the humane society, and if so did they not cover the cost of her spay?

Wicca,3dgwb6,AllanfromWales,3,Thu Jul 16 06:41:17 2015 UTC,"If you've read the replies to date you'll be getting the idea. There's much that an IRL coven can give you which an online coven can't. But nonetheless, online covens do exist and can offer a useful alternative to only working solo if there is no IRL coven available to you."
Wicca,3dgwb6,wolfanotaku,3,Thu Jul 16 08:24:49 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing -- it depends on /why/ you want to join an online coven.  Online covens are wonderful in someways but they are not so wonderful in other ways. One of the things that I found most powerful about about joining a coven and learning under the HPS and HP is the feeling of getting up and being responsible to go to our weekly meetings or our Sabbats or Esbats. This gave me a sense of the culture of my chosen tradition and gave me people to interact with who were a safehaven.  Aside from that, being there with Elders who had come before me taught me a lot just from watching them.  That said, if you have no other option then an online coven might be a good way for you to at least seek out fellowship.  So if you're just looking for people to chat with and learn from on a peer level then I think an online coven would be just fine for that. They'll probably have a forum and they'll probably have people who are more experienced who you can chat with from time to time.  That said if you're looking to learn and be taught and go through the process of getting initiated and elevated that is probably something you're going to have to do in person. If you're having trouble finding one in you area I would look in the nearby surrounding areas (like an hour or 2's drive from you). I have known people who studied with covens that were 3 hours from them.  They made the effort and worked with the HPS to arrange things so that they didn't have to make the drive too too often, but because they wanted it enough they did what needed to be done."
Wicca,3dgwb6,MorrigansRaven,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:46:56 2015 UTC,"I would highly recommend the Circle of Oak and Mistletoe. It is Australian based and does have an irl group, but is welcoming and active online. I know that they host rituals on Second Life as well as lots of chats and their own forum. There is also a set of Outer Court lessons you can work through where the circle leader will skype you each month to talk about your development.   Oak and Mistletoe"

Wicca,3dgwb6,mtvisdead,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:52:04 2015 UTC,"In all serious, condescension free, if I were you I would try my hardest to seek at least a working partner. You don't need a coven of 13. For at least 2 years my solitary practice was supplemented with occasional magical meetings with my best friend who wasn't wiccan but thought it was interesting and spiritual, so she worked with me. This taught me a lot. An online coven in terms of practice seems no different than a study group, and a coven is more than a study group. You need to share energy; touching peoples hands, hearing their voice in the circle with you, both of you smelling the same incense and dancing the same motions, I don't think webcamming would be nearly as magical. If you want an online coven do it, but just know it will not be nearly the same as a personal coven or even a single working partner.   There are coven's almost everywhere in the world. Where do you live? I'm sure there's one near you, if not then check witchvox.com for listings in your area, and talk to someone! If you have any spiritual type stores ask people there if they are wiccan and if they ever hold open rituals or meetups, and maybe you can join. Best of luck with both online covens and personal covens."
Wicca,3dgwb6,BLUEDOLPHIN6793,-1,Fri Jul 17 05:11:46 2015 UTC,It would be quite difficult to hold hands open the circle burn. Well you get my point. Us this sight.

Such connections are obviously more likely when we work with magic circles which are 'a space between the realms of men and the realms of the mighty ones'. Within this paradigm, the effect of cleansing is to break the connections between the realms, but not to interfere with the spirits within their own realms.

I don't wanna be ""that guy"" but can you provide a source for this?  The makeup of the Abrahamic temples very much falls in line with their theology and dogma. Putting the priest/rabbi/imam, as a representative of God, at the head of the temple to lead people in worship. The recreations of pre-Christian temples that I have seen do not seem to follow that format."

And paint a picture on my tomb With dirt and a piece of bough Of a girl and a boy beneath a round, ripe moon Eating of love with an eager spoon And vowing an eager vow. And do not keep my plot mowed smooth And clean as a spinsterâ€™s bed, But let the weed, the flower, the tree, Riotous, rampant, wild and free, Grow high above my head.

Wicca,3d8tbf,samata_the_heard,5,Tue Jul 14 12:02:09 2015 UTC,"Merry meet all!  I did a super intense ritual last night. It was very personal and dealt with a lot of negative feelings. At one point in the middle of it I was so overwhelmed I started crying like a baby. I realized later that I really, really needed to grieve in that way, and I hadn't before because I had been avoiding thinking about it too hard. I had never felt the presence of the deities so strongly before. I really did feel like there were warm arms around me as I cried.  I'm always amazed by the emotional impact these rituals can have on me. It was extremely healing and cathartic. I'm sure I'm not done with the grieving yet, but it gave me a good start, and now I know that I have a safe place I can go to vent and process those feelings.  Anyway, I'm going to be taking it easy for the rest of the week. No big plans, no major life changes or anything like that. Just resting up and meditating and existing for a while."
Wicca,3d8tbf,indigosnowflake,2,Tue Jul 14 14:48:02 2015 UTC,"My first ritual was like this, too. I didn't even realize that I had so much pent up stress, but half way through my ritual I was overcome with so much peace I started crying out of relief. It's beautiful the way the God and Goddess can soothe our souls like this."
Wicca,3d8tbf,samata_the_heard,2,Tue Jul 14 15:53:41 2015 UTC,It's also a nice sign to me that I'm on the right path spiritually I think. The only time I ever cried that hard when I was a Christian was when I felt guilty about something and was being shamed for it.
Wicca,3d76r7,FigDestroyerofWorlds,3,Tue Jul 14 01:32:28 2015 UTC,No I believe all dreams have meaning. Even if just to remind you of something. Mostly I do I for a sign. I don't understand the reference to the email as I do not know you. Matched you will be working in a restaurant that serves snails. Or another thing will happen involving snails. Or they are just a clue to something else. I find a notebook and pen by the bed. Right what you remember. Then start looking for any other repetitions etc... Good luck and happy dreams. Blessed Be!!!
Wicca,3d76r7,BLUEDOLPHIN6793,3,Tue Jul 14 03:31:45 2015 UTC,"I suggest reading up on the symbolism of snails! They relate to thing like patience, protection, fertility, and movement. The spiral of their shell is also significant - spirals symbolize the expanding journey of life."
Wicca,3d76r7,petitcorbeau,2,Tue Jul 14 04:22:28 2015 UTC,"http://kittythedreamer.hubpages.com/hub/Snail-and-Slug-Symbolism-and-Spirit-Guides  I'm browsing this page as I write this. I notice that snail shells seem to have a widdershins spiral. Generally this is 'unlucky' or at odd with the natural progress. The page above suggests snails represent   the spiral or cycle of life, death, and rebirth the earth's rotation around the sun   The snail is very timid and slow as well. Although protected, it is a delicate little thing.   I could see why these themes would come up in dreams."
Wicca,3d76r7,MisoPlas,2,Tue Jul 14 14:53:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link, it's a super helpful website! I feel kinda dumb that my googling talents were lacking lol."
Wicca,3d76r7,samata_the_heard,2,Tue Jul 14 15:20:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about snail symbolism, but when a dream image sort of ""asserts"" itself the way you describe - starting on your arm or hand and then moving to your mouth - it is trying hard to get your attention. I think you're right that it means something.  Have you asked yourself what snails mean to YOU? That may be more relevant than what they mean in a more general sense.  For instance, when I think of snails, I see them as funny, happy little creatures with no hurry in their lives. I see them as deeply self-protective creatures - living in a beautiful shell and generating slime to keep themselves from being hurt by the surface they're crawling on. I think of snails appearing after a rain, showing that the rain is over.  So if I were having recurring dreams about snails, I would think that the dreams were telling me that I should realize that something that was troubling me or blocking me or otherwise making my life difficult (i.e. rain) is now over, and I can relax a little, slow down, and focus on building up my own self-protections - a beautiful shell, a little slime to lubricate myself from the abrasiveness of the world, etc.  But that's just me - however you see snails in your waking life may give you a sign about what they mean in your dreaming life."
Wicca,3d76r7,powerbus,2,Tue Jul 14 15:20:18 2015 UTC,"Are the snails pulled tightly into their shells, or are they coming out and moving? The snail pulling out of the shell to move along could represent breaking away from a locked in condition and progressing along a path. If the snail is still tucked away safely it could mean that more work is needed to push the envelope, to break away from old safe beliefs and ideas."

Wicca,3d05cx,im4moose,21,Sun Jul 12 10:53:00 2015 UTC,"You seeem to be contradicting yourself: In my everyday life I follow the Wiccan rede, I keep my thoughts pure with love and peace and I pray to the God/Goddess when I need guidance.. How do you put Wicca in your everyday life? That is putting wicca into your everyday life. Doing regular rituals is an add-on, and frankly much less important. However, if that is what you want to do I would suggest: - Set up an altar. At least initially it doesn't need to be more than an empty flat surface. - Buy some nightlight candles, and place two on the altar. The one on the left can represent the God and the one on the right the Goddess. - Every evening light the candles, then stand or sit in front of them. - Think back on your day. Identify three good things that have happened during the day, and offer thanks for them. - Think forward to tomorrow. Identify three things you would like to happen tomorrow, and ask for the help of the God and Goddess in these things. - Five minutes of silent meditation in which you empty your mind of all conscious thought and just listen. When the need is there, the God and/or Goddess will send messages to you in this time. - Put out the candles with thanks to the God and Goddess."
Wicca,3d05cx,AllanfromWales,11,Sun Jul 12 12:10:40 2015 UTC,"To this I would add:  -consider three bad things each day as well. The Craft is about balance. Accepting the negative is vital to processing and moving past it, whether the source of negativity is you or someone else.  -Don't worry about keeping your thoughts pure and clean. Anger, rage, sadness and sorrow are all part of the human condition. In Wicca we accept who and what we are--including the messy bits. After all, look at all the issues Christian sexual repression has caused, simply because people wouldn't accept humans as inherently sexual beings. Don't let those thoughts dominate you, but don't hide from them either. Mind and heart need balance too, and avoiding any emotion is tyranny of the mind over the heart.   -Understand that you are entering a spiritual tradition that is very very different from Christianity. Our gods are not generally in the business of prayer answering (that's why we work magic to invoke their aid), and we are not central.   -I would disagree with the above poster's comment that regular rituals are less important. Wicca is orthopraxic (focused on doing the right thing(s)) rather than orthdox (believing the right things). However rituals do not have to be huge and time-consuming. A daily devotion can be done in moments--the five minutes of silent meditation he mentioned is a ritual! (Rituals are merely actions we repeat that have (or had) meaning; a handshake is a ritual act).  Above all else, listen to Shakespeare, and to thine own self be true."

If it becomes a good habit, you're less likely to fall off."
Wicca,3d05cx,mortedarthur,2,Sun Jul 12 16:19:25 2015 UTC,"What Allan said. Just know that you don't have to do ritual prayers every morning or whatever. You know you better than anyone else.

You can try to incorporate the prayers and all that, but if it isn't working out for you, don't push it. Just go with the flow."

The entire trip, I was terrified out of my mind and wanted safety and some reality to hold on to. Instead, I dealt with pain and was forced to try to deal with something when my emotional state affected the way I view the world around me.  Since then, I've lost what little defenses I have in the world. My awkwardness kicks in, my fear of being hated and breaking social norms is very high, but every emotion I have is also on edge, to where I don't know how to curb them and make myself feel better. I feel like I'm a slave to these passing emotions and fear it will ruin my life if I don't figure out how to find my defenses that I learned so naturally before-hand."
Wicca,3d09jt,WhiteRastaJ,3,Sun Jul 12 18:28:45 2015 UTC,"You need to recenter yourself. Acid's lingering effects are different for everyone. Basically, you've opened yourself to yourself, and that's left you completely open. Your friends, frankly, are assholes. When having a bad trip you need love, reassurance and support, not forced confrontation of emotional issues.   Take some time for yourself. Remove yourself from sources of stress. Meditate, and visualize yourself clad in armor. Keep this up until you can almost feel that armor physically. Then, when an issue arises, mentally get your armor on. It'll take time, but eventually it'll help get you back to where you were.  Don't do acid again. Your first trip will color future ones with a natural fear and concern, which will throw you into a bad trip again. If you need more advice, or just a friendly ear, PM. If needed we can flip to email, phone or Skype, Whatever you need."
Wicca,3d09jt,Oklahom0,3,Mon Jul 13 01:25:39 2015 UTC,"Thank  you.  Other  than  the  whole  annoying  friends  thing,  I  actually  enjoyed  parts  of  it.  I  got  over  my  arachnaphobia,  dealt  with  a  repressed  crush  and  fear  of  rejection  as  well  as  my  dependant  nature.  Right  now  I'm  watching  a  show  called  Princess  Tutu  to  bring  myself  back  together.  It  works  rather  well  in  small  peices.  I  will  try  the  armor  method  tomorrow  after  I  sleep."

He  already  kind  of  looked  like  him  and  did  something  with  lights  that  made  him  go  ""ooh  shiny""  and  me  go  ""fuck!  Monster!""  But  they  tried  some  ""let  it  go  into  the  fire""  bs  that  didn't  work.  Then  the  ex-crush  kept  trying  to  get  me  to  admit  how  I  felt  while  on  acid  and  has  the  balls  to  get  pissed  at  me  for  ""hiding""  a  crush  I  was  unaware  of.  Outside  of  that  and  high-energy  people,  the  trip  helped  me  get  over  not  only  the  crush  I  was  unaware  of,  but  also  my  arachnaphobia."

Wicca,3cy0sw,x-ray_girl,2,Sat Jul 11 20:17:56 2015 UTC,"I don't have any input on astrology, but for the astronomy and stargazing side, I can't recommend H.A. Rey's The Stars: A New Way to See Them highly enough. A very approachable yet thorough guide to everything you'll see in the sky, with inventive depictions of the constellations that really look like their namesakes (H.A. Rey is the author of the Curious George books, and The Stars has a similar charm). Best if you are between 30 and 50 degrees N, i.e. most of the continental U.S., but there are also smaller and less extensive sky charts for other latitudes.  You also might enjoy The Starlore Handbook, which talks about myths associated with pretty much every celestial body and constellation. I particularly enjoy the information it gives about the major stars in each constellation, including the origins of their names.  Also check out stardate.org, which has a daily radio program discussing topics of astronomical interest and also daily tips on what to look for in the sky."

Wicca,3cw2bb,LeGilligan,3,Sat Jul 11 06:43:57 2015 UTC,"I cannot stress enough that if you want to learn about a god or spirit of a culture, you want to read their actual mythology. These are the primary sources, and you always want to read primary source material. There are plenty of great translations of manymany world mythologies in English. Get a copy of whichever you are interested in and read the actual stories. Then, read secondary sources, which are the interpretations of academics who study these folklores and mythologies. They will give you more to chew on/think about. It will help you to develop and understanding of these beings and help you form your own opinions of them and familiarity with them, which will help you to reach out to them and begin to develop your own relationship.   A book with tons of Gods and Goddesses isn't going to give you much useful details other than to be able to point you to their mythology. figure out what your drawn to, then figure out which Gods share those associations, and then start researching :) Good luck!"

Wicca,3css9b,McSloshed,3,Fri Jul 10 16:49:32 2015 UTC,"Hi. Just a quick note to clarify something in case it gives cause to alter anything on your end: a binding spell and a banishing spell are not the same thing. They have almost opposite effects. When you banish, you push someone away from you. When you bind, you wrap them up in your own energy, thereby forming a link to them, and keep them close and under thumb. If you bind someone AND banish them, you're kind of moving them in opposite directions and it usually won't work that well. If you're really releasing them, you can't control them. So think about the symbolic actions in your working that represent these things and maybe alter them to be more suitable. It sounds like you want freedom, so by all mean, banish in the best way possible.  But if you hang on to the idea of controlling your parents, you won't allow them to get far enough. The person you need to control is you, and if that means bolstering yourself against their negativity, then focus on that while you push them away, so that their anchors find no ground in which to root their ship to you.   Good luck. Sounds shitty but necessary."
Wicca,3css9b,McSloshed,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:48:16 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, I didn't even think about that but you are so right. Thank you for pointing that out. To be honest, I was less than sure about the binding aspect than everything else, so to cross that off my list would be no big thing. I appreciate your insight very much."
Wicca,3css9b,lunanous23,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:54:59 2015 UTC,"In Wicca, there's an order in which things are  normally approached, which is summed up in a short saying:  ""It is better to bless than to bind, it is better to bind than to banish, it is better to banish than to blast.""  It's basically the order in which things should be approached. Blessing someone so they find happiness (potentially elsewhere) is ideal to get a problem person to go away. Binding them to keep them from harming you is better than forcing them away against their will. If that fails, you banish them, whether its in their best interest or not, and if all else fails and something still absolutely needs to be done, then you blast them into either incapacity or their next incarnation. The ideal is always to cover your bases before you go one degree stronger."
Wicca,3css9b,EminentlyReasonable,2,Fri Jul 10 20:40:54 2015 UTC,"I was part of separation ritual (different circumstances though) and was surprised that I was asked to remember and visualize all the bad feelings/experiences I had with regards to what I was being separated from, and all the good feelings/experiences.

Wicca,3csfun,samata_the_heard,8,Fri Jul 10 12:02:12 2015 UTC,"Merry meet and happy Friday!  Last night I completed my wand: http://imgur.com/KoIOzGx  I wrapped it in silver wire and added hematite for improving my intuition, purple fluorite for focusing my goals, cherry quartz for helping my spells stay within the realm of the ""big picture"", and clear quartz clustered at the top for all the quartzy reasons you can think of. All of those stones also have very significant personal meaning to me as well.   I'm really happy with it. I did a brief consecration ritual last night which went well. Unfortunately, for the ""cakes and ale"" portion of the night I brewed what I thought was peppermint tea but I accidentally grabbed the wrong box and I made chamomile tea instead. Which isn't a big deal except that the taste of chamomile tea makes me feel nauseated so I felt sick for the rest of the night.   Funny story: my daughter was observing the ritual from outside my circle and as I was meditating on my wand, watching all the rainbow colors of my chakras flow into it and emerge as a beautiful glowing white light (it was a beautiful image), and I was really, really deep in this meditation, my daughter accidentally fell backwards off her chair. She's fine but it startled the crap out of me. I can't remember when I've been so startled in my life actually. I snapped out of the meditation so fast it made me dizzy. Like it made my head spin it was so sudden.   But other than those mishaps (which I have come to accept as part of life, and I rely on the sense of humor of the Lord and Lady to get me through them), the ritual went great. My wand feels like it's positively glowing this morning and I can't stop looking at it. :)"
