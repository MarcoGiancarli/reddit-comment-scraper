What you can do is subscribed to Politico's 2016 blast, which gives you (almost) daily updates on what's going on, what each candidate is saying, and will usually include where they'll be daily as well. They summarize articles in emails that go out daily, but also have the links to the articles themselves. It may be more than you want.  As far as money however, keep in mind that financial disclosures don't get updated daily. We just got a disclosure deadline that helped tell us who raised what, but we don't normally know in full besides estimates and goals. I mean, there are some things we can tell, like when an event happens and has ""X"" people and usually a $2,700 buy-in, but that doesn't factor in Super PAC events.  So yeah, I'd follow that.

Ask_Politics,3e4s7k,herpaladerpala,4,Tue Jul 21 23:19:44 2015 UTC,"The best answer to that question is, ""it depends."" It depends on what you define as poor in Syria, what ethnic or sectarian groups they belong to, and where they are located. For those living in contested areas, they don't really have a choice on who to support. As Thucydides once said, ""the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must."" They have been unable to flee the country due to lacking the funds necessary to survive in another country or even to purchase a passport. Many have been stuck in makeshift refugee camps along the Turkish or Lebanese border that get targeted by regime and rebel elements. They have been executed by nearly all sides for belonging to the wrong ethnic or sectarian group. Those in government-controlled territory have been forcefully conscripted in the Syrian armed forces, and those in the rebel areas have been struck by barrel bombs, ballistic missiles, or chemical weapons. And that's not mentioning those living under ISIL.   That said, the only ""poor"" in Syria that have appeared to consistently support a single side have been the minority groups. The Kurds have largely supported the Kurdish YPG and the other minorities--such as the Alawites, Christians, and Druze--have largely supported the Syrian government. However, the support from the poor of these minority groups towards Assad's regime has been deteriorating recently, especially among the Alawites who are seen as Assad's most loyal group and therefore have been enlisted more than any other group by the government. The elites among the Alawite community have not hard to sacrifice much towards the war in terms of manpower, where as nearly all of the poor Alawites have had to send their sons, brothers, fathers, or husbands off to be killed in the war. The result in a very disproportionate level of support given by the poor Alawites, to the point where many families have lost all of their male relatives of fighting age and mothers have begun sending their sons away so that they will not be drafted. At the moment this does not mean that the Alawites are ready to switch their support to the rebels, but there is a growing perception that Assad is willing to fight to the last Alawite to stay in power."

Huntsman was re-elected with 77% of the vote. Huntsman's approval rating reached over 90% and he left office with an 80% approval rating.   Those numbers combined with the fact that Huntsman cut taxes and ran a fiscally conservative administration should have been enough for the GOP to get behind him but instead they went with this guy:   Romney barely won Gov of Mass with 50% of the vote Romney's Mass was 47th in job creation Romney left office with a 34% approval rating ranking him 48th out of 50. Romney didn't run for re-election.   It boggles my mind.  Michelle fucking Bachman got more votes than Jon Huntsman..  Even if you go with the ""successful businessman"" argument Huntsman would win there as well.  Huntsman-money makes Romney-money look like pocket change.

Ask_Politics,3e2dc8,pmaj82,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:21:41 2015 UTC,"Basically everyone else has summed it up efficiently, but one niche complaint I read about him was that he didn't ""wait his turn"". What was meant by this is that he was comparatively young (just over 50 born in the 1960s when other candidates like Romney and Cain were all in their 60s having been born in the 1940s). The article that made the ""turn"" argument assesses that everyone knew Romney was going to run again while Huntsman was questionable given a lot of the reasons others have listed, and Huntsman's running basically made everyone hesitate getting behind Romney. He provided an alternative ""moderate"", ""businessman"", etc. candidate so people were temporarily unsure of who to back. Yes, Romney himself was a political juggernaut, but Huntsman had a lot of advantages to make people consider backing him - loads more money, extremely popular in one of the reddest states, big jobs numbers, foreign policy experience, etc. He also had a lot of close friends and associates  in high places, like how Huntsman had endorsed McCain over Romney and Huntsman expected a return of the favor.  This delay was then attributed to the antics seen in the drawn out process Romney was forced to go through since he threw a wrench in Romney's ability to quickly consolidate his place. This made others see him as vulnerable and thus led to everyone and their brother thinking Romney wasn't as inevitable as he was.  tl:dr Huntsman was so similar to Romney, people didn't quickly support Romney so he made other clearly unqualified candidates think they had a chance. His alleged principal role in muddying up of the process made people see him as the chief outlying candidate. He never fit in and therefore never had a chance with conservative media sharing him in a good light with the party base."

There are some special rules where sometimes you can sell one asset and buy another without paying cap gains. When you sell the second asset, you pay tax on the difference between the sale price of the second and the purchase price of the first.  That can be years in the future though.

Ask_Politics,3e163k,jimngo,7,Tue Jul 21 04:02:06 2015 UTC,"Not all politically motivated attacks are terrorism   The definition the United States (generally) uses as terrorism can be found on an FBI page:   ""Domestic terrorism"" means activities with the following three characteristics:  Involve acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law;  Appear intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination. or kidnapping; and  Occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S.   I quoted the relevant one: this is obviously not international. And the federal crime of terrorism is a bit weirder and I don't think that applies perfectly either.  In this case, we know that 1 and 3 are automatically filled: the acts are dangerous to human life and violate law, and occurred within the United States. Next we know it has to satisfy one of the three sub-rules under section 2. Was it intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population? Was it intended to influence the policy of a government, or its conduct?  These are interesting questions. In reality, a sincere determination would probably rest on intent, which has a legal meaning of its own. Right now, people are probably calling it terrorism because the shooter expressed anti-US sentiments, and may have become radicalized in Jordan. If he was, say, dissatisfied with the US war on terror and sought to attack servicemembers to intimidate them (or the government) out of it, even if he had no chance of success in intimidating anyone, the intent is what matters to call it terrorism. And right now, that's what seems likely.  I wouldn't rule out it just being a case of someone having mental illness and not seeking to coerce or intimidate, but the line between them is very fine. I would argue that Dylan Rooff was also a terrorist, for that matter."

The unofficial or unauthorized use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims; (originally) such practices used by a government or ruling group (freq. through paramilitary or informal armed groups) in order to maintain its control over a population; (now usually) such practices used by a clandestine or expatriate organization as a means of furthering its aims.  b.

If Ron Paul were to win, you know he's going to cut everything possible, so you know that if you want anything done beyond basics, you have to look at private companies or charities.  If Bernie wins, you will probably pay more taxes, but so will the corporations that aren't paying any right now and you will(hopefully) see some more benefit from it(single payer healthcare, infrastructure improvements, etc).  Both of these options are better(imo) than the status quo of individuals paying mid to high taxes and still running deficits while not seeing any real tangible return on those taxes(funding more wars, tax credits to large corps, etc).  I think there is a certain amount of people that say ""I don't like what I'm getting for the amount of taxes I pay"".

This part is very true. On the other hand, we know that reddit (I'm homogenising here, as you correctly pointed out) likes to brigade based on very little information. There is, however, a belief amongst users that they are 'well informed'. I think for the majority this is delusion. There are a lot of people on reddit who can give very specific expert knowledge, for example historians or scientists. The vast majority go with 'what appears to be good'. It appears to be good that both Ron Paul and Sanders support civil liberties, rights, 'freedoms' etc, so there is no need for these users to look at how the two differ in economic policy.   Snappy headlines on the front page is how the user base first encounters information. Some of these users don't even read the article or comments to get more in-depth or counter arguments. By the time they do, they have already internalised a perception of the person/issue.   'Young' candidates or that is ones that are not well known are exhilarating for redditors who are themselves relatively young (in their 20s). All their lives they've grown up hearing that older candidates or people who are more well known are facing criticism, like Trump or Hilary. It doesn't matter that they haven't interrogated the criticisms, because they have not heard many criticisms against people like Ron Paul or Sanders.

If no one is really going to do what we want or is unable to do what we want I think fundamental changes need to be made. To capitulate to the existing system rather than try to REALLY change it is sad. If everyone who was really unhappy with the way things are said enough we could change things.

Ask_Politics,3dttgu,uompan123,3,Sun Jul 19 11:56:28 2015 UTC,"My take on it:  (1) Japan's economy will be forever relevant during your lifetime.  It's very strong, and while new Chinese electronics upstarts like Xiaomi pose a big threat to the market shares of Japanese companies, lest we forget that the Japanese have weathered the assaults of the Korean companies. The Japanese economy is innovative and resilient, and they are capable of developing and refining plenty of technology.   I think that any sinking of their economy would be a slow one of attrition that would be centered around regional Chinese growth.   But the model that is being proposed for Korea by some outside experts recommend that the Korean companies attempt to integrate themselves within the growing Chinese economy. That is to say, that they seek deals and agreements with the Chinese so as to not be perpetually a competitor but also cooperative.   You could say for similar reasons the Europeans do not feel necessarily threatened by US economic expansion -- they know that the expansion, while competitive, is also something that provides opportunity for new working relationships with American companies, not just an outright assault on the local economy.   Take the iPhone, for instance... While initially posing an existential threat to Korean companies, it eventually provided a basis for massive market expansion and turning what used to be a smaller product on your budget, your tiny flip phone that only had a few functions, into a much larger monthly (& yearly) bill, and a greater investment.   Likewise, the role of Nike doesn't mean that they will displace all European models... It has meant that brands like Europe's Adidas not jus thave more competition, but also have a more competitive market that is always branching out and becoming more important in consumer's lives.   (2) Japan is becoming more geopolitically relevant  However you feel about Shinzo Abe's conservative politics, he has kicked a hornet's nest with the Koreans with his proposals to expand Japanese military again and make it more relevant. Japan is now thinking of itself in different terms -- as being a geopolitical force, not just one to calmly stand by and watch the north Koreans and the Chinese rattle sabers.   I would even say that if Japan's economy became less of a player and more paltry, we'd see more saber rattling from the Japanese government in an effort to reassert themselves.   A good Japanese economy is probably necessary to prevent a rise of Japanese nationalist sentiment that would probably have an even greater impact on regional politics.   (3) Japan is an enormous culture exporter.  Japan remains a massive Asian cultural icon. While Korea is moving forward along these lines, it probably only will serve to spur on the Japanese cultural exports.   Not to mention: in academic fields the Japanese philosophical, religious and artistic heritage is a very huge topic. Tons of academics from all countries look to Japan because of its particularly unique take on a lot of things.   Japan is going to be very relevant during the whole of your life... Even if it begins to lose relevance, it'll be a discussion point."
Ask_Politics,3dttgu,kulturkampf,2,Mon Jul 20 05:08:15 2015 UTC,"Good answer, i think Nationalism is a difficult word to use with Japan because of the historical connotations. Old style nationalism seems irrelevant, Abe's policies are divisive as it is. Is it not fair to say that the only viable method of growing nationalist sentiment would be through a pro-west/anti-China path. Just anything else would so massively contrary to how the country has progressed."
Ask_Politics,3dttgu,Tukfssr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:50:09 2015 UTC,That is true. The old nationalism was radical in every sense of the word. It demanded full attention and devotion of the people and even bent the will of local Buddhists to believe in the divinity or pseudo-divinity of the Emperor and the Creation mythology of Japan that would give it some divine right to conquer (with the help of some perverse Nichiren teachings).  The new nationalism is a more conventional one.
Ask_Politics,3dttgu,kulturkampf,3,Mon Jul 20 15:59:37 2015 UTC,"I recommend reading the book ""The Next 100 Years by George Friedman.  Here is part of the summary that includes Japan...  Russian and Chinese fragmentation...   In the 2020s, the collapse of the Russian government and the fragmentation of mainland China will leave Eurasia in general chaos. Other powers will then move in to annex or establish spheres of influence in the area, and in many cases, regional leaders will secede. In Russia, Chechnya and other Muslim regions, as well as the Pacific Far East will become independent, Finland will annex Karelia, Romania will annex Moldova, Tibet will gain independence with help from India, Taiwan will extend its influence into China, while the United States, European powers, and Japan will re-create regional spheres of influence in mainland China.   New Powers Arise   In the 2020s and 2030s, three main powers will emerge in Eurasia: Turkey, Poland, and Japan. Initially supported by the United States, Turkey will expand its sphere of influence and become a regional power, much as it was during the time of the Ottoman Empire. The Turkish sphere of influence will extend into the Arab world, which will have increasingly fragmented by then, and north into Russia and other former Soviet Union countries. Israel will continue to be a powerful nation and will be the only country in the immediate region to remain outside the Turkish sphere of influence. However, Israel will be forced to come to an accommodation with Turkey due to Turkey's military and political power. Meanwhile, Japan will expand its economic influence to regions of coastal China, the Russian Far East, and many Pacific Islands. Friedman predicts that Japan will change its foreign policy during this time period, becoming more geopolitically aggressive, beginning a major military buildup. Friedman predicts that Japan will build military strength capable of regionally projecting power across East Asia during this time. Finally, Poland will continue to lead its military alliance, the ""Polish Bloc."" Poland and its allies will be a major power, much like the time of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Now possessing substantial military strength, Poland will expand its economic influence into what was formerly European Russia, and will begin to compete with Turkey for influence in the important economic region of the Volga River Valley. Around this time, space programs for military use will begin to emerge, and Japan and Turkey will increasingly begin to develop military capabilities in space.   Tensions Build   At the beginning of this period, the United States will be allied with all three powers. By 2020, the United States will have been allied with Turkey and Japan for over 75 years. However, in the years after the end of the Second Cold War and collapse of Russia, the United States will gradually become uneasy as Turkey and Japan expand their military power and economic influence. Establishing regional spheres of influence, Turkey and Japan will begin to threaten American interests. The growth of Turkish and Japanese naval power, and their military activities in space will be particularly disturbing to the United States. Japan and Turkey, having similar interests, will probably form an alliance near the end of this period, in an effort to counter the overwhelming global power of the United States. The book also speculates that Germany and Mexico may possibly join this anti-United States coalition, although it is generally unlikely. In this coming confrontation, the United States will be allied with the ""Polish Bloc,"" probably with a restabilized China, India, a reunified Korea, and the United Kingdom. By the 2040s, there will be global tension and competition between these two alliances.   WORLD WAR III   In the mid-21st century, around the year 2050, a Third World War will take place, between the United States, the ""Polish Bloc,"" Britain, India, and China on one side, and Turkey and Japan on the other, with Germany and France entering the war in its late stages on the side of Turkey and Japan. According to the book, the war will probably be started by a coordinated Turkish-Japanese sneak attack against the United States and its allies. In the book, Friedman predicts that the attack will take place at a time in which the Americans will be taken completely off guard, and hypothesizes 5:00 p.m. on November 24, 2050 (Thanksgiving Day) as a potential time. The Turkish-Japanese alliance's initial strike will cripple the military capabilities of the United States and its allies. The Turkish-Japanese alliance will then attempt to enter negotiations, demanding the United States accept the Turkish-Japanese's alliance's status as a fellow superpower. However, the United States will reject the terms and go to war, refusing to accept Turkish and Japanese hegemony over Eurasia. The Turkish-Japanese alliance will initially possess a military advantage after crippling the United States' military during its first strike. However, as the war progresses, the balance of power will begin to shift as the United States rebuilds and increases its military capabilities, and pioneers the use of new military technologies. The war will ultimately end with a victory by the United States and its allies.   Post War   The United States will continue to be militarily and politically dominant over the world, and will also cement its hegemony over space. In particular, it will work to keep other powers from developing military capabilities in space. Meanwhile, Turkey will retain the bulk of its sphere of influence, although its de facto empire will become increasingly restive as a result of defeat, while Japan will lose its own sphere of influence. Under the US-dictated treaty that will end World War III, military restrictions will be imposed on both Japan and Turkey, although in practice they will be unenforceable and ""merely a gratuitous humiliation victors enjoy imposing on the vanquished""."

If his poll numbers plummet, then he's over. BUT if he retains his current high levels of support within the GOP base (polling #2 in Iowa, New Hampshire and nationally, IIRC) after that, then something fundamental has changed within the GOP base. If he manages to get away with this, then he's the first guy playing by the new rules, which gives him an advantage over the rest, and I think that would put him toe to toe with the conventionally accepted lead GOP candidates for the GOP nomination. (tl;dr - his outcome following his POW insults reflects his odds going forward; if that doesn't put a serious dent in his popularity, then the unthinkable is a real possibility).  On the Democratic side, depending on how they handle themselves and who they put up as a candidate, that also influences the GOP odds in the general election. A mediocre or poor candidate can win an election if the alternative is perceived as even worse. IMO it's well within the realm of possibility that the billionaires can bombard the airwaves and media to such an extent that they could make even Trump look good in comparison to Sanders. Add to that the probable possibility of 70-something year old Sanders falling ill during the campaign (unless he's a health nut, we have no idea if he can exert himself to the extent required in a presidential campaign at his age), that can feed into Trump's ""alpha dog"" persona and sway people who place serious weight on having someone ""strong"" in charge. Basically, there are things the Democrats can do (intentionally and by tragedy) that can improve the odds of a GOP candidate. Throw in some voter apathy (which Democratic-leaning people excel in) in the circumstance of an embattled or adrift Democratic presidental campaign with the expected scaremongering and flame fanning aimed at GOP-leaning people, and it will be a close election."

Even from a business/exposure side of things, that seems to have made his brand a bit toxic the last three weeks (or so) with how some of the affiliated companies either backed away or dropped him.  Sort of like a one step forward, two steps back thing. Trump probably wont ever be house poor, but I guess he's banking on people having sort memories (as they often do).

Most people aren't paying attention yet, so at best they get a vague sense of ""Trump is saying dumbass shit."" And at the rate he's going, it's not going to last all that much longer.  That said, if he does manage to stay in it, he could start causing problems. Republicans need to keep the messaging away from widely unpopular issues that get their base excited, like immigration. Stir up that pot too much and other candidates might have to make concessions towards those folks, detracting from more relevant/popular messaging. That could cause problems in the general – maybe it'll mean whoever espouses the anti-Trump but broadly popular views (Rand Paul?) ends up with a big boost, but that's a long shot.

The reason Trump and Bush are at the top is because they have name recognition. Most of the country hasn't heard of Rubio, Cruz, Kasich or the rest of the field and vote based on what's familiar to them.   The more important part of the poll is actually spots 8-12. Since CNN/Fox are only letting 10 candidates on their main debate stage, fringe candidates on that bubble could end up making the debate and surviving the public awareness battle for another day. Right now, there's only a 6/10ths percent difference between Christie, Santorum and Perry with Kasich behind them. That is what pundits should care about right now."
Ask_Politics,3donkh,Frank_the_Rat,16,Sat Jul 18 00:03:28 2015 UTC,Senators are elected by a majority of voters in a state. In Wisconsin during our last senatorial election 5/8 districts went to the Republican but the Democrat won.  Edit: math
Ask_Politics,3donkh,DamienSalvation,10,Sat Jul 18 00:08:06 2015 UTC,Senators are not always elected by a majority of voters in the state. It's simply who has the most votes state-wide I believe. A candidate could win a Senate race with as little as 10% of the vote if no other candidate got more votes than them.   The only state I can think of that doesn't do explicitly this is Louisiana which has a jungle primary for all candidates on election day and then the top two candidates advance to a run-off election if no-one gets over 50% of the vote.   This happened in 2014 where the Republican voters split between two major candidates enabling the Democrat to win the primary with only 42% of the vote. They advanced to the run-off where the surviving Republican easily defeated the Democrat 53% to 44%.

I know this probably isn't the answer you're looking for, but honestly, both sides bring up good points. Yes, Iran's economy has been damaged by sanctions and these unfrozen assets of theirs can certainly help them with domestic issues. But on the flip side, these hundreds of billions of dollars can (and at the very least a small portion surely will) easily go to Hamas, Hezbollah, and to ensure that Assad stays in power in Syria. Whether or not a big portion of that money goes to terrorist groups, and how significant that will play out of money does go to them remains to be seen however."
Ask_Politics,3dk7qo,nt337,5,Thu Jul 16 23:17:52 2015 UTC,"I think there will almost certainly be some amount of money going to terrorist groups, supporting Assad, etc. Obama's argument isn't that removing sanctions won't allow Iran to funnel money to these organizations, it's that the sanctions regime was never going to be permanent anyway, Russia and China won't continue sanctioning Iran, hurting their own economies in the process, if Iran is willing to agree to give up nuclear weapons programs which was the point of the sanctions in the first place. So the options realistically aren't keep sanctions or lift them, the options are lift them as part of a deal or let the deal fail and then Russia and China stop sanctioning Iran and they get the money they wanted anyway and then the only option we're left with the stop Iran's nuclear program is military action"

Ask_Politics,3dk7qo,Impune,4,Thu Jul 16 23:24:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think you'll see a 1:1 correlation in dollars used to fund terrorism and unfrozen assets, but the the bottom line is that Iran's military capacity will be strengthened by the nuclear deal, monetarily and physically.  Case in point: the Pentagon owes the Iranian military $400 million, which has sat in escrow ever since diplomatic relations were severed between the two nations. This isn't a crazy amount in the grand scheme of things (Iran's defense budget is just over $10 billion), but it's not nothing either. Where they will spend this money it is hard to say. However, we do know that Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps will likely directly benefit from this extra source of income, and it would be difficult to make sure none of that money makes its way to the Quds Force as it is technically a division of the IRGC.  Other institutions, such as Iran's central bank, will also get signifiant windfalls (the US has frozen nearly $200 billion of the central bank's assets). Their central bank has been tied to terrorist activity in the past.  There is also the question of individual's with assets set to be unfrozen. There are numerous. Very numerous. Obviously, the US and its Allies are not unfreezing assets belonging to known terrorists; however, that doesn't mean that none of the government, military, or familial entities have no connections to terrorism -- or to intermediaries which fund terrorist activities. We shouldn't just assume everyone in Iran is a potential funder of terrorism, because that's not true. However, many of the individuals with frozen assets have ties to the military or other government entities (including the financial sector) which means that there is a potential for some of these funds finding their way into the hands of undesirables.   TL;DR: There is a chance that some of the unfrozen assets will be used to fund terrorist activities, based purely on the fact that banks and military groups with a history of terrorist activity/sponsorship will gain access to a portion of these assets. However, I do not think this will be true for the overwhelming majority of assets. More concerning should be a rapid buildup of Iran's military capacity, which it will use to expand its influence in the region and supply regimes that, while not technically terrorist, are counter to US interests."

It depends on what the investors (both foreign and domestic) decide to do.  It could be invested in other areas, which most likely will work its way back into the economy."
Ask_Politics,3difcb,BKGPrints,9,Fri Jul 17 02:22:14 2015 UTC,"For the United States, when the national debt is figured it also includes all long-term obligations (Social Security, Medicare, veteran benefits, federal employee benefits, etc.).  This accounts for almost 30% of the national debt, so while significant it isn't exactly due the next day and it is manageable for now.  Foreign investors (this doesn't necessarily mean foreign governments) account for about another 30%.  What this means is that foreign businesses, banks, investors and yes, even foreign governments have loaned money to the United States government in return for a dividend (basically interest) so that there's return on their money.  The reason is because usually the United States government is one of the safest risk in the world because it pays the interest on the money borrowed.  As long as the United States pays its interest & debts, the national debt is again manageable.  Now, the greatest portion of the debt (40%) is owed to...basically ourselves.  This can include the Federal Reserve, banks, businesses, investors, pension plans, savings bonds...even state & local governments.  Again, besides the Federal Reserve (which serves another purpose) the reason why is because the United States government is one of the safest risks for investments and provides a decent return on average.   Obviously the U.S. has a lot of debt, probably close to $20 trillion now.   The biggest problem with the national debt being at $20 trillion is because of the large national deficits from 2009 to 2014.  On average, it added almost $1.2 trillion every year to the national debt.   Is this just absolutely terrible, or is it expected and manageable due to the size and prosperity of our country?   Back to the national deficit.  When the government is spending more than revenue (basically taxes) bring in, it has to borrow the rest to maintain its obligations.  A small (relatively) deficit isn't necessarily bad but when the deficit exceeds the revenue by a 1/3 of revenue, then it can become a problem."

Can you imagine how much easier it would have been to get it under control when it was $8 trillion, instead of pushing it up another trillion or two every year since?  Most of the answers here say that it's not a big deal, nothing to worry about, it's normal, it's not as bad as it could be, yada yada yada. But what you have to realize is that in order to get it under control, hard choices are going to have to be made. The debt is currently at a level where simple revenue increases, unless they are monstrously huge (and therefore impossible--there just isn't enough wealth to tax), cannot solve the problem alone. Massive spending cuts will have to be made.  The biggest issue going forward is the unfunded liabilities (at the bottom of the clock there). These include Social Security and Medicare, but also pensions and other similar programs. These are at $97 trillion. That is insane. If you have any illusions about Social Security being around by the time you retire (assuming you're ~20-30), then you should see a psychiatrist. It is absolutely impossible for us to keep that program going under present conditions. Part of the reason is because of mistakes made decades ago, but our aging population and low workforce participation only exacerbate the problem.  Someone else pointed out that your question is mostly economic, not political. And that is true. But the political component is absolutely there, because it is politics that will drive those tough choices. Someone's favorite program is going to have to go. We just can't afford for everything to continue and to keep expanding.   Look back at the debt clock again. See how ""US Federal Spending"" has gone up 108% since 2000? Now do you see how ""US Federal Tax Revenue"" has only gone up 63%? That's a problem. A big one. Keynesian fanatics will tell you that deficit spending is necessary and isn't a big deal. But it can't go on forever. At some point, revenue needs to increase at a much larger rate than spending. And the more you push revenue up, the less people have to spend on goods. And I hate to break it to everyone, but government spending does not have a magical economic stimulus effect unless private spending is also driven by it. And that's not something that we're seeing right now."

It's insane in the same was as saying ""I have to pay $300,000 on my mortgage, and I only make $3,000 a month! What am I going to do??!"" is insane.   Well... you have a 30 year mortgage, so you're going to pay it incrementally over 30 years at about $1500/month, and you're going to make more next year than you made this year.   That $97 trillion is going to be paid over at least 50 years, and we're going to be bringing in more money every year whether we raise taxes or not.  Over the past 50 years, US revenue has increased from (in 2009 dollars) $1.07 trillion in 1970, to $1.77 trillion in 1994, to $2.8 trillion in 2014.  Almost a 300% increase over 50 years adjusted for inflation. It's not unreasonable to think that without raising taxes, the US will be pulling in $7.3 trillion in 2009 dollars by the time the last bit of those liabilities are being paid.

But that is much, much harder than it sounds. Don't you remember the uproar when the President proposed to change Social Security over to a chained CPI model?

And benefits for retired federal employees and veterans make up 8%. Together, all of those programs comprise 67% of our national budget.   Compare that to 50 years ago, and when we spent 23% of our budget on Social Security/Unemployment, 1% on Medicare and other health programs, and 5% on veterans benefits. In the 50 years since 1965, we've gone from spending 29% of our budget on these programs to spending 67%.   That percentage will only increase in the next 50 years. Especially considering the expansion of Medicaid in the states, which is being reimbursed by federal dollars.   Cutting any of these programs will piss off millions of people. And you're saying ""it's not that hard... we just have to do it""? How?

As for ""percentage of budget in 1965.."" that was the height of the Vietnam War.  Defense spending was 42% then, compared to 17% now (or almost 7% of GDP then to 3.5% now).

Switching to a universal healthcare system, especially one such as single payer which reduces costs, would save us money   People keep saying this as if it were a certain fact.  But how exactly would you actually save money?  There really are only three ways by converting to a single payer - remove all the profit/overhead from the system, cut access to services or cut reimbursement for those services.  The first is an obvious one, but probably not enough to really make a dent since Medicare/Medicaid/TriCare are already a significant portion of the medical spend in the US - Medicare alone is 20% and Medicaid another 15% (same source).  That's more than total health insurance spend (33%).  Also, the ACA required insurers to have a medical loss ratio of, at minimum, 85% (that is, 85% of premiums must be spent on claims and only 21% can go to overhead/advertising/profit).  Assuming every private insurer is exactly at 80% (which would represent the most profit/waste under the law and because it also assume there might be some additional saving from removing all the overhead and because in 2007 it was 81%), we'd only be reducing spending by 6.6% at most.  Still using that same link, that's a savings of only $660 per person.  That's significant, but nowhere near enough to bring costs down.  And that's at a maximum.  But for the sake of argument, lets say it can bring it down $1k per person.  That's not insigificant, but that's not bringing the US down to European-levels.  To bring us down to the Netherlands we need a reduction of 25%.  So where does this extra 15% come from?  From there, the only way to get there is to reduce service or reduce reimbursement - otherwise known as ""rationing care"".  And that means telling Americans that they need to lower their expectations.  That's not going to go over really well."

Ask_Politics,3di3ph,2225,6,Thu Jul 16 13:27:55 2015 UTC,"So I alternatively don't know too much about Germany's current situation. Ireland was a unique case. Many people in the lead-up and aftermath questioned why, and whether it was a good thing, to have a vote on it at all—largely on the same line you heard a lot in the US against same-sex marriage bans in states because rights shouldn't be voted on.   In Ireland, when the new coalition government was formed that was openly and seriously considering same-sex marriage law, there was a pretty big (among policy and legal circles anyway) on whether or not the Constitution needed to be amended. The Irish Constitution is very extensive and very important to the state. It doesn't however, unlike many constitutional limitations to gay marriage, explicitly define marriage as being between a man and a woman. The most commonly referred to article being Article 41: ""The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of marriage, on which the family is founded, and to protect it against attack."" Many argued that this should, and even must include same-sex marriages. Others argued the opposite, arguing that it mandated the institution of marriage be preserved and protected from attack in changing it.   Anywho, end of the day argument leads to an understanding that to introduce gay marriage in Ireland, a constitutional amendment would be required which would then require a national referendum. It wasn't so much a choice but rather a legal requirement for a very unique situation regarding the interpretation and process for changing Ireland's Constitution.  Honestly, despite the process being heralded as a sign of progress among the public, it isn't the most preferred way just for that very same reason that it was hard and involved putting the rights of others up to a popular vote. Obviously a legislative change can but an uphill battle, as is a judicial challenge but those are more representative of rights being guaranteed by the state, especially judicial.   tl;dr: I don't know about German law so maybe I'm wrong, but Ireland had a pretty unique and confusing situation that required a referendum—a method not preferred by many  The whole process around the world makes it increasingly interesting to see how many governments and legal systems that at a glance seem quite similar have to take so many different routes. You have America's rather unique strong states but still with final federal judicial rule. Ireland's strong constitutional stance. France's legislative turn and rhetoric that resulted from both sides. Mexico's current similar state-split status.     Now from my very limited understanding of the situation in Germany– The Constitutional Court there has made a few rulings regarding LGBT rights and, in response, the legislature has passed legislation to meet the (often really bare bare minimum) requirements to comply. Various groups have introduced full equality (or really even some things on full adoption and tax rights etc) and failed; largely in the name of protecting coalition negotiations.   The overwhelming majority of Germany does poll saying they support gay marriage, even in parties where support is weaker (Merkel's CDU, for instance, still polls at around 2/3rds in support.) So I genuinely wonder why. Some considerations I would make: 1) As far as I know, Germany is still markedly Christian, I would argue still a majority. 2) How are the minority populations that are against distributed? Concerning the failing votes that have taken place, how have different federal states voted with respect to how their individual state populations poll? 3) How important is the issue to most Germans? German has a lot on its plate right now regarding economic policy and the future of its role in Europe. It may be that many people will continue voting in coalition governments that come out against gay marriage if it means voting for support of other policies they find more important."
Ask_Politics,3di3ph,ridersderohan,4,Thu Jul 16 14:02:03 2015 UTC,The answer is pretty simple: Because the constitution does not allow popular vote on single issues on federal level (with the only exception of reshaping states).

Additionally, I could not comment on if there are constitutional provisions for a referendum in Germany (though I'm not sure how the Irish prcoess worked).  Democracy (though democracy is an open-ended term with many different meanings) in this context means an election for politicians based on their ideological positions to vote the way that they said they would. Therefore, Merkel has a mandate to oppose Same Sex Marriage as long as she still wins elections.  The problem is that people may agree with Merkel on other issues, but passively disagree on this one. Ergo why her view may be in the minority while she still wins, which some would cite as a problem with Representative Democracy as an institution. There is no real way to fix it, it's just a structural existence. Hence why referendums happen, but Germany may not have the institutions to do so (like how the USA can't federally).  Additionally, opponents of same sex marriage aren't going to usually call for a referendum on the issue when the status quo benefits them, as it does Merkel. She wants to keep it illegal, a referendum would needlessly risk that in her opinion.

Twenty-six amendments have been enacted since the Constitution first came into operation. Controversial amendments have dealt with such topics as abortion, divorce, and the European Union.  In the Irish Constitution, it said that marriage was between a man & a woman (albeit not in those exact words). The Oireachtas wanted change, they passed it & sent it to the people. The people wanted it, & barring any of the court challenges against the result being upheld, the President will most likely sign it by the end of September (assuming the High Court rules in favor of the vote & the petitioners appeal) & at the latest by the end of 2017 (w/ court challenges being upheld).

Assuming the economy picks up again after, it would reason that the country would go back to more spending.  Now I don't know much about political parties from outside the U.S. so the closest thing I can think of in terms of parties is republican, but only because individuals in it are more likely to think that way.    There may be some type of economic thought similar to this, but from what I have seen most people advocating for conservative economic policy for a depression basically advocate it for everything.  However, there's a branch of economics called Keynesian economics and to simplify it beyond belief, it is basically the opposite of what you are describing.  Spend to boost the economy during depression, and try to pay off some debt when the economy is doing well."

(If Saudi and Iraq are energy giants, what does that make Iran?) All along, the great expense and high risk of a nuclear energy program in Iran — prone to lots of seismic activity and earthquakes — really doesn't make sense for a state that's sitting on a pile of oil and gas, and is already a top producer of crude oil.  The development of a nuclear arsenal makes considerably more sense to many analysts, especially considering that their nuclear program's development commenced when the US was occupying neighboring Iraq and Afghanistan. The warming of relations between the US and Iran is likely a key point in the progress of a nuclear deal — Iran wants to know that the US accepts the regime and isn't supporting regime change in Iran."

If they can reduce the amount of refined petroleum products they import they will be less susceptible to outside pressures, which is something any country would want. Unlike with oil, they would control the process for nuclear energy from mining to refining and not be reliant on outside interests.

Furthermore, the former president of Iran, Ahmadinejad, was a rather jingoistic figure that frequently called for the destruction of Israel, supposedly through nuclear means. Finally, there was significant intelligence that Iran was both attempting to create and acquire through other means nuclear material suitable for making nukes.

The US certainly doesn't want Iran to get the weapons, if only because the Israel lobby would absolutely slaughter any politician that allowed it (Netanyahu has already criticized this deal as not going far enough). But with the sanctions having their intended effect, Iran has been under pressure to alleviate them for a while (they've been suffering with obscenely high inflation and chronic unemployment for decades now), and the entry of a reformist government was the opening the US was looking for to start settling the nuclear issue permanently, and hopefully encourage a rapprochement between the two sides."

Say what you will about American foreign policy, but having a hegemonic situation in the world is much more stable than having multiple competing great powers, and maintaining the greatest military power in the world is how we create the former situation. Historically, we had Pax Romana, Pax Britannica and now we have Pax Americana.

Ask_Politics,3df6jv,cran_daddyurp,10,Wed Jul 15 20:08:05 2015 UTC,"First of all, the deal was not praised except from right wing Americans and Israelis. There are about 12 Democratic Senators on the fence about it, or opposed to it. These will be the crux of the strategy to stop the deal, with a veto-proof majority. It's going to be a very close thing, it seems.  Many Americans don't really support crucial aspects of the deal. There are fluctuations in support, but it seems as the deal gets closer and more salient on which issues exist and arguments are heard on both sides of the issue, support turned against it. An AP-GfK poll done last week, Thursday to Monday, found people wanting a diplomatic relationship with Iran by a slim majority. But over 77% thought sanctions should stay the same or increase. This poll didn't ask about whether they would be removed in exchange for a deal, however. For that, you can look at this poll, which said 55% of Americans don't trust Iran at all and many trust Iran ""a little"" to follow through on a deal. 58% of registered voters said they don't believe Iran will abide by any deal.  So really, it's not like people are shouting from the rooftops in some areas and not in others. After all, the country is not majority-Republican. Even if the majority of Republicans from the bulk of naysayers, there is a significant Democratic portion of the country who doesn't trust Iran at all, and much of the Democratic portion of the country doesn't trust Iran ""a lot"".  As for problems with the deal, from Israel's perspective (I wrote this up in response to a comment that was deleted).  1) It releases over $100 billion in Iranian assets (up to $150 billion), equal to 20% of Iran's GDP. For the US, that percent of our GDP would be enough to fund our government for a year or so, roughly $3 trillion. That's a pretty damn big sum.  2) Israel knows that some, if not most of that money is going to groups dedicated to Israel's destruction: Hezbollah, Hamas, and groups like those. Tens of millions already go their way each year, and now they'll have even more to play around with.  3) The deal allows inspection periods that are very, very long. Israel doesn't trust these inspections, which can take 24 days or more before Iran has to allow an inspector into a suspicious site. So not only is it difficult to find these sites (Iran hid for a long time the Fordow site), it would take 24 days to inspect it from the time of the first request/suspicion being submitted. As Israel poignantly put it, you might as well give a drug dealer 24 days to clean up his lab before you show up.  4) Even if this wasn't a big deal, it's a real step down from where it was. Iran's nuclear infrastructure is still going to be up and running. It'll get the arms embargo lifted in 5 years, at which point it'll have access to more weapons to hand off to Hamas and Hezbollah and the like. It'll get the ICBM parts embargo lifted in 8 years, at which point it can begin making rockets that can hit Israel more easily. In 10-15, almost all restrictions will be gone, its economy will have largely if not entirely recovered, and it will be a threshold nuclear state, able to make a bomb within a few months or less. And during the waiting period, after a few years, it'll be able to research advanced centrifuges necessary for weapons building.  5) Iran also gets the ability to research these centrifuges, but without repercussions for past actions. It previously researched nuclear weapons according to intelligence reports, though it never made the decision to pursue them. But it will not have to reveal anything about this according to the deal, it can avoid showing just how far its lies went, and Israel doesn't like that because it helps Iran cover over its past and repeat it by maintaining the knowledge it gained without problems.  This is not just about ""basing policy in their favor"". It's about a serious threat to Israeli lives. There are 100,000 rockets on Israel's northern border, ready to fire at Israel via Hezbollah, Iran's proxy. Should the Syria war end, Hezbollah will be able to quickly recuperate and attack Israel. Should it decide to pump up its recruitment by fighting Israel, it can do so easily, and replenish its stocks more easily with the increased Iranian aid. And worst of all, if it does launch war, Iron Dome will be less effective by far. Not only would Hamas likely join in, but Iron Dome can't stop that many rockets being launched quickly. Furthermore, Hezbollah has hidden these rockets in civilian areas, as most terrorist organizations do, so Israel will take significant diplomatic heat for defending itself. It's just not so simple."

Ask_Politics,3dbylv,Cdr_Obvious,4,Wed Jul 15 03:36:16 2015 UTC,"Tennessee has no provisions for state legislator impeachment. Here are some other options:   Write their cameral party leader (Speaker, Maj. Leader, Min. Leader, etc.) and leadership team (Speaker Pro Tem, Floor Leader, Whip, etc.) and ask them to bar your legislator from caucus. You may also ask them to remove them from any committee chair positions or committee seats. These are things that most legislature leadership teams have the ability to do. If you identify with their party, voluntarily and/or financially support their primary opponent. If you don't, voluntarily and/or financially support their general opponent. Write letters to the editor for local media explaining their wrongdoing (as far as you are concerned). This can put some heat on them, possibly leading to their resignation. Note: Be careful. If you pursue this option, you're playing against a politician in a politician's game.   Impeachment aside, I know the legislator you're speaking of based on your description. To be fair, he hasn't said anything that is far from normal tea party conservative rhetoric. I don't know if pursuing impeachment will be fruitful if a Republican has already won your district. It's likely another Republican (with different, yet similar thoughts) will take the seat in a special election or by gubernatorial appointment, depending on what your state constitution provides for."
Ask_Politics,3dbylv,Ruthless__Pragmatism,3,Wed Jul 15 04:53:25 2015 UTC,"If the local and state media doesn't know about it/hasn't covered it, they should be informed and encouraged to do so. Letters to the editor specifically naming the legislator can help get a little attention and pressure.  Protests/demonstrations outside his district office could get attention and make a statement, maybe get some action.  You should definitely look up the requirements for recalling a legislator. At least in my state, recall petitions need to have a certain percentage of signatures based on the number of registered voters in a district. You need to find out the rules for your state and how many signatures you need.   The hardest part will come next - finding people to help circulate the petitions for signatures. If enough people are ticked off and you move with some urgency, that problem could be overcome.   After that, just follow the rules, and if you collect a substaintial amount but not enough for the recall threshold, publicizing that number of signatures could get a result. Also, aim for 20% more signatures than you need - this will help cover any errors (like a signature from someone who thought they were eligible to sign but actually weren't for some reason).  Good luck!"

The only near-exception is the budget: at least in recent years, the president will draft a proposal budget and pass it on to Congress. However, this is unofficial (as budget committees also draft budget proposals, and the president's proposal is not directly acted upon) and any official budgets must start in the House.

Ask_Politics,3daql3,congressional_staffr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:44:27 2015 UTC,"The first line from your House link:   The House on Wednesday handily rejected a GOP budget alternative based on President Obama's 2015 spending blueprint.   Your own article makes the same point I'm making. Sure, the House and the Senate can draft budget resolutions identical to the president's proposal. But it is always the case that both chambers only ever vote on their own things.  Here is a good video explaining the budget process, but I'll transcribe the relevant bit:   The president has two jobs when it comes to money: 1. Collect taxes 2. Spend those taxes to run the government. This might give you the impression that the president, with regards to money, is all-powerful. Especially when you hear news reports on 'the president's new budget' or his plan to 'raise taxes on haberdashers' or 'lower taxes on apiarists'.  But reality is just the opposite and the president is the one who takes orders. From whom? Congress. Congress has the jobs of setting the tax level and determining how much the government will spend by writing a budget.    So while the president does get to submit budgets to congress, and asks for changes in the tax level, these are just requests that congress doesn't have to pay attention to.   I realize that this is a semantic point, which is probably where the confusion comes from. The president does not have the ability to drop legislation in the hopper. The budget process, as important as the president's proposal budget may be, is not an exception to this rule."

The most salient is media - he's only a known commodity to high-information voters, which are disproportionately wealthy.  The longer hours you work, the more you have to scrap to keep the lights on and food on the table, the less time you have to read the Huffington Post.  Beyond that, there's also the chasm between rich progressives and poor progressives.  Rich progressives are the ones sitting around talking about how much better things are in Europe, generally the guys who have plenty but want more (not strictly selfishly, but there's a level of abstraction only afforded by wealth).  Bernie Sanders speaks their language - he's a guy talking about poverty from a state where there's almost no poverty.  And while the ideas he's advocating would, in their own right, probably be popular amongst the far-less wealthy (which includes a disproportionate chunk of the minority population), there's always been a communication gap because a lot of it sounds like you're talking down to the poor.    That's not his main problem, and I imagine if he made a concerted effort to tap into the black and Hispanic political establishments (from Chicago, if he could do some events with Gutierrez and Bobby Rush) he'd do pretty well.

Look up Youtube Crash Courses, and watch the ones on politics, the first couple would probably tell you the basics of what you need to know.  You're in the district office. The majority of your work won't be on things like legislative affairs, government business, etc.. You'll spend time answering phones, some of them from crazy people. Many will be calling because they need help with:  1) Immigration services, if you're close to a border.  2) Veteran benefits, because the VA is slow sometimes.  3) Wanting the congressman to support XYZ.  Usually, your office will have caseworkers who are assigned to each topic, or they'll have caseworkers more generally who can handle each thing. Ask around, if you don't get a list. Learn to transfer calls to the caseworkers. Make sure before you do that you screen the call: ask what the person's name is, ideally ask for an address to check that they're in your district (if not, then refer them to whoever is in their district, you can check addresses online, just google it), and get down the basic information. Then pass it along, and go on about your day.  If someone calls in asking about wanting the congressman to support something, do not say he will or will not unless this is a clearly articulated position on his/her website. Even then, try to stay away from it. You don't want to lie to a constituent while you're representing the office of a congressperson. Just say that you appreciate their concerns/ideas, that you will pass the message along to the legislative assistants, etc. etc.. Make them feel heard, and be polite, even if they are not. And, if your office has a way to actually take note of these things, make use of it. Mine have. The Congressperson may actually care, contrary to what some believe.  If you need something to do, don't be afraid to ask. If you don't know how to do something, don't be afraid to ask. An internship is not just for your resume, it's for you to learn. You get to learn how the office functions, what running it is like, etc.. All of this is useful for future experience in offices, and also for politics if you ever go that route. So learn, and don't be afraid or ashamed for asking. Just do your best to learn the processes. Carry around a notepad if you don't have a solid photographic memory (few do), and jot down basic instructions so you don't have to ask all the time about the same tasks.  Again, don't worry yourself so much. Some days, you'll do things like drawing maps in Google Maps for which group of interns will canvass X area with flyers, and which will canvass Y or Z area. Some days you'll just be packaging materials for an event. Some days you'll research a law on Google, and see what people are saying about it both positively and negatively. You might help out with some case work, drafting a letter (with help, of course). You'll sort the mail and open emails. You can maybe make a pamphlet or briefing book/memo to help the Congressperson learn about a certain issue, but again this just takes basic google research most of the time, and that's fairly rare.  It's going to be fairly self-explanatory. Just don't be afraid to ask. Most of the interns in my experience don't know anything about anything. Some are in high school and think that it takes 2/3 of the House voting in favor of a bill to pass it. You're not alone, and what separates the good from the bad is their willingness to be confident and ask when they need it, and learn quickly.  If you have more questions, let me know. I'd be happy to share my experiences in district offices."

If someone calls in asking about wanting the congressman to support something, do not say he will or will not unless this is a clearly articulated position on his/her website.   I'd say an intern should absolutely never provide any answer other than ""I'll pass that along"", short of the Congressman already being on the bill they want him to cosponsor, or having voted yes on the specific bill (not a prior version of said bill) they want him to vote yes on (constituents aren't always timely with their requests for votes/cosponsorships).

""The Congressman is still reviewing that legislation. Can I pass along your concerns?"")  As an intern, the #1 way you will impress staff such that they will (1) remember your name in a year, and (2) do so in a good way and not a, ""boy, that intern was an idiot"" way, starting on day one, is good telephone demeanor.  That's it.  The rest is icing.  But if you're competent on the phones, you'll be respected.    You do not say anything regarding policy on the phone that you have not been explicitly told you can say (generally in the form of talking points from the LD, Chief, or Comms Director).

Ask_Politics,3d43pb,atigges,12,Mon Jul 13 10:49:50 2015 UTC,"VP choices usually boil down to one thing - balancing the ticket. Balancing the ticket usually looks at geographical balance, specific traits of the candidate (age, gender, race), gaining favor/support in an important state, gaining favor/support with an important bloc of voters.  Hillary is more of a national candidate and isn't super pinned down to one geographical area (other than being a DC insider) so the campaign won't really focus on a geographic balance. She is an older white female with broad support from Democratic and Independent female voters. Senator Sanders being who he is, doesn't exactly help check off any of those boxes. He's from Vermont - a small, liberal, Northeastern state. He's an older white male. He doesn't particularly help with any important swing states (Iowa, Nevada, Ohio, Florida) or with any important bloc of voters - with one small exception...one of the problems Hillary has is that there is kind of a lack of excitement surrounding her campaign and most of the young, energetic, grassroots supporters are hyping Senator Sanders. I'm not saying there aren't large groups within the Democratic Party and activists that are excited for Hillary, but there is more a fervency surrounding Senator Sanders and you normally want that to be reserved for the candidate at the top of the ticket.  Ideally for me, the best VP choice would be Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro. He's a young Hispanic male who has a toe-hold in a future important state (Texas). He has a relatively low national profile, which is great for the Democratic Party and Hillary campaign because he can be somewhat molded into a great running mate in 2016 and a Presidential candidate for 2024. If Hillary is seen as too liberal, he can be the more conservative voice and vice versa. His ethnicity will help potentially secure the Hispanic voting bloc (one of the fastest and ""swingiest"" voting blocs in the nation) and will help with voter turnout in Florida, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico and other states with growing/large Hispanic populations.  Democrats have traditionally fallen in line a bit better (at least in the recent past) than the Republican Party (which is currently having major ideological splits). This means that the Hillary campaign is less concerned about the Progressive elements in the Party not voting for Hillary - that's not to say Sanders won't still play a role for the Hillary campaign. They will work hard to get him to endorse Hillary and to stump for her on college campuses and in liberal cities. I wouldn't be surprised if he gets placed in her cabinet (Secretary of Labor maybe? EPA Chair?).  It's also important to note that VP candidates rarely do much to spectacularly help a ticket and usually have a bigger chance of hurting the campaign (Sarah Palin)."

Ask_Politics,3d43pb,Arthur_Edens,2,Mon Jul 13 15:11:15 2015 UTC,"While I agree with your assessment, I would caution what these labels mean. On economic issues Bernie is to the left, more in tune with an older democratic president in the mold of LBJ and FDR. On social issues I think he is also left-of-center but in topics like gun rights he is pretty moderate. I think there is a big problem with this whole ""moderate""/""swing voters"" fallacy that the pundits say you have to win over. Its mostly about turnout as Republicans have figured out long time ago, that and convincing formally left white southerns to vote Republican. When voters are given a ""New Democrat"", i.e. a Clinton neo-liberal versus a moderate republican as the options it's definitely all about turnout and enthusiasm (voting laws making it difficult for poor and racial minorities to vote not withstanding). Yes Sanders is the most liberal Senator- but Dennis Kucinich was arguably more liberal. Sanders also is pretty plain-spoken and less-politician like than other candidates which is attractive to people."
Ask_Politics,3d43pb,mellowizz,7,Mon Jul 13 16:58:32 2015 UTC,"Swing voters aren't a fallacy; they're very much a real thing, and they come in many different stripes.    Whether you're running for city council or president, campaigners usually break voters down into:  1 'Strong Us,'   2 'Leaners toward us',   3 'swing voters,'   4 'lean them,' and   5 'strong them.'   They then create different strategies to raise money from 1s, excite 2s, convince 3s to swing their way, and convince 4s to stay home (4 is why negative ads exist, even though everyone hates them).  You pretty much ignore 5s, because anything you say to them will probably just excite them and make them more likely to vote.   Sanders' wouldn't be a great asset to Hillary as VP because he would probably increase the turnout of 4s (lean GOP) and push any non-socialist 3s toward the GOP nominee.  In exchange, Hillary would get any socialists/Greens who otherwise would stay at home.   The problem with that is that a swing voter is worth two base voters.  If you lose a base voter from being too centrist, they stay home (or vote 3rd party, effectively the same thing) and you are -1 from where you were before.  But if that same centrist move pulls one swing voter who was leaning toward the other guy to you, you're +2 from where you were before.    It works both ways, so if you're trying to win an election purely by firing up the base, you're going to need 2 far left voters who would have otherwise stayed home for every 1 moderate who you chase over to the GOP.  The demographic numbers in the US just don't add up for that."

Sanders would hate it, he'd be terrible at it, and he can stay Senator from Vermont as long as he wants. He likes that job.   So, Clinton could ask - although she won't - but he would say no.  Edit: A bigger danger for Clinton is that she has to win ugly, in which case Sanders might not even endorse her - and if his base remains enamored of him, they would be pissed off - and might stay home on election day.

Clinton was one of the most liberal members during her time in the Senate.

She was more liberal than 85 percent of all members. Her 2008 rival in the Democratic presidential primary, Barack Obama, was nearby with a record more liberal than 82 percent of all members — he was not more liberal than Clinton.  Clinton also has a history of very liberal public statements. Clinton rates as a “hard core liberal” per the OnTheIssues.org scale. She is as liberal as Elizabeth Warren and barely more moderate than Bernie Sanders. And while Obama is also a “hard core liberal,” Clinton again was rated as more liberal than Obama.  Sometimes I wonder whether people are confusing Clinton with her husband. Bill Clinton’s statements have been far more moderate.

Ask_Politics,3d0xp4,Mrubuto,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:58:03 2015 UTC,"Basically it would be whatever the government that's paying for it decided to pay them.  You need to think about the role price plays in distribution systems.   You have x of something, and x + y people want one.  As you increase the price the number of people who want it enough to pay the price drops, until you get to a point where only x people want one.  It's way more complex than that, but that's the idea.  So if you make college free you're removing the ability of people to demonstrate wanting it more than others based on price, and as such you're also eliminating a primary motive for making a superior college (as it doesn't matter whether there's demand for it anymore, as the people consuming it no longer have a means of demonstrating higher levels of demand).  In the end, the systems have to develop harder means of power to control the output, and the consumers pretty much just get what they're given.  Think about public schools, you have school boards, PTAs and whatnot, but beyond that you're more or less stuck with whatever's there."

First, clearly this will happen at the community college level. That should increase demand for community college services. Those colleges will be looking for people to teach classes.   Now, today, most community colleges don't require a PhD to teach many classes. If that remains the case you'll see an increase in demand for masters degrees. If we see the feds put a requirement for a PhD to teach at the community college level as a condition of getting their money (like the whole ""highly qualified"" bit with no child left behind) things get interesting.   If that happens you suddenly have a sponge to soak up the over production of PhDs we have coming out of some of the liberal arts programs (not to pick on those, but they're less employable than, say, STEM PhDs). That will help to stabilize the grad school situation for a while. Moreover since no one much wants to teach at community colleges if prestigious four year programs are within reach, you'll see increasing competition in PhD programs as they expand to feed the community college system.   This will, of course, come with growth in the student loan world as well, as students over extend themselves to attempt to gain a toe hold in the more prestigious four year college world."

I'm assuming that's what you mean, and to put it simply, I would say that the US has remained the dominant power in the world by a long shot and would have remained so no matter who was in charge for the last eight years.   The greatest change in world power during Obama's time in office would be the growing clout of China, which obviously he had no control over or significant impact on. While China became a dominant economic power a while back, there have been a number of significant changes in the last ten years or so that signify that China is no longer just a giant factory, but a growing international political force that will eventually compete with the US for the dominant spot in the world. China's shift from an investment to consumption economy (still ongoing, it should be noted), while partially responsible for the economic slump there, was a necessary step and signifies a growing economic maturity and a governmental recognition that keeping its people satisfied domestically is key. This is further reinforced by the current Chinese government's new ideology of the Chinese Dream, a clear antithesis to American cultural influence and an attempt to create a more unified nation to stand against America's international ""liberal conensus"".   China has also been pushing a more aggressive foreign policy, challenging America's dominance in both international monetary institutions (establishing its own international investment fund to compete with Western dominated groups like the IMF and World Bank) and seeking to take back what it sees as its own rightful political backyard in southeast Asia with an increasingly aggressive foreign policy.   I apologize for the tangent, I suppose I wanted to make a point.

As someone said before, economic instability and a lack of hope for improvement is tinder for social unrest. We're already seeing the organization of neo-nazi groups and xenophobia growing in Greece. Much like Germany after WWI people are angry and desire a simple explanation for why things are so bad (sadly immigrants are a great scapegoat). Due to Greece's proximity to the middle east and the porous border between Turkey and Greece, Turkey and Syria. The threat of muslim extremists crossing over and wreaking havoc can be easily portrayed and exploited to motivate people against foreigners/muslims etc. We're already seeing semi-facist parties in mainland Europe use this rhetoric to rally people agains ""the other."" This could turn really ugly if reason is blinded by anger.  Europeans \ care a lot about unrest in Greece because it is at the door to the middle east and it's culturally representative of what it means to be ""european."" But more importantly it would signify a failure of the ""European Experiment."" The EU is like the formation of the US but at a snails pace and were starting to see people less and less eager for further unification. The recent debt crisis was induced because of partial unification (they took on the same currency, but didn't secede their finances to a central agency). So social unrest in Greece would only reinforce the trend away from unification.  Russia, now that's the wild card. They are great at playing the xenophobic card, there's already plenty of violence in Russia towards muslim/asian immigrants. I could easily see them supporting a neo-nazi/fascist party in Greece but they wouldn't move so overtly as they did in Ukraine. Greece is well within the European ""sphere of influence"" and moving troops in there could back-fire and actually unite Europe (the last thing Russia wants to do).  That's why Ukraine is more interesting to watch from a geo-political perspective. Is it a part of Europe or is it a part of the Russian-slavic sphere of influence?

That is how the public sector escalated out of control all these years, with huge spending and so many people ""working"" there not even the government knew the exact amount of people.  However, with the crisis all this stopped. Salaries became lower and the public sector stopped growing.

During Karamanlis PM times (2004-2009) there is evidence that there was a plan to destabilise Greece and murder the PM because of his approach with Russia. There are no proofs though.  Right now there is a real threat for riots. After 7 years of recession there is a need for further austerity and violent horizontal measures. Nazis and Communists get 15% combined and their share is expected to increase as the measures proceed and Syriza is wearing. If they somehow climb into power, democracy in Greece will take a good break.  European countries care. First, noone wants one million Greek immigrants fleeing into Germany, Italy and UK. Second, there are at least 100 German companies working in Greece, while other countries have their own investments here. Noone wants the value of the country to decrease dramatically and of course noone wants a collapse. Third, a Grexit would increase the interests for other European countries and especially for Italy. Fourth, for the first time a EU country will be threatened by a coup. Fifth, the bailout has to be viable and strict because this will maximise the return for EU loans (everyone knows that a debt restructuring will take place, everyone wants this to be as small as possible, so a smoothening of bailout terms is preferred to a strong social unrest that may send Greece into complete bankruptcy). Greece is also a key military component of Europe and its fighting capacity should be high (and its weapons purchasing power too). There are also other reasons why Europeans are afraid of social unrest in Greece but they seem to underestimate the ability of Greece to impose the bailout terms without causing unrest (especially with so many enemies). My guess is that the bailout plan will become less strict if some key goals are met quickly and social unrest seems to be rising, but not if no key goals are met.  I think that Russia played some cards in the Greek case already. There seems to be some kind of gentlemen's agreement, that Russia keeps eastern Ukraine in exchange for abandoning Greece and its plans for a new gas pipeline (Americans objected about the pipeline already, see Kumanovo events soon after Greece agreed with Russia on initiating discussions for the pipeline). The least known of the above should be taken with a pint of salt, they are hard to cross.  Right now Ukraine is perhaps more important (besides it is larger) but the small Greece is a vital part in EU's spine. It is next to Turkey, which is one of the most heavily armed countries in the world. Turkey is important for EU as well, since it helps in shielding away middle east and bypassing Russia for a more energy independent Europe. However, a Greek collapse would make EU turn its eyes away from Ukraine for a long time."

I am no expert on Greece, but from the outside, I'm not sure anyone would care, if not for its affiliations (Eurozone viz. economics and NATO viz. security).   So yes, European countries care, because Greek debt and default are affecting the fragile (some would say brutal) economic situation in every part of Europe that isn't Germany. The Euro is still good money, but its ability to match up on the dollar is hardly predictable. My view is that the (Western) European countries have well realized that economy binds them in ways that run deeper than politics or history. Nobody wants to have to say, ""so goes Greece, so goes this unified European economy."" But that does threaten to be the case...  As far as civil unrest? It depends what you mean. There is rioting-a-plenty in Athens and other cities, off and on, but the notion of some kind of insurgency or 'revolutionary' activity seems far off. Not that the situation isn't bad enough - it may well be with unemployment (and median age) where it currently is. The mush that is Greece on the world stage is a product of the fact that even the 'establishment' lacks the political maturity to step up to the plate in an international sense.  I am not Greek, and I've never been there. But the overwhelming feeling that I get when I put myself in one's shoes over there is disillusionment. So I might flip a car and burn it, but there is no chance of a cohesive or long-term sort of protest. Anger is different than civil unrest, and the former is easy to control with a 5.62 mm bullet.   Bottom line: Europe the wealthier will try hard to foster market stability by bailing out the Greeks, because it's in their own best interest.

Anyways, onto your points. Let's talk about comparative advantage first. I don't know how familiar you are with the concept, so I'll start from the beginning. The model was developed by the economist Ricardo in the early 19th century, who studied wine and cloth markets in Europe. He found that even in a situation where a nation is worse (both in absolute and comparative terms) at producing both wine and cloth compared to another nation, it is still beneficial for both to specialize and trade because of differing opportunity costs. In economics, opportunity cost refers to the next best option you give up when you make a decision. For example, if I spend a dollar on a candy bar, the opportunity cost could be spending that dollar one something else--and in the case of production, the opportunity cost of producing wine would the the cloth that could be produced with the same resources. A more thorough example can be found here, but the point is that since exact opportunity costs vary between nations, specialization and trade can benefit a nation even if it is very disadvantaged economically.   So how does this apply to the world today? Nations produce a lot more than wine and cloth, and besides this there is a lot more variation. And you are correct to say that, to a degree, many poor nations in the world have a comparative advantage in producing agricultural products or simple manufactured goods (textiles being the classic example). At the same time, the United States is endowed with certain conditions (good universities, high research output, highly developed physical and virtual infrastructure) that gives the US a big advantage in producing high-tech products as well as services and knowledge products (American universities and tech firms, including GE and the auto firms, put out a massive amount of research and new tech every year). Likewise we can look at a nation like Germany: by investing in manufacturing knowledge and education for over a century, the German economy is perhaps the world's most significant exporter of high-precision manufactured goods, which nations like China or India are simply not capable of producing in any significant quantity because they simply lack the endowment to do so.   Let's talk about tariffs now. So there's two points to this argument. Firstly, if a firm goes bankrupt after losing tariff protection, this likely means it was producing things inefficiently, costing all of its customers more money. This inefficiency can be massive in some cases, as in the case of the sugar market (Planet Money did a great podcast on this topic, and I'll be pulling some numbers from them. American sugar producers aren't especially efficient compared to, say, those in Brazil, but since imports are limited, it's been estimated that every American pays about $10 extra over a year for food. This may seem inconsequential, but when you realize that this comes out to $3 billion a year it becomes more clear what problem exists, especially since American sugar producers are a very small, insignificant part of the world market while Brazilian farmers are being hurt by this (and with less income, they can afford less American goods as well). Brazil even sued the US (and won) in international trade court for hurting its farmers.   The point is that when tariffs cause inefficiency in a market, you have a general loss of welfare in the economic sense. Can you imagine how many jobs would be created if every American had $10 extra a year? It may not seem like much, but when you have all these little inefficiencies across an entire economy it really starts to hurt. But what happens to the now obsolete workers? Well, the same thing that happened to weavers in the 18th century or agricultural laborers in the 19th--they just have to adjust. Capitalism is in a constant flux of what Schumpeter famously called creative destruction, which means that firms and industries are constantly being created and destroyed as the world changes. And this is not at all a bad thing: if we had banned textile mills in the 18th century to protect the weavers, or (even more dramatically) banned tractors in the 19th to protect agricultural laborers, I'm sure you can imagine what an awful world we would live in.   As for the fifth point, again it's a matter of comparative advantage. Firms that are inefficient in the US will shrink and that is fine, it boosts economic efficiency and more importantly, shifts American resources to producing what we are good at, namely anything high-tech, service or knowledge based.   Finally, the eighth point. People like to complain about the idea of efficiency because it sounds real scary, though it has to be kept in mind that economic efficiency (which does not necessarily mean cutting jobs or wages!) is something a bit different. For every bit of capital or labor being used inefficiently, it's not being used for something better. And it would be horribly inefficient to take a relatively educated society like that in the US, along with its infrastructure, universities and so on, and apply it to producing our own low-level manufactured goods and so on. As Ricardo's theorems suggested, it's better for everyone to outsource what others are better at doing, insource what we're better at doing, and trade the results. The economy isn't a zero-sum game, after all.  Also, keep in mind that it's to our advantage to see the poorer parts of the world to develop. Ignoring the political benefits of a better educated and more prosperous world (less wars, more international cooperation) and the influence of trade interdependence on relations (if two nations are big trading partners, they won't want to go to war with each other because of the damage it would do to each economy), richer neighbors are able to afford more of our own products. It could be argued that the trade deficit between us and China is a matter of them not being able to afford, on a large scale, the products we produce. But that is changing: last year, China sent a quarter million students to us, paying tuition and buying our products and services while they're here, while Chinese firms are increasingly looking for more skilled workers and their massive emerging middle class, largely a result of the wealth produced by producing and trading with other nations, looks for products to buy.  Like I said, let me know or drop in at the sticky thread if you have any other questions or clarifications. I'm glad you're reaching out to learn more, so good on you for that!"
Ask_Politics,3cptv2,haalidoodi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:12:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for responding.    I did have a somewhat decent understanding of comparative advantage (I work at a college and took MicroEcon last semester).  So I understand the concept of CA and how it is supposed to work.    There is a lot there and I feel I'm not too fit to respond to all of it just yet, but here is what I have so far.    academic consensus on NAFTA   I read through most of the link.  I understand that when economists look at overall benefit, they are looking at the benefit to each economy involved.  I, on the other hand, am only concerned with the US' economy.  I know that may sound insensitive, but that is what my concern is.    Even in the paper you link it says,    This literature has grown significantly over the past decade, and now there is a large body of evidence – but no consensus – about the economic effects of NAFTA on the three countries.    I think what they mean is that there is a lot of evidence of the affects of NAFTA, but there is not yet a definitive answer as to whether those affects were good or bad.  I still think it's safe to say that a net loss of almost 700,000 jobs for the US is bad for the US economy. (again, ignoring any benefits Mexico or Canada received)  I'm glad you posted areas that the US excels at and would have the CA in.  How many jobs can be created in those sectors and is it enough to compensate for the lost jobs in all of the sectors that the CA goes to another country?  Realistically how many people can work in those areas before they just can't hire any more people.  (slightly off-topic, how are we going to get more and more people into those higher skilled jobs if the price of education is too high for them to afford?)  Another thing that keeps grabbing my attention and what I keep getting hung up on is 'inefficiency'.  When I see that word I automatically assume it's related to regulations.  I'm having a hard time articulating the connection, but basically is it deemed inefficient because someone else can produce more of it cheaper?  If so are we looking at the reasons why they are able to produce the product cheaper?  Could it be that they are able to produce it at a lower cost because they have lower costs associate with labor?  Not just wages but overall compensation; healthcare and retirement.  Also what environmental/pollution regulations are they complying with?  Are they avoiding costs by not complying with environmental/pollution standards?    Basically when I hear that another country is able to produce something cheaper than us, I automatically assume it is because their workers aren't compensated as well as ours and that they are not ecologically friendly.      If I didn't respond to a specific section of your reply it doesn't mean I disagree with or agree with it, I just don't feel I can properly formulate and articulate a response to those sections.  Thanks again for responding, I really appreciate it."
Ask_Politics,3cptv2,haalidoodi,3,Thu Jul 9 22:24:07 2015 UTC,"I, on the other hand, am only concerned with the US' economy   I get the sentiment, it makes sense to support your own nation ahead of others. I do think it's important to keep in mind that by helping others, we help ourselves as well, as I noted in my original response. Poverty begets violence, ignorance, and all sorts of nasty things that do come back to affect us if we perpetuate it around the globe. And again, the wealthier other nations are the better customers they become for us.    there is not yet a definitive answer as to whether those affects were good or bad   That is unfortunately true for a lot of economics. We can't really run controlled experiments like in the natural sciences to disprove a null hypothesis, and since the world is such a complicated place, there are exceptions to even the hardest of economic laws. More importantly, it's difficult to establish causality, as in this case. Not only is it tenuous at best to say those 700,000 job losses were caused by NAFTA, but it is difficult to establish how many jobs were created by improved efficiency and lower consumer prices. I just hope you don't treat the number like Gospel, even if you do use it as one piece of evidence among others.   is it enough to compensate for the lost jobs in all of the sectors that the CA goes to another country?    Ignoring the impact of recessions, employment has been fairly stable as globalisation has significantly expanded over the last 70 years. The last number was around 5.5%, which is pretty close to what economists believe to be the natural rate. If this was a problem, you'd expect that nearly a century of expanding trade would have had an effect by now.   slightly off-topic, how are we going to get more and more people into those higher skilled jobs if the price of education is too high for them to afford?   The monetary benefits of a higher education still vastly outweigh the costs, so it's still perfectly affordable, though loans are an option more people will still be going for. But as the data shows, the premium on an education is still large enough to make it worth it even with an exorbitant amount of debt.    basically is it deemed inefficient because someone else can produce more of it cheaper? If so are we looking at the reasons why they are able to produce the product cheaper?   Almost, but not quite: economic efficiency means producing and selling something at the lowest cost, which doesn't necessarily translate to the cheapest price. External costs and benefits, that is, externalities (which I'm assuming you know about) also have to be taken into effect. If a process is cheaper but creates a lot of pollution for example, it would be less economically efficient after the costs of pollution are taken into account.   I automatically assume it's related to regulations   Not at all. While they play a role, they can actually promote economic efficiency if they reduce external costs or otherwise seek to internalize them.    I automatically assume it is because their workers aren't compensated as well as ours   It takes time for things to adjust, but ideally an equally skilled and educated worker anywhere in the world would make the same amount of money, once local infrastructure and government policy is taken into account. As you can see here, wages have risen enormously in China over the last decade or so, and this rise will only continue. Wages are generally a matter of supply and demand anyways, and the fact is that China, until recently, had a huge influx of migrant labor from its rural areas.    I automatically assume it is because their workers aren't compensated as well as ours and that they are not ecologically friendly   True at times, but keep the point about internalizing pollution costs in your mind, as well as the fact that a lot more goes into the production process than just the cost of labor. I'm sure you can use your imagination to think of things that would make production of a given good more efficient in one place than another: richer land and adequate water for agriculture, good electrical supply and access to ports for low-level manufacturing and so on."
Ask_Politics,3cptv2,haalidoodi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:28:01 2015 UTC,"The last number was around 5.5%   You are quoting the U-4 measure which only looks at Total unemployed plus discouraged workers, as a percent of the civilian labor force plus discouraged workers.  The real unemployment rate includes persons marginally attached to the labor force who currently are neither working nor looking for work but indicate that they want and are available for a job and have looked for work sometime in the past 12 months, discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached, who have given a job-market related reason for not currently looking for work, and persons employed part time for economic reasons who want and are available for full-time work but have had to settle for a part-time schedule. Otherwise known as the U-6 measure on the same chart, which is actually 10.5% as of June.    I think a lot of those other subsets are displaced workers who have lost their jobs; whether or not the reason they lost their jobs can be attributed to trade agreements remains unclear.     The monetary benefits of a higher education still vastly outweigh the costs,   I don't think the link you posted really proves that.  ""A college graduate is likely to earn $570,000 more than a high school graduate over a lifetime"", yes but how much are they paying in interest on their loans?  And the fees because it took them more than 6 months to find a decent paying job? (because there is an extremely competitive job market right now, due to the high unemployment rate).  Is a college graduate able to save more than a HS graduate?  How long does it take for a college grad to buy a house compared with a HS grad?    It seems that the link you posted acts mainly as a pitch to sell 529's as a good idea.  I'm not saying they aren't a good idea, just that that particular article has no relevance to and does not support the claim ""The monetary benefits of a higher education still vastly outweigh the costs"".     economically efficient after the costs of pollution are taken into account.   Does the equation that determines economic efficiency include full labor compensation?  (i.e. healthcare and retirement)  If it does, could it be that the countries that are the most economically efficient are the ones that pay the lowest wages and provide little to no benefits to their workers?  Also are those workers being treated fairly?  Do they work more than 8 hours a day?  40 hours a week? 5 days a week?    I'll admit I forgot to think about externalities and internalized vs externalized costs.  However the more and more we get into this, the more it seems that 'economics' does really concern itself with worker treatment.  Of course slave labor is more efficient than fair pay.     It takes time for things to adjust   I don't think the US can survive the amount of time needed for things to balance out.  As in, we already have high unemployment and I think if we continue to see the loss of jobs to countries that can do those jobs more efficiently we won't see enough new jobs created to replace those lost jobs, in the short-medium run that is.  So the unemployment rate is going to continue to get worse until it gets better. (And I think you may show me some trends showing that unemployment is on the decline.  Which is true, but we are currently considering at least one major trade agreement that may result in the loss of more jobs, so unless we get that unemployment rate down to an acceptable level then I think this new trade agreement is only going to hurt us more [getting into politics now: and the fact that this is happening right when a new president will be in office, he/she will most likely be blamed for rising unemployment rates during his/her tenure]).     Wages are generally a matter of supply and demand anyways   Our wages are already proven to be too low (as shown by so many people working 2 and 3 jobs, and well over 40 hours a week, just to scrape by), rising unemployment only creates a surplus of labor, driving wages down... what happens when wages go even lower and now not only can the unemployed not purchase goods, the employed don't make enough to purchase goods.  This will result in a decline in demand, thereby driving prices for the goods up. So the less people make, the more people are unemployed, the less people buy things and the more prices go up.    I don't know why China's wages are going up and I'm sure my last paragraph illustrates my ignorance on the topic (hello /r/badeconomics !), but what other compensation do Chinese workers get?  What are their hours like?  What is the pollution like in China?  (I kind of already covered these questions, no need to repeat them)  Anyways, like you said it is the unfortunate case of economics that it is too difficult to get decisive answers to questions like this.  It's also clear that the verdict is still up for discussion as economists are still arguing about this question. (I think? Unless of course it is unanimous, then it's just me) My final thoughts are that while I understand, to a degree, the concept of free-trade and why in theory it seems practical, I don't believe that it works in practice.  I may not have been successful in convincing anyone that it doesn't work, but I wasn't convinced that it does work and there has yet to be a definitive answer as to whether it does work in practice or not.  For the time being, I will continue to research it and try to convince myself the benefits of free-trade, but until such time I will align myself in the ""protectionism"" camp.    Thank you again for this wonderful discussion.  It's possible that I may look like a complete ignorant moron to some, but that is ok because I am still learning.  Maybe in the future (could be years, could be days) I will look back at this discussion and see my naivety.  For now though, I'm happy just to have been part of it. :)"

A group of nine of perhaps the most accomplished Constitutional academics in the nation, who have dedicated their entire lives to studying American law, and you have the nerve, not to mention the immaturity, to respond to a decision you don't understand with ""are they just retarded""?!   To answer your question, you'll recall from social studies in primary school that the job of the courts is to interpret laws, while the executive branch enforces it. The Supreme Court especially isn't supposed to take into account whether their actions ""will fail"" whatever that means (last I checked, all of our schools are integrated these days), but to decide the correct, legal and Constitutional way for law to be interpreted, at which point the burden of enforcement (and therefore the ""success"" or ""failure"" of their actions) is on the executive branch."

Ask_Politics,3cm52g,haalidoodi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:17:19 2015 UTC,"Oh good, you're a lot more adult than I thought you were. Your phrasing suggested that you were referring to the Supreme Court acting ""retarded"".   Anyways, there are two possible cases where I can see a state or municipality rationally choosing to defy a ruling. The first is a matter of enforcement: since the executive branch (a) has limited resources and (b) has some discretion on the degree to which laws are enforced, there may be times when rulings are not properly enforced by the Feds, leaving an opening for lesser entities to defy Federal rulings without suffering the consequences.   Secondly, they could be doing it simply on principle, which is the case more often. Everybody has certain things they would make a principled stance against, even if they knew they would lose. This is certainly true for me and, I imagine, for you as well. Defying a ruling can be somebody's last action of protest against something they see as fundamentally wrong."
Ask_Politics,3cm52g,haalidoodi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:25:14 2015 UTC,"Everybody has certain things they would make a principled stance against, even if they knew they would lose.   But what would be the costs in this context?"
Ask_Politics,3cm52g,haalidoodi,2,Thu Jul 9 04:31:19 2015 UTC,"If you took a stand and were struck down? This of course depends on the extent of your resistance. Take the example of refusing to issue gay marriages as a clerk, for example. If you simply refuse to issue them for a few days, you may just receive a reprimand from your immediate superior. If you receive an official court order to issue licenses and ignore it, you're facing contempt of court charges. And if an entire city or state government decides to make a stand, you could see a wide range of responses from the executive branch, including sending in the armed forces to enforce the law.   It depends on how much you choose to escalate it or how hard a stand you take, really. Most people would be satisfied with a fairly minor act of resistance to prove a point or make their view heard, I imagine."
Ask_Politics,3cm52g,arbivark,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:37:08 2015 UTC,wouldn't there be some potential for a class action suet?
Ask_Politics,3cm52g,AuditorTux,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:43:50 2015 UTC,"Certainly, under the right circumstances. Of course, this depends on what exact ruling is being filed, who is getting hurt and so on. A suit generally requires actual damages to have been done to somebody; a violation of a court ruling in and of itself is not enough. But if it could be shown that violation of a ruling had caused harm, then such a suit could be filed. For example, a core argument in Brown v. Board of Education was that the segregation system was fundamentally damaging to black children, and these are damages that could possibly be sued for if the ruling was defied by anyone (though it would be hard to quantify).  Don't think that the threat of a suit or sentence would forestall a true believer from resisting what they see as wrong. Don't forget that less than two hundred years ago half of our nation entered open rebellion because of their fundamental belief in the righteousness of slavery.

Ask_Politics,3cm52g,matts2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:35:02 2015 UTC,"You are confusing several different things. The immigration issue is one of law enforcement. The general idea from the start is that the feds enforce federal law, the cities enforce city/state law. When it comes to law enforcement unless the legislature (Congress, city council) has been explicit it is up to the executive/prosecutor to decide where to put resources. It is well understood that they can't enforce all laws completely. So we get prosecutorial discretion.  The gay marriage ruling is entirely different. SCOTUS declared invalid all laws in the U.S. denying gay marriage. That's it, the issue is decided. No government agency, from city to the federal government, is allowed any discretion on rights issues like this. There is absolutely no authority anywhere in the U.S. to deny gay marriage."

If President Obama wants to buy an Xbox, for example, he buys the Xbox.  Add to that any legal work outside of the job as President.  Being president requires a team of lawyers just to handle all the bullshit suits brought against them from the moment they take the office.  Serious legal issues, like the Clintons and Whitewater, can cost the president millions.  Bill and Hillary Clinton weren't particularly wealthy when he became president and had to be floated millions in loans from personal backers just to cover their legal debts while in office.  Politicians, even big time ones like Presidents and Senators, don't actually make much money when compared to positions of similar achievement in the private sector.  Think CEOs who make millions every year.  That's part of the reason there's such a brain drain in America's political system.

While extremely rich now from speaking tours, the Clintons left the White House with debt because of the major expenses that needed to be covered.  Though, the prior Presidents also get a $200,000 a year pension.  While $410,000 a year salary is almost ten times the national average, this is actually a great deal for the American taxpayers."

Correct me if I'm wrong - but I'm near positive that all representatives, senators, and the President's salary continues long after they leave office.

Other than that, here is a very very summed up version.   Definitions and basics:  * Democratic party- US, liberal  * Republican party- US, conservative * President- elected head of US. The US is not a parliamentary structure, so he (or she) is (kind of) directly elected and is not part of Congress * Congress- elected federal legislature, comprised of House of Representatives (lower house) and Senate (upper house)  * Supreme court- National judges, appointed for life   US domestic politics:  1992- Bill Clinton (Democrat) defeats sitting president George H.W. Bush (republican) 1993-North American Free Trade Act (NAFTA) signed, allows for free trade in North America 1995- Oklahoma city bombing 1996- Bill Clinton wins re-election  1998-99- Bill Clinton is impeached (charges are brought against him), but he is acquitted (found not guilty, allowed to stay in office) Other legislation during the Clinton years includes the Family Medical Leave Act, which allows employees to take (unpaid) time off for family medical issues; the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which mandates a waiting period for handgun purchases, and the Defense of Marriage Act, recently found unconstitutional, which prohibited the federal government from recognizing gay marriage. Clinton notably left office with a budget surplus, meaning that the federal deficit was getting smaller. 2000- George W. Bush (son of George H.W. Bush) wins election against Vice President Al Gore (Democrat). This was a very controversial election, and ended up being decided in a 5-4 vote by the supreme court because of issues with how votes were counted.  2001- 9/11 attacks  2001- USA PATRIOT Act is signed, increasing security measures 2002- No Child Left Behind act is signed, which aimed at increasing school standards. In the United States, schools are regulated and run primarily on the state and local levels; this was an attempt by the federal government to regulate schools nationally.  2004: Bush wins re-election  *Other notable legislation includes various security related acts, partial-birth abortion ban, expansion of bi-lateral trade agreements, faith-based initiatives, the Mexican border fence, and vetoing of Stem Cell research funds 2008- Economic crisis begins 2008- Barak Obama (Democrat) elected president  -Obama was the first African American president. His campaign in 2008 was characterized by the ideals of ""hope and change"" and youth participation in politics 2010- The Affordable Care Act or ""Obamacare"" is signed. This changes insurance requirements and requires every american to have insurance.  2012- Obama wins re-election 2013- Edward Snowden leaks information regarding US monitoring activities Notable legislation passed in the Obama years includes equal pay for women, ""cash for clunkers"" which gave people cash for badly polluting cars, repeal of the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy regarding gays in the military, and attempts at wall street reform. The Obama period has been marked by a hostile republican controlled Congress who have attempted to shutdown the federal government by not funding it and who are known for passing very little legislation.  International politics 1989- fall of Berlin Wall 1990- Saddam Hussien invades Kuwait. The US invades Iraq. After US  leaves Iraq, the US and other allies monitor ""no fly zones"" in the north and south of Iraq to prevent Hussein from killing his own people 1991- USSR becomes Russia 1992-99 NATO intervenes in Bosnia and Kosovo to stop genocide 1993 Islamist terrorists bomb world trade center building 1993: US intervenes in Somalia. After soldiers killed in the Battle of Mogadishu (or the Black Hawk Down incident)  1994: US or NATO fail to intervene to stop Rwandan Genocide  1998: Bombing of US embassies in Africa 1998:  India and Pakistan test nuclear weapons 2000: USS Cole bombing by Al-Qaeda 2001: 9/11 attacks 2001: US demands Taliban hand over Bin Laden and al-Qaeda, Taliban refuse, NATO invasion of Afghanistan, Taliban toppled. NATO/US occupation of Afghanistan 2003: US believes Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. US invades Iraq. Iraqi government toppled. No weapons of mass destruction found.

Ask_Politics,3ch2vb,ClnKilgore,6,Sun Jul 12 14:36:22 2015 UTC,"From a Western expat living in the Middle East, hello! I can offer some insight, but keep in mind your question is like asking you to summarise all of Egyptian politics from Nasser onwards... as you can imagine it can take a while.  When the Soviet Union fell, the world went from having two superpowers to having one superpower. We normally talk about regional powers (Egypt and Saudi Arabia in the Middle East, for example), but in the global stage there is exactly one superpower in the world today, and that is the United States. Economically, militarily, and culturally, no other country even comes close to the USA in terms of overwhelming power. This is why there have been so few major state-on-state wars since the early 90s, and almost all conflicts have been insurgency or asymmetric in nature.  What this means is that since the fall of the Soviet Union, the United States (and to an extent, the West), has focused completely on maintaining that superpower position. America's presence as a 'world policeman' is the result of its desire to increase trade and stability so it can continue to provide a high standard of living for itself and its allies, sometimes at a detriment to everyone else. The reason why, for example, America has strong military and foreign aid presence in Egypt (to the tune of 1.4 billion dollars) is not because America wants to invade Egypt or wants to kill its citizens. Rather, America understands that the Suez canal is one of the single most important waterways in the world, and losing control of the canal for even a day can be catastrophic to the American economy.  This isn't really a summary of activities of the United States, but simply a method of explaining why America does the things it does. A lot of people in the Middle East thinks that America is gearing up to attack the Arab states, but realistically if it wanted to the USA could, today, absolutely destroy every city in the MENA region and no military could stop it. Almost all of American foreign policy, and to an extent Western foreign policy, can be explained by considering that all western countries simply want to retain the standard of living and world influence that they gained from the fall of the USSR."

Ask_Politics,3ch2vb,Gnome_Sane,6,Tue Jul 7 22:43:09 2015 UTC,"Last twenty years? Alright, I'll give you a brief overview starting with Clinton. Clinton's presidency was in many ways defined by strong economic growth, which the left claims is thanks to him, while the right attributes to spillover from the policies of Reagan and Bush Sr. A major push for healthcare reform failed under his watch, but progress was made in other areas, including education and civil rights. Under his watch the US also took part in a relatively successful humanitarian intervention in the wars in former Yugoslavia.   After his two terms were up, Bush Jr. won the election by a very small margin, to the point that the final election result went to the Supreme Court to be settled. Generally considered a neoconservative, Bush's term was firstly defined by 9/11, which led to the invasion of Iraq and the severe escalation of the war on terror, sometimes in what many considered unsavory ways (including the authorization of torture on non-American ""enemy combatants"" and the expansion of the surveillance state). Domestically, Bush cut some taxes and boosted spending, especially in military matters, and was fairly conservative on social issues, most famously by cutting off Federal funding to stem cell research. By the time the Great Recession hit, Bush was almost done with his second term (won on the back of what seemed to be at the time a successful intervention in Iraq and helped by a weak Democrat candidate), and he enacted some fairly standard anti-recession measures before leaving office.   Obama entered office on a wave of popular optimism and energy as the economy began to collapse and the problems with the intervention in the Middle East became increasingly obvious to the American public. The first half of his presidency was defined by his economic moves (generally considered rather successful) and a more diplomatic foreign policy, contrasting with the more aggressive stance of Bush. However, facing increasing resistance from the right, especially after his party lost many legislative seats in 2010, weakened his ability to pass legislation, and Obama was forced to reduce pushing for change in domestic policy, especially after the passage of his healthcare reform bill which really solidified resistance on the right against him. His foreign policy also seemed to weaken as relations with Russia and the Middle East deteriorated, though this has recovered since then with the rapprochement with Cuba and the increasing pace of Iran nuclear talks. In recent months Obama has also make progress on social issues, whether directly (getting rid of ""don't ask, don't tell in the US armed forces) or indirectly (the Supreme Court has ruled fairly liberally in the last few years on most issues), while his landmark healthcare law has survived two major legal challenges, with opposition waning.  Now, as for the EU: the biggest changes have been expansion and consolidation. Many new members have been incorporated into the EU, some responsible and model members (e.g. Poland) while others...less so (e.g. Greece). Use of the euro has also expanded, while power has very gradually shifted to the technocrats in Brussels, in accordance with the EU Charter's call for an ""ever-closer union"". While euroskeptic parties have become more prominent in some member nations, most significantly in the UK, support for the EU remains generally high. I can't say much for ideological changes, since the nations of the EU are very diverse politically. The closest thing to a unified movement has been a rising anti-immigrant sentiment across the nations most impacted by immigration from Africa and the Middle East.   That covers the basics, I think. Let me know if you have any clarifications!"

Ask_Politics,3ch2vb,Gnome_Sane,-4,Tue Jul 7 23:49:20 2015 UTC,"So since '95 things haven't been as good in America. In the early 80's Reagan gave big companies more power, thinking that it would lead to businesses doing better and hiring more people. Instead they kept the extra money, and on top of that they started moving their work overseas to keep from having to pay higher wages and providing safe working conditions.   Up until the 80's workers wages would rise on a curve, since then they've stayed the same. Today a very low-wage worker makes about $7 an hour but they'd be making about $15 if the curve hadn't stopped. It's like this with everyone's jobs. Older people have to wait to retire so younger people in the 20-40 range can't find jobs that pay them enough to move out of their parent's houses.   Wealthy people get to do whatever they want now, they commit heinous crimes and get away with it all the time. Money is the only thing that matters anymore. The recent ruling on gay marriage? It was because rich people give to politicians to get their way and the supporters gave more, it had nothing to do with the will of the people, the majority has supported gay marriage for many years now.   Wherever you are if the US comes after you it's because you have something we want and your government isn't keen on doing business. It's why we're in afghanistan, we occupied them until they didn't have a choice but to give us what we wanted at a good price.

The thing that sticks out is that you lump together large periods of time and the behavior of multiple states as if they are all the same. That's almost universally a mistake, and makes it easy to create animosity. Your also give a summary of interpretations (rather biased too) and not of events.

However, you mention nothing of the WMD debacle or that setting up a local democracy failed for many reasons including bad staffing and lack of a national identity.

You say   insist that no one can call it war   even though American media still refers to ""The War in Iraq,"" or something like that. People call it war, and the Obama administration had not insisted that nobody can call what is happening war.  The USA has been supplying factions with support and arms for a long time, at least since the Cold War, in an attempt to get them to do our work for us so we don't risk American lives. The US once supplied Bin Laden with arms because he was anti-Soviet. I'd also not call these factions militia. That implies there is some sort of state organizing them.  Can't comment on events in Syria and Libya.  You also paint the U.S. as some behemoth that will stop at nothing to erase any threat to it,   The removal of any governments that would our even could support any group that seeks to attack the west   There's just no way that could be true. Every single government in the world could support a group that seeks to attack the west.  It's also important to note that U.S. policy decisions are not made with one mind and one goal. There's a lot of competing interests especially in the middle east. Some people want to eradicate potential terrorists after 9/11, some want justice and freedom for those suffering under cruel rulers, some want to protect access to oil, and I'm probably missing a few reasons for intervening in the middle east."

There’s been no exchange of fire with hostile forces. We don’t have troops on the ground. We don’t risk casualties to those troops,” said one senior administration official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity during a conference call arranged by the White House. “None of the factors, frankly, speaking more broadly, has risked the sort of escalation that Congress was concerned would impinge on its war-making power.”   The fact that you are unaware of this should give you serious pause and make you wonder.  http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/21/opinion/21Ackerman.html?_r=0  http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/16/us/politics/16powers.html   WASHINGTON — The White House, pushing hard against criticism in Congress over the deepening air war in Libya, asserted Wednesday that President Obama had the authority to continue the military campaign without Congressional approval because American involvement fell short of full-blown hostilities.  In contending that the limited American role did not oblige the administration to ask for authorization under the War Powers Resolution, the report asserted that “U.S. operations do not involve sustained fighting or active exchanges of fire with hostile forces, nor do they involve U.S. ground troops.” Still, the White House acknowledged, the operation has cost the Pentagon $716 million in its first two months and will have cost $1.1 billion by September at the current scale of operations.   Not only have they insisted that it couldn't be called war, they used that claim to justify not lifting a finger to help restore order to Libya after we bombed Gaddafi into the history books for 10 months.   I'd also not call these factions militia. That implies there is some sort of state organizing them.   http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-19744533   Guide to key Libyan militias   http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/05/07/questions-plague-u-s-led-effort-to-train-syrian-militias/   Questions Plague U.S.-led Effort to Train Syrian Militias   You write:   Can't comment on events in Syria and Libya.   This too should give you some serious pause. Do you think they are unrelated? unimportant?   You also paint the U.S. as some behemoth that will stop at nothing to erase any threat to it,   Actually, I stated their goal. The US can certainly lose. We have proved that in the last year as we have just sat and watched ISIS invade Iraq from Syria and been helpless to stop it.   It's also important to note that U.S. policy decisions are not made with one mind and one goal.   I couldn't agree more! That is a great summary of my first post! 2 different administrations, very different tactics... a somewhat similar goal.   Some people want to eradicate potential terrorists after 9/11, some want justice and freedom for those suffering under cruel rulers, some want to protect access to oil, and I'm probably missing a few reasons for intervening in the middle east.   I'd say those are all good, but the 0bvious one you are missing is the ""Disrupt Terrorist Networks that want WMDs"".  going back to this point:   The USA has been supplying factions with support and arms for a long time, at least since the Cold War, in an attempt to get them to do our work for us so we don't risk American lives. The US once supplied Bin Laden with arms because he was anti-Soviet.   Agreed. And every time a republican president did something like that, how was it revived? Did Obama fans love it then? Did the media? You know, the fucking iran-contra hearings? Yeah - how does that compare to the ISIS rampage of the last 5 years?   http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/photos/estimated-20000-surface-air-missiles-unsecured-libya-14592822/image-14592846   An Estimated 20,000 Surface-to-Air Missiles Are Unsecured in Libya   I'm fairly sure the contras didn't get 20,000 missiles. Or take over parts of Iraq, Syria and Libya.... and who knows where next.   The thing that sticks out is that you lump together large periods of time and the behavior of multiple states as if they are all the same.    I've done nothing at all of the sort. I lump ISIS and AQ and terrorist groups, that is true. I understand the difference between Assad's Baath government, Saddam's Baath government, and Libya's Gaddafi government. I also understand how different they are from Iraq's 10 year old democracy that is still fighting, a year and a half into an ISIS invasion.  But the differences don't mean that there is no relation."

Most cities have a city council and a mayor with some checks and balances between them (the power typically leans one way or another: NYC and Chicago have extremely strong Mayors; Los Angeles has an extremely strong council).   Though cities/counties do not usually impose an income tax, they sure as hell do levy property taxes--which can be seen as a proxy (for the economists out there, I know it's not exactly the same and it has different effects on behavior, but it is still meant to be a progressive form of taxation--and with properly written laws, it can be). Cities very much help pay for infrastructure projects and maintenance that you mentioned. There is no reason a city couldn't raise the money to pay for computers for all--though you would have some privacy - advocates speculate that there is a nefarious reason for this program. If there was any control or monitoring of them, it would backfire. Online voting is possible, but not likely for national elections.   Transparency in government is always contentious. There are legitimate state secrets, but who determines what is legitimate is impossible to figure out. Suffice it to say that local governments are not necessarily more transparent: the more the people care about issues, the more transparent the government has to act. Generally speaking of course.   Cities arm, train, and equip citizens to defend the city but cannot go to war. They're called the police. In the US, cities establish their own PDs, and they can receive funding from the states.   So what you have is a democratically elected technocracy with socialist leanings and an ambition for transparency. Best I can offer."
Ask_Politics,3ccfyb,desmonduz,5,Mon Jul 6 20:48:00 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the protocols but I have an example.   When Denmark was occupied by nazi Germany the ambassador in the USA tried and succeeded to some degree in taking over as the legitimate representative for the Danish government. He was instrumental in setting up the later Thule Air base in Greenland. I'm sure the legality of this is in question and he was faced with a treason charge (later revoked and he became a minister in the post-WWII government).   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thule_Air_Base#World_War_II   After the German occupation of Denmark on 9 April 1940, Henrik Kauffmann Danish Ambassador to the United States, made an agreement ""In the name of the king"" with the United States authorizing the United States to defend the Danish colonies on Greenland from German aggression - this agreement faced Kaufmann with a charge of high treason. The first U.S.-sponsored installations at Thule were established after the US Secretary of State Cordell Hull and the defected Danish Minister to Washington D.C. Henrik Kauffmann signed The Agreement relating to the Defense of Greenland in Washington, D.C. on the symbolically chosen date of 9 April 1941. The treaty, denounced by the Danish government, allowed the United States to operate military bases in Greenland ""for as long as there is agreement"" that the threat to North America existed. Beginning in the summer of 1941, the U.S. Coast Guard and the War Department established weather and radio stations at Narsarsuaq Airport (Bluie West-1), Sondrestrom Air Base (Bluie West-8), Ikateq (Bluie East Two), and Gronnedal (Bluie West-9). In 1943 the Army Air Forces set up weather stations Scoresbysund (Bluie East-3) on the east coast around the southern tip of Greenland, and Thule (Bluie West-6) to be operated by Danish personnel. Many other sites were set up, but BW-6, isolated in the far North, was then of very minor importance.[3]   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Kauffmann   Henrik Kauffmann (26 August 1888 – 5 June 1963) was the Danish ambassador to the United States during World War II. On 9 April 1941, the anniversary of the German occupation of Denmark, he signed on his own initiative ""in the Name of the King"" (Danish: I Kongens Navn) an ""Agreement relating to the Defense of Greenland"" authorizing the United States to defend the Danish colonies on Greenland from German aggression. The treaty was signed by the United States Secretary of State Cordell Hull and approved by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 7 June 1941.  Kauffmann's treaty was approved by the local officials on Greenland but declared void by the Danish government in Copenhagen. Kauffmann ignored this protest citing that Denmark was occupied by a hostile power, consequently, he considered the government to be unable to protect Danish interests. The government responded by charging Kauffmann with high treason and stripping him of his rank. Kauffmann ignored both actions. Kauffmann's line was supported by the Danish consuls general in the United States, as well as by the Danish ambassador to Iran. These diplomats were dismissed as well. Kauffmann replied by urging Danish diplomats around the world not to follow instructions from Copenhagen.  Kauffmann was nicknamed ""the King of Greenland"" for his independent political moves in the Greenland affair.  He was married to Charlotte MacDougall, the daughter of Rear Admiral William D. MacDougall.[1]"
Ask_Politics,3ccfyb,markgraydk,3,Tue Jul 7 10:20:53 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the whether the new government is recognized by the foreign state. If the new government is recognized then it's more than likely that the Ambassador will be asked to present his/her credentials to prove that they truly represent their country.   On the other hand, if the new government is not recognized then its likely that they will support the older Ambassador as the representative of that country. It's possible that a government-in-exile is also formed and that continues to use the same Ambassador. However, I still think there will still be a case of the Ambassador to present his/her credentials again.   What if the coup is not sanctioned by the country where the embassy is located, and the country does not recognise the new government because it was not democratically elected?   Democracy doesn't really matter. Britain recognized the Soviet Union in 1921. The US recognized Bangladesh in April 1972 even though they won their liberation in December 1971. It was pretty obvious that the liberation was a popular movement (and hence having the seed of democracy), but was not in the Cold War interests of the US at that time.

One of the most popular English speaking far left news sites, www.libcom.org , is a contraction of ""libertarian-communist"".  But then the US right started using the word and now that is the sort of meaning we see tied to it so often.

IIRC when it came into english use, libertarian was used as a translation. However in parallel the word liberal which first meant classical liberal morphed in the US, getting closer to the left side of the political spectrum. That pushed away classical liberals from this label and thus the capitalists anarchists, close to the market anarchists, a subsection of the libertarian left, got closer to this label. Those two factors made for the classical liberals to call themselves libertarians."

I think it's mostly due to comparing how personal finances work to governments and financial institutions. Obviously the differences are vast and incentives opposite, but it's hard for people to see a problem with not enough money to match spending and think, ""well, why don't they just spend less?""

Ask_Politics,3ca40l,WackyXaky,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:01:31 2015 UTC,"lol you are the first one to hit the nail. Greece had a poor debt-to-GDP ratio since 1984. Even before 1989 there were open and intense discussions about the danger of a default. During the 90s and part of 00s Greece tried to fight the large debt with an effort to stimulate development in order to hide debt behind GDP (the ratio stayed limited but still above 100%). However GDP includes public sector and in general everything, productive or not. Governments, which during all those years were exclusively either Conservatives or Social-democrats, created a status kwo that made corruption extremely deeply rooted and widely spreaded (corruption was present since 1821 of course) and it is this what caused all the mess.  The first attempt to impose austerity started in 1990 by Mitsotakis but ended prematurely when the then-minister of foreign affairs Samaras (yes, the former PM) left the government. 11 years of Social Democrats followed, with serious scandals again and the policy you mentioned (loans over loans to stimulate growth). After the introduction of Euro the party kept going and when in 2004 the Conservatives took over, we saw the impossible: a total of over 800.000 people were hired in the public sector, most in short-term jobs. They were thirsty after so many years outside government, they had to spend a lot...  So, on top of all other illnesses of Greece, it followed the wrong policy. You know that when there is growth then a recession will follow. How do you (or your creditors) expect that you will go through the inevitable recession when your debt-to-GDP ratio is 110% (a lot more in reality since the true level was hidden) and your interests are not exactly low?  What you call logical is what Germany and Scandinavian governments did. Greece did the exact opposite..."

Those of us who support Reagan often take the view that Iran-Contra was a 'means justify the ends' situation that, overall, was in the interest of the United States.

I don't approve of the President defying the will of Congress whether it be Reagan or anyone else -- Reagan's knowledge and culpability are still very much in question.  However, setting aside the illegality, it was the correct policy.  I'd put comparing which of the two is 'worse' as a toss-up; although, to be fair here, Iran-Contra was intended to save American lives -- Benghazi resulted in their deaths.

This is a much better comparison.  There are some clear differences.  Reagan should have known better than to place Marines in the middle of a civil war.  In very general terms, the possibility that something like that might happen should have been anticipated; however, I'm unaware of very specific threats against the Marine barracks.  This is where Beirut differs with Benghazi.  The security situation there was clearly deteriorating, there had been a multitude of threats against the consulate, the ambassador had repeatedly asked for security enhancements, the immediate response from the military/DOS was non-existent, and the blaming of the event on a YouTube video was absurd.

I largely agree with you on this.  I don't consider Benghazi to be that big a scandal compared to the IRS scandal and Hillary's e-mail server.  In fact, she is routinely taken entirely out of context for her ""What does it matter?"" quote.  I watched that hearing live, and it's quite clear what she meant.  She was saying, ultimately, what does it matter what precipitated the attack when the end result was the death of four Americans?

Iran-Contra was deliberate policy, unlike Benghazi (unless it was, in which case it would be a very controversial thing for awhile and might fade).  But the real issue in my opinion is the hyperpartisanship we're seeing today. It's no secret that Congress has been polarizing for decades, and it's gotten much worse over time, meaning it's worse now than it was then. That makes the Congressional panels that much more political and partisan, and they spend a lot more time bringing them up.  But it's not just Congress. People have self-sorted into parties and also (according to some) become more radical. At any rate, the country's parties are now more opposed to one another than they have been in quite some time, and people see the other party as a threat to the country more and more. So they're quicker to latch onto theories that would make the other party look worse, without a doubt.  The other issue is that Benghazi just has not ended. It may be forgotten to the same level as Iran-Contra someday, but that would require it actually fading. But Hillary just went ahead and deleted 30,000 emails that may have been recoverable, things that might've put the whole issue to rest...or at least not fed the suspicions considering deleting 30,000 emails and having an unmentioned email account that was used for State business (even if not much) is very sketchy.  These things fed suspicions among even the left, and that's shown in polls. One from last month showed 57% of Americans don't feel she's honest and trustworthy, while only 42% do, illustrating why Benghazi continues to be fed. The email scenario and the money from the Clinton Foundation and everything else is just fueling speculation that will not go away for quite some time in hyperpartisan party politics, and will probably fade (if nothing is found, which I think is the most likely scenario) in 30 years as Iran-Contra did."

Of that, 75% must be spent on US businesses, so its essentially just a form of government spending where a stable country buys up our weapons...weapons they helped develop, in many cases.  5) Generally, there are a whole lot of benefits related to being allied with Israel, as the Washington Institute wrote about.

I don't buy many of these.  Not only did Bush not listen to Israel, he was the reason Israel supported the Iraq invasion in the first place. It was his intelligence they were mostly relying on. And besides, Bush made clear from well before even talking to Israel or any other ally that one of the first things he wanted to do was strike Iraq and remove Saddam. Paul O'Neill, his first Secretary of the Treasury, spoke to journalist Ron Suskind for a book called The Price of Loyalty, on O'Neill's time as Secretary. He sat in on national security council meetings, since he was needed for sanctions work especially, and noted that from the start Bush was gunning for Iraq...no Israel involved. In fact, he took a very big step back and said he would just be leaving Israel and the Palestinians to their own devices, and not bother with peace talks.  Then there's the whole Arab world scenario. And while that sounds tantalizing, the Arab world is still our ally at this point. It's not mutually exclusive, and hasn't been for quite some time. Besides, the Arab world has such a lower level of GDP, and such higher levels of corruption, that they would likely provide fewer benefits. Sadly, the Arab world is still working through a lot of issues, some people attributing that to the resource curse of oil making it unnecessary to diversify. All in all, it's fanciful thinking to think the Arab world would be a lot better than Israel to trade with; it still isn't even today.  And then there's the whole ""What if Israel didn't exist?"". Ignoring the moral aspect of this and so on, it's unlikely the Middle East would be any more stable. Many of the sectarian conflicts going on right now stem from Western intervention generally, not on behalf of Israel, and from issues related to the Iranian Revolution and the Arab world's reaction to the Shiite revolution as it were. The Middle East would not likely be any different in reality, and it might possibly be worse without Israel's intelligence gathering being on the frontlines. In short, even if you disagree with that, there's just no way to know how it'd pan out.  So yeah, no candidates oppose military aid to Israel. They see Israel as a beneficial partner to have."

If professional bowlers are not using performance-enhancing drugs, and there is a strong culture of staying drug free in bowling, and anyone caught would be shunned from the sport by their peers, then the governing body should trust the community to self-regulate. Once more bowlers start to use, and it becomes a problem, then the governing body should institute tests. Once the tests become super crazy and the bowling fans want to support people who (actually) don't use, then it's time to de-escalate the tests and move towards more self-regulation...

The FDA, for instance, was formed in response to the large number of mislabeled or downright dangerous products on the market. At first there was no government regulation, the industries failed to self-regulate, many people were being harmed, and the government stepped in to protect public health.   Historically financial regulation in the US has almost always followed some sort of disaster. There are many other examples; every new industry starts out unregulated by default, and it is usually only after a problem becomes apparent that regulations are introduced.  Regulatory bodies are sometimes misused for personal benefit. Powerful individuals jump back and forth between agencies and the businesses they regulate, re-introducing the conflict of interest.  But that just means we need regulatory reform, not deregulation. Self-regulation is a fantasy, something possible only in a hypothetical world of perfectly rational actors hewing to strict ethical principles.

The ruling which first provided an equivalency between corporations and people was Dartmouth over two centuries ago, a case decided within one generation of the ratification of the First Amendment.  Citizens United did not affect the 1907 Tillman Act's ban on corporate campaign donations (as the Court noted explicitly in its decision), nor the prohibition on foreign corporate donations to American campaigns, nor did it concern campaign contribution limits. The Citizens United decision did not disturb prohibitions on corporate contributions to candidates, and it did not address whether the government could regulate contributions to groups that make independent expenditures.  The Citizens United ruling did however remove the previous ban on corporations and organizations using their treasury funds for direct advocacy, noting ""[i]f the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech.""

What does that right wing Bloomberg have to say?  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-02/payrolls-in-u-s-rose-in-june-with-little-change-in-wages   Labor Market Runs in Place; More Jobs, Participation Lowest Since 1977  The unemployment rate, which is derived from a separate Labor Department survey of households, was the lowest since April 2008, falling from 5.5 percent in May. The labor force shrank by 432,000 people last month, accounting for the bulk of the drop in joblessness.  The participation rate, which indicates the share of the working-age population in the labor force, decreased to 62.6 percent, the lowest since October 1977, from 62.9 percent. Labor force participation slumped among teens, with a more moderate decrease among men 20 years and older.   So the conensus is this;  As long as we don't include the people who gave up looking for work  as ""unemployed"" we can trick the data to reveal a low unemployment rate.  How about those jobs programs that created this turn around?  http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-no-such-thing-as-shovel-ready-projects/   With unemployment hovering near 10 percent nearly two years after President Obama signed his economic stimulus package, Mr. Obama is acknowledging that, despite his campaign promises, ""there's no such thing as shovel-ready projects.""  When the president campaigned for the stimulus package at the start of his presidency, he and others in his administration repeatedly insisted the investments would go to ""shovel-ready"" projects -- projects that would put people to work right away. As recently as August, however, local governments were still facing delays spending the money they were allocated from the stimulus, CBS News Correspondent Nancy Cordes reported.   So look, he did come into office while the economy was shedding jobs. No doubt that was a tough hand. However, his stimulus - by his own admission - didn't create jobs like he promised. They then turned to the ""We Saved Jobs"" claim... which was dubious at best.  I'm curious, why didn't you link to the liberal pages or the article that you read that makes you think more jobs were created under Obama? See, I can believe that more were created in the aftermath of the layoffs in 07 and 08.... but the idea that Obama's policy made that happen or that the end result was due to his leadership seems like a stretch."

If these are public sector jobs, it is a little disingenuous to say that Obama is a ""jobs president"" if all it takes is creating and staffing government programs.  The article doesn't mention net jobs either. How many jobs were lost? I could say that I'm doing very well for myself because I made a million in income, but without saying how calculating how much I spent (maybe 5 million) I could be in a huge hole.

U3 is the unemployment rate. It doesn't take into account those who aren't trying to enter it. It only takes into account those actively looking for jobs. That is described here:   People are classified as unemployed if they do not have a job, have actively looked for work in the prior 4 weeks, and are currently available for work.   The rate that looks at those who aren't trying to enter the job force is the Labor Force Participation Rate, though it excludes retirees. It takes all workers between 16 and 64 (might be 65) who are employed or looking for a job, and divides them by all ""working age persons"" between those ages.  U4 measures only those who are working, looking for work, or who have given a job market related reason for not searching for a job, and are unemployed.  U5 maybe closer to what you're describing, since it counts those marginally attached to the workforce (available for a job, want one, have looked for one in the past 12 months, of which discouraged workers are a subset.

Ask_Politics,3btej9,ahumblesloth,19,Thu Jul 2 00:13:30 2015 UTC,"So these threads can get kinda dangerous, because the analyses tend to be based on who the writer wants to win and you have to keep in mind that there are 380 days until the Democratic Convention. Now having said that, yes it is possible for O'Malley to win the nomination, but it is certainly a long shot.   Yes, Hillary feels inevitable. Many would argue she seemed inevitable in 2008 as well. She certainly has a stronger resume this year, however. In order for O'Malley (or any other challenger--hereafter in reference to not-Hillarys) to win the Democratic nomination, he simply must survive the first few States: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada, all of which are scheduled throughout February. South Carolina matters the least, because the Democratic nominee won't win SC in the general. The problem with the other three is they are different from each other in meaningful ways and pretty different from the general election voter.  Iowans famously voted Hillary third in the 2008 caucus, behind Obama and Edwards. If Hillary wins Iowa, all of the challengers are in trouble. But, Hillary doesn't fit well in Iowa, so its an opportunity the challengers cannot mess it up.  New Hampshire is tricky. Bernie Sanders, of neighboring Vermont, probably has a leg-up in NH, but Hillary will compete hardest here as well. This state needs time invested; a lot of face-to-face time with the voters. I suspect O'Malley will do well in NH--if he doesn't finish top 2, he will be in serious trouble.  Lastly, Nevada. A classic Western State. Must demonstrate ability to appeal to Latinos and it will indicate ability to win states like New Mexico and Colorado.  It is interesting (to me at least) that all of the Democratic nominees so far are NorEasters. Maryland, Vermont, New York, and Rhode Island. This actually severely hurts the Challengers, because name recognition is 75% of the battle. And only one of the candidates is a household name. Sanders has a slight advantage over the others because he is still in office; he can attract headlines from the Senate Floor and by proposing bills. O'Malley can basically only win through the power of his ideas, ability to communicate, and fundraising. Unfortunately, (most) rich people will only donate to campaigns that they think has a legitimate chance. So the first thing the Challengers have to do is convince the bundlers and super-PAC folks that they can beat Hillary. That really is not easy.  The Democratic nominee, whoever he is, then must pull together a coalition for the general election: 495 days away. Obama proved to be fantastic at this; a coalition of unmarried women, African-Americans, young people, and Latinos carried the necessary states for him. The next Democrat is going to have pretty much universal support from the LGBT community, as the GOP is going to run ideas on how to ""protect religious freedoms"" and ways to legally discriminate against gay people (at the state level, but its an election year, so people will buy into it). The next Democrat is also going to have to raise the number of Latinos and blacks who vote blue--that might be difficult with the all-White cast we have right now. Expect a non-white Democratic VP choice (looking at you Julian Castro). And bringing out white women will certainly be helpful as well; obviously Hillary has the easiest ability to do that. So, the Challengers can make their General Election lives easier by beginning that coalition forming now--especially among Latinos in the Western states (Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Oregon are all purple states that can very much determine the outcome of the election).   O'Malley's biggest problems are twofold: Name recognition and energy. He needs to get his name out there and identified with some core ideas. Obama=Hope and Change. It really needs to be that simple. Bush=Compassionate Conservative. It needs to memorable. Clinton=It's the Economy, Stupid. And convincing. Hillary is lightyears ahead of all the Challengers in this regard.   The second: energy. Energize the primary voters to donate, to volunteer, to vote. Get them engaged on social media and excited to talk about that candidate at work or school. So far, Bernie Sanders seems to have a great start on that. Maintaining it for so long might be difficult. O'Malley needs to start inspiring that love first, in my opinion. Attract people to your campaign, then you have the money and volunteers to prove yourself viable to the bigger donors, which can be used to strengthen your poll numbers. But it starts with the numbers.   Hope this answers your question and did so in a relatively non-judgmental way. I'll be happy to answer any follow ups."

Like, why does the GOP field have 15 people running, while the Dems have 5 or so? Sorry for the questions."
Ask_Politics,3btej9,DictatorDan,5,Thu Jul 2 01:53:39 2015 UTC,"Great questions. Well, there can only be one Democratic nomination, and the competition of the primaries is (in today's political age) absolutely necessary*. Candidates run for three main reasons: they genuinely think they can win, they want to alter the conversation and agenda, and they want to raise their profile. Based on what I have seen, O'Malley and Sanders are in the first category, while Lincoln Chafee (of Rhode Island) is probably in the third.   I should point out that if VP Biden decides to run, he will obviously have the name recognition, but seems to me that he would lack the energy for support. He doesn't really offer anything that Hillary doesn't.   With the three reasons in mind, its a bit easier to dissect the crowded GOP field. There are so many people running because there really is no obvious GOP candidate. The Republicans don't have a Hillary. The GOP front runners for the past few elections at the beginning of the campaign ended up with the nomination: George Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney. Today, the closest thing to a ""next-in-line"" is probably Jeb Bush--cue the complaints over aristocratic families. But Jeb is not in the same position as Hillary; people have high opinions of Bill right now; W's tenure is still frowned upon. And regardless of whether it is fair, those associations matter when a voter goes into the booth (call it name recognition's thorns to the aforementioned rose).   But, if you take a long-view of this election, I think the GOP is very much at a crossroads right now. And whoever becomes the Republican nominee will forge the identity of the Republican party for the foreseeable future (W did this in 2000; McCain and Mitt Romney did not do this--they did not have the mandate to).  But the Republicans are at the very obvious point of losing the demographic war. If they hold into the older-white-male base of their party and do not make serious communication and policy changes, they will (further) alienate growing key voting blocks: particularly women, Hispanic , and Asian voters. The Tea Party is not a survivable future for the GOP.   I should point out: keep an eye on who O'Malley hires onto his staff. They will be somewhat indicative as to how seriously he running and how effective he can be. Hillary has her team. Pretty much the institutional mainstream Democratic dream team. But Obama gathered together a cast of relative unknown misfits and put together the best campaign machine ever. So....conventional wisdom might not win elections anymore.   Keep firing away questions if you want!  *I say that as someone who wants to see the primary system abolished, but that would require many changes to how elections are conducted in this country and is a subject for another (longer) post.

He's also quite young, so he's building name recognition outside of Maryland for a future run. And he gets a platform to advocate issues that are important to him, and influence what issues the other candidates talk about as a consequence.  O'Malley doesn't have a real shot this election.

An easy example is pollution. Using taxes (""pigouvian"") to reduce emissions of pollution is superior to a command and control system as it allows the least cost firms to abate pollution in place of forcing it on high cost abatement.  If you can reduce pollution at a lower cost, taxation allows this.    As another example, taxation has shown to be far more effective in reducing health costs and teen use from smoking.  Alternatives like raising smoking age, advertising the harms, and other regulations have been less effective and more costly overall.  If you want to reduce use or some activity, the cheapest method is simply to tax it.  We have seen this with marijuana and alcohol use as well.

Ask_Politics,3bsl5t,DenSem,4,Wed Jul 1 20:26:08 2015 UTC,"I just happened to receive a few emails from my Constitutional Law Professor. He's a well respected figure in this area and was quite a prominent Con law attorney before he retired and began teaching. I'm happy to expand upon them if you're curious.  First email: ""The Court decided Obergefell, the same-sex marriage case, today, holding States must allow same-sex marriages and recognize same-sex marriages lawfully contracted out of state. The opinion (Kennedy for himself, Breyer, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan) talks both due process and equal protection. There are dissents by Roberts (for all the dissenters), Scalia (himself and Thomas), Thomas (himself and Scalia), and Alito (joined by both Scalia and Thomas). The opinions are here.""  Second: ""I've now read the opinions. I'm pleased with the result, but I have to say that I don't think a lot of Justice Kennedy's opinion. It is of course more polished than the ones half of you wrote in a hurry, but many of yours were better than his.  Chief Justice Roberts's dissent does a good job picking at Kennedy's opinion; I think it's worth reading. The other dissents aren't worth much, I think.""  As you can see, he doesn't think much of the merit of the opinion or how well the arguments are structured or presented. From what I can tell, the main constitutional protection that the court applied is the 14th amend equal protection clause, which grants equal protection of the law to all persons. Courts apply different levels of scrutiny to laws that seem to violate equal protection based on the classification of the affected party. Strict scrutiny is applied when a suspect class or fundamental right is involved, and strict scrutiny means that a challenged statute must be ""narrowly tailored"" to serve a ""compelling"" government interest, and must not have a ""less restrictive"" alternative. In contrast, rational basis scrutiny merely requires that a challenged statute be ""reasonably related"" to a ""legitimate"" government interest.  I have not read the full opinion, but it seems to me that the rationale here is that the right to marry is fundamental and thus a state must have a compelling interest in restricting the rights of same-sex couples to marry. I fail to see what legitimate interests the states can raise, given that studies have demonstrated that children raised in same-sex households are equally as likely to succeed and grow to be well-adjusted and functioning adults. The state is basically expected to make a compelling argument on behalf of its people for why such a law is necessary, and the 5 justices were not convinced. The decision does seem to be political in nature with the legal justification tossed in as an afterthought, hence the 4 dissenting justices, but to my very inexperienced eyes and limited understanding of constitutional law I don't see how the state can pass a strict scrutiny test (unless the argument is that the court should have employed rational basis as the reviewing lens and therefore deferred to the states)."

Ask_Politics,3bsl5t,marktheknife,3,Wed Jul 1 21:46:39 2015 UTC,"It is emphatically the province and duty of the Judicial Department [the judicial branch] to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases must, of necessity, expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the Courts must decide on the operation of each.  So, if a law [e.g., a statute or treaty] be in opposition to the Constitution, if both the law and the Constitution apply to a particular case, so that the Court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the Constitution, or conformably to the Constitution, disregarding the law, the Court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case. This is of the very essence of judicial duty. If, then, the Courts are to regard the Constitution, and the Constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the Legislature, the Constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which they both apply.\  Those, then, who controvert the principle that the Constitution is to be considered in court as a paramount law are reduced to the necessity of maintaining that courts must close their eyes on the Constitution, and see only the law [e.g., the statute or treaty].  This doctrine would subvert the very foundation of all written constitutions.   From Marbury v. Madison, a classic, rightly-decided* SCOTUS case  So to the extent that article really did state that determinations of constitutionality are to rest with the legislature, it is incorrect. The judiciary, and Supreme Court especially, are tasked with telling us what the law is—of reading and interpreting the law and how it applies to reality. To the extent they have to apply two laws to reality—both a statute and the Constitution—the Constitution must overrule the statute since it is the supreme law of the land.  This does not entirely answer your question though. Because what Scalia is really getting at is accusing the court of judicial activism—of not merely interpreting laws, but actually making NEW ones—while also saying that this is a big problem. So is this accusation correct?  I think the answer is kinda yes. But getting to why I think that is somewhat complicated, and goes partly to the heart of what a judge's job is. So, sorry for the long post that follows.   As noted, judges interpret and apply the law. But many laws are deeply ambiguous, such as the Constitution arguably is. The thing about interpretation is, the more ambiguous the law or text you’re trying to read, the greater the amount of plausible interpretations.  In other words, imagine a clear law being like a photograph, a semi-clear law being like a Picasso, and a deeply ambiguous law like a Jackson Pollock splatter painting. The judge’s job is to tell us what this picture shows. The more abstract the picture, the more discretion the judge has in telling us what he thinks it is. In the case of the last painting, the judge can come pretty close to making up whatever he thinks. As long as he says it persuasively, people will be relatively convinced.  But this presents a problem—our constitutional democracy is premised on there being a clear split between the interpretation of laws (the power of the judiciary) and the writing of laws (the power of the legislature). Yet if the above analogy holds true, we’ve shown there are cases where the judge can basically make up what a law says—or in other words, can essentially write new laws! All that appears to constrain a judge in certain cases is his or her own values and beliefs.  People do not want judges to write new laws based off of their own feelings—that would wrong our system of government. But how can we tell where the line is between interpretation and making new laws?  There are three main strategies I can surmise for judges to ensure their opinions falls on the side of interpretation and not making laws.   First, judges must give convincing arguments that show how the law as it is written ties into their interpretation of the law. Second, judges often try to avoid making dramatic legal leaps all at once, but instead build up decisions gradually. At the same time, they respect the reasoning and holdings of other judges and legal commentators, rather than going off on their own course. By doing this, there is a slow evolution of legal reasoning as different courts and commentators weigh in on the issues. This prevents the dramatic feeling of suddenly having a new law, because the “new law” arrived so gradually no one noticed. Third, judges try to follow interpretive strategies that help constrain their own discretion, and helps the legislature know how judges will interpret their drafting. For instance, judges create self-imposed rules about how to read statutes, and try to get these rules widely adopted.    Now finally, we get to the same-sex marriage opinion. In my opinion, it follows none of the above strategies, and thus seems like judicial law-making. This is disappointing, because it very well could have followed the strategies and reached the same result.    In other words, it doesn’t very carefully show how the right to marriage is found in the text of the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause, upon which the opinion is apparently founded.  Second, the idea of a “right to marriage” is a huge break from prior thinking on the matter—there WERE very plausible arguments about why, e.g., gays shouldn’t be allowed to be discriminated against more generally, which I wish the opinion was based on. See this article at the Volokh Conspiracy for some good critiques of the opinion's reasoning (by an author who agrees with the outcome, no less). Third, Kennedy doesn’t appear to be following any very well thought-out interpretive strategy. His approach is something of a living constitutional approach, yet at the same time it appeals to the purposes of the historical marriage tradition. It’s just a mess.   *Okay so way back at the top I just noted Marbury v. Madison is rightly decided. This is because you might otherwise notice this dilemma: the source I gave you saying that the judiciary has this power is from the judiciary itself. Obviously, you might say, this is a naked power grab by the judiciary! Why take their word on this? Well, I don't want to get into it, but the opinion IS well-reasoned, and reading the Federalist papers (written by some of our founding fathers) makes it pretty clear the court got it right. You can research that on your own though if you'd like.  Hope all this helps!"

Ask_Politics,3bok6v,Wartz,2,Wed Jul 1 13:36:32 2015 UTC,"Generally countries that export large amounts of natural resources suffer from it (except for Norway). The problem is two-fold.   Lots of natural resource extraction that is then exported increases the value of the local currency making it more difficult for small export businesses to compete on the global marketplace (whereas without the changes in currency value the business might be more competitive).  Second, all this money concentrated in limited industries often controlled at least in part by the government only encourages corruption and a failure to reinvest the money into the actual population. This is common throughout the Middle East and Africa (lots of mining going on there). In fact, many times the dictators/oligarchs that control the oil (or whatever other resource it happens to be) will repress the very populations of people most likely to start businesses, get higher educations, etc. in order to maintain control.  Because of this, countries can be stunted by the commodities they produce. Without tons of oil revenue, it's possible the countries in the Middle East would undergo an economic and civil renaissance!"

I would even doubt a President would follow a budget law that restricts his offense usage of the military.

They can issue their new currency at a low value increasing exports and the tourism trade. This is a path to some sort of economic stability, if a long one.

The cons are that almost no one will lend to them now, and if they default that becomes a fairly permanent state of affairs.

The legislators/lobbyists/other movers and shakers in government who support this kind of legislation know better than to frame a ban on gay marriage as religiously based, since legislation validated through that kind of rhetoric would of course be a major red flag in the courts. So although your average Joe-Schmo on Facebook might say that gay marriage is wrong because it's not what Jesus wants, the people who make the laws know to frame it under different criteria by making more secular historical or sociological claims to support their arguments.   So in the end, SCOTUS ruled that state bans on gay marriage were unconstitutional, but for markedly different reasons than that the bans on gay marriage were a violation of the Establishment Clause. Instead, they ruled that marriage is a fundamental right to which Americans are offered equal protection under the Constitution."

That is the relevant text of the First Amendment.  Despite what many people today choose to believe, it was designed only to prevent the federal government from establishing a national religion, or from banning any religion.  It was not originally intended to limit the power of state governments (and indeed, some states did have official religions early in America's history, such as Massachusetts).  Supreme Court cases have since applied these restrictions to state governments.  The Constitution bans official promotion of one religion over another (or no religion), not the passage of laws that correspond with religious beliefs.  For example, the Ten Commandments forbid murder or theft, but no one would say that we cannot have laws against those things because they are based on a religious belief."

In doing some research, I found this bit on wikipedia:   Throughout the term, but mostly during the last months of the term—May, June, and, if necessary, July—the Court announces its opinions. The decision of the Court is subsequently published, first as a slip opinion, and subsequently in the United States Reports. In recent years, opinions have been available on the Supreme Court's website and other legal websites on the morning they are announced.   So does the Court formally ""announce"" rulings as soon as they are decided upon, or do the justices, at least with some cases, withhold that announcement for a short period of time?

So, in private conversation the justices will describe their reasoning behind their vote. The more senior justices go first. If the junior justices agree completely they will ”join"" the opinion written by the more senior justice. If a justice agrees with you vote, but not the reasoning behind it, he or she will write a ""concurring opinion"".   So, from what I understand, the fact that the four justices who disagreed with marriage equality each wrote their own opinion is significant. It either means that they're grasping at straws to defend their decision, or they realize that this is such a big deal that they want history to record that they had something to say about it."

It came with unintended consequences, though.  Life expectancy is rising, and the position is becoming increasingly influenced by politics.  I saw an article some time ago that supported an 18-year term limit.  I feel it would be appropriate with the specification/reasoning they gave:   3 Justices elected appointed every 6 years Must wait 6 years between terms Ensures that each party has a much more difficult time ""stacking the court"" Ensures that Justices are (ideally) more in tune with current technology/social opinion   However, I realize there are most likely problems with this that I don't see.

So after they actually vote on a decision, there is still a lot of work to be done.  Typically a justice on the majority side will be selected to write the official opinion of the Court.  If the decision is not unanimous, someone on the minority side will write a ""dissent"" explaining why they disagree.  In addition, other justices can write ""concurrences"" (if they are in the majority) or their own dissents (if they are in the minority) if they are not satisfied with the reasoning used in the majority opinion or the main dissent.  The opinions all get circulated and discussed, and justices might alter their opinions to respond to points made in the others, or even switch sides.  So this can all take quite a while.  As I understand it, once all the opinions are ready and everyone is satisfied, everything is released pretty quickly."

Ask_Politics,3bl1aq,congressional_staffr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:59:00 2015 UTC,"Senior Committee leaders (Chairmen and Ranking Members) are generally elected by full party membership.    The R's give a lot more discretion to their Chairmen to handle Subcommittee chair assignments, as compared to the D's (which have more of a structure in place).    Each party has a ""steering"" committee; the names are slightly different, but comparable.    These Committees generally handle assigning rank and file to Committees.    Notably, when you read about people being disciplined recently, you can see an illustration of that in practice.    Meadows for example - initially lost his subcommittee gavel based on action by Chaffetz, not Boehner.    But when that batch of R's lost committee assignments a couple years ago, it was done by the R steering committee (with strong encouragement from leadership, no doubt, but it still had to vote to take those actions).    As to the formula for how many seats each party hasa on each committee, I'll double check this in the AM (when I can log on to the CRS website at work), but as I recall, the formulas are more of a topline number (all committee members on each side, of all committees); the specific number of R's v D's on each committee is worked out between Boehner and Pelosi."

Ask_Politics,3bl1aq,congressional_staffr,2,Tue Jun 30 03:19:58 2015 UTC,"The answer is D, but only kind of.    I'd grant A, and I'd grant B.    I would not grant C (though I'm not even 100% sure what C means).   In practice, the way it works now is that there are multiple parallel tracks.    The Committee process is one.  Coming straight to the floor is another.   It's not uncommon at all for legislation to bypass Committees.  I'd say the only legislation that hits the floor now that is more likely than not to have come through the committee process is appropriations.   And even then, it's only the regular order approps bills.  When we inevitably get to CR's, omni's, and such, those bypass committee.    If your prof/instructor is arguing that the framers constrained the power of the majority and the committee process empowers the majority, I don't know if I buy that.    I think it reads way to much into the process to assume that going through Committee vs. otherwise is done for any reason other than optics and/or whip counts (ie getting more people to vote for the bill).    Ultimately leadership can (and does) have a bill proceed however it wants - skip committee, go through the committee process and then to the floor, or go through committee at which point leadership decides it doesn't like the committee product and takes something else to the floor.    In the house, the majority has the power.  That's pretty much how its always gone.    If you want to get into a discussion of what Congress has done to herd cats in the House (which I guess would fall in to ""overcoming restraints""), the Special Rule has done much more than the Committee process in that regard.    That CRS paper has a summary, but not the history; as I recall (I think there's one I could pull with history tomorrow), the Special Rule process was created by Speaker Cannon maybe? (turn of the 20th century or so I recall).    Instituting that process has done much more to consolidate power in the House than anything else (just read some of the recent Hill rag articles about Boehner's response to the 30 or so R's that voted against the rule for TPA)."

I didn't limit to swing states though, because it's not always just swing states that get attention under the status quo.    First, there's always the primary process (which granted wouldn't necessarily have to change with no electoral college, but probably would - if you nationalize the general election, it stands to reason that nationalizing the candidate selection process either would be part of that, or would be soon to follow).    To me, if any part of the process is truly egregious, it's that more than the electoral college.  At least with the electoral college, it's up to a state's electorate as to how ""in play"" they want to be at the end of the day.  Any state could poll 50-50 in theory.    But with the primary process, through random quirks of history, a fairly small number of fairly small states have an unreasonably outsized impact on who the rest of the country gets to choose among - both at the primary level, and in November.    But under the electoral college, there's the simple fact that rural states do get at least passing attention often, even if they're not ""swing"" states.    With votes being as close as they have in recent years (even 2012 was closer than people give it credit for) no candidate can afford to write off the electoral votes in the mid-west, for instance - even in the smaller states."

Compulsory voting usually comes with a fine if you do not vote, and usually the people that have the hardest time voting are people who can't really afford a fine - students, elderly, low income people.  I had a friend who worked in Australian politics (where compulsory voting is instituted) and he said that campaigning is basically boiled down to a marketing campaign rather than the full-fledged style the USA has (voter turnout operations). This in turn could potentially mean there would be less of a role for money as campaigns might be smaller sized.  The Democrats would like mandatory voting, as normally the higher the turnout, the better the chance Democrats have at winning. And I believe there are studies showing that it makes it harder for third party/non-traditional parties to break into the mix.  I don't think there is a better way to increase voter turnout than mandatory voting. Secretary Clinton proposed a mandatory 20 days of early voting period. Senator Sanders proposed making election day a national holiday (I'm personally opposed to this but I know others are big into this). Washington State and Oregon have all mail ballot systems which has also increased turnout. Some people want to have electronic/internet voting (which I'm opposed to as well because it's ideal to have a paper trail) - but this would still negatively affect large portions of the population - the elderly who might not understand how to use the internet, lower income/rural populations who don't have access to internet.  I'm a little bit biased because I would be in favor of mandatory voting."

I'm currently indifferent, but I've never heard someone on reddit mention their opposition to it.  One of the major downsides I see is the stunt in economic activity.

Ask_Politics,3bgph4,Ruthless__Pragmatism,7,Mon Jun 29 03:41:59 2015 UTC,"On most national holidays not everyone has the day off - specifically lower income people who work minimum wage jobs.

This is why having an extended early vote period would be better to having one day off.  But let's say you do have the ability to take election day off as a national holiday - it would be very easy for me to think ""well I might as well take Monday off too and have a 4 day weekend and get that trip to Vegas in that I've been putting off,"" rather than view voting as a civic duty.  I know those aren't the best arguments against making it a national holiday and I guess I misspoke when I said that I'm opposed to making election day a national holiday - what I meant was I don't support people who believe that this is the best solution when I don't think it will help with voter turnout and in fact might hurt it. I think this solution takes away from better, proven methods of increasing voter turnout. So go ahead and make it a national holiday, but do that in addition to having 20 days of early vote or making it easier to get an absentee/mail ballot."

Ask_Politics,3bgph4,philhartmonic,2,Mon Jun 29 06:19:22 2015 UTC,May I ask why you are opposed to mandatory voting?  Your point about the money is a very good point and I was apprehensive about including that - I think the better argument is that it would make it a bit more difficult for special interests to have as large of influence on politicians or at least more difficult for politicians to ignore certain (currently) low voting demographics such as the youth vote.
Ask_Politics,3bgph4,HeyZeusCreaseToast,3,Mon Jun 29 14:22:59 2015 UTC,"For sure.  You explained one of the foundations of my opposition very well in your initial explanation (that the enforcement would serve as what would amount to be an extremely regressive tax).  More broadly, I don't associate voter turnout with a normative value one way or the other, while I do associate normative value with having an engaged voting population - which compulsory voting would discourage insofar as the people added to the voting population would be the least engaged, and as such would make the engaged voters a smaller percentage of the total votes cast.  An example of what I'm talking about goes back to the level of influence special interests have in government.  I think there are three key contributing factors to their influence that are often absent from common conversation - the centralization of government away from local and state governments into federal governments (as this comes at the expense of oversight by increasing the volume of activity in one place which can only be monitored so much, and creates literal distance between the government and the governed), the complexity of federal bureaucracy (largely a byproduct of the centralization I mentioned before, and this increases the influence of special interests in it gives outsized power to those with the resources to understand and manipulate this bureaucracy), and the hierarchical distance between the voters and the decisions of where their money and power are allocated (due to issues a and b).  The bulk of their influence doesn't come from influencing elected officials, but from knowing the person in the depths of the HHS or Defense bureaucracy who makes $65k/year and decides on the rules that ultimately determine the fates of multibillion dollar businesses.    These issues (the bureaucratic impacts of federal vs local governmental involvement) are about as far from sexy as you can get.  Even with the somewhat engaged population that currently votes, most ignore it entirely in favor of social issues and identity shibboleths.  You flood the ballots with people who think those cotton candy issues aren't sexy enough, and there won't be any semblance of a consideration about things like process.    That said, I'm also a philosophic anarchist (it's generally a cop-out ideology that recognizes that government is probably a necessary evil, but sees government as inherently evil and as such adopts what could be best described as a ""Meh, fuck it"" attitude).  I vote, but pretty universally write in people and bands like GG Allin or The Dwarves, and if there's no option to write in I undervote.  I point this out because I don't think, on a practical level, that voting matters.  I'm of the belief that the bulk of the decisions about our money and power happen at a level that precludes us from having any real level of influence, and so long as the decisions about what the money and power are used towards are made by people we're not able to sit down and have a conversation with the nature of our democracy is rooted in social mythology more than reality.  So there's a fair bit of cynicism underlying my approach."
Ask_Politics,3bgph4,philhartmonic,3,Mon Jun 29 16:08:38 2015 UTC,"Australian here, so let me weigh in with a couple of first hand views.  First, compulsory voting is not universally popular here. There are a significant section of the electorate that resent being forced to vote. Needless to say, the rate of invalid ballots is not very high (where people refuse to fill them or deface them).  Second, we have a preferential voting system, so you can select a range of candidates in order of your preference. This seems to make people happier with having to vote as they can exhaust their preferences.  Third, elections are held on a saturday, making it easy for most people to vote.  Fourth, postal votes are very easy to organise (see the comment on the electoral commission below - very well organised).  Fifth, voting is organised by the federal or the state electoral commissions - public authorities that manages the electoral rolls, the electoral boundaries, and oversees the voting and vote counting. This means you can vote at any booth. If it's a federal election - any booth in the country. If it's a state election - any booth in the state. They can find your name on the roll and give you the ballot papers for your registered electorate.  Sixth, it's pretty easy to get out of the fine for not voting - there are a lot of excuses you can use. It's just a pain.  Seventh, election days are awesome. The entire country has a collective day of civic duty. So, being Australia, this is becomes a massive sausage sizzle at every polling booth, then we all got to Don's place, have a BBQ, drink some beer, and either get drunk if the wrong people get in or get drunk and celebrate if the right people get in.  According to the sociologists, compulsory voting means greater enfranchisement for the lower SES groups, and this usually translates a few percentage points towards the left leaning parties. It also means that it tends to produce more centrist policies from the Governments in power or from the opposition parties because they know they don't have to 'energise the base.'   You usually hear about voluntary voting from the conservatives or the libertarians. The conservatives seem to also start requiring stronger laws for managing the electoral rolls and for providing ID when voting.  Here's a nice article with some background, https://theconversation.com/compulsory-voting-much-like-democracy-beats-the-alternatives-34765.

I would hate to see a US system imposed where the only people consistently going out to vote are very motivated voters because politics would get much more extreme and partisan. Politics in Australia is far more relaxed here and so things often get done to improve society with broad support.   The motivated voters in the US are also often extremely misinformed on issues but they still vote based on their beliefs. The huge proportion of less enthusiastic voters may not be the most informed but they understand enough to know when things are going well, who they support and who is just too nuts. It keeps politics in the mainstream and they act as a stabilising force. Also as for stupid voters just voting one way or another statistically it’s fairly evenly spread between both sides of politics so it’s not the biggest negative compared to the alternative of scrapping mandatory voting.

You had a Labor Government that for all intents and purposes had driven the nation into debt and had been propped up for three years by some independents in some right-wing electorates. They were on the verge of losing government just in seat numbers. On top of this are various Labor state governments in states like QLD and NSW that had been in power for a long time, were unpopular and were being convincingly thrown out for various reasons around this time. Then you add the carbon tax backflip by Gillard that for three years was part of a concerted attack on Labor to highlight its untrustworthiness.  Furthermore for three years Rudd and his supporters were apparently doing all sorts of stuff to undermine Gillard and in doing so were weakening Labor too. Lastly, the minute Gillard was removed Rudd was in not really in control of the party as many of the backbench and Cabinet MPs still opposed him.   In 2013 Labor was unpopular for the above reasons and others which they largely brought upon themselves. Abbot had surprisingly managed to be an extremely effective Opposition Leader in front of a united Liberal Party. In 2013 you had the Australian people looking at all of this and looking back at the Howard years of stability and economic good fortune wondering why they ever threw out the Liberals. All of this considered it’s no surprise they put Labor to the sword in 2013. Now of course they all realise what Abbot really is and things are swinging back but in 2013 they weren’t focused on Abbot.  Also if you’re highlighting the 2013 election for review I am going to assume you’re no fan of Abbot and the Liberals. Fair enough. But you should know that despite what people think about conservative voters being misinformed in this country the reality is that mandatory overwhelmingly helps the left-wing side of politics and the centre. There is a reason the US Democrats are always pushing to help make voting easier. It is minorities, young people, students and the poor who know where they stand and overwhelmingly support the left-wing Democrats but don’t actually come out and vote. The conservatives there may often be misinformed but they are reliable voters who will consistently show up for the Republicans. A similar effect would likely happen here.   The effect doesn’t end there though because it promotes polarisation. Look at the US system where you have only a third of the population is voting in some elections and it’s dominated by Christian conservatives and liberal activists that then sets the tone of the partisan atmosphere there were nothing gets done until one party pulls off an electoral landslide and takes full control.  As for the misinformed people I simply disagree. Most of the people who may not be motivated enough to vote if not forced are aware enough on where they stand. There are also realistically very few people that really can say they are really extremely informed on all aspects of the election anyway. How many people actually look at actual budgets and legislation etc.   Lastly people still have to register to vote so people have to give a shit on some minimal level."
Ask_Politics,3bg41r,jjake101,3,Sun Jun 28 22:39:16 2015 UTC,"That'd heavily depend on the state in question and the reason for withdrawal. More importantly, what kind of alliances does state X have? If state X is relatively isolationist, they could be ""rouge"" (there's no real internationally accepted criteria exist for designating a state like this, and no current countries would really fit the bill as a total outcast, at least not in the sense that leaving the UN would seem plausible*) and assuming that state X was pursuing something like extremely aggressive expansionist policies and building it's military enough, there'd be cause for a collective security measure, and if state X's presence threatens the members of the UNSC, there'd be no reason for them not to approve some sort of a collective action. You could also go the same route and impose legal and economic restrictions by the other UN members, plus the state would no longer receive any UN benefits.  Now, if state X DOES have a handful of political alliances, and enough that, at least in their mind, they have enough of a beneficial trade off by leaving the UN, a bunch of other states with similar grievances would leave at once, and the U.N. would end up disbanded in all except than in name. Or it would become just another name for an alliance of countries with special interests. Lets assume it's the US leaving, if I had to guess, I'd say that one between Russia and China (plus states within their sphere of influence) would become the de facto arbiter of what's left of the U.N., and that the others would leave and form its own organization. Plus the EU would immediately become way more relevant, and a lot of interest groups would start pushing hard for stronger collaboration between its members  If the UN is disbanded (even if it's an all but name thing), while no war would spark, at least not immediately, militarization would increase quickly. You can argue that it's ineffectual (but that's another long discussion), but the U.N. is the best tool, or at the very least, it's the most used platform for peaceful conflict resolution between states that we  currently have; without it, everyone from the policy makers to the citizens of developed world countries would start worrying a lot more about possible wars. There would be rapidly shifting alliances, perhaps never getting to true war but often skirting dangerously close to it.  There'd be no official precedent on how to handle it, there's only been two times a country has withdrawn from the UN, Syria (that was them absorbing into the UAR at the time so they didn't really leave as so much as they just formed a coalition) and Indonesia (which rejoined after less than a year when a coup overthrew their regime), and then the international community just treated Indonesia like it never really left  But honestly, as of right now, no country looks in a position to leave the UN, the UN offers far more benefits for participation in the international community than the potential gains of leaving the UN.  *Interestingly, Chomsky once argued that the US was a ""pariah state"" because of their actions in Iraq. There's a lot of problems with that since he was just using Gallup polls on international approval of Iraq. Which if there was such major rejection, why was any real action taken to ""punish"" the US by the rest of the international community. But I guess you can come to the argument, if a state has a hegemony and enough power to act alone with out the rest of the international community able to do anything, can they really even be a ""pariah"" and does it even really matter?"

Ask_Politics,3bg41r,Brickie78,3,Mon Jun 29 01:35:36 2015 UTC,"Not joining is an entirely different ball game than actively leaving. But again it'd entirely depend on the political climate, for the Swiss, not joining served to reinforce their status as a neutral state (although it did maintain observer status in the General Assembly and the ECOSOC and had attempted minor backroom pressure in the latter). With the ed of the Cold War and rapid globalization (in 02 I'd argue that the US was at it's height of hegemony) there were major incentives to participate.  I'm not trying to imply that the world will fall apart if the UN collapses, I'm saying it be an indicator of major shifts in world power if it happened."

Ask_Politics,3bd03v,NUTS_STUCK_TO_LEG,6,Sun Jun 28 01:31:26 2015 UTC,"The argument is that you can't have states banning something the federal government views as a protected right. Since in DC v heller the supreme court decided that guns which are in common use for lawful purposes are a constitutionally protected individual right, they shouldn't be able to be banned in any state. However, may types of guns which are in common use for lawful purposes are still banned in some states."
Ask_Politics,3bd03v,Ysance,5,Sun Jun 28 02:02:00 2015 UTC,"The problem with that line of argument is that it fundamentally misunderstands the way in which the Court applies, incorporates, or deals with various rights and freedoms. Moreover, it belies ignorance of previous 14th ammendment incorporation.   The Warren Court incorporated several amendments upon the states and the Court has applied different levels of scrutiny in a range of cases and instances. If one thing is always true it is that the Courts hands are never bound. If this Court wanted to incorporate the 2nd upon the states it has had the opportunity to do that.   This ruling no more sets rules for firearms ownership than it does set rules for sentencing requirements or medical licensure. Just because the Court has said that this one thing is broadly applicable doesn't mean that it will hold or must hold the same for literally any other issue. That's not how any of this works."

Ask_Politics,3bd03v,loudnoises461,2,Sun Jun 28 21:27:32 2015 UTC,"""Licenses"" is way too general for the Court. The right to marry and the right to own a firearm are two different things. And a ruling about one does not necessarily apply to another. They're not related. So Obergefell is not precedent as it applies to the second amendment. You could use it to argue, but it's so off point that it isn't precedent."
