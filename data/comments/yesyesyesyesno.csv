yesyesyesyesno,3d6giv,fortcocks,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:30:10 2015 UTC,My guess is the floaty bits were underwater up front (probably because of the choppy water). Probably caused a lot of drag up front and shit hit the fan when the fan hit the water.

I can't think of a single thing that would be useful about a helicopter that could land and take off from water. Like rescue missions and the like. Why would anyone want to land on the water and help people directly when they could just dangle from an awkward cable and pull people up one at a time while hanging from a precarious harness 50 feet in the air? Landing is dumb.   I personally believe all emergency calls on land should be handled with a professional dangling from a bungee cord too. Is there a cat stuck in a tree? Fuck going to get a ladder. That's way too complicated. Why would anyone go through all that? Surely it's much simpler to send a dude dangling from a glorified jump rope just below a giant whirling open-air death blender to scare the ever-living fuck out of your cat.

yesyesyesyesno,3bxofo,Jodandesu,8,Fri Jul 3 09:24:37 2015 UTC,I believe for that to work the runner has to be forced to run to the base by another teammate taking the base he was on. If he has a base he can get to safely he must be tagged before getting there.

yesyesyesyesno,3bxofo,Sehlstedt,9,Fri Jul 3 09:18:22 2015 UTC,"The runner (in blue) needs to touch the base before the fielder (in white) tags him with the ball.  The fielder gets the ball in time, and the usual play is to bring the glove down in front of the base.  If you put the glove between the runner and the base, that prevents the runner from touching the base without you touching him first.  The runner in this case, pulled his leg back.  The proper move for the fielder would be to stay calm, leave the glove in front of the base, and wait for the runner to run into it.  Instead, the fielder brings the glove up to tag him on the chest.  The moment he does this, the runner extends his leg and touches the base.  He does this more quickly than the fielder can get the tag on, and he is safe.  The runner in this case is Anthony Rizzo, firstbaseman for the Chicago Cubs."

yesyesyesyesno,3bg0my,ThankYouForPosting,4,Mon Jun 29 04:13:20 2015 UTC,And here I am sitting at home with a fractured pelvis from a track crash last week. :(  You can feel the sadness the stoker has before he goes down having no control and just holding onto the bars.
yesyesyesyesno,3bg0my,devilpants,3,Mon Jun 29 00:11:46 2015 UTC,Please forgive my ignorance. Are there no rear breaks on those bikes? Are your feet locked into the pedals so you can't get them out in time and somewhat catch your fall? Was there nothing they could have done? Or did they just want to finish?  Get better soon!
yesyesyesyesno,3bg0my,Meral_Harbes,4,Mon Jun 29 08:29:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not a bike expert, or these kind of competitive sport by any means... So other ppl correct me if I'm wrong.  The pedals have a strap so that you can also pull up as well as push down while pedaling instead of just push down like this. These bikes don't have breaks, but don't actually need one. They're fixed, so you just stop pedaling by force stops it. Imagine a kid's tricycle. It has more stopping power than typical breaks but you probably don't want to stop immediately when you're going ridiculously fast. I also assume having a second person slows the process down more since you can't decide by yourself.  They likely wouldn't have ""crashed"" if they started to stop once they heard the snapping/popping sound. But seems like they chose to keep on racing anyway. Then once the wheel started disintegrating, you can see them slowing down, but was a bit too late."

yesyesyesyesno,3ak1hr,Zambini,2,Mon Jun 22 06:49:24 2015 UTC,"Sasuke (TV series):       Sasuke (stylized in Japan as SASUKE) is a Japanese sports entertainment television special in which 100 competitors attempt to complete a four-stage obstacle course. An edited version, named Ninja Warrior, is screened in at least 18 other countries. To date, Sasuke content has been aired in 157 countries.  Shot on location at Midoriyama studio in Yokohama, it airs on TBS between Japanese television drama seasons. Each 3-hour special covers an entire competition; there are normally 100 participants. There have been 30 specials produced, approximately one new special per season (twice per year). The show is produced by Monster9 and is one of the spin-offs of Muscle Ranking (筋肉番付, Kinniku Banzuke ?), another sports entertainment competition, which airs on G4 under the name Unbeatable Banzuke. Until the 10th competition, Sasuke was broadcast as a special part of Muscle Ranking, but it became an independent program when Muscle Ranking was discontinued. The first competition was held indoors, marking the only time Sasuke did not take place outside. Competitions generally start in the daytime and continue until completed regardless of weather or darkness.  After Monster9's bankruptcy on November 2011, all rights to the show fell completely into the hands of its broadcaster, Tokyo Broadcasting System. Following their acquisition of all rights to Sasuke, TBS renamed the show Sasuke Rising.  There have been several programs related to Sasuke. Kunoichi, perhaps the most well-known spin off, is a version of Sasuke restricted to female competitors only. There have also been competitions held for children and the elderly.
