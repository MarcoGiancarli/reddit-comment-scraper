ArianaGrande,3cr4ql,Facu474,76,Fri Jul 10 02:42:42 2015 UTC,"At 0:27- ""...which is, like, not, I feel like, relative."" Does she mean relevant?  At 1:19- If she wants to apologize to her fans, that's fine. However, it would a lot more relevant if she apologized to the owner of the small business, the employee she was a rude and condescending bitch too, and the people who ate the doughnuts she contaminated.  At 2:52- ""It's been rough..."" No, she wasn't referring to the owner and the fallout he's experiencing, or the employee who has to serve assholes, or the patrons who need to get a medical check-up because they potentially ate contaminated food. She's talking about herself. Because it's all about her at the end of day, amirite?  TL;DW: 90% of what she talked about was her and her fans. 2% was about how she missed the mark talking about obesity in her apology. The other 8% was about gay marriage in America. 0% was about the owner, employee and other patrons of said doughnut shop."
ArianaGrande,3cr4ql,nearer_still,10,Fri Jul 10 08:15:33 2015 UTC,"I can't say that she might be the brightest, but the team around would definitely put emphasis on the idea that a direct apology to the owner is a guilty confession. Sounds daft, but it's legally sound in that sense."
ArianaGrande,3cr4ql,dFluxx,8,Fri Jul 10 21:26:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah.....what it boils down to is that she spent a lot of time saying she was going to apologize, and then she did NOT.   She also calls her disgusting actions ""mistakes"". That is always the mark of someone who isn't really sorry. Like the spit just accidentally rolled out of her mouth onto those donuts?   That little donut shop - the owner is a nice guy, btw - has actually been downgraded by the health dept because they sold donuts that Ariana Grande spit on. The shop itself is cleaner than most, and the donuts are great. So yeah - these are the people this little piglet should be apologizing to, not her ""babes"" and ""loves"". What the heck? Was she raised by wolves? And now her horde of fans are constantly visiting Wolfee's and cussing out the employees."
ArianaGrande,3cr4ql,Rubieroo,2,Sat Jul 11 19:23:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a good point. People who face criminal liability for their actions are usually evasive about talking about said actions.  However, I'm pretty sure she isn't facing any charges for being a rude, condescending asshole to the employee. She could have apologized to her in the video if she really wanted to do so."
ArianaGrande,3cr4ql,nearer_still,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:35:25 2015 UTC,"She definitely could apologize, and in my opinion she should have regardless. It's just against what her public team likely chose, and is a very small but subtle distinction she was probably not allowed to make.   Terrible behavior, though."
ArianaGrande,3cr4ql,dFluxx,-33,Sat Jul 11 21:01:55 2015 UTC,"I can't really understand how you can take such a positive gesture like she made with this video and pick it apart and doing nothing but criticize it. I watched it all the way and I thought it was really good of her to do this. She seemed sincere to me.    Basically I think this whole things is blown way out of proportion. If we would spend as much time going after crooked Wal Street swindlers and criminal banking executives as we do on a singer licking a muffin, the country and the world would look a lot better. People need to see things in perspective. How many people who wrecked the world economy have expressed remorse? Meanwhile Ariana has apologized twice, for doing something trivial.    We celebrate rappers with criminal histories which sometimes even include murder, but when a young girl licks a donut we lose our shit? I'm not saying it was okay what she did, I don't. But again: let's have some perspective.   Were we all saints? I'm with Bill Maher: I'm very glad I grew up in a time where there weren't people filming me all the time and then putting it online. I could make mistakes and do stupid things without it hauting me forever because some asshole uploaded it on the internet. I'm not at all in favor of publicly shaming like this.    So again: it wasn't right what she did, but we have all done a variation on this at one point in our lives. Let's not be holier-than-thou about it. She apologized, now let's leave it at that. No need to pick apart every word. Appreciate she apologized and move on.    Let the downvoting commence."
ArianaGrande,3cr4ql,Whooptheefuckingdoo,-8,Fri Jul 10 18:28:25 2015 UTC,I agree with this but again people don't like to see reason.
ArianaGrande,3cr4ql,Bloodedge99,-7,Sat Jul 11 03:40:15 2015 UTC,"I think she was sincere in the video, too. I think she sincerely feels bad about the fact that people are judging her for her actions and that her (former?) fans lost respect for and are disappointed in her. That's why she spent so much time in the video on those two things. Based on her actions up to this point, I don't think she feels sincerely apologetic toward the people directly affected by her actions in the doughnut shop. So, basically, I think she feels sorry for herself (the perpetrator ffs) and for people who admire her/her talent (people who are only related to the incident only in a tertiary manner)."
ArianaGrande,3cr4ql,nearer_still,-49,Sat Jul 11 20:40:12 2015 UTC,You're trying way too hard to find a problem with this. The channel was created for her fans. At least 90% of the subscribers are fans so it makes sense that she would address them.  It wouldn't be that sincere to apologize to the store on her fan channel rather than directly contacting them or in person.
ArianaGrande,3cr4ql,FormerBaristaSucks,15,Fri Jul 10 08:28:53 2015 UTC,"She herself said that her written apology was off-the-mark. Her introduction to her video apology made it seem like she was going to amend that in the video. She didn't.   Someone would just make the argument that it isn't sincere to apologize to the store on this video rather than directly contacting them or in person.   I'm not going to respond to a hypothetical person. If someone wants to come forward and make that argument, go ahead and I will engage you.  EDIT: (Oh, okay. You edited your comment while I was writing mine. So you're going to make that argument.)  Has she directly contacted the owner and employee? Not that I've heard. The owner seems pretty publicity friendly, so I think he would make it public if she did. Even if she wanted to, she couldn't contact the patrons she affected; a public statement is the only way to contact these people.  Where did I say she had to do it via video? I said that the fans (which she is contacting via video, which is perfectly fine) could use an apology, but the parties directly involved deserve one even more so; I did not say anything about the appropriate manner and medium to do so. I also wrote in my TL;DW that she didn't mention the owner, employee, or patrons; that is factually correct. I did not say anything in my TL;DW about apologies at all."
ArianaGrande,3cr4ql,nearer_still,-8,Fri Jul 10 09:11:59 2015 UTC,"Where did I say she had to do it via video? I said that the fans (which she is contacting via video, which is perfectly fine) could use an apology, but the parties directly involved deserve one even more so; I did not say anything about the appropriate manner and medium to do so.   One thing we do know it's a fan channel which would explain why she spent the majority addressing them. You criticized this video for not being directed at the store¹ but we don't know if it's her final words or if she is going to apologize to them separately. That's mainly why I mentioned that you're trying to hard to find a problem with this. It's a fair criticism if she never addresses those things, but this is a video that was just posted a few hours ago.      No, she wasn't referring to the owner and the fallout he's experiencing, or the employee who has to serve assholes, or the patrons who need to get a medical check-up because they potentially ate contaminated food.

ArianaGrande,3cr4ql,FormerBaristaSucks,2,Fri Jul 10 09:52:11 2015 UTC,"What I don't understand is why she is apologizing to her fans (who are only related to the incident on a tertiary level) before she apologizes the people directly involved in the incident (if she ever does at all). It's bizarre. She and her PR team need to get their priorities straight (unless their priority is $$$ from her fans or something). She faced a lot of criticism for her written apology. None among them were her not sufficiently talking about how badly the incident made her feel or how she did not apologize to her fans at sufficient length. As I wrote earlier: Her introduction to her video apology made it seem like she was going to amend [the mistakes she made in her written apology] [...]. She didn't.  Also, you need to learn the difference between ""referring"" and ""directed;"" they're not the same thing. I was talking about how evasive and unempathetic she was being, not that she wasn't addressing the owner, employee, or patrons directly.  She displayed a remarkable amount of self-centeredness in the video. She took the time out to tell us all how embarrassed she feels but she couldn't even bother to talk about what she did that was so embarrassing, why people are shaming her, or why it was wrong. No, no, no... she's going to talk about how bad she feels about people judging her."

First of all, we don't even know if or when she apologized to them or not. It's not hard to believe that it would handled in private. Not wise to jump up conclusions here.   She faced a lot of criticism for her written apology. None among them were her not sufficiently talking about how badly the incident made her feel or how she did not apologize to her fans at sufficient length.   This could suggest that she's saying what she feels right, and not going down a checklist of what people expect her to say. The point of this video could be to give a more personal response.   As I wrote earlier: Her introduction to her video apology made it seem like she was going to amend [the mistakes she made in her written apology] [...]. She didn't   Well too bad it didn't live up to your expectations?   I was talking about how evasive and unempathetic she was being, not that she wasn't addressing the owner, employee, or patrons directly.   Not addressing what you expected doesn't mean she was evading it. Perhaps she just wasn't following your expectations on how she should apologize.

ArianaGrande,3cr4ql,Whooptheefuckingdoo,5,Fri Jul 10 23:52:12 2015 UTC,"(It's Wolfee Donuts in Lake Elsinore)  The owner has said that sales have gone up since the video surfaced, but the buzz is only temporary. Sales will be good for another week or two, until people lose interest in the story. The downgrade from the sanitation department will still be there though.  The store will most likely lose business for a longer period of time than what they will experience in increased business from the ""Ariana Grande licked a donut here"" buzz that is bringing in customers now."
ArianaGrande,3cr4ql,-OP_pls-,-3,Sat Jul 11 01:05:44 2015 UTC,"And you had to Google that, I'm sure.    How does the store gets a downgrade for something the store-owner didn't do? Does the department now assumes that all day every day, people are licking donuts over there? :') It happened once. I'm sure the whole story isn't infected now."
ArianaGrande,3cr4ql,Whooptheefuckingdoo,2,Sat Jul 11 08:16:05 2015 UTC,"I actually live kinda close to Lake Elsinore and said donut shop, so our local news mentioned the name of the shop.   I really don't know how the sanitation dept. decides to do these things, but I'm guessing they did that because the store allowed the donut licking to happen to them. They left the trays of donuts on top of the counter instead of in the display, and turned their backs on the customers. Then she licked the donuts, and they eventually left.  The store didn't review the tape until after, so I think that A) the employees left the donuts out in the open and were licked, and B) the thought that it went unnoticed and they could have been purchased by another customer, is the reason for the grade changing."

ArianaGrande,3cr4ql,AzorAhai777,29,Sat Jul 11 10:23:31 2015 UTC,Oh I don't know.  An apology that actually addresses the business in question? One that isn't mostly a little heart to heart with her slav- ... fans.

You think what she did was OK and fine when really its a felony and cost the donut shop money on something they could have sold. Why do you think you keep getting downvoted, its because you blindly follow her thinking she is amazing and perfect. Yet she IS a stuck up bitch and she DOESNT care about any of her fans. Do you know what you and all her other fangirls are to her. A cashcow. That's it, that's all she thinks of you, as someone that gives her money."

If i was famous i wouldn't really care about my fans, i would say I did but at the end of the day all i would want is money, if she truly cares about her fans, stop selling the records give them away, let people pirate them and just get a normal job to earn money while having singing as a hobby. simple"

Don't care for her music or tv shows, but she's smoking hot, so count me in. But that doesn't mean I'm going to join in on the bashing.    She did a stupid thing, didn't we all when we were young? She apologized, now people are still not happy. Some people just want to have somebody they can point fingers at, so they can feel like Good People.    If people can overlook Roman Polanski being a child rapist and still watch his movies, I think they can forgive Ariana for licking a muffin. She shouldn't have done it, but in the grand scheme of things it's very insignificant. It only show that way, way too many people have too much time on their hands and are too attracted to trivial nonsense.    If only all these people would devote the same amount of energy and outrage at the finanicial and political system, the world would look very different. But noooo, let's go after a pop singer, because she's so important, right..?"

As an advocate for healthy eating, food is very important to me and I sometimes get upset by how freely we as Americans eat and consume things without giving any thought to the consequences that it has on our health and society as a whole.   You're in a damn donut shop. The very nature of your appearance there proves you condone unhealthy eating because otherwise you wouldn't bother to show your face in a place like that.   This is shifting the blame away from what's actually being criticized, and quite frankly pisses me off to no end, she didn't say that shit because she hates how unhealthy people eat, she was trying to be funny with her friends and then that shit blew up in her face when people didn't like it very much, at least accept your behavior for being shitty first before you apologize."

The ""America"" comment is just one of many issues that occurred.  Ariana behaved poorly numerous times in a situation where she probably never thought in her wildest dreams would end up on the internet.  She got caught and instead of owning up to her various mistakes that she made (and there were many), she sidestepped and came up with a excuse that is very easy to see through.  As I previously stated, I believe people would have more respect for her if she owned up to behaving poorly throughout her time in the doughnut shop and stopped making excuses for her actions.  I believe that you, specifically, have an emotional attachment to Ariana that makes it impossible for you to separate your emotions and look at the situation impartially.

She didn't bring it up at all. I mean, to lick other people's doughnuts without them knowing... it's kind of a shitty thing to do. The fact that she didn't own up to that (among numerous other actions in the video) reflects poorly on her. /u/BenR1990 is absolutely right; she sidestepped and came up with one very thin excuse for the one thing in the video she and her PR team thought they could use to deflect attention from her."

Even if you cannot bring yourself to reply to me, I hope I have not tainted /u/BenR1990 as well in your eyes.  EDIT 2: Unfortunately, I don't know to which comment(s) of mine you're referring. All I can say is, I have never ""admitted [that I] don't have any prior knowledge of Ariana's behavior."" Nor have I been ""presenting [my] interpretation as reality.""  I would greatly appreciate it if you replied to the actual comment(s) where you got that idea. By bringing those things up in this thread, you've managed to evade the issues at hand.

ArianaGrande,3cl04c,Derbinswithamustach,15,Thu Jul 9 00:34:48 2015 UTC,"Her comments don't bother me, she obviously wasn't serious and said it in a sarcasty, jokey way. Its that she licked a donut that was meant for other people to eat."

ArianaGrande,3cl04c,body_talk,7,Wed Jul 8 20:13:47 2015 UTC,Licking donuts at a donut shop fights obesity in America?  Right.
ArianaGrande,3cl04c,TheRealF0xE,8,Thu Jul 9 00:31:34 2015 UTC,ITT: realists vs white knights  We're all just here cause she's hot anyway. My 2¢ is that she is a huge public figure that got caught acting inappropriately and instead of owning up to it she had to go the safe route and make a generalized public statement.
ArianaGrande,3cl04c,Derbinswithamustach,-1,Thu Jul 9 01:23:57 2015 UTC,"Ah, the old call people you don't agree with a white knight defense."
ArianaGrande,3cl04c,BassCreat0r,7,Fri Jul 10 22:28:21 2015 UTC,"I would like to start out by saying that I believe that in today's society the PC crowd is soooo easily offended and is boarders completely embarassing. That being said this was the exact WRONG way to handle this. It goes without saying this is definitely a prepared statement used to push the blame on something else. If you want to put out a heartfelt sincere apology admit to acting like a little shit and apologize. Using negative pub to push it off onto another issue is a PR move and not admitting to one's faults.  All the fangirls/boys whom are playing it off like she's still perfectly fine and did nothing wrong, get over yourselves she effed up much like people do it's just a fact that she's a public figure and should be better about her actions.  Everybody giving her helacious amounts of shit, nobody is damn perfect, not that what she said is right and smart but I'm sure you've managed to spit out something incredibly stupid at the wrong moment too."
ArianaGrande,3cl04c,Z-Tay,2,Wed Jul 8 23:40:32 2015 UTC,in today's society the PC crowd is soooo easily offended and is boarders completely embarassing.   People always say this but people are way harder to offend nowadays than they were in the past.
ArianaGrande,3cl04c,SMC3694,0,Thu Jul 9 11:32:31 2015 UTC,Must be a location thing or something. Social media is offended by everything and I can't go around making a joke about Jared from Subway being the next spokesman for Neverland without someone being offended

ArianaGrande,3cl04c,AFabledHero,5,Thu Jul 9 15:47:17 2015 UTC,Most of us aren't fans of her because of her personality or her personal beliefs.  She's a hot chick that we find attractive.  That's it that's all.  She does sing well but none of us really care about that.
ArianaGrande,3cl04c,BigStereotype,0,Thu Jul 9 00:50:04 2015 UTC,"i'd pay $2,500 for that donut she licked."
ArianaGrande,3cl04c,AFabledHero,-1,Wed Jul 8 23:37:09 2015 UTC,She should make it up to us by leaking some pics
ArianaGrande,3cl04c,IrishLuke765,-12,Thu Jul 9 03:21:51 2015 UTC,"Since it isn't a photo, I'm sure it will be removed. But this is my message to the media outlets and gossip columns everywhere, because they are exactly what is wrong with America and this story.   Yes, Ariana can be a bitch. We all can. But this is a blatant attempt to be upset at something because the mentality of most Americans these days is the incessant need to be victimized by something. Nobody can just be happy.   I'm not justifying her licking the food, but if they bought it all, then who cares. What I am justifying is her right to say ""what the fuck is that"" when looking at giant disgusting bacon covered donuts, or that she hates America because of the same simple reasons we ALL say that when referring to the disgusting obesity and laziness that makes us a laughing stock to the rest of the world. She didn't cuss at the employee, and she didn't claim allegiance with ISIS either. Making her the bad guy for doing the same thing any one of us would do in any private moment with our friends is just another reason to ""hate"" America. I'd expect the next thing we hear about this is a lawsuit from the poor devastated hourly employee that was offended by the harsh language.  If you or I walked in to that store and did the same thing, and said the same thing, the store wouldn't sell their security tape to tmz. That is just another reason to ""hate"" America. Looking for a quick buck, being victimized by hearing somebody cuss, and being offended that someone disagrees with America's infatuation with eating their way to congestive heart failure by age 40.  For the record, I'm an Army Veteran. I served my country, and I still ""hate"" this crybaby butt hurt attitude that everyone thinks they are entitled to.  Stop feeling victimized by every little thing. Stop looking for a problem with everyone and everything. Let people freely express their opinions without the social shit storm of offended people. Just grow the fuck up already."
ArianaGrande,3cl04c,AFabledHero,-12,Wed Jul 8 22:20:31 2015 UTC,You hit the nail on the head. Pathetic move by the media and just ridiculous how many people believe she literally hates America from that.
ArianaGrande,3cl04c,IrishLuke765,-7,Wed Jul 8 22:34:03 2015 UTC,"yup the amount of hate she's getting over a licked donut is ridiculous, if she did this in any other country no one would care or get mad at her 😔"

ArianaGrande,3cl04c,AFabledHero,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:56:53 2015 UTC,"Fuck whatever a written PR statement deflecting blame is. She should have just gone to those employees n been like ""yo, that's my bad."" I would only expect that from a public figure, btw, although if a friend of mine acted that way, I probably wouldn't hang out with them for a long while. It's embarrassing, dude."
ArianaGrande,3cl04c,IrishLuke765,-7,Wed Jul 8 23:04:25 2015 UTC,Acted like what? Just licking a donut on a dare? That upsets you that much? Do you hear how stupid that sounds? The uproar that this has caused on here is exactly why people make fun of Reddit. lol

ArianaGrande,39n48q,SirJohnBob,-2,Sat Jun 13 20:28:59 2015 UTC,"1 rep is 20 so 60 × 20 = 1200.  So your lifiting and dropping 450 lbs 1200 times in 30 seconds? That is 40 lifts/second./r/thathappened  Edit: I messed up, but it's still lifting 450lbs 2 or more/second"
ArianaGrande,39n48q,s7d,3,Sun Jun 14 02:15:33 2015 UTC,Why are you multiplying by 20? 1 rep = 1 full movement.

ArianaGrande,396yll,partialinsanity,10,Tue Jun 9 21:41:08 2015 UTC,Maybe she shouldn't use her body (and the lack of clothing) as one of her main selling points. That would be a step in the right direction.
ArianaGrande,396yll,naukey,4,Tue Jun 9 22:09:43 2015 UTC,Her whole point is that if she does that she shouldn't be judged for that because that's who she wants to be and how she wants to be. And she's right.  And here you are judging her and proving her point.
ArianaGrande,396yll,comethrowitaway,3,Tue Jun 9 23:09:31 2015 UTC,Doesn't want to be judged but dresses sexy and includes her chest in every picture.
ArianaGrande,396yll,charizard6377,2,Tue Jun 9 23:15:34 2015 UTC,Why would anyone judge her for that?
ArianaGrande,396yll,partialinsanity,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:10:24 2015 UTC,"My point is she makes a big speech about how men should not judge her or women but in doing so she is judging men in exactly the way she does not want men to judge women, for example she said ""if a women has a lot of sex she's a slut"" I have not said that and I know a lot of men who would never say that either so she is judging me and others without anything to back it up. She and anyone who thinks like this is sexist and a hypocrite."
ArianaGrande,396yll,charizard6377,2,Wed Jun 10 22:17:28 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, stop.  You were raised in a patriarchal society. That means you're inevitably going to have learnt some prejudices and double standards when it comes to how you view women — everyone does, feminists included. Messages like Ariana's are necessary to expose and challenge sexist attitudes in our society. The sad truth is that sexism often isn't blatant or obvious or deliberate; it comes about because people don't think critically about the status quo.  Instead of insisting that you ""would never say that,"" you should examine your attitudes towards women's sexuality and see if there's anything you could stand to improve. If not: great! The message does not apply to you and you're free to go about your day. But a) there probably is room for improvement; and b) there are plenty of men out there who aren't perfect and could really stand to learn something from this message, so it clearly does have value."
ArianaGrande,396yll,K9GM3,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:48:31 2015 UTC,"But can you not see that even this message you have sent is sexist as in you are supporting a sexist it may not be ""blatant or obvious or deliberate"" but it is there. I support women's rights as much as possible but there are things women want to be equal in but not others, for example women want equal numbers of high paid executives but not equal numbers of the low paid jobs like working at the dump. Another example would be sports we have separate men and women's sports for a reason but technically that reason is sexist by saying women cant play on the same level as men(which is true because of physical limitations). Men are not superior and neither are women both have things they are better at. I have also yet to see a true example of sexism."
ArianaGrande,396yll,charizard6377,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:35:28 2015 UTC,"even this message you have sent is sexist as in you are supporting a sexist   Highlighting the existence of sexism is not itself sexist. If you go to the police to report that your wallet was stolen, they don't put you into cuffs for theft. When a feminist says: ""Men judge women for having a lot of sex, which is a double standard,"" they're talking about the general societal attitude. Of course there are women who judge other women, and of course there are men who don't. But if we were to say: ""Some men judge women for having a lot of sex, which is a double standard,"" it would be too easy for a man to think: ""Oh, it's only some men. I don't do that, so I don't have to worry about it,"" when in fact he does.   for example women want equal numbers of high paid executives but not equal numbers of the low paid jobs like working at the dump.   That's because women already have access to low paid dump jobs. The glass ceiling prevents women from receiving promotions to the high-level jobs, not from being hired into entry-level ones.   I have also yet to see a true example of sexism.   So... saying that sexism exists is sexist towards men, but at the same time there's no such thing as true sexism? It feels like you have some doublethink going on here."
ArianaGrande,396yll,K9GM3,-1,Sat Jun 13 08:46:38 2015 UTC,"First you are not ""Highlighting the existence of sexism"" you are past of it, second who is part of this general societal attitude and how do you measure it? Your thinking that women cant get the higher paid jobs or getting into entry level jobs is biased on what exactly? While I have not seen a true example of sexism I always like to point out that if you want it to exist it works both ways. I have yet to see actual proof/evidence of someone for example being denied a job because they are a certain gender and if you could provide this it would go along way to proving your point."
ArianaGrande,396yll,charizard6377,0,Sat Jun 13 22:39:26 2015 UTC,"Here's a list of companies and how many women are on their board of directors.  Out of the 1863 companies on that list, 1060 (56.9%) have 1 or 0 women on their board of directors. Only nine companies (0.48%) have a board comprised at least half of women.   who is part of this general societal attitude and how do you measure it?   The general societal attitude are the values and opinions held by the visible elements of society. For example, fashion shows, advertisements and modelling dolls tend to showcase only thin bodies, so the general societal attitude is that thin bodies are thought of as normal and appealing. Does that explain it?   While I have not seen a true example of sexism I always like to point out that if you want it to exist it works both ways.   If I want it to exist? I'd rather it didn't exist, but it does, and that's not going to change unless it's exposed and challenged."

ArianaGrande,38wq0y,xDirtyyyy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:34:57 2015 UTC,Helluva lot faster than undoing belts and such. And it keeps your pants from falling down.
ArianaGrande,38wq0y,kronaz,13,Wed Jun 10 10:20:57 2015 UTC,But she doesn't want to be seen as a sex object...
ArianaGrande,38wq0y,AFabledHero,3,Sun Jun 7 21:20:32 2015 UTC,Got a link to her saying this?

ArianaGrande,38wq0y,AFabledHero,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:37:35 2015 UTC,This didn't say she doesn't want to be seen as a sex object. It says she doesn't like women being shamed or labled as a slut if they're open about sex.

ArianaGrande,38wq0y,99Silver,2,Mon Jun 8 14:35:12 2015 UTC,She's very beautiful. But the lighting in the picture #3 combined with her head in that position makes it look like someone Photoshoped her face onto her body. Anyone else notice this?
ArianaGrande,38wq0y,amazingD,-2,Fri Jun 12 16:32:56 2015 UTC,she looks more like Nicki Minaj every day.
ArianaGrande,38wq0y,billyultra,-3,Mon Jun 8 01:31:55 2015 UTC,Aren't those like the little wings that the menstrual pads have ?
ArianaGrande,38wq0y,FluffyWof,-33,Sun Jun 7 21:38:39 2015 UTC,"She's definitely gained weight; she's got a tiny bit more around her jaw, almost a double chin, and her legs and arms look thicket too. Not saying that's a bad thing though,but it's quite obvious!"

ArianaGrande,34rl5o,iamthecman,8,Sun May 3 23:53:48 2015 UTC,Her vocals on intro are so so good. I like tattooed heart and break your heart right back too. It kinda switches a lot because I have a horrible habit of overplaying my favorite songs.

ArianaGrande,34czqi,Y0UNG_W0NDER,8,Thu Apr 30 18:48:44 2015 UTC,"Her natural skin color was much better, in my opinion. I just don't like tans. I also think that she uses too much makeup nowadays. It's sad because she has such a pretty face, and it's like she's trying to hide it.  People keep criticizing her weight loss, but I personally don't care about that. She looked great before and she still looks great now, I don't know what people are afraid of. She looks healthy, she sure as hell doesn't look like someone who has an eating disorder."

ArianaGrande,30xplg,MattMau5,8,Tue Mar 31 18:31:15 2015 UTC,She specifically mentioned that she wanted to have time for fans on these meet and greets. You'll definitely have enough time to you to ask your question and you get three pictures max.
ArianaGrande,30xplg,jaibrooks1,3,Tue Mar 31 19:31:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't really know. I know she respects how loyal her fans are, and when she was still getting started she did a bunch of meet and greets and such for free, but that seems like a whole lot of money to just get a few pictures. Just because she wants to have time for them doesn't necessarily guarantee that she will."

ArianaGrande,2zf1i6,DarkOpera,1 point,Wed Mar 18 11:20:00 2015 UTC,Well the gif is cool. What I'm really focused on is: is your name and archer reference? Please say yes.
ArianaGrande,2zf1i6,NothingThatIs,3,Wed Mar 18 22:59:43 2015 UTC,"What? No it's not from archer. It's a TV show on Fox. Pretty popular, actually more popular than archer according to viewership and ratings. So I'm pretty sure it's more likely it about the show than some connection to Archer."
ArianaGrande,2zf1i6,iamdillyj,1 point,Thu Mar 19 01:25:00 2015 UTC,"... Never heard of it.   In the opening of season 4 of Archer he slips into a fugue state as a man named Bob, who owns a burger joint ('Bob's burgers' I believe) and that's what I thought of first."
ArianaGrande,2zf1i6,NothingThatIs,2,Thu Mar 19 02:31:49 2015 UTC,I think they did a crossover episode.
ArianaGrande,2zf1i6,iamdillyj,2,Thu Mar 19 02:36:26 2015 UTC,Hmm yeah maybe! I will look it up (mobile rn)
ArianaGrande,2zf1i6,NothingThatIs,2,Thu Mar 19 02:42:29 2015 UTC,I think they did. On mobile tol. Sorry if I came off like an asshole. Was just trying to correct you. It's hard to not look like an asshole while correcting someone.
ArianaGrande,2zf1i6,iamdillyj,1 point,Thu Mar 19 03:02:15 2015 UTC,"No worries dude! I'm more surprised that people have taken the time to downvote the original comment lol. If I had known Bob's Burgers was a thing, the whole opening scene probably would've made more sense as a cameo type deal."
ArianaGrande,2zf1i6,NothingThatIs,1 point,Thu Mar 19 04:33:11 2015 UTC,Not sure why you got downvoted. It was just a simple question. At least you added a discussion to the usual nonexistent comment section in this subreddit.

ArianaGrande,2zcge9,turtwig316,8,Wed Mar 18 01:00:19 2015 UTC,"Here is an article that somewhat explains it. Here is a little web series Jennette made, if you watch episode 3 starting at about 3:00 you see a character that is believed to be Ariana."
ArianaGrande,2zcge9,MrWhiteAKAHeisenberg,2,Wed Mar 18 01:38:57 2015 UTC,"that's defintely ariana, thanks."
ArianaGrande,2zcge9,turtwig316,1 point,Wed Mar 18 01:54:15 2015 UTC,"This topic come up again and Jennette said that they butted heads, but in a ""sisterly way."" That seems to be a bit of an odd thing to put it. Between the two, Jennette had been more vocal, making it seem the animosity was mostly or completely on her end when compared to the fact that Ariana seemed to keep her mouth shut about (despite those persistent diva rumours). So for her to say something to downplay it is reassuring, but kind of confusing."

ArianaGrande,2ypyr5,grilsrgood,16,Wed Mar 11 21:03:03 2015 UTC,It was bound to happen sooner or later with the heels she performs in
ArianaGrande,2ypyr5,bluewolf37,21,Thu Mar 12 01:32:09 2015 UTC,It wasn't her heels; the platform she stepped up on actually fell off.

ArianaGrande,2ypyr5,Soccrnike10,1 point,Thu Mar 12 01:39:51 2015 UTC,Even when she falls she plays it off so elegantly and professionally.
ArianaGrande,2yro2f,RaspberryFanta,5,Thu Mar 12 06:04:15 2015 UTC,"The song is sped up quite a bit to get around YouTube copyright. It sounds much better at normal speed...  Also while I love this song and Ari, her part in this song was minor and could've been done by many different female vocalists and come out just as well. She only sings the hook, and has no real ""verse"", so I don't really get why it matters if she wrote it herself or not. The lyrics of the hook are not impressive or anything.   I still have to hide, hide, hide, hide  Now you next to me at night, night, night, night  You test me all the time, time, time, time  Say I know what you like, like I did the last time  Do you remember? Do you remember?  Do you remember? Do you remember?  When you have nothing to hide, hide, hide, hide   Like I said, love Ari and I think her and Big Sean are a good pair... but this song is nothing to worship her over.  Here is an interesting lyric from another song on Sean's new album   I ain't even gonna lie, I got a million dollar chick  With a billion dollar pussy  Every time I cum, I swear to God I feel like I be rich"
ArianaGrande,2yro2f,Lettuce_Addict,2,Thu Mar 12 22:09:20 2015 UTC,I just think it's cute that they wrote it together :)

The close up of her face towards the end is unflattering and they push that hairy man down too much, why is his secret lab adjacent to these civilians home that ari and boy are trekking through for some reason. Idk. It wasnt bad. Just not great."

You generally can tell the size of someones chest, hell their general height, weight etc, if you are around them all day every day. This is in all honesty a junior high level comeback at best."
ArianaGrande,2vcysy,bryntheskits,42,Tue Feb 10 04:58:25 2015 UTC,Spend a lot of time looking at weak burns dont you?

There's really nothing to take from his comment.   Regardless if this kid stares at his 9 year old sisters chest (which I don't think he does) it doesn't change the fact that Ari has a concave chest.   It's irrelevant since there's nothing wrong with having a small body."
ArianaGrande,2vcysy,jaibrooks1,2,Tue Feb 10 03:09:55 2015 UTC,What did I say?
ArianaGrande,2vcysy,jaibrooks1,2,Tue Feb 10 03:03:37 2015 UTC,I'm really just pointing out why his reasoning is illogical. I don't think Ariana's joke was fantastic or anything.
ArianaGrande,2vcysy,jaibrooks1,20,Tue Feb 10 03:51:32 2015 UTC,"you might think you're getting downvoted because of the inherent pro-ari circlejerk in here, but you're actually getting downvoted because your comment is idiotic.  that said, OP's post is pretty stupid too."

This was meant to be a fun homage, not a bold artistic statement to rival the joy, brilliance and majesty of Freddie Mercury.  Because of this cover I myself have been listening to more Queen today (currently listening to ""The Prophet's Song"" as I type this).  This performance was good exposure and things like this help keep the legacy of Queen alive for new generations.  Great link by the way."

I would have killed many people to be in his shoes in that video but I would not have immediately attempted to kiss her on the lips. She's not my girlfriend and we don't know each other. I would have been fine with a kiss on the cheek.  Still would have done many things to be able to give her a kiss on the cheek!"

ArianaGrande,2sr11q,Chich_Vu,25,Sat Jan 17 17:59:17 2015 UTC,What is with the comments in the original post on /r/celebs? Reddit has a strange obsession with big butts and cannot seem to fathom that some people might like something different than what they do.
ArianaGrande,2sr11q,idontknowziz,38,Sat Jan 17 22:27:11 2015 UTC,"Please tell that to my friends. When ever I bring up my obsession of Ariana to them they tell my that I'm a pepedophile and like 12 year old girls.   Belive it or not, some men like petite women. Not every fucking woman needs huge tits or a big ass to be attractive"
ArianaGrande,2sr11q,conrad530,7,Sun Jan 18 08:00:57 2015 UTC,"Dude, I'm also into Kpop, where girls are even smaller than Ariana. I hate how people try to shame me when I'm attracted to very small women"
ArianaGrande,2sr11q,Ranger107,2,Sun Jan 18 10:48:26 2015 UTC,Is there a subreddit for Kpop girls?
ArianaGrande,2sr11q,holyshitlia,6,Sun Jan 18 14:06:42 2015 UTC,/r/kpopfap is what you're looking for.
ArianaGrande,2sr11q,kl3y,5,Sun Jan 18 14:21:50 2015 UTC,I prefer /r/kpics personally

ArianaGrande,2sr11q,titaniumwings,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:40:33 2015 UTC,"Never made sense to me. I like cute and petite girls too. Doesn't mean you want to date children, that's ridiculous."
ArianaGrande,2sr11q,UnknownVX,2,Sun Feb 22 13:48:31 2015 UTC,"It's hilarious you replied to this comment. Just a week ago, this lady at a place where I was getting tea saw my wallpaper (of a thin korean singer) and went on a rant of how I'm sexually attracted to children and than I'm a pervert blah blah blah. Took her 3 minutes for me to finally say the person in my wallpaper is older than me!"
ArianaGrande,2sr11q,Ranger107,1 point,Sun Feb 22 13:53:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think Korean girls are gorgeous. Small, petite, perky, youthful healthy appearances with that innocent girl next door look.   I guess people can't separate the age (and mental immaturity) aspect from the youthful appearance. The former is why it's wrong to date young girls, not the latter."
ArianaGrande,2sr11q,UnknownVX,1 point,Mon Feb 23 07:33:38 2015 UTC,"I mean, a huge thing too, is they look youthful but you can tell they're older a large majority of tbe time. By their eyes or whatnot, it's not like they have the look of a younger person."
ArianaGrande,2sr11q,Ranger107,1 point,Mon Feb 23 07:59:44 2015 UTC,"At any rate, don't let it bother you too much. People love to judge others, it makes them feel better about themselves and their own insecurities."
ArianaGrande,2sr11q,UnknownVX,3,Mon Feb 23 11:12:56 2015 UTC,You're totally justified too. Normally I don't like tiny girls but Ariana is pretty damn hot.
ArianaGrande,2sr11q,WTFuckAreU,1 point,Sun Jan 18 14:03:45 2015 UTC,"Like others here, I don't usually like small women, but Ariana just has those features that make me attracted. I can't explain what they are, she's just that type. I am into curvy women, thank God that my girlfriend is.  My girlfriend still (after 3 years) does not believe that I like Ariana only for her voice and her looks. Of course she has to bring up all of the sexual stuff..."
ArianaGrande,2sr11q,Squerl101,-1,Wed Jan 21 07:44:58 2015 UTC,Please tell that to my friends. When ever I bring up my obsession of Ariana to them they tell my that I'm a pepedophile and like 12 year old girls.    Don't be ashamed 12 year old girls deserve love too 😄
ArianaGrande,2sr11q,jlray,5,Wed Jan 21 00:55:51 2015 UTC,that place is a cesspool of stupidity. Any ariana pic that gets posted there gets a ton of comments insulting her and calling her ugly.

ArianaGrande,2sr11q,The_sad_zebra,10,Sat Jan 17 21:28:03 2015 UTC,She's probably not. It's just common for the person singing the national anthem to wear the home team's jersey.
ArianaGrande,2sr11q,rhcp88,5,Sun Jan 18 00:53:09 2015 UTC,She's not (that I'm aware of).  She was performing at the opening game of the season in Seattle and wore the jersey.
ArianaGrande,2sr11q,Omgcorgitracks,6,Sat Jan 17 23:20:08 2015 UTC,She used to have more of a curvy figure then she got older and she thinned out. She's still pretty tho
ArianaGrande,2sr11q,lammermon,2,Sat Jan 17 20:30:24 2015 UTC,this is true tho
ArianaGrande,2ss8zv,matinphipps,5,Sun Jan 18 00:26:46 2015 UTC,"What're you trying to say exactly? Like, what point are you trying to make?"
ArianaGrande,2ss8zv,jaibrooks1,7,Sun Jan 18 02:23:14 2015 UTC,"The point that he is trying to make it that nothing says ""Merry Christmas"" like a chick in her underwear with antlers on her head spreading her legs and gyrating on stage, especially when she honed those ""skills"" before she turned 21."
ArianaGrande,2ss8zv,jnskw,3,Sun Jan 18 02:56:44 2015 UTC,"jesus christ are you 80 or something, ari's just having fun let her be."
ArianaGrande,2sqma9,TheBestClem,2,Sat Jan 17 15:38:58 2015 UTC,Why does her head look so big? It almost looks shopped.
ArianaGrande,2sqma9,alternate30,0,Sat Jan 17 20:14:39 2015 UTC,Depth perception. The smaller object in front of her face throws your brain's depth perception off.

ArianaGrande,2sfl9i,Ravenman2423,0,Thu Jan 15 06:50:03 2015 UTC,That's a bad picture.  She doesn't need all that makeup at all.  Sounds cliche but it's true.
ArianaGrande,2sfl9i,AriSweg,1 point,Thu Jan 15 07:50:02 2015 UTC,"Yea she does, she is just like any other girl with acne."
ArianaGrande,2sfl9i,Ravenman2423,2,Thu Jan 15 14:00:45 2015 UTC,"... And most girls really don't need half as much makeup as they put on.  I hate saying it because I sound like a ""nice guy"" from tumblr or some shit, but it's true.  Guys don't wear makeup and we've got acne.  So what if girls have a bit too? Not saying don't wear any at all but sometimes girls wear so much that it's actually more off putting than a bit of acne.  Idk,  just my opinion."
ArianaGrande,2sfl9i,jaibrooks1,2,Thu Jan 15 16:23:21 2015 UTC,You should realize this is part of a professional photoshoot.

ArianaGrande,2s8f6y,TheDutchTank,1 point,Tue Jan 13 04:55:24 2015 UTC,I think it's around $100 extra but it depends on what your seat is and other factors. They have the prices on Ticketmaster.
ArianaGrande,2s8f6y,jaibrooks1,1 point,Tue Jan 13 05:26:25 2015 UTC,In Köln it was 1500 Euros. It's a bit more than you think.

ArianaGrande,2rtiq9,QuantrelBitchop,1 point,Fri Jan 9 08:40:02 2015 UTC,ok maybe the words big deal we're an exaggeration. but it was kind of odd how this version seemed to just disappear. I know they say what happens on the internet stays on the internet but with all these RIAA and DMCA anti piracy laws that phrase has lost a lot of its meaning. I miss the days of direct downloading now you got all this torrent stuff that I don't even know the first thing about. I miss FTP sites

ArianaGrande,2rnmp2,jaibrooks1,3,Thu Jan 8 01:53:23 2015 UTC,I understand that it's a part of a fantasy. Having dreams is healthy. But you want dreams that you can take actions to achieve and make progress on. And that aren't so cringey.
ArianaGrande,2rnmp2,BKDenied,1 point,Thu Jan 8 02:06:55 2015 UTC,Are you really attempting to tell someone what kind of dreams they wants?
ArianaGrande,2rnmp2,AriSweg,3,Wed Jan 7 23:13:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you saw the original, but this is what it said.   ""Darling, please stay. You are my only escape... You are my everything. You saved me. And I am forever indebted to you. I... I love you.""  While my bluntness and brevity can very easily be misconstrued and has led to him deleting the comments, it was said. In his reply, he stated this,  ""She's already walking away. This is my last attempt to get her to love me again. You just don't get it. Should I make a comment about how hot her ass is? Would that get me more upvotes and make girls like me?""   There were 3 factors that kinda tipped me off and pushed me to saying that. ""You... Everything. You saved. I ... indebted to you"" He's putting everything on an outside factor. That's a dangerous ball game to be playing, and one that I'm guilty of and have lived. It ended badly, but not as bad as it should.  Factor 2 the scope of his words. His use of hyperbole hearkens back to my days when I was super depressed. I used to speak like that. Used those ""ultimate"" type of words.   Now the sad one. The one that nailed the coffin for me. ""Should I make a comment about how hot her ass is? Would that get me more upvotes and make girls like me?""   There's a core misunderstanding there about how the way approaching women works. I told him to have dreams that he can make moves to achieve. That's how you get a girlfriend. You start off with little goals, push yourself and get on the ball of success. My terseness betrayed my intent greatly. I regret how I went about it. But I want this person to be happy.   Thank you for your perspective. It made me realize that almost none of my intentions came through."

ArianaGrande,2rqcgn,RaspberryFanta,10,Thu Jan 8 10:18:14 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, VJ was ruthlessly ambitious and stole all of the solos from the rest of the cast when they were on a show together, this made Ari hate her and do stuff like not follow her on Twitter until after the show was cancelled, not show up to one of her videos that the rest of the cast was in, and leak the real reason that the show got cancelled.  I actually followed Ari on Twitter when the whole Jennette thing went down and between reading comments and tweets it wasn't too hard to figure out what happened there between the lines.   Ariana graciously allowed her castmate to win favorite actress in the KCAs last year. Then the leaked pics happened, and the suits at Nick were obviously uncomfortable with letting a scandal embroiled actress win, so they gave the award to Ari instead. This is why Jennette (and the other chick from iCarly) boycotted the award show, despite the fact that the guy responsible for giving them careers was getting his lifetime achievement award.   Jennette apparently tried to get Ariana to participate in this boycott and Ari refused, likely because of a mix of knowing that relationship with Nick (and thus, Viacom) would continue to be very valuable to her career, and loyalty to the people who helped make her a household name. After the award show, Jennette decided to commit career suicide, apparently threw enough of a bitch fit behind the scenes to get their TV show cancelled, and started openly hating on Ari. She can make all the platitudes she wants about ""respect,"" but I can't fathom throwing away a starring role on a hit TV show over a fucking Kids Choice Award.  It also says a lot about Ari that she hasn't gone Hollywood after all the success and still hangs out with her childhood friends and old castmates, when she very easily could be doing the opposite, like her next door neighbor."

ArianaGrande,2rmw5s,BobsBurgersJoint,1 point,Wed Jan 7 23:27:42 2015 UTC,I don't care about being a mod. I am tired of all the reposts of images (most are bad quality at that) that can be found with simple searches.
ArianaGrande,2rmw5s,soylentdestined666,1 point,Wed Jan 7 22:34:51 2015 UTC,who gives a shit? do you know how slow this site would run if everyone only posted new images? sometimes its nice to have a repost especially if that pic has been knocked down a million pages
ArianaGrande,2rmw5s,QuantrelBitchop,-6,Wed Jan 7 22:11:05 2015 UTC,i think me and you can fix this community for the better! the horny losers are ruining this place 😩
ArianaGrande,2rmw5s,QuantrelBitchop,-2,Wed Jan 7 20:17:57 2015 UTC,I know she's attractive but /u/BobsBurgersJoint raises a good point about the issues that plague this community. This place needs a leader to right the wrongs and to lead this sub to glory!!!
ArianaGrande,2rmw5s,GodSatan,2,Wed Jan 7 20:58:17 2015 UTC,You're not that leader. Fuck off.
ArianaGrande,2rmw5s,QuantrelBitchop,-5,Wed Jan 7 21:09:53 2015 UTC,yes i am

ArianaGrande,2rmw5s,Ravenman2423,0,Wed Jan 7 22:15:42 2015 UTC,"dude. wtf is your problem? you need to find a hobby. we come to this sub because we think she is hot as balls. by the looks of your history, you come to this sub because you are obsessed. lay off the ""ari"" a bit, for your own sake."
ArianaGrande,2rmw5s,BobsBurgersJoint,1 point,Wed Jan 7 22:28:01 2015 UTC,Lol I am not obsessed I'm just bored
ArianaGrande,2rmwha,MCSentrix,1 point,Wed Jan 7 15:39:35 2015 UTC,Way too much makeup
ArianaGrande,2rmwha,remindmyself,-4,Wed Jan 7 18:25:56 2015 UTC,Too much for what?
ArianaGrande,2rmwha,jaibrooks1,1 point,Wed Jan 7 20:23:57 2015 UTC,She's a pretty girl and doesn't need to have that much makeup caked on her face. I thought my comment was pretty self-explanatory.
ArianaGrande,2rmwha,remindmyself,1 point,Wed Jan 7 20:58:04 2015 UTC,It's not like she has perfect skin. She is a normal person with normal blemishes that she covers up with makeup!
ArianaGrande,2rmwha,AriSweg,1 point,Thu Jan 8 03:52:41 2015 UTC,"Part of that can be attributed to all the makeup she wears. Regardless, I never said she has perfect skin, but I don't know any girl that wears that much makeup amongst my friends and their friends. It just doesn't look good when you can see a layer of makeup. It's supposed to be worn to enhance features and cover minor blemishes."
ArianaGrande,2rmwha,remindmyself,1 point,Thu Jan 8 03:57:47 2015 UTC,The thing that I've learned is that lots of people wear makeup for themselves. I have no idea what amount but it makes sense like with clothing. Also in the entertainment industry u it's usually for the job
ArianaGrande,2rmwt0,MCSentrix,1 point,Wed Jan 7 15:42:28 2015 UTC,She looks like she just smelled something really bad and it's making her eyes water forcing her to keep them open..
ArianaGrande,2rk48e,MCSentrix,8,Tue Jan 6 21:54:23 2015 UTC,I wish she would let her hair down like this. The split ponytail look -although symbolic- is getting boring.
ArianaGrande,2rk48e,HappyGoUnlucky,2,Wed Jan 7 02:31:23 2015 UTC,Her hair is damaged so she can't look like that anymore :( also she said she feels comfortable with the ponytail.
ArianaGrande,2rk48e,AriSweg,-9,Thu Jan 8 01:37:30 2015 UTC,"your being really mean to ari, she dresses like that cause she wants to no one is making her do anything she doesnt want to!!!"

ArianaGrande,2rj9a7,QuantrelBitchop,1 point,Wed Jan 7 01:45:44 2015 UTC,agreed
ArianaGrande,2rj9a7,AriSweg,0,Wed Jan 7 01:51:09 2015 UTC,"You might be right, she is very tiny and a vegetarian. Combine those and you just get a very petite woman. She knows her body so I think she can handle it!"
ArianaGrande,2rj9a7,QuantrelBitchop,-3,Wed Jan 7 02:01:59 2015 UTC,she's healthy you asshole not every female needs to be fat n thick. you just hate ari smh.

ArianaGrande,2rjy41,soylentdestined666,2,Wed Jan 7 00:42:35 2015 UTC,ok calling jennette ugly? now i KNOW you're an ignorant arianator.
ArianaGrande,2rjy41,QuantrelBitchop,-1,Thu Jan 8 06:37:06 2015 UTC,"ari is the most attractive girl ever, any other female looks like shit compared to her tbh"

ArianaGrande,2rivyw,CtrlAltDestruction,8,Tue Jan 6 16:13:27 2015 UTC,Season 1 of Victorious... Ariana at her absolute best.
ArianaGrande,2rivyw,AvbT,4,Tue Jan 6 20:27:37 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree with you more. She got a bit skinny :(
ArianaGrande,2rivyw,AvbT,8,Tue Jan 6 20:31:03 2015 UTC,"It's not only that, I think the overall style of her hair & makeup was much better than anything that came after Season 1."
ArianaGrande,2rivyw,QuantrelBitchop,1 point,Tue Jan 6 20:34:25 2015 UTC,"Definitely, a bit more normal/casual right?"
ArianaGrande,2rivyw,louisrod2005,-1,Tue Jan 6 21:27:40 2015 UTC,she's hotter now

ArianaGrande,2rezxb,MCSentrix,1 point,Mon Jan 5 17:12:39 2015 UTC,I think she looks a bit better in older pictures. She's still extremely pretty though.

ArianaGrande,2r8tr9,sanduskysBoyz,24,Sat Jan 3 22:53:02 2015 UTC,I honestly think she looks better back in 2011
ArianaGrande,2r8tr9,JurrasicDrizzy,13,Sun Jan 4 00:22:11 2015 UTC,I agree. For me it's because of the excessive weight loss though. She's still gorgeous but sometimes almost sickly.
ArianaGrande,2r8tr9,rhynes95,6,Sun Jan 4 00:55:10 2015 UTC,That sternum
ArianaGrande,2r8tr9,swishman,-6,Sun Jan 4 01:23:06 2015 UTC,i love the skinny ariana
ArianaGrande,2r8tr9,AriSweg,2,Sun Jan 4 01:50:09 2015 UTC,I think the best was right when the way came out and she emerged into fame.
ArianaGrande,2r8tr9,Jizzenthepuss,4,Sun Jan 4 02:17:41 2015 UTC,Back when she was hot and had some kind of personality.
ArianaGrande,2r8tr9,I_ate_a_milkshake,16,Sun Jan 4 15:56:22 2015 UTC,Oh yeah this was back when she was white.

First I went to the Rotten America website from the watermark to see what I can find, but the picture wasn't there anywhere.   I figured the photographer might have it distributed somewhere. I found the photographers name on the Instagram page and googled ""Joshua Eric Stronko Y100"".  Came across this site that had his pictures from the event. http://brokenrecordsonline.com/photos/y100-jingle-ball-in-miami-photo-gallery  For some reason the website denied access to viewing the picture so I took the URL and went to the directory. Tried to download it from there and it worked."

ArianaGrande,2o9w96,RaspberryFanta,-3,Sat Dec 6 02:39:21 2014 UTC,Show shouldve just focused on her. She's more attractive than all those models tbh.
ArianaGrande,2o9w96,QuantrelBitchop,7,Fri Dec 5 06:14:57 2014 UTC,It's called the 'Victoria's Secret Fashion Show' not 'A Night With Ariana Grande ft. Chicks in Lingerie'.
ArianaGrande,2o9w96,NasusAU,3,Fri Dec 5 11:22:08 2014 UTC,that would have been a better show though.

Pardon me for not kissing the ground she walks on like some of the white knights in this thread. Take a look through the sub and see how better she looks in most of the other pics

ArianaGrande,2nhaaa,BobsBurgersJoint,16,Wed Nov 26 18:41:15 2014 UTC,I think they were not theirs
ArianaGrande,2nhaaa,AAnthony12,11,Wed Nov 26 18:54:34 2014 UTC,The Fappening photos were not considered anything because:  They. Were. Not. Her.
ArianaGrande,2nhaaa,BobsBurgersJoint,-21,Wed Nov 26 16:37:15 2014 UTC,"And neither were Meagan Good, JLaw, McKayla Maroney, all fakes too right. I like her too but to just deny that they are hers because she said so even though there are similarities between the nude ones and other pictures she has taken is a little sad but I guess I'm in the wrong subreddit for facts."
ArianaGrande,2nhaaa,Lettuce_Addict,8,Wed Nov 26 17:26:41 2014 UTC,I have spent countless hours looking over this girl's photos. I know when I am looking at someone clearly NOT her. Apparently you do not know how to do the same.
ArianaGrande,2nhaaa,rhcp88,3,Wed Nov 26 17:52:25 2014 UTC,"not worth arguing, people will just go ""b-but the bracelet is so similar!""  She wasn't included in the original list of celebrities being leaked that was posted on 4chan and the pictures don't look that similar to her. Obviously they aren't her but that won't convince everyone else... the people that believe the fappening pictures are her are the same ones that believed the ""oops someone hacked my twitter"" shower picture was her."
ArianaGrande,2nhaaa,AAnthony12,-1,Wed Nov 26 17:40:08 2014 UTC,"Lol does it even matter?  If someone thinks it's her, who cares?  To them it is her and that's really all that matters.  The mind is a powerful thing.  For the record, I don't have an opinion on whether it is or isn't.  I just find it funny that so many people give a crap what others believe lol."
ArianaGrande,2nhaaa,acestrifer,-7,Wed Nov 26 18:15:53 2014 UTC,I know how to look at something for hours but I refuse to look her pictures up for hours. I'll find something better to do quite honestly

I'm not trying to be a prick, I'm just saying, you should reconsider spending your earned money on seeing her."
ArianaGrande,2nabwb,kdaggett4,3,Fri Nov 28 00:00:17 2014 UTC,"No, I totally agree that 150 isn't very much. The price of the flights were more frustrating, but at least I know not to spend five hundred bucks on her meet and greets now, since she raised the prices since then."
ArianaGrande,2nabwb,Jcanicosa,1 point,Fri Nov 28 02:05:02 2014 UTC,How much?
ArianaGrande,2nabwb,kdaggett4,3,Tue Nov 25 08:16:34 2014 UTC,150.

ArianaGrande,2nabwb,Ubiquitour,5,Mon Nov 24 21:25:11 2014 UTC,She was really nice when I met her! She asked to touch my hair and we snapped a pic.
ArianaGrande,2nabwb,AriSweg,11,Tue Nov 25 08:08:44 2014 UTC,"I feel like anyone that gets this much attention is going to have problems with it. I honestly don't think she is a bitch though, I think her management might manipulate her quite a lot and tend to boss people around. Recently she actually had a secret meet and greet with her fans in her hotel room because they had been waiting on her. Seems like a sweet girl when she isn't being pressured. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K958pqWRHGI  Gives $20 to homeless man https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB57Zc4DcnE  Kind of old but https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih7J_wGN0qE  Hotel Room https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE0JaxDVeNg  Hotel Room https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkClqMEDWfg  Response to Australian Photographer diva claims https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmQIpBVWCk   OTHER SIDE TO STORY  so far I can not find any hard video proof that she did anything diva like, although why would people make shit up like this?

ArianaGrande,2nabwb,mikufanatic,4,Mon Nov 24 22:47:33 2014 UTC,"Ive heard shitty things like her keeping studios waiting 3 hours, her yelling at stagehands and a room full of people 'cause her drink didn't have enough ice, and yelling at producers 'cause they didn't make her voice sound exactly right or whatever. I dunno.. it's all a bit weird, but it's nice to know she's not all bad if she's in fact bad at all. Thanks though."
ArianaGrande,2nabwb,mikufanatic,2,Mon Nov 24 22:50:40 2014 UTC,Okay I had a class but basically I was panning on linking things similar to what arisweg did. You can sort of get the gist of Ariana's personality from those I guess. Do you know where those complaints you listed came from?
ArianaGrande,2nabwb,mikufanatic,2,Tue Nov 25 00:00:40 2014 UTC,"A guy i know said he saw/heard it first hand, and he's comparing her to Hitler, so you know he's totally rational (eye roll) but i dunno."
ArianaGrande,2nabwb,AriSweg,7,Tue Nov 25 00:09:09 2014 UTC,"There's are tons more accounts of her being a fun person to be around than the reverse, like a 99:1 ratio."

ArianaGrande,2nabwb,jaibrooks1,2,Sat Nov 29 01:12:40 2014 UTC,"I like Ariana, I think she's very pretty, but I have heard plenty of negative things about her regarding her bitchy attitude.  She is going to be on tour on February 25th and I was very surprised to see that she is actually coming to my city (Milwaukee, Wisconsin) to perform her honeymoon tour. I bought a near front row seat to go see her the very day that the tickets went on sale. I got them for $81 because I bought tickets from Ticketmaster before.  There were meet and greet options for $500, but I honestly don't think I'd throw away $500 just to spend a few minutes with her and take a few pictures. Personally, I don't think it's worth it considering all of the negative news that I have heard recently that call her out on her bitchy attitude.  I will happily spend the low price of $81 to see her up close and hear her music, but I will not spend $500 to take a few pictures with her. Opportunities like that are perfect for bitchy and selfish teenage girls whose rich parents will pay for it.  I like her physical and appearance and her voice, but not too much her personality and attitude."
