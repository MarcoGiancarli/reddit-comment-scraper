ableton,3e7156,pattyemperor,3,Wed Jul 22 13:19:28 2015 UTC,"For the same price I'd recommend Valhalla VintageVerb (one of the best sounding reverbs I've ever used). IMO, Renaissance Reverb sounds similar to the stock Ableton one (which isn't that good to be honest). I just don't think Waves is all that.  Alternatively if you have Suite, the Convolution Reverb in Max Essentials is quite good and it's free."
ableton,3e7156,keisuki,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:32:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions! I'm up for any plugin really, the renaissance reverb is just what I happened to stumble across."
ableton,3e7156,JoeyDJQ,2,Wed Jul 22 13:37:18 2015 UTC,TAL reverb is free and sounds amazing. I'd describe it as a distorted reverb effect.
ableton,3e7156,Tsupaero,2,Wed Jul 22 13:35:38 2015 UTC,I'm running BReverb and LexRoom in most of my productions. BReverb is (still?) on a sale and Lexicon is simply well built - it's very close to its actual hardware pendant. Both with sufficient parameters to work with and I never hit any limits while tweaking tails or reflections.
ableton,3e7156,Morpion,2,Wed Jul 22 13:57:39 2015 UTC,"Second vote here for Valhalla - all of their plugins are incredible, to be honest.  I bought UberMod and VintageVerb on the days of release without even testing them - that's how enthusiastic I am about their stuff.  I use ValhallaRoom on absolutely everything (I've actually replaced the Ableton reverb on send 1 in the default template with ValhallaRoom, and the delay on send 2 with UberMod).  VintageVerb usually ends up on another send when I get further into a project.  :-)"

ableton,3e53va,ajpod,4,Wed Jul 22 00:54:31 2015 UTC,I would check out a cheap 49+ key piano controller. You can probably find something nice used or an Alesis Q49 for under $100 new. If you're willing to spend a bit more you can get a Nektar Impact LX49 for $159 and that should tide you over for quite a while.
ableton,3e53va,BigJewFingers,3,Wed Jul 22 01:15:59 2015 UTC,Is the LX25 any good? I'm limited on space right now so I think a 25 key controller would probably be better for the time being

The keys are solid and have aftertouch, it has several faders and rotary knobs, as well as 16 touch pads that you can use for finger drumming and to launch and stop clips and scenes. It is very well integrated in Ableton Live; it's pretty much plug and play."

ableton,3e53va,pcbforbrains,3,Wed Jul 22 11:49:16 2015 UTC,"Any of the Korg nano line kick so much ass. The first nanokontrol is better than the 2nd IMHO because it has an extra fader/knob/button channel, for 9 in total. That's 8 for tracks and one for master. The 2nd nanokontrol only has 8. The 1st nanokey sucked balls cause it had shitty laptop buttons beneath the keys, but the 2nd one is dope. The nanopad is good either in 1st ed or 2nd ed. The whole thing to me is that they are not the usual midi controller people go to - usually people go to keys first. But ableton accepts keyboard note input - so you already have a means of note entry. Using the 1st ed nanokontrol (my personal favorite out of the bunch,) you can control multiple knobs and faders simultaneously once you map them. Real knob twisting is the best compliment to Ableton you can have IMHO. You can find a first ed for 30$. The new ones are $60-$100.Or, if you have a mobile device, you could get TOUCHOSC and use your device as the midi controller. It's $5."
ableton,3e53va,tilldrop,2,Wed Jul 22 01:31:33 2015 UTC,"Seriously any will do. I have yet to find a keyboard in that price range with outstanding keys - they are all ok. also all you need is keys, trust me. I'd go on Craigslist or in a second hand store and just buy whatever you get for 20$ as long as it has keys. Or find some friends who produce as well. every one I know has a spare 100$ keyboard, cause you either will end up buying a better one, will work without any keyboard or quit producing :D"

ableton,3e4z4f,cjeris,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:16:13 2015 UTC,I disagree with a few of the comments I've seen so far. You want an i7 over an i5 because Ableton is hyperthreading compatible and so are a lot of vst's like the NI Komplete line. The big question is core count. From what I've read over the past few years it seems Ableton still operates best with fewer cores. Larger core counts will struggle with a smaller load than fewer core counts because a single track can't use more than one core for processing. Quad core seems to be the highest you want to go with Ableton in its current build. I have a quad i7 and it seems ideal. I would look in to the fastest clocked i7 you can find. They are faster than 4 gHz now.
ableton,3e4z4f,MCRoadkill,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:39:49 2015 UTC,Skylake (i7-6700K) comes out in a few weeks. That will be top for a while unless you shell out for a server chip.

You can't have one good thing while something else is bottlenecking it.  You should also have a proper CPU fan, mobo, RAM and HDD/SSD.

""How do I make this sound?"" posts are trash IF they're referring to some random sample they heard in a song, if it's something specific to ableton, like ""how do I get an lfo on this sound in operator"" then it's perfectly reasonable.  This a fairly popular forum discussing everything that has to do with a very specific product. Why not ask if anyone wants this product here? You've got good chances of selling it.

I also don't like the ergonomics of a floating window UI over the top of Live.  But I've been thinking of getting a tablet/iPad to run some standalone programs and syncing them with Live. Seems like I might be happier with that approach. Audio Damage have some nice looking software that I think I could get to love if that method works out for me."
ableton,3dxsqk,asilvermtzion,2,Mon Jul 20 16:48:43 2015 UTC,"I hate that stupid floating UI window too! I'd highly suggest trying out a second monitor if you aren't already. The thing that bothered me so much about those floating UI windows was that most of them can't be resized, they're constantly hogging the screen if you want to tweak something behind them, and they're just generally annoying. You can almost always find space for it on a second monitor, though, and you can still swap the screens whenever you need to."

ableton,3dwgc8,t3hcoolness,4,Mon Jul 20 03:31:51 2015 UTC,"ReWire allows you to run an entire DAW from within another one. For example, a lot of people run Reason from within Live - so you can trigger an instance of Thor, Subtractor, Kong, etc. on different tracks using the External Instrument device and Live treats it as a hardware synth so you can create clips that are sent to Reason's devices.  Ableton acts as the master and Reason acts as the slave. Most DAWs support ReWire, I can't think of one that doesn't."

Live 9 was my LAST DAW purchase; I have the indie hipster DAW (ReNoise), the comprehensive-environment DAW (Reason) and now the EDM-standard-non-linear DAW. All of them can ReWire; I could probably Frankenstein all three up at once if I wanted. And Bitwig misses out; I'd get something like Harrison Mixbus before I get Live's main competitor.  (I had a brief stint with Sonar, but we got an annulment, not a divorce, and my therapist says I don't have to talk about those bad times if I don't want to!)"
ableton,3dwgc8,dropbrian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:22:36 2015 UTC,"I actually prefer Reason's SSL mixer as well. Probably the other thing I miss is being able to see all the routing there in front of you (things like side-chain effects and sends), everything seemed more hands on - in Ableton these things are rather abstract.  Probably not worth buying it again but I do miss it sometimes. You never forget your first love."
ableton,3dwgc8,keisuki,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:48:42 2015 UTC,"I ended up making the exact same decision. Bitwig was cooler than live, but Rewire decided it for me."
ableton,3dwgc8,GaBeRockKing,0,Mon Jul 20 11:37:40 2015 UTC,"You know how, with ASIO drivers, you can only hear one sound source at the same time? Rewire lets you play one DAW, then have its audio show up as a channel in another DAW. Plus, it syncs up the play, stop, tempo, and loop commands, so the music being played from each DAW is properly synched up. Plus, ableton in particular has an easy function to send MIDI information across DAW's, so I can control a synthesizer in reason alongside my ableton tracks, and then layer Ableton effects over it.  The end result basically ends up looking like adding the Thor and Kong to Ableton for me, plus occasionally a Malstrom or Subtractor, and it's cheaper than buying suite (I had owned Reason before Ableton.)"
ableton,3dwgc8,GaBeRockKing,2,Mon Jul 20 11:36:02 2015 UTC,"You know how, with ASIO drivers, you can only hear one sound source at the same time?   This depends on your soundcard, I guess you use Asio4All? With a proper interface you can run any amount of soundsources, ASIO, DX and MME."

I’ve used Logic, Pro Tools and FL Studio in small amounts when collaborating with people.  I picked up Reason when I was interning at a recording studio and wanted to learn more about the racks they had, started making music and then switched to Ableton when I wanted to start performing. The piano roll and shortcuts were rather similar to Reason and I found I could do everything faster in Live so I just switched. And there's things like VSTs and Max for Live. I use it because it’s quick for me to get ideas down and I know it so well now."

If I really get stuck I can hand a mix off to a PT user to get the mix really dialed in, but it's been many years since I've had to do that. Anytime I see an engineer do a new trick in PT, I figure out how to do it in Live and save the presets. Also, having a full studio in a backpack is way worth any ""limitations"" Live may present, but honestly, figuring out how to make Live do the impossible is half the fun."

Fruity Loops has its uses, and I did some good work with it, but the work flow wasn't exactly there for me, although I think I maybe could have got there with a little more effort.  Even with that extra effort, I wouldn't have had the level of control that Ableton offers.  The learning curve on Ableton was initially steep, but once I tried a few of the on-board lessons, it seemed much more intuitive (to me) than other interfaces, and I was able to do whatever I want without being constrained."

Originally I used Logic Pro X, and although it is an incredibly nice DAW, I'm not the type of person who likes to work very linearly, and using Logic generally requires a pretty Linear Workflow. What I'm enjoying with Ableton is how it allows me to work nonlinearly. After an hour or two with Ableton I've already made better drums then I could ever create with Logic."

Released 4 albums written and produced with the program, and finally made the switch to Live about a year and a half ago - got a new record coming out that will be my first with the DAW.  I made the switch because Acid is a buggy, crash-prone resource hog. I was so used to working with it that I had a hard time making the switch, though - when the urge to write hit, I didn't want to fumble through an unfamiliar workspace. Then I took a 2 year break from electronic music, and when I came back to it I forced myself to learn Live and I'm glad I did - it's much more versatile and stable, and it helped me get out of my rut and come at writing electronic music from a different angle."

Because I use windows and OSX about 50/50, I wanted to get something that could run on both platforms.  Tried REAPER for a bit.  It got over the dropout issues Sonar struggled with, but the UI was a mess; those context menus were absurd!  Ended up with Ableton Live because I had a few friends who used it, and it ran on both Windows and OSX.  I was very interested in Bitwig Studio as well for the Linux support, but the price was too high to buy a 4th DAW.

I would say the DAW I spent the most time in before I switch to Ableton fully was Cubase. All the song I ever had published came out of the period.

Follow everything else here, as anything that will add in some harmonic distortion will help it sound punchier and fatter.  Also, one thing fundamental to the sound I think that gets missed is using the pitch envelope.  Take the pitch envelope if you're generating the tone from a synth and have it rapidly pitch down into the fundamental note.  A real kick drum glissandos in pitch (very rapid, but listen carefully) as the drum skin contracts and expands when the mallet/beater strikes it.  This dynamic helps add boominess of the kick drum."

ableton,3dsbmg,hunterfinden,15,Sat Jul 18 23:56:35 2015 UTC,"As the others have said, Analog is killer! I use Analog for pretty much everything actually. To get a nice vintage sound though there's a few things you need to do - first, in the Global settings set your Error and Vibrato Error to about 50% and you'll get a nice bit of analogue detuning. Try adding in the Noise oscillator but at a very low level, -25db to -20db usually works nicely for me. Also, add in a 2nd Oscillator and detune it slightly. Then probably the most important thing is your Filter (which is where Analog's magic really happens) - pull your Filter Freq down a bit but also set the Drive mode to Asym 3. Nice gritty, crunchy analog-ness :D  Hope that helps! :D"
ableton,3dsbmg,elphnt,5,Sun Jul 19 06:27:54 2015 UTC,"The built-in synths can totally do this. The presets, however, do royally suck. Play around with settings in Analog and you can create the sound yourself."
ableton,3dsbmg,mamuwaldi,6,Sun Jul 19 01:35:02 2015 UTC,"Or Operator, which is underrated as fuck."
ableton,3dsbmg,WuNinja36,3,Sun Jul 19 02:23:56 2015 UTC,"Operator's a great synth, but for a ""vintage synth sound"" it's probably best to go with Analog."
ableton,3dsbmg,wakydawgster,7,Sun Jul 19 05:38:31 2015 UTC,"Operator is such an intuitively laid out synth and was the one I learned on.  But it has some stupid shortcomings that keep it held back from being the perfect synth, shortcomings that are easily fixed.   Needs more than 1 LFO. Needs to be able to do pulsewidth.  Like come on guys, really? Filter frequency needs to sync to the glide.  Right now it doesn't move with glide. Suboscillator capability on all 4 oscillators couldn't hurt. Also as an aside, why the hell is the excellent analog-modeled Ladder Filter on Operator, but not on the synth named Analog??   If they made those changes, Operator would be one of the best and most capable softsynths."
ableton,3dsbmg,Mannex,3,Sun Jul 19 08:26:18 2015 UTC,I believe the Operator filter is not available on Analog because Analog was built by A|A|S (the rack device carries their logo) and Operator by Ableton themselves.

ableton,3dsbmg,Mannex,3,Sun Jul 19 17:20:00 2015 UTC,"do you know how to program synths, or are you just digging through presets like a wiener?  give me an example of the sound you're going for and I can give you a quick overview of how to program that sound  regarding the Mac DeMarco, I was able to get pretty damn close to the one on ""Chamber of Reflection""  http://www.filedropper.com/macdemarcochamberofreflection_1  (you can just drag and drop that file into ableton)  Analog isn't the easiest first synth, since all the routing options are buried in sub-menus.  I would've preferred to do it in Operator, as everything is more intuitively layed out, but Operator can't adjust a square's pulsewidth FOR SOME REASON so I had to do Analog.  Let's start with the oscillators.  both detuned .44-.47 to match the song's tuning, detuned slightly apart from each other to get that old analog phasing (old analogs could never perfectly lock the tuning of oscillators to each other and would always have the phasing).  Osc1 is a Square with pulse-width set to 35%.  Osc 2 is a Saw with suboscillator turned up 43% to fatten up the lower end, and is the main workhorse.  Amp is pretty simple, no point in explaining that.  Filter, again, pretty simple.  Turn it on and off, the effect is subtle, but an old analog synth without the filter doing something has no character.  Filter type set to 24dB since it's more pronounced.  Envelope mod on the frequency set to 5.12, Drive set to Sym3 to give it a little distortion/saturation.  Vibrato setting to 47% at 0.3 Hz.  I think this is what you're looking for when you ask for ""vintage analog"" sound, the lazy pitch bending as it plays, giving it that ""old shitty"" sound (biggest and most effective users of this technique are probably Boards of Canada).  This makes the synth warp and sound like an old crappy tape.  Pitch error also turned up 60% to make it sound even worse.  Chorus and reverb (synths always need reverb) to taste.  Delay 2 on the Chorus turned off so it doesn't get crowded."
ableton,3dsbmg,Mannex,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:38:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, this is a huge help. I gotta learn how to program synths for sure. Here are a couple links to the synth sound i'm trying to get.  https://youtu.be/d7ekt8PcfZ0?t=45  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-whZ56yJzg"
ableton,3dsbmg,elphnt,2,Sun Jul 19 15:35:32 2015 UTC,"I can hear three sounds in the first example.  First is a rhodes electric piano.  Along with it is some synth chord thing in the right channel.  Then there's a high pitched little ""tweety"" thing taht's just a sine wave put through a slight delay and reverb.  Incredibly easy, probably the easiest synth sound to get, as Sine is the most basic waveform.  The chords underneath aren't a synth, but are a rhodes electric piano.  Here is the patch for the little tweety sine wave thing.  super easy.  http://i.imgur.com/fN62pol.png       Second example also starts out with a rhodes piano.  Then a shitty little organ kicks in.  Also the drum machine is a Roland CR-78.  Old organs used additive synthesis, which created different timbres by stacking different sine waves on top of each other, usually through pulling out drawbars coded to certain harmonics.  You can emulate this by using Operator's ""oscillator editing"" feature and going in and stacking the harmonics yourself.  Below is a pic of a patch that gets pretty close to the crappy napoleon dynamite organ.  http://i.imgur.com/dE6aAEs.png       Electric organs always have this weird distortion to them, I can never get it right but I tried.  And of course, reverb.  It's possible to sort of half-ass a rhodes with FM synthesis in Operator, but honestly it's gonna sound like shit.  A better option, if you have ""Electric"" for ableton, is to dig through the presets there and see if any are close to what you want, as Electric is ableton's electric piano modeling instrument.  They all sound cheap though, you're better off getting a pro rhodes VST that's either sample or modeling based.

ableton,3dsx1m,tunatoboggan,3,Sun Jul 19 03:38:01 2015 UTC,"Probably not THE reason people use other DAWs for mixing, but possibly a reason for some, sure.   If you'd still really like to work in Ableton and have that capability, use a plugin EQ. There's a setting in preferences that will keep plugin windows from closing when you switch tracks. I use this a lot when I want to keep a plugin instrument open and tweakable on my other monitor while I dig into a different track.  HOWEVER, putting it like ""I make do by ... using my ears"" is no good. You should ALWAYS be using your ears. Visual feedback can be helpful for technical tweaking, but so many mixing engineers will tell you it's all about what sounds right. Keep training your ear so you don't feel like you have to rely on spectrum analyzers and such!  Happy mixing. :D"

ableton,3drauc,philroyjenkins,5,Sat Jul 18 18:24:46 2015 UTC,"In my experience the cpu meter in Ableton leaves a lot to be desired. It seems to struggle with reading multi core cpu's properly, or even giving an accurate read out. IIRC Ableton's MAIN processing runs on a single thread (depending on how you route/send things and the layout of FX will allow Ableton to spread out the load more). This means it will hammer one core of the CPU at a time anyway. So having a lot of cores isn't always super helpful, but having a single high frequency core is extremely helpful. I would recommend using the resource monitor in your OS or another third party tool to more accurately access CPU load if you are curious or run into issues."
ableton,3drauc,urgod,3,Sat Jul 18 19:09:30 2015 UTC,Makes sense. I'll pay less attention to the number and just be happy that it's all running flawlessly.  It was just the initial shock of investing a good amount into a computer and not seeing the number change.

One thing to keep in mind is there are less large movements and more fine ones with a trackball than a mouse, so it's important to shift the thing around and shift the angle a bit in order to prevent your wrist and hand getting sore. I have a wrist rest I use, and sometimes I stick it under the back end of the trackball to change the angle of it to prevent soreness.

I'm sure there are plenty of other ways to use it, though."
ableton,3djm9m,EllisDelta,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:05:42 2015 UTC,that's exactly what I was thinking of using it for too at some point but I typically just write all my music using the arrangement view (generally just make trap or future beats). that's not a bad idea and definitely helps me grasp what the APC could be used for.
ableton,3djm9m,fm7hz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:08:05 2015 UTC,There's a pretty cool step sequencer available for it if you have max for live. Would be fun to program trap beats on.

I set certain loops on various clips and in my head, count the phrases while kicking in and out of the various loops.  I just write what I want on a sheet (ABACAB phrasing, for example) and do a 'down and dirty mix, export that and save it for a snippet to build more songs.  With the clips and channel set up (similar to analog boards and the Session view), I can visualize and organize to start and end clips with each phrase count.  I know there are better ways to trigger clips, but I like doing it visually. Turning knobs to figure out what effect parameters have is also intuitive from my old studio days."

In Session Mode you need to make sure session record and session automation are turned  on. The groups of buttons up top near the transport is where you should look.   If you want to put a kick and a pad on cell in a drumrack (at least that what it sounds like you want to do) highlight the kick drum or pad sound, and group that into an instrument rack.

ableton,3dgrk6,RedHotBeef,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:08:08 2015 UTC,"Ahh, cool, thanks. I'm only just learning about instrument racks. So these aren't just patches for Operator or Analog, these are instruments that have been made (let me see if I understand this correctly) by inserting an instrument rack, then into that you insert, for example, Operator, then fiddle around with Operator's parameters to get the sound you want, and add native plugin effects to that e.g. EQ, saturator, compression, then save the rack and bingo, you have a new instrument?  Sorry to write it out so long-winded, it's the only way I can grasp these concepts."
ableton,3dgrk6,El-Syd,2,Thu Jul 16 23:25:18 2015 UTC,"No problem! The different ways to group things in ableton  (drum racks, instrument racks, and audio effects racks) are an important part of the software.   You are correct that each of these is an instrument rack, and I suppose could be described as a new 'instrument' in ableton. When you open it, you might just see the 8 assignable macro knobs. You can play the instrument via midi controller or qwerty keyboard like anything other synth, and adjust the macro knobs to manipulate the instrument in specific ways designed by the instrument's creator.   If you open up the guts of the instrument rack by clicking the other two little circle buttons on the far left of the rack, you'll probably see one or more 'chains' in a list (usually just the word operator or analog in the case of these instruments). Each chain can be filled with any synth, as well as effects or whatever else you might normally place on an audio track. And of course you can nest audio effects racks within here and within themselves, for lots of signal chain variety.   The purpose of those different chains with the instrument rack is so that you can have multiple channels worth of synths/effects/racks routed through the same instrument rack (and therefore same audio track) with different or overlapping accepted input ranges for splitting chains across a keyboard for instance.   Hope some of this helps, I'd be more than happy to re-explain stuff or answer any questions or thoughts you have!"

ableton,3dhwju,bigboyjorts,2,Thu Jul 16 13:46:30 2015 UTC,"These preferences look correct.  Does the Launchkey itself have different configuration presets? If so, make sure the right one for Live is selected. Live's Control Surface setup assumes that certain MIDI messages will work in certain ways, so the keyboard has to conform to that standard, and it's possible that they've included different presets for different software. My Axiom works this way.  Hope this helps!"

There may be certain ways of laying out your clips that are more conducive to that particular hardware and template -- but I can try to explain the way my ""set"" is laid out. Essentially, I just use tracks 1 and 2 as decks A and B. I have all of songs already loaded up in the set (as opposed to dragging and dropping from the browser, which is also a viable option -- I just try to use the mouse as little as possible on stage). So the different clips for each song are laid out vertically in each track as you're looking at it in Session View. And Tracks 1 and 2 are exact copies of one another (so I can, theoretically, mix between any two songs, at any given moment, without having to move stuff around first). As you might have guessed -- I have track 1 assigned to ""A"" on Ableton's internal crossfader, and Track 2 assigned to ""B.""  To implement ""cue points"" (sorta) I chop each song into a few different clips, with meaningful parts (I usually try to keep it consistent -- 8 bar intro, 32 bar verse/drop/whatever, 16 bar outro) and I use follow actions so that I only have to hit 'play' on the first intro clip, and everything else will play seamlessly from there. Chopping each song up like this has a couple benefits -- 1) you can skip ahead to your cue points if you feel like a song has worn out its welcome, and 2) you can see exactly where you are in each section, using the ""clip progress"" bar which is right above the VU Meters.  My only issue with using an MPD would be the lack of crossfader ... if there's a mixer already at the venue, then no problem! Just push tracks 1 and 2 out of separate outputs from your soundcard, hook them into channels 1 and 2 on the club mixer, and mix externally. I play too many small/weird/mobile gigs though, so I like to have everything right there at my fingertips already (I use an APC40 -- or an Electrix Tweaker, for smaller gigs). You should also check out the new line of Akai MPD products that's about to get released (MPD 232, etc)"

Just in case you haven't come across it, Live has an A/B Crossfader assignment for each channel.   I also tend to use faders and buttons assigned to an EQ Three on each channel to mimic Bass/Mid/High EQ and kill switches.  You could have another two channels assigned to looping beats to accompany, or single hit samples that you can switch through. Or even use some kind of scratching template on a channel. See Mad Zach's really cool idea here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH3ryAEP308  There's loads you can do once you start really delving into Live for DJ'ing"

Do people use certain ""safe"" midi notes or CCs when mapping something like a transport? Like you said, I don't want to map something and then down the road  accidentally trigger the record button when i move a fader on a keyboard, or whatever, because the mapping was the same.  so i'm wondering how people go about planning their mappings. it seems like i could get into trouble if i map it willy nilly"
ableton,3dch82,warriorbob,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:29:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't think people worry much about it. Changing mappings isn't terribly hard, so if you realize you have a collision, you just change one of them. TouchOSC in particular is really easy to change.  When you have a keyboard with faders, etc you can just try all of them when you first plug it in, and see what happens.  I usually pick a channel that none of my other controllers are known to use much; that's usually enough to avoid any issue."

ableton,3d909l,well-rounded-comrade,3,Tue Jul 14 13:09:32 2015 UTC,"There is no wrong or right. Only you can decide what works for you. Look at it like tools and just learn them and than think how you can use them for your music. Any MIDI controller can do this. Ableton can be mapped to pretty much anything. So just get a simple 20$ used whatever midi controller for the start. Since you don't know where to go yet anyways there is no point in spending hundreds for things you don't even know what to do with. You can just use a MIDI-controller for that. If you want a midi foot controller just google that.   The best way to go is doing it! Just dive into it, create a project with some loopers and just go. See what happens. Change what you don't like, keep what you do and add what is missing. There just is no wrong or right other than overthinking it.  If you need some inspiration or tutorials just look for ""live looping with ableton"" on google or youtube. You'll find tons of tutorials. However I can garantuee that no tutorial is worth anything if you don't try it yourself."

ableton,3d5gmq,Agent_Zoil,13,Mon Jul 13 17:55:41 2015 UTC,"you can also change time signature as well... took me longer than 5 years to learn this btw..  here's a description from the manual   Scene names can be both descriptive and functional; if Live detects a viable tempo and/or time signature as part of a scene name, the project will automatically adjust to these parameters when the scene is launched. To assign a tempo to a scene, select the scene and rename it with a viable tempo (e.g., “96 BPM“). Any tempo can be used, as long as it is within the range allowed by Live’s Tempo control (20-999 BPM). To assign a time signature to a scene, rename the scene with a meter in the form of “x/y“ (e.g., “4/4“). Any time signature can be used, provided it has a numerator between 1 and 99 and a denominator with a beat value of 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16. Tempo and time signature changes can coexist within a single scene name, and can appear in any position as long as they are separated from each other by at least one character. For example, “2/4+108 BPM“, “72 BPM;7/8“ and “60 BPM Chorus 3/4“ are all scene names that will cause simultaneous meter and tempo changes."

ableton,3d5gmq,ElMayonnaise,8,Mon Jul 13 18:19:08 2015 UTC,"Options.  Just because you don't use a tempo higher than 200bpm doesn't mean that someone else won't.  Especially if you're using a random or semi-random mathematical equation to generation your midi notes or parameters, having the extent of the parameters is important.  Some artists want to stretch their tools to the maximum, and may not even be worried about whether or not a piece ""sounds"" coherent if they're able to appropriately mess with paramaters (though he never used Live, John Cage was famous for this)."
ableton,3d5gmq,ometzo,3,Mon Jul 13 18:25:51 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying about other people pushing things but I may not have explained quite what I meant.  For example, how would 1/4notes at 500bpm be any different to using 1/8ths at 250bpm?   Happy to admit I can't see the difference but to me, it just seems inconsequential."
ableton,3d5gmq,ElMayonnaise,3,Mon Jul 13 18:39:50 2015 UTC,"In terms of what you hear, there is no difference between 1/4 notes at 500 bpm and 1/8ths at 250 bpm.  You're totally correct about that.  Even if you're not intentionally trying to randomize the parameters of a device to its limits, I can think of ways in which tempo would still matter, especially when you get into processing/post-processing.  I think minimum note sizes on some filters and effects are limited (Ex: off the top of my head I believe ping pong delay has a minimum note size of 1/64th or so, and I know there's a hard limit on arpeggiator, though I don't know what it is).  If you're trying to make a very fine-tuned effect that has a fixed resolution, maximum tempo could matter greatly."

ableton,3d3hf4,SausageLegs,9,Mon Jul 13 05:42:07 2015 UTC,"A bit of a shame really, the Push does not natively map to VSTs, but there are a few techniques you can use.  For starters, to be able to add a VST plugin using the Add Track button on your push, one idea is to build custom Instrument Racks and saving them in a folder of your choice, either under Abletons Presets or under a folder in Places. I've started putting them in my own folder under places containing configurations I find myself using.   Next, to be able to configure the parameters of your VST, unfold the VST using the arrow in the VST title. This brings up the configure button. Clicking the configure button will allow you to map parameters inside the plugin to Ableton. Adding a bunch of parameters from Serum will show up like this. You can see that Ableton matches the names of the parameters to whatever the developer has put in. (With varying results. Some VSTs have really shit names, and some are just flat out wrong).  If the VST has few enough parameters, I believe 32 (I might be wrong but something like that),  Ableton will automatically add them in some kind of order. I find it easier to just put them in an order I find comfortable with. You can add up to 128 parameters, and you'd be surprised what you can actually add in there. For instance, in Serum, there's no problem adding a parameter to shift through the Filter Type, and one to toggle which oscillator it will affect. Play around with what you can find in your VST, buttons, sliders, menus, whatever.  Now, here's the cool part. If you select the VST so that it's active and controllable with the Push, the first 8 parameters will show up under the encoders on the Push. If you click the Browse In (I think it's called) button, left one marked in the red rectangle, the bottom row of the display (marked in the blue rectangle) will turn into ""Bank 1, Bank 2, Bank 3..."". You can have up to 16 banks, with 8 parameters each. Each bank corresponds to a group of 8 parameters starting from the beginning of the ones you mapped to Ableton.   In the end, find which groupings of parameters work for you. Here's what my Serum configuration looks like. For instance, I have three banks dedicated to the two oscillators, one for the filter, one for envelope 1 and 2, one for selecting which effects are turned on, e.t.c. It's really neat. You can of course not do everything, but I'm having a real blast with what I can do with it."

Old school hip hop still has rapping, but instead of calling new school hip hop hip hop, I prefer to give it its own title. It's a futile battle, but I refuse to allow these 2 worlds to be seen as one  And i guess that was mb for not wording it properly but I was using kanye as a rap example, anybody who classifies kanye as trap will be crucified by the trap l0rds"

ableton,3d2kph,catsgomad,3,Mon Jul 13 00:42:13 2015 UTC,"You'd need a VST for amp modelling (I recommend bias, cheap and really good), and some effects VSTs if the ableton ones don't do what you're looking for. You can do live playback so having a jam with effects and stuff running on the track, I do it frequently. Also, if you're looking to be able to switch effects on and off as you play, I'm sure you can get midi pedalboard a somewhere, but I've not seen one."
ableton,3d2kph,TTren,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:11:00 2015 UTC,How do you deal with latency?
ableton,3d2kph,Awesome_In_Training,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:41:37 2015 UTC,"My interface + ASIO4ALL has a little latency, but not quite enough to be annoyingly audible, atleast to me. I'm not quite sure what you'd need to get rid of it entirely though, maybe someone else can help you out there?"
ableton,3d2kph,TTren,3,Mon Jul 13 09:43:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you're going to experience some lag in your signal. Digital guitar pedals are small computers with the only job of processing your signal. Your personal computer, on the other hand, is tasked with running an operating system that then runs Ableton that then processes your signal. If you have a super-duper fast computer then you may not really notice the delay, but it will be there. I've done it, and you can get used to slight delay and you have far more control of your tone that you otherwise would.  A thunderbolt interface may further reduce the delay, I'm just not sure."
ableton,3d2kph,wishIknewwho,3,Mon Jul 13 04:27:25 2015 UTC,"You can know exactly how much latency there will be by going into the ""Audio"" tab in ""Preferences"". You can reduce latency by increasing sample rate or reducing buffer size. I get about 4ms with my (admittedly pretty weak) Macbook Air, and that amount of latency is not going to be perceptible."
ableton,3d2kph,rjungemann,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:54:18 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, but I think these are metrics that are only related to input and recording and don't take into effect the other goings-on of your computer before output.  If you have some further knowledge on this that I don't have I'd be sincerely interested to learn more. I've used a macbook to process audio live for years and never actually fully known about this."
ableton,3d2kph,wishIknewwho,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:04:09 2015 UTC,"If you don't have any effects on the track, that should be the latency that you hear.  I'm having trouble tracking down specific information, but I'm fairly certain that most plugins (ones that don't perform FFT mostly) will process audio according to your buffer size. At 92kHz with a buffer size of 128, that should be around 1.39ms per plugin.  Speed of sound is 1.126 ft/ms. Speakers 5ft away from you will add 5.63ms of latency."
ableton,3d2kph,rjungemann,2,Mon Jul 13 23:49:40 2015 UTC,"Yes! You'll need an audio interface to record/play back. Run your guitar into an input and route that to a track in Live. Monitor ""IN"" or arm it for recording. You'll hear the input of the track come through in real time, so you can load up with effects and such.  Live Suite does include the Amp and Cabinet devices which will probably be useful here, as well as all manner of other effects. You can add more via VST if you want, and you can build things like switchers and splitters using Racks. All of these can be controlled via MIDI if you have, for example, a MIDI pedalboard.  Other people have covered this already but you will experience some nonzero amount of latency. With a good computer and interface you can get it pretty short (enough that you likely won't notice it at all) but it will still be there - this is a necessary reality of computer audio."

ableton,3d2kph,manysounds,2,Sat Jul 18 00:58:24 2015 UTC,No problem!  IF you have a speedy machine with a decent enough interface you can get down to playable latencies easy. I have done this live and intend to again in the fewchah

Learn each and every stock plugin you can to the best of your ability and how to apply them while focusing on songwriting. If you get a bit farther down the line and find you're lacking something specific production-wise,  sure,  go for plugins.

ableton,3cwva2,sk1e,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:08:47 2015 UTC,There are sooo many awesome plugins out there. Many of them outperform ableton stock audio effects and instruments. UAD is the best out there. Waves is pretty good. Fabfilter is awesome. Sonnox Oxford is also some of the best. Soundtoys is almost crucial to every mix. Izotope have been crafting some really great plugs. That being said I love ableton eq8 and glue comp and erosion and spectrum and auto filter and many more.
ableton,3cwva2,socklife,0,Sat Jul 11 16:38:56 2015 UTC,"Waves and UAD plugins are the industry standard for good reason, they genuinely outperform the basic stuff the comes with Ableton. That's not to say that you can't do some of the same stuff with Ableton's built-in effects/instruments but it will be more difficult probably."
ableton,3cwva2,mcgillycuddy412,9,Sat Jul 11 15:09:06 2015 UTC,"Waves and UAD are typically used to mix real recordings: engineers who come from studio backgrounds feel right at home with their emulators of classic analog gear, and they have much higher requirements for transparent processing, too. Also, for these people who actually earn good money with their craft and are used to buying compressors that cost more than some cars, these plugins seem cheap. And finally, they need to run a lot of these plugins in real time during recording, so ability to buy external DSP gear to give CPU some rest is very important.  However, if you're a bedroom producer who is writing electronic music, none of these reasons are important for you, so it doesn't make any sense to buy these plugins, especially when you have functional equivalents in DAW already, and even other emulators of the same gear are so much cheaper."
ableton,3cwva2,golergka,2,Sat Jul 11 15:19:48 2015 UTC,"My laptop can support plenty of Waves VSTs at once with little effort, ok a little effort, but I'm not monitoring anything in real-time so ur right, it doesn't affect me. But I disagree that the stuff in Ableton is ""functionally equivalent"" to the Waves Suite. What Ableton effect does the same thing as WavesTune? Even the simple shit like the OneKnob stuff doesn't exist in Ableton either. I guess you could say that Ableton's Vinyl Distortion is comparable to the Kramer Tape Delay, but then again, they're different."
ableton,3cwva2,mcgillycuddy412,2,Sat Jul 11 15:29:51 2015 UTC,"OK, to be fair, when I hear about waves and UAD, I first think about equalizers, compressors and channel strips, in other words, plugins that are functionally ordinary, but are remarkable for their execution level. It's quite possible that they have unique plugins that I don't remember right now that are worth their while even for bedroom producer.  However, I still think that for a musician (as opposed to recording, mixing and mastering engineer) it makes more sense to invest into instruments and extreme sound manipulation effects. Stuff from Native Instruments just seem more fitting — I just bought Komplete Ultimate 10, and I'm still only scratching the surface of it a month later."
ableton,3cwva2,golergka,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:46:03 2015 UTC,"Ah, see I seldom use Waves' EQs, comps, and all that other stuff. My main EQ is EQuilibrium from DMG Audio and I usually use Ableton's compressors. But oh man, Waves Aphex Exciter, REDD, Maserati, etc. its ones like these that are somehow able to emulate an analog ""warmth"" that Ableton can't. In Komplete you have Kontakt, and the orchestral synths are the bee's knees, but at the end of the day, they're just A LOT of orchestral samples varying in velocity, note, and style, and that's part of what you paid for. The same goes with the Waves/UAD argument IMO. Ableton's plugins are good, but up to a certain point, and beyond that are the hardware emulation VSTs. So just like someone at Native Instruments recorded those orchestral samples, some engineer at Waves had to take the analog circuitry of lets say the Aphex Exciter, and turn it into code for a computer. So imo, OP could benefit from a plug-in like that, though you're obviously right in saying that they would benefit from instruments if they're more of a musician and less of an engineer. I like to think of myself as wearing both hats."

You might want to add this reset point to the beginning of your song and don't remove it afterwards. That way it will reset before rendering just in case.

For a quarter note to be 0.125 seconds at 120bpm the time signature would have to be like 4/1 or something."

You're going to have to learn from the ground up.  If you don't know much about music start there.  You'll need to have a basic understanding of music at least.  You'll also need to learn how synthesis works as this allow you to create and design your own sounds.  Tutorials are great for learning but regardless you have to understand what they're doing in the tutorial other wise it really doesn't serve you other than making a ""cool"" noise.  In the end though tutorials will only get you so far.  Everyone is trying to sound like the next guy when they should try to sound like themselves. The thing is though it's going to be a long process.  It does feel like one step forward two back sometimes.   It's not easy.  It will take a lot of time, dedication and much frustration.  That's just the way it is.  If you're willing to put in the time and learn the right things you can definitely cut off some time in the learning process.  Just don't expect to make hits right away.  It's probably taken me 4 out of 7 years of producing before I was finally relatively satisfied with where I was at.    Long story short...  It will take time, and dedication.  Don't get discouraged because everyone goes through this process.

ableton,3cqur4,KingOfTheGalaxy,2,Fri Jul 10 03:21:16 2015 UTC,"Try setting goals for yourself, like imitating a sound or rhythm in one of these tracks you posted. By working towards something in Ableton, you will naturally encounter hurdles you'll need to solve, and that's how you'll learn. Every time you do something you haven't done yet with Ableton, you'll learn something. Replicating things you like (even though you're not making anything new) is a great way to learn how to make music you like. Completing even a small goal should hopefully give you a sense of accomplishment too.  In terms of resources, since I've switched from Logic I've never found an Ableton question I couldn't answer by searching my .pdf of the manual or the forums, maybe I'm alone in that. I wish I had a good tutorial series I could recommend, hopefully some folks will chime in on that."
ableton,3cqur4,horriblenoises,2,Fri Jul 10 03:45:26 2015 UTC,"SadowickProduction provides a very in-depth and easy to follow Ableton course here, for free! There's a lot to take in, but he covers most if not all of what you'll need to know on Ableton in order to get started.  However, no tutorial beats just jumping in and messing around. Don't expect to immediately produce music that sounds professional. Still, it's best to just go for it. When you find yourself stuck, google how to do what you're trying to do and move on until the next obstacle. Eventually, you'll be able to overcome obstacles through intuition and not google. If you follow too many tutorials, it might take away from your own style. And in a world where literally anyone can produce electronic music from their bedroom, you definitely want your own style.   On top of ableton, there are a few things you might want to look into. Synths. I would first recommend finding a good synth that you like. Music Radar has a good list of options here. I like NI Massive, but that's just me. Drum Samples. Ableton comes with a few drum samples, but I never found them appealing. Poke around on google and you will definitely find some good ones. There are plenty of free one hits, but they most likely won't be the same quality as the ones you pay for. Effects Ableton comes with a very good set of audio and midi effects. In case you want to try something new, there are plenty on the internet. Music Radar has a good list here.   Most importantly, just have fun with it and all the pieces will come together. Good luck!"
ableton,3cqur4,notdarrylavid,2,Fri Jul 10 06:09:01 2015 UTC,"If you like this style, I have 2 words for you: RHODES PIANO.  Nothing can come close to owning an actual Rhodes piano, but there are a couple decent VSTs out there. I personally like Lounge Lizard the best. In my opinion, the Rhodes may be the most versatile instrument for recording, and is certainly the backbone of the type of music that you've posted.  Download/listen to a bunch of drum sample packs until you find one that fits the sound you want. Consistency in drum & instrument sounds is one of the first steps towards developing your own style.  On the same page, you will also get a lot of mileage out of using an actual bass guitar in this style of music. Get a cheap Yamaha bass and spend some time learning how to play simple basslines. This will help you in many ways (especially in learning theory)."
ableton,3cqur4,seoulsurfer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:08:16 2015 UTC,Here's my two cents. Find something specific that you want to learn and then how to do that one thing. That way it breaks it down instead of feeling like there are a million different things to learn how to do.
ableton,3cqur4,SlickRick1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:26:19 2015 UTC,"don't be afraid to try every knob and button. don't be afraid of automation and performing with effects. knowing ableton is step one. finding your voice to convey via ableton is next. think more about the mood and tone and emotion of the music you want to make and not what the sound is going to be. use real instruments frequently. play more than you sequence.  these are all things that took a while for me to internalize. get them out of the way at the start and you can only grow as an artist.  for ambience, effects are your best friend. on of my favorite sonic textures ive use in a song is a harmonica through a gauntlet of delays, reverbs, and saturation. put effects on a source sound until the cpu cant take it and then resample that track into a fresh audio track. put more effects on it. literally just experiment with everything. see what comes out of it. use the sounds you like and save the ones you don't. you'll sometimes wish you had a sound you trashed a few days back."

ableton,3cppav,skydive_guy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:11:23 2015 UTC,"That is definitely MIDI; this guy's confusion comes from putting a live guitar into a midi plugin. That doesn't work.   MIDI =/= audio. MIDI is a method of synchronization between pieces of hardware. MIDI is essentially selecting a value between 0 and 127 and having each of those numbers correspond to something. For example, inputting notes and control changes and so on. An audio interface is what you plug your guitar into for recording and monitoring it.  What you can do is record guitar, put virtual amps and Ableton effects onto the recorded material, and record your effect tweaking with the MIDI controller. Or, slice up your guitar playing into a drum rack and play the guitar samples like a keyboard.  What kind of controller do you have?  And for VSTs: start with Ableton's stock library. Don't over-complicate it at first. Record your guitar, try out some effects presets from Ableton's library, tweak them to your liking. Record glass breaking or a piece of paper burning and layer it with your guitar. Try wacky shit like that, you'll learn your style much faster.   If you want a useful VST to add to this selection, try a virtual amp like Amplitube. That will give you what is essentially a virtual version of a huge locker of stompboxes, rack effects, amp heads, cabinets, and ""mics"" to select from for making your guitar sound like a guitar."

I drop the tuning of the toms down 1. compress (glue knob) the hell out of the cymbals (so that you can hear them ring out over the guitars which are pretty heavy for my music) then just play with the tone of each sample. you can bring up the eq the knob is attached to and see what it's doing...then I add some reverb...  I'm sure you've googled it and have found that you can put a velocity effect (under midi effects) and it will add some variability to the intensity of the hits. You can also go through and just randomly change them yourself.

ableton,3cgkkp,Someuser77,6,Wed Jul 8 12:50:07 2015 UTC,"Although I upvoted the above comment as ""Funny"" as a relatively new user of Live I have to say the manual doesn't tell you how to do a specific thing if you don't know what it is precisely you want to do. It's especially hard to figure out what to do if you don't know the keywords to search for but you do have an image in your head of what you want to accomplish.  Sure, if you read the manual cover-to-cover you'd eventually figure it out... But it's huge and boring. I'd rather learn things as I need them and enjoy myself playing with Live in the meantime.  This is why I stopped reading through Ableton Live 9 Power - it was dry as hell and didn't make any sense due to a total lack of context or useable examples. I switched to Interactive Composition which doesn't teach as much as fast, but you have a heck of a lot of fun learning it."
ableton,3cgkkp,CopiousAmountsofJizz,3,Wed Jul 8 18:06:40 2015 UTC,Actually the stock Ableton 9 manual is remarkably well written. In fact it's so well written they had the same guy write a book on the creative music process.

ableton,3cgr7t,yesthismessismine,3,Tue Jul 7 20:00:09 2015 UTC,Normally I'd do timing first because it usually takes the longest
ableton,3cgr7t,lodestar89,3,Tue Jul 7 22:02:04 2015 UTC,"This is more or less my full-time gig at this point. But I work in pop, where perfect is what we're going for, and there's typically a lot of production to ""hide"" behind.   I feel the need to point out that ""perfect"" does NOT mean snap each note dead center, and chop every word and paste it on a grid line. I would hope that it goes without saying, but I've seen some weird shit. Perfect should be a combination of exactly what the artist intended to deliver, and what unnoticeable adjustments you can make in order for the performance to mesh with the music in feel and style. Artists are going to do their thing, and you just need to make sure they're happy and they sound good (and hopefully don't realize you've even touched anything), and that the music and the vocals complement each other in a way that's natural and cohesive. (ie: the best drum programmers don't quantize to the grid, and on an MPC you couldn't if you tried.) This is pocket, and it is vital. This is why tuning is great, but there's so much more to do.  Anyway, because you're using AT, I agree with timing first. I would say you should just plan on comping your final take. I would duplicate the track and start by timing, but not in AT. I would actually dup a third take honestly. The first dup I would cut and nudge until it has the right feel. The second (especially if you're in PT) I would elastic audio (or warp in whatever way you can in your DAW of choice) to make the releases and transitions right. There's nothing worse than double breaths, obvious silence, or transients (hard ""t""s can be annoying) outside the pocket. Comp between these two so that everything's in time and in pocket and there aren't any weird edit points. This should be mostly cut-and-nudge take with stretched thrown in where necessary to resolve edit point / cross fade  issues. This makes tuning a lot easier.  Then after tuning, comp in any unnatural (or artifact-y) spots with the original (unprocessed) take. Sometimes you find it doesn't sound as ""wrong"" as you had thought when it's in ""fixed"" context, and you regain some ""naturalness"". If it still doesn't work, you can address whether it's a timing or tuning problem case-by-case.  Most of the time, I'm editing an artist who had a ref from the producer or top-liner. I use Melodyne, so I can knock out two birds with one stone - the stretching as well as the mild tuning (to better match the ref). If there are places where the envelope isn't right I'll take care of both problems at the same time . . .  Melodyne is amazing.   Anyway, when I'm done with all of that, I'll put AT back on at like 65 speed maybe?, just to see if that ""sound"" is what we're after.  Not sure how much this helps you.  I realize I may have deviated from your conventional workflow quite a bit. Message me if you have any questions!"
ableton,3cgr7t,Neve_8014,2,Wed Jul 8 04:39:39 2015 UTC,Very valuable post^
ableton,3cgr7t,enselmis,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:43:16 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks so much for the lengthy response. A lot of good stuff in here. SO let me see if I'm understanding you correctly..  Track 1. Comp of final take.  Track 2. Dup of T1 to fix timing using cut and nudge.  Track 3. Dup (of T2?) use elastic audio or warp  Track 4. Comp between T2 and T3? THEN fix tuning, maybe in a new track?  This seems to be a much safer workflow then I've been doing, so good to hear. I should probably incorporate this thinking for the rest of my project.. Quick question re timing first. In my mind I can see why if a note is too short, stretching it will make it easier to fix pitch just because there's now more note to work with. If this is true though, it would be the opposite for notes that are too long... This thinking could be very flawed, I'm basically asking whats the reasoning behind fixing timing first? Another question, in my experience with Ableton, I haven't loved it's warping for vocals.. so was hoping Antares would be a bit better... Are you familiar with Ableton's warping? You mentioned using your DAW rather than Antares, so I'm wondering if Ableton's warping is a good representation of kindve what's ""standard"". Also, Melodyne over Antares yeah?  Hope all these questions aren't a bother!"
ableton,3cgr7t,Neve_8014,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:07:29 2015 UTC,"Hey again. Sorry for the delay. Crazy last day (or two?) getting to London. Anyway, yeah more or less . . .  My workflow is a little different in PT and Melodyne. I do it all on playlists. But tracks will work just as well if you're organized, or just want to take bits and pieces from this, and don't mind a busy session full of muted or inactive tracks.  I'll have an instrumental 2track, the vocal references (hopefully all split out and not just a stem with bgvs and adlibs and all that printed in) and all of the artists tracks I was given. I'll group the artist's vocals if they aren't already as ""unedited"" or something for reference down the line. Then I'll duplicate all of these tracks and group them as ""final"" and make the originals hidden and inactive so they're out of the way and I can't accidentally alter them. I'll rename the new set of tracks individually (PT adds that .dup naming convention that I hate to the end) - I just delete the "".dup"" and add a space • instead so they appear identical to the original tracks but I don't get that ""there's already a track with that name"" popup. Then I'll duplicate these playlists and rename them all to end in "".timed"" and do my cutting and nudging. When I'm done I'll duplicate the original playlists again and tag them "".EA"" • (for elastic audio) and do all of my stretching on these to visually match the envelope of the reference waveform. I'll listen down with the ref to make sure it's tight, and then again in solo and spend a little more time compromising in places where it may have been a little heavy-handed, a little too much ground to cover, or turned out artifact-y. Then I go back to my "".timed"" set, duplicate them, rename them all "".comp"" and start adding my fades. Anywhere that doesn't sound natural (the last line moved forward and the next moved back, leaving a gap, for example [though sometimes I fly a room tone gap for elsewhere and it may work if there isn't a ton of headphone bleed], or the release or transition of a held line of moving notes can't be cross faded without pops or clicks), I'll check my "".EA"" playlist to see if it works there and comp it in if it does. When all the fades are in I'll listen down in solo to make sure it's clean. With experience you learn what's close enough to get away with in context with the music, and what will be painfully obvious after compression and limiting. If it's all good, I'll duplicate these playlists and tag them all "".ME"" • (Melodyne Editor) . . .  Before I actually dig into tuning, I'll make a new track to print to for when I'm done. I'll assign it a buss input and rename that buss • ME PRINT • so it doesn't accidentally get used anywhere else. The process from here may be overkill (as if up to this point it hasn't been already . . .) I'll put Melodyne on the first track and analyze in and tune like a section at a time to different instantiations •. First Verse Melodyne in the first slot, Pre I Melodyne in the second, Chorus I Melodyne in the third and so on. Originally this was because years ago I was paranoid that you could only pull in so much at a time before you lost precision for the sake of visually rendering all of the data. Irrelevant now, but I still do it because it's easier to go back and make changes (or at least makes it less daunting so I don't try to convince myself it's okay out of laziness). Having multiple instances, section by section, means that when I'm done and listen down, it's easier and faster to pinpoint the specific note(s) you want to tweak a little more or a little differently. And because like I had said, I do a lot of my stretching in Melodyne as well, sometimes you'll listen to the lead and the double together, and though they sounded fine on their own, you hear them phase or rub or the vibratos don't match or the releases are different or any number of things, and you'll have to go back and change one while listening to both. But that's getting a little ahead. So I'll tune one track at a time, section by section, and when I'm done with the whole track, I'll copy the name of that track I'm tuning, paste it into my ""print track"" playlist and tag it "".tuned"". This way, when I buss to the print track and record, that clip file will be named something relevant •. God forbid something goes pear-shaped in 20 minutes and I have to dig it out of the clip list . . .  Then I'll make a new playlist on the main track (the one that should be tagged "".ME"" at this point), and tag it "".final"". I'll copy the (what should be one, long, neat, bar 1 to end, on the grid) clip from the print track and paste it in. I'll shrink the track I'm now done with, move the print track down (I always keep it directly below the track I'm tuning), copy the name of the one I'll tune next, go to the print track  and make a new playlist, paste the name in and add the "".tuned"" tag, and repeat the process.   This isn't as ridiculous as it seems (or as time-consuming) when you've committed to the workflow and it's become second-nature. Because a) the process allows for a lot of ""mental milestones"" that keep you moving, helps you keep track of your place, and most importantly keeps you motivated and feeling like your making progress, and b) when you're done you have a chunk of untouched tracks with exactly what you were given, a chunk of tracks with every trace of what you've done • (safety playlist, chopped playlist, stretched playlist, comped playlist, tuned playlist, printed playlist), and one single track with playlists for every final print you've made •. You can literally go back to any point and see what you did and make a change.   Sometimes if it's super-pop l'll throw AT on (set the damn vocal range and key PLEASE - I hate the default Alto or whatever when it's a male artists in the middle or bottom of his range), and see if I like what it adds. Maybe I'll duplicate all of the bgvs and harms and VocAlign them too, just in case ""abnormally tight"" is cool. Sometimes it is. (side note: depending on the version of PT and VicAlign, you should change the handle length from the default 2.0 to 0.0 or VocAlign will fuck up A LOT more than normal.)  From here, it's a last little organizational cleanup (track heights, color-coding •, what have you), Save As ""xsessionx_vocals_ddmmyy.ptx"" •, select unused clips, remove unused clips, highlight only the tracks I need (depending on where they're going next - not everyone needs everything . . .), and Save Copy In with just ""selected tracks"", ""audio files"", and ""plug-in settings folder"" checked.  This is the session I send back, or what I'll use to Import Session Data into the session with all of the music split out.  added bonus: anything marked with a • is something I specifically do to cover my own ass and mark my territory. non-intrusive little things so I can look at a session even from years ago and tell you if I worked on it without having to hear it. because this tuning thing can be serious. for me anyway. you're literally altering an artist's performance and delivery in every way. you want to be able to prove what you did and didn't do down the line. especially if you've done well. I've gotten calls later on from mix engineers about getting extra doubles if there are any or whatever without having to ask who to contact because they recognize my quirky little signatures.  The point of this whole thing has become less about the tuning process and maybe more about making deliberate and consistent choices and deciding just how detailed-oriented you want to be. That's literally the only thing that's allowed me to turn this into a living. And obviously I'm looking at it from a different perspective, but if the same principles help you improve your music the way it's help me improve in my job, maybe it's worth including.  Also, I left Denver at 8:50p Wednesday, arrived in London 1p Thursday, couldn't sleep, and it's now 7a Friday, but feels like Noon yesterday . . . I'm sorry I've lost my mind. I'm sorry I may have skipped over things from your reply. And I'm sorry this isn't more specific to Ableton; I guess you'll have to take the concepts you like and translate them however works best for you. Let me know if there's anything else, tuning or otherwise. Obviously I can literally talk about this all day. Good luck! Hope I could help somehow!"
ableton,3cgr7t,Neve_8014,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:05:04 2015 UTC,"Oh okay. Just re-read.   Yeah the ""more or less 'note' to tune after stretching"" isn't how I look at it.  It's more like, if you stretch first, you're ""spreading"" the cycles of the waveform; obviously in a very literal sense if your algorithm is Vari-Fi based - make something longer, cycles spread out, pitch goes down (then again, I'm not an acoustical physicist). This is fixed in tuning afterwards.  But if you tune first, then stretch, you can be ""un-tuning"" by cents potentially. Do I sound crazy?  I don't have ANY experience doing this in Ableton. In my mind, this is the kind of thing Pro Tools was built for. The only stretching I do in Ableton revolves around setting samples to keys and getting that Passion Pit / Cashmere Cat effect of a vocal as an instrument.  Let me know if I missed anything else."

Edit: That being said, you are absolutely right. Nothing's stopping you from making any style of music in Live. The only thing it doesn't work well for is film composition. It's too hellish to work with multi-out VSTs."
ableton,3chxw2,oli2194,7,Wed Jul 8 23:11:38 2015 UTC,"It's an all-purpose DAW, and you really can do anything in it, but the built-in tools lend themselves really well to loop-based music like house, techno, and experimental genres. Its time-stretching and sampling capabilities make it stand out from other DAWs for electronic producers using those tools, but the built-in instruments don't have a particular stylistic bent.   It's probably best suited for styles where you're going to be combining recorded or sampled audio with digital instruments (via MIDI) and/or VST instruments. Just recording a live band might be easier in Logic or Pro Tools. Likewise, producing in an all digital style like acid house or drum n bass might be easier with a platform like Reason or Renoise."

ableton,3chxw2,fussbudgets,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:29:42 2015 UTC,"It can honestly be used for anything but there are certain tasks it may be better suited for, and those tasks will also depend on the individual user; i.e. some users may say it stinks for tracking vocals, some may say it's adequate, and a minority may say they prefer it.  I really think any host is probably capable of most things, though most are not equal at all things.  Ableton's Session View for clip launching and live performance can fairly objectively be said to be without equal, though it is possible to implement this in other hosts.  Some hosts are much better at utilizing multi-core processing simply by how they schedule audio tasks across parallel processors: Reaper and Cubase are considered leaders in this regard.  But it's easy to stress over the details instead of spending time combing through musical ideas, which is what will really develop the individual as a musician/songwriter/sound designer/producer etc.  That's not to say there's no such thing as working smarter - quite the contrary, a workflow emphasizing creativity productivity will lead to the best results, IMO.  But before one can figure out how to work smart, you need to work hard, first.  With that said, what draws me to Ableton specifically are the unique paralleled arrangement and session view modes.  I also, contrary to what others might say, think it has a very simple and intuitive learning curve once you figure out your way around how instrument, audio effect, and drum racks work - the signal path is very intuitive, and routing is very straightforward.  It is deep, in that there is very deep functionality to the way racking things works, but I'd chalk that up under experimental learning."

Recording live instruments in Ableton is a nightmare and trying to mix them is even worse.   It has other weaknesses as well. The lack of a score editor makes it next to useless for orchestral music or any sort of counterpoint composition. The horrible piano roll makes it incredibly difficult to edit solo piano pieces or other sorts of complex single instrument music. The layout of arrangement view kind of locks you into 4, 8, 16, or 32 bar phrasing and makes sections of variable length hard to composite or keep track of. The list goes on.

It can be very hard to mix from the stage anyway, is usually a lot easier to have someone dedicated in/behind the audience doing that imo."

In Ableton I am running everything into an Audio Track with a looper on it. I don't have any effects or things like that added and I was hoping maybe that's what I needed to do. I use Reason to produce my music and play over it live with ableton as my launching platform for my back tracks so I'm not too familiar with the interface"
ableton,3cg642,Sle,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:05:57 2015 UTC,"Huh.. I know you have that nice amp and all that, but I think that these interfaces behave better when they have the instruments plugged directly in. Give that a go.  This doesn't solve your issue, I know, but it might allow you to make some serviceable recordings while you figure out how to bring the amps into the equation. Good luck!"
ableton,3cg642,cultculturee,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:40:15 2015 UTC,"Well I run my bass and my guitar through and as far as playing live, unless i'm going through a badass system I gotta use the amp but I'll give that a shot when I go home. Keller Williams uses multiple instruments but goes into a mixer and everything is direct - no amps. I really wanna get the money to do that eventually."
ableton,3cg642,cultculturee,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:45:39 2015 UTC,"There are some decent bass and guitar amp VSTs I've found that work well in the meantime. Here's a few:  http://lepouplugins.blogspot.com/  http://www.simulanalog.org/guitarsuite.htm  http://nickcrowlab.blogspot.com/  For bass I tend to just use the built-in Ableton amp, a compressor, EQ, and maybe sublte chorus or phaser effect. But I haven't found the perfect solution yet.  I might be talking out of my ass on this next part but I wonder if the focusrite heads into the red so easily because it's monitoring distortion levels, and an amp is doing exactly that--distorting the sound. Maybe throw a limiter on your audio track? I have the same problem though that my amp doesn't sound as good played directly into the interface rather than on it's own.  I know another solution people will use is to play your guitar through an amp and then have a mic in front of the amp running into an interface. I always thought this seemed like an unnecessary extra step but maybe there is something to it."
ableton,3cg642,cultculturee,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:16:13 2015 UTC,no it's not that unnecessary - usually when I play live I have a mic up to the amp to compensate for the loss of 'juice' however my looper only goes through the speakers which sort of works out for me so that the overall loop is lower than my instrument but the bass loops are almost inaudible among the other tracks

ableton,3ccycy,firefonix-jon,10,Mon Jul 6 23:04:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely.   Create a drum rack (assuming you want the cymbal in a rack). Put a sampler into it. Find your samples and place them all into the sampler. It will say ""7 of 7 samples selected"" or whatever amount you want. Open the 'zone' tab in the sampler. You'll see three subcategories; Key, Vel, Sel. You want to click 'Vel' because that is the one dependent on velocity input. To the right (still in the zone tab), you'll see a piano roll. Drag the samples to fit into the ranges you want, and then when played, they will adjust based off the velocity of the hit. You could choose your own ranges or just select all and click ""distribute evenly"".   After this, you may want to turn down the volume<velocity slider a bit. You don't want your hits to be very loud or very quiet if you're over-exaggerating the hit velocities (""oh, I have to crush it to get a crash and I have to barely tap it to get a ride""), and plus, you could always just control the volume. For me, as long as it's not too robotic, it's nice to have a baseline volume set so that it doesn't vary TOO much and stays easy to master."

ableton,3c88ad,k1ch3r,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:39:31 2015 UTC,"You don't need a specific synth or effect plugin to achieve any of the sounds in that track. Most of the base sounds used are quite simple...   I'm guessing you want to start with something like the sound that you can hear around 0:20?   Rough and quick guess from me without actually trying to match it: Sounds like there is a siny sub bass and a squary lead bass using multiple voices with some stereo spread and maybe very slight detune and envelope variations for the voices going on. Simple filter (low pass with slight drive and moderate q) envelopes on both. Some quick non legato glide or pitch envelope in the beginning for at least the lead part I think... basic EQing, heavy reverb on the lead synth, less reverb on the sub, some saturation and compression on the bus for both...  So to sum up: Those are basic sounds, they sound good because they are mixed and mastered well and people like reverb. You don't need crazy effect settings or mad science additivewavetableoulsewidthfrequencymodulationwithphasersanddelays to achieve them. You could use Analog or Operator (additive and substractive parts, no fm). You could also use massive, strobe, or whatever you like to use."

ableton,3c6fwx,RevBlueJeans,3,Sun Jul 5 09:07:43 2015 UTC,"Like others said, adjusting velocity helps but to do what you want - drop your snare sample into a drum rack, then click on the snare sample controls (where it has a visualisation of the sample and ll the ADSR shit). the snare control section should be highlighted only, not the whole rack.   click ctrl + G (command on mac?). this has placed the snare control section into a new instrument rack. pull up the chain menu for this rack and then copy the snare however many times you desire. replace those snare samples with new ones  currently playing the snare plays all of your snare samples at once. To have it alternate add the ""Random"" MIDI effect and set the range(? i dont remember if the value is called this, you should find it with a little messing around) to the same number of snare samples you have.  adjust randomisation chance and other parameters to your liking.  congrats you are done.

Set your choices to 8 (remember the 8 samples we dropped in?) Set your chance to 100% Finally, change RND to ALT (this will make sure the samples are cycled instead of being chosen at random)  I may have missed a step, let me know if this works out for you. Another great way to use this is to have a string of notes creating a melody. This way you can play a melody with one pad. Great for freeing up space for other sounds.

ableton,3c33m3,thaldridge,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:28:32 2015 UTC,I learned Reason back when it first came out and used it up till 5.0. I never switched to Ableton because I felt like I would of been wasting all my specialized knowledge. When I finally switched I found I was able to accomplish more and much faster with Ableton and I never looked back. It really is an amazing program. I've used FL studio as well but I think Ableton is the stronger of the 3.

I'm a computer science major, but I felt like there was this barrier between the creativity of my mind and the computer. I'd struggle to make anything and just get frustrated.   My buddy who makes beats showed me ableton, and I got ableton 9. I feel so much more comfortable with the software. I'm breaking down that barrier between my mind and the computer more and more ever day, and I've been putting out at least a track a week if not two. I feel like it's so much more easier to understand and to use."

I never liked the way FL handles audio samples and automations and I love the way Live handles them.  So I used Live for about 5 more years and now I frequently jump between the 2 depending on what kind of music I'm making. If its more sample heavy with a lot of resampling then I'll use Live. If its something more melodic then I prefer using FL studio.  It all boils down to personal choice. Give Live a try, and watch a few youtube videos. You'll quickly see whether its for you or not."

ableton,3c33m3,BeigeTelephone,3,Sat Jul 4 08:33:39 2015 UTC,"There are definitely accomplished producers that use FL studio. Correct me if I'm wrong but I swear I've seen separate videos of Rusty and Deadmau5 using FL Studio.   Bottom line though, use what feels best for YOU.

I know that the best way to get better at making music isn't worrying about software/hardware, but rather to just make music.  Basically what I want to know is, would learning how to use Ableton be useful? It has a lot more tutorials on Lynda and such."
ableton,3c33m3,tilldrop,2,Sat Jul 4 09:04:40 2015 UTC,"I think it would be useful. Maybe you'll find that you enjoy Ableton more for Sound design and melodic elements and FL studio for beat making, then combine the two.  Or maybe a scenario could come up in the future where you want to do a colab with someone but they only know Ableton and have never used FL Studio. Then you'll be set since you'll already know Ableton, no worries about bouncing down tracks to use in another DAW."

It's currently in public beta so you can download a full version for free to try it out. It costs a hundred dollars but I believe that it going up to 150 when the full version is released. I also own Diva by the same company, which is the same price, and simply a jaw-droppingly beautiful sounding synth, especially when using the highest quality settings. It's a cpu monster though so watch out. Also, I've found that as a rather unskilled synth programmer, Diva was a bit overwhelming to dive into, whereas right away Hive had me making preset after preset that I found useable."

Six oscillators, lots of LFO capabilities, the arpeggiator is very robust, and there a bunch of built in effects.    The Korg Legacy series synths are really good synths.  The M1 and Wavestation are emulations of digital synths.  From what I've heard they are damn near exact emulations.  The MonoPoly is amazing as well.  The PolySix a MS-20 are worth checking out, too.  You can get these for <$50 normally but they usually go on sale around the holidays and you can get these for <$40.

I'd say Xfer Serum is a go to for leads, bass and everything in between. Sounds great, costs under $200 (price escapes me right now) and it gets updates on the regular.  If you want something that'll just do work, idk just go massive or sylenth. They sound alright and with some effects, a lot can get done.  You really should just look up a bunch of synth VSTs and watch videos on YouTube of people using them to see which you like most.

ableton,3bx6xd,AlexGodbehere,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:15:46 2015 UTC,Indeed. I Almost always do parallel compression with a s/r equipped with an eq8 in which i cut all the midrange leaving only the high and bottom frequencies. Then i add the compressor and do my adjustments. Any better way to do it will be well received. Parallel compression does magic though!

ableton,3bx6xd,Pawtang,5,Fri Jul 3 09:24:10 2015 UTC,"A solid preset to use, but I'd also recommend anyone who is unfamiliar to spend some time learning and experimenting with how parallel processing for compression works - the so called New York compression.  I'm also an advocate for not necessarily defaulting to parallel compression on drums as a technique to bring them through the mix, unless it's being used as a sound design element.  EQing is a good way to preserve the dynamics of the drums/drum buss without compression, and depending on what is in the kit and the master mix, sidechain compression can give them some room to punch through, too, without touching their dynamics much."
ableton,3bx6xd,DogPoopBags,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:38:49 2015 UTC,Sidechain is my friend.
ableton,3bx6xd,Kamtre,2,Mon Jul 6 19:20:31 2015 UTC,"This is another option.  Sometimes it may be best to simply EQ out part of the sound, whether on a group buss or the stereo buss to get whatever it is you want to come through.  Other times full spectrum sidechain works, sometimes a multi band sidechain with only the frequency content that contesting each other being ducked.  Lots of options and experimentation and ears are the best bet, though there are patterns you can develop to shortcut the manual process."

ableton,3bx6xd,Alkuimista,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:55:45 2015 UTC,"Parallel compression is the same in every daw. Almost all compressors now have a dry/wet knob, but for parallel compression it's always better to use a send and a return track (or bus) instead of the dry/wet knob in my opinion. Not only you can run more sources through the paralell compression, but you also have more control on the subtleties of the sound with paralell processing. For instance, in your Drum group you may want some elements with it and others without, and you dont use so many resources if this is done in a separate bus."

Plus what you can do, which I also do, is just keep a 256gb SD card with your random stuff in your laptop making it 512gb anyways. 8gb vs. 16gb ram was night vs. day for me. I also own a 13 inch laptop and overall the extra couple inches of the 15"" makes a big difference in Ableton."
ableton,3bwlop,rentak,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:25:16 2015 UTC,"I have a late 2013 model 13"" pro dual core with a 256GB SSD and 8GB of RAM.  I've not really hit my limit with the processor or ram yet, but I sure hit the SSD limit fast.  I have NI Komplete 10 Ultimate, which is over 300GB to fully install.  The only time I've ever maxed out my processor is when rendering video with Adobe products.  I only have the Intel GPU, and it takes a bit to export.  But that's for video, not audio.  I got the 13"" because I like the size, and felt the 15"" was too big to lug around, but I kind of wish I had the 15"" for the GPU.  It'd make rendering and some games better.  I still love my 13"" though, it works great and I don't really feel limited by it.  Each track can only live on one processor at a time, so if you have a large number of tracks you'll see benefit from a quad core system.  If have a small number of tracks, but they have a large number of effects, you'll get more benefit from higher clock speed (Ghz).  If you are sticking with 32-bit Ableton, the maximum amount of memory that Live will use is 4GB anyways, so 8GB would be plenty.  Have you ever ran out of memory with 32-bit Ableton?  If not, then 8GB is enough.  tl/dr: Save money and buy the 8gb/512ssd/i5"

Komplete 10 weighs in almost 500gb alone, for instance.  The real draw here is the 2.9ghz clock speed.  DSPs vary with their ability to schedule audio tasks across parallel processes, but for Ableton, I'd pick faster cores over more of them.  Depending on how route and process everything, the 2.9 could very well outperform the 2.2 quad and hitting the limit where you have to start freezing tracks and rendering down to audio is a real workflow restriction."

ableton,3bstib,DogPoopBags,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:41:16 2015 UTC,"This was one limitation I encountered early using a 64 pad controller to play in parts which would naturally be played in on keys.  However, there are ways around it, and one the best I found was quick mapping the scale hotkeys to something easily accessible.  It is similar to the mental approach I think about on ""traditional, chromatic"" instruments where I place myself in the music by which degree of which scale/key I'm playing in.  Now, instead of engaging the part of the muscle memory in my brain than remembers the fingerings (fretboard in my case) for the scale I'm transitioning to, I instead hit an aux pad, and my brain simultaneously thinks about which degree of the scale I'm transitioning into is to be played.  It makes sense when playing but it's a bit difficult to explain."
ableton,3bstib,plomm,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:53:12 2015 UTC,"You could make a device in Live using the Scale device that would make a piano keyboard always play in key, but what would be the point?  I think pads work fine for playing in music.  If we could design a piano where every scale could be played like C Maj, that has some very distinct  advantages.  A pad controller in scale mode is essentially that.  A lot of people might suggest learning keys  to some basic proficiency, but I don't necessarily agree with that line of logic in general.  If the user's goal to simply get their musical ideas out of their head into the DAW?  If so, there's not any argument for picking up keys over a pad device.  There is some merit to saying keys are more ergonomic for playing very musically complex pieces, but with some amount of practice (certainly less than keys) you can also play pieces of intermediate complexity.  Again, I challenge anyone making this decision to think in terms of compelling musically inspired ideas from a person with no experience on keys: which one is going to yield results in terms of expressing musical ideas?"

ableton,3brxyy,todge4,3,Wed Jul 1 17:41:43 2015 UTC,You are in a tough spot. Most people don't want actual cards to put into their computer. So it is a losing venture to make them. Which is unfortunate as the PCI bus is super fast for audio.   The only options you have are to pick up a used card. Or to purchase a pricey Lynx card.
ableton,3brxyy,savyur,2,Wed Jul 1 18:39:33 2015 UTC,"There is a reason why people dont want internal cards, or better three:  -I can use my audio interface even on a laptop or if I go to somewhere else  -pci audio interfaces produce much more noise as their converters are in the middle of hell of noise and electromagnetic fields. Better than integrated interface? Sure. But I had an audiophile pci and if my hard drive was loading something or my psu was under load I would definitely hear background noise  -its way more comfortable to have your outputs and inputs and controls next to you  People tended to buy pci or pcie audio interfaces because they were obsesses with latency which was still problematic on usb 1.0 interfaces. But nowadays buying them makes sense only for consumers and gamers. Yes a Lynx pcie will have lower latency than my focusrite 2i4. But all things considered my 2i4 achieves less than 8 ms which is something extremely hard to hear not even mentioning it can be even lowered by direct monitoring when recording or by simply lowering input latency when using only vsts and no external audio source."
ableton,3brxyy,jauntylol,3,Thu Jul 2 16:26:18 2015 UTC,It's actually benefitial to have an external audio interface in order to avoid interference noise from the other parts of your PC in your audiostream.

I dont have stuttering on very old p3 computers and mp3, so you definitely have software/hardware problems. Try reinstalling your audio drivers. Or even format.

ableton,3brygo,D_T_K_B,3,Wed Jul 1 17:45:08 2015 UTC,"Chord progressions can be constructed a number of ways but one of the simplest is for the root of the chord to follow the degrees of a scale (say I-IV-V) with said chords being in the same key of the scale.  Simplest chords to work with are a triad which is just the root, third (minor or major depending on key) and the fifth.  You can begin with inverted positions of the chords, exploring different degrees of the scale, and resolving the scale in different modes than the Dorian as the first step of simple experimentation.  If you are unfamiliar with all this, just google some basic music theory in the area of interval theory, chord theory and scale theory.  You can be up to speed in anywhere from an hour to maybe 4-6 hours depending on your musical aptitude and prior training."

You will need to understand chord symbols to make some headway but you wont understand the harmonic theory of what's going on which I wouldn't worry about. It will just be good practice material to keep you from I-IV-V'ing all day long. Here's an example: Ornithology by Charlie Parker."
ableton,3brygo,analoc,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:58:29 2015 UTC,"The most simple thing I can tell you is to go do some research about intervals. I have very little theoretical knowledge in music but a basic understanding of intervals has helped me tremendously. This explanation will suck and probably piss real musicians off, but: A note's distance (in semitones) from the note it's playing against will determine the ""flavour"" of your chord. Say you have a root note, and decide to add a note that's one semi tone up -- that creates a Minor 2nd, a feeling full of tension and dread. Or, if you add a note that's 4 semitones up, you get a Major 3rd, which is the key ingredient in major chords. Take that 3rd and flatten it (so 3 semitones from the root instead of 4) and you've got a Minor 3rd, the key ingredient for minor chords. Add a note 7 semitones from the root and you got a Perfect 5th, which is the most used chord formation ever, not just in electronic music. This is known as a ""power chord"" when talking about guitar, and is used like crazy. So, if you go up and look up intervals, it will have a list of the different intervals and their sonic effect when added to the root. This basic understanding will help you big time when you've got a chord feel in your head and you want to try to make it happen in real life. Is that a tritone I'm hearing? A minor third? A perfect fourth? A seventh? Like I said, I don't know much, but learning about intervals was huge."

It's still not the same and not as useful as doing the structured course but if you have the right attitude (which you're gonna need anyway) you'll learn.  A bit cheeky but so are their prices!"

ableton,3bostk,DJAndrewCharles,3,Fri Jul 3 15:09:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not a trainer myself, but I'm friends with quite a few of them and we've discussed this a lot. As far as I know, only Ableton is offering certification classes, I don't think Dubspot can make you a certified trainer.  The certification used to cost around $1400 and it would take the entire weekend to go through the class. Before you get that far you'll need to send Ableton some background on what makes you qualified to be a trainer, as well as a video showing off you teaching something Live specific to someone. Then there's a few phone interviews you need to pass. It's a long process, especially now that so many people are wanting to be certified and there's very few classes being given.  Also, Trainers are like ambassadors of Ableton, so it's not just about how much you know about Live. They want people who are good at teaching and working with other people too, so your people and presentation skills will be on test too.  Opportunities and earning potential are entirely up to you and how you market yourself. I know some trainers that are constantly busy and some that say it didn't help them at all. Really depends on what you want out of it. It won't automatically get you any gigs, aside from maybe the a couple here and there if Ableton asks you to host say a Push class at a local Guitar Center or something."
ableton,3bostk,Tarekith,3,Wed Jul 1 05:33:59 2015 UTC,"Hey,  Are you looking to do a course that is certified to learn more or are you wanting to actually become certified yourself?  If the latter, you're not going to get that through someone like Dubspot, only Ableton themselves provide Certification, which you can read about here: https://www.ableton.com/en/certified-training/  If the former, which I suspect is what you want then there are a few things to note. As others have said, you can learn most if not all of what you'd learn in an official course from YouTube but doing a course at somewhere like Dubspot is going to give you a few things that YouTube won't:  A structure - the courses are written by professional educators who really know what they're talking about and they're structured in a logical way to get you from A to Z in the best way possible. As someone who has written and taught these kinds of classes I can say from experience that I constantly get students who tried to teach themselves on YouTube and ended up learning things all in the wrong order and sometimes even the wrong things from people who don't really know what they're talking about (of which there are quite a lot).  Secondly, the biggest thing a course gives you that YouTube most definitely will not is contacts and interaction. At your course you will not only be exposed to professionals who are already involved in the business but you will be studying with peers who may one day open a recording studio and need partners to go into business with, etc. At a place like Dubspot you will most likely be exposed to outside guest lecturers who will have amazing insights and might even be future contacts or job opportunities.  As someone who has studied sound engineering, every single job I have had in the industry has been as a direct result of the connections I made at my college."
ableton,3bostk,elphnt,3,Wed Jul 1 05:54:06 2015 UTC,"A note on the job market - it is flooded as all hell and people are drowning left right and centre. Every Tom, Dick and Harry with a computer thinks they are a music producer - some of them are right, most of them are wrong. The bottom line is you're only going to succeed if you work really hard to get above the rest. And I'll also say that every Tom, Dick and Harry is learning from YouTube and are still stuck in their bedroom. Go out and study and interact with other human beings while doing it and make connections that will get you involved in the industry and working with people who really know what they are doing."
ableton,3bostk,elphnt,2,Wed Jul 1 05:56:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know someone who has a 1st class degree in sound engineering.  He couldn't find a job in it.  He is doing rather well with producing though."
ableton,3bostk,pizzalikeus,2,Wed Jul 1 12:25:38 2015 UTC,"As a Trainer myself I'll put like this, it depends. one thing to note to become a ""Certified Ableton Trainer"" you pay money and take tests then Ableton will endorse you as a teacher. Only Ableton inc. can make  you a Certified Trainer. it is not like protools certification it is only if you want to teach and want benefits from the ACT program. Now on the topic of taking lessons.. it depends.. do you have more time or do you have more money is one question. I teach private lessons online and depending on the student my classes can potential take years off the learning curve.  I personally learned from manuals, books, videos, workshops, and teaching. I personally never went to school (plan on getting a degree soon though) Now some people need the structure to learn. it helps for some one to set goals, homework, and projects. For some of my students i help keep them aimed at their goals. Some of my students just need a few doors open and then they are gone. So in the end search yourself and check out the program to make sure it suites your needs. As for getting a job in the music industry.. that takes dedication, focus, tenacity, audacity, and a deep passion. My advice to anyone is if you are passionate about anything else.. do that.. otherwise dive into music, set goals, and make it happen."

ableton,3bostk,PooOnYoureFoot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:45:40 2015 UTC,"I did the EMP program at Dubspot. Saved up a year working a shitty labor job and moved from Wyoming to NYC for 7 months with no need for a job while I was there. I loved it and think it was worth it, but I don't have a job in the industry or anything. I was somewhat new to production when I started, used Ableton for about a year and a half, and had been in bands before. It really kick started my production abilities and after 7 months I went from making really shitty songs to making still kinda shitty songs, but not that bad.  I look at it as really laying down a solid foundation that you can build upon. I got pretty good at using Ableton by the time I finished the program. Which was about a year ago, and I don't remember the last day that I didn't work on music and that's more than likely because Dubspot helped make the creating process much less frustrating.  I did see somebody mention getting an internship at a studio, I really wish I did that, because IMO the mixing and mastering program at Dubspot was lacking. It seemed like it was just a tutorial on Sound Toys plugins and not actually teaching much mixing techniques. I would search for some online mixing programs instead.  I'd give the EMP program 8/10. Great experience, easy to follow, and the teachers and most students where awesome.  Edit: A kid in my sound design class from Thailand just released his first single. https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=138&v=m84Jd35ngLw He's improved a lot since we finished."

ableton,3bloky,KidDrewMusic,7,Tue Jun 30 05:57:33 2015 UTC,"There's a few loopmasters packs I was looking at getting so I took the plunge. From what I can tell it contains all of loopmasters own packs as well as some more packs from various other companies, and they're working at getting more sample packs and companies included. Right now it's only wav files (no MIDI or presets, but they said that will change in the future). You get to keep all the samples too even if you don't continue subscribing, and it's nice being able to listen to everything in the pack and browse stuff based on instruments/loops/one shots/key/bpm/etc. So far I've spent the past hour browsing sample packs and sorting them by the specific sounds I'm going for and I'm nowhere near filling up my 100 samples yet.   For me the most enticing aspect is access to  samples I wouldn't necessarily buy a whole pack of and the inclusion of presets in the future. Saxophone is really popular right now but I don't want to shell out $20 for 100 saxophone licks, or if I feel like making a trap song (not my style) I can go on and find an 808 that I like without browsing a bunch of crappy free packs or spending money on a pack I may only use half a dozen times.   Hope that helps a bit and let me know if you have any questions about it!"

Updating your subscription plan can be done easily through our website. When you upgrade, your account will be immediately be credited with additional downloads for the subscription month in which you upgrade, and will be charged the difference between your current rate and the new plan. If you downgrade, you will keep your downloads credits until the start of the next billing cycle, at which point your new plan will take into effect."

ableton,3bloky,Ni4Ni,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:41:35 2015 UTC,You should be able to. I've found the search function can be a little iffy when trying to match a pack I found in loopmasters with the one in splice sounds. Usually the pack will be the same name but the search name of the pack is slightly off (Eg progressive house vox vol 2 instead of Progressive House Vocals Volume 2)
ableton,3bloky,NotSoSiniSter,3,Wed Jul 1 09:52:52 2015 UTC,"I bought into it yesterday. I think this is a very neat idea. Whoring around and grabbing a bunch of sample packs and only finding one or two samples that are useful is incredibly annoying. It takes up a shit ton of space, because I never want to delete anything I download.  I feel that 100 samples/mo is totally fine. Sites like Soundsnap charge $9 to download 5 samples.   I haven't dug around much, but I really hope that Splice Sounds builds up a super diverse collection of samples. My initial impression was it was a lot of ""EDM SAMPLES V11"" stuff. Hopefully that changes as this picks up."

I can't test the service right now, because I don't have a credit card (they are not common in Germany), but 100 (or 300 for about twice the price) seems like a great deal to me! This however is only a great deal if you are looking for specific samples or know what you are looking for in general.   Think about it this way: How many unique samples do you use per track? Add 10-40% because you will probably have to try some samples in your DAW (and not only preview them) and you can estimate how much the samples of one song are. Remember that once bought you can use the same sample in other tracks as well. I would be more than happy to spend those 7.99... if only I had a credit card."

Live mixes internally at I think 32 or 64-bit even if your audio is 16 or 24 or whatever, so you have a ton of headroom. Even if you're dipping into the red on the individual track, so long as it's below 0db at the master when it comes out (or before any plugin with a similar ceiling) you won't clip.  So you're in the clear - it won't mess with your audio quality, at least not at the track mixer stage. But aiming lower is still a good idea, for sensible gain staging."

For a clean ""volume only, no other changes"" boost, you can use the Utility device in Live. As another comment said, you'll probably end up enjoying some compression too since I think that tends to sound pretty good on mic'd guitars."

ableton,3bceag,Emerica331,3,Sat Jun 27 23:43:13 2015 UTC,"Push, out of the box, is not meant to be used in arrangement view.  There are a few scripts around that will make it work that way but from my experience, they cost.    When I first got Push, I also wanted to arrangement view b/c that's how i was used to working.  However, if you use Push in session view, as it's intended, it is substantially easier to get idea out quickly and keep on plugging. Then, once you have a few ideas down... hit the record button and then ""preform"" your track.  Once you switch over to arrangement, everything will be there as you are used to seeing it.   Instead, from what i understand, what you want to do is use your Push solely as a midi controller instead of a control surface.  In this case, you are bypassing all the control you have over ableton to use your push as a control surface and have to bring your mouse back into the picture.    My advice, use session view for as long as possible before bouncing it over to arrangement view.  Midi recorded in session then bounced over to arrangement is still midi, giving you the ability to manipulate single clips.  Live even takes care of color coding your different clips so when you go into the arrangement view, you can easily identify what is what"

ableton,3barzv,Pargadam,2,Sat Jun 27 12:32:38 2015 UTC,Have you tried saving the Instrument Rack after you've done the search to replace the missing files?
ableton,3barzv,copiccio,2,Sat Jun 27 12:53:52 2015 UTC,"Make sure that in Preferences > Library > ""Collect Files on Export"" is set to Always. Then make sure you're saving the preset to your User Library. Other than that I'm not sure."

If you have less than 8gb, feel free to run 32 bit. Most maintained VST's have a 64 bit available now, it honestly hasn't been an issue for a couple years now."

ableton,3b9c2x,RavenShaven,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:14:57 2015 UTC,Sylenth1 has a 64 bit version now (pretty recent).  I've been using it.
ableton,3b9c2x,MyMomSaysImHot,2,Sat Jun 27 06:29:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's out for Mac yet, but it works great with 32Lives that they recommend."

ableton,3b9c2x,RavenShaven,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:36:17 2015 UTC,"Also,  because of jbridge. Works pretty well.  Saved me a bunch of hassle when I moved to 64"
ableton,3b9c2x,ztch10,3,Sat Jun 27 18:44:42 2015 UTC,It would be nice if 32 bit had an official bridge to 64 bit. Most of my plugins are strictly 32 bit. Maybe it's time to move on.
ableton,3b9c2x,Ejacu1337,3,Sat Jun 27 01:48:07 2015 UTC,"jbridge works pretty well, i havent had a plugin not work with it, and 64bit lets me use all my ram (16gb)"
ableton,3b9c2x,myth1n,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:43:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe it was out of spite, but i had a fubar with jbridge once. It basically reset all my vsts to default and i saved my file. A tear or two later i downgraded to 32 bit again and never looked back. It was a little slower but since i got my ssd into my computer I've barely had any lag issues so it's not an issue for me."
ableton,3b9c2x,Kamtre,3,Mon Jul 6 19:25:36 2015 UTC,64 bit is better for tracking a large number of lanes at once. 32 bit has more plugins available. ( max for live( used to ) and the majority of VSTs run in 32 bit.. These days you don't have that option on OSX
ableton,3b9c2x,Angrycrow,3,Sat Jun 27 01:27:05 2015 UTC,"All the major VSTs I know of have 64bit counterparts (Native Instruments, Waves, iZotope, FabFilter, ect), and max for live is 64 bit. And 64 bit doesn't help track more lanes, it does access more than 4gb of RAM which is a limitation of 32bit Live."
ableton,3b9c2x,jimdajam,2,Sat Jun 27 05:00:15 2015 UTC,"Sylenth1 though :( they're bringing out an OS X version of the sequel to Sylenth1 at some point, but who knows how long that'll be..."
ableton,3b9c2x,sylenthikillyou,0,Sat Jun 27 09:25:43 2015 UTC,Sylenth1 has 64bit according to their website...
ableton,3b9c2x,jimdajam,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:53:03 2015 UTC,"There's a 64bit version for Windows, but they're currently making the 64bit version for OS X. Trust me, once the Mac 64bit version's here, you'll be hearing about it."
ableton,3b9c2x,sylenthikillyou,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:26:26 2015 UTC,There a few few bits of Max that do not function in 64 bit BUT they're mostly involving video and weird math
ableton,3b9c2x,manysounds,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:56:00 2015 UTC,"The Bottom Line  The only difference between 64bit and 32bit is that 64bit lets you access more than 4gb of RAM, so if you don't have more the 4gb of RAM then go 32bit.  If you do and are worried about compatibility issues, yes there are a lot of plugins that don't do 64bit yet, but most (especially all the major developers and MaxForLive) are now 64bit and others will follow pretty soon.  You can use something like jbridge, which works pretty well if you want to still use your 32bit plugs that haven't been updated yet."

ableton,3b7bqz,sharkabroad,2,Fri Jun 26 15:36:12 2015 UTC,"If the MIDI you're sending out is notes in clips, then apply a Swing Groove Pool template to those clips.  If you're playing it in realtime, just play with the swing.  If you're talking about using Live as a MIDI clock source and you want all the slaved devices' own internal sequencers to swing, I don't believe you can do this. Your synths might respond to a CC or something which you could send.  I'm not sure I really understood what you're trying to do though, so I hope this helps!"
ableton,3b7bqz,warriorbob,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:12:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would like to use Live as a midi clock source with all other devices slaved. I was thinking (not an expert here) that I could put that swing on the midi notes being sent out.  By definition, is that possible to do or is swing more velocity of individual notes as opposed to slight timing variations?  Thanks for your help!"
ableton,3b7bqz,warriorbob,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:28:22 2015 UTC,"Where are those ""midi notes being sent out"" originating from?   edit: to clarify, in another comment it sounds like you're sequencing notes on some external sequencer (that has no relation to Live other than being slaved to the clock) but in this comment you're talking about notes coming from Live, which sounds like you're sequencing in Live."
ableton,3b7bqz,warriorbob,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:30:10 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the unclear explanation. Yes, I am sequencing the notes on external sequencers. I am only using Live to record and to act as the master to everything else."
ableton,3b7bqz,altdecay,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:54:56 2015 UTC,"No worries! Okay, cool. As I understand it, the way MIDI clock works like that is basically just a sync for start times and tempo - so there's no concept of ""swing"" that you can transmit from the host. Live's Groove Pool only affects clips within Live, so that's out.  What you can do is set the swing on each individual sequencer. Now, this is kind of annoying since you're trying to keep everything together, but depending on what sequencer you have, you might be able to transmit it a message that it understands.   For example, if your sequencer can set its own swing from a MIDI CC, I imagine you could transmit that CC out an output from some MIDI controller.   The other thing that might work is instead of using MIDI sync, your sequencer might use a system where a quick transient sound can be sent as a clock pulse, and it simply moves to the next step whenever it receives one. If this is the case, you can use a drum hit in a Simpler, make a clip full of 16th notes, and set that clip to be affected by a Groove Pool template. I don't have any experience with this kind of setup, but I've seen people using one of the hits on a 909 as a clock tick, for example.   I hope this all makes sense. I haven't really ever tried to do a setup like yours so I'm kind of speculating, but I hope it helps!"
ableton,3b7bqz,altdecay,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:20:32 2015 UTC,"So as I understand it, you already have the midi clips and notes pre recorded, and then you're just triggering them? I'm a little thrown off by the phrasing ""swing needs to go out in real time"". Are you playing the midi live or is it already recorded?"
ableton,3b7bqz,altdecay,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:02:02 2015 UTC,"rown off by the phrasing ""swing needs to go out in real time"". Are you playing the midi live or is it already recor   My real issue is that I am using step sequencers and they sound robotic. I would like to be able to move the notes' timing slightly, thereby reducing the robotic feeling. I was thinking this was possible via MIDI and ableton's 'swing' feature but I am not sure. I appreciate any thoughts/suggestions."
ableton,3b7bqz,altdecay,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:30:46 2015 UTC,Sounds like Ableton's Groove feature is what you're looking for.
ableton,3b7bqz,altdecay,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:37:34 2015 UTC,"Is it possible though to assign a groove to the outgoing midi? If so, how?"
ableton,3b7bqz,AblerExult,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:53:42 2015 UTC,I don't think you can do it in real time; you have to create a clip and then apply the groove.  I'm still confused though... where is your midi data originating from?
