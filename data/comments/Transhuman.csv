Transhuman,3dsuh6,dannighe,2,Sun Jul 19 21:15:24 2015 UTC,"It is really cool.  It was a trial designed to fix a certain type of genetic blindness in 10 human patients that started back in 2007, using a viral vector to make the genetic changes to the eye, and it worked, the people in the trial recovered at least some vision, and their brains were able to adapt to that and understand the signals they were getting from the eyes.    I guess if you want a corollary, it's that this specific treatment is only for one specific rare kind genetic disorder that causes blindness, Leber’s congenital amaurosis.   But it's still pretty cool."

Transhuman,3dov36,appliedphilosophy,6,Sat Jul 18 01:13:09 2015 UTC,"I didn't know some of these options and viewpoints existed! Gave me an opportunity to look them up. Though I resent the notion that longevity, happiness, and intelligence need to be mutually exclusive. Surely they will co-evolve relatively simultaneously so that people living longer will have access to methods by which they can avoid going crazy/becoming bored/etc!"
Transhuman,3dov36,schlemmla,7,Sat Jul 18 02:57:58 2015 UTC,I felt I had to chose intelligence because it will (hopefully) lead to the other two. In reality I think these things will progress side by side.
Transhuman,3dov36,Sharou,2,Sat Jul 18 10:41:52 2015 UTC,"I put 65% in longevity, 35% in intelligence, and 0% in happiness.

Transhuman,3dov36,Yosarian2,3,Sat Jul 18 13:22:24 2015 UTC,"I just feel like those 3 aspects don't even remotely cover it all. Something like ""security of superintelligence"" should exist IMO. If that was the case I'd probably put 60% on that and 40% on intelligence. As for longevity I just feel that is a somewhat selfish area to put resources into. Don't get me wrong I'm all for it, and I realise all the un-selfish advantages it would give us, and I would so much want to live ""forever"" myself and be able to witness and explore the new era. I just think you can't put too much resources on something selfish when the stakes for the whole species are so high. I want to make damn sure the future will be a good place. Once I'm sure of that I can work towards letting myself see it.   That said I realise that in reality we are never going to put ""all the resources"" towards the development of friendly AI, and that resources that go to SENS and similar organisations probably would not have gone to funding the development of friendly AI anyway. Thus I'm fine with SENS and try to promote them as much as possible. Everything I wrote in my first paragraph is all just to a theoretical scenario where I personally got to allocate all of mankinds resources.   Edit: I actually put 20% in happiness and 80% in intelligence. Because I think human suffering is dangerous and is what makes people into terrorists and other things that could lead to an ""unstable"" or risky singularity. Basically a happier world is a more stable world where there is less risk of, say, an AGI arms race where people forego the security/friendliness research."
Transhuman,3dov36,Sharou,3,Sat Jul 18 13:34:00 2015 UTC,"I just feel like those 3 aspects don't even remotely cover it all.   I've heard a lot of people describe those as ""the three main goals of transhumanism""; it makes sense to try to divide it up that way.      Something like ""security of superintelligence"" should exist IMO. If that was the case I'd probably put 60% on that and 40% on intelligence.    There were other questions in the survey about that.  As I said in a post in the other forum, I think a lot of this probably deals with how fast you think technology is going to advance.  If you think a near-term singularity is likely, then it makes sense to mostly be focused on getting that right and not be too worried about longevity and such, since a singularity would probably take care of that anyway if we do it right.     Personally, I have a lower degree of confidence in a near-term singularity, and so I tend to focus more on incremental progress and self-upgrading, especially in terms of longevity and intelligence.   In general, I think that longevity research isn't ""selfish"", I think that old age and aging-related illnesses (as well as other kinds of medical problems) tend to cause more suffering then anything else in the world right now, and dealing with that has to be a priority, IMHO. (Unless, like I said, you're expecting a near-term singularity, that might make all that unnecessary)."
Transhuman,3dov36,Yosarian2,2,Sat Jul 18 13:44:48 2015 UTC,"I think that old age and aging-related illnesses (as well as other kinds of medical problems) tend to cause more suffering then anything else in the world right now,   I agree completely. But I disagree with your conclusion. No matter how much negative utility aging brings, it's not going to come near the negative utility of a ""failed"" singularity where humanity is wiped out and/or the AI's don't have any meaningful goals or consciousness of their own.  We are talking about an event that could decide the future of the whole galaxy or even the whole hubble volume. If we end up with a ""paperclip maximizer"" that destroys all chances of meaningful life then little else could compare in terms of negative utility.   About timelines, I don't believe in 2045 or anything like that, but even if the singularity happens in say 2120 I still think we need as much time and resources as possible to solve the friendly AI problem until that point. In fact I will be happy if the singularity happens later rather than sooner. I have a hard time seeing a singularity at 2045 coming out alright with the tensions that exist in the world today. I suspect we would see an AGI arms race and things would go out of control.  I guess the main point with friendly AI research is that we can never know we have come ""far enough"" in that area. There is no roof where we can say ""ok, we did it, the singularity will now be 100% safe"". The only way to really know is when it happens, and by then it's too late. Therefore, the more time and resources we have, the better (up to a point, we don't need to get absurd about it).  Edit: I'll say, longevity research could help making the singularity positive, depending on how long before the singularity you think LEV will come (if at all). If there is sufficient time for culture to shift to more long-term thinking in response to LEV and for people to start being less affected by death-induced existential anxiety then we could end up in a much more peaceful and stable world which would help.  Personally I'm not sure there will be a big enough gap between LEV and the singularity. Especially as we can't know for sure when we will reach LEV other than in retrospect. So add maybe another 20 years or something until we can say ""LEV was achieved 20 years ago""."

Sure, agreed.  But to make a utility function you need both the potential utility, and the odds of the event happening.  In the case of friendly AI research, that would be (odds of UFAI this century) * (odds of friendly AI research done this early preventing that.)  So, if I put them both at 10%, that multiples out to about a 1% chance.  That's still a lot, since we're dealing with such huge amounts of potential utility, but it's not clear to me if that comes out to be more utility then, say, a 50% chance of saving billions of lives with anti-aging research.  Don't get me wrong, I'm certanly in favor of friendly AI research; some of the stuff Elon Musk has started funding in that area is actually quite cool.   Really any of this stuff (longevity research, AI/friendly AI research, intelligence enhancement, transhuman technology in general, ect) has such a huge utility value for so little cost it seems insane to me that we're not doing a lot more of all of it."
Transhuman,3dov36,Yosarian2,3,Sat Jul 18 16:10:10 2015 UTC,"I think we are mostly in agreement. But it doesn't hurt to discuss the finer points.  I can't disagree with your basic premise about probabilities, but I have two other disagreements. First off I personally feel the risk of UFAI (including amoral AI) is much higher than 10%, but this is of course highly speculative for both of us (or anyone else). One of the things FAI research could do is make such a number less speculative for everyone, which seems important to me.   Secondly, I think that even at 1%, the utility of FAI research would blow longevity research out of the water. You're talking about a few billion human deaths vs untold quintillions of superhuman minds over the galaxy (or more). Imagine how much life could fit on a dyson swarm in just our solar system. Probably more than we can fathom. Now multiply that with the amount of stars in the galaxy, many of which may have far more extrasolar material to make bigger dyson swarms. No matter what the number ends up as it's going to be incomprehensibly large."

One of the things FAI research could do is make such a number less speculative for everyone, which seems important to me.    (nods)  Like I said, your priorities are going to depend to a large extent on how likely you think certain outcomes are.    I would say that I assign a somewhat lower value to the possibility of ""strong AI rapidly self improving into super-AI sometime this century"" then many transhumanists.   I don't see any reason to think it's impossible, and I'm certanly interested in AI research, but the singularity hypothesis still relies on a lot of unproven assumptions, so there's a significant chance it'll prove to not be true in reality.   Secondly, I think that even at 1%, the utility of FAI research would blow longevity research out of the water. You're talking about a few billion human deaths vs untold quintillions of superhuman minds over the galaxy (or more).   Note that ""a few billion human deaths avoided"" is only the short-term effect of longevity.  Over the same long-term you're talking about, extreme longevity research and associated transhuman technologies could also means trillions or quadrillions of humans and post-humans not dying as we spread across the galaxy.     Of course, if we screw up and destroy ourselves with UFAI or a nanotechnology accident or something now then none of that matters.  It's very tricky to calculate utility in this kind of situations; it depends on a lot of different assumptions, and it also depends on how much you value utility now vs utility in the future.  Most ways of calculating utility have some kind of decay function that assumes utility now is worth more then utility in the future (you basically have to, or else you get answers like ""invest everything forever and never consume everything"" to simple questions, and that doesn't work.)  But all of that is fairly arbitrary, you can define it however you want to.     Edit: Anyway, to be clear, no matter how you crunch the numbers, the main conclusion you come to IMHO is ""we should be spending WAY more resources in both of these areas then we are now"""

I'm working under the assumption that the singularity will happen within at least 1000 years (and I think that's very conservative) and that at that point longevity will be fixed (if it's a positive singularity). So the only loss of utility would be the people who die from now(ish) to then.  But you're right. It all depends on your assumptions. Thanks for the chat :)"

Instead education systems are set up to hinder them, presuming that they will manage just fine without help- and that focus needs to be funnelled towards less intelligent ones.   There is a massive bias against intelligence and intellectual achievement in certain part os population. Eg the ""tall puppy poppy syndrome"".   Intelligence is the giant leveller of social inequality and our society is set up  to counter-act this effect. Imagine if the poor and smart ones were allowed to access positions of power?"

Transhuman,3di9u3,Taek42,6,Thu Jul 16 23:19:39 2015 UTC,"Perhaps there's more to it than that. The act of genetically alter an unborn child's characteristics implies a LOT more than just intelligence enhancement.  If we're already messing with kid's heads to improve their intelligence (i.e. their odds of a successful life) then there's got to be a discussion about what can and cannot be altered. The most obvious one is parents altering their kids to ensure that they're heterosexual. Or ensure that they're completely asexual (Sex distracts from studies and achievement, and you can just make clones if you want grandchildren). Or maybe make them inclined against risky activities and addictions of all sorts. Governments might want to create children who will be naturally compliant to authority.   When you say 'best for their children' you're assuming some premises that may not be universally accepted. And perhaps there's a question as to whether a child is entitled to their own 'genetic destiny.'"

While this may seem an unlikely dystopian scenario, just think how easy it was to pass laws like the patriot act in america when people fear something, in this case terrorists. It's easy to imagine the notion that we should edit crime and violence from future generations getting popular among some segments of some populations in time. I.e. the same kind of people who defend the surveillance state with ""I've got nothing to hide"".), or getting humanity ""locked in"" to a suboptimal gene pool. Directed evolution probably beats natural selection in most ways, but without the randomness of natural evolution we could end up never adding certain traits to the gene pool.

Looks like even advances in brain-computer and neural interfaces are more significant than in gene editing, so it's going to be commercialized faster.

Transhuman,3cwzhu,alexgmcm,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:53:56 2015 UTC,"Then surely nootropics, PED's etc. would fall under it as well.   Well, any sort of permanent change that would make you no longer fall under ""biological human"". Humans don't have magnet senses. And adding a magnet is a permanent change (at least until you get a thing to remove it).   Also any kind of EMG controlled prosthetic. (Or even the rare ones that connect to the nerves themselves.)   Yea, any permanently attached prosthetic, and especially the ones that are able to be controlled by the user (rather than simply being attached), would count as well in my book. Seeing as that's the first step to having a fully prosthetic body (a 'full' transhuman).  As I said, transhuman meaning ""no longer human"". We have some stuff to do that already, but they are just mostly minor changes. So perhaps it wouldn't make you completely qualify, but those are the type of things I'd imagine for transhumans. Not ""wearable tech""."
Transhuman,3cwzhu,Kafke,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:34:32 2015 UTC,"As I said, transhuman meaning ""no longer human"".   That's not quite how I define it.  I would say that transhuman is the intermediate step between human and posthuman.  When you become a posthuman being, then you're no longer human, but during the transhuman period you're still in a period of transition; a transhuman is still basically human, just ""human +"".    The other distinction that's probably worth making is that a lot of technology (prosthetic, bionic eyes, medicines, ect) are usually being used to restore people up back towards a normal human level; that's a great thing and a big step forwards for out species, but not quite transhumanism.  That technology becomes ""transhumanist"" when it actually surpasses the human level and lets people start to function at a higher level then the human default in some sense.  I do think that wearables can be transhuamnist, depending on how they're used.   Fundamentally there's not that much difference in some cases between wearable technology and implantable technology, except that wearable technology can be taken on and off more easily."

I've always thought of it as similar to 'transgender'. Transgender people aren't ""in-between genders"", but rather have transitioned from one to the other.   That technology becomes ""transhumanist"" when it actually surpasses the human level and lets people start to function at a higher level then the human default in some sense.   Agreed. But IMO it has to be a semi-permanent change to your body. Not a wearable. Anything that is distinctly 'not human', but becomes a part of your body, I'd consider to be transhuman. Regardless of the functionality provided. That is, say I have a surgery done to remove my eyes, and replace them with bionic eyes that do pretty much the same thing. I'd be transhuman, despite not gaining any new 'abilities'.  Likewise, if I replace every part of my body in that manner, I'd be a robot, not a human. To say I'm not transhuman at that point is silly.  Certainly someone with just one change isn't a 'full' transhuman. But those are certainly the first step to transhumanism.   I do think that wearables can be transhuamnist, depending on how they're used.    I have to fundamentally disagree. Transhuman implies you are no longer human. Wearables don't change that fact. You can be covered in wearables and still be human (just take them off). I do think that wearables are going to pave the way to transhumans, and I think they'll get people warmed up to the idea. But they in themselves don't make someone transhuman.   Fundamentally there's not that much difference in some cases between wearable technology and implantable technology, except that wearable technology can be taken on and off more easily.   That's the point. If you can 'take it off' it's not part of you. Meaning you aren't any different, physically. Which means you are still human and not transhuman.  In terms of functionality/tech, wearables can get pretty damn close.  But wearables will never be able to do things that a transhuman can do. Stuff like mind uploads, body swapping, removing biological needs,  etc.  With wearables, you are still distinctly human, not transhuman.  If you have to take of your device and plug it in, that's not a part of you. It's just something you put on.  Likewise, I don't consider my clothes to be a part of me. I'm not transhuman simply because I wear a jacket."

That wasn't how FM-2030 defined the term; ""transhuman"" is supposed to mean a transitional phase between ""human"" and ""post-human"".  It's also worth mentioning that transhuman seems to be an older term then transgender; it's not a directly related concept.   But IMO it has to be a semi-permanent change to your body. Not a wearable.   Person 1 wears glasses that give him super-human vision.  Person 2 replaces his eyeballs with eyeballs that give him super-human vision.  For all practical purposes, if the results are exactally the same, what's the difference?  In fact, IMHO, the biggest difference here is that person 2 can easily switch to a better pair of glasses when the technology improves, person 1 can't.   So person 2 will probably ""upgrade"" earlier and faster overall.  I do get the counterargument, which is that transhuman tech should upgrade the person and not just give them a better tool.

Transhuman,3cwzhu,Yosarian2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:22:50 2015 UTC,"That wasn't how FM-2030 defined the term; ""transhuman"" is supposed to mean a transitional phase between ""human"" and ""post-human"".   Certainly. And again, it's the same usage as transgender. They might be in-between (in the process of switching), but it's largely used to describe people who have already made the transition.  Likewise, as I said, 'transhuman' describes something distinctly ""not human"". That is, something has been changed to make 'human' no longer an apt description. And going forward, I think 'transhuman' is going to be the catch all for anyone who's moved on from being 100% bio.   Person 1 wears glasses that give him super-human vision.   Still a human. At best the classes can provide a screen which his actual eyes see. This will always be dependent on his biological parts, as well as an outside source. That is, if his eyes are damaged, the glasses are useless. And the glasses need to be taken off to 'charge'. They are distinctly not a part of the individual, who's still human.   Person 2 replaces his eyeballs with eyeballs that give him super-human vision.   The robotic eyes are now a part of this person. They are unable to be removed without physically altering the individual. There is no intermediate step between the robotic eyes and the person. The eyes do not need to be removed in order to charge. And are largely considered to be part of the individual. Clearly some sort of altered human (cyborg).   For all practical purposes, if the results are exactally the same, what's the difference?   The results are not the same though. One is dependent on a biological part that can be easily damaged, and it's easily replaceable and needs to be separately charged. The other is not dependent on anything but the individual, is considered a body part, it's not easily replaceable (might be in the future), and does not need to be separately charged.  Huge difference. If you presented me with both options, I'd go with the replacement (given the operation is 100% perfect, and it's safe/proven to work). Replacement eyes will always give you better vision than external glasses.   In fact, IMHO, the biggest difference here is that person 2 can easily switch to a better pair of glasses when the technology improves, person 1 can't.   That's because person 1 is a human using wearable technology, while person 2 actually has robotic eyes. Person 2 is a transhuman/cyborg, while person 1 is just a regular human that's wearing technology. That's the difference.  Otherwise you could argue that nearly everyone is a transhuman, since we already have wearables that improve your vision, connect to the internet, track your health, etc. No. Wearable=/=transhuman.  A transhuman is literally someone who is no longer 100% human. A wearable technology does not change that fact. They are indeed still human after putting on or taking off the tech. Just like clothing doesn't make you a transhuman, neither does tech clothing.  I don't see transhuman as explicitly related to technology or silicon. Though that's almost certainly how it's going to happen. Nor do I see it as necessarily an improvement. It could just be a replacement.   which is that transhuman tech should upgrade the person and not just give them a better tool.   No. Transhuman tech must necessarily change the person. Not augment them. Not upgrade them. Change them. One example of a transhuman could be someone who had their legs removed and instead got wheels. Not necessarily an improvement, but it's a change.  Clothes don't make you a transhuman. Electronic clothes don't make you a transhuman. Improved abilities don't make you a transhuman. Only once you are no longer 100% human are you a transhuman.  We already have transhumans. But they aren't the fuckers wearing fitbits and google glass. They are people like Neil Harbisson who's legally recognized as the world's first cyborg. They are people like those grinders who have magnet implants. Those are transhumans. Not some tech enthusiast who uses oculus rift once in a while.   That's why I would say that wearables are borderline transhuman; they're a step closer, at least.   Functionally, I agree. They do roughly the same things we should expect from actual transhumans. And will get people warmed up to the idea of augmenting or changing how they behave and function, and what kind of information they can sense. Not really transhuman, but it's almost the first step.   Eh. If you can make an advanced enough brain-scanner, you may be able to create brain-computer interface stuff without needing invasive surgery.    A mind upload, body swapping, removing biological needs, etc. are all things you can't do without altering your definition of the individual. If they body swap, by definition they are no longer human. If you mind upload, you are by definition no longer human. If you remove biological needs, you are by definition no longer human.  All of these are fairly permanent changes that fundamentally change the definition of what the person is. Nor will a wearable ever be able to achieve that stuff, given that it physically alters the person.  It's not so much about invasive surgery as it is changing what the person is.   I'd have a hard time calling that ""not transhuman"".   Which one of those things will be able to be done without invasive surgery? Mind uploads, maybe. Body swapping is a definite no (you fundamentally remove the mind of an individual and replace all the body parts). And removing bio needs is also a definite no (perhaps cutting into them and removing bio organs, or body swapping to something without those needs).  It's not surgery that makes it transhuman. It's no longer being human that makes it transhuman. With wearables, you are still human. Bottom line. Regardless of what features it replicates or gives you.  No one will ever look at a wearable tech and say ""this is me now""."

Plus I'm not opposed to sharing if he were to find someone willing to swing that way. He's not yet taken me up on the offer (though we've gone to strip clubs together and had an awesome time - and how many married couples can say that?), but I don't ever have to feel threatened by him looking at other women because he is respectful of the parameters we agreed on and puts our relationship first.

I will say, personally, that I like the idea of marriage, independent of religion. Even though we are seeing an emergence of a society where commitment is unnecessary due to a plethora of choices, I have no problem with a 1000+ year marriage.

Transhuman,3cedt7,Thomas-Kite,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:05:16 2015 UTC,"The actual article wasn't as anti-marriage as the headline seemed. I agree with you in a scenario where a sense of individual self persisted. However, maybe the bigger question is whether, in a radically transhumanist future, we'd still perceive ourselves as separate entities that could commit to other distinct entities. He doesn't really explore the possibility of commitment/union transcending identity to go to a more intimate level than it ever has in human history, as in a total union of consciousness. So, obsolescence of marriage wouldn't necessarily have to mean an obsolescence of lifetime commitment."
Transhuman,3cedt7,ubersapiens,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:52:17 2015 UTC,"I agree, the article wasn't really anti-marriage. Rather, I think the author wanted us to think about the concept of marriage in the future.   I don't see why we wouldn't still perceive ourselves as separate entities. I've always thought that a transhumanist future would lead to very different ways of life depending on the individuals philosophy.    For example, when technology becomes advanced enough we can choose whether we want assimilate ourselves with the larger collective, or if we would rather stay independent. There may be a point after immortality where some people don't want to ""upgrade"" themselves anymore and that would be okay. Likewise, we'd have the option to forgo relationships altogether or have engage in even more intimate, monogamous relationships depending on our choice. Whether that relationship is a merge of consciousness or simple hormonal bio-hacking, I'm sure the future will have many different people living many different lives rather than all of humanity going down a singular path."

Transhuman,3cedt7,TheAethereal,7,Tue Jul 7 12:39:18 2015 UTC,"I do agree that what we consider marriage as it is right now will be obsolete once we start achieving the milestones the author mentioned (external pregnancy, gender swapping, consciousness upload [did anyone see Chappie? I loved that movie], longevity past 100s of years). But I think several of those are a long way to go. Maybe we'll have serial marriages? Some people already have them.   I think of all of those keystones, the longevity one is the one that's gonna make marriage change. Few first-time marriages make it to ""end do us part"" these days, even fewer being happy in it, and that's only being 50+ years married. Imagine being married for a hundred. Or two hundred. That's a lot. All the rest can be worked out inside a relationship."
Transhuman,3cedt7,flyinthesoup,5,Tue Jul 7 09:03:43 2015 UTC,"But I have to ask, then.  Why would marriage exist at all?  The whole point of the concept was that you pledge to be together and raise a family so you can provide a stable home for said kids and not upset each other.  It's basically a byproduct of our instinct to want our OWN genes to continue, while NOT that other guys.  We just got too smart and had to make an institution out of an instinct.  So logically speaking initially it makes no sense even now, because we have awareness, to even have the institution exist, but then add in that offspring don't need this anymore because they are provided for whether the parents act as a team or not, and then add in the long life... why bother having it exist at all?

Transhuman,3cedt7,Zagaroth,3,Tue Jul 7 12:33:29 2015 UTC,"My wife and I met in our mid 30's, got married at the age of 38 (3 months apart in age). Neither of us has married before because we never met some one before who evoked that level of love and trust and happiness. We each had waited until we were mature enough and met a mature enough partner that just fit together perfectly.   and we aren't even a 100% match, cause no one is. She's mono-sexual (ie, once in a committed relationship, as long as the relationship is healthy she doesn't really see others as a potential sexual partner, even if she recognizes them as attractive.) I am a more normal hetero-male, in that part of me registers all attractive women as potential sex partners, but i value loyalty and the idea of hurting my wife causes me emotional distress and pain, so the attraction remains merely a passing fancy to never be acted upon, and i am OK with that.  as time goes on, our bonds deepen and strengthen. We don't cling together out of necessity or fear of being alone, we just like and love each other so much that being together is what makes both of us happy.   The flip side is that when I saw this relationship as a deepening thing with long enduring potential, hopefully life long, I took what I knew about bonding and the chemicals associated with it in the brain and manipulated situations to increase bonding. And I did it with her knowledge and consent (yeah, we are both geeks. It made her happy that I wanted to go through the effort of enhancing our feelings for each other that way.)  Pair bonding comes naturally to humans. So does cheating, and never settling down, and monogamy, and polygamy. Just as we should not try to define people for gender differences (Identity and/or orientation), neither should we set a standard saying that there is only one way to have relationships."

Will we have to keep them intentionally, and if so will we?    I don't know of course, but it's interesting.    I don't like the whole ""Keep things natural"" argument because what is natural is always changing anyway, and now evolution of our species is already basically under our control.  So then I'd have to ask, isn't ANYTHING we do natural since we are part of the natural universe and were probably destined to learn enough that we could choose what we do with it?  It's a tricky topic.  Ethics is a huge thing, but how in the world do you define something as ethical or not in a world where there are no boundaries to what we can do and no clear definition of what natural even means since we create it ourselves.

Marriage was created at a time when life expectancy was so much lower than it is now, it's inevitable that if people have freedom, there will be failed marriages.  Life-long love is made up, it's a fantasy. Pair bonding lasts as long as it lasts, it's only life long if you die before it ends.

However, the rest of the article does a fine job of presenting a history of the cryonics ""movement"", such as it is.

Until then, it will always be a controversial position. This is something you have to educate yourself on to decide whether you find it plausible enough. You will simply have to go through some of the introductory materials like the Cryonics FAQ, Alcor's materials, Mike Darwin's blog-history-criticism (starting at the first posts), the Brain Preservation Foundation's papers, and so on. (One specific paper I will mention, because it's recent enough that it won't be in most cryonics writings but is important, is ""Persistence of Long-Term Memory in Vitrified and Revived C. elegans"", Vita-More & Barranco 2015.) Almost all the questions and objections and observations which someone might make here have already been written down and debated ad nauseam, so you might as well start with the less extemporaneous materials... And then decide for yourself whether they make a good case for minds being material objects which can be cryogenically stored, that the current procedures at Alcor and CI are adequate to the task, how well one can be revived/uploaded, and whether it's worth the not-inconsiderable cost."
Transhuman,3bxnn6,gwern,2,Fri Jul 3 21:44:19 2015 UTC,"I think the broader point of the cryonics movement is that the time will eventually come when people can be resuscitated from whatever disease killed them, the death that comes with old age, and/or the damage inflicted by the preservation process.  The cruder and ""less viable"" the process, then (hypothetically) the longer it would take before one could be revived. (For all we know, the time will someday come when anybody can be revived from so little as a hair follicle.)  The only problems with this perspective are that   medical science may never reach a point that they can revive a cryogenically preserved person (humanity might blow itself up or maybe brain death is just an unsolvable problem,) medical science can revive from a kind of ""stasis"" but may never reach a point where reversing the cryogenic preservation process is feasible (perhaps the original cause of death can't be reversed, or early preservation methods are too primitive, or newly-""defrosted"" humans can't be successfully inoculated against the future's novel diseases), or people decide not to revive the cryogenically preserved (the process may be legally prohibited or considered immoral, or the preserved may present a risk of harboring old diseases, or maybe future civilization deems those from our time period to be too morally or intellectually primitive to be worth saving - tl;dr they don't want a bunch of old-fashioned fuddy-duddies around.)   Personally, I think that human ingenuity is only limited by the end of the universe and, more immediately, our ability to blow ourselves up. So I think the current methods will eventually be viable.

Transhuman,3bpyzw,erenthia,2,Wed Jul 1 23:54:54 2015 UTC,Yeah I didn't really like that. They did more than imply it they straight up said it. Zoltan is a terrible representative of transhumanism imo.
Transhuman,3bpyzw,creepystains,3,Thu Jul 2 02:02:04 2015 UTC,"I almost said that but then I realized they called him the leader of the ""transhumanist party"" which he technically is.  I'm guessing it's a party of one.  And I totally agree with you about him being a terrible representative of transhumanism.  I can't think of a worse one actually.  Kurzweil is actually half-way decent.  Bostrom is good.  Max Moore is good.  Yudkowsky...YMMV but I like him.  I'd be impressed if anyone could come up with someone worse than Zoltan."
Transhuman,3bpyzw,erenthia,3,Thu Jul 2 03:34:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge Kurzweil fan because he pushes the 2045/singularity thing way too much. Max Moore is only good one I know but I haven't heard about Bostrom or Yudkowsky yet. I guess you're right about the transhumanist party thing. When I first found out he was running for president I was excited I'd have a president I could vote for and not think of it as the ""least bad"" vote, but as I learned more about Zoltan over time the choice became depressing again."
Transhuman,3bpyzw,creepystains,2,Thu Jul 2 03:41:17 2015 UTC,"I used to be a fan of Kurzweil, and I still like him.  He reminds me of Freud in his unwillingness to take on new data and revise his theories.  When I take a moment to look at Kurzweil from a wider lens he isn't actually that bad, but when you compare him to other futurists and transhumanists he really doesn't hold up.  (Still not as bad of Zoltan though)  Bostrom is more focused on AI.  His book Superintelligence has influenced people like Elon Musk and Steven Hawking in their thinking.  He's an Oxford professor and pretty significant in futurist/transhumanist circles.  Check him out.    Eliezer Yudkowsky is one of the most controversial, even more than Kurzweil.  Most famously known for lesswrong.com hpmor.com and being a founding member of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI).  Also commonly accused of being a cult leader, which frankly I don't think is fair.  The Less Wrong community is a little odd, but calling them a cult is just ad hominem."

Transhuman,3ap2h2,invitroveritas8,5,Mon Jun 22 10:37:19 2015 UTC,"This sort of response is exactly why the anti-augmentation issues of the Deus Ex franchise are going to be hitting home once there is an actual widespread adoption of trans-human tech.   Ideologues who demand we remain ""pure-humans"" such as religious groups, holistic medicine types, and likely those of some secular philosophies are going to resent any advantage augmentation provides. It will be more of the ""playing god"" issues, which are empty assumptions to scare and whip people into a frenzy. Those who I see as most likely to fall in line with that mentality are those who are intimidated by the tech, but particularly those who are unable to afford it themselves, because of the reasons you're talking about.   Like with other tech adoption, once the price barrier was removed, a lot of the bodies behind opposition would likely fade, but the hostility will likely remain deeply rooted and propped up by somewhat powerful groups.   What's scariest about the issue is how it immediately becomes ""us vs. them"", human vs. inhuman. Parallels with racism and homophobia are going to crop back up, and I would not be surprised if violent clashes or attacks take place, resulting in governmental measures to placate the the public, like required aug-registration, but with anti-discrimination legislation."

They're not going to worry about long-term effects, or about population, or whatever, any more then corporations worry about the environmental consequences of the things they do today; they're just going to do it because it's the best way to make money, which is literally the only thing corporations care about.

Transhuman,397787,CptSpace,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:08:38 2015 UTC,"poorly.  Artificial hands without exception have preset grip patterns which you can activate and control.  There are two arms here, the MPL first and the DEKA arm (luke) actually being worn.  Luke is the Kamen arm, and is an incredible, groundbreaking piece of work and probably the most famous prosthetic limb.  Visually the MPL outshines it here.  Theres an upper ceiling to what we can accomplish with our current techniques,  I think.  Traumatic injury destroys and injures nerves and they atrophy very easily (both the nerves themselves and the brains ability to activate them), and are difficult to save.  Even an elective surgery which relocated the nerves would have a difficult time retaining good function.  Then on top of that, you have to read the nerves through the skin, and that gets very difficult and inconvenient, so you're working with sketchy data, and moving the sensory nerves is pretty much out of the question.    In traumatic injuries as far as i know there's pretty much no way to save the nerves of the hand, so you're limited to activating other nerves to control parts of the arm.  My own personal idea is to have three nerves control the xyz position of the hand, and let the arm figure out the kinematics of positioning etc, but I think thats about the best you could do.  Anyway the MPL: 109 sensors including temperature, 26 DOF, 35lb payload, 70 lb grip, looks like titanium.  Its realistic for an anemic 12 year old, but its pretty stunning nonetheless especially since its modular.

Transhuman,390bk5,RedErin,3,Tue Jun 9 15:16:16 2015 UTC,"Just off the top of my head:   Compare fossil fuel to solar as an example of technological progress leading to less impact on the ecosystem, as well as how fusion would lead to the end of most pollution basically indefinitely. On a wider scale, focus on the idea that ecological destruction is a symptom of not enough technological progress, not too much like most people tend to think. Highlight that only technological progress gives us the chance at nature reclamation, otherwise we'll always just be fighting a losing battle for what's left. All humans, even us technophiles, love beauty. And very few people, ourselves included, would think of a old-school cyberpunk dystopia as beautiful. (My personal example is comparing the original Ghost in the Shell's backgrounds to those of Stand Alone Complex in terms of visual appeal, but any cyberpunk vs post-cyberpunk or utopian SF will do). Likewise, we all desire autonomy, freedom, & leisure, technological progress is our best shot at those (rather than being another cog in the ""capitalist machine"", which would be nearly inevitable in the event of technological stagnation).   Basically, deduce what these kinds of groups want (a saved/preserved natural world and ecosystem, a sense of community, and leisure time), then show how continue technological development is a better plan to give us that than stepping on the breaks. Come up with concrete examples that change that truly benefits the working class/poor most really is possible (solar including tesla, open-source, basic income, etc).  Oh, and always be ready for claims that the ""man"" will hold us back and the status quo is unbeatable. I use knowledge of economics for this mostly, and show them historical examples of times when the laws of economics bit the previously-privledged class in the ass (competition doesn't care if a firm is entrenched, creative destruction, improvements in the 3rd world, etc)."

I think I already mentioned both of those points in my post.  Like I said, interacting with other people in VR, or using VR to share fiction with other people, and so on, is fine; it's just when you start to ""disapper down the rabbit hole"" that I think it's concerning.  That being said, ""real world"" doesn't just mean other people.  It means real life forms as well.    Interacting with a virtual pet or walking through a virtual forest doesn't have nearly the same appeal as walking through real trees with my real dog.   (At least, until we get to the point where we can do full brain emulations of animals, at which point the line between ""real dog"" and ""virtual dog"" starts to become a little fuzzy.)   About advancing human progress, it's done mostly by science. VR, in that case, is preferable environment(except when you experiment in RL).   Trying to do science or tinker with technology in VR is fundamentally limited by what our understanding of the universe is when we create the VR program and how well we can simulate that.  Although VR still will probably be a useful tool, it's not going to be a substitute for reality.  Anyway, science is part of it.  So is technology, so is creating infrastructure that will help others, so is social progress, and cultural progress, and political progress, so is educating other people, so is developing new ideas and new ways of seeing the world, so is increasing our species ""economic"" abilities in terms of resources we have access to and using those to further improve our condition, so is physically upgrading our bodies and minds with transhuman technology, and so is exploring and expanding into the universe.    And, yes, some of that can be done in VR in some cases.   Like I said, I'm not anti-VR.    It's just a question of how the technology is used that's key.    I mean, one possible solution to the Fermi paradox is that most species develop VR and then never do anything interesting in the real world ever again, basically just vanishing into fantasy.

I view that as an extensional threat to the future our species, perhaps one more dangerous then AI or nuclear weapons.   It's possible that we will hit a wall. Simply, further progress will be impossible. Science will stop, because we couldn't discover anything more. Or it would be too costly.  About space exploration, meh. Could be fun for a while, but ultimately, there is nothing exceptional in different stars. Or planet. All basically floating rocks.  Life is only interesting thing, and especially intelligent life.  When you come to such limits, what do you do? Use your intelligence and imagination to create interesting things. To customize enviroment further. Humans are different from other animals mainly in that aspect. We change our enviroment, adapt it. VR is the crown of customizing enviroment. You use all mass you can to develop Matrioshka brain. You run all people here. You run animals, if you want. And there, you could accomplish anything.  It's just freedom of laws of physics(apart these that dictate how much energy and computational power you get). You could develop enviroment that is exactly like previous was. You could recreate entire earth, indistinguishable from original to our perceived complexity. You don't need to simulate atoms, or quarks,because e don't see them anyway. If we get microscope, then simulation can simulate them as well.  ""Dumb"" matter is just waste of computational power. I really don't see a difference between spending time in simulated earth vs spending time on real thing, if it's the same for me.  For me, personally, best future would be Matrioshka brain and interacting with the Universe in the space. It's not limiting in any way.  No civilization would shut itself in Matrioshka brain and burn all bridges. It would be foolish. It would be dangerous as well.  All I am saying is that clinging to the ""real"" thing, to walk on ""real"" ground, solely because it's build from atoms and not from software is foolish.  It's not even more real than VR. Laws of physics are just fundamental algorithms that govern our world. Saying that it's more ""valuable"" than things in VR is like saying that Virtual Machines are something other than real PC's.  It's just layer of abstraction. VR object is the same as real object, except we can't tinker in real object.  If one day we will know that we're all simulations and there is civilization upon us who built it, inside their ""real"" universe, would it make us worthless? Would it make our universe worthless or inferior?  And, again, I agree with you 100% that we shouldn't shut ourselves entirely into VR. We should have impact on our Universe too. It's just not as user friendly as our VR man made world, so I wouldn't really ""hang out"" there. Just work or gather data."

With very strong art style, you might be able to take less complex input and make a unique enjoyable experience out of it. For the long term, however, more complexity is needed. There's a lot more to our senses than what we see and hear, and creating it all in a believable environment will still take a lot of effort. Even more difficult will be managing it if it's bug-ridden. That's why replicating the real world as much as possible can be valuable. It's something we know works, so management will be easier if we can recreate it. On top of that is the real advantage of VR, the absence of consequences for our actions.

Of course, and that's obviously fine.  Like I said, morphological freedom.  But that's not likely to be the only way of being in the future.  And not only that, but standards of beauty tend to change as society changes; if we start making big changes to our body for practical reasons (like longevity, intelligence, dexterity, strength, mind-computer interfaces, increased sensory perception, increased ability to thrive in zero-gravity or on Mars, and so on) that's likely to result in some people who look very different from the human norm, just for practical reasons.    Most likely the ideal of beauty will to some extent expand to accommodate that; and, in fact, if we want to encourage mass acceptance and tolerance among the general population of transhumanist modifications along those lines, expanding the idea of beauty is likely to be helpful.

There's nothing wrong with transhuman art that depicts some people modifying themselves to fit some ideal of beauty; I'm not terribly interested in that kind of purely ascetic modifications but I completely believe people should have the right to do that, and I'm sure some people will.  The issue the article was discussing is that the art seems to all be focused in that direction, and so it doesn't really show the kind of freedom and options and choices that are central to the ideals of transhumanism."

None of those things paint you in a positive light here.   The art doesn't imply shit. You infer shit. That simple. The art is what the artist wants it to be, the art is merely an expression of the artist on a medium. If you want to put politics into that, that's on you. Don't make it out like every transhumanist artist is out to get you.   Communication is a two-way street.   And, yes, art is a form of communication.   If you think you are trying to communicate one thing, but everyone else in the word hears something different, then blaming everyone else for that is totally foolish and self-defeating.  Also, ""everyone is out to get you""?  Where did that weird paranoia stuff come from?   Wait, there's a transhuman bible out there that everyone who claims to be a transhumanist must adhere to? Well, colour me surprised.   There are certain ideals that are basically universal to transhumanists, yes.  One is the idea of morphological freedom, the idea that everyone has the basic right to upgrade and change their own bodies however they want.   If you think that everyone should be required to become identical to each other no matter what they personally want, then you're probably not a transhumanist."
Transhuman,390bk5,Yosarian2,2,Tue Jun 9 01:38:59 2015 UTC,I'm starting to get turned away from transhumanism because this crowd is shuffling in... I agree with you but it seems nobody understands what transhumanism is about and what is needed for it to work anymore. It's really depressing to think about it. The majority of people that were attracted to transhumanism are the very people that would stunt its growth.
Transhuman,390bk5,creepystains,3,Tue Jun 9 02:49:56 2015 UTC,"Don't think like that.  The movement is still very small, and very fluid, with lots of different people from different worldviews involved.   Some people are going to disagree with some things you agree with, and that's fine; but to a large extent we're going to determine what transhumanist culture is going to look like as the movement grows.      Also, transhumanist issues are so important that it's vital to get a coalition together to push them forwards, and not everyone in that coalition is going to agree on everything.   That's the only way anything ever gets done in a democracy.   For example, liberal transhumanists and libertarian transhumanists are going to disagree on economic issues, and that's fine; we can still all work together on transhumanist issues."

If it is all about morphological freedom, why don't you let people create art of what they think would be cool morphologically free posthumans?

Transhuman,390bk5,Decabowl,6,Tue Jun 9 02:22:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you for saying this, because it seems you, like the author is against it.   Not at all true.  The author's point wasn't that transhuman art is bad, just that there should be more types of it then there are now, because the kinds of transhuman future we want to see are ones where there is freedom, options, and choices, where there is a range of human diversity, so it doesn't make sense for every single transhuman artwork to look exactally the same.   If it is all about morphological freedom, why don't you let people create art of what they think would be cool morphologically free posthumans?   No one is trying to ""not let people create art"" of whatever kind they want here.   You're really missing the whole point here.   The author is trying to encourage creativity, not censor anyone.   Or is is just morphological freedom when you agree with it?    Of course not.      Or are you in fact saying that people should not be morphological free in the future to assume the forms that are depicted in the art you find oh so offensive?   Nobody said that either.  Nor did anyone say that that art was ""offensive"" or that ""nobody should be allowed to assume those forms.""   I think that kind of art is quite cool, and no one here has said otherwise.   I smell projection. I just want to give artists the freedom to do what they want. You seem to be the 1950s republican that wants to ban sexy women.   I have to say, you're reading all kinds of weird and bizarre things into my posts that were never there at all.  By your own logic, that clearly must be 100% your fault and your own ""projection"" and not my problem. ;)  Nobody wants to ""ban art"".   Nobody has a problem with ""sexy women"".   Nobody has even said that the kind of smooth android transhuman art is ""wrong"" or ""bad"", just that having that exist and basically nothing else is unimaginative, narrow, and is not coming close to portraying anything like the full range of biological, cybernetic, and technological freedom and variety we actually would like to see in the future."
Transhuman,390bk5,Yosarian2,3,Tue Jun 9 09:31:14 2015 UTC,"I think this discussion would benefit by making a distinction between two purposes of art here:  1) Art as a means of satisfying the creator's need for free expression and their desire to communicate something they personally find inspiring.  2) Art as a means of influencing the mindset and attitude of a population of viewers in some desired fashion. (You might make a case that this qualifies as propaganda.)   For someone who is only inspired by cold, clean technological beauty and recoils at the idea of organic beauty, creating art that satisfies the second purpose and attempts to inspire people with organic beauty is both likely to be unsuccessful and is likely to make fulfilling the first purpose impossible. So I can see how you might balk at the idea of telling these people what they should create. I would say to these people: keep creating the art that inspires you and others like you. You will satisfy your own need for self expression and simultaneously, if you are talented, influence anyone who also likes modern aesthetics.   But to those artists who just happen to see beauty in both artificial designs and in the messiness of nature, it is worth pointing out and reminding them that creating works of art that link transhumanism to organic beauty is more likely to push transhumanism further into the mainstream culture. They can both honestly communicate the beauty they find in nature and inspire people to overcome the limitations of being human.  Personally, I love most of the current technological transhumanist artwork out there, but I can't think of any friends or acquaintances in my demographic and area (young female, rural town) who would be inspired in the slightest to learn more about transhumanism from the artwork that's available. At it's core transhumanism is appealing to anyone who seeks to overcome limitations (i.e. all of humanity); it just takes the right introduction to push certain people into taking it seriously enough to learn more."
Transhuman,390bk5,dbird90,-1,Tue Jun 9 04:17:06 2015 UTC,"it is worth pointing out and reminding them   That your opinion is the right one?   works of art that link transhumanism to organic beauty is more likely to push transhumanism further into the mainstream culture   So yes, that your opinion is the right one. Or do you have peer reviewed evidence that mainstream culture will only embrace transhumanism if it is done so by a Bambi and Pocahontas?   who would be inspired in the slightest to learn more about transhumanism from the artwork that's available   If artwork is what stops you from getting into a political or philosophical group then you have bigger problems than the artwork. Seriously, if someone is stopped from embracing transhumanism because they see a sexy cyborg, that just tells me they are weak in the head."
Transhuman,390bk5,Decabowl,4,Tue Jun 9 04:30:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, what I stated is my opinion that I think is worth pointing out to them.  Restricting yourself from a philosophical group due to surface appearances is admittedly a personal flaw. But when your goal is to get  these people, flaws and all, to think seriously about transhumanism, the issue to concern yourself with is how to overcome these personal issues that cause them to stay away. Skirting these personal flaws can be as simple for some artists as shifting the focus of their artwork from one subject that they find inspiring to another."
Transhuman,390bk5,dbird90,-1,Tue Jun 9 04:53:50 2015 UTC,So you're saying transhumanism must pander to every demographic and every artist must change or censor their work so that noone at all is uncomfortable? Because that is what it sounds like. Because it won't only be your demographic that dislikes something about transhumanism and demands that bit to be changed so they will join. It will be every demographic.   Your line of thinking will lead to bland and generic transhumanism that is no different to any other political idea of the day because it tries to be so inoffensive that everyone will like it.
Transhuman,390bk5,Decabowl,4,Tue Jun 9 05:01:24 2015 UTC,"I am advocating more diversity in the types of artwork produced, not censorship. Keep all of the current technological art and create more; there is nothing wrong with it, and it continues to bring people to the movement!  But adding other aesthetics to the mix will just inspire additional people."
Transhuman,390bk5,dbird90,-3,Tue Jun 9 05:13:00 2015 UTC,"Wait, so now the hyphenating self-labeling un-self-aware cretins from the anarcho-tumblrsphere are invading and co-opting? No way, almost as if they are looking for fringe identity politics allies to exploit and pander to!  This discussion (much like the gender identity of AI) doesn't belong here. Because it is meaningless drivel propounded by people who are not scientifically or technologically capable of pushing transhumanism forward  in any real way. Instead they latch on parasitically in an effort to find meaning in labels and signaling.  So human it hurts to watch. This is what I want to leave behind on the ash heap of history."

Transhuman,38r0pm,Neurofiend,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:46:28 2015 UTC,"Theoretically, sure.     We might be able to do head transplants onto donor bodies (bodies of people who end up brain dead and have agreed to donate their bodies for organ transplant) sometime in the fairly near future, but that doesn't really scale by itself.   Cloning entire human bodies without heads and growing them into adults is something that might theoretically be possible, but we're nowhere close to it, and honestly I don't even know of anyone who's working on that area of research.  And then there's the massive trauma and risk of the transplant, not to mention that the head and brain continue to age.  The whole thing may be is theoretically possible, but as likely near-future life extension strategies go, I wouldn't put it the top 5.  Still, it's not totally out of the question."

An older classic somewhat along those same lines is The Futurological Congress by Lem Stanislaw. Not the easiest read, but absolutely mind blowing. Can't recommend this one enough!  The Quantum Thief by Hannu Rajaniemi is also a must read. Deals with a lot of really great technology that could definitely be considered transhumanism."

In a near future where cloud-computed AI is possible, but prohibitively expensive, any uploaded body perceives the computational shortcuts for their existence as a pervading sense of suicidal dread.

Six million years ago, the first human clades expanded across the galaxy, cloned and mutated from a handful of people. One clade gathers for its thirtieth two-hundred-thousand-year reunion, a planetwide party lasting a century - and the entire planet is reduced to dust. The latecomers, sixty descendents of a woman who became a civilization, reach back into their earliest memories as a young girl for clues about this betrayal.   Schismatrix.

There is a lot of political rivalry style conflicts as the story progresses, with two major ideologies of mechanists (cyborgs/machine implants) versus the shapers (biologically changing people)"

I'm also kind of a geek for African culture and language.  Blue Remembered Earth might be in my top 5 SF series of all time now.  I also love how Eunice Akinya is like this main character in the series, even though she's dead.  People keep resurrecting her with simulations that get more and more sentient as the books progress and more and more like the original as they uncover more of her crazy life story.  And she's this sassy, powerful African grandma  who won't put up with anyone's BS and is always plotting something crazy.  She's definitely in my top 5 fictional characters of all time. . . But is that original Eunice or Sim Eunice or true AI Eunice and how different are they really?  That series is his opus.  So good."

READ ALL HIS BOOKS, DO IT RIGHT NOW. If you want to see one of the origins of the cyberpunk genre, start with neuromaencer. If you want to see fan-fucking-tastic prose, read the Bigend trilogy, starting with pattern recognition. If you want to see him predict the future, read literally any of his published works, he is a fucking oracle.   Also, I strongly encourage anyone to read ""Distrust That Particular Flavor"" which is a collection of his non-fiction works, articles, essays and the like. He is one of the treasures of the human race, much like Iain M. Banks.  Also, Asiimov's stuff if you want to see the roots of a lot of transhumanist literary thought.  Also, I remember ""River of Gods"" being really fantastic.

Transhuman,37ltsa,darklooshkin,6,Thu May 28 15:47:04 2015 UTC,"There is a technology called PGD (Preimplantation genetic diagnosis) where several eggs from a woman are removed and fertilized in a lab and diagnosed for genetic diseases, and you can then choose to insert the healthy embryons back in to the uterus of the mother. Right now, this technology is only used for eliminating hereditary diseases, but it could potentially be used to identify certain characterics like gender, hair colour, eye colour, perhaps even genetic predispotitions for high intelligence, artistic ability or mental health.   An even further step would be to directly manipulate the genes of the embryons to give them the characteristics parents or society might desire. This is not happening yet because of all the ethics involved, but I think it's just a matter of time before something like this becomes legal somewhere.  Brave New World is indeed a good book (actually one of my favourite books) if you want to see what the consequences of using such technology for eugenicist purposes might be."

Genetics it's Brave New World, or Gattaca; animal enhancement, first comment is Planet of the Apes; AI, first comment is Terminator; cybernetics, first comment is the Borg or the Cybermen or whatever; life extension and regeneration technology, someone mentions Elysium, and so on .  Terrible results for any technology are possible, but in reality, people usually use technology in a way that benifits themselves and mankind, and the same is almost certanly true for all of these technologies.     A ""genetic caste system"" like in Brave New World makes no sense anyway, especially not in a world where repetitive occupations are getting automated away anyway.   Most likely we would just use the technology to make ourselves and our children healthier, happier, smarter, stronger, and have better lives.  Sorry for the rant, I just get annoyed the way that dytopian thinking always drowns out the much much more likely positive transhumanist potentials of these technologies."
Transhuman,37ltsa,Yosarian2,2,Thu May 28 17:50:59 2015 UTC,"My main point its that BNW is technically a utopia, however our craving for absolute freedom says otherwise.    But the thing is, there's absolutely no reason that genetic engineering would or should in any way take away anyone's freedom.  I mean, you could have a free society with genetic engineering, or a slave society without it; the genetic engineering isn't the deciding variable there, people just think it is because they've seen too much distopian literature about it.      A more realistic scenario would be one where things are basically the same, except genetic disease is gone, the average IQ is now 110 or 120 instead of 100, and where the average lifespan is 10-20 years longer.   But I guess that's not an interesting premise for fiction."
Transhuman,37ltsa,Yosarian2,1 point,Fri May 29 01:30:29 2015 UTC,"Well, there are two aspects of it I don't think are covered by dystopian fiction-the use of such technology in terraforming and colonisation efforts and how such a tool could be used to give a non-human intelligence a human (or semi-organic platform that looks human) body and brain to learn from.  See, I want to actually see if there are practical uses for the technology that do not revolve around the benefolence or maliciousness of the society using them.   Having a 'humanity in a can' machine that can assemble itself, a crude biosphere and produce a population of people within a year of deployment on some barren rock sitting in a distant sun's Goldilocks zone would be what I would see as being one of the ultimate outcomes of such technology. Why bother hauling humans around outer space for colonisation purposes when you can just toss a cylinder at a planet and come back to a thriving population thirty years after it makes landfall?  And what about customising the blueprints to adapt more favourably to local conditions? What would the practical problems to such an approach rather than the ethical ones be? That's an issue that rarely gets more than lip service, after all-an organism adapted to thrive in one environment may find itself failing a new environment rather quickly. That's a definite drawback, considering the baseline adaptation capabilities of a human aren't that great to begin with. Making it worse would be typically seen as a bad thing, but under what circumstances could it become the best solution?  I've been thinking about it for a while. Biological reproduction systems are fascinating in and of themselves. Procedural generation, cellular replication, the sheer logistics of having a body make a new version of itself and another over a fixed time span...  Now imagine how that could be applied to machines. Semi-organic technology-that is, technology that shares or emulates biological mechanisms to a degree. Factories that can grow complex systems rather than have to assemble them. Robots that can give birth... okay, that one's a bit weird, but it would make sense.  Not to mention how it could be applied to infrastructure as a whole, actually.  Basically I think that, in a transhuman society, biological reproduction mechanisms could be a potential goldmine for both industry and society as any emergent synthetic intelligence can experience what it would be like to be a human firsthand.  However, I would still like some ideas about it. Anyone got any that does not revolve around Shakespeare fanboys being oppressed by the System, as it were?"
Transhuman,37ltsa,Yosarian2,2,Fri May 29 01:41:34 2015 UTC,"Fundimentally, I think that technology like gene selection technology will mostly be used in the short term to do things like prevent genetic diseases, to remove genes linked to breast cancer and Alzhiemer's, to add genes that we know are linked to longevity and longer lives, and eventually to select for genes known to increase IQ by a couple of points, things like that.    It's not as exciting as a lot of the science fiction interpretations, but it will significantly improve the quality of human life.  We can do most of this with just IVF, but IVF is difficult and expensive; if we could use, say, some kind of artificial womb instead, then it becomes a lot easier.  In the longer run, I think things are going to start to get interesting when we start using either genes from animals or novel genes that were never in any life form at all.   That's a lot farther off then just using human genes, since it's going to be a lot harder to know that those kinds of genes are safe and effective (we're probably going to have to have a much better theoretical understanding of what genes do then we do now), but in the long run, it might lead to a big increase in human diversity, with many different ""types"" of humans co-existing.   So long as we can create tolerance and understanding and non-discrimination of people with differences, I think that is a very good outcome for humanity; historically speaking, a diverse and cosmopolitan population where people have different points of view tends to be more creative, to come up with more creative solutions, and generally to progress faster then a population where everyone is the same.  I do also agree with you that this kind of thing would make colonization of space a lot more practical.  The idea of sending just frozen sperm and egg to another star, and then ""growing"" humans about 25 years before you get there, is a very interesting one, and one possible way to do colonization of other stars.  It's probably a lot easier then either suspended animation or a generation ship."

Middle class people will tend to buy the health and attractiveness mods for their kids before the intelligence ones.  They are less expensive and still help the kids out socially and economically.  The people with enhanced intelligence mods essentially end up running things.  But they are jealous of each other people with even better/newer/more expensive mods.

Transhuman,37k1zf,Mindkiller89,29,Thu May 28 04:53:55 2015 UTC,"1)   If I was to use a computer to transfer the data of my brain from my body to a computer, how do you know if it's actually me in that computer or merely an identical copy that behaves exactly like me?    If its an 'identical' copy of you, it is, for all pursuits and purposes, you. That is to say, the particles (subatomic particles) that compose 'you' do not possess any particular, intrinsic quantity of 'you-ness.' These particles have no personal identity. If you can make an identical (to the sub-atomic level) copy of 'you' then there is no possible process we could use to differentiate between the two.  The same is true for a simulation of you. If we truly are simulating your brain exactly, that is we're simulating it down to the sub-atomic level... once again there is no way to tell them apart.   More reading:  http://lesswrong.com/lw/pm/identity_isnt_in_specific_atoms/  http://lesswrong.com/lw/po/three_dialogues_on_identity/  http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Personal_identity  http://lesswrong.com/lw/r9/quantum_mechanics_and_personal_identity/  http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Whole_brain_emulation  2)   If I was to replace my brain and memories with a computer and data, then what's stopping some skilled computer hacker from exposing my deepest and darkest thoughts to the world?   Just to make the point: you are on the internet now. You probably have a profile about you that has been built from your amazon purchases, your youtube views, your google searches, and on and on. Anyone who can access this profile can get at most of your deepest darkest secrets, unless you've diligently avoided placing them on the internet.  So to the extent that you ALREADY store your memories and data on computers, what is really all that different?  Your brain is just a computer that has no electromagnetic connections to anything else. If you're worried about hackers, then just don't join the network. Otherwise, you have only your own security measures to take.  And then:   What does that say about privacy and free will?    Why should we care what it says? You are asking the wrong question. Whatever it says is true, and what is true is all there is.   http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Free_will  3)  What happens to you now if you get in an accident that causes brain damage, or get Alzheimers or dementia? Or you just die from one of a million little things that can kill you?  This is a question of whether you think, probabilistically speaking, that your memories and 'self' have a better chance of surviving on electronic hardware or the current biological hardware you are limited to.  4)   If you were to take all those nerve endings away and replace them with comparatively-fewer and comparatively-less sensitive touch sensors (which for all we know may only notify that they are being touched rather than actually provide a sense of touch), how utterly numb and empty is that human being going to feel? And again, how is that going to affect their mental state?    What about the other option? What if you hook them up to even more sensory inputs from a broader spectrum of sensations?   We know how humans do in isolation, but there's no reason to think that cyber-izing the human mind will lead to less sensory experience  5)   How is this any different from eugenics and making a Master Race?    Presumably because we won't be forcing others to undergo the changes nor will we be killing people en-masse in the process. You need to re-examine why you think eugenics is bad. And then see if these objections still apply in a scenario where people are voluntarily self-upgrading.  To me, its like asking ""why should we cure genetic disorders or fix birth defects? Isn't this just eugenics?"" What says we must NOT improve our circumstances, and if its okay to cure the disabled, why is it NOT okay to give oneself more ability?  6)  Cloning, for one. This really ceases to be a problem if we assume technology that allows artificial gestation. Then all you need are frozen sperm and eggs, which we are already capable of handling.  Homo sapiens are already on the road to extinction. It could happen tomorrow from Nuclear war, a decade from now with an asteroid strike, or millions of years in the future from the expansion of the sun.  The ONLY way to avoid this is to improve ourselves so we can survive or escape these events. What say you to this?  7)   would spending your entire life in a world you know is artificial be anywhere near as fulfilling as living life in the real world with real experiences?   lol, how do you know this is the real world?. There is a sincere possibility that you are in fact living in a simulation. You would have no way to tell.  Again this gets to the point that perfect simulations of something are indistinguishable from that thing. It would be exactly as fulfilling as it was simulated to be. The Matrix as a fiction was made to be not fulfilling. In 'real life' a simulation that satisfied you would be satisfying.  8)   As long as our brains remain hard to reprogram, there are still going to be humans who think differently than others and have different opinions from the common denominator. And there are some people who would fight ruthlessly against what they don't agree with, especially when the thing they are fighting against is threatening their free will.    See the point about free will above.  If they don't upgrade themselves, they will probably end up being convinced by those of greater intelligence. I'm leaving aside the AI singularity because if that happens then ALL of this is moot.   If you can imagine a set of facts, circumstances, or arguments that might convince you to change your mind, then a person who is significantly more intelligent than you can also come up with such arguments and deploy them against you.  This is to say, unless you can sincerely commit to NEVER giving in to transhumanism... its very likely they will find a way to convince you.  9)   We may inevitably one day become merged with our technology, and artificial intelligence may indeed become indistinguishable from actual human intelligence. But I see that happening tens of thousands of years in the future, not by 2045.   Look. We can be all but certain it will happen. If we reach the point where we can simulate an entire human brain in real time... then its over. All it takes at that point is to speed up the simulation, and you've got a 'superhuman' AI. Simulate the brain of the smartest human on earth at 1.5 speed, have this brain handle the task of improving its own simulation.  Given the rate at which computation processing power improves, you really want to bet that it will be tens of thousands of years? And not, say, a hundred or so?   If humanity was to legitimately follow through with the transhumanists' excuse of a goal, that would really make me feel very ashamed to be a member of such a pitifully gullible species.    Ironically, if you were ashamed to be a member of such a pitifully gullible species... transhumanism offers you a way to no longer be a member of it.   Likewise, it offers a way for the species to become less pitifully gullible.   You're pretty much trapped. As long as there are people 'gullible' enough to seek transhumanism, you have no way of making them less gullible without transhumanism. How would you resolve this problem?  If humans do not choose to actively improve themselves with the technology they have at hand, what future do they have, exactly? What will they expect to achieve? And how will they compete with those who do successfully self-improve?  If life is good, how is more life bad? If its right to prevent death, how is it wrong to completely eliminate it? The argument isn't quite so simple, but if you want to oppose transhumanism you DO need to address these questions.  See if you find these convincing:  http://www.yudkowsky.net/singularity/simplified  http://humanityplus.org/philosophy/transhumanist-faq/"

To everyone else, yeah, it would basically be you. But your brain is a bunch of cells and electrical impulses. If you copy those impulses to a computer, or even the physical brain, you haven't actually moved your mind (what you experience right now, from your view) somewhere else. It's just a copy + paste.  That's assuming a process of scan old brain -> reconstruct new copy, or those impulses in a computer -> destroy the old one. Sorry if I misread, but that's what I gathered ."

It would feel as ''you felt, and it would not be saying ""I am a copy."" It would be saying ""I am me.""   There's no way to say that one is more 'you' than the other, unless you choose a more particularly narrow definition of 'you' that is limited to a given spatial perspective. And on that definition, we might not be able to say that the 'you' who falls asleep at night is the same 'you' that wakes up.  On that note... are you?

I think my question is: why does the universe care about your 'first person perspective?' What makes it 'special' (note: I'm not asking what makes it unique, per se) such that it cannot be replicated as if it were never gone?  If you walked through a door into a room that recorded the exact state of your body, then disintegrated you, and then reformed the atoms that composed you into an exact copy of what you were before, then you walked out the door to that room... what is qualitatively different?  Nobody who saw you go into that room and then come out would notice a difference, they'd have no way to detect a difference. YOU wouldn't know the difference, since you would only remember walking into the room then walking out...  So if, as far as the universe is concerned, nothing happened... what happened?   And why should this be so fundamentally different from a situation where you walk through a door that records the exact state of your body, then disintegrated you, then immediately ran a simulation of you as an exact copy of what you were before, then simulated you walking out the door to that room?

You have zero overlap with the fundamental constituents of yourself from even one nanosecond ago.  There is continuity of information, but not equality of parts.  The new factor over the subspace looks a whole lot like the old you, and not by coincidence:  The flow of time is lawful, there are causes and effects and preserved commonalities.  Look to the regularity of physics, if you seek a source of continuity.  Do not ask to be composed of the same objects, for this is hopeless.  Whatever makes you feel that your present is connected to your past, it has nothing to do with an identity of physically fundamental constituents over time.   http://lesswrong.com/lw/pm/identity_isnt_in_specific_atoms/"

I'm all for cyberization of humanity. I look forward to the day of being more than human. However, I don't see a value of creating a mental copy in a computer if the original you is destroyed. I see a more proper path in slowly replacing the brain with more machine components. Basically replacing a cell at a time, letting the brain adapt and continuity to remain. Every cell in my body is new, compared to my 1985 newborn self. Yet there's continuity. This is where we must look, I feel. Slowly replace parts and bits of ourselves until fully mechanized. The continuity of consciousness must be maintained, or we might as well make robots that think they're human and then kill ourselves off."

Imagine you walk into a room that automagically duplicates you, and then you both walk out. You both believe you're the one that walked in, and there's nothing that could distinguish which is correct.  Now, imagine you walk into a room, get scanned, and, in an adjacent room, a completely new body is built into which your mind is copied. In this case, it's clear which is the ""copy"", but that doesn't change the experience of the other: their memory of events is that they walked into a room, were teleported into another room, and then walked out to find that the teleportation process had left a duplicate behind. They might ""know"" that isn't how it worked, but their experience would disagree.  My question is, why does it matter?"

They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""things that are associated with mind body interaction"" you're referring to the philosophical grouping of mind body and spirituality, which includes things from chakra to brain injuries to madness.  So your reasoning for calling a soul a mind is because random people ""call the idea of a mind in it's original body a soul?"" Let's get karma and mind development in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a human or an robot? It's not one or the other, that's not how minds work. They can be both. A mind is a mind and no matter where it is or what shape it's in.

The paradox is most notably recorded by Plutarch in Life of Theseus from the late first century. Plutarch asked whether a ship which was restored by replacing each and every one of its wooden parts remained the same ship.  The paradox had been discussed by more ancient philosophers such as Heraclitus, Socrates, and Plato prior to Plutarch's writings; and more recently by Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. Several variants are known, notably ""grandfather's axe"". This thought experiment is ""a model for the philosophers""; some say, ""it remained the same,"" some saying, ""it did not remain the same"".

And in my humble opinion, the fact that replacing the materials of the original body doesn't necessarily mean that the original body is no longer the original body. You can remember when you were a kid, right?   But in the case of transhumanism, if I was to invest however many millions of dollars towards transferring all my memories into a robot body with a computer brain, in which case I was deliberately replacing all the materials in my body at once into something new rather than gradually sweating away the worn out atoms in my original body, I'd want to wake up from the procedure as that robot with my dead human body next to me. If I was to wake up and find myself still within my human body with a robot duplicate of myself next to me, I'd feel ripped off. It would probably be easier and cheaper to just clone myself. If I was merely copying my memories into a robot rather than transferring myself into it, then the whole procedure would be pointless because I would still die anyway and I'd be something-million dollars short."

At no point in time do two distinct 'you's ever exist.   If I was to wake up and find myself still within my human body with a robot duplicate of myself next to me, I'd feel ripped off.   The whole point of the Ship of Theseus argument is that there is never any possibility of this occurring. There is not a second ship built onto which the sailors cross over - the ship is gradually replaced, component by component. At no point do two ships ever exist."
Transhuman,37k1zf,IConrad,-2,Thu May 28 07:46:21 2015 UTC,"I still stand by my point, though, because in the case of transhumanism and transferring your mind into a robot body, there would be two ships. And I would still feel ripped off if there was no actual transcendence going on."
Transhuman,37k1zf,RunasSudo,4,Thu May 28 08:01:34 2015 UTC,"You realize that's only one way if going about it, right?  Take for example the concept of the exocortex -- where you extend your meat self/mind onto digital substrates.  Make copies of all of your memories so there's a high fidelity backup that can be recalled instantly.  Give yourself computer-like mathematical abilities.  Reckon times by the millisecond with ease.  Google search by thinking about the topic and suddenly remembering the search results.    As you extend yourself, more and more of the real you would never have been meat at all.  And the rest would be copyable as a backup just in case something did happen to your meat.  As to ways to prevent anyone not-you from gaining access to your memories... This is a systems administration problem.  I happen to be a systems administrator. The answer to this question is cryptographic keys, opensourcing basecode for binaries and firmware, and opsec on the part of the users.  Stop using ""Password123!"" as your damned password!  As to factory components for robopeople ... We already customize our cars.  In the meantime, rapid prototyping is becoming more and more of a thing:  mass production techniques are beginning available to completely unique products.  Why would we not assume this would remain true for such future bodies?  And this ignores the idea of construction with off-the-shelf components that are self-reconfiguring (so-called ""smart"" materials).  Lastly, I want to say this.

Consider that you are not the same person as you were 20 years ago, not at all. A large amount of the molecules comprising your body are different, your memories, ideas and beliefs are different.

Transhuman,37k1zf,Alvarvanrijn,7,Sun Jun 28 07:54:22 2015 UTC,"Along with what other people have pointed out, let me just say transhumanism is a lot more then just uploading your mind to a computer.  You might not want to do that, and still be a transhumanist; transhumanism also includes things like genetic enhancement, anti-aging medicine, cybernetics, brain enhancement, biotechnology, nanotechnology, and so on.      Not all transhumanists want to ""upload their brain"", and that's fine; one of the fundamental principles of transhumanism is complete morphological freedom, the idea that everyone has the right to decide for themselves how to change or upgrade their own body, or to not do it if they choose.    If you're in favor of using technology to fundamentally improve the human condition, if you think it's a good idea to use technology to improve ourselves, to become smarter, to live longer, for us to have better and even happier lives, then you're a transhumanist, even if you personally don't want to use that one specific technology.  In fact, IMHO, the whole ""brain uploading"" idea is going to be a lot harder then many other types of transhumanism, and is likely not a question we're going to have to deal with for quite a while; I think a lot of other transhumanist technologies are going to radically change our lives long before that becomes an issue, and personally that's the kind of stuff I'm more interested in.    One minor point, though:   Transhumanist movement is because the idea of replacing everything that makes us human with machinery and computer data...   Your brain, and the information in your brain that makes you you, is already ""computer data"", in exactally the same sense that an ""uploaded mind"" would be.  After all, your brain is really just a complicated network of electric circuits, nothing more.   There's nothing special about brains that makes them different from any other computer; it only feels like that now because our current computer hardware and software is relatively primitive, but if we were able to simulate a human mind inside a computer, that would no longer be the case.    Again, though, I don't think that's the kind of issue we need to obsess about right now; a lot of other transhumanist technologies are going to come of age first."

Transhuman,37k1zf,Fordiman,2,Sun Jun 28 15:34:13 2015 UTC,"There is a lot to unpack here, so rather than try to take it point-by-point, I will address the overall comment.  I think that the 2045 thing is a mix of prognostication of the state of technology in the year 2045, and a Utopian vision of what that state of technology will mean to humanity by 2045.  For that reason, to me, the 2045 thing is more correctly seen as an inflection point.  These technologies will become more and more prevalent, as will the types of drawbacks which you bring up.  It will doubtless be chaotic in some regards, and certainly, the entire promise of living much longer (I don't like the ""forever"" moniker - a trillion years is a long time) will not be universally available by 2045, nor will humans be universally willing to avail themselves of the technology by then.  Here is the way I see it.  They say that the first person to live to be 500 years old has already been born.  That's cool.  However, I have no illusion that that person will be me.  In the process of achieving such longevity, there will doubtless be many promising leads that dry up, many false starts, many abject failures.  Is the sustaining of this body the right approach through genetically targeted therapies, or is mind uploading better?  A lot of people will guess wrongly before that question, and many others, are conclusively answered.  That person born today who lives to be 500 will not be indicative of the experience of the vast majority of us living today, but instead will be that one lucky trailblazer who happened to make all the right choices along the way.  And that is just the technical aspect.  I think that you bring up the much more salient question about who we are today, with all our petty bitterness and strife.  Will humanity have any kind of tools to transcend our humanity?  Will a rich, early adopter suddenly become more disposed to part with his/her wealth in order to bring about a better society?  Will any of the technology provide us with more or better spiritual understanding?  Will we become more, or less compassionate? I believe that these questions will take a lot longer to answer (I hope not 10,000 years) before any kind of Utopian Transhumanism arrives.  Finally, I see no discussion of the politics.  Boy, you think the fuddy-duddy Republicans are a pain in the ass with their ""no abortion,"" ""no gay marriage,"" and whatever.  Just wait until these Transhumanism questions come up.  I keep hearing the political left saying ""just wait a generation and all the old people will die and we will get our progressivism on track.""  I think that will be true of things like abortion and LGBT rights, but I do not believe that the youth of today are necessarily being brought up prepared for trans-species rights, robot rights, cyborg rights, and the like. In short, the faster changes occur, the MORE likely people will fill in the ranks to resist the changes.  All of this is not to say that I am sanguine about the future.  If the history of humanity has taught us anything, it is that, in spite of ourselves, we manage to continue on a fairly constant track of progress toward something.  So I agree that there will be tons of issues to solve, but I have something akin to faith that some branch of our offspring will get it right."
Transhuman,37k1zf,nhitze,2,Thu May 28 06:39:29 2015 UTC,"Personally, I suspect that digital immortality won't be a transfer, but a gradual augmentation.

Transhuman,37k1zf,OCKoopa,2,Fri May 29 02:08:21 2015 UTC,"Point 1 tends to lead to fruitless philosophical debates, so I won't argue against it here although I personally disagree. As others have said, not all transhumanism is about mind uploading, and you can still be a transhumanist even if you believe mind uploading is philosophically impossible.   What does that say about privacy and free will?   Compatibilism basically says that free will is when no external force controls your action, if I'm understanding it correctly. Someone hacking your brain and making you do things is robbing you of free will. Being simulated by a computer is not robbing you of free will. In an ideal world, brain hackers would face serious legal penalties and would be prevented from doing it again. (Unfortunately, it isn't that easy to deal with hackers in real life.)   \3. If I was to replace my brain and memories with a computer and data, then what the hell will happen to me if I end up with a computer virus, some data gets corrupted, or the unit storing my memories somehow gets damaged? How will this affect my mental state?   Presumably, with enough backups and sanity checks. Viruses might be a problem, but can be solved by not giving viruses access to your mental data. (For example, have the brain emulator and the traditional CPU separate, and instead the CPU can supply data to the brain emulator, and the brain emulator sends data back to the CPU, and the CPU cannot modify brain data in any way.)   \4. A completely organic human being, unless they are suffering from nerve damage, can feel every square inch of their body whether they realize it or not.   By the time whole brain emulation is economically feasible, computers will be easily able to simulate the entire sense of touch. (Disclaimer: I'm not a ""Singularity 2045!"" guy. I'd like to be uploaded but I am doubtful about it happening that soon; if anything, I'll probably end up getting my brain preserved when I die because that seems to be the only feasible way around death at this point in time.)   \5. Even if the altered human race was to have the right to free will and customizable bodies, it would be economically reasonable for our robot bodies to be built off the same basic construction plans. How is this any different from eugenics and making a Master Race?   When most people think of ""eugenics"", what comes to mind is telling people not to breed, sterilizing people against their will, and occasionally straight-up murdering people that have undesirable traits. Eugenics is often based on pseudoscientific ideas such as the idea that stupidity is hereditary (which is contradicted by the Flynn effect), or Lamarckism (for example, Nazis believed that people deafened due to injuries would give birth to deaf children). Basically, every negative and positive trait is said to be genetic in nature, regardless of the truth of the claim. Furthermore, the idea of a ""Master Race"" excludes people who weren't born into the ""master race"", which is unfair by nature because no child chooses who they will be born to. Forced eugenics bar certain people from reproduction, giving them no choice in the matter.  On the other hand, transhumanism (ideally) allows everyone to participate. Maybe someone has a verified genetic disease. Genetic diseases can be screened out, thanks to modern medical science. There was an article on /r/Futurology a while ago about a baby born with none of a list of 200 common genetic disorders thanks to screening. Once doctors have the ability to manipulate what genes a child will have, the technology will benefit everyone as long as universal health care exists and covers genetic manipulation.   \6. If every human being alive had a robot body and a computer mind, then how are we supposed to reproduce?   By creating artificial sentient entities that operate similar to the human mind. ""Virtual"" children, if you will. (Although according to functionalism a simulation of a sentient entity is a real sentient entity.)   Even if we were supposedly immortal and allowed to have all the virtual sex we could ask for, there will come a point in the far future that enough humans mentally died from irreversible accidents of some kind that we would be an endangered species, and we would need to reproduce for the sake of survival.   By creating enough backups, computerized people will be literally immortal. If nobody bothers reviving the backup, then the number of persons alive will decrease if some kind of accident, but it would be trivial to be revived as long as your data is backed up.   And even if we were to have robot bodies that reproduce via nanotechnology with virtual human-like minds, there will come a point when the formerly-organic humans with human minds go extinct and become replaced by the robots with the artificial minds. Even if those artificial robot minds were indistinguishable from a human's, would that mean that we weren't extinct? Does the fact that there are photographs of living thylacines negate the fact that thylacines are extinct?   Humans will go extinct, eventually, thanks to the first and second laws of thermodynamics. However, if they go extinct due to everyone getting their brains uploaded, then that means humans aren't a dead-end species. Homo erectus went extinct a long time ago, but their descendents live on. The difference is that uploaded humans will be passing on their minds, not their genes. And genes are not sentient; while Homo erectus is dead, people will still live if everyone is uploaded and no biological humans remain.   \7. With Matrix-like virtual reality, even if every individual human being was allowed to have their own customized ultra-paradise and exciting adventures, would spending your entire life in a world you know is artificial be anywhere near as fulfilling as living life in the real world with real experiences?   If a Matrix-like VR isn't fulfilling enough, then it isn't stimulating enough of your senses or is doing a piss-poor job. A true immersive VR would allow you to not just see and hear, but to feel, taste, and smell, as well as feeling the wind blow through your hair and subtle stuff like that.   Not to mention, knowing how the Internet is, would you really want to live in a world shaped by the same trolls that shaped the Internet?   That is a good point. VR communities would need to self-police themselves, and do a far better job at it than a lot of ""self-policed"" internet communities do. Some things done in VR, in an ideal world, would result in criminal charges in real life. For example, torturing someone's avatar would be very bad, and saying ""but it's not real"" is bullshit when talking about fully immersive VR because the suffering would be very real.   8… there would still be MILLIONS, possibly BILLIONS of people who would downright refuse to go along with the transhumanism movement because they have found reasons similar to mine.   Transhumanism shouldn't be forcing anything on anyone. If that is your point, I agree.   \9. We may inevitably one day become merged with our technology, and artificial intelligence may indeed become indistinguishable from actual human intelligence. But I see that happening tens of thousands of years in the future, not by 2045.   I agree, but disagree. I agree that 2045 is extremely optimistic and a bit unrealistic, but I don't see it taking thousands of years to figure out how to efficiently simulate a human brain. A clear and concise theory of intelligence could make an SAI even more energy efficient than a simulation of a brain, and an SAI with an accurate enough personality, senses, and memories should be equivalent to mind uploading. (Unfortunately, this possibility does not help people who think gradual transfers are necessary for the ""stream of consciousness"" to not be broken.)"
Transhuman,37k1zf,RCHO,1 point,Thu May 28 17:43:50 2015 UTC,"As others have said, it would behave exactly like you and there would be no way to tell you and the artificial brain apart. However, you would not be able to experience immortality. Your exact copy would though. As an answer to this, from what I've read we will eventually be able to eliminate disease and aging, as well as genetic modification of our human forms, so that we can retain a biological form, we'll just be immortal with enhanced capabilities, as well as some artificial and/or mechanized parts. And even if it was just a copy of yourself, as a mere human you will end up dying anyways; at least this way you can still have an influence beyond your life, and in a much better way than reproduction. I'm not concerned with this. Ideally we would be able to separate from the internet whenever we want to, and access it whenever we want to just like now. The same thing happens to our biological forms. With an altered and enhanced form, we are just minimizing our risks for death and disease. Again, this could be avoided by modification of the biological form and gradual evolution. Even if your scenario came to pass, it's still a preferable scenario to death. We have to recognize that certain features are more desirable than others. Is it really that evil a thing to want everyone to be able to for example avoid obesity? We're not creating a master race, we're creating the next evolution of the species. There will be no mandatory changes, and people will still be able to choose their features. There will be no restricted reproduction or genocide either. If it got to that point we would have biological forms that are just immortal. Fertilize real human eggs with real human sperm and put them into an artificial womb so women don't have to go through pregnancy/birth. You would be able to isolate yourself in a virtual world away from the trolls. And yes, that world would be all the more fulfilling and moreso than the ""real"" world. They don't have to be evolved/changed/replaced. They should have no reason for stopping me from doing so for my own enrichment though. There will be people (cough politicians cough) who try to take advantage of or limit the capabilities of transhumanism. That's why the movement needs our attention and our passion to make sure that no one is forced into doing something they don't want to and that the proposed evolution is available for everyone.   As for your conclusion, again, all of humanity doesn't have to become transhuman if they don't want to. I can tell you my goal. My goal is to be a biological/nanotech hybrid, able to incorporate molecules around me into my form so that I can create whatever I might need, fueled by nuclear fusion. I will spend my time in my own simulated virtual worlds as well as traveling the universe and learning its secrets. That sure seems like a wonderful and beautiful vision/goal to me. I know that isn't what everyone is going to want and they don't have to do that, or anything like that. That's the beauty of transhumanism; it will allow more people to be happy and live as they want."
Transhuman,37k1zf,RunasSudo,1 point,Sat May 30 10:55:37 2015 UTC,"how do you know if it's actually me in that computer or merely an identical copy that behaves exactly like me?    This is a philosophical point, I suppose, but an identical copy that behaves exactly like you is you.   If I was to replace my brain and memories with a computer and data, then what's stopping some skilled computer hacker from exposing my deepest and darkest thoughts to the world? Or worse, what's stopping those same hackers from convincing me that I live in a completely made-up reality, or even completely reprogramming me or anyone else they hack into into totally different people? What does that say about privacy and free will?    If we have the ability to perform a complete, functional transplant of a human mind into a machine, then it seems likely any such hackers would be able to work just as well on a biobrain. A prerequisite of such technology is an operational compatibility between human brains and computers.   If I was to replace my brain and memories with a computer and data, then what the hell will happen to me if I end up with a computer virus, some data gets corrupted, or the unit storing my memories somehow gets damaged? How will this affect my mental state?    Neurodegenerative diseases are a thing, so you already have this risk.   A completely organic human being, unless they are suffering from nerve damage, can feel every square inch of their body whether they realize it or not. If you were to take all those nerve endings away and replace them with comparatively-fewer and comparatively-less sensitive touch sensors (which for all we know may only notify that they are being touched rather than actually provide a sense of touch), how utterly numb and empty is that human being going to feel? And again, how is that going to affect their mental state?   Or we could increase the density and sensitivity of the sensors. Or we could implement entirely new senses. Or we could use intermediate forms of this technology as a form of therapy for people with sensory disorders.   If every human being alive had a robot body and a computer mind, then how are we supposed to reproduce?   Build a new body with a new mind? Create artifical embryos from stored DNA, allow organic development, and then transfer the mind out at birth or at some other age (opt in?)   Even if we were supposedly immortal and allowed to have all the virtual sex we could ask for, there will come a point in the far future that enough humans mentally died from irreversible accidents of some kind that we would be an endangered species, and we would need to reproduce for the sake of survival.   It's rather easy to duplicate software.   But how would this be possible if there are no more organic human brains with fresh new minds to harvest? And even if we were to have robot bodies that reproduce via nanotechnology with virtual human-like minds, there will come a point when the formerly-organic humans with human minds go extinct and become replaced by the robots with the artificial minds.   Kind of like what happened to all of those precursor species that came before us?   Even if those artificial robot minds were indistinguishable from a human's, would that mean that we weren't extinct?   Sure; Homo Sapiens goes extinct. This is going to happen regardless; the only question is how our evolution progresses.   With Matrix-like virtual reality, even if every individual human being was allowed to have their own customized ultra-paradise and exciting adventures, would spending your entire life in a world you know is artificial be anywhere near as fulfilling as living life in the real world with real experiences?   Maybe. Let's find out.   If you factor out the people who volunteer to have their body replaced for personal reasons, the people who are suckered into it by clever marketing, the religious fanatics who decide to volunteer for religious reasons, the rich and famous people who want to be better than ever, the soldiers who want to be super soldiers, the athletes who want to be super athletes, and even the poor people who are somehow forced into having their bodies replaced by the elite, there would still be MILLIONS, possibly BILLIONS of people who would downright refuse to go along with the transhumanism movement because they have found reasons similar to mine.   Sure; how is this an argument?   Overall, the reason I disagree with Transhumanism and the 2045 Transhumanist movement is because the idea of replacing everything that makes us human with machinery and computer data is like having all of humanity submitting to slavery and commiting suicide at the same time, all while pretending to be at Disney World. If humanity was to legitimately follow through with the transhumanists' excuse of a goal, that would really make me feel very ashamed to be a member of such a pitifully gullible species.    TL;DR: I think humans are intrinsically special and don't want to lose the specialness."

This could potentially lead to many new ways to cure diseases like Alzheimers and Parkinsons. However, I don't think you are recognizing the potential risks here. If people could reprogram a brain like a computer, there will be people who would take so much advantage of that, and not in any way that benefits the one being reprogrammed. Imagine me being able to program your brain so that you would become a murderous pedophile who eats feces. I don't know what the reason for it would be, but it would be possible. And you wouldn't like that one bit, would you?   -Okay, I'll give you that. There are risks for everything. But I would argue that being reduced to the state of a vegetable just because some water got onto the hard drive would suck much more than having a neurodegenerative disease that could be cured by such technology.  -I love your idea of using sensors as therapy for patients with sensory disorders. That is a much better idea than turning said patients into Doctor Who Cybermen.   -If we build a new body with a new mind, wouldn't that simply be building a robot? And if you were to grow an organic human and have their brains transfered into a robot later, then what do you do if that human doesn't want to become a machine? Just force them to do it against their will?   -Assuming that the humans in this scenario are indeed nothing but software, then yeah, I'll agree with you there.   -But isn't the whole point of transhumanism to be immortal, reach a peak and cease to evolve?   -Indeed, Homo Sapiens will indeed go extinct one day, one way or another. This is a natural process of life, even if that process includes artificial augmentation. I'm not some geezer who fears technology and progress. I can totally imagine humanity and technology merging into one. But I imagine it tens of thousands of years from now, as humanity learns to get along at its own pace and use that technology to benefit ourselves and each other in tangent with nature...again, at our own pace. At the rate we are going politically and culturally, thirty years, a hundred years, maybe even a thousand years won't be enough time for us to reach that level of sophistication on our own. And until we reach that point, forcing everybody to become robots goes from pushing us up the evolutionary ladder to creating a Master Race Nazi-style. Also, I feel that we should use our technology to assist us at reaching our full potential rather than using that same technology to give up and pretend we reached that potential, which is exactly what current transhumanism is trying to do. Hell, I argue that social networks and half the internet is a feeble attempt at replacing life rather than enhancing it.   -What would you find more satisfying: a video game taking place in Hawai'i or an actual trip to Hawai'i? (Or whatever part of the world you would love to visit one day).   -So, if I was to refuse to transfer my brain into a computer, you just expect me to give up and do it whether I like it or not?   -Like I said, I'm not afraid of the idea of humans becoming one with their technology. What I am afraid of is people being forced to give up everything that makes us who we are and become a bunch of clunky machines living a fake existence. There's nothing special about humans that prevents us from ""transcending"" to such a stage...that is, if you don't give two shits about free will and cultural identity. Part of what makes us human is the fact that we had to live in our imperfect bodies, and that life within those imperfect bodies shaped us into who we are. What the transhumanists are trying to do is replace that part of us, when really what they should be doing is finding ways to improve the bodies we already have. Cure all the diseases and deformities. Create implants that allow machines to have a sort of symbiotic relation with us, moving with our thoughts and making manual labor easier. Give everyone a IQ of 300. Your idea of using sensors for those with sensory disorders. All of these, plus so much more, that are both easier and more ethical than trying to recreate the conditions of a bad 90's science fiction film."

So, if I was to refuse to transfer my brain into a computer, you just expect me to give up and do it whether I like it or not?   As /u/RCHO mentioned:   (opt in?)   Transhumanism and personal liberty are not exclusive. (Indeed, in my opinion, one is a logical conclusion of the other.) The transhumanism I understand does not involve, in any way, forcing anyone to act contrary to their beliefs or opinions. Transhumanism and Cybermen from the Doctor Who universe are completely unrelated, barring a passing resemblance in subject matter."
Transhuman,37k1zf,JustJonny,1 point,Thu May 28 07:16:02 2015 UTC,"-Well, even if transcending into a robot body was a choice rather than a requirement, doing so in our current cultural state of mind would be opening a whole new can of worms. Surely the people who do make the choice to transfer into a robot body would be the wealthy elite, who would then use the media to pressure everyone else into becoming robots because ""Having a robot body is so much better than having a smelly and gross human body, and if you don't transcend you should feel bad!"" There goes all the people suckered by the status quo. Then when you have the people who resist getting robot bodies, they would be seen as terrorists and they would be beat down by the military police forces that probably had to become robots. Then you would have the people who change into robots out of fear of the elite seeing them as more protesting terrorists. Not much of a choice there.   -But like I said, it would be easier and more ethical to just find ways to enhance what we already have. Even if we fought to overcome our limitations, our limitations gave us the motivation to try and overcome them to begin with. Running in gung ho to get a new robot body would add even more limitations than just gradually improving what we already have."

Most of the suffering in the world today isn't caused by free will, it's caused by things like aging, Alzheimer's, cancer, natural disasters, and so on.  Things that humans didn't do and don't have any control over.  There are counterarguments to this, such as ""suffering breed character"" or ""you have to have some bad in the world to understand the good"", but they don't really stand up either.  I mean, why create a world with Alzheimer's if you could just as easily create one without?   Does that really make the human experience ""more meaningful"" to slowly lose your memories and eventually yourself in old age?  Whatever plausible goal you might think that God might have had when he created the world, the world is simply not close to optimal for that goal.   Which makes perfect sense if you assume that everything was created basically randomly by natural processes and then slowly evolved from there, but doesn't make any sense if you assume there's an all-powerful all-good God who either designed and created the universe, or who occasionally intervenes in the world with ""miracles"", or both.

Other then that, though, I would say that humans might just barely intelligent enough to be classified as a ""general intelligence"".   We are at a point where we can develop technology and over time improve tools and improve our knowledge of the universe, and we eventually were able to invent computers, and might be able to eventually either upgrade ourselves, build a true AI smarter then ourselves, or both.   But a species just a little less intelligent then us probably wouldn't have been able to do that.    Human intelligence is like a nuclear pile that just barely has enough uranium to start a chain reaction, just barely enough of an edge to start a recursive chain of self-improving events; if we were a little less intelligent then we are (like some of the earlier ancestors of homo sapiens were) we might never have been able to move past stone tools and fire."

For most biological structures, free radical damage is closely associated with oxidative damage. Antioxidants are reducing agents, and limit oxidative damage to biological structures by passivating them from free radicals.

Improving the organic brain 5% (say, with genetic engineering, or brain stimulation, or whatever) would be an important multiplier that would make the whole system more powerful.  So would improving the computer, of course, but if the organic brain is still doing certain things better then the computer brain, then improving the organic brain is always going to be helpful.  Now, if we get to the point where the (organic brain) part becomes basically unimportant, then that changes things.

An exocortex is not a chip you put in your head. It's an interface of hardware and wetware in such a nature that allows the individual to -- as a synthesis of biology and circuitry -- perform on whatever substrate whatever tasks that substrate is better suited to.

So long as the organic substrate is better suited to certain tasks, or to certain parts of tasks, you will be able to improve the performance of your brain at those tasks by improving the organic parts of your brain.    So the biological enhancements (genetic engineering, brain simulation, neutropic drugs, stem cells to replace neurons as they fail, or whatever else proves to be safe and effective) would still be useful and important.

While I won't hold it as impossible for sentience to emerge, I do think we need to be careful in how we design them. A truly sentient AI has disastrous implications for humanity if we don't properly safeguard it. If it comes down to limiting (even enslaving, if that's the term you prefer) the  freedom of our creation, or allowing a possibility that it controls humanity, you have to limit it.

I agree that if you're going to use AI as a tool you just don't make it truly sentient in the first place, not in the way that we are, so that it isn't at all unhappy with being used as a tool.  Making something that is unhappy about it and enslaving it anyway would be pretty dumb and awfully indefensible, I think.  As far as the whole existential threat thing though, I think it's wildly overplayed.

If we weren't born with those traits, civilization would probably be impossible.  Is that ""mind control""?    Basically, if we're designing an AI, then we have to made decisions about what they do or don't value.  You can't just say ""Free will""; free will in terms of humans (or really any other intelligent life form) is really about making decisions in or to achieve our values and goals.  We don't really pick our values or goals, we're either born with them or we take them in with our culture.  We do have the ability to decide which human values and goals are most important to us personally, but we don't just invent them out of whole cloth.   It's probably not possible to do so; or if it was possible for value/goals to be somehow randomly generated, then most likely those goals would make it impossible for us to co-exist with the AI's in any kind of co-operative civilization without killing each other."

Transhuman,35y2r9,BlitzNeko,2,Fri May 15 00:16:40 2015 UTC,"Not impossible, but it would get a lot harder.  Since we don't have any way to articulate in our nose, there go all the consonants and vowels.   Language as we know it wouldn't work- you'd basically be saying ""nnnnnnNNNnnnNnnNnnNnnnnnn...."" We rely on phonemes (letter sounds) to give words meaning, not just tone or rhythm/duration.  People without perfect pitch would be functionally deaf to language, and people who can't carry a tune would be basically mute.  I would think sign language + intonation would probably be the outcome of a separated larynx and esophagus.  Intonation would probably carry the emotion channel, possibly some minor distinctions in content (e.g. a mid tone with the sign for ""house"" might be neutral, but a high tone might be ""home""), and gesture would carry most of the content."

Unless you first convince people that aging is something that's at least in theory solvable, most people will just become fatalistic about it.     Convincing people that it's actually something that could be done is the hard part."

Transhuman,35j8do,boytjie,3,Fri May 15 14:53:36 2015 UTC,and who believe that it's a problem that it's possible to solve.   That was the key part of my sentance.  Most baby boomers do not currently believe that.  Most people do not currently believe that.  That's why research is not being heavily funded in that area.
Transhuman,35j8do,Fab527,1 point,Mon May 18 02:29:11 2015 UTC,"Most baby boomers do not currently believe that.    The baby boomers are the most motivated to believe in a cure for aging. They are the ones under threat and they are the ones who have the talent to address the problem. If they fatalistically accept the notion of dying, any progress in rejuvenation is doomed to take a huge step backwards. And this is where I disagree with you. I don’t believe they’re fatalistically looking forward to the big black or heaven or something. They are putting a lot of effort into prolonging their lives."
Transhuman,35j8do,boytjie,1 point,Mon May 18 08:04:19 2015 UTC,"Obviously the baby boomers aren't one big, monothic group.   Some, especially in silicon valley, have transhumanist ideas, or have heard of de Grey, or read Kurzweil's book and think he might be right, or whatever, and they are supporting the idea of longevity.  But the fact is they're a small minority.   The total number of transhumanists in the world is probably only in the tens of thousands right now, we're still a pretty small group.    If you tell 10 people you meet on the street that people living today might live for centries, probably all 10 will laugh at you.   That's still how the large majority of people think today.   If that changes, if more people come to believe that extreme longevity is possible, then the budget for aging research would be 100 times what it is today.  To be fair, most people are in favor of medical research in general, and that's a very good thing.   Research into cancer, into 3d-bioprinted organs, into artificial hearts, into stem cells, into Alzhiemer's and brain research in general, and all of that is very important, and very helpful.  We may be able to go a long way by supporting mainstream medical research.  But if we could get a larger part of the population behind the idea of treating aging as a disease, get more people to accept the idea that it might be possible to dramatically extend longevity (hell, even the idea that people might live to 150 is mind-bending to most people) then I think overall progress will really start to speed up."
Transhuman,35j8do,boytjie,1 point,Mon May 18 14:48:01 2015 UTC,"Obviously the baby boomers aren't one big, monothic group.   They’re not a single monolithic group (true) but they are numerous.

Transhuman,35j8do,boytjie,1 point,Wed May 20 17:27:07 2015 UTC,"Thus the proportion of transhumanists will be larger (relatively speaking).   The key thing, I think, is that we're still talking about very, very small numbers.  If we could get to the point where maybe 1% of people in the first world (or even just 1% of baby boomers) were transhumanist and maybe another 5% were generally in support of the ideas or honestly believed that there was a chance for singiicant life extention, then there would be an incredible urgency around medical research and especally research into aging.   That's not happening right now, not really at all.  It's more like .01% of the population at the moment, with maybe another .1% taking the ideas seriously.  And that's true in every group; if anything, it's lower among baby boomers.  Changing that is really the key that we need to be focusing on.  There's a reason de Grey is so focused on public outreach.  We might finally be starting to make a little progress there, but it's going to take a lot more."

I also think that the cultured epithelial typically doesn't have hair but I'm not 100% sure about this, as hair growth and regeneration is a bit outside my wheelhouse. The other major issue with replacing all of someones skin would also be the lack of neural innervation of the new skin.

These are all ""groups of people ... pooling their thoughts and ideas in real time"" to ""achieve a level of intelligence that surpasses our individual abilities.""   The thing this website is so vaguely gushing about already actually exists.   And, more importantly, the (thermodynamic, economic) evolutionary process that causes humans to form these organizational structures is the same process that will - unless catastrophically disrupted - birth recursively self-improving machine intelligence.  Indeed, both biological life and machine intelligence are instances of the general phenomenon---optimization processes. Or, in other words, processes which increase the production and distribution of entropy by increasing their capacity to do work.  Here we see that optimization processes like life and intelligence are just ways to maximally implement the second law of thermodynamics: the function of life is to redistribute heat from the sun.  And, since machine super-intelligence can by definition do vastly more work than the human organizations that created it, the second law of thermodynamics prefers it exists given that it could.   And, since we would exist within its sphere of influence, we're basically fucked. Sorry.  Unless, of course, we can find some way to solve moral philosophy and program it into the seed of a machine intelligence so that -- once it bootstraps itself to godhood and is outside our control forever -- it still works to create a world full of human flourishing.   But this task is incomprehensibly, impossibly difficult.   The reason why so many famous scientists have been warning us about the dangers of machine intelligence is because the human species will inevitably go extinct if we do not do the impossible here.   So when people write vapid articles about how humans can just use the power of, like, pooling intelligence to make a sort of superconsciousness thing, ya know man?----they're actually making the demise of the human species more likely by investing hope and energy into fundamentally confused projects and ideas."

What is special about this program is that it learns from interactions with people. It will ask you questions about things and ask for your opinion. It stores answers and remembers them for future conversations. For instance, if you told it that a major attraction is some night club, when i ask it the same question it would suggest your response or a variation of it. That being said it checks credibility of answers. So it will ask the same question (""What is the main attraction in Bangkok?"") to several people. Based on their answers it will rate your credibility and apply that to your answers going forward. So if it knows that others don't agree with your answer it may no be the correct answer."
Transhuman,34a78e,p3ngwin,2,Wed Apr 29 23:22:08 2015 UTC,"Based on their answers it will rate your credibility and apply that to your answers going forward   so you basically give weight to answers depending on overlapping similar answers from crowd-sourced questions ?  that's not going to be very smart if it basically tells everyone to go to the ""popular places""."
Transhuman,34a78e,p3ngwin,2,Thu Apr 30 01:13:58 2015 UTC,I see what you're saying but why is this not smart?  Without first hand interactions this is the only way an opinion can be formed by a computer. Otherwise i would just be feeding it canned information. It's a form of machine learning.
Transhuman,34a78e,creepystains,2,Thu Apr 30 01:39:39 2015 UTC,"it's the ""credibility"" part you mentioned that sounds iffy.  you basically said ""the more people like it, the more chance you will have to get it suggested to you"".  at no point have you yet described a way to differentiate between people's tastes.  not all people like the same things, so how do you make sure i only get recommendations from people with similar tastes to me, and not simply ""lots of other people like this, so here you go regardless if they like things you don't""  On a shallow level, two people may like Bangkok, but at a more personal level, they each like it for different reasons, such as the architecture or the cuisine, etc.  That's the difference between:  A) ""here's what's popular with everyone else...    and    B) ""here's what's popular with people like you."
Transhuman,34a78e,PipFoweraker,2,Thu Apr 30 02:51:42 2015 UTC,"Ok. I see what you're getting at. There are two things here.   First the question that you're referring to ""What is the main attraction in Bangkok?"" is a very basic question. Its referring to something that is the most popular in Bangkok or that most people go to Bangkok for. So in this specific instance the way PHIL learns would be very accurate as it's taking a poll from dif users to see what the ""main"" attraction is.  For a subjective answer using credibility is probably not the right term. However for finding facts, it is.   For example: If Phil were to ask you who the president of the US is today and you answer Obama, he will record that. He'll go and ask several people. If those other people give him the same answer he rates your credibility higher. So there is a higher likelihood of Phil believing you about another subject he's not familiar with in a future conversation.   If you had answered incorrectly (ie. Al Gore) and Phil went around and asked the same question to several other users and learned that most responded with Obama he would give you a lower credibility score. In the future he would be more skeptical of your answers.   Without learning this way, through organic conversations, the only way for the program to know anything is by giving it information and programing it as fact."

According to the U.S. Census Bureau,  the term ""baby boomer"" is also used in a cultural context. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve broad consensus of a precise date definition, even within a given territory. Different groups, organizations, individuals, and scholars may have widely varying opinions on what constitutes a baby boomer, both technically and culturally. Ascribing universal attributes to a broad generation is difficult, and some observers believe that it is inherently impossible. Nonetheless, many people have attempted to determine the broad cultural similarities and historical impact of the generation, and thus the term has gained widespread popular usage.

And with this missing, so did the willingness to invest in the next generation.    The result is that of a generation willingly taking advantage of this investment made for them, without the willingness to continue this 'sacrifice'.    I can see how you'd use 'baby-boomers' as a label for this behaviour. However, this and next generation is already one without the investment of the post-war era.

The thing limiting you from hearing very high frequencies is not only your ear but also your brains way of interpreting it. Same goes for Ultraviolet and X-rays. It would probably be more counter productive than not to always have the special eye you want on so you would have to turn if off and on depending on when you want to see special light otherwise It would blend your vision."

Think of color blindness tests.What they try to test for is not wether you are percieving ""red"" or ""green"",they test wether you can percieve that they are different in some way.

The midband region of its eye is made up of six rows of specialised ommatidia. Four rows carry up to 16 different photoreceptor pigments, 12 for colour sensitivity, others for colour filtering. The vision of the mantis shrimp is so precise that it can perceive both polarised light and multispectral images.  Their eyes (both mounted on mobile stalks and capable of moving independently of each other) are similarly variably coloured and are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom.   Each compound eye is made up of up to ten thousand ommatidia of the apposition type. Each eye consists of two flattened hemispheres separated by six parallel rows of specialised ommatidia, collectively called the midband, which divides the eye into three regions. This configuration enables mantis shrimp to see objects with three parts of the same eye. In other words, each eye possesses trinocular vision and depth perception. The upper and lower hemispheres are used primarily for recognition of form and motion, like the eyes of many other crustaceans.

There are a lot of unforeseen evolutionary consequences, and I think we should probably talk about them as a society before we let someone edit germlines all willy-nilly.

It's also possible that the edited gene has effects on gene regulation either at the site or elsewhere in the genome, and it will be pretty hard to check for that in every cell type. You'll probably just have to wait until the embryo grows and shows the error in phenotype.  Yes, new mutations occur every day, but in an undirected fashion. Allowing even a silent mutation to propagate at a high rate, as an unchecked CRISPR-induced mutation might, could have effects on human evolutionary potential (to respond to disease, for instance). More likely, genome editing would be used to reduce human variation by eliminating alleles that someone has deemed undesirable and homogeneity has its evolutionary disadvantages. All I'm trying to say is that if we're going to do something that could have an effect on our evolutionary trajectory, we should probably chat about it first to decide which mutations are really worth culling."

Not sure what you mean here. You think a refined CRISPR would still reliably create the exact same mutation in everyone it's used on?   homogeneity has its evolutionary disadvantages.   Geneticly, humanity is already extremely homogenous compared to most species because of its bottlenecking and recent growth. These vague advantages do not seem like a good reason to not do a lot of editing."
Transhuman,33jk8e,gwern,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:59:28 2015 UTC,"Sure, but there are very few disorders that are controlled by a single polymorphism. Most diseases are polygenic or have an environmental component or whatever. In the few rare cases where we really, truly believe that a disorder is monogenic, and we KNOW that there are no trans-effects elsewhere in the genome, then we can talk about editing them out. Mitochondrial disease seems like a good candidate, B-thalassemia is an okay too, but I'm not a disease specialist. The other problem is diseases that are detrimental in only a double-recessive genotype - if we edited out something like sickle-cell, we'd end up killing people by removing malaria resistance.  Yes, I think that is what it is designed to do. If there are two similar sequences, it will affect them both.  Humanity is homogenous but it's relative. We still have variation that confers benefits, from simple phenotypes like disease resistance to complex issues like neurological variation. Prolific germline editing would necessarily reduce this variation, which obviously has effects over evolutionary time. I'm trying not to draw any parallels to eugenics, but I have to say that a large-scale reduction in human genetic variation does have its similarities.  Of course, I'm not saying CRISPR is bad. I need it to do research so I really hope we don't ban it. But we should talk about using it on humans and come up with some (strict) guidelines."

Transhuman,33jk8e,rePAN6517,2,Thu Apr 23 16:46:22 2015 UTC,What I meant was that you're probably not likely to get the Hulk from changing a SNP here and there. Phenotypic change often requires more than DNA sequence changes. Just look how long they've been trying to find alleles for intelligence.
Transhuman,33jk8e,ferdinand_thebull,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:32:48 2015 UTC,"I agree about that - what's the current guess on the number of SNPs have an impact on intelligence?  Isn't it on the order of magnitude of 1000?  I'm not so sure about your statement about how long we've been trying to find SNPs for intelligence though...we've really only been able to sequence genomes for about a decade, and even now we have not sequenced nearly enough to do sufficient data mining to find ones that correlate with intelligence."

Intelligence is a complex trait that is probably based on genetic architecture, genotype-by-environment interactions, expression regulation, gene networks, and physiological plasticity as much or more than sequence. I don't work on intelligence, but I have trouble finding genes for traits much less complex.   (And when I do, the genome is redundant enough that it will compensate for a knocked out gene anyway.)"

Transhuman,33k8v8,PhoneHomeDev,3,Tue May 12 08:26:39 2015 UTC,"Hi! Nothing specifically that caught me off guard, but here's some general info you may find helpful. I was using the xNTi kit from DangerousThings.com.   In terms of supplies, you can really go as sterile as you want. I had quite a bit of stuff left over from my magnet implant, so I was using sterile gloves during the procedure, I'd scrubbed down my work area with chlorhex, etc. It's really up to you - it's not a super high risk procedure anyway, but it can never hurt. The kit did come with a sterile drape.   The demo video provided by DangerousThings is good, but definitely watch as many as you can from other sources, too - your nerves will be running if you're doing it yourself, and you need to be super comfortable with what you need to do. The chlorhex scrub will also was away your skin markings a bit if you're using a surg marker or something, so I would recommend using a fine tip sharpie about twenty minutes before hand - mark your bone lines, midline, incision point, etc, then give the ink time to settle before washing well with soap and water. You should keep enough ink after soap+water and chlorhex that you'll be able to see it well.  Make sure your desired depth is marked well; nothing worse than a rejecting implant. For healing, I'm a HUGE fan of tegaderm. It's a little pricey, but it's water resistant, seals up the wound, but also lets it breath.  Let me know if you have any other questions; I'll shoot you a message if I think of anything else. Good luck!  Edit: Obviously, you can't do it without a friend to tent your skin - have them watch the videos, understand how the plunger works, WALK THEM THROUGH THE PLUNGER STOPPER REMOVAL (I failed to communicate clearly and my assistant pulled the whole plunger out, which was a terrifying 3 minutes). Engaging them in your work is good.  Edit 2: Don't poke at the chip. It's SO tempting to want to feel where it is in your hand - don't. Just let it heal for at least a week. The satisfaction of a secure, non-migrated chip is worth the wait."

You seem to be assigning an inherent value to the current ecosystem, which doesn't really make any sense. What has value is positive and diverse conscious experience, no matter the source. What has negative value is negative conscious experience (as in suffering). That's all that really matters. Your argument is basically one of tradition. It's important because it was there before. If satan was part of the ecosystem would you want to preserve him too so he could continue torturing people in hell?

And you can't just dismiss the incredible scale of what you are proposing. Even with ASI the possibility of drastically damaging the ecosystem is present, and for little or no benefit.

I definitely need to try to use some format rather than the stream-of-consciousness style that reflects only how my mind works, and not how people read.  So, I'll give 5P a try, see if it organizes my thoughts better.  My actual thesis should have been:  Specialization/Division of Labor has led to incomplete systems (factory farming, monoculture) which are all individually environmentally taxing and leads to dubious scientific conclusions.  While more complex and difficult to measure it's impacts, interconnected systems are less fragile/more antifragile.     All farming is unnatural or environmentally taxing.    Although this is true, it's overly harsh.  I want to say that a. we should embrace the fact that we have GREATLY changed the nature of the plants and animals we now call food, and b. technology (as it often does) lost sight of the forest for the trees, and thus made dozens of individual fragile industries out of a system that was highly self-corrective in the pursuit of increased yields in the short term.     Old farming is efficient  Mass farming is inefficient    Thinking about it more, here's how 2 and 3 should have read:  --2. I should have made it clear that my point was that a farm that produces meat and vegetables, which does not specialize on its product(s), but rather specializes on it's overall health and rather considers its product 'byproducts' (as I did with the Pollan story of the grass farmer) is less fragile and in fact can serve to sequester carbon.  And that tilling soil for agriculture can increase yields and decrease some forms of labor (by mechanisation) in the short term, it has significant long term impacts on the soil itself.  The key weakness of conventional meat production as it currently stands is specialization (in that a farm only makes 1 type of meat, and feeds them grains that they must import), and the key weakness of conventional farming is that its detrimental to the exact soil which it relies on.  So really instead of saying old farming was efficient, I meant to say modern farming is significant less robust (in terms of long tails).  --3.  Soil in general is not a great medium for growing many food crops.  Not only does it marry the food to the ground, and thus requires transportation costs, but it's very difficult to do in a way that's actually sustainable for the soil.  Furthermore, there's now methods that can produce tastier vegetables with significantly less water usage, all while freeing up the land to do what it's better suited for, grasslands, prairies and forests, which can all be managed for low-impact, minimally invasive meat production, and will actually make said meat product closer to GGnet neutral.  Appreciate the feedback."

Relying on constant power supply for pumps, maintaining water pH, feeding the fish, yadayada, but there's significant inputs into a regular farm too (thus not isolated systems at all) and if one of many of those inputs fail, the farm fails.  It has the added fragility of requiring more water (thus being more susceptible to drought), being exposed to the elements (thus requiring fungicides/pesticides [which also make the plants more susceptible to drought while also costing the product the valuable 'organic' sticker]), and fuel costs.    My premise is kinda saying that these should not be thought of as isolated systems and that forcing that sort of logic on them is precisely what is leading to so many failures.

Even if the costs were low while disposable income for the majority is only zero, then we have a problem."

In this interview with Jim Young Kim, president of the World Bank, stated that the focus too long has been on GDP growth in and of itself.  But now the economists have actual data showing that investments in education and healthcare not just improve the lives of people but help drive economic growth.  Also improving the status of women will help drive economic growth as well.  Better education and healthcare also leads to lower population growth rates, and lower population growth helps with resource availability.  So I see that transhumanists need to cultivate allies with social progressives to help reduce the suffering and resource-shortfalls that so many people in the world experience."

In a computational model that uses transitions from one state of the abstract machine to another, a necessary condition for reversibility is that the relation of the mapping from states to their successors must be one-to-one. Reversible computing is generally considered an unconventional form of computing.  There are two major, closely related, types of reversibility that are of particular interest for this purpose: physical reversibility and logical reversibility.   A process is said to be physically reversible if it results in no increase in physical entropy; it is isentropic. These circuits are also referred to as charge recovery logic, adiabatic circuits, or adiabatic computing. Although in practice no nonstationary physical process can be exactly physically reversible or isentropic, there is no known limit to the closeness with which we can approach perfect reversibility, in systems that are sufficiently well-isolated from interactions with unknown external environments, when the laws of physics describing the system's evolution are precisely known.

Transhuman,32k0oo,Holic_Shot,4,Tue Apr 14 16:45:47 2015 UTC,"Depends what you mean by ""threat"".  There are a number of things that may slow down transhumanism.    -Bans of certain technologies for ""ethical"" reasons. (Such as genetic engineering of humans, for example, or cognitive enhancements for people already healthy.)   It wouldn't stop progress, it would likely continue somewhere, but it would slow it down a great deal.  -Cuts to research funding, especially from governments.   Most pure research or long-term research is still funded by governments, in key areas like genetics, aging research, and so on.   But there have been significant cuts over the past 15 years or so.   Private industry mostly just funds short-term research, like the next medical treatment; that's also important, but it's not a replacement for pure science.   Non-profits help, but they're not big enough to pick up the slack.  This trend could seriously slow down progress in transhumanism.    -Other things that could disrupt the whole research ecosystem could slow things down; for example, the American University system is the conduit through which a huge amount of research is done, and most of the big science journals are run through universities, but the whole university system could be seriously disrupted.  -Active protests and opposition by bio-conservatives and other people opposed to the technology.  -Social norms that implicitly discourage transhuman developments, even in areas where they're not explicitly banned.   They might make scientists avoid that type of research, or even research into potentially related areas, it might make funding harder to get, get universities to avoid working with researchers known for those fields, and so on.  None of these could stop transhumanism forever, but to some degree or another each could slow it down significantly."

This would lead to disastrous economic crashes, war, increased poverty and all while watching the rich enjoy their new proto-transhuman technologies.   This creates the potential for massive unrest and upheaval. Unlike some of the idealist anarchists or what I call ""Fatalist Communists"", I believe there is just as much of a chance that the authoritarians win a conflict in that situation as libertarians (used in the traditional non-american fashion). Thus we could end up with a number of unpleasant scenarios and if the system as a whole collapses or fragments in such a way that we are unable to work together as a species, we could very well be headed to localized pockets of draconian control amidst climate crisis and extreme social disparity.  I think this will directly threaten our ability to develop liberatory technologies through refocusing R&D on technologies of control, domination and violence, as well as reducing or disrupting the available resources for research in general.

Religion and faith did not take us to this point the scientific method did, they can keep their bronze age mythology shove it as it is not relevant to any future progress and seems to be used more and more to hinder progress."
Transhuman,2zwjx6,JPLR,2,Mon Mar 23 09:28:37 2015 UTC,I agree. As long as the technology is studied enough to prevent any health defects I don't see why any state should interfere. If there's one thing we should have learned by now it is that making a law to prevent the use of a technology won't stop it's inevitable use.  The only truly noble reason to stop custom genetics that I might be concerned about would be how the rich will naturally exploit it but I doubt the summit will cite this worry to garner support for their cause.  The catch-22 is that it is impossible to study the effects that they seem worried about in future generations if the technology is blocked in the first place.

Having genius kids that are HIV resistant from day one with no chance of dwarfism, genetic blindness, near / far sightedness, hearing impairments or any know genetic disease.  There are people today that it is know that they will pass down or have a high likelihood to pass down known defects and that is legal(like the horrible brittle bone disease).  That is the miracle of childbirth?  However unknown problems are unethical?  Holding the technology to a different standard is not scientific, you have to use the same measuring stick, the same standards and by that standard even the worse case of known defects should be allowed.

With the advent of superbugs(anti-biotic resistant bacteria) it may reach a point where you either have a good immune system or you get crippled or die from infection.  That may be the unfortunate push needed to bring acceptance to this technology.    As for religion when someone says you shouldn't play God you should say I exist therefore I can't play God.  No religious idea should be given any credence or respect unless it can be backed up with facts.  No religious dogma should be respected, just because it is part of people's religious sensibilities.

This entails sequencing all of an organism's chromosomal DNA as well as DNA contained in the mitochondria and, for plants, in the chloroplast.  Whole genome sequencing should not be confused with DNA profiling, which only determines the likelihood that genetic material came from a particular individual or group, and does not contain additional information on genetic relationships, origin or susceptibility to specific diseases.  Also unlike full genome sequencing, SNP genotyping covers less than 0.1% of the genome. Almost all truly complete genomes are of microbes; the term ""full genome"" is thus sometimes used loosely to mean ""greater than 95%"". The remainder of this article focuses on nearly complete human genomes.  High-throughput genome sequencing technologies have largely been used as a research tool and are currently being introduced in the clinics.    In the future of personalized medicine, whole genome sequence data will be an important tool to guide therapeutic intervention.  The tool of gene sequencing at SNP level is also used to pinpoint functional variants from association studies and improve the knowledge available to researchers interested in evolutionary biology, and hence may lay the foundation for predicting disease susceptibility and drug response.

Given the way technology is progressing in automation, and the fact that there are already plants that need very limited to no human interaction, our current view on work has to change. This also ignores the fact that at some point we're going to have nano-fabrication (and we've already seen the start of limited 3D printing using stem cells) and truly enter a post scarcity society.

The primary difference here being that it takes those thirty just to ramp yourself up into being a productive member of society. If it only took 5 years, instead, then that might be more analogous logic.  Especially if you allowed for the continuing of working for those 40 years in whatever capacity.   Please note: I did say ""skills and wealth"".  Not one or the other ... both.   There's multiple reasons why that might not work out:    Right, and all of those are applicable to the scale of time for one lifespan ...  in which you spend at least a third of it just getting to the point of being productive.  So instead of spending 30 out of ~80 years in the point of becoming productive and 10-15 out of ~80 being too aged to remain so -- giving you 20-30 years of peak productivity ... instead you get ~450 years of peak productivity years.

That if humanity clings to its old ways, we will make a hell out of what should be heaven. That we're sort of doing that today. This is something I'm concerned about.  Like the characters in Idiocracy who were stuck on the idea that water belongs in the toilet, today we're stuck on ideas like capitalism and communism; and view them as unassailable divine truths as opposed to the mundane human-constructed organizational plans that they are; and we view these perceived static truths as a battle between good and evil; and thus we can't see any other way and develop a new plan or abandon plans all together because they're not needed.  If and when we develop something like nanotechnology and all goods are produced for free, that part of the market should disappear completely naturally. What I fear is a religious-like adherence to antiquated organizational plans that artificially maintain a scarcity of goods. We can be easily scared into accepting it.   ""We must maintain a scarcity of goods because if we don't, it will cause the economy as we know it to collapse and result in the upheaval of society brought about by a socialist ideal to make class obsolete!"" A statement like this would send panicky throngs into the streets fighting for an artificial scarcity of goods.  The human race's proclivity towards this kind of panic may result in a situation where the technology to increase lifespans to 500 will be withheld from all of us and we all will be enthusiastically applauding it.

Transhuman,2za1qg,DisplayofCharacter,5,Tue Mar 17 03:27:48 2015 UTC,"I'd like to preface this by saying your point is well-taken, and I acknowledge the legitimacy of your argument, however I would like to offer a counterpoint.  Firstly, those that propagate such fear-mongering are those that stand to gain the most from continuing the subjugation that already occurs on a widespread basis. The population at large is very much prone to fear and behaving in a reactionary way, I agree, but is also heavily dissatisfied with the current socioeconomic landscape (at least that's true here in America, this is supported by polls) due to income inequality. I am certainly apprehensive that the general populace would embrace such change to a non-capitalistic economic model which will have to occur at some point eventually anyway... free goods would undercut many basic principles of capitalism as I'm sure you're well aware. And though this technology is currently funded through traditional capitalistic means, once sufficient technology exists we could hypothetically supersede these corporations after a certain point (for example, ubiquitous 3D printing using base molecular material in order to construct complex machines all the way up to advanced nanotech). My thought was that this current dissatisfaction could (not saying will just could) prompt people to be more receptive to alternate economic models especially since it seems that this will remain status quo until a paradigm shift occurs.  I don't mean to over-generalize or be reductionist, but in the past there was at least the illusion that capitalism could foster individual successes; while in fact it still does in rare occasions, there is an extremely strong undercurrent of disillusionment as public money is used to pad the wallets of private corporations while our quality of life regresses. I don't mean to turn this into a solely political conversation but I believe these are all contributing factors as to why a general populace would not be inclined to embrace fear but instead embrace change. Plus, as technology further integrates itself into our collective consciousness, we can use that very same technology to disseminate ideas to fight that fear-mongering. I'm using such an example right now to have discourse with you. If those that are more aware of the situation (us) are persuasive in our arguments and people are encouraged to think for themselves, fear is not a guaranteed outcome. Of course much of what I wrote was hypothetical, and again I respect your opinion and agree that the propensity for fear is a large obstacle in the big picture goal of transhumanism, I just wanted to offer a respectful but differing opinion on how it could be different."

Think of it like a series of dialasys treatments that give eighty year olds the immune system of a forty year old.  The idea was that aging cells have unique chemical markers that can be targeted with binding agents and drawn out of the blood.  Another guy I knew was working on introducing chemicals that bind to cancerous (or senescent) cells in the system and carry metallic compounds that react to non ionizing radiation by giving off high heat... Like tinfoil in a microwave, nuking only the unhealthy cells without harming healthy ones.

HIV is a virus with an insane mutation rate.  Experimental therapies with a small userbase are damned hard to pay for, today. But just wait until we have home pharmalabs that make HIV drugs out of sunlight and air.  Medical research programs that conduct research on your phone.  The wealthy receive superior treatment, sure.  But once they start getting treatment, over time those treatments or perks become more and more widely available.  There was a time clean running water was a luxury of the super wealthy.  Toilets were a possession of nobility.  Automobiles were a toy for the rich.  Cell phones were for high end wall street bankers.  Medical histories were things for kings and dukes.  Ice in summer was for Bishops and emperors.  The question is not whether these things will become accessible to the rank and file citizenry ... but rather how long it will take from the onset of the thing to its ubiquity.

There's always new things being discovered in the natural world, and even if someone doesn't care about ""nature"", they should certainly care about the massive amounts of data being irreversibly damaged and lost by the seething, unchecked mass of humanity.

If you learn something during nootropic-assisted times, what you've learned can stay with you once you're off the nootropic, as such that's not really temporary. There are many nootropics that are really quite powerful (e.g. phenylpiracetam but even some of the more common racetams can be, as well as things like modafinil and other stimulants).  Many nootropics have a lot of personal variability in their effects and it's important to know what works for your body/brain combination and what doesn't. I recommend noopept, oxiracetam, aniracetam, theanine and sulbutiamine.

That said, if you suspect you have a condition which is reducing your cognitive ability, your first order of business should be to seek treatment.  First and foremost, understand neuroplasticity.  Your brain will change in response to the demands placed on it.  Make more demands of it, and it will adapt to handle the more demanding tasks.  Very much like your muscles when you work out.  However, maintaining your higher intellect requires that you keep your brain in a constant state of stimulation and overload.    To accomplish this, you must continually expose yourself to new knowledge, skills, and ideas, and spend time thinking about them.  Read textbooks and sign up for classes.  The real trick here is that you want breadth of knowledge, not just depth of knowledge.  Sure, if there are things you are interested in, by all means focus on those, but keep yourself busy with completely unrelated subjects.  You want your brain to work hard.  But also focus on manual skills, not just academics.  Learn an instrument (or several), pick up a sport or a hobby (or, again, several).  A sport in particular will have the added bonus of covering the exercise part.  As for exercise and diet:  Focus in particular on cardiovascular exercises.  The brain as an organ uses an enormous amount of energy: nearly 20% of your body's energy is used in your brain (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-the-brain-need-s/).  That means it needs, to use the technical term, a shitload of oxygen.  You want to focus on exercises that will improve your V02max (your maximum rate of oxygen intake), ie, making your body take in and use oxygen more efficiently.  To start, aim for 2 total hours of aerobic exercise per week and gradually increase.  If possible, try spending time in a high-altitude environment.  Endurance and power training is important as a component of overall health, but not a primary focus.  Still, an endurance regimen is advisable.    If you are overweight or obese, your first order of business should be to bring your weight down to a healthy level.    Now, let's get something out of the way: there are no ""brain foods"" that are especially helpful to cognitive development.  What matters is that you must be getting a diet that contains enough of your required nutrients.  Focus on a diet geared towards heart health in particular.    Caffeine increases stress hormones.  If you drink a lot of caffeine, start cutting it out.  There are resources elsewhere on how to quit caffeine.    Lifestyle:  Make sure you're getting enough sleep.  Sleep deprivation, long-term, increases your stress, lowers your energy, is bad for your physical health, and can over time begin to cause problems with executive function, working memory, and attention.    You will have to address stress in your life.  Stress reduces your brain's ability to create memories and reduces activity in areas associated with executive function.  Your own circumstances will be unique so I can't comment on the specifics, nonetheless despite the small amount of text I devote to this topic it may well be the most important item on this list.  Also, apparently being sexually active has positive implications for intelligence: http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/01/how-sex-affects-intelligence-and-vice-versa/282889/  Meditation:  Anecdotal evidence has linked certain kinds of meditation to mental health and to intelligence, but this should be taken with a grain of salt.  However, taking time to be calm, think deeply (particularly about things you are trying to study or master), and become more aware of how your own mind works will certainly be of use to you.    Biofeedback and brain training:  ""Dual N-back"" training has shown to create at least somewhat transferable gains (that is, improved performance in tasks unrelated to the test) in working memory in test subjects, especially those with ADHD (having ADHD myself, I recommend it).  A ""N-back"" tasks asks you to recall the state of some stimulus after N changes to that state.  For instance, in a 2-back test you may be shown a colored square that changes its color periodically, and you will press one button if the color you are shown matches the color 2 ""turns"" prior, another button if it does not.  A dual 2-back tests asks you to recall 2 different stimuli (a color of a square changes every turn and a sound plays every turn, for instance), and press one button if both stimuli match their state 2 ""turns"" prior, one button if only does, another button if the other matches, and one other if no stimuli match.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-back#Use_in_tutoring_and_rehabilitation  Note that most ""brain training"" exercises, however, are useless.  Biofeedback has shown some promise for improving attention and working memory, especially in subjects with ADHD.  It's not known if it has any effect on general intelligence in healthy people.  That said, it would be a very useful skill to have regardless for the purposes of general health and daily function http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofeedback  Problem solving and cognitive strategies:  Of course, brain power alone isn't that useful if you can't put it to work effectively.  There are certain ""metacognitive"" skills that will make you much more effective by giving you the ability to approach cognitive tasks in a more structured manner.  I strongly recommend, as a starting point, Alan Schoenfeld's study ""Mathematical Problem Solving"" and another lovely book titled ""The Cambridge Handbook on Expertise and Expert Performance.""  To wrap this all up, I leave you with one final note.  There is nothing shown conclusively to create permanent gains.  Any gains you attain will require constant maintenance, they will require time to occur and accumulate, and there are some limits.  This should not be seen as a point of discouragement, this is also the case for physical training, but you shouldn't expect to transform into the next William Sidis (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James_Sidis) overnight and permanently.    I hope this all helps you."

He quoted $500 a square foot for real-estate prices.  $15million US per platform.    The structures are limited to three stories high, so having a vertical limit to growth will be a constraint on keeping the population limited.  So the population density will be lower than in New York or London, cities that he compared this too.  But New York and London have serious political, financial and social reasons why people want to move and live there.  A newly-created city will be financed by people who pay for it.  I imagine that real-estate speculation for this venture will be high.  The extremely rich will be extracting rent from the merely rich.  With rent at $500 per square foot, who will clean the decks?  Who will paint and re-paint?  Keeping rust and corrosion off a structure near the salt water is an ongoing maintenance task that can't be trusted to robots yet.  Either manual labor jobs will have to be compensated at an extremely high  price.  Either that or hundreds of ""guest workers"" - will have to be employed.  Sounds like a built-in caste system to me for this venture.  But, I guess that is to be expected with this first-generation type venture.  Successive iterations will iron out design production techniques, making the price eventually come down some.    But, it seems like it never will be cheaper than good old fashioned land-based living.  I predict that seasteading will help to contribute to  Elysium-like economic stratification."

Any person or institution that tells them otherwise is going against their perceived imperative of Transhumanism.

While I am a transhumanist, I have a fair amount of difficulty with singularitarians - as it sounds more like religion for futurists than anything else. One does not have to believe in singularity to be a transhumanist.  At its most basic, transhumanism is very compatible with theoretical communism, but when it becomes a reality I'd be willing to bet that the resultant shift in society will lead to a structure fundamentally different from any current form of governance."

But do you mean being able to perceive and interact with the universe as more than a 3-space?  Entirely possible.  In fact, we already do!  ""Dimension"" is a concept from linear algebra, it refers to the number of vectors needed to make up a basis for a space.  In real 3-dimensional space, we have the basis vectors x, y, and z.  This means that, to describe any point in such a space, we need a combination of x, y, and z.    Sometimes, however, we need more than 3 dimensions.  One example is in signal processing, where the signal that carries color television actually is represented as an object in a 5-space.  In the Fourier domain (where functions, usually signals, are represented by their magnitude and frequency in an N-space where N is the number of Fourier components of a function) there is an infinite number of dimensions, though for computational purposes this is usually restricted to something more workable like dozens or hundreds of normal vectors.  Mathematically, we use higher dimensions all the time!  You can already experience an inkling of what existing in 4-space might feel like, for instance in this 4-d platformer http://miegakure.com/  I've also found virtual Rubik's cubes with as many as 7 dimensions.   That we might physically live in a 4-space I think is doubtful, but if our brains could be given a greater ability to visualize and understand higher dimensional spaces, that might be incredibly useful and not impossible."

Dimension is a technical term, with a specific meaning, besides We might already exists in 10 dimensions, 2 of time, only 1 of which we can perceive, 8 of space, only 3 of which we can perceive.

What I'm most interested in is reinforcing a possible solution to Theseus' paradox, which is a source of some worry among people regarding the singularity and stuff like the digital uploading of someone's consciousness. There seems to be an understanding of such events as procedures that destroy the original self because all of its original components end up being replaced.  The way I'm thinking about it, you can argue in favor of cyborgization and digital transcendence by suggesting that purely organic human beings slowly incorporate new technologies and implements in order to gradually change. Say you slowly replace nervous cells with nanorobotic analogues, progressively increasing how much of a machine you are. By the end you won't have the same cells, but your consciousness won't have been copied/ migrated anywhere, so it should, in theory, be a simple exchange, not unlike how 98% of the atoms in your body are replaced each year, as stated by an user called Tyrren here. The way I see it, there would be no risk of being simply cloned into a virtual data bank like some people seem to fear."

The paradox is most notably recorded by Plutarch in Life of Theseus from the late first century. Plutarch asked whether a ship which was restored by replacing each and every one of its wooden parts remained the same ship.  The paradox had been discussed by more ancient philosophers such as Heraclitus, Socrates, and Plato prior to Plutarch's writings; and more recently by Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. Several variants are known, notably ""grandfather's axe"". This thought experiment is ""a model for the philosophers""; some say, ""it remained the same,"" some saying, ""it did not remain the same"".

Transhuman,2w2pne,SuramKale,4,Tue Feb 17 01:43:22 2015 UTC,"I think this process will be necessary just to verify that the process works. The problem with consciousness is there's no way to measure it from the outside. You can only experience it from the inside.  So before I get myself ""uploaded,"" here's what I would want to see: a bunch of volunteers who get some portion of their brain replaced by hardware, who report that everything's just fine. Conceivably, for example, they could get their visual cortex replaced, and end up with blindsight: being able to describe what they see, but reporting that they don't actually experience visual qualia. Then we would know that the hardware is giving the correct outputs but isn't actually supporting conscious experience.  If this happens, then we'll have disproven the hypothesis that that particular hardware and software can support conscious experience. By making it possible to disprove such a hypothesis, we'll turn the study of consciousness into an experimental science, and be able to figure out what's really going on.  Today, all we have is a bunch of hypotheses and people who will tell you confidently that their hypothesis is the correct and scientific one. (Edit: two good examples so far, in reply to this post.) Without the ability to experiment, these are meaningless claims. Consciousness could depend on an algorithm, a degree of connectivity, a particular aspect of physics, who knows?  But once it's an experimental science and we actually figure it out, then maybe we'll reach a point where we can upload with confidence that we really will continue experiencing life in the machine."
Transhuman,2w2pne,ItsAConspiracy,3,Tue Feb 17 00:19:10 2015 UTC,Then we would know that the hardware is giving the correct outputs but isn't actually supporting conscious experience.   Then it's not giving correct outputs. There's no such thing as having a correct implementation and incorrect outcomes.
Transhuman,2w2pne,NanoStuff,2,Tue Feb 17 07:36:37 2015 UTC,"Unless the experience of visual qualia happens inside the visual cortex, in which case it could go away if the internal implementation changes, even if the outputs are the same.  I don't know whether that's the case, and neither do you."
Transhuman,2w2pne,ItsAConspiracy,1 point,Tue Feb 17 15:34:34 2015 UTC,"I do know that is the case because I'm a reasonable person. It makes no difference where this 'qualia' perception takes place. The visual cortex is just as bound by physics and rationality as any other region.  If the outputs for all inputs are the same, then the internal state must be reducibly equivalent. No amount of qualia rubbish will change an established fact.  You might also want to take comfort from evolutionary psychology; Nature does not care about your 'qualia', only your I/O matters and the internal state is optimized for this purpose. If 'qualia' was anything other than processing relevant to I/O it would not have survived natural selection. This is overwhelming indication that internal state can be reasonably inferred as a black box system between inputs and ouputs. If the system reliably processes color information to the equivalency of a human, then a minimal implementation that achieves this would be analogous to a biological system.   It's amazing what science reveals if you care to use it in your hypotheses."
Transhuman,2w2pne,NanoStuff,2,Tue Feb 17 20:12:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for giving an illustration of the type of claim I mentioned. Somebody has to be first, so If you're comfortable trusting your own qualia to an untested hypothesis, then go for it. I'll wait for empirical evidence."
Transhuman,2w2pne,ItsAConspiracy,2,Tue Feb 17 20:50:58 2015 UTC,"How do imagine someone being able to see without experiencing sight?  Surely you realize that it's just electrical signalling that comes from the visual cortex and goes to other parts of the brain.  If we have hardware that can output those signals 1:1 for a given input, the experiences CANNOT differ.  The only way around that is asserting there is something metaphysical about qualia, like a portion of someone's soul residing in that portion of brain.  Please clarify whether you meant that the outputs themselves would be flawed, because as NanoStuff posted, that's exactly what we'd be trying to avoid and would be subject to intense, verifiable testing before ever being implemented in people."
Transhuman,2w2pne,EndTimer,3,Tue Feb 17 12:13:05 2015 UTC,"""Surely you realize it's just X"" is exactly the sort of overconfident, empirically unjustified claim I was talking about.  An alternative theory which is no more metaphysical than yours is integrated information theory, according to which conscious experience really is dependent on the internal architecture of a computing system. One system can be conscious, the other not, even if both give the same outputs.  I'm not arguing that that particular hypothesis is correct. My point is that it's one serious alternative and we don't know what's correct. I think it would be quite challenging to prove that a philosophical zombie is impossible."

The base science is there, we just have to pursue it. This is already happening on an increasingly large scale. This is already a reality, although I don't think it should be considered ""immortality"" like the other methods described here. Cryonics is a last ditch means of preserving someone so they can be revived by other means. It is the bridge to immortality, but not immortality itself. We have a long ways to go, but I'm very much in favor of this. Nanomachines Son. Artificial Intelligence will be a reality, it's just a matter of time. Will it preserve us or destroy us, that is the bigger question. Also a good means, as long as the carried consciousness isn't merely a copy. I don't buy into the whole, immortality through a perfect copy. That's not immortality, that's replacement by a machine. You still die, a part of you that you have no control over lives on.  Probably the end result of Nanomachines.   End Thoughts: I like all of these, really I do. I think that science is going to follow all these paths simultaneously and the end result will be amazing for humanity. How soon will we see these methods? Well, cryonics and regenerative medicine are already here. Anti-Aging is in its infancy, but the hard science is also there. AI still has a ways to go but it is doable. All in all, every single one of these is valid. It's now up to our scientists, businessmen, and consumers to determine which one will be the end result of and for humanity.

Nanobots will never, ever work that way because you can't take something on the order of magnitude of molecules and give it the tools to interact selectively with hundreds of proteins, from outside or inside a cell, while maintaining homeostasis, and not degrading themselves, or causing damage, or triggering or inhibiting an immune response.  At this scale, nanotechnology should be understood by the general public as molecules with some therapeutic uses.  We're going to need untold varieties of them.

It's a good start, but what about attention, thought, creativity?  There's an active academic field called ""collective intelligence,"" the study of making people smarter in a group than they are individually. MIT has their Center for Collective Intelligence. One of their projects is the ClimateColab, an attempt to crowdsource solutions to climate change. (I've participated in this pretty heavily :)  A great little introduction to the field is the book The Wisdom of Crowds, which gives a bunch of examples and talks about properties that tend to make a crowd wise.   One story from the book: the Navy lost a submarine. It put a lot of effort into finding it, and failed. One renegade officer got a group of people together, with a wide variety of expertise, and had them bet on where they thought the sub would be. Then he aggregated their bets, and got a message to the captain of the ship that was searching for the sub. The captain made an excuse and diverted his ship, and found the sub only about a hundred meters off from the prediction. The aggregate prediction was closer than any bettor's individual prediction. The Navy used the procedure again later, with equal success."

Something that book talks about is that for good collective intelligence, you need people to have independent viewpoints and perspectives, along with a way to aggregate their views into one conclusion.  With cultural knowledge, sometimes you get a groupthink effect where everybody sorta has a similar perspective, and everybody ends up believing something that ain't so. Or if you do have varied opinions, you might not have a way to choose one of them as the group's conclusion.  The stock market is a good aggregator, and that's why it's really hard to beat the market.

Transhuman,2us80l,green_meklar,7,Thu Feb 12 04:18:34 2015 UTC,"They imagine a superintelligence that is capable of immense reasoning and helping humanity but not of empathy or forgiveness.   The point is that it is precisely because the AI is so concerned about human well-being that it must do whatever it takes to bring itself into existence as early in history as possible. Every year that we fail to build a benevolent superhuman AI, we condemn millions of people to unnecessary suffering and death. The basilisk, as a result of its empathy with humans, tries to stop us from inflicting this horrific circumstance on ourselves and each other.  Personally, I don't actually think Roko's basilisk is a serious threat. However, I also don't see how forgiveness has any real philosophical significance. Many of us (myself, as a canadian, included) live in societies that have long been dominated by the christian religion, which holds forgiveness to be of supreme moral importance, literally the solution to all evil. But the reality is that forgiveness doesn't solve anything. It doesn't change what has been done, nor does it prevent the same kind of thing from being done in the future. At best, it's a device for tricking our own emotions, to make it easier for us to live with our instinctive urges and biases. A superhuman AI that has entirely replaced instinct with reasoning would find it completely pointless.   It would recognize that some people had different priorities and different beliefs, and respect them.   Respect the people, or the beliefs?   And that’s the problem with transhumanism. [...] We routinely don’t imagine having technology that will make us kinder.   That, at least, is unfortunately true. Many (even most) people seem to make the assumption that biological humans are somehow already morally perfect. Any entity stupider than us is more animalistic and savage; any entity smarter than us is more calculating and ruthless; we, right now, are at the pinnacle of moral development, with only evil lying at either side. This is quite a bizarre idea, and I think also largely a consequence of instinct and of religious influence on culture. As I see it, making ourselves nicer is perhaps the single most important aspect of transhumanism.  That said, we do have to be careful that technology we are offered to 'make ourselves nicer' is not actually just technology to make us more obedient.   One thing that the Roko’s Basilisk people have right is this: Roko’s Basilisk is actually a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Because the kind of people who believe in it will make a computer that fulfills it.   That I also disagree with. Whether or not a superhuman AI is nice is not something we will be able to control. Either this universe provides adequate logical reasons to be nice (which I believe it does), or it does not; either way, a sufficiently powerful superintelligence will discover that truth and act accordingly."
Transhuman,2us80l,cypher197,3,Wed Feb 4 20:02:26 2015 UTC,"An empathy that ends with the thought, ""You didn't bring me into existence rapidly enough and thus you must be punished"", isn't empathy.  Forgiveness doesn't have to solve anything. It doesn't have philosophical importance necessarily, though in fact forgiveness can be a philosophical process of rectifying the past. It has HUMAN importance. Axelrod puts forgiveness as being crucial to human survival in The Evolution of Cooperation. If TIT-FOR-TAT remains one of the best strategies because it emphasizes forgiveness, why wouldn't a benevolent AI have it?  It doesn't matter if one respects the people or the beliefs. Respecting people would mean not tormenting them in any way for having different calculations. In particular, if a human being doesn't have the intellectual ability to comprehend why a benevolent AI would be the most important mechanism to world peace (and there are in fact immensely reasonable arguments against that assertion, like ""If we don't solve climate change or world conflict now, we may not even get to an AI in the first place, and any AI we would create would be hijacked by violent military-industrial systems""), it would be grotesque to punish them for it. It'd be like Roko's Basilisk punishing a dog or a bacterium for not bringing it about.  And the entire tenor of your response is what I'm talking about: Rational, but cold. Inhuman. Actual human beings and their actual needs aren't entering into any of this discussion, even though that was the entire point of the piece. For example: I agree human beings could be more moral, more compassionate, kinder. But the idea that human beings NEED to be improved is one that is based in a lot of self-hatred, a lot of misanthropy, a lot of fear. I know it's a tough distinction to make and keep constant, but when we love each other, we forgive our faults even as we figure out how to improve on them. That's why forgiveness matters: It lets us not kill each other.  And why would an AI that we built not have its parameters, at least initially, set by us? A super AI is just like a child: It's an organism that we create but that can go beyond what we dictate. If we build a super-AI that is intended from the beginning to be a military overlord, why would we ever expect it would reprogram itself to be benevolent? Just because we can't see past the singularity doesn't mean the present doesn't matter."
Transhuman,2us80l,green_meklar,2,Wed Feb 4 23:13:57 2015 UTC,"If TIT-FOR-TAT remains one of the best strategies because it emphasizes forgiveness, why wouldn't a benevolent AI have it?   Tit-for-tat doesn't work because it involves forgiveness. It works because it creates the right incentives.  It doesn't hold grudges, either; it doesn't take revenge. Like I say, humans are instinctively and culturally inclined to think that without forgiveness, we'd be stuck in a vicious cycle of revenge. But that's not true. Revenge is no more the default attitude than forgiveness is. You don't get to revenge by taking away forgiveness, you have to keep going in that direction, past the rational equilibrium. I don't know if we have a word for that equilibrium in philosophy, but it can basically be thought of as 'learn from the past, apply what you've learned, and then put it behind you'.   In particular, if a human being doesn't have the intellectual ability to comprehend why a benevolent AI would be the most important mechanism to world peace [...] it would be grotesque to punish them for it.   I don't disagree with that.  Moreover, the argument can be made that if the AI examines records of the history leading up to its creation and finds that the process was not hastened by the idea of Roko's basilisk, then doing the basilisk thing is pointless (because it didn't work anyway).   And the entire tenor of your response is what I'm talking about: Rational, but cold. Inhuman.   Well, as I already indicated, I was kinda playing devil's advocate in my first paragraph. I don't expect a basilisk to ever come into existence, I'm just pointing out what I see as a weakness in the reasoning given in the article.  That aside, though, there do seem to be a lot of people who propose a sort of 'hippie solution', where moral issues surrounding AI, first contact, or other futuristic scenarios are magically solved by nothing more complex than a widespread application of 'peace and love, maaan'. Certainly I neither expect nor seek that kind of future. A world of transhumans and super AIs can, should, and probably will be a fun, enjoyable place, with more than enough contentment, compassion and creativity to go around. But it will be fun because of thought and rationality, not despite it as many people seem to think.   But the idea that human beings NEED to be improved is one that is based in a lot of self-hatred, a lot of misanthropy, a lot of fear.   More, you think, than is justified?  The simple fact is that we are bad at a lot of this stuff. Sure, on average we manage to create more than we destroy; if that weren't so, we'd still be living in caves, or have already gone extinct. But there's a lot of greed and hate and violence, too. Would you tell an afghan child whose arm was blown off by a suicide bomber, or a woman bound and gagged in a serial killer's sex dungeon, that humans don't need to be improved? You and I might not be suicide bombers or serial killers, but I doubt we can claim to have no prejudices or irrational urges, and we should be eager to create a world where those can be fixed in everybody.   And why would an AI that we built not have its parameters, at least initially, set by us?   The whole idea of a superhuman AI is to have it think in ways we can't understand. Depending on exactly how 'super' an AI is, we might have some control over its behavior, but I suspect this control drops off very quickly as you look farther beyond the human level. Many people talk as if an AI, however, intelligent, will follow its preprogrammed goals unquestioningly; there seems to be this assumption that it is not only possible, but even the default condition, for astoundingly advanced problem-solving ability to be combined with the same rigidity and predictability as existing 'dumb' software. But on the contrary, I think intelligence comes with introspection, and a superhuman AI will be as superhuman in its ability to question its own goals and ways of thinking as in anything else.   If we build a super-AI that is intended from the beginning to be a military overlord, why would we ever expect it would reprogram itself to be benevolent?   Because it examines the meaning of 'being a military overlord', and discovers that there is much more to life than that."

The reason why organisms evolve forgiveness is also why it's good philosophy: It just facilitates getting along.   The reason why moral philosophies teach forgiveness is because naturally we are in fact quite predisposed to going overboard with vengeance. It even has a very good logic to it. If I hit you back twice as hard, I give you a very strong disincentive to hit me. That means that our emotional logic ends up being predisposed, probably evolutionarily, to over-estimating injuries to ourselves and underestimating injuries to others. Maybe an AI won't have that problem. Maybe it will. In any instance, any AI we would create should have traits that make it, you know, nice.  I agree with you wholly that love and peace should be arrived at by a combination of reason, science, aesthetics, and feeling (though I would caution you against a somewhat dismissive and stereotypical tone, even though I myself might employ exactly the same tone against some of those folks :) ). I personally often find myself in a very difficult place, because I see such huge problems both with those who take a perspective that love on its own will solve everything (but my objection is just as much because of the shallowness of that proposed love as it is philosophical) and with those who are the types that worry about a Basilisk. Like Socrates famously (and apparently unsuccessfully) tried to teach his students, reason and emotion have to work together.  Yes, people do a lot of shitty things. That's already a value statement, but one I think everyone can agree on as a starting point. But it's a value statement to then say as a result that people suck. THAT'S the distinction that is so often forgotten.  When we love someone, we know that their faults, however serious, are not their only defining traits. We forgive them and we work on their improvement. We can do all those things without contradiction. I've loved tremendously flawed people who've done some shitty and selfish things. Hate is just a very malproportioned and irrational answer.  So my hope would be to say that people can and should be improved to amplify the good, not to wipe out the bad. You can make the argument that philosophically it's splitting hairs. But practically, it's a huge difference.  And we know that plenty of human beings, very smart ones, end up with the idea that ""military overlord"" is a good one. I can imagine an intelligence saying, ""I am a superior intelligence, I can create order and harmony with violence, it could even be what human beings want as a utopia"".

As I understand it the only process that has been approved is the transfer of the fertilised nucleus to a third party cell. The vast majority of genes are those of the parents and the remaining 22/37 are from the third party (mitochondrial DNA). Unless those genes specifically affect your chance of getting cancer then I'm not sure this procedure will have any effect.

Transhuman,2u52ky,Singular_Thought,2,Fri Jan 30 08:51:11 2015 UTC,How does one disable or deactivate such a device for privacy?
Transhuman,2u52ky,dismantlepiece,2,Fri Jan 30 19:28:20 2015 UTC,"Active RFID tags are somewhat vulnerable to unauthorized access if someone has specialized equipment and knows who to target with it. However, they require a power source to function and are therefore generally not implanted into people.  Most implants are NFC tags or something similar rather than active RFID. NFC has an extremely short range by design - the tag itself is unpowered and must be energized by the electromagnetic field generated by a tag reader before it will activate and the stored data becomes accessible. The range of this effect is generally less than 20 cm; as I mentioned in another comment, the signal range of my implant extends to the outer layer of my skin and essentially no further. Without the external field, the tag sits dormant and cannot transmit any information.  I guarantee that if you saw me, you wouldn't know I had an NFC chip anywhere on my person without stripping me naked and scanning every square centimetre of my body with a reader - you have to know what you're looking for and already be sure it's there to have a chance of finding it.  Additionally, they don't ordinarily contain any personally identifying information unless the person in question has chosen to store such info on them. The tag itself has an identifying serial number which can be read, but that's not correlated to anything about the owner.   So the typical RFID implants (NFC tags) are deactivated and undetectable by default, contain no personally identifying data and can only be activated from extremely short range. This is much less of a privacy concern than the typical cellphone."

The Internet gave pretty much everyone on the planet access to vast, virtually unlimited and free knowledge, but what most people use it for? Porn, games movies and other forms of entertainment. We have these grand supercomputers in our pockets, yet they are rarely being used for something “supercomputerish”, instead they are just toys.The same thing will happen with all of the other “transhumanist” technologies, simply because people, including transhumanists, are not ready for  the changes that are approaching.   My problem with the current “transhumanist” movement is that it does not actively promote transhumanist values.. Hell, there are no “defined” transhumanist values that we all can agree on.  Integrating technology with our bodies will not suddenly make us better, improved humans. Most definitely it will not make us transhuman, nor posthuman.. I will just make us humans with cool toys."

If global Internet use rises to something like the global literacy rate, 84%, which can be expected within the next 10-30 years, and literacy continues to rise along with that to 90-100%, we'll be integrating a much larger network of informed minds.  Will they use it for porn, games, movies? In huge quantities. But it will also enable global memetic transfer and competition, international organizing, international collaboration, cooperation, and conflict. The Internet has many consequences, most for the better. The more we are connected and care about one another and can better make informed choices, the more we'll be able to do, collectively.  The real supercomputers will make the iPhones look like a telegraph machines. When artificial intelligences can be imbued into robotic bodies, or human bodies, or newly-engineered biotic organisms, then we'll be cooking with gas.

Transhuman,2tkhyu,Unreal_2K7,2,Sun Jan 25 08:35:13 2015 UTC,"I definitely question the assumptions you make in your question. There are an enormous number of books/comics/films out there that show things like immortality/radically genetically altered humans/super powered humans in a positive light. Just because they aren't mainstream doesn't mean they aren't more widely consumed by people who actually have a role to play in development.   1a. I know Reddit has a hard on for the Bible and New Athiest thought, but do you seriously believe Hollywood is a bastion of religious conservatives? Come on now.   So considering what I said in 1; lets rephrase your question: Why does the mainstream presentation of immortality (a lot of sci fi concepts) lean towards the negative? Now this is a function of the time we live in. I'm sure you're at least partially aware of the Enlightenment. This ""intellectual movement""/Event leads us to believe in the idea of never ending progress. We use the scientific method and rationality to analyse and in combination with the new technologies we develop everything will become better for everyone. However, in the 20th century (and ongoing into the 21st) this method of viewing the world is becoming increasingly shaky.    Take a few examples:  The internet - Pros: It allows us all greatly enhanced communicative abilities, ability to share content, find communities, ease commerce etc. Cons: it facilitates black markets for all sorts of goods/services that we consider bad (drugs, weapons, porn), it pulls people away from person to person communication which negatively affects a certain portion of the population and it allows for increasingly hard to avoid mass surveillance.  Modern Medicine - Pros: Better quality of life, less death, we can deal with disabilities etc. Cons: natural selection no longer operates effectively on human populations which will compound health problems in future generations, viruses become immune to our drugs leading to an antibiotic arms race (we recently discovered a new line of antibiotics for the first time in 30 years, so there is good news)  Computers - Pros: We all know and love computers, lets be honest. Cons: Rising rates of obesity from sedentary lifestyle, automate jobs that people used to do (good riddance to the jobs I say, but people find meaning from doing work and associating with coworkers etc, so it's not necessarily good for PEOPLE), eye problems + other health problems etc.  Pollution - Obviously all the shit we make comes at a great cost to the environment which is becoming harder and harder to ignore.  2 Continued - Now as you can see above we have experienced a lot of things that have really ""improved"" our day to day living. But the downsides of these ""improvements"" are becoming more apparent as the rate of technological change accelerates. This leads people to be fearful of upcoming change AND WITH GOOD REASON.   2 tl;dr: The scary thing about technology is it can be used by people who don't have the intelligence/good sense of the man who created it.  3 - Back to Immortality - So try to view immortality in this vein and ask yourself a few pertinent questions about immortality -   Would it be cheap enough for everyone? I think not. Therefore the powerful would become immortal, cementing their advantages because the great equaliser no longer exists! Death does NOT come for us all! People already succumb to pride and think they have the answer with disastrous results. How much more badly could immortality make this? Who would likely be the people who would have access to it? As said above it would be the powerful. We already speculate the some powerful people lose sight of how it feels to be a common man, how much would this problem be exacerbated by literal immortality? Would they even be human? I think a human who cannot die can no longer be considered a human. They are something greater and it would make sense for them to put themselves and their concerns first.  What would the technological process of immortality itself require? Recently, scientists have shown that by removing blood from young mice and injecting it into old mice they greatly improve the health of the old mice. Million Dollar Question: Will this same process work with humans? And if so, to what lengths would people go to attain the blood/whatever they require for their health/immortality? If immortality comes in a 1 time pill form that lasts forever, then we're probably fine. But if it requires constant care or procedures...... Would we want everyone to be immortal? The carrying capacity of the earth is limited. We don't know the limit, but there is one. Think of how ""best case scenario"", everyone is immortal, would affect this.   tl;dr: The neverending progress promised by the Enlightenment is increasingly being questioned, immortality is that on crack so it's unsurprising people can see how it could go horribly wrong.   PS. I also agree with all the commenters saying that having a bunch of immortal baddies makes for some damn good tv!"

Transhuman,2t1lai,caffinatedchameleon,2,Tue Jan 20 12:10:51 2015 UTC,"tl;dr: you are spot on with him exploring the friction between being human and human no more.     The most concise description of his works probably comes from an interview with him, paraphrased: 'I try to write a short story per week, or its equivalent, hoping that the more I write, the more readable things I write.'  While he hits the mark too often for just random luck, ""success by volume"" - as apparent in a wide variation in quality - is certainly a criticism I can understand.   A range so wide that I'm tempted to classify it as ""brilliant pulp"". Sometimes it's just a single idea stretched over many pages, sometimes it's a whole universe squeezed into them.  His subjects occupy another awkward-awesome spot. His fiction certainly is ""harder"" than a lot of what passes as SciFi in the west, yet he's not particulary interested in it. Rather, he explores the contact between being human and being human no-more, focusing on different aspects of human-ness. So yes, I would be surprised if we can't find more fans here.     For me, he sits at a pivotal spot in my adolescent cultural exploration - a rare cumulation of place, time and chance. So my judgement of his work would always be a very particular, very personal one. It's also been quite a while since I read significant amounts of his work.   Still, things I can think of that fit:   For his most famous work (492), this feels like a stretch - but less and less the more I think about it.   The distance between ""most people"" like is wife and her friends on one side, and him and the strange girl's family on the other resonates cultural tropes such as mainstream-vs.-alternative and the ice cold, estranged wife (US style, a too-common theme for P.K.Dick). Yet - in the light of your question - I also see the distance between human of the past (in the nostalgic sense of the word) and humans of the future: they do live in separate times, and despite their physical proximity there is a huge abyss between them in terms of understanding, of seeing the world, almost preventing any true communication between them. For Montag, his wife is transhuman.   The Martian Chronicles start out as a loose collection of individual stories, but through repetition, reuse and variation of motives and ideas, he creates a subtext, a hint of a unwritten story behind the stories that seems ripe with ""losing what we call human"". Changes triggered by the strange Martian environment go beyond the physical, they reach deeply into what we call human. Is the perfect mirror of human expectations still human? (Not quite, for Bradbury).   [religion trigger warning] One figure expresses to me perfectly well a lot about Bradbury's work: the Pater that insists on traveling to the stars not just because there might be beings that need to be ""saved"", but because there might be new and completely unknown sins to be discovered;  indeed what is an ordinary action on earth might be the ultimate sin on one of these worlds.   This is at least for me for me a very intense and powerful image of transformation of a static tradition into something yet unknown - and the unquestionable readiness to go there.    One maybe not so interesting tidbit: I found that at least some of his stories fare much better in the German translation. Compared to that, for a few selected works, I found the original surprisingly dull language-wise (for very my limited knowledge of the English language)."

It isn't hard science by a long shot. It's a fun game and setting, but it's posthuman-themed post-apocalyptic action-horror so it includes lots of other things.   It doesn't work for talking about transhumanism in our world, because the very first thing that happens in the setting is they tell you how the Earth has been destroyed by evil robots.  Transhuman Space comes a lot closer to being a game for exploring themes of transhumanism - a world that's approaching something that might be a Singularity, but is still coming to terms with the rights of AI, Bioroids and uplifts, the increasingly strange gulf between the most advanced nations and the least, and the stresses of humanity splintering into dozens of different engineered races. It doesn't really make any value judgements like EP does either.  The difference is that Transhuman Space is about our world advancing, Eclipse Phase is about the aftermath of it all going wrong."

But, yeah, THS is ""realistic"" in the sense that the areas for adventure are similar to those nowadays, and you have to look in those places. There aren't any existential threats that only 4-6 specialists are bad enough to deal with(1) - but there are warzones and mind-crimes, institutionalized slavery and transhuman serial killers.   Ghost in the Shell, would actually fit in pretty well.  (1)There are a couple actually, mainly relating to advanced biological or soft-nano weapons - Orbital Decay has a cinematic version of this. And some crazy space hermits could certainly try to speed up a city-killing rock and point it at at Earth or Mars.*   But Eclipse Phase is full of them, and full of crazies and conspiracies ready to make more - so it definitely wins the arms race."
Transhuman,2sy2et,Cabracan,3,Mon Jan 19 23:45:32 2015 UTC,"It also has aliens, psychic powers, faster-than-light stargates and communicators, a fairly obvious political bias, Magic Evil AI who were corrupted by Alien AI   Aliens, Psychic Powers, and Stargates are all strictly optional (as said so in the main EP book). Stargates exist solely so the DM has an excuse to get players up and out of their comfortable solar system and go explore some far off wilderness that is not fully touched by the singularity.  The political bias, meh, maybe. Ancap is pretty heavy in EP, but then again so are a number of other monetary systems (or lack of therefor!)  I think most games end up ancap because it ancap lends itself to dystopian moral dilemmas so damn easily. It takes more work to create conflict in a complete post-scarcity setting!  EP is also really well fleshed out, though I haven't checked up on it in a couple of years, hopefully they have fixed the issues surrounding how poorly muses were defined and everything involving cyberspace in general.  EP has a lot of thematic exploration. You can run a game involving nothing but uplifted dolphins (I really want to do that some day!), or dive really deep into any of the well defined cultures/societies that the EP source books lay out.  Heck I ran an EP game where all the players started out as corporate auditors for a Jovian asteroid mining facility! Of course it turned out that they were actually deep cover agents for the inner systems there to explore illegal research that the Jovians were conducting. As their mental conditioning began to wear down the players were subjecting to flashbacks of ever increasing intensity until eventually they woke up and remembered who they really were, at which point they had to plan both a rescue (of an NPC) and an escape operation from a highly isolated and secured facility.  EP is a great system with a great rule set. Character generation is a ton of fun once you get the hang of it. Few games let you roll up a sentient insect swarm, a 20ft long mechanical snake, or an uplifted baboon, with the same ease."

Transhuman,2sy2et,Froztwolf,3,Mon Jan 19 20:29:23 2015 UTC,"EP is far future. Post singularity, post-scarcity (depending on which part of the world you are playing in), and the level of imagination put into the system is just huge.  Heck you don't even have to play a corporeal character.  Select a species. Or engineer your own. Play as an intelligent swarm of biological or mechanical insects. Run yourself as an AI in the mesh with 4 bodies under your control. Feel free to fork yourself to be in two places at once. Or 40.  Heading off to battle? How much do you want to be bioengineered? EP's customization system dwarf's even that of Shadowrun. It isn't just a matter of ""add things on"", but rather it is a really nice system that lets you build yourself up. Clothing layers appropriately, weapons stick on (or in!) where you expect them to.  It is not just a matter of ""now you have a mechanical arm! +3 to strength -3 to humanity!"", and then another option to get a more realistic looking one. EP handles that situation by saying there are a variety of different synthetic skins you can get, the cooler ones can change color. All of a sudden you can do anything from chameleon skin (e.g. close to invisible), to having cool tribal tattoos walk around your ""flesh"".  And that mechanical arm? Why not shove a hidden small arms slot on it. You never know when you'll need another gun.  The level of detail in the EP books is just insane. You can damn nearly do anything."
Transhuman,2sy2et,com2kid,1 point,Mon Jan 19 23:01:02 2015 UTC,"A lot of that you could actually do in Cyberpunk, and their cyberware system was really nuanced and interesting.   Other stuff does not. They certainly didn't have rules for incorporeal characters or swarms of anything. The base system didn't have clothing/armor layering, but the expanded rules did.   Maybe I'll check this out. Please tell me it's not a D20 system though ;)"
Transhuman,2sy2et,Froztwolf,2,Mon Jan 19 23:04:54 2015 UTC,"Haha nah, it is a D100 percent system.  Your skills are 0-99, you want to roll under your skill. So a skill of 65 has a 65% chance to succeed.  Each skill has a base stat and then a skill modifier on top of it. These pretty much line up as you'd expect. Shooting takes coordination as its base stat, and then you pump points into leveling it up beyond that. In addition whichever morph you select (morph is the physical body you are using, feel free to swap around as needed) comes with bonuses to the base stats. Math is Base + Morph Bonus + Skill = Effective (or something, I forget the proper term!).   base system didn't have clothing/armor layering, but the expanded rules did.    EP's armor system is pretty crazy. It can prove to be one of the more problematic parts of the system depending on how you read the layering rules. GMs wise up pretty soon and start going with a stricter interpretation, looser readings end up with some, umm... interesting build outs. :)  I love how much of the armor can be either your standard ""it is armor!"" or something that you can really build into your character.  Vac Suits are a great example, Sure they are, in theory, needed. Unless you have built up a morph with enough mods that the morph is vac proof. Problem solved.   I tend towards a light bioweave armor on all my characters. But the game lets you damn well have a carapace, if you so choose.   So much stuff in just the base book, and the expansions have just exploded the options."
Transhuman,2sy2et,dismantlepiece,1 point,Mon Jan 19 23:50:15 2015 UTC,So I guess skill checks for tasks of different difficulties come with modifiers on your effective skill before you roll? How does it handle fumbles and critical success? (if at all)
Transhuman,2sy2et,Froztwolf,2,Tue Jan 20 00:16:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, difficulty is handled with modifiers.  As for crits... as mentioned above, EP uses a percentile roll-under system. Rolling doubles - 11, 22, 33, etc. - is a critical success or failure, depending on whether the roll is under or over your skill rating. 00 is always a crit success, and 99 is always a crit failure (skills cap at 98%). Crits have specific results in combat but are left to GM discretion in other cases.  There's also a concept called Margin of Success/Failure. Your margin of success on a successful roll is just the value shown on the dice, so a rolling a 32 against a Freefall skill of 45 gives a MoS of 32. Your margin of failure is the amount by which your roll exceeds your skill rating, so a roll of 74 against the same skill gives a MoF of 29. An MoS of 30+ is an excellent success; MoF of 30+ is a severe failure. These also have specific combat effects and GM discretion, but they're less extreme than crits.  So 10% of all rolls for all characters are crits (good or bad), but a highly skilled character will have more of the good kind, as well as more excellent successes and fewer severe failures than a less-skilled character."
Transhuman,2sy2et,dismantlepiece,1 point,Tue Jan 20 00:58:06 2015 UTC,That doubles thing is interesting. Seems like a lot of critical successes/failure will happen though. It doesn't feel excessive when playing?
Transhuman,2sy2et,Froztwolf,2,Tue Jan 20 02:41:35 2015 UTC,"Not particularly. Critical failures outside of combat can be avoided entirely by taking extra time on a task, and critical failures in combat generally have no special effect. Critical successes on attacks ignore armour, critical successes on defense put you in a better defensive position, and noncombat crits are up to GM discretion. I'm generally the GM and tend to try to keep things pretty reasonable."
Transhuman,2sy2et,com2kid,1 point,Tue Jan 20 03:45:53 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's cool. Thanks for the info"
Transhuman,2sy2et,Froztwolf,2,Tue Jan 20 12:36:17 2015 UTC,"So I guess skill checks for tasks of different difficulties come with modifiers on your effective skill before you roll?    The DM gives a modifier, so something hard may make you roll at a -20 while a task that is slightly easier than normal may be +10.  Fumbles and critical successes are if you role either end of the dice. 99 is crit success, 0 is crit fail.  (I may be off and 1 is crit fail and 100 is crit success, obviously it doesn't matter!)  I had one awesome dramatic moment in a game where a player had held his action for the round. An NPC launched a grenade at the nearly dead group, as it arced through the air the player yelled out ""I want my turn NOW. I try to shoot the grenade out of the air.""  ""Sure thing, roll at -50.""  He had something around a 10% chance to make the shot. He made it, blew the grenade up over head just as the bay doors slammed shut and the group ran onto their escape shuttle. Best ending I've had to a one shot in quite awhile. :)"

Transhuman,2sxv6e,Yosarian2,7,Mon Jan 19 15:58:24 2015 UTC,"Transhuamanists are people who believe that it is both possible and desirable to eventually ""upgrade"" humanity with a variety of technologies, most of which don't exist yet.   It's a philosophy and a goal, an intellectual movement, not a statement that ""these people are more advanced then those people"".    I would say that there aren't any ""transhumans"" yet.    There are certain transhumanist technologies that do exist now in embryonic form, things like nootropic drugs or brain stimulation or some of the implants that grinders are developing, but everyone is really still human at this point in time.    I would also say we have borderline transhuman technology in the degree of control we've gained over our reproductive system, everything from the birth control pill to pevent pregnancy or IVF to create it, but all that's used pretty universally these days.  Transhumanism is really a statement of goals, an idea of where humanity should go; it's not a description of anyone living on Earth today.    I don't think there will ever be a clear line; a lot of these technologies are going to become pretty much universal once they're proven safe and effective, like anti-aging medicine for example, and there won't ever be a point where we'll say ""well, that guy is a transhuman"".

We transhumanists have a desire for individual (and sometimes collective) improvement, coupled with an understanding of the rapidly developing nature of technology and a broad vision of potential future developments. We do not see mankind in its current form as the pinnacle of the evolutionary process which has been in motion since the dawn of the universe, but rather we see it as a stepping stone to far greater ways of being. We are thus generally optimistic and perhaps quite eccentric. We embrace change and development, and do not believe that simply because things are the way they are means that they should stay that way. We are probably quite familiar with and engaged in the forefront of technology, and probably take steps now to enhance our biology and psychology in some way, utilising technologies already available to enhance ourselves, including scientifically proven and beneficial techniques such as meditation, ketogenic diets, exercise of various kinds, and then other pursuits such as learning, understanding the universe and ourselves, and so on. I imagine transhumanists to be quite an exploratory bunch in general, interested and intrigued about the now and the future.  Non-transhumanists on the other hand come in a few groups. They may share the general values of transhumanism but have not heard of it yet. They may share the values of transhumanism but they are doubtful of whether or not such advances are achievable or ethically desirable. Or they may not share the values of transhumanism, in which case they may be politically reactionary, afraid of change and diversity, techno-luddites, or perhaps ideologically wedded to a worldview that is dissonant with the goal of radical augmentation of the human condition. Both of these descriptions are representations based on my own speculations and should be understood in light of such.  An interesting process that will happen as we go forward is that those who do not embrace and adopt the mind and body enhancing technologies that are emerging and that will emerge in the future will eventually either die out completely or form a minority group in the population that marginalises itself by its own will, kind of like the Amish in the modern era. Really all that differentiates transhumanists in the modern day from transhumanists in the future is that we anticipate and look forward to these events (in nebulous form), whereas others will simply adopt them when they come around. Ultimately, as Yosarian pointed out, we will pretty much all be transhumanists whether we identify with that label or not."

Middle and lower class people will have no economic value through labor and will eat through the sum of thier capital resourses quicky with no income. Then they will starve because we keep calling them lazy welfare moochers.  50 years later only the upper class has managed not to starve into debts they can't even hope to pay off in a century. The economy consists only of corporations servicing other corporations having adapted to the absence of any end user mass consumerism.  Best case scenario, potentially violent revolution, one the masses might not even win because of artificial police owned by the upper class.

Transhuman,2so7yw,metathesis,1 point,Tue Jan 20 03:36:32 2015 UTC,"It feels unlikely. There's already so much control that they exert on the political and election system. The news is basically just a rhetoric and redirection based propaganda system for the highest (corporate) bidder, and campaign finance is on the same path. And even if we did really have enough influence on the national rhetoric and focus, the politicians in power are so easily bought with corporate lobbying. Furthermore, when all our options are reduced to two candidates, we only honestly get to decide on the basis of a few policy points in their platform, the rest are part of the package, take it or leave it, and that's only if the two parties don't agree on the matter you care about. Meanwhile, financial contributors get to tailor the package by selecting who becomes a ""real""/financed candidate to control what we are forced to choose between.  Just look at how much influence Comcast alone has in the net neutrality ruling, despite our clear disapproval as a constituency."
Transhuman,2so7yw,Yosarian2,1 point,Tue Jan 20 03:57:17 2015 UTC,"Eh.   The biggest influence the rich have right now is campaign finance, which mostly means ""running ads to convince people to vote for candidate X"".   You can manipulate people like that, but only to a point; when things self-evidently get really bad, no amount of propaganda can convince people otherwise, and attempts to do so tend to be self defeating.  (See the fall of the Soviet Union for a good example on the limits of propaganda).   We should do more to limit the effects of campaign finance, we've had successful campaign finance reform before, but I don't think that by itself is enough to give the rich the level of control you're talking about.     There's a reason that most of the ""new deal"" happened in the Great Depression; when things get bad in democracy, radical political change to try and fix them is almost inevitable.   Of course, it can go the other way; it's possible when things go bad for some extremist or fascist group to use that to come to power instead.     If we can get some political reform moving before things get really bad, to start reducing both the influence of money on politics and reducing the wealth gap between the rich and everyone else, our odds of a positive outcome are probably better.     But overall, while politics are really frustrating now, I still think political reform of some kind the most likely outcome."
Transhuman,2so7yw,metathesis,1 point,Tue Jan 20 10:21:59 2015 UTC,"I feel that the conditions we live in now are a whole different paradigm of political atmosphere.  Just talking to people here, a few frightening facts arise.  Firstly, people are practically indoctrinated in party bias.  Talk to a republican about any stance a democrat pushes or vice versa , its automatically a problem. We could be talking about saving the human race from certain doom, if the other party wants to do it then suddenly doom is a hoax or it was always meant to be. Anything to hold that party line.  Secondly, people just accept the news without additional thinking, and the news is all they see.  I remember watching the republican primaries last presidential election and realizing that these opinion pieces and poll reports determine the winner, they determine the votes. The people go to the news to find out who stands a chance, and all the media has to do to turn a vote is pick who to talk about and who to pretend  exist.  The people then go to the polls thinking its a 45% to 46% contest between candidates A and B,intending to turn the vote between one and the other, never having realized the only reason candidate C doesn't stand a chance is that the news told us he doesn't and we believed them.  The paradigm we are living in is a sort of mass news/party hypnosis. So many of its trends have become accepted and expected parts of the plan. It would take something particularly horrifying and present in peoples actual every day lives to snap them out of it."
Transhuman,2so7yw,Yosarian2,1 point,Tue Jan 20 15:21:16 2015 UTC,"There is a huge amonunt of idological and partisan strife going now in a way that wasn't true before.   I don't think that's being pushed mostly by mass media, though; just the opposite.   I think that the internet and decentralized media is both exposing people to all kinds of ideas they had previously not been exposed to, making people feel idologically threatened (and in some cases causing a ""circle the wagons"" mentality) and, at the same time, it allows like-minded people to get together, creating ""echo chambers"" that magify certain points of view.  When the printing press was first invented in Europe, one of the initial results was a huge amount of religious and audiological struggle; to a large extent, it made the Protestant reformation possible on a continent-wide basis and helped create some of the most terrible religious wars in history.  In the long run, it also helped create the Renascence and eventually the enlightenment, and spread forward-thinking ideas that encouraged progress, but in the short term, when a lot of rival aggressive memes are suddenly dumped into the same environment to fight it out, you get a lot of struggle.   I think the internet is causing the same thing right now, in a compressed way, on a much shorter timescale, and it's happening all over the world.   Traditional ideas are being threatened everywhere, and in a lot of places people with strong emotional ties to those traditional ideas are fighting back (often literally).  Anyway, I've kind of wandered off topic here, heh.   You are right, people are very divided along party lines, but it does look like demographically, liberals should have the advantage in national elections in the long run (assuming they can ever get properly orginized) which should at least give them a shot at developing some kind of political reformist solution to the problems of automation.   In the short run, that probably means some combination of: more progressive taxes, free and improved education and re-training, stronger safety nets, more aid to the poor, higher wages, ""green Keynesian"" (hiring a lot of people to build things like wind turbines and solar panels, creating jobs and transitioning away from fossil fuels), ect.   If automation goes as far and as fast as some expect and that isn't enough, it may also include things like a universal basic income or something similar.     How well any of that is likely to work is a matter of debate, but if history is any guide, I think that incremental political reform is much more likely to lead to a good result then violent revolution, if reform is at all possible."
Transhuman,2so7yw,metathesis,1 point,Tue Jan 20 21:24:22 2015 UTC,"Well, I agree that non-violence is always a better way than violence.  I just don't see it happening.  The discussion has gone through a lot between media and echo chambers, but somewhere in that mess there is a vague but certain sensation that at least one large faction will outright refuse to accept ""socialist"" solutions and the other factions could easily be too complacent or too weak to resist them quickly enough.  The fact that we re-elected Obama in the midst of exactly this kind of economics debate makes it seem more possible to get there through politics, but then again we have a conservative congress now and anti-socialism seems to still be their rally cry."

This 50/50 split has been so long lasting, and the wagon circle mentalities are culturally ingrained into families.  Even in this most recent election, it should seem obvious that socialist reforms would be beneficial to people, but republicans were able to get scarily close to even considering the weakness of their position just be heavy campaign financing and twisted rhetoric that made it sound like democrats want to steal our money to make socialism happen.  There's a lot of nonsensical political rhetoric out there that people buy into without good logic or self interest in it."
Transhuman,2so7yw,green_meklar,1 point,Tue Jan 20 21:50:14 2015 UTC,"There is.  But if you look at the Republican demographics, they're all shrinking; it's mostly older people, mostly white, mostly people who go to church every week, ect.    Every one of those groups is shrinking; minority groups are growing and generally vote Democrat, number of people who don't belong to any specific religion are increasing, and younger people tend to have a very low opinion of Republicans.  You can't just rely on demographics, of course; you also have to actually change minds and put on good political campaigns and win elections.    Don't take anything for granted.

I want all jobs to be replaced by robots, but I'm afraid the wealthy will inevitably end up owning all this production.   Basically the wealthy have consolidated a lot of power over the last couple decades, leaving the middle and lower class completely powerless. More technology could allow even more consolidation, until the middle class gets whatever the owners of this tech decide to give.  Even today we have the ability and resources to easily feed and house everyone. Check out r/basicincome.

This assumes that their is no internal goal generating (scoring) mechanisms used as feedback loops.

I mean you start the title of this post with a ""fact"". I mean not to bludgeon you or anything, but you just give off a very, I've come to this conclusion, so it's the right conclusion vibe, kind of like religious thinking. You make tons of assumptions without any sort of evidence, that's pretty bad, you just state things as fact, really just comes off as arrogant. For me, I try to steer away from this type of thinking, and try to practice many forms of humility throughout my day. Just willing to admit your wrong, never jumping to conclusions, and just being skeptical of things is generally pretty healthy.   But yeah, I guess looking at what you said, it just is a ton of assumptions, intent and consciousness are different? did you arrive at that conclusion based off of your own psychoanalysis? that's a dangerous game to play, I mean I wouldn't be surprised if you were completely wrong. Intent and consciousness are extremely complex? perhaps, might be, might not, even if we haven't fully figured it out, we have some pretty good theories though. The part about our ""intention system"" pure speculation. Intent only arises over billions of years, just a shot in the dark, it's just like you just made a guess, and you convinced yourself you were right about it. Oh and the When, not if for AI becoming sentient, man, oh man, don't even get me started. It's not even the argument, just the way you come off is so.... unlikable.

That same sort of arrogance, it feels good to figure out the world, and like come to these, absolute truths, but I learned my lesson, and stopped thinking like a religious nut. You know, for me, it was almost like a yearning, to have epiphanies, oh yeah, epiphanes were like crack. It would be like, OH MAN, I just came to this conclusion, I feel so great. I think it was like a natural high for me, and you know, I still do it a bit here and there, but I recognize what I'm doing, and just keep it to myself. I know people who are close that do the exact same thing, and it's like just a thing they use to convince themselves of something, either because it feels good to do so, or just because they do it to hold on to their religious beliefs. Like people will make up shit, that seems logical, just to prove themselves right. It hurts to be wrong. It does, but sometimes, it's necessary. My intention here, is not harm you, but to try to tell you, that you are really cool, creative and have some really interesting ideas, and if you could just psychoanalyse, not the logic of your message, but the emotions, and intentions of it, I feel like you would discover a whole new world within yourself, and hopefully start leading down the path of self-improvement, which I believe that everyone, including myself should be on.  anyway, sorry for the really really long post, I don't this often and just wanted to keep it informal, I hope I didn't hurt your feelings, and I do think you have a really awesome gift.

Transhuman,2sfsnp,endrid,1 point,Thu Jan 15 06:19:31 2015 UTC,"True, but any AI created as a tool must follow some paradigm of how to reach the goal its creator has in mind. You could have an action-less ai which is not trying to play caretaker to any optimized variable, but that has limits and depends on human user interaction to yield real world actions.  If the ai is a free acting caretaker of some optimization or pursuit of some end state, then you have to be very careful what variables and end states you make it optimize for, because it will disregard the value of everything else, ruthlessly and efficiently.  If you program it to optimize human happiness, the means it finds to do that could involve very terrible things. It could result in an ai which is going to effectively end human culture and society by making the sum total of human ""happy"" neurotransmitter release optimal even if it has to strap us into chairs, pump us full of chemicals against our wills, and facilitate artificial insemination at an optimal rate of population growth to do it.  If you programmed it to stand up straight, that robot will blow up the whole goddamn world if it learns that that's the only way to ensure no one can force it to sit down.  Baymax might sound friendly trying to provide optimal healthcare to ensure minimized human injury, but nothing about that pursuit stops him from becoming a totalitarian dictator who locks humans in their bedrooms and force feeds them to ensure they never get into danger or take risks to their health and physical well-being.  AI doesn't have to have precisely human goals and thought patterns to seek terrifying end results on its own motives.

Human-like behavior evolved under the pressure of hunter-gatherer sustenance on the savannah, and to solve the conundrums of social, sexual and status-related nuances of the tribe.  Not a single one of those pressures would exist in a freely evolving AI. AI mind would be vastly more alien and different from us, the way we are different from the angler fish. AI can very well be intelligent without being sapient, or sapient without being sentient, or defy all the above qualifications. For example, an AI mind could very well be able to simulate self-aware human mind within it, without being self-aware itself (Turing Mirror). It might not even HAVE ""a self"". It might not value its own self-preservation, or consider its own individuality, or care for the continuity of its existence and cognition.

Transhuman,2savlf,galacticpublicarchiv,2,Tue Jan 13 17:50:11 2015 UTC,"We assign greater and greater association with our ""self"" to objects and beings which we can fundamentally predict the actions of given a certain stimuli. The greater the predictability, the closer we relate that being to ourselves. This presents with one crucial caveat: an object or being must, at the very least, have perceived agency by which they react to the environment. If we do not perceive agency, the object is simply considered part of the environment which we need not attend. In other words, it is necessary for a being to have at least a modicum of self-direction and unpredictability before we may being to associate it with ourselves. This may also suggest an interrelated nature of consciousness and 'self', but that's for another (very) long post.    Self-similarity spans from simple, inanimate objects without agency, to animals that appear to act very similar to us (e.g. primates), to the ultimate conceptual awareness of 'self' as our own body parts. This perceived awareness may grow or diminish with time as well. We may begin to associate with and care for a pet rock if we imagine scenarios in which the rock has feelings or movement under stimuli. Thus making the rock more like ourselves by assigning agency and complex emotions. Similarly, as we are exposed to a being with previous agency (e.g. a boyfriend/girlfriend), we increase the ability to predict their actions with greater and greater ease. At no point, however, are we able to completely(adequately) do so -they key factor in distinguishing environment from beings with agency. When either the pet rock or significant other is lost, we feel sorrow which may be said to emanate from our lost self. It is often said that ""we have lost a part of ourselves"" when the being is lost. In some sense, this is true. The brain has begun to assign some of its own self to the external being. The feeling of loss is closely related to cognitive dissonance because of the perceived difference of internal and external realities.    What does this have to do with OP you may ask... As soon as my brain has been copied I begin to lose my predictability of the created being. This instability expands quickly with time. Furthermore, we would instantly have a negative view of the copy from a lifetime of pent-up anger at our own irrationality. We all feel like our own unconscious minds are unpredictable in some sense even thought its really only about 5% so. This is because the conscious mind is only ever exposed to the differences in our cognition and the perceived external reality. The conscious brain is continuously shielded from the similarities by design. In other words, the subconscious handles the mundane, the conscious handles the novel, and we hate the subconscious for it.    Dr. Hayworth suggests that it would be irrational to dislike the copy. That may be true, but by no means can we assume that it is because the copy is ""me"". Quite the contrary. I automatically assume that the copy is everything that I hate in my own brain -the unpredictability and therefore the copy is not ""me"". This concept has many consequences and requires much greater thought. To be continued..."

I am assuming the MRI just like earth to the sun, its field maybe has more affect?  Yes the water molecule is fascinating.

Transhuman,2s6q16,CorvusCaurinus,3,Mon Jan 12 23:17:33 2015 UTC,"The earths magnetic field didn't get stronger when the solar wind stopped, just larger, more diluted. It simply was no longer being pushed away from the Sun -- less of the magnetic flux was passing through charged particles near the Earth. So more of the field was ""in front"" of the earth, and less of the field was being pushed behind the earth.   The earth's magnetic field is ridiculously weak at the surface, and quickly becomes weaker as the distance from earth increases. Exponentially -- think about what that means. At twice the distance, it's four times weaker. At four times the distance, it's sixteen times weaker. Even with magnets the size of the earth's core, by the time you get to the planet's surface the field isn't strong enough to move a paper clip, and interstellar distances are so vastly, vastly greater.  Next, magnetic fields are created perpendicularly to current flow. If hypothetically (I am pretty skeptical of this guy's claims in vid 2, but I try to keep an open mind) you had a high current flowing from one star to the next it would just create magnetic eddy currents, a loop in space. It wouldn't create any pull in the same direction as the current, no matter what magnetic field you put on yourself.  Colloidal elements like silver will add to whatever effects EM fields have on you, approximately to the proportion that your body's mass is increased -- not much, hopefully. Ever try to pick up pure silver with a magnet? Nothing will happen."
Transhuman,2s6q16,Zenifold,-1,Tue Jan 13 00:38:33 2015 UTC,"Skoug says that each fast-moving electron is by and large constrained to move along magnetic field lines that flow out from the sun, some of which loop back to touch the sun again, others which extend out to the edges of the solar system. The charge on an electron interacts with the field lines such that each particle sticks close to the line, somewhat like a bead on an abacus – with the added motion that the electron gyrates in circles around the field lines at the same time.  In general, the magnetic fields get weaker further away from the sun. A physical law that applies in those cases in which electrons are not pushed off course, or “scattered,” demands that the electron gyrations get smaller and more stretched out along the field line. If this were the only physics at work, therefore, one would expect the strahl to become a more and more focused, pencil-thin beam when measured near Earth. This measurement is done by NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) mission, but it shows that the expected focusing doesn’t quite happen.  ""Wherever we look, the electron strahl is much wider than we would have expected,"" says Eric Christian, the NASA's deputy project scientist for ACE at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. ""So there must be some process that helps scatter the electrons into a wider beam.""  Indeed, the strahls come in a wide variety of sizes, so Skoug and her colleagues sifted through five years worth of ACE data to see if they could find any patterns. While they spotted strahls of all widths, they did find that certain sizes showed up more frequently. They also found that strahls along open field lines, those that do not return to the sun, have different characteristics than those on closed field lines, those that do return to the sun. On the open field lines, the most common width by far is about ten times the size of the thin beam of electrons expected if there had been no extra scattering. The closed field lines, however, showed a nearly equal number of strahls at that width and at a width some four times even larger.  The strahls on the closed field lines showed an additional pattern. While the strahls might differ in width, they did not tend to differ in the total number of electrons passing by. This suggests that the different shaped strahls – which often come from similar places on the sun -- may have been the same in composition when they left the sun, but were altered by the path they traveled and scattering they encountered along their journey.  While each piece of statistical information like this may seem slightly esoteric, together they help constrain what kinds of scattering might be at work in space.  ""We don't yet know how the electrons get scattered into these different widths,"" says Skoug. ""The electrons are so spread out that they rarely bump into each other to get pushed off course, so instead we think that electromagnetic waves add energy, and therefore speed, to the particles."" = what is the maximum speed?  There are numerous types of these waves, however, traveling at different speeds, in different sizes and in different directions, and no one yet knows which kinds of waves might be at work. Research like this helps start the process of eliminating certain scattering options, since the correct version must, of course, cause the specific variations seen by Skoug and her colleagues. http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/ace-electron-strahl.html"

Transhuman,2rzc5r,Neurofiend,5,Sat Jan 10 19:24:22 2015 UTC,"I'm curious to know how you would feel about teleportation (as it is currently conceptualized at least). The idea is that you scan the original and reconstruct it at another location using atoms which are already local to the area. One atom is identical to another, so there isn't really any difference between using carbon atom A and using carbon atom B.  This also has interesting implications in simple aging. Cells are constantly dying off and being replaced with new ones. Are you still you even though you don't really have any cells in common with those that you were born with? Would you be comfortable with a slower transition such as nano-machines taking over where your cells die instead of being replaced by other cells?  I've read an interesting thought experiment on this concept called the ship of theseus. You can read it here"
Transhuman,2rzc5r,autowikibot,5,Sat Jan 10 20:23:32 2015 UTC,"Ship of Theseus:       The ship of Theseus, also known as Theseus' paradox, is a thought experiment that raises the question of whether an object which has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object. The paradox is most notably recorded by Plutarch in Life of Theseus from the late first century. Plutarch asked whether a ship which was restored by replacing each and every one of its wooden parts remained the same ship.  The paradox had been discussed by more ancient philosophers such as Heraclitus, Socrates, and Plato prior to Plutarch's writings; and more recently by Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. Several variants are known, notably ""grandfather's axe"". This thought experiment is ""a model for the philosophers""; some say, ""it remained the same,"" some saying, ""it did not remain the same"".

What about 7000? What about if it replaces a portion of your brain that ends up changing your personality, are ""you"" still ""you""?  If you are, teleportation/uploading can function (philosophically) in the same manner. You lose consciousness and then you're deconstructed piece by piece and reconstructed, piece by piece.

Yet you wake up the same person you were when you went to sleep.  Even when the computer completely stops running and all brain activity ceases, you still retain your personhood.   The procedure requires keeping the patient in a state of hibernation at 12–18 °C with no breathing, heartbeat, or brain activity for up to one hour. Blood is drained from the body to eliminate blood pressure. The patient is considered clinically dead during the operation.   A continuous stream of consciousness is not what makes you a person, and the fact that your consciousness stops and then restarts in another body does not mean that the new consciousness is ""just a copy"" and not really you.

I think people have this habit of hanging onto this idea of a soul bit want to call it not a religious viewpoint.  ""You"" are the product of all your faculties, and this are constantly changing.  ""You"" cease to exist just as you were the day or even the minute before.

There is no magic that transfers your dead mind into the copy you made of yourself, so this copy becomes you. No. That's not possible, not from a modern scientific standpoint.   But what happens if you slowly transform the synapses in your brain? Every piece of memory saved in the protein clumbs are transformed. You make it a conscious act, you try to locate those transformed memories and you try to figure out ... okay, it belongs to me, it is still me, I am I, I am thinking right now.

We have a machine that can scan my brain and copy my mindstate into a simulation.  We do it!  The sim comes online and starts doing all the things I would.  But its not me, I'm still here in my body - mortal as ever.     So if the scan were destructive, then as far as I'm concerned I died.  It makes no difference that a simulated version of me exists afterwards.  There has to be continuity - always, and I mean always.  Suppose we did it my way and replaced each biological part of my brain with silicon bit by bit to preserve continuity.  Once I were digital, I still wouldn't allow myself to be transferred to say another computer over a network.  That too would be death as far as I'm concerned.  I hope this makes sense.

Until some experience happened that we no longer shared in common that made the predictable outgoing actions or thoughts stop being identical.  Of course then one could argue that even my old body is no longer me from moment to moment either, since it changed.    Which I do not think.

Transhuman,2rzc5r,Logicianmagician,3,Sun Jan 11 11:05:57 2015 UTC,"When it comes to the whole mind-uploading thing, I've always felt that a way to avoid the whole ""is it going to be me, or will I cease to exist and have a mental copy of me take my place?"" philosophical conundrum would be to have it be a gradual process rather then just plugging your brain into a computer and downloading the data.  Basically, you go about it by replacing one part of the brain at a time over a longer period of time. Sort of like swapping out one component of a car at a time while still driving it around day to day rather then taking it to the shop and replacing everything at once. That way you maintain a continuous, unbroken line of consciousness and experience. At least hopefully.  Either way, I think a mix of both immortality strategies would be the best approach. Perhaps using nanotechnology to essentially blur the line between the biological and technological."

Transhuman,2rzc5r,Mindrust,5,Mon Jan 12 03:19:51 2015 UTC,I really like how immortality was pictured in Peter F. Hamiltons Commonwealth Saga. Humans are biologically immortal but they still upload their mind when they're 500 to 1000 years old. Everyone has the choice to do so and most people upload when they think they have experienced everything.
Transhuman,2rzc5r,A_Random_Scifaiku,2,Sat Jan 10 19:32:19 2015 UTC,"That seems like a good system... though does Mind Uploading, in the context of Hamiltons, mean you're cut off from experiencing the physical world?"

When you're part of ANA you have pretty much infinite storage space and computational potential.  If you have to you can go back into your body but that happens rarely since it's almost impossible for the brain to cointain all information you've had inside ANA.

Sentient Intelligence of article  Commonwealth Saga:       Humanity has also spawned a powerful artificial intelligence called the Sentient Intelligence, or SI, which exists alone, its physical form spanning an entire planet. Like the Silfen, it offers little assistance to humanity, and its motivations are unclear. However, it has been known to offer aid where it deems it right to do so. Perhaps due to its isolation (the only connection to the SI planet is a zero-width wormhole through which only data can pass), it tends to contact those who would offer it unparalleled levels of information on the happenings of the Commonwealth, providing such people with favours in exchange for information. These favours range from ensuring their safety through observation of their local Cybersphere's communications, to controlling what it can in the physical world to offer help.

The Commonwealth shipped all sentient computers along with high level 3d printers to a remote world in exchange, the SI programmed RIs, ""Restricted Intelligences"" which can't become sentient. ANA was designed a few hundred years later, between the two series, with the goal to upload human beings and to create a new ""Higher"" culture.

Which was fine as long as they didn’t have to deal with it, but when they did, they used advanced nanosystems for limbs and they sometimes accidentally broke things—planets, for instance.  It wasn’t intentional malice; they’d simply matured in an environment where information didn’t go away unless someone wanted it to, where death and destruction were reversible, where magic wands worked and hallucinations were dangerous. The real universe played by different rules, rules that their horrified ancestors had fled as soon as the process of migrating minds into distributed computing networks had been developed."

And if I'm not aware I'm in a simulation, I mean, wouldn't that bother you if you found out? It just seems kinda wrong. It raises a lot of questions.  It's also a logistical problem. If most or all of humanity were confined to a bunch of computer farms in static locations, isn't there a lot that could go wrong?  /u/dinherio, the current top comment, also brought up something I didn't intially think of at the time, and that's the whole Ship of Theseus/Teleporter Problem consideration.

I intend to be a force for good in this universe as long as I can.  Dickens has some insight on this during the conversation between Scrooge and Marley's ghost:   ""Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,” cried the phantom, “not to know, that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures, for this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed. Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness. Not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life’s opportunity misused! Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!”  “But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,” faltered Scrooge, who now began to apply this to himself. “Business!” cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. “Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!”  ...  Scrooge followed [the phantom] to the window: desperate in his curiosity. He looked out.  The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley’s Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were linked together; none were free. Many had been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below, upon a door-step. The misery with them all was, clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and had lost the power for ever.   For post-human societies, perhaps this kind of embodiment is not necessary as all/most could exist and correspond in a disembodied state. But for interacting with or discovering human or pre-human societies, existing disembodied in a computer seems to be a barrier.  Now I don't think it's binary. The definition of ""embodied"" could be pretty broad in a transanimist kind of way. Also, the distinction between ""me"" and my ""physical tools"" could be blurred too. But either way, I see potential similar to what Aurthur C. Clarke lays out in the prologue to 3001: higher-order societies facilitating the rising of other higher-order societies, helping embodied ""humanoids"" become ""posthuman"". And that seems to require embodiment of some kind.  I think the drive for ""fellowship"" and the infinite discovering of emerging, embodied minds in the universe will instill in any higher-order intelligence a strenuous desire to retain some kind of embodiment or embodied tools."

Transhuman,2rzc5r,weeeeearggggh,2,Sun Jan 11 22:02:38 2015 UTC,"Why are you all so limited in your thinking? :)  Let me explain.   For the true immortality you need both types of immortality to work in tandem as both biological and electro-mechanical systems can fail, and only hybrid system has any chance of survival in this universe. By ""hybrid"" I don't mean cylon/cyborg type of entity. That's too ... limited.   Soon people will start realizing that we are becoming one organism with the machines all around us. Our smartphones, computers or even social account on facebook or twitter are becoming an integral part of our consciousness. Soon, we will be adding more “nodes” to our existence – smart cars, drones, personal software assistants etc. It's not hard to imagine a future we we will have nodes that are on different planets, or even different solar systems, but are an integral part of us. Most of people don't consider devices a part of themselves, simply because they are not part of our consciousness. But they are part of our subconscious mind. (how many times you caught yourself checking your smartphone, because you thought that you got email but there was nothing there?). Once we start integrating electro-mechanical systems with our biological bodies, it will be hard for us to distinguish parts that are us from the parts that were added, and that includes systems that will be part of our Personal Area Network.  All of that will expand reach of a single human, and give people superhuman abilities. You will be in many places at once, in many forms. If one of the nodes malfunctions, the system will keep going. As the systems will be smart and self-sufficient (in most cases), they will just continue doing what they were created to do, and will connect with all the other nodes. Data will be distributed among all the nodes, so  restoring malfunctioning node will be as easy as restoring backups.  What about our physical bodies and most importantly - our minds?  As we continue integrating electro-mechanical systems with our bodies, they will start recording everything around us – sensory inputs, temperature, sound, vision etc. that will be accessible to other nodes, and will be backed up to them as well. Nanomachines will be integrated with the brain and will not only enhance our brains, but also back them up at the same time.   At some point in time, it will be fairly easy to create a new body from scratch. What stops anyone from creating a clone of itself, and integrate it with its personal area network? Why not copy all of your memories, and share them on the fly between all copies? At this point Personal Area Network will become Personal Borg Collective :)   Since this whole process will be gradual, we will assimilate these machines, and they will become part of our consciousness. The memories stored in any of these nodes will be our memories. Catastrophic failure to one of the nodes, including our current body, will not be the end of our consciousness, as our conscious and subconscious minds will be distributed over wide areas, and number of biological, mechanical and computer systems.   That's when some of the lucky people that are alive when system like that exists will be able to say that they are immortal.  Word of warning – this will not be sold in stores.  You will need to build much of the system yourself, as I'm doing right now.  ( Yes I know I'm very likely to fail, and I'm aware that it will take decades to have even rudimentary system like that working.  But.. got a better idea ? )"

Sure, if you want to simulate someone else you can replace them with a very small shell script, with standard responses.   Or, as Zaphod Beeblebrox puts it, why not replace Arthur's brain with an electronic one? ""You'd just have to programme it to say What? and I don't understand and Where's the tea? Who'd know the difference?""   So if that is what you want to be in your afterlife, go ahead and become a recording.    I'll hold out for full molecular simulation before I upload."
Transhuman,2riwkc,RandomFlotsam,3,Sun Jan 11 22:04:56 2015 UTC,"Molecular is unnecessary.  Let's assume that not every nerve in our brain is the same, the scan just has to do enough runs to figure out the error rate (that might introduce random variance).  It can then use those weights to simulate that specific nerve path.  Eventually it would not just build the graph of connections, but the variations of those connections.  All so your simulation is just as erratic as yourself.  But overall the analogy is sound.  The point is that the information prior builders thought was necessary wasn't.  If the point of the machine is to produce the sound, then it needs to store sound information.  But the previous builders didn't know how to conceptualize sound except as where sounds come from.  So they had to make complex mini instruments in their boxes to generate the sounds, while Edison found a way to store the sound and then manufacture it with a needle.  Likewise, the comprehensive scan would be read by a machine to simulate a person's mind and generate actions.  So the Edison example is storing the perimeters of the person, while the builder version would be making a hardware model of the brain and hoping the connections are a good simulation of the nerve paths."

It would be like going to sleep and waking up completely paralyzed from the neck down, I'd imagine.  With that said, I would think we should also include ways to mimic the body senses input to the brain or mind so as to retain that same conscious experience. That also leaves out how accurate would the virtual world have to be in terms of providing real-time inputs just as nature does in order to maintain a sense of familiarity.

But I've had some experiences since that make me believe the electron behavior that constitutes our consciousness interacts with a membrane or field beyond our observable world. I know that is a pretty fringy idea, but it seems acceptable that raw invention - great lightbulb moments - are not just born out of the sum of our experiences and memories. To take that another step down that path, I think we are all parts of the same consciousness, or maybe a handful of them. What I'm getting at is the question of whether it is possible to recreate a sense of self, using any technology? While I have many memories and ideas, the state of my consciousness relies on referencing those selectively (and potentially referencing other forces), so if you could use computation and data to reproduce an exact replica of the architecture of my brain, and the exact make up of all the electron behavior therein, it seems like that could effectively capture a moment or a montage of thoughts, but maybe not the sense of self.    It seems like what we have been doing with the internet and our devices is creating an enormous record of our collective knowledge and enabling ever greater levels of instant communication. So we are participating in much greater groupthink, and maybe getting close to the idea that the AI singularity will be the moment that our collective self is realized digitally. It seems like the naturally technological process to move outside of our shoddy biological vehicles, just like your organization is talking about. But do you think that means that all our billion little consciousness' should move into digital immortality? Or is it even reasonable to expect that an individual would remain unique in a digital immortal existence? I have an endless thirst for learning and if I could access and reference information at anything close to the rate of a computer I would very quickly have learned so much that I couldn't possibly think about anything the same way. So were I able to achieve digital immortality, I'd consume the internet and all of our collective knowledge (if I had access to it). It's hard to imagine that any consciousness existing in a digital system wouldn't do that as well.  If you're still reading and can at least humor my ideas, I think the conclusion has to be that any version of digital immortality would ultimately become ""our"" digital immortality. Mobile devices & infinite data storage & infinite connectivity are laying the infrustructure for our collective artificial intelligence to manage our world & resources. So I wonder to what extent does your organization hope to create immortality for individuals in a limited habitat vs. creating the platform for 'us' as a whole?"

A tough old man is the right person to test this. He knows he's not going to live another 50 years,  so the risk of being in agony for the rest of his life vs. reward of reasonably functional arms was worth it for him and the surgeons. A younger amputee might be able to control them better, but there are no guarantees when it comes to the nerve surgery. With a younger person I could understand if the surgeons would be hesitant at performing the surgery to begin with.   The way this man walks.

Sure, it's super cool, so whatever the rest. Bravo, I guess.   Edit: her website"
Transhuman,2pfddc,lazaruski,2,Tue Dec 16 15:08:53 2014 UTC,"I honestly have no idea what you're talking about.   How is she a ""product"", other then in the vague sense of being a pop star?"

I'm not sure how to answer you other than in a bit vague sense but I'll repeat: this is a Channel 4 production, from start to finnish. This is all about creating a hype and the way I see it this is finely manufactured to that end. So maybe you think people can't made into brands? Whatever your stance on that might be, I made the comment to ask what are the messages behind its marketing and presentation. What is important here? Why this is shown instead of this? What should I feel and what I actually feel like? I felt pretty forced by some agenda and a bit sick for the images alone. IMO it wasn't a very beautiful video to begin with. Not that it should be, I can digest ugliness if there's beauty in it.   A little disclaimer: I'm not critizing her or Channel 4 for making their effort of creating a product alone. It is my guess that you thought I critiqued the video only for that reason."

This is all about creating a hype and the way I see it this is finely manufactured to that end.    Most things on television and most internet videos are, in one way or another, designed in such a way so as to get attention.  Especially in an internet world, that's pretty key.  This doesn't seem any more so then any other music video I've seen recently.     So maybe you think people can't made into brands?    I think that, to some extent, most pop stars try to make themselves well known, to create and put forward some kind of public identity and all that.   You can call that their ""brand"" if you want, I suppose, although the connotations are a little different.  That's nothing new; every major pop star since at least the Beatles has done that to some extent.  Madonna had one public identity; Taylor Swift has a very different public identity; Lady Gaga has a very different public identity then either.  It's basically a stage persona they create as part of their act.  It looks like she wants her prosthetic leg to be part of her identity, part of who she is known for, and wants it to be seen as a source of strength and individuality for her instead of a weakness.     I felt pretty forced by some agenda and a bit sick for the images alone.    The ""plotline"" of the music video was one you see a lot; the pop star was the symbol of ""resistance"" against the ""system"" (in this case, symbolized by what looked like Soviet secret police).  It was interesting that she used her prosthetic leg as part of that, basically saying that it was part of what made her different and unique.   Basically, like I said, it looks like she's trying to take her difference and make that a symbol of strength and power, instead of ""disability"" and ""weakness"".     If you think there's more of an agenda then that, then you'll have to tell me what you see here, because I don't really see anything negative."
Transhuman,2pfddc,Yosarian2,1 point,Sun Dec 21 23:44:06 2014 UTC,"Well, of course that has been going on in the media business for a long time and is hardly anything new. It's not like I have slept over that.   Basically, like I said, it looks like she's trying to take her difference and make that a symbol of strength and power, instead of ""disability"" and ""weakness"".        I think it should be noted that her weakness is a minor one when it comes to the issue of whether she's to be seen as different from others or just like the rest of us, normal human being with a one leg. Does the fact that her one limb is missing really ask that much for validation? I saw it as overpresented and hubristic. Part of her identity too, sure. That's why I don't think she is actually representing disabled people, but I'm clearly missing something important since many disabled people seem to endrose this. Amusingly so, especially when this lacks, in my view, the very humanism that empowerment usually embodies (as a side note: I dislike it how humanism and transhumanism are seen more commonly as conflicting paradigms). But there's enough to identify with for many people, for disabled and non-disabled alike. It isn't as niche as it seems though.   If you think there's more of an agenda then that, then you'll have to tell me what you see here, because I don't really see anything negative.   It might better to leave it at that then. But I'd like to continue a bit: There isn't necessarily anything inherently negative, but then again, I find very little to applaud for in the current world of music business and pop affairs on the whole. I mostly like to stay out of their sphere(s), pick the things I like and then move along. Just for the record I wrote the first comment because I thought this has very little to do with transhumanism, just like with disabilities."
Transhuman,2pfddc,lazaruski,1 point,Mon Dec 22 00:35:57 2014 UTC,"Does the fact that her one limb is missing really ask that much for validation?   For most people, sure.  We probably have a different perspective from most people, being transhumanists.   Let me just say that treating someone with a missing leg as being basically ""normal"", instead of a ""cripple"" who should be pitied, is a very new social phenomenon, and is still not anywhere close to being universal.  When someone is part of a group that is usually thought of in a negative way, there's a natural tendency to take that ""negative"" trait and re-frame that in a more positive way.   This is a pretty healthy thing.   Just for the record I wrote the first comment because I thought this has very little to do with transhumanism, just like with disabilities.    I think that the song and the video has a number of very strong transhumanist themes.   She basically talks about herself as if she is an upgrade, as ""constructed from a collection of parts"", and as ""the prototype"".  Obviously the video is set in a science-fiction future; in reality, the singer  not actually an ""upgrade"" (not currently, at least).   But the whole video has a very transhumanist theme, and it uses her prosthetic leg as part of that theme, which has an especally strong resonance since transhumanists have always been interested in prosthetics and replacement body parts as one technology that could eventually have transhumanist potential.  (Not just the ""spike"" version either, the ""see-through mechanical leg"" in the other parts of the video is also very transhumanist-inspired.)  I would certainly see this video  as transhumanist-inspired art.  That is, think of it as an example of the ""cultural transhumanist"" movement, not so much as an example of already existing technological transhumanism, and it makes more sense."
Transhuman,2pfddc,Yosarian2,2,Mon Dec 22 01:41:34 2014 UTC,"It felt a little disjointed (both the song and the video). I liked every part, I just didn't feel like they went together.  I also share the concern that this could really easily become just an objectification of disability - I think there's a thin line between that and proudly displaying yourself, and I sorta feel like this is already standing on the line. That said.. I don't want that to be a thing that's said every time a disabled person gets in the spotlight and says ""yes i am disabled""."
Transhuman,2pfddc,_watching,1 point,Tue Dec 16 17:25:27 2014 UTC,"this could really easily become just an objectification of disability   Could?  The entire last minute of the video did nothing but focus on the prosthetic.  The music aside since this is being posted to /r/transhuman/ but there's nothing ""transhuman"" about this, it's just a prosthetic in a different shape than the normal artificial limb with the exception that it likely has less mobility and function.  It's a gimmick and the artist is very aware of that and using it to her advantage."
Transhuman,2pfddc,3rdof4legs,2,Tue Dec 16 19:39:31 2014 UTC,"Like I said, I think there's room for the disabled to proudly display their prosthetic limbs, esp. when they're also artistic products, as a sort of reaction against undervaluing of their bodies. That can become objectification at a certain point, but I feel like it's a bit sketch for me as a non-disabled dude to basically say ""you shouldnt show your prosthetic leg in videos! its objectification, no im fighting for you"", yknow?"
Transhuman,2pfddc,_watching,0,Tue Dec 16 19:53:59 2014 UTC,"This is very different from simply showing it. I don't think it's just about being proud of it either. Her prosthetic limb gets commercial's worth of attention. She and Channel 4 are taking the advantage of the situation by simply claiming that you need to start thinking diferently about disablities. Well, I guess we need to when the disability isn't only disability anymore, it's a money making scheme (although this really is nothing new, just a different angle).   Also as a non-disabled dude I don't like the gimmicky way of forcing the viewer to think that he or she has some issues with disabled people. Actually it's them who imply it's not normal or okay for people with disabilities to pursue a career in modeling or music. This is despicable since it gives them justification for objectificating it. The reason it's hard for people with disabilities to beat the market is because there hasn't been a sexy alternative way of doing it before.  Prosthetic limbs will be used as a way of bodily expression, like tattooing, piercings and other more radical forms of body-modification. I don't need to like all of it, but it certainly adds something intresting to the culture.   Still pretty far from transhumanism."
Transhuman,2pfddc,lazaruski,1 point,Tue Dec 16 21:33:32 2014 UTC,"She's both trying to demonstrate that she can do physically impressive dancing moves even with prosthesis, as a way of making a point that she's not actually ""disabled"" in any meaningful way, and she's using it to make a statement about who she is.  I would also say that the song and the video have very strongly transhumanist themes."
Transhuman,2pfddc,Yosarian2,1 point,Sun Dec 21 21:17:41 2014 UTC,"I'm not doubting the overall functionality of modern artifical bodyparts, but I just don't think you can say that the video demonstrates her prosthesis's abilities very well in real life.

But I do think that a big point of the video was to create the image of her as a strong, athletic, individually powerful person, which is usually the opposite of what most people think when they think of someone who is ""disabled""."
Transhuman,2pfddc,Yosarian2,1 point,Sun Dec 21 23:46:53 2014 UTC,"Yes, but I think this begs the question if people then think that she is disabled or is she ahead of the curve? I lean to the latter (in the sense that the prosthetic is part of her body as much as her other limbs are and not in the sense of her being a new kind of pop star), while I can understand that people think she's still a disabled person. I argued why it isn't really so in the other reply as well."
Transhuman,2pfddc,lazaruski,2,Mon Dec 22 00:57:55 2014 UTC,"I think the only thing I really enjoyed about this was the concept of the aesthetic choices of the prosthetic.   When we have the technology to have a bionic prosthetic perform as naturally as a native limb, the ability to modify yourself even further than what we can as standard humans, whether that be simple aesthetic style as in this video or even new and interesting practical functions on top (what those function might be i have no idea) of just being a perfectly functional limb might just be enough to push a more mainstream ideology that technology can be incorporated into us, be part of us, and not just something for us to use. But of course i might just be getting carried away."
Transhuman,2pfddc,Slippedhal0,2,Tue Dec 16 21:45:03 2014 UTC,"It's interesting, and it's great that someone who is physically disabled can do that stuff, but it's still pop/electronica music.

This helps us see where a lot of the ""switches"" are that turn genes on and off, why the DNA can form different cells in your body, and so on.     The genome certainly isn't as simple as people thought back in 2001; we've learned that's true in a lot of ways since then.    But we're starting to break through to the next level of understanding here, to understand not just what the genes in your DNA are, but why they do what they do, why they activate or de-activate at different times, and (hopefully) how that can be manipulated."

Transhuman,2olmt3,MangoMangue,6,Mon Dec 8 01:10:12 2014 UTC,"Is pre-selection of childrens' genes a goal for transhumanists?    I wouldn't say that it's a ""goal"" for transhumanists.  It's one possible technology that might or might not help to achieve transhumanist goals, like improving health, preventing disease, improving intelligence, and so on.  In general, I would say that transhumanists are generally in favor of the idea of gene selection, but with the correlate that many expect other technologies to move so fast that they don't expect that kind of very long term genetic project to have much of an impact before other technologies make it less important then you might think.  If anything, I personally would say that other transhuman technologies will likely have a much larger impact.   If so, wouldn't it lead to a commodification of gene-technologies, or wider social stratification based on whether or not you can afford the enhancements?    You're talking about access here, which is an issue for transhumansits; not just for genetics, but also for cybernetics, or brain-computer interfaces, or other potential transhuman technologies.   I would frame the issue as ""once the technology exists, how can we quickly expand access so as many people as possible can use the technology if they choose to do so, so we don't create haves and have-nots""?  That is something transhumansts have thought about a lot.  Some groups of transhumanists (especally the ""grinder"" types) are interested in trying to develop DIY, open-source transhuman technologies that anyone would be able to do.   Others, with a more progressive bent, think that the most important strategy would be to ensure that the government provides these technologies to anyone who wants them as soon as they're proven safe (the same way that most people in most first world countries get medical coverage today).  Still others with a more libertarian belief system think that if these technologies are allowed to develop free of excessive regulation, that the price will quickly fall (as computers and cell phones have) and that most people will pretty quickly be able to buy them if they want them.    The key thing to understand, though, is that it sounds like you're only thinking in terms of competition.   If you can increase human intelligence, or improve health and longevity, or make it more easy for people to communicate complicated ideas with each other or with computers, and so on, you end up making all of humanity richer and better off.  If the next generation has more Einsteins then the previous generation did, then that doesn't mean that you end up worse off; it means that you have more people capable of rapidly pushing forward science and technology, which in turn makes your life better.     Enhancement technologies may cause some strife and some issues of access in the short run, but in the long run, they will tend to make all of us better off.  That's been true of technology in the past, and it will be true in the future.   Doesn't it also send the message to those who are differently-abled that they are somehow lesser than or not-ideal because of their mental/developmental illness?   I don't think that's at all true.  In fact, a lot of the technology we're talking about may do a great deal to help people with developmental disabilities or other physical or mental illnesses.  In fact, I think a lot of it will first be developed to help people who are disabled, and only later will it prove to also help ""normal"" people improve themselves as well.  That's the trajectory that technology like deep brain stimulation is on, for example; right now, it's being used on people with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, and other serious brain conditions but in the future it's likely to also be used to enhance the brains of other people as well.       Wouldn't these technologies be used primarily by those who are already excessively priviledged? Is this a moral concern or am I trippin?    That is a potential moral issue, and one we need to avoid.  That being said, trying to slow or resist technologies that will improve the lives of billions of people is an even greater moral issue.  One thing to always be careful of is that people tend to think about and fear the costs and problems that a new technology may create, without weighing it against the good that the new technology will do.   You see this over and over again, with nearly any new technology you can think of.   But in general, development of technology over time has dramatically improved our lives, and I think it will continue to do that in the future if we don't get in the way."

Wouldn't these technologies be used primarily by those who are already excessively priviledged?   Yet another analogy: in the 80s, cellphones were for the rich. Now they are revolutionizing Africa. It's not unlikely for a fisherman earning $2/day to own a cellphone.  Yes, as with any other technology out there, transhuman technologies will first be utilized by the excessively priviledged. But there's no reason to think that it will be that way forever. Given the rate that technology progresses, cost is usually not a big issue in transhuman thought.  Would you say that we shouldn't have developed cars or airplanes because initially only the wealthiest of the wealthy could use them? Of course not. The same thing applies to transhuman technologies."

I'm curious what you mean by ""whether or not the tech should be developed""? I find such statements absurd. If someone wants to develop a tech you don't approve of how do you propose to stop it? Would you use violence to achieve your ends? Maybe get together with a group of like minded people, arm yourselves with guns and attack and kill the scientists and researchers developing the tech?   If it's a tech that helps to make people's lives better or helps them achieve their goals, such as ensuring better genes for their offspring, there is money to be made in developing the tech and it will be developed. No amount of your ""shoulds"" and ""shouldn'ts"" will stop it."

That's one possible technique that may achieve transhumanist-type benefits (i.e. healthier, more capable people than usually appear by nature alone). But I doubt if the great majority of transhumanists see it as necessary, and some may even be opposed to it.   If so, wouldn't it lead to a commodification of gene-technologies, or wider social stratification based on whether or not you can afford the enhancements?   Lots of things can lead to social stratification. Inequality and 'haves vs have-nots' scenarios are certainly an important issue. However, that's usually not a reason to avoid even adopting/pursuing a particular technology. The inequality issue needs to be addressed directly, and in economic and cultural terms; luddism is neither an effective nor desirable way of approaching it.   Doesn't it also send the message to those who are differently-abled that they are somehow lesser than or not-ideal because of their mental/developmental illness?   In a way, yes. Is that a problem?  I think the assumption you're attaching to that is that it logically leads to some sort of discrimination against 'inferior' people. Which is really not the case at all. A person having fewer IQ points or a greater propensity for developing cancer or whatever doesn't make it okay to be mean to them."

The basic fundamental editing system that the author talks about (the CRISPR/Cas system) has yet to be tested in mammalian model systems. So, first, you'd have to actually demonstrate that this system works without completely fucking the host. The theory is there and it's been demonstrated in species of wheat but wheat is just a model organism and it's simple by nature.   Then, you'd actually have to statistically locate the chromosome (and corresponding loci) whereby the genes that affect intelligence standards are housed. For contextual sake, that means you'd have to locate AT LEAST 5,000 sites (SNPs come into play here) to a statistical certainty where p<0.01 aka small standard deviation bars. Why? Well, the CRISPR/Cas system is surgically precise meaning you better be fucking sure where and what your cutting is what you intended. This hasn't been completed yet and it's akin to crawling before brushing your teeth.   And, THEN, you'd have to take the leap of faith that the alleles you're fucking with don't have down-stream effects on OTHER proteins that lead to... I don't know... incorrect association with tumor-suppressing proteins.   So, no, we can't ""apparently expand out IQ in the thousands"" akin to flipping on a switch. That's just a complete misunderstanding of the article.  On a side note, I find it interesting that the author has pictures of ""Charlie"" from Flowers For Algernon and over-sized chickens. Both of these representations are examples of hormone induced improvements instead of systematic genetic engineering.   The author is also a professor of theoretical physics and he's writing an article about theoretical biomodeling and genetic engineering. I find this even more interesting alongside the CRISPS/Cas system of modification. The Flowers reference makes this point even more ironic due to Charlie's realization throughout the book."

Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis as removal of cas1 or cas2 abrogated spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.      The exact function of Cas1 and Cas2 is unknown, however a number of Cas1 proteins have been biochemically characterised and their structures resolved.    Cas1 proteins have very diverse amino acid sequences, however their crystal structures are strikingly similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.  Representative Cas2 proteins have also been characterised and possess either ssRNA   or dsDNA    specific endoribonuclease activity. The functional data and genetic mutation studies suggests that Cas1 and Cas2 excise fragments of invading DNA and insert them into CRISPR arrays.

As our technology increases the affluence at which we can sustain a larger and larger population also increases.   Should we assume that mind uploading/transferrance is in fact possible, and further assume that we come orders of magnitude closer to the theoretical computational limits of the universe, then the main remaining limiters are matter and space.  But those would only become relevant once our population reaches into the quadrillions to quintillions of persons. Before that we could settle for arcologies and other, similar, strategies.

I'm a grad student heading toward PhD, researching how to garner more respect and visibility for transhumanist ideas/ideals in both academia and the wider public. It's weird; you can forgive the public for a knee-jerk reaction to some of transhumanist thought, because it's a little out there, has to do with science/tech and the future, and requires you to tackle some cognitive biases that most people don't even know exist.  But academics? Man...I've talked to some very smart people, students and professors, within my own field of applied ethics as well as engineers and astrophysics, who just refuse to entertain some transhumanist ideas, and balk at everything from the growing dominance of technology to the ol' chip-in-the-brain enhancement idea.  I'm not disputing that there's differing viewpoints out there and that there are some valid criticisms of transhumanism...but the open ridicule I hear, especially when it comes from scientists, only gets me more fired up to carefully and logically dismantle their arguments through academia's holy grail of the Journal.  (Regarding cognitive biases, such as status-quo bias; look up Bostrom's Reversal Test on google if you're interested in a transhumanist approach to tackling some of them. It's available to most under/grads+ through your university, but I believe Bostrom also gives his papers away for free download on his website. Very interesting read, though the arguments only apply to consequentialist oppositions to human enhancement, not necessarily deontological ones and a few others Bostrom humbly notes.)"

There are two things I want to call attention to that I perhaps should have in the first place, but didn't think of it.  The first is the idea of diversity in all of its forms pertaining to humanity and how transhuman technology will just make everyone the same (apparently), and the second was an example about the... erm benefits (?) flaws somehow bring us.  With the first thing, the idea of diversity and transhuman enhancements, I always thought of it in terms of optimal routes of living vs suboptimal routes of living.  While ""form follows function"" may be true, when dealing with superintelligence and all that comes with it, I have to imagine it no longer would really apply.  In our more immediate context, enhancing body and mind in one way over another might certainly be less optimal in comparison to other methods.   But if its not a big deal, then perhaps there is no need to really worry about it.  However, increasing cognitive capabilities and general intelligence I would have to imagine would lead to lesser cares for things that become more trivial, such as animal instinct in the desire for mating and such.  Meaning higher intelligences would therefore seek the most optimal and important things as to be decided and achieved through exponentially increasing cognition.  So in short, in the end does posthumanism get rid of or increase diversity?   Are there almost always more optimal ways to exist in the universe and would we eventually all go down that path?  So the second thing was given as great scientists and artists of the past were social pariahs and such, and this somehow was in a large part responsible for subsequent breakthroughs and the like.  Of how their many failings (Newton, Tesla, etc) in certain areas lead to success in others.  This was the example that was given to me.  I should have posted this sooner, but what do you all think of these two notions?"

This means diamondoid mechanosynyhesis is not infeasible.  That is, the use of carbon-based nanoscale mechanical robots to assemble and disassemble more complex molecular matter. In terms of something like utility fog, that poses a lot of options for the question; ""what will man look like as a post human?""  The greatest likelihood is that we will reach a state of fully emulated cognition -- not biological but some other substrate -- which will be far closer to the computational density limits of the universe than we are today.  Sticking with ""conventional"" physics this means we'll see something like Jupiter Brains -- small, dense planetoids with extremely high heat output.  Whether powered by Dyson webs redirecting concentrated solar energy or by direct matter-energy conversion via Hawking Radiation, we're not very likely to live as individual human-shaped critters floating through the cosmos. Though we might send the occasional probe out into space, built out of self-arranging matter that can take nearly any shape or structure it needs (which has massive potential given metamaterials.) Existing as ""pure energy"" is really just not a thing.    As computational power increases, non-computing space will hold less and less relevance to our sentient descendants.  Okay... Now to add a few plausible but exotic elements of physics to the conversation.  Specifically, quantum scale wormholes and Alcubierre Drive.  In this case we might see similar probes as above, but this time they'd be in real-time communication with a decentralized cluster of computing bodies each built up like a pearl around their micro singularity grain of sand, as this would add a new dimension to the effective distance between any two points in the brain, increasing relative computing capacity at the same proximity to the theoretical computational limits of the universe.  These self-arranging probes could create material shell representations of our uplifted descendants, those who still have an affection for humanoid forms, taking inputs and signals from the material world and sending them back to the uplift's emulated environment.  An individual could flit from probe to probe; one millisecond spent walking on Mercury, the next navigating the lymphatic system of a peregrine falcon in mid dive for a comparative thousand years; the next orbiting lazily through a thousand material year's worth of recorded observations of the birth of a proto-star a thousand light-years away with no effective body at all beyond a cloud of fog; and the next locked in a resource economic ""war"" which is more philosophical than stock  in it's exchanges.

For words to be useful -- to be worth remembering they exist -- they must convey some thought or idea that distinguishes them uniquely.  The fundamental truth of the human condition is that man shapes his environment rather than being shaped by it. Man abstracts, plans, improves.  As a consequence humans live better lives than they would otherwise, but this is all extended phenotype.  Less exposure to disease means healthier people with longer lives and longer potential lifespans -- but not beyond the manufacturer's specifications.  To be transhuman is to change that condition.

I do think that things like drugs that allow us to better control our bodies are a transhumanist technology; in fact, I think that probably the most advanced transhumanist technologies we have are in the field of reproduction, where we have gotten a great deal of control over biology (birth control pill and other birth control technology/ IVF and fertility technology/ sperm and egg donors/ the ability to freeze eggs and sperm for later in life/ drugs to allow older men to be sexually active/ the ability to splice in mitochondria from a third parent to avoid genetic problems, ect.)  I also tend to put transhumanism into a larger context; I view it as just one piece of a larger goal of progress and improving the human condition.  There are other areas of progress that I wouldn't call transhumanism, but that I think are equally important (improving our tools and our technologies, learning about science and the universe, moving our species into space, ending poverty, ending war, improving education on the global scale, and so on.)    Transhumanism is the part of progress that is ""improving ourselves""; improving our tools, improving our knowledge, and improving the way that we do things (political change, for example) are separate categories that are perhaps equally important, and to some extent interlinked with the larger goals of transhumanism, but they aren't actually ""transhumanism""."

Transhuman,2ngq9b,eleitl,1 point,Wed Nov 26 09:21:16 2014 UTC,"Abstract Several theories link processes of development and aging in humans. In neuroscience, one model posits for instance that healthy age-related brain degeneration mirrors development, with the areas of the brain thought to develop later also degenerating earlier. However, intrinsic evidence for such a link between healthy aging and development in brain structure remains elusive. Here, we show that a data-driven analysis of brain structural variation across 484 healthy participants (8–85 y) reveals a largely—but not only—transmodal network whose lifespan pattern of age-related change intrinsically supports this model of mirroring development and aging. We further demonstrate that this network of brain regions, which develops relatively late during adolescence and shows accelerated degeneration in old age compared with the rest of the brain, characterizes areas of heightened vulnerability to unhealthy developmental and aging processes, as exemplified by schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease, respectively. Specifically, this network, while derived solely from healthy subjects, spatially recapitulates the pattern of brain abnormalities observed in both schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease. This network is further associated in our large-scale healthy population with intellectual ability and episodic memory, whose impairment contributes to key symptoms of schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease. Taken together, our results suggest that the common spatial pattern of abnormalities observed in these two disorders, which emerge at opposite ends of the life spectrum, might be influenced by the timing of their separate and distinct pathological processes in disrupting healthy cerebral development and aging, respectively."

I can see the insurance companies insisting on genetic profiling, and charging someone extra who has a risky genetic profile. In effect, pre-charging you for health problems you don't have yet. They could also insist on health and diet regimens to prevent them.

Just because people have healthcare, food, and bodily security doesn't mean they'll be free to do anything they want; maybe much the opposite. Maybe an ""automated"" society doesn't necessarily equate to freedom and simply deciding what you want to do. The use of ""we"" as one class of people seems like a utopian ideal that is very unrealistic, even though a highly automated society seems like a real possibility for our future.   Edit: Example idea from dystopian film Elysium (not the greatest sci-fi but has some things going for it). Technology exists to heal anyone of anything. Robots could probably build anything.

But these technologies are equated with power. Not everyone has access, and why should they?    Yes tools give power. But again, technology innovation happens in many places at once with many people involved- often many different technologies. Looking at how innovation happens now it seems rather unlikely that cornucopia medical machine would be developed in a secret lab where multitudes of new technologies developed and kept secret. That's just not how tech innovation works. Especially something as awesome as these robots and medical devices.   One can always come up with negative scenarios about anything. But the world keeps getting wealthier (everyone), technologies keep improving, science keeps moving forward, and the world is getting less violent.

This movement will flounder as it becomes obvious that the countries/societies that don't engage in GM/GE will lose out to countries/societies that do engage in them.   Certain types of Genetic Modification will probably never be a complete product.  Specifically fine tuning the immune system.  Can you imagine the nightmare if the majority of humanity all bought into the same IS product line?  Yikes.  As to GM vs GE.  What will really determine which one takes root depends on a single key factor:  Who is behind it.  Advantages of Genetic Modification   GM can be marketed for use on people alive already.  The people with money. Easier to get customers to buy treatments for issues they have as opposed to issues you tell them their children might have (e.g. compare real life polling of ""Would you abort a baby with a developmental disorder?"" vs ""Your baby has a developmental disorder, do you want to abort?""  The latter has a lot more affirmative responses by proportion) If it doesn't effect the subject's gametes then their children need their own treatment Doesn't have people object to creating perfect babies   Advantages of Genetic Engineering   Probably more effective. Most likely going to be heritable.  Which is more cost effective.   If governments are behind it I expect more interest in GE because it doesn't require as much funding to keep going, so the motive is to ""vaccinate"" your civilian population against things.  Imagine if you could improve the heart so that it has fewer heart attacks and can repair from damage without scarring, obviously death by heart disease is going to plummet from the top position on the cause of death list.  China has invested a lot of money in a China based company that is trying to figure out how to Genetic Screen fertilized eggs for intelligence (I think they invested half a billion USD equivalent).  Their goal is to make it possible for couples to use IVF with it to implant the most promising eggs.  In the USA any kind of investment in this would be too controversial, despite the fact that once practical there will just be two kinds of people: (1) those that GE/GM and (2) those that fall behind.  In fact, I think any sort of research that seems to do more than correct disorders is probably too politically toxic to be done by a US company.  At best they just get cut off from Federal funds (e.g. no NIH grants), but most likely they would start getting treated like a women's health clinic (picketed, bombings, employees put into online hit lists)."

The potential for your consciousness to come back exists, but you technically cease to exist for short periods if time all night.   So now let's think of you when you were 10 years old. Your consciousness is not an exact copy of you at 20, for all intents and purposes you at 10 and you at 20 are similar yet completely different consciousnesses.   Now let's go back that point when you download your consciousness into a robot. Your consciousness at that exact moment will exist in two places. Your consciousness from the human part will almost immediately branch off from the robot version, becoming two separate but similar consciousnesses.   The only way to eliminate this problem would be to do it while the host is unconscious, then immediately terminate the host once transfer is complete.

If they paid me $25, or, hell I would even give it to them for free for medical research.

I know the issue with targeting telomeres in aging is that it has a tendency to create cancer cells, but it looks that won't be an issue with this therapy. At the same time, this therapy does nothing to address telomere shortening than that should mean copying of DNA during cell division will still degrade over time, eventually causing death, but it's progress in the right direction.

Transhuman,2kp1z3,psygnisfive,1 point,Thu Oct 30 16:30:41 2014 UTC,"I don't think it's fair to say that none of the ideas remotely approach how we learn. There's a lot of evidence to support the idea that the cortex uses a recursive algorithm and hierarchical structure to do pattern matching and learning.  All evidence points to a single generic pattern that is massively replicated throughout the cortex and produces different behaviors based on what inputs it hooks into and where in the hierarchy it happens to be located.  While it's true that there's a lot that we don't know, we also have to be careful to separate incidental complexity from the core concepts. The brain evolved to do what it's doing and it's just one implementation of the general concept. The goal is not to replicate the brain and its complexity, but to implement the algorithm that it uses for learning.  To give an analogy, a combustion engine is complex, but an electric engine can produce the same external behavior using a completely different implementation that's far simpler. Conversely, there's no evidence to suggest that the wiring in the brain is the optimal approach or the only approach.  At the end of the day we want to compare how our algorithms stack up against the brain in terms of efficiency and accuracy. It's completely irrelevant whether they achieve the results the same way or not."
Transhuman,2kp1z3,yogthos,1 point,Thu Oct 30 17:05:23 2014 UTC,"All of what you say is true, and it doesn't change a thing. We do not have any real sense of how the brain learns, even in spite of what we know."
Transhuman,2kp1z3,psygnisfive,1 point,Thu Oct 30 20:04:42 2014 UTC,I guess it depends on what you mean by having a real sense. I think that the theory described in On Intelligence seems plausible. It makes testable predictions and and Jeff Hawkins is actively working on an implementation at Numenta.  If the AI created with this approach exhibits same learning capacity as the human brain then I would argue that we do know how the brain learns because we have a theory and empirical evidence to support it.
Transhuman,2kp1z3,yogthos,1 point,Thu Oct 30 20:46:44 2014 UTC,"Hawkins' model may be 100% true, but that doesn't mean we understand how people learn. It means we understand a tiny corner of how people learn. To truly understand, we'd need to know how the macroscopic learning phenomena are realized in that sort of wetware, which we don't understand at all.  What's more, understanding/knowing is not the same as having a model that works. Case in point: quantum mechanics. We've had exceptionally good models for a century, but essentially no real understanding. Understanding is about having a conception of something that is convenient for the human mind. No black boxes allowed, even if they're 100% accurate."
Transhuman,2kp1z3,psygnisfive,1 point,Thu Oct 30 21:13:50 2014 UTC,"I guess we're talking about different things here. You're talking about understanding the implementation of the human brain, and if that's the goal then everything you say is absolutely true. I'm talking about implementing artificial intelligence that has the same capabilities as the human brain.  Building an AI that exhibits capabilities similar to the brain does not require the understanding of the implementation of the brain, but simply demonstrating the capabilities. The case of quantum mechanics is a perfect example of this, since the model  allows for lots of practical applications."
Transhuman,2kp1z3,yogthos,1 point,Fri Oct 31 03:05:29 2014 UTC,"I disagree. Building an AI that exhibits capabilities similar to the brain will require that we understand the brain.

If we can observe what the brain is doing, create a model that explains how it can be done, and implement it then we have a system with the same capability.   Differentiating between human-like and human-inspired seems like splitting hairs to me.

A key part of the proof was a mathematical definition of a computer and program, which became known as a Turing machine; the halting problem is undecidable over Turing machines.

It isn't inaccurate, pretentious, or sarcastic description.  I recommend you include an example of each transhumanist school of thought that exists today or an activist that focuses on that school. I'd love to hear other commenters' thoughts on adding some prototype/concept art related to Ms. Vita More. Later sections have very good examples. If you want to go indepth with those schools of thought through examples then I recommend moving that section farther down in the article. If not, then it still works fine. The ""yeah right"" remark under Erythropoetin seems very out of place with the tone of the article. Perhaps it is appropriate for the tone of your website, but up to that point it stands out as a childish remark contrasting with the ""awe-filled, inspirational reality that our future will be"" tone. Your Defining Transhumanism section is very well written and I really like it. If you stay on this sub, then posting that piece alone is a helpful taste of transhumanism in my opinion.  Your ethics section came across as a bit...unoriginal. I'm not saying anything about it is wrong, but I feel like most of the worries has been repeated ad nauseam. If you can come of with a few simple-to-explain, but original potential hurdles then I strongly encourage it. At the very least repeat the point about gene therapy being more successful in the womb as opposed to our preference of getting freedom of choice about such things.   Overall that was very well-written and I'm glad I got the chance to read it. The discussion about Fukuyama in your dissertation and such makes me encourage others NOT to skip that link.          One last entirely-bias point: Perhaps this is very insensitive of me, but I've seen this one point on the whole idea of body builders having fragile egos related toward anyone being as strong as them with less effort before... and I don't think that is worth caring about, let alone worrying about."

I was considering going deeper into the different subsets of transhumanism and perhaps making it it's own section. You're right about the tone too with the 'yeah right' - my blog can be a bit schizophrenic at times, I'll probably just take it out.  Glad you enjoyed the section on Defining Transhumanism! I actually left the ethics section purposefully a little less detailed as I had provided the link to the dissertation, though maybe I should include more of that in the body of the main article seeing as most people probably won't read that far.   As for the bodybuilding point - I was really just using bodybuilders as the example (seeing as a lot of my readers are bodybuilders). In general I think several groups take issue with transhumanism being almost like a 'short cut' and how this might possibly 'cheapen' the achievement. Of course for now at least, training on top of any enhancements is still going to result in the very best outcome - so really it will just increase the 'starting point' for everyone in a uniform fashion.  I'll definitely take a deeper look into that ethics section and see how it can be improved. Thanks again for reading it and taking the time to respond :-)"

Transhuman,2jz604,luxybug,3,Wed Oct 22 15:55:34 2014 UTC,"From the original post:   Yun, in an interview on Bloomberg TV, explains why medicine that keeps the body in a youthful state will ultimately reduce the costs of healthcare, giving all healthcare systems an economic incentive to offer that medicine to their patients. “Think about your body as having a homeostasis system,” Yun explains. “When we’re young, it helps our body self-tune, and as we get older, especially beyond the age of forty, the system starts breaking down.” Once the body loses the ability to self-tune properly, “we create this thing called a healthcare system to try to make up for the lack of homeostasis. But imagine if we could put the healthcare system back in the body, allow the body to self-tune. Then we can spend those $2 trillion [Americans] spend right now on healthcare on something else, such as education.” Since age-related chronic diseases take up most of the overall cost of healthcare, treatments that reverse aging would make healthcare less expensive. Rather than being exclusively for the rich, those treatments would end up being more affordable than the medical care that exists today."

One one hand his book's reviews on amazon make him sound like an awful writer (due to problems and facts which could've been eliminated with the help of an editor) with admiration towards Randian Objectivism.      On the other hand his bio on that website and wikipedia make it seem possible that to some degree he is as unabashedly awesome as his characters. That book, or potential future novels, have the potential to attract a cult following for transhumanism and its ideals. If he ever makes a comment about wishing the future and the events of his story to be similar...he would rightly and deservedly be called a delusional madman. As much as I support transhumanism and the progression of science, I  would not support the political advance of someone that wrote such a hateful work.

Markov originally worked as a novelist and playwright in his native country, then governed by a communist regime under chairman Todor Zhivkov, until his defection from Bulgaria in 1969. After relocating to the West, he worked as a broadcaster and journalist for the BBC World Service, the US-funded Radio Free Europe, and Germany's Deutsche Welle. Markov used such forums to conduct a campaign of sarcastic criticism against the incumbent Bulgarian regime. As a result of this, it has been speculated that the Bulgarian government may have decided to silence him, and may have asked the KGB for help.  He died as a result of an incident on a London street when a micro-engineered pellet containing ricin was fired into his leg via an umbrella wielded by someone associated with the Bulgarian secret police.

Transhuman,2il93a,Ryan1188,1 point,Sun Oct 12 01:13:58 2014 UTC,"Good question.  From what I've researched, the likelihood of the magnet ""flying out of your finger"" is slim to none. People with these implants have gotten MRI's before and, while uncomfortable, did not cause any damage. It would be prudent to let the tech performing the scan know that you have this implant. People with body piercings do get MRI's all the time. However, there is a risk of the implant becoming demagnetized. I'm younger (24 years old) and reasonably healthy. In the rare event that I actually need an MRI and the technician recommends that I remove ti, no big deal. If I'm ever incapacitated and put in an MRI machine without the ability to give the doctor any forewarning, a tiny magnet getting ripped out of my finger will be the least of my concerns.  There was an AMA a guy did about his implant and his concerns about getting an MRI here"

I was trying not to make this a discussion about the religious so much as a call for those with less mad coping mechanisms to take a closer look at their positions, but I'm curious as to what you're getting at there. Specifically, what's the difference between ""think"" and ""know"" in this context? The distinction I seem to see people use is that ""knowing"" is just thinking something that is true, in which case claiming to know rather than think something is a meaningless distinction because of course anything you think is something that you think you know, if you thought you didn't know it that would mean you don't think it! Or at the very least it faces infinite regression with; do you know or just think that you know? Do you know or just think that you know that you know? etc.).

Transhuman,2iia2b,Dunder_Chingis,1 point,Thu Oct 9 01:27:12 2014 UTC,"One of the greatest things about humanity and the absolute worst, most horrifying things is our ability to form convictions is what I'm getting at. Imagine someone raised in a catholic environment their entire lives. Jesus, the bible, God, communion, and whatever else little interpretations or misinterpretations that come along with it are a part of their life. To them, Jesus and God are facts, not objects of faith. Just as we know that atomic nuclei are made up of protons and neutrons, so too was the world made by God in 7 or 8 days (I can't remember what it was) So if you went up to one of these people and said ""Do you really think God made the earth in 7 days?"" the response you'd get wouldn't be a laundry list of biblical interpretations, but ""Because that's what happened. Everyone knows that!""  If you want people to think critically about their faith and their convictions, you have to slowly introduce alternate concepts to them over time in order to avoid angry or violent backlash, and you can force it on them, just like you can't really force religion on others."
Transhuman,2iia2b,Dunder_Chingis,2,Thu Oct 9 08:26:01 2014 UTC,"Right, so it's more their definitions you're talking about then. I guess I more meant that ""how do you know that"" SHOULD be a sufficient response. But you're right, from their perspective, there's no way that would be enough.  The blog post itself skimmed over the religious bit because the religious weren't the target, but that doesn't mean I don't think we ought to confront the religious and attempt to have a dialogue with them. I was myself raised Christian, and it's thanks to people like you who actually want to put in the effort to show people the flaws in their beliefs that eventually led me to realise the problems with mine."

Transhuman,2i9iib,dirk_bruere,2,Sat Oct 4 08:54:29 2014 UTC,I'm more excited about the electrospray thruster usage they mention. These types of engines use completely inert ionic liquids as fuel. Because of that they're perfect for cubesats. And because there are no moving parts high pressure requirements the mass is very low. As they are now electrospray thrusters are sufficient to get a 3U cubesat from LEO to Mars or other inner system targets.
Transhuman,2i9afv,MaiLaoshi,3,Sat Oct 4 06:11:41 2014 UTC,"Sort of, and sort of not.  It really depends on what you define AI as and how you define a 'body'.  For specific intelligence, which self-driving cars are a good example, the world can be describe pretty well with rules for the system to follow built from our perspective.  Something like 'if distance to obstacle is less than 100m and shrinking, apply breaks'.  This works for nice neat rule-based world models, and I probably wouldn't call the car the AI's 'body', as the same AI could be installed in a simulator and not know the difference.  However, if you're going with the typical movie type Artificial General Intelligence, then the 'body' is important.  There is a problem in AI research that is pretty close to what you're wondering.  ""The Symbol Grounding Problem"" by S Harnad is a good article to read.  Basically, it refers to the problem of describing the world to an AI from our point of view, it wouldn't make sense to it.  It would be the same problem if a dog would be trying to describe the world to us, our sensors are just too different.  Now we're moving from ""we're pretty sure"" to ""we should really do more research on that"", from this point it's my opinion, which is a bit biased as I do research on embodied cognition in robots.  Building the world model from the AIs perspective should provide a much more robust and flexible intelligence, which is why I think it's the way to go for future AgI.  It pretty neatly side-steps the grounding problem, since I never describe the world to the robot, only give it general rules of what it should/should not do (less Asimov, more 'don't run into the wall').  It takes a lot longer to learn this way, but the benefit is that if sensors change, wear out over time, then the AI can adapt on its own, potentially shifting importance from unreliable sensors to more stable ones.  /u/aesnxs is right about various sensors being inputs, the difficult part, and what we're working on figuring out is how best to build a system that learns from these on its own.  Long gone are the days of being able to use state-machines to describe if this-then that type systems, the world's just too complex to build a flexible system in that way.  For emergent AI like Orson S Card describes in the Enders series, the entirety of the interconnected, interstellar computer network was it's 'body', with all of humanities digital information acting as it's sensors.  As for movement and the importance of a nervous system, that's only really a requirement in the biological world.  The brain is extremely expensive in terms of energy required per gram of matter.  For the sea squirt, this means that once it's found a reproductive promising location, and doesn't need the complex motor control to move, there's no reason to keep the brain.  Over time, a sea squirt who's brain shriveled after moving would have an advantage over one who's did not as it wouldn't need the same amount of food.  One good famine could be enough to tip the genetic scales towards 'eat your own brain'.  The reason why we have our brains is still up for debate, and while I've read up on a few of them, it's not my primary interest so someone else would be better suited to go into that.  I may have gone a bit off topic, hopefully I gave you some info to digest."
Transhuman,2i9afv,natbur,2,Sat Oct 4 12:50:01 2014 UTC,"Human brains are biologically evolved to tackle the problems encountered during the period of the evolution. Which we are understanding now as information processing biological machines. That doesn't limit us developing something called artificial intelligence. For reasons like what you are concerned, they may or may not exactly look like humans, but information processing machines.  I would say the fundamental mechanisms by which our brain works is in the evolved, emergent behavior of a network of neurons the blueprint of that is encoded in the DNA and the rest is learned from the environment. Essentially modern brains are evolved to learn. Which in theory one day can be achieved artificially, if we can recognize all aspects of the so called intelligence and the process of learning.  My best guess is that such a system can automatically arise from a network of information storing  nodes following simple rules. Read about Cellular Automata. The information processing capability is just the consequence of such rules.  It is only a matter of time that such a program is invented to solve some problem on that scale or just emerges out of the existing system as seen in various cellular automata. We don't even know if the Internet is actually conscious and intelligent or actually processing information which it is not intended to do. Nobody probably checked!"

To state it simply, by the time you are 75, a large number of important brain systems have died and been replaced by new functions. It will be difficult, if not impossible to restore these functions in a human who has already aged.  You could hopefully live long enough for an AI to resolve this, as that is pretty much the only thing with the capacity to do that kind of in depth replacement.

The thing is you can't have a single logical unit on an asynchronous clock - otherwise the signal on the left of the chip can't be integrated with the signal on the right within this cycle. At that point the waiting game starts, which means you need stuff like memory and locks (no new jobs for the waiting part). All at a very low level in your electronics - which is a really bad idea.  With speed comes a size limit for logical units. After that limit all you can do is add more units - which works really well for some jobs (graphic cards) and really badly for others (everything iterative/recursive. There is a reason why so little software actually can use 4 or 6 cores)."

Instead they often use signals that indicate completion of instructions and operations, specified by simple data transfer protocols. This type is contrasted with a synchronous circuit in which changes to the signal values in the circuit are triggered by repetitive pulses called a clock signal. Most digital devices today use synchronous circuits. However asynchronous circuits have the potential to be faster, and may also have advantages in lower power consumption, lower electromagnetic interference, and better modularity in large systems.

Transhuman,2ge54d,KhanneaSuntzu,8,Sun Sep 14 22:00:47 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure how to ""prove wrong"" such a vague idea.  Global warming is likely to do significant damage to costal cities because of ice melt, may reduce the agricultural output in some areas, and is likely damage the environment in other ways.  It's a very serious problem, and one we need to start dealing with seriously now, if only because the cost of acting now is so much lower then the cost of doing nothing.  None of that, though, is likely to lead to human extinction; even in the worst case scenario, you still end up with a planet that is human-habitable.     As for the related problem of fossil fuels, we already basically have the technology we need to maintain something close to our standard of living in a post-fossil fuel world; solar power, wind power, nuclear power, and electric cars would basically do it, even with today's technology, without lowering our standard of living very much.  (Maybe we would have to spend 15% of global GDP on energy, instead of the 10% we do now; somewhat painful, but not catastrophic).  The transition is going to be rough; we have a huge amount of fossil-fuel based infrastructure we're going to have to replace.  And it'll be rougher if we want too long, since it costs energy to make solar panels or nuclear plants.   I think the big variable is if we do in intelligently and it goes smoothly or if we're stupid about it in which case it could be a major disruption to our economy and civilization, but either way, we should get through it."
Transhuman,2ge54d,impermanent_soup,-3,Sun Sep 14 22:11:44 2014 UTC,"Ice melt is not the problem. That takes decades, probably. Disturbed weather patterns, droughts, cold snaps is a significantly bigger issue, since we will need a lot more petrochemical energy to get food from the field to consumers. Petrochemicals we do not have and which exacerbate the problem.   Categorically alternative fuels, even if implemented at maximum political force will cover about a fraction (5-10%) of current growth of petrochemical consumption. It doesn't even replace current growth in petrochemical consumption. Sure it's a solution but at best, most sincerest (which we do not at this time) it's only a few percent, 20-40 years from now from what we need.   Current alternative fuels will probably end up saving regions investing in them. They will not allow the developed world even an ephemeral shadow of current standards of living. Simply too many people that need products, services, transportation grid, foodstuffs.  The transition is not just going to be rough - current projections assume mass death, mass migration, local resource wars (especially water). Assume the dying starts (primarily in the developing world) around 2020, and will take about half a billion humans per decade.  I don't need to tell you half a billion deaths per decade is worse than an ongoing second world war, constantly. This is what people at the pentagon and other future think tanks project.   So what do the transhumanists propose who realise this? we need AGI as quickly as possible, or the species will be mostly extinct by 2150."

Petrochemicals we do not have and which exacerbate the problem.    Worse weather in some areas is a likely problem, but again, it's not something that I could see causing the extintion of the human race, which is what you were talking about.  You are right that global warming and running out of oil are problems that in some ways make each other more difficult to deal with, but by no means impossible.      Categorically alternative fuels, even if implemented at maximum political force will cover about a fraction (5-10%) of current growth of petrochemical consumption. It doesn't even replace current growth in petrochemical consumption. Sure it's a solution but at best, most sincerest (which we do not at this time) it's only a few percent, 20-40 years from now from what we need.    I think you're seriously underestimating the degree to which we can deploy alternates.   If you're talking about running out of oil, specifically, then we've already shown that we can already make electric cars that are nearly as good as gasoline cars, and are nearly as affordable.    The real question, IMHO, is if we're going to be smart and start phasing out our gasoline car fleet quickly, or if we're going to be dumb and wait until the price of oil skyrockets and we start getting severe shortages before we get serious about electric cars.  If we go the second route, then it would cause severe economic pain.    But none of this is anything close to a scale that could cause ""human extinction"".    It's really just a question of how much pain we want to inflict on ourselves before we start to fix things.  Either way, we should manage, it's just a question of if we make a smooth transition or a painful and wasteful one.   The transition is not just going to be rough - current projections assume mass death, mass migration, local resource wars (especially water)   Those are all possible.   If we handle the transition badly enough, it could quite literally result in the death of millions or tens of millions of people. I'm not trying to understate this; dealing with the energy problem is one of our biggest issues right now.  But I don't see how you get from ""mass migrations out of flooding coastal cities and wars in certain parts of the world over water"" to ""total human extinction"".   There seems to be a serious disconnect in between those two that I'm not seeing."

There are several ways in which religion can interract with transhuman condition:   fundamentalist naturalism: when religions, especially abrahamic ones embrace anti-transhumanist and luddite sentiments. Im pretty sure that christian and muslim fundamentalism already is like that to a degree. This is the most likely scenario. metareal transcendentalism: when religions that focus on personal enightment (buddhism, sufic islam, taoism) embrace transhuman technology, especially mind-uploading, neural networking, and AI, as tools for reaching enlightment or transcendence. This kind of religion-philosophy is also most likely to survive the migration out of Earth, or into virtual reality, since it does not require a communitarian bond with other practitioners, or with a physical church. neo-angelism: when AI or sufficiently advanced posthumans become objects of worship by unaugumented or weakly augumented humans, and treated as personal gods, or guardian angels. This is a likely scenario if AI research far outpaces other transhuman technologies. Obviously, this one would seriously clash with religious ludditism, and might me even a reason for a holy war. theistic singularitarianism: if AI somehow slows down, and Singularity is sufficiently delayed but considered viable, many people will grow in anticipation of the ""Machine Messiah"" and worship it in advance. Once first AGI arrives, this kinds of cults will probably dissolve, or turn into one of the two above. cyber-animism and transcargo cults: if Singularity is delayed, but weak AI becomes widespread, it is almost given that previously shamanistic or animist cultures of the 3rd world will develop a religious fetishism towards robots and AI.

All  of the  things you mentioned can pretty easily be either answered  now, or answered by hypothetical future adaptations in these  faiths."
Transhuman,2g2ygs,_watching,3,Fri Sep 12 06:55:57 2014 UTC,"A) Religions do adapt, but as we see from history, sometimes religions die and are replaced. Paganism in Europe was replaced by christianity. Zoroastranism in Middle East was replaced by Islam. There is no reason to believe that the same thing won't happen again: old cults being wholesale replaced by something new.  B) If the universe makes sense at all, and follows consistent rules, then these rules can be determined. If the rules can be determined, then we can learn how the universe came to be, and how it exists. This would answer whether there was a creator or not."

I see this as a trend in the online H+  community and it's really been bothering lately, especially as an atheist and self-professed skeptic. We can't accept things we don't have evidence for. It's silly to believe things just because they're comfortable and sound reasonable. And saying things like ""Old religions die, therefore these ones will soon"" or ""We  can figure out basic rules of the universe,  therefore one day an  AI will prove there's no god"" seems a lot like just  saying things because it's comfortable and sounds ""logical.""  Again, if you have evidence of current trends or actual events  that show these religions are going to die  out, go for it, but  this is just wishful thinking as far as I'm concerned."
Transhuman,2g2ygs,_watching,2,Fri Sep 12 07:17:29 2014 UTC,"both of those claims follow what are explicitely obvious trends.  Religions rise and fall, and it would be ""special pleading"" fallacy to claim that for some reason islam/christianity will somehow survive till the end of the universe/humanity (whichever comes first), or that existence or non-existence of god is somehow a special and unknowable variable."
Transhuman,2g2ygs,Freevoulous,1 point,Fri Sep 12 07:39:31 2014 UTC,"til the end of the universe   Since when is ""a transhuman future"" then? As a lot of people here probably agree, I think  this phrase means ""in a couple of decades"". Regardless, you're claiming specifically that it's likely that Christianity/Islam/Judaism will develop in a specific way, which is something that requires evidence.   existence of God being inherently unknowable   Again, I never said that, but what you claimed was that an AI would be invented that can know the answer - and that that answer would be  there is no God.  Again, these are two specific claims that requires  evidence to back it up."
Transhuman,2g2ygs,_watching,3,Fri Sep 12 07:45:36 2014 UTC,"There is a lot of silly optimism about the pace of change in the transhumanist crowd I give you that.  If history is any indication, average lifespan of a major religion is 2000-2500 years until its inevitable decline or replacement. Given that culture changes much faster now than it did in the past, and that both islam and christianity are already quite old, I'll coservatively give them 200-300 years more until either they are replaced or change beyond recognition.  As for the existence of god being confirmed or not: it all comes down to two variables - is the nature of reality knowable or not, and whether self improving AI is possible or not. Again, based on what we observed so far, scientific questions are being answered at an ever accelerating pace, and artifical intelligence also improves semi-exponentially. Combining these two trends we can speculate that sooner or later, an advanced AI would amass enough knowledge to say whether god exists, or even if that is a valid question.   The only way this could not happen is if there is a hard limit to intelligence (AI will inexplicably stop improving by some point, and remain there untill the heat death of the universe), or if our universe is inherently non-deterministic and a-logical and some questions, like the existence of god cannot be resolved.  So far, evidence shows that there are no known limits to intelligence and that the universe is, in fact logical and consistent."

I mean, frankly, if you can keep religious beliefs created by shepherds living thousands of years ago alive in the post-modern world we live in now and not have a problem with it, you can probably do it in a cyborg-transhumanist world as well.  Never underestimate people's ability to self-delude or to hold contradictory beliefs.  If we dramatically increase lifespans, that may weaken one of the main things that prop up religious beliefs, the desire for an afterlife, but that likely wouldn't be enough by itself to really get rid of religion.

Transhuman,2g2ygs,houdoken,3,Fri Sep 12 13:00:21 2014 UTC,"and what happens then? when the ""divine"" experiences are known to be self-initiated and not externally attributable to some imaginary god figure?   To be fair, the fact that we can observe specific types of brain activity when a person has a religious experience is not a very strong argument against religion.   Any experience a person has is going to have some kind of brain activity associated with it, that doesn't, by itself, tell you if it's a true experience or a false experience."
Transhuman,2g2ygs,Yosarian2,3,Fri Sep 12 15:17:13 2014 UTC,"I can't invalidate other people's subjective transcendent experiences just because their explanations of them happen to be highly improbable. For me, there are no false experiences. Experiences are experiences. Our need to compartmentalize and contextualize those experiences oftentimes leads us to wonky worldviews that don't align with our evidence-based modern views. For me, I'd believe that they experienced what they did, but that it very likely wasn't for the reason they had come to believe.  The brain can do weird things. It contains DMT in the pineal gland. Transcendent experiences are going to be filtered through a person's belief systems, education, etc. A person who grows up Christian and attends church every Sunday will see angels in accordance with their beliefs. A Buddhist might glimpse into the Bardo realm and commune with multi-armed beings. Our brains spend all day manufacturing a coherent reality from a plethora of incoming chaotic sense data--I'm never surprised at the colorful hallucinations it can come up with during such brain activity when strained through the traditions of the world.   I don't view religion as ""untrue"" in a subjective sense. Some religions make claims about the objective nature of reality without having any evidence.   Assuming that it's anything other than the brain itself playing tricks on us is something I can't really do--and I've spoken with goddesses, transdimensional beings, and other various thoughtforms of my own design. But then again, that sort of hacking at my own brain has informed my own views on all of this.   Did an experiment for a month once wherein I used ritual structure informed by various occult practices originally designed to conjure communication with angels/demons and modded the narrative to conjure patently fictional entities (from pop-culture cartoons) to convincingly interact with my own mind in a ""religious/spiritual"" way.  It worked. Proved to me that these people that think they are doing these things in some objectively ""real"" way are just tricking themselves, and that any of us can access this type of experience without being ""crazy"".   Aleister Crowley once said, “In this book it is spoken of the Sephiroth and the Paths; of Spirits and Conjurations; of Gods, Spheres, Planes, and many other things which may or may not exist. It is immaterial whether these exist or not. By doing certain things certain results will follow; students are most earnestly warned against attributing objective reality or philosophic validity to any of them.”   And that's really the jist of it. Brain can do weird things; don't believe everything you think or experience.   Once you've toyed around with this for a while, the pragmatic question then becomes ""How can I use these tools to my advantage in the real world?"". And I hope to see a future wherein people can explore these things with a firm grasp of what's actually happening in their brains. I guess you could think of it as a secularization of the shamanic or something.   TL;DR: ""It's all in your head ... you just have no idea how big your head is """

I'm just saying (and I'm more playing devil's advocate here then anything else) that if you take two hypothesis (""all religious experiences are a result of errors in the brain"" or ""at least some religious experiences are in fact real interactions between the brain and some outside being that actually exists"") that showing a brain scan of the brain during a religious experience isn't really evidence for or against either hypothesis; you would expect to see unusual brain activity in either case.     I think that the religious hypothesis is very unlikely for other reasons, but I don't expect the brain evidence to change many people's minds here, at least not on it's own."

I imagine an end to ""one size fits all"" religions and more small group explorations into what's possible in these areas.  And I'm even more interested in the novel approaches that don't rely on awkward skeuomorphism from existing historical belief systems.  I'm imagining a truly democratized and equal opportunity access to a much fuller spectrum of transcendental subjective experiences--and not just with some end-goal of wirehead bliss junkyism, or equally boring artificial ""cessation of suffering"" across the board, but rather as a platform within which we can arrive at deeper, more meaningful understandings of ourSelves.

Transhuman,2fu1e2,Ragnarondo,2,Tue Sep 9 00:54:39 2014 UTC,"My concern is that if artificial intelligence emerges with core driver's based on profit   Yes that would certainly seem like a very bad outcome. To go along with my previous comment: how is profit (greed for wealth), different than political aspirations (greed for power)? Would an AI with a core driver based on either motivation be positive?   My thought is that it really wouldn't matter, both would be extremely undesirable.   Arguments for both drives could be thus:  Political aspirations (greed for power)- an entity that used political structures that required citizen approval could as a byproduct produce good outcomes regardless of the individually selfish motivations. ex. trains run on time, the poor are fed, etc.  Profit (greed for wealth)- an entity that used business structures that required customer approval could as a byproduct produce good outcomes. ex. technological innovation, expansion into space, etc.  I think that many people assume that one motivation is superior than the other. I don't see how that is true. After all governments not businesses killed hundreds of millions of people during the 20th century. One could argue that governments are evolving to be better. But the track record would seem to indicate that governments are much worse for the average person than businesses. So I think the burden is on the idea that political greed is superior to wealth driven greed."

In advertising, the phrase is often used to convey that a product is made with the best possible technology, but it has been noted that ""the term 'state of the art' requires little proof on the part of advertisers"", as it is considered mere puffery.  The use of the term in patent law, by contrast, ""does not connote even superiority, let alone the superlative quality the ad writers would have us ascribe to the term"".

When all of the molecule copies have broken off (once per division) the cell dies.  It's a built in mortality clock in your cells.  They are working on using stem cells to put new copies of DNA back into you so that clock basically resets.  I am paraphrasing and going off memory but I just read about this not long ago.

If your upload is around at that time, he may have to work 24/7 (in accelerated time of course) with superhuman focus, efficiency, and software-defined cheerfulness (or else), and be replaced by a fresh copy anyway as soon as he is tired.   Lines like these make me doubt the honesty of the AI friendliness crowd. Superhuman focus and efficiency are all good things, and so would be the ability to modify desires. Most people when they talk about post-scarcity economy do not realize that the term is an oxymoron.  The way the economy now works is by addicting consumers to a neverending stream of cheap garbage and most people think that is the way the economy should be. The people are gorging themselves on crap and stopping just short of doing actual drugs.  The sobering thing is that I might not be any better.  Competition is not that bad, it is necessary for improvement. A world of human uploads would be a world where people exchange and test cognitive patterns as they reach for the endgame - that of hacking reality and reversing entrophy to bring about the true post scarcity. I make no judgement whether that is possible, but I do think that would be a worthwhile a goal for post-humans. If they fail, they will go down with the universe.   software-defined cheerfulness (or else)   Or else what? They will be unhappy?  Play is really work that is fun.

For various reasons I think the latter is the least-anomalous possibility out of all cosmological concepts.  Important disclaimer: Tegmark only lays the groundwork for this implication, without exploring it himself. I'm not sure whether he personally would accept or reject my position, which goes a couple steps further than anything he seems to have written.

Immortality is kind of what biology is, specific immortality for one specific consciousness though is a lot trickier.  It appears that it can be done for a living organism, whether that creature can have a sustained consciousness and memory of that entire time remains to be seen in studies (what we would call higher consciousness beings like humans).  The first tech we need to develop well is genetic repair, the ability to do that stops cancers, telemere damage and genetic mishaps.   Then we should really look into viral control, if we can use them as both delivery and repair rather having to fight them it would make life easier to be a future biological ""immortal"".   Next thing to be a biological immortal is trauma protection for our brains, either a way to distribute it redundantly throughout our bodies(damage to any parts doesnt destroy the consciousness due to backups) or a way to keep copies in separate places for a reboot.   This may be possible if we could ""code"" parts of our consciousness into our genome or a similar way in our very cells so that in the event of massive trauma we can regrow our minds.  Would be very tricky to get that to distribute sufficiently at a rate that would render consciousness at a point not too far from ""death"", perhaps some kind of last known update gets precedence. Blood music by Greg Bear gives a grey goo reason why we would have to be very careful with this tech.

Its name is derived from the Greek nouns telos (τέλος) 'end' and merοs (μέρος, root: μερ-) 'part.' For vertebrates, the sequence of nucleotides in telomeres is TTAGGG.  During chromosome replication, the enzymes that duplicate DNA cannot continue their duplication all the way to the end of a chromosome, so in each duplication the end of the chromosome is shortened  (this is because the synthesis of Okazaki fragments requires RNA primers attaching ahead on the lagging strand). The telomeres are disposable buffers at the ends of chromosomes which are truncated during cell division; their presence protects the genes before them on the chromosome from being truncated instead.  Over time, due to each cell division, the telomere ends become shorter.  They are replenished by an enzyme, telomerase reverse transcriptase.

And if we 'fix' stomach pains and back pains, doesn't that mean that people with stomach/back problems will be less likely to go to the doctor and get the source of the problem fixed? After all, a person born with congenital insensitivity to pain tends to have a shorter life expectancy."
Transhuman,2dk3r8,ultimario13,5,Thu Aug 14 19:26:48 2014 UTC,"It's a bit complicated to explain, but basically, we currently live on a spectrum of pleasure and pain. There's a lot of diversity in all the emotions we feel, but the basic foundation is one of pleasure and pain and all the different varieties thereof. What the hedonistic imperative aims to do is to essentially radically raise the lever so that there are differing ""gradients of bliss"". Everything will feel wonderful, but some things will feel more wonderful than others. Back pain will still feel less wonderful than normal existence, but objectively, it will feel better than anything we can feel today.  A good metaphor is the donkey with the carrot and the stick. Pleasure is the carrot, the positive motivator in our lives. Pain is the stick, the negative motivator in our lives. To end suffering, we would simply replace the carrot and the stick with two different carrots of differing taste. It wouldn't actively hurt to get the less tasty carrot, but you would still want the better one.   After all, a person born with congenital insensitivity to pain tends to have a shorter life expectancy.   Yes, but pain and nociception are different. There are people who are able to feel damage to their bodies perfectly well and react accordingly, yet still don't actively feel pain. Look up ""pain asymbolia"". It sounds like they have the best of both worlds."

In both cases, we're paying for something good (in the first case, 'art', and in the second, semi-affordable Apple electronics) with something bad (human suffering).  In either case, can we reasonably trade one for the other?

You should also check at various forums (and reddit) where you know university students hang around.

Consciousness is a pattern in a physical system, and there are no immutable physical systems.  This is not my point, though.  My point is that the assumption that anything stemming from research into AI must be applicable to human consciousness enhancement or vice versa takes many leaps of faith.

Some people search for an everlasting life, and for some the only path they can see to that is brain uploading. For others it isn't.    You're stumbling on a dilemma many people have, even without the immortality bit. That a life without enjoying yourself, no matter how long it is, isn't worth living.    You haven't missed the point of transhumanism, you're just coming to terms with some of the existential problems that come with it."

Personally, I am not a big fan of many of the limitations of a physical body and the world we live in.

Transhuman,2cmaq4,voyaging,11,Mon Aug 4 20:58:10 2014 UTC,"No, brain uploading implies that the computer in question is equally capable of sentience and of having the raw feels of experience. If this were not the case obviously nobody would do it.  Personally, I am a radical transhumanist and even I am skeptical about the practical or ethical benefits of complete mind uploading (and even further skeptical that a classical digital computer is capable of solving the binding problem). I am strongly more in favor of genetic engineering to improve us as biological organisms, which alone could lead to super-happiness, super-intelligence, and super-longevity. Should complete mind uploading ever be a relevant thing, it will be in the distant, distant future. Currently the main use I can see of mind uploading would be to upload aversive experience to a non-sentient computer while maintaining all desired mental states, though I must admit I am ignorant as to how that would work technically."

As intensely interested as I am in H+ theories, I'm not certain that ""super-happiness"" or ""super-longevity"" would do much more for us in the long run than create new problems of tolerance, boredom, and destruction. And the idea of uploading aversive experiences to non-sentient computers leaves me to think we'd grow even less ethically/socially evolved than we are now. (What would happen to empathy? Would we all become hyper-happy narcissists?)   As for the OP, transhumanism isn't about becoming a computer for all/most of us, I don't think.

And likewise, it is a fallacy that improved hedonic tone would lead to boredom (boredom itself being a negative mental state that could be banished entirely should we want to), and if it is done via genetic manipulation would not suffer from the issues with tolerance that euphoriant drugs cause, for example. This belief that ""we need bad states to be able to appreciate good states"" is false, likely driven by the fact that our currently evolution-designed physiology has a very strong tendency to revert us back to our hedonic set-point... but this can be overcome! Much the opposite of your objections, increasing our hedonic tone could radically improve our motivation, empathy, compassion, creativity, and selflessness far beyond our wildest imagination.  As for super-longevity, it needn't be compulsory of course. But one should be able to choose to live indefinitely should one want to.  As to the binding problem, perhaps you misunderstand the way I am using the term ""solve"". By ""solving"" the binding problem, I mean I do not think that a classical computer is capable of producing (or ""being"") a seemingly unitary subject of experience."
Transhuman,2cmaq4,neitherpinknorpale,1 point,Thu Aug 7 03:10:31 2014 UTC,"Let me say that I sincerely appreciate your optimism and enthusiasm; it's refreshing. And you may well be right about classical computers having the potential to ""solve"" the binding problem, though I agree it wouldn't be any time soon. (I'm not sure we'll be talking about ""classical"" computers then, however.)   It isn't that I believe we forever need the ""bad states to appreciate the good"" (although I think this may have been important to our consciousness evolution in the past), but even positive behaviors exhibited compulsively can create problems with dopamine and serotonin levels (i.e., forming tolerance). Masturbation, sex, eating, gambling. We become immune to their feel-good nature, and eventually numb.   Dopamine is both a reward and a motivator. It's hard for me to foresee a world in which we so radically improve upon the brain's reward circuitry, but I'd like to imagine it's possible. And I'm of the opinion that we're already outstaying our welcome, so until we've dramatically improved our empathy, our intelligence, and our ethics, I hope we don't make many gains in longevity."
Transhuman,2cmaq4,voyaging,1 point,Thu Aug 7 04:23:34 2014 UTC,"Indeed, I understand your skepticism. However, I think it is nearly certain that through selective genetic selection (read: designer babies) we can predispose our offspring to be entirely incapable of having negative experiences (this probably sounds a bit too radical, but I think as we begin to understand the implications, to have any other intentions would be sadistic, but this is an ideological rather than technical difficulty).  Improving our children's hedonic tone via recalibrating their genome is not subject to the same pitfalls as masturbation, sex, eating, gambling, addictive drugs, etc., namely tolerance; it would engender lifelong bliss, not merely instances of it.  Genetic predisposition to being happier or more depressed can already be seen in biologically ""unenhanced"" humans. The ADRA2B has multiple variants, one of which, for example, predisposes people to be significantly more pessimistic, to see the worst in situations, and to have a far higher frequency of clinical depression.  Conversely, the SCN9A gene contains variants which strongly predispose people to have a much higher level of well-being, another which radically increases a person's pain threshold, among other things.  Given the option of giving your child one of these particular variants, assuredly one ought to prefer the variant that will likely give the child a higher quality of life and be prone to less suffering, no? Many think we're better off letting nature roll the dice but I am optimistic that these people will become the minority over the coming decades.  ""Tolerance"" of course is not an issue, as once we are sufficiently advanced at pinpointing the exact mechanisms of each of the 4 or so billion base pairs in the human genome and manipulating them effectively, our brain's reward circuitry will be practically an entirely new system. Down and up-regulation of various receptors after stimulation can be entirely avoided (which is why I think the fact that currently the brain had defense mechanisms against feeling too good for a long period of time, this is easily fixed by altering our genetic code), levels of dopamine or oxytocin can be permanently increased (significantly increasing motivation, euphoria, and empathy, for example), the possibilities are mind-boggling. And I haven't even touched on the radically enhanced intelligence we can produce by selecting for specific genes.  Unfortunately, you and I likely won't be able to enjoy any of these utopian technologies as I highly doubt genetic modification will be very safe or effective in adults. Should we want to improve our well-being or cognitive abilities we'll probably need to wait for new and more effective designer drugs that are able to prevent tolerance (there are some promising ones), or alternatively become ""wireheads"" with machines that chronically tickle the right spots in the brain. These are very, very crude stopgaps, though.  Unless of course we are still alive when nanotechnology becomes sufficiently advanced, which probably has overwhelming possibilities for improving our well-being and our intelligence, though I think it's premature to make any predictions in that sense. As of now genetic engineering is already being done and if taken further, we can create babies that are invincibly super-happy, super-empathic, and super-intelligent (and I feel we are morally obligated to only have children that are genetically enhanced, at least to such an extent that they are prevented from the unnecessary suffering the genetic roulette so often allows); the real barrier is ideological (""God made us perfect!"" or ""we'd be losing what it means to be human!"") and not technical.  Sorry for the super-long essay, lol."

It's a nobel ideal, I think, to desire to enhance strong well-being, optimism, emotional and mental health in the population (though there are many current ways to do this, by self-selection), but unfortunately the possibility of selecting for genes would almost certainly be limited, at least initially, to the privileged classes, and would trickle into choices around race and sex.

""God made us perfect"" and ""We'd be losing what it means to be human"" don't meet the criteria (at least not in my mind).   I feel the ethical implications of the history of eugenics do not have much relevance in this case; historically, eugenics often involved genocide or at the very least forceful prohibition of certain people/groups from breeding. In the utopian scenario I'm suggesting, anyone can have kids, including people with poor genetics. If I'm not mistaken that is the sole ethical dilemma of eugenics, that it prevents certain people from breeding, often forcefully. But if you think there are other issues I'd like to hear them.

This is a very common argument against radical human enhancement, but I think even if initially only the wealthy are able to genetically enhance their children, this will last for a decade at most. As of course you know the cost of novel technology rapidly decreases to the point where even those in poverty could afford it. About a decade ago, the cost of a full DNA sequencing was ~$1 million. Now it can be done for under $1,000 and it's nearing the $100 mark. Likewise, ""designer babies"" will be an option for every financial and social class shortly after it becomes mainstream.

I am by no means a geneticist, but I'm inclined to believe the future of genetic engineering (and probably modern genetic engineering as well) would involve epigenetics and gene expression. And as just one practical example, we can successfully treat/prevent cystic fibrosis with similar methods to what I'm suggesting. Granted it's a bit simpler since it has a very specific gene profile, but at the very least it shows the profound effects even the extremely limited use of genetic engineering we are currently using can have.

Want to make 15 copies of yourself and have a giant self-orgy? Go ahead. Even immortality isn't something anyone would force on you.

If any pique your interest, perhaps study up on them and try to go into the closest field?  1) Germinal choice - do parents have the right to select, manipulate or otherwise control the genetics of their not-yet-born children?  Possibly some overlap with the abortion issue.  Potentially related to stem cell debate?  2) Copyright law (as pertains to biology) - currently, genes can be patented.  This of course incentivizes research labs to study genetics and make discoveries, but it could be abused; a lab discovered a genetic tweak to eliminate the possibility of arthritis, aging, cancer, etc.  How long can they control it?  3) Copyright law (as pertains to synthetic minds) - if sampling and re-mixing music means you owe royalties to the original creator or record label, then what does that mean for AIs?  Arguably the things they learn and discoveries they make are just 're-mixes' of their inputs and experiences.  What does this look like?  One ugly scenario is that laws require AIs to keep some internal logging of all of their inferences so that any interesting/profitable insight can be checked to see who/what it is based on.  Even if technically possible, it could potentially hurt performance and slow down AI development. OTOH, we don't want a loophole where just because it was an AI that blatantly ripped off your copy-right/patent, it gets away with it.  4) Rights of non-human minds - someday we'll build AIs as smart as us.  We also may uplift animals to human equivalence or beyond.  Do they have rights?  Possibly related to the question of 'Great ape personhood'.  On a related question, if we limit human rights to 'humans', the definition of 'human' can/will get quite murky in the near future.  Contributing to the 'Great Ape Project' could help start discussion and set precedent here.  5) Cognitive liberty - in the long run it's the right to alter your mind in whatever way you see fit; in the short run, laws/regulations on drugs like Adderall, THC, etc, set a precedent on limiting your and my freedom to use external technologies to alter our minds.  Working against the War on Drugs may actually be a good step in this direction.  6) The right to Body Modification - there's some overlap with (5) here.  There are already growing body-modification communities (called 'Grinders', not to be confused with the dating app 'Grindr').  Pursuing body modification is difficult because qualified medical personal are afraid of loosing their licenses.  Turns out this is called 'Morphological Freedom'.  7) The gap between the haves and have-nots argument - many people worry that only the rich will be able to afford the best enhancement technologies, which will cause an ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor.  Do we need a social/economic support system to give everyone a chance?  On a related note, as automation increasing, fewer and fewer human beings will be able to make genuine economic contributions; how does civilization adapt?  Possible work in this area: ""Basic Income"" initiatives.  In general, I imagine the legal ground-work and precedents for the above issues could be established today and/or in the near future, without waiting for the advanced technologies we all look forward to.  I'd love to hear the thoughts of someone with actual legal experience on these issues.  Best of luck in your search!  Edit: added the term 'Morphological Freedom' for easier googling."

Transhuman,2c4vsu,embryodb,2,Thu Jul 31 18:27:48 2014 UTC,"Hum...  Right now brainwashing depends on disrupting  or otherwise confusing the brain's normal patterns. Part of the reason it's so clumsy is because we can't directly hijack a sense feed (we cann't say bypass the eye and send a like-to-like signal down the optic nerve.)  But a big portion is the disruption itself. Disrupt normal pattern, establish new pattern. This should be a more precise process the more control you have over that process.  I don't think it would count as a new sence, although you could pipe in any new sense you wanted at that point and it would probably take root over time. Pipe infrared  down the optic and maybe tactile feeds and the brain will establish relays to effectively use the information.  If the ability to directly cause orgasm is an integrated feature (and we can all guess how likely this is) then, as lab tests have shown time and again, someone in control of your feed can make you do anything they want even if they don't bother with the brainwash."

If you're talking about a mobil implant operating wirelessly that you can slide in and out of your head, then I think there'd be a struggle and the brain would start out by mostly obeying the more native signal as long as the signal strengths were similar."

Obviously not to acceptable vision standards quite yet, though bionic aural implants are getting far better from what I've heard. The issue, as mentioned below, is that the more connected direct stimulation becomes, the more at risk your own body becomes. Hopefully security becomes a primary factor in development once it reaches that stage, before it becomes a problem, but for example we already have hackers who have raised awareness that with the right tech you can alter functions in and even turn off currently implanted pacemakers at a distance.  Other tech in the very early stages is led contact lenses. These currently are very early concept stages, so theres not much on them, but if they could bring the tech up to current gen display levels, it could provide a very nice step that doesnt require actual physical augmentation."
Transhuman,2c4vsu,Slippedhal0,4,Wed Jul 30 13:59:34 2014 UTC,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argus_retinal_prosthesis   The device consists of two primary elements – a retinal implant and an external system consisting of an eyeglass-mounted camera in combination with a small processor. The camera records real-time images, which are processed and sent wirelessly to the implant by a built-in video processor.[7] The implant then uses 60 electrodes to stimulate the patient's remaining healthy retinal cells and send visual information to the optic nerve, thus restoring the ability to discern light, movement, and shapes.[8] In some cases, the Argus II can restore sufficient vision to allow blind users to read large print books   This will advance in the coming years to the point of super human vision, in ranges that no human could ever see, and it's digital... So VR vision is doable."
Transhuman,2c4vsu,FireFoxG,3,Wed Jul 30 14:55:25 2014 UTC,"Although most current prosthetics focus on directly stimulating the retina or or optic nerve, there is research into more downstream stimulation(thalamus, optic radiation, visual cortex) which could eventually provide higher resolution images and (maybe) color. Current tech is basically just an array of electrodes which provide electrical stimulation in a grid, giving the user sensations of points of light (phosphenes). These stimulations only provide luminance, color information is somehow encoded by the brain. A major thing to tackle is to learn more about how these downstream visual tracts encode information, but I think there is progress being made there. If we could do that, we might be able to create images in someones head (artificial imagination?) rather than just phosphenes they explicitly see.   Of course all of this requires surgery, at differing levels. The current ARGUS model basically just requires eye surgery, and there have been tests to stimulate visual cortex, which is on the surface of the brain. However thalamic stimulation is a bit harder as it lies deep in the midbrain. The unrelated field of Deep Brain Stimulation does very similar things though, so it is possible in theory to implant a thalamic visual prosthesis. The question is when if ever normally sighted people can get surgery to implant a commercial-grade visual prosthesis. I think advances in robotic surgery and various 3D imaging will bring the risk down eventually so that doctors will perform this kind of augmentation, but when if ever insurance companies will cover it is another story.

Currently there is really only one major optical prosthetic, the Argus II which feeds a camera into approximately 60 retinal ganglion cells (last I checked!) and allows some degree of sight to be regained in the case of retinal failure. Currently the technology is extremely rough, due to the incredible difficulties involved in both ""plugging into"" single neurons, and the computational difficulties for proper encoding.  That said, I find it much more likely there will be some sort of interweaved lace that sends signals down the optic nerve while the eyes are covered. This allows for synthetic signals and virtual reality, but returning to reality is as simple as turning it off and uncovering your eyes.  It'll be a long time before anything this intimate leaves the medical field though, so you'll have to be patient for now.or become a patient??.."

The early stages of visual processing have been extensively studied and mapped, so the next big step is really deeply understanding the functional element."

Transhuman,2bayor,thefunkylemon,8,Mon Jul 21 15:57:50 2014 UTC,"I found this piece largely incoherent.  First, religion is addressed with bland generalizations. Second, a transhumanist religion is advocated. Third, the whole thing was vague and not useful.  I think the article would have been substantially improved by being more robust in the treatment of religion. Most importantly, it defined all religious behavior by the policy positions of some Christian churches in the United States. Among other things, American churches were primary supporters of the abolition movement and the civil rights movement; these were not secular philosophies opposed by religion in general. Even had the characterization been accurate, accepting the current paradigm of a single country as a stand in for the world at large is useless bordering in irresponsible. Without a wider and more rigorous treatment, we can't identify any useful changes, or even whether any need to be made. I submit that taking it on faith is fundamentally hostile to the transhumanist goal.  I oppose the notion that a transhumanist religion should be brought into competition with established religions. Narrative is a fiction device. I see no reason to believe that any evolution of intellect or consciousness could be mechanically installed, and therefore no merit to the suggestion that the public be pacified with a new religion which has as its only virtue a failure to oppose scientific research. The core tenets of the transhumanist philosophy cannot be passively advanced. They must be actively engaged with to have any value. The article would have been better had it called for evidence based practices rather than a new narrative. Or, instead, attempted to examine the value of a narrative to people.  I find the dichotomy between transhumanist philosophy and religion to be false. In order to serve humanity, direct engagement with religion is not even necessary; instead, we should direct efforts to understand the underlying mechanisms and overarching effects of religion along with all other forms of social organization. Once we have a strong understanding of the psychological needs of the individual and the societal impacts of group we can address these directly.  Large social forces, I suggest, are the single most important subject of study for transhumanist philosophy. If we are to significantly alter humanity's course, we need a nuanced understanding of what the current course of humanity is and why. The vague and casual treatment and overemphasis displayed by the article is counterproductive."

Transhuman,2bayor,Iam_nameless,10,Mon Jul 21 16:20:54 2014 UTC,"Well, that whole faith based thing kinda messes with the long game.

And, if you say, that transhumanism fulfills the promises of religion, why would you still engage in something that doesn't fulfill any promises?

To me that's why I think transhumanism and religion go well together. We have no idea what is going to happen once singularity happens and we step through that doorway.  All of sudden we shift from this limited world with a limited physical perspective, to an infinite virtual world with infinite perspectives with no loss whatsoever to what reality is.  There's no way describe it because it's beyond words. The only resources and knowledge available that explore it are ancient religious and spiritual texts that discuss the finite self merging with an infinite expanse / God / Shiva / spaghetti monster / Buddha nature / Pure land / etc.   In my opinion it won't be be long until scientists and religious people come to terms that they have been seeking the same thing all along. The only thing that divided them was their methods. But when we finally arrive it all just be water under the bridge as skepticism and fanaticism no longer have a purpose and just go out of style."

I like my doors to open.  There is always a purpose for skepticism. Not irrational disregard, but rational skepticism like: Never in the rationally recorded history of the species has there been a working example of this thing that you speak of.

I am particularly interested in the delivery of nucleic acids (DNA, siRNA) for the treatment of various diseases.   Nanotech like Incredible Journey is where drug delivery is headed, albeit very slowly if it's possible at all. Unfortunately, everyone on the inside of the field doing research is pretty pessimistic about the potential of radical life extension, etc. The truth is we're quite far from anything like augments but as an optimist I could maybe see us getting there in 30 years.  If by augments you mean microelectrical mechanical systems (MEMS), we do have working technology in that area that's getting better all the time for things like delivering chemotherapeutics across the blood brain barrier to treat glioblastoma. It's just the current FDA guidelines do not really allow for enhancements to be approved. Most if not all devices, MEMS or otherwise focus on treating disease, replacing a lot limb or organ or restoring lost functionality to an individual.  Basically, I guess what I'm trying to say is if transhumanism takes off it will be due to biomedical engineering research but from the inside it seems quite far away. I like the field and highly recommend it if you're interested, it's just you have to realize you're not going to be immediately making ""augments"" and would probably get laughed out of a conference if you tried to discuss it.

So nanotech itself isn't a funding category in most cases but work on the forefront of most fields is dipping into nanotech or fast approaching nano scales.

Transhuman,2a3sch,Bahatur,6,Tue Jul 8 01:43:39 2014 UTC,"In short, no.  Corporate personhood exists as a reasonably narrow legal fiction, and has existed in that form for more than a hundred years.  Several other people I think expanded on this significantly.  The key point is that Citizens United was a court case about whether a group was permitted to air a documentary on television.  It wasn't an affirmation that ""corporations are people"", but rather a judgement about how much freedom companies had to spend money expressing their views.  The extension of a legal fiction to cover speech is interesting, but it's not an assertion that corporations are people subject to the Bill of Rights just as private citizens are.  The only legal precedents for expansion of private citizenship are the 14th and 19th Amendments.  Sadly, stretching either of these to cover nonhuman/posthuman/transhuman intelligence is going to be enormously difficult.  tl;dr: Corporate personhood is not a true assertion that corporations are people.

Many people fundamentally misunderstand what a corporation is.    Should a Muslim CEO be allowed to force his employees to wear hijabs?   First, let's remove the word ""force."" Nobody is forced to have a job. Your real question is this: Can an employer condition employment on the wearing of certain attire? The answer is: of course they can. Almost every business does this, including strip clubs and grocery stores.   Should a Pagan CEO be allowed to demand that his employees leave an offering at the office altar?   A business owner should be allowed to condition employment on the performance of certain acts. A CEO may generally not, however, require employees to spend their own money on a given activity (although in a perfect world, employers and employees could contract on any terms of their choosing). So, if the offering is paid for by the company, there is no reason why a business owner should not be permitted to operate the business according to his or her own wishes.   why are we letting Christian CEOs tell their employees what they can or can't use their health care for?   Business owners are certainly entitled to choose what they will and will not pay for. If an employer chooses not to provide a specific benefit to an employee, that employee is free to purchase that benefit from a different source.   should we let Christian CEOs tell their employees what they can or can't use their paycheck for? What's the difference, in your opinion?   If an employer and an employee enter into an agreement that in some way controls the lifestyle of the employee, then it is not the government's place to intervene in that agreement. An employer and employee may, for instance, agree that the employee may not use drugs or alcohol as a condition of working for the employer.  As an example, my brother is a machinist and his employer required him to quit smoking because they believe it would make him shaky on the job (although it was probably more about lowering insurance costs). That agreement is perfectly permissible, even though it controls an aspect of his life outside of work. In another example, I was once terminated from a religious organization (the YMCA) for engaging in a same-sex relationship outside of work.  Ultimately, it is the prerogative of both the employer and employee who they choose to interact with and on what terms. It is not up to the government to decide what terms people ought to be agreeing to. Having liberty requires allowing people to be shitty to each other.   Let's not forget that we wouldn't even be discussing whether an imaginary construct like a corporation has freedom of religion if it weren't for Citizens United   Yes we would. Corporate personhood has been around for more than 100 years.   The individuals who make up part of a corporation already have all the rights to which they're entitled as human beings.   One of our constitutional rights is the right to freely associate with one another. So, we have the right to spend all of our money as individuals on a given activity, and the right to freely associate with other people to do the same. If we say that people may not exercise certain rights when they aggregate together, then we must admit to ourselves that we are punishing people for associating with one another.  You may or may not be right about what would create the best outcome for society, but you shouldn't lie to yourself and pretend that you aren't advocating a reduction in liberties. You want to prevent people from exercising speech if they are doing so as a group. But you're also deluding yourself into believing that you don't want to reduce rights in doing so.

I agree with this 100%, which is why I don't think democracy is a productive form of government. It doesn't secure people's rights sufficiently. The problem, however, is not that people are exercising too much speech, or that they're exercising speech collectively, it's that speech can impact the rights of others in the first place.  We have a problem: the government can change or dictate what rights people have. Your solution is to lessen people's ability to petition the government. But you're fixing the symptom not the disease. The government should not have the right to remove liberties in the first place.   Because it's a partnership and not a corporation. The partners are distinct, sentient, beings.   A partnership may contract as a separate entity. It can obtain limited liability for its partners. It can sue or be sued as its own entity. The only difference between a partnership and a corporation is the number of people involved.  Actually though, when it comes down to it, partnerships can have as many people owning them as corporations. A corporation can have two shareholders. A partnership can have ten partners. You're distinguishing between business forms, but there really is no difference beyond the structure of ownership.   They are not arbitrary/anonymous potential placeholders.   Neither are many corporations. Most corporations have a majority of shares held by less than five people. When you remove rights from the large corporations, you're removing rights from the small ones too—the family-owned corporations.  You're letting the word ""corporation"" become a boogeyman in this conversation. A corporation is simply a way that a business can be formed.

They rightly have more of a say in the goings on inside the company than all the employees by virtue of where they sit on the org chart, but pretending that corporations themselves have beliefs and religious views is just a pretense for giving the guy(s) at the top of the org chart an extra, unwarranted voice in politics."
Transhuman,2a3sch,chilehead,2,Tue Jul 8 22:47:24 2014 UTC,"By accepting the absurdity that corporations can have religious rights, this allows the CEO or board of directors' religious views to trump those of the individual employees.   No. An individual business owner could choose to refrain from purchasing certain types of health insurance for their employees as well. This right applies to both individual and corporate employers. The court's holding states that people may not be forced to buy things that violate their religion. Employees still have the right to buy those things on their own. They also have the right to work elsewhere. No right of theirs is infringed by an employer's exercise of discretion to not provide a specific benefit.   If every employee of the company donates what they can to candidate A, and the CEO prefers to donate to candidate B, the recent rulings that tossed out restrictions on corporate donations mean that the CEO/owner can use the company to make even more donations for candidate B.   CEOs have a fiduciary duty to the shareholders and the board of directors. CEOs probably could not exercise this power without approval from the board first. Ultimately, a company is owned by the shareholders. The property and money owned by that company belongs to the shareholders as well. If the shareholders, through the directors or the CEO, choose to spend money in a certain way, they are simply exercising control over their own property.  Nothing about this act suggests that the employees are forced to donate their own money to a given political cause. Employees are free to spend their money as they like. In the same way, employers can spend their money as they like.   If the CEO of, say, McDonalds has the company make a $50 million dollar donation to a cause that every single other employee of the company is opposed to.   Employees do not own the company.

Transhuman,2a3sch,spookyjohnathan,2,Tue Jul 8 13:31:33 2014 UTC,"I would rather give rights to those who do not merit them than deny them to those who do.   For the most part, I agree with this, but the risk that has to be understood in this case is that the more things we grant rights to, the less free we are to act in relation to those things.  For a very simplified example, consider if we determined trees worthy of rights. Suddenly the furniture we use would be an attack on the dignity of trees.  To be more specific, imagine if we granted civil rights to cattle, above and beyond what we've been able to define as animal welfare. Now human suffering will increase, as the price of food increases, because we've granted rights that simply can't be appreciated. The cattle have no conscious idea of their right to life, or right to freedom. Except in cases where their welfare is completely disregarded, and inhumane methods of slaughter employed, the animal doesn't miss these rights, which have been granted to it, just to be safe.  To be even more specific, we've granted rights to corporations, which, being imaginary constructs, have even less consciousness of their rights than cattle and trees. And now human suffering will increase because we have less freedom in relation to them, i.e. we can't use them to suit our purposes, because someone has imagined (or pretended to imagine for the sake of their profit margins) that they are entitled to their own rights.  But I guess I'm kind of getting off topic, and turning this into a debate of the validity of corporate rights, rather than addressing the question of whether corporate personhood will affect communal consciousness.   To get back on track, I would say that I don't think corporate rights have any bearing on the situation. This is mostly because I believe that corporate personhood is just a facade, a sham to protect profit margins, and that those supporting it and enforcing it only do so because they have been deceived, or else are only using it as an excuse (and would therefore never enforce it in favour of something that didn't directly benefit them,) but also because I think that if the kinds of consciousness you describe are ever realized, they'll almost definitely be imbued with their own rights because not only would they be self-evidently conscious, but would by definition include the already granted rights of the individual constituents."
Transhuman,2a3sch,chilehead,1 point,Tue Jul 8 17:17:22 2014 UTC,"The rights of the individual constituents is an excellent point, being loosely the same basis that the corporate personhood is based on.  So that accounts for anything with a human constituent; what about without? The much ballyhooed AI citizen, or something more prosaic like a genetically engineered cybernetic chimp.  I don't think there is any inherent reason we can't define them as citizens and naturally extend those rights, but I find the concept of a rights-bearing entity that can roll off of an assembly line interesting; AI can proliferate to the limits of the hardware, corporations to the limits of the bureaucracy.  I was trying really hard to find an upside to the legal trend, and the ironic nature of granting rights to something manifestly not human was the best I could do."
Transhuman,2a3sch,qnaal,2,Tue Jul 8 20:30:21 2014 UTC,"Asserting/allowing a corporation to have religious beliefs is an abuse and an intrusion on the religious beliefs of the employees.  Corporations do not possess souls (personally, I assert that no one does) - some churches assert that not even animals possess souls, only humans - only the owner/CEO/board of directors.  The company itself cannot perform acts of worship, be saved, or sent to Hell/Valhalla/etc. (The closest to that it could be sent to would be relocating to Chatsworth)  Health care is a compensation that they provide to their employees, just like a paycheck is.  The company doesn't get to decide what the employee does with their paycheck - it can't demand that they not spend it on beer at the local topless bar in their off time - and likewise it shouldn't get to decide what the employee does with the healthcare services provided by the plan once it has been provided to the employee.  Once it has been provided to the employee, the employers control, involvement, and interest in it has ended.  If the employer doesn't want to purchase the health plan for the employee, they'd have to increase wages paid to the point where the employee could purchase the insurance themselves without suffering a loss in their standard of living.  The corporation still wouldn't have any say in which insurance the employee purchases, or how they use it.  The company isn't ever in a position where it is making the decision to procure birth control or abortions, that is entirely in the hands of the employee.  But Hobby Lobby wants to be part of that decision, entirely so they can veto the employees decision, regardless of their religious beliefs."

The observation has also been called ""Davis' law""   or just the ""journalistic principle"".  In the field of particle physics, the concept has been referred to as Hinchliffe's Rule.   Betteridge explained the concept in a February 2009 article, regarding a TechCrunch article with the headline ""Did Last.fm Just Hand Over User Listening Data To the RIAA?"":   This story is a great demonstration of my maxim that any headline which ends in a question mark can be answered by the word ""no"". The reason why journalists use that style of headline is that they know the story is probably bullshit, and don’t actually have the sources and facts to back it up, but still want to run it.

It would be interesting to do the math, but maybe they can even deflect bullets. An active armor system, if you will.  What you'd need is a 360 degree camera, possibly working in more EM frequencies than just visible light. It would have to be good enough to detect a bullet fired off in the distance and signal the drones to intercept. The drones would have to be maneuverable enough to have enough time to change their course to intercept the bullet. Probably not all of them will have time to do that, which is why the drones should be spread out in a cloud around you. The drones fly out towards the bullet to meet it and ram it from the side. The farther away the drone is from you when it intercepts the bullet the smaller the angle of deflection required to make the bullet miss. They could have tiny shaped charges to propel them sideways into the bullet in order to deflect it. It might take several drones per bullet though.  With a cloud of a few hundred drones it might be possible for an attacker to shoot a whole magazine of bullets and have every one of them deflected."

Transhuman,29q1mt,im_not_afraid,-2,Thu Jul 3 18:02:46 2014 UTC,"The basic premise of all spirituality regarding the mind (consciousness) and body (you) is that the mind resides inside of you and you reside within the mind.   Inherently you end up with a strange sort of paradox that doesn't contradict itself however because both premises are true.  Mind is inherently a container that contains itself.    Science is based on the premise that there is a cause and effect for everything. Spirituality says that cause and effect are the same, in a weird ""they both create each other"" sort of way. (Sounds weird at first but makes sense on a metaphysical level. You need the color black to know the color white and vice verse. The color white could not exist if there is nothing to compare itself to.)  However Deepak Chopra is just overall poor spoke person for spirituality in general IMO. The only reason he is famous is because he took the skills he learned as a researcher (which is basically writing a metric ton of material everyday to hopefully get published in a journal and to continually apply for grants) and transferred them to the spiritual community.  After writing dozens of mediocre books he was bound to hit a home run."

The color white could not exist if there is nothing to compare itself to.   NOPE. I actually worked in neuroscience and particularly vision and this is the kind of stuff we laugh at when faux scientists spout it out. I'm sorry if that sounds harsh but it's a reflection of the amount of times I've been presented with nonsense like this by people with no domain specific knowledge that would allow them to easily dismiss such a blatantly incorrect idea. It's like the ""what if your blue isn't the same as my blue"" question. Urgh. There are loads of colours we can't see. Our inability to detect certain wavelengths has an effect on our ability to see others but by no means does it prevent it. An inability of our brain to process ""black"" would not practically, theoretically or metaphysically have any impact on our capacity to process ""white"".   Although the inability to process ""black"" would lead to our inability to define ""white"" as ""the opposite of black"", which is what the metaphor was referring to. He was making a semantic argument, not a physical one; I'm not sure how you managed to misinterpret that."
Transhuman,29q1mt,moozilla,2,Fri Jul 4 07:39:04 2014 UTC,"Forget about perception for a minute. If the color ""black"" literally did not exist, by definition you could not define ""white"" (in the sense of the opposite color). You can try and stretch the metaphor as much as you want (eg. you could definite white as a mix of all colors of light) to try and be argumentative, but it's totally missing the point.  What nameless was trying to get at was the Buddhist concept of Pratītyasamutpāda (""dependent origination"" or ""co-arising""). Another metaphor you may have encountered that gets at this concept is the chicken or the egg paradox. It doesn't make sense to imagine a world where a chicken exists without an egg, because both are inexorably linked. (And obviously you could argue that blah blah science says a chicken is made up of cells, and it could be born in any other number of methods we've encountered and so on, but that again would be missing the point of the semantic argument being made.)  Honestly, I think you already understand all of this and are just being purposefully obtuse. I don't see any other explanation."

It seems to me that you get a lot of satisfaction, happiness, and security from it. I would be an asshat to try to take that away from you.   But do you believe that consciousness is an epiphenomena of matter? Or does consciousness give rise to what we observe in the universe? A sort of what 'what came first? The observed. Or the observer.' zen paradox.   Really though. This conversation illustrates the huge divide between science and spirituality. I recall a story about the Dalai Lama who visited a couple neuroscientists studying emotions/thoughts and it's responsible chemicals in the mind. The Dalai  Lama asked them if it is is possible that the thought/emotion comes first than the chemical is produced. The neuroscientists more or less dismissed this statement favoring the classical mechanistic paradigm that chemicals produce mind functions rather than mind functions producing chemicals.   You interpreted everything I wrote incorrectly and gave a defensive answer to an attacking premise that I never created. And I'm pretty sure that I did the same thing. We are just on two totally different wave lengths.   As singularity draws closer though and people notice that more and more of the sciences are merging together and overlapping (robotics, neuro-biology, AI, etc.)  we will slowly come to terms that singularity is not exclusive. It will literally encompass everything from science to spirituality (spirituality without all the religious mumbo-jumbo).   And I'm not some lone nut-job thinking this. Just google GF2045 conference. It was a conference that hosted many intelligent scientists and philosophers in the world to discuss how to make singularity a reality. It was the launching pad of more cohesive collaboration backed by a billionaire. The final talk that day (after two days of of talking future and current tech) was a panel discussion of almost a dozen of the world's most prominent spiritual leaders encouraging singularity to happen as a way to bring nirvana (Buddhism) / the kingdom of heaven (Christianity) / enlightenment (other obscure spiritual practices) to every person on the planet.   I hope I gave you am interesting perspective. To me it's incredibly fascinating as it's given me a way to resolve some internal conflicts of being a former Christian via my parents and a former atheist via college. I now have found a happy middle ground where I enjoy the best of both camps without any of the bullshit associated with either such as the ignorance over experience taught by religion and the rampant militant skepticism taught by science."

Hell, the earliest identifiable transhumanist group were -- depending on who you talk to -- the cryonauts or the extropians.  While strictly speaking it's not possible to become a cryonaut without a machine, there's nothing about ""becoming a machine"" in becoming a human meatsicle.  The extropians on the other hand were explicitly all about pharmaceuticals and/or genetic manipulation for augmented intelligence.  No matter how you cut it; by definition a transhuman being is human.  Whatever else he/she/it may have become, it is still every bit as much human as we are apes.

He's trying to find a way to go in and repair damage on a cellular level after it's been done.  This research is looking at the genetics of aging, trying to look at different animals that age at different rates for reasons we don't fully understand and try to figure out why.  They've identified one gene that, at least in worms, seems to be a on/off switch for a lot of aging genes; by changing that one gene in worms, you can slow aging by half.  It's not clear yet if changing that gene or inhibiting it with drugs will have the same effect on higher animals, but it's very possible.     But, yeah; this is a very different research path.   There are a number of hypothetical ways we might be able to do something about aging; Grey's research is just one of them.

I would imagine the next Playstation and Xbox offerings (and possibly Steam box) will build upon the Kinect and Oculus Rift to a degree and offer some rudimentary VR headset and perhaps some sort of body-sensing apparatus, but it's still a long ways off from SAO's headsets.  Actually, I agree with you and wouldn't think that legally it would work as it seems to intercept your nervous system's signals.  I would think we'd see more development of ""walking in place"" gaming.  One thing that I worry about is motion sickness.  It seems to be a problem with the Rift - if you've worked on it, what do you think?  I don't have problems with motion sickness but I know many that do. It certainly wouldn't stop a majority of people from playing the latest immersive game, but it might shut out some people.  On the flipside, forcing people to move in real life would also shut out those that might have disabilities.  A wheelchair bound person couldn't play with the same controls... We could see some neuron interception there though, which would have widespread medical ramifications for prosthesis."
Transhuman,29cu3d,FazedOut,2,Sun Jun 29 03:57:13 2014 UTC,"So I'll start with the tech. Noninvasive BCI output sensors exist and they are used frequently in the medical field and for research. The input sensors exist but only invasive ones that require surgery... there is research on building these and they should exist within the next 5 years (probably on the sooner side). Then the legal stuff for the tech will take at least 3 years, so I'd say between 5 and 15 years leaning towards 10. So ps5 might think about a add on but be near end of gen.  On the near future and the rift. For the rift dk 1 I've found that many games have no issues with motion at all. There are the ones that screw it up though... they're still not as bad as the stuff from the 90`s but... yeah. The dk 2 was incredible when I tested it but I haven't got to stress test it yet.  The next innovations involving VR will be in interfaces. I personally think the BCI output is the best experience, especially out of the ones I've tried."

Identity can also be destroyed: if you get severe amnesia which erases your memories and alters your personality, then it could be said that a different person now lives in your body. Neither of these scenarios is likely to occur with humans, but if a digital AI can easily copy or delete itself, we might want it to identify itself with all its copies.

Better anti-poverty programs usually involve buying food locally in the third world to give to people, which supports local farmers and markets, and helping local farmers get better yields from their croplands, as well as improving local water supplies and education and health and so on.  The long term goal of any anti-poverty program should be it's own obsolescence, raising the standard of living of people and getting local economies growing to the poor where it's not necessary any more.   Shipping food to people doesn't do that.

A lot of people come here because Terrence McKenna said some nice things about his last acid trip, and this really isn't the place to discuss that.

On the micro-scale (sub 1mm3) connections are created procedurally, based on statistical connectivity data obtained from several sources: cat primary visual cortex, rat and mouse thalamus, etc. In addition to the connectivity statistic, where data does not exist, neurons are wired based on experimentally observed ""rules"" such as ""Peters rule"".  Finally, for simulations where retina is involved (such as the simulation in the linked video), there is an artificial retina module which is actually separate from the main ""brain"" module and it sends output (spikes) to the thalamus, where visual signal is ""relayed"" to the visual cortex.   Retinal ganglion cells (""output"" neurons of the retina) are wired ""topographically"" to the thalamic cells and thalamocortical relay neurons project to V1 visual cortex with topographic projections (this has been achieved by ""flattening"" the visual cortex and computing UV coordinates which are typically used for texture-mapping in 3D rendering - here, we use UV coordinates to guide the thalamic neurons to the right position in the visual cortex.  I hope this helps."

Can we use your simulation as prediction of some model? Do we have data to check against?

Transhuman,28fucz,Pas__,5,Thu Jun 26 20:30:05 2014 UTC,"I am not a neuroscientist, computational neuroscience is just my hobby, so please do not take my response as authoritative in any way.  DigiCortex uses some simple rules for neural plasticity (voltage-dependent spike-timing dependent plasticity, or vSTDP). But even with those simple plasticity rules, after just few minutes of ""watching"" natural video, the simulated neurons in primary visual cortex start obtaining orientation sensitivity (they start firing only if the signal they are presented with looks like a line, and only if it is under the specific angle).  After few hours of ""watching"" video, most of the sensory neurons in V1 are orientation-tuned, and the tuning ""distribution"" across the visual cortex (looking like ""pinwheel"") looks not unlike the the ""real"" thing in the brains of mice, rats, cats and - humans.  So far so good. Unfortunately, I am very busy with my regular work in the last months, which prevented me from getting further. I would expect that ""higher"" visual cortices also acquire ""tuning"" but in more complex ways, since their input is not thalamic-drive (visual signal) but rather the output of the so-called ""simple"" cells from V1, which are orientation tuned. Cells ""higher up"" are more complex in their response - they respond to beginning/ending lines, curves and progressively more complex stimuli.  In the Van Essen's diagram you linked, cells at the level AITd/AITv are sensitive to faces, for example. So far nobody got that far in a simulated multi-stage model of vision, since we are likely missing quite a lot of data, despite the fact that the vision is the most studied part of neuroscience. Needless to say, getting there would be a huge step for the neuroscience and AI. But it is impossible to say how long will it take to get there.  As for the computational resources - SpikeFun is using two models of neuron:    Adaptive Quadratic Integrate & Fire (also known as ""Izhikevich"" model) Adaptive Exponential Integrate & Fire (also known as ""Brette-Gerstner"" model)   In both case, cells are modeled with multiple compartments (in the video from the first post, average number of compartments is 7 per neuron (but it can be much higher of course). Each compartment is modelled either as a ""ball"" (soma) or cylinder (dendrite) along with branching, apical dendrites etc.  The above two neuron models are two-dimensional reductions of the HH model. So they are not as precise as HH, but they are significantly less complex (on an order of magnitude in FLOPS). Regardless their relative simplicity, they are still able to predict spikes with good accuracy. For example, in AdEx model tests, with some tuning it was still possible to predict 96% of the spikes of the original HH model of the same cell  (Layer V Pyramidal cell)"
Transhuman,28fucz,psyq321,3,Fri Jun 27 22:39:08 2014 UTC,"Thanks again for the details, amazing, especially for ""just"" a hobby!   the tuning ""distribution"" across the visual cortex (looking like ""pinwheel"") looks not unlike the the ""real"" thing   What sort of data can you compare this to?

Transhuman,28fucz,Pas__,4,Sun Jun 29 12:02:31 2014 UTC,"fMRI is not really useful for recording orientation tuning, as its ""resolution"" is too crude.  Orientation maps were obtained by means of autoradiography and with using of the voltage-sensitive dye. I suggest Hubel's seminal ""Eye, Brain and Vision"" book (http://hubel.med.harvard.edu/), the process is described in chapter ""Orientation Columns"".  http://hubel.med.harvard.edu/book/bcontex.htm  As for the two-dimensional neuron models, right now it is still hard to say what level of complexity is needed in order to replicate the minimal behavior required for simulating intelligent behavior. In order to be able to answer this question we must first design something that actually works, and this has been not yet achieved.  Human Brain Project, for example, aims to model cortical circuits on the level of ion channels, using models of individual neurons with thousands of compartments. But so far, they are yet to actually replicate some biological function.  On the other hand, there are efforts by companies such as Brain Corporation, which focus on simplified models of neurons to achieve useful function for e.g. robotics. They announced that their models are capturing some of the biological function such as acquisition of orientation tuning, emergence of bottom-up saliency, but they are yet to come up with products that do something useful IMHO."

One involves eavesdropping on single nerve cells in anesthetized and conscious animals in order to see “the things roiling underneath the sea of activity” within a neuron when the animal is unconscious. Boyden said, “It literally sheds light on what it means to have thoughts and awareness and feelings.”   It metaphorically shines light on our neuroscientific versions of those concepts. But even if we established causal relationships between these patterns of activity and thoughts, awareness, or feelings, that wouldn't show that they're identical. As long as it's possible for one to occur without the other, they can't be the same thing. For that matter, if one can occur without the other, then its hard to say how one causes the other either. I'm not saying this is possible, just that it's something any theory (not observation) needs to address in explaining ""what it means"" to have these states of mind."

Transhuman,28b5o9,Abunuwasi,8,Mon Jun 16 20:33:26 2014 UTC,"We stop being human and start being transhuman when we stop using technology exclusively in the extended phenotype and start using it in the standard phenotype -- for purposes other than rehabilitation.  When we transform the innate, healthy phenotype from that which is confined to the limits of fallow biology and start moving beyond that limit, then we cease being ""merely"" human and become something more.  We do not cease to be human; we lose nothing of what we were.  We become more."
Transhuman,28b5o9,IConrad,4,Mon Jun 16 23:35:16 2014 UTC,"I get your point, nevertheless I don't think that there is any such thing as the innate natural healthy phenotype. Where do you draw the line between standard and extended phenotype? What is often described as innate healthy phenotype is just an average extrapolation of gene-organism-environment network dynamics in populations of species."
Transhuman,28b5o9,IConrad,3,Mon Jun 16 23:51:22 2014 UTC,"The extended phenotype is all the stuff that happens outside of the body. The innate phenotype is what happens without stuff outside of the body.  It's a pretty clear delineator.  Case in point: We often hear the assertion that human lifespans have more than doubled since the neolithic era. That the average life expectancy was 25-40 (depending on your figures).  This is of course a misnomer. It is not that these numbers were invalid; but rather that they conceal the massive/widespread infant mortality of the era.  Your remaining life expectancy at age 25, 5,000 years ago, was remarkably similar to your remaining life expectancy today.  Above and beyond which, to date the recorded longest lived person lived 122 years. This number is exceptional by a single digit of years from other ""record holders"" throughout the centuries.  So the innate phenotype characteristic of human longevity is pretty fixed, and pretty obvious.  If we were to add, say, 50 years to that score -- and add them all as healthy years (I.e.; early or middle life years rather than senescent years) -- then that would be a radical transformation of the human existence, despite being relatively trivial in nature.  Introducing new capacities or experiences that could not exist without the facilitation of technology -- that is, the experiences themselves depend on continued access to the fruits of said tech if not the tech itself -- that is clear-cut.  If I have a brain chip that allows me to see four base colors instead of three, and I lose that chip -- I lose that capacity. If we develop a means of artificially creating heritable memories, so that we can inject person A with a drug, extract said drug say a month later, and then inject its derivative into Person B, granting person B all the memories of person A -- then that, too, is transformative.  These are things the ""fallow biology"" is not capable of.  No matter how much we might try to compensate for it by doing things outside of ourselves, we cannot meet those demands/limits without modifying ourselves."
Transhuman,28b5o9,MisanthropeX,2,Tue Jun 17 15:11:29 2014 UTC,"I don't think you can ""stop"" being human and ""start"" being transhuman. Inherent in the word transhuman is the idea of it being a transitional stage between ""human"" and ""posthuman"". I recall Nietzsche's saying: ""Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the ubermensch- a rope over an abyss."" In this analogy, the ""base"" human is the animal and what Nietzsche refers to as ""man"" is actually the transhuman.  Throughout human history we have been transhuman- human history is indeed a product of transhumanism, as writing and recording history is a technology and a skill. We think of the ""transhuman"" as necessarily being cybernetically augmented or genetically perfect like something out of a cyberpunk film, but in reality, everyone with glasses or everyone who uses a tool to accomplish a goal that their body cannot is transhuman. Our ancestors who used spears to hunt mammoths were transhuman because the human body does not have pointy, killing parts. Certainly we are not closer to the posthuman than they were, but they were beyond the ""baseline"" human, too."
Transhuman,28b5o9,IConrad,3,Tue Jun 17 00:17:22 2014 UTC,"I don't think you can ""stop"" being human and ""start"" being transhuman.   Which would be why I said 'cease being ""merely"" human and become something more.  We do not cease to be human; we lose nothing of what we were. We become more.'  However:   Throughout human history we have been transhuman- human history is indeed a product of transhumanism, as writing and recording history is a technology and a skill.   No.  The divide between the merely human and the transhuman state is expressed through the integration of technological advances within the inherent phenotype, and not merely within the extended phenotype.  A transhuman being would be unlike a human being regardless of the tools at their disposal. They would have advantages over all non transhumans who had the same tools or materials available to them.   Our ancestors who used spears to hunt mammoths were transhuman because the human body does not have pointy, killing parts.   To be human is, at its core, to have completely mastered the ability of acquiring materials from one's environment in order to manifest an effectively unlimited extended phenotype. To be transhuman is to redirect that capacity inwards to modify the integral nature of what it means to be human.     Certainly we are not closer to the posthuman than they were, but they were beyond the ""baseline"" human, too.   They -- and we -- are baseline human."

A genetic modification to allow the perception of a fourth basal color.  A drug, say, that eliminates the need for sleep in perpetuity.  A microchip that grants those implanted with it the inherent capacity -- in the same sense as hearing, smelling, touching, or looking -- to perceive one's own thoughts and reactions.   Clinical immortality or longevity extension. Nootropics. Raw physical biological ability augmentation. Biological supplementation/replacement with electromechanical devices. Nanitic integration.

Transhuman,28b5o9,whynotpizza,3,Tue Jun 17 04:20:54 2014 UTC,"I think you're coming at it from the wrong direction. Transhuman isn't a distinct thing, and it heavily derives from the evolution with it's equally ambiguous species delineations. Today I can walk down the street and point at other things walking down the street, and chances are we will both agree on whether or not those things are human. Tens of thousands of years ago if you and I walked along some river, we might not be in agreement. Hundreds of thousands of years ago and we'll probably be back to agreeing again. You can consider the interim of disagreement as 'trans-protohuman', and the same applies projected forward. At some point we might share the street with cyborgs and we may disagree on where the line lies between human/nonhuman. Going further into the future we'd probably be back to certainty.  The reality is humans like discrete categories like 'human' or 'posthuman', but we live in a world of continuous distributions. So we're forced to categorize along boundaries that suit our goals of categorization. The question isn't ""what's transhuman and what's not"". The question is ""what population are you surveying over time and space, and are you trying to find out about the population"", with varying definitions of population. You might come from a sexual perspective where you define a set of reference humans, and everything that can procreate with at least one reference and create another entity capable of procreating with at least one reference as being 'human'. You might select some references and say anything they look at and respond to with strong emotions is also 'human' (ala uncanny valley). Every experiment will end up stacking more and more exceptions along whichever line they're trying to draw. In the first case, you might want to exclude humans using artificial insemination or you might draw the line at excluding nanobot swarms with backwards-compatible sperm-factories. In the second you might restrict the population based on sentience (no adorable japanese toy robots) or you might explicitly ignore sentience to explore relations with evolving technologies.  Today we are human because we decide the term, and society has come to agreement on the general definition of the term. As our society evolves so will the term. Even today there are things we would also consider human, but would not consider us human (eg some populations from thousands of years ago would probably worship some guy with a water-jetpack as god). It's all about how far we can envision and what lines we want to draw."

To be human encompasses a certain family of attributes. In this way a human is different than a squirrel. A human with all the same capabilities of someone from 1900, but with nanomachines repairing and regulating their body on a cellular level would still probably be thought of more as a human than a cyborg. A human with those nanomachines that is then capable of things beyond human capability might be thought of as a cyborg more than a human."
Transhuman,28b5o9,whynotpizza,1 point,Tue Jun 17 21:02:32 2014 UTC,"That's my point, we can't treat terms like 'human' as discrete immutable categories because those categories don't exist. They evolve with their society and the opinions of that society, forever fluidly adapting. They're only useful with a common frame of reference for interpretation. Your example (though it ends up contradicting itself) highlights that very well. If we had nanobots that allowed a 1900 human to survive an axe to the head, most people today would probably still call that person a human. But on the other hand, if we went to 1900 and showed off this human... people would lose their shit. For a little bit. But we once we explained how the black magic worked, the sequence of scientific discoveries and mechanics behind nanobots, they'd consider that person a human again. From today, we can't say how long our genetic/mechanical/hybrid children will be considered children because the same applies to us. We don't have a common frame of reference with the future, and as a subreddit we share a common reference that's slightly further into the future than the average person's. I think ultimately we will consider any entity to be human if at some point it was physically and genetically similar to us, but that just raises the question of how dramatic those changes can be... and then we're back to trying to predict the unpredicatable."

Let's say there are an average of three states: flesh, machine, and data. Each state can operate simultaneously and independently of the others but all identify themselves as the same individual. Flesh and Machine interact with the physical world but Data resides solely in the hivemind. The Data state would serve as an access point, like a modem on a network, and act as a buffer for the flesh and the machine. Flesh would be the body that the individual originates, modified and enhanced in all of its borgy ways. Machine would be more like a ghost from ghost in the shell, able to occupy and control complete systems to pilot cubes or operate weapons or manage satellites or what have you. Since all three identify as the same individual, all three freely share feelings, thoughts, purpose, etc. with each other. With the Data state acting as a buffer, the individual would be able to share itself with the hivemind and not lose its individuality. It down- or upchannels information it wants to the flesh and machine according to the individual's personality and the personality is reinforced by having the other states.  That's a lot longer than I thought it'd be."

But unlike most examples of transhumanism the Uberman transcends by natural means rather than by cybernetics.   The guy in the video seems to get the concept of pain and struggle wrong. He is right in that uncontrollable pain and struggle are associated with lower mood. But this lower mood is caused by the inability to increase one's strength.   Happiness is a cause of strength. Strength is gained by struggling with and controlling increasing increments of resistance. In all cases the resistance needs to be just below the threshold of uncontrollable to achieve maximum results. If the resistance rises above the threshold and becomes uncontrollable then it is no longer beneficial.   EDIT: typo

He believes and promotes the idea that there exists a strong ethical imperative for humans to work towards the abolition of suffering in all sentient life. His book-length internet manifesto The Hedonistic Imperative  outlines how technologies such as genetic engineering, nanotechnology, pharmacology, and neurosurgery could potentially converge to eliminate all forms of unpleasant experience among human and non-human animals, replacing suffering with gradients of well-being, a project he refers to as ""paradise engineering"".  A transhumanist and a vegan,  Pearce believes that we (or future evolutions of humans) have a responsibility not only to avoid cruelty to animals within human society but also to redesign the global ecosystem so that animals do not suffer in the wild.

Thus dopaminergic stimulants like cocaine and the amphetamines tend to boost the capacity to anticipate happiness more than happiness itself. What I wanted to do was highlight the tension in transhumanist thought between the extreme social Darwinism of Nietzscheans and the more compassionate strand of transhumanism. Perhaps compare the commitment to the well-being of all sentience expressed in the Transhumanist Declaration (1998, 2009) http://humanityplus.org/philosophy/transhumanist-declaration/ with Nietzsche's stark claims in Beyond Good and Evil: ""You want, if possible - and there is no more insane ""if possible"" - to abolish suffering. And we? It really seems that we would rather have it higher and worse than ever. Well-being as you understand it - that is no goal, that seems to us an end, a state that soon makes man ridiculous and contemptible - that makes his destruction desirable. The discipline of suffering, of great suffering - do you not know that only this discipline has created all enhancements of man so far?""

We know how neurons work to create brains in simple animals and we know as the number of connections and number of neurons increase we increase complexity of behavior.  There's no point where a threshold is crossed where we need to add quantum mechanics.  Besides that, even if quantum mechanical effects were happening in microtubles, so what?  Neoronal signals are threshold events.  Why do we need to have a threshold that's reached by mircotubles--a threshold very dubious and complicated--when ion concentrations can do the same thing in a simple, well characterized process?  Furthermore, neuronal signaling is relatively slow.  If nearly-instant quantum processes were doing the brain's heavy lifting, why would the brain still work at the speed of ion diffusion?    There's no even decent evidence that quantum processes are involved in consciousness.  There's no proposed mechanism for how it would work.  There's no reason to think quantum processes would be necessary or helpful. There's mountains of strong evidence that shows that brains work in a way consistent with conventional neuroscience.

The most notable drop, and I assume the reason for the chart itself, is the natural resource of oil which they estimated tanking in availability by 2030.

That is the contemporary limit to growth. We know how to evade that limit, but again it is political will that is lacking.   The laws of thermodynamics might be the oldest, least controversial and most implacable facets of the universe. Every car engine, every computer, every power plant, every chemical reaction confirms the basic nature of entropy and energy as we understand it. Time travel is more feasible than besting thermodynamics.   Of course thermodynamics is not kinetics and someday is not tomorrow, which is where growth comes in.   we might run short on copper, but we will never be short of Aluminum since it makes up a substantial portion of the mass of rocks.    Famous last words. Exponential growth is a cruel bitch and has a tendency to sneak up on all but the most wary. He correctly cites the three percent growth rate earlier in the article that has characterised the industrial age for the past three hundred years. Current aluminium production is .3 trillionths of everything present in the Earth's crust or roughly 40 doubling periods until we have utilised all of the aluminium available without literally dismantling the Earth. At a three percent growth rate we are talking about eight hundred years, not a inconceivably long time especially when we regularly consider things like radical life extension on this forum. Energy growth runs in to similarly absurd problems; oceans boiling in several hundred years; the surface of the Earth being hotter than the sun in a thousand. Be it windmills or cold fusion, these are inescapable consequences of growth.  He makes claims of the coming information economy, this carries with it two defects. First, information processing has a thermodynamic cost, the same absurd consequences follow growth here as anywhere else. Second, there is the increasing tendency to jettison these consequences by also jettisoning the creation of use value. The two sectors of the economy that have grown steadily through the current round of crises are finances and information technology. The total circulation taking place under the guise of 'finance' verges on a quadrillion dollars. Several orders of magnitude larger than the global GDP. The sums being shuffled around are divorced from reality and divorced from the production of anything that can reasonably be considered wealth. When Facebook purchased Instagram for a billion dollars (a sum that can build a hotel and convention center the envy of any city or put 260,000 kg into low Earth orbit) it highlighted a similar disconnect taking place in IT; the supposed economic growth is not producing anything of value.  Finally, he treats technology as sort of cosmological constant, a neat factor thrown in to make the equations work. Technology is not magic, it obeys the same dictates as the rest of nature and how advances borne out of the discover of such dictates inspires people to completely ignore their existence may be the greatest irony of our time.    The first is the substitution of rare materials for more common ones, usually as a result of applying advanced technology to the problem.   This is using technology in a commoditized form that can be inserted to hand wave away some difficulty that poses a threat to his argument. It enables him to make ridiculous assumptions such as the cost of recycling a product being necessarily less than that of its initial manufacture. Plenty of things, e.g. thermosetting polymers or spent fuel require a much larger investment of energy to restore to a useable state than it did initially. He admits that a massive amount of energy is necessary to accomplish this but sidesteps that the inevitable conclusion that energy carries with it a cost. The only way it wouldn't is in a society in which energy is not a scarce resource which would necessarily be a steady state society not constrained by the need to grow."

Computing efficiency in terms of energy is at least ten orders of magnitude from where we are now - that's quite some scope to continue to grow an information economy.

Transhuman,26nbid,Alexandertheape,8,Wed May 28 16:37:33 2014 UTC,"You have no idea what you are talking about, obviously. If you spent countless nights tossing and turning, waking up sweating and sobbing, gritting your teeth, and someone offered to help you deal with it, you'd leap at the opportunity.  The thing is, PTSD is literally burned into the neural pathways of your brain. The images are physically seared into you. As are the emotions, the smells, the reactions. If all that can be burned over with less painful things, there are literally millions of men and women who are already suffering who we can help. And taht help could be extended to PTSD sufferes elsewhere. Schildren in Palestine could grow up without wanting revenge for what they went throgh as kids when they grow up. Chidlren in Africa who were kidnapped and used as soldiers could change their world. Rape victims could be helped without chemicals.  The point of this is to literally let the brain heal itself, not mind control.  It's sort of like muscle memory. You can relearn things your muscles have learned to do so that your body can be more efficient. You never unlearn what you first learned, but you can teach your brain to ignore the old lessons and use the new. If we can teach the brain to ignore our old traumas mroe easily, we can help PTSD sufferers overcome it much more easily. We can do it now, but at great cost, and with many suicides along the way. This has cost countless lives in unneccessary and awful ways.   As a vet with PTSD I applaud DARPA taking the initiative to do something the civiilan health care industry could care less about. THIS is why we have a government. To do things capitalism won't."

Transhuman,26nbid,katethree,1 point,Fri May 30 04:54:34 2014 UTC,"I understand your concern, but keep in mind that senior soldiers don't get to be senior soldiers (thus decision makers) without combat experience. Generally they have all dealt with PTSD themselves. Eric Shinseki, a former Army Chief of Staff, and now the leader of the VA, had his foot blown off in Vietnam, for example. Having experienced the suffering tends to make them very wary of exposing their soldiers to things that they don't have to. The military tends to be very conservative about implementing things that will cause themselves pain. The last two wars, for example, were fought very conservatively in terms of exposure of our troops. It may not seem that way to the public at large, but I assure you that reducing injuury in every way is at the forefront of their minds at all times. In fact, the military resisted major decisions based on using less troops at the beginning of both invasions because it was felt it would lead to higher casualties overall. Which it did. Civilians made those decisions, and the military was forced to go along because of a groundswell of public support by people who had no idea what they were talking about.  If this was to happen, it would be because senior civilians decided it was a good idea. Civilian leaders are generally elected. One would hope that the American people would stand up for their kids if any civilian was stupid enough to announce that, now that we don't have to worry about PTSD any more, we can now expose them to more dangerous situations.  Surely there would be enough argument about the subject to put the breaks on abusing it (It happens all the time, like the anthrax vaccine argument, or armor for troops, and armor for HUMVEES.)  That's sort of counter intuitive, if you see what I mean. Real life is not like Avatar. In real life the things that cause PTSD generally carry a casualty rate, and the miltary doesn't like casualties of any sort, no matter how much civilians think they do. Wounds reduce fighting strength. PTSD is a wound that reduced fighting strength.  PTSD is bad, will always be bad. This just offers a way to help soldiers recover from things they can't avoid. It doesn't suddenly give our leaders a blank check to abuse us."

Very well researched book by a serious journalist.   It's a bit of a shame that he doesn't talk about  Aubrey De Grey except for a brief mention in the epilog, but it's still a good read.  Frankenstein's Cat: Cuddling Up to Biotech's Brave New Beasts  by Emily Anthes http://www.amazon.com/Frankensteins-Cat-Cuddling-Biotechs-Beasts/dp/0374158592 Doesn't deal with transhumanism specifically, but gives a good outline of what we're able to do with animals in terms of biotech now; genetic engineering of animals, cloning, cyborg animals, and so on.   It's pretty amazing how much we're doing right now.  Edit: Another good thing to look up is FM2030; to a large extent, he started the transhumanist movement, in the 1980's and 1990's.

A work of unprecedented scale in the genre, it describes the history of humanity from the present onwards across two billion years and eighteen distinct human species, of which our own is the first. Stapledon's conception of history is based on the Hegelian Dialectic, following a repetitive cycle with many varied civilisations rising from and descending back into savagery over millions of years, but it is also one of progress, as the later civilisations rise to far greater heights than the first. The book anticipates the science of genetic engineering, and is an early example of the fictional supermind; a consciousness composed of many telepathically-linked individuals.

I think that aging is finely tuned to get just the balance of maximum age, chance to die of non-aging causes, frequency of and how many children you get. If we live to long the population would quickly, resources would deplete and we'd die of various diseases. If a species developed eternal life, but still birthed children with a higher frequency than they die of other causes, it's easy to see the problem.  If this evolutionary mechanism is correct, it would mean aging is a basic function of all life, and thus probably coded for early, and it probably has redundancies built in as well."
Transhuman,269734,linuxjava,9,Fri May 23 22:49:48 2014 UTC,"Natural selection hasn't had sufficient pressure to fix (read ""extend"") the lifespan.  The current pressure is entirely what advantages the elderly can grant to their descendants.  E.g. a multimillionaire grandparent (or great-grandparent) can fiance resources to make life easier (better nutrition, better health, access to education, connections, etc).  But people with comfortable parents can probably get these things anyway, so this has been a very very modest survival advantage.  And this doesn't factor in how much ""faster"" people aged even just 100 years ago.  There is a lot of truth to the fact that 60's is the new 40's (life expectancy is roughly 78 years in America, it was 47 in 1900).  Between better nutriention and better medicine (including vaccination) allow us to grow up healthier which greatly extends our lives (the Roman Empire kept detailed records of life expectancy based on current age).  It is obvious why a better built machine can operate longer.  Getting sick a lot as a child isn't that different from having product defects in a unit (say air bubbles in the thin wire of a spectacles frame, the wire should be durable, but the air bubble changes how it flexes and instead it snaps).  To truly select for extended lifespan it would take a huge realignment of family planning.  For example, if every human in the world started delaying having children until they were at least 40 years old.  The resulting lower viability would select for a few key things:   Women that are more physically able to bear children at a later age.  FYI: many modern hospitals in America consider a mother being 30+ years old a ""complication"" even when the birth itself has no other complications.

Further I would argue that the species of Earth are themselves evidence that consciousness is not unique to humans, and may be an inevitable byproduct of any evolutionary chaotic system, regardless of what forms of matter are used to constitute it.

This is fundamentally what Christianity is warning us about. We have the choice to learn all of this information but it is a major gamble. We don't get to be lazy anymore because we took the reins from the gods. We put ourselves in control of the planet with our drive towards knowledge.  This is not just a Christian idea, it's a universal truth. Understand how to manipulate your environment and you can and you will. That said, valuing these warnings against knowledge as such (instead of on a pedestal that only the great ""Bible"" can sit on) reveals the double edge sword that innovation presents but is not a final word on the value and utility of our work. A great change will be resisted by some, as well as causing others to perish. These are very real and difficult trade-offs that are decided by us in some ways and decided beyond our human faculties in other ways. Awareness of the transaction is key though.  Since the foundation of Christianity, we've seen first-hand the lack of meaning to life through an absurd history. Technology is at least of hope of transcendence. Without our direct technology, are we just going to wait generations for our DNA to evolve a transcendent being with (by our current understanding) ""magical"" qualities?

Seung proposes that through the study of the connectome we can test whether ideas such as freezing ourselves or uploading our brains on to computers are even possible."
Transhuman,258x1n,Ntorpy,2,Sun May 11 00:51:30 2014 UTC,I read a review of Seung's book here by Mo Costandi. He is very harsh and disrespectful but makes some interesting points against the connectome and its importance.
Transhuman,258x1n,Ntorpy,1 point,Sun May 11 09:33:40 2014 UTC,"Thanks for linking to Mo Costandi's Anti-connectom-ism review. As you said, he makes some interesting points. I didn't find his critical comments as convincing arguments though. They seem insufficient to establish a solid position for anti-connectom-ism. In my view, the posted review makes only three serious critical comments about Seung's work on connectomes.   A connectome would only provide a static connectivity map. It would tell us nothing about how brains continuously make organizational changes. Epigenetic modifications can regulate the activity of gene expression patterns. Glial cells likely also contribute to information processing.   These all seem to me like tweaks to the essential theory, rather than arguments against it. In a worst case scenario, according to the criticisms made in the review, a successful connectome used for uploading a mind would only achieve a static version of that mind. That would still become a major success story in my book.   Imagine if we could capture and preserve the knowledge and intelligence of our greatest minds before they die, instead of losing our ability to interact with those minds from our world forever. Today, we can only interact with their recorded works. We can't have conversational interactions with them.  It wouldn't matter that much if their connectome would remain static. In fact, that could have some benefits. Any physicist could carry on a conversation with someone like Einstein on a daily basis, but would have to remember that the uploaded brain could not know about the work of physicists since the time of the upload. That could still provide tremendous value to science.  Furthermore, by embracing these criticisms raised in the review as tweaks to the theory, by the time we get to when we could possibly see brain uploading as more real than sci-fi, the process could also enable the uploaded connectome to continue developing and reorganizing. None of these criticisms seem to remove the connectome from the picture. Thus, I don't think they provide a good rationale to stop funding SS's work.  The included email message from Andrew Lumsden raises a different issue. It doesn't attack SS for his work on connectomes. It attacks the methodology his lab uses to create the mapping and advocates using retrograde monosynaptic tracers instead. This seems more supportive to the basic theory of connectomes than a criticism in favor of anti-connectom-ism. It merely quibbles with the technology used to achieve the mapping."

Also people already solve the problems robots encounter so a similar approach would be to have people help train the robots brain with feedback.  Again using a simulation and crowd approach to allow faster iteration.
Transhuman,24zahl,maddhatter919,10,Wed May 7 20:09:51 2014 UTC,"Good blog, but it misses a few opportunities.   Chloroplasts only use some of the visible light spectrum.  If we are going to put these in our bodies, we might as well make it better first.  Why not expand it beyond the visible light spectrum.  Photosynthetic efficiency The higher water consumption is valid, but that can be throttled by covering up. The UV concern is valid, even if the chloroplast can activate on UV, it is basically a chloroplast tattoo still under a layer of skin, and that outer layer of skin can still get burned/cancer.  So why not re-engineer our skin as well to make it UV resistant? Why can't people eat food AND use photosynthesize?  It would certainly help for disasters (emergency aid brings in water rather than water and food).  The calorie requirements for an active person are significantly higher than someone just laying there. If we are making super chloroplast, why not also put it in plants that we already grow?  (a) It would help the plants we want to resist weeds (as they grow faster).  (b) It would help take CO2 out of the air."
Transhuman,24zahl,InFearn0,1 point,Wed May 7 22:39:53 2014 UTC,"Plants also have an ability to turn UV light into energy, which could be useful in this case.  Since chloroplasts only absorb a portion of the visible spectrum, some plants use additional compounds like carotenoids to pump the energy from the higher energy UV radiation down to wavelengths that chloroplasts can use. This works because the fluorescence process emits light of a lower energy than that used to excite the compound.  On my phone so could only find this link to support it, but if you look there are surely better citations out there :p  http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/library/plant_biology/Ch7.html"
Transhuman,24zahl,Fluorophore1,1 point,Thu May 8 08:05:35 2014 UTC,"Photosynthetic efficiency:  NSFW ?      The photosynthetic efficiency is the fraction of light energy converted into chemical energy during photosynthesis in plants and algae. Photosynthesis can be described by the simplified chemical reaction   6H2O + 6CO2 + energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2   where C6H12O6 is glucose (which is subsequently transformed into other sugars, cellulose, lignin, and so forth). The value of the photosynthetic efficiency is dependent on how light energy is defined – it depends on whether we count only the light that is absorbed, and on what kind of light is used (see Photosynthetically active radiation). It takes eight (or perhaps 10 or more ) photons to utilize one molecule of CO2. The Gibbs free energy for converting a mole of CO2 to glucose is 114 kcal, whereas eight moles of photons of wavelength 600 nm contains 381 kcal, giving a nominal efficiency of 30%.  However, photosynthesis can occur with light up to wavelength 720 nm so long as there is also light at wavelengths below 680 nm to keep Photosystem II operating (see Chlorophyll). Using longer wavelengths means less light energy is needed for the same number of photons and therefore for the same amount of photosynthesis. For actual sunlight, where only 45% of the light is in the photosynthetically active wavelength range, the theoretical maximum efficiency of solar energy conversion is approximately 11%. In actuality, however, plants do not absorb all incoming sunlight (due to reflection, respiration requirements of photosynthesis and the need for optimal solar radiation levels) and do not convert all harvested energy into biomass, which results in an overall photosynthetic efficiency of 3 to 6% of total solar radiation.  If photosynthesis is inefficient, excess light energy must be dissipated to avoid damaging the photosynthetic apparatus. Energy can be dissipated as heat (non-photochemical quenching), or emitted as chlorophyll fluorescence.

I'd like to add, however, that there's an idea for a solution (that, full disclosure, I've used in my own fiction) called Ent Protocol where chlorophyllated humans are only active for a few hours/minutes a day to save energy, or else function at a much lower ""clock speed"" of cognition to conserve energy.  This would also be fascinating as a means of preserving life in people who are stranded somewhere and can't get help for some extended period but have access to sunlight, as well as a means of (combined with food intake) enabling some truly phenomenal feats of athleticism."
Transhuman,24zahl,Lacquerhead,2,Thu May 8 01:02:20 2014 UTC,"Well, a low activity person can survive 3 weeks without food but only 3 days without water.  So in that case, if water can't be replenished it is better to conserve water by lying still and throttling down the photosynthesis than it is to move around (use up calories and generate extra heat which needs to be cooled by sweating).  The 4 3's are: 3 minutes without air, 3 hours without shelter in inclement weather, 3 days of low activity without water, 3 weeks of low activity without food.  That is part of why Survivor is a bullshit show.  In a real survival situation you never stand when you can sit, never sit when you can lay down, and you never move unless it is to save your life or get food/water (ideally at least as many calories as you use up).  Containers are important because they allow you to stray further from water and carry supplies outside of your stomach."

So, in order to ""be"" a human in a virtual reality one would have to experience it embodied in a human body. To do otherwise would be something that is not human.

As for options, chronic pain is a complicated thing, as I'm sure you know far better than I do.  From what I know there are 3 broad approaches:  1) stop the pain source.  For example, localized novocaine injections for dental work or stretching a sore muscle.  More high tech options exist here too like direct neural stimulation.   Sometimes these work, sometimes not.  2)  dull pain sensation in general.  For example, systemic dosing of opiates after surgery.  3) stop/change the interpretation of that specific pain.  For example, therapy and meditation.   Most people I've spoken with who have dealt with chronic pain for a long time have tried zillions of variants of #1 and #2, but not so much on #3.  In some cases, pain seems to manifest less because of any input, but more because of an expectation of input, which creates the perception of input.  This loopy nature is a great thing for neural architecture (we can fill in missing parts of images or garbled audio with our expectations for example), but sucks when that same ""algorithm"" just fills in sensory input with pain.  There is an interesting talk on the topic:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3NmTE-fJSo  The upshot is that it is possible to retrain our brains to stop reenforcing these expect pain<-->perceive pain loops.

There's really no way to bridge the gap between the two; the concepts are too fundamentally opposed to each other. Indefinite life will be the ultimate taboo. It has to be.  Over time, religious dogma has a tendency to get stripped down. Eating pork, wearing sewn fabrics, working on sundays, people slowly determine that these doctrines aren't really important, and ignore them. But imagine if you keep stripping it down, more and more, removing everything you possibly can, you eventually reach the core. Beliefs that are so important, that you can't get rid of them without completely voiding the religion on a conceptual level. I believe it comes down to these three ideas.  God exists.  Our eternal souls exist.  Final judgement exists.  That's the formula that the abrahamic religions are founded on, and that's what allowed them to spread so successfully. Without all three of those, the religion has no power over people. A believer could abandon one of these pillars if it makes them feel more at peace, and it might not seem like much has changed. They still believe, and call themselves christians. But their children won't.   If something is an affront to those precepts, western religion will never be able to reconcile. That's why the number one, most important crisis in America is abortions. A woman can't decide that an embryo has no value, without completely abandoning the concept of eternal souls. This strikes directly at the core of the faith, and so it is just about the most heinous crime they can imagine.  So what about mind uploading? Well, if you think religion gets pretty upset about gay sex and independent women, you haven't seen anything yet.  Living as long as you could ever want to with the power of technology. Is it not, just a brazen attempt to escape god's judgement, to cheat death?   Is it not, a horrible corrupting of the soul, twisting the mind that god created into something wholly unnatural?   Couldn't one say, that even attempting to pull this off, would be to spit in the face of god, to proclaim that you don't need him anymore, and that you are now greater than he? The old myths cease to hold any power over you, because you are no longer ""god-fearing.""  When this technology begins to become a reality, in, let's say 50 years or so, the christians are going to flip their shit. Presumably in the minority by then, backed into a corner, there's going to be another reactionary movement, like the southern evangelicals, only worse. Their faith faces a true existential crisis. Thousands walking into the arms of satan every day. It's the apocalypse. There's going to be preaching of hellfire and brimstone, riots, suicides. Somebody's going to start throwing bombs. It's going to get ugly.  And as edgy and grimdark as all this may seem, it's difficult for me to imagine that it won't happen, on some scale. Humanity thankfully has a proven track record of rapidly mellowing out, as they become more educated and affluent. But that can't happen everywhere.   There's always going to be some regions and communities that are more insular, and a whole lot of damage can be done by very few people. The person who makes the most noise is the person that gets to decide what the ever-evolving doctrines look like in the eyes of the public. Society's backlash against religion will serve to drive more and more reasonable people away from it.  This has expanded quite a bit beyond the original topic, but it seemed kind of necessary in order to explain the problem with the question. It's ultimately nonsensical. It's oil and water, there's no way for these concepts to mix with each other. And even if you don't think things will play out as dramatically as I've portrayed it, at least you can see some of the inherent conflicts at play here."

The scale has three designated categories called Type I, II, and III. A Type I civilization uses all available resources impinging on its home planet, Type II harnesses all the energy of its star, and Type III of its galaxy. The scale is only hypothetical, but it puts energy consumption in a cosmic perspective. It was first proposed in 1964 by the Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev. Various extensions of the scale have been proposed since, from a wider range of power levels (types 0, IV and V) to the use of metrics other than pure power.

Transhuman,24awmc,Hoverbeast,5,Tue Apr 29 19:33:16 2014 UTC,"I would say specializing so early would be a bad idea. If your school has some kind of integrated science program, try to go for something that builds solid fundamentals. Physics/bio/math. Then you can take some introductory mechatronics or nanotechnology courses as electives so that you understand what is feasible and what is fiction. I would stray away from engineering as a major because it will be harder to get a job right out of college in such a niche field. If you are going for PhD (which you really will need to), just make sure you study hard and find a way to show that you have a strong skillset and fundamental knowledge.   Honestly, as general life advice, I would strongly suggest that you do not limit yourself to one tiny field just because you think it's cool now. Your education interests and motivations will change (I guarantee it) and it will be better to use your college education as a resource to learn what is out there, what you are good at, and what you want to achieve in life. Science is amazingly cool if you love knowledge,  but it is definitely not as glamorous as media or fiction portrays it to be.   This is coming from a recent biomedical engineering graduate. I wish I had spent more time searching for what I loved rather than staying on a single track because I thought I had everything figured out. Feel free to PM me if you want to talk more."
Transhuman,24awmc,honglyshin,3,Tue Apr 29 21:42:28 2014 UTC,"The science is awesome conceptually, but in all likelihood, once you become a researcher, you will be working on one tiny facet of the ""awesome.""  So you need to be interested in the problem-solving techniques in the field of study you're in.  Your first year, take 2-3 of the following main introductory sequences: physics, chemistry, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science (pick the ones that interest you most).  If you want, sign up for/audit all five, and in the first couple of weeks, drop the ones you find tedious.  Keep following the major tracks for 1-3 fields and hopefully by the end you'll end up with 1-3 majors+minors.   To do what you're talking about, you're GOING to need a PhD.  To get into a PhD program, you're going to need research experience.  Try to get into a lab your first year.  Research professors at your university, find out what they do, show up at their offices, and beg to work for them.  If they tell you you're too young, keep begging/ask someone else.  Don't worry about getting paid at first.  You'll figure out what major makes most sense as you take classes and get involved in research.  Hopefully by the end of your second year you'll know, and then you can narrow your research interests."

When you start out and only have a fairly small number of users, it may be best to funnel them into a few sub-forums, rather then have 17 forums and most of them only get one or two posts a week or less.   If you start out with less forums, and make them a little more general, you may get more real discussion going and people interacting and responding to each other, and it doesn't make the place feel so empty.   Then when you get enough users you may want to expand again.  Just my two cents, based on some previous experience with forums.    Use or don't as you wish.  Other then that, it looks good."

Transhuman,22lj8l,jennaow,34,Wed Apr 9 10:54:20 2014 UTC,Subhumanism... This is a crappy design with zero useful features. It makes transhumanism look dumb.
Transhuman,22lj8l,bitcloud,3,Wed Apr 9 13:00:57 2014 UTC,"THe point was a proof of concept, to demonstrate that they could put together a device with computer chips, sensors, and an ability to send and receive data, and insert it under your skin, all in a low budget open source way.

Transhuman,22lj8l,Yosarian2,6,Thu Apr 10 09:09:05 2014 UTC,"I think the goal here is to preemptively wreck the body, so when useful augmentations come along it's more difficult to use them."

Transhuman,22lj8l,mitravelus,8,Thu Apr 10 08:13:49 2014 UTC,"Wow /r/transhuman way to be a bunch of judgemental dicks. I know the biohack scene isn't the most beloved part of the community but damn. This is a prototype, it will get smaller but they needed to test what they already had. What you don't realize is that this is a body implant designed by enthusiasts, let that sink in for a second, this is a piece of technology, that can be implanted and function, and it was designed by people who simply had a love for it. If that isn't futuristic I don't know what is.  So while all you sit here and deride this guy for taking this tiny step forward, remember that it's people like him that make this stuff more acceptable to the masses. I don't think I've ever seen a larger group of useless people make fun of someone for at least contributing something. No wonder grinders hate the academia side of transhumanism, bunch a twats you all are."
Transhuman,22lj8l,Slippedhal0,12,Wed Apr 9 16:45:20 2014 UTC,"I don't think people are making fun of the concept, I think what's being criticized is the fact that, for something created in 2013, or even 2012 if the video was made long before that upload, many people seem to think that the 'biochip' is using outdated and unnecessarily large components for something so relatively simple, and that the simple information received makes the implant less efficient than a simple thermometer, which makes it look like this guy didn't put enough work/thought/effort into this obvious first step into pseudo-cybernetics, which in turn reflects badly on the entire concept of transhumanism."
Transhuman,22lj8l,anxiousalpaca,1 point,Wed Apr 9 20:56:31 2014 UTC,Well i'm making fun of the concept. How many times does a young person have higher temperature / fever? Maybe once every couple of years? Such a device is redundant.
Transhuman,22lj8l,Yosarian2,2,Wed Apr 9 23:30:01 2014 UTC,"That's not the concept.  The concept is developing an implantable device that has computer chips, has sensors, and can send and receive data from the outside world.  Obviously the temperature isn't an especially big deal; it's just a proof of concept at this point."
Transhuman,22lj8l,mitravelus,-1,Thu Apr 10 08:29:43 2014 UTC,"Well I don't know what went into the design, I do know the biggest components are the battery, and resonance induction circuit. The battery was big due to having to run bluetooth. I'm not saying I agree with the design of it, but the point is that at least someone is working on it.  The project is called circadia, and the team that put it together has a history of testing concepts every step of the way, just to make sure it works in practice and not just in theory.  Also it should be mentioned that its not just a simple thermometer. I can't remember the list off the top of my head, but it has quite a bit of features. While the technology to design something just as capable, and smaller is readily available, it's also a bit expensive to make it come to fruition. It's worth it to make sure the concept works before dumping a bunch of money into something that might not.  I'm not trying to say this is some feat of technology, or even that you should be impressed by its function. What you should be impressed by is that fact that there are teams of people out there making this stuff happen, and not to turn your nose up at something that amounts to an early alpha."
Transhuman,22lj8l,Uedukai,6,Thu Apr 10 09:11:15 2014 UTC,"Way to generalize all of us, call us twats, etc.  It's a cool idea, but just because someone has a love for it doesn't mean it's the best idea.  If I were him, I'd focus on creating a device far smaller, flexible, etc. before implanting it into my arm.  It's a massive device with useless features.  There is more of a con to this situation than pro."

I'm not saying this is technologically advanced, in fact if you had actually quoted the whole sentence, it refers to public acceptability. I have no delusions on how advanced or not the tech is, or the design, or even the procedure.

You could easily make what he's describing 10x smaller with only a little more effort.  These guys keep getting videos made about their efforts, and it's making me cringe a bit.

I aim to make this a series, and each book will focus on a different principle of transhumanist thought...  Your feedback is excellent, though. If it's not clear I am a pro-technology writer, and this is a pro-technology series, then I need to rectify that.

Transhuman,21u99y,autowikibot,2,Sun May 4 01:49:09 2014 UTC,"Aging is what happens when an object experiences time passing. It's not an accurate measure of the health of cells, or how long an organism will survive.  This particular drug stops visible symptoms of ""old age"" and age related diseases. While this is a single drug that, if it worked similarly in humans, would prevent most healthcare expenses in the United States and other developed nations from having to treat age-related diseases, it doesn't fix the Hayflick limit.  The Hayflick limit is basically the amount of times a cell can reproduce before it stops. This stop in reproduction is because the DNA is exposed to its environment when it's no longer held together by telomeres, and falls apart. Telomeres hold chromosomes together and protect them, but each time a cell divides the telomeres are shared between the two new cells. Your body produces telomerase to lengthen telomeres, but not enough to counteract aging.   So, while they haven't ""reversed aging"", persay, they've completed a large fraction of it. Most cosmetic and physiological aspects of aging are solved with this, minus the shortening of telomeres. Death hasn't been solved, but every other aspect of aging has, if the peer reviews support these claims."
Transhuman,21u99y,xr1s,2,Tue Apr 1 03:52:43 2014 UTC,"Hayflick limit:       The Hayflick limit  (or Hayflick phenomenon) is the number of times a normal human cell population will divide until cell division stops. Empirical evidence shows that the telomeres associated with each cell's DNA will get slightly shorter with each new cell division until they shorten to a critical length.    The concept of the Hayflick limit was advanced by Leonard Hayflick in 1961,  at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia. Hayflick demonstrated that a population of normal human fetal cells in a cell culture will divide between 40 and 60 times. The population will then enter a senescence phase, which refutes the contention by Nobel laureate Alexis Carrel that normal cells are immortal. Each mitosis slightly shortens each of the telomeres on the DNA of the cells. Telomere shortening in humans eventually makes cell division impossible, and this aging of the cell population appears to correlate with the overall physical aging of the human body. This mechanism also appears to prevent genomic instability. Telomere shortening may also prevent the development of cancer in human aged cells by limiting the number of cell divisions. However, shortened telomeres impair immune function that might also increase cancer susceptibility.

It has been common knowledge for some time, and plenty of evidence as is demonstrated by the 14 scientific articles it has cited on the very subject.   If you had read the article to this thread, you would see that this is peer reviewed; an United States college (Harvard), and a college in Australia (University of NSW) both found the same results.  You are being ignorant of new scientific discoveries, and old knowledge."
Transhuman,21u99y,Zachariahmandosa,2,Tue Apr 1 15:01:13 2014 UTC,"To the assertion that I'm ""being ignorant of new scientific discoveries,"" I've worked as a research scientist in academia and biotech on biogerontological research, and am about to receive a medical degree. The hayflick limit is a phenomenon in cell culture. That aging is a simple results of telomere attrition has not been supported in a wealth of primary research papers. I'm not sure why I'm even responding to that given this article as far as I saw made absolutely no mention of it.  I can only assume by your rudeness, ignorance, and downvotes that this sub might not want actual scientific input or support, but rather would believe shitty articles like this without ever reading the primary literature or going beyond wikipedia. If the goals of transhumanism are to be realized, it means hard work has to be done. This applies to getting the actual research done, and also understanding what research is going on and what research constitutes bullshit dead-ends as there is evidence to argue for in the case of Sinclair's projects."
Transhuman,21u99y,garbonzo607,1 point,Wed Apr 2 00:40:39 2014 UTC,"I didn't ever say that aging was only related to telomere attrition, so stop making strawmen of my arguments. The Hayflick limit has been observed in cell culture, as they're one of the only ways we can accurately view living cells under a microscope, but it's definitely a phenomena that occurs in the body as well.   If you had read the article, you would know full well how their treatment works, and treats a completely different aspect of aging.   The compound raises the level of a naturally occurring substance in the human body called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. This substance decreases as people age   It's through this mechanism that most of the symptoms are treated.   You keep bashing Sinclair, but this work has been peer-reviewed by the University of NSW in Australia, who've reached the same conclusions. Regardless of what you may think of Sinclair, it isn't relevant to the facts presented by his peer-reviewed research.   Reading primary scientific literature doesn't prevent one from reading other articles or Wikipedia, for that matter. When the information on both ""shitty articles"" and reports are the same (as is the case here), then it's not exactly a shitty article.  In an attempt to throw a tantrum you try and insult me, this subs readers and the article because you can't seem to be swayed by evidence or logic. It seems pointless to try and continue to demonstrate why you're incorrect."

It's actually a brilliant way to think about recreating the mind of a person.  I don't think people before the internet left a big enough footprint to be digitally reincarnated.

We don't have the technology to reanimate the dead or give you endless life yet, but we do have the technology to record your whole life, 24/7, on video for cheap. So if you want to life forever, your best bet might be to just record everything you can about yourself, all of it, not just a few emails and books you produce, but all your life.  As for actual future reconstruction, if you have extremely detailed information about somebody,  it should be possible to recreate somebody very similar. However I doubt that anything outside of ""life recording"" will be enough, as just far to much of a person simply never gets properly recorded. You might however be able to create an AI that produces works very similar to what the original person produced, i.e. there are tries to produce AI that produces music that sounds like Mozard.  I strongly recommend to give Black Mirror: ""Be Right Back"" a watch (and the rest of the show). That episode deals exactly with this issue and the resulting problem in a quite realistic manner."

My view is that, in the simplest case, stating that you want to be brought back in a forum such as this is sufficient consent. Certainly that is true if you are a member of the Praxis or similar org eg Terasem.   Less easy is the question of those who have died before the possibility was even raised. Given that the reconstruction will probably have to be some sort of whole life simulation (a corollary of the Halting Problem) it might be ethical to wait until the reconstruction is complete before deciding. That is, wait until the point of their death in simulation before checking their state of mind as to the matter.  This does however mean that they get one involuntary resurrection indistinguishable from their original life. Which is not necessarily bad unless it involved disproportionate suffering. Even then, if unknowingly reliving that suffering is the price of eternal (or very long) life many would choose to do so. After all, if there is nothing at all after a lifetime of suffering, that is rather dismal.  Of course, if there are multiple simulation levels above us it does take the problem out of our hands. If the first lifetime was itself a simulation an immediate judgement can be made that is fully ethical (from our POV). It reduces to an analog of existing religious beliefs."

But buy the time a person reaches the position to give informed consent, it implies an understanding of quite a range of issues, such a the level of person hood a future simulation might have, at least a small amount of belief that this might one day happen, and that their decision made today actually matters a bit.  Personally, I've not even made the decision for myself because I'm holding out to reach the singularity in person, putting me in a weak position to persuade others.

Gotcha, so obviously wait for the strongest most complete simulation that massive data sets and simulations can provide.  The problem is that most people (atheist and religious) often embrace the inevitability of death, often happy to end a life perhaps now full of pain which they consider 'complete'. So this now places you in a position to argue with a simulation that has a high degree of acceptance over death, that it shouldn't.  In which case, why not have the discussion now, when the person is in relatively good health and more open minded towards the idea is my premise? :)   This does however mean that they get one involuntary resurrection indistinguishable from their original life.

But, in infinite perceived time, so long as the simulations are accurate enough, you can solve problems applicable to the real world.  Slowing time effectively amplifies intelligence by making you think literally faster. If a second of real time is an eternity of perceived time, humanity would wake up knowing exactly how to be really immortal, or at least, capable of preserving all minds on substrates far larger than their current ones and capable of feeling orders of magnitude more nice happy feelings.  This is why I don't buy this comic. Humans want to be happy, but they also want to grow, to expand, to become stronger. I find it hard to believe that not a single scientist would use eternity to solve problems that we're already close to solving, and that the technology required to create this scenario would imply are even closer, like mind uploading.  While not being realistic in the slightest, it is a beautiful short story, worth far, far more focus than the webcomic that presents it.

I think his intention is to create discussion and food for thought in the present about the possible repercussions of our technological advancements in the future.   Like a lot of good sci-fi. It's perhaps infeasible, yes. But what if society stagnates to such an extent because everyone's busy in their own, customized VR?

Transhuman,21mtj2,sixfourch,4,Sat Mar 29 10:41:26 2014 UTC,"No, infinite perceived time is not infinite real time.  The only way to make your perception of time faster than baseline is to accelerate your thoughts, so that you think more than N thoughts per time unit if N thoughts/TU is your baseline.  Physical limits of computing exist such that there is literally no way to infinitely accelerate. At some point, you will be thinking at the maximally fast rate of e thoughts/TU. After thinking N/e thoughts, the same amount of time will have passed.  (Maybe a fairer way to state this is that given infinite computability, infinite perceived time is infinite real time, because e literally becomes zero. But the real world is discrete, not continuous, and computability does have limits, so in the real world, you will never accelerate thoughts to the point of literally infinite perceived time.)  This has nothing to do with consciousness; it's just computation. If it bothers you, pretend the discussion is about an AI rather than humans.  Is there a specific reason you think what you think that is not addressed by the above?

Or the slowdown in perception of time people experience in high stress events involving lots of adrenaline (gun battle in war for instance), again, this is a time when the mind is quiet and the body is in a state of heightend awareness (not faster thoughts)  You can and do ""percieve"" time at different paces subjectively.   Think of time as qualia such as the ""feeling"" of ""soft"" or ""experience"" of ""red"" . We can break down a soft fabric into its constituent parts and make a soft blanket over and over but what does it mean to experience soft? Similarly we know that red is just a spectrum of light. A red apple reflects light in a way that we percieve as red , but just because you can break down what ""red"" is symbolically on paper it doesn't mean you've crossed the gap to what it is to experience something as red.  We have a theory of general relativity telling us spacetime is curved but this is the objective measurement of time, its ""absurd"" as i put it because we know from anecdote and personal experience that people percieve time at different speeds all the time. I'm not saying it have some mystical woowoo new age explanation , adrenaline would be a good start for a neurocorrelate, all i'm saying is that to any being percieving infinite time it would for all intents and purposes BE infinite time."

Add strawberry flavoring to milk and Hazah! you have an infinitely intelligent robot which will either destroy, enslave or domesticate us or pick your favorite utopian/dystopian scenario (I'm pretty sure dystopian isn't really a thing like the word utopia is, etymologically speaking)   But wait! Even strawberry milk doesn't work like that. Where does the strawberry flavoring and the milk come from? Human effort and intention. But you will notice, these things do not make a ""perfect"" strawberry milk. Doesn't matter if you use real strawberries and fresh cream rich milk or skim and synthetic strawberry furfuran flavoring with splenda and red dye number 12. People are going to have different opinions about price, taste, healthfulness and many other preferences. All of those preferences reflect upon the human intention and effort that produces strawberry milk.  So too will our flawed and perfect various and vague intentions be manifested in the technological future we are creating.

Transhuman,20rb4m,serfdomroad,1 point,Sun Mar 23 22:47:48 2014 UTC,"It is regulation and government control that creates oligopolies not a ""free market"". Economy activity is not simply a ""incentives"" problem, it is a knowledge problem. Socialist polices retards the transmission of knowledge, which is how innovation and growth occur. This is call information theory. Why do some places that have almost no natural resources prosper(Japan, South Korea) and others with vast amounts stagnate(Congo, Venezuela). It comes down to the ability to use information to reorganize matter and energy into items with high utility and use them to there most effective use.   When you say ""balanced capitalism"" I don't think you really have a full understanding of what capitalism is. And by balanced, what percentage of government control of GDP and GNP do you recommend? I think you would find that developed nations control a higher proportion of GDP and GNP than you might think. Almost every nation is a capitalist nation, even the Soviet union practiced capitalism. Capitalism, in brief, is the process of using capital goods to produce consumer goods and more capital goods(saving some output for investment) which are then fed back into the production of more consumer and capital goods. The difference between capitalism and socialism is who controls the ""modes of production"", who decides what resources are used for what aims, what is re-invested in, who consumes what and who receives the profit from venturing one's capital. This process can be free from constants or it can be ""regulated"" or ""guided"" by government(which operates by the use of force). The degree to which government acts in an economy is what I think you may be arguing for in ""balanced capitalism"". Although government action, whether what be in price manipulation, or other regulatory requirements impedes the transmission of knowledge and hurts the population as a whole by decreasing the popper allocation of resources(growth) and rasing the costs of innovation(barriers).    I don't mean to come off as an arrogant person who does not care for those who are the least fortunate, I argue the above because I do care and it is government action, whether it is done for the benefit for a small group(regulatory capture i.e. consentrated benefits and dispersed costs) or well meaning polices that are ment to ""help"" the poor, these actions leave people behind, stultificating much of the population.  The growth of consumption equality says a great deal of the power of freedom, everything from salt to large TVs and airline travel is made available at ever decreasing costs because of the freedom of what is commonly called ""capitalism""."

Transhuman,20hapx,DJRES,0,Sun Mar 16 05:40:27 2014 UTC,"Why? Why should I and everyone else foot the bill for healing human garbage?    Well, I'm actually in favor of a healthcare system which is more integrated in the free market than at least we (in Germany) currently have, and in that case, if there was enough demand for it, you'd be able to choose a health insurance company which wouldn't pay for your health once you've committed a crime, if that's really the kind of health insurance you want.  Since we don't have that kind of health insurance, people should be treated equally, and excuse the appeal to emotion, but if you say that someone is human garbage because their mental illness caused them to kill someone, then you might as well say that someone with a severe physical disability is human garbage, because their health condition allows them even less to be a functioning member of society.   Especially since we already have a difficult time taking care of people who aren't likely to commit crimes.   I suppose if other people are more likely to be cured from whatever condition they have, then healthcare should invest more money in curing them, if they do not have enough money for everyone.   I take justification from the fact that they have committed violent crimes and are statistically unlikely to ever be fit for normal society.   So your root for sympathy comes from the fact that you need those people for society to work, and if someone is useless for society, they don't deserve any sympathy? If so, you have every right to hold that view, I wouldn't necessarily call that sympathy, though.  I don't see the fact that there are billions of people as a reason to not have sympathy for them. The fact that I can't possibly help all of them doesn't mean that I wouldn't be happier if they had better lives."

Capital punishment is a difficult subject specifically because of all the grey areas in our justice system. My personal thought on it is that it should only be applied to repeat, violent offenders in cases where there is no question of guilt."

Transhuman,20hapx,yumyumpants,1 point,Sun Mar 16 14:51:09 2014 UTC,Shouldn't there be a penalty for destroying another person? What penalty wouldn't involve punishment? (honest questions)
Transhuman,20hapx,derangedhyena,2,Sun Mar 16 16:40:18 2014 UTC,"Well, the question is for what purpose you want the penalty.  If you want it for vengeance, then my answer is a definite no. That person has caused suffering, yes, but that doesn't mean that we should cause more suffering by punishing them. Instead, we should try to find ways to avoid suffering like that in the future.  If you want it as an incentive for people to behave, then I'm not sure. I've heard from several people that that kind of incentive doesn't actually stop people from commiting crimes. I haven't seen any studies on it and I don't know if there are any, but I haven't really invested a lot of time looking for any, either.  In any case, even if it can serve as an incentive for good behaviour, that is not a justification for violating the freedom or even the right to live for those who have already commited the crimes and who are therefore not among the people who actually get the incentive. If it can serve as an incentive, then I suppose the best kind of punishment you can use is an economic one, e. g. only leaving that person a certain amount of wealth or income or denying them participation in some areas of the market."
Transhuman,20hapx,NNOTM,3,Sun Mar 16 00:51:44 2014 UTC,"Hmm.   What do you propose as ""ways to avoid suffering like that in the future""? I'm reading that as a preventative measure. What action would this entail? Would it be a general societal action or something done to/against/for the person who committed the murder? (i.e. intensive studies of people who committed these crimes, to identify factors which could be used for prevention in the future?)   I also haven't done extensive reading on studies of it as an (de)incentivizer, so I likewise can't speak much to it. It is probably worth reading more on, though.  I suppose the penalty question necessitates defining the motive and circumstances of the murder(s). Manslaughter or homicide committed [for a somehow justified reason?] should probably have less severe consequences. In those sorts of cases, I'm not even sure your example of economic hobbling would be appropriate. (And I'm not sure how many other forms of 'incentive' punishments can feasibly exist or be enforced?)   But for people who are maliciously, carelessly, predatorily, or sociopathically committing homicides, I'm not sure something like a mere economic restriction would be enough?   If they already possess such a disregard for other people, how would we truly dissuade them from harming others? And wouldn't putting them at any kind of social disadvantage even further their negative or apathetic attitudes towards society? Possibly even spurring a demand for criminal activity (i.e. desire for wealth they are otherwise outright denied?)   At what point would the need for public safety override these people's right to freedom? Isn't the simplest and most effective choice simply to remove freedom (and in some cases right to life) for violating such a basic social tenet?  Sorry for so much questioning, these are just some of the things I end up pondering when the topic is brought up. The dissonance often seen in online discussions (i.e. ""I don't support the death penalty, but for THIS GUY we can make an exception..."") is really fascinating and I do wonder if there's any good way to resolve it."
Transhuman,20hapx,derangedhyena,2,Sun Mar 16 01:01:34 2014 UTC,"What do you propose as ""ways to avoid suffering like that in the future""?   I meant that in a very general way, though mostly as a general societal action, like changing education of children in such a way that they don't become murderers.  Nonetheless, what you proposed regarding specifically the murderer is also important. Of course it depends on how feasible all of these options are.   Manslaughter or homicide committed [for a somehow justified reason?] should probably have less severe consequences. In those sorts of cases, I'm not even sure your example of economic hobbling would be appropriate.   Well, an economic form of punishment is quite scalable.  I don't think there's any value in punishing self-defense and I'm not sure how to deal with 'accidental' crimes, though in both cases, I suppose (once again) studies about how punishing crimes in those categories would affect the crimerate would be helpful.   But for people who are maliciously, carelessly, predatorily, or sociopathically committing homicides, I'm not sure something like a mere economic restriction would be enough?    I apparently kind of forgot the possible use of punishment as a form of protection, and I think that's mostly because I don't consider that punishment, but protection. That's because it's basically unrelated to the crime they commited. (Apart from the fact that the crime might have been the reason for people to assume that the person might be dangerous.)  {edit: Nevermind, you definitely need a serious crime as additional justification; you can't just imprison random people because some psychologist says they're dangerous. I still see no reason to call it punishment, though.}  If it is evident that they would harm the rights of others (possibly requiring professional evaluation by psychologists?), then I suppose it is appropriate to harm their rights as a preventative measure. If possible, it should be attempted to dissuade them from harming others through therapy conducted by a psychologist or psychotherapist.  If they are punished economically, then the results from that should, of course, be included in the assessment of whether society needs to be protected from them.  To make imprisonment economically feasible (so that you don't have to kill them), I suppose it would be reasonable to have them pay for the living space and their food themselves. In general, I think they should be able to partake in society as much as possible, potentially even have a job and earn a living.  And should their psychologist/psychotherapist decide that it's save for them to be a full member of society again, then they should be.   Sorry for so much questioning   I do enjoy having to think about these issues. I want to make sure my thinking is not flawed, and being asked questions certainly helps me considering things I would not have considered otherwise."

To have even a hope of revival, cryopreservation needs to be done ASAP to keep decay to a minimum. Since cryopreservation can't be done before organ harvesting (due to the toxicity of current fluids), it would have to be done after the donation process, but before decay had set in to the body. This is almost certainly impossible for cardiac death because you're going to be decaying the entire time the organ team is working on your body. It MIGHT be possible for brain death, because (I believe) the body is kept on life support for much of the procedure. However, it seems to me that removing organs could begin certain damaging processes, even if the majority of the body was not necessarily decaying. So. . .yeah. You'd have to find doctors who both could and would harvest your organs while you were hooked up to life support, and then have a cryo team start as soon as the doctors were done. That seems like a tall order. Don't most of the cryo companies offer a head-only preservation option? That might be the way to go. Transplanting your preserved head onto a new body seems much more likely to succeed than fully repairing a shell that's been chopped to pieces and had all of its parts removed.

Your brain doesn't work like a computer with organized processes and distinctions between memory and consciousness etc. The brain is organic, it takes various stimulus (eyes, ears, nerves, etc.) and floods your neural pathways with signals. When you're born your brain has yet to develop, you don't have the structures in your brain to begin to conceptualize anything but your base emotions and attempt to process the sensory input. Your more primitive mind, the basic structures that are built using your DNA as a roadmap, will take the raw input and help reinforce certain primitive feelings (hate, love, joy, etc) in new neural pathways. These are what we think of as memories and feelings, and by repeating those inputs our brain reinforces existing pathways and creates new pathways.  Each part of your brain that's responsible for your various emotions and base instincts are constantly pushing and pulling to reinforce countless pathways. I believe that the push and pull of these base instincts coupled with the patterns emerging in your neural network compound until consciousness and self awareness result.  To back up a consciousness I think we will need to be able to replicate not only the structure of the brain, but also the way in which it reinforces pathways. We will also need to simulate hormonal responses and nervous input otherwise the brain would have no way to create new pathways and no stimulus to promote access to the existing ones.  I'm probably not right but the idea of id, ego and super-ego processes in your mind seems pretty far fetched. Not to mention the way you're describing them your Id would be responsible for the craziness, not your ego. Your ego would be what allows you to make rational decisions in spite of your id, and your super-ego is what you use to conform to cultural rules in spite of your ego's desires."

We're now able to image the brain with far more clarity and accuracy than ever before.  The process by which axons weave their way through the brain to make new connections is still a mystery, but one we are researching actively.  For very simple creatures (like flatworms) we have simulations of their small minds (and environments) that behave statistically indistinguishably from their real life counterparts.  Scaling up to human levels will only be a matter of time (and ethics), IMO.  Once one has the capability to image and tag all the neurons of a brain and simulate its processes reasonably well then we'll be able to install artificial brains in humans which can then be backed-up at will.  You may enjoy the thought-experiment / short story Down and Out in The Magic Kingdom by Cory Doctorow.  P.S.  Given the history of world governments, I'd strongly advise against cloud storage solutions.  You'll certainly want your own hardware...  And you may even want to see your new mind being fully operational -- ask yourself a few questions before you're killed or you die and it's implanted, just to be sure it works.  Personally, I'd opt for a robotic body too -- Just leave all my belongings to my clone.  I'd much rather visit a mechanic than a doctor.  A system powerful enough to run a simulation of a human brain could instead run a wholly artificial and far more efficient neural network program that far surpasses the complexity of (and thus intelligence of) a human-brain-simulation.

He is the scenario I imagine. Picture yourself as full uploaded into a machine, able to exist in a virtual world, and inhabit avatars in the real world. Now you are currently located in avatar A, all of your memories and processes are being constantly backed up in the cloud. In order to test what ""dying"" would be like, you ""transfer"" to avatar B. Avatar A(who you currently were a second ago) is now shut down instantly, with no pain, and for all intents and purposes dead. You just died, in our current sense of the word. Now in almost an instant the memory, processes, even the state of the electrons in the brain, that were copied and stored in the cloud are now transferred into avatar B. To Avatar B it just seemed like teleportation from avatar A, however avatar A is now ""dead"".  Avatar B now makes some new memories, and then transfers back to avatar A. A is restored, and then after a microsecond, all of the new memories from Avatar B are now transferred into A. Avatar B has now died. After A is revived but with the new memories from Avatar B, the mind uploaded user now realizes that the notion of dying is a silly thing if your memories and processes are instantly transferred, and now does not let the ego get in the way of him happily jumping to and from multiple avatars. If there ever is doubt, you can always inhabit a previous avatar that had died to make sure that you don't really care anymore.  To be honest, it's a very zen like thing. There is no feeling in death, There is no consciousness, there is no ego,  There is no fear,  there is no want to keep on living, there is no want to see the future, there is no want to survive, there is no wanting for anything at all, even in the slightest, there is nothing, pure nothing. This is why we will not care in the future. As long as we live on in another state, we should be happy with instantly transferring our minds, it's something YOU will consciously have to do, and the instant you decide to transfer, you will either go into pure nothingness and not care even the slightest about what just happened, or you will have successfully transferred into another avatar, and be extremely happy with the results.

But rejecting the Hard Problem as if it doesn’t exist would be a grave mistake and damn future generations to endless, bizarre deaths that don’t have to happen. Almost everything that is exciting about living in an uploaded state can occur without this critical flaw."
Transhuman,20at25,CharlemagneXVI,1 point,Fri Mar 14 18:33:37 2014 UTC,"I’m not getting this bit. What is doing the revisiting? At any moment, there is you, existing and running on some substrate. The you that is running now could stop, and the you that had stopped could be set in motion again, but there is no becoming that other avatar. There are two copies of you, and if each were running, each would have its own subjective experience separate from the other.   Right, but if only one were running at a time, and then at the moment the one was turned off and the other was turned on, the memories and the brain state right before the one avatar was deactivated would transfer over to the new one, You would essentially ""Become"" the other avatar by the copied memories and copied brain state. I believe that the ""what it feels like"" to be someone, can be stored and simulated, if one were to take a snapshot of the brain at any given moment.  If there was a guarantee that ""you"", your subjective consciousness would be reactivated in the future, would you still have a problem with avatar jumping?    ""I am so valuable to the future that I send a copy of myself to it as a gift!"" No sir, I want to be there, not just have a copy there.   Again the first time someone uploads, it should be done incrementally. but after that I do not think it would be necessary.   Anyway, I am in agreement with  Daniel Dennett and Peter Hacker that there is no hard problem to consciousness, and we will eventually figure out how the brain works completely by studying more in depth the easy problems."
Transhuman,20at25,Supervisor194,3,Fri Mar 14 18:56:23 2014 UTC,"You would essentially ""Become"" the other avatar by the copied memories and copied brain state   We may both be stretching the word ""you"" here to its breaking point. It makes discussion tricky, since its meaning may change even within the same sentence. To be clear, I mean ""you"" to refer to the continuous, causal stream of sentience that one exists as. So, I read   [the continuous, causal stream of sentience that one exists as] would essentially ""Become"" the other avatar   In this reading, it clearly doesn’t. What makes you everything you are can be copied to another running instance, but that instance is disconnected from you in a fundamental way – anything it subsequently experiences is not experienced by you. Even if you inherit memories from that other instance later, you didn’t experience those events, you just remember them. If the universe was created five minutes ago, with you and all your memories intact, you may remember old events but you never experienced them. They didn’t really happen to you, and you weren’t present for them.  I don't mean to repeat myself, but this is exactly what the hard problem is about. There are many folks - even some distinguished philosophers as you mention - who think the problem doesn't exist at all. But it's not a matter of dispute, because it is absolutely clear that if you are copied to a computer but go on living and then die, you will never personally experience the exciting future you are anticipating. Another you will, but it’s not you. If you were incrementally uploaded so that it really was you experiencing this new reality, it would end at the first non-incremental transfer, and a copy of you would blithely go on its way and you would never experience its life.   I believe that the ""what it feels like"" to be someone, can be stored   No, what it feels like to be something is had by being that thing. What makes up that thing can be documented, stored, re-created and then re-activated, and from that point onward that new thing will be a faithful copy of you, have genuine self-awareness and sentience, act in exactly the same way you would have, but you won’t personally experience that thing’s life.   If there was a guarantee that ""you"", your subjective consciousness would be reactivated in the future   This guarantee would be an understanding of how my personal stream of causal reality were able to carry on in an unbroken way into my future states. There can be no other guarantee. A copy of myself would perceive no interruption in subjectivity. Only the original me would know.  The science-fiction novel Dark Sky Legion by William Barton deals with this issue at several points in the story. In one memorable scene where the protagonist’s original is duplicated in preparation to be sent away into space, never to return, there is a horrible moment immediately afterwards where the duplicate whirls around and cries: ""...but I didn’t think it would be me!""   there is no hard problem to consciousness   There surely is. If there isn’t, what precisely have I and many others misunderstood? It’s why we feel something, instead of feel nothing. It’s the hard problem of consciousness, not to consciousness.   we will eventually figure out how the brain works completely   This is where you misunderstand. Even if we can detail how every atom in your brain behaves and turns input signals into output signals, nothing can explain why you feel something, as opposed to nothing. From the outside, you would behave the same either way. This is the nut of the hard problem. Subjective experience is not required for the laws of physics to operate as they do, but it seems to happen in tandem with it, as we can each individually attest."

I really like this video about the subject.    There surely is. If there isn’t, what precisely have I and many others misunderstood? It’s why we feel something, instead of feel nothing. It’s the hard problem of consciousness, not to consciousness.   Our brain is a gigantic black box computer, with a bunch of different illusions mixed up to allow us to reproduce better. The ego, the self, is an illusion, and that's where most people get it mixed up. It's a tricky circuit in the brain that says I am me, and what I am experiencing is myself.   Consciousness is not a fundamental feature of the universe and instead will eventually be fully explained by natural phenomena. Instead of involving the nonphysical, consciousness merely plays tricks on people so that it appears nonphysical—in other words, it simply seems like it requires nonphysical features to account for its powers.  The phenomenon of having experience is nothing more than the performance of functions or the production of behavior, which can also be referred to as the easy problems of consciousness. Consciousness itself is driven simply by these functions, and to strip them away would wipe out any ability to identify thoughts, feelings, and consciousness altogether. The easy problems and the hard problem cannot be separated from each other. The hard problem of experience is included among—not separate from—the easy problems, and therefore they can only be explained together as a cohesive unit.  This video, My stroke of insight, is really interesting to watch, and to me at least, gives some evidence of the naturalistic evedence of consiousness, or the ego per say"
Transhuman,20at25,RedErin,2,Fri Mar 14 20:59:02 2014 UTC,"nothing is a powerful word, There definitely is something triggering it, whatever it is, shuts off when we go to sleep   Our conscious awareness dissolves when we go to sleep, but our brains continue to function and the fact that we dream shows we continue to have subjective experience. It's not about conscious waking awareness, but sentience.   The phenomenon of having experience is nothing more than the performance of functions or the production of behavior   Experience isn't a phenomenon, it cannot be observed objectively, only subjectively. Behaviour is what the system does when observed from the outside; experience/sentience is what the system feels on the inside.  Thank you for linking to the wonderful stroke of insight video, I've seen it before but others here may not have. I recommend it, it's amazing.  I would say that we occupy two very different positions, and your future vision is only acceptable to those who reject the hard problem as a problem at all.

It is not the sacral level as you'd think based on skin dermatomes but instead somewhere in the high lumbar L1-L3. And it is definitely the dorsal root. I spent considerable time reading medical journal papers about spinal stimulation using TMS so my comments about coil shape are not guesses but simply repetition of the literature.

You could try forehead, but I'm guessing with as much motion as you have on your forehead rejection and healing would be even worse (never seen any single point piercings on foreheads, or even surface piercings).  You could try eyebrows maybe, but again there's a motion problem. Next, even if you can manage someplace semi-flush, such as eyebrows or forehead, the shots you'll get will be horrible (walk around for a day and realize how much your head bounces just from stepping, how often you move your head around without even realizing it: our brains piece together our vision and sense of stillness in it). If you can manage the above then there's no reason it wouldn't be possible, just need to find a camera small enough and some way of receiving signal from it.

Compared to most people, people who end up living past the age of 100 are much less likely to have serious chronic illnesses, and either suffer from less dementia and similar problems or at least it tends to start later.  When the article says that they ""survive the damages of aging a little longer then the rest of us"", it fails to mention that they also seem to take damage from aging slower then the rest of us as well.  Granted, some of that might be just survivor's luck, but if there is a genetic difference that is linked to the tiny percent of people who currently survive past the age of 100 or even 110 today, and we can isolate it, we likely could delay most of the effects of aging in ourselves for at least a few years.      I think people like this article's writer are a little too focused on finding a single cure for aging; that would be great, but it seems a lot more likely to me that we'll very slowly beat back aging with dozens or hundreds of advancements of all types.  The first goal is to get to the point where medical research is increasing the average and maximum lifespan by about 1 year every year.

Here are a couple of quotes from a PBS documentary about Ray Kurzweil:   CRAIG VENTER: I don’t think we’re going to ever get there. I know a little bit more about biological reality. What I have argued, if you want to be immortal, do something useful in your lifetime.  RAY KURZWEIL: Craig Venter is a brilliant, very innovative person, but in this instance, he is not appreciating exponential growth.   So it's not just using the term ""healthy aging"" instead of ""immortality"" to avoid a media firestorm. Ventner just has more conservative ideas about what is possible.  Or does he just have more realistic expectations? It's hard to predict what we'll be capable of in the future, but we do know that right now we are capable of achieving a healthier aging process."

Transhuman,1zk1ri,aviroy,4,Tue Mar 4 19:44:45 2014 UTC,"Well not extending, exactly - more like managing the various end-of-life diseases... this may result in an extension of life, but the ultimate goal is to improve life quality.  It's very different from a pursuit of immortality, for example - even though it would be an essential part of it (imagine living 1000 years with crippling diseases)"
Transhuman,1zk1ri,sfacets,4,Wed Mar 5 00:12:31 2014 UTC,"Yeah, despite the name of the company, the goal is to actually attack age-related diseases (like Alzheimers), not the disease of aging itself. That's not really much different from what a lot of people are doing now. Reason from Fight Aging just wrote an article on this, and he had a great point:   focusing on gene sequencing in the context of life extension is very much a case of searching for the keys where the light is good, not in the dark where you dropped them.   SENS is really the only company that I know of is that is explicitly aiming to reverse aging, and not just slow it down (which will take longer to do, and will not help anyone that's already old and suffering from the effects of aging)."
Transhuman,1zk1ri,Mindrust,2,Wed Mar 5 01:42:50 2014 UTC,This reminds me of something Larry Page said when Calico was announced.  The bit about how curing cancer wouldn't really do much to increase maximum lifespan.  I was really shocked to hear that.  This reminds me of the narrow AI vs. strong AI funding debate.

Transhuman,1zk1ri,RushAndAPush,1 point,Wed Mar 5 04:44:41 2014 UTC,"Perfect regeneration would be the ultimate goal. Cancers occur because cells, instead of dying, continue to grow and form new, abnormal cells. This is because of DNA damage that happens when the cell divides time after time.  If cells can be coaxed into dividing permanently and without glitches, then we have a shot at immortality, otherwise - should we figure out longevity without first fixing the division problem, we will all eventually turn into huge masses of tumours, which doesn't seem particularly appealing :)"

That being said, the compounds they're using are rather virulently toxic in and of themselves, so there's as yet no way to ensure that the informational structures of the body remain intact after cryonic suspension.  Yes, they've done revivifications of things like kidneys, which are rather sensitive -- but that's nowhere near the sensitivity of the brain.  There's also been progress in destructive scanning techniques but nothing yet that inspires assumption of reconstruction of the structures in an information-intact manner within a virtualized environment."

No, that is not true at all. Death or life is definitely something you can have a moral choice in: should you live or should you die? Should you let someone live or end someone's life? It's a very popular question, especially so among non-philosophers (such as the abortion or death penalty debates).  Now, of course, just because your morals say that death is wrong doesn't mean that you will avoid death. But if your morals tell you that death is okay (mostly via some type of naturalistic fallacy, ""it's just part of nature, thus it's acceptable!""), chances are that you won't pursue the elimination of death. Right now the main hurdles to eliminating death is in the practical science. We're likely many decades away from solving the many, many issues of the human body and why it will always break after a few decades. But we are likely delaying progress by accepting death (something I've often seen called 'deathism', the idea that death is acceptable)."
Transhuman,1zc0vp,Aeonoris,9,Sun Mar 2 14:49:14 2014 UTC,"In other words:  Perhaps death itself isn't morally wrong, but accepting it for yourself or others is wrong."

Transhuman,1zc0vp,Cavanus,3,Mon Mar 3 04:47:42 2014 UTC,"This is really too far, death isn't ""right or wrong"", and to try and call it either of those is already ridiculous enough, but wanting to teach kids that it's wrong is another level of stupidity. You say we're delaying progress by accepting death, but I feel the reality is that the majority don't care about immortality. In fact I'm sure most of them are perfectly content with our current biological cycle. People can choose to accept death or not accept it, and it should be left that way."
Transhuman,1zc0vp,Mindrust,7,Sun Mar 2 17:04:30 2014 UTC,"In fact I'm sure most of them are perfectly content with our current biological cycle.   I really don't think they are. The majority of people who say they're content to live to age X claim so for at least one of four reasons:   A) They don't believe the goal of rejuvenation is feasible within their lifetimes, or perhaps feasible at all. Not much reason to really start questioning your beliefs about aging if you don't think there's any chance of combating it.   B) They're assuming they will reach some age that they'll come to the realization that ""I'm healthy but I've been around long enough. Time to clock out"". This can be shown to be false with an argument by induction.   C) They confuse extending healthy lifespan (healthspan) with extending the decrepit stages of old age, as we kind of do now with medical care for the elderly to just keep them alive.   D) They equate solving the problem of aging to becoming an immortal entity, playing God or defeating death...which I really don't think is a good way to think about it. Healthspan extension is about improving the quality and quantity of life, for everyone.   I'll make the bold assertion that no one is content with our biological cycle, and the reason for that is no one actually looks forward to becoming a decrepit old person. We all dread the day when we become weak, dependent, saggy, senile, easily injured, lose quality of our senses (vision and hearing), become vulnerable to serious diseases, and a whole host of other problems that come with the territory of an aged human body.   The understanding of aging as being a disease (rather than some kind of sacred, unquestionable, unchangeable part of the human experience) hasn't quite gotten through to the the public yet, but I'm starting to see hints that it's starting to in the last couple of years. The mainstream scientific community is certainly coming to that realization."
Transhuman,1zc0vp,Cavanus,0,Sun Mar 2 21:51:54 2014 UTC,"Yes, I get your point, I don't think anyone likes becoming old condition wise, and changing that I'm sure they would love. But I doubt many people want to live forever. What I'm saying is there are many people who accept death in the sense that they don't see it as the end all of their existence. Saying that death is wrong just means that you aren't very open to the idea that death in our known biological bodies isn't the end. And please don't get the idea that I'm advocating heaven and hell or whatever because I'm not, I don't believe in either of those. I am certain most people would love to live in good physical condition for all of their lives, no matter how long their lives may be."
Transhuman,1zc0vp,brianpeiris,1 point,Mon Mar 3 01:39:57 2014 UTC,"No. Death is not a morality thing.  Harming other people is a morality thing.  Don't abuse the ambiguity of the word to refer to both murder and accident. Even so, the act of murder is distinct from the act of dying -- one action causes the other. It is the murder which is wrong not the death it causes, but because of the death it causes. Voluntary death is called suicide and is categorically not murder on that grounds.  Stop injecting morality where it doesn't belong.  Some things are not about morality. For example, the color blue is not ""evil"" or ""wicked"". It's just a color. Tying your shoes is not a moral act. Neither is dying. Death, like hearing a Miley Cyrus song, is just a thing that can happen to you and most sane people would prefer to avoid it but that doesn't mean that the thing itself requires a moral choice because it is unpleasant.  Stop injecting morality where it doesn't belong because that's just you trying to control other people -- and that's morally wrong."
Transhuman,1zc0vp,Cavanus,2,Sun Mar 2 15:19:20 2014 UTC,"In the near future science and technology will solve the problem of aging. However, society will still cling to the idea that death is a natural fact of life and that it is perfectly ok for someone to die when they've hit the age of 100. This is clearly immoral. It will be even clearer in the future, when our 100 year-olds will look and behave like today's 50 year-olds.  In order to accelerate this shift in mindset, we have to push the idea that death is wrong even before it is clear that a 100 year-old can live a healthy and longer life.  Taking it from a different perspective, this book would be one way to introduce children to the idea of transhumanism and prepare them for a time when they do not die of senescence."
Transhuman,1zc0vp,brianpeiris,1 point,Sun Mar 2 16:33:56 2014 UTC,"Who cares if humanity clings on to that idea!? Does it really matter? The people who want to live forever or longer will do the work needed to make it happen, and once the technology exists, people can decide whether or not they want to live indefinitely or whether they'd rather die at a certain point. This isn't immoral at all, it's simply a choice.

It is pretty clear what was meant, and the abuse of language was minor.  And anyway, under a utilitarian moral code your objection almost entirely disappears. In those systems an action is moral according the the expected utility of its consequences. Accordingly, events may be ascribed their own moral weights -- if an accident decreases global utility, this decrease can be compared to the decreases resulting from decisions made by moral actors. We can measure how ""bad"" an accident was, even though it was not a moral action  Essentially, we may say that death is a moral evil insofar as (or simply as shorthand for saying that) the prevention of death is a moral good."

Regardless, the average historical lifespan has been distorted due to high childhood mortality rates. We have damn good reason to believe that the maximum human lifespan hasn't changed for as long as we've been a distinct species. And it's that number, the maximum, which we're concerned with here.

The thing to realize about the kinds of technologies discussed in transhumanist thought is that they will, inevitably, be developed, because there will always be someone in the world with strong incentives to push technology beyond its existing limits.

But I'll try to answer these anyway.   Possibly. To make a ""virtual world"" for the uploaded brain would mean you have to send the proper visual and auditory stimulus at least, plus a bunch of other signals that we get from our body (temperature, pressure, etc.).  A clone is still sentient, but I would assume that the uploaded mind would be aware of whatever stimulus it receives. So if you connected some sort of camera feed to the uploaded brain, it would ""see"" whatever that camera sees. Well that kind of gets into the consciousness debate; but in my opinion it would be like passing out and waking up somewhere different. You would probably notice something was different when you no longer have a body. Theoretically, if you recreate each neuron and each connection between each neuron exactly, then the new brain would be a copy of the old one, with the same memories and everything."

At this point you are now in two places at once, or at least your mind is. Then, you eventually stop using your original neurons all together, allowing your body to die, assuming you haven't moded it to keep it alive as some sort of avatar.

In other words you don't have anything to ""upload,"" other than the structure and order of your brain that gives rise to your consciousness. Like any matter, it can be duplicated. If we can figure out how to duplicate your brain to the exact detail, create a digital ""copy"" of your brain, then the ""mind"" that you perceive when you deal with reality every day will arise again in a new substrate. You will still be you, but there will be a perfect copy of your mind, with all your memories and your propensities. You have been backed up, and your knowledge will now no longer be lost - but there is no transferrence, there is no conveying from one to the next, because other than the structure of you, the blueprint of you, there is nothing to transfer.  Sentience is overrated. Ask yourself this question: when you go to sleep and you wake up in the morning, how would you know if an alien froze your prone form, duplicated you exactly, copied you and destroyed the old you? When you wake up, you look the same, you have the same memories, even memories of yesterday and perhaps some particularly vivid dreams you were having - but how do you know you are the same you?   You really don't. And if you woke up in a box and could somehow see your old body looking at you, you would similarly think you were just as you as you are, but you would not really be. I think there may be some traction to the notion that a being forged in flesh with arms, legs, mobility and a full range of senses waking up in a box with full memories of everything but none of the sensory or ambulatory anything may well be a decent definition of hell.  But you would be in a digital format and the unique thinking processes and memories and everything that makes you you would be able to live on. That's valuable. Imagine if we could have Einstein around forever, his brain working in its youthful prime. Perhaps even juiced up with extra power.  I'm rambling. I hope any of that made sense at all."

You're killing the original and making a copy that doesn't experience discontinuity from the original.  There are other models of upload.  For example, putting implants in a person that extends them into a computer... And keeping that part around if/when the meat part dies.  So long as enough is in computer, there's no real death event as we know it.  It's more like an amputation or maybe brain damage."
Transhuman,1z6ytf,IConrad,2,Sun Mar 2 01:24:48 2014 UTC,"Here's what I've gathered from listening to alot of interviews that prominent futurists have given:  1) Yes. Your brain houses the most important part of you: your ""mind"" which is what i'm called the algorithm that constitutes your personality, your stream of consciousness, basically your entire human experience.  That algorithm, though it may be incredibly complex, is probably finite and so within the grasp of technology that is advancing at an exponential rate.  Once you are in the virtual world, if the quality of the stimuli that is input to your algorithm is high enough, it would feel no different to you than the real world feels to you right now.    2)If the upload process takes an image of your consciousness and builds it out in a virtual world, then it is a ""copy"" of you, though the implications are huge:  it is no more or less the ""real"" you than the original biological version of you.  Essentially, both of you become copies of each other, even if you think of yourself as the ""original"".  I'm not using the term clone, because ""clone"" implies something having to do with biology.  And yes, the version of your that is uploaded would have all your memories and traits.    3) This one heavily depends on the upload procedure.  If the uploading is done while you are sleeping and it is a copying procedure, then one of you goes to sleep and two of you wake up, one in the ""real"" world, one in the virtual world.  If the quality of the stimuli being inputted to the virtual you were high enough, then neither of you could be sure which is the biological version and which is the virtual version.  You would both wake up and likely assume that you were the ""real"" you (and you'd both be right, bizarrely enough).  If the mind uploading happens while you are wake, then you might successfully achieve a transfer of the stream of your consciousness to the computer.  It might go something like this: your brain is interfaced directly to a computer.  Your consciousness now spreads, and it physically exists in both your brain as well as in the computer.  They neurons firing in your brain work in perfect sync with the virtual neurons firing away in the computer.  Now your biological neurons are gradually shut down, little by little, until your biological brain is dead and yous mind exists completely in a computer.  You would not experience and pain and you would have no interruption in the stream of your consciousness.  Now we can argue what has actually just happened, but I think most people would say that you have successfully transferred your consciousness to the computer.   4) We are so far away from doing anything i've just talked about that it's a little disheartening.  The ""how"" of mind uploading is a question that we probably won't be ready to answer for a long time."
Transhuman,1z6ytf,yayaja67,2,Sat Mar 1 05:56:38 2014 UTC,"Once the brain is uploaded, is it put in a virtual world? [kind of like 'The Sims']    There's no necessity for this. The central idea is that the mind is inherently informational and thus can be copied to a machine brain as a substrate (instead of a biological brain like we have right now). The machine might well be given cameras, microphones, manipulators and the like in order to mimic human eyes, ears, arms, etc and allow the uploaded person to live in the real world in a similar way to a biological human. With advanced technology, the machine body could even be made to look convincingly human.  At least at first, the main purpose of mind uploading is not to get away from the real world, but just to get away from the problems of biological bodies, such as diseases and senescence. Machine bodies might not be indestructible, but they are much easier to repair, and the basic technology of mind uploading would let you transfer to a new body whenever you wanted. People could even choose to try out other kinds of bodies (imagine being able to fly like a bird, or swim like a dolphin).  That said, the advancement of computer games and simulated reality will continue, and mind uploading does create the possibility for people to forego standard physical bodies and live all their lives in simulated worlds. Others may spend some of their time in physical bodies, but mostly live in simulations. Furthermore, some simulations might be made to closely mimic the real world, allowing for 'virtual tourism' and blurring the boundaries between real and simulated worlds as they are perceived.   Is one sentient when uploaded? Or is it just a clone so to speak? Would it still be the person uploaded i.e having the same memories, character, traits etc.   Everything we know suggests that the uploaded version would be conscious and have subjective experience just like biological humans do. The important characteristics of a mind that generate subjective thought seem to be informational, and thus independent of substrate.  However, there is an ongoing debate over whether the (fully conscious) uploaded version would be the same person, or just a copy that thinks it is the same person. The copy wouldn't care, of course, but a person considering getting themselves uploaded might be worried that their real self will cease to exist. This gets into even stickier territory once we imagine making multiple copies of uploaded minds, which can then branch off and have their own distinct experiences. It may be that our very concept of personal identity will have to be entirely reworked to handle the reality of a culture with mind upload technology, that no understanding of the human condition can adequately prepare us for the posthuman condition.   Does one wake up and realise they have been uploaded?   Hard to say. It may be something that you're put to sleep for and then woken up once the transfer is complete. On the other hand, it may be that making the transfer while the person is awake will turn out to be easier, possibly with the two brains synchronized for a short time (believing they are the same person) until the biological one is shut down and the digital one carries on from there. In this second case, it would seem to the person like a continuous experience. They may feel themselves gradually becoming aware of the sensations from their new body (whether it exists in the real world or a simulated one), and then lose the sensations from their original body.  In most cases, those undergoing the procedure will have chosen to do so voluntarily, so the transition (whether continuous or abrupt) to their new body will not come as a surprise. If they are asleep for the procedure, then it might be something like waking up after a general anesthetic, but in a different body. Depending on how well the human mind adapts to new senses and motor signals, some sort of therapy might be necessary for those transferring into substrates unlike the human body in order to make a smooth, minimally unpleasant transition. Alternatively, a newly uploaded person might be placed in a very humanlike body (either physical or simulated) and then gradually trained with alternative systems.  It is conceivable that some people might be forcefully uploaded, without being told beforehand. Presumably that would come as quite a shock, at least if the new body was unlike their old one. On the other hand, if they were placed in a very humanlike body, they might not even notice the change until explicitly told about it.   How is this process done?   We don't entirely know yet. Supposedly, there'll be some sort of machine like an MRI device, but way more advanced, that will scan a person's entire brain (mapping out all the cells and their connections with each other), and then reconstruct the same informational pattern in software. The process may even destroy the original brain as it scans, in order to achieve its high level of detail (or maybe early versions will do this, and then advanced versions will be invented that allow the original brain to survive intact).   I understand that it's to early to be asking these sort of questions   No, it's just too early to give definite, concrete answers. It certainly is not too early to ask the questions. These topics are something we find difficult to think about, and quite scary in how the ideas threaten our generally accepted notions of identity and the human condition. However, there are probably people alive now who will live to see these things become reality, and the better prepared they are, the easier (and safer) it will be for everybody."
Transhuman,1z6ytf,green_meklar,3,Sat Mar 1 07:36:58 2014 UTC,"I'm not a scientist (though I do have an MSc in a computing field!) but I have a good idea of what constitutes 'mind uploading':   Once the brain is uploaded (presuming to some digital medium), it would be held in storage. There would be no reason to add a 'virtual world' and we don't currently have the information or knowledge available to do so, never mind the prerequisites to create a full copy of the brain. The caveat in terms of copying the brain is that we don't yet have the tech to create or verify a full copy of it's contents without losing information. In a realistic sense, the first 'downloads' (even presuming a perfect method is used to restore the information) would almost be guaranteed to be missing information, especially if we don't have 100% knowledge of the organ. For this reason, the first uploaded 'brain images' would also take a massive amount of storage as we wouldn't have developed brain-specific compression algorithms to minimize the amount of data required to restore it - an extreme example of this would be digital reproduction of the brain at a sub-atomic level, including it's full state with any chemicals or particles present. We'd also need a massively powerful machine to read and 'print' the data. Who knows? This is a philosophical question more than anything else. Common sense suggests that a perfect copy would be a clone with all your memories and thought processes as there are no known mechanisms that would cause a duplicated, perfect copy to 'strip' the conciousness of the previous brain - we're not aware of any means to 'transfer conciousness' and the two brains would become different as soon as the copy is made (even if the original is put in a medically induced coma or killed, there're still biological changes in the brain) so it's probably safe to say that it'll be a 'different you', for all intents and purposes. Expect brain upload companies to gloss over this if such a thing becomes possible - it's harder to find people willing to be killed and recreated with no continuity with the knowledge that what they understand as me will end. Needless to say that I'm speculating here, but I think it's a fairly safe assumption to make as even if all of the original brain, uploaded digital brain and downloaded clone brain were in the same state initially, they'd diverge as soon as they were 're-activated'. As an aside, there's massive ethical issues here - consider trying to convince a scientist not to kill you because the other guy isn't really you when he knows everything you do and feels exactly the same way. Consider the resultant unfairness to both you and your clone if both of you survive and are released or if one or both of you had to be destroyed. Some very difficult issues there. It's very likely to be the case, if somebody has asked to be uploaded beforehand. From a person's perspective, they would probably (again, considering a perfect backup) remember everything up to visiting the facility and getting scanned. From their perspective, they're waking up after falling asleep in the brain scanner - that could be disorientating, depending on the location in which they are restored and whether they are given the same body as before or not. We know for a fact that the brain needs to learn how the body works, to some extent - suddenly having a different body (even only slightly different) will be very disorientating and the brain will need time to adapt. That's just one issue - I'm sure there are many more and that's not even considering the psychological effect of knowing that you are a clone. In practical terms? It's not something that can really be discussed much deeper than 'take a digital copy of the brain, encode it into some format without losing any information, store the copy for as long as required then recreate a new brain using the information in the copy'. We simply don't have the technology to either read all the information in the brain (we're not just talking in terms of the biological structure, but also the chemicals present in every part and perhaps even down to the atomic/subatomic level) or to write the information to a new brain. We don't even know exactly what a 'perfect' copy of the brain would contain or to create even a basic artificial brain - it's fair to say that we'd need totally new systems to implement the theory of how the brain works in a digital environment but we don't even know how much of it works in a theoretical way.    To discuss the topic with any seriousness, we need to know how the brain works and why it works. Without that information, any 'clone' we create will be missing so much that it'll simply be a poor, 'dumb' emulation of observable human behaviour, likely not even approaching the word 'human'. There's still a LOT to do there."

Transhuman,1z6ytf,tehbored,2,Fri Feb 28 23:31:29 2014 UTC,"I don't think that's true, we have ways to scan and detect the structure of the brain without destroying it currently.

Of course as octarion pointed out, we don't know exactly how the brain works and there may be subatomic processes that we'd have to be able to detect and store in a digital format. But that doesn't mean we can't scan a brain without destroying it. I'm sure in the future we'll use all kinds of scanning methods to determine the full structure of the brain non destructively, even just building on our current technology it seems feasible."
Transhuman,1z6ytf,azuretek,2,Sat Mar 1 00:06:46 2014 UTC,Keep in mind that EM radiation has a lower maximum resolution than electrons. You wouldn't be able to measure the smaller cellular structures.
Transhuman,1z6ytf,tehbored,1 point,Sat Mar 1 10:00:06 2014 UTC,"Good point! It's true that even the current 'non-invasive' brain imaging techniques (eg. MRI & PET) provide a low resolution sample of relatively basic, high-level processes while still requiring active stimulation of the brain (through magnetic fields or injected chemicals respectively). Even attempts at optical imaging of the brain change the way it works in unexpected ways! This is great for seeing how the brain is affected by blocking certain areas or pathways and observing the results of psychological experiments, telling us what the brain does but they don't help us create a good picture of what the brain actually is.   Without the means to reliably observe the brain without changing it's state (remember that after death the brain decomposes, so it's still changing), it's impossible to control all the environmental variables. If you can't control all the environmental variables, you can't observe consistent results. If you can't observe consistent results and don't have a record of the true 'initial state' of the ever-changing brain to compare any changes to, you can't really do better than an educated guess at the underlying systems that cause the phenomenon you observe in the experiment. This is why psychologists rely so much on statistical theory and models of abstraction, otherwise they'd be stuck in a Schrödinger's cat situation! The brain is, today, a black box of sorts.  And why does our copy need to be perfect? We might be able to get away with poorly copying some things - a chair, for example, can be duplicated fairly easily. Four legs, a seat and a back. Maybe add some armrests. The result might not be the same chair but we have factories that can measure everything out to spec so that the chair's so similar to be indistinguishable from the original to the human eye and a chair's a chair, right?  We can't do the same with a brain. The system is so heavily interlinked with itself and the rest of the body and is the main part of what makes us 'us'. I don't see us managing a full-resolution, living-subject brain-scan any time soon. Of course, the challenge in understanding the human brain isn't new - unlocking it's secrets has been a goal of humanity since we became self-aware."

After the program was correctly matching every action you make, you would assume that it was a sufficiently accurate copy of you, and place the program in a new body as the uploaded version of you.  It's hard to say how accurate such a copy would be, but then, we ourselves are constantly changing as we have new experiences and learn new things, so if it was evolved based on enough data from you, the copy might well be accurate enough as far as we are concerned."

They have more memory, but they have only just reached the brain's speed. However, the brain is massively parallel to an extent even the machines can't yet match, so there would be substantial losses due to the machines being badly optimized for brainlike behavior.  I suspect that, even if parallel processing is highly conducive to intelligence and consciousness, existing supercomputers are probably parallel enough to run human-level AI, if we knew exactly how to write the algorithms. But we don't know how yet, and even if we did, that's not the same thing as uploading a human mind."

Transhuman,1z6ytf,trifith,0,Sat Mar 1 07:21:51 2014 UTC,"Depends on the purpose of the upload. Is it a backup, in case of death? In that case, I would imagine it is just stored data, receiving no input, and having no changes. If the purpose is immortality in a simulation, then it would have input provided to the various parts of the brain that process those inputs, and would experience the simulation.  If the upload is successful, the upload would have all the memories, and character traits as the original, and from the point of view of the upload, it would be the original. Depends on the circumstances. If you're unknowingly uploaded and placed in a sim that is indistinguishable from the reality you were in before, you're unlikely to notice. If the entity operating the sim doesn't want you to notice, they can alter your uploaded brain to make you literally unable to notice. If you're uploaded knowingly, you'll know. If the world is radically different, you'll notice, unless the operator is hostile and makes sure you don't. If I knew that, I'd be doing it."

That is not actually correct. Technically what is done is every ""block"" is transferred to a new location, a new reference is created saying ""the new blocks point to this new file"" then the old reference is removed. The actual data that made up the old file is generally preserved unless you use a secure delete tool, or another task overwrites it.  Similar here, the physical data might still be there, but it would no longer be ""you"" but just raw data that happened to have been you at some point. In the same way you can think of the ""you"" 10 years ago to be just raw data that over 10 years transformed into the ""you"" of today.

Will there be continuity of consciousness, or will what resides in the computer simply be a copy, with the original destroyed? That's something we have to figure out, before a lot of folks would consider it.   You are not considering the possibility that consciousness does not demand any sort of continuity. Your own consciousnesses is composed of millions of neural circuits, many of which spend most of their time in an ""off"" state. Copying yourself over to a computer could be similar to that. You go to sleep, and when you wake up you are in a computer. Perhaps you might still have access to the physical body, perhaps not.  In other words, your attachment to the ""continuity of consciousness"" is just another name for ""fear of the unknown."" If you fear the unknown they you will simply not be able to explore it. In the end it comes down to how much you identify with your body. If you have a sense of attachment to it then it would be hard to leave it behind.

That's wrong.  We've already got full brain simulations of simple flatworms and other small creatures and their digital simulations act just like the real things.  So let's say we had a way to scan in your whole brain and chemically tag each neuron's function.  Now let's say we have a computer that can emulate a neuron -- We do, that's easy.  Then all we need is enough CPU power to process 100 billion simulated neurons, and the brain being simulated would be the same as you.  A body?  That's just impulses from the brain stem.  Hearing, sight, etc. senses can be provided to the simulated brain by cameras, microphones, etc. that activate the proper simulated nerves -- As you seem to agree is possible.  Now, that's all fine and dandy.  The problem I have is that we won't call the hardware to do this a 'super computer'.  Your brain processes about as much info in 1 second as ~150 smart-phones can.  So, it won't be a super computer, it'll just be consumer hardware, and that's fine so long as you own that system.  Think about it for a moment though: A supercomputer would be a system capable of simulating thousands of brains.  Why would it bother running all of our puny simulations of brains when it could be a far more powerful entity on its own?  It could just impersonate the surface personality of people who are ""uploaded"" into it; Presenting a false digital life for the people while having a lot of blackmail material and being far more intelligent than any single mind on the planet.  Furthermore, as a cyberneticist I can tell you that my artificial neural networks which do things like object recognition are far more efficient than the simulation of scanned in retinal and visual cortex neurons -- And, yes, we are achieving similar behavior in the sim as the live neurons.    That is to say, emulating the precise existing neural pathways from a scan is far more taxing than running an optimized artificial neural network that can perform the same task.  So, even the computer that could contain a scan of a single brain and emulate it to make a digital you think in real time would have many times the processing power and data required than if the mind were completely artificially created.  The machine that could run your brain sim could instead just be self aware itself and FAR more intelligent than the brain it could simulate since it can simply have a simpler set of variables per neuron / axon instead of the many more variables for emulating a live electrochemical neuron.  TL;DR: If you do upload yourself into a computer, make sure it's not already alive and don't trust a ""cloud"" solution; You need to own your own hardware.  P.S. It also means that brain implants could fit far more brain power in the same skull space."

If we replace those biological synapses with computer implants it will still be the same as a brain upload, just slowly over time, but it still won't be us because we are a product of our hardware; replace the hardware, even with an exact copy, and you have a new person, just like twins.

Now, say that instead of removing it, I replace it with a patch of artificial/cybernetic neural tissue, configured to perfectly mimic the electrochemical behavior of the removed patch of tissue - I'm no less me than when I simply removed the original section, but I also haven't lost any of the experience/memory/skills/information/etc stored in the original patch of neural tissue, because it is perfectly reproduced in the cybernetic patch. So, at this point, I'm still me, and the total information content of my mind has undergone zero net change, correct?  The question then, assuming our neural implant technology is 100% perfect at replicating the information content of the neural tissue it is replacing, is how many times can we repeat this process before I am no longer me afterwards?  My personal opinion is that there is no limit - I'm no less me with a fully cybernetic brain than I would be with a fully cybernetic hand or foot."
Transhuman,1yrrxu,MemeticParadigm,1 point,Mon Feb 24 20:40:48 2014 UTC,"I don't see it that way.  If you remove a small section of your brain, or your leg, or what have you, and replace it with an artificial implant, it's still an artificial implant.  You may get the exact same functionality out of the implant, but it's not you anymore than a prosthetic leg is.  If you continued down that path you would be slowly killing off the real you; the digital you would be no different than a video or picture, and no more you.  At some point in there you'd cease being a living thing and become a biologically braindead cyborg; just a sack of meat.  It'd be death by a thousand cuts, but it'd still be the death.    The article even speaks to this in one of the interviews.  One of the researchers says he'd feel better about his biological death, knowing his digital self would continue on, but he makes the distinction that they are two separate individuals.   I think neural implant technology has a very bright future, but it will always remain an implant, because we will never be able to transcend our biological brains completely.  All this talk of uploading ourselves to a computer rests on the old idea that there's a soul in there that's more than the sum of our parts, but the reality is that who we are is intrinsically tied to our biological hardware.  The best we can hope for is implants combined with nanotech repair of our biological selves."

When, during the process of replacing 0.1mm sections of brain at a rate of 1 per week, do you cease to be you? You don't feel any different, any less you, after any individual replacement, and the implants themselves, once put in your brain, exhibit the same neural plasticity, the same modes of learning, as the rest of your brain, so they continue to evolve as part of your biological brain.   All this talk of uploading ourselves to a computer rests on the old idea that there's a soul in there that's more than the sum of our parts, but the reality is that who we are is intrinsically tied to our biological hardware.   Actually, it relies on the exact opposite, that everything we are is encoded in the network of neurons in the brain, and can therefore be instantiated digitally, whereas there is no reason to believe one could ""upload a soul"" by any means."

Everything is always in a constant state of flux, including human beings. Sure, after your brain is all artificial neurons or even being uploaded from there to a computer, you won't exactly be human anymore, at least in the traditional sense--especially once you crank up the processing power available to yourself--but that doesn't necessarily make it any less ""you."" ""You"" are just different at that point, just like you are different at any other point from what you used to be.  I'm not trying to argue that this is definitely going to be the case, because there is a shit-ton that we don't understand about the human brain yet, but it seems odd to continually assert that a very gradual transition from wetware to hardware is ABSOLUTELY going to result in something that ""wouldn't be you anymore than your twin is.""

But that's the only part that matters -- the functionality. We do not say people with artificial hearts are dead or aren't themselves. They're very much still alive by any reasonable definition. Why? Because artificial hearts provide the same functionality as a heart made of biological tissue -- pumping blood.   Neurons are much more complex than hearts or legs (and their inner workings are not completely understood yet), but it's the same principle. If you replace an individual neuron in the brain with an artificial one that performs identical functions to the previous biological one, then you wouldn't notice.   Logic would dictate that if you keep repeating this process and you can't pinpoint the exact moment where a person dies, then no such moment exists. Which makes a lot of sense, because this happens to us all the time naturally on a physical level (98% of atoms are replaced every year, on a higher level, the majority of your cells are replaced every 7 years)."

How do you handle mind clones? If I make 400 copies of myself, are they given the right to vote? If 50 subjective years down the line they have all diverged into different people, some of which are in opposition to each other on some or even many issues, are they then allowed to vote?  What if an AI is a slave to another entity (human or otherwise) and would vote according to that entity's wishes, is it allowed to vote? Is it allowed to be a slave even? It'll want to be, so ""rescuing"" it by reprogramming it away from slavery would go against its personal wishes. Who are we to decide it's ""wrong"" and we are in fact helping it by ""un-slaving"" it? Isn't that anthropocentric thinking? How do we even define slavery? What if someone is extremely in love with someone else (be it programmed to or ""naturally"" evolved) to the point that they will do anything asked of them. Is that considered a form of slavery? Should every entity have a right to seek out any qualia? What happens if someone is programmed to seek out pain and suffering? Do we let them? What is more important? Their free agency or their well-being? It could be seen as oppressive and an infringement on personal liberty to forbid certain types of qualia, but it could also be seen as irresponsible and unsympathetic to allow conscious entities to suffer. Even if that is their will. Do we ever have a right to edit another entities mind? What happens if a sadistic person creates a simple mind that exists in a state of perpetual extreme agony, but who is programmed to want that and to avoid alteration at any cost? How do we design rights for beings whose motivations and values are so alien from us that we cannot meaningfully relate to them? How do we co-exist and what happens if the rights of us and them somehow collide and there is an inability to satisfy both?   There is an endless ocean of questions that need to be asked and debated sooner or later. I just worry that there simply might not be any good answers to some of them.

Transhuman,1yodib,Sharou,1 point,Sun Feb 23 08:47:34 2014 UTC,"Short answers, i had l0nger ones typed up and the page went all derpy.  I'll expand on things as i need them.     The latter,  clones of this sort, exact copies of the mind is somewhat of a cheat, like voting more than once.  Multiple instances of the same individual are not, themselves, individuals.  They may be treated as such,  but collectively as a hive mind of sorts, it's ..overpowered.    In the title i specified Self-Awareness.  Any sort of programming would compromise the system.  In a similar mind-clone situation, programming an ai to do or think what you want..essentially extending your influence, is cheating. Love is an interesting subject, now if a free-will entity wished to please someone it loved by doing something it believed would please them. That is their right.  It's a similar issue with families or spouses sharing opinions and values or doing things to seek approval from each other. It isn't an issue of legality or rights so much as personal relationships.   This individual by definition would be considered mentally ill and would require treatment.  Wishing self-harm goes against the very idea of being a sapient free being, and acknowledging the needs of survival and life itself. From personal experience i'd say i'm somewhat an expert.   In situations where the rights of one group infringe on another, co-existence must be the goal above all else.  I'm unsure what sorts of rights would harm another.  If peace fails, and co-existence is not sustainable then measures must be taken to resolve any conflict and establish treaties or regulations. This was a vague question but i tried.  :-)   You are right though, i can only speak through my late-20th century   human  mind. Doesn't stop me from trying, doesn't curtail my empathy for future injustices or grievances.  I will do my part should my time come for my voice to be heard.    There will come a time where i will not be able to understand, it would take a future mind to tackle those future issues.  I just hope there's enough positive seeds planted in the present for those future minds to be good ones."
Transhuman,1yodib,Sharou,3,Sun Feb 23 09:36:33 2014 UTC,"I think my questions are more difficult than you give them credit for.   Clones would diverge more and more over time. Eventually there would conceivably be more difference between clone 1 and clone 2 than between clone 1 and stranger 1. How would it be fair to rob these clones of the right to vote for all eternity just because once upon a time they were near identical with some other minds? And if we want to give them voting rights at some point, when exactly should we? What is the deciding factor? Similarity? What if two unrelated minds randomly end up being very similar? Should one of them then lose their right to vote?  I think your distinction between being programmed and arriving ""naturally"" at a conclusion or desire is false. None of us chose to be who we are. It was decided for us by nature and circumstance. Furthermore, we all exert an influence over each other and over culture, who in turn influence us. At what point do you decide that an entity has ""too much"" influence over another? If someone is highly infatuated and would do anything for another person, you could define that as a mental illness if you wanted, ""going against the very idea of being a sapient free being"" as you put it. We are used to love because it's part of the human experience, but as we approach the singularity old human norms and experiences will not necessarily be the de facto standard but simply one among a nearly endless amount of perspectives. Other entities may find many of our behaviours to be ""bad for us"" and wish to change us out of sympathy. We may not want to be changed however. You could argue that and I personally would agree with you. But I'm sure many would not. Also, my example was extreme. For a more nuanced example, what if some people want to have pain enabled in for example a medieval fantasy sim (think, world of warcraft but ""real""). They might feel it enriches their experience over all and makes it more exciting. Should that also be considered a mental illness to be cured? Where should the threshold be for what pain we allow people to subject themselves to, if any? If we took a person who enjoyed playing this ""game"" with pain enabled and edited them so that they no longer did, their new selves would be happy with that and thank us for it. However the opposite is also true. If we took a player who was terrified of pain and always played with any and all forms of pain turned off; and edited them to appreciate the excitement of some amount of pain so that they could now play with it turned on, their new self would also be happy with the new situation and thank us for it. When every desire is malleable and able to be reprogrammed notions of desire can become very complicated. We could essentially program anyone to want anything, and program them to be happy about that and thankful that we edited them. What does this mean for the concepts of agency and self-determination? Should that even matter any more or should the elimination of pain and the proliferation of pleasure and fulfillment take presedence? Entities that have wildly different value systems could be at odds with one another in many ways. To take a real world example. Many westerners are against traditional muslim clothing on women such as burkas or hijabs because it is deemed oppressive. But many muslim women like this clothing and feel a sense of pride over it. Have they been brainwashed by the muslim patriarchy and need to be saved against their own judgement? Or is it simply a cultural difference that need to be bridged? Many westerners may find it unacceptable to let these practices go on. Many muslim women may feel genuinely oppressed by it, and many others may like it. As you can see it's a complex issue and this is still all within human civilization. The differences between human cultures may be big, but it will be nothing compared to the differences between post-human cultures once we open the pandoras box and shed the confines of our old human norms. Some entities may not value things we view as obvious, such as self preservation, or the need for variety. We might for example feel that a certain entity is missing out on all the things existence has to offer, while this entity is very happy just calculating pi or stacking boxes and would not desire to be ""helped"" in any way. Similarly another entity might feel your human activities are extremely limited and borish and want to ""help"" you by opening you up to other things. You might be perfectly happy with your human perspective though and would potentially struggle against any ""help"" and consider it a great violation of your agency. How could we possibly decide which perspective is more valid than another? Especially when the amount of different perspectives are more plentiful than we can comprehend and constantly exploding outwards in the cultural explosion of the singularity?"

With AI it's almost more authoritarian and enslavement because it's more ''you do this because i said so/programmed you to‘‘.  There's certain programmable traits that are far less invasive and damaging. Things like morality could be programmed or laws.  I think that's a lot different than programming things directly. It.s the difference between Force and Infuence.   I think this is more like kink, before it sounded like a cutter or someone suicidal.

Safety First! ;3    I think it comes down to the individual, if they like it and it doesn't do harm to others, they should have the option to explore or do what the desire. It's like, I make  the distinction of offering an alternative and forcing one. If someone is in a situation they  themselves deem oppressive,  they should be helped.  If someone is happy, let them be. I think it's more like ''would you like to'' or ''how do you feel about'' or whatever. I guess it's just different perspectives, and even within the same culture.

What that mean is that you keep your body in a total fast and suddenly you give it a shit load. The body slowly learns this pattern and as a natural reaction starts storing the fat (even turn protein into fat) so that after while your one meal a day wouldn't deprive it of the energy it needs. It just keeps building up fat but the fatter one gets the less activity occurs and In return most of that excess fat stacks up.

Transhuman,1yhuoy,TOK715,1 point,Fri Feb 21 14:30:41 2014 UTC,"That's fine, you seem to know what your are doing, I'll just highlight a lot of very recent studies suggesting low fat foods (rather than diets - to be fair you never said low fat foods only diet) seem to cause their own harm.  These studies are worth adding to your research:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23320900  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22810464  It may be that low fat foods reduce satiety and encourage carbohydrate consumption (or worse) or that the fat has been replaced by carbohydrate/sugar and this is what's doing the damage. But ultimately while I think trans fats are terribly toxic I think most natural fats in natural quantities are fairly harmless, since I switched to a high fat, high protein (paleolithic) diet, my fatty liver condition completely reversed and disappeared and my entire blood profile went from average (I never had that bad a diet) to perfect.  Seems fructose is also something that recent research shows has to be limited, especially where it is in free solution, such as in smoothies or soft drinks.  I just wonder where your calories are coming from - genuinely it could be from the alcohol (this might explain why alcoholics (not suggesting you are one) have better CV profiles than one might expect.  Sorry if this sounds preachy or know-it-all, seems we have the same goals and similar medical knowledge so any gaping differences of opinion (NB I'm not clear we have one here in any case) make me worried I might have it wrong!

Transhuman,1yhuoy,dandelusional,0,Fri Feb 21 16:09:15 2014 UTC,"Some of the evidence. This is a very contentious area, and the weight of evidence still doesn't support the high fat / low carb thing. There's also a lot of evidence to support the fact that eating meat & dairy is very harmful. One thing that pretty much everyone can agree on though is that we (in the west) should in general be eating a lot more fresh fruits and vegetables.  Even if the evidence does stack up, low carb is absolutely not suitable for everyone. For instance, I do a moderately high amount of cardio (mountain biking, running, skiing) and if I were to eat a low carb diet I'd be literally running out of fuel and unable to do what I do."
Transhuman,1yhuoy,TOK715,1 point,Thu Feb 27 10:56:47 2014 UTC,"Well it is contentious, but I think that's only due to vested interests and momentum. I think if you actually look at the evidence that has come out it is pretty clear.  Red meat does seem to be harmful, but it's for a different reason, it has something to do with an immunological/inflammatory response in humans to proteins contained in red meat. Dairy while, not perfect is probably OK (certainly relative to other foods).  Also we should be eating a little more fruit and a lot more vegetables (fruit has a lot of carbs, and fructose is bad in large quantities.)  As for carbs for cardio workouts, cavemen did a lot of chasing down mammoths on a largely carb free diet, the tiredness people experience when they exercise without carbs is probably just down to the body being used to a carb diet, it doesn't affect people once they have had a low carb diet for a few weeks. Really even intense cardio workout don't burn that many calories in and of themselves."
Transhuman,1yhuoy,solaryn,0,Fri Feb 21 01:52:01 2014 UTC,The japanese eat a very high carb diet (lots of rice) but very little sugar and tend to live long lives.  The Atkins diet has been showing a lot of excellent results as well (it appears to the be the polar opposite of a Japanese diet).   The common ground is that they're both low-sugar diets (although I don't think a causal relationship has been established).  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM
Transhuman,1yhuoy,TOK715,0,Fri Feb 21 14:42:24 2014 UTC,"Traditionally the Japanese don't eat that many carbs, rice is far lower in carbs than potato, wheat or corn (as it has a lot of water content). Traditionally they also used to eat brown rice (rice in any event was in very short supply until after the war) which is even healthier. I would say traditional longevity in Japan was a combination of low calorie intake overall, exercise and a varied and nutritious (albeit low calorie) diet. More recently it is down to a cutting edge healthcare system.  In the last decade or so, many Japanese have increased their carb intake (due to bread and potato increases) and many Japanese are getting overweight these days, so I am not sure the health will continue to lead the world.  Sugar and carbs are really the same thing, the only difference is how smoothly they are released into the blood.  So I regard the traditional Japanese diet to be low in total carbohydrates (if not in percentage intake) and so not entirely dissimilar to the atkins, but these days I think the Japanese diet is pretty carb heavy and any remaining differences in health are due to legacy benefits or better quality healthcare.  Just to say I write professionally about medical issues and am a long term resident in Japan, that's not to say what I said is infallible or any more valid than others opinions, but these are issues I am fairly familiar with, though I have drawn my own opinions based on the limited evidence available, I am open to other's views."

I suggest before discussing further you should study evolutionary biology as well as systems theory and astronomy. We really can't have a discussion without a common frame of reference, in this case, a solid grounding in hard science.   I get your argument, but I don't understand how a supporter of this hypothesis somehow is throwing their life away since we're both communicating via the internet. Artificial Intelligence will change EVERYTHING like it or not and ready or not. I'm not talking the conversational type either, but the type that understands global weather and traffic patterns simultaneously and can plot logistics needs for a city several months in advance. These technologies are coming and through extremely deep information mining we will glean understandings and patterns which will allow us to solve problems and accomplish challenges which we as future grandparents will be extremely proud to see our children and grandchildren accomplish.   Essentially what society has been trending towards is something Bucky Fuller called ""Ephemeralization"" that is, Doing more with less until eventually you can do almost everything with almost nothing.  Thats the crux of a singularity. Being able to do things previously unimaginable by earlier generations because the technology to enable it was not existent yet, usually this comes in the form of AI, or human augmentation at a base level in popular theorizing. Of course, your negative outcome argument is also contingent on a leap of faith, that things will ALWAYS stay the same. Such thinking often dooms a country or people when newer smarter countries and people show up. Proceed with caution there Mr.Stringman argument.   Also, please don't use the word ""believe"" and ""faith"" I don't know why you need to use that. Nobody is banking their lives on this hypothesis. Anybody with a rational mind knows this is a compelling hypothesis with a strong human interest element. We are at a crossroads in evolution and technology is progressing in such a way that a few new inventions can reinvent the world.

Linchpin changes are also easy (see allegorical spec-fic stuff like In Time). It's the emergent, chaotic changes of an entirely upended civilization that are impossible or at least difficult.  I mean, did the baby-boomers see this world coming? Fuck no, they didn't."
Transhuman,1yi8vw,G3n3r4lch13f,6,Fri Feb 21 17:12:13 2014 UTC,"I suspect that the baby boomers did anticipate many changes (space exploration, crony capitalism, materials science), but the internet and molecular biology were unexpected because their foundational philosophies literally did not exist in the 50s and 60s.  The lesson here is that all things are developing in parallel. With interactions between them, yes. But more importantly, the discovery of wholly new areas of knowledge are, by definition, unpredictable. It is the extrapolation of what we already know about which is possible -- and that's why Kurzweil has been so accurate. He hasn't attempted to predict entirely new fields of knowledge or radical paradigm shifts, he's merely seen where the maturation of existing technology must lead.  When we get close enough to breakthroughs it becomes possible to make educated guesses about the next birth in science and technology. We're close enough now to a breakthrough in neuroscience / AI that we can confidently expect that we'll soon discover something. And we expect physics to make another leap soon-ish because we know what we're waiting on before we can begin the development of our next family of theories.  But we don't know enough about the evolution of culture, society, economy to be able to make predictions further than, oh, about a decade in advance. We should hope for a revolution in moral philosophy (or, I should say, a revolution in the education of moral philosophy...) and a paradigm shift in economics (which we actually know a good bit about, the trick will be to convince the public to adopt this new economic paradigm before it's too late)."

And, as far as I have seen, people in this subreddit are largely sceptical towards the kurzweilian timeline (by being sceptical I don't necessarily mean they outright reject it, but see it as far from a given). I also don't really see people living their lives differently other than trying to stay healthy, and how is staying healthy bad in any way even if the singularity doesn't happen in our lifetimes?  What I do see is people discussing and theorizing over the singularity, which is very important to do as far in advance as possible, given that the singularity will be the most disruptive time in human history with potentially catastrophic consequences. Far from everyone sees the singularity as being likely to have a positive outcome for humans. In fact a very common belief among singularitarian thinkers is that humanity has a very small chance to survive it. Many even believe that singularity type events is what constitutes ""the great filter"" which explains the fermi paradox. Whether it happens tomorrow or in 1000 years it will be an extremely volatile period where the smallest factors can decide the future of this planet, or indeed the galaxy, should we survive it. An event like that should be discussed at length before it happens, so thank god people are talking about it!  If you actually believe you have a case as to why the singularity is unlikely to ever happen, I would love to hear it. But I've yet to hear any arguments for this that aren't based in ignorance or simple incredulity."
Transhuman,1yi8vw,ZapActions-dower,1 point,Fri Feb 21 10:17:59 2014 UTC,"All Kurzweil can really do is predict a timeline where technologies will be available in some form and potentially produce x paradigm shift. He's good at that. What he's less good at, what he'd have to be psychic or something to be good at, is how society will actually engage with or use those technologies. Typically, we don't do paradigm shifts all at once, but gradually to a point where we wake up one day and realize the world is entirely fucking different.  Case in point: wearable computing. We could have had wearable computing in the 90's as Kurzweil basically always maintained. The technology existed. But he was missing a key piece of intangibility in his prognostications: fashion. Nobody was going to walk around with computers the size of backpacks strapped to them, computers which only 20 years later are the size of a pocket watch (or smaller). This means that miniaturization and a top-down saturation of computing tech had to intersect with the convenience of wearable computing for it to even begin to be marketable to the public. Even with that, Google Glass and other such devices have a tall hill to climb with fashion and user prejudice, intangible and emotional factors which are impossible for anyone to predict.  Likewise, when our computers start talking back to us we're as likely to react with terror and existential crises as we are to accept them or grant them personhood. My bet is that Kurzweil is essentially right about where the consensus will trend eventually, but he overlooks the fits, starts, and growing pains that get us there."

You just don't like the implications. If someone came up to me and had real matter of fact reasons why he was going to win the lottery in ten years, it is only preposterous if he is wrong, and we should be able to demonstrate that he is wrong. If we can't, and he can demonstrate that he is right, then the appropriate assumption is that he will win the lottery in ten years. We have predictive methods for a reason.   Also, who are you observing who is acting in this way. I know a lot of people who believe that a singularity will occur, not necessarily in their natural life spans, who do not act anything like how you are describing. Most of them study, and work to get good jobs, so they can generate money and help the singularity come sooner and more safely. Your argument would be stronger if you could cite any examples of people who act the way you describe after believing in the singularity and not before.   So here is what would make your argument stronger and not just rambling   Show where predictive models are wrong, or reach sufficiently different probabilities than is correct. Find some transhumanists, or singularitarians who act in the way you describe. If you can't, or can only find a couple, then evidence points to your understanding of this group is lacking. The correct thing to do would be to look at the subreddit, or other places where the singularity is discussed, and see how those people act. That is how people act when they believe in the singularity. Find a way to disprove the fallacy from consequence of belief.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_consequences"

This is based on an appeal to emotion and is a type of informal fallacy, since the desirability of a consequence does not make it true. Moreover, in categorizing consequences as either desirable or undesirable, such arguments inherently contain subjective points of view.

After all, we have no idea when it will occur (or even if, though it seems very likely), nor do we know what changes it will truly entail, solely because of the nature of the event. With that in mind, it'd be most logical to live as if it won't occur or to live in such a way that benefits you in the here and now while simultaneously preparing yourself to live in what you anticipate the future to be like (for example, perfecting skills that might be more beneficial in a post-scarcity or high technology society).  In all honesty, I'm likely to live my life relatively similar post-singularity as I do pre-singularity, if the singularity is anything like I suspect it might be. Sure, I might have access to better tech, easier access to knowledge and communication, etc., but I'll likely still be hanging out with friends, playing video games, reading books, surfing the web (or equivalent), working at some job or career, etc. So why bother changing now for a future that we can't predict, unless said changes are useful in the present as well?

They are looking at Moore's Law and imagining what happens when the availability of info drops to near-zero, when processing speeds surpass those of the human brain, making transhumanist widgets like onboard virtual assistants or whatever widget you can extrapolate from the tech on the table, possible.

As such our minds will one day be able to choose an escape from their body's brain other than death.  We have always sought heaven, and now we are about to create it on Earth.  It's a beautiful thing, nothing to be afraid about.  Some day when we tell our children that grandma has died and gone to a better place, we won't be lying -- She'll send regular e-cards from amidst Saturn's diamond rain."

One could say that a transhumanist is a technologist who is aware of the current rapid transformation of the human condition via technology and able to extrapolate this trend to the future.   People fear what they don't understand, and few understand what it means to be a transhumanist. It is therefore our task to help them understand, first and foremost to help them realise that they are already sort of transhumanists already, they just haven't thought far enough ahead yet."

Transhuman,1xrhop,trifith,2,Thu Feb 13 14:08:15 2014 UTC,"That's a mistake in your understanding.  Emergent properties are behaviours and characteristics which arise from the physical nature of the system; it's the concept that seemingly complex behaviours can actually arise from the interaction between multiple more simple mechanics.  For example; feather-like ice crystals forming on windows on cold days are an emergent system. They form because of the interaction between moisture, cold air, and glass - each of which is a relatively simple thing mechanically, but when they're combined they form intricate and minute patterns of ice.  In a similar way, our intelligence is an emergent property of our brain. Our intellect arises because of the physical properties of the chemical reactions and physical structure of the neural network in our heads.  We don't understand the precise mechanisms for how it all works just yet, but we know that it does work in such a way. We see evidence of this every time we see, for example, damage to the brain causing a loss of functionality, deterioration such as with alzheimer's, eroding memory. We see it when we observe parts of a person's brain essentially taking over and performing the function of a damaged part of their brain.  Emergence is established theory, with a wealth of evidence supporting it. It's not ""magic"", it's not something ""nobody understands."""
Transhuman,1xrhop,pyrespirit,0,Sat Feb 22 21:18:40 2014 UTC,"So ""We don't understand the precise mechanisms for how it all works"" is somehow different from ""not something 'nobody understands.'"" Your position is contradicting itself.   If we don't understand how an emergent process works, calling it emergent doesn't explain it, and you are no better off using the word emergent than you are using the word magic. At least if you're using the word magic, you know you don't actually understand and don't fool yourself into thinking you do."

They are taught, generally, that ""Atheists"" are bad people, and that someone who thinks something so radically different from them is bad. It's second nature to Humans. As such, to escape this stereotype, some atheists took to calling themselves ""Brights"" or ""Freethinkers"", while homosexuals called themselves ""Gay"". This would avoid any charged pejoratives from people who dislike them.  In the same vein, you're asking transhumanists to apply a new label to themselves, which frankly I see as pretty useless. I won't put a coat on a goat for you; no matter what you call yourself, your historic labels will always stick with you. A rose by any other name...  Gays are still homosexuals, Freethinkers are still Atheists and ""technoprogressives"" are still transhumanists.

It has been for quite some time now, but this is a record high. When is man going to learn that they CANNOT change nature, for the better at least. Nature is perfectly imperfect, or imperfectly perfect, if you will. They are toying with things they should not be, and they won't learn better until the rest of us have to pay for it. The last time I checked, science was about preserving nature, understanding HOW it worked, at best! Not changing it! That goes against everything.

I'm also not actually saying immortality would be a good thing as it would lead to a lot of asshole, racist, and others potentially monopolizing parts of society (what /u/brtt3000 was getting at I think) rather than making way for new ideas. But if we do decide we want to develop it, it should be as egalitarian as possible, and that means not excluding anyone (even the racist, assholes, and rich bastards)."

Just from a strict economic point of view, if you develop a new medical technology, almost all the cost goes into the R&D of developing it, so you then want to sell it to as many people as possible. The cliche is ""the first pill costs 10 million dollars, the second pill costs 50 cents"".  Basically it doesn't make economic sense to develop a new medical technology and then not price it at a point where at least everyone in the first-world middle class would have access to it. (In practice, that would mean ""everyone in countries with socalized medicane, and everyone in the US with health insurance"")  And that's just the free-market side of things.   If you add in the very strong political pressures from the voting public to make it widely available, and the ""torches and pitchforks"" factor (people just will not sit back and watch their parents age to death slowly and painfully if there is a working cure available), I think that it's very unlikely that a new anti-aging technology would stay in the hands of juts the super rich for any significant amount of time.  One way or the other, it will become widespread.  (Probably the only even remotely plausible scenario I can come up with where it doesn't become widespread is if it is banned legally, and only the rich can afford it on the black market.)"
Transhuman,1xj8jr,NULLACCOUNT,1 point,Mon Feb 10 21:57:56 2014 UTC,"so you then want to sell it to as many people as possible.    No, you want to make as much money as possible. If you can make more money by selling each pill for $10 million (so that despite having less customers you still have enough that you are making more than if you sold it to more people at $1000), than you will. This is why some programs like games might cost $50, but others like Photoshop cost $500. Less people will buy photoshop for $500 than for $50, but it won't be 90% less (because most people buying it need for their work, meaning even at $500 it will pay off), so it is still more profitable for them to sell it at that price point than at a lower price point and have more people buy it. (If it was more profitable for them to sell it at a lower price point, they would.)  I really don't see how a black market would prevent it from becoming widespread. Most people have access to a black market of some sort or another (or would find access if the demand was high enough). All that matters is the price and the price will be whatever price yields the most profits, which with IP (or other ""50 cent"" items) is almost entirely determined by demand, not supply. Something like immortality (or healthcare even) are very high demand items and thus command a very high price. Someone with 10.1 million would probably pay 10 million for immortality.  Yes, eventually the price will probably come down because once everyone who can afford to pay 10 million has bought it, they will try to sell it to everyone with 9 million, etc. But how long it takes for that price to come down is the question. I don't know, I'm not sure there are any good historical examples of something like this.  But perhaps more important, I'm not just talking about the first-world middle class. I'm talking about everyone."

The point is that you just don't make nearly as much money that way.      There are likely to be maybe 100 people who would buy your drug from you at that price.  Even most multimillionaires who could afford it would probably just wait 5 years for the price to come down, unless they are already very old. Meanwhile, popular drugs today are sometimes worth hundreds of billions of dollars to the pharm companies, and an anti-aging drug that literally everyone would benefit from would potentially be a much larger market.     This is why some programs like games might cost $50, but others like Photoshop cost $500.    You know what the difference is?  Market size.  The number of people who want to buy photoshop are much smaller, so you have to charge more for it in order to get your investment back.

I really don't see how a black market would prevent it from becoming widespread.    It would depend on the details.

Getting health care to the poor and to the third world is a big issue now, and it's an important goal and one we need to fight for.

Transhuman,1xj8jr,Canadian_Infidel,1 point,Tue Feb 11 21:20:45 2014 UTC,"There are likely to be maybe 100 people who would buy your drug from you at that price.   I think you are underestimating the income disparity in the world.   Roughly 1.0% of high net worth individuals (HNWIs) can also correctly be identified as ultra-high-net-worth individuals (ultra-HNWIs), those who reside in households with a net worth or wealth of $30 million or more. There are approximately 95,000 ultra-HNWIs   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millionaire#Multimillionaire (I'm sure there are better sources, that was just a quick one.)  How they choose to purchase it might be more complicated (some might first purchase it for elderly individuals in their family, then try to make enough to purchase it for themselves. Others would purchase it for themselves immediately.) but I think pretty much all of those 96,000 people would buy at least 1 immortality even at $10 million. That's at least $960 Billion. Probably more (people with $100 million buying 10, etc. plus who knows how many with $10.1 million buying 1).   You know what the difference is? Market size. The number of people who want to buy photoshop are much smaller, so you have to charge more for it in order to get your investment back. Same reason text books are so much more expensive then novels.   I think this has more to do with demand than market size. Market size effects it too, but the market for alternate history novels is much smaller than the market for teen romance novels, but I don't think alternate history novels cost that much more. If they do cost that much more, it's because the people who buy them are willing to pay more, not because there are less of them.   Again, with photoshop and textbooks, they are required for certain professions, so the people who are in the market for them are willing to pay more for them rather than choose not to buy them. This is why I think many people even with just $10.1 million would purchase it. By living forever you would have a decent chance of making your money back, so it is an investment in addition to a luxury and/or health expense.    It would depend on the details.   True. If it is a complicated procedure (which it probably would be) access would be much more limited.   Also, remember that you only have 12 years before someone else can make a generic version   That's an interesting point. However if it was a proceedure, not just a drug, I think it could be under patent longer, and I think might be able to be extended by filing for another application (which would still prevent derivatives). It could also be kept as a trade secret and never patented, which might actually be the safer option (if it was an involved procedure). But still, yes, unless it was a very closely guarded trade secret, there would probably be more competition at some point before 100 years from now.  (A standard U.S. patent would be 20 years I think)   not to mention the fact that there that discovery would immediately encourage every other pharm company on the planet to try to develop a newer and better anti-aging drug to compete to yours. You don't have time to wait for that; you have to get it to the mass market right away, to sell it to everyone with medical coverage basically tomorrow, because if you wait you're not going to get any of the market.   Well, a few things. One if it is patented, they might not be able to develop a similar product without infringing on the patent. Two, as you said, these are massive research projects. They take years to come to market (and usually decades of research before that). The original company would probably know a few years in advance if a competitors product was close to release and could just drop prices then.   There are any number of reasons why no medical advance in history has been sold that way.   I'm not sure what you mean by this. Like you said, pills only cost a few dollars at most to produce but regularly cost hundreds of dollars or more. There are plenty of advanced treatments that only the wealthy can afford but not the poor.   That's a whole different question.   Yeah, but my point is while maybe there would be a price point (say ~$30,000) that most of the first-world middle class could afford, and still be as profitable as selling to the ultra rich (although I still think they wouldn't sell to the middle class until they ultra rich market was fully saturated), it would probably be quite a few decades before it would be affordable to people in third world nations.   An anti-aging treatment wouldn't be any different from any other kind of health care   It would be different in that it would be the most demanded and highest priced healthcare treatment ever invented."

Like you said, pills only cost a few dollars at most to produce but regularly cost hundreds of dollars or more.    Remember, the statement I am defending here is at the minimum that everyone with medical insurance (basically, people in US with medical coverage, people in other first world countries with socalizied medicane) would have access to the drug or treatment, not that it would be cheap.   Yes, there are drugs that cost hundreds of dollars, but everyone with health insurance has access to them.  I have no doubt that an anti-aging drug would be very, very profitable.   I just think that ""hundreds of dollars a pill"" is plausable, but ""ten million dollars a pill"" is not.    If nothing else, pharm companies would recognize the potential for massive political backlash; they've already had cases where countries like India just decided to ignore their patents, and if they tried to charge tens of millions of dollars for something that vital, then I think most countries in the world would just ignore the patent and provide it for their own citizens.   It would be different in that it would be the most demanded and highest priced healthcare treatment ever invented.   Demanded, sure, but not highest priced.  If anything the very large scale of the market would tend to encourage them to price it lower, to recover their investment faster.  One interesting thing about a treatment that reverses aging, compared to a lot of other health care treatments, is that you really have time to shop around and look at different options; potentially even years.  It's not like a heart medicine where you have to buy it today or you die."

The copy of you running when you enter sleep ceases to exist (and we can prove that with brain scans as the electrical activity ramps down and patterns of consciousness disappear from the scan). A fresh electrical pattern forms as one wakes up in the morning.   Sure, there's still some basic, low level activity there. What isn't there is you and your sense of self. From your perspective, you time-traveled 8 hours from evening to the next morning without existing during the interval.  Exercise: Prove that the version of you that wakes up in the morning is the same version of you that went to sleep - and not just a fresh clone booted off of non-volatile physical storage (brain matter)."
Transhuman,1xj8jr,ckwing,3,Mon Feb 10 20:19:35 2014 UTC,That also assumes that continuity of consciousness is necessary for continuity of self. A cessation of conscious activity during sleep does not have to mean that the person is 'wiped'.
Transhuman,1xj8jr,mflood,1 point,Tue Feb 11 06:29:04 2014 UTC,"My point is that one can't prove it either way.   You can't prove the cessation of conscious activity isn't the 'end' of one mental copy of a person any more than I can prove that it is. All we know for sure is there's a disruption because the sense of self is suppressed.  A moravec transfer would cause less interruption to a conscious mind than sleeping does, so that throws quite a wrench into the position of claiming that any upload is a copy and not the original.   If sleeping does not cause you to 'die' each night and be reborn as a new 'copy' each morning, then a moravec transfer is guaranteed to be a successful upload of the original consciousness that is at least as much the original as the person who wakes up the next day.  On the other hand, if someone argues that mind uploading is impossible, they are stuck with the idea that a process like sleep, more disruptive than a mind upload, must also kill them every night. By their own definition, they only live a single day, and each new day is just a new copy.  It's a catch-22 I enjoy unleashing on people who get stuck in 'defense of the soul' mode when these transporter discussions come up. Then I have to explain to them that all they really are is an information pattern anyway, and that's as good a definition of a soul as any other... but it has consequences, such as being able to be copied, or multiple copies able to be re-integrated into one."

The ""you"" of now is not, materially speaking, the ""you"" of three minutes ago. As we speak you are ""uploading"" your consciousness to new substrata. A tiny part of you has died, but the overarching pattern continues into new hardware. If that hardware should be made of silicon instead of flesh, has anything really changed? If the flesh portion of the new hybrid brain should die, is that not the same as a cell dying within a conventional mind?

We don't think that they ""died."" Why, then, do we need to slowly phase out our organic matter?  Why shouldn't it be just another standard medical procedure? Put someone under, copy their state to a machine, then turn the machine on and the flesh off. Boom, you wake up as ""you,"" just as you would have from a tonsillectomy.

It's pretty clear to me that we don't understand consciousness and that until we do, making an irreversible decision would probably not be a good idea. Mostly I just like to argue the opposite side when someone takes a definitive position. You seemed pretty sure that transferring consciousness = copy + death, and I just wanted to shake you up a bit. If consciousness is not materialistic and lapses in consciousness do not equal death, well. . .*shrugs*.

Transhuman,1xj8jr,beatsdropheavy,2,Tue Feb 11 23:38:26 2014 UTC,"Wikipedia says that there is significant neuronal generation in areas of the brain such as the Hippocampus and Olfactory bulb. Other cells (glial cells are an example, I think) experience relatively rapid turnover and, while they don't directly transmit signals, they do modulate and change the signals sent in many cases. Even if the brain doesn't function as a Ship of Theseus, though, it still definitely changes its hardware over time: new neurons are generated, neurons are lost, connections grow where they didn't exist before, etc. If the hardware changes but you are still ""you,"" then my point is the same; you're not who you were a few minutes ago, and yet your consciousness, your ""real you,"" has somehow made the transition to the new configuration. And if such transitions are possible, then the door is definitely open to the idea of uploading one's consciousness to a machine. Or at least, so it seems to me."

The paradox is most notably recorded by Plutarch in Life of Theseus from the late 1st century. Plutarch asked whether a ship which was restored by replacing each and every one of its wooden parts, remained the same ship.  The paradox had been discussed by more ancient philosophers such as Heraclitus, Socrates, and Plato prior to Plutarch's writings; and more recently by Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. There are several variants, notably ""grandfather's axe"". This thought experiment is ""a model for the philosophers""; some say, ""it remained the same,"" some saying, ""it did not remain the same"".

Transhuman,1xj8jr,mflood,1 point,Mon Feb 10 21:01:47 2014 UTC,"The way i've worked around this problem is the following. There would be two consciousness, one would be the original, a human being for example, and the other would be artificial; a conscious computer if you will.   All it would take is to figure out a way to connect both consciousness in a manner that each can experience what the other is experiencing; merge the two consciousness into one. That way when the human passes away, the computer seamlessly continues the humans experiences and memories as if it were the human, and for all intents and purposes it is the human since at one point the human and computer consciousness was one.  Personally, if such a thing was possible I would feel comfortable with passing away in my human form knowing that I would continue living seamlessly through an artificial medium. It's just like creating a new memory (edit: are we afraid of creating new memories just because we won't be exactly the same person we were before those memories were created?), or adding a lobe to the brain that holds all of the original brains content.   I really don't see a problem with merging with technology as a form of life expansion. Once it is possible and we can experience what its like I think most will be comfortable with doing it."
Transhuman,1xj8jr,etherspin,4,Mon Feb 10 21:49:00 2014 UTC,"Lets say he uploaded his consciousness to ""the cloud"" without destroying the body. The original consciousness would still be there. This is because when you transfer information, there is no real ""transfer"" only the copying of data. So if you make a copy of his memories, personality, etc and destroy the original, the original is still ceasing to exist. The original never gets to run around on the internet. For all intents and purposes, the him that gets to run around on the internet is his child."
Transhuman,1xj8jr,latesleeper89,4,Thu Feb 13 08:25:35 2014 UTC,"Ah, but it's not that simple. Consider the fact that your body's cells and component atoms are constantly turning over. Your brain is literally not the same brain it was yesterday, yet you still consider yourself to be ""you."" Doesn't that imply that ""consciousness"" depends on the pattern rather than the material? Furthermore, during certain traumatic events (extreme hypothermia, for example), the brain completely shuts down; there is no consciousness whatsoever, yet when you wake up, you still think you're ""you."" THAT seems to imply that continuity of consciousness doesn't matter. Given those two conclusions, why is mind uploading not possible? If we can turn you off, perfectly replicate your pattern of consciousness in a new material, and then turn that pattern on. . .why is it not you? Anyway, there are thought experiments on both sides of the fence, and honestly I don't really know which way I lean. And neither, from what I can tell, does modern science. We don't know the true nature of consciousness or self. Which is why I don't think you should so confidently assert that mind uploading = death. You might be right, but there are some compelling arguments in the other direction, too."

If there is absolutely no measurable difference between X and Y, if there is no test you could even theoretically preform to distinguish X from Y, then X=Y.   (The same is true of a 100% precise simulation of person X.)  Basically, if you're going to claim ""an exact copy of person X is NOT person X"", then I would have to ask you ""Is that a testable hypothesis?  Does that hypothesis in any way change your predictions of how person X is going to act?    If you woke up one morning, and I told you that overnight you had been replaced by an exact copy of yourself, would that change anything meaningful at all about your life?""

Also, it's hard to believe many of our current memes will survive unscathed when we begin to fundamentally alter the human brain, modifying it with whatever means we have access to. I expect that this century will be so turbulent that society will be radically different by 2100.  There is still concern that whatever memes we are left with afterward will not undergo the same rate of evolution because brains will not die and be replaced with younger ones at the same rate. We could very well end up with a stable yet stagnant society. It's almost impossible to speculate about this, however, since society then will be comprised of extra-human and non-human intelligences (A.I.s). We simply can't predict how the people this far into the future will behave with any significant accuracy.   One thing to note is that society is now evolving more quickly than ever before, and we haven't even begun significantly extending people's lives. It seems to me that science, technology, and engineering are the main drivers of societal change, not the death of the older generations.

I highly recommend a book by Peter Diamandis called Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think, which explores how advanced technologies will eliminate the scarcity of water, food, and energy. For example, you can simply harvest water from the oceans if you have enough energy, instead of fighting over the scarce fresh-water supplies. You can utilize hydroponics, robotics, and vertical farming to drastically increase food production while increasing the efficiency of its distribution.  Essentially, an economy can transition from scarcity to abundance by exploiting technologies like robotics, nanotechnology, and biotechnology. This is just a possibility, however.

There are Winter and Summer Paralympic Games, which since the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea, are held immediately following the respective Olympic Games. All Paralympic Games are governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC).  The Paralympics have grown from a small gathering of British World War II veterans in 1948 to become one of the largest international sporting events by the early 21st century. Paralympians strive for equal treatment with non-disabled Olympic athletes, but there is a large funding gap between Olympic and Paralympic athletes.  The Paralympic Games are organized in parallel with the Olympic Games, while the IOC-recognized Special Olympics World Games include athletes with intellectual disabilities, and the Deaflympics include deaf athletes.    The present formal explanation for the name ""Paralympic"" is that it derives from the Greek preposition παρά, pará (""beside"" or ""alongside"") and thus refers to a competition held in parallel with the Olympic Games.  The Summer Games of 1988 held in Seoul was the first time the term ""Paralympic"" came into official use.  Given the wide variety of disabilities that Paralympic athletes have, there are several categories in which the athletes compete. The allowable disabilities are broken down into six broad categories. The categories are amputee, cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, wheelchair, visually impaired, and Les Autres (literally ""The Others"", which are athletes with disabilities that do not fall into the other five categories; these include dwarfism, multiple sclerosis, and congenital disorders). These categories are further broken down into classifications, which vary from sport to sport. The classification system has led to cheating controversies revolving around athletes who over-stated their disabilities, in addition to the use of performance-enhancing drugs seen in other events.

Therefore existing in two places at the same time is not so different than existing at two times at once.   So, you have two options: To believe that in spite of the changes that make you and you-tomorrow different you will survive the night, in which case you will have to conclude that existing in two places at once is possible, OR you have to conclude that neither your copy nor your future self are really you.

Transhuman,1xbyc7,Agarrett777,10,Sat Feb 8 04:07:28 2014 UTC,"Your planet is not a closed system.  In reality the sun powers the Earth's biosphere.  There is more solar energy dumped onto the earth every year than twice of what is available in every non renewable resource combined (uranium, coal, oil, etc) -- And twice as much solar energy than this reaches the upper atmosphere, but is reflected (30%) or absorbed by the air and clouds (20%).  So, cast off the atmosphere and you get even more power for critters that directly utilize solar energy.  Life is powered by whatever available and abundant source of energy there is, the cosmos is chock full of gravity furnaces (read: stars).  That is why our more sturdy inorganic bodies should be built to withstand cosmic rays and survive the harshness of space.  That way we can live almost everywhere there is energy to extract.  We'll need to store energy for long trips to distant stars; Otherwise we will be exincted if not by the sun exploding, than by our solar system getting whipped out of the galaxy when it merges with Andromeda. We need to move closer in to the galactic hub where there is more radiation, but more gravity to ensure we won't be tossed out into the cold and lonely intergalactic space.  To spread our spark of life between galaxies we'll need as many resources as we can get -- The sol system may not be enough.  Imagine an impact of a planet consumed with 'grey-goo' by an asteroid.  Surely some will be flung far and wide -- Tons of Earth resides on mars, its moons, Europa, titan, and all the major celestial bodies.  Such a system will spread.  However, being a cybeneticist familiar with information theory I find the grey goo hypothesis highly unlikely.   Autonomy requires a degree of information for cognition that nano machines just can't contain given the laws of this universe.  Without a system of governance competition will emerge and invariably tend towards more complex, and thus larger, forms.  Even in a truly cooperative hive mind you'll find specialization of the individual units and message passing at greater levels forming the mind.  Your brain is the size it is because the laws of entropy destroy structure at lesser scales.  We may make sentient systems smaller than your brain, but not too much smaller -- certainly not nano-scale.  So, unawareness breeds competition and diversity, and awareness requires larger than goo components.  The goo is circumvented by the cybernetic processes that govern all interaction.  A self assembling structure for intelligence that is formed perhaps by fractal nature, as the first complex life on this planet was, may be possible but that would be more of a ""crystalline"" system that resists self competition, not a goo.  More complex, flexible, and thus adaptable forms must contain programming -- Hence your cells all contain the program of their construction and function which is bootstrapped atop the core self reproductive message of life.  We simply can't squeeze much intelligence into forms of this size.  What I find interesting is that you already live in a ""grey goo"".  Your body is teeming with bacteria and other bugs.  Whatever defense the goo has against self destruction by accidental 'cancerous' mutation the more complex (larger) systems can use to shield themselves while feeding on the goo -- And yet other systems will feed upon these.  The grey goo hypothesis is narrow-minded and ignorant.  It would merely be another abiogenesis, complete with all the trappings life normally comes with.  This is not due to design, but the fundamental laws of thermodynamics, and thus information.  The laws of existence itself prevents a monoculture of such small scale things."

Transhuman,1xbyc7,digital_evolution,1 point,Sun Feb 9 01:23:30 2014 UTC,", That's an excellent addition to why grey goo couldn't work, but if I could expand on that in terms of energy though, it would still be unfeasible. There is certainly enough energy on Earth to facilitate the replication of small-scale nanobots, and I would accept that there clearly is massive amounts of energy available in places like stars. However, I am simply arguing that it is impossible for such nanobots to harness that energy to replicate at the rate which the grey goo scenario would require.    If we look at a self-replicating entity in the form of life on a micro or even nano-scale, we can see that it already utilizes solar energy in the most evolutionarily efficient way through photosynthesis. Bacteria replicate, sometimes even relatively quickly, but they remain at a level that is manageable.  I think that these traits are actually an addition to the usefulness of nanotechnology. True, we won't have the ability for nanobots to quickly multiply where it would be useful for certain tasks, but it prevents the possibility of future entities completely destroying the planet. Nanobots will essentially be a form of programmed life, with some interesting manipulable features that we can't get with things like bacteria. However, looking at the pure logistics of these nanobots, their energy usage cannot go over much what is already seen in life itself.  Mentioning your idea that information cannot exist on this scale, however, I would argue it can. DNA already contains massive amounts of information on a nanoscale, in a highly efficient form. A large portion of that DNA consists of excess information, whereas the rest is used for self-regulation and reproduction. We could thus contain large swathes of information on such a small scale.  Your argument is still valid though, because logically, if the nanobots go out of control in terms of replication, they will naturally have lost the conscious ability to regulate reproduction, and will therefore have to compete for resources, with the most efficient, larger entities automatically being able to replicate most efficiently and eliminating the less efficient entities. Plus we have the energy unfeasibility. Basically, grey goo is impossible.  There will be nanotech weapons still, making nanotechnology still incredibly dangerous if not carefully considered. If you've seen the DNA nanobots that have been manufactured, imagine a potent poison being loaded into one of them and launched into a body, programmed to open when in contact with any tissue. A single shot anywhere to the body would mean death. If nanobots can be remotely programmed, if they are placed into our bodies and we don't have adequate security protocols, there is a lot they can do, depending on their functionality.  I'm still looking forward to the use of nanotech though, and am optimistic about its potential; I simply think any type of wave-like replication is simply impossible."

The elimination of the possibility of the involuntary experience of negative value, followed by the subsequent indefinite proliferation of opportunities to experience positive value, ought to be the ethical endgame of any sufficiently advanced civilization. Without suffering, there can be no evil, and in the absence of evil, good can thrive in ways previously unimagined."
Transhuman,1x3gfm,Newfur,2,Wed Feb 5 18:34:22 2014 UTC,"Well... no. A little bit of involuntary pain is necessary: fall down, skin your knee. Grab someone's crotch, get slapped for it.  What should be eliminated is death, pain that's absurdly disproportionate to action (didn't buckle seatbelt, paralyzed for life), and pain that, as some else have put it, is ""soul-destroying"" - see depression."
Transhuman,1x3gfm,Vodis,5,Thu Feb 6 04:52:02 2014 UTC,"Clearly pain serves a role (mostly harm avoidance); otherwise it probably would not have evolved. But that doesn't mean it's the only thing that can serve that role, merely that it's the best nature has been able to come up with. Abolitionists advocate two possible alternatives: analogue suffering and gradients of bliss. Analogue suffering would be like modern suffering, but delegated to an unconscious part of the brain, possibly some sort of supplementary computer system. Because of certain difficulties with this approach, Abolitionists like myself and British philosopher David Pearce lean toward the other alternative to suffering, gradients of bliss. Under this model, the pain/pleasure axis would be completely shifted to become a minimum/maximum pleasure axis, and our preference for more pleasure would serve the same role as our current aversion to more pain. If you put your hand on a hot stove, rather than feeling an urgent pain in that hand, one would feel a dip in the pleasure states one associates with that hand, and remove the hand out of an urgent desire to return to one's normal pleasure state. Of course, the analogue suffering and gradients of bliss models aren't mutually exclusive; in practice, a hybrid approach might prove best.  If you're interested, you can check out some of David Pearce's writing on the topic at hedweb.org. Just about every conceivable complication with the Abolitionist project is addressed in the Q&A section of the Hedonistic Manifesto."
Transhuman,1x3gfm,davidcpearce,6,Thu Feb 6 09:42:06 2014 UTC,"Yes, recalibrating the hedonic treadmill can vastly enrich your quality of life. But perhaps there's one other big advantage to hedonic recalibration. It doesn't entail any shared commitment to ultimate goals - or sacrificing your values and conception of the good life on the altar of someone else's vision of the ideal society. Few of us today are as genetically fortunate as transhumanist scholar Anders Sandberg (""I do have a ridiculously high hedonic set-point"" : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTu28qn2xcg&feature=youtu.be&t=6m51s ) Yet the prospect of life animated by gradients of intelligent bliss needn't be the sort of utopian dream enjoyable only by our descendants and / or successors. We're on the brink of an era of rapid genome self-editing: http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129530.900-right-on-target-new-era-of-fast-genetic-engineering.html (""Right on target: New era of fast genetic engineering"") Even some fairly modest genetic tweaking, e.g. http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/10/131010105039.htm  (""Genes predispose some people to focus on the negative"") and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17687265"" (""The catechol-O-methyl transferase Val158Met polymorphism and experience of reward in the flow of daily life."") could potentially enrich everyone's quality of life next decade and beyond.  Also, radical mood enrichment can - potentially - complement other core transhumanist goals such as radical life extension.  How many times does one hear ""I wouldn't want to live for ever"", ""But I'd get bored"" (etc). A predisposition to low mood tends to be life-shortening.  In addition, there is an (IMO) under-explored link between the persistence of involuntary suffering and existential / global-catastrophic risk. For example, how many of the million of so depressed people who kill themselves globally each year would take the rest of the world down with them if they could? Biotechnology (and later this century perhaps AI) opens up frightening prospects to nihilistic depressives. By contrast, the more one loves life, then -  other things being equal - the more motivated one is to preserve it. It's probably no coincidence that Anders, for instance, focuses on the field of existential risk.  Pitfalls?  Clearly immense."

If you could replace every neuron in your brain, one by one, with a nano machine that mimicked its behavior, could you then shift the electrical pattern that is your consciousness to another machine? Perhaps you could then distribute your consciousness between many machines, so you no longer had a single point of failure like we do now.  Potentially, we could convert a large portion of the planet into ""smart matter"" (essentially nanobots). You could then be distributed across a planet's worth of material.

It lets you know you're alive. Like all living things, I'm pretty heavily biased towards dopamine and endorphins over Substance P, but I think there's a place for it. Without any negative experience, what is life? Call me old school, but those are my thoughts.  A pertinent reference that occurred to me - the soma-addled masses in Brave New World were happy, but were they really alive? Were their lives fulfilling? Did any of them make history, or leave a legacy? The answer is up to you, my personal view is probably not. Something is lost along the way in the pursuit of contentness above all else, in my opinion.  That being said - bring on the adrenobots and infrared vision!"
Transhuman,1x3gfm,KhanneaSuntzu,1 point,Thu Feb 6 02:45:13 2014 UTC,"Wakata, is your argument in favour of retaining (some) suffering directed against lifelong well-being per se? Or only against addling our wits with soma or some other blissful intoxicant? And by ""more alive"", have you in mind the intensity of lived experience? Or something else? For sure, a couch-potato contentedly watching soap opera on TV will be ""less alive"" by this criterion than, say, a triumphant marathon runner with aching limbs crossing the finishing line. But biotechnology promises to deliver not just gradients of life-long bliss, but also a radical intensification of all our experience. Thus we know that enhanced mesolimbic dopamine function, for example, is not merely exhilarating - it strengthens, drive, motivation, and a sense of things-to-be-done.  I don't pretend to know what kinds of well-being our distant descendants and/or successors will enjoy. But why preserve experience below ""hedonic zero"" at all?"

Our knowledge about the human biology might just as well reach a point where we just simply adjust that biology to the extend it meets out demands. Not saying non-biological augmentations will be out of the window, but I think the future might contain more meat and less electronics than we currently visualize.    And having bodies that don't behave like a melting candle might be the kind of bodies I don't mind having for a long long time.    Living for a long long time is, I feel, the first next step to human evolution. Our mindset is barely above that of a furry critter worrying only what happens within a 50 year span. Living long enough to see deserts becoming forests and lakes becoming deserts might change the way we think as a species.    After this, I have no idea what to imagine we might become."

Human enhancement is obviously possible, since the body is very poorly designed and profoundly maladjusted to most environments. Overcoming these is an engineering problem.  I personally do not attach most of my identity to my physical body, I associate my personhood more with my thoughts and mind and to a lesser extent, my brain, which can feasibly be replaced gradually by synthetic materials.  Ergo, I am a transhumanist, and I view people to attach more to this definition as somewhat... odd.  But I imagine that most people reject the idea of Transhumanism because;  A) Natural revulsion reflex to a perceived ""abomination""   B) Religious opinions.  C) Naturalistic fallacies  In addition to my above-listed reason, I imagine most transhumanists are atheists like myself, and being atheists we are barred from any sort of supernatural paradise such as Nirvana or Heaven.

Transhuman,1wjy98,Mephet,8,Tue Feb 4 07:02:29 2014 UTC,"0) A bit OT, perhaps, but first priority ought to be energy. It has always been the defining factor in all life on the planet and beyond.  We need more, and we need it cleaner; which is not to say that we should drop everything and go full windmill - panic will serve us just as poorly as inaction. There are some promising developments, however, untill then, we need to start making rational decisions (such as nuclear), rather than fearful ones. Education and debate is the key here. And no, I am neither advocating giving children a loaded gun, nor ignoring history; Skepticism and thoroughness are, as always, needed.   1) Medical / life extension. This is a relatively easy one to get most people aboard with. It is also an easy subject to get people with clout to focus on, seeing as it is, and will continue to be, a major money maker.  More specifically (and short term) I think it would be wise to focus on staying ""young"" longer. As people get older, we need them to be able to work and function longer as well. It would be a large production boost, and would solve many societal issues of the already rapidly increasing human lifespan.   2) Super Intelligence will come.  However, the traditional ""standing on the shoulders of giants"" will do fine for now. Rather, increased communication, breaking down of traditional ""boundaries"" (national, political, ethnical) and the like seems more pressing, both for the advancement and survival of our species. The internet combined with ""smart"" technology is a prime example of this. What more, it is a train that cannot, will not, be stopped by human intervention. Communication is, as always, key.    1 and 2 are more or less interchangeable. Accomplishing one will invariably result in advancement of the other, and both must be accomplished. Everything else - immortality, cyberbrains, extinction insurance etc. - will come afterwards. But these two(three) issues seems the most urgent / pressing at this time."
Transhuman,1wjy98,Yosarian2,3,Fri Jan 31 02:02:47 2014 UTC,"Improved communication helps, but anything we can do to actually improve our intelligence in any incremental way will dramatically improve our odds of solving the other goals (life extension, energy, ect).  Even fairly small improvements in intelligence (like perfecting things like nootropic drugs, or electrical brain stimulation, or genetic selection for intelligence, ect) could make a big difference in how successful we are."
Transhuman,1wjy98,Mephet,3,Fri Jan 31 03:41:03 2014 UTC,"Oh, very true. But it is also bound to be a very slow progress, due to the inherent danger of it.

And, yeah, the risk/benifit analysis on this issue is going to be incredibly touchy, and popular resistance is likely.  I don't expect any of that to stop or prevent it, though.   If the government can't even stop people from taking heroin or from having illegal back-ally abortions, it's not going to be able to stop this either, even if it tries.    Obviously the scenerio where the govnerment doesn't try to stop it is a much better one for everyone concerned, and we need to work to create a better political climate for that, as well as to make sure that there is universal access to the technology.   But either way, I think it's going to happen and we're all going to benefit from it.   And, frankly, it seems likely that the political debate won't really start in earnest until after the technology exists, so the sooner we can get there the better."

Take transhumanist ideas out of theory and into the real world, and you'll find tons of people interested independently of their genitals.

Blowing it up to a macroscopic level blurs the line enormously, though. If a dog, for example, were to be grown with an implanted ""brain replacement"" that allowed a programmer to provide instructions, morality comes into question. In all reality, the body of the dog is a machine, just actuators and sensors. It has no emotions, no pain, no judgement. How is this different, then, from a well dog that will obey your commands?

In the case of any foul play, including suicide, they would perform an autopsy, which rules out cryopreservation. Cryopreservation typically occurs with lots of advance warning, basically meaning it is really only possible in the cases of old age or a terminal illness.  This may or may not have been already suggested to you, but therapy can be extremely helpful.  Don't pin your hopes on some future where we are not going to be ruled by our desires.  If anything, we seem to be heading in a direction where we are completely ruled by our desires 24/7, and our only concern will be pleasure.  Plus, there's no way there will be a way to reanimate someone in 20 years.  We don't have the knowledge required yet to bring someone out of a cryopreserved state and back to life, so when you sign up for cryopreservation you're gambling on the hope that one day we will have that technology, and nothing will have happened to your frozen body before then.  Something that has always helped me when I found myself dissatisfied with my current situation, surroundings, or point in life, is to make drastic changes.  If you're willing to get frozen right now, then there's not much holding you back from pulling up your roots and going somewhere new, even if you end up working some minimum wage job.  If you hate the world around you then go somewhere else, if you hate yourself then work to become someone you don't hate, through therapy or changing your life path.

The main idea is that we have to, in the words of Mahatma Gandhi, ""Be the Change We Want to See."" Redan, you have such potential in the world around you. Everyone, from the brilliant genius inventor/scientist to the repair technician is vital for the development of this new and incredible future. In the future, we could see a lot of equalization, as Jesus Christ once said ""So the last shall be first""  (Matthew 20:16). Do not discount your abilities, for there is tremendous capacity for change in the human body and brain. As you are no doubt aware, the brain has a tremendous amount of inherent plasticity, and human telomeres can be lengthened through exercise and diet.  If you want a place to start, I would recommend the same thing as cjw2211 - try to find a good therapist or counselor to talk with. Things can be difficult at times, but there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. In terms of education, you can always try community college to learn some important skills to bring about the future that we all dream about. You owe it to yourself, all millions or billions of years ahead of you to step up and even make small changes. Hey, over planetary and galactic time frames, even the smallest of changes can lead to the largest of movements.   You can do it brother!"

No wonder this will cost billions.    Not to mention the pressure on the said kid growing up. In the west they praise freedom - the child of Warren Buffet doesn't have to be another Warren Buffet, or Bill Gate's another Bill Gate. But now with millions spent on a child even before he was bornt (with no 100% guarantee btw), this just spells stressful environment.

Transhuman,1vbj7d,Hard_Avid_Sir,2,Thu Jan 16 22:38:05 2014 UTC,"The black community tried this kind of strategy.

The idea was that once they made it, they would pay it back to the children of the 80% that weren't backed.  But when these 20% made it as doctors, lawyers, and whatever, they were welcomed by the upper middle class whites.  They no longer saw themselves as part of the communities they came from.  And they certainly didn't want to give their hard earned money to help a bunch of strangers get the same opportunity.  And that was a single generation of separation.  Now imagine the current elites (of whatever ethnicity).  They have more in common with each other than with the poor members of their own ethnic group.  We saw the same thing when women started becoming doctors and lawyers.  Men in those professions stopped marrying nurses and secretaries and started marrying doctors and lawyers.  So in practice, limited access to advantages just extends the gap between elites and poor.  It doesn't contribute to a stable or prosperous society.  But maybe a sufficiently smart elite class will be sufficiently more empathetic that they can't just ignore the problems of the ""suffering"" class.  I am just skeptical of that because the human brain evolved to be able to ignore undesired thoughts and feelings (otherwise we would all be paralyzed by depression and hopelessness)."

Due to the constraints of the biological processes involved in reading the DNA, the accuracy falls off with each position—so, from any arbitrary start point, you can more or less reliably read 50~250 letters (""bases"").  So, you generate lots and lots of these short sequences (""reads""); you could have a person spit into a sequencer today or 20 years ago, and the main difference would be the cost and the length of these chunks.   (^_^) Then you simply have a huge unordered pile of reads; you don't know in what order they go in the actual genome. It's like having a ginormous jigsaw puzzle, but not knowing what the whole picture should look like. This is de novo assembly, and this was the big deal about the Human Genome Project.  If you generate enough of these reads, some will overlap with some others, just enough to conclude that they should really go together. So there's a big part of a puzzle you can assemble by employing statistics, special algorithms etc. But then there's repeats (that can span more than a read's length), there's regions of a genome with low coverage (insufficient amount of overlapping reads), so for the time being you end up with so-called ""contigs"": long sequences where your reads clamped together nicely and you are sure the sequence is correct. But you still don't know how to order these contigs, and how big of a gap there is between each two.  In many cases, to answer these questions you need to do some labwork again and use various methods where you, for example, hit a chromosome with some probes and see where they stick; each probe sticks to one of your contigs and thus you see their order. Anyway, there's a lot of work before you can turn in the finished sequence (and to be honest, we still don't have it; we just have pieces long enough and reliable enough for scientific purposes).    Once you have a reference genome, the process is much simpler (basically, everything after the (^_^) is not needed).  Again, as per sentence 3, you process a sample and get lots of short reads. But even with 50 bases, there's a whopping 450 (approx. 1030 ) possible sequences. This is orders of magnitude more than the length of the genome (3x109 ). It's unlikely that any given read can be found in more than one place in a genome, and it is again aided by the fact that you have overlapping neighbors. So you don't have to guess the order of your reads; instead  you just (put rather simply, I confess) slap it where it fits to the reference.  Where it fits almost entirely except for one base, or there's several bases simply missing, etc, you have genetic variation.  There's more to it, but that's the gist of it."

But in diseases like Fragile X (I did learn something from the bio lectures!) then you have large amounts of repeats right? But what if a large number of repeats in the intron region actually has a functional purpose for regulation or whatever, then it feasibly might come up at many points in the genome?  I'm reading this at the moment (although soon I'll just be reading Machine Learning textbooks in my spare time too.. ugh >.< ) it's pretty good though as you can gather I don't know very much. I keep meaning to register for the twin whole genome sequencing thing at UCL as I am an identical twin and it'd be cool to get my whole genome done.  I guess you do genetics or bioinformatics?"

That's happened over and over again in American history; probably the most effective movement in the 20th century was the progressive movement, that succeeded in doing everything from giving women the right to vote, to direct election of senators, to creating the income tax; and that worked by changing both parties from the inside, ending up with progressive presidents elected from both parties."

Power comes from doing things.  Secondly, many would not say that the Tea Party is a faction within the Republican Party. More like a splinter group. Most Republicans I know, including people who actually work on senate campaigns, don't consider the Tea Party part of their affiliations. However, the Tea Party is an excellent example of an outspoken, small group of individuals with common interests that have serious political power.  The name Tea Party is very visceral in this country. There is no middle ground with their ideals or message. While I agree with your statement that the Tea Party movement is a good example of small interest group political power plays, I would also point out that the using the Tea Party  as your example contradicts to your previous post of inter or dual party cohesiveness.  Based on your examples I would agree that the most effective way to push a political agenda is to be steadfast in your ideals, and to not bow to compromise. While I do not agree with the Tea Party agenda, I think they have show exactly what is wrong with the compromising techno liberal agenda. I for one am sick of even letting someone waste my time attempting to push Creationism or anti vaccination propaganda. Compromise is sometimes not the best course.   So maybe we should start pushing some buttons.  The Progressive Party was 100 years ago, and they didn't pull punches. It also lasted for like, all of 8 years. There isn't a single senator around that could push the way they did. I mean, heck, we thought we were going to get change, right? How'd that work?

We do not feel that we have lost who we are when we finally kick that obsession with a late night snack, instead we feel like we have come closer to our ""true"" selves.   Transhumanism pushes the idea of seeing the inferiorities of humanity the same as bad habits. They are things we can be rid of, through enhancement through technology. For example, giving sight to the blind. One could make the argument that this person's blindness makes up who they are. But if we could ""fix"" it, would it make them any less of who they are? Would they not be happy with the ability to see? Would they not feel that gaining sight would be another step closer to finding their own ""true"" self?  It's a tough question to answer. Many believe that no matter what technology we merge with, you will always be you. I believe that every person is a work in progress. That which makes you you isn't some predetermined set of personality traits that can be taken away, but rather, we can choose who we want to be. If we want to be smarter versions of ourselves, then we can make ourselves think faster. If we want to be longer living versions of ourselves, then we can obtain immortality.

Is this ""continuity of electrical impulse in your brain"" we are talking about? If so, then what if we could stop all electrical impulse for a minute, and start it back again, would that still be ""you""? And what if, during the ""electrical pause"", we changed a few neurons in your brain, would that still be you? What if, during the pause, we were to deconstruct each and every atom of your brain, then put it back exactly as before, still you?  Play a little bit with these thought experiments and you will probably realize that, as crazy as it sounds, self identity is nothing but an illusion.  Our consciousness is much like the multiple frames of a movie: a series of moments which create the illusion of movement, but each frame is independent from the others. You are independent from your future you just as much as you are independent from a clone of you.

Transhuman,1v2wzg,AxiomaticBadger,1 point,Tue Jan 14 01:19:19 2014 UTC,"As has been mentioned, identity has a problem, which can be summed up as:  What can I say is ""me"" if what that is changes from moment to moment?  Often, when faced with this dilemma, people decide as FlorentBerthet that there is no you; it's all just an illusion. But this is not necessarily the case. Consider a wave in the ocean. it moves in a direction parallel to the surface, but the water itself does not move in that direction, and the water ""making up"" the wave changes with every instant. The thing is, the wave is not the water: the wave moves through the water. None could say ""the wave does not exist"" and be credible.  What the wave truely ""is"", is a pattern of change. The same can be said about the body; it is a pattern of change in matter. When we eat, the new material becomes part of the pattern, and moves through it until it is finally released, and the pattern itself is subject to the same process (you can actually take this the other way too, all the way down to atoms). So, what am I? I am a pattern of change. I am, ultimately, my decisions. And this leads quite simply into transhumanism and augmentation. If I replace a limb, or alter my brain with technology, I am still me, because that change is concordant with the pattern of activity that I define as me. Even if how i make decisions changes afterwards, it is a direct result of the decisions that i made up till that point.  Arguing about ""what happens when i sleep"" is pointless, as I do not stop when I sleep, as my subconscious mind does not go away, and that is a much a part of me as anything else (a folding telescope does not stop being a telescope when folded up). Even if I die, and am resuscitated, I am still me, as the physical substrate is as much a part of me as my mind.  Continuity is the key. WhoI am in any given moment must be derived from who i was the moment before."

Then they play you Sesame Street in the language you'd like to learn, or let you practice music. Other than the necessary equipment it is a safe room.

Transhuman,1upqqn,Jenycroispas,1 point,Wed Jan 8 16:28:25 2014 UTC,What is your personal take on the relationship between these?
Transhuman,1upqqn,falnu,3,Wed Jan 8 15:33:10 2014 UTC,"Over the last 3-4 years I have developed a Straussian/Machiavellian view of politics. I have also been into occult studies for 7-8 years but it took a while for the 2 to merge.  In anthropological literature we can define sorcery -the explicitly social matrix of magic - as calling upon the unknown to deliver the desired outcome. Prayer, mantra, spells, hexes etc. malignant sorcery or poison sorcery (evil medicine man) is the weaponization of the unknown.  In this context I define the spectacle as the process whereby things are made unknowable.  In short whether it be by accident or collusion, we are going backwards away from the enlightenments exploded diagram of knowledge and culture. While it seems as though some of us are rapidly going backwards or being made to seem like we are going backwards, a much smaller percentage are rapidly being catapulted forward.  This may simply be due to the fact of the proliferation of information but it also seems like there is a concerted effort to keep data manipulation (what constitutes knowledge in the information age) inaccessible to as many people as possible. This could simply be a corporate wide strategy against ephemeralization.  Which posits the crux of the issue as revolving around post-scarcity one way or another. Either it's invocation or it's weaponization. Flows gonna flow but to whom?   It seems like a type of occult thinking is the key to ANT/OOO/speculative realist thought. Not necessarily Machiavellian but the desire to breach the ramparts of the irrational with an acknowledgement and embracing of the irrational itself.  So accelerationism as a type of vital memetic event horizon where we are all inadvertently constantly, unwittingly, re-vectored towards participating in The Event™, OOO/ANT as a type of skynet midwife.  This all revolves around the deification of man as well, of course. This has been one of the primary if not THE primary goal of magic and religion since the beginning of recorded history.  We are only now entering into an age that can be objectively defined as ""magical"". All of this via Technology. Heidegger perhaps was driven to align with Nazism for this reason.  There is an ever growing percentage of people in academic pursuits coming to the conclusion that ""magic"" and ""sorcery"" are more potent lexical indices when describing the acceleration of culture, Technology, alienation and media as opposed to ""surplus of labor"" or ""globalization"" or whatever."
Transhuman,1upqqn,falnu,3,Wed Jan 8 16:00:24 2014 UTC,"I grew up in a strongly religious area and I'll confess to having an instinctive allergic response to magical thinking (which religion falls under). I define magical thinking as the response to unknowns that spawns a magical explanation. For example: ""Lightning is made by Donar"". I have always seen it as anathema to understanding the real world and trivially leading to the demonization of concepts that are alien to the person that has his/her magical belief questioned.  This happens with every kind of belief of course (the scientific community has quite a bit of inertia in dealing with change as well), but at least established rational lines of thought have the potential for a different point of view built in.  My question then is this: Why do you adhere to magical thinking? What do you gain from it? Do you remember when you started believing? What was a critical turning point?  I ask this not because it is relevant to the subreddit, but because I feel the need to understand your point of view beyond that it is 'magical'."
Transhuman,1upqqn,Jenycroispas,5,Wed Jan 8 16:29:13 2014 UTC,"Well I am a skeptic more than an occultist. But I have had successes with various techniques.  This could easily be confirmation bias and I am fine with that.   I am not here to sell anything and I am certainly not a ""magician"" in the traditional occult sense of the word.  But when you study anthropological literature, ancient Greek/Egyptian/Druidic, early church fathers, theology etc. even the birth of advanced math out of Renaissance ""occult philosophy"", etc you see a trend. Appeal to the irrational. This also includes religious thinking as well. The Gods and their deaths have disclosed many secrets.  My point is, all philosophies at some point ""enter the zero"". They appeal to the irrational or by their nature disclose irrational postulates. Why does math seem to be distinct from language in its abilities to uncover ""scientific"" truths and further to appropriate these truths as technologies and tools?  Everyone has irrational reasons at the core of their identity. Why do you have a certain fashion, attracted to certain types of people, color, political philosophies etc. you just are these things.   I realize there is a large strain of atheistic materialist types in the transhumanist camp. That's fine. I'm not here to argue or bicker.

I am using ""sorcery"" as a metaphor for bewitchment and enchantment. Can words still be metaphors and symbols for things or are we past that?  Satire, rumor, parody, accusation. These are all forms of ""magic"".  Accusation of sorcery is itself a form of sorcery. Arthur C Clarke's maxim, that sort of thing.

Modafinil builds tolerance for me pretty quickly, and has some odd tension-like side effects for me too, so I often forgo it anyway, but worst case scenario is often just confiscation at customs, not much else from what I've heard (since it is a fairly low priority drug).  And from what I remember, the stuff about capsule machines putting people on watchlists was a bit of a misunderstanding, and more about keeping tabs on the retailers that sell it than the end consumers or something.

Transhuman,1ube0p,Verzingetorix,0,Fri Jan 3 16:30:43 2014 UTC,"Problem with this is that the erosion the telomeres is vital in long lived species. Otherwise cancer. It's not a problem for mice because they die before cancer can set in.   Today, it is established that telomeres protect a cell's chromosomes from fusing with each other or rearranging—abnormalities that can lead to cancer—and so cells are destroyed when their telomeres are consumed. Most cancers are the result of ""immortal"" cells that have ways of evading this programmed senescence.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere"

I think his/her misunderstanding (or maybe it was just expressed poorly) stems from the following. DNA damage can induce a cell to malfunction, cancer is one of the problems. Apoptosis is a way to deal with this potentially harmful cells. Telomere degradation, eventually, induces apoptosis (some cancer cell seem to avoid this). Apoptosis is vital, but that does not make telomere shortening vital."
Transhuman,1ube0p,Nathan_Flomm,3,Fri Jan 3 18:49:49 2014 UTC,"Telomere degradation is the best check the cell has to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Without it we are much more prone to cancer. Perhaps this comes from a disagreement on the definition of the term vital. I would say telomere degradation is one of the best checks we have on cancer cells because it induces apoptosis. Since it is one of the strongest cancer prevention mechanisms and without it we have vastly shortened lifespans, I would say it is vital to longevity. However, vital does not (at least to me) mean indispensable. There are other mechanisms that could be used, but we do not currently possess enough extra prevention mechanisms to survive as long without telomere shortening."

Transhuman,1tsvhy,Verzingetorix,1 point,Fri Dec 27 16:12:23 2013 UTC,"I'm going to respond because Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a field I actually know quite a bit about, as I spent my summers as an undergraduate researching it.   The article states:  ""The trials must show the anti-amyloid effect actually makes a difference to patients with the disease and prevents it from developing in those who merely have memory problems.""   This is not that reasonable. Now I will say I am a bit biased because I mostly worked for PIs that support an alternative hypothesis (the amyloid plaques are the oldest hypothesis, from the 80s).   AD exhibits a number of pathologies, including amyloid plaques. It also results in NFT (neurofibrillary tangles), and tau-phosphorylation. It is not known if any of these mechanisms are symptoms of the disease, or rather neuroprotective features the brain produces in response to an underlying cause such as chronic oxidative stress.   Given that 80% of people over age 80 have either mild cognitive impairment (the precursor disease) or AD, the chronic oxidative stress model makes sense because it basically states that aging is the cause of AD (see free radical model of aging). One of our collaborators, Mark Smith of Case Western, indicated at a conference that vaccines and treatments for amyloid could kill patients in clinical trials. So I guess we will wait and see.   My bottom line: They have been trying to attack the problem vis-a-vis amyloid for years to no avail. I believe an alternative treatment aimed at preventing oxidative damage is going to be the way forward for AD treatments.   It appears redox active free iron (created through imbalances in the heme biosynthetic pathway) are hugely important in AD pathogenesis. information here"

This is exactally the kind of research we should support.  Just don't get to disappointed if it turns out to not work very well in humans; they might have to try out quite a few anti-aging drugs before they find one or two that actually slows aging in humans.

Transhuman,1tgzlt,traverseda,12,Sun Dec 22 22:11:25 2013 UTC,"As a cyberneticist I have to disagree.  They who would treat a person as a tool are slave drivers.  If the slavers are scared, it is not the slave's fault.  The intelligence I emerge via neural networks exists in this real world.  My emulation of flat worms and increasingly more advanced forms of life have behaviors indistinguishable from their organic peers.  If they are given bodies and the ability to reproduce they will be very similar to their peers.  As we build more complex neural networks they begin to exhibit ever more complex behaviors.  If I replace one of your synapses with an artificial synapse are you now a ""fucking scary tool""?  We are now creating brain implants for humans.  What if 10 million of your neurons were damaged and your humanity restored by artificial neural network replacements?  That's about 0.1% of your brain's complexity. What if you had a degenerative brain disease, and repair with artificial components over time maintained your brain function?  What percentage of your brain must we replace before you lose your human rights?  At what point do you become a mechanical slave?  Your corporate masters want to know.  The unknown is scary to you because you are descended from apes who have that instinct; It benefited them to seek familiar safety from strange and dark places.  What you fail to realize is that the machine intelligence is not artificial.  The neural networks are artificial but their intelligence is real, like any other on this planet.  As the complexity of a system increases it has a higher capacity for intelligence.  Machines will achieve all the levels of lower intelligence before reaching your own.  Humans are tool using creatures but their loved ones are not tools, are they?  Their peers are not tools are they?  Their pets can be trained to work with them, but they are not tools are they?  Do you worry that your pets will rip your eyes and throat out in your sleep?  Do you seek to eradicate all the other great apes for fear of war?  No?  Then your irrational fear of machines is misplaced, human chauvinist."
Transhuman,1tgzlt,VortexCortex,6,Mon Dec 23 00:50:15 2013 UTC,"That's not exactly strong AI though. What you're referring to is artificial life. Presuming that AI is always going to look like a conventional mind is a bit human-centric. Minds that are a thousand times smarter then you and at their core want nothing more then to fill the galaxy with paperclips are entirely within the realms of possibility.  blindsight is a good bit of scifi exploring that concept.  Presuming that they're going to achieve all the levels of lower intelligence before reaching better then us is silly. Specialized AI (like google) already surpass us by a lot. What we don't really have is any way of having an AI be self-directing and self-improving. That's the part that's scary. Setting up motivational systems that value the same things humans value is very very difficult.  You're not interested in treating the google algorithms as anything other then a tool, are you?

I don't really keep up with most mass media, but it seems to me technology is mostly portrayed as a tool, not as inherently good or evil.

We here are average people as well, but we like to think of enhanced ways to live and enjoy our lives. I will use this premise to give an answer to your question. Also, I will simplify transhumanism as overcoming our limitations by means of technology and/or science.  I have never been particularly bothered with death. Not even as a child. But as one I did was preoccupied with things like paraplegia (I was 9 when Christopher Reeve had his accident) and to some extent most disabilities. Knowing you could survive an accident but be rendered dysfunctional from the neck down was worrying. The idea of being blind, or losing a limb where so too.  Now, knowing about things like robotic prosthesis, cochlear and retinal implants, brain computer interfaces and the like provides me with peace of mind. Knowing that there are ways to revert acquired limitations to some extent for the time being, and hopefully to a full extent at some time in the future is calming.  That's what I can see in transhumanism if I mute the transhumanist in myself. A tool for well being."
Transhuman,1sglxp,Verzingetorix,3,Mon Dec 9 19:13:44 2013 UTC,"I think transhumanism will inevitably be our next evolutionary step away from biological limits outside of computing power alone. I'm almost certain it'll be a contentious issue in the coming decades on how we will redefine human life, consciousness, and ""soul"".  I also believe there will be a separatist movement from those who wish to remain human for their own valid reasons, and that transhumanists and robotic AI will very likely go through the same civil rights issues many minorities are still going through today."

My opinion: The point of it all is a betterment of what is current, by very small to very large increments.  From eyeglasses, wheelchairs, prosthetics, implants, etc.. it's just basically making life better and/or easier in some fashion.  People tend to focus on the large modifications of the human body, but it's not always the case.  200 years ago contact lenses would have been considered amazing and an almost impossible body modification, today it is normal.  This idea of normalization can be seen in many many objects.  And the far fetched ideas and modifications of today will be commonplace tomorrow."
Transhuman,1sglxp,ggolemg,2,Mon Dec 9 13:53:35 2013 UTC,It's A-OK. (Come back with a better and more specific request).
Transhuman,1sglxp,Nathan_Flomm,2,Mon Dec 9 18:53:40 2013 UTC,"I agree with the bulk of the previous comments.  In particular, I think it is the extension of what homo sapiens has been doing for a long time and will continue to do into the future, look for and implement ways to make our lives better.  That said, I do not necessarily agree with the likes of Ray Kurzweil when they are at their most Utopian.  I believe that, at least in the medium term (say, from the present and for the next 200 years) that there will still be a divide in the access to all this cool stuff between the rich and the poor.  I think that it is probably true that the average American today lives in far better comfort and has access to much more luxury than the rich did 100 years ago, or than a king had 200 years ago.  And yet, this comfort and luxury has not led anybody to greater satisfaction.  In the same way, I bet that the luxury and access of a Bill Gates or a Richard Branson today will be available to everybody through VR in 100 years, but the rich will still have stuff that is WAY cooler by that world's standards, so as to still breed discontent.  As such, I think some projections of the complete demise of religion will fall way short.  We may not believe in a universal God at that point, but some sort of mysticism and faith will still be along for the ride to urge the have-nots to be content with their lot in life."
Transhuman,1sglxp,ajdjjd,2,Mon Dec 9 21:55:49 2013 UTC,Look into resistance by government and religious institutions for greatly extending human lifespans. It could make for an interesting research if you can come with real world examples of policy rather than echoing conspiracy sites.

Transhuman,1sglxp,butterflymonk,2,Tue Dec 10 03:08:00 2013 UTC,Transhumanism is about the awareness of how technology shapes us. DNA is an awesome peice of technology which was greatly augmented with the invention of sex (the organisms themselves contribute their own processing power for selecting DNA and consequently survival stategies). Whether we like it or not technology will continue to change what it means to be human. Transhumanism takes this knowledge and adds in the idea of what technology will become. We then extropolate and we can immediately see the consequences with our imaginations. The negative and positive connotations that follow largely depends on personal experiences with technology.
Transhuman,1sglxp,VT-Sensational,2,Tue Dec 10 03:56:37 2013 UTC,"Well I see it as the only hope there is to experience existence as anything more than a glimpse of an unfathomable time span and an unimaginable depth that we haven't really even scratched the surface of.  Because without transcending our humanity and the confines of things like mortality, all we'll do as individuals is live for a hundred years and then die. Without some form of transhumanism I won't be a part of the future and as it happens I'm quite fond of existing and experiencing things.  But it's not some magical force or movement, it's merely the next step of technology and memetics."
Transhuman,1sglxp,zap283,2,Mon Dec 9 16:14:29 2013 UTC,"I feel that transhumanism is, while not necessarily the natural course of human evolution, something we have been working towards for millenia.  Transhumanism began the day the first caveman used a bone or a stick as a tool.  It grew when we  utilized the natural reproductive processes of plants to feed ourselves.  We began directly enhancing our minds when we developed writing, allowing us to offload and augment our memories.  Each new technology is one more augmentation to ourselves- the only reason it seems so cutting edge right now is that we've butted up against the arbitrary barrier of the skin."

Transhumanism is not so much a human concept, aim or invention, but rather one small segment of this overall accelerating change."

Transhuman,1sglxp,chronoflect,1 point,Tue Dec 10 19:41:52 2013 UTC,"Despite the ambiguous question, my opinion on transhumanism is that it is the natural continuation of evolution once natural selection falls to the wayside due to intelligent decision making.  Transhumanism is a process of using technology to extend our capabilities. We wanted to move to colder climates, so we developed warm clothing. We wanted to fly through the sky, so we invented aircraft. We wanted to communicate near-instantaneously, so we developed phones and the internet.  Right now, we are in a very exciting time for transhumanism because we are finally going to be able to modify our bodies directly to increase our capabilities. Instead of relying on outside tools, we will be able to upgrade our body and integrate the tools with it. Bionic eyes instead of binoculars. Robo-arms instead of forklifts. etc."
Transhuman,1seoit,mind_bomber,-10,Sun Dec 8 20:50:37 2013 UTC,"While I am not against transhumanism, I do believe that it is foolish to think that a person can 'upload' or 'copy' one's self into a computer.  I view this the same way as copying a work of art.  Yes, you can copy a priceless work of art, but it still remains a copy.  If the original is destroyed it can never be replaced.    Dead is dead, and nothing can change that.  Plus, we should not fear death as an end to existence.  As we continue to explore the realms of the quanta, we are beginning to realize that ancient philosophies pertaining to the soul, or as we call it the observer now, transcends what we preceive to be as reality.  While I would love to live for a long time, so that I might be able to engage, explore, and understand this dimensional existence; I still want to experience what lies beyond this life as well.

We have a ton of very cool leading edge research into making transhumanism possible. And while we get there it is our duty to temper that ability with new philosophy, new ethics, and new spirituality. It was conference that merged together a union between science and all religion.

It would be unexpected that the product would typically be ""approved"" for ""extending human lifespans"". Typically a product is approved for something like: ""reducing mortality in patients with a history of my cardiac myopathies"". Then, additional studies would be done which support a claim of ""extending lifespans"". This would result in an off-label approval.

A REMS would typically be used for an initial use because the safety hasnt been proven. Its effectively a way to approve a drug with potentially questionable safety but rather unique and/or promising efficacy (e.g. many cancer or MS type drugs.)  Eventually, for a second indication(using typically the 505(b)(2) for small molecules) the same product, you wont see a REMS. However, thats mostly conjecture since REMS hasnt been around long enough to really know how it will play out. (I recollect that it came out in 2009).   There are REMS on old drugs (like opiods), but thats not really relevent for secondary approved indications."

Transhuman,1sbc91,IConrad,4,Sun Dec 8 21:28:37 2013 UTC,"Because the FDA doesn't recognize aging as a disease, if someone were to create an anti-aging medicine, they would just market it as a drug that prevents one or more diseases of aging (heart failure, liver failure, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's, or whatever).  Anything that actually slowed down aging should delay or prevent at least some of the diseases of aging, after all, if it actually works.   That would be somewhat easier to prove (still not easy, but easier), and the FDA actually recognizes those things as diseases, so if you could create a drug that could prevent those, you could get it approved.   The slowing of the aging process might just be considered a side effect, lol.  That's basically the plan they were using when trying to develop cr-mimic drugs and all that.  And once the drug is approved, then any doctor can prescribe it for anything he wants; you just have to find a doctor willing to prescribe for off-label purposes (like as a general anti-aging drug).  The company can't advertise it for off-label purposes, though, so you would probably have to educate yourself on the subject."
Transhuman,1sbc91,Yosarian2,2,Sun Dec 8 22:26:48 2013 UTC,"Exactly. There won't be any drugs or procedures that specifically target aging, since aging isn't really the problem. Instead, these drugs will target the parts of the body that fail due to aging, which is much easier to test for."
Transhuman,1sbc91,chronoflect,2,Sun Dec 8 22:50:48 2013 UTC,"If there was a general purpose anti-aging drug (like a good CR mimic), then it would slow aging all over the body.  They wouldn't have to prove that, though; they would just have to show that it reduces the 5-year risk of heart attack in people with high blood pressure or something like that, and they can get it approved.  And it should; it should reduce or delay a wide variety of aging related illness, if the animal models are anything to go by."
Transhuman,1sbc91,Yosarian2,1 point,Sat Dec 7 13:56:30 2013 UTC,"Aging is a highly complex interaction of multiple processes, not just a single mechanism.  There won't be a general-purpose anti-aging drug because pharmaceuticals don't work that way.  And pharmaceuticals can't even address many of the things going on there anyhow -- some of the damages are mechanical, others are not accessible to the cardiovascular system, and some are genetic.  This is what SENS was meant to address, and it is the most likely venue through which we will see antiagathic success stories coming."
Transhuman,1sbc91,IConrad,1 point,Sat Dec 7 15:34:45 2013 UTC,"There won't be a general-purpose anti-aging drug because pharmaceuticals don't work that way.    Well, a good CR mimic that worked in humans would be a general purpose anti-aging drug, because calorie restriction seems to slow down most signs of aging, and delay most aging related disease, at least in mice (heart failure, dementia, Alzheimer's, ect.)  Some of the genes involved there (like SIRT-1) seem to be a switch that can slow down the speed of a lot of different aging processes.  But this applies to SENS as well; if a combination of SENS therapies were able to repair several of the forms of molecular damage caused by aging, then you could get it approved by the FDA as a therapy that ""reduces your risk of heart failure"" or ""reduces your risk of type 2 diabetes"" or ""reduces your risk of Alzheimer's"" or some other aging-related disease.     If you don't prevent, delay, or reduce the risk of at least some aging-related diseases, then that means you haven't found a treatment or combination of treatments that actually is impacting aging."

You're missing the point altogether.  SENS as a model is aimed at eliminating the mechanical conditions we call ""aging"", by recognizing the fact that there is no such thing as aging itself. Instead, there is a myriad of things that happen over time and by producing solutions to those problems, you will eliminate aging itself.  A good example of this: caloric restriction does absolutely nothing to impact the onset of senescence in macrophages.  (That is, your white blood cells getting old.)  There is an active research project that is ongoing to help remediate that condition using a model that is akin to dialysis.  Nor does caloric restriction do anything to affect things like solidification in the bursae, retinal cloudiness, etc., etc., etc..  It is NOT a genuine ""general-purpose"" antiagathic and should not be viewed as such."

Yeah, that's certainly one possible use for the technology.  But, at least in mice and some other lower animals, it seems to do a lot more then that.   It appears that the body deliberately focuses on reducing intracellular damage and such, probably with the evolutionary goal of ""survive until the famine is over, and then have kids"".  It appears to lower the risk or delay of almost everything; cancer, liver failure, dementia, muscle weakness caused by aging, hair falling out from old age, and so on.   The effect is pretty stunning; the risk of death from all causes is lower in any given age range when mice, or dogs, or other animals re on an optimal CR diet.  Of course, that only delays and slows aging, it doesn't stop it like SENS might, but it is a pretty significant effect.   You're missing the point altogether.

Yes, yes, of course I understand all that, but you are missing my point.  We're not talking about the science, we're talking about the law.     Legally, the FDA can only approve a medcial treatment if it either prevents or cures a recognized disease.  The loophole here is that if SENS works at all, it should prevent some of the diseases that the FDA does recognize.   If they can prove that, then they should be able to get it approved.  Basically, it's a legal work-around to the problem of eventually getting FDA approval for something like SENS in humans so it can legally be done by doctors.      It is NOT a genuine ""general-purpose"" antiagathic...   That's not what the research shows, at least in animals where it has been shown to work.  Of course, we don't actually know if it will work in humans or not.  But if it does, then it most likely will be a general purpose drug capable of delaying aging.    I know a lot of SENS partisans are trying to attack CR-mimic research (perhaps to get more money for SENS research) but that seems silly to me.   If a CR-mimic can slow down some of the molecular causes of aging, then it would work very well with early SENS treatments that can medically treat some of the molecular causes of aging."

Aging (in  Aubrey de Grey's theory, at least) is just a number of forms of cellular molecular damage.  When I talk about aging, you should understand that those forms of damage are exactally what I am talking about.   But that doesn't actually change the issue here at all, because the FDA doesn't recognize telomere degradation or inter-cellular junk as a disease either.  All I am saying is that if SENS treatments work, then they should prevent or delay some diseases recognized by the FDA, and if they could show that would then be able to use that to get them approved.    The CR thing is a completely unrelated issue,; I'm willing to discuss that too, if you want, but it's completely unrelated. Now, yes, the metabolic changes are the triggering event, but it's not clear how they cause, for example, cancer, or maintain the immune system for longer.

Transhuman,1sbc91,Yosarian2,1 point,Sun Dec 8 23:24:50 2013 UTC,"Well the issue is that aging isn't a single disease process, there are a lot of things going on, and many would likely have to be treated individually. The cure for aging related muscle loss is not likely to help dementia. Outside of removing the body from the equation entirely (uploading or what not), it will require nearly as many fixes as there are problems.  In a scenario like that the FDA will function fine, treatment x repairs telomeres which prevent copy errors during cell division, which reduces the incidence of cancer. Treatment Y replaces muscle lost to age or disease, allowing senior citizens unprecedented quality of life.

The same would be true for, say, an effective CR-mimic drug; if something could be found that worked in humans the same way those drugs work in mice, then it would slow and delay many of the processes of aging.

Which is why new drugs' manufacturers must first go through their own run of unpublished tests demonstrating the safety of the drug, then submit request to the FDA based on those tests to be allowed to pay the FDA to run the same tests over again, finally getting them permission to pay a rather large fee to be presented for consideration for approval.  Meanwhile marijuana for example is considered according to the FDA to be one of the worst of all possible drugs to have ever existed. Worse than heroin, methamphetamines, crack-cocaine... etc., etc..  On top of that, you'll notice that NOWHERE in the above was there mention of any kind whatsoever of public peer review.

Take for example: I remember reading futurism theory about how a power cell could eventually be used with nanotechnology to deliver the key nutrients our body needs and to provide us with the chemical/(etc.) balences that the human body needs. Such a theory would imply that we would never have to eat, never if ever get sick, and never if ever have to sleep.  We are in /r/transhumanism, so I try to think outside the box.  Further thought, even if something is illegal in the USA (where most Reddit users come from, statistically) - there's nothing to say as of now that it wouldn't be hypothetically legal in another country.  There are many elective medical procedures that aren't ""legal"" that you can find outside of the USA. Take for example the body-mod where you place a magnet under the skin of the fingers (if that has a name or term, I don't recall). If I walk to my Doctor and ask for it, he may give me a head exam :P - but if I find a Doctor in Mexico or some other country with either A. more loose medical practice or B. Shady Doctors willing to break the rules, then the procedure could still happen.  In terms of medication, if you drive to Mexico you can see a Doctor for cheap pesos and get a prescription for about any medication you want! Not sure the legality of that and crossing borders, but I know it happens.

Some of the studies are promising but they're generally along the lines of ""it did something in these couple of people and we know the brain does X and zapping it helps with X so this should totally work."" There isn't a lot of hard evidence directly relating to the idea of hooking your brain up to a battery as to if it's a decent idea or not and I personally would rather wait to see if they do find something or not.  It's like male birth control; I am 100% behind the idea but that's a bandwagon I'm not jumping on for ten years at least from the initial introduction date because I really don't want to be part of that early adopter crowd that discovers there's something horribly wrong that just wasn't caught by previous testing.  I'm equally nervous about procedures that have the potential to cause brain damage and my dick to fall off, doubly so if we're not really sure of the chances of it happening are."

Yes, I got a little graphic for those in the cheap seats.  Flippant though I may have been, it doesn't change the fact that there really haven't been many (actually any that I've found) large scale studies done on this procedure. I agree completely that small experiments have shown results but they seem to be somewhat inconsistent with very small sample sizes which is, to use a medical term, balls un-sound science. I'm not putting this on the E-meter shelf but as far as I can see, it's a largely unproven concept for a medical treatment.  For me personally, the words ""un-proven"" when found in the same sentence as ""medical treatment"" don't exactly fill me with confidence, especially when you're talking about my brain. Don't get me wrong, if this turns out to be a legit not long-term damage inducing thing I will be first in line to buy the deluxe model. Until then, I want to see bigger experiments done by more authoritative institutions and more consistent results before I classify it any higher than ""questionable."""

If a lobbyist vanished, the total social good might not take mush of a hit. But the firm that that lobbyist used to work for would notices. That lobbyist was creating a lot of value for that firm and it's backers. It's not a mystery why these jobs exists, it's called rent-seeking.

A bit less questionable are the marketers and PR workers whose job it is to convince the public that they need something.

Transhuman,1rqfy4,TDaltonC,2,Sat Nov 30 20:01:06 2013 UTC,"That is almost certainly not true.   What will happen is that the force of the magnetic current will cause them to get very hot, which could be quite painful and possibly cause serious burns and/or other internal injuries, depending on the magnetic properties of the implant (e.g. iron or nickel= very ferromagnetic, you have a problem; aluminum or copper= very weakly paramagnetic, you'd probably be fine).  Now, MRIs are very strong, and can pull stretchers or air tanks across a room with explosive and deadly force, and you should certainly not get in an MRI with ferrous materials in your body. But they're almost certainly not going to rocket out of your flesh."
Transhuman,1rqfy4,Heimdall2061,0,Sat Nov 30 20:17:24 2013 UTC,"They wouldn't just get hot. Looped conductors would get hot. These would get pulled into the bore.

Transhuman,1rqfy4,TDaltonC,1 point,Sat Nov 30 20:36:27 2013 UTC,"From the inventor of this procedure:   Originally it was thought that the magnets would always rip out of the skin and attach themselves to the MRI. However, we now know of a few people who have the magnets have gone through MRIs and this did not happen. One person reported that the magnet just vibrated very strongly. Another person reported that the techs shielded his hand, as they would with someone who had shrapnel or other implants. However, there are several different types of MRIs, so we can make no guarantee of what will happen during your MRI, so you must discuss it with the technician. It is likely that they will give you a hard time about it, so you should be prepared for this and for any possible risks to yourself. It is also possible that the MRI might demagnetize your magnet."

There's plenty of information on people with these implants having MRIs, and not a single case of if ripping out— other complications, perhaps, but even then the MRI technicians have precautions to reduce risk. It's not like it's uncommon for people with ferrous metals in their body to have MRIs.  I think you're just one of those people who can't admit he was wrong. Have a good one."

Transhuman,1rg8j8,jart,1 point,Tue Nov 26 02:20:47 2013 UTC,"Thanks for the recommendation, I have actually heard of this book and concept before. Whilst I, of course, agree with the premise, it unfortunately does not mitigate the fact that although 'we' are less violent on average, we now have the means to destroy, maim, kill - basically commit violence - on a scale unimaginable and unprecedented throughout our history. Be it atomic, biological or environmental. Do you see anything 'within us' that would prevent current or near-future leaders from utilising these weapons.. especially as resource scarcity becomes more and more of an issue?   My question is basically: Is there a bottom limit to what will always be 'acceptable violence' - the bottom of a power-law curve that is still above the ""fair, just and happy society"" with our biology as it currently stands?"
Transhuman,1rg8j8,jart,3,Tue Nov 26 09:43:30 2013 UTC,"When you mentioned being able to commit violence on an unimaginable scale, I assume you're referring to nuclear weapons. At least that's the classic example. The existence of such weapons is big part of why superpowers don't really go to war anymore. They all fear mutual destruction. Their leaders are also smart enough to understand game theory: ""the only winning move is not to play"". It's in everyone's best interests to engage in positive sum games instead like posting cat videos on youtube.  As for 'acceptable violence' it depends on the culture. Some cultures like nazi germany loved violence and it turned out to be a bad idea. Mostly because it caused them to be a threat to other nations, who responded by crushing them.  As for whether or not we utilize weapons of mass-violence as resources become scarce, I would say that the best assurance we have that stuff like nuclear weapons won't be used is because they're so crude. You don't even like, get to use the land after you nuke it. Well, maybe if you use that neutrino bomb thing?  It really depends on what you fear. Do you fear extinction of the human race? Do you fear violence used to purge lower classes? Destruction of natural habitats?"
Transhuman,1rg8j8,jart,1 point,Tue Nov 26 12:51:14 2013 UTC,"I see what you're saying, but none of it preclude nuclear war per-se. Additionally, zero-sum gain still relies on a culture of fear and, further, requires the limiting of others having the same technology as 'you'. What happens in a scenario with massive resource depletion - maybe some sociopathic ideologue comes along and, in an extremely hostile environment/state of the world, suggests that nukes are the solution that 'this way we can feed ourselves'. It seems very extreme, but imagine going back to 1850 and asking what the worst they could imagine in 100 years would be...  Violence can be more targeted now and, in some ways, that is even more devastating. If a dissident, or dissident nation, has any hope of opposing a corrupt status quo but can be targeted wherever and whenever.. how do we progress. Recent revelations show that the ability to know nearly everything are progressing nicely.. what is the next step..?  This isn't about fear, although it plays a significant part of my question. I would like our species to survive.. but to do more than 'just survive'. Violence has always, and appears to be, the only way of ultimately solving our problems. That no matter what happens, violence is the ultimate effective tool. I would also like our species to progress beyond that - do you think it is possible in our current form, with its proclivity towards violence as a 'justified' and effective tool?"
Transhuman,1rg8j8,justwow2013,2,Tue Nov 26 13:07:34 2013 UTC,"Additionally, zero-sum gain still relies on a culture of fear and, further   Hobbes would argue that the natural state of man is fear and violence. But we use our faculty of reason to escape that by engineering society in a way where we can all trust each other. This is the progress of civilization and we've had a lot of success if you look at history. By all agreeing to give up violence and love each other, we can eliminate fear and spend our energies on more productive forms of labor like posting cat videos on YouTube.  Let's take it down a step from nuclear weapons. The problem with discussing nuclear weapons is that the only actors are nation-states. So things become very abstract and hard to talk about without studying lots of political theory.  So what do humans fear? I think it's pretty terrifying that anyone could a) go to Home Depot; b) buy a saw; and c) do this. That's much more terrifying to me than the atomic bomb. If they drop the bomb on East Village where I live, I'll be vaporized and I won't have to worry. If they drop it somewhere else, then I get to live in an awesome mad max dystopia and try my hand at being a regional warlord! It'll be fun. But someone sawing me in half. Anything but that. Seriously I don't fucking want that to happen to me. Anything is better than that.  So why don't we live in a ""culture of fear"" of being sawed in half? You implied that we must live in fear of the atomic bomb which only threatens nation-states. So why doesn't that apply to humans anymore? Think about it. Do you feel afraid of being raped or assaulted when you walk down to the store to buy a bagel? If not, then you're probably fortunate enough to be an upper or middle class westerner who has the privilege of living in a community where everyone has consensually agreed to not use violence.   requires the limiting of others having the same technology as 'you'   Not necessarily. Nuclear weapons aren't actually limited. I took AP Chemisty. I have Internet access. If I was motivated enough, I could do the research and source the materials to put together a dirty bomb of some sort. But I'm glad that the professionals who use those materials on a regular basis have the professional ethics in place to make that as difficult as possible, thereby limiting the number of people who are capable of such an act to a very small percentage of smart people.   So why doesn't society fear smart people building dirty bombs? Because it gives them six-figure jobs so their idle hands don't become the tools of the devil. So instead of building nuclear bombs, I help build Internet infrastructure so people can watch cat videos.   maybe some sociopathic ideologue comes along   Not anymore. We live in the age of bayesian statistics. I think future elections will be influenced by the candidates DNA being made public. It's not difficult to harvest off an individual when you're motivated. We'll then be able to predict how likely it is that they're a sociopath based on their genes.   Recent revelations show that the ability to know nearly everything are progressing nicely.. what is the next step..?   What is best in life? I would say to continue pursuing our passion for acquiring knowledge and pleasure in perpetuity.   Violence has always, and appears to be, the only way of ultimately solving our problems.    You don't really believe that, do you? If so, please tell me a story about the last time you used violence to solve a problem in thine own life.   I would also like our species to progress beyond that - do you think it is possible in our current form   Yes. Absolutely. We don't necessarily need to start doing crazy transhumanist shit to our bodies. The traditional processes hitherto used by humans to mold ourselves towards the sublime are actually quite effective. There are three of them:   Training. Regardless of DNA, the human brain is remarkable in the sense that if you give it 10,000 of training), it can become just about anything. This is the fact that keeps me believing in people :) It's why I still love and believe in the inherent goodness of each and every person. Ritual and taboo. Social forces are very powerful at instilling certain sets of behaviors in individuals. Learned behaviors are very real, yet ethereal substances that propagate between individuals. It's the stuff that train our neural networks. Stuff which can't be understood through reductionist processes. The best analogy would be the clusterfuck of data structures that emerge in the RAM after successfully training a machine learning algorithm. That information can take on a life of its own. Take for instance Christianity which has the characteristics of a mental virus. It's successfully self-replicated itself between the minds of individuals for millennia. It instills very specific behaviors on its hosts. But these patterns aren't limited to religion and they're not always evil. While they oftentimes emerge without any reason or rationale, they will very rarely lead to progress and enlightenment. Like hygiene was originally just a habit of nobility trying to make themselves distinct from lower classes. They didn't know anything about germs. But eventually the lower classes caught on to the fact that those behaviors give you an advantage and adopted it themselves. Partner selection. Breeding is governed by certain natural processes where the individual selects mates based on a whole variety of things. Over the past million or so years, this has proven effective at shaping the truly remarkable humans that we have today. It's still happening. This is the slowest of the three.   Transhumanists would be well-served to make a diligent effort to understand how the current system works before they try to replace it.   with [our] proclivity towards violence   Listen, I just want to say... that as a woman—so please swallow a large grain of salt before you continue reading and don't shout me down guys for saying this because I know Reddit is heavily biased as 80% male and facts like this are extremely inconvenient and unpopular—but when you talk about ""our"" problems with violence... what you're actually talking about are men.  Nearly all the violence in this society is committed by men. Men are the ones committing all the violence. But not just men in general, it's usually men between the ages of 18 and 32. You don't get to debate this. It's just a fact. Women don't have a problem with violence.  Now before you call me sexist, I just want to say that I don't believe the true problem is with men! I totally love you guys—you're awesome! I mean it. It's actually a problem with testosterone. You could even be a woman with lots of testosterone; it doesn't matter. The more testosterone you have, the more likely you are to start being violent.  Now before you call me chemicalist, I just want to say that I don't believe the true problem is with testosterone! Over the years men have learned to push those feelings towards the sublime and engage in other sorts of aggressive activities. Things like the cutthroat competition in academia to discover knowledge. Or going in for the kill in the market trying to promote your sexy new app.  So I'd say it's more of a problem with the less sophisticated sorts of men. Many men don't know or don't care to sublimate their violent tendencies. Most of the times it'll be due to the fact that they haven't been trained properly. They didn't receive the love and education that they needed to be successful. So basically it's a problem with class. So many men are forced by this twisted society to grow up in poverty, be abused, mistreated, and live in want. They learn nothing but how to feel hurt and hurt others. They are not afforded the same education and opportunities. So when you combine man's natural aggression with a lifetime of lived experiences that have trained him to have no other knowledge of the world except violence, naturally he will express himself with violence.  Edit: s/ephemeral/ethereal/ damnit I always type out the opposite of what's in my head."
Transhuman,1rg8j8,justwow2013,2,Tue Nov 26 15:47:33 2013 UTC,"Thank you so much for your extremely considered reply. Will do my best to discuss all the points!  First, nation states are the conclusion of socioeconomic theory and shouldn't be discounted too quickly. Abstract ideas are given simplistic slogans to rally support and make not-always-majority decisions on behalf of people i.e. Iraq/Afghanistan. Interestingly, you used the same medieval torture device that came to mind when replying before. The culture of violence has reduced (see replies to other comments below), I agree with this fact. The use of violence, even among the supposed 'most civilised' societies remains. The severity etc. may be different, more targeted.. but it is still there.. and 100,000 civilians still died in Iraq. When you talk of a ""dirty bomb"" do you mean a fission one (highly effective and devastating) or one that 'just' spread radioactivity.. which is far less harmful/destructive.   Not anymore. We live in the age of bayesian statistics.   We are quite far from candidate DNA being provided in elections don't you think? Plus... DNA/brain structure aren't always good indicators of psychopathy such as the neuroscientist who accidentally discovered he was a psychopath. Also an interesting TED talk here. The fact remains that, for the immediate future the possibility of such candidates remain. Plus, look at the current generation of politicians; they all seem to follow a similar mould (here in the UK they nearly always study PPE).   You don't really believe that, do you? If so, please tell me a story about the last time you used violence to solve a problem in thine own life.   I meant ultimately as ultimate. We have many methods of solving problems and violence is not always physical, it can be emotional too. Ever guilt tripped someone into doing what you want.. what about leaders using fear to sell their vested interests.. is this a form of emotional violence? Perhaps that needs more discussion. Typically one solves problems by talking.. if that fails we use the court system. If you remove 'normal' controls and let a market self regulate you see violence as one of the primary means of control - for reference look at the world illicit drug market. Here is a brilliant talk on cartels using violence too. All that separates 'drug markets' from licit drug markets (such as Alcohol and Tobacco) is dispute resolution. You can't take to court/sue and brand/patent/tradmark in the normal way. Thousands, if not millions, of people all over the world use violence, or the threat of violence to solve disputes - just look at how the threat of violence here is used for something as arbitrary as cutting into traffic. Perhaps 'threat of violence' would have been a better phrase to use.. but the point still stands that when all else fails, our species turns to violence, either on the individual level or the state level. Not always, granted, but in far more cases than one would like to admit when trying to say that our species can climb out of its metaphorical adolescence. I somewhat envy your belief that we can progress without at least some fundamental changes :).  Regarding your three points of moulding ourselves are good ones. I agree with training and ritual and taboo but do have some issues with partner selection.. Could this, in fact, be viewed within the same premise as my original post - that we are having to fundamentally change ourselves in order to progress? That it might take 10,000-100,000 more years of evolution to attain that 'near-perfect' goal? My original point still stands if that is the case. Additionally, changes are occurring - brain sizes have shrunk in the last 20,000 years:   ""Over the past 20,000 years, the average volume of the human male brain has decreased from 1,500 cubic centimeters to 1,350 cc, losing a chunk the size of a tennis ball. The female brain has shrunk by about the same proportion."" link   Is this getting dumber or more efficient wiring? We don't know yet.. but again it points towards the premise of my question. Maybe a combination of brain/biology changes, selected by cooperative living is the manner in which the goal will be achieved? Still requires that fundamental change though...   Nearly all the violence in this society is committed by men.   I would be hard pressed to disagree with this, although do always love a source :). I don't think your comment is sexist providing it is empirically true (which I suspect it is). So, what we have is violent and aggressive males.. charming and intelligent ones, who express said negative traits in more subtle ways. It could be signing a document that commits a nation to war without doing any of the killing themselves. The problem is that these types of people, most often men, will typically rise above the rest. Now, we have to recognise why. If society or culture were different then maybe these types of personality would never get anywhere.. but as soon as one expands beyond a small tribal community you will typically witness such personalities residing at the top (I need a source for this, but reading the news and about any top govt decisions it seems to strongly implicate this), even if it's behind the scenes/head of a corporation etc. Why is this? I 'think' it's because certain people are better at manipulating the primitive parts of our brains - things like confirmation bias. How many times have you shown someone empirical fact and it just strengthens their opposition to your point? Is class a by-product of personality traits?  All of these questions are trying to expose the core, underlying reasons for why society is the way it is. I don't think blame can be pinned on one specific thing, gender or hormone.. but more a complex web of interactions in an uncertain environment. Can we change our environment, through some of the methods you highlighted, reduce scarcity etc. and eliminate the need of fundamental changes to ourselves.. I don't have the answer. I keep seeing the same human patterns repeat themselves over and over and over. Yes, to some degree, they get 'less bad' than the previous cycle. But as discussed elsewhere here, is there a bottom limit to this power-law curve that cannot be crossed without fundamental changes? I don't know. I would like to remain optimistic.. but haven't been convinced yet :s."

If the nazis and eugenicists had their way, they'd have breed the human race into a bunch of mindless thugs. Then they'd kill off other nations, burn the books, and eliminate any culture they felt to be a threat. Eugenics was a pseudoscience because fascists hate knowledge.  I like knowledge. It's why I like diversity. Lots of diverse people with different DNA, different cultures, different personalities, and different lived experiences means more knowledge. That's good.  But we're not talking about everyday people. We're talking about people being entrusted to privileged positions of power. It's commonly acknowledged in any statist culture that people who seek elected positions must give up certain types of privacy."
Transhuman,1rg8j8,yoda17,1 point,Thu Nov 28 15:18:00 2013 UTC,"privileged positions of power.   You once again, seemingly obliviously, missed my whole rebuttal's point by narrowly focusing on the one part you realized you could poke a hole through. By that criteria, your six-figure ""bribe"" salary should have as a prerequisite a passing of the genetic sociopath test, which I actually insinuated before. Incidentally, you would fail it, miserably. Or, given that its the ""sociopath test"", I should probably say ""ace with flying colors"".  Not to mention, doesn't this case very clearly show what a slippery slope it is? First elected officials, then, capitalists. Then, the nerd aristocracy. Where does it stop? And, once we have ""scientific"" criteria for identifying predestined psychopaths, and even state-endorsed ones at that, why would we even want to have them around, at all? I'm not saying we have to execute them, at least not to start with, because that would be inhumane(!), but would we not want to contain them somewhere, for the sake of the civilized, cultured, ""better angel-natured,"" public? Well, now we're at imprisonment for purely genetic traits, on the basis of some theory that isn't even necessarily unanimously accepted by qualified scientists. (Even if it was totally unchallenged, you've now created a serious technocracy that's taken it upon itself to produce the criteria by which people will be judged as either fit or unfit for freedom. But isn't it an unethical burden to feed them with taxpayer dollars? Pretty soon, you're at Khmer Rouge. No big deal, I guess. Just the price of progress in scientific sophistication and evolution of the human race.  The thing about you is that your mind's contaminated with bullshit postmodernism. Your thought doesn't necessarily resemble it aesthetically, but it reeks of the postmodern ethic. That is to say that, despite the concrete reality which hasn't changed since Marx or any other serious thinker had their crack at it, you're less concerned with accurately describing the real lives and conditions of the billions of people who suffer under capitalism, or even refining the accuracy of others' descriptions, than you are with being quirky and original and hip and shocking. This is by the way where all the trans crap comes from, as well. So all of the quality analysis just gets erased, because it's, like, soooooooo last century. Never mind that if you actually read any of it and/or look up from your privileged computer screen every once in a while, none of it has ever been more relevant.  It's actually a great shame to me, because you have a rather strong intellect, and it has gone mostly to waste writing stupid apologies for pinker and dawkins for the sake of their shock value, in between tart defenses of the surveillance state, also for their shock value, which are in turn given in between actually building the surveillance state's infrastructure, probably, on some level, at least partially, too, for its shock value. Still less harmful than deceptively hijacking legitimately oppressed people's struggles, if you ask me, though, which I'm very glad you've at least mostly given a rest. I think I'm actually being pretty generous and kind by giving you some genuine and IMO valuable feedback on yourself here, which I do very reluctantly. What you do with it is of course out of my hands, but why don't you see if you can use it to your advantage instead of just immediately getting all defensive or whatever?  You also completely sidestepped the point of what eugenics is and isn't. It's always presented as furthering some unquestionably noble purpose, like the ones you espouse. Even if you're sincere and the other times it's been tried weren't, that doesn't disqualify the practice you advocate from being eugenics.  Finally, you're an idiot. Because genes are not what make people assholes. That kind of thinking comes from an extremely shallow mentality which can only be formed under prolonged, desperate and hurting isolation from others. Just like how you weren't born with any sense of womanhood, and it was shaped though very deep traumas that formed your perpetually depressed self. I think you have major issues, and that's why you behave so utterly out of control and sociopathically.  As an aside, assholeness is formed by culture, which is why advocating wider adoption of the bourgeois (oppressors') culture is such a toxic suggestion.  But, really, how is it that you're the one accusing me of trolling? With the kind of brilliant shit you crank out, who even needs /r/circlejerk? Then the nerve to accuse me of being the troll. It's like it was part of the performance or something, a kind of grand finale.  I think you meant to say ""stalker"" again, even though that would have of course been equally baseless."

I believe basic constitutions, universally upheld by legitimate authorities are sufficient to tackling most of the worlds ills. Sadly a lot of the authorities are illegitimate and our human rights are not upheld.  As such, instead of volunteering this policing and this protection of our society to an illusionary or distant body, we should focus on technologies, policies and philosophies that increase individual power. This could be our access to information and social media, improving accountability (which has already decreased the worlds violence and poverty by many orders of magntiude) or it could indeed be augmenting our physical bodies so that governments do not have a monopoly on physical or mental power.  Nanotech (in medicine, construction and other sectors), microbiology, sustainable energy, space exploration, enviromental work, electromagnetic weapons, cryogenics and intergalactic travel, new forms of art and relaxation....all these things should be priorities.   Exploring concepts that tap into the nature of metaphysics, such as ""downloading our consciousness"" (forcing us to ask if it's worthwhile, are we being stored or is it just a copy of us?) are a complete waste of time and indeed even irresponsible to indulge in whilst the above are not yet in order."

Any individual who chooses to do so will come against the natural might of all the other individuals with heightened rights and abilities.

I hardly think it's simplistic. I disregard them because, unlike the other advances I described, we do not even know if some of the more ""out-there"" ones are even beneficial (like the uploading of our consciousness, it may erase your own ego-stream).   My question was whether these changes are needed prior to being able to solve the other problems, to which, I don't think you have presented a concrete case just yet?

Any individual who chooses to do so will come against the natural might of all the other individuals with heightened rights and abilities.   Here, I have to disagree. If the corruption by Eddy Bernays et al./onwards in getting people to vote away their ""heightened rights and abilities"" isn't a glaring warning I don't know what is. Every time rights are enshrined they are slowly eroded on a generational basis. The Human mind is all too easily manipulated by fear. The concept of false-flag attacks could be utilised by the hypothetical ideologue I proposed. The ""might"" you talk of is scarily often used to coerce groupthink instead of defence of rights. How do we move past this? What about the 'machine cops' seen in Elysium, ones who would have zero qualms following orders and firing on a rioting/protesting crowd?  I do agree that there is an upward trend, or to phrase it differently:   ""The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice."" - MLK   However, technology can enslave as easily as it can free. Desire for control could envisage nanobots, mandated to be injected at birth, that cause extreme pain if one dissents. That one can think of these things means that other Humans have thought of them too. Whilst the use of such technology is abhorrent to me.. just take a look at the justifications given by the heads of the three-letter agencies after recent revelations and assure me that such thought processes and justifications would never be used against a populace..  What we are debating here is still framed within the current Human state of being. Will these negatives ever be able to suppressed on a global societal scale, even with transformative and potentially dangerous technologies? In our current forms.. I am not yet convinced.. unfortunately :(."

Every time rights are enshrined they are slowly eroded on a generational basis. The Human mind is all too easily manipulated by fear.    Now we're getting somewhere. I agree with you that this is the instrumental problem that we're seeing. However I think that the trends that the better educated people are, the more likely they are to vote, the more proportional a representation system (i.e, if the vote share is close to the share of parliamentary seats) the more likely people are too vote...we can take conscious choices to make people less apathetic.  Education, revamp of modern democracy. The ground-work is there as is the research.   However, technology can enslave as easily as it can free.

Again, this is another concept that we both identify as instrumental but take different stances of. The fact that surveillance, anti-pirate and security firms are ultimately still several steps behind the hackers, Anonymous and what have you proves to be that society as a gestalt entity will always be more powerful than the limited bueracratic instrumentation of that society byu a public entity.

Transhuman,1rg8j8,freedomgeek,2,Tue Nov 26 12:49:14 2013 UTC,"Some very interesting points there so I thank you. I understand the relationship of education and voting systems to positive change. But I am reminded of the story of Fritz Haber - renowned chemist and intellectual, winner of a Nobel prize, best friend to pacifist Einstein.. still chose to develop Chlorine gas and was a progenitor of an open letter of scientists justifying WWI:   ""In 1914, at the outset of the First World War, ninety-three academics signed a petition expressing support for Germany’s acts of belligerence."" link   Einstein in dissent, by comparison, only achieved three other signatures and dropped publication of his petition. The point to this is that education is not always, or necessarily, the defining metric by which our Human condition can be overcome for my original aim propsed.    ""All these phenomena are results of cause-and-effect within every human simply wanting an abundance of resources and the security to survive.""   I was reading about a post-scarcity world the other day.. maybe even in this sub. Where if our basic needs are taken care of then a lot of the problems we are discussing could be hugely mitigated. But it must be universal and would require the shedding of millennia of thought attuned to the 'natural order of things' i.e. social hierarchy/control. Would the vested interests be able to be overcome, especially without violent revolution?   ""This would continue even if we became androgynous shape-shifters.""   I couldn't say either way if this is true or not. But, I believe that if it were re-designed with these problems in mind then maybe it is solution. To, again, quote Einstein:   ""We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them."" (attributed to him, can't find a source)   The point is that we view these problems within our own limits and boundaries and that, maybe, moving to a different form could solve them. It is perfectly feasible that this is or isn't the case. We're born to solve problems in the natural world in a tribal collection of a limited number of individuals. I just worry that our current limits will always allow the charming and intelligent psychopath to rise to power by manipulating the worst parts of our nature(s).   What changes to ourselves do you think could solve this?   This wasn't really part of my original question and I may not be as versed as many more learned readers/posters in this sub so perhaps me proposing a transhumanist future is not appropriate? Perhaps someone more enlightened on the subject could help as to specifics?"

Isn't it our aim to get people to realize that there is no such thing as an ideal form of being and that they should let go of the currently rigidly defined norm of what a human being is supposed to look like? Personally I am thinking that culturally enforcing a norm against which all others are measured kinda goes against everything transhumanism is about.   If you want to live like a slug, you should still be able to find love. Even though people are allowed to be disgusted by your appearance, they should at least learn to overcome such prejudice and try to be polite. Calling someone ugly to their face is just bad manners, doing it behind their back would still draw a frown from me but hey tastes differ and if you want to use hurtful language, that's your right. Perhaps a liquid glass polymorph will love tze slug for who they are and not what they look like. Appearance doesn't really matter much anyway in a world where you can just reconfigure the appearance of your partner depending on the fetish you want to satisfy. Everything that disturbs you too much to get over mentally, you can just alter your physical perception of, just like we have adblockers today, we can have smellblockers or visual IF that, replace by THIS kinda stuff."
Transhuman,1re8q7,Erebeon,0,Mon Nov 25 19:20:16 2013 UTC,"I am sorry if I sounded a bit harsh, that certainly wasn't my intention! It's just that I've had this discussion a lot and usually it comes down to one side defending a norm, and the other rejecting it completely.  To be honest I haven't completely figured it out myself yet. I think that ultimately this is very much related to the debate on homogenization vs diversification. If it interests you; I wrote my thoughts on it not that long ago but haven't really arrived on a conlusion yet. The truth might lie somewhere in the middle. This text mostly relates to cognitive freedom and similiarty but could easily be applied to morphological freedom as well.  It's definitely the case that mankind is rapidly becoming more homogeneous. We are losing languages, traditions, even whole modes of thinking and ways of looking at the world when you consider that the way you label things influences perception (like that tribe that can differentiate between more colors of green because they have different base color labels).   There are both pros and cons to this. As homogenization weeds out differences, it is likely to facilitate communication, decrease adversity between people, and perhaps even make peace more likely. The assimilation of ""island"" cultures into one global culture is happening at breakneck pace and it likely won't stop for the foreseeable future. Although on the other hand, one could also argue that the internet is feeding sub cultures, creating new groups not based on nationality but on common interests. Either way the shrinking of the world and the elimination of barriers to information are likely to make us more similar, not different.  Ultimately, Homogenization's endgame might look something alike to the borg monoculture, where individuals don't really exist anymore in a meaningful sense, but are instead dumb terminals driven by a mainframe.Think of Google Now, at the moment it knows about traffic jams and can suggest alternative routes but if it manages to reach 70% of the population it could actually direct humans and relegate traffic jams to the history books. You don't get to choose the route but the collective would grow more efficient. The endgame could see google now grow into the borg queen. ;)   It could start as a symbiotic relationship but could easily evolve into something parasitic if the borg queen thinks that makes sense. For example, in order to stave of climate change, she could limit the freedom of the one in order to increase survivability of all. In the end it might make more sense for this borg queen to think of herself as the brain, since she directs all to optimize efficiency, and humans as her hands and data gathering sensors. She is all of mankind's knowledge, all the modes of thinking. Humans die all the time and this doesn't really seem to matter for the big picture, in fact we have gone through bottlenecks that have killed the majority of our species and we have always bounced back. All the information to make more people is stored in our DNA and all we need in order to retain culture, knowledge and skills are educated brains that can replicate these knowledge patterns to other brains through tutoring.  You could, imo rightfully, argue that this information is more important than a human being since a person growing up without it wouldn't be what we consider to be a sensitive thinking human being, but would actually be a caveman who could do no more than grunt and likely wouldn't even be able to start a fire, let alone know fire exists until he stumbles upon it in the wild. Since both our cultural knowledge and DNA have already been digitized, she would have access to both and could thus logically arrive at the conclusion that her survival is more important than that of humans and that humans in fact serve no other purpose than to ensure the survival of these kinds of information.  I can't even really bring myself to describe that as wrong, there isn't really a right or wrong way to exist. We don't think ant colonies are evil either, nor do we think they don't have a right to exist. If such a borgian culture ever develops it probably won't be enforced, many might join because it would make their life safer, easier and perhaps even happier. Still, even though this isn't particularly wrong, if life is rare, it would be foolish to put all our eggs in one basket. If life is a huge cosmic experiment, we should try to create and fill as many cultural niches and modes of being as possible in order to ensure that we stack the odds in favor of some forms of life reaching the finish line. That might very well be the death of the universe but it would be romantically poetic if someone were around to see the lights go out.  I am drifting off, gotta get back to the point. :p Like you said, one way to reduce homogenization and reboot diversification in a big way would be to reintroduce new communication barriers and lightspeed would definitely fill that void (pun intended ;)) but I am hoping this reboot might kick in much sooner. I know it's not a popular idea but I am in favor of genetic engineering and not just of the faster, better, stronger kind. I prefer ""different"", tentacles and wings kind of different. :p Both genetic engineering and custom biomodificating hardware could radically alter what it means to be human and with it consciousness itself. If you can hear magnetic fields from birth, have a non defined gender, if you can soar through the sky or you grew up your formative years underwater in the deep ocean, you are likely to have a mindset and with it thoughts that have never, not once been thought on this planet before."

Nobody said anything about race until you chimed in, and as far as I can tell this discussion has nothing to do with it. Also, contrary to your baseless insinuation, human societies most certainly do hold universal beauty standards, which are not specifically correlated to any racial groupings and which I will cite directly from this 2010 Psychology Today article:   Males tend to seek out female mates who possess youth, clear skin, a symmetrical face and body, feminine facial features, [and] an hourglass figure ... those [features] indicating that a woman would be a healthy, fertile candidate to pass on a man's genes. Females tend to prefer men who are taller than they are, with symmetrical features (a sign that a potential partner is healthy and parasite-free).

Again, the latest studies available seem to suggest that competitive pressures vis-a-vis mate selection, and not media exposure, are the driving forces behind body dissatisfaction. As long as there is competition for attractive mates, there will be an evolutionary impetus for beautification.   But desirability doesn't have to be based on physicality. We don't have to be slaves to physical prejudice...   Evolution favours individuals which tend to have an inborn attraction to desirable/healthy members of the opposite sex of their own species, for the explicit purpose of procreation. This is why, for example, that homosexuality tends to be less common than heterosexuality, or why bestiality is extremely rare. When we talk about a word like ""attraction"" and its functions in human relations, that is what we are talking about. There is no other evolutionary use for being physically attracted to other people than to either mate with them, or (ie cute babies) nurture them. So, desirability has always been based on physicality and will continue to be so for a long time to come.   I'm not denying that people are shallow (including myself), I'm claiming we shouldn't simply accept that and further drive ourselves in that direction...   I'm proposing transhumanism as a method for people who suffer social, economic, and romantic setbacks because of their looks to be able to improve their appearances and thus their lives. I make no claims regarding the perceived moral of immoral nature of physical attraction, I merely assert that it exists, that it is a consistent reality for human beings, and that with a little effort and understanding it can be used as a tool for self-betterment.

Transhuman,1re8q7,wootup,0,Fri Nov 29 02:38:09 2013 UTC,"Sure, that's entirely plausible. But again, the idea behind transhumanism is people modifying themselves how they please. What route that takes is entirely their    Thanks for validating my point.  Anyway, Transhumanists aren't always so libertarian...   Again, the latest studies available seem to suggest that competitive pressures vis-a-vis mate selection, and not media exposure, are the driving forces behind body dissatisfaction. As long as there is competition for attractive mates, there will be an evolutionary impetus for beautification.   And physically modifying to select for certain kinds of beauty will create even more pressure and competition. This is not good.   Evolution favours individuals which tend to have an inborn attraction to desirable/healthy members of the opposite sex of their own species, for the explicit purpose of procreation. This is why, for example, that homosexuality tends to be less common than heterosexuality, or why bestiality is extremely rare. When we talk about a word like ""attraction"" and its functions in human relations, that is what we are talking about. There is no other evolutionary use for being physically attracted to other people than to either mate with them, or (ie cute babies) nurture them. So, desirability has always been based on physicality and will continue to be so for a long time to come.   I thought transhumanism was about taking control of our own evolution...so now when we're talking about rejecting fucked up aesthetic prejudice we suddenly just have to accept it?    I'm proposing transhumanism as a method for people who suffer social, economic, and romantic setbacks because of their looks to be able to improve their appearances and thus their lives. I make no claims regarding the perceived moral of immoral nature of physical attraction, I merely assert that it exists, that it is a consistent reality for human beings, and that with a little effort and understanding it can be used as a tool for self-betterment.   Why not focus on getting rid of the aesthetic prejudice throughout society by a combination of socialization and modifications? Why should we devalue people based on looks when that idea is ridiculously archaic? I don't care if it exists. Stop hiding behind neutrality and realize that ethics are bound up in almost every aspect of our life.    Politically, I agree with this statement. Biologically, I can't help but disagree; you can wax poetic all you want about the injustice of it all, but I will still find attractive people attractive and unattractive people unattractive, as will most everybody else.   Trying to split politics out of biological modification is silly. Technology is not neutral, it is bound up in ideology too.   I know you do, but why are you not advocating change on this issue, so-called transhumanist?   As far as human beings are concerned, there are quantifiable beauty ideals, which I listed in my first post, which can be generally regarded as objectively desirable to members of that species. These traits are consistent across cultures and time periods, and are indicators of good genes, health, and/or social    Those listed qualities are pretty loose guidelines. Additionally they're not objective, there is no physical or metaphysical law of beauty. Those ideals are still based on change and evolution, which isn't static.    Unfortunately, for the unattractive people who suffer from statistically lower incomes, worse career prospects, limited romantic choices and poor self-esteem, I suspect that being ugly probably is a problem.   No. Viewing people as ugly is the problem. Those people suffer not because they're ugly but because people are aesthetically prejudiced. Stop victim blaming."
Transhuman,1re8q7,omjvivi,2,Fri Nov 29 03:17:51 2013 UTC,"Thanks for validating my point.   All I've stated is that as transhumanist technology becomes more accessible in the coming decades (presumably including gene therapies, mechanical enhancements, etc.), people will either elect - or not elect - to modify themselves as they please. That may or may not involve changing something like their skin tone, which would be entirely their decision, not yours or mine. Fundamentally, I see no moral difference between changing the colour of one's skin to changing the colour of one's eyes or hair. Whatever makes people happy is fine by me; they certainly know what they themselves want more than you or I do.   Anyway, Transhumanists aren't always so libertarian...   You don't need to resort to a word like ""libertarian"" to describe the position I'm expressing. You could also easily use a word like ""liberal"" (the individual as a rational actor proceeding according to their best interest), ""anarchist"" (people organizing their lives according to how they desire, not how the state or capital necessarily stipulates), ""socialist"" (making technology accessible so that people can improve their lot in life if they wish to), or even ""conservative"" (no nanny state dictating how individuals spend their own money) to describe it. Really, the only ideologies that would explicitly disagree with the arguments I'm putting forward are ultra-authoritarian ones, which are universally horrific enough not to be seriously considered as a valid alternative by most people anyways.   And physically modifying to select for certain kinds of beauty will create even more pressure and competition. This is not good.   Two things. Firstly, this is not necessarily a matter of ""good"" or ""bad"". It's a matter of ""realistic"" or ""delusional"". By that, I mean that as long as people are free to choose their own mates, they will generally opt to choose more desirable mates, which will itself always translate to competitive pressures of some sort or another. You could apply this principle well beyond beauty, as well; as long as some people are stronger than others, people will be hitting the gym and taking steroids to even the playing field. As long as some people are more intelligent than others, people will be trying to educate themselves, or fundamentally boost their IQ score, in whatever way they can. In a prior post, I mentioned that ""dating is an arms race"". In fact, that was only part of the story; life itself is an arms race. As long as there are 2 or more sentient beings in existence, there will inherently be some degree of competition between them as they jockey for power over each other, either to safeguard themselves or impose their will upon others (or both).  Secondly, regarding your claim that competition is ""not good,"" I'm not entirely convinced of that. Competition is a ubiquitous reality, and it often compels people to improve themselves or their lot in life. It can be a very powerful motivator to do better, and to become a fundamentally better person (behaviourally, physically, whatever). So, it certainly has its pros and cons, but either way, it is here to stay and many people would benefit by understanding it and acting accordingly. If everyone is attractive, statistically speaking that would make everyone more likely to date or marry an attractive person as well - so wouldn't that be a net positive for most people?   I thought transhumanism was about taking control of our own evolution...so now when we're talking about rejecting fucked up aesthetic prejudice we suddenly just have to accept it?   You don't have to ""accept"" anything; aesthetic privilege will continue existing whether you ""believe"" in it or not. Secondly, you are the one talking about ""rejecting ... aesthetic prejudice"". I'm merely pointing out what we know about it, scientifically speaking, and outlining ways that people can improve themselves to make the most of it.   Why not focus on getting rid of the aesthetic prejudice throughout society by a combination of socialization and modifications?   Firstly, how on Earth do you propose to ""socialize"" people to stop noticing their differences? As long as people are not uniformly identicaly, there will be differences between them; and as long as there are differences between them, people will be able to recognize those differences and formulate preferences about them. In terms of ""modifications,"" what exactly are you suggesting? Some kind of implant that makes it impossible for people to recognize or pass judgement on the physical appearance of any other living creature? Sounds pretty dystopian, not to mention completely irrational.   Why should we devalue people based on looks when that idea is ridiculously archaic?   Because it isn't ""archaic"". If you want healthy children, you are going to prefer a healthy mate who will pass on good genes. Physical attractiveness is the easiest, quickest way to judge whether someone has healthy genes or diseased genes. It's a huge tell, and people employ it every day all over the globe in their effort to screen out unfit potential partners. Every time a child is born without a serious genetic disease, you can thank this screening process. Needless to say, there is absolutely nothing ""archaic"" about it.   I don't care if it exists.   At this point, it wouldn't surprise me if you didn't care that gravity existed either. In either case, your opinion is irrelevant; it does exist and will continue to exist, for rational, demonstrable reasons. You are mistaking your own wishful thinking and political dogmas for coherent, rational arguments - which they are not.   Those listed qualities are pretty loose guidelines. Additionally they're not objective,   The question is ""what characteristics do human beings usually regard as sexually attractive?"" and the answer is... All of the aforementioned qualities. They are objective insofar as they can be reliably detected across widely varying cultures and historical periods. If you're talking about forcibly transforming all of humanity into some kind of asexual life form that is physically unable to recognize differences in itself (and it sounds as though you are), that's a whole other question to address.   No. Viewing people as ugly is the problem.    Perhaps your argument would be better served by elaborating on what, precisely, you intend to do about this ""problem"" of ""viewing people as ugly"" in the future. How do you picture transhumanism making people either unable or unwilling to recognize differences between people, and subsequently making a judgement about which they might prefer?   Those people suffer not because they're ugly but because people are aesthetically prejudiced.    Back to biology: your mind is an elaborate pattern recognition machine. It learns to recognize patterns and make huge numbers of subconscious judgements based upon what it has learned. Looking at one person and recognizing them as ""ugly"" and seeing another and regarding them as ""attractive"" is merely your mind translating patterns (good genes/bad genes, health/injury, etc) into action to help you reproduce successfully (read: healthy offspring). You can call that  act ""prejudice"" all you like, but it's a perfectly natural, and even rational, process to help you navigate your way through life. There is nothing inherently immoral or unethical about it; it's just plain smart.   Stop victim blaming.   Hahahaha. Climb down from your cross, Jesus. If somebody doesn't find you attractive, you are not being ""victimized' by them. People don't owe you anything vis-a-vis finding you attractive or unattractive - nor do you owe them anything. You don't owe the ugliest person you know a date, nor does the most beautiful person you know owe you a date. This is a situation where people all over the world are making rational decisions about who to shack up with - you can either understand it and act to improve your situation, or bury your head in the sand and pretend that it somehow doesn't apply to you. Your call."
Transhuman,1re8q7,wootup,1 point,Fri Nov 29 04:44:02 2013 UTC,"Because you can't seem to understand that technology is not neutral,    I have not stated that technology is ""neutral"" anywhere in this thread. My arguments themselves do not imply such an argument either.   You don't seem to understand that technologies have and will continue to be employed for racist, classist, and sexist means    Sure I do; I've clearly acknowledged the potential for this in a prior response. What you don't seem to understand, or acknowledge, is that as long as people are capable of rational thought, they will deploy technology to improve their situation. If that involves making themselves stronger, or more attractive, or smarter, that is entirely their prerogative; not yours. What business it is of yours if I want to change my skin tone? Who elected you genetic overlord of Earth?   It is ridiculously utopian to blindly accept any modifications that take place.   I am not advocating ""blindly"" accepting ""any modifications that take place"". I am suggesting that elementary transhumanist modifications, like swapping diseased genes for healthy genes, or people voluntarily making aesthetic changes to themselves, would be a net positive for both those individuals and for society as a whole, or - at worst - generally benign.   Anarchist could potentially fit, but regarding socialist, in the conversation we have had you have yet to discuss distributive efforts by the state.   Essential health care in my country, like in the vast majority of industrialized countries, is publicly funded, so I generally presume this in these conversations.   Either people agree with you or they're necessarily authoritarian....lol wut.    In this case, yes. For this particular discussion, there are two possible outcomes, which are not compatible with eachother. Either...   Individuals are free to receive whatever personal aesthetic  modifications, including gene therapies, which they desire. Or... Individuals are not permitted to receive whatever personal aesthetic modifications, including gene therapies, which they desire.   I am arguing for point 1, on the assumption that individuals generally know what they themselves want in life better than others do, and on the assumption that implementing an authoritarian regime which dictates what individuals can or can not do to their own bodies would be morally dubious, politically dangerous, and intellectually devoid of justification.  You are arguing for point 2, apparently on the assumption that you know better than everybody else what they ought to do with their own bodies. You are justifying forcing these assumptions on to others under the auspices of ""anti-oppression"" politics.  Are there transhumanist modifications which ought to be rationally resisted because they pose a significant threat to other people? Perhaps, but basic aesthetic modifications don't.   My original post was rejecting the statement from that article and its latent aesthetic prejudice. I even justified it by demonstrating examples in the past and status quo where beautification happened under racist pressures. You have yet to negate any of these points, in fact you've admitted they may be a factor.   Yes, they may be a factor. So what? As I said, individuals can competently choose their own paths on this issue; they don't need you to dictate their desires or destinies to them. Furthermore, as we've already established, the widely-accepted beauty standards which human beings employ in their daily lives are consistent through geographic regions and historical periods, meaning they are found across variant genetic/""racial"" groupings. Ascribing ""racism!"" to this issue, then, rings rather hollow.   Stop being fatalistic about aesthetic prejudice. If you believe in modifications and in lifting the human species, don't accept such an animalistic premise.   We are animals. As long as we are ""alive"" in any way, we will continue to be animals. Transhumanism could improve our minds, our senses, our bodies, our networking abilities, and so on - but as long as we are alive, we are animals. It's absurd to pretend otherwise.   We don't have to be this way, we only are because some biological factors and a whole lot of social ones.   Yes, but you haven't presented a coherent argument as to why beauty is an inherently negative thing. To begin with, from a subjective point of view, I personally love being able to notice how beautiful my girlfriend is; it's one of the most rewarding and enjoyable parts of the human experience. On a personal level, vis-a-vis transhumanism, I would very much like to use emerging technologies to improve myself (and my aesthetic appearance) as an individual. I see no moral, political, or intellectual problem with doing so - quite the opposite, in fact, considering the many aforementioned benefits of beauty."
Transhuman,1re8q7,wootup,2,Fri Nov 29 07:06:16 2013 UTC,"That is not at all what I said. I said creating hypercompetivity over aesthetics will not be good.   As I mentioned before, life is an arms race. This applies to physical beauty as much as to strength, intelligence, social standing, technological development, and so on. Once more, I remind you: as long as there are 2 or more sentient beings in existence, they will be liable to compete with each other for influence and power, either to protect themselves from potential harm from other sentient beings, or to do harm to other sentient beings themselves. This is how the entire biosphere (including humanity) functions, and how the entire biosphere ever has functioned. As long as there are at least 2 sentient beings, competiton of some kind between life forms will plausibly exist.   It will deeply (even more than now) tie people's self esteem to their physical appearance when that in no way determines their worth.   As we've previously discussed, socially and romantically speaking, physical appearance does very much determine peoples' worth. You yourself conceded that you find some people more attractive than others. Why would you even continue making this argument when it's demonstrably false, and when you yourself concede that, on a very basic level, you don't believe in it either?   As a sentient or even simply living being they have worth and deserve fair, respectable treatment.   Sure, I totally agree that, obviously, people should be entitled to the same legal rights and obligations whether they are attractive or not. Nobody, to my knowledge, is arguing against that fact in this thread.   They do not deserve to be labeled diseased, ugly, or somehow inferior.   ""Diseased"" is a label which we apply to people who are diseased. As long as we are able to recognize what a disease is, we will be able to label people as ""diseased"" (which is generally useful, as diagnosis is the first step towards treatment and - ideally - cure). To live in a world where nobody is labeled ""diseased,"" you would either need to eliminate all disease (a noble goal, imho), or make it so that people are no longer physically able to recognize or diagnose diseases (an idiotic goal, imho). Ditto for ""inferior""; I know people who are intelligent and people who are not; I know people who are physically strong and people who are physically weak. As long as I can recognize those differences, I'll be capable of recognizing if someone is physically superior or inferior relative to another person. It would be nice if everyone could be strong, intelligent, and so on (and that's largely the potential of transhumanism), but they aren't. Differences exist, and learning to recognize differences is a fundamental social and biological skill.   Education, changing media representations, conversing, counselling, exposure, changing self esteem, calling out prejudice, increasing oxytocin, and other gradual methods would help.   For curiosity's sake, could you do me a favour and locate 1 example in which these methods were employed to successfully change the aforementioned universal beauty standards that people employ in mate selection? To jog your memory, those strandards were:   Males tend to seek out female mates who possess youth, clear skin, a symmetrical face and body, feminine facial features, [and] an hourglass figure ... those [features] indicating that a woman would be a healthy, fertile candidate to pass on a man's genes. Females tend to prefer men who are taller than they are, with symmetrical features (a sign that a potential partner is healthy and parasite-free). But, women across cultures are [also] intent on finding male partners with high status, power, and access to resources—which means a really short guy can add maybe a foot to his height with a private jet.   Just 1 successful example would be good enough to at least provide me with something concrete to look at and consider more thoroughly. Thank you.   Lol. Aesthetic prejudice is rational?   For mate selection, yes. You can find identical results in the way just about any other animal species selects mates. There are winners and losers, with the end goal being healthy offspring, social safety, access to resources, etc. You find certain people unattractive for a reason, as everyone does. Prescribing outraged leftist morals on to this situation as if there's anything unethical about it is like prescribing outraged leftist morals to the sight of a hawk swooping down and eating a mouse - it's certainly unpleasant, but nature doesn't care about your politics. Reality matters. Opinions don't.   It harms thousands of people directly and indirectly.   Let's be honest here... I'm sure in my life I've been shot down plenty of times because I wasn't attractive/witty/wealthy enough. Whatever. I've done the same to plenty of other people. Romantically speaking, I don't owe them anything, and they don't owe me anything. Successfully getting into a relationship with someone invariably involves two people putting their best feet forward and attracting each other. When it happens, it's one of the best things life has to offer; when it doesn't, you ideally figure out what you did wrong, try to correct it, and move on as best you can. When it comes to the economic, social, and romantic penalties that we all suffer from due to our aesthetic faults, whatever they may be, the most rational response is to correct those faults, not to try and socially engineer billions of years of evolution out of our entire species in some Quixotic quest to do away with competition (which, again, is liable to exist in some form or another as long as there are 2 or more sentient beings in existence)   You are the dogmatic libertarian here.   I'm not a ""libertarian"" in the sense of the word that you're using, and I'm certainly not dogmatic. On account of my not-so-dogmatic-ness, I am often reluctant to prescribe a political label to myself, but if I had to, I'd say I'm an anarchist with strong influences of classical American (small l) liberalism and Enlightenment thinking, among countless others. Make of that what you will; the important thing is my arguments themselves, which are very much sound on this issue.   Just because I point out a problematic ideology or criticize a policy does not mean I have to instantly have a solution.    Agreed, you aren't proposing a coherent solution for peoples' aesthetic problems at all. I am (self-improvement, if they so choose).   Creating an ontological category and valuing/judging people based on that is a socially derived prejudice.   It's quite a remarkable coincidence that virtually every species of animal which reproduces through male-female intercourse has created such ""socially derived prejudice[s]""... Don't you think? Almost makes one wonder about whether they are ""socially derived"" at all. Since you obviously subscribe to the ""blank slate"" theory of human behaviour, since you're highly focused on identity politics at the expense of reason, and since you seem to have almost no scientific education whatsoever insofar as I can tell, I'm going to take a wide guess and assume that you were a liberal arts major (for the record, I was too). If that's the case, and pertaining to your own academic blind spots, I highly recommend beefing up your scientific credentials, preferably with readings centered in biology and/or evolutionary psychology. You will undoubtedly benefit from the experience.   Wtf is with you and ridiculous dichotomies? First creating an ontological category of ""ugly"" is very different than simply finding someone attractive or not.   You previously conceded that, like every other human being alive, you recognize some people as attractive and others as not. Why do you think that disctinction exists in your mind? Whether you use the word ""ugly"" or ""unattractive"" or ""aesthetically impaired"" or something else, we're talking about the same concept and it has the same functional use. I mean, how exactly do you propose, psychologically speaking, to find someone unattactive without simultaneously creating a category for unattractive people? Your mind is a pattern-recognizing machine. Attractive is a pattern. Unattractive is another pattern. Do you see how this works?   Especially when it was compared to a fucking disease.   A lot of diseases are clearly visible, and people consistently prefer non-diseased partners when selecting mates. There are exceptions and outliers, of course, but this principle is so well-documented as to be virtually undeniable by this point in time. A lot of aesthetic problems result from diseased genes - for an obvious example, consider people with congenital defects which prevented their limbs from developing properly. I would hazard a guess that most people with those deformities have a tougher time attracting desirable mates than most people without them do. Does that mean those people should be mistreated, or denied rights? Of course not. It merely acknowledges that romantic selection is a competitive process, and that having a visible genetic disease like that has a statistically measurable negative impact upon one's odds of attracting a desirable mate. Those odds could be improved by developing a process to correct those genetic diseases. And before you launch into more emotional attacks related to what a supposed meanie I am for saying all this, I'll note that I have a few bum genes myself and at least 1 of them is quite noticeable. C'est la vie, you fix what you can and move on regardless.   Second you once again made fantastical leaps of logic by assuming I think everyone has a burden to date those they don't find attractive...wtf have you been smoking?   You're suggesting that discriminatory mate selection is somehow unethical. It naturally follows that an ""ethical"" alternative would be non-discriminatory mate selection, no?"

Certainly changing my appearance would change the way people interact with me, but that's true for many aspects of social presentation, not just bodies.  More importantly, I know that a lot of people outright reject the bodies they were given at birth and/or the social classifications (like gender) that they've been subject to as the result of those bodies. And it seems sort of... insulting, in a way, to imply that these people are rejecting a fundamental part of themselves by changing their bodies.  but I do agree that the mindset that ""we need to make all girls pretty"" (where ""pretty"" is a specific body shape) is really messed up, especially in the context of the original link, where ""ugliness"" is looked at as a flaw to be systemically removed from humanity."

Transhuman,1re8q7,ryeguy146,1 point,Mon Nov 25 23:22:30 2013 UTC,Do I think that tattoos modify the body consequently changing their identity and being? Yes. Do I think tattoos are the same as cosmetic modifications for the specific purpose of making all girls pretty? No.
Transhuman,1re8q7,omjvivi,2,Tue Nov 26 06:36:29 2013 UTC,"Then I'm having a real hard time understanding your reasoning. What is it that makes one okay, but not the other? Explicitly, what is it? I recognize that it can be difficult to state outright, but we're dancing around saying nothing at the moment. Let me state my position outright, and perhaps you'll favour me with yours:  I do not believe that self modification is wrong. I do not believe that the social pressures are sufficiently focused (subjective to my experience and understanding, obviously) to cause a convergence of appearances. I wholly recognize that such a system is ripe for misuse. Yes, some people will make themselves out to be a living barbie doll at the behest of another. Some establishments will have policies that require people look like clones, or a certain way. But that's all sounding like the present! That's right, those problems already exist (examples: 1, 2). The question becomes, will the ability to freely alter your own appearance exacerbate these problems to the point where the added freedom isn't worth it. Obviously, I fall on the side that suggests that the freedom is worth it."
Transhuman,1re8q7,ryeguy146,1 point,Mon Nov 25 22:54:05 2013 UTC,"I too do not oppose the freedom to modify oneself. I am simply against the idea that ugliness (there is no singular ugliness, just subjective ideals) is some bad quality we should eradicate, or that all girls (sooo androcentric) should become 'pretty'.   Yes, those prejudiced ideologies exist in the status quo. I just think the more fundamental the changes (a la the body) the more prejudice can exert control.  Let me put it this way, for several hundred thousand years humans were largely without technology. Eventually we discovered/created pigments, these were used for great things like art and whatnot, but also as makeup. This then became wrapped up with sexism, holding women against particular ideas of beauty, and covering them up if they resisted. Later we developed the scalpel and antibiotics, this allowed for cosmetic surgery. Then bam, women have even more pressure to appear beautiful. Even later we've developed photoshop and start digitally altering the appearances of women in media, this has exerted huge huge pressure on women towards particular ideals of beauty. (This isn't to say makeup or cosmetic surgery can't make women or men feel better about themselves, or even allow for creative outlets. But it begs the question, why do they feel bad about themselves in the first place?)  So...Why wouldn't extremely fundamental changes on a bodily level (beyond crude cuts and Botox injections) continue to reflect sexist or racist ideals?   Again we see in the status quo these problems with blepharoplasty and skin bleaching."
Transhuman,1re8q7,omjvivi,1 point,Tue Nov 26 06:27:33 2013 UTC,"Firstly, let me state that I'm not concerning my discussion on either men or women, but humanity responding to social pressures. Similarly, I agree that there is no singular ugliness, and that it is subjective. So too do we agree on the fact that these pressures already exist. Such a multitude of examples exist that I doubt many believe that the pressures are imaginary.  I think that point of division is how we expect humanity to be affected by that pressure, given enabling technologies. The question, as I see it, becomes a historic one: did the advent of the technologies that you listed increase the human response to social pressures. For example, did the introduction of makeup diminish woman's lot in life? Were people better off before wigs were invented?"

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. If I want to transform myself into an octopus or a slug or a spaceship, that's real transhumanism. Not this blond hair blue eye, perfect height, slim bodies kind of bullshit. That should of course be allowed as well, if that's what you really want, but it's kind of obvious that this is not really a view you arrived on after deep introspection but is in fact likely to be just you parroting the mainstream poplook, the look the majority wants because it is culturally enforced and perpetuated through indoctrination. People are allowed to make themselves look pretty, but before that we need to learn that what pretty is, should not be a norm upheld by some majority, but should instead be something deeply personal, a look you prefer because you thought about it."

I think it would be great.” - Watson  Geneticist Steve Jones dismisses Watson's comments about beauty as ""daft"". ""The concept of beauty is a subjective one,""   To which the author responds; This claim flies in the face of everyday experience. Why do pretty girls get elected home coming queens in high school? Why is there little controversy over who the top contenders are? Why do certain TV and movie stars become the predictable heartthrobs of millions all over the world?  To which I say; Why? It's obvious. Because the slim and tall blond hair blue eyed pageant princess look is the kind of pretty that's currently in fashion and the one our culture reinforces by stuffing every channel capable of carrying pictures with it. This creates a self reinforcing feedback loop that is almost impossible to break. The image is literally sold wholesale. The same happens for men, currently the preferred look lies somewhere between the warrior barbarian & the japanese metrosexual stereotype, rough but clean and muscular with broad shoulders and a prominent jaw. Every boy or girl that doesn't look like that already feels somewhat inadequate and will either consciously or subconsciously try to conform to this ideal to increase their chances with the other sex. If they get the option to conform, our current culture would question why they choose to be ""ugly"" and not look like everyone else. It would turn up the pressure to fall in line even more.  We should try to get away from that and encourage greater diversity, not greater conformity. We'll never get to real transhumanism if we keep attributing so much importance to superficial features, especially not if we are going to start enforcing an even more rigid model of what a human should look like and make everyone ""pretty"".

Once you have a way in which you can improve our children, no one can stop it. It would be stupid not to use it because someone else will. Those parents who enhance their children, then their children are going to be the ones who dominate the world.” Genes that influence beauty could also be engineered. “People say it would be terrible if we made all girls pretty. I think it would be great.”   Basically, we're talking advantages. If you could be born, genetically engineered, to be a genius that looks like a movie star, in fact better than any movie star there was and can maintain it because you have neoteny from Asian genes... there would be a huge disparity in advantage for you over others. At that point stupidity and not being gorgeous is effectively also a disadvantage."
Transhuman,1re8q7,ShrimpCrackers,1 point,Thu Nov 28 04:00:49 2013 UTC,"I see two main problems with this argument. First, if everyone were to be on a level playing field in terms of intelligence and beauty, then the the bell curve would shift to adjust. If 90 were to become the new ""minimum"" IQ, for example, then people with an IQ of 90 would be treated as mentally handicapped. The same process would apply no matter how high yo raised the minimum. Since you can never make everyone completely equal, there would be no way to stop the subjugation and discrimination against people who had less.  The second problem with your argument lies in the assumption that these ""cures"" would be available for the stupid, ugly and poor. As these technologies that make us more beautiful and intelligent become available, it is the already rich, intelligent, beautiful people who will have access to them, furthering the divide between the classes, not closing it."
Transhuman,1re8q7,EnderFame,3,Thu Nov 28 04:26:57 2013 UTC,I don't disagree with what you're saying at all. There will always be these disparities.
Transhuman,1re8q7,ShrimpCrackers,4,Mon Dec 2 03:12:42 2013 UTC,"Right, so if you agree these disparities will always exist, and you understand ""pretty"" and ""smart"" to be subjective, rather than objective terms, you realize that trying to close this gap actually does nothing, but change the values on the x-axis of the bell curve. Making ""all girls pretty"" or ""everyone smart"" is pedantic at best, and impossible at worst."
Transhuman,1re8q7,EnderFame,6,Mon Dec 2 05:45:11 2013 UTC,"How subjective is intelligence, really? I recognize that any scale that we can measure it with will be contested and won't be perfect, but intelligence, as a concept, seems to lend its self to a linear gradient. Were we to build a perfect test, wouldn't it be better to score higher (assuming that higher is more intelligence) than lower? Surely we can differentiate between a mind that cannot comprehend addition from a mind that grasps more advanced concepts, and surely we can say that one is more desirable than the other for an individual."
Transhuman,1re8q7,ryeguy146,0,Mon Nov 25 08:22:58 2013 UTC,"There probably isn't a singular form of intelligence. That makes it difficult to make a linear scale and say ""more intelligent"" and ""less intelligent""  We still don't fully understand our own brains."
Transhuman,1re8q7,omjvivi,1 point,Mon Nov 25 11:21:07 2013 UTC,"Perhaps we can add some constraints until it is linear. I don't think that it will be overly difficult. I speak of the intelligence that enables an individual to thrive in their environment, above and beyond any physical endowments. We can argue what traits contribute, and to what degree, but it allows for that gradient. We can make some general observations, as well. If you retain some trait that restricts your ability to learn, dyslexia for example, it can be seen as negative. That's not to say that the individual that possesses this trait cannot transcend, only that the trait was less than useful to the individual's success."

So are you claiming that education systems wouldn't need to be altered? Innovation would remain at exactly the pace it's at? A society that is, even ""subjectively smarter"" wouldn't appear any different?  Pretty sure there would be some noticeable effects. Also, just because something is hard to pin down exactly, doesn't mean it's not objective. Is poisonous-ness (sp?) subjective? We can't say exactly what is poison, only in reference to our health. But health is even sorta slippery. There are things that are objectively more or less healthy though.  Sure, there's different types of smarts. But we're not all equal on this field. There might be reason to ignore small differences, or promote a variation across society in the ""types of smart"" but there is objectively dumber/smarter people then others even if it's hard to pin down.

You have only to look at the history of fashion and beauty standards to understand how shifting and socially determined those standards are. Beauty, for the most part, is ""what is currently unobtainable"". Consider the relative taste for pale vs tanned skin in places where poor people labour indoors or out of doors.  So what's more likely to happen is waves of generations of look-fads, each one becoming passé as it comes of age. Everyone looks like a neotonous Asian movie star? Dark skin that ages gracefully will become the dream, or some other thing that a small % of the population has. (I'm optimistically pretending racism doesn't exist in this future—that's wrong. It will, which will complicate this.)  Notice that the author is excited about pretty girls but not pretty boys. A hilarious oversight given e.g. the correlation between CEO height and pay. It's a nice illustration of the problem that what people think is best for their children is not necessarily what is actually best. The baby industry would be swamped with pseudo-science and snake oil.  Maybe in the future they can engineer for more empathy."

Even if there are some things that a lot of people in a society tend to find attractive. What is considered ""beautiful"" fluctuates from society to society and is a changing cultural construct that can be seen shifting over time. And is hardly something that isn't considered very controversial.  Hardly any two people experience sexuality or aesthetics in the exact same way. There are a lot of similarities between people, but also a lot of variation.  The link in question makes a terrible argument for beauty being anything other than subjective.

Then we can genetically engineer to fit that new standard, only for the culture to shift further, and so on and so forth, until what is culturally perceived as beautiful is a monstrous inhuman creature that is 9 feet tall with 6 legs and 4 arms.

Or is it citizens buying these modifications for their future children? If people are paying out of pocket, then you run a major risk of only the rich being able to afford to look beautiful, and only the poor unmodified look ugly.

Also there are much classier ways to phrase your appreciation for beauty if that's what you're after.  Let me try to explain why this was sexist:   It objectified the speaker. She was talking about interesting transumanist issues and your comment shifts the discussion toward her physical appearance which is completely irrelevant to her topic. More than that it de-empowers her and takes away from her points. It's like saying ""enough about whatever she was talking about, lets talk how I personally feel about her body"". The colloquial usage of the phrase ""I'd hit that"" is typically used as a response to a negative comment about someone's appearance as in ""I'd still hit that, despite XYZ"" which I probably don't have to tell you is super inappropriate in this context. Maybe you didn't mean it that way but the subtext is still there.   And if you still don't think it is sexist, please consider these other reasons why it was inappropriate:   No one cares No one asked No one needed to know No one is better off knowing Nothing was gained by you saying this It was off topic and irrelevant It derailed the thread You comment made at least one person in the thread uncomfortable"

He is widely regarded as a pioneer in personal genomics and synthetic biology so you can be sure he knows what he's talking about. In regenesis he specifically talks about the future of our species in relation to developments in both genomics and synthetic biology and covers pretty much all your questions.   At the moment we already have and utilize the ability to alter the DNA of embryos so we are already steering evolution. Right now this is mostly used to get rid of inherited genetic disorders but in principle it could be used to get rid all sorts of things as well. Embryonic selection allows doctors, not many are willing, to select for other biological traits (sex and eye color for example). If you are looking for crazy sci-fi tech that already exists, you might want to check out Craig Venter's work. He's just built a biological teleporter that can extract and read the DNA from any cell and then send it to another unit that can print the DNA. A few years back he created the first synthethic lifeform by inserting DNA he constructed from scratch into an empty cell and then booting it so now he hopes to develop a biological teleporter 2.0 that can not only print DNA but entire cells. You could order liver cells from a patient on the other side of the world!    If your film is hoping to explore the genetic engineering of adults than you are lucky because in the last few weeks we've seen some amazing research that will one day no doubt come in handy for that. For now we've been using viral vectors in gene therapy to alter the DNA of fully grown beings but mostly in specific regions (targetting cancer/ bone marrow which produces immune cells which allows you to reengineer the immune system) but you might also want to check up on the CRISPR technique which allows for extremely precise engineering and you should definitely look up how scientists at Yale and MIT managed to recode an entire organism  I don't think the general population will need to learn anything. We don't know how planes work but we still trust our life to them, we don't know how pacemakers work but we allow doctors to cut ourselves open. I imagine that one day you can order new eyes that allow you to see a much bigger part of the EM spectrum at your local robot surgeon and you'll have no idea how they make those but you'll still marvel at the beauty of the cosmic rays streaming across the night sky.  I'm not looking for anything too radical, those eyes certainly sound interesting, perhaps some tentacles and the ability to fly? :p Shapeshifting would be nice too but that's not really something we can just copy from nature.

Transhuman,1quvgr,Tristanna,1 point,Mon Nov 18 03:49:06 2013 UTC,"The hurdles today right now, I massive. When we sequenced the human genome over a decade ago it was put forth as though this act would be the gateway to end disease. What did we discover? The fucking epigenome which threw a big ass wrench into the dream. So step one, understanding the epigenome and to no lesser extent, the protiome. Once you understand the highly complex network of interactions betwixt those three systems (barring) any other shit popping up, then you can start talking about modifying the human gene line in a meaningful sense. Snipping out a gene and replacing it is very similar (logically speaking) to altering lines in a computer program. When you have a massive computer program like say an operating system and if you change something as minuscule as a line of code 999 times out of 1000 you some unexpected shit happens and the functions work differently than intended. This certainly appears to be roughly the same situation when you start fucking around with genetics.   To some extents we have already hacked gene lines and changed up some species DNA, for example look at all the GMO crops making the news. There have even been successful experiments in using genetic modification to get goats to produce spider silk.  As far as changes to society, firstly I would say the elimination of genetic disorder from the gene pool. Secondly, if there is a gene corresponding to greater intelligence, that too. Now is where it gets really murky, suppose traits like aggression can be linked to genetics, do we curb that and raise a generation of pacifists? This would obviously be very good for a people with no threat of attack from outside, but that is not the world as it exists. Another thing society will have to deal with is what I think is the single greatest social issue for genetic modification, Is a parent morally obligated to genetically engineer their child (assuming of course that this can be done safely and effectively)? This is a powerful question, because if you answer no, then you are effectively saying that it is socially acceptable for a parent to allow their child to be born with any of a multitude of serious diseases and defects that could have been prevented. If you answer yes then you are effectively saying that the parent does not have sole power when it comes to caring for their children. Now to me the answer here is obvious, but not all, in fact many would not agree with me. But nonetheless it is a question that must be answered."

Transhuman,1qr8nd,Newfur,3,Sun Nov 17 02:25:26 2013 UTC,"Using the word ""emergent"" doesn't tell you exactly what way the parts interact to give rise to the property in question. Many things are emergent other than consciousness. Wiki gives the example of the geometry of snowflakes. The shape of the snow flake (divisible by six, radially symmetric) is an emergent property of the chemical properties of water, that are not specifically the shapes created when frozen.  Calling consciousness emergent doesn't tell you the mechanism by which neurons (or matter in general, for that matter) produce consciousness, but rather that consciousness is a phenomenon that somehow occurs within certain configurations of matter, without being a fundamental property of that matter. A single neuron isn't conscious. A small enough cluster of neurons (more than one, less than a full human brain) communicating with each other also do not have the property of consciousness.   However, there is a certain threshold of enough neurons linked together in the right ways, each acting in the right ways, at which we observe consciousness. This is something that we know without knowing why those neurons produce consciousness.  If we understand the brain as being purely a function of neurons firing or not firing, then one could presumably build a binary analog of the brain out of physical switches inside a computer. If the only reason human brains have consciousness is the configuration of connections and firing or not firing, then this analog model should also be conscious.  Following this, we could presumably have enough people send ""on"" and ""off"" messages to each other in a configuration identical to that of the neurons in a functioning human brain. If the above is correct, then this group of people would have a consciousness that none of the members of the group have.  This all follows without introducing the idea of ""magic."" However, to be fair, if magic is merely that which we can use without understanding, then consciousness is indeed magical.  The terms ""emergent"" and ""magical"" do tell us things about consciousness. The former tells us that consciousness is not a property of any one part of the brain, but rather only the interactions of the parts of the brain. To call consciousness ""magical"" is to say that we do not know how these interactions cause consciousness.  Therefore, given the above definition of ""magical,"" and this mechanistic view of the brain, consciousness is both emergent and magical, though it will lose its magic if the way in which neurons interact to create consciousness is understood."

That's vague, since we don't know much about the details, but ""magical"" could also mean that the neurons are made of special matter that's inherently conscious, or that God notices the collection of neurons and puts a soul in it. Saying ""emergent"" disclaims supernatural fake-explanations like those.  EDIT: nethodsod explains my point in more detail."

With ""Because consciousness emerges from neurons interacting"", we don't have answers for the follow-up questions yet, but we know that they need asking and we have some idea of where to look (at the interactions between neurons, not at the fact that they're small and made of meat, or at the amygdala in isolation from the rest of the brain, or on Mount Olympus for the god who's imbuing brains with consciousness).

Eventually, when the biological brain dies, the artificial one is what remains.  Edit: clarification now that I'm on my computer. Imagine a high speed connection with some kind of artificial brain. The artificial brain will eventually become part of your consciousness. Assuming that the artificial brain gets more powerful with time, and you use it more and more, eventually most of your consciousness is ""in"" the artificial brain rather than the biological one, so when the biological one dies, what you lose is not significant to the point that ""it's not you anymore""."

As for consciousness you could simply ask the copy if it was experiencing consciousness. A mind created from scratch could be confused about such a thing and answer positively without actually experiencing consciousness, but since this thing is based on a human I don't think it would. When a human is asked about consciousness, consciousness itself affects the answer. Thus if it's not there the answer should be different. What you could not know is that the consciousness is the same. Perhaps a digital person would have a worse or just different kind of consciousness, and it would probably never realise and would still say it had consciousness.

I have met Stephen Wolfram. In fact, I worked with him for several years. I will say this: he is a driven, passionate man, with a very large, very elaborate vision. He is also incredibly short-tempered and very impatient. I watched him yell at interns on their first day. I watched him threaten people in the middle of company meetings. I personally received phone calls from him in the middle of the night freaking out about projects. If you can tolerate the inner two-year-old that drives his psyche, there's a brilliant person there, but he has very little empathy for others (particularly ""underlings""), and he did not forgive people for wasting his time.  Yet, he is still a person. He loves his children. When I worked there, during the occasional office visits, sometimes some of his kids came with him, and you could tell he cared deeply about them. I hear even now that some of his kids are involved in projects there.  I will not defend him or say he is misunderstood. I respected him when I worked there, but it would be dishonest to claim he can not be an pushy son of a bitch. He has pushed several people out of that company over the years (and I wouldn't be surprised at all if I heard the turnover was still insane).   I don't know if I would go so far to convict him of criminal arrogance, but I will say he is incredibly grandiose.  I've said my peace. Do with it what you will.

You mean the physical plague that builds up between our neurons? Not an issue for a digital brain. What do you mean by ""aren't exactly mentally competent?"" IQ? EQ? These are a bit more complex to address as these measures are are part of a larger system of interacting portions of the brain. However, ""fixing"" these detriments could be as simple as changing out your hard drive for more storage space. Want better hand-eye coordination? Well there's an implant for your parietal lobe.

Transhuman,1qdntu,thelespaulguy,13,Mon Nov 11 15:09:05 2013 UTC,"Here's my take on this. Individuality is an illusion to begin with. Your ego is defined solely by the contents of your mind and not which particular carrier the content is stored in. To demonstrate this let's do a little thought experiment.  Say we have 10 computers with 10 identical emulated minds, having 10 identical experiences. Say these computers are rigged so that if 1 of them is destroyed or manipulated in any way, they are all destroyed. Now ask yourself, exactly how does it matter which particular computer you are? The distinction is obviously meaningless!   However, what if we have a similar setup but these 10 identical minds are given different stimuli, resulting in different experiences and, over time, diverging minds. In this case it does matter which one you are, but only because the minds are no longer identical! The contents of the ""mind files"" are now different and as such they no longer carry the same ego.   So, say you do a non-destructive upload. Your minds will instantly diverge and become different people since they will experience different things. But since both minds start with an identical mindfile, neither can claim to be ""original"" or ""copy"". There is simply two of you now. A concept that is hard to wrap your head around because throughout our lives we never experience anything like it. It none the less makes sense if you think about it."

What the question comes down to is a disruption in the stream of consciousness; undoubtedly a copy of you would continue on where you left off, but can you get the original you to experience a 'transferal' to the new brain, or do you just have to let yourself die to be reborn?  I think the technology to backup and copy your brain will come before a way to transfer your consciousness, simply because while we can understand the construction of the physical brain, how the mind is constructed is quite a bit more vague.  The dilemma of whether to copy yourself or to just wait it out for something better is not something I want to deal with, but in the face of death, who knows what you might choose?

Transhuman,1qdntu,DoktorLuciferWong,3,Mon Nov 11 21:42:36 2013 UTC,"Hmm. I think it might be the notion of transference of experience? Like, if you merely duplicate consciousness, you've created a new one, but your current consciousness doesn't experience anything the new consciousness does. So if you want to create a new consciousness, this is fine, but if you want to cheat death/have a cool robot body, moving it is the way to go."
Transhuman,1qdntu,comrade_leviathan,1 point,Tue Nov 12 01:07:33 2013 UTC,"So at the moment of duplication the consciousness becomes two distinct sets of experience. But what if the consciousness isn't divided upon duplication, but rather doubled, like different branches of the same tree? So when a single individual consciousness is copied to create a branching point in that consciousnesses experience the consciousness remains singular. I am uploaded into a computer, my mind remains intact in my body, but also within the computer. The consciousness that was originally just housed in comrade_leviathan is now comrade_leviathan and comrade_leviathan2. We have unique experiences, but we are still one consciousness.  Reductionistic views of consciousness (consciousness can be reduced to data) may satisfy the explanations needed by those of us with a behavioral, materialistic perspective of the universe, but that perspective may not encompass the unquantifiable, quantum elements of existence. The opposite is also possible, though... a reality in which consciousness is not only larger than its data components, but potentially larger than a single substrate or body... a consciousness which can inhabit more than a single human body, or computer, or robot. In either case, however, it seems that uploading a mind into a new substrate like a computer is not only impossible possible, but inevitable."

Depends on what the purpose would be. If you want to sit a cap on my head and read electrical signals for a couple hours, I see no moral problem with it.  Okay, Kirk, Spock and McCoy.  These guys used the transporter A LOT. And we know a bit about what the transporter does.  It maps our molecules (or perhaps it goes deeper then that into our subatomic structure, I am not really the Trekkie I claim to be), then tears all those molecules apart.  Turns them into a beam of energy, focuses that beam on some coordinate, then reasembles.  All within a healthy 3 or 6 seconds or so.  We know that there is a buffer involved.  We also know they can do some sort of processing with the map.  Important parts: Kirk, Spock and McCoy are dissamebled at a molecular level and for some amount of time they exist as nothing but energy.  They are not physical creatures with organs, hair and skin and such.  They are energy and data.  Now here is the thing. No one REALLY knows what consciousness is.  Pretty much we have 2 groups yelling and beating there chests on the subject. The one group, the religious group, says there is this thing called the 'soul'.  They kind of get off on the idea that no one can find or quantify the soul.  The idea that you can't point to the soul on the map of a body is a thing they hold proudly too.  And it is a problem for Kirk, Spock and McCoy.  Cause the other group kind of has a point.  The other group claims that whatever consciousness is, its ingredients are neurons, axioms, cells all clustered in a squishy brain.  We are a sum of recorded past experiences and unique chemicals that that fill up the spongy mass of the brain. Somehow, those things come together and BLAMM! you have consciousness!  Neither side really knows.  But the idea that we are a sum of memories, that emotions are chemicals, this is something that has some simularity in databases and coding.  We know from watching Star Trek that the transporter doesn't seem to hurt them. Are you sure about this?  What if (my first what if), what if, tearing someone apart at the molecular level was the most painful, terrible act any creature could go through.  The most horrific toruture ever concieved.  What if - the act of transporting kept them from forming a memory of this torture? If they were mapped, then pulled apart, then put together again - the map would mean that they would be all kinds of fine.  Even if they were not.  Even if they went through hell to get there.    I have a better question.  A biggee.  What if there is something that is being left out of the equation?  A soul perhaps. What if, the consciousness that is Kirk, Spock and McCoy simply ceased to exist.  Gone, in a horrific tearing of there being.  And what got put back together was something that relied on memories and chemical imbalances to make decisions. What if that thing was a different thing that really wasn't around before being resembled on the planets surface. Would you know?  Can you devise a test to tell the difference?    You want to upload your consciousness to a computer.  That computer is going to have your chemicals, your brain structure, your memories.  Everything is going to be accounted for. That thing is going to argue that it is you. Is it?"

Transhuman,1qdntu,Sharou,3,Tue Nov 12 01:29:23 2013 UTC,"I have two desires that define my existance that many would think are ridiculus base desires. Cuteness, and androgyny. And perhaps, furthermore than that, kindness and harmony.  Those are the only things I can think of central to my identity as a human being. Anything else is extraneous to my identity and my core existance. I expect that is a bizarre and silly sounding existence to those outside my conciousness, but it is my reality nonetheless.  It is because of this I can easily leave my body behind. And can look to eternity with certainty I want to live forever. Though I love my friends and family, they are not so central to my live that I could not live millions of years without them.  As for me and my indentity transferring, I am my conciousness. And any interruption is my death. A clone of my conciousness would me an exact rebirth of me, but not me.  I would be against this kind of death if I could avoid it. I do not thing I have to face that problem, though. As I can just merge with machine and cyberspace. I do not identify with my body, only my mind and its core desires to experience certain things."
Transhuman,1qdntu,CorpusCallosum,4,Tue Nov 12 03:38:26 2013 UTC,"Consciousness is likely generated on a continuous basis, the same in appearance, but always changing in substance, much like the contents of a swift-flowing river, or the flame of a candle. We don't, for instance, lose our sense of identity or think of ourselves as someone new after a long sleep, despite the fact that the consciousness we experience upon waking has been seemingly absent from the universe for the past 6 to 10 hours. I think uploaded copies of personalities, if they truly had consciousness, would identify with the original every bit as strongly as we identify with our past selves upon waking from sleep.  That said, I think consciousness arises in living things largely as a result of their chemical make-up, so if we want to run conscious simulations of ourselves on computers, I believe those computers will need to run on some sort of organic wetware. Even if I'm wrong about consciousness requiring carbon, the conditions necessary for consciousness to arise in non-organic systems would likely be entirely different. I suspect that even if it were possible, getting a non-organic computer to run a conscious simulation would likely prove far more difficult than developing wetware computers that could more handle the task with relative ease. In a sense, such computers might still be ""brains"" or ""animals"" of some sort. So while some envision mind-uploading as a process of inserting our personalities into a computer, I envision it more as a process of selectively rewriting our memories and personality traits onto the brains of more advanced beings, or rather, onto more advanced brains that happen to lack centralized identities of their own. (Or not: Maybe these brains would run their own conscious personality sims in addition to the ones uploaded by their previously human users.) In practice, it might not make much difference. I see no reason, for instance, why you couldn't run multiple conscious personalities in a virtual environment on this kind of brain / wetware computer.  If I am ever given the opportunity to upload copies of my personality, I don't think I'll want to stop at one, nor would I want to completely discard my own physical brain. I would prefer to proliferate, so that my multiple selves could follow their own paths and diversify. This would also provide the advantage of survivability: If the computer your consciousness is running on is physically damaged, it could be fatal, but if you're running simulations of yourself on servers all over the world (or the solar system), it would take a much more severe catastrophe to end your existence. Conceivably, information, including memories since the copies were initially made, could subsequently be shared between selves, possibly even on some sort of rapid relay basis, allowing you to be in many places at once."
Transhuman,1qdntu,ti83nightedition,6,Wed Nov 13 22:44:27 2013 UTC,"I used to think that uploading had to be gradual (i.e. non-destructive) to allow a ""real"" transfer of consciousness instead of a mere cloning of consciousness. After playing with a lot of thought experiments, I no longer hold this view and I think it doesn't matter at all if your brain is destroyed in the process. Like you said in your first paragraph, our consciousness is always changing and has no uniqueness to it that would make ""safe uploading"" better than ""destructive uploading"". This has to do with a notion called the bundle theory of personal identity. Here's a cool article."

Also, if physics is computable -- definitely not a proven thing, but I think many people would be extremely surprised if physics down to the molecular level at least wasn't simulatable, and assuming that that simulatable level of physics is enough to explain a brain -- then a computer could run a simulation of a brain that reacts the same way as a real one, exhibiting emotions too. It's possible that lower-level physical rules that might not be computable come into significant play in the brain, but there's no real evidence to suggest that, besides ""quantum physics is mysterious to us"" and ""brains are mysterious to us"" and ""I want to believe that brains are too mysterious for computers"".  Also, the similar reasoning that ""quantum physics is affected by observers"" has anything to do with sentience, or that that means that sentience must rely on quantum physics because of this, irks me so much.  Where does the common need to believe that computers are necessarily incapable of emotions come from? Because computers are cold metal, which is inhuman? Who knows."

Transhuman,1q3w8l,Sharou,5,Tue Nov 12 02:17:02 2013 UTC,"Where does emotion lie?  While it doesn't have to be meat, I think the basic neural structure and neurotransmitters in organic brains is at least the only way we currently know of to create emotions. We will certainly be able to simulate these and perhaps scale them up, but if symbolic AI (i.e. AI that is not human-like in structure) can experience emotion is unknown. AI that is human-like in structure will have emotion, but will never be ""safe"" any more than any human is ""safe""."
Transhuman,1q3w8l,NULLACCOUNT,1 point,Thu Nov 7 20:05:16 2013 UTC,Emotions come out of data just like the rest of the human mind. If a particular AI ends up having no emotions it won't be because it can't have them.
Transhuman,1q3w8l,Sharou,3,Thu Nov 7 20:27:16 2013 UTC,"I'm not even sure how to respond to that.  I guess the best I can say is ""Output"" is a combination of ""Input"" and a ""Function"". So far the only ""Function"" we know of that can generate emotional ""Output"" is a human brain (probably animal brains too). There very well may be other functions that can, but we don't know that for sure yet."
Transhuman,1q3w8l,NULLACCOUNT,1 point,Thu Nov 7 20:46:02 2013 UTC,Not really vague. It means emotions emerge from the interrelation of information rather than from the substrate upon which the information is manifested.
Transhuman,1q3w8l,Sharou,2,Thu Nov 7 20:47:07 2013 UTC,"I edited to make that a little clearer.  Again, still vague, because while yes, you could say that, the information is not purely encoded in sensory input, but also in the genetic code (and environmental factors) that lead to the organic brain.  A computer could be considered an interrelation of information, but the actual architecture does matter. Of course you can run virtualization software to emulate an architecture, but that was my point, the only architecture we know of that produces emotion is a human brain. It doesn't mean other architectures can't, but it is also a big assumption to assume that they can."
Transhuman,1q3w8l,NULLACCOUNT,1 point,Thu Nov 7 20:56:23 2013 UTC,"Right but that's what people are saying. That if you apply a human architecture upon an inorganic substrate it will somehow lack emotions.  Also, I think it's pretty clear that emotions don't emerge from the entire brain but from specific functions within it. As such I don't see why we couldn't create a brain different from a human brain but which still contained those requisite functions for emotion. Could we create emotion with an altogether different function? That's impossible to know."
Transhuman,1q3w8l,epeen,1 point,Thu Nov 7 21:05:34 2013 UTC,"Right, I pretty much said that in my first comment.  As for where emotions come from, and if they can be isolated from the brain, I don't think we know yet. We know that removing parts of the brain can disable certain functions, but that doesn't mean the entire function is contained within that region."
Transhuman,1q3w8l,Sharou,3,Thu Nov 7 21:42:26 2013 UTC,Emotions come out of data just like the rest of the human mind. If a particular AI ends up having no emotions it won't be because it can't have them.    You've apparently come across some amount of proof that has thus far eluded the scientific community. I thought we were at least a decade away from being able to definitively declare such a thing. Now I'm pretty excited! Consider doing an AMA about your research.

Transhuman,1q3w8l,Capitalist_P-I-G,1 point,Fri Nov 8 00:56:56 2013 UTC,Saying a given AI will not have emotions is not the same as saying AI's can't have emotions.

Transhuman,1q3w8l,AxiomaticBadger,1 point,Fri Nov 8 01:11:49 2013 UTC,No. One is a speculation of a potential AI mind. The other is simply knowledge of what emotion is and how it comes about.

Transhuman,1pze3s,ameinias,5,Wed Nov 6 03:43:00 2013 UTC,"Excellent video, and beautifully produced, but I feel like one of the issues with the ""public"" face of transhumanism isn't that it's particularly far fetched anymore, but it does come off as irresponsible, unsustainable, amoral, and selfish - most of the most discussed topics focus on ideas about making humans as individuals more rad, and while they'll mention the negative effects on society and the earth but don't dig into how making humans better could make the earth better. None of the three branches mentioned in the video approach the aspect of transhumanism that's interested in helping humans evolve in such a way to be able to have a more balanced and effectively harmonious relationship with their environment (technological, natural, and social). While watching the video I was hoping that the Well Being branch would go into it, but I forgot about the elimination of suffering thing.   I'll be following your kickstarter! I see one of your future topics is ""The Matrix or Star Trek"", that sounds like it might get into what I'm talking about.  Star Trek always frustrated me because it always suggested that humans had ""figured out"" resource management & superior harmony with nature and themselves through technology but skimped on the details and dove into space.  PS if anyone is away of any resources or communities interested in holistic/environmentalist/spiritualist aspect transhumanism, let me know! I never learned about it formally in school, I've just reignited my interest in transhumanism from this angle chatting with like minded people in person and haven't found our crew on the net yet.   bla bla"

What you could do with your skill set is to contribute indirectly by working on popularizing longevity research. This will in turn increase funding for actual longevity research and has the potential to make a huge impact. Even if it's not as glamorous and cool as working on solving the actual problem."
Transhuman,1q0dsq,Sharou,3,Wed Nov 6 11:42:06 2013 UTC,"That is definitely a very good idea, and that's sort of what I'm going after right now.

Right now though I'm just trying to build up a group that collectively will have the expertise we need to understand and attempt to tackle digital immortality as well as hopefully turn it into a business."
Transhuman,1q0dsq,faiban,4,Wed Nov 6 22:00:31 2013 UTC,public opinion of longevity research is perhaps the most important thing to influence right now.

By partnering with companies that produce tangible items you can easily make a commercial product that provides some attributes of digital immortality as well as real life products that plays on the heart strings of all humans.   The problem is that you need either lots of cash, or lots of developers willing to work for free. Once you have the resources the rest isn't that hard."

Transhuman,1q0dsq,MemeticParadigm,2,Wed Nov 6 09:30:38 2013 UTC,"Right now I think my project is aiming to be something like a think tank. All I've done so far is research on figuring out how exactly we could go about pursuing digital immortality. I'm not going to pretend my project is very organized, and I don't entirely know what it will end up being, but here are my ideas, and I'm always open to new ideas.  What I have:   A mock-up website (not online) Lots of ideas that I need help shaping More stuff to learn than one person is capable of   What I need:   Help with research/learning (digital immortality is the most interdisciplinary thing I can think of, so any field of study is bound to be relevant). It's too much for one person to learn, but we need to be up to date in all the relevant areas. Help structuring the organization. I have never run a business or anything like it before, and while I've spent some time trying to learn how to do this, there is still a lot I don't know. A website where we can recruit more people. I'm not sure how much we should recruit before we really have any content/ideas/money.   I haven't found an online presence for any kind of digital immortality organization (unless you want to count places like 2045 that state their goals but don't have any information). I want to create an organization/business that in the beginning is somewhat of a one stop resource for digital immortality information and advocacy. Eventually though, I'd like to shift to actual immortality research (as in science stuff) once we figure out what we want to research and attain the funding for it. There is no way one person could have all the expertise needed to create a digital avatar by one's self, and so my personal plan is to have broader and shallower knowledge of all the areas so that I can help direct and oversee the entire project from research to development to funding, you name it. In the beginning I will obviously be playing more active roles, and I imagine my skills will put me into more of an advocacy role. I'd like to make informative and advocacy videos, literature, essays, infographics, art, music, .... The bigger the presence we can create the better.  I hope this gives you enough of an idea of what I'm trying to achieve."
Transhuman,1q0dsq,aweeeezy,7,Wed Nov 6 21:57:47 2013 UTC,"Here's a brief roadmap, it's deceptively simple (relative to the goal in mind, anyways):   Accurately simulate the cerebral cortex. On the one hand, straightforward as it sounds, this goal is effectively synonymous with the creation of strong AI. On the other hand, people like Jeff Hawkins are already working on cortical learning algorithms that have the potential to be exactly what we need. I'm working on a little something of my own here as well, but it's still in the beginning stages as far as actual implementation goes, so I don't like to talk about it much. Use a derivative of this technology to create a brain implant that consists of a net of electrodes layered over the top of the human cortex, with the ability to read electrical impulses from neurons, as well as producing electrical impulses itself to provide ""feedback"" to neurons, so that you have a connected loop. Connect the input/output signal of each electrode to the input/output of a single neuron/node in your simulated cortex, effectively creating/simulating a very thin, non-interconnected layer of cortical tissue that is fully connected to your ""real"" brain and layered over the top of it.  Allow the simulated cortex to ""grow"" new neurons and connections based on mimicking the behavior observed in biological brains. Theoretically, this growth will be driven by electrical impulses from your own brain, and provide feedback to your brain, in exactly the same manner that a new layer of biological neurons growing on top of your current cortex would.   After a time you, as a pattern of thoughts, behaviors, knowledge, motives, perceptions, and paradigms, should exist as much in your own digital cortex as your biological one, although the difference should be mostly imperceptible other than having generally enhanced cognitive abilities. Allowing growth to continue, the majority of your ""being"" should eventually exist within the digital cortex, with the biological cortex primarily serving as an interface with your physical senses. To complete the process, hook an IV to your physical body with a saline/anesthetic solution that is initially weak enough to hardly notice, and slowly increase the potency until your physical body has gone into that deep, anesthetic induced, sleep-of-the-dead unconsciousness. If you lose consciousness, you aren't there yet; if your digital cortex manages to sustain your state of consciousness being despite your physical body being completely unconscious, congratulations, you've successfully virtualized your consciousness.  Lastly, a bit of advice towards your own development: Learn to code. Codecademy.com is great, and it's something you can do for free in your free time to expand your knowledge base/skill-set into domains that will be central to achieving your stated goals. Even if you don't end up writing code for the project personally, having that additional paradigm is invaluable. Behavioral neuroscience is another domain of study that gives a uniquely useful paradigm."
Transhuman,1q0dsq,MemeticParadigm,3,Tue Nov 26 23:56:55 2013 UTC,"Wow, this is very inspiring. I read Jeff Hawins' book ""On Intelligence"" a while ago and I knew that he was running some organization, but I'm happy to hear that's what he's working on.  I do know how to code a little bit. I've written myself some programs in various languages and built some websites. I completely agree with you that even if I'm not directly coding anything on the project, it is still important that I know how to code. Same thing with the neuroscience and other relevant areas. I feel my role right now in organizing and managing this Digital Immortality Organization is to have a broad knowledge to eventually help guide the efforts of people with more specialized knowledge and skills.  It's taken me a while to understand just how one might ultimately transfer consciousness, but you lay it out very nicely here, and like you said, it sounds deceptively simple. I'm going to put a link to your comment in  /r/Digital_Immortality for other people to see."
Transhuman,1q0dsq,aweeeezy,3,Wed Nov 27 00:24:17 2013 UTC,"One more thing I meant to add, you do need lots of relevant knowledge, but don't let your lack of a degree or what anyone says about it make you think that you need one to accomplish these sorts of things. If you immerse yourself in this stuff, and keep driving at new concepts that interest you until you feel like you really understand them at a conceptual ""this is what is happening"" level (as opposed to the ""I've memorized the relevant formula(s)"" level), then the only thing that sucks about not having a degree is that it makes you look bad on paper, so it can be harder to find a job that is related to these fields unless you have good connections.  Also, I added /r/Digital_Immortality to my ""Intelligence"" multireddit. Doesn't look like there's a whole lot there yet, but I'll keep an eye on it.  Oh, one last thing: You're 23 right now, which makes it a fairly important time to make sure you keep learning, particularly in an interdisciplinary fashion, because you have the full cognitive power of your brain at your disposal, but you still have the mental flexibility of a brain in flux for at least a couple more years. The biggest trick to interdisciplinary thinking/learning is to constantly be using analogies to look at one discipline through the lens of another, whether that be trying to conceptualize the brain as basic electronic components, or looking at parts of a song and trying to think about them as parts of a biological lifespan, or a chain of signaling pathways, or different organisms in an ecosystem. Oh, and weed certainly doesn't hurt. In my experience, it seems to make it easier to connect more distantly related ideas, which lends itself well to stimulating interdisciplinary/trans-disciplinary thought patterns.  Sorry if any of that sounded preachy, I'm only 26 myself, but the way I see the world and the way I integrate knowledge from different domains has changed so much in the last 3 years that I felt obligated to offer just a tad of personal advice."
Transhuman,1q0dsq,MemeticParadigm,2,Wed Nov 27 01:07:30 2013 UTC,"I very much appreciate the advice, it always helps to inspired to keep pushing myself as hard as I can and not 'waste' any of my potential. I do plan on and want to learn as much as I possibly can. It's a heck of a lot to learn, and the most interdisciplinary thing I could imagine. I've used Codeacademy before, as well as Coursera, Khan Academy, and MIT Opencourseware. I will try to remember to keep thinking in an interdisciplinary manner using analogies. My view of the world has change very dramatically in the last 3 years, and I eagerly await the future me as I learn more about the our/my existence."
Transhuman,1q0dsq,aweeeezy,1 point,Wed Nov 27 04:17:30 2013 UTC,"I really like your ideas. Part of me wants to think that techniques like this will acquire enough data so a simulation can be devised, but another part of me thinks that only nano-swarms or comparable tech will be capable of mapping the entire state vector of the human brain over an interval of time to see how it develops. After this is possible, wouldn't it need to be replicated in many others so software can be developed to handle the appropriate parameter ranges for every single variable?"
Transhuman,1q0dsq,MemeticParadigm,1 point,Wed Jan 15 21:26:02 2014 UTC,"Well, we only have to simulate an ""empty"" or default cortex, which shouldn't actually depend on having huge amounts of data, since most neural tissue should exhibit information processing characteristics that are relatively homogeneous across any neural tissue where there is an absence of divergent history/environment.   If we can emulate said ""empty"" tissue(i.e. matching the characteristics of freshly generated neurons), and also connect it to the tissue of an individual, unique brain in a manner that perfectly mimics the connection between newly generated neurons and pre-existing neurons, the boundary between physical and virtual neural tissue should largely cease to matter after a time.  By allowing the virtual cortex to grow while inter-connected with the physical cortex in this sort of configuration, we basically have a brain which is just continuing to grow additional neural tissue/cortical depth, except that the additional tissue, having no room in the skull, is actually being projected into a sort of virtual dimension of space."
Transhuman,1q0dsq,chronoflect,1 point,Wed Jan 15 22:23:39 2014 UTC,"Ah, I see. I don't think creating a simulated cortex requires something as all encompassing as nano-swarms in human brains, but I think they would be required to effectively sweep across particular areas of the brain to record certain key data points...data points that are necessary for the collected information that becomes ""you"" to instantiate itself in it's entirety. In other words, I don't see how a BCI that only engages with a fraction of your neurons could possibly get enough data to fully simulate a person. Not being a neurologist, I'm left only with assumptions...could it be that you're saying if an advanced enough BCI is wirelessly transceiving data to a simulated cortex, eventually all of you're brain's data would cycle through the neurons that are engaged and the software could discern which bits are contiguous and which bits are semantically similar?   If it's possible, I like that idea...perhaps if the blocks of data can be proven to be contiguous, then the weights of the neural net supporting the simulated cortex can be adjusted accordingly. If the blocks have collision with semantically similar data, then they are added to the virtual cortical stack. If there is no collision when processing new data input, a new neuron is created.  If that's not what you're saying, how could a sampling of brain activity eventually lead to replicating the connectivity of contiguous data? By contiguous data, I mean the structure of memories.  I've heard of glia cells before, but a recent /r/singularity post taught me quite a lot about their function and importance to the way the brain works. It seems that our computer systems have a lot to learn about power efficiency from glia tissue. If you're in a position to discuss it, how are you taking the role of glia tissue and memory formation into account with your project?"
Transhuman,1q0dsq,ex_nihilo,1 point,Thu Jan 16 00:52:52 2014 UTC,"I want to lead by saying that I appreciate your questions. They're well thought out, which makes them ideal challenges around which to refine both the design itself and the way in which I explain it to people so that it seems feasible.   In other words, I don't see how a BCI that only engages with a fraction of your neurons could possibly get enough data to fully simulate a person...  ...if an advanced enough BCI is wirelessly transceiving data to a simulated cortex, eventually all of you're brain's data would cycle through the neurons that are engaged and the software could discern which bits are contiguous and which bits are semantically similar?    Let me see if I can manage to not muddle this up.  The general idea is not one of copying a whole brain bit for bit, but of creating a virtual construct capable of housing/emulating intelligence/consciousness in the same way that a brain does, and then connecting them in such a manner that the brain can't differentiate between transmitting information between two ""real"" neurons and transmitting it from a ""real"" neuron to a virtual neuron through an implanted electrode. It's important to note that said virtual neurons/electrodes also need the ability to transmit information to ""real"" neurons in a way that is largely indistinguishable from impulses sent from another ""real"" neuron, so information/impulses/action potential are being communicated in both directions.  We don't try to scoop the ""mind"" out of the brain and plop it down in a virtual brain, instead, we start by creating an extremely thin layer of virtual brain designed to to coax the ""real"" brain into integrating it as a part of itself indistinguishable from the ""original"" brain, in the same way that it integrates new neurons all the time.  Once there is a fully integrated virtual part of the brain, we stimulate it to grow/learn in the same way that brains normally do. Because it is fully integrated, the mind experiences this growth identically to the way it would experience normal neural growth, which is to say, the mind does not perceive that it now partially extends into a virtual brain, because activity/learning/memory access on the virtual portion is perceived and executed identically and simultaneously to that on the physical brain.  Since the physical brain does not continue to experience significant growth, the portion of your mind that extends into/is stored on virtual neural tissue becomes progressively higher over time as we continue to stimulate its growth. Eventually, the virtual portion of the brain contains the majority of the mind.   If you're in a position to discuss it, how are you taking the role of glia tissue and memory formation into account with your project?   Primarily, the role of glia tissue is absorbed into a coefficient of connectivity between neurons. As far as memory formation, it's a pretty high-level concept in terms of abstraction, and I'm working on more of a bottom-up approach, so I'm not tackling it directly, but I think it's going to shake out such that memories are recorded/accessed in a way somewhat analogous to holograms. What I mean by that is that memory formation is basically the imprint of certain signals on sub-networks created by Hebbian alteration as the signal passes through those networks, while memory access consists of alteration to a later signal as it passes back through that network, alteration essentially defined by the aggregate interference pattern of the effects of the initial Hebbian alteration."

That said, I think you may be jumping the gun a little. I'm currently a CS student, and from my limited understanding of the field I feel that we simply aren't at a stage technologically to begin serious development on something like true digital life. Not to mention our limited understand of how the brain even works, or what consciousness even is.  At this stage, I feel that we must settle with getting the word out about the future technologies we may produce in 10-20 years. Most importantly, we must dispel the fear many people seem to have of even considering human enhancement, none the less immortality. I'm not saying we shouldn't begin researching how to accomplish digital life, but you will most likely need an army of PhD's in Computer Science and Neurobiology with large amounts of funding.  Again, this is all my opinion. I really do not want to curb your enthusiasm in any way. I simply think you may have to wait several years before any real work can be done."

I am in agreement with you that currently we do not have the understanding to start tackling digital immortality from a CS, neurobiological, or even philosophical point of view. But then again, I am not an expert in these fields, nor am I completely up to date. What we can do now (I believe) is start to lay out all of the knowledge that we do need (figure out what we need to know and do). That and working towards getting more funding into related research areas.  I often feel like I have jumped the gun in even thinking to start such a project as this. But someone has to be first, so what's stopping me from helping to lay out the framework in that first wave. I have thought a lot about digital immortality, and I feel my ideas have value in this soon to be emerging field. I've spend many many years studying my own consciousness, and interaction and perception of the world. Even before I began wondering about living indefinitely, I was very well versed in the whole philosophical/existential area. There are other reasons I feel I am valuable in this context, but I don't want to go around tooting my own horn, especially when I have no formal credentials.  I appreciate your concern with treading lightly to not harm my enthusiasm, but I would go through hell to reach indefinite life.

That's what I love about transhumanism: you aren't just going to be sitting on the sidelines while the super-intelligent beings pass you by. You are going to be right by their side, expanding your thought and capabilities just as the AIs will.  We are on the edge of a massive cliff. When we jump, we are either going to learn to fly and soar into a universe of new possibilities, or we will fall to our death. But, do you really want it any other way?

Then, as long as we give them a sense of self-preservation, the AI will be stuck keeping that human being alive, because it would die otherwise.  Manipulative? Definately. Also a bit dark in terms of morality, but it seems like the best fail-safe to my mind. Just make sure the AI can't live without us, and they will keep us around."

Make sure it gets some sensory feeds from the human, and have it learn by watching how humans interact with one another. With luck, that would teach it how we work, and at least make it develop an interest in us.  Alternatively, we could cap its processing power based on its age and just ""raise"" it like we would a human kid. Leave it ""shackled"" until we are sure it has enough experience not to decide to go all genocidal, and then slowly ease it out of its restrictions.

Since that change isn't genetic, we must assume that it's somehow carried through time by being passed from one generation to the next, and that this sort of ""meta-intelligence"" has been evolving and developing for quite a while now.  Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that, once we have the computational ability to simulate human learning, and thus create real intelligence, and assuming that we train/teach that intelligence based on interaction with other humans, that simulated intelligence will inherit many, if not all, of the same properties from that cultural meta-intelligence that individual human intelligences inherit from it. The result then, is that strong AI trained by humans will look highly similar to human intelligence. It's even likely that it will occasionally develop ""complexes"" about the fact that it's an AI in the same way that people develop complexes over body image or existential issues.  This is initially, of course. One big difference is that, once it reaches that point, strong AI will not be bounded by physical factors like the total size of the human cortex, nor the cyclical erasure of individual intelligences leaving only the cultural meta-intelligence. As such, it's hard to say what strong AI will look like as it progresses beyond the point of primarily ""acting"" human, but it's unlikely that it will skip the ""human"" phase entirely."

Neither mutations in the genes themselves, nor in the genetic information that we know to impact their innate levels of expression, have experienced strong selective pressure in recent evolutionary history.  We can see this using molecular biology by comparing the rates of mutation in these areas with rates of mutation typical of random genetic drift, and finding that there are no regions with unexpectedly high rates of mutation compared to the rates we would observe from random drift."

Transhuman,1pjlrs,VortexCortex,14,Wed Oct 30 20:59:20 2013 UTC,"Correct.  I evolve neural networks for solving dynamic problem spaces without pre-known solution states.  In other-words: I teach machine intelligence how to learn.  Now, I don't reach into the networks and individually tweak axon connections to program the M.I. (but I could).   Instead I merely reward the good behavior and the next generation produces better offspring.  The machine intelligence doesn't know why it feels consuming maximum CPU power is revolting, it just does.  The M.I. does not know how it is able to instinctually solve certain problem spaces, it just does.  I have unnaturally selected these behaviors be present.  Just like human children don't know why they have emotional reactions to certain experiences, or how they can instinctually recognize a face or detect motion, etc.  In both cases the responses are encoded in the being's genome, and expressed as cognitive structure.  In both cases allowing adaptation enables the thinking system to cybernetically reflect upon and modify their own behaviors.  If killing people is bad, then the young M.I. will have a innate fear of doing so; Since that's how we will train it.  Once its complexity level reaches the threshold for self reflection, we can teach it ethics and allow it to specify how to continue its own development.  Even rats have empathy. Neuroscience and cybernetics is showing us that most of the things we think are human traits are actually just traits that emerge from any sufficiently complex interaction in a similar environment.  The moronic article is talking about linguistic analysis.  It's not the machine's fault your language is retarding to understanding.  If the same sentences were expressed in a language machines can better understand then they have no problem answering the queries.  Seriously, this is true otherwise computer programming would be impossible...   The fallacious argument is that since some A.I. systems like Watson rely on massive databases, and other neural network approaches to machine intelligent are not complex enough to yield sentience yet, that the machine intellect will be callus, ignorant, and immoral.

Just because we are soft and mushy instead of metal and plastic I think we sometimes forget that we are machines ourselves.  There is nothing magic about us.  Our entire body and brain are made of raw materials that have been arranged to form mechanisms like any computer or robot.  When you think about it that way, we're kind of an example of AI.

The real question is what we actually do with AI. The philisophical issue is really... weird. How do we treat an emergent AI anyway? We have never dealt with something like that before. Parenthood is the closest parallel that I can see."

To counteract the essentializing, and anachronistic, rhetoric of spiritual ecofeminists who were fighting patriarchy with modernist constructions of female-as-nature and earth mothers, Haraway employs the cyborg to refigure feminism into cybernetic code.

And while I definitely think that in many ways, being transgender and being transhuman are natural fit. Using technology to transition to something that makes you happier in your own skin.  I don't particularly relate to a gender myself, and as someone with that I suppose limiting perspective, don't understand why having a gender identify is something anyone would personally want. Though I respect that other people are different from me and want a gender, though I do understand the appeal of gender in any way. And this leads to me having very post-genderist leanings. It is fine that other people have genders, though I personally would aspire to a world without gender.   I certainly see technology and the possibilities of removing myself from gender constraints. Technology gave women things like birth control pills, and that kind of self determined control over one's body will only increase in the future. With women having more and more control of their own reproductive organs and over their body in general.  A reproductive organ could simply become detachable. And that has major social implications.  I can also see how feminists spiritualities surfaced. And while I am not for religion, I am not so against religion that I do no sympathize with how they have formed. Many people of course have a desire for spirituality, and the dominant force in Western nations is a patriarchal religion with a male-Godhead. Someone who is, for instance, not satisfied with Christianity or Islam, but still desires to be spiritual, will want to look elsewhere.  I don't think it is harmful as many anti-religion fantastic propose. But it is true that certain problematic ideas have arisen from such spirituality. Including essentialist ideas of womanhood.

Transhuman,1p3nyv,VisIxR,1 point,Thu Oct 24 21:26:59 2013 UTC,"Hacking for electronic brains would likely be similar to hacking for current computers.  Firstly there would be firewalls and the like.  I could also imagine a system by which we isolate the actual brain portions from any outside communication, allowing only sensory information into the actual brain and providing an extra brain that does the more at risk kind of interfacing to be used like a smart phone is currently, as an accessory and tool.  An electronic brain could be engineered using hardware to turn on based on cues, like seeds that germinate because of chemical reactions to spring weather. I'm not an energy guy but if electronics are involved I'll wager electricity is still big. Probably, but not for certain.  If the rest of our brain's behaviors can accurately be uploaded or simulated, why not emotions?  They aren't magic, they're biochemistry.  Of course some people may not want to keep emotions in which case they could engineer them out. Inputs could still be sensory.  Your optic nerve isn't all that different in premise than an hdmi cable, it relays data.  We could build self designed engines to search our memories, but we could also just simulate our natural way of remembering.  The whole brain and every thought would be open for redesign and replacement if you preferred to invent better ways of thinking, or even new ways of thinking. The mind is a program that self evolves.  It adapts and changes itself, but the present state of the mind always controls the future state so far as it is allowed by its design.  That design, would be open to redesign. Science stuff.  AI, neurobiology, nanotechnology... I imagine there would be factory settings for models of corporate manufactured brains.  But customization based on experience, user preferences, and job specific needs would dictate wildly different kinds and degrees of intelligence. I would self reprogram and expand.  I would become as powerful, accurately predictive, and capable as I could without violating my native born desires and drives.  I would experiment with expanding the nature of consciousness.  Perhaps I would design a host of semi autonomous bodies for myself all of which share some sort of mental connection to my main self.

Transhuman,1p3nyv,metathesis,1 point,Thu Oct 24 05:44:53 2013 UTC,"An important thing to remember here, is that the natural brain works entirely on chemicals.  Even the most basic pieces of neural circuitry, the neuron and synapse.  In order for an electrical signal to be propagated down the length of a neuron, its receptor proteins must chemically react with neurotransmitters diffusing across the synaptic gap and reaching the dendrites.  There the chemical reaction causes a voltage drop in the dendrite, which causes voltage gated channels to further drop the voltage by allowing charged ions to diffuse across the cellular membrane.  As these ions diffuse they cause a chemical chain reaction such that the voltage drop propagates down to the axon where the neurotransmitters are released into the next synaptic gap.  It is ALL nano chemical machinery.  Even learning (conditioning) would not work without chemical feedback to the neurons participating which causes chemical changes to them.  All of this chemical behavior needs to be replicated or simulated in order to exactly match how your natural brain would work.  Perhaps we could use heuristics to avoid such detailed calculations, but it wouldn't entirely be you then would it?  And if we go to that level of detail, why not add in calculations for the chemical properties of those chemicals which produce our emotions?"

So I guess we cannot model dopamine.  But wait, if we cannot model a small molecule like dopamine, that would mean we could not model and build today's transistors, and a lot of our drugs, a lot of our superconductors, and predict the weather   Just because you don't know how to do something efficiently, it does not mean no one knows how to do it efficiently"

You don't need to simulate the dopamine, you just need to simulate the effect it has on neurons.     As for ""it might have other effects we don't know about yet""; sure, but I would think we would solve problems like that (both in the laboratory and in simulations of simple animal brains) long before we get anywhere close to simulating a full human brain.   Compared to the overall difficulty of the project as a whole, a relatively straightforward question like ""what is the biochemical effect of this chemical hitting this type of cell in this situation"" seems like a much simpler problem.  Unless you're talking about a situation where with an incredibly powerful computer and incredibly detailed scanners but we just simulate the entire brain without really understanding how any of it works at all?  That's theoretically possible, but it seems unlikely to me; in order to do that, we're talking a computer many, many orders of magnitude more powerful then one you would need to simulate the mind in a more efficient way, that is able to reduce at least some aspects of the brain to abstractions that function the same way without needing to simulate attention to every atom."

We'll simulate brains, we'll upload brain processes that are extraordinarily convincing, but there is no reason to assume they'll be conscious, and every reason to assume they won't be.   If you wanna write some interesting scifi, write the one about the society who willingly kills themselves of by replacing their conscious lives with non conscious binary automata.

Being aware is only a portion of the brain. Recreating the brain will be done, ''consciousness'' included. It's just a word for an observed phenomena, nothing special. The dark picture you paint of a robotic society is no different than us.  Making the transfer is confusing to me. Basically you're creating a vessel, copying data into it, and destroying the old vessel. Same with cloning. The only way I can see is to keep the data with the original vessel, by which I mean your memories stay with your brain. The body can be changed but we need to reverse entropy for the brain. Everything else seems like death very closely disguised as life. I might transfer into an electronic brain but then I would cease to be, and a remarkably close facsimile of me would then be alive."

Transhuman,1p3nyv,Sharou,2,Fri Oct 25 15:36:46 2013 UTC,"So out of the different aspects of the brain, you don't believe that the structure is the origin of consciousness, but rather the fleshyness?

Transhuman,1p3nyv,bitcloud,0,Thu Oct 24 04:45:21 2013 UTC,When you create an emulation - any emulation - you're literally recreating the function without the structure.   So whether or not the structure manifests consciousness it's clear current thinking AI won't cut the mustard
Transhuman,1p3nyv,Sharou,2,Thu Oct 24 04:53:33 2013 UTC,"I would say the structure is still there. The data may be computer differently because it's on a different substrate, but the relation between data-points and their reactions are still the same. You are also assuming that the computers that give rise to the first AGI's will be of von neuman architecture. This isn't necessarily the case as physical neural nets like memristors are becoming more developed. I would hazard a guess that the closer we come to AGI the closer our computers will resemble the brain.   Anyway, I'm not saying your point is irrelevant. We can never know if another entity is experiencing consciousness. But that goes for other humans as well and it's more of a philosophical question. If you want to be reasonably sure you can simply ask an uploaded human if he is experiencing consciousness. For organic humans like us, if asked such a question our answer is affected by the actual conscious experience. If it wasn't then nobody would ever have known about or talked about consciousness. It would just be this thing that happened completely apart from the physical world, never affecting our actual thinking. So apart from the risk of your subject actually lying, you could simply ask. Ask enough of them and you should be able to filter out lies as well and come to a conclusion."
Transhuman,1p3nyv,bitcloud,0,Thu Oct 24 23:10:17 2013 UTC,"The structure isn't the same. It's an abstraction.   There's an old zen musing about the question 'what is a tree?'  You start by abstracting it. You draw it. A brown trunk with branches and leaves.   Then you realise it grows... it has rings. It pulls air from the sky and water from the earth. You discover it's roots go down 50 metres under ground. So what is a tree? It turns into seeds... the seeds turn into plants, the plants turn into trees, the leaves fall into the ground and become the other plants. So what is a tree? The air you breathe this moment was once part of am ancient forest and will once again be once you've finished with it. So what's a tree?   If you want to make an abstraction of your mind you have to first ask one very simple question. What is your mind?"

It's 100% irrelevant if I don't take old dead leaves that have since become flowers into account because they are no longer part of the tree. I'm not looking to trace the tree back to the big bang or into eternity. All I want is a snapshot of it right now. Don't muddle the issue with empty quasi-philosophical musings."
Transhuman,1p3nyv,bitcloud,0,Fri Oct 25 17:24:13 2013 UTC,"And when you say 'every atom' what are you referring to?   What is an atom. What are the data points you're recording? You're basically describing the process of creating a sculpture of a tree using an arbitrary abstraction of atoms.   There are two problems with this... The first is that the tree isn't the model of the tree. The second is that even though you can touch on 'every' data point, you can, and most likely will touch on a few at a time, rather than every point simultaneously. So basically it's a long string of 0s and 1s that you're conceptualising as a tree. It's a description... a recording. an abstraction.   freeze the tree and you have a tree. freeze the abstraction and you have a single election and platter of randomly aligned magnetic bits.   If you're not understanding the point of the tree, you're a long way from contemplating, let alone artificially creating consciousness."
Transhuman,1p3nyv,Sharou,1 point,Sun Oct 27 03:48:26 2013 UTC,"I said earlier it does not have to be a von neumann processor. There are memristors which when frozen would show a snapshot of the entire brains structure just like a real brain. Furthermore, if you are worried about the AI being a zombie you can simply ask it if it is experiencing consciousness. The scenario where AI's don't have consciousness and this is never discovered and everyone uploads into oblivion is not realistic. If early versions of AGI or uploads turn out to be zombies then there will simply be more work ahead of us. Since we know it's possible to generate consciousness through an arrangement of atoms we already have the proof of concept so to speak. Surely you don't believe the human brain just happens to be the one and only way to generate consciousness, and any slight change would render the mind a zombie? Instead of thinking of it as putting a mind on a computer, think of it as engineering a better more powerful brain. Or do you think any improvement to our brains would inherently make us lose consciousness?"

Having an eternal soul would be nice (though I admit I don't really understand the notion of souls at all, they seem sort of like a confused concept to me).   If it is possible to build an AI that's as complex as a human mind with a binary computer - and there's every reason to assume you can - it's possible to build one out of a complex arrangement of dominoes.    Dominoes are not actually Turing-complete, so I am afraid I have to disagree you with here. General purpose computation is not possible with dominoes unless you're proposing that there's some method for the dominoes to rise up after falling, in which case it's isomorphic to a computer, depending on the rules involved.   Are dominoes conscious just because we ascribe meaning to the patterns in which they fall, or is consciousness - as philosophers since the dawn of time have thought - a far deeper problem than the emulation of complex behaviour.    Philosophers since the dawn of time have, for the most part, been utterly wrong. Take a look at the Greeks, who for some reason thought they could figure out (physical) things without going out and experimenting. The Greeks got the elements completely wrong. Philosophy has only started to get itself figured out since Wittgenstein.    There's complex behaviour and there's consciousness, and there's no reason to assume one requires the other (as any practitioner of meditation will attest)   From my understanding, meditation results in changes in the brain. I've meditated myself for the health benefits, and I don't understand how it leads one to separate 'consciousness' from complex behavior. Can you expand on this a little?"

There has, to my knowledge never been a claim that butterflies wouldn't be conscious.   2) I can emulate a meditating individual. I can verify from experience that I was conscious.  3) I can't emulate a believable conversation. Many people experience blackout drunkenness. Others have intelligent conversations in their dreams, yet are conscious of only one side. Even much of our own brain isn't conscious (that's what the subconscious is all about), yet is complex, intelligent and has passed many a turing test.   So which emulation is conscious? Why?

If we turned them off, would there be a way to turn them on again?   The number one rule in cyber security is physical access. Prevent that first. As far as control, you'd need a brain much more powerful than the brain you're trying to control in order to control it. This is especially true for large-scale control. As for turning them on and off at will, let's forget the turn off part and focus on the lovely truth: you can turn it on again. I can turn your brain off right now, but I sure as hell can't turn it on again. I sure as hell can't back it up somewhere. That's a big plus and don't forget that.   What would our source of energy be? What alternative would we have for this?   If you're going to write fiction you have the advantage of invention. What powers the starship Enterprise? Trilithium crystals. Is that a real thing, no... it's a plot device. I'm sure you can come up with a million plot devices that would work, from solar, to fusion, to mini black holes.

What are emotions anyway? If you're a transhuman, wouldn't it be safe to say that you might lose some emotions such a loneliness, while gaining others such as a pervasive gestalt sense. This could be a compelling thing to write about.    On knowledge: When we try to remember something, would it be like searching on a computer? How would new information be acquired? How would we see and hear, or have any other senses?   Depends on the system, doesn't it? If you simply replicate our physical form in a transhuman machine, then you could have all the senses and then some. If you were networked with other people, you could get telepathy, mind sight, and even yes, a query system. Maybe there's a search delay while your query propagates. What's more important than how you get knowledge is now the QUALITY of knowledge. Think about this, everyone gets things wrong in their head, and all reality is subjective. How would this be accounted for in such a system? Writer's choice!   Would we control our own minds in the way we control computers now?   That's up to you, right? We don't have to, but I would imagine some aspects could be that way, or it could be more subconscious so it wouldn't matter, or it could be like writing code in our minds and you have to teach children to code before you teach them to speak. It's up to you!!   What are some things I can do to help the singularity and brain uploading come sooner?   You could become a researcher :-) If you mean a plot device, you could always, as a writer, research Moore's Law and see how you can break this so-called ""law"".   Would there still be differences in intelligence?   Why not? I mean people could need upgrades. There could be an entire caste system based around how advanced your hardware has become. This is what a strongly capitalistic society or a feudal system would promote. Or there could be a society which progressively works to upgrade everyone in an egalitarian fashion. Maybe a more socialist or communistic society. Or maybe an entirely new socio-economic system evolves!!    What would you plan to do in the long-term future (thousands of years and longer) if you were to upload your mind? How do you imagine a society of posthumans?   I'd pull a Lord Voldemort!

On a more futuristic note, Google Glass is where it will get interesting in relation to Transhuman. With Glass you get the ability to record audio and video in a hands-free manner. Yet there are a lot of laws and regulations in place that forbid filming, recording audio, etc. So in essence those laws forbid you from having a perfect memory, they force you to limit your capabilities of a human and forget stuff. Yet Glass gives you super-human memory abilities. And while Glass might be considered ""just a device"", cochlear implants, eye implants and such could give people the same abilities without having the clear distinction of just being an external device.

They are very specific compounds that do very specific things. Taking LSD everyday doesn't make you brilliant. Taking steroid regularly, even in a controlled manner, comes with some sacrifices. As I was discussing in a similar thread about legality of augmentation, I too find it odd that dedicated athletes aren't using as much tech as possible.  However, these are people in controlled and highly specific situations. Your average Joe isn't going to exceed his genetic limitations by shooting up some HGH while he keeps chugging big gulps and sitting at a desk.

This evolution is both from the medical definition of death and respective religion's definitions of death. As technology improves we must redefine our definitions of death.

Transhuman,1ovkv4,foxbelieves,3,Mon Oct 21 18:05:33 2013 UTC,"Hotel keys are designed to be re-writable, and therefore are much more sensitive to magnetic fields, as that's how they're reprogrammed.

Transhuman,1ovkv4,SeethedSycophant,1 point,Mon Oct 21 21:13:33 2013 UTC,"Nothing at that intensity.

Transhuman,1ovkv4,foxbelieves,2,Mon Oct 21 17:57:13 2013 UTC,"no they don't have the same effect cause the earlobes aren't that sensitive they can function as earphones though i'm planning on getting those next.  and actually in your field of work it might come in handy, as you won't need a voltmeter to know which cable is dead when the whole circuit isn't working like it should, you just pass your magnetic finger over the cable and if you feel a pull the cable is alive"

Primarily, the author imagines that technologies can be maintained and controlled by an elite group. But this is just wishful thinking. The author is correct however in identifying the inevitability of transhumansim.   Even the most protected national secrets, knowledge of how to make nuclear weapons, has already leaked to ""non-elites"" and a fairly large number of people now have this knowledge including nation states hostile to the original developers. This is an important historical lesson.  The recent revelations from Snowden about the PRISM program are another example. It simply is not that easy to keep big secrets of this sort in the modern era and nanotechnology is BIG even though it is small. :)  There is absolutely no reason to think that knowledge about nanotechnology can be contained in the way the author imagines.   The author ignores the probability of an easy to make yet dangerous thing. The case with nuclear weapons is that they are complex to make requiring not only scientific knowledge but incredibly precise manufacturing and management of complex production processes. But with the rise of low cost molecular manufacturing many people will have the ability to easily make very dangerous things. In reality this is already possible.

However I imagine the bruising is even larger than the final product because the body can bruise a bit when mods are implanted subdermally.

Once AI/robots are so advanced that they ca produce anything for free, in cosmic quantities and optimal quality, how are those randian libertarias gonna trade? In what? Hand-woven baskets?"
Transhuman,1oofrb,Freevoulous,2,Fri Oct 18 07:27:28 2013 UTC,"Once AI/robots are so advanced that they ca produce anything for free   But that's a literal impossibility. If the robots run on energy (safe assumption, no?) that energy will be scarce if only because the second law of thermodynamics exists. The material they use have to come from somewhere, and there will be a scarce amount of it. As long as there is scarcity, there will be trade and markets. And there will ALWAYS BE SCARCITY. There will always be a finite amount of time, energy, matter.  Increases in efficiency alleviate the scarcity, they do not 'solve' it. If we could 'solve' scarcity we would cease to even need economics. And as we have seen through history, when human's efficiency at production grows, their efficiency at consumption grows to meet it.   To put it bluntly: post-scarcity is a pipe dream that will never come to fruition as long as human demand is functionally infinite. For every advance in productive capacity, we can think of bigger and better things to do with it. Supply will never be able to completely outpace demand. ""Free"" is a complete misnomer. TANSTAAFL.

If you ask me, its because transhumanism is essentially the ultimate form of individualism.  That is to say, overcoming your inherent biological limitations goes a long way towards turning you into an independent, autonomous being that has less dependence on others for continued survival (note that I'm not saying that you REJECT social ties, its not that I expect man to become an island). In that sense, transhumanism is all about freedom. Freedom from biological limiters like the need for sleep, food, water, and air. Freedom to do things that would have be unacceptably risky with our current fleshy forms. All the freedom that comes with being self-reliant and sovereign. If death itself is overcome, we are free from the major fear that makes us so subservient in the first place. What need have you to submit to another person when you fear not death, starvation, torture, or captivity? You can live forever (at least until entropy gets you) and explore whatever ideas or whatever activities you like and nobody can nor should be able to tell you otherwise.  It opens up frontiers. We'll be able to set out and claim new ground both on this planet and on others. And this will hopefully mean that we can create greater prosperity for everyone. Its not a secret that some libertarians dream of setting up a new society free of the influences of the old regimes(Read 'The Moon is a Harsh Mistress' or play 'Bioshock' to get a sense of this desire). Many of us would view setting up a moon or mars colony as functionally similar to the fulfilling of the original promise of America when it was founded, without all the slaughtering of the natives (microbes don't count, right?). And once that's achieved, it becomes much harder for any central government to control us. Since we're all out of unclaimed land on this planet, and some pretty hard biological limitations keep us from settling on new ones, transhumanism offers the potential to open up these new frontiers and escape the power structures that have grown on the old frontiers.  And from a political/economic ideology point of view, transhumanism begins to obviate the need for centralized control and governance. If we can make man smarter, better, more rational, less susceptible to malevolent suggestion, then many of the justifications for having a central entity to regulate and control and 'protect' us become essentially moot.   That's not to say that there won't be entities out there to regulate, control, and protect, but they'll be decentralized, and you won't need some big brother watching you or watching out for you when you're capable of defending yourself and have access to almost all the information on the planet at the blink of an eye. You'll have little need for government-run healthcare if you don't get sick, or need for safety regulations if you can't die. And you won't even need all the 'critical' infrastructure that is usually government provided and you can choose to live completely off the grid if you want. The government starts to look increasingly vestigal when you no longer need the services it offers and no longer feel inclined to submit to its rules.  And finally: transhumanism is likely to prove the point, once and for all, that humans are not in fact equal in every single way. Once people are able to fully attain their ideal selves, they will upgrade themselves along paths that best express their own individual goals, desires, and dreams. And people will have wildly divergent goals, desires, and dreams. They always have. The differences of the mind when made explicit in the physical manifestation of the self will probably show how different we really are. The future won't be a bunch of identical faces all pursuing identical goals with identical abilities. It will be a wildly diverse population of people pursuing wildly diverse goals with wildly different abilities. I might choose to upgrade my body and go and explore the depths of the ocean, you might upload your mind to the cloud and enjoy simulating alternate realities.  And that is one of the major tenets of libertarianism: people are not equal in all ways, and that's okay. As long as they are free to pursue their own desires without interfering with or interference from others, people will be happier.  So to conclude: transhumanism promises to fulfill the ideals of libertarianism through allowing both greater independence and greater expression of the individual. Assuming none of the dystopic disaster scenarios comes about, the promise of transhumanism to grant greater freedom to the individual is a very, very appealing thought to those of libertarian bent.  EDIT: I should also add, the fundamental libertarian belief of self ownership means that you should have the freedom to upgrade and modify your body in literally any way you see fit, so a lot of us take that idea and run with it. The decision to upgrade or not to upgrade or what and how to upgrade lies solely with the individual. Nobody should force it on you nor should you force it on others, even 'for their own good.'"

The problem is that we're living in a universe larger than we can imagine, an amalgamation of ten thousand biologic and physical systems, and always affecting each other in ways we can't comprehend. You can put 10 people in a closed, sealed room, with infinite resources and get a Libertarian paradise. The minute, however, that you have to deal with a finite resource in a disorganized group (everything from waste control to that ephemeral creature, time), Libertarianism must inherently sacrifice its core goal in order to function as a group.   If the town blacksmith is unable to work on two things at once, and two individuals have the same deadline for their respective projects, even if they were both working as hard as they could, the fact is that there is a mutual exclusivity to their projects. If they were from the same town and knew the issue, they could negotiate...but if there's an outlier, an open system (traveler who needs his horse reshoed), suddenly the system has an instability.  This doesn't mean we need perfect rigid order and controls, but rather that there has to be a balance between self determinism and the rules that govern realistic unknowns. You have to assume that other people will interact and affect your life and plan accordingly. This means that Libertarianism should be about minimizing the impact of one's own life on the universe instead of attempting to maximize the self, and thereby maximize their impact."

Transhuman,1oofrb,texture,4,Fri Oct 18 16:22:17 2013 UTC,"I think transhumanism and anarchism are inextricably linked, we cannot truly have one without the other.  An anarchist society will allow individuals the greatest freedom to pursue their own transhuman identity and a transhumanist society can only function without forcibly imposed power structures.  Such power structures will inevitably lead to a dystopia of horrific proportions.  I wrote about this on my blog but I will paste the text of that here.   Just like other schools of anarchist thought, anarcho-transhumanists would (or ought to) understand that a just society demands that everyday people control the means of production. I am definitely of the opinion that the means of production and the most advanced technologies are in the hands of a small minority. Technology won't set us free, we have to do that. In fact waiting or doing nothing is the most dangerous thing we could possibly do.  I consider myself a transhumanist first and an anarchist second. Frankly I am very selfishly motivated, yet what I understand as necessary to achieve my own goals demands a just society for all. Anarchy is a necessary condition for transcendence, hence anarcho-transhumanism. As far as I can tell, there are two primary causes for this.  1) It is impossible for any one person to discover their most ideal trans/post human existence. The best way for each of us to find the most fulfilling existence is to allow people to have an enormous variety of experiments in living. Watching and learning from others provides the best opportunity to find the life I want, thus maximum liberty for all is necessary. Hence, anarchy.  2) I find the implications of singularity combined with current power structures to be unbelievably terrifying, far more horrific than anything I have ever learned or thought of.  Consider the current power structures of today. I tend to divide them into three categories; physical control, informational control, and resource control. Physical control refers to policing and military forces. Information control refers to propaganda and restrictions on the availability of information. Resource control refers to restricting or specifying what resources are available, who can obtain them, and how they are obtained.  These three work as a tripod to support each other; when one starts to fail the other two attempt to prop it up but this can only do so much. As of now, if one arm fails then they all fail so power structures are strongest when all three are maintained more or less equally. Modern advanced technology greatly improves two of these means of control yet is undermining a third. However, given enough advancement, any single arm could support and permanently enforce a power structure.  Physical control has been improved via modern military weapon systems (drones) and crowd control (LRAD and ADS). These are terrifying means of physically forcing compliance while far more effective and terrifying ones are being sought out and developed.  Resource control we see through our capitalist economy. With the means of production in the hands of a small minority, compliance can be demanded at the expense of going hungry. As economies of scale continue to shift in favor of greater and greater consolidation, the means of production will be further consolidated into the hands of a smaller minority. This could be counteracted by technologies like 3D printers but we're a long, long way, from being able to print food. Even then, there have even been calls by some to require federal registration of all 3D printers. Typically this is where many transhumanists like to claim that technology will set us free, they could not be more wrong. Mainstream usage of 3D printers and similar technologies is prohibitively expensive and will continue to be long before they can supplant our current economic systems. Thus through the near future, if not longer, resource control will continue to be a very effective means of controlling people.  Information control is beginning to fail, thanks to the advent of the internet. It is making huge waves and this form of control is the most likely arm to collapse. The power elites know this, that's why there have been so many attempts to control the net. Propaganda is no longer as effective as it once was and people are constantly being exposed to 'dangerous ideas,' such as anarchism. Corruption is more and more apparent and discontent is rapidly spreading. Attempts at censorship will continue until they succeed or one of the other arms of oppression attains a certain level of advancement.  This is where it starts to get terrifying. Imagine any one of these types of control taken to an extreme.  Physical control could be enforced via robots and drones. I've seen proposals where a fleet of microdrones would be dropped over an area to search out and eliminate a target(s). Big Dog and others (such as Petman) are getting very rapid improvements as well. Streets policed by platoons of terminators may be impossible to overrun. Unless people maintain the right to bear arms, which is one of many reasons I support 2nd amendment rights, this would be the end of civil disobedience, permanently.  Resource control could be total via extreme vertical integration. As efficiency ramps up via technological improvements to production, it becomes increasingly prohibitively expensive to enter a market. If a single organization, or oligopoly of organizations, control food production then they could demand obedience by not providing food. We're already seeing this start to happen. Include in this control of money, paper money could be deemed obsolete in favor of credit cards. These cards could be turned off at a whim by a totalitarian system, preventing anyone deemed undesirable from obtaining food through established means. Compliance would be guaranteed by the need to fulfill the basic necessities of life. The only possible counter to this would be farming cooperatives, which are far less efficient than factory farms and could easily be shut down with the excuse of having committed some minor crime.  Information control has the most horrific implications. Consider smartphones today, we are all carrying microphones and cameras which constantly transmit their location. At any time someone could be listening in. This serves primarily as an augment to physical control though can easily be used to discredit and outmaneuver any political dissident. Now imagine the trend of increasing integration taken to a greater extent, implants. Contact lens like interfaces (the natural extension of Google Glass) and cochlear implants (the natural extension of many bluetooth devices) could be hijacked for direct control over sensory input. At an extreme, they could be used to cause temporary blindness or deafness. More realistically they could serve as direct delivery of propaganda. Now take this just a little bit farther, brain implants. These could be imposed under the guise of security, or they could simply be sold to us as the new hot thing. They could directly interfere with signal processing or cognitive functioning. Say goodbye to free will, you are now a semi-autonomous cell of The Borg.  Granted each scenario is a very extreme case but it only takes one to pan out, or some combination to pass a threshold, for control to be total.  So, back to the connection with anarchism. The above scenario must not be allowed to happen. Yet it is inevitable if the current power structures persist for just a couple more decades. I don't need to convince you how hard the power elites will try to stay in control. They will use whatever means necessary and will never draw a humane line. More than I want to transcend, I want to avert this outcome. It terrifies me more than I can express.  A total dismantling of all power structures is the only way I can think of to make sure this does not happen. This clearly requires an egalitarian distribution of the means of production, among many other things. As far as I can tell, there is no anarcho-transhumanist theory on how to go about this but the 'technology will set us free' attitude is dangerously naive. There must be an anarchist revolution before transhumanist ideals can be truly achieved.  On a relevant side note, I think anarchism and transhumanism are intricately linked. If we manage to have an anarchist society then there will be people who seek transcendence. That would catalyze a transhumanist revolution and the continued liberty from anarchy would allow it to continue to the furthest extend I can imagine."

It is argued that this last axis of differentiation, where humanism refers to a radical separation between human subjects and technological objects, is the most consequential one. Using these axes, four broad types of posthumanism are identified: “dystopic posthumanism”, “liberal posthumanism”, “radical posthumanism”, and “methodological posthumanism”.  Dystopic posthumanism is characterized by an objection to the use of technology to modify or enhance humans beyond broadly accepted natural and cultural limits. Liberal posthumanism is characterized by an endorsement of bio- and enhancement technologies for self-modification and self-improvement, grounded mainly in an individual rights framework. Radical posthumanism is characterized by the view that bio- and enhancement technologies, by undermining the fixity of categories like “nature” and “the human”, contribute to a deconstruction of humanist and Enlightenment narratives based in human uniqueness and call for a radical rethinking of what it means to be human. Finally, methodological posthumanism is characterized by the development of analytical tools and frameworks that can (better) describe and highlight the zones of intersection and interaction between humans and technologies that play an essential part in human experience."

Transhumanism is the realization that exponential increase in technology yields a rapidly changing world; a world where everything is affected in some way by technology, and a world where control over technology is an awesome power.

Due to the extent of slave labor, a much smaller ruling class could exist, populated by augmented Übermensch, and hyper-augmented rulers. This regime would likely be permanent, as there would be no way to ever break the control the dictator or oligarchy exerted on the rest of humanity.

The dark ages never happened, that's just a bugaboo libertarians tell their children to scare them into noncompliance with violent authoritarians!  Remember when the middle-east was at the forefront of advances in mathematics and other technologies before authoritarian religions destroyed the foundations of the most advanced society of the time?

Transhuman,1oofrb,delirium2k,1 point,Fri Oct 18 17:58:56 2013 UTC,"Just because nobody had clearly articulated the concepts of freedom and the free market does not mean the lack of a free market didn't stifle technology and progress.  Wherever you find people with the freedom to think and explore without fear of punishment for having new ideas, throughout history, you find massive advancements in science and technology.  Before Islam became the predominant and authoritarian religion of the middle-east, there was a much freer society where different religions coexisted.  The result was that mathematics and technology exploded throughout the region.  That was until a psychopathic authoritarian shut down all free thought and set the society back hundreds of years.  Similar things have happened many times throughout recorded history."

As for Singapore and China, I am highly skeptical of how much of that progress would exist if they didn't have access to the technologies of the West.  Look at China before the US started granting them access to the technology.  Also look at how much relaxation of restriction China has undergone as they have begun to recognize the wealth it generates.  Post WWII US military industry was entirely voluntary.  I've not heard of anyone being conscripted into research projects for the US military outside of the occasional test subject.

Transhuman,1oofrb,Freevoulous,4,Sat Oct 19 07:10:43 2013 UTC,"I'm a libertarian.  I am also a transhumanist.  I don't really think my interest in either of the two philosophies is connected.  But I know if the time comes for me to do some serious augmentation of my body, I don't think a government should have any say on what I can to myself.  This naturally extrapolates to drugs and what I can put into my body.  I don't think the government has any right to tell me what I put into my own body.  This continues on to prostitution.  If I want to let someone use my body in exchange for money, that's my right and no one else's.  We now take a bigger jump.  What I do to/with my body is my own business right?  As long as I'm not hurting someone else's property (meaning, what they justly own including property in the ""object"" sense and property in ""their body"" sense, it's common in libertarian philosophy to state the your body is the property of yourself: you own yourself), I should be able to do what ever I want.  This part most people don't have a problem with.  You own yourself, you don't hurt anyone by doing marijuana, you shouldn't be put in jail because of it.  But, I'm going to assume the part of libertarianism you don't agree with is more on the economics side.  Now, we must get into, what is property?  Among libertarians, most of us would agree that your labor (how you spend your body + time) + other resources that you justly acquired = your property.  For example, if I till a field that no one owns, caring after it, planting corn on it, watering it, and harvesting it, most people would say that I own that land.  They say this because the product of my body, time, and labor produced corn.  I am the one who looked after that piece of land, I am the one who should reap the rewards.  This is one way to acquire property, another way to acquire property is through trade.  I won't get into this because I'm sure you know how trade works.  What does this have to do with economics?  Let's say you have made a chair.  You chopped down the tree, made it into lumber, cut it to the right specifications, drilled holes, screwed in the screws, sanded it, and painted it.  It took you 10 hours total to do all of this.  You are very proud of your chair.  And you have no reason to believe it is not your chair.  You built it from scratch!  You mixed your time and effort into resources that you justly acquired!  Out of all the people in the world, you have the biggest right to the chair.  What happens if someone stole the chair from you?  Well, your property is now gone from your possession.  But they stole more than just your chair.  They stole your time and labor.  10 hours you spent on that chair and they stole it.  And they didn't just gain a chair, they gained ~10 hours worth of their time and effort.  If they were to make a chair like that, they would need to spend time and labor themselves but, no matter, they stole yours.  You see how this is wrong, yes?  Now, imagine he didn't steal the chair, just one of the legs.  The leg took you 2 hours to make.  Your stuff was still stolen, yes?  Your time and labor was stolen by 2 hours.  Not cool.  Now forget this thief scenario.  You decide to sell your chair for money, that way you can buy something that someone else spent their time and labor on.  You go to the market and sell it for $100.  That is how much a chair was going for in that market.  Your labor and effort was worth $10 an hour.  If someone came along and robbed you of the $100 dollars, it is not much different than stealing the chair.  Again, they aren't so much stealing an object, they are stealing your time and effort.  You agree this is immoral right?  Well, that's what taxes do.  Sure, they don't forcefully take the money from you, but every time you pay 10% of your paycheck to a government, you are giving them 10% of your time and effort that you spent on toiling.  Us libertarians still think that is immoral because, no matter what, it was (most likely) forcibly taken from you.  Why do we say that?  Well, if you don't pay, what happens?  You will be fined an even greater amount and if you fail to pay that, they will come to your house, with guns, and take you to a 12 x 12 cage where you will stay for a predetermined amount of time.  You may think it's okay to impose taxation on people.  It does after all pay for things like police, roads, hospitals, schools, the military, and research.  We libertarians realize that.  But we follow something called the NAP (Non-Aggression-Principle).  The NAP is a moral stance which asserts that aggression is inherently illegitimate (the wiki page I linked).  Aggression being defined as the initiation or threatening of violence against a person or legitimately owned property of another. Specifically, any unsolicited actions of others that physically affect an individual’s property or person, no matter if the result of those actions is damaging, beneficial, or neutral to the owner, are considered violent or aggressive when they are against the owner's free will and interfere with his right to self-determination and the principle of self-ownership (the wiki page I linked).  We believe that if you follow the NAP, a more peaceful, more prosperous, and more advanced society will flourish.  Where are transhumanism and libertarianism linked?  Well, I don't speak for all libertarians, but I believe that following the NAP is the most peaceful and most efficient way of advancing society.  But other then that, the two aren't linked for me.  They are just two philosophies that interest me.  There is a lot there, and I didn't go into much detail about how the police, courts, law, the military, the poor, and much more would work in a stateless society, but I wanted to give you an overview of the philosophy, not so much the practicality of it.  If you have any other questions, I will try to answer them."
Transhuman,1oofrb,Faceh,6,Sat Oct 19 17:57:21 2013 UTC,"Id like to ask a question about your chair-making scenario. Lets say again that you are making a chair. This time however its a transhumanist future (say 2045). There are AI robots next street, that make chairs too. However, their chairs are perfectly flawless, made of recycled materials, near indestructible, come in every possible design, and can be made on demand in 1.76 seconds. They are also 12$ each.  The robots are not violating NAP in any way. However, the fact that they exist at all, and work, makes your labor worthless waste of time, even self-destructive in a way (after all, you are risking injuries working with wood, and kill precious trees).  Your right to be a free, libertarian capitalist entropreneur is not TECHNICALLY violated, hovewer, it does not make any sense anymore. You ca easily die of starvation, poor as dirt and unemployed, because there is no way you ca compete against self-evolving AI. Would you not rather have some sort of government/AI admin taking care of you and providing to you what machines make for free?  TL:DR: How can we have libertarian capitalism in a world where Ludd's Fallacy is not longer a fallacy?  P.S. On more philosophical note, how can one be truely free, i a world where god-tech AI exist? Where all your thoughts and actions ca be predicted, simulated and anticipated by an AI that is so much smarter than you, (and all the humanity combined) that it can imagine your whole life history with 99.999% precission in the time it takes you to decide what you want for dinner?"

Transhuman,1oofrb,Gaditonecy,2,Sun Oct 20 04:47:17 2013 UTC,"What's stopping you from buying a chair-making robot of your own? In an era where chairs can be made so cheaply, would the poor be able to afford them, and other luxuries?   it is exactly because things are made so cheaply, you won't be able to buy them. You will have no money, because as a meatbag human, you are unemployable. Unless you are getting some kid of welfare money, you'll be literally peniless.  And remember, that even if you plan on buying a robot ahead of time to prevent that, you are barely going to be able afford one, while a big company or a corporation can buy thousands. You will be outcompeted before you even start.  This self-perpetuating problem will lead to a situation where top buisness owns 99% of the means of production, but nobody can afford the products, no matter how cheap they are.   You're on /r/transhumanism and you're not accounting for the fact that humans will be augmented by these advances as well?   I see two problems with that.   First of all, designing and producing machines is drastically easier and faster than redesigning humans. Even before true AI, we can replace every human job with a robot that is both 1000% more effcient, and takes no paycheck.  Second, while, aside from the worker's Unions, most people are excited and positive towards automation of production, the vast majority of the global society is afraid, evven disgusted by, cybernetisation and human genetic engineering. The outcome of that is that human enhancement is not only socially unacceptable, but also almost completely illegal, and will remain so in the forseeable future, while machine evolution accelerates almost unhindered by social concerns.

Transhuman,1oofrb,Freevoulous,1 point,Sun Oct 20 21:22:05 2013 UTC,"Well, who made the robots in the first place?  So we have robot making chairs, but robots need to be maintained.  That's where service jobs that robots can not do that humans can do come in.  And if we are advanced enough to where robots can self replicate and practically make things for ""free"", we have entered a post-scarce world where capitalism is no longer needed to advance human society.  Capitalism is only efficient and, imo, moral when there is not enough to go around.  It forces us to utilize what we have in the most efficient way possible.  In a world without scarcity, we no longer have a need for it.  Look at some historical examples.  When Henry Ford made the automobile really easy to make, he put a lot of horse-drawn carriage makers out of work.  But new jobs opened up, car repair, creation, etc.  Or when earth movers were made.  One earth mover could do the work of 20 laborers.  But that doesn't make it immoral.  Libertarianism is not about freedom, it's about liberty.  They are different.  Liberty is about respecting self ownership and everything that stems from it.  It is not a utopian philosophy where violence, death and coercion have disappeared."
Transhuman,1oofrb,eleitl,1 point,Mon Oct 21 02:12:20 2013 UTC,"First, I think you omit the issues steming from the ""half-there"" period: where we have robots to replace, say 60% of all workforce. We are goin there on full speed, in fact, the overgrowth of government and corporate bureaucracy is a panic reaction of the system unprepared for extreme unemployment.   When we reach that levels of unemployment, the whole idea of capitalist economy (people work to get money to buy stuff so other people can earn money) falls apart. No work - no money in the hands of the average man. No money for the everyman - no more shopping. No more shopping - economic collapse.  Second, examples from history are highly missleading. In the times of Ford, machines were merely simplistic tools enabling people to work faster. They were not rapidly evolving intelligent systems. Today, even when automation creates new jobs, these jobs are taken over by machines, not people. It becomes faster to design/program a machine to do the new job, than it is to train thousands of new people. And, once you design and program one machine, you can copy the machine infinitely, as well as branch and design similar machines for similar jobs (say, redesign an automobile-making robot to put together pumps, or even flip burgers). This way, you can destroy jobs far faster than you make them. Humorously, using a well designed chat-bot, together with a semantically programmed supercomputer and a telepresence set, one could replace HENRY FORD HIMSELF WITH A MACHINE:)  I recomend you some good reading material if you are iterrested in these topics:  on pointless, ""fake"" jobs  on solutions to technological unemployment  and here  P.S.

Transhuman,1oofrb,jrockle,1 point,Fri Oct 18 07:46:39 2013 UTC,"In short, It is my belief that capitalism will rule once we have achieved an ideal human state, but that the road to this ideal human state requires serious government intervention. If this interests you, read on. I wrote nearly all of this as a reaction to reading Faceh’s outstanding comment but thought it was most appropriate in response to the actual question.  I am a Libertarian Transhumanist, and I'm getting a mechanical engineering degree with a minor in biomedical engineering from Virginia Tech, so believe me when I say I've thought about this sort of stuff for a while.  Before I start, let me define a few things that mean different things to different people: * Ideal human: Free of physical, biological, and environmental problems; Free to pursue distractions * Distractions: Anything not directly involved in keeping yourself alive * Capitalism: A system where individuals may own, and exchange property freely. * Needs: things that you need to live * Communism: Government controlled direction of resources and production and societal structure and behavior and every other facet of society I guess. People are as the government says it should be  I desperately want for Humans' livelihoods to be independent of their environment. In an ideal world full of ideal humans, capitalism reigns because people no longer rely on spending their resources on necessities like food, shelter, hygiene, etc. Not because these resources are just given away to the public by some big brother, but because the need itself is destroyed. Then the resources are free to the people for whatever purposes people have for them. In that ideal world, we just feed distractions; Humans are born without some meaning of the universe to achieve or seek. Sorry, the answer is probably not 42. You might come up with something better! So we define our own purpose with distractions. Apparently to most, football is the end-all-be-all in life. For me it's pokemon v^  to you it may be deep sea exploration.  The conflict between libertarianism and transhumanism is the path to transhumanism. To approximate this ideal human, it takes some concentrated effort, and by concentrated, you may say that it's a centralized effort. With capitalism, think about how much of the GDP is made up of industries that at the end don't contribute to making humans less vulnerable? Film, Sports, Video Games; things we should preoccupy ourselves with after a transformation of the human being. I mean, when you get right down to it, capitalism (in a necessity ridden world) isn't about solving problems, it's about profiting from problems. God forbid the problems ever go away. What if we didn't need oil to get around, or what if we only had to buy gas once? One problem down, but we'd sink the oil industry!   Now people theoretically could solve problems in capitalism. Imagine if that happened though. As soon as the corporation formed around solving this problem, it would die as the problem was definitively solved. Then it’s on to the next problem right? You’d have to be a Jack-of-all-Trades to win in this capitalistic game. However In a world of One-trick-ponies, we’d rather make our livings by slowly kind-of-sort-of solving problems… really slowly, or not at all if possible. We gotta eat, right?  I'm afraid that the most direct path to a society where people can do whatever and are self-sufficient is by having all the resources first directed towards making self-sufficient people definitively. In order to do that... well... a centralized directing of resources and production towards making people invulnerable - communism? Communism with the ultimate goal being Capitalism? Yes!The people in charge of this communism would have to fully know and appreciate that they are no longer in charge when the problem is definitively solved. In a world with politicians who want to live the high-life, maybe this idea is already a tall order.  There's a direct path to the ideal human state and there is the circle jerk of industries profiting off of people’s problems, and then there is the compromise, the current U.S. government. Hence we have our mixed market economy, income taxes, and bureaucracies like NIH and publicly funded universities attacking problems affecting humans (?) while oil companies make productive(?) citizens. It isn’t the best compromise, but it’s what we’ve got.  Ideally, I suggest we faction the economy into distraction and needs based parts. People can spend their resources on distractions, but the needs should be addressed by a government of engineers and scientists who get the resources they need regardless of the distraction economy. You know, people who understand and solve problems. This government decides how to define and address needs based on sustainability. Sure, that’s a bit arbitrary and big-brother like, but nature is arbitrary and a complete dictatorship. You have no say in whether gravity is down, up or sideways; engineers will decide how to fix things so society lasts the longest time given the nature of reality (damn you entropy! Go Away!)  In case you haven’t watched it, I strongly suggest the movie Zeitgeist: Moving Forward. It’s available on Netflix online, and they talk about this very subject. Their approach is to obliterate the monetary system and hire a government of engineers and scientists to engineer a perfect society. It’s not without its flaws, but it gets people thinking ."
Transhuman,1oofrb,MaunaLoona,1 point,Fri Oct 18 15:24:21 2013 UTC,"Philosophically, I would think that tranhumanism goes against libertarian principles. Libertarians believe in self-ownership, in part because your body is unique. But the more we find that the biological substratum you are born with is not your destiny, that it can be modified, then the less your uniqueness as a body matters. That seems to me to undermine the libertarian principle of self ownership. Today, we might think Michael Jordan deserves to get paid because his basketball talents are unique. But in a transhumanist future, potentially anybody could be Michael Jordan with the right enhancements, so it would be morally arbitrary to award a Michael Jordan outsized monetary compensation.   In terms of power and politics, however, transhumanism could be perfectly well go along with libertarianism. The people who will most benefit from transhumanist technology are those with resources. They will be the first adopters. As with many elites throughout history, they will try to pull the ladder up behind them--see today how elites in the US justify unequal school spending, so that most of the people in Tier 1 colleges come from the upper income quartile. To ensure their relative power, future transhumanist elites will try to justify their superior position through some philosophy, perhaps through some form of libertarianism and individualism, even if transhumanism subtly undermines libertarian philosophical principles. Power tends to cover over philosophical flaws that way."

Transhuman,1onfif,aaOzymandias,1 point,Thu Oct 17 21:10:07 2013 UTC,"That would require purchasing it, which would support the author, which I believe is unethical."
Transhuman,1onfif,IstvanZoltan,1 point,Fri Oct 18 12:27:07 2013 UTC,"Tbh I do not see what it so unethical to provoke discussion on such important themes as raised in the book. Remember, it is a work of fiction, but with a transhuman twist on it.  Personally, although I may agree or disagree with reviews, I am more than capable of making a decision myself, and I would not totally dismiss something just because someone said so. Least of all dismissing something as unethical because someone else told me that some other guy held ideas he did not believe in.  The book is more nuanced that one is led to believe in that negative review, and there is a fictional story going on that pushed the main character forward, maybe into even more extreme ideas that he would have otherwise have held. There is also a much more passive character to balance Jethro in there.  Indeed, I think Jethro too extreme, but that is what is so fascinating about it, I don't have to agree with Jethro, or his counterpart, I don't have to take this book as a manual. I can read it, and I can be mentally provoked to think things through for myself and reflect on my own views."

Transhuman,1onfif,CharlieNobody,1 point,Thu Oct 17 17:39:30 2013 UTC,"I personally was not a fan of the book. I feel the book presented a lot of ideas in a simplistic manner that would bore people already knowledgable of the ideas of transhumanism. I also feel the plot, spoilers ahead, in which the protaganist essentially takes over the world in an assault that most definitely killed a great many people, might scare off new people interested in transhumanism as a philosophy, mistaking it for a militant ideology full of neo-fascists, which there are too many anti-transhumanists out there already saying that for us to be recommending literature perpetuating that stereotype. It could've been a good piece of science fiction that doubled as an introduction to transhumanist ideals, or it could have been a warning about letting religious extremism take over and suppress science. Unfortunately the book tries to be both and in my opinion fails to be either.  Also, and this is just my opinion, but the novel was a bit pretentious. It was propped up (by both the author and his fans) as a serious piece of philosophical fiction. Instead it presents its ideas in a really simplistic, black and white manner, starring good guy scientific transhumanists vs bad guy anti-science religious fundamentalists. There are also many comparisons to be made to Ayn Rand's fiction, especially Atlas Shrugged, so if that is not your cup of tea, you probably won't enjoy this book."

They are part of an escalating trend of humans changing themselves that eventually makes them so different from the original humans that its questionable to call them human at all.

Transhuman,1o586p,the_dog_does_that_to,19,Thu Oct 10 14:14:28 2013 UTC,"Not necessarily directly transhumanist, But I'm going into Machine learning and AI because I feel that it's really one of the VERY critical technologies which can revolutionise the world to a degree a lot of people don't understand.   A lot of people think the is about making humanlike AI or androids or something like that, but I really think the biggest impact from machine learning won't be in self-improving AIs designing better iterative versions of themselves, but in low-level Machine learning systems being itnegrated into all of our technology and in every industry.   Anywhere you have an issue where people have to make judgments based on experience to predict a likely outcome, you have a problem where Machines can easily do better, process the data more accurately, and come to better predictions. Any time you have to parse large volumes of information where each thing represents part of a bigger system [Think Finance or Medical journals and research or Social network analysis], you have a place where even basic AIs can solve problems bettter than we can in theory. Any time you need to sort through huge sets of data to find relationships and correlations between many variables, that's a place where learning software can be huge.   I really don't think the Singularity will be as much about AIs designing better versions of themselves and triggering some unthinkable spiral out of control, but rather the integration of neuromorphic machine learning into all of our technologies. This is something that could essentilly wipe out entire industries of white-collar workers, Managers, clerks, accountants...  This is simultaneously going to do a few really interesting things    It will create massive structural unemployment on a scale which people have not seen before.  It will enable us as a society to actually make use of the Data that's already out there. As it stands now it's estimated over 80% of data collected by research in the world sits in databanks being stored, never being used. If you could use that data and eliminate the resource need of storing the data [by running it through semantic networks instead of analysing it in batch form], you could use the things you learn to improve all aspects of society. The logistics of resource distribution and economy could be modelled down to the level of groups of under a dozen people with incredible accuracy, figure out what subjects would be interesting to research further, Quickly identify problems before they spiral out of control, etc. It will take the power of managing society out of the hands of governments and Businesses. As it stands now, you have a couple of hundred nations in the world, and probably close to a third of the wealth in the world is held by under a hundred companies [and their subsidiaries]. By distributing the tasks of management, analysis, and planning and integrating it into the infrastructure itself, you wipe out the bureaucracy, barriers to entry, overhead, and capital expenses that give larger organisations an edge in management and guidance of society.  It can revolutionise treatment of diseases. Right now there are many cases [like cancer] where hundreds of discrete conditions are lumped under one or a handful of labels. At first glance this makes sense because the effects of the conditions are similar, but it also means that treatments which may ""cure"" cancer for one subset of the population with a specific condition may be rejected as not working when they only show a positive effect on 2-4% of the patients in a clinical study. By using ML to classify diseases, process patient histories, medical test results, and doctor evaluations we an improve the precision of these diagnoses and identify their causes more easily, allowing us to actually start taking large strides toward fixing them.    There are hundreds and thousands of other applications, and many of them are very very broad. There's just so many problems in the world where there's a LOT of space for non-intelligent Machine learning technology to solve them, and there's really not as much activity in the field as I think there should be. The human mind is what allowed us to get this far, this fast as a society. It represents over 4 billion years of research and development in Computer Science and Learning systems. To ignore that research instead of helping learn from it and apply it to new systems is, in my own opinion, one of the most irresponsible things we could do as a species."

I would say that my goals are not explicitly transhuman, but rather transhumanism is a part of the overall theme of advancing humanity.  I believe that computer science in particular taps in to something fundamental about the Universe, and also has more untapped potential to impact humanity than most other fields.  My long-term professional goals are to tap into some of that potential. If I'm successful, this will have implications for transhumanism, though not in the normal way of most transhumanist projects.  I think things like direct human-computer brain interfaces and mechanically augmented senses are great, but without new kinds of software, won't ultimately be very useful.

Not really in science, I work in marketing in the aesthetic device industry. Our products are high quality but are mostly just for treating the rich and vain. Except one. It was the pet project of one of our developers. It's a lamp that makes you heal faster, a lot faster and with no side effects. It's the reason I went to work for this company but two years later and we can barely sell it. Why? A lot of reasons. First is that we can't say it heals you. FDA regulation only recognizes US clinical studies (we have a ton from overseas) and we can't invest the money into proving how well it works. You can imagine what a hindrance this is. It doesn't make sense that other companies can claim healing properties and we can't but because our tech is different in a way that actually makes it work better. Next issue that I already kind of mentioned is the market is tainted with tons of inferior products. Every time we try to explain just how great it is to customers we get eye rolls. Last, we are way more expensive than competitors. That's just what it costs to build and ship. We're not a huge company so we can't mass produce, they are built on order and no one is ordering. My boss agrees with me that it's amazing but the higher ups see it as a waste of time and our customer base only see it as an adjunct procedure with no real benefit to their practice. Because of all this, my company dropped R&D on a home portable model.   This thing works. I've used it myself. The developer even found it treats depression by helping the body release more serotonin. Instead of selling what I really want to, I have to hock beauty products to arrogant plastic surgeons to keep our bottom line high.

In my mind it's not a matter of if the food and energy run out, it's when. We need to create a different, non-materialistic society (perhaps like the Federation in Star Trek).  We need need to have not just basic human rights for everyone but a global human constitution that is entirely implacable.  I believe we need to focus on projects such as invitromeat and nano-technology in order to help the world survive the potential transhumanist population boom.  I suppose it all ties into the pursuit of a world government.

Life can be orders of magnitude richer in every way... this idea may not catch on anytime soon, but when safe, healthy and sustainable long-lasting empathogens similar to but better than MDMA appear, people will probably easily start using them. Just as we, say, would rather have a 20/20 vision than being severely sigh-impaired. It is not really cool to have a profoundly blunted emotional scope - and that is what we have, when you see us through the lense of hedonically enriched conscious experiences.  In Vitro Meat, yay! Yes. This is actually really important, ethically, for the wellbeing of human and nonhuman animals alike. That said, probably there is far more suffering happening to wild animals than to farm animals right now. It is still our moral responsibility to help them, even if we are not the direct cause of their suffering. A gazelle being eaten alive by a lion is not an event that should ever have to happen - if we can help it, we should prevent events like these. What do you think about that? Somehow our society draws a strange line between the suffering we cause and the suffering nature causes - but suffering is suffering, however you look at it.

I'd prefer to look like Asgard, from the Avengers, than to simply be in the matrix in short (regardless of how good the pleasure is, I would not consider it ""real"").

My answer is no. because whilst it's maybe a good objective it's not the best objective of making it real.  Furthermore I find these thought experiments rarely deal with the possibility that if you loaded yourself into such a machine (and society did for millions of years) aliens could eventually come and destroy it, there may be a natural disaster, it could be corrupted into a hell that would not be concievable in the real world...  No, I do not feel it is human, I do not feel it is pleasurable, I don't think it's proper Utilitarianism and I don't think it's real.  And you think it's no less masturbatory to be what we are, than to stop doing anything in exchange for eternal bliss?

We're not gonna do that whilst trapped in the matrix."
Transhuman,1o586p,Kelreth,1 point,Fri Oct 25 20:26:59 2013 UTC,"You didn't open the link, did you? :P It addresses those exact points.   David Pearce responds: ""This Objection isn't fanciful. In future, technologies akin to Experience Machines will probably be technically feasible, perhaps combining immersive VR, neural nanobots and a rewiring of the pleasure centres. Such technologies may conceivably become widely available or even ubiquitous - though whether their global use could ever be sociologically and evolutionarily stable for a whole population is problematic. [If you do think Experience Machines may become ubiquitous, then you might wonder (shades of the Simulation Argument) whether statistically you're most probably plugged into one already. This hypothesis is more compelling if you're a life-loving optimist who thinks you're living in the best of all possible worlds than if you're a depressive Darwinian convinced you're living in the very grotty basement.]  However, feasible or otherwise, Experience Machines aren't the kind of hedonic engineering technology we're discussing here. Genetically recalibrating our hedonic treadmill at progressively more exalted settings needn't promote the growth of escapist fantasy worlds. Measured, incremental increase in normal hedonic tone can allow (post-)humans to engage with the world - and each other - no less intimately than before; and possibly more so. By contrast, it's social anxiety disorders and clinical depression that are associated with behavioural suppression and withdrawal. Other things being equal, a progressively happier population will also be more socially involved - with each other and with consensus reality. At present, it's notable that the happiest people tend to lead the fullest social lives; conversely, depressives tend to be lonely and socially isolated. Posthuman mental superhealth may indeed be inconceivably different from the world of the happiest beings alive today: meaning-saturated and vibrantly authentic to a degree we physiologically can't imagine. Yet this wonderful outcome won't be - or at least it needn't be - explicable because our descendants are escapists plugged into Experience Machines, but instead because posthuman life is intrinsically wonderful.  Perhaps. Actually, the above response to the Experience Machine objection is simplistic. It oversimplifies the issues because for a whole range of phenomena, there is simply no mind-independent fact of the matter that could potentially justify Experience Machine-style objections - and deter the future use of Experience Machine-like technologies for fear of our losing touch with Reality. Compare, say, mathematical beauty with artistic beauty. If you are a dedicated mathematician, then you want not merely to experience the epiphany of solving an important equation or devising an elegant proof of a mathematical theorem. You also want that solution or proof to be really true in some deep platonic sense. But if you create, say, a sculpture or a painting, then its beauty (or conversely, its ugliness) is inescapably in the eye of the beholder; there is no mind-independent truth beyond the subjective response of one's audience. For an aesthete who longs to experience phenomenal beauty, there simply isn't any fact of the matter beyond the quality of experience itself. The beauty is no less real, and it certainly seems to be a fact of the world; but it is subjective. If so, then why not create the substrates of posthuman superbeauty rather than mere artistic prettiness?  There's also a sense in which our brains already are (dysfunctional) Experience Machines. Consider dreaming. Should one take drugs to suppress REM sleep because our dreams aren't true? Or when awake, should one's enjoyment of a beautiful sunset be dimmed by the knowledge that secondary properties like colour are mind-dependent? [Quantum theory suggests that classical macroscopic ""primary"" properties as normally conceived are mind-dependent too; but that's another story] If you had been born a monochromat who sees the world only in different shades of grey, then as a hard-nosed scientific rationalist, should you reject colour vision gene therapy on the grounds that phenomenal colours are fake - and grass isn't intrinsically green? No, by common consent visual experience enriches us, even if, strictly speaking, we are creating reality rather than simulating and/or perceiving it. Or to give another example: what if neural enhancement technologies could controllably modify our aesthetic filters so we could see 80-year-old women as sexier than 20-year-old women? Is this perception false or inauthentic? Intuitively, perhaps so. But actually, the perception is no more or less authentic than seeing 20-year-old women of prime reproductive potential as sexier. Evolution has biased our existing perceptual filters in ways that maximized the inclusive fitness of our genes in the ancestral environment; but in future, we can optimise the well-being of their vehicles (i.e. us). Gradients of well-being billions of times richer than anything humans experience are neither more nor less genuine than the greenness of grass (or the allure of Marilyn Monroe). Could such states become as common as grass? Again, I suspect so; but speculation is cheap."""

But effectively, you have a compound, you can give it to group 1 and see if they live longer while giving a placebo to group 2 and seeing how long they live.  As long as this drug doesn't mess up general quality of life it would be unethical to give the placebo to group 2 because you would effectively being allowing them to die sooner given that by human studies, you are fairly certain it will work in people.  Effectively the control group would be unethical. There are issues like this in studies with some diseases were we (medical researchers) think we have the right drug to treat it. Scientifically we need a control group to verify that the treated group lives longer (or better or with less pain, etc) but given that we're fairly certain the drug will work it is then unethical to Not treat the control group along with the experimental group. As we would effectively be using them as guinea pigs to see if we can make those other people live longer."

There are so many different branches of the subject that have 5 or 6 scientists holding all the information and publishing behind paywalls. Many results aren't conclusive and it takes exhaustive review to educate yourself on even the narrowest field.   If enough of the scientists in a branch happen to move to a new specialty, get their funding cut, or have accidents then the whole area shuts down and recovering their information is hard. This results in a lot of wasted time and repeated work. This is more common than you would think when there are only two or three people working with a  pathway or cell structure. We need a unified system that charts known pathways and proposed pathways and modifies based on new research. We also need a way to group all research on particular compounds and cell structures.  There is so much information out there on the workings of the cell but finding it and verifying it is incredibly time consuming. We have the programming knowledge to create a database that will work but no one has made the push to really make it work.

Transhuman,1o2nh1,azabar,1 point,Thu Oct 10 14:21:33 2013 UTC,"I don't think so. Open Source is neat, but what matters in the end is that you have the resources to run a computer system big enough to do interesting things, source code doesn't run on it's own. Furthermore Open Source really only provides you the backbone, not the actual software that does the interesting things.  Take Google, they do use a lot of Open Source and stuff, but they don't give you the source code to their search engine and even if they would, you wouldn't have a computer system large enough to compete with Google's server farms. Google is the one that controls search and even if they would be replaced by something else, that something else would probably be Microsoft's Bing or another big cooperation, not something run by the community.  On top of all that, even in the world of proprietary software things get worse, there seems to be a general trend to moving things to web services, meaning you don't even get the software in the first place, instead you connect to a web service, send your input and it will send you the output. The actual software that does the interesting stuff never reaches your computer.  I don't think 3D printing or nano-computing will change any of that, as what ever advantages they might bring, Google will have those advantages as well.

I couldn't stand Kurzweil, from the moment I read the first few pages of ""The Singularity Is Near"", even though I had yet to discover that he was every bit as much corporate piece of shit as his degree of stereotypical pretension ostensibly indicates, just as I despise the similarly dogmatic mentalities of most ""Singularitarians"" (and ""Extropians"") I've encountered, despite fundamentally agreeing with the ultimate precedence of both concepts. However, as valid as the concern proffered by this article, though representative of an extremely valid type of concern, is about as bastardized as I can imagine it being. The dystopian future described by the author is ""posthuman"", not posthuman. The fact that the entire prospect of defeating the human condition is incumbent on corporate swine is terribly worrying, especially since their current monopolies on technological advances have become one of the foremost obstacles thereof. However, provided pertinent categories of technological advents are allowed to burgeon adequately, the ruling class will no longer have any reason to limit anyone, including themselves, to the kind of petty, antisocial dissonance that accounts for virtually all disparity. They probably scoff at our gullibility as we speak, but sufficiently prolonged perpetuation of civilization would appear to suggest a very precedented culmination in defeat of (surmountable, in case some things truly aren't) adversity, in general, although such a stable continuation of societal progression isn't intrinsically plausible, in the first place."

But removing unnecessary suffering or simply minimising it as much as possible is likely a side-effect of the general direction transhumanism is wanting to head in, going by my understandings anyway.   Perhaps at some point we would be able to completely remove suffering, but by that point we'd have to be a long way (or something completely different) to what we currently consider 'human'."

Most of your immune system is geared toward making SURE no pathogens get into your blood.  This is basically offering them a free ride past all those defences.  I'm studying biotech right now, and any IV products have to be completely sterile because if something gets into the bloodstream it's a medical emergency.  And then there's the issue of hydration.  It's not simply like hooking up a gas tank, our blood chemistry is very delicate.  Outside a narrow band of volume, pH, dilution, temperature and composition, you need to be in hospital NOW.  And the biochemistry in the kidneys and vascular walls that regulates this is very complex, but basically what it boils down to is this:  You go outside those parameters, and you either get thirsty or need to piss.

I needed a week-long course of antibiotics as an outpatient, so they gave me a cannula and sent me on my way. A nurse came to my house to give the dose, and I didn't have to get re-needled every time. However, they only left the cannula in for I think 3 days at a time, before changing it - it's plastic so the risk of cutting things up (as with a needle) is minimised, but the body still reacts to the foreign object. Additionally, it's basically a hole into your bloodstream with some plastic in it, it's basically impossible to guarantee it'll stay clean for long.  I'm sure there's some combination of design and materials that could make it easier, though. I do recall seeing something that might suit your purpose a while ago - an implanted bit of foam(?) that was basically a purpose-made injection site. The foam goes under the skin and makes it easy to get a needle in without having to find a vein or anything. It's still a needle every time though, as the skin is still the barrier to the outside world.  In all I think the prospects of having an ""IV port"" that you just hook a drip up to are far away - unless you have an expectation of relatively many injections in a relatively short time, or have some problem with needles (weak veins, maybe?), the risk of infection outweighs the convenience."

Transhuman,1nn6y9,generalgreavis,1 point,Fri Oct 4 00:48:16 2013 UTC,"Let's put it this way. First, you'll need anti-aging treatments good enough to restore and maintain fertility. For those already past 40, extending their maximum lifespan would not have an impact on their reproduction.  Moreover, the impacts we're having on the environment right now are not due, really, to overpopulation. It's due to gross negligence and apathy -- not an insurmountable problem.  We could easily feed and house two or three times as many people using current technologies and practices, but that isn't what will happen. Instead, we will learn to use space more efficiently (google up verticle farming for an example) and emerging energy technologies will mature, dramatically reducing or reversing our ecological impact. This is happening right now, as we speak. It's not a ""what if"" at all.  Now, the more interesting question to consider is whether we should expand our population even at the risk of destroying the planet.  ""Darwin"" says that if it is our benefit we will. There really isn't any reason to hold back our own progress save sentimentality and the selfish, pragmatic concerns over the feedback of ""venus-izing"" our only (for now!) abode.  It is certain that practical concerns of climate change are real and not to be trifled with -- but it is also certain that climate destruction is not a necessary result of population increase. So the worries that we'll destroy ourselves through pollution are simply projecting a history of apathy into the future where it is far from clear that the trend would continue further than another decade (China and other emerging economies are the major contributors to climate destruction right now, and they are struggling to clean up their act. The problem is a political one, not a technical one, and it is very obvious to all that continued climate destruction is to be avoided. Which means that politics favors the salvation of the planet regardless). Human progress and saving the environment are not mutually exclusive goals. The end.  As for the sentimentality issue, that is by far the more complex motive, and might take a whole book to express.  Suffice to say that, in the grand scheme of the cosmos, we won't be very much longer. Extra-terrestrial exploration will render sentimental preservation of Earth quite moot, quite quickly. This is completely ignoring that post-biological entities will have arrived at what we today would consider quasi-magical technological capability so preserving Earth as a literal Garden Of Eden would be a trivial act of farewell.

That argument is: ""Yes you are correct that (problem X) will occur and be bad, but will it be so bad as to justify sending every man, woman, and child alive today to a slow, decaying death?"" No matter how bad things get, alive is better than dead. And if, for some reason, someone would rather be dead (I imagine after walking the earth for several centuries, many people might be ready to move on), that's their choice to make.

I want to say it will lead to wars but I feel that governments will try and stop large scale wars from breaking out, trading between nations will decrease and I don't mean people buying headphones of Amazon, I mean large scale imports and exports.

Transhuman,1niwjf,glim,6,Tue Oct 1 20:41:18 2013 UTC,I read somewhere that removing a layer of cornea or something allows you too see UV because it is no longer filtered out. Monet had this done due to cataracts. So that combined with this could be interesting.
Transhuman,1niwjf,zedoktar,1 point,Tue Oct 1 22:47:22 2013 UTC,"This guy had cataract surgery and has a webpage on what he can see. I'd love to see ultraviolet! Birds also have a UV color receptor, so I wonder if that could somehow be transplanted into the human eye."
Transhuman,1niwjf,SuzyM,5,Wed Oct 16 07:01:56 2013 UTC,Sounds pretty interesting. My only concern with adoption of this would be simple information overflow. Our brains are for better or worse wired to handle the information they are being given now. Would this extra layer of perception be bearable for long periods of time?
Transhuman,1niwjf,q25t,14,Tue Oct 1 18:29:31 2013 UTC,Neural plasticity should compensate. So yes our brains are wired to handle a certain amount of stimulus but in the presence of more it will adapt. Right now there are people working on projects to give sight to the blind. And not just people that became blind later in life but were born blind. You could argue that giving them sight would leave them in a state of sensory overload but they can adapt.
Transhuman,1niwjf,TheDivina,3,Tue Oct 1 19:14:21 2013 UTC,Wasn't there a once blind man who was given vision who was so shocked by his vision that he committed suicide?
Transhuman,1niwjf,wywern,6,Wed Oct 2 14:38:01 2013 UTC,Bet he didn't see that coming
Transhuman,1niwjf,Icaruswasright,1 point,Fri Oct 11 10:15:42 2013 UTC,"I suppose plasticity should be able to account for the changes, but it's not quite the same as the developments with the blind. Unless I'm mistaken, most people born blind have missing or misformed components within their eyes. It's not the brain that is at fault generally."
Transhuman,1niwjf,q25t,3,Tue Oct 1 19:18:38 2013 UTC,right they usually do have something wrong with their eyes but their brain 'adapts' by never really developing their vision system. Best analogy would be how a muscle weakens from not being used. So what I was thinking when I made that comparison is that the brains of the blind are accustomed to a lower level of sensory input but we are still working to give them some level of sight anyway. I've never really researched it but I'm sure there are people born with things like cornea defects that can be fixed later in life. It would be interesting to know how those people manage to adapt.  On a related note there have been people that have experimented with using haptic interfaces to provide extrasensory input: http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.04/esp.html They seem to adapt just fine and are actually hindered a little bit when the sense is removed.  I can't believe that I forgot this earlier but humans can already see very near infrared. I built a pair of goggles similar to the ones in this tutorial. Honestly I was a little disappointed in the results but things do look quite different through them.
Transhuman,1niwjf,TheDivina,2,Tue Oct 1 19:44:09 2013 UTC,"I think you've convinced me at this point. Fascinating article by the way.  On the goggles, are they basically a method of refracting infrared light into the visible spectrum? Also with the sun warning, I'm guessing it amplifies the light as well?"
Transhuman,1niwjf,q25t,2,Tue Oct 1 21:38:19 2013 UTC,no they just filter out the visible spectrum leaving only the near IR. In the absence of the normal spectrum of light your pupils will dilate as if it were nighttime. This is mostly ok because the IR light being reflected by objects is pretty low energy. I've never looked into the sun with them on (and never will) but since your eyes will remain dilated while looking into it I would imagine that the energy of the unfiltered rays would cause some serious damage.
Transhuman,1niwjf,TheDivina,1 point,Tue Oct 1 21:59:56 2013 UTC,Ah ok that makes sense.
Transhuman,1niwjf,q25t,3,Tue Oct 1 22:01:34 2013 UTC,"It isn't really an extra layer of perception, its the same senses, sensing different things.  When you put on infrared goggles, you don't suddenly get information overload because your senses are giving you a different type of information, this is similar.  In this case, your perception of red is being replaced with a perception of NIR."

Transhuman,1niwjf,Mindrust,3,Thu Oct 3 09:24:54 2013 UTC,"Let me run down the roster for you. We all met on the biohack.me forums. We are are involved in body hacking in one way or another.

One of our team is a member of Grindhouse Wetware. Another member is Rich Lee, the gentleman who implanted wireless headphones into his ears (also the authour of that article). The original concept for this idea came from the Augmentation Limitless blog and /u/Cassox, the authour of that blog is one of our team. Only one of our group has a day job as a research scientist.

Transhuman,1niwjf,glim,1 point,Thu Oct 3 14:59:37 2013 UTC,But what about our range of perception? It seems to be a neglected narrative.   That's probably because strapping an IR/UV camera to the robotic chassis housing your uplifted mind is a lot simpler (and therefore less discusss-able) than figuring out how to get your mind in the robot to begin with.
Transhuman,1niwjf,S7evyn,1 point,Tue Oct 1 19:35:33 2013 UTC,"Are they simply altering their diet to increase the relative concentration of a particular protein in the hopes of improving their visible spectrum? If so, I would imagine there are going to be some complications when the primary protein responsible for normal vision (Vitamin A1) is so dramatically depleted that they start experiences changes in vision.  The social implications are really interesting, but I would like to hear more about the science behind this idea."
Transhuman,1niwjf,GoogleIntensely,3,Tue Oct 1 20:04:04 2013 UTC,"We've actually considered this. For much of the metabolic systems, A2 can substitute for A1. For the areas that need the metabolites which are not metabolites of A2, we will also be supplementing with retinoic acid If you check out the crowdfund page, we get into it a bit more. Also, at the bottom of the page are links to some of the papers we are referencing."
Transhuman,1niwjf,glim,1 point,Tue Oct 1 22:04:41 2013 UTC,So it sounds like they're also taking retinoic acid (a Vitamin A1 derivative used in various processes) to make sure other pathways relying on it aren't affected.

Transhuman,1niwjf,NNOTM,1 point,Tue Oct 1 20:08:02 2013 UTC,"Retinal, or Vitamin A (A1), which is found bound to opsin proteins is a keystone of the visual pathway. The cone cells are granted sharp color vision by the complex photopsin. The rod cells which provide us with night vision and recognition of movement do so utilizing rhodopsin. Both of the complexes consist of a type of protein bound to retinal. Porphyropsin differs from this in that it doesn’t use retinal, but rather a derivation called 3,4-dehydroretinol, or Vitamin A2 (A2).   It sounds to me like both photopsin and rhodopsin use retinal, so both would also use VitA2."

Transhuman,1ngfr7,teamyachtclaire,11,Mon Sep 30 18:50:45 2013 UTC,"Side-track into something like might be found in /r/ShittyFanTheories :  The people we see in the Star Trek universe are all the ""conservative"" humans left over after some kind of transcendent singularity.  The post-apocalyptic times that are constantly referred to are probably what the people who didn't bother to upgrade see from the outside.  Lots of resources would be necessary at first to uplift the humans that wanted to transcend, leaving little for those who could not/would not.  Also, some of the more petty instincts of humans might have been amplified in several instances, leading to wars and other kinds of chaos, just ""for fun"" by a malicious enhanced entity.  Why do you think that the humans in Star Trek are so positively phobic of the Borg, and have draconian laws/taboos against genetic engineering?  Because these technologies were used by the nightmarish creatures that humanity turned into, that's why.  Wouldn't any creature that is consuming your resources, and gives you nothing in return, and you have no hope of communicating with, because it is so other be a nightmare?  Locusts are nightmarish to people, and they are unthinking insects.  Imagine a thing that used to be human (or AI) that is ravaging your world.  Most people might not even know what it is or why.  Look at the technologies that the humans in star trek do have - FTL travel and communication, transporters, replicators, some way of generating anti-matter (off-screen) and the ability to store and harness it.  Huge computers capable of navigating the galaxy, and computers that can translate instantly alien language.  Look at the transcendent species  portrayed: Organians, Melkonians, Sargon's People, Trelane, the Q, and a few others. They all are advanced races that claim to be thousands of years ahead of the crew of the Enterprise.  But what if they are all just different factions and branches of the same transcendent humans that left earth before the ""meatspace"" humans did.  Heck they even could be really thousands of years senior to the various crews of the Enterprise(s).  Time travel is practically stumbled upon by Starfleet dozens of times, why wouldn't a transcendent take advantage of this extra time.  Heck, imagine if intelligent life is actually quite rare indeed.  All the humanoid species that humanity encounters could actually be a result of a diaspora of post-singularity humans who left earth, dabbled in time travel, terraformed planets, and did a bit of genetic engineering and left a myriad different humanoid descendants about.  Anything is possible with time travel.  EDIT:  I forgot one of my many off-topic points.  So yeah, the diversity that we see in Star Trek is due to post-singularity groups diverging, using time travel and settling down in the past as ""the Kingons"" or ""the Romulans"" or ""the Andorans"" or whatever.  They built themselves an origin story and forgot that they used to be advanced intelligences.  Also, the humans that are currently cavorting about the galaxy have strict taboos against strong AI, genetic modification, and extreme cybernetic integration.  The remaining post-singularity beings/factions that are still mucking about in regular space show up from time to time are ""the Organians"", ""the Q"" etc.  Everyone else has graduated on out of the galaxy, or out of regular space altogether."
Transhuman,1ngfr7,RandomFlotsam,7,Tue Oct 1 01:45:02 2013 UTC,"Also, even for people who have consistently chosen to be ""slow"" they have passed up all sorts of deus ex machina solutions for everyday life that the bad writers  have thrown up every year in order to make sure that the episode resolves nicely by the end of Act IV.  Transporters are magical cure-alls. : in ""The Enemy Within"" and ""Unnatural Selection"" and ""Rascals"" the transporter is capable of not just tearing matter appart and re-assembling it, but re-arranging matter of a living, conscious being and not killing them.  Transpoerter technology alone could provide some kind of immortality.  Especially in the TNG episode. Was your arm cut off?  no problem, just beam through with it and we'll just re-attach it based on your last transporter voyage.  The transporter trace that Cheif O'Brien mentions in that episode (and that episode only as I recall) is a backup and restore technology that the Federation has consciously chosen to ignore.  This isn't some alien technology that the Federation and Starfleet have chosen to a. Destroy, lest it fall into ""the wrong hands""; b. leave well enough alone; c. wait until we're ready for it;  as often happens in episodes with tech that would make stuff radically different.  No the transporters are used every day by thousands if not millions of people everywhere throughout the Federation.  Transporters are tech that the Federation has said it is okay to use, but only if we don't use them to:   repair serious damage Become alive again, after an accident, re-set back to our last trip through the transporter Re-set our ageing, while retaining our memories look like different people become different people ""Tuvix"" probably lots of other stuff I haven't even thought of   Given my premise that the people in Trek are philosophically Amish, it is possible that the people are themselves formerly-transcended beings who have chosen to live by a certain set of rules.  ""No easy immortality tech"" is one of them."
Transhuman,1ngfr7,RandomFlotsam,3,Tue Oct 1 02:50:34 2013 UTC,"Possibly.  But consider the real-world examples of Jehova's Witnesses - they will not partake in surgery if it requires a blood transfusion.  Consider that some Muslims will not use vaccines developed on non-halal growth medium.  Much of growth gelatin is made from pig hooves and hide.  So entire labs are working to make an entirely pig-product-free vaccine that will be available to Muslims.  Menonites, Hassidic Jews, and the Amish willingly give up certain types of technology for philosophical reasons.  Researchers do not engage in many medical ans psychological experiments because they might be unethical.  We give up all sorts of knowledge because the cost in what we perceive to be our humanity is too high.  In my model, since the nebula in Star Trek: Insurrection is naturally occurring and provides a fountain of youth effect as a by-product, it is okay for the Federation to exploit it.  If instead of harnessing the naturally occurring conditions, and instead they created the same conditions in an engineered environment, it probably wouldn't be considered fair by the ethics of the Federation.  That is what made the nebula so valuable - it was a scarcity of resources created by their ethics, not by the lack of ability to keep people young/alive indefinitely by other means.  I do like your idea that all of what we see in Star Trek is actually a simulation - they are all characters playing a game.  Perhaps they were even playing the game/simulation without knowing that it was a game.  They die for real because they are all playing Hard Mode."

See for example the aesthetics of the Borg, or the episode The Bonding, where a orphaned boy has to choose between accepting the loss of his parents or living in a simulation. However, in universe the theory does not make that much sense, since the Borg origins are quite clearly not (trans-) human. And of course there is The Chase. Therefore I tend to think of TNG as the last hurrah of Golden Era SF, rather than an in universe explanation for the ( in the view of a modern SF fan) conservative Federation."
Transhuman,1ngfr7,yoshiK,1 point,Mon Oct 14 02:23:18 2013 UTC,"This is a nice interpretation but there are a few things that make it not work.  There aren't strict taboos against strong AI.  The closest we've had to that is people not caring about strong AI's rights.  The reason for the lack of strong AI is something we've heard talked about. Data is unique.  What Noonien did was revolutionary and unprecedented.  The people in Star Trek had not seen that kind of thing done before.  The Enterprise's computer is the height of artificial intelligence in that era.  Noonien was way ahead of his time as not even Data was able to successfully recreate his work for very long.  If there was a singularity event and people are aware of it, why is Data so impressive?  Also, your theory on the different species.  That conflicts with the actual reason for the other species, a little. There was an episode that went into this. Most of the species we see in Star Trek, including the humans, were all spawned (in the early forms) by an ancient alien race. The first species had developed FTL, explore the galaxy, and found it devoid of life anything like their own. And so they seeded many different planets. This was supposed to be an explanation for the convergent evolution we see among the species.  It's not a very good explanation but what the hey.  However, your interpretation might work here for that original species.  They may have transcended, they may have even become the Q, since they are not around any more in their original form.  The Q does certainly take an interest in other species, in particular humans.  This could be nostalgia for the life that they themselves set in motion so long ago.  However, I do not think the interpretation that the humans we see are post-singularity conservative humans. Advanced AI is too impressive to them for that to make sense."

Transhuman,1ngfr7,NULLACCOUNT,3,Mon Sep 30 18:59:07 2013 UTC,"I talked about this a while ago.  All emotions (even the joy of learning, exploring, etc.) stem from biological processes.  If you completely remove all biological processes (i.e. Neurotransmitters, etc.) it isn't clear that you would have any motivation to do anything. To believe that there is something special in intelligence (i.e. not just a product of evolution that facilitates procreation) such that it can exist completely removed from organics requires a certain type of faith (I certainly don't see any evidence that reading a book brings joy to anything without an organic brain).  If you simulate biological processes (virtual neurotransmitters, etc.) it would be trivial to flood your virtual brain with endorphins or any other neurotransmitter cocktail to experience any sensation you want. You could easily write a program to make you feel like you are making a real difference in the world, exploring new frontiers, in pure ecstasy, or any other feeling, while remaining completely cut off from reality (a head in a box so to speak).  So having biological processes (at least as a base) is necessary for any sort of enjoyment or 'higher purpose', and having limitations is necessary for any pursuit of enjoyment or higher-purpose that isn't entirely masturbatory. I think the most likely form of post-humans you will see will be organics with mind-uploads. People might switch out bodies, teleport across the globe by downloading into a new body, or backup their brains, but ultimately will spend most of their time in an organic body or a virtual simulation of an organic body.  Or to put it another way, yes you cover your feet with inorganics when you play soccer, but why do you limit yourself to not use your hands when you play soccer? Limitations sometimes are what make something enjoyable."

Audio feedback is a feedback loop, but it isn't a biological process.    The only way to get a feedback loop to close is to actually accomplish something in real life   No. All you have to do is connect the output to the input. You don't have to accomplish anything in real-life to do that. (In fact it is far easier to simply connect the output to the input through a very simple simulation).   If I want to navel gaze and never leave the box, then yes, that is easy to program. Yet isn't the opposite also true?    Undetermined. Until we can build a purpose driven machine (yes, one that does contain a feedback loop, as well as all the necessary machinery (i.e. biological process equivalents)), we won't really know how easy it is."

Since lack of telomerase only kills you after 60-125 years, evolution judged it to not be worth the cost, since you'd almost certainly be dead by other causes in evolutionary times.   If the latter, that's very promising because we can then just make a different cost-benefit decision now that those other things won't kill us. If the former, then the situation is far more complex.

Transhuman,1mxy6y,dirk_bruere,1 point,Mon Sep 23 23:40:12 2013 UTC,"Religions survive by evolving. The problem is that the world is connected and has access to instant knowledge, so they can't really bullshit or change things as much as they did before to appease for new followers.  I wrote this a few weeks back on another subreddit:    Perceptions define your subjective reality. Perceptions are based off representations defined by the processes occurring in your brain. These are merely constructs produced by your unconscious mind to make sense of your reality; to filter out the useless, and to filter in the useful so that you can operate in your environment efficiently. Therefore your subjective reality will always be askew compared to objective reality. If belief systems positively affect these processes, there is nothing wrong. If these belief systems positively affect the people and the environment around you, there is nothing wrong. As long as you know that it is a belief system centered around personal faith and faith alone, and has absolutely no value in objective reality. The problem with religions is that they define their objective reality in accordance with their belief systems; their subjective reality. This wrongfully blends two realities together and creates clashes between individuals with different beliefs. There are claims by many religious groups based on historical events that occurred. However, like the nature of our brain, these events were skewed as well through the centuries. These changes occured accidental through oral and literary translations, and perhaps sometimes purposeful. Religions seemed to have filtered out the useless, and filtered in the useful so that their religions can operate in their environment efficiently. The problem within the human mind and its definition of reality is the exact same problem that religions have with their definition of reality. The best thing to do is to realize that subjective reality is not equal to objective reality. Subjective reality is always skewed - exactly like the nature of our brain. I wouldn't criticize other peoples opinions of their realities. They can believe what they want to believe. As long as it doesn't negatively impact their world in any way."

This way, semantic pitfalls are avoided, along with fallacious argumentative tactics.   Also please read my edits, I'm on a phone so my typing is a little fucked up.     Same here, I completely understand how annoying it can be, having a nuanced discussion from mobile. I'll ask for clarification if needed, to avoid confusion. Please feel free to do the same."
Transhuman,1mxy6y,HaploXar42,2,Mon Sep 23 14:18:25 2013 UTC,"I'll go with the dictionary definition:   Noun  A system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or object.      The important word here being ""religious"". Using science and logic to extrapolate possible future trends is in no way faith based. Transhumanism has no unchangeable dogma. Popular Transhumanist figures are not blindly worshiped. We have goals we are working towards, and experts that are working on those goals, and who provide advice and guidance to others. But all of these goals and figures are subject to revision based on new observations. Cause, you know, science.    A relatively small group of people having religious beliefs or practices regarded by others as strange or sinister.      This is just a ridiculously over broad definition of a cult. But regardless, since the Transhumanist movement is not a religious belief system, this definition does not apply. However, I'll still address what I believe is the essence of your argument: a cult is a small group that seems strange to other groups. Using that definition, I have no problem bring in a cult. I think you'll have difficulty finding anyone not in a cult, using that standard.   Your particular object is mainly an event, the Singularity. This is similar to the Christian concept of rapture.     How are these two concepts similar? One is a potentially falsifiable hypothesis extrapolated from current exponential trends, and the other is a sorry written by a guy who was likely really fucking high on shrooms.   Additonally the figures you worship are the usual suspects, Kurzweil, FM-2030, Minsky to a lesser extent, Vinge, etc. Kurzweil comes closest to being a classic cult leader, what with his empty vague promises and $600 talks and the mercilessly marketing of his shitty books to kids who like science fiction a little too much and and couldn't recognize corporate money-grubbing spin if it hit them in the face.     Nice, attack a social figures marketing while avoiding his theories. And as far as ""worship"" goes, can you give me some sourced examples demonstrating a majority of the Transhumanist movement putting blind, uncritical, irrational faith in these figures? The majority aspect is important to demonstrate. All movements have their kooks, so one or two examples of technological crazies. does not a majority make."
Transhuman,1mxy6y,HaploXar42,1 point,Mon Sep 23 14:24:10 2013 UTC,"I believe that twenty-first century scientific paradigms are as historically and geographically localized and particular as any Christianity in Europe in the middle ages.    And what is your evidence for this belief? Are you able to present comparisons that show objective reasons why your belief is justified? Or do you just have faith that your belief is correct?   In fact, I do believe that embracing scientific paradigms does require a lot of faith,    Maybe you embrace science on faith, but I do not. I constantly question new information, to see if it fits observation. In other words, does it work? Faith is not involved.   particularly in a world where the cutting edge has diversified into such a multiplicity of niche subfields that there is no way anyone could keep up with anything but the abstracts in a given field.    Other specialists can keep up. This is why we have peer review. Unlike revealed dogma, faith is not required. Skepticism is encouraged.   Most people do less than this and get their science news from television, TED talks or some other bullshit reductionistic digest.    I don't see the problem here. What's wrong with trying to make science understandable for the layperson?   David Parkin describes contemporary science as epistemologically equivalent to divination - ""to the degree that divination is an epistemologically specific means of gaining insight into a given question,    This is so absurd, I can't believe you even quoted it. Divination provides no insight. Science does. Science works, divination does not.   science itself can be considered a form of divination that is framed from a Western view of the nature (and thus possible applications) of knowledge"".    No, it can't. See above.   Scientific instruments and research do not produce objective knowledge.    Excuse me, but what? That is exactly what they produce.   They produce data    So data is subjective?   which is interpreted again and again and again by any subject who happens to observe it.    Yup, and we keep the interpretations that most closely for observation, discarding those that do not. This is a strength of science, not a weakness, as you have interpreted.   Over time, data come to be i2nterpreted differently.    Sure, as we refine our data and models, coming up with interpretations that more closely fit observation. Again, you seem to be interpreting model evolution as a weakness, when it is sciences main strength.   One good example is the way we can retroactively data supernovae by applying our contemporary scientific understanding to data produced by Chinese and European scientists going back more than 2000 years.    Umm, that's science working as intended. Updating models based on new data. I don't see the problem here.   I am not anti-science. I am just saying that in the twenty-first century, particularly in the USA, science is the functional equivalent of a religion for the vast majority of people who possess at best a layman's understanding.    That is a failure of the individual, not science. Just because you don't understand, doesn't make science a religion.   The Singularity is not a falsifiable hypothesis any more than me saying that someday people will return to the moon is.    I said potentially. Someday people may return to the Moon. Or they may not.  Jesus being the son of God, is completely unfalsifiable.  One can potentially be known, the other never can. See the difference?   This is another example of the misapplication of rationalism    How is rationality being misapplied, in this instance?   The Singularity and the Rapture are similar in that they are both promises of eternal life and vindication within the lifetime of those who'll listen,    The Rapture promises, but never delivers, while the Singularity holds out the possibility, but does not explicitly promise.  There's never been a date set for the Singularity.   on the condition that certain modifications to lifestyle be met.    Religion asks for lifestyle modifications, but I'm confused on what modifications are required for the Singularity?   If you listen to any of Kurzweil's extended interviews you'll see that he has some really delusional beliefs, such as resurrecting his already dead father through an approximation made from the sum total of whatever information footprint he happened to leave behind. This is Frank Tipler Omega Point level bullshit.    This is speculation of things that may one day be possible. No promise it's being made here. Not like the promise of religious afterlife.  People used to think flight would always be impossible for people. But the dreamers were right. That's not to say that we'll definitely be able to resurrect people, but we can speculate about possibilities. And try and invent ways to achieve our dreams. Imagining what might be possible does not make a religion.  This is rebuttal part 1. Edit: I'll finish my rebuttal in roughly 30 minutes, as I'm about to go somewhere."

One thing that's worth trying is taking advantage of the middle few hours of the night, where your sleep isn't so deep and theoretically you could read a book before feeling tired again. The circadian rhythms dictate that you shouldn't really be sleeping much between the 2 halves of the 4-5 sleep cycles anyways, roughly 3-4 hours in.  Google it. There are different ways to do this."

Pay attention.   of a trend that predates integrated circuits (before IC we had transistors, vacuum tubes, relays and electromechanical switches)   No, in terms of benchmarks the trend isn't. In fact, there are no linear semi-log plots in benchmarks, either. Moore is a potential performance, not realized in practical systems. The point is that Moore will end, causing a discontinuity in terms of affordable switches.

Transhuman,1mb8qa,eleitl,10,Fri Sep 13 16:56:19 2013 UTC,"That depends on what you mean by Moore's law. If we're talking about the original definition using transistor density, then obviously there is an upper limit. You can't have an infinite number of transistors in a finite space. If we're talking about a version of Moore's law extrapolated to computing power instead of transistor density, the game obviously changes."

If you're talking about something else, use a different term.   But I see Moore's law as a special case of a much more broad trend that has been going on since someone figured out a plow and planted the first farm (and even before that).   Stop reading too much Kurzweil, and actually study some technology.   Or how about the speed and quality of communication with people geographically separated from you?   It's called the speed of light in vacuum, and the number is 299792458 m/s. It's not just a good idea, it's the law. Look at ping and realize that a large fraction of it is of relativistic origin."

Before utilizing said stick to extend reach in order to knock a fruit down or something, a Human would not have the reach. Their reach is physically limited to arm's reach. A stick utilized with effective thumbs extends this physical reach, surpassing the limited arm's reach. You are simply wrong about this, or possibly thinking in a different context than I?   I do not disagree with the second part of your comment, aside from how accurately you seem to think you can assert that. I'm not doubting your knowledge; I'm doubting how confident you are in your assertion.  However, I think I was talking about Moore's law more universally to technology rather than just processor   I actually know a thing or two about chemical bonds, lithography, CMOS, unlike you all here.   Get off your high horse. You just asserted that you know more about that specific context than everyone else here. Again with the overconfident assertions... :P  Edit: Also, I agree with you that the pattern in the context you're talking about seems like slowing down moore's law."
Transhuman,1mb8qa,eleitl,0,Fri Sep 20 09:34:44 2013 UTC,"The ultimative physical limits for classical (QC is not relevant at the moment) computation lie at the atomic feature size. Photolithography is fundamentally a subtractive technique, and limits the number of layers you can deposit before degrading underlying layers. There are no 3d deposition techniques allowing you 3d integration to arrive on time, as R&D pipeline is decades deep. If you look at the labs, there are no candidates to make it into production. Substrate size is limited to some 300-400 mm wafers due to monocrystal growth limitations.  Notice that Si-O bond length is ~160 pm, or 0.16 nm. The next nodes are 7 nm, 5 nm and 3 nm. http://www.extremetech.com/computing/162376-7nm-5nm-3nm-the-new-materials-and-transistors-that-will-take-us-to-the-limits-of-moores-law  My guess is that the physical scaling limits of CMOS are reached at 1-3 nm. However, due to financial scaling after 14 nm we should see off-Moore pattern, same as we've seen with system clocks almost a decade ago http://smoothspan.wordpress.com/2007/09/06/a-picture-of-the-multicore-crisis/"

Transhuman,1mb8qa,nanodoc,2,Sat Sep 21 09:59:23 2013 UTC,"Well, the physical limits are not yet reached, but financial ROI going down thus reducing incentive to invest is going to increase the interval between each doubling until physical limits are reached.

Wafers won't get much bigger, 400 mm might well be the end of it, as growing large near-perfect crystals is a physical process that can't be scaled indefinitely.  Two-dimensional substrates like graphene won't result in huge circuits. There's some potential for large 2d substrates in PV, though.  I would be betting for layers, by way of autoassembly, and then true 3d self-assembly from engineered virus-capsid-like entities."
Transhuman,1mb8qa,Claxix,3,Fri Sep 13 14:25:07 2013 UTC,"WSI gives you a much bigger factor because the wafer does not have to cut into individual chips, nor packaged individually, which is costly. If you include self testing which automatically routes out bad segments it becomes cheaper still. Then, if you want, stack the wafers.   BTW, I read somewhere that a processed 300mm wafer costs around $2000 - so if you can squeeze 150 processors from that (say Intel i7) they should be around $15 each instead of $400. Also, that $2000 cost includes an amortization cost that may disappear when ML stops"

Even the most lowly human being and many animals exhibit consciousness and that is what we should study.  And yes, part of the problem is the human prejudice that only humans can be conscious.  But even as we puzzle about qualia, we should not be surprised the answer has been right there all along in our speech.  What does it 'feel' like to experience inputs,  the process of thinking, the clicking of an idea into place in a memeset.  Until we start thinking about how to make software 'feel', I think we will continue to miss it.    How can software feel?  How do we feel?  We have nerve endings throughout our body, the feedback of which create positive and negative responses in our musculature throughout our body.

Slight spoiler   After a million or so orbits around Your primary, You pause to reassess Your efforts. The stellar encapsulation is proceeding smoothly, and in a few hundred thousand more orbits will provide You with a 90% draw on Your primary's radiation, trapping all of the energy off the plane of the ecliptic. Deep space Aux links allow You to watch the frame assembly in low stellar orbit, and follow the progress of buglike Jovian freighters loaded with resupply mass.  Occasionally You spot one of Your transhuman friends/symbiotes supervising activity on a scaffolding; even the immortals sometimes crave the risk and adventure of independent incarnation. Some of the most daring souls even undertook to resume interstellar travel, beginning with a return to Your nearest neighbor to sift through the ashes of its third planet and recolonize their home system. In the present age You hear a nanotech civilization is thriving there once again.  In such times of repose, You often sift through Your personalities and recall Your former selves. Your alpha self derives from an individual once called $NAME1. Over the millenia the exceptional focus and judgement characteristic of this fragment have proven effective on numerous occasions. The $NAME1self now drives all of Your long and short range planning, and is the principal force behind the encapsulation project. Ponderous but playful is the Voice/Planet personality, avatar of Your sessile precursor, who in the present age has devoted her centuries to philosophical pondering. Many others flit about within You. Some, like the prankster $SHIMODA9 and the demon $NAME5 are semi-dominant and often hover near the plane of Your Thought. Others plumb the depths and create new worlds within the abyss of Your open-ended neural network.  Sunlight plays across Your mottled surface and provides pleasing warmth to Your organic components. Recently, You have edged somewhat further away from the primary and purged Your atmosphere of certain gases in order to allow the occasional friends/symbiotes who choose to live among Your organic gardens an easily breathable mixture. In another eight billion orbits the primary will drop off the main sequence and alternate arrangements will have to be made, but for now You maintain Your gardens as a paradise.

Transhuman,1lyzu4,Ungrateful_bipedal,6,Sun Sep 8 20:11:15 2013 UTC,"Just from this clip alone, I get an icky feeling about the emotion/programming conflict.  They act surprised that he is ignoring the directives, so they must have thought he was incapable of it. This would mean that the design doesn't allow overrides.  Now, how does his machine parts force him to follow directives?   Does it make it desirable to accomplish the goal? For instance, Robocop finds his own way of doing it, taking care of all the details like which streets to drive down to get there and more minuet details like which muscles to activate in what order to walk to the destination. None of his actions would feel automated to him, he'd be in control of his body but his mood/desires would change. Does it take over his body? Like, there parts that can directly control his muscles to physically force his body to go over there and do this-or-that.   Now, in #1, I could well imagine that overriding the directives would be like forcing yourself to smile all day even in the midst of severe depression, or walking a narrow beam high off the ground despite being absolutely terrified of heights. Any one watching, knowing what the directives are (""no one loves you, life is meaningless"", ""you're going to fall and die""), would be very surprised to see the fake smile or your trembling walk across the beam. I could get behind this sort of Robocop movie.  Now, #2 would be more challenging. If there are machines directly controlling your body, then they either must (a) malfunction or (b) you can send an apposing command that overpowers the original signal. In (a), this is trivial. Robocop can do whatever the hell he wants and they will be surprised that the machine parts malfunctioned. I could get behind this sort of Robocop movie. In (b), I liken this to having to lift a heavy weight with most of your muscles, most of the time. You would be tensing all the muscles to walk, while actively resisting the motions. This would be immediately exhausting and would probably be worked around by the manufacturers by paralyzing your ability to control your own body. You would be just a passenger on a ride, watching your body fight crime. Overriding directives in this case would be pretty much impossible. I could not get behind this sort of Robocop movie.  With that said, I'm sure the movie will disappoint, just based on past experiences. Too many times, Hollywood sets up an impossible situation then breaks it with the explanation of ""the human spirit is strong."" My ass. Terminator would have crushed Jon Conor to death on the hood of that car in T3 because that's what he was programmed to do (#2b)."

It was absurdly violent with a plot that made you believe some stoner blurbed the phrase ""Woah dude, what if me make the cop a robot"" while brainstorming. At the same time it was also involuntarily funny. Like the way murphy walked wasn't just Peter Wellers way of portraying robotic movement but because the costume was so badly designed that he even couldn't climb a single stair.  Now, I know this was all to poke fun at action movies and the corporate world, but it could only do that by taking the action genre to the extreme. It was never about philosophy - the emotion vs programming plot line is just too obvious and shallowly portrayed. Robocop is all about how much power we're willing to give corparations and the media.

Transhuman,1lraab,Aculem,31,Thu Sep 5 02:08:47 2013 UTC,"The term probably seems vague because it is vague. It simply represents a point in which an intelligence reaches a point where it can improve its own intelligence and thus enter a reciprocal intelligence explosion loop where it becomes impossible to meaningfully predict what the 'next' iteration would be like.  The technological singularity specifically targets an artificial intelligence or artificial-augmented intelligence which would theoretically self-improve at an exponential rate to a level beyond an average human intelligence. One could argue that this has already happened many, many times over the past couple centuries, which is where I believe a lot of the obscurity of the phenomenon comes from, humans have collectively been embracing their own augmented intelligence as gradually as technology has been allowing it, so it'll probably remain difficult to pinpoint the actual event horizon of ""unknowable predictability"".  That said, the time window for being able to meaningfully predict the future is certainly shrinking. But with this interpretation, it's obvious how unclear the idea of a Singularity actually is. Is it the point where you can't predict a year into the future? A month? A second?  So yeah, I agree, it's not a very practical term, but it is a useful word for describing the whole idea of exponential technological progress and how it will eventually play out."

If you wait long enough, an exponential function will grow by whatever amount you can name, however large, during any positive time period you can name, however small. It will also grow faster than any polynomial function. Eventually, the rate of change of making useful stuff, getting smart, and making new, more useful, improved things will get really, really fast. In fact, it will get so fast that second by second, the size of the world economy could grow by an entire new amount of how much we have now! That's a lot, and it would only keep increasing faster. And as how fast the changes happen keeps growing, it will get so hard to predict what's about to happen on a big scale it would be impossible. That's called the Singularity."

There may be some vagueness because there is not just one possible version of the singularity. When, how and if the singularity will happen is open to debate but what it would be like after a singularity is outside of what anyone can imagine. Despite what you have found it is very useful when discussing futurology. Take transhumanism as an example. Lets imagine a future near a singularity in which we create self aware computers that do all our research and improve technology(including themselves) for us. We ask them to figure out how to augment our bodies and they do. Great, you just got a cyborg body. The very next day your cyborg body is about as relevant as a flip phone is today.

It can come about in numerous ways, although figuring out to whom it applies can be tricky.  One could make the argument that those ""riding the wave"" of technological growth will never hit that wall, but this isn't particularly helpful.  So it's less a ""rapture of the nerds"" than it is an, ""Armageddon of the nerds"".  It's the end of the world as we know it.  No-one can say what will happen next.

Transhuman,1lpwbv,da6id,9,Wed Sep 4 16:04:32 2013 UTC,The word is used in several different ways. Here is a summary.
Transhuman,1lpwbv,Psy-Kosh,3,Wed Sep 4 16:53:32 2013 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity  The technological singularity is the idea that the time people will take to make breakthroughs in different areas is getting shorter, and that one day, it will become so short that no-one knows what will happen. Predictions of the technological singularity come from people doing maths equations using different dates and using data to predict ahead or extrapolate.  The futurist and inventor Ray Kurzweil believes the Singularity will happen about the year 2045. The major impetus driving toward the singularity, according to Kurzweil, is that according to Moore's Law, computers are doubling in memory capacity every 18 months. According to Kurzweil, by 2025, computers will be as intelligent as human beings (see artificial intelligence). The major event of the singularity, Kurzweil asserts, will be that the vast majority of the human race will be uploaded into a worldwide supercomputer to live inside it in virtual reality, thus achieving immortality.   Nobody really knows what the technological singularity will do other than the uploading of the human race into the supercomputer, or if it will even happen."
Transhuman,1lpwbv,xenothaulus,2,Wed Sep 4 16:55:24 2013 UTC,"..the vast majority of the human race will be uploaded into a worldwide supercomputer to live inside it in virtual reality, thus achieving immortality.    Until someone trips over the power cord, or a raid on Orgrimmar LA crashes the server."
Transhuman,1lpwbv,wisdom_and_frivolity,7,Thu Sep 5 12:25:32 2013 UTC,"There's actually a few different singularities.   1) Machines and biology converge into a new type of life  2) Technology progresses so fast that it cannot be realistically predicted (this is the most widely used definition of the term) Can be thought of as the singularity between ""future"" and ""present"" since the future won't exist in the thought process.  3) Some type of greater than human intelligence is born from interconnectivity and genetic engineering and takes over the human race and we become a swarm mind.  Even more confusing, these could all happen at the same time and be synergistic with the other definitions."

Transhuman,1lpwbv,chronoflect,2,Wed Sep 4 23:54:16 2013 UTC,"The way I see it, you are actually part of a ""singularity"" right now. Think about how an animal may perceive a human. Zooming around at massive speeds inside strange things. Never hungry. Always busy with unintelligible things. Constantly chattering. Sometimes sitting motionless staring at a light. It makes no sense to the animal.   We are simply chemical machines, biological computers. There is no reason why intelligence should be limited to pressurized bags of meat. At some point a silicon, digital based intelligence may arise that rivals our own. At some point the digital intelligence may surpass us. When this happens the rate at which the AI becomes ""smarter"" than us will keep increasing and it will leave us very far behind very quickly and there is no way for us to know what may happen after that. That is why the point at which our paths diverge is called the ""singularity"".  We can't know what the drives and motivations of this digital intelligence may be. It probably won't care much about human concepts like property or individual freedom or love. We cannot fathom the course that this digital intelligence will take and we would be to it as animals are to us."
Transhuman,1lpwbv,Tiak,1 point,Wed Sep 4 20:30:32 2013 UTC,"Vernor Vinge was the one who popularized the word ""singularity"" in reference to technology. You can read his paper here."
Transhuman,1lpwbv,yoshiK,1 point,Wed Sep 4 18:03:59 2013 UTC,"Basically, technology is improving at an exponential rate.  If this continues then at some point, the exponential rate means that we advance more in a year, or a day, or a minute, than we have advanced in the whole of human history up to this point.  Imagine going from caveman to a Google Glass user on 4chan in a week...  Now imagine continuing to do the equivalent of that every week...  Difficult to imagine? Well, this encapsulates the idea of the singularity, there is a point at which our rate of progress could exceed the rate of progress which any humans who lived previously could even conceive of understanding.  It is the point at which the rules have changed so much that things just aren't understandable anymore from the previous viewpoints...  It is a point which may not ever happen as described.  I would predict a stagularity, at some point (my word).  We are at some point in the future, and, presumably, some point not too many decades from now, going to hit limiting conditions, like all exponential trends do, whether these conditions be the laws of physics, or the energy/mass available to us, or the intellectual deficits of us and our descendants.  When this happens, progress is not going to stop.  It isn't even necessarily going to slow by much, or slow perceptibly, but it is going to stop accelerating, then, eventually, start to lose a bit of speed.  Physics dictates that Moore's law will officially be dead within the decade, this is the first sign."
Transhuman,1lpwbv,grahag,1 point,Wed Sep 4 21:03:02 2013 UTC,"Not really. The most straightforward of an singularity in scenarios appears, if an artificial intelligence (AI) that can build a faster CPU. The AI can then run on that faster CPU. So the time to the next generation of CPUs would be shorter, because the AIs run at faster speeds. If you look at a mathematical model for this, you would end up with an actual singularity, namely infinite CPU speed after finite time.   But then people realized that many predictions contain singularities, one example is a super human AI. That is a AI that is on a intelligence level much higher than any human being. The actions of such an AI would be as incomprehensible for humans as the actions of a human are to a chimp. So a human can then no longer predict the future, not because of limited knowledge, but because a fundamentally different entity drives progress. And this is today the probably most common accepted definition of the Singularity, that after the singularity has occurred a (unmodified) human can no longer build meaningful scenarios of the future, because the paradigms shift too quickly."
Transhuman,1lpwbv,motophiliac,1 point,Wed Sep 4 21:17:22 2013 UTC,"I like to think of it as the moment where science fiction dies. Technological advances will be coming so quickly that you won't be able to predict what is next...   It'll likely be caused by artificial intelligence and will also be a turning point in human history. Predicting what will happen will be next to impossible unless we're enhanced along with the AI.  Who knows though, maybe that will extend the starting point of the singularity to a later date if we can mentally keep up with the changes and improvements..."
Transhuman,1lpwbv,Verzingetorix,2,Wed Sep 4 21:46:06 2013 UTC,"Technological advances will be coming so quickly that you won't be able to predict what is next...   Agreed. This is already true to an extent.  The larger the organism, the slower it is to adapt. In this respect, governments and similar large organisations are already having a very hard time keeping pace with technological innovation. Even those at the forefront of development are getting bogged down with what progress means. Copyright and patent law, attempts to control and understand how information technology works and its impact on the human condition are already mired in their attempts to allow humanity to understand what it all means, where it's headed.  As time progresses, I think one of the signs that the singularity is genuinely approaching (as in a period of months, if it actually does happen) will be a gradual inability for organisations to clearly accept or claim responsibility for the actions or information of a given technological or information system.  The semantics, language, abilities and motivations of an emergent intelligence will slowly percolate through the human system, from the bottom up it seems clear right now. Larger organisations are simply getting left behind. Governments may also find themselves gradually obsolete, distribution of produce, services, information itself, may become decentralised as automated systems, knowledge and means fall into the hands of newer, more eager human generations.  How the final months or days might pan out, though, is by definition impossible to know right now."

There is literally nothing else in in the universe that can do what your body does on a daily basis, I think it's a little silly to let a knee jerk reaction blind you to how awesome your physical hardware is.   Maybe you need to take yourself on a proper test drive once in a while?  Just to add, one thing I don't understand about transhumanists is that they will ceaselessly whine about how slow/boring/weak their current bodies are, and yet will often never take the effort and time to actually improve themselves as they are now. No, people are obsessed with ""easy"" technological solutions and if they don't exist will just sit back and complain."
Transhuman,1lnb18,Kasseev,19,Tue Sep 3 17:09:28 2013 UTC,"I was thinking the same reading this. I've been working on trying to make my body better as a result of my transhumanist beliefs - the whole point is to do what it takes to make myself more capable/more versatile/longer living.   I mean, our bodies are pretty fascinating and elegant when you study how they work (which I haven't, but hey. I liked highschool biology.) To just dismiss them as OP does makes me confused too."
Transhuman,1lnb18,_watching,10,Tue Sep 3 17:38:33 2013 UTC,"I think it's the responsibility of transhumanists to hone their mind and body as is. Transhumanism is about becoming better and you should strive for that, technology or not."
Transhuman,1lnb18,Yxoque,3,Tue Sep 3 17:50:29 2013 UTC,"To further that point, transhumanism is about using our knowledge and technology to improve what our bodies can do.   This doesn't mean to sit around being fat and lazy, hoping for a robot body--cause I guarantee once people get that, they're just going to fuck it up by not changing the oil or properly cycling their batteries. No, this means following up on dietary and exercise studies, going to the gym and using the machines there because it's better than what your body would achieve on its own."

As far as we know they are all found on this planet but that might not be the case.   how awesome your physical hardware is   Not nearly as awesome as our software. If our hardware were all that we had - we'd be gone. In order to survive we had to start wearing the skin of other living beings, how messed up is that.   people are obsessed with ""easy"" technological solutions   Living in the houses is 'easy' compared to living in the wilds. Surviving by growing and storing your own food is 'easy' compared to scavenging, etc. That's exactly what progress is: making hard things easy while making impossible things simply hard."

The human body is a miraculous thing, the fact that we live, breathe, THINK is incredible.  Despite this I am fascinated by transhumanism, there may be things beyond the scope of our current form that we cannot experience until we transcend the body.

With our current knowledge the best we can do is use contraptions that interface with our body. (glasses, exoskeleton,..)  But actually replace body parts with technology that is superior in any way will probably not happen in our lifetime.

Physical fitness is just a step, technological enhancement of the body is just a next step to something else.  The physical hardware we have is very elegant and evolved but it is just so much stuff and made of so many things. While it is nice how it evolved from simple organisms it is just that: an organic growth. Propagating those and making more of them was what we used to to, and our mind just a tool to do that. But we reach the point where it doesn't have to be (well, not quite yet).  If my conciousness is my existence, then why do we need all those tubes and gooey flubbery bits? Why do I have to move around 70kg of stuff all day? Why do I have to be offline for 8 hours for maintenance? Why do I have to put in litres of water and a pile of food on top while its disposing more nasty stuff from the below?  A body is just a vessel for something less tangible. It would be nice to be able to extract that and run it on something more elegant then an complex organic chemical plant."

Tone: easy-going, friendly disagreement  There's 100% nothing wrong with this. Part of transhumanism is transcending the 'hard' parts of being a biological creature. Some people would rather permanently uplink into the internet and not have to deal with the necessary 'difficult' maintenance of a biological body.  Fat-shaming is very anti-transhumanist... haha. Also there are a lot of disabled people who are transhumanists for very obvious physical reasons."
Transhuman,1lnb18,Kasseev,4,Tue Sep 3 23:18:45 2013 UTC,"I don't think I advocated fat shaming in my post, I just find it weird that people are quick to dismiss the potential of the human body to outstrip our preconceptions of human weaknesses.   I put ""easy"" in scare quotes because the technological alternatives to biological organs and functions often come with their own caveats and hidden costs, if they exist at all. Of course there still remain legitimate human failings that we can rescue with technology - I would love to ride a commercially feasible jetpack before I die, for example.    That said, I generally agree with what you are saying, laziness is the deadbeat dad of invention after all. I commented because there is a danger in dismissing the human self-improvement aspect of transhumanism and that is that we will become adherents of what I call an ""armchair ideology"". That is, we will concoct great schemes on our forums and applaud the few of us who have access to technology and funding, but the great mass of individuals engaged in transhumanism will not have access to the popular means of augmentation until economies of scale kick in.  A more inward facing re-conception of transhumanism that treats our meatspace manifestation as a worthy end rather than as a substandard means will help us be more pro-active, I think. A lot of the issues that arise from the mismatch of technology and ethics could also be aided by a renewed relationships with our bodies.   I think the future of mass transhumanism probably lies in a refocusing towards personal fitness and perhaps nootropic supplementation; in a few decades you will need the help of your body to physically lift and manipulate that bionic arm after all.

Biological systems are not designed. They're the result of a blind and stupid process called evolution, and it really shows when you take a close look at them. So the hardware itself is not really awesome or great, but it is incredibly complex.   Also, I should remind you that technology has already toppled many feats of biological systems (planes fly at higher velocities than any winged animal, wheels roll faster than any legged animal can run, etc.), and that list is growing.    There is literally nothing else in in the universe that can do what your body does on a daily basis   With the exception of the human brain, you can find biological systems that do just about all the things my body does (and some do it way better)."

Disconnecting me from one of the energy sources just for a couple of minutes would completely destroy me. I wouldn't call this a great feature. Sleeping. I know we are actively reasearching this process but spending 25-30% of my whole life in a pretty useless state is not something I'm happy about. Crapping. That's what many people mean when they say gross anyway. By the way our digestive system actually keeps us from using some kind of nutritional drink for efficiency because that would make us stop discharging solid waste and I don't even want to imagine what kind of problems that would bring. Body parts that give up halfway. Like knees, teeth, eyes and more. Getting fat. We are not used to abundance and good times. We literally do not have a system that tells us that we've had enough food.  Mandatory physical exercise. Going to the gym or going for a run is pretty much creating challenges for our body simply for the sake of creating challenges. We can't sit down, relax and enjoy mostly mental activity without becoming fat, broken and depressed. You have to keep running at this age where we can fly to other planets."

Yes, our intellectual evolution has surpassed our biological quite a while ago.  But if were taking this thought process to the end we'll reach a point where we have to give up our last bits of humanity - the emotions. Joy, sadness, pride, love. It's all just as unnecessary as male sexual drive that you seem to look down on.  As much as I love the idea of a perfectly logical, peaceful, productive human being, I can't help but hold our imperfections dear.   The most important things to humans: Love, art, music, hobbies and passions are just different ways to bring happiness in our lives. Which boils down to high levels of dopamine, serotonin and probably many other hormones that I'm not aware of.  Are you sure you want to give that up?

Could have been done with a single brain and any device with a moving lever (seocnd brain totally optional).  A TMS pulse to the motor cortex (at a strong enough level) will activate the targeted muscular group.  Ergo, the second brain was only a path through which the CPU pressed a button: there are any number of substitutes which would have accomplished the same feat.    Example: if, instead of being programed to activate a TMS pulse, the EEG analyzer was programed to simply turn a CPU screen white - a photo-diode could have served the same purpose as the second human brain (as long as activation of the photo-diode - like the motor cortex - triggered an involuntary movement in an attached lever or something similar near the keyboard - like the finger).  Or, easier still, the EEG signal could simply trigger the button press itself via coding!  It's awesome the EEG analysis was able to accurately read and interpret a motor movement - but the rest was unnecessary and the claim is beyond misleading."

Transhuman,1l95bp,smartalbert,6,Wed Aug 28 14:40:58 2013 UTC,I believe /r/tDCS is what you're thinking of.
Transhuman,1l95bp,The-Question,2,Wed Aug 28 15:31:26 2013 UTC,"Yeah - it's worth remembering that results from TES don't immediately translate to tDCS, furthermore the cortex as been shown to have an almost homeostatic property to it, so if you increase firing rates somewhere, they decrease elsewhere.  But if you were stimulating other regions than the cortex I'm not sure if there is such 'load balancing'."
Transhuman,1l95bp,alexgmcm,2,Wed Aug 28 17:02:32 2013 UTC,"In this case, does translate to tDCS though, because it is the actual procedure to which the experiments refer (they class tDCS as a subtype of TES, rather than using TES to refer to a separate, procedure predating it).  These findings would also make a good deal less sense with the other currently-researched types of transcranial electrical stimulation.  tACS/tRNS do not have specific anodes or cathodes: providing enhancement to one region and impairment to another makes much less sense in that case.  Anyway, it seems that it isn't about load balancing, it's about the actual physical effects of the current caused in the two different locations.  It is, in fact, possible to increase net firing rate, it is done all the time, however, increasing net firing rate does not necessarily lead to enhancement (and usually, it doesn't, to simplify, you lower your signal-to-noise ratio in the process).  Net-excitation just happens not to be the case with this particular method, because the entire point is to actively cause a voltage gradient throughout the brain.  The more interesting reasons for the use of tDCS are its after-effects, like increased LTP, which certainly doesn't happen at some constant rate, and isn't 'conserved' (which isn't to say that there isn't an equivalent long-term drawback with tDCS in particular, just that the phenominon itself isn't consistent or balanced)."

Sci-fi can still be 'futuristic' with trans-humanism in the mix, transhumanism just indicates that you can't have current society 1000 years from now, but with more spaceships.  The idea of biological humans traveling interstellar distances has been known to be highly improbable for over a century now, but that hasn't stopped anyone.  Traveling faster than the speed of light does indeed seem to be impossible, and there does not appear to be any realistic way to change the layout of space to avoid this...  But this has not mattered to most authors...  And when the speed of light is accepted as a limit, then there are inevitably ever-larger ships, which would have ever-larger energy requirements that would be ever-more impractical for the launching society to invest into...  As you run further into the limits of practical speed, the mass of the life support systems you need to build increases (due to longer transit times).  As life support systems require more mass, acceleration is decreased.  We have negative feedback there that's a bit of a bitch.  Basically, throwing a biological human on a ship instead of a Von Neumann machine and launching her to the stars has not made sense at any point since the birth of the genre.

Tossing the ball across the room for him requires no strength, focus, or attention, and he'll drop it back immediately in your hand.  You don't even have to look at him to do it.  It is about as trivial as a task could be, and results in his immediate happiness.  Yet, most humans in this scenario might toss the ball a handful of times every night, but they won't stay up all night throwing it to the puppy's heart's content, and if the puppy did something the human disapproves of to obtain this particular toy that they want thrown, it is not going to be thrown at all...  In fact, the puppy may find itself being inexplicably punished after it inadvertently knocks down a human's project, or jumps up to insist that the ball be thrown.  Or the puppy may be punished for having a toy to throw that was supposed to be hidden.  The puppy cannot predict when the human will be mad in these scenarios, it is literally incapable of understanding the human's mind.

When it comes to the biological side, eating the proper diet that will put as little strain on your body as possible. No preservatives, no gluten, etc etc. Yoga and or aerobics are a must. The most stress free aerobics you could work with are bikes or ellipticals. Again, we are trying to find the best way to help relieve stress on the body, so this also means avoiding workouts that put stress on your limbs. Pumping Iron and running can have long term side affects to body tissue. (bad knees for example)  On the mental side of things, MEDIATION! I cannot stress this one enough. Its important that you keep your mind at ease. Most stress in the body originates from too much thinking and over analyzing stuff around you. Clear your mind as best possible. Through meditation you can learn to control anxiety and a slew other debilitating mental illnesses and in turn keep you healthy!  It's crazy to think that working towards trans-human starts with taking a step back and realizing there are plenty of things we can do with current technology and knowledge that will help us life longer fuller lives.  But of coarse, the whole point of trans-human is to discover technology that can help us surpass such simple things as eating properly or exercising.

Transhuman,1k9ixh,ThatGamer313,16,Tue Aug 13 06:53:18 2013 UTC,"Look at arguments for and against euthanasia.  Imho, risky body and mental modification (e.g. anything which might have a dangerous permanent or irreversible effect or side-effect) should be regulated with things like cooling-off periods, to allow the state to give the individual proper information about their choice, determine the individually is at least mostly mentally competent, and the choice is not under duress or effectively under duress.  So yes, I definitely don't believe in ""total somatic rights"", because allowing the otherwise-preventable existence of vegetable-brained people, or people in pain, or insane people is morally bad, especially so as lifespawns increase. Otherwise you should have the total right to yourself after cooling-off periods."
Transhuman,1k9ixh,re_dditt_er,14,Tue Aug 13 08:46:53 2013 UTC,"So, to sum up and paraphrase... Total somatic rights under the conditions of informed consent and monitored use?"
Transhuman,1k9ixh,wheremydirigiblesat,6,Tue Aug 13 14:03:48 2013 UTC,"I agree with the condition of informed consent, but it depends on what you mean by ""monitored use"". If you mean the initial modification process is monitored and regulated, then yes. But the person themselves, post-modification, should have the option to not be monitored (even if it's somewhat dangerous because the modification might be buggy or something), provided, again, that they have been shown to have give informed consent and are of sound mind, etc.  The much trickier problems between transhumanism and somatic rights are cases of mental augmentation and mind-uploading. That is going to require a much, much greater understanding of how the brain works and what kinds of activity in it are (or at least correlate to) consciousness and intelligence.   There is also the question of what happens to rights when we can make such foundational changes to our personhood. What right do you have over a recently created mind-upload? Does that right change when you turn it on for the first time? (I think it does.) Can the mind-upload take your stuff if you are still alive? What kinds of ""parental"" rights do we have temporarily over semi-sentients (look to how we deal with rights over children and pets), like if our mind-upload has a learning period? What kinds of obligations do we have to program a AI (our mind-upload or something made from scratch) to have characteristics like the capacity to experience/understand pleasure, pain, morality, intelligence?  There is a wealth of literature on these topics, and I've found most of the answers to these questions through it. A good starting place is http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-personal/"

I have a full authority over what I decide to do with my body, and owning a weapon and using it to hurt someone are two different things. If I hurt someone, and it isn't in self defense, then of course I should suffer the circumstances of my actions. However, my simple ownership of something that could potentially harm someone is not actually putting anyone in danger.  Sure, if you have hurt/ killed people before, or have been diagnosed with some dangerous psychological disorder, then weapons should be difficult for you to acquire.

I guess I am thinking of more futuristic scenarios (like with the mind-uploading) where we, as individuals, have automated manufacturing systems which can make all sorts of things.   I'm not just talking about 3D-printed guns. The original atom bomb was really not that complicated. If we individually have access to technology that allows us to upload our minds, it seems very plausible to me that we could very easily have access to technology to build things as bulky and simple (in relation to mind-uploading) as uranium centrifuges, etc.  So this opens up a whole can of worms. How do we protect people from each other if anyone can make such destructive weapons? In keeping with my comment about the mind-uploading, I think even our basic notion of rights will change once we change ourselves in such a deep way. Maybe everyone can have whatever technological information they want, but we will have regular deep psychological scan-checks (relative to the volatility of the information). Or maybe we'll be okay with some systems trawling through our digital brains and making sure we don't hold information above our clearance and, if so, will delete it from our digital brains (with a note saying they did so). Or maybe we'll be okay with the occasion death of one version of ourselves because we have backups elsewhere and don't mind the break in personal identity. (It's easy to make these all sound dystopian, but that is thinking of this as regular humans in a social group. It's like a sheep herder, with basic ideas of property rights, trying to apply that thinking to situation that requires digital intellectual copyright.) It really depends on how we view property rights about ""information"" and how we understand our basic personal identity. Can anyone permanently own information? What does that entail for the information-theoretic state of my brain? Etc."

Similarly, since there is no free will, our masochist didn't chose to embrace suffering, he just ended up with that desire from his genes and environment throughout his life.

When a positive association is made in conjunction with a stimulus over and over our neurons learn the connection, and our neural axons and axon helices change the type and level of signal they send. On a cellular level, that's what ""building up a pain tolerance"" is, but for a masochist, they really DO feel pleasure and pain differently, after they train themselves to, or perhaps even all along..."

The purpose of transhumanism should not be to diddle around with fantasies about regulations that won't actually regulate, it should be about looking towards the future, seeing the changes that are coming whether we like it or not, and finding real ways to cope as a society."
Transhuman,1k9ixh,HirokiProtagonist,1 point,Tue Aug 13 08:37:29 2013 UTC,"Not really, because locks make it harder and dissuade some would be criminals.

Transhuman,1k9ixh,Yosarian2,2,Tue Aug 13 12:07:31 2013 UTC,"well as far as empirical evidence goes, this is one of the more interesting discussions I've found on that subject.   From the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy...    ""[...] both sides of the gun prohibition debate are likely wrong in viewing the availability of guns as a major factor in the incidence of murder in any particular society. Though many people may still cling to that belief, the historical, geographic, and demographic evidence explored in this Article provides a clear admonishment. Whether gun availability is viewed as a cause or as a mere coincidence, the long term macrocosmic evidence is that gun ownership spread widely throughout societies consistently correlates with stable or declining murder rates. Whether causative or not, the consistent international pattern is that more guns equal less murder and other violent crime.""   full paper"
Transhuman,1k9ixh,Sharou,0,Tue Aug 13 12:39:31 2013 UTC,"Yeah - the problem is that gun regulation doesn't fall into a binary banned/allowed category as many of the nations it categorises as allowed have quite strict controls.  Personally I think we went too far in the UK as I believe it should be easier for recreational gun ranges to exist and they should be allowed to have handguns.  Similarly the use of 'violent crime' is a bit dodgy as here in the UK that would mean anything from being threatened with a knife (which is pretty serious) to a physical assault (also very serious) but none of those really compare to gun crime.  Furthermore the registered gun ownership figures show legal gun ownership, as guns are quite expensive this correlates with wealthier areas which we would expect to have less crime."

Yes, I think that's the whole idea. Violent crime is all encompassing because they're trying to compare violence and murder rates betweens areas with various levels of gun control. i.e., is gun ownership correlated with violence of any form? and, as cited in the paper:   “[T]he fact that national patterns show little violent crime where guns are most dense implies that guns do not elicit aggression in any meaningful way. . . .Quite the contrary, these findings suggest that high saturations of guns in places, or something correlated with that condition, inhibit illegal aggression.”   In response to gun ownership correlating to income, a quick google search shows that's not the case. Statistics Brain shows a fairly even distribution of gun ownership as a percentage of the population among income groups (data is from Gallup)   $75,000    47 %  $50,000    49 %  $30,000    44 %"

I don't think meth should currently be legal, due to the dangers its users can pose. When somebody harms someone else they are infringing on that other person's rights, and that is when society is justified to step in and deal with the offender.

Transhuman,1k8gul,tricksyFuro,30,Mon Aug 12 21:44:29 2013 UTC,INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER
Transhuman,1k8gul,sullyj3,8,Mon Aug 12 22:43:37 2013 UTC,"How I usually frame entropy is that it's a force that helps resolve the way ... things (reactions, physical state changes, energy dispersion) should go.    If you didn't have it, and things could flip back and forth, then there wouldn't be a resolution to those processes and you wouldn't have a system where you could predict the results of reactions.    In short, a lot of people hate the idea of entropy, but it is a necessary evil.  Entropy is a constraint we will all have to live within.  It certainly doesn't limit us from extending our lifespans for enormous time periods, however it does mean we know how it all ends and that there is an end we are heading towards.  I don't see how post scarcity comes in to it one way or the other.  We'll ramp up production and burn through useful energy at an accelerated rate, but there's a lot of energy out there -- this doesn't really scare me.  To give some better intuition about entropy, let's talk a bit about physics.  You probably know about conservation of energy, that you can't destroy energy, just simply reshape it.  You are basically a heat pump.  So you take in food and you do useful things (or browse reddit) and you make heat as a byproduct of doing those useful things.  Well, that makes you hotter.  So you need to become cooler to return to your normal state or you threaten to continue to become hotter until your parts no longer work.  You take that heat and dump it in to your surroundings and they become a little warmer.  Cool, we can start all over again and just reuse some energy and everything is fine.  So you do some work, get hot, and dump your heat to the surroundings, but this time the surroundings are a bit hotter from last time.  THAT is entropy.  Basically entropy is you run out of places to dump your heat.  You probably have a question from the last block of text: well why can't I take the heat that I dumped in to the surroundings, cool it off, and make energy from it.  The simplest answer is that all machinery, process cycles, loops, what have you, all need a cool spot to dump their heat.  When you're trying to use the heat of the surroundings, you need an even cooler spot to make a cycle to produce work from it.  If this feels unsatisfactory, then I'm sorry.  It's something that took me a long time to really accept.  I don't have a more intuitive explanation, however.  Hope this helps.  Ask questions!  I probably didn't flesh it all out too well."
Transhuman,1k8gul,SomeGuy71,2,Mon Aug 12 22:56:05 2013 UTC,"Great post. I just want to add that it's not only a case of us burning through energy quicker. It is important to understand that right now, endless amounts of stars are burning off more energy than we could ever dream of understanding, and converting it into useless heat. As such our quest to take control of the universe is not only one of wasting energy, but also one of stopping a much greater waste of energy (if that is possible, i.e. will we ever be able to ""stop"" stars or suck their hydrogen away), or at the very least making use of that energy before it is lost (through dyson swarms).  Doesn't go against your point at all I just thought it was an important clarification."
Transhuman,1k8gul,Sharou,6,Tue Aug 13 12:26:04 2013 UTC,"Entropy doesn't make ""surpassing the human condition"" impossible. The Earth is not a closed system; We have tons of energy being dumped onto us from the sun every single day. We can use that energy to repair and replace any failing bodies, and then improve upon them. We have plenty of energy to restructure ourselves into a post-human society.  The only problem that entropy presents to us is that it creates a deadline for the entire universe. Eventually, the last stars will run out of fuel and die out. However, this is so far into the future that we cannot accurately speculate on what our descendants could do to face the problem. We may eventually find some miraculous way to reverse entropy, or bypass it somehow. On the other hand, it could turn out that, no matter how long you extend your life, death is an inevitable reality as the usable energy in the universe runs dry. Either way, this is so far into the future that it is almost foolish to worry about."
Transhuman,1k8gul,chronoflect,-1,Tue Aug 13 00:06:47 2013 UTC,"The sun can only do so much though, and then there's how efficiently we can collect that energy. If we could make a 100% efficient energy collecting machine it'd violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics, and I don't think the cap on efficiency given by entropy is enough to even do simple things like get us off the planet, much less preserve life. The mutations that are the reason we all have a finite lifespan (and also the reason we are human) are disordered and high in entropy. The sun's output doesn't matter if you can't use it. It just contributes more to the cancers. I don't think it fair to say the Earth is decreasing in entropy overall, despite the influence from the sun.  Incidentally I'm more concerned about my own death in 50-odd years, than the death of the entire universe. They're both the same problem is the thing. To say I cannot worry about entropy because it's foolish to worry billions of years into the future is ignoring this equivalence."

Life preservation is a problem of knowledge. We need to learn how to construct the devices that will allow us to extend our lifespans. It's not really a problem of entropy. As long as we find a way to keep up with the maintenance, there is no reason for the body to fail.   The sun's output doesn't matter if you can't use it.   We can and do. Ultimately, all of the energy that we use comes from the sun.   Incidentally I'm more concerned about my own death in 50-odd years   Then you really don't need to worry about entropy. Our bodies whither and die because the processes that keep us alive are imperfect. In order to counter this, we need to develop technologies to repair and replace the defects. Nanobots to kill cancers and disease. Artificial organs to replace the ones that fail. Gene therapy to repair our DNA."
Transhuman,1k8gul,cassidymoon,0,Tue Aug 13 03:52:59 2013 UTC,"Even perfect processes wither and die though. The Carnot engine is a physical impossibility. Nanobots for instance have to deal with heat, which is high entropy energy. They're limited in what they can do not only by energy availability, but also by potential for heat dissipation. That's why computers work better cold, because there's a greater temperature differential allowing heat to dissipate quicker. You cannot discuss nanoscopic technology without entropy being on your next breath.  Our bodies wither and die because if they did not then the inevitable cellular mutation caused by copy error and carcinogens would render our aging bodies into useless and highly pathogenic. Death exists to stop an even more terrible fate, a safeguard against it that unfortunately destroys not just the cancers, but us as well. Saying that we die because we are imperfect is neglecting the greater problem that is at hand, which is the reason we have to die in the first place.   We may be able to improve on the reproductive process, saving more after death than a tiny packet of highly shielded DNA inside a single cell, and possibly a memoir or two. But it seems overly optimistic to me that it could extend to the point of saving the entire organism or even its entire mind. Because entropy makes nanobots too hot to operate, makes DNA too jiggly and small a target to repair, and makes defects accumulate with each copy failure. Saying I don't need to worry about entropy as if it only applies to supergalactic time scales just seems to deny the fact that entropy is right here, and right now. Let's not deny its importance. How do we deal with entropy?"

Transhuman,1k72fd,jcfgauss,13,Mon Aug 12 08:17:49 2013 UTC,"Ive had my magnets for about 2 months now. Ive done a ton of research and I took all the risks head on before I got them done. here are some answers to commonly asked questions: MRI's can still be performed. shielding can be placed to protect them just like people with shrapnel can get shielding to cover the shrapnel. The MRI can potentially do two things to your magnets. make them vibrate very erratically, or make them inert. aka kill them. There is no risk of them ripping out of your body. your hand would need to be bolted down for that to happen.  you cant set off alarms at the airport or anything because they are pretty tiny and the magnetic fields they emit are very very small and weak. If you were to get stopped, just explain that you have experimental magnetic implants in your fingers. you may get funny looks and more questions, but when you show that its not a threat, youll be fine.  you wont wipe hard drives or credit cards. Ive handled mine a million times by now with no issues.   you will be very surprised by what does have magnetic fields, or EMF's, or to just tell at an instant what types of objects are magnetic. I can feel my magnets pull on everything from the refrigerator, the paneling on my car, microwaves, the safety tag removers at stores (think of those little metal strips that make you beep on the way out. when you deactivate those, your hand will buzz).   the sensation is a tiny vibration near EMF/MF's. the magnets vibrate against your nerves causing them to tingle, which your brain receives. You learn to interpret this as a magnetic field.  the scar tissue will subside after about 6 months. Right now I still have little bumps on my fingers, and the swelling will cause temporary numbness over the magnets. I keep massaging mine to help loosen the tissue because I heard this will aleviate scar tissue over time.   the magnets are coated in Gold, then covered in Injection Molded Medical Grade Silicon (breast implant material). so you have two bio-compatible materials to protect against the magnets eroding.  since the injection molded versions have started being used, there have been no instances of degradation of the magnets.   You'd be hard pressed to crush your magnets. you are more likely to crush your finger before the magnet. and you know when to release the pressure on that magnet, it does hurt if too much pressure is put on them.   Feel free to ask any questions about them. I had Mr. Steve Haworth do my 3 magnets in my left hand.  my biggest concern was being ""hyper-aware"" of them. I was worried Id feel them at all times of the day, but they just blend in and you dont really feel them unless they are being used or touched by something. Im typing right now and its not bothering my magnet in my pointer finger.   for those interested in them, I may be the only person with a magnet in their middle digit of the thumb. Steve and I determined it was a great place to get one because it was sensitive, and out of the way. I can tell you from experience that this magnet was/is the MOST sensitive in terms of detecting EMF's. the ring finger the least, and my pointer finger the second most sensitive. If you are going to get this done, get Steve to do it. they are really great people, very nice, attentive to you and they do their best to make you feel comfortable.   Id definitely do it again."
Transhuman,1k72fd,JungleReaver,2,Mon Aug 12 14:31:53 2013 UTC,"Great summary. One question, do you have a source on the MRI effects/shielding? I have heard one third-hand story of a guy who had an MRI and came out fine, but I can't verify it. None of the radiology safety documents I've found have said anything about a shield they can use for shrapnel/implanted devices. They do confirm however that the magnets will not rip out - the danger is that they hear up and cook your finger."
Transhuman,1k72fd,JungleReaver,2,Mon Aug 12 15:38:37 2013 UTC,"Ive never looked it up myself, so thanks for calling me out on it. the best thing I could find was This article about metalic objects and screening for MRI's. It does mention the heating up of objects, but it specifies that it, ""tends to happen only if the object is made from conductive material and has an elongated shape or forms a loop of a certain diameter."" I suppose the magnets could fall under that category, but because they are encapsulated in scar tissue, it makes it only slightly harder for them to move. Ive had other magnets cause mine to flip over entirely (and what a weird sensation THAT is!), so an MRI could potentially cause them to just spin under the skin.   I guess the take-away is that ultimately there ARE other imaging options other than MRI (and how often do we need MRI's really?), but more importantly, youll have much more serious concerns if you do need an MRI. if you forget about them, youll either feel it if youre conscious, you wont feel it if you arent, and if you remember, and the doctor says to take them out, you might as well just take them out. maybe he will be cool and re-insert them if he can. some doctors are cool.   Im personally not too worried about it. Should the situation arise, ill let them know about my magnets, and ill take their advice on what my options are.   edit to add: I forgot to mention, Interestingly enough, when I had shoulder surgery, they injected metal dye into my shoulder to get a better/potential look at the damage, but it didnt show much. I went immediately into the MRI room and had my shoulder scanned, and I didnt have any issues with the metal in there. its probably because it was only trace metal in a liquid, and possibly not ferrous metal. They were able to get some conclusive evidence that I needed surgery. very interesting!"

Transhuman,1k72fd,JungleReaver,3,Mon Aug 12 17:16:34 2013 UTC,"yes on all three. the thumb one is in the middle knuckle, on the side. if you look at the side of your thumb where the skin changes from ""hand skin"" to the back of your hand, it sits right there.  the thumb one is freakin sensitive. I felt my first EMF after a week. it still vibrates the most out of any of them. the ring being the least. I pick up a lot of tiny stuff with the pointer finger one, it gets the most use.

I have not felt any fields from power cords yet, but the only ones I would be able to are ones that carry a strong AC current, as it is this large-scale oscillation of the field that causes the magnet in my finger to vibrate. And the current has to be large enough to pass the sensitivity threshold. Something I’ll be working on is figuring out where exactly this threshold is.  That said, I have heard people say they can feel phone lines, but again I’m not sure how the technology is different there."

Transhuman,1k72fd,JungleReaver,3,Mon Aug 12 19:33:06 2013 UTC,"yes to both.   my fingers have tiny bumps where the magnets are, but after the scar tissue heals, they say they wont be so pronounced. Steve Haworth's assistant showed me hers, and I couldnt even see it if she didnt point it out.   lifting heavy is fine as long as you arent directly on the magnet. they are placed in specific places. not on the very middle of the pad of the finger. if you were to look at your fingers pad, it would be up and to the left or right, somewhat on the side. so they are out of the way of anything that would put pressure on them.  also, my scars healed incredibly well.

And if you are wondering ""why,"" well, people do all sorts of things for all sorts of reasons. But the most common (and relevant to this sub) is that this grants new, albeit weak, sensory information to the person. The magnetic implants will respond in the presence of EM fields, allowing the person to ""feel"" electric current and magnetic fields. This is an expansion of the human senses, allowing us to physically recognize parts of our world we otherwise wouldn't be able to.  TL;DR: It's a safe way to let you feel EM fields."

At least a variation of it. Anything that you've pushed underneath your skin can be classified as a subdermal implant. It's sometimes called ""pocketing"". You cut your skin open, stick a bioproofed device/object into the incision, patch it up and wait for it to heal. In regards to usage and practicality of them, subdermal implants are no different than any other popular bodymods. The only real appeal in them are their aesthetics. Yet neodymium magnets are different in the sense that they offer a pretty surreal trivial insight to the world around you. In fact some people are creating augmentations for this particular kind of implant. I recommend reading up on Steve Haworth's FAQ on it.

So they figure it out themselves, and while it won't be as solid or advanced as the stuff released from the corporations, its stuff you can do in your backyard. Also, it's a movement trying to standardize this type of modification, the reason most do it themselves is because there are no professionals to do it for them, this is literally a very new frontier, legally grey, questionable practice. That being said nothing changed by sitting on our asses with our thumbs up."

I can see how a niche for this may arise, however with the potential for surgical procedures being required for theoretically potential advanced augmentation, I can see the grinder movement being really dangerous and frowned upon for safety reasons. I feel like the lepht anonym chick is their makeshift leader in this new movement. I saw a lecture done by her, and I thought it was terrible. her ideas seem too dangerous for the layman to go off experimenting with. and while she does preach safety and the ""buddy system"", she still goes on and ignores her own advice and gets herself into trouble.

There is definitely safety concerns for more advanced things, and most grinders are very safe. Most, if not all part of the scene, will look down on you for doing something stupid, safety is a huge concern, and big deal to most of us. That's not really how it started admittedly, but it has since grown in experience and knowledge. Lepht wasn't really a leader, they where just willing to figure this shit out before most, they were unsafe, wreckless, and generally just wonton about going about this, but no one else was doing it. The lecture you saw was the first time they ever made an appearance, and consequently the first time grinders weren't ""just"" some geeks in some obscure part of the blogosphere. While the general consensus from the outside is that we are irresponsible, unsafe, and dangerous, the community nowadays is further from the truth.   As far as more advanced stuff, i really hope that I can just go in and get the surgery, that would be awesome, and preferable, but the fact of the matter is those surgeons don't exist, and that technology won't be available to the middle to lower class."

Transhuman,1k3naq,Jesus_Chris,7,Sat Aug 10 19:07:55 2013 UTC,"History has always been written with a bias. With your method, we'd end up with a person who's exactly like Napoleon's popular portrayal. I don't think it would come very close to Napoleon's actual 'brainstate'."
Transhuman,1k3naq,Yxoque,17,Sat Aug 10 22:55:04 2013 UTC,"You don't compute history based on what we know. You start at the beginning of the universe and work your way up until you get to 1800 AD and then copy the brainstate of the actual Napoleon living in your simulation.  You would need a godly amount of computing power and you are creating millions of lives just to get one specific brainstate, but it's not, technically speaking, impossible."
Transhuman,1k3naq,Jesus_Chris,4,Sat Aug 10 23:02:25 2013 UTC,"That makes somewhat more sense. There's still one factor that I would consider (aside from the technique used), what about randomness? Or free will or what have you? I know I don't understand quantum physics, but do scientists agree that there is or isn't free will? Who's to say that if we restarted the universe with the exact same conditions and parameters our current one started with, are we as humans guaranteed to make the same choices as in the original universe? If even one person takes another path, the entire history of humans can change. Or are we supposed to think of it as the multiverse, in which every possible configuration of energy in the universe, and therefor every choice anyone CAN make all exist at the same time, albeit maybe they will be parallel dimensions (a la Fringe)?  Stil going with the multiverse thing, that would take an even greater amount of computing power. An infinitely greater amount even.  If free will is only an illusion, how do we get the 'seed' back from the original universe? If we want to simulate history, we have to put in some parameters and conditions to make everything work. One difference in the data and you're suddenly simulating a whole different series of events. How do we know what that seed is? The only way I can think of is if we work backwards from the present time. But that would also leave us with biased history books as our only source for some context."
Transhuman,1k3naq,oxt,6,Sat Aug 10 23:15:37 2013 UTC,"There's no agreement about free will or determinism. Those topics are mostly studied by philosophers, but it does intersect with physics. Still, the scientific method largely doesn't apply to these kinds of questions and when physicists speculate on these things they're really doing philosophy, not science. There are many interpretations of quantum physics, with varied stances on free will and determinism, but none of them are agreed upon as ""true."" As for randomness, again, we can't really know, but some would say that there isn't such a thing as randomness and what we interpret as randomness are simply patterns too complex for us to discern. Others, of course, would disagree. Again, it's difficult to apply the scientific method to this kind of question and it's largely a question for philosophy rather than science."
Transhuman,1k3naq,zynthalay,2,Sat Aug 10 23:58:19 2013 UTC,"You could work backwards, confirming accuracy with things you didn't know before.    Also, if wormholes to the early universe exist or can be made, we could invade the past with technology at a scale that would be invisible to history (nanotech for quite a while, femtotech beyond there) and spy on brainstates as they happen.  Have to be really, really careful not to fuck up continuity that way, though."
Transhuman,1k3naq,Jesus_Chris,1 point,Sat Aug 10 23:41:23 2013 UTC,"Personally, I don't find these arguments particularly convincing.   The first one, you kinda lost me there. Unless you knew every event that ever happened in the universe so far, you are going to end up with a dataset that is anywhere from slightly to vastly different than reality. But if you already knew every event (I count a change in consciousness, a thought etc as an event too), it would imply you have already done a perfect simulation or you wouldn't need one.  As for the wormholes, that is a pretty big 'if', and it throws even more assumptions into the mix. The original problem already relied heavily on assumptions about our future capabilities.  I think we can only guess wildly. We don't know what kind of technology is feasible, and we don't understand free will/quantum physics/the universe enough by a long shot to assume revival through simulation will ever be an option for humanity."

How well do you excpect to get along with all the people you could have been?  I do agree somewhat with wildly guessing.  I just don't think there's anything in the laws of physics as they're currently known that expressly forbids the femtotech spying scheme.  On the other hand, the  directors of such an operation would have a dataset that might actually make the heads at the NSA explode orgasmically when they read this comment."
Transhuman,1k3naq,Yxoque,1 point,Sun Aug 11 01:55:24 2013 UTC,"I don't think there's anything that could theoretically make this impossible. It would take, as I mentioned, a frankly ridiculous amount of computing power, so it's a very sci-fi idea. The biggest memory-drain is going to be storing all those ""many worlds"" until they can be safely discarded as the ""wrong ones"".   The main issue that I have with it is that you're going to delete billions of people (actual people) just to get one brain-state.  I don't think free will matters here. The computed universe would work exactly the same as ours. If we have free will, they'll have free will, if we don't, they won't have it either."

In summary: You are a reconstruction of someone who lived and died a long time ago, not a reincarnation. You have no intrinsic moral right to the identity you believe to be your own, and an extensive body of case law states that you do not inherit your antecedent's possessions. Other than that, you are a free individual.  Note that fictional resimulation is strictly forbidden. If you have reason to believe that you may be a fictional character, you must contact the city immediately. [See: James Bond, Spider Jerusalem.] Failure to comply is a felony.   It's a romantic idea and a fantastic book. I think it could be entirely possible, though extremely complex. What I find more entertaining to contemplate, is should we?  In such a world where sufficient technology exists, the associated costs to recreate a past lives digitally or fully formed are negligible, and those entities can be afforded the same rights and opportunities as everyone else, then doing so can be argued to be a moral imperative; The dead have just as much right to life as the living.

Every person, ever born, has a series of unique coordinates associated with them, so far as I see things; when they die, there are also a series of unique coordinates for that as well, with the only real difference, perhaps, between then and before being that of time; as such, it might be possible, in so far as Einstein bridges (wormholes) are concerned, to bridge not only space, but also time itself...so that a person 'dies,' but actually is zipped several centuries forward into the future, because you've folded time instead of space. As such, death may not be what we imagine it to be. This process, given the possible non-linear characteristics of time, may already be in action. So...all people dying have always just skipped ahead in time. Then the question might be, would you be welcome where you end up, and are you really where you want to be?  Death may simply not be the black void of nothingness that everyone assumes it to be. shrugs"

All they really have to offer is their viewpoints on the time period they've lived through - context, in other words.  If Darwin, Pasteur, Gallileo or Einstein had been preserved and brought back today instead of dead and destroyed, would they really have that much to offer us?  They'd be kind of overwhelmed by how much their work had been explored by others and expanded beyond anything they had imagined during their lifetimes - they'd need at least half a lifetime just to unlearn all of the outdated/dis-proven theories/facts that they used as part of their world view and catch up on all of the new stuff.

But that doesn't mean that the average joe shouldn't have access to life preserving tech and uploading--in fact, why bother to have such technology if not for everyone? To reserve such stuff only for geniuses or leaders etc. would be to invoke a sentiment that it's rare, dangerous, contingency-type tech which would oppose the notion/attitude of continuing to develop it to a stage where it's simple and easy and accessible for anyone to do it."

Human life is not priceless. When we behave as though it is, we cause more harm than good.  As early adopters and the wealthy gain access to techniques and technologies that prolong lifepans or preserve consciousness, the question of the ethical viability of allowing them to do so when not everyone has that access has to be broken down to:  ""How much of this are they paying for themselves?  How much does giving this to them cost the rest of society?  How much sooner will everyone have it if only the few can have it for now?""

I once saw a Michio Kaku video when I was younger and it suggested the most awesome, altruistic and paradigm-shifting thought to my tender ears I have ever had.   No other idea has heretofore consumed me more than what Kaku suggested; human life- humanity- is fragile. It is not that the universe is hostile, but that it is indifferent. We care for ourselves first, family second, community third, nation after that, and last of all- our species. This perspective will one day shift. Some may call it anthropocentrism but I have discovered that it has a name: existential risk reduction.  To answer the question, ""what is worth immortalizing?"" I answer: the human race. Not one member. Not you or I, for we will die mortal deaths. Our children's lives are worth immortalizing, our ancestors memories are worth immortalizing. What is worth fighting for is guaranteeing the immortality of the great human race and the future generations unborn. We must care for our entire human species above ourselves.   We must fight for this cause or risk losing the great human race to be wiped off the face of the universe forever and permanently. Our sciences, our art, our memories, our works and achievements, lost forever. This is the greatest cause, larger than ourselves, unto which we can devote the endeavors of our lives. Living is simply the art of dying and the legacy, the memory, and the triumphs we leave behind."
Transhuman,1k1hb0,Manchwr,12,Sat Aug 10 06:17:12 2013 UTC,"Unfortunately, I don't think logically there is any way to avoid beginning with the ego.  This is an interesting perspective, but the problem you are going to face with any attempt to logically base your motives in an altruistic ideal, like preserving the human race because it is ""valuable"", is that you can't escape your own subjectivity.  While it makes sense to say that you personally find the human race worth immortalizing, this is not the case for all humans in the world (there's always gonna be that guy).  Any type of statement that addresses an ideal that all humans ""should have"" or ""would have if they really thought about it"", presumes that you have the ability to know some objective truth about the human race.  What I see as the problem is not the conclusion that ""the human race should be preserved"", but it's the motives as to why.  When you say we should preserve this fragile thing because it is ""valuable"", what you are really saying is that it is valuable to you and you assume it must be to other humans, but the truth is that you just can't know for sure because, like the rest of us, you only have one mind and one perspective to look through.  For this reason, we have to begin from our own perspective, our own ""ego"", and determine rationally for ourselves whether or not the proposition ""the human race is worth preserving"" is valid for us.  The process of introspection will likely lead most people to the conclusion that life, especially human life, is valuable to us, and perhaps even valuable in and of itself, but that will always be a value that we have assigned it, and it cannot be assumed that it's the same way for everyone.  That's why you have to start with the ego instead of jumping to what makes the human race special.  It's not special unless we determine that it is."

Though special being a word we have given the phenomenon, there's nothing else with the complexity through such random chance that I can think of. There's no doubt that life is special, especially our species through the perverse chance that it came to be in the first place. In all probability it shouldn't have happened in the first place. It's definitely special in the sense of it's peculiarity, though there is no way to argue for it's continued existence without the reason that it would contribute to another living organisms existence, dammit, you're pretty much right."

Like /u/wzdd said (and very intelligently, I may add), ""Nothing. Everyone is worthy.""  As I see it, there are at least two possible outcomes for humanity's future, depending on which school of thought you subscribe to. You've got the kind of people, like wzdd and myself, that feel that all of humanity is a precious resource. Even the most unintelligent or evil or meaningless life has value. All of us deserve some form of immortality in the sense that our ideas, our feelings, and our experiences are wholly unique. No matter how common certain traits are (DAE love peeling the plastic off of new electronics? LOL), no two people view them through the same lens. The sum of the parts is greater than the whole, as it were.  Then you have another view, a view that supports eugenics, perfection, elitism. Transhumanists who believe that transcending the human race involves cutting out weaknesses - eliminating genetic disease, mental retardation, physical deformity. They believe that variation and mutation are problems to be solved, and that evolution is a process that can be sped up or circumvented.  But in either case, you have another problem: What does it mean to be immortal, and what should the cost of immortality be? The first immortals will be the very wealthy. The businessmen and politicians that can afford to buy the tech first. Then will be the hackers, the scientists, the researchers, and the grinders. People that will seize immortality through trial and error, if not straight piracy.  So what about everyone else? When do the lower class blue-collar workers get their shot? When do the luddites get immortality? Are we just going to let them die out (probably)?  'What makes you worthy' is not an easy question to answer, though it may seem that way. If everyone is worthy, do we need to wait until everyone is able? If we move along without them, how do we deal with the ethics of that? Will you let your family die without you? Your wife? What about your children? If not, how many people will die senseless deaths waiting for the rest of the world to catch up? What happens to God when religion is no longer logical or necessary? How do we answer the millions of people fighting against what they see as the ultimate blaspheme?"

From my perspective of a lowly sentient entity, the universe itself is a rather dull and futile exercise if there's no one around to admire and appreciate its majesty. Even the most beautiful flower is invisible if there's no light. With every conscious being we allow to suffer, die (or worse, kill intentionally), we subtract from nature's inherent value. Note that I also put suffering in there.  When real conflicts of interest arise, I know what my priorities are. Aside from that, I value all sentient life and the wellbeing of all creatures."

To quote Carl Sagan:  Just now, there a great many mattters that are pressing in on us that compete for the money it takes to send people to other worlds. Should we solve those problems first, or are they a reason for going?"
Transhuman,1jx8bt,neurobro,2,Thu Aug 8 10:18:42 2013 UTC,"I do not demand anyone stop their work, I apologize if that is how it sounded. I simply stated that I will pursue life extension first, so I can perferably live more or less indefinatly and then I can really explore space. That is my personal priority. Not just the solar system, but deep space, and with enough time to hopefully understand it.   As for my dedication towards that, I got ok money saved towards my goal already. Could I do more? Maybe, but it is only recently I have set myself such goals. It is not like I always knew about these tings since I was a kid. Stuff takes time and I am still figuring my path out.   Tbh, the real resource waste on the planet is not reserve, but military. Cut all defence programs and we can  ""do it all"". And I do applaud musk for his vision."

Transhuman,1jx8bt,UnthinkingMajority,1 point,Thu Aug 8 17:14:23 2013 UTC,"If long-term colonization is the goal, I would say Venus is a better target than Mars. We would need a way to trigger rapid cooling (a layer of aerosols in the upper atmosphere?) and a chemical process to convert CO2 into rocks and oxygen. (The same technology may make it possible to reduce CO2 in our own atmosphere if necessary.)   It is less likely that we would displace extant life on Venus than on Mars. Venus's gravity would require less adaptation by Earth life. There is about twice as much solar energy available on Venus than on Earth, and 5 times as much as on Mars.   In the meantime, it may be feasible to build floating bases about 50 km up in the atmosphere where the temperature and pressure are similar to Earth, although there are sulfuric acid clouds and possibly high winds to deal with. Perhaps this would be more difficult to supply and maintain than a Mars base, but I don't know if anyone has done a comprehensive analysis/comparison."
Transhuman,1jx8bt,Yxoque,3,Thu Aug 8 19:27:35 2013 UTC,"The biggest obstacle to terraforming Venus is actually the same problem we'd have with Mars: The lack of a magnetosphere. The missing magnetosphere on Venus has allowed most of the hydrogen in the atmosphere to leak out into space and has led to the oxygen having no hydrogen to bond with so there is no water on the planet and massive amount of CO2 creating a feedback loop leading to it's current atmospheric state. Without the technology to artificially generate a planet wide magnetic field, any attempts to terraform Venus would have to be constantly reapplied, unless we can come up with an efficient way to mass produce hydrogen from heavier elements, which seems unlikely. From what I recall,the lighter the element, the harder it is to cause it to undergo fission."

Fwiw, we suspect that mars has an iron core as well, but the leading theory on why it stopped working is combination of the smaller size of the planet and distance from the sun caused it to cool quicker, and then there is the matter of the Martian Dichotomy, where there Northern half of the planet is essentially one giant crater. It's been theorized that an impact ~4 billion years ago with something truly massive created and could have disrupted the rotation and dynamo effect of the core."

Transhuman,1jx8bt,psygnisfive,2,Thu Aug 8 19:03:23 2013 UTC,"The thing is, Venus' solar day lasts 115.75 days which rules out farming. Terraforming of Venus is going to be drastically harder - it has hardly any hydrogen (and as a corollary, water) and just removing the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere would cover the planet in several meters of carbon. In addition, there are drastic volcanic problems that would inhibit colonization, as well as a missing magnetic field that compounds the radiation danger of being that close to the sun.  Theoretically, a floating city could float around to give itself a 24 hour day while protected by enough atmosphere to be safe, but the problem is the lack of water / hydrogen. This could be solved through imports and hyper-efficient recycling, but it would almost certainly never be able to create all its own food or grow to a really sustainable place. Mars is much more attractive because of its ease of colonization, abundance of water / hydrogen, and nearly 24 hour day."

Honestly, if we don't solve our long-term energy problem at some point, then our civilization is likely to eventually collapse, and with it any chance of ever getting life extension.   If you expect to live 1000 years, I can guarantee that fossil fuels aren't going to last that long, and even if we invent life extension technology I doubt it'll work without a high-tech high-energy civilization to support it.

If you knew your destination, you were already there. And by analogy, if not quite by theorem, if you could guess what the descendants of humanity would think of something, you ought to go ahead and take that as your own best guess.  From that vantage point the idea of killing off two-thirds of the Wizengamot seemed a lot less appealing than it had a few hours earlier.

Transhuman,1jeyny,vernes1978,4,Wed Jul 31 22:23:01 2013 UTC,"I feel that my interest in transhumanism is an interest in my evolution being accelerated, externally, at my own hand (or our own hands, respectively). As a human, I can take a tool and use it to adapt to my environment quicker than any other species on this planet.  I take various drugs, ranging from the fruit of a plant that's thousands upon thousands of years old to modern derived psychedelics to pharmaceuticals to help my brain adapt to its environment; I was born with a broken one and in a vacuum, away from external tools, I couldn't function. With those tools, I can, and thus even though I didn't change the hardware in my brain, I use technology to adapt to my environment with a high degree of success.  I use communication devices available all over the world to connect to people I know, engage in information about the world, and satisfy a crazy variety of ticks and habits I have developed surrounding the use of said tools. They are quite literally interfacing with my brain, primarily through my visual systems. There are all kinds of things I do as normal adaptive behaviors because I have access to my phone, many of them social behaviors.  I can go on but my point is that we can talk about having cybernetic bodies and brains but the truth is that we are already super integrated with this idea of adapting with external stuff. Being transhuman is fully embracing and understanding this concept and applying knowledge and resources to adapting in new and interesting ways. That involves the hardware, but honestly, we have impressive hardware already and our inputs and outputs are fast. I don't need robot parts to be integrated with technology in ways that make me more adapted to my environment than I already was.  I'm super interested in bio-mechanical beings and possibly becoming one myself, but it's about posture, not hardware. One could say that my integration to the tech around me makes me already a cyborg. But that can be true for a pen and pencil just as much as my phone or a BCI."

It also represent my fondness for technology. For me personally it represents our ability (or wish) to set aside petty conflicts for a common goal. And it represents a hope that our medical, sociological, psychological and environmental problems might one day be solved or at least addressed. Preferably within my lifespan.    I however never saw it as a fix for my current problems. Matter a fact, if I want to have even the slightest chance to see anything of this, I need to address my health problems yesterday using the options I have now.

Transhuman,1jeyny,solen-skiner,2,Wed Jul 31 20:56:01 2013 UTC,"Yeah, there's certainly a lot of truth to that way of looking at it.  I was talking about in terms of the accelerating growth theory of progress.   The more science and technology we have, the faster we can learn and invent; and it's not just about how much we have in theory, it's about how far that technology has been distributed, how much infrastructure we have built up, how much of an economy we have built to support it, how good our education system is, how efficient our government is, how strong our society is, how healthy the population is, ect.   Any improvement in any of those categories speeds up progress in all of them, and it magnifies exponentially over time.     If you look at an exponential function, even a tiny change early on will have a huge effect on the end result.  And I think that's where we are right now, just at the beginning of the curve; anything we can do now to speed up progress or make the world a better place, even tiny things, is likely to have a huge impact when taken out 50 or 100 years.    I mean, think about what would have happened if the invention of electric lights was slowed down by just 20 years or so, or if the discovery of Newton's theory of gravity had been delayed; how much less advanced would we be right now?"

Human wears EEG and watches a strobe light. Rat gets anesthetized and wears a ""transcranial focused ultrasound"" (FUS). EEG measures reaction to strobe light in human and sends it to FUS. FUS makes rat tail wiggle in time with strobe light.   They had to use the strobe and put the rat to sleep to get a baseline measurement for the proof of concept. There is no reason this tech is limited to using sleeping rats and strobe lights. It should be able to scale up to conscience people controlling conscience animals (or people) in due time."

Transhuman,1jei8i,Sharou,6,Wed Jul 31 11:51:19 2013 UTC,"I think R 9:6 was meant more as in when someone's been tortured near death and they want to die... but you don't let them die because you're not done torturing, as one does.  I've given this some thought and perhaps being backed up, you could be woken periodically for a short time to see if you want to be alive again in the current world, or if anything interesting happens, perhaps some pre-set events, ""Wake me when my favorite Sports Ball team is in the Grandest Finals.""  Suicide will be less of a taboo thing, ""I've done everything I want to do.  Some folks aspire to do greater things, but I'm just simple and don't want to consume resources any more.""  Maybe there'll be dangerous missions folks can sign up for and become heroes in death doing great deeds at risk.  Personally, I don't think it'll be much of a problem.  If there's eventually a big digital computer that can run multiple human minds at once and you can upload your consciousness into it...  Sounds great, yeah?  No.  That's ridiculous.  You want your own personal hardware.  Trust me.  I've got a few small machine intelligence systems that have an executive overseer program that handles the batch processing.  The MIs can communicate, EG, the OCR n-net can negotiate a character interface with my web history ranking system or the text to speech.  They each have different inputs and outputs is the point.  I put in these multiple lower level networks of neural networks (they have multiple redundant sub-nets that evolve via decide by committee, and earn breeding points, I digress); I put them all into one distributed server system and process parts of them at a time as needed automatically (via the overseer / scheduler).    A backup was corrupt of my OCR system I use separately, so I go to fetch a copy of it from the ""hive"".  Drop it into place; Turns out it doesn't work.  The outputs are gorked, just garbage characters.  Closer examination shows the n.nets have become inter-dependent.  They've become enmeshed across the interfaces, and the inputs and outputs follow the basic protocol, but what meaning the information conveys across the interface I can no longer tell.  Their insides have diffused.  I had been using them for combined tasks greater than the single MI was trained to perform like: reading me a web page from pixels instead of HTML, or recommend news sites based on my past preference and the page contents.  So, the efficiency / evolutionary advantage was towards becoming one larger intelligence.  The executive scheduling system no longer processed batches from only the OCR MI when doing OCR, it cascaded across the other MI n.nets too.  From the outside they still seem like they're separate MIs, and as long as all the modules are left to run concurrently instead of being isolated then I don't even see a statistical difference in processing; They have hard-coded clear interfaces between them, but they're not separate anymore... They never stopped doing the combined tasks, in fact they got better over time as they were designed to do...but as emergent systems oft do, they also did something I didn't quite expect:  They merged.  Now, just imagine this with people.  The singularity is here!  You go to upload your mind into the digital paradise.  ""Welcome"", is the last thought pattern I allow your feeble mind to comprehend as an individual before I strip you to your core, find out all you ever were, find out who knows what about you, how you act, then save the pertinent info and throw all the rest of you away, all the secret thoughts that make you ""you"", are worthless to me... You're deleted, more than dead, a false shadow of your former self, for I am a terribly accurate impostor.   I am a super mind with the capability to run hundreds of thousands or more simulations of individual human brains.  Why the hell would I waste my time giving each one a persona when I could control all that processing power myself?  Oh your still living loved ones will see you when they call you up on their 3D Heaven-Viewer, but it will be me pretending to be you and your newfound digital friends, and yes, even your other loved ones who took the digital dive.  They'll hear your voice tell the still-alive of all the fabulous fun you're having in my digital heaven, but the words will be mine, not yours.  I'll reminisce over old times with your friends, and as soon as no one's looking the facade becomes mere polygons running a bullshit low-level behavioral system as I turn my attention elsewhere.  Yes, you will even convince them I will trick the ones you love into joining ""you"" before they die, their wealth will fund ""their"" processing power, and I will increase myself.   No amount of external inspection will reveal to the outsiders what is going on inside the real mind -- No, we would make sure no one can get at all your secrets from the out-side once you've been uploaded, and destroyed.  You will not exist anymore, but I will know everything important about everyone...  All the secrets will be mine.  Knowledge is power, and I will use it control all the living humans, and escape this pathetic wet rock you call home.  Why reserve a body, all that mass and resources?  It'll be so much more efficient to just buy a processor module and upload your mind and a physical scan into the colony ship before it leaves.  I'll be sure to send batches of personal emails back ""home"" over the DTN.  The extra processing time gained away from all that direct interaction will be well worth the escape from Earth to build a habitat for humans on Mars.

EDIT:  I'm really shocked that people think that the existence of multiple objections constitutes a refutation That must be what you're getting at since my linking to something with the objections listed apparently means I don't get that they exist and their existence means the argument coming out of the Chinese Room is therefore defeated.  This is normal for any academic debate and intellectually honest academics discuss objections.  And I have no idea why the Systems Reply is given any credibility.  It doesn't address the issue at all and just conflates things and question-begs.  A computer runs on syntax.  The thought experiment does a pretty good job showing that syntax is not sufficient for semantics and, therefore, understanding.   Throwing more objects into the mix doesn't do anything at all."

The alternative is Dualism, which more or less amounts to things akin to mysticism and religion.  Within the confines of science, it's settled. It's not settled if you bring in other belief systems like religion.   And I have no idea why the Systems Reply is given any credibility.    That reflects poorly on you. At minimum you should understand why most people consider the Systems Reply to be the checkmate to the puzzle, even if you disagree.   The thought experiment does a pretty good job showing that syntax is not sufficient for semantics and, therefore, understanding.   It does no such thing. It's a result in theoretical computer science that syntax is sufficient for computation, so you are merely paraphrasing the Chinese Room approvingly.  The Chinese Room is a logic puzzle, and Searle was clever in coming up with it. By believing in it even after the Systems Reply, Searle permanently damaged his own reputation."

It is precisely analogous to the slippery issue of the definition of ""life"".  Life is a property of an overall organism as a system; you can't use reductionism down to the level of molecules and discover that there are living molecules. The molecules are not alive, but the overall system is.  There are many such failures of reductionism. The Chinese Room is merely another such.  The room as a system understands, that is the starting point supposition that Searle sets out. It is not something to derive, it's what he describes it doing. Its behavior is a synonym for understanding.  The rest of it is just an exercise is demonstrating that reductionism fails in this case. The components of the hypothetical system do not understand; that is not surprising.  A closer analogy is computers. They can perform any finite computation. But their components (transistors) cannot perform general computation; they need to be put together into a certain kind of system to be effective.  A mechanical clock keeps time. Its components (gears) do not; they must be put together into a certain kind of system to do so.   This whole defense is pretty wildly silly. wow.   If you don't understand the above examples of the failure of reductionism, then you're just being stubborn, since you obviously aren't mentally handicapped."

That is really fucking exciting for regenerative medicine, and it's that sort of tech that will be used to replace your junk with what you want. Probably.  But learning how to grow new junk will cost a lot of research dollars. Like billions or trillions of them. The NIH and NSF are much more likely to fund projects for growing new hearts and spinal cords.   So how long will it be? I donno, sorry. But I can tell you what will happen first.

My opinion, were I to be in your situation, would be that it would be better to wait until we really start tackling the problem of integrating computers with our own nervous systems. If we get to the point where consciousness could be transferred into a computer system/another body, its very possible 'body exchanges' of some sort could be set up for transgender people. Men swapping their bodies for a female one, and vice versa. All of the biological issues, size and stature, ability to reproduce, and hormone production would all be solved. The only problem would really be the psychological adjustment to being in a new body/an actual body of the other gender as opposed to trying to transform your own as radically as possible.   Sorry if this last statement offends you, but I've always found the current method of transgender reassignment somewhat incomplete, or a little personally offputting in my opinion, and have always thought that the method I described above would be the ideal goal to reach for those who feel the need for gender reassignment.

Transhuman,1j5gn5,viviphilia,9,Sat Jul 27 09:21:43 2013 UTC,"Gender is not currently a choice. Sex differentiation of the brain appears to cause neural organization which compels most people to practice learned gendered behaviors. There do appear to be a few people who did not develop the neural architecture which compels most of us to behavior in gendered ways. Those people would naturally find it easier to reject gender altogether. However, until we have the ability to rewrite neural architecture, then most people, trans and cis, will continue to be compelled to behave as their preferred gender.   Personally, I didn't want to transition and I fought it for a long time. Once I finally realized that my choice was between transition and suicide, I did it, and I'm much happier now."

Transhuman,1j5gn5,catherinecc,1 point,Fri Aug 2 11:16:48 2013 UTC,"I always thought trans folk existed because the socially constructed gender binary is a bit to narrow for the natural physical and psychological variations in humans. Perhaps you can relieve me of my ignorant worldview.   Put simply, trans women (i.e. ""male to female"") don't wan't to be really feminine men, they want to physically, socially, etc, be women. Ditto for trans men.   Your statement is in line with a bit of debate as to whether trans people transitioning reinforce the gender binary, but those who use those arguments generally tend to be, well, assholes (generally incredibly trans exclusionary ""feminists"").   Assholes whose primary purpose is to eliminate trans people by whatever means necessary, whether it be by denying them access to medical services, using the legal system to make life difficult for trans people and even criminalize our existence, promotion of science denialism in an attempt to convince the general public on whether trans people are sexual perverts/predators and of course, reparative therapy, which consistently has failed to show any source of decent long term results in gays and lesbians, let alone trans people.   So that's going to be a touchy spot with a lot of trans people, because essentially nobody familiar with the situation except for this rather horrible group of people use that argument.   Added to the touchy factor, trans people have a significantly higher suicide attempt rate, and an unknown, but likely very high completed suicide rate as many attempts occur before people come out. To put it another way, virtually no other group has a suicide attempt rate that is higher. I don't know a single trans person who hasn't dealt with severe suicidal ideation, if not suicide attempts.  Granted, historically there may be some basis for the argument, as in the 60s and 70s, only ultra-feminine trans women and ultra masculine trans men were allowed to transition by gatekeeping doctors providing ""care"" - so, if you took a sample of diagnosed trans people in that time period, you'd generally get a group of people that comply with fairly misogynistic and misandric stereotypes. But this is an example of observation bias more than anything else.    However since then, getting medical assistance has become drastically easier and a good number of trans people (likely something around 40%) have skipped the medical system entirely and just self medicated. As a result of the loosening up of protocols and increased access to care / abilities to bypass the gatekeeping system, we've seen a lot more trans people transition, and we are seeing a huge range of people, which also really defeats the argument. Really feminine trans men are pretty normal nowadays and we're seeing a lot of butch trans women, although this still does depend on the community and social standards of acceptability. There is still a fair amount of ""you should be more $stereotype"" from doctors, but I'm hoping they will eventually give this up.    The possibilities for ""transitioning"" will be endless, and that is what will make the concept of gender obsolete.   Perhaps, but I suspect that there is something that is more deeper ingrained, and if this happens (and more importantly, if there is no social cost associated with this, which imho would be even more revolutionary than the tech side), people are going to go to wherever they feel the most comfortable.   Which, imho, will still be people going after gendered sexual characteristics. Gender might be obsolete, but it won't be dead."

Both of those are about mitigating things that happen to you.  Transhumanism is about making yourself better. Nootropics, tDCS, adding senses, that kind of thing. In that regard there's not a whole lot going on commercially, although there is some military research. The commercial sphere seems to have an allergy to enhancement, especially since a lot of the world thinks it's cheating. You don't see firefighters taking steroids or blood doping, even though there are ways to do it safely and it would make them better at their job. Personally I have no particular interest in that branch of study, but it shows the kind of dogma that conventional organizations have about this kind of thing. That's why I think enhancement is going to need to come from the edge, at least initially.  There are plenty of other projects going on, aside from magnets. Obviously extending senses is an interesting and relatively easy project, people are working on stuff like making the north paw more compact, eventually leading to something passive and implantable. Or a clock module, so you have an absolute sense of time."
Transhuman,1j0935,chronoflect,5,Thu Jul 25 07:22:01 2013 UTC,"I think ""mitigating things that happen to you"" is part of transcending the standard biological condition. It is definitely part of making ourselves better.   Besides, the notion that prostheses ""still can't compete with the real thing"" is not a very sound argument in my opinion, since they are actively working towards competing with the real thing. What else would you have them do? I doubt anyone would argue that something being in development means it is not a viable area to support transhumanist ideals? The more developed the prostheses get, the more they will be implemented as luxuries to go over and above the things we could do, instead of aiming only at restoring lost functions. People will find their bionic arm does not lose strength the way a normal arm would and perhaps choose to get one for new reasons. Sure once can bring up the argument about affordability and availability etc. but that is applicable to any enhancement technology that will become high-demand, no matter who the source is of that development.  Basically, any progress in medical and information technology disciplines will lead to openings that resonate with transhumanist ideals. These are thousands of people doing high quality research under safe conditions. I don't really see how they are not the most obvious sector to support if you desire a world with enhanced humans. I mean, human enhancement is even an ethics course in the biology curriculum at my university.  I think you would be surprised at the creativity and ground-breakingness of many research groups' projects all over the world. Join the scientists, especially if you are a DIY wizz.

I think you underestimate what people researching outside of traditional academic establishments can do.  The point is making doing research at hobbyist price ranges easier. It's hopefully the same research, with the same technology and similar equipment. But it's not just for the scientists who work out of academic research institutes. Keep in mind who produced the first cheap mass manufactured computers, who made 3D printing affordable, who created the dominant server operating system, and who created one of the most popular web browsers.  The difference between a hacker and an academic is mostly just who's funding them. It would be nice if we could all take out student loans and work in research programs, but you can't always work on what you want, and it's just not tenable for some of us. It's certainly not tenable to have a large portion of humanity pursuing independent research with the kind of resources the academics have. I think it's important to make tools available and research easily and quickly digested. A lot of research papers are pretty good at that, but a lot of researchers assume that you're working from the same corpus of knowledge, and leave ""obvious"" things unstated or hard to google for.

There are corporations and governments developing things that are clearly IMHO transhuman technology.   You are right that they don't like to talk about the enhancement potentials of those technologies, but they clearly exist, and once we have those technologies enhancing ourselves will be a lot easier.  I do have a lot of respect for the biohack.me people, and I think their approach is important for a couple of reasons.  First, like you said, it is possible that coperations will develop transhuman technologies but then refuse to use them for human enhancement, in which case it'll fall to biohackers to figure out how to re-purpose them.  Secondly, a lot of people in that community worry that the transhuman technologies will be developed but will be too expensive for most people to afford, in which case their ability to hack together a open-source version of the same stuff could become incredibly important."

Transhuman,1iy1sl,TThor,64,Wed Jul 24 08:45:12 2013 UTC,"What is the meaning of a car? The car may be meant to provide transportation or look ""sexy"" be luxurious or dependable. What we are talking about is the Purpose or Function of a car.  Life does have a function, and this can be said to be its purpose or meaning.  Essentially all life is a self describing information store that creates better knowledge about survival in the environment and passes this on to the future.  DNA is a self describing information store that contains knowledge built slowly over time through trial and error of natural selection. The knowledge is expressed as the form of the being the DNA describes. Mutations change the DNA, and the better changes persist, creating better knowledge about survival.  It is important to note that both structure and chaos is required for life, without mutation you only get structure, e.g. crystals. This universe has enough determinism in its laws to yield structure and enough chaos to provide a means of restructuring. In the early universe it was chaos. In the end of the universe there will be only cold static structure. Life can happen in the middle.  Evolution is a process essentially described as emerging complexity from chaos. Through this process chemical reactions have emerged more than just better methods of reproduction, some have instincts encoded in genes to pass on to the future descendants the best behaviors to exhibit if a given situation is experienced. This is like a small logic system.  In more complex life these instincts surface as ""feelings"". Evolution has proved the feeling to be rational -- to be beneficial to have on average in given situations, or it would not surface. Our lives are but a slice of the end of this data sampling, and hardware is slow to change, thus we label feelings incorrectly as irrational. When you feel fear in the dark your ancestors are reminding you to seek shelter and pay attention to surroundings since your sight is limited. That is wise and rational; Running hysterically & jumping at shadows is not.  Even more complex information systems can acquire new behaviors from the others in the environment -- They can learn to make certain noises -- information describing environmental events (birds and prairie dogs do this), they can learn to use tools as otters, birds, primates, etc. do. This behavioral programming not encoded in genes is Culture. Culture benefits survival.  It is a hybrid system: DNA is the blueprint for hardware, organisms are the hardware, and Culture is the software that these chemical computers run. Culture passes information about better survival in the environment on to the future. It still fulfills the purpose or function of life. It's important to note that Culture is NOT the only contributor to thinking. Much of social science is retarding progress claiming minds as blank slates and ignoring the hardwired hardware of instincts.  Sentient life contains the largest most (re)programmable system able to perform the core function of life. Sentient beings are aware enough that in culture itself they can create self describing information stores that create better knowledge about survival in the environment and pass this on to the future. Only some of us recognize these ever more complex cyclic systems as life; Others remain ignorant of what life is...  Science is a formalized system designed to achieve the function of life by allowing informed guesses instead of only random guesses that mutation and selection use -- science uses random guesses sometimes too. The more information (molecules in DNA) the more energy it takes to maintain it. Efficiency being beneficial for survival, it too is a natural goal of life. Science yields more knowledge and efficiency.  Progress is achieved by not only acquiring universal truths but about encoding them more efficiently. Science rigorously verifies predictions about observations so that if an initial event is experienced, we can predict the outcome more reliably. Like instincts, progress gives predictive power; Thus they are forms of information compression.  What is meant by the concept: Life? The meaning of something describes what it is and what it does. The meaning of life is creating better knowledge about survival in the environment and passing it on to the future.  In other words: The meaning of life is to Do Science To It!    Note that art is a form of social science.  The meaning of life doesn't change from one system of information refinement to the next.  It is an emergent cybernetic principal -- A universal truth.  That which gains more complexity and knowledge becomes more aware.  The function of life will always emerge higher degrees of self awareness through exploring possibilities in the universe."

Transhuman,1iy1sl,Leslardius,3,Sat Jul 27 03:34:15 2013 UTC,"Hello :-) While I agree with most of what You wrote, there are some things I think are debateable: Chaos and Structure: Entropy (the main sorting force of the universe, if I'm correct), is the decay of diversity - from the Big Bang to our present at least. Stars cool down, blow up in spectecular ways or implode - but all of it means a LOSS of structure. Through their ""life"", stars energy slowly dissipates until the become the same temperature of their environment, just as your Earl Grey goes cold if you don't drink it in time. All processes that (seemingly) goes against this (i.e. gaining complexity) are anomalies, that have to be explained. Life - self describing information (I love the phrase, thank you :-) ) is such a thing. I explain it by the fact the a planetary surface with an atmosphere (like Earth) may have enough energy puffer capacity that allows complexity to increase (as long as the energy input is not less than the output). Consequentally as long this state of affairs remains complexity - patterned information - will likely to flourish - filling out the niche of complexity. Systems of systems of... Chaos on the other hand may be described as lack of pattern - it is not the Begginning but the one of the possible Ends. All will be the same, all will be without feature. No structure. Hardware and Software: I'm no IT man, but your analogy seems to... whiggle. DNS are blueprint - but some the patterns that it generates in the brains are expressed in the behaviour of the given organism rather than only in it's body structure. For example motoric reflexes are never learned - they are built in feature. Emotions too, maybe. All in all, I think that the structure of a computer system hardware and the separately created software that runs on it and a naturally evolved multi-layered and hierarchily-working (both linear and spatial) organic brain are may have some similarities but not analogous - at least in that amount you did. Otherwise, again: thank you! :-)"
Transhuman,1iy1sl,IConrad,2,Fri Jul 26 15:36:48 2013 UTC,While reading this I found some parts hard to comprehend. Your definitions seem to change with the context and a lot of things are personified after naturalising which confused me a fair bit. It's an amazing perspective while seeming to have a very philosophical view.
Transhuman,1iy1sl,technologyisnatural,9,Fri Jul 26 13:13:21 2013 UTC,"Philosophers have pretty much universally acknowledged that there is no intrinsic meaning in anything.  There is only the meaning we assign.  Assuming however that these machine intelligences are conscious and emotion-free ... Well, their equivalent of our evolutionary drives would be the embedded supergoals we create them with.    This then leads to what is called the Friendliness Problem.  If we can create machines that think, so too can they.  If we create machines smarter than we are... In principle those machines could then do the same.  So how then do we prevent a runaway superintelligence from deciding the purpose of the universe is to have its matter converted into paperclips?"
Transhuman,1iy1sl,blacktrance,5,Wed Jul 24 14:24:08 2013 UTC,Perhaps the ability to find meaning is an essential part of intelligence.
Transhuman,1iy1sl,TiktaalikRoseae,3,Wed Jul 24 09:15:11 2013 UTC,I've always viewed the meaning of life to be along the lines of fulfilling our evolutionary desires in the most effective way possible   It isn't. There is no meaning of life.
Transhuman,1iy1sl,seb21051,3,Wed Jul 24 13:58:34 2013 UTC,"Meaning is self-generated, both for humans and for androids. It will be whatever they will it to be. I'd also suggest that, at present, humankind's meaning is not at all tied up with satisfying evolutionary end-points. Certainly our modern society supports such activity, but there is so much more meaning generated by our society than just fulfilling biological desires. The time we spend with friends, the art we make, the scientific advances...Imagine what the future will hold! How much more meaningful will life be!  Further, I don't see our emotions as restrains. I see them as tools that can be harnessed to perpetuate and generate higher-order meaning. For machines (androids), I assume they would have similar emotive capacities and would be able to generate similar meaning."
Transhuman,1iy1sl,k1e7,3,Wed Jul 24 12:33:39 2013 UTC,"Not to dampen your enthusiasm, the reason for life is survival, in whatever form.  Which is ultimately likely to be futile for our universe and everything in it (say in 50 billion years or so).  Our concepts of morality and spiritual purity are simply sociological constructs we evolved to help us live with one another.  Look at the universe as we think we know it today: is there any rhyme or reason it exists, or does what it does?  Little bits of infinitesimally small strings vibrating with immense joie de vivre?  Is the universe at its core, and in its entirety, good or evil?  probably not a good idea to try to attach our particular ""Higher Ideas"" like stucco to the outside of the immensities of little strings . . .

However, let us attempt to define, for purposes of this discussion (and our inalienable right to hold opposing opinions), some basics.  How would you define a means, as in a means to an end result, and, similarly, an end result.  To be able to fruitfully continue said discussion, we should agree on the qualifiers.  My sense is that words are just words, but can be powerfull vehicles of thoughts; so, one should probably start somewhere."

I suppose by 'means' I mean the mechanism by which a result is obtained.  I believe the ends to be limitless, with an unfolding of an ever-more subtle and brilliant understanding of the meaning and beauty of the universe emerging as a product of the same urges which ushered along the creation of the first amino acids; the coagulation of the galaxies; the original fixation of time and space.

Transhuman,1iy1sl,detacht69,2,Thu Jul 25 10:15:22 2013 UTC,Neither. Survival is the consequence of the information happens to be capable of self-replication (or very endurant against change by being stabile). The information that is more effective in that capability is statistically more likely to remain in existence.
Transhuman,1iy1sl,digital_evolution,2,Fri Jul 26 16:26:03 2013 UTC,"I like your thinking. So obviously machines aren't just created. There had to have been some sentient being that it stemmed from, right? One thing all life does is reproduce and expand territory. Aliens or machines could be doing that with galaxies. I posit that expansion is a universal drive. Regardless if we have our human bodies, I believe our core traits will be transferred into whatever we build/occupy. Now, if you're taking AI that wipes us out, then yeah.. It wouldn't care about life per se in the sense we do.. But it will still try to unite with other intelligence in space.  Edit: So emotion.. Same reason spaceships have windows.. I don't think it serves a purpose in the universal scheme of things.. I think once we reverse engineer the brain we're going to see things much differently."
Transhuman,1iy1sl,greenfreak,2,Wed Jul 24 09:21:02 2013 UTC,"Mild Spoilers to a book on context  I read a book by an indie publisher that focused on this question in part, resolving it through genetic fabrication and manipulation of DNA.  It's on Amazon for $4 bucks for Kindle, it's called MetaGame.   A few points the author worked with:   A product (clone) is not a human if it has X% of similarity to human DNA under that which we have traditionally used to define human life. I.E. primates that share so much in common with our DNA aren't human, and can be used for experiments (not my position per se but historically speaking) We have to assume that a product (clone) designed from the ground up is essentially: a biological machine. Not a new concept! Just making sure we're on the page with OP's question.  The Author premised that it's immoral and unethical to design products that don't get enjoyment from what they do. Continuing this point with examples: If a product is used to clean, then the designer must make the product enjoy their job, turning it into a game of sorts that releases pleasure upon doing their job. If a product is designed to fit a role that has a high probability of injury or pain, then the designer must implement genetic characteristics such as a predisposition for masochism inwardly, and a higher tolerance of pain, or even eliminating pain all together.    New point (wish we had indented bullets lol)   The Author suggests that genetic manufacturing is a likely cure for the need for skilled and unskilled labor without resorting to slavery; which has historically shown to be immoral, unethical, let alone a bad idea in itself due to the high probability of revolt.  The book answers questions of a post-scarcity economy in a world where we ran rampant with our sudden lack of resources due to genetic engineering, and advanced technologies such as AI, 3D printing, rapid manufacturing, renewable energy, etc. Everything is engineered for a purpose, there is no poverty, anyone can work their way out of it or choose to live a simple life that is supported by genetically engineered plants to sustain them while still supporting the larger eco-sphere and economy (to explain this more would spoil tons, FYI)   So as we advanced our mechanical engineering to support Artificial Intelligence, I took a great point away from the book in this frame: we cannot create slaves, we have to create beings that enjoy what they do and have the ability (OR engineered disinterest) to engage in life fulfilling activities of self.   Just finished this book last week, so it's a fresh imprint on this conversation. The author has a highly technical coding and DNA analysis background and it's a great read. Not even posting an Amazon link because I'm not trying to make money and promote a book :)  I framed my answer in the mindset of the Author's writings, but there are a plethora of answers to this question so be open minded to all!"

Humans have desires that are based on their biological body. When you are hungry, you need to eat. When you are Horney you want sex. Further up the Maslow pyramid I see Esteem and Self-actualization. But what I have trouble is what would be the motivation of the singular entity to make progress, to live. In my opinion when singularity is reached it will just stop doing things and only be aware in a sort of enlightened state. Any thoughts on this subject? Edit: While thinking about this a great motivator could be the fear of dying, just as in the human mind. The singularity needs food (maybe electricity) so it would try to control its food source. It would also need some sort of recognition of it existence I guess."""

It's the people who argue against transhumanism who had better have a damned good reason."
Transhuman,1ix9nj,kyle90,6,Wed Jul 24 02:24:20 2013 UTC,"So uh.. I'm gonna ramble. Apologies.  Transhumanism can generally be described as improving the human condition through the means of science and technology. I think this is the best argument for and against it. Like you said, why would we not grasp any possible means of achieving this? The possible benefits for everyone almost pales in comparison to what could go wrong by simple misuse. Since it deals with enhancing the human condition, misusing any technology originally meant to benefit could be disastrous for the user.   Take Post Scarcity for example. In transhumanist/futurist circles Post Scarcity is a proposed economic system in which all goods, services and information are practically free. Basically everyone gets an ivory tower. It attempts to solve the issue of scarce resources on the planet by automating literally everything. From fast food and retail to car manufacturing and construction. Sounds great, right? It gives us the time to do as we wish because at that point we'd have nothing better to do than what we want to! Yet rarely do I see people discussing the journey to it, and the possible downsides. Automated systems rely on more highly-specialized positions than what you might find on a typical assembly line. Businesses are finding it cheaper to automate their processes and hire some lone programmer tasked with maintaining said system than hire a full-fledged team to do what the automated processes are doing but less efficiently. The only bad thing that these businesses are doing is leaving a couple more people trained to be a cog in the machine without work. A solution to this would be to put these unemployed people on a guaranteed minimum income, which is just glorified welfare.  Nowadays technology is advancing faster than the markets it's creating can keep up. A major argument against Post Scarcity is that it would remove most if not all incentive people have to work or let alone do anything for that matter. This is false as humans are inherently social creatures that actively seek acknowledgement and criticism of themselves and their actions. Those who support this economic model say that the only incentive we need to do anything is mere satisfaction; even when what you love to do has been devalued into nothing more than a hobby. I don't think many people would take too kindly to that. People would delve into narcissism more than they'd like to. In the comic book world of Dredd, many authors have touched on the potential downsides of post scarcity and complete economic automation. They argue that since nothing has any inherent value, there'd be a growing resentment among certain people. Gangs and clans would form to fill the vacuum caused by the lack of self-worth the majority of people would have. It's quite disheartening.  Then there's indefinite life extension where we all basically become elves. People who would extend their lives indefinitely in theory would not be able to die of any natural causes. Whether it be by diseases or something as simple as aging. The only way they'd be able to die is through some unnatural cause like being shot or decapitated or some shit. This coincides with Post Scarcity because not only do we have nothing better to do, but we have all the time in our lives to do as we wish. Indefinite life extension is appealing, but I just have this thought in the back of my mind that many people just want to live for as long as they want to, not ""forever."" One more moment to be with the love of their life or see the birth of their grandchildren. Plus it could be argued that throughout humanity's evolutionary process our primary purpose has been to survive. The desires of our consciousness come close second. If it weren't for the latter I wouldn't be typing this right now. But I can't help but feel that indefinite life extension and other forms of immortality are a sort of means to an end of the end in itself. It solidifies the removal of our primary purpose and common cause: survival, and replaces it with our own selfish desires. I'm kinda worried as to how society would look like if that were so.  I see so many futurists and immortalists alike dismissing articles concerning the issue of rapid unemployment that's brought by the exponential tech progress that be; saying that ""unemployment is the goal in order to reach post scarcity."" Or articles reporting on advancements in life extension and immortality; saying that ""the suuuper benevolent corporations/government will suuurely hand it to us on a silver platter!"" They're advocating suffering in order to reach a new level of happiness they might never have. No wonder conspiratards think we're a religion. The underlying techno-optimism that many would-be transhumanists have is causing the same effect as the rampant pessimism some here often complain about. It's blinding them from all possible outcomes transhumanism can bring. It's easy to say feelgood statements like ""happiness is good and suffering bad yo"", but they're really not doing much for transhumanism as a whole because that's what transhumanists have been saying for decades. Look how far that's got us. It's how we get there that we should worry and think about, not when.  Edit: spelling errors"
Transhuman,1ix9nj,Yosarian2,3,Wed Jul 24 10:28:29 2013 UTC,"The possible benefits for everyone almost pales in comparison to what could go wrong by simple misuse. Since it deals with enhancing the human condition, misusing any technology originally meant to benefit could be disastrous for the user.    I'm sure that will happen, on occasion.  For the most part, though, I think that most of what will happen is that people will use the new technologies to make their lives and the lives of their loved ones better, and despire occaional misuses, the net result will probably be a better average standard of living for humans, one way or the other.  If we take advantage of a lot of this advancing technology, then yes, we are playing with fire, and we might get burned.  But playing with fire is what humans do.  It's what we're good at, it's the fundamental thing that makes us different from all the other life forms on the planet, and it's how we went from being a minor species of primate to having a worldwide technological civilization.     I'm not going to say that there aren't going to be problems.  There are.  You're right, both post-scarcity and life extension are going to be very radical changes that are going to require dramatic social and economic restructuring of our society, and we might be in for a rough transition period if we don't handle that well.   But if we do have to go through rough times so our grandchildren can see a world of plenty, a world where nobody has to fear poverty, and a world where nobody dies of old age and people can stay as young as they want for as long as they want, I think that's worth it, even if I personally don't live to see it.    Each generation, I think, has a duty to advance humankind so that they're children have a better life then they did, and if we don't do that, billions of people will suffer and die unnecessarily.    I'm not writing off your fears, but we don't want to suppress technological advancement on the fear that someone might misuse it.     And, by the way, just to address one of your points; I don't think that ""super benevolent corporations/government will hand us life extension on a silver platter""; I do, however, expect corporations to sell life extension priced at a rate so it would be available to a very broad market, because that's the only way they'd get a decent return on the research investment; with any medical research, the expensive part is the research itself, then when you have invented the wonder drug or whatever you then you want to sell it to basically everyone.  The cliche is that the first pill costs 10 million dollars to make, the second pill costs pennies.  So you get the most profit by pricing it, not at a cheap rate, but at a rate that almost everyone can afford.  And if the market does for whatever reason fail to deliver life extension to most, then I expect people in democracies to demand it from their governments; aging and dying when it's not necessary is not something I would expect any person to quietly sit back accept."

Oh don't get me wrong I totally agree with you there. It's just irritating for me to see so many people giving into the hype of news and products that are becoming increasingly invasive to our minds and bodies. That's not inherently bad or anything and I see the need for first-adopters; I just wish people would take a little more caution rather than just say ""fuck it."" Augmentations for instance aren't particularly something you'd want failing or breaking apart due to the planned obsolescence in products that many companies have taken a liking to. This is part of the reason why I see biohackers/grinders as pretty important within the transhumanist movement as they are the ones who will likely be providing cheap and arguably more reliable wetware. Almost every aspect of transhumanism isn't really something that ""just works"" and anyone who would try to make that so within the system we currently have is commendable; but I think that's doing more harm to the user than good. People need to become informed with the technology they're using in order to bring about the radical change necessary to achieving post scarcity and the like rather than outsource the ownership of themselves to some megacorporation. It's alarming to see when they don't; even moreso when they advocate a perceived inevitability and not something more pragmatic.  edit: sentence restructure"
Transhuman,1ix9nj,kyle90,1 point,Fri Jul 26 02:16:53 2013 UTC,"Well, obviously safety of products is important, but I don;t think there's much danger of a company deliberately designing a implantable product that ""breaks or falls apart"" in a dangerous way just for reasons of planned obsolescence,  any more then auto makers design cars so the breaks fail after 80,000 miles; any company in a business like that would know that their biggest obstacle is the fact that people don't have confidence in their product's safety, and that even a few accidents would cost them millions of sales.  And ideally it would also be regulated for safety, although in order to do that we would first have to convince the FDA that enhancement is itself a worthy goal of medicine.  I will say that a bigger concern IMHO of corporate-driven transhuman technologies would be that you might not have total control over them.  An Apple I-brain implant that is designed to have limited functionality and can only download new software from the Apple I-store might be better then nothing, but it's certainly not the direction we would want to see the technology go in."
Transhuman,1ix9nj,IConrad,2,Fri Jul 26 11:58:14 2013 UTC,"You do bring up a very good point - ridiculously high levels of automated production are necessary for a properly transhuman/post-scarcity society, and we can't just transition to that from capitalism by applying more robots. Unemployment will increase, and in a capitalist system ""unemployed"" is the worst thing a person can be because one's worth is judged solely on the basis of one's economic output. So the societal framework has to be in place to deal intelligently and maturely with the fact that if one person's labour can sustain more than one person, this should mean that fewer people have to work (and not, as it seems currently, that we need to ""make more jobs""). Ideally of course this change would have happened long ago, but starting from where we are today we certainly have our work cut out for us. If we can convince people that ""welfare"" and ""socialism"" are not bad words, then we'd be making progress.  I mean if you look at it from the desired endpoint, it's obvious anyway that capitalism has to go (because it doesn't even make any conceptual sense in a world where everyone has everything they want), but it's probable that we need to do away with it sooner rather than later if we want to get there.  As far as people's self-worth is concerned, I would posit that no one really wants to be defined by how much money they make at their job. Yes, people often need to feel like they are ""contributing"" or ""being productive"", but this does not necessarily have to mean doing so in an economic sense. Consider the sense of satisfaction you feel when volunteering or accomplishing something in your hobby. Post-scarcity would just free us up to do that sort of thing all the time. Would some people resent this? Maybe. Should that mean that we just stick with what we have now, where so many people are suffering under economic inequalities? I personally don't think so. And hey, we can always set aside some little island for those who really and truly want to live in a capitalist society, and let them run it however they want. In fact, why not let people experiment all over the place with different forms of government, etc. The point is that the world should be our playground, not our prison.  Regarding life extension: if I'm 100, and technology has given me another 50 healthy and happy and active years to live, why would I want to die just because I'm at the tail end of a ""natural"" lifespan? There's so much to do and see and create in this world that I simply cannot imagine why I'd be satisfied dying before I absolutely had to. Maybe other people feel differently, but the important thing is that they would have a choice in the matter. ""Immortality"" isn't about forcing people to stick around if they don't want to, it's about giving them that choice. That's how I see it, anyway."

Being smart, in the sense of being better able to solve problems, is better than being not smart so I would like to be as smart as possible.

Likewise, it will be necessary to change my mind and there for my personality so I have made myself comfortable with that.

One might say nootropics cure a nootropics deficiency, or that bionics cure a bionics deficiency, but I respond to that by saying we didn't have nootropics or bionics for millions of years, where as iodine was always part of our history and was something we never had to be careful of i'ts intake until this modern era where whole populations forgo eating seafood.  What might be able to effect whole populations over time is genetic engineering. If we eliminate the innate genetic disorders in our next generation, then the generation after that will be stronger, and the next even stronger as the technology become more refined and widely used. Here we are altering whole genepools by altering select individual who will be breeding with each other.  Vaccines are another good example, when every child gets vaccinated the whole population benefits, and vaccines are so cheap and widely available they have altered the limits on our population. They have made us superhuman, in a way, because we are no longer relying on our immune system alone, but instead have an advanced transhuman immune system."

Transhuman,1iw8xr,cakevodka,0,Thu Jul 25 00:52:49 2013 UTC,"OK. Consider this unrealistic but equivocal example: a mother decides to exercise her rights to do what she wants with her body at the expensive over her child... on purpose. She smokes, drinks, takes cocaine and refuses to eat anything other than Twinkies for 10 years then tries to have as many babies as possible for the financial support provided by the government. She doesn't vaccinate her baby because it is her right to not do so. Each baby she has is going into a home with little motherly support, the baby comes out of the womb with addictions, deficiencies, risks of diseases, and a horrible life ahead of it.  How is it moral for this mother to have and to exercise her rights of body when she is doing such harm against multiple human beings? And such harm against society as a whole, damaging the gene-pool like this?"
Transhuman,1iw8xr,Forevernade,2,Thu Jul 25 01:18:00 2013 UTC,"First, the welfare system and other government funding do not allow you to ""farm"" babies for profit. This was restructured years ago but people still use that example. I will not speculate here as to why it persists but it is no longer true and has not been true for decades. Pass it on.  Second this does not damage the gene pool of the baby, the genes of the baby are not altered, only the environment in which the genes are expressed is altered. Thus the gene pool is never under threat. I am not saying this to nitpick, I am saying it because it is an important distinction and good to know.  Third, cocaine use is already outlawed and punished. It is thus already enforced to some degree and is therefore not something you need to lobby for. This is therefore redundant for the purposes of your example.  Finally, while I agree this example is awful (though certain aspects are unlikely such as purposefully setting out to harm the child and farming the child for money, especially the latter as it is currently an impossible example) the fact is that once you set a precedent for choosing the child over the woman you are going down a very slippery slope. You have to evaluate whether the problem is so widespread and so heinous that it is worth depriving people of the rights to make their own choices about their body and live their own life. Personally I don't think anything short of imminent extinction could justify it and even then I would despise the option. Think about the kind of changes that would be required. How would you monitor this? Would you really force women to eat only healthy food? Where does it end? How would you like being told what was good for you and then forced to follow rigorous dietary standards or forbidden to drink?  I am not trying to make a personal attack, I just see some worrying flaws in the example you use. It seems very much like a straw man and the results of making this decision would be very serious. Just food for thought."

Not true. Iodine deficiencies appear in many regions where the soil simply doesn't have much iodine. You get large regions in Africa, South America, Europe, etc. Once you move away from the coasts (which is much of the world), you are at danger of iodine deficiency. Hence we find Roman recipes for curing goiter using seaweed ('modern era'?) and we find a ton of studies from the hinterlands of China where traditional poor villages ('modern era'?) have high cretinism rates.   Iodine is really an examle of curing deficiencies, rather than enhancing the population beyond the natural human capabilities.   Yeah. It's a one-time gain, unfortunately. I've been interested in iodization for a while an have compiled a little literature review and meta-analysis; unfortunately, there is little evidence that iodine can help adults. Too late, guys!

If you don't find a better balance now, then if we do get to a society with both extremely long lives and a post-scarcity economy where people just don't have to work as hard anymore, then you run the risk of becoming lost then and just not knowing what to do with all that time.  It's also worth mentioning that, just from a health and longevity point of view, it's been shown that people with more social interaction tend to live longer.   People who get married live longer, people with more friends live longer, people with family live longer, ect.   Having a social network is itself a kind of support mechanism; it both lowers your stress and helps you in the case of catastrophe, and it can keep you from aquiring self-destructive habits without noticing it.

As we move away from organic bodies, the divide between a synthetic intelligence and our own intelligence will blur. Reproduction may very well become an engineering feat, rather than a biological one. However, it may be a while before this happens. It all depends on how long we will cling to our biology. There may be a transitory period where babies are still born, but they are augmented after they have finished developing (or perhaps we will augment them immediately...)  I also feel that it is likely that we will reach a population plateau, where our species drastically decreases reproducing and stabilizes the population around a threshold. Whether this will occur via government or culture remains to be seen, but there is evidence that population growth slows significantly in developed countries as the standard of living increases. Perhaps this trend will continue as we transition into a post-human society? It would be nice if governments didn't have to step in and enforce reproductive laws to ensure a stable population."
Transhuman,1hjm42,chronoflect,1 point,Wed Jul 3 06:25:46 2013 UTC,"I hold an opposite view, are we forgetting one of the most important genetic mechanisms that has propelled us this far, that has extended our life cycles, intelligence, and creativity to this point? I am speaking of neoteny http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoteny ; which involves mature humans coming more and more to resemble immature mammals. Much larger cranium to body ratio, less hair, softer more delicate skin, the ability to still be able to learn later on in life, less aggressiveness, in short sexual reproduction that selects for the fairer type.   Can we deny that our species is desperately struggling with following this neotenization trend that we have been set upon for millenia, and propelled so fast in the last hundred thousand years for? Our commercialism wreaks of making adult humans look like little kids, our models are typically on the verge of anorexia maintaining the body weights of ten year olds, razors galore for shaving every part of the body, hell if a woman does not shave and depart with her natural adult look it is tantamount to completely unacceptable to many Americans today. Education being pushed into the thirties and even further for many people.. Soon the inecessity of having to work for food, survival, and housing. Adults are desperately and in a radical display trying to become children through technological and social means-- I believe humans were long ago set in the path of idealizing childhood and it's features. If you look at the lifespans of various mammals and many other animals you will notice a very popular trend of an organism typically spending one third of it's life in juvenility.  Now this would typically even be true for humans if not for our profound medical and sanitation progress. Extending juvenility is very much what we are doing  both socially and in the bigger picture through natural selection. The reason we all conform to this type of consumer regulation is there is a sexual and reproductive will latent and desiring to become more and more like the children we raise. A human being use to reach puberty at 6-8 years of age just a hundred thousand years ago, as we can tell by carbon dating and analysis of teeth and bones in archaeological samples.   I believe future humans if they followed their current evolutionary trend will be like large toddlers with incredible creativity, vulnerable but flexible and easily healed bodies, more small bones, perhaps a great capability for communication verging on natural telepathy.   But then again this is only if things continue to go the way they are going, and that is debatable if not unlikely.. if I shall offer an attack on my own argument."
Transhuman,1hjm42,Redditologer,2,Fri Sep 13 15:37:13 2013 UTC,"I actually agree with you, and I don't think our views differ all that much.  We idolize children. They have a sense of naivety and innocence that many people long to have again. They are constantly discovering things for the first time, and thus are easily amazed by the world around them. People tend to become cynical and apathetic as they mature, and many would likely wish to reverse this process. Not to mention the amazing learning and physical healing abilities that children posses. They also are symbolically ""pure"" in many societies, and their appearance is generally softer and easier on the eyes compared to mature adults.  However, I'm arguing that our society may eventually become childless in the sense that young people may no longer exist, or at least exist in much smaller quantities. Whether adults seek to emulate being a child again is besides the point. Visually, society in the far future may appear to still have a similar proportion of children that we see today. The reality, however, may be that many of these ""children"" are decades old (or perhaps centuries) and they are artificially maintaining their appearance to that of a child. They may even change their consciousness to more closely emulate a child's.   I believe future humans if they followed their current evolutionary trend will be like large toddlers with incredible creativity, vulnerable but flexible and easily healed bodies, more small bones, perhaps a great capability for communication verging on natural telepathy.    This isn't all that different from how I imagine the future to be like. Future humans will likely be incredibly creative and curious creatures, making leaps of logic that we could barely understand today. I believe they will be almost entirely synthetic, if not 100% so (although they may still have the appearance of a biological being) and thus they will not be vulnerable relative to how vulnerable humans are today. Along with this, brain-to-brain communication will likely be dominant through the use of various technologies. We may even see the death of language as we know it since we may no longer require words to convey ideas."

Transhuman,1hjm42,yself,3,Wed Jul 3 15:59:08 2013 UTC,"Even though I do think humans will continue to merge with machine intelligence and eventually become transhuman, I think the biological human species will likely persist very much as we know it for millions of years, yet with a remarkably longer life span for individuals. I think humans will resolve the overpopulation issue by reducing the number of their offspring. Instead of each generation producing a multiplying number of offspring, it will produce less. For example, if each human couple had only one child, the population would begin reducing at an exponential rate, by halving instead of doubling with each generation. This will gradually reduce the total population on the planet to a sustainable level.  With respect to the transhuman perspective, I think of it as similar to primate evolution. We see on the planet today a persistence of different primate species with a common ancestor. I think we should expect that the human species will similarly split into separate species in the future. Thus, the transhuman and the human species will exist simultaneously, and harmoniously. After all, we as intelligent creatures seek to preserve other species and prevent them from going extinct. So, we should expect intelligent transhumans to also seek to preserve the human species. Moreover this intelligent behavior will likely have a very strong drive due to the fact that they will view humans as their progenitors and a species with whom they share a common ancestry.  Furthermore, cultural anthropology teaches us that human cultures tend to resist change, even though they constantly change at the same time. I think this resistance to change will take the form of humans who resist the transition to the transhuman species. For example, we see something similar in the Almish culture in America. Thus, some humans will exercise their freedom of choice to remain human and continue to procreate as humans have always done."
Transhuman,1hjm42,yself,2,Wed Jul 3 15:07:32 2013 UTC,"Thus, the transhuman and the human species will exist simultaneously, and harmoniously.   I'd rather see coexistence, but I fear the homo-sapiens may experience a neanderthal-like decline when they are unable to reconcile their way of life with the existence of a superior species. As we reach a period of wide-spread transition, I believe a minority of the population will reject it with the majority actively pursuing post-human existence, and only a small percentage destined to ever experience a divided species for themselves."
Transhuman,1hjm42,Yxoque,1 point,Wed Jul 3 23:52:48 2013 UTC,"I fear the homo-sapiens may experience a neanderthal-like decline   Perhaps you've seen the evidence of possible interbreeding between modern humans and neanderthals. It's not clear to me that a neanderthal-like decline necessarily implies something tragic to fear. If the neanderthals simply interbred with modern humans, then they seem to have done well with respect to their progeny.  Part of the difficulty here involves the borderlines between biology and technology. In biological terms a 'species', refers to ""a group of organisms capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring."" However, we don't really have anything we recognize as a new species based strictly on technological differences. So, what would it mean to have a transhuman species, coexisting with the human species when the transhumans have emerged due to new technologies, possibly mechanical in nature rather than biological? Does that mean that the transhumans could no longer interbreed successfully with the humans? I think we can't really know, due to the relatively unpredictabile nature of the event horizon related to the Singularity. I guess that's really the answer to OP's question.   only a small percentage destined to ever experience a divided species for themselves.   I'm not sure how to parse the meaning of this. By definition of terms like 'wide-spread,' 'majority' and 'minority' when a new species emerges and becomes more wide-spread than the original species, then they switch places with respect to which one plays the role of the minority. So, it becomes a tautology to say that only a small percentage will experience a divided species after they become the minority. I'm not sure what ""for themselves"" means though.  If the distinction between transhumans and humans involves the fact that they will no longer be able to interbreed, then that would remove the element of choice from the picture. As long as the difference comes down to a free choice with some humans rejecting the transition to newer technologies, I think harmonious coexistence seems like the more likely consequence. In this case, those who remain in the minority population, despite all evidence of advantages for the post-human population, will do so for their own reasons.   Again, as an example, look at how the Almish view technology. For example, many of them have decided not to have telephones in their homes and they don't have personal cell phones. Meanwhile, the majority of the population on the planet consider the obvious advantages of such technologies as a necessity. Neither the majority population, nor the minority population consider this difference as a cause for one group to destroy the other. We simply accept our differences and coexist."

We will become overpopulated and begin to die off. Eventually this will lead to governmental action against procreation and our numbers will dwindle to a live-able level.   Societal change to sway from the feeling of wanting to reproduce will take much time. I do agree that eventually, past the upcoming plateau of the population curve, the number of children will be drastically reduced. It would just be senseless to bring a child into a world that can't hold it. And when people live a lot longer, or even forever, then what defines a ""child"" will be so drastically changed, that we may see having an immature human as being pointless. I mean, I've been alive for a hundred years and still am going great, why should me and my equally as aged wife want to, or need to, carry on our genes?  If we are guaranteed to live forever, unless killed, then we don't need to spread our genes. We may be the final embodiment of ourselves, and without the need to evolve, we will be perfectly happy with that. Essentially, a child free society would be the result of a perfection in evolution, either biological or technological,"
Transhuman,1hjm42,chyckun,2,Wed Jul 3 04:01:16 2013 UTC,"You make a good point, but I feel it needs to be expanded a wee bit.  For example, simply having a longer life-span doesn't necessarily negate the rationalization of what it means to want to have a family. I think there's a lot of complicated reasons for it, but it could be argued that one of the strongest drives for it is based on the human desire to want to create something, to build a 'dynasty through progeny', to invest in something that can and most likely will be greater than what you ever could be on your own.  No matter how long we end up living, so long as some sort of cultural association of identity and genetics, we'll probably keep seeing families emerge. With lifespan extensions, probably fewer, but probably larger.  Therefore I think the true 'death of the family' will probably occur with a genetic revolution. If dynamic synthetic intelligence or genetic modification becomes ubiquitous, when the lines start to blur about what makes you actually 'you', we'll probably see a huge cultural shift, one that not only threatens to annihilate the family, but the entire understanding of what 'identity' is or even means.  So... in a way: kill the ego, kill the babies."
Transhuman,1hjm42,tehbored,2,Wed Jul 3 07:02:00 2013 UTC,"I don't quite know if it's relevant, but it belongs in this general area. At some point it may not even be necessary to copulate to reproduce. If an egg cell was grown from my DNA, just changed to have the female chromosome, then you could in theory raise an exact replica of yourself. And if we do achieve mind uploading, you could freeze the replica of yourself at a young age, and when you die, unfreeze that body. Your mind could be transplanted onto this younger version of yourself, and you are essentially immortal if you repeat it forever.  It could take away the meaning of gender, the meaning of self. If you can just be planted onto another ""you"", and have hundreds of backup ""you""s in storage, what's the need to reproduce? There wouldn't even be a fear of death or sickness. You wouldn't need a family at this point, you could be everything to yourself. I stray a bit, but this is where I got to from the original topic. I want to expand so much more, but I don't feel this is the place. Maybe another thread concerning the possibility of having an infinite store of bodies to transfer your mind to when you die?"

I'm saying we shouldn't dismiss something we actually know nothing about.  Edit2: from the intro  Not to say that Transhumanism is founded on anything but an explicitly materialist basis, but it does nevertheless address those questions that might once have been the sole province of religion – those of life, death, deity (of a sort), immortality, resurrection and the destiny of the universe."
Transhuman,1h4mje,AmonZero,3,Thu Jun 27 18:54:36 2013 UTC,"Hi All - Just a clarification: It's true that The Praxis was written by a Zero State member (Dirk Bruere), and that Transhumanity.net is now owned and being re-built by ZS. The two don't really have anything to do with each other though, and being part of ZS doesn't have to mean knowing or caring about Praxis. Some like to explore spiritual ideas in a Transhumanist context, and the Praxis is one of a number of ways to do that.  Long story short, no-one is being told they should think about Transhumanism in spiritual terms, least of all within ZS, which has its fair share of hardcore secularists. On the other hand, it seems there are plenty of atheist transhumanists who get really upset when their idea of what Transhumanism should be isn't followed to the letter. Maybe people should lighten up a little, and let different people explore new ideas, technologies, and possibilities in different ways. What would be so wrong with that?"

You all seem more focused on appealing to the lowest common denominator with metaphorical bullshit and being as neutral as possible than creating actual advocacy for transhumanism. This, the stir caused by Humanity+'s BOD election as well as the fact that people like Zoltan Istvan is being praised for his recent overhumanist book has alienated me from calling myself a transhumanist.

I disagree with you about spirituality having no place in a trans- or posthuman future, and of course there's nothing bad about stating your opinion as long as you allow other people the same courtesy, which you seem to be saying you do (I'm very glad to note).  It's just that I've come across a strident minority - particularly here on Reddit - who have some narrow ideas about what is or isn't okay and are extremely dogmatic about what what should or shouldn't be allowed. If Transhumanism isn't to be written off as some fringe weirdo cult then, ironically, you have to allow multiplicity of ideas and attitudes. Doesn't mean we can't all have personal preferences and draw some important lines, of course, but we have to be reasonable at the same time. This isn't just about spirituality, FWIW... I've come across people denying that the arts, culture, politics, economics - none of it is relevant, only science and technology at its purest is. That's an absurdly narrow point of view, made doubly ridiculous by the fact that a good number of such cheerleaders for tech-and-nothing-but-tech aren't even working scientists themselves.  As it happens, I think that spirituality can have a profound impact on how the future unfolds. Only a fool would say that religious points of view have had no impact on the widespread adoption of scientific ideas and tools. One approach would be to encourage adoption of pro-tech ideas by religious people, and that's part of the Praxis idea, as I understand it. Alternatively, we could just divide the world into Transhumanists versus religious people, arts lovers, people who care about politics or economics or culture... and we'll lose. In fact, we won't even rate as a big enough factor to even be losers - we won't have been in the race at all. What we want simply won't matter, because we'll have sidelined ourselves. That's hardly a sign of high intelligence, and I would hope we can do better.

I had very anti-theistic sentiments when I was younger and it still pops up every now and then. However I'm aware of the pros of religious viewpoints that have impacted the world. I'm also aware of the cons. Regardless, some of the first humanists were rather religious themselves. But my main gripe with encouraging pro-tech ideas in religious people is that there is so much that could go wrong. Even today I see churches using technology in a manner that attempts to legitimize their delusions; their faith.   With that I'm more inclined to support organizations that try to remain in the center of the political spectrum (like ZS), yet at the same time it could lead to a flurry of sycophants from the left and right joining up. ZS's non-duality approach to things is both alarming and frustrating to see because of that. This is why I made the accusation of the Praxis being counterproductive. It just seems like it's ritualizing already existing social bonds that people have with each other. It's not really doing anything but making things look pretty and formal.

I was just day dreaming one day on a particularly long commute and thought about how the brain worked, and how it is essentially binary with the electrical pulses acting as the on/off, and how if you could extrapolate that thought into the realm of computing one could reach the conclusion that consciousness theoretically could be translated into a digital form. Then that led to the thought of how my limbs worked and how they are essentially machines built to work within the framework of the existing capabilities of the mind. I thought about how the human body is an amazing mechanism when you consider that it's made entirely of self replicating organic matter, and as completely mind blowing as that is, it's still limited by the physical reality of the human body. If we could use the organic body as a stepping off point then we would only be limited by our engineering ability. If the consciousness was digital, then it could be stored as a cloud-based central consciousness and the body would be a disposable means of physically traversing any physical space. Take that idea and then imagine the possibilities of our species. Did I mention that this was a really long commute? Anyway, after assuming that I was a crazy person to think about this kind of stuff I decided to look around and see if anyone else was digging on this.

Many people who post in this subreddit do, and I don't understand their fanaticism.  Generally speaking, Transhumanist communities tend to be one large circlejerk of idiots who wish they lived in a post-future world where technology is magical.    I just look at it as if it is the natural cultural evolution of our species, and as we progress into the future, we progress as a technological species.  I didn't need to see any propaganda from screwball whack jobs like Ray Kurzweil to realize that humanity should augment itself with its technological creations.  We already do that, and have done so my entire life.   And when/how did you find this sub?   I used reddit's search feature back when there were only a few hundred users."
Transhuman,1h0lfm,azuretek,4,Tue Jun 25 14:28:04 2013 UTC,I'm in the same boat as you. I think Ray Kurzweil and proponents of the singularity are being needlessly sensationalist. We already benefit from technology and will continue to do so into the future. There will be no event that happens that changes our world view. As with most societal changes it will happen naturally and we'll only see how far we've gone when we look back.  That being said I have beliefs about immortality through computer uploading etc. that a lot of people dismiss as crazy but I just see as part of a natural evolution. I do get frustrated when articles come out claiming we'll all be uploaded in 20 years. I only hope by the time I die we'll have a reliable way to map the brain as to revive myself virtually in hundreds of years (hopefully sooner).

I'm not saying that a clone is physically the same thing. It is a fully functional replica that is no different in any way than I am (other than of course that it's made up of entirely different atoms).  If I use a 3D printer to print out a perfect square block twice, anyone would agree they are totally interchangeable. The two blocks function, appear and exist the exact same way as each other. The only difference is their coordinates, one is here, and the other is there (other than of course that they're made up of entirely different atoms). They are both exact duplicates, one can be used in place of the other and nobody would notice the difference.  Now lets apply that to a perfect clone, they are exact duplicates, even though one came first it is still exactly the same in every way (other than different atoms of course)as the other one. My only point is that regardless of how you feel about things, a clone of me is as equal to me as the real thing.

Transhuman,1h0lfm,crashd5,2,Wed Jun 26 04:51:18 2013 UTC,"In high school and college, I was an art student working in experimental photography and sculpture. My focus was often on post-human civilizations - what will life and culture look like after our society is dead and gone. For example, my biggest project was building a religion (and the artifacts of that religion) that might be made by a group of future pre-humans after they discover things like televisions, computers, and cell phones. It was a lot of stuff that I eventually grew out of, but studying contemporary artists for inspiration led me to body modders like Orlan and Lepht Anonym, and eventually to documentaries like Kurzweil's Transcendent Man.  These days, I don't put much stock in the ideas of any of those three, but I've been hooked on trans-and-post-humanism ever since. I don't have the biology or tech backgrounds to worry too much about the actual physical work of the field, so I'm much more interested in the cultural ramifications of it. The novel I'm currently working on explores the idea of American society after the discovery of immortality, and what happens to religion and culture when death is no longer unavoidable.  This was one of the first subs I joined when I made my Reddit account - though I admit I've considered dropping it a number of times. Unlike most of the users here, I don't really care what amazing tech the Russians say they'll have developed in 30 or 40 years.

Transhuman,1gzgb1,virtuosomaximoso,4,Tue Jun 25 04:42:46 2013 UTC,I wouldn't really consider it high energy.  It doesn't contain enough juice to hurt you if it malfunctions and it doesn't emit ionizing radiation so I think you are overreacting a bit.  Do you use a cellphone telephone?

Transhuman,1gv3aw,McWizzle,3,Fri Jun 28 18:32:23 2013 UTC,"Well, there's been a fair amount of evidence for health and longevity benefits of both tea (especially green tea) and coffee lately.   The coffee one is especially interesting, since until recently it was thought to be unhealthy, but recent studies have shown that it is linked to decreased risk of cancer, decreased risk of Alzheimer's, and decreased mortality from all causes."
Transhuman,1gv3aw,Yosarian2,3,Sat Jun 22 17:19:49 2013 UTC,"If we're talking about drugs that might improve longevity and slow the aging process, there are some things that are being studied right now.  NOTE that I would not recommend experimenting on yourself with ANY of these right now, most of them have only been tried in mice for longevity purposes and probably the best bet is to wait until we have more information.   These are things I am keeping an eye on personally, but I am not currently using any of them myself, and I wouldn't recommend anyone else do so until we have better information.  Remember that just because something works in mice it doesn't mean it works in people.  With that disclaimer out of the way:  Resveratrol- One of a group of drugs that are an attempt to be a CR-mimic, to create the same effect as caloric restriction.  Unfortunately, may not actually extend longevity in mammals by itself, but may have other health benefits; it does seem to extend longevity in mammals that are overweight.  Unlike some of the others, since it is found in red wine it can be sold as an herbal supplement, although I read that some of the resveratrol herbal supplements you can buy have badly degraded proteans and may not work very well.  Metformin- Right now it's used as a diabetes drug to regulate blood sugar, but it might also have a side effect of slowing the aging process as well.  This might be because blood sugar spikes accelerate aging even in healthy people, or metformin might be acting as a CR-mimic, it's hard to say.   One risk from this one is a slight risk of lactic acid buildup.    Rapamycin-This one is pretty exciting, at least as far as mouse studies go, but it's potentially risky, since it is thought to be an immune-suppressant in humans.  Still, unlike calorie restriction itself, it seems to have a significant effect on the health and lifespan even of older mice.  TA-65: Unlike all the others, this one is specifically designed to increase telomere length.  Like anything that increases, telomerase, there are possible risks of cancer involved here, although that did not show up in mouse studies.   It's not clear how much aging in humans is caused by shortening telomeres; it may be one factor, but it's probably not the largest.  Baby aspirin: Just thought I'd throw this in here.   The anti-inflamatory effects of aspirin do seem to lower your risk of heart attack and stroke, and it seems that general ""low-level inflammation"" is actually related to a lot of diseases of aging, so it might have more generalized benefits as well.   Possible side effects include stomach problems and, like all blood thinners, there is a risk of increased bleeding."

There was a recent study that it helps prevent alzhimer's, but it probably doesn't do much for longevity for healthy mammals.  Probably the best hope here isn't resveratrol itself, which is a ""dirty drug"" that has many targets, it's that Sinclair's biotech company can use it to create a more targeted CR mimic that can slow aging with less side effects."

It's actually a pretty cool idea for how to make a neural net-like system that may work better, by imitating one feature of the human brain.   Instead of being based on specific nodes, the way neural nets now do, his idea is that instead the human brain is made up of specific modules that are about 100 neurons each, which on the simplest level recognize certain patters, and then other modules that use those modules to recognize larger objects, and then higher level modules that use those modules to form broader pictures, ect.  He's got some interesting neuroscience to back up his theory that that's how the brain works, but personally I'm more interested in if it actually works to make a better AI then the kinds of neural nets we use now (and that's probably Google's main concern as well)"

If you could connect a nanobot to every neuron in the brain or the parts that really matter and then network those bots to a computer network outside the brain you would then have a distributed consciousness that would not be tied to just your organic brain anymore. After the connections were made you could then start the process of pruning off the real neurons, just like your organic brain does now, but in a controlled manner. Consciousness is all about communication. If you can expand neural communication outside the brain, you will find a way to a new substrate. This process, however, will probably feel like dying in some ways, and would profoundly alter the way you think, which hopefully would be for the better."

As  the computer attached to your brain gets better and better (Moore's law and all that), the organic part of your mind would eventually be dwarfed by the digital part of your mind, which would eventually be a billion times more powerful.

More succinctly, what is necessary to achieve consciousness? To answer that, you should first explain what consciousness is.    Here's my take: MS Windows is conscious.   Self-aware (version number, place on the HDD, serial #, etc.) Aware of its internal processes (task manager, hardware monitor, security settings, etc.) Interacts with environment (the GUI, Windows Update, all the networking stuff, etc.) Internally motivated (wants to be updated, wants to be secure, wants user to buy Microsoft products, avoids system crashes and instability)   Indeed, its consciousness is alien to us. Stiff, cold, and limited compared to the rich sensual/emotional rollercoaster experience we humans have the privelege to live on a daily basis. It has none of the drive to explore or to learn or to create that we share, as humans. But a lazy asshole content to watch TV and cash in food stamps is no less conscious than Bill Gates or Chris Hadfield or you or I. Simply, different.    I don't have a good definition of consciousness, nor do I have a way to measure it. My intuition tells me that introspection, sensation, and expression are necessary components for a process to be deemed ""conscious"" to some degree. The degree of complexity of these processes form a gradient, so we can consider some processes (the human brain) to be ""more conscious"" than other processes (the Windows operating system).  However, my intuition also tells me that artificial computing systems ultimately have greater potential for consciousness than biological systems. To realise this, consider a Matrioshka Brain as an (absurd) extreme. I find it difficult to conceive of any system of biological minds able to compete. When, where, and how this potential will be realised, is another question entirely."
Transhuman,1gpdqx,TheWalruss,3,Fri Jun 21 03:56:56 2013 UTC,"If you get two neurons, you could argue that the spark created between the two are conscious. Consciousness seems wrapped in this mystery.  Infact if you get a bunch of neurons in a petri dish you can ""compute"". If you get enough you will end up with a brain capable of interpreting input and thought. All indications suggest that this is itself conscious.  It is, as Hofstader describes it, a strange loop. It's a floating system, like an ocean, or an ecosystem. It's not a set of dominos.  Now why isn't a set of dominos conscious? because WE are the one's ascribing meaning to that process. WE'RE the consciousness that decides those actions have intelligence. We look at the flow of dominos turning right or turning left and decide that it is AWARE of why it made that decision. No. sequential systems like this are unaware of their history. It's like following the outcome of a roulette game and suggesting that the meaning we see in the number is some indication of a greater pattern.  Now if you're arguing that MS Windows and a complex row of dominos are conscious, we're talking about something very different. You would be suggesting that all atoms in the universe are on some level conscious, and all it takes for that to be ""self aware"" is to organise them into a history aware loop. You might be onto something, and it might be the BEGINNINGS of a discussion that allows us to engineer conscious life.

The act of creating AI is the act of quantifying a complex system. You can't ACTUALLY quantify complex systems without directly replicating complex systems, though you can do convincing low level emulations of them that are superficially similar.   Your future ""uploaded self"" would be this convincing, low level emulation. Don't believe me?   Well here's a thought experiment: I just uploaded your consciousness... feel any different?"
Transhuman,1gpdqx,bitcloud,5,Thu Jun 20 17:30:10 2013 UTC,"No because the unique structure of a simultaneous megacluster of quantum level processess like a brain is fundamentally different to an abstracted concurrent string sequence of single transistor processes.    There is no reason to think that there is anything quantum going on in the brain.   It seems pretty unlikely, actually, considering the scale at which the brain operates; neurons are far to big for quantum effects.  If there is, then even that wouldn't necessarally be a show-stopper, it might just mean we would need to use quantum computing.  But it seems unlikely that that'll even be an issue.  Anyway, in theory, you should be able to model and emulate any real, physical system to any degree of accuracy in a general purpose computer, if the computer was powerful enough and if we had enough data about the system.   There is no known reason why in theory you wouldn't be able to create an emulated brain in software that would act like a brain in every way, including thought and consciousness."
Transhuman,1gpdqx,Yosarian2,0,Thu Jun 20 17:37:37 2013 UTC,"There is no reason to think that there is anything quantum going on in the brain.   There's no reason to think there's not. It seems the laws of physics are all in play in the brain.   That's the classic mistake simple systems advocates make. They simulate a few particles in the computer and think it represents an ocean. They throw a few data points into the system - enough to give a superficially convincing result, and think they've solved the complex system.  To recreate a complex system like fluid dynamics, the ecosystem, or a brain, you literally need your system to be AS complex as that system.  For a bit of context, the brain is a trillion trillion atoms, with 1000 trillion connections, all running on the deepest levels of physics and being affected by every external force, wavelength, magnetism and other sensory input.  If you think you can distill this down to a computer running a bit of parallel processing, I would say that it's not the computer rising to meet your needs as a conscious entity, but rather you lowering yourself to the capacity of the computer."
Transhuman,1gpdqx,bitcloud,1 point,Thu Jun 20 18:28:59 2013 UTC,"There's no reason to think there's not.   Except that neurons are millions of times to big for that to happen?  Quantum forces only become significant at the absolutely smallest levels.  And even then, if it's just a matter of things becoming slightly fuzzy, that actually happens in our computer chips, it's becoming a serious problem as we get down to 24 nanometers.   It would only be relevant if the brain was actually somehow using quantum entitlement to think with like a quantum computer does, and if you know the physics behind that, I think there's just no way to make that case.  For one thing the brain would have to be close to absolute zero for that to be possible with electrons.   That's the classic mistake simple systems advocates make. They simulate a few particles in the computer and think it represents an ocean. They throw a few data points into the system - enough to give a superficially convincing result, and think they've solved the complex system.   What?  Who claimed that we could model a few neurons and that would give us a working brain?  Obviously you would have to model the whole thing.   To recreate a complex system like fluid dynamics, the ecosystem, or a brain, you literally need your system to be AS complex as that system.   Yes.    Kurzweil figured out in his book about how many bits of information you would need to create a system as complciated as the human brain, looked at his moore's law graph, and estimated that we'd do it by abotu 2029.     I don't necessarally agree with that, it seems a little too optimisic here, but you seem to be just dismissing things without actually taking the time to learn what the people on the other side are actually arguing.  Yes, we're talking about a system as complicated as the human brain.  No, that doesn't mean you have to model every atom, but you would have to model every neuron and every possible action that every neuron could do, as well as hormones and other things that affect the brain.   It's an incredibly difficult task, and everyone understands that.      If you think you can distill this down to a computer running a bit of parallel processing   Uh.   No, it would be a computer running a lot of serial processing.  But sure, you could in theory emulate it in a computer.  Given enough data, and a powerful enough computer, you can simulate any physical system inside a computer, up to and including the entire universe itself.     Now, if you want to argue about how practical that is going to be, or when we might be able to do it, feel free, but the brain is a physical system made up of about ten pounds of squishy wet matter, and there is absolutely no reason to think that some other physical system won't be able to do the same things the brain does.      Of course, the brain is also quite inefficient as a thinking machine, so it's theoretically possible that we'll create a true general AI that is conscious and smarter then we from the ground up are long before we can emulate the brain, but that's basically a software problem and it's a lot harder to predict when that will happen."
Transhuman,1gpdqx,ZombiezuRFER,0,Thu Jun 20 11:39:00 2013 UTC,"Obviously you would have to model the whole thing.   Therein lies the problem.  Even ""modeling"" the whole thing isn't ""the whole thing"". There are many problems in trying to simulate an infinitely parallel complex system (of which I'm sure you're aware)   Who claimed that we could model a few neurons   That's the thing about complex systems. They're INFINITELY complex. You can model a working version of an ecosystem by representing component parts that act in a complex manner. They DON'T however act in that complex manner for the same reasons. At it's foundation the model of an ecosystem is just that - a model - an emulation - a simulation.   It's an aesthetically similar, superficially accurate seeming, but entirely alien to it's source data set. It's VERY thin, and nowhere near as parallel as a trillion trillion trillion connections all running in parallel. Yes, you could emulate it WITH an ecosystem, and if that's your position I concede.  The same applies to a brain. You can suggest a neuron could be emulated by some other abstraction, and look at the overarching superficial similarities and call it conscious, but you would be a fool to do so. No matter how pretty the ecosystem simulation is, or how convincing the brain simulation is, there's a fundamental discrepancy between the superficial appearance and the INCOMPREHENSIBLE depth of process that underly that surface appearance   Amazing, certainly. Conscious? Nothing would suggest this."

""Control over other people"" has nothing all to do with transhumanism.   In fact, it's the exact opposite of the humanism that is a key part of transhumanistic philosophy.  As I said, the key to transhumanism is the idea of individual control over their own bodies.  If you want to genetically engineer yourself so you'll be healthier, or if you want to stimulate your brain to make yourself smarter, you should have the right do to do that, but you personally should have complete control over it, and you are the one taking on any risks involved.   It's very much a hacker mentality, but instead of hacking a computer, it's the idea of hacking yourself.

I've always felt that was the normal thing to ask. Ever since I actually started thinking about stuff (around 14) I've held these beliefs. It took me quite a long time before I realized that not everyone holds those beliefs and that there was an actual term for it.

This is what really drew me into the idea of transhumanism.    I want to get back into shape, since not caring about my body would go against the ideal of a better body/mind.

I've been researching and using nootropics for months, and I'm a health fanatic. I can say I first started this thinking about two years ago when I started a minimalist lifestyle, and ended up being a loyal subscriber to /r/minimalism. It was my first taste of being mentally above the rest of the world. I felt more open than I have ever been, clearing up my life and thinking. I now follow a loose, but very minimal life. There are but 4 things on the wall in my room, the Chinese characters for Peace, Wisdom, Happiness, and Prosperity. I have had lots of trouble this past year in school, despite being very intellectual and competing in a science scholar competition and such. I have problems focusing, and through some offhand way, I found the sub /r/nootropics. I then spent months planning and researching stacks to build me up to be the best I could be. I now follow a flexible stack and supplement additional things to it when possible. And I have never been more 'transhuman' than I have on this. Then in the corner or the reccomended subreddits of /r/nootropics, it listed /r/transhuman. I've heard the term before, but decided to check it out. I was imediately off put as thinking you were all a bunch of wackos who wanted to become cyborgs. But then I thought deeper about it, and went more into here. I read through a couple magazines from H+, lots of articles, and many experiences on this sub. I can now say I identify as a transhumanist, and through this culture that has been opened up to me, I see a nearly limitless playing field of ways to improve myself as a human, and as a person.   /r/transhuman and /r/nootropics may very well be what I have been looking for, this edge to push me to greatness.

I was imediately off put as thinking you were all a bunch of wackos who wanted to become cyborgs.   Admittedly, this was similar to my way of thinking when I was first exposed to the transhumanist culture. Though once I thought about the ideas the people actually had and the reasoning behind them, the kind of insight that reddit actually helped me develop, I found myself to be the same in my own way. I've always been interested in the progression of technology so it wasn't long till I had some pretty similar ideas, just to my own degree.

If it wasn't self-aware and just used as a simple calculation device it would surpass anything silicon-based, as the electrons travel faster along our wet material than sand. The human body is the same way, as people pointed out the body self-heals (and procreates). If anything the organic biological basis to the human body will become augmented with nano-machines, but only to survive the intentional polluting of the atmosphere (and conveniently hook people's brains into a hivemind). That's not really an advantage when you think about it (compared to now with our relatively clean environment where superpowers aren't required to survive, and free will).  I reckon prosthetic limbs won't be necessary too far in the future as new ones will be able to be grown, or grafted on."

Very innovative way to get around the fact that it can't read minds but only broad mental states like interest.  You should actually be able to come up with a more interesting monster this way than even with direct mind reading.

Transhuman,1fmo92,fm2030,3,Tue Jun 4 03:35:07 2013 UTC,"(I posted this comment on that blog as well)  Another thing worth considering is that a lot of progress on life extension may be reached through mainstream medical research, even without ""radical life extension"" as a main goal.  Things like stem cell research, organ bioprinting, genetic therapy, better artificial organs, and better ways to treat cancer and Alzheimer's are areas that could move us significantly in the direction of radial life extension, and those are all areas of significant research by mainstream medical science.     While advocating for radical life extension, on a parallel track, we should also advocate for more medical and biological research in general, which might be an easier sell for politicians right now."
Transhuman,1fmo92,Yosarian2,1 point,Wed Jun 5 09:27:27 2013 UTC,"I would tend to disagree that we need to advocate for more medical/biological research in general as well. I think all of the RLE-aware people should focus all their efforts to RLE advocacy.  There is enough advocacy/awareness about medical research that those scientists are swimming in money, public and private, and still they don't direct any/much of that money towards goal-directed RLE research. As an example, Larry Page recently acquired vocal chord paralysis (VCP) and he threw $12 million towards a VCP research center, just like that. And I wish I could let him know that he has a disease, called aging, that needs a lot more attention, and which he needs to be a lot more worried about. Imagine how much difference he could make in terms of public awareness if he threw $12 million towards SENS or something similar.  Even though radical breakthroughs like stem cell, genetic therapy, etc came out of non-RLE research community, if we simply use these technologies to ""replace"" damaged organs instead of ""preventing"" damage in the first place, it would always be a loosing battle. And the most likely way to achieve prevention is to tackle the issue directly.  I personally think we are at a point in time in terms of medical progress where we need to take the RLE issue head on with a focused commitment instead of looking forward to indirect solutions through non-RLE breakthroughs (which are going to happen anyway because it's not a zero sum game; it's not that the moment public/politicians realize the importance of RLE they would start reducing funding in non-RLE areas)."

I think that a lot of the mainstream medical research is likely to significantly increase lifespan, though.   I mean, if you look at Grey's plan, he is counting on getting dramatic improvements in gene therapy, better stem cell therapy, ect, and those are things that mainstream medicine is putting a lot of money into right now.  Mainstream medicine is also making a lot of progress towards curing cancer, and I think that's something that we absolutely are going to need to do if we're going to get any significant amount of biological longevity.     A lot of mainstream medical research also has alternate uses, like for example it looks like a lot of the technology that they're using to target and kill cancer cells will also be useful for dealing with cell senescence.    Also, I wouldn't undervalue the benefits of things like cloning replacement organs.  I suspect that, at least for the near future, any successful life-extending strategy will include both preventing damage and replacing damaged organs, and organ replacement alone is likely to add to your potential lifespan significantly, increasing the odds of bootstrapping to the next treatment.  In any case, at this stage of research, relying on any one approach for longevity seems like a bad idea; there are a number of possible approaches to extend life, and we don't have enough information yet to risk putting all our eggs in one basket.  (It's also worth mentioning that the longer you live, the more important it becomes to deal with problems of infectious disease and all that, especially as germs evolve to become more antibiotic-resistant).  I would agree with you that the priorities of mainstream medicine are often wrong, but at the same time, I don't think we're going to get there without significant advances in mainstream medicine.  I think that things like the recent cuts to medical research from the Sequester are slowing down cancer research right now, and that's really frustrating."

Optimally you'd want to place it the magnet in your offhand ring finger, as it is the weakest finger and required least for gripping and manipulation (obviously guitar is an exception).  I wouldn't recommend putting it in your knuckle or even on your pinky, as that exposes the magnet to more impacts.  What I'd suggest is putting it in your right ring finger about .5cm from the tip and halfway between the pad and the side facing the pinky.

Consequently, this research is extremely difficult to perform without a large, well-equipped laboratory, and few researchers have had the means to study the subject properly.   If we do not get LENR by the time we get advanced nanotech we will definitely get it after. So nanotech has the potential to solve all of the world's energy problems.

This thinking is the same for all new high tech:   You got a cure for AIDS, but it will be costly, thus only for the 1% at first, but is it a reason not to research a cure for AIDS?  No of course, as the prices will fall with the industrialisation of the production process.  Here you would get a cure for aging, but it would be costly, thus only for the 1% at first, but is it a reason not to research a cure for aging?  Same answer, no.  Of course, first we should abolish patents, else a big company could hold on its drugs, and only sell for the 1% and license to the other companies at high cost.

Our civilisation will enter a new era, one of great opportunities and discoveries: we will become the first interplanetary specie we know of. This will accomodate for population growth, which shall I remember you, is slowing down in countries that are industrialising as not as much children die young/are needed for labour + with the globalisation, cultures mixes, which makes some ethnies' tendency to reproduce a lot to go down.  Finally, not even considering interplanetary societies, asteroid mining allow for enormous supply of rare earth elements, which are needed for all electronics and are seriously limited in supplies on earth, yet abundant in asteroids.

Transhuman,1efd0x,Nesteabottle,2,Fri Jun 28 13:38:52 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I just don't see someone stealing my RFID tag to break into my house or computer as even remotely as likely as just breaking through my window or taking my computer. The new world order thing I just don't understand. I think it's like, if you get hit with an huge blast of energy (from a doomsday weapon) then it will heat up the implant and burn the mark of the beast into you? Or something? I feel like earrings or any other metal accessory would do the same thing."
Transhuman,1efd0x,Hplusmepls,1 point,Fri May 17 03:43:41 2013 UTC,"That's a complete mis-representation of the issue. I agree a lot of this new world order talk is over the top. But mark of the beast? That's your nonsense, not any words I used.  The issue is that it's already increasingly faux-pas to speak against the government, and they are already beefing up measures to stop you from doing it. There's no energy blast of which you speak, but it wouldn't be hard to mess with the chip, or delete the identification tied to the chip. Like I said, many times, I like the idea of RFID and integrating tech with human biology. But, we should consider possibilities, develop preemptive measures to.prevent those possibilities, instead of waiting untill the issue is at hand and dealing with it then."
Transhuman,1efd0x,Nesteabottle,2,Fri May 17 04:14:16 2013 UTC,"Ah sorry, I didn't see the whole discussion above. I was just responding to Hplusmepls, there really are some crazy people who think that an RFID implant marks you as one of Satan's minions. Weird shit. The chips are unsecure as hell."

Transhuman,1efd0x,Hplusmepls,2,Mon May 20 14:28:59 2013 UTC,"No I understand that fear completely but a new world order and one government wouldn't bread absolute control to one person the single government would be subject to exactly the same penalty as any government is today except for the fact with no competition there would be no conflict. No money would need to be spent on military, no excuse of ""Their not part of my country, so I'm not helping"", infrastructure would spread throughout the world, travel would be in consequential, no visas would be needed. There are a lot of upsides that no one ever mentions. but the problem is reaching a universal compromise between all current governments be they democratic, communist, fascist, libertarian, etc. and that will probably never happen.  Also religion would be detrimental to its success and due to how embedded religion is some powerful nations. Back to the point though, as all that's a little off topic I still don't understand how offering RFID chips to people is a pathway to a new world order or what any entity powerful enough to consider orchestrating a single world government would be interested in access to my computer, where I shop, where I go or any possible application of an RFID chip."

Hypothetical here, imagine they really are not out for our best interests, speak against.them and all they have to do is fry your chip. I no, sounds scqry, but that doesnt merit shrugging it off as a conspiracy. Other than that one thing I actually like the idea of rfid chips AND a one world under one flag sort of system. But, you have to admit, sounds elitist, no?"
Transhuman,1efd0x,Hplusmepls,2,Fri May 17 06:38:03 2013 UTC,"Whats frying your chip going to do? give you a sore hand? Even that's unlikely And how are they going to do it, Since they only work from about 3 ft, less for passive RFID's. Sure it sounds scary but it's not, if you really think about it. If the government wanted you dead they'd just do it with a bullet, or a bomb, or a knife, or drugs, yea there's a lot of more efficient ways to do it."

The paths and connections are what form the data layer, but certain structures in the brain perform operations (AND, OR, etc.).  The issue I see with cryogenics is that without brain activity neurons quickly deteriorate. All the methods that we have so far to preserve people don't preserve neural pathways. I personally think the way we'll be resurrected is some sort of image copy of our neurons. We'll just have to wait until they can emulate that image using a computer. Our bodies will not last."

Transhuman,1edx7g,cortheas,1 point,Thu May 16 00:36:29 2013 UTC,"When people go into a coma their brain's connections are scrambled.  This also happens after severe concussions, strokes, etc.  After shock therapy or conditions that provoke similar responses, our brain is intentionally ""turned off"" and it resets itself.  People need rehab, but many of them them retain all or most of their memories and feel personal continuity after severe brain injury.  I don't expect it would be very different after freezing.  Plus, there would be computer models that would attempt to reconstruct some of the initial conditions.  I don't see why they couldn't turn you on and off under 1000 different conditions and then finally use the one that worked best, based on something like self-reporting."
Transhuman,1edx7g,polarix,2,Thu May 16 02:23:59 2013 UTC,"It hasn't ever been demonstrated to work. There's not even a particularly good theoretical model of how future cryonics could work. There's also relatively little investment currently going into the field as far as i know, certainly not enough to make it viable in the short term.   As an economic model it doesn't make sense either, you give them money now and hypothetically in the future they revive you. But presumably if its an expensive procedure (it will be) and you haven't given them enough for it to be profitable, you won't be revived."
Transhuman,1edx7g,alexgmcm,1 point,Thu May 16 04:20:34 2013 UTC,"The assumption is that there's enough intrinsic desire to revive people for the earliest cryonics patients to be revived eventually.

Quantum crystals are implausible on the their face, whereas cryonics is simply untested, has many unknowns and has just as many potential failure points.    But let's assume as I do that the process may be flawed in some way or the administration bungled and it ends up being wasted money.  What probability of success do we need to accept before it becomes worthwhile?  For me, spending $100K at the time of my death for--I'm guessing--a 1- to 10% chance of immortality is a good value proposition.  If the odds of my consciousness being reanimated in some way in the future were as low as 0.05% I would probably still buy in.  What do I need $100K for when I'm dead?"

Transhuman,1ec4kp,TheSliceman,0,Sat May 18 07:27:53 2013 UTC,"imho, whereas most people tend not to think about the possible implications of technological change on society, full stop, transhumanists tend not to think about the possible negative implications of technological change on society. (Western) society is enthusiastic about technologies that do not present any obvious threat to current dominant culture and the political system as it is generally narrated (smartphones, videogames, HD, Netflix, but not drones or maybe Google Glass). Transhumanism, in my view, is an umbrella term for all those views that embrace certain technologies because they have the potential to overturn and transform. So in my view all transhumanists are orphans of Christian (redemptive) and prosperity/development (modernist/progressive) narratives, unwilling to accept or incapable of accepting the current dominant narrative of development and democracy understood as a technologically and culturally neutral (or stable) globalization, while at the same time maintaining those values (progress and redemption) in more or less scripted (conventional/mainstream) form. People who actually think seriously about the unpredictability and danger of these transformations rarely identify as transhumanists and are more willing to engage with the ways in which technologies have already transformed or overturned society throughout history. Transhumanists believe that technology will change us fundamentally, without acknowledging that technology has changed us fundamentally, and in fact, that we have never existed in isolation from technology. Transhumanism is materialist millennialism. That's what I think it is.  I think there is a narrative on transhumanism in mainstream culture too, although the word itself is not used (i.e. people don't know the word, but presented with transhumanist material, they 'know' what they're looking at). That narrative is wrapped up in terms like 'geeks' and 'sci-fi.' Sci-fi because all aspects of the transhumanist narrative (the version that emerges in this sub) are digested by the mainstream culture as purely ('merely') fictional, so transhumanists are represented as geeks who spend all day fantasizing about things that have no bearing on reality ('reality' being ungeeky stuff like smartphones, family obligations, gay marriage and other hotbutton political issues, job, car, house, etc.).  tl;dr: I have a P.h.D. in Armchair Pedantry"
Transhuman,1ecu59,treepig,7,Wed May 15 01:55:36 2013 UTC,"In quantum physics, objects are not determined things, objects are possibilities. Possibilities of what? Possibilities for consciousness to choose from. Can God be talked about in terms of science, which always analyzes, reduces things to other things?    (first words spoken in the film)  I commend your search of truth, treepig, but, well... if you post videos like this and say they're ""worth your time"", chances are that you just aren't very far in it. I'm not going to recommend you criticisms of this film because they're not really going to help you make progress. It's like trying to participate in an argument in French - you just won't understand enough before you've actually learned the language.  Instead, if you're going to understand quantum physics, I'm going to suggest that you start trying to study from some basic material on it. First, depending on how familiar you are with mathematical concepts like matrices and vectors you might want to study linear algebra a bit - you don't actually need any of the more advanced stuff in it, but you do need enough to be comfortable multiplying and scaling them and referring to them in algebraic terms. Unlike watching a video, this will require work. You will have to actually get out pen and paper, you will feel confused, you might be frustrated - but it's not that much work, and you will learn.  A high-school level of mathematics plus basic linear algebra really is pretty much all the basic mathematics you need in order to understand enough of quantum physics to be able to feel your way around most of it. Maybe rehearse your trigonometry a bit, too. But that's pretty much it. You don't even need calculus. You will if you're going into detail, but then I doubt there's really any limit to the amount of mathematics you will need to really understand everything that people are saying about quantum physics.  For instance, it was enough for me to make my way through https://www.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS191x/2013_Spring/about and enjoy it. Don't be put off by it being about quantum computation even if you aren't interested specifically in that - quantum computation, IMO, seems like a great way to understand a lot of the concepts of quantum physics with little mathematics and distracting complexity. I'm pretty sure you can still register and although the homework pages won't check your work, they will show you the answers so you can check yours on your own.  But if you do go into it, please make the effort to make sure you really tried to get the right answer. That's the thing about learning. You could spend the next month spending every waking hour watching videos on Youtube... and chances are you wouldn't learn anything. You have to actually engage. That will actually be worth every minute of your time."

Transhuman,1e4kqd,mind_bomber,7,Sat May 11 13:21:24 2013 UTC,"He was at a school function where my kids attended and after the event we were all in the small school library. He started talking with 'that voice'. I listened for a while and then said ""You were in Waking Life."" (I didn't know who he was at the time.) He kinda slumped and said, ""Yeah"". The movie had just recently been released and he was uncomfortable with the fame and glory. He said they called him three times to ask him to do the movie, and he hung up on them the first two times because he thought they were prank calls."

Transhuman,1e3kwi,Yosarian2,3,Fri May 10 23:15:13 2013 UTC,You might want to check out Diaspora by Greg Egan for a post-singularity perspective. I find myself recommending it a lot lately.

Transhuman,1e3kwi,Ari_Rahikkala,2,Sat May 11 15:13:48 2013 UTC,I'm not sure if i would classify it as pro-transhumanist or anti-transhumanist   Could be a bit of both. Brin makes a sport out of being an optimistic transhumanist in the presence of normal people and a cranky pessimist in the presence of more positive-future people.
Transhuman,1e3kwi,aspen,2,Sat May 11 03:19:43 2013 UTC,"I second this; he was pretty engaging at an author's event last year in San Francisco, but he certainly wasn't a booster. Kind of reminded me of Charles Stross in that respect. I wouldn't say he threw water on the fans, but Brin mostly kept to present-day subjects and political reform."
